Well, dinner was better than expected. Dessert was disappointing. We shared a strawberry shortcake and it was underwhelming. They used  strawberry syrup like from McDonald's and a flavor less cake. I think it's because there are do many great places to get dessert in this town,  I'm surprised when something on the Strip disappoints. I would go back, the lounge and entrées are throwback classics. And we really enjoyed the server.

14899,2011-08-25,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"When I asked the driver to take us to a place near the LV Convention Center for breakfast, I naturally assumed he'd drop us off at the nearest Denny's. Instead, he brought us to Peppermill, a throwback diner with a strip club feel. When we walked in, I couldn't decide if I was looking at a scene from National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation or a Tarantino film.

The décor was straight from the 70s with fake hanging plants and booths wrapped in hot pink and blue neon lights (hence the strip club feel).  The patrons were equally colorful on a weekday morning.

The food was good old Americana. Huge portions and decent prices. $11.50 for 3 eggs, 3 big sausage links, really crispy tasty hash browns, and toast. Coffee mugs were latte size, so you didn't have to wait around for a refill (a plus if you're a caffeine addict like me) which was good because although the server was friendly, she rarely stopped to check on us. Our table was the only table that didn't have regular sugar packets, which we didn't notice that until AFTER we used what we assumed was sugar from the container on the table. It was sugary (red, white, blue pellets) and left a candy like floaties in my coffee. I kept waiting for the hallucinations to start, but ultimately no harm done. 

Overall, it's nothing spectacular, but I love finding new spots and taking in the local color (neon and all). Worth a stop if you're hungry and  on that end of the strip.",B1b-TtQ2tB8BhkJFB-Mnkw,1,0,3,zhJ9WHb7pzdFNCkKJjSHyA
16270,2013-06-30,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I think I hyped this place up in my mind a bit too much, but it was still pretty good. I was really hungry from a long flight and Peppermill was a short walk north of our hotel. The 70s dinner theme was cute. There was a cocktail waitress taking drink orders at 10am, but the drinks took a really long time. Pretty good drinks, though. The highlight was the sugar shaker, which was full of sprinkles. Not your average sprinkles, either. They went really well with our pancakes. The food was good but not out-of-this-world. A good breakfast spot if you are staying north of the strip, but I wouldn't make it a destination.

18991,2012-03-03,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,Gaudy- the best word for the decor! I love this place.  We had gotten off the plane in the middle of the night and wanted good eats and drinks with convenient parking before heading to where we were staying. Peppermill seemed to be the type of place I was looking for.  I was delighted to see free parking and their own parking lot and equally as delighted at the ridiculous decor inside! The menu is huge. My boyfriend had an omelet and I had a panini and fries and we were both stuffed. Glancing around it looked as tho all of the portions were just as big. Once we were done eating we ventured into the lounge and had a seat at the bar and eventually seats cleared out at the cozy fire pit which is surrounded by red rounded couches and lots of mirrors. We enjoyed big tropical drinks and people watched.  The Peppermill is the type of place where anything seems to go...exhausted travelers such as ourselves were welcomed during the week but an evening gown and tux would work just as well. IF you want some late night eats after a night out drinking in a really cool environment I would call this a must do.,yn9HxA3MyJDE0YomSYmWfg,1,0,5,H9ekRS2iW5a5aDg2FmR1KA

Going to a diner, I should probably expect heavier/greasy food but they even go as far as putting a generous helping of whipped butter on your toast.

The burger tastes charred, the gyro seemed like frozen meat and the turkey in the salad looked canned. The ice cream was good, but I'm assuming it was store bought.

and depending on the dishes you order; Giant portions.


I have a few dishes and I consider the caprice sandwich [I think its name is the caprice] is the worst dish I had; while the reuben sandwich is practically the best you could ever have.

While its not like the top restaurants at the Aria and the Wynn; you will not be disappointed at the food they have there. If for nothing else, the outfits the waitresses wear do make the experience that more enjoyable.

We walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly. 

Ok food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here. 

There is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.

It's not crispy like I would prefer, but it's the perfect combination of just corned beef and potatoes.

More neon, mirrors, and red velvet than you can shake a stick at! Oh and the video screens everywhere with cool 80's videos, those are great. 

If you can, get a seat next to the water feature with flames ripping out of it, it's a little warm but pretty cool. 

I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but the food in the lounge is pretty tasty. The selection is standard bar fare. 

The cocktails are not the cheapest in town but they're pretty good, and delivered by sexy ladies. The super sized scorpion is good for a group.

Peppermill is an institution in Vegas.   Walk in here and you walk back in time. There is no question about where you are - 1970s. Vegas.  Neon lights.  Crushed purple velvet.  Mirrors. Vintage waitress outfits.   Worries left at the door.  Yuppp, this place is da bomb.  Our friends who are locals brought us here, and good thing they did because I never would have found it, even though I Yelp and read Chowhound extensively.  Actually we walked by it a few times (we stayed at the Hilton about a block away) and I did wonder what the story was with the place...there is something so non-descript and mysterious about it.  Curiosity solved - we came for breakfast on Sunday morning, whole place is packed with a crowd waiting at the slot machines. Wait doesn't take long though. Look around and everyone is drinking  Bloody Marys.  I had the Tequila Sunset and French Toast with fruit and boysenberry syrup - delish! My husband had the chorizo eggs with refried beans, also very good.  Overall, Peppermill is a great diner and the quintessential Vegas experience.  I'll definitely be coming back here on future trips to Sin City.",Tj58A0_D-WsD-UirmpYSEQ,1,0,5,GyH45IUZFmI0dPgcTxUb9g

But I'll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking: 

""Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it's just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. ""We hate big crowds,"" Keuning says.""You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It's a cool place."" Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that's one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers.""

But smothered in gravy and didn't notice it on the CFS. My husband salad was very much lacking. It had very nice tortilla pieces in the center but they were so stale they weren't very edible. There really wasn't enough beans or avocado to really make this a southwestern. The chicken was cooked very well, very juicy. But overall not worth the price. Luckily we got 25% off for the wait.

155396,2014-07-09,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I've eaten at the Peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. I usually arrive into Vegas on a later, after-work flight from the East coast. By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. 

I have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.

After dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.

I gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.",mRSFSvcA2riLlzTmVhO8mQ,0,0,5,c1rKK84eDP9FvdjhQhspDA

Simply: Peppermill burger was overcooked...not the med-well I asked for. Sourdough was so hard & rough the roof of my mouth is tore up. Fries were ""okay.""  Overall, it was a very dry burger-not the greasy mess I was looking forward to. My friend ordered a med-rare steak & eggs & THAT came out well-done. We were too hungry to send our food back and ate what we could. 

Our server was nice but never refilled our drinks let alone asked. Happy Hour is promoted on Facebook & their website, but NO menu. I had to pull it up online only to be told they didn't have the drinks listed.

The toast was very ordinary and was burned.

Amazingly, I did not see the ghost of Liberace which I kept looking for in the corner of the room.  How I managed to avoid this landmark for my seven years in this town is beyond me.

This review is for the Fireside Lounge only.

The bar was surprisingly busy, filled with a loud bachelorette party, couples lost in each other's eyes, and....a prostitute?  Definitely an interesting crowd.  It's more of a date spot, so if you are looking to meet people (other than prostitutes) you may want to think twice before coming here.

The bartender looked irritated and wasn't friendly and I don't understand the long gowns they make the poor cocktail waitresses wear.  Drinks are a little overpriced considering this really isn't a part of the Strip where tourists hang out.  A beer and a vodka cranberry cost $13.

I have to mention that the floor was FILTHY.  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in about two weeks.  Bleh.

The Fireside Lounge is a place that is trying to cling to its '70's heyday and I like it.  Vegas needs more old-school.  Now if only they can clean the floor and liven up the bartenders then I could see myself stopping by more often.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,4,2,3,MKd6C-9Cf9ZE5A5AlDQAeg
304083,2008-01-12,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I went here and gambled for the first time ever.  Here is a lesson about gambling.  You start off betting 25 cents on video poker and you stick a dollar in the slot so you can play 4 times.  You always get dealt 15 or 16 which is super boring, what do you do?  Hit and probbaly bust or not hit and probably definitely lose?  Anyway at some point you'll realize that if you bet 50 cents you can win more if you actually win and get up to $3.50.  Then you get cocky and bet a dollar twice and your money is gone.

Anyway I liked the Fireside Lunge.  There is a fountain in there with a real fire coming out of the middle of the water, you can sit around it and watch the TV screens which are plentiful and playing football, basketball (hoops) and some music videos, good ones like 80s and Roy Orbison.  That puts you in a good mood.  The lights are really bright blue and red.  Neon, with reflective surfaces and free nuts.  I had an ""Amstel Light"" for $5.50 which was depressing, lost $2 gambling and left.  But no one bothered me and you could just waste a lot of time in there I think.  The bartender was REALLY NICE and there are all these fancy dressed up waitresses with their ass and titties hangin' out all over the place.  A good first stop.  Across the street you can get a souvenir  or go McDonalds or do ""indoor skydiving"" and for all of these reasons, overall I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant, specifically the fireside lounge.

328412,2008-06-02,13,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"""Because I want it twice in a 24 hour period...."" 

Peppermill is the all-around best restaurant that you can only Yelp dream about at night and still obcess about it during the day.  

I was introduced to Peppermill by my friend Jenny who is very particular about her food.  So, when she said she wanted to go to a 24-hour place that's so much better than Denny's, I mustered the excitement that I usually reserve for eating Del Taco (""I guessssss, if there really is nothing elese....).  Upon arrival, you find that it was probably designed by a strip club interior designer:  Neon lights from ceiling to floor and under the tables, mirrored ceilings, sectioned off booths.  Yep, this is Vegas, baby!  

But, the food, oh the food!  I started with the ""waffle ambrosia"" which is a Paul-Bunyan sized waffle covered with fruit and whip cream.  The waffle has this ultra soft inside, crispy outside, and the cake batter is soooo good...The fruit ambosia is a complete cocktail of freshly cut fruit of strawberries, cantaloupe, melon, grapes, pineapple, and bananas.  And you can tell they just cut it right now...as in 5 seconds ago.  And, if you're not a waffle person, the pancakes are just as good.  

So, what else?  Because no person is full on just waffles (I can barely eat half)....

Bone-in Ham Steak:  Do you love ham?  Do you hate ham?  Who cares?  This ham steak is so thick and juicy that you wonder why anyone bothers to eat that sliced sandwich ham stuff.  Aesthetically pleasing too with grill marks.  

Nachos:  BIGGEST NACHOS ever!  Warm chips!  Big chunks of meat!  

Omelets: They use 10 eggs in every omelet and it's so fluffy and yummy... awww....

Ice Cream Sundae for $8:  I have no idea why anyone would want to order this.  Why does anyone order an $8 ice cream sundae?  Now I know.  It's like 3-4 servings of Baskin Robbins sundae...with two bananas and the best strawberry ice cream with real strawberry chunks.  There's chocolate and vanilla ice cream and good nuts and a boat load of whip cream. 

Honestly, every dish is like the perfect dream: the quality is super high, the food is super fresh, the portions are way too big for one person, and you'll eat food in a way that you wonder why there are even other restauants open.  After awhile, you don't know what to order because you crave the waffle ambrosia but you also want some ham-steak.  The last two times we were in Vegas, we had to have it twice a day...No food can really compare.  

And the best part?  A dinner for six with drinks is just a little under $100 with tax and tip.   

And strangely enough, every single waitress is really giddy and sincerely nice.

Dark, with comfy couches, coffee tables and indoor fire pits, and waitresses that wear long black gowns with a slit up to the thigh. And the pina coladas were really good, too.
I couple years later, I was on a girls weekend, and we went to The Peppermill for breakfast.

When we called to make reservations for our large group (10+) for lunch on Father's Day the receptionist let us know that even though they Didn't do reservations, you could still call ahead and get put on the waiting list before you arrived.

The wait was supposed to be 30 minutes, so we called ahead about 30 minutes before we were to arrive. But it took an Additional 30 minutes for them to ready our tables we we got there. Upon asking about the delay about 15 minutes in, they let us know that 1 table had been cleared but they were waiting on a second due to our group size. Understandable.

However, this wasn't wasted time since we all crowded into their beautiful Fireside Lounge for drinks.

What to choose?

After reading fellow Yelper reviews, I was focused on trying two things:
1. The Scorpion 2. The Chicken Fried Steak

The Scorpion was a massive reddish-orange-pink monster. It created an instant buzz: What the heck is that? Can I try that? The double-length foursome of straws were like something out of ""A Christmas Story."" All I could hear repeated in the back of my head was ""You're gonna poke your eye out!"" Instant Photo Opportunity. Being Las Vegas we were able to transport it (slowly) from the Fireside Lounge to the Restaurant area for our meal.

Good sweet Mai Tai flavor. You couldn't taste the alcohol.

P.S. The server let us know that you can keep the Scorpion's cup (Known as a ""Fishbowl"") as a memento for an additional five dollars.

Time to do some eating!

Portions were very large. Great for sharing.

The Southern Chicken-Fried Steak was amazing. Well-breaded. So flavorful. Meaty. Crispy. The kind of food you add to your ""crave"" list. 5/5

The over-easy eggs were fluffy and delightful. 4/5

The hash browns were a disappointment. Kind of soft and mushy. Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will have to ask for them extra-crispy. 2/5

The ""Can I try a bite of that? Oooh Yum!"" List: Their Eggs Benedict 4/5 and also their Pancakes 4/5. I probably would have asked for more samples if I wasn't so happily focused on my Chicken-Fried Steak.

Kind of difficult to get a server since it was so crazy-busy for the holiday. Servers were very nice and attentive once you flagged one down.

This is now one of my must-eat Las Vegas destinations. Yum.

491112,2015-03-08,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Terrible service, nasty food, horrible atmosphere. We came inside and there were a few people waiting. I was told it would be about a ten minute wait ""but probably shorter."" After seeing many groups go ahead of us- including ones that arrived after us including a drunk loud mouth lady who said she had been waiting a while, cursed the host out, and got a table; I decided to find out what was going on. I looked at the list and saw my name up high with a bunch of crossed out names below mine. I was rudely told we had not been past over and would be next. 
I kept thinking ""everyone raves about this place. The food better be damned good because their service surely sucked."" Unfortunately, it wasn't. I ordered buffalo wing appetizers and they looked like they came straight out of a Sysco bag and into the deep fryer. The taste reminded me of something they may have fed us in grade-school. 
My entrée was shrimp scampi; half a dozen or so over-cooked shrimp in some oily sauce. The saving grace was the rice pilaf. Yes, it also looked like it was boiled, or microwaved in a bag, but it was not bad. 
The atmosphere - remember the drunk lady?  Well we were at the table right next to her and every sentence was ""f this and f that, this persons an a-hole, f, f,f....."" I would have said something but she was in a group of people including a large man wearing a ""Tap Out"" shirt who would have likely tied me into a pretzel and made me tap-out. 
To summarize: lousy service, pre-prepared food that you could make better yourself, and a loud terrible atmosphere. We will not be back and the people who raved about this place to me should have their head (and tastebuds) examined.",jyWtQGaCcb2DF1Z8CoVLVA,0,0,1,GeuZHkAgseqLTWDSElcy9Q

All kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor.  It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest.  When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert?  I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here.

Now to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from ""Casino"" filmed there with Sharon Stone.

The food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.

The appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.

I recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.

I really dont know why, but they have separate waiters handling food and drinks. It may be due to the fact that the drinks are handled from the connecting lounge area, but thats just a guess.

The lounge is a great place. Sit around the fire in water and enjoy the blue neon glow. Wait staff varies. I have been to this place many time spanning 2 decades. I love the joint but the waitresses are hit and miss. Often a miss. My recent visit she was pretty slow both speed and on the uptake. Bartender is good though and again, the place is just cool to visit. 

Restaurant side is also a visual splendor. Food is ""OK"". Edible but you are not going to leave saying ""wow great food"". Unless all you care about is portion which 90% of the tourists seem to fall into (large eating large). 

I would tell anyone to visit both restaurant and lounge side for an experience the rest of Vegas has lost. Great date spot.

That being said, if you want to get a group in there at a specific time, be sure to get a reservation in advance.  There's plenty of counter ""diner style"" seating if you're on your own or a couple, though, so walking in might work.  I've eaten here so many I times  over the years I've lost count :)

Great to be able to get breakfast all day!  Nothing like getti g up at 5 PM after a long night on the craps tables and being able to get your pancakes and eggs.

Large.... nay, gigantic, portions on many items.  Nachoes are at least 4 people, fruit plate is easily big enough for 3-4, etc.  Hefty burgers, big bowls of soup and generous portions of fish on the fish and chips (watch this dish, if the grease is a little old in the fryer it might not be the best).

She said she'd bring more because that's all they had. My bf said ""Well, I ordered onion rings anyway..."" She never brought more fries or onion rings.

We saw more of the photographer hacking snapshots on cheap postcards. (If I wanted a photo of myself here, I would take a selfie). What bothered me most is the pricing. Pancakes are $10.50 and with it made into a combo they charge $13.50 a $3.00 upcharge. If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2. And the sausage links were fat and juicy. I don't know if that justifies the cost. I did mention the lack of service to the manager when leaving.

Then I remembered as a kid, I went to Peppermill with my family during those late nights of working late, class or otherwise. I decided to take him and the spawn here. 

We were greeted by a hostess in a rainbow patterned shirt. She was seating other guests so the cashier came up and sat us immediately. As we sat down, a man in an orange Polo (so many different uniforms) brought us water and asked for our drink order. I settled on an orange juice and the babe just had his water. We had Kaitlyn as our waitress. She was really kind, asked about our baby, and took our order. 

WHAT WE HAD: 
Crab cakes
Buiscits and gravy

The crab cakes came in orders of three, topped with diced tomatoes and green onions. They came with a roasted tomato sauce. Both of us loved it!
The biscuits and gravy were good as well. Wish they came out a little hotter, and personally I've had better elsewhere in the valley. My daughter loved them though.

My girlfriend in particular loved her hot chocolate and the already ready sprinkles that they have at every table! She always notices little things like that. After the meal, we paid and went next door to check out the firepit. It's in the bar and lounge area. We sat at the firepit and both had a drink, enjoying the warm fire and the good tunes playing.

However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit.  The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food.  Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare.

A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now.  Omelettes are around $13.  Uh... what?  $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee.

My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in.  The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry.

My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath.  It was greasy and not very good.

Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically.

It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead.  You'll be much happier.  Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time.",GYXEHceoLVJ00e5YuV-TAw,0,0,2,tv6fV_ko6YKukYqYZK7bvQ
923971,2011-10-05,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I stumbled in at about 350am a few weeks ago on a Saturday morning. Maybe it was the day and time that I actually came in, but I was really expecting more from this Vegas classic. The decor was basically strip club fluorescent purple tones with nothing that reminded me of Vegas of the 80's or late 70's when I used to go with my parents as a kid.

The food was good ( a step up from Denny's) and the service was decent. But the worst part of my experience was the patrons. I've never seen such a gathering of hipster douche bags with really bad tattoos - I wish I had my camera.  All I heard around me is people yelling loudly about how they had just rocked out at circus circus or partied at the stratosphere - which is not wrong, just something you don't want to be trying to show off about. My girlfriend and I couldn't even eat comfortably, so we just took our food to go.

Bottom line, if you want get the retro Vegas experience, go to downtown. Its changed, but some places like the horseshoe and especially the freemont still have that 70's and 80's Vegas feel to it. As far as the peppermill (fake retro) big disappointment, but I might try again possibly at a more reasonable time.

Awful. The french toast was undercooked and unappealing while the fruit itself was not ripe or much beyond edible. The fruit salad and french toast on our flight home on Delta was ten times better and very delicious. It's sad when airline food is better than the Peppermill. I had a Mai Tai and the wife had an espresso martini (which was horrible).  As for service, eh, it was okay, she brought us drinks and our food. We didn't tip and that is rare.

My love for Anthony Bourdain's show No Reservations prompted me to check out this place and we had a blast.

The place is tacky in the most awesome way possible...neon lights, mirrors line the walls and fake shrubs everywhere just add to the ambiance. We went on a Thursday, well, early Friday morning and it was the perfect amount of busy. There were 4 of us and we found a place to sit right away. The seating is cool and intimate. The actual fire lounge area is meant more for couples as the couches that circle it only seat 2 people. 

Looking around the joint, it was a good mix of people. There were some couples on dates, the obvious locals, larger groups and everyone was having a chill, good time.

The specialty drinks are as tacky as the decor and again, I say that in the most loving way. The four of us shared a big ass fruity drink called the Scorpion and then ordered 4 separate cocktails. We also ordered the sampler platter that consisted of fried chicken strips, fried mozarella, fried shrimp, onion rings and bruscetta, basically drunk people food :) Our bill was only about $70!

As far as I know it's open 24 hours, it's in the dicey area of the strip but who cares! It's worth the possible mugging  ;) We only hung out in the lounge area, didn't check out the restaurant so I can't comment on that.

This casual dining restaurant on the north end of the Strip between the Riviera and Encore/Wynn is... kinda strange when it comes to decor.

The place is super dark, with black floor to ceiling and then neon blue and pink lights accenting just about everything. I was uncertain about actually eating here because the decor just does not evoke the kind of restaurant it actually is.

As for the food, it's definitely above average, family restaurant fare. Lots of breakfast items available all day long, plus a long list of sandwiches and the like. I treated myself to a plate of nachos as an entree since I had been craving them all week. They were among the better I've had, with real melted cheese on top, although they did go a bit overboard with the beef. The people from my conference I was with seemed to enjoy their cheesesteak and burger as well. It probably won't be the best you've ever eaten, especially if you're from a bigger city, but it's pretty darn good.

The service wasn't so spectacular. Our waitress wasn't very attentive and had this attitude about her that wasn't so much pleasantly refreshing as it was, ""I have better places to be than here, but that isn't your fault so I'm not going to be outright mean.""

And the prices, definitely higher than comparable places not in Las Vegas, but still far cheaper than most of what you'll find on the Strip. And the portions are pretty huge. I couldn't finish my nachos, and I had barely eaten anything else that day up until that point.

So yeah, it's far from perfect, but it's a nice place to eat when you want a good sit down meal, but are sick and tired of being fancy on the Strip.",ai5xAV3B9OO7roqG6GiZzA,3,2,3,BOxT0-3lLV_MoQunxARn_g

In perusing Tripadvisor while sitting in the Firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon Peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  Oh my, what a trip.

We drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.

Tacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  Neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout the darkened room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple ""what happens in Vegas stays..."" photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)

When our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. 

Peppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  The after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.

So a waitress cleaned off our table and asked what we wanted to drink so my wife ordereda drink for us to share because it was a large drink and I hadnt ate yet.

I refuse to remove my hat because not only I didnt see a sign stating it but i saw few indivduals in the same area wearing hats so I asked for management, management arrived and she stated that it was just there policy she could gove me a solid reason for the policy she proceeded to tell me about their lawyers came up with this policy odd?

1078352,2014-08-12,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Wow, I remember a time not so long ago (well into the 1990's) when ""Steak and eggs on-demand 24 x  7, $5.95"" was synonymous with Las Vegas and partaking of such fare at the Flamingo, the Stardust, and the real Vegas casinos was an essential part of the Vegas experience.  Fast forward-ing to Steve Wynn's Vegas of 2014 can be dismally unsettling and attempting to get ANY real dinner past 10PM will end up being a disappointing if not downright depressing quest.  Pretty ironic given the shows let out between 10-11.  Enter Peppermill..  Best thing I ever did was ask my cab driver where to get a steak dinner after a show at the Westgate, he dropped us off at Peppermill and stepped into the Vegas I know and love.  The food, full steak dinner, fabulous ambience, and the place was packed with like-minded late-night eaters.  I remember Peppermill from Santa Clara of the mid 1990's - I hear it's gone - it was the same place as this, though randomly placed across Intel, HP, AMD buildings- an oasis/breath of fresh air amid a rapidly developed Silicon Valley locus, same vibe, same neon, all good....",BP8q0MSmJYsPOry8ujycJA,1,1,5,TycnHX1k8KVLwiigzdf2YQ

Service is exceptionally attentive, especially when your drink is empty.  What I LOVED was my pastrami sandwich.  Big and tasty, toasted bread, this sandwich would be right at-home on 6th Avenue in Manhattan. They missed their fifth star with a lackluster Caesar salad, which, in addition to not really being a Caesar salad (DON'T get me started on that topic, almost no one makes a real Caesar salad any more) was also limp and lacking sufficient dressing.  My friend had a Porterhouse that was tasty, cooked to his liking, and priced reasonably.  Free and easily accessible parking, too.

The ribeye was not that good, especially for $31. The steak was lower grade, lots of fat (and not in the traditional yummy marbling way of ribeye steaks). The onion strings served on top were mainly just fried bread. 
The mashed potatoes were fake. They even tasted fake. Probably the worst part of the meal. If I was a famous Las Vegas restaurant, I'd be embarrassed to even list mashed potatoes as a side option. 
The sautéed mushrooms were probably my favorite part of the food.

Where to start.  How about how our waitress didn't show up to our table for about 20 minutes.  Much of the awfulness of this place does have to do with possibly the worst person who has ever called herself a waitress.

Two dry, overcooked pieces of chicken sitting on a pile of pasta and sauce that was at the point where you could stand a fork in it.

But the venue is extremely cool, and rates an extra star.

If you happen to be Andre the Giant or a member of the I.F.O.C.E, you'll be able to eat everything on your plate.  Otherwise, I'm not liking your chances.  In other words, the portion sizes are quite large.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and a Miller Lite(!)...was able to muscle my way through them, but barely touched the accompanying refried beans.  Very tasty.

I sat at the counter, so I was able to see a lot of entrees come off the line and hear the waitresses complain about each other.  Riveting.
The waffle would feed a family of four, I swear.

FOOD:  Eggs Benedict (as CJ said) was yummy!  

I ordered the Western fruit plate / platter that usually comes with banana bread & marshmallow cream sauce which 1) I did not want and 2) they did not have, so CJ asked if I wanted a muffin or something in lieu. Of my choices, I  chose the lemon muffin which CJ said was really good and it REALLY was! Loved it!  The only thing....CJ could have warned me of the large amount of fruit that I had unknowingly ordered. Yikes! But so yummy!

ESTABLISHMENT:  Came across Peppermill via Yelp, and its old school Vegas charm & good reviews made us pick it as our late breakfast / lunch destination.

Haven't been to Vegas for nearly 9 years now, I  initially thought the low ceilings, neon lights & crowd made this to be a wrong choice on our part.

Even at 2 in the afternoon, it was crowded with a steady stream of people.  We were greeted right away, the gal took our name, told us it was about a 20 minute wait and said we could wait in the bar if we'd like. 

The bar is to the left, separated from the dining area itself.  Thank goodness cuz it was a bit too smokey for our taste.  Cool bar area though!  Just a little to early in the day for us for that atmosphere.  (Yes, we're a little older in age.  Oh and I'm a former smoker.)

We waited in the entry area instead which is kinda small, with slot machines on one wall & a big support beam towards another wall.

We waited about 10-15 minutes before being called for our table. Because the hostess called two parties & we both approached the hostess desk, there was a little confusion about who she was taking to be seated.

There was a gal walking around offering to take a ""complimentary"" picture of us, but we declined.  She was nice, not pushy, but....no thanks.

There was a gal dressed in a long black dress (wait staff, hostess, cashier had uniforms), asking us for any drink orders.  Nice & attentive, remembered to check on us.

SUMMARY:  Cool place to check out. Our waitress made our experience exponentially better.  Other staff was nice.  Food was yummy.  

Would we go back again? Probably not.  But this review comes from a near 50, partied hard in my younger days but now I'm more into the wine & chill scene, kind of person.

It was like the restaurant was stuck in the 70's but I quickly got accustomed to the lights. Since i was by myself and I didn't want to sit at one of the large booths I sat at the counter. The waitress came over quickly with water and the menu and the woman who delivers drinks (holy cow!) came over to ask if I wanted anything from the bar. No draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of Corona. As I watched the dishes passed over from the chefs I couldn't believe how large the portions were. I ordered the Reuben and potato salad and couldn't finish it all. The sandwhich was very good and the potato sald was (not as good as Mom's) but decent. I would def go back there again.,ZYzvo6WJWD31S78PgnOlpQ,1,0,4,FQpSH6WsoVXKL05PaADM0g

Weird mix in that the lounge feels like it used to be a strip club, while the diner looked slightly nicer than your typical Denny's.  At least the 2 are separated by a glass door.

I also ordered a pineapple and strawberry mimosa; now that was the shiiiiiz. The sandwich was packed with pesto, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. The bread was a nice toasty, crusty ciabatta full of flavor; nice and chewy too. I also tried some of my friend's buffalo wings! That was so delicious. The chicken wings and drumsticks were super meaty and not like those tiny ones you might get at other places. The ranch was good and didn't taste like it came straight out the bottle.

1231985,2014-05-28,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Walking into The Peppermill is like walking into a lounge on a cruise ship. (Think mirrors, neon lights, palm trees, and flamingos.) If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.

When we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.

Although we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.

That was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.

After dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both.

Over the decades, bits and pieces of stand alones (stores, cafes, smaller casinos) have been plucked from the ground like weeds. I think it is a good thing for Vegas's economy but I also feel that something should be preserved, maybe that's why I have always liked this place.  I have a fondness for Peppermill because it is as old as I am, we were both born in 1972. 

On my most recent visit, I bought a friend for brunch before I ran him to the airport. As soon as we were seated he mentioned that it reminded him of diners in Jersey where he grew up. I felt I made an excellent choice because nostalgia is always a good thing! We decided to split the enormous pancakes and Joe's San Francisco Special. We also ordered coffees and of course this cocktail darling couldn't resist one of their glorious Bloody Mary's! 

The portions are huge so it may be a good idea to split it or know you will have breakfast food leftovers for awhile! The Joe's SF Special was like a huge platter of ""stuff""... Eggs, ground beef, sausage, spinach, Potato, cheese all together. It was pretty awesome and comforting. The pancakes are huge! When the serving platter was placed on the table my friend exclaimed ""What's this?"". Uh those are pancakes my friend. I really want to meet the spatula that flips those pancakes. Do they use two arms to flip it? I'm pondering but need to finish up here. The Bloody Mary! Get one.

I ordered the cheese sticks and nachos for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were pretty good but the nachos were out of this world! They were HUGE! (And extremly tasty.)

We enjoyed the restaurant so much we came back for a second round! We ordered Wings, breakfast food and a sandwich (I can't remember the name) with roast beef, thousand island and a few other things which sort of resembled a reuben.

1319190,2014-01-22,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"We first came to the Fireside Lounge just before Halloween. I had read about this place in the Nevada AAA travel book. It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would ""treat you like big shots"" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren't gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we've been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I'd like to sit by the fireplace.

Then we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.

Now here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, ""you're supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated."" We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No ""thank you for dining with us"" or ""have a nice holiday"" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn't want to ruin my husband's day, I didn't argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left. 

I would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don't want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee.",LUa06gpj2yaBSB8Qew3DCg,1,0,4,dvAF7gw2uAwXnFggPG3nRQ

It's tacky-in-a-fun-way, gaudy-glam, neon, old-style Vegas and I love it. Lots of purples, pinks and turquoise. There can be a wait, depending on when you go, but it's worth it, in my opinion. Quick note-- if you are a person of larger proportion, the booths can be a bit of a squeeze. My ex-husband did NOT care for that when we went. 

The food runs pretty much the lines of good diner food, and the portions are HUGE. 

There's also a large bar menu, and the Scorpion is a fun fishbowl-sized drink to share. We also had another drink that tasted fantastic-- I swear it was called ""Bathtub"" or ""Bathtime"" something, but I have to apologize-- after that Scorpion, my notes got a liiiiiittle fuzzy.

I CAN, however, tell you the Nachos, Nachos, Nachos were MOUNTAINOUS and very tasty. We opted to add the ground beef and it actually came on top (not on the side as the menu stated) but we didn't care (see aforementioned Scorpion) and enjoyed them immensely. 

Oh, and at some point, someone will come and take your picture and then offer to sell you a package, but they always give you a cute little print for free, so that's a nice souvenir.

     Now I only get to visit once a year, since I no longer live just a few hours from Vegas. Some visits have been better than others for sure, but I don't think I've ever walked out unhappy. This time I had the Mediterranean omelet ($14), which was good and the creme brulee ($7), which was OK.

The Good:
Not only was the omelet huge but more importantly it was good. There was plenty of pretty good quality shrimp and a fair dose of crab. The Hollandaise sauce was flavorful and complimented it well without taking away from the flavor of the shrimp and crab.

The Bad:
The only complaint, and it's not a severe one, is the waitress didn't do a very good job of keeping up with our drinks. It was just bad enough to be annoying, not bad enough to be frustrating.

The Indifferent:
The hash browns that came with the omelet were fairly unremarkable but I have to warn you, while I will eat them, I'm not a huge fan of hash browns so you might want to take my opinion on this with a little caution. 
     While I don't really expect much from creme brulee, I have had a couple that I really savored. This one wasn't in that category, while it was good enough it wasn't any better or worse than the average.",maeTOPoDpldg7ltkDmOVaA,3,0,4,eByY6QKT_GEwNam3InANyg

The lounge had enough people to take up the chairs around the 1 fire pit they had but besides that, pretty much no one. The food if I may quote another yelper is like overpriced Denny's food. The service sucked in both the restaurant  and lounge. So in the restaurant they have the food runner ask your drink order but if you order alcohol then the waitress has to take that order. I guess the food runner's not allowed to serve alcohol or she just wasn't old enough to serve alcohol I'm assuming. Anyhow, that was kind of annoying. Not too mention the waitress took forever to actually come over to take that order, then forgot a drink. The lounge sucked too. Kind of dirty as in the couches you sit on and the floor. We went in and sat ourselves and waited and waited but no one asked if we wanted drinks. So I went to the bar and ordered our drinks which were kind of pricey and didn't have much alcohol in them. As I pull out my lil wad of money I could see the cocktail waitress standing to the left of the bar eyeballing and giving me a dirty look. Probably cause I went to the bar myself but hey, if you snooze you loose chick. Should have taken our order when we walked in. I gave em 2 stars cause it wasn't horrible and since it does serve food 24 hours a day. I just didn't feel it was worth my money or time. I really not sure why they have 4 stars on yelp. Maybe their breakfast is good I guess.  I more then likely won't be coming back unless I can't get any late night food somewhere else Vegas.

I don't know what kind of theme this place is going for. Everything about it screams cum stained strip club from the velvet seats to the neon ceiling lighting.

Aside from the decor, the food is fantastic. Big plates of just pure American feast. And if you didn't know already, when you order their omelettes or anything with eggs, they use 10 eggs. Yeah. TEN.

We were seated promptly, and within five minutes, our food orders were taken, our bar orders were fulfilled by a different waitress/bar girl, and our sodas and waters were refilled. I swear, I think we were helped by at least six different people, and usually at this time of night, most places are running on skeleton crews.

I've been wanting to try Peppermill for a while now, especially with all the reviews. We talked to a few locals who were concert go-ers that night and they highly recommended that we head over to Peppermill.  

When you are driving there, just be aware that Peppermill is located somewhat off the strip by the Convention Center. It's next to a Ross and there is ample public parking.

We entered into Peppermill and it was like stepping into a cheezy night club/vegas dive bar/I really don't even know what. The decor is super cheezy and kitchy. I loved it.  It's definitely one of those ""you must experience it for yourself"" kind of places.

I ordered the eggs benedict per my fellow yelper's recommendations.  I loved the hollendaise sauce and the portion size was amazing. The hash browns were cooked a little longer than usual and they were crunchy and tasty.

The S.O. ordered a feta omelette and I'm not sure what kind of beast of a creation came out.  As the S.O. was eating his omelette, he said, ""Geeze, I'm getting full, I wonder how many eggs are in this thing?"" The waitress replied, ""Anywhere from 10-12 eggs."" Holy heart attack, Batman!

The female waitresses are dressed in short shorts, but fully clothed on top.  It is not risque at all, so don't worry about bringing the kids (you shouldn't bring your kids to Vegas in the first place...please leave them at home, you are ruining my vacation!!!), but it's a nice sight for guys. 

I've mostly been here for breakfast, so I'm not sure about the lunches and dinners, but all of the breakfast items that I've tried have been very good.  My particular favorite is Munch's Breakfast.

The Fireside Lounge is a bar that is adjacent.  I believe it is a full bar.  Usually a cocktail waitress walks around the restaurant to take bar orders.

Peppermill is on the pricey side, but portions are very, very large to help make up for it.  2 people can definitely share one meal and both get full.

Being vegan I still actually enjoy a good junk food midnight indulge every once in awhile...
And wow this is the place to do it...wow...
So WTF does a vegan order there? Not the yummy looking brushetta because it has cheese in it :)

Going light:  I get the TOMATO STACK CAPRESE STYLE 
Sliced ripe tomatoes layered with fresh Mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. With NO CHEESE of course.

Going for the full Monty: I get the CAPRESE STYLE CIABATTA. 
Toasted Ciabatta, fresh basil, Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and pesto sauce, served with fresh fruit ambrosia.                                    With NO CHEESE of course. Oh and forget the fruit ambrosia lol I think it means marshmallows and it's not because the marshmallows are not vegan.......it's because I want their famous pound of french fries. 

Sounds healthy huh? But I don't care because you know what...those HUGE cocktails that they bring to me are not healthy either ;) 

Keep in mind that NEITHER of these items are available in the super duper Fireside Lounge area...just the diner side. But no worries just grab drinks in the Fireside and then head to the diner side...or reverse that situation!

We have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and have heard people rave about the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside lounge for all 20 years -- but had never gone -- until yesterday. 

We had a friend staying at the Wynn and we decided to go out for lunch, and were not in the mood to pay the prices for drinks and food at the Wynn restaurants. None of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the Peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.

The decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!

I can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.

We had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.

On the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)",OtoCNQSiG-xHf35lUsolNw,2,0,5,xBwgorGwityNNriDJfKJSQ

The drinks are good (I had the Cherry Bomb) and the help is OK. There was a creepy manager, all of 20 years old with a neck tattoo, but that was the only downside.

All of the reviews stating that the decor is crazy, are so true! Mirrored ceiling tiles, pink and blue lighting, fake flowers, and flamingo lamps! Wow. Hello vegas. I've missed you.

The breakfast menu was extensive and the feta cheese and vegetable omlette caught my eye. Artchokes at a restaurant that looks like a strip club? Yes please!! I saw they had a meal with turkey sausage but it wasn't listed on the 'Sides' menu. Plus a side of meat was $5 and so that wouldn't have won anyways. The boyfriend got a ham and cheese omlette and about 15 minutes later, two giant plates arrived before us. Each omlette must have been made with at least 5 eggs and there were about 2 potatoes worth of hashbrowns. My omlette was delicious and there were tons of vegetables and some provolone cheese melted in the centre, with feta on top. We both managed to take half of our meals to go and they fully fed us the next morning too. For $12 per meal, that's an awesome deal.

I would have to say that the perfect ending to our meal was a party of 3 who came and sat across from us. Not only did one member have a giant 1L bottle of watter with him, but he also put on his sunglasses 5 minutes after they arrived. A hangover at its best!

Would I come back here if in Vegas again? Ehhh, most likely not, but I don't have anything really bad to say about it. It's location is certainly not in the most convenient spot if you are staying and walking around the strip. It's just too far north of all the action so taking a taxi, Uber, Lyft, or driving yourself would be the most convenient option.

Unfortunately, google led us to this sad sad establishment that looked more like a cheap brothel with its decor and bright florescent pink & blue lights. We ordered the Peppermill sampler. This name should be changed to ""The Frozen Walmart Sampler"" We've had higher quality food from CVS. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, we were presented with a bottle of pond water. And at $34 it felt equivalent to a punch in the tooth. I enjoy the taste of nose bleeds better. Our entrees were Gyros & a rack of pork ribs. When I say Gyros, I mean dried out sanitary towels that wouldn't even satisfy the drunkest person. I'd rather wither away in the Vegas dessert than eat these Gyros that were wrapped in a loaf of bread. And as for the pork ribs, I've seen more quality meat on a stray Afghan dog. The ribs were smothered in what can only be described as Goodwill's branded barbecue sauce. We took one bite of these entrees & immediately realized we had made the worst mistake either of us had made in our entire lives. My boyfriend stated that he'd rather be given a prostate exam by Captain Hook, I agreed. We were given better service from the uber driver. We were seen by so many waiters/waitresses it was enough to cause attachment issues in our personal relationships. As for the bathrooms, they were disgusting. They had has much cleanliness as a porta potty construction site after they had eaten Mexican food. I thought Jack Nicholson was going to axe down the door. The overall atmosphere was equivalent to that of Michael Jackson's funeral. The costumes that the people in the kitchen wear will fool you, they are not chefs.

1483400,2014-04-21,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Picture the movie Casino, which may stir up images of how Las Vegas looked before the turn of the century. Before almost every casino, bar, and restaurant either became 5 stars, a total dump, or was owned by some big conglomerate, there was something in between. The Peppermill, my friends, is just that. 

The Peppermill is a piece of history. Nostalgia if you will. It brings back memories of days gone by. It's nothing fancy. It's simply an old school diner, with old school vinyl booths, waitresses, and colors in a non-pretentious setting that probably hasn't changed in some time. The food is typical diner fare and nothing that will blow your socks off, but I must say that my Denver omelette reminds me of something that even Fred Flinstone would have a hard time finishing. 

The prices, although more than an average diner, aren't too bad, especially compared to some of the lush Vegas breakfast buffets. The Peppermill is located down the strip in front of the Riviera, which means having to fight large crowds and hungover tourists is minimal and an added bonus! 

If you're looking for fresh coffee, fresh eggs, and a side of personality in a casual setting, then look no more. You have reached your destination.",46Wi08T5D3phf3SMgi7U3w,2,1,4,xplaQmamhP5nWyUNvnHmCg

  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...
    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  
   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.
  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.

Maybe it was my choice in food, maybe it was the fact I was about to go get a tattoo, and that was on my mind, but either way, this place didn't WOW me.  Happened upon this joint based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  We went on Valentine's Day for lunch.  Loved the decor- the funky old school vibe was neat.

The coffee was big and excellent.  We shared the tomato soup which was surprisingly cheesy and very good.  In addition, we shared a chicken balsamic sandwich, which was fine, but nothing special.  The onion rings it came with were good, but nothing different than your typical onion ring.  The service was just so-so... had to ask a couple times for water, but it was super busy so that was understandable.

First off, its a bit down from where the hotels are located. However, after a long 15-20 min walk, you'll be glad that you made the trek. When we arrived on Friday, there was about a 15-20 min late. Not too bad. The dining room is huge with ample seats at the kitchen as well. The lounge is separate from the dining room. 

We ordered a couple of bloody marys that were HUGE and so delish. We ordered the country chicken fried steak and corned beef hash. The portions are HUGE. But oh-my-guh. So good. I tried to eat as much as I could because I knew I would never find anything like this anywhere else again.

The food was pretty good, country fried steak & eggs, how can you go wrong?  And how would you know if it was wrong because its smothered in yummy gravy!  The corned beef hash was pretty good, nice and salty.  The one flop of the meal was someone's peppermill omelet.  Otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.

I personally prefer the fireside lounge, I am not a big fan of the restaurant, mostly because the food is basically Denny's but twice the price, but the bar is another story.

The decor is fun and electric (literally ELECTRIC)! It's great late night comfort food, especially when you've been drinking and partying all night...er.. when you DON'T have the kids, of course!
Okay so my review is for May 2010 when we visited here. It was our first night in Las Vegas and a first time bringing a child and...me being 7 months pregnant (so no partying for me this time! I was craving steak and was VERY skeptical about ordering it at a place like this. I ordered the New York ! New York ! 27.95 (yes, the price is quite high) ***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: 12oz. hand-cut and trimmed, flame-broiled to perfection and served with sautéed mushrooms.*** Let me tell you that for someone that actually does NOT consider herself a red meat lover and eats it only on rare occassions (even though all my reviews seem to be centered on steak houses and burger joints LOL!), THIS WAS EXCELLANT EXCELLANT EXCELLANT! The kitchen staff really know their steaks! I thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! And being pregnant I had to order it more cooked than I would usually so I believe I got it Medium-Well...still amazing! Flavorful AND tender! So 5 stars there!
On another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the Strawberry Shortcake 6.95
***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: Moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy French vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** WHAT A TREAT! Fantastic! LOVED IT! We were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! Haha, it was a fun night. We love the Peppermill! ***Don't forget to wave to the kitchen staff on your way out. They REALLY appreciate that. :)
FIRESIDE LOUNGE: When my man and I go to Las Vegas as adults, we LOVE the Fireside Lounge in all it's glowing ambiance! The drinks are fun, the hostesses are beautiful and elegant and they are always nice about taking our picture by the molten fire pit, hehe. The only thing I am sad about are the TV's they put in.

The portions are huge (omelettes have 10 eggs, why not just make it a dozen lol) 

The 2nd time I went to the fire lounge had a bloody mary, and was seated with the same server again who was just as amazing as the 1st time. However the food was not as good. We ordered cheese sticks which were good and the nachos. I have heard the legend of these nachos and I will NEVER order them again. I got them and the beans that came on the side tasted and smelled rotten. I almost threw up! It took me 25 minutes to waive down the server when she finally came and we told her the beans were bad she took it to the kitchen, came back and said there was a problem with the beans. WELL maybe she should have checked on other tables to make sure they dont eat rotten beans.

The Peppermill has been a 'must go' and honestly excellent choice for dining any time of day for us.

The restaurant has beautiful Tiffany lamps over each table that were made for the Peppermill specifically.  I wanted to buy one, but sadly, they are originals and made for the restaurant only. I LOVE the lamps!  They add to the ambience, along with the other lighting that reminds me of the beautiful past of Las Vegas. 

The menu is amazing, offering a multitude of choices for breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner and all day dining.

We usually show up right after the lunch rush, when it is a little less busy.  It's a little less busy, but less likely to have to wait for a table.

The meals we chose this time were different than the usual eggs Benedict and Lorraine Omelet, or Cobb salad.  We went off the normal grid and went for sandwiches.  The menu has SO MANY things to offer, it takes a few minutes [or more] to decide.

I chose the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich on sourdough bread, sans onions and with cottage cheese instead of fries and it was delicious!  The sandwiches are HUGE and more than enough to share.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, and exactly as I ordered.  

Hubby chose the Peppermill Club sandwich, which is served with huge crispy onion rings.  Again, delicious and enough to share. It was absolutely EXCELLENT!

We were lucky enough to be in Vegas longer so on our second visit, our friend went along and ordered the pancakes. They are, like everything at the Peppermill, huge and enough to share.  Served with multiple choices of toppings, a side of eggs and choice of meat, it's a meal that will take you through the day, and again, enough to share.

I branched out on that second visit and went for the French Dip sandwich on sourdough bread, which is served with Au Jus and I chose the sweet potato fries to go with the meal. It was absolutely amazing!  Again, enough to share and more than I could possibly eat in one seating.

Hubby ordered the Peppermill Bloody Mary and said it was also wonderful.

The service is impeccable.  From the minute people are seated, they are greeted with a refreshing glass of water and offered drinks while guests have the time to peruse the menu, which genuinely does take some time to decide; so many choices!  All cooked to order and FRESH!

Honestly, we have literally been there at least 100 times since The Peppermill opened.  Collage French Toast is delicious, and my kids favorite. There are so many different things we've enjoyed over the years, and have always had a great time.

The Fireside Bar is set away from the main dining area and features an awesome fire pit lounge seating area for enjoying quite conversations, and a main bar seating area.  It's calming and beautiful.

Going to Vegas?  The Peppermill is something to make sure is on your 'must go,' list.  Hands down, one of the very best places to dine.",GWf0oDFCwx-bNS6LhL75gA,0,0,5,oLf5plxLwuOEzVvVYZpNwQ

Oh and not one speck of dust or dirt. The whole place is pristine. They've got someone assigned to sweep the carpet even.

It all still looks like what I remember when I used to frequent the Peppermill lounges back in the day with my hot date aka Mr. B.

Let's begin this review by saying - if you haven't been here, you're missing out!

This place is open 24/7. Located on the strip, near Encore & Wynn. Fireplace lounge (don't miss this part) perfect for cold Vegas nights. Great early & late happy hour specials. Crazy colors & lights everywhere. Extensive cocktail menu. Breakfast served all day & night. HUGE desserts perfect for sharing. Great diner food with something for everyone.

They make the waitresses wear these awful, ugly uniforms (it reminds me of the flair Jennifer Aniston had to put up with in Office Space).

We went here for breakfast, and it wasn't actually okay.  The omelettes and pancakes were both good.  And for breakfast, it is a little different food and atmosphere than you get in the buffets on the mostly Disney-fied Las Vegas strip.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,1,0,3,CLvy0HmrlCXvjw-f6dkWLw

1714277,2016-01-01,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I'll start by saying the server, Nellie, was wonderful. The food was very well made as well. Unfortunately, due to the unprofessional and extremely rude attitude of the manager on duty at the time, Peggy, I have to give this establishment 1 star.

While in the restroom, a male employee opened the door and said ""Lady, I have to clean""  and added something along the lines of telling me to hurry up. 

I went up to the host podium and politely asked to speak with a manager. Peggy said that she was the manager, so I told her that I appreciate the fact that they keep their restroom cleans for their guests. However, having a male employee open the door and ask you to hurry up is unsettling and was an unpleasant experience. 

Peggy then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't have said that to me because, ""he doesn't even speak English"". I responded by stating he knew enough to stay that. I can excuse the way he said that, knowing that there was in fact a language barrier. That's fine, I am not saying anything poor in regards to his work ethic. It's hard to work somewhere where the predominant language is not your own. 

However, to be told he didn't say that to me, is condescending, unprofessional and rude. A manager should never speak that way to a guest and they definitely should not end the conversation, which was civil (I wasn't yelling or making a scene, I was simply telling her it was an off putting encounter), by then walking away without another word. 

It wasn't busy. At that time, there was only one couple waiting to be seated. If I was the owner, this woman would never be representing their establishment. Such an unfortunate situation because everything else from the food to the decor was lovely.",EKUdyF_2xgMxSw2UbOLguA,0,0,1,PUt5d2uNGE1FfWOd38bSwQ

I just didn't give 5 stars cuz there was a lady taking photos and selling them to you but first she introduced herself as being part of the restaurant deal but she ended up being an outside vendor. After offering me a free deal she presented a set of photos to be purchased.

Lots of neon lights and plush seating.  They have a cool water based fire pit.  Hard to describe but very cool. Its a nice lounge to order drinks while you wait to be seated to eat.  The restaurant portion is also very unique with fake plants making it feel like your eating in some odd cross between the jungle and a Dennys. For food, you get a ton of food for your buck.  So its awesome by any measure. The food itself wont blow you away but its solid fare. I ordered biscuits and gravy and its a TON of biscuits and gravy.  I got sides of eggs and hashbrowns (if you want it crispy I recommend you ask for that as mine were kinda soft) and I couldn't finish half.  While we were there we tried both the mimosas and the bloody marys (if you get an extra shot, then its def a stout drink!) and we enjoyed both.

I had the New york steak dinner with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My mashed potatoes were awful. My mushrooms were too garlicky, unedibley garlicky and my steak was plain. Lucky for them that is how i like my steak because it has no flavor, none. my aunt had some kind of fusilli pasta with pancetta and tomatoes, which was very good. the best thing anyone at the table ordered actually. and it was way overpriced for what we got.

1737686,2016-07-24,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Have seen the place over the years of working in, or just visiting Las Vegas.  Finally decided to try it after reading all the reviews.  I enjoyed the look of the place, and the lounge is small, but kind of cool.

Don't know what all the 5 stars are for, perhaps for the look of the establishment, couldn't have been for the food.  The food was just okay.  I ordered eggs, sausage links and hash browns (they don't serve home fried potatoes - what a shame).  I was disappointed that the sausage links are turkey.  They also tasted like nasty.  My hash brown potatoes were cold.

Our service was terrible.  Our waitress seemed to prefer spending more time at other tables than ours.  I never got that second cup of coffee I asked for during the meal, only when I asked for the check did she ask if I still wanted more coffee.  Really?  We also asked for extra napkins and condiments, and towards the very end of our meal they came.  

One last thing.  I ordered a Bloody Mary at the lounge while waiting to eat breakfast.  For the price, you'd think it would be fantastic.  Not.  Plain tomato juice and a splash of booze.  It tasted like I was drinking plain tomato juice.  I was very, very disappointed, sitting in those very, very uncomfortable chairs at the bar.

My overall opinion is to stay away from the place, as it serves up food just a notch below Denny's.  It's bloody Mary's are terrible.  Both the food and the drinks are overpriced for what you're receiving, especially compared to other restaurants.  The service was for me terrible, especially when noticing that how they treat you like shit, then dote on others around you.      If you're going to cook and serve food, at least cook and serve it the same for each customer.  Not specific ones.

They seem to pat themselves on the back for having a restaurant with a lounge that has survived there for awhile (just an observation from the menu).  All I have to say is people are idiots if they keep coming back.  Over priced food and drinks.  Underwhelming flavor.  Terrible service.

So I checked the Yelp Las Vegas and Instagram reviews and it got a green light. We spied on the table close to the door and the ""Nachos, Nachos, Nachos"" with Ground Beef looked amazing! So of course we checked reviews and ordered the ""Nachos, Nachos, Nachos"" as well. Now let me tell you were it went wrong: Our server insisted that the Ground Beef was way too greasy and we should get it with Chicken. That my IG friends was a HUGE mistake! The chicken was flavorful, but it was a mountain of cheese, chicken, and some of the strongest white onions I have encountered in a couple months. We had to ask for the refried beans and got no Sour Cream or Guacamole. We regretted not ordering the Greasy Ground Beef!  The Burgers were very good: Pastrami Burger and PepperMill Burger...burgers were seasoned well, not overcooked, and bread was fresh. I will good back next year, but for breakfast. ____

The server was awesome and very apologetic. A nice lady came by and took our picture and gave us one with a very sweet note on the back.

I got their Marco Polo omelet, which was so tasty! Their sauce on top just made it so good, and the omelet is really huge! It comes with hash browns and your choice of bread. We also got their bagels, and woah. The bread was so fresh, that it was easy and smooth to pull apart. It made eating bagels a lot more pleasing.

They are open 24/7.  Want breakfast after an all night bender playing cards in the casinos or a Sundae dessert to drown your sorrows after a March Madness loss?  Go to Peppermill.

Peppermill is a throwback time machine trip to the 70s, and I mean that in the best way possible.  The restaurant decor is plush, comfy booths with neon lighting and the waitresses serve in Playboy bunny-like outfits.  The cocktail waitresses wear polyester evening gowns and serve drinks inside the Fireside lounge with a firepit made of lavarock.  Definitely a ""boom chica wow wow"" vibe.  They are popular at all hours of the day, so don't be surprised if you'll wait a few minutes to be seated.   The secret is out.

Service is excellent.  Coffee is always hot, fresh and bottomless and you'll never go without a refill.  Inclusive of the rainbow sugar dispenser on the table. I indulge in their iced tea.  I learned the serve Teva brand and I am a big fan.  Food is Americana fanfare and you can't go wrong with diner style comfort food.  Burgers are huge and a satisfying portion.   I enjoyed the 3-tier Club Sandwich. Freshly sliced real turkey (not processed lunch meat)  crisp bacon, lettuce and tomatoes served on lightly toasted choice of bread.  So big, you'll most likely take a doggie bag home.

I was transported to childhood memories with the neon and fake tree decor - and signature colored sugar container on the table - I've never seen that done anywhere else. My Nana actually ""borrowed"" (her words) one of those back in the day via her big fat purse. One of these days I'll buy one since I still feel a twinge of guilt for her actions and I can't find the one she ""borrowed"".

As the North strip continues to evolve I hope the Peppermill will continue its quest to just do what it has always done and do well. Awesome food, campy decor and Las Vegas personality. It knows who it is.",BECa1cML2FEZ59m188bN6g,0,1,5,T2vrJQSXtFg8-eBQ8nvbfg

1905469,2014-03-14,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Was introduced to this place by a friend and we all decided to check it out as a group for brunch. 

Upon stepping into the entrance, slot machines on the left are one of your first sights, very Vegas indeed. The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.

Since I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day. 

My cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try. 

My boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill. 

Finally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love. 

Overall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person.

we went here because the guy at the wynn said this place had good burgers for cheap, and girls walking around in mini skirts.

he was 2 for 2.

the only problem with it was it was just a tad too ghetto for my taste. im not an elitist, hell im not even yelp elite, but still it was just a bit down in the dumps. although i will give it credit, the girls working there were very hot, and the milkshakes were bomb.

we thought our waitress was really cute and wanted to hit on her a bit, so we thought it would be a good idea if we asked about milkshakes. my first friend was in love with this girl and wanted to talk to her, so when she walked up it went like this.

friend 1 (who was in love with her): silence
friend 2: um so we wanted to ask you about the milkshakes
me: uh yeah what flavors do you have?
waitress: strawberry vanila and chocolate
friend 1: silence
friend 2: ok so we have a question. we want to split a milkshake, but we dont want to seem, how do we say this, um, uh, homosexual per say. so which would you think is hotter, one milkshake with 3 straws, or 3 separate glasses
waitress (laughing): whatever you want babe
me: well after that we are def. not getting the pink strawberry


it was only after that we noticed a ring on her finger (she was still young like 24). my first friend said he called an audible, but either way it was a solid swing and a miss.

Now arguing is 1 thing but this fool made the woman cry, she ran into the bathroom, he chased her in there and the continued to argue and berate her back at the table.
So to the pretty lol blonde with the person of unknown color boyfriend with the Trump misogynist complex, I am truly sorry I didn't speak up and stop his foolishness earlier, I try and stay out of people's affairs but your crying, the berating and disrespect had become enough.

First off, the atmosphere/decor is definitely out of the ordinary and most likely inspired from a nightclub/strip club.. Disco ball glass, Cherry Blossom Trees and Neon Lights.. Interesting and totally Vegas!

What will make me come back again and again:

Southern Fried Steak: This was the Best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had! Crispy, Crispy Chicken Breading, Good Thickness, Tender and So Flavorful!! The gravy was Great and just made it even better! It came with Some of the Best Hash Browns I've ever had!! Yes, this plate was a Double Whammy!! The Hash had the typical string/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. To Top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!! 

French Toast: Another Generous Dish that came with 6 Fat 1/2Slices of Texas Toast that were Frenched up Correctly! Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! Traditional and Executed Right! 

Marinated Pork Chops: Came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. Egg whites were Great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the Bagel was massive and Satisfying (No, Einstein Bagel but it did the job).

Dined here twice now, within a week and this place isn't around the block.. Hint, Hint.. Service both times were Flawless.. Veteran Servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it..

The Peppermill is a dinner slash lounge and when I first moved here in my hey days friends and family always suggested The Peppermill as a late night hang out or a cool place to grab food and more drinks after a long night out. They might have been a bit on the drunk side every time they were there though lol. Anyhow fast forward about 10 years later a wife and 2 kids later life was totally different and friends too now have families of their own.

After numerous try's to eat here for breakfast with families from out of town has been unsuccessful I finally got that break. A friend and his wife and kid was visiting and after a night of taking our kids to the Nostalgic Circus Circus we ran out of options places to eat and then  I remember THE PEPPERMILL so there we headed. We get there and the parking lot was quit bare and I am celebrating at this point. 

Walking in we were all excited for this experience and couldn't wait to see what was in store. Like another fellow Yelper said inside of the Peppermill totally gives off a Strip club vibe which was a bit funny because we had our 1 to 3 year olds with us. Note that even though it is a lounge on one side it is a totally kid friendly place with a kids menu at that. We were seat fairly quickly and food came out at a reasonable time. Though it was not that busy. Service was friendly and food came out in big portions. All the food options on the menu sounded super good and they came out pretty good but nothing over-the-top. It is a diner and I'm sure if I was out all night drinking and partying the food portion and flavor would be on point, but I wasn't so I am a little bit more critical. The food sizes were amazing and I can completely appreciate that but the taste was only a couple steps up from your typical Dennys. 

Never the less we had a good time Anderson enjoyed our food. I will totally be back but if there is a wait what so ever I won't be waiting in that line.

Green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. The salsa also had no flavor. Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their ""girly"" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town).",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,1,1,3,-bA1KDpR7htfIpk1IhlNfA

The food is great here. I can count the number of BLT's I've liked in my life on one hand and the BLTA (avocado) at the Peppermil is one of them.  I get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  Fruit cups.  How many of us sigh at the fruit cup option?  They always suck, right?  Not here! The Peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  Yum!  Love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love the Reuben.

We had breakfast. My husband got the pancakes and they were three enormous cakes that even he couldn't finish. (He ate the three pound Big Daddy Luke burger - but that's another review!)

It's that awesome fireside lounge. If it's not busy you can get a seat right infront of the fire. If not, it's not so bad either, you can curl up on the couches and watch random music videos while nursing a bloody mary all night.

We went to the fireside lounge and I immediately fell in love with the decor and ambiance of the fireside lounge.   Then I ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever I go to Vegas.  So, when I was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, EVERYWHERE we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  I had to keep it cheap.  I thought of Peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong!!!!  They had a catering menu that topped ALL the other menus I had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28/ plate catering menu.  They asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  So I didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  I was in touch with a woman named Peggy Orth the entire time, and she made everything even EASIER!  She was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  This is all leading up to my big day.   So the day comes.  They had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  All of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and EVERYBODY loved the lounge as much as I did.  Our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  The staff made sure my husband and I had our own ""wedding"" table and made us feel like royalty.  Peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  And that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there.
Peppermill is on my official list of All-time favorite places in the world!!!  Everyone from the wedding still talks about how awesome a choice the Peppermill was!!!",Ap5mOXGwDDnH5acxLpnSpw,0,0,5,9h1G6edxY_nIAf58JwWKnw

First of all, man! This place gets crowded. If you can, head straight for the counter for immediate seating. Otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time of day/night you're trying to get your grub on.)

Menu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. The Peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. And the portions are pretty big. Hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.

I opted for the eggs Benedict. My waitress uttered ""good choice"" when I ordered, so I expected something fabulous. What I got was .. eggs Benedict. Hey, poached eggs aren't exactly easy to get perfect, so I give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs with just the right amount of runny yolk. Other than that .. pretty standard. You do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. Add your own salt and pepper and/or Tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.

Oh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. The idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me.

I was back there this past weekend, and I asked my friend where she wanted to go for dinner...she didn't care.  Since we had a car this time I suggested Ellis Island, or Peppermill.  She's not much of a beer drinker, so I thought she'd like the ambiance in this place better so we stopped in again.  There is lots of parking in the lot here.  This place has a 70's roller disco kind of vibe to it... it's cute, totally not cheezy!  VERY ""Vegas"" I might add.

I was staying with a friend at the Riviera during RollerCon 2011, and after a day chock full of roller derby, we were exhausted and starving. We headed over to this restaurant that was close to our hotel, and after a short wait we were seated in this kitschy wonderland. There were so many things on the menu that sounded delicious that it took me awhile to decide what to order. I ended up choosing the french toast ambrosia, and it....was....AMAZING. When I read ""topped with seasonal fruit"", I thought there would be a few strawberries or something on top of my french toast. No, it was a platter full of french toast absolutely slathered in whipped cream, blueberries, blackberries, bananas, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew. It doesn't get any better than that, folks.

As others have said, the food is good, no matter what you order, and the portions are huge! The fruit plate, for instance, is large enough for 2 or more people. I love the ambiance of the neon lighting, the fake cherry trees, and the friendly staff. It's just so Vegas!  The cocktail waitresses wear these long, flowing black dresses and come into the restaurant from the lounge to take your drink orders. If you want to really get crazy with the drinks, order a Scorpion...it comes in a huge bowl with straws and is meant to be shared! You gotta see it to believe it! I shared one with my nephew and his wife and it was amazing. 

The Fireside Lounge is a trip all by itself. It looks to me like something out of the 1970's: shag carpeting, and a main sunken seating area around a flaming fountain. There are video screens everywhere showing music videos.  I have come here numerous times on dates, with friends, after photo shoots, etc. Just kicked back and had a drink (or two or three) and ordered appetizers. Again, love those friendly, attentive cocktail waitresses dressed in classy black!

2016035,2016-10-06,29,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Put this on the very top of the ""Don't Know WTF I Was Thinking"" List. Way back in the day, during my first trips to Vegas, back when I was really young and didn't know any better, I thought The Peppermill was one of the coolest places everrrrrr! Some guy took me here and I remember being so impressed. He had arranged for us to sit at one of those nice romantic, sunken-in fireplace areas and was acting like he had to pull some major strings to get us sat there but was able to pull it off because he was some big shot Vegas local, yada yada yada... I can almost hear my old self saying, ""Oh my gosh, you mean they have actual fireplaces in there and we can sit next to them? WOW!!!!!"" I seriously must have been easily amused and/or completely wasted because this place is proof that some things are better left in the past as memories...

I can't believe I was in such awe of The Peppermill back in the day. *SMDH* Boy times have changed! I walked in after having talked about how cool I remembered this place being and I was instantly embarrassed. My friend gave me that, ""Really Bobbi? This is THE Peppermill?"" puzzled look. Sadly, it was nowhere near as cool as I had remembered it being. The design is completely old school and tacky as all get out by today's standards. There are mirrors everywhere (I think even on the ceilings... bowmp chicka wow wow) and tons of neon. It reminded me of a scene out of the video game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards. Nate M. said it best, ""Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics?"" I could not stop giggling about the cheesy decor and for that I give this place three stars, for the entertainment value alone. I had a blast laughing at my past self while reading other's perceptions of this place. 

This is your basic diner/greasy spoon restaurant that is open 24/7. Yes, The Peppermill is pretty famous but the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking to feel like you've time warped into a scene from Austin Powers or people watch, this is the place. They serve those big touristy fishbowl style drinks that you can share with multiple straws. Service was good. 

Dress like Larry from Three's Company and take someone on a date here and with a straight face, spritz some breath spray into your mouth, lean over and tell them this is your favorite restaurant, I dare you. LOLZ!",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,21,25,3,8kjJtAS2UGpIChsMB1r8gw

We went for breakfast before we hit the road to go back home.  I ordered pancakes.  The waitress advised a short stack because she said they're kind of big.  She wasn't kidding.  The 2 pancakes overflowed the big plate!  That said- the actual quality of the food was left something to be desired.  The huge pancakes tasted a little cardboardy.  In addition the service wasn't so friendly- maybe it was too early in the moring.   Maybe we'll give it a second chance when we go back to vegas.

I got an invite from one of my gal pals who had come down for the Viva Las Vegas convention in Vegas. We loaded up a couple of cars and headed out to have dinner at a fancy restaurant that was seen in a couple of epic movies. I honestly was expecting an old formerly fashionable diner. 

We are driving by and I am aaamazed by the fancy classic neon lights outside. We step in and I am speechless...I talk a lot so it's kinda hard for this to happen to me. 
 
This restaurant contains all of the old classic Vegas glamour that you'd expect in the movies. It was like I had stepped into a scene of a classic movie. We put our names in for a table and we go into the bar to get drinks while our table gets set up. I was expecting, a bar with a couple of stools. To my amazement...we walked into neon dreams and magic mirrors! To top it off, there was a section in the bar with a mini pool that was on FIRE!

The servers and staff were all super friendly and amazing. We managed to order one round of drinks before our table was ready. 

We get seated on a giant table and the giant menu makes it super hard to pick a meal. I went for a chicken sandwich with fries. My heart really wanted some shortcake with ice cream. It was late and I needed to eat food and dessert wasn't going to cut it. 

Our food starts coming out and the portions are huuuuge! My fries were so super tasty, it's like they had some kind of magical breading on them. The chicken in my sandwich was perfectly cooked. I was able to eat half of my food and I got the rest to-go.

I was really hoping that we'd be able to come back for dinner on another day. Peppermill. we will see each other another day!",VZpfPFK1Td5GMMFz-4l1jg,0,0,5,ZIB5dx8r_kyWvCMOT0lnGg

This is old school Vegas with all it's gaudy lights and style. The fireside pit was definitely a place I feel I can get Day Drunk at. The fireside pit was separated from the main restaurant. If you installed a few poles and threw in some strippers, it will look EXACTLY like a strip club. It's dark and the seats were definitely strip club-esque. 

Anyhow, we ordered this fishbowl drink (supposedly their signature drink) that we saw being served at another table while waiting for our table at the fireside pit. It was about 18 dollars and enough for 2 people to share because it was huge. It was also quite a tasty drink. Thumbs up.

We also split an omelet, which came with a side of hash browns. Both were decent. Nothing particularly good or bad to say here. 

The reason I'm such a fan is the fact that it's open 24 hours, the old school Vegas feel, and a photographer even came by to take our picture and print out a free postcard for us!",men42e6XlJo8xSA1p1KMsg,1,0,5,Ru67Y2_zJI70fN_djVibHw

The trashy specialty cocktails are humorous and I usually order one just to get in the Las Vegas spirit (I had the Bacardi O Dreamsicle last time). I recommend coming here for drinks and appetizers - the infamous fireside lounge is the coolest part of the building, if you can get a spot in there.

2023603,2010-11-30,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I waiver between 4 and 5 stars on this. I'm at about a 3.5 to 4 for the Peppermill Restaurant and a solid 5 for the Fireside Lounge.

Let's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of ""old Vegas"". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.

The Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled ""Fireside Lounge"". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.

To your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.

On corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.

The best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.

Combine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.

And I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.

So on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints. 

The portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.

The multicolored table sugar was a fun touch.

We were seated promptly and service was great from our waitress and our cocktail waitress.

House chardonnay was decent (happy hour half price makes it taste better).  The gyro meat was straight from a restaurant supply house, but it satisfied my hankering for some lamb. Curly and regular fries were nice and crispy.  We also shared a banana split which came complete with chocolate syrup, peanuts, and cherries.  Again, nothing special but it was exactly what you picture when you think of a banana split.  A couple of girls sitting nearby took a selfie (or two or three or 500) with their Bloody Marys.  They looked like classic Marys with a celery and cucumber garnish.

They're not reinventing the wheel here, but they have solid versions of classic food with a really fun atmosphere ripe for people watching.

2072166,2013-08-15,3,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I was looking for a restaurant that wasn't a chain restaurant, buffet, or an overpriced restaurant inside the casino.  Using Yelp! app, I came across The Peppermill.

The decor is very unique.  There's a lot of neon lights, mirrored ceilings, and fake trees.  I didn't see the fireside lounge because the wait was a mere 5 minutes to be seated.  The place was fairly busy, so service was not very fast, but you can't blame the servers for that.

I asked for a recommendation and our server suggested Munch's Breakfast.  Sausage with peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, topped with eggs and cheese?  Sounds great!  I was excited.  The meal came out and it felt like it was missing something.  It felt like I was eating a vegetable omelette - I realized that there was NO sausage.  I called the server over - not the easiest task when she's running around tending to many tables - and she said asked if I wanted to have them remake it.  I told her no since the person I came with was almost done with her meal.  She later brought out a plate of sausages.  Apparently the prep cook forgot to bring out the sausages and the cook just threw everything together not realizing that the sausage wasn't there.

I realize that mistakes happen and it wasn't the server's fault so I didn't tip her less than I would have for the service.  But I wish she addressed this with management so that they could have made some sort of adjustment for leaving out the sausage.  Seriously, that's like giving someone a car without brakes.  A chair with no legs.  A hooker with no condom.  All of the above may work but leads to an incomplete and potentially regretable experience.

So while I would probably have given this place 4 stars, I have to give it 3.  Give it a shot, but realize that the cook may be high and leave out key ingredients.",JK8aciYyHaMgukO1hc5RZA,2,0,3,hG9GbfyCve-s09GIZ4p6hg

2081006,2015-10-15,2,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Ahh the Peppermill, known for its 80's themed decor, with neon lights and colored sugar sprinkles. I have been to the Peppermill a couple times in the past few months only because I had friends in town. This isn't the type of place to hang out at often because it is pricey. The first time I was there for food, my friends and I were seated at a round half couch table in the back. It was very hard for me to get comfortable because the table is cemented to the ground so there is no way to get extra room. It was a snug fit. Next time I would ask to be sat at a table with chairs. Anyway to eat I ordered the chicken fingers platter, with fries, and my friends ordered a sandwich and french toast. The food came out quickly, they were not busy at all. I enjoyed my food, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs as well. The portions were hearty and the price was reasonable.

The next time I had friends come to town, we stopped here to check out the Fireside Lounge and get some drinks. The lounge is inside the Peppermill on the left, and is for the 21+ crowd only. It has plenty of seating, as well as a fire pit with some comfy couches surrounding it. We sat around the pit, and ordered drinks from the happy hour menu. Dirty martini's were only $4.50 each, and we also ordered mozzarella sticks which were like $6 something. The drinks were very good, but the mozz stix sucked. The ranch was BOMB though. This definitely is not the place to make as your local watering hole, but it is cool to stop in once when friends are in town.

One thing to note is there are NO prices on the regular menu at all for drinks. They have a lot of speciality drinks, with different syrups and add-ins, but again NO pricing, so you have to assume they are $$$$.

Super old school Vegas feel with lots of glass/crystal, velvet booths, actual cocktail waitresses, and plenty of neon lights. This place has quite the reputation, not to mention is super popular, so if you're planning a visit be sure to make a reservation. Even if you don't think you'll need one, you're going to need one. Wait times range from a half hour to multiple hours (during peak times). 

When you first walk in, you're greeted by slot machines, dimmed lights, and plenty of neon and rich purple. Hopefully you've made a reservation so you can inform the hostess that your party as arrived (and not that you're here to simply wait an hour for a table, because that is simply torture). She'll escort you to a plush booth where you'll take a seat and she'll let you know your server and cocktail waitress will arrive shortly. The cocktail waitress will arrive first and ask for you drink orders. Customary to Vegas, they have a huge selection of very large, very obnoxious alcoholic beverages. They do have a full bar as well if that isn't really your style. Did I mention she'll likely be dressed in old school Vegas glam? Next, your server arrives and asks for your order. This might take a minute because their menu is HUGE with so much variety. After changing your mind, four times, five time, six times okay closing the menu now... you'll tell the waitress your selection!   

The food is then quick to arrive and you will be blown away by the taste and not to mention the large portion sizes. You'll try to devour it all because it's so good, but that won't be possible. Fortunately the server will offer you a box so you can enjoy this the next day too. You'll then HAVE to make room for dessert because they have an overwhelming huge (and yummy) brownie sundae that is larger than your head. Again you'll try to devour it all, but it simply won't happen.

John Travolta in his disco dancing clothes dancing up and down the isles while groupies are in their roller skates in skimpy shorts and crop tops rolling down the walkways. The bright blue, red, and purple neon lights reflecting from the mosaic mirror ceilings and interior trees separating patrons booths give this place some pimpish flare. 

In another room is the Fireside Lounge, a sunken area with a fireplace in the middle (now tvs) where you'll find the likes of Chuck Norris in oversized sunglasses on one side and Barry Manilow on the other chicks on each arm drinking a Fuzzy Navel and a Blue Hawaiian that matches their butt-tight groovy threads. Tatu from Fantasy Island is pointing at the disco ball saying.. De plane.. de plane!

The food here is average fare. It's all about quantity here with average quality. Breakfast is served all day. Go ahead and be a kid and eat pancakes for dinner.
The pancakes here are huge. They're bigger than your face big! The quality, however, is sub par. It's too starchy. I prefer IHOP compared to the pancakes here.

As we were driving up Las Vegas boulevard, I could see the sign for the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge. It was a bright beacon on an otherwise gloomy day. The Peppermill used to be my grandma's favorite place to go back in the day, but I digress. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.

We arrived about 3:30ish on Saturday afternoon. We had a 7 p.m. reservation at Rao's so we had time to kill. The room was pretty much empty with the exception of the section of seats that surrounded the fire pit. We found a nice big lounge area and the 3 of us parked ourselves for some drinks. The decor is a trip. Lots of neon and mirrors, but to me, it is old Vegas and with the untimely departure of the Rivera that used to stand next door, old Vegas is hard to hold on to.

Crystal was our server and was prompt at arriving at our table when we sat down. I ordered my usual Maker's Mark Manhattan, and the other two gents with me ordered a Martini and a beer. We enjoyed ourselves for s few hours as Crystal was always stopping by to check on us and make sure our drinks were good. After all was said and done for 3 Martinis, 3 Manhattans, and 2 beers, our total came out to a little over $60 which wasn't bad.

I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. 

Oh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.

The chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?

I was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.

We had no idea we would be so disappointed.

I asked another patron about the wait who advised it was at least 15 minutes. Once at the front of the line a friend and I waited patiently for the hostess to acknowledge us. After about 10 minutes, were still not acknowledged. However, a female patron approached the hostess while we were standing there waiting and she was acknowledged. I guess I was born the wrong sex. The hostess proceeded to ask the woman her name and party size. Before the woman could respond my friend spoke up and stated that we had been waiting to be put on the list for some time now, he stated his name and our party size.

The hostess then stared at us in a rude manner, as if we did something wrong. We patiently waited for her to acknowledge us but we had to be the ones to initiate the communication to be added to the list and seated.

After waiting 30 minutes, our party of five was seated in the dining area. The server greeted us and delivered 3 waters to our table. Keep in mind, It was 98 degrees outside, a little warm in the room and we had a party of 5. We advised our server multiple times that we needed two more waters to accommodate our party of five. The server then immediately blamed the busboy. We were not trying to be confrontational, we just wanted 5 waters as we had a party of 5. Eventually after asking multiple servers and busboys we got the two remaining waters which took way too long.

Upon resolving the initial hostess and water issue, we were approached by a bar attendant. The attendant asked us if we would like to order any alcoholic beverages, we replied Yes. 

I ordered a Pina Colada. When my drink arrived, I took one sip and instantly experienced a taste that reminded me of sour milk. After taking a sip of the unsettling beverage I called over the waitress.

I explained my concerns with the drink, she then advised me that the drink could not be exchanged but they could attempt to fix the sour taste. She stated that there was nothing she could do and sent over a manager.

The manager, I believe her name was Peggy advised me that they could only attempt to fix the drink and could not make me anything different in exchange. She then chuckled as she said ""You knew what it would taste like"". I replied, I have never had a Pine Colada taste like sour milk. She then said she would be removing the drink from my bill, but wasn't very nice. I guess I was supposed to just deal with the taste of sour milk in the prepared Pina Colada.

After getting that issue resolved our server delivered our food, but failed to accommodate our condiment request. We made six different request for syrup and by the time it was delivered our French toast and waffles were cold. In addition, three of our meals came with muffins which we did not get until we were ready to leave almost 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had and will never forget the treatment we received.

Overall, the food was ok, but it came out late and incomplete. I felt totally insulted by the manager who chuckled as she said ""You knew what it would taste like"" in regards to the Pina Colada. I've had many Pina Coladas and they've never tasted like sour milk or resulted in a stomach ache. I almost feel like there was malice behind it tasting the way it did, and that's unacceptable! 

I felt discriminated against when trying to be seated, as me and my party was overlooked by the host, but other parties were helped. 3 parties that arrived after us were seated before us to be exact. Not to forget about the attitude we received when we initiated the communication to be seated. As a restaurant goer, I am totally disappointed in The Peppermill Lounge and will make it my business never to return to this establishment. I will also spread the word to family and friends.

In addition my friends who also bought alcoholic beverages stated the drinks had a weird taste. They also wanted to return there drinks but due to the managers comment they just paid for them without drinking them.",0gwO73nKtF7iAD9dmsZK7A,11,0,1,etVRvSLCEvJft5VRx77pBQ

my only qualm about this place is the crazy wait! I think because this place is so hyped up and the food is good, more people tend to gravitate at the usual meal times.

It arrived very quickly.

However, it did took a little while for me to be served or noticed by the waitstaff. Moreover, they were very slow in clearing the table.

definitely unusual décor... I don't really even know how to describe it ... sort of like mid century design... 80's-90's color palette ... steakhouse meets juke joint breakfast diner? 
But I do have to say the atmosphere was great.
As I said, it was busy. We were quoted a wait time of 25 mins and were seated in probably 10. the greeter sat us and Jen (our server) got our drinks. She did not forget to check back on us in a timely fashion after we said we needed time to look at the menu even though she was pretty swamped with tables.  AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal. 
The cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee! 
I might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding. 
So instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food! 
My GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side... I did sneak a few of these and can say they were great ESPECIALLY with the house ranch sauce. 
Good thing I walked about 5 miles of the strip after we ate!
I must say though that even after walking a LOT I was full until dinner time.",j4tYYqkWb42AUFhti5L6HQ,0,0,4,tDkRj6M-NvfUXneN0rFsMA

See HBO Weight of a Nation for a compelling and devastating account of this epidemic. 

That said, the food is tremendous. I sat at the counter alone, waiting for a new friend to pick me up on the day of the marathon (which never came to pass due to the 2-10PM closure of the Strip). I recommend sitting at the counter whether you are alone or with one other person. 

The grilled chicken salad with a half avocado is enough to feed a family of four. They have salads, sandwiches (the club sandwich was beautiful), omelets made with 12 eggs (Maserati is popular) and onion rings which looked life-changing. 

Everything is fresh and beautifully prepared. 

Service is great but be prepared for 30 or more minute wait for lunch or breakfast. 

For those watching bill, this is a great choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner . It's open 24 hours and serves three meals all day. 

They have silly tropical cocktails which I didn't try. 

I was a bit adventurous and tried a salad with pear-cilantro vinaigrette which I didn't like. It was far too sweet. The chicken and blue cheese very good but I was in agonizing pain from being out with my luggage and unable to reach Vdara. 

It reminds me a bit of Esau's in Santa Barbara at roughly the same price point.

Still have found memories of that part of the strip so underdeveloped. All of sudden see small strip mall and all these neon lights. Not just lights talk about vibrant colors and ones that flash in and out. I remember the sign out front had even more personality but notice thats gone. =( Thankfully the restaurant still stands. It almost landmark of sorts knowing the history of the place combine with some of that Vegas style all its own. Really who would think place big fire pit right in the middle of the bar/lounge right next too the restaurant. Someone walking around asking if you want free pictures with The Peppermill as background. The diner style food breakfast, lunch, or dinner at anytime. The bright colors the waitress have on. Too all the trees (think fake) inside makes you feel like walked into another world. NO disneyland but one of those things see Vegas could drum up and pull off. 

I ended up getting the maserati omelette. Not like motherload of omelettte. It was smothered with lot of goodies. The best part was the meat sauce over the top of it combine with the egg and loaded filling. I barely finish half of it. It came with tasty hash browns. I enjoyed most was the nice crispy brown on the outside but yet moist on the inside. Along with your omelette get choice of bread or muffin. I went with the blueberry muffin. Nothing too rave about but still was good. Again huge muffin. My friend also had omelette. Seeing twins just as big. No doubt getting value on the strip here at The Peppermill.

The enormous cup of coffee set in front of my partner was setting the bar for what was to come.  The service was a bit quick and abrupt, my partner actually made a comment about trying to find something a little less filling and I think the waitress said something like, ""Well this is all we got"" or something to that nature, but it was more along the lines of funny than it was rude.

The Peppermill is always really clean and fast but sometimes it seems like the servers disappear for very,very long periods of time which is the only reason why i cant give them 5 stars. I have been going there since 2013 and i cant think of a single instance that we didnt have to wait a very long time for a drink refill. From the first time when i went there for a lunch date, the place was empty but still a long wait, to the time i went with 15 people for a work outing, the servers did lag.

If I lived in Vegas I would be here probably too much for their larger than life plates, cheesy- tacky yet cool Paradise style Vegas decor and for the convenience of great service 24hrs a day. 

After the Yelpeasy party I was quite starving so we made a pit stop to the Peppermill for some late night grub. I was craving breakfast and I had a huge selection to choose from. After much convincing from our server Nick (who was quite awesome btw) I went for the Maserati Omelet. Filled with mozzarella cheese and sauteed mushrooms and then topped with an Italian sausage marinara sauce. This is totally not the type of thing I would order but I am so glad I did as it was pretty stellar. 

Our bfast portions were beyond huge. I think it was advertised as a 3 egg omelet but there had to be at least 5 eggs or they get their eggs from pretty large chickens if not. 

Nick was our server and he was great! Service was great all around from the hostess, to the guy who took our drink order and to the cocktail server. Will totally return here next time in Vegas and needed some late night Vegasy eats.",0wYuREI8lQncPuDw5ztWIA,9,9,4,kKKg6_GncEXhKMicTQMp_Q

The omelette was very, very big... too big for me to finish.  Full of flavor including the home made breakfast potatoes.  The service was quite prompts, even when a friend stopped in to join me at the last minute.   My tummy was very content after leaving and hitting the shops later.

Solid breakfast joint with a cool atmosphere. When visiting Vegas, my friend and I were told Peppermill was a place we had to go while in town, so we made the trip over from The Strip for breakfast.

The restaurant itself is really different, but in a good way. Interesting lighting and decor. It's very much a diner but with the feel of a lounge. Quintessentially Las Vegas, for sure.

My friend had a french toast dish which was massive. She wan't able to finish it but she loved the food. I ended up only ordering a small plate of scrambled egg whites - I wasn't particularly hungry - and those were good as well.

Really cool unique diner. I would return the next time in Vegas, this time when I'm hungry so I can really try the menu.",HFWckxypPmpvmWMURRo1rA,2,2,4,e7T6L5VO25WSy2qoHyT47A

Got us a well done steak instead of medium well. The waitress was pleasant and apologetic and said manger will be right over when asked it to be redone. The manager there did not even come up to the table. Instead walked half way and turned around. I guess we scared him. Took them over 40 minutes (yes I was timing them) took get the food made to order. The waitress apologized and said that we won't be charged. But instead was charged for it and said the manager decided not to charge us for the ""second steak""!! Wow!! How sweet of him not to charge us for what was a piece of jerky!!  If you charge $20 for breakfast food, it's your responsibility to make sure it's cooked correctly!! 

When we do come to vegas we always make sure we eat here. But never again are we coming back here especially after this horrible experience. Very very slow service.

The atmosphere is unique....unique in a way that reminds me of the Stardust days and vintage Vegas. Their menu even says ""some things are better left unchanged"" and when it comes to what they do at The Peppermill, they're right! They don't need to change a thing and if they ever did, it may be the worst move ever.

The menu is extensive, and the portions are LARGE and i mean LARGE. It's done on purpose to replicate what Vegas used to do before greed by the ""big guys"" set in. The food is pretty awe-inspiring, and seemed pretty robust in quality. The ambiance alone gets the 5-stars.

If you go to Vegas and don't try the Peppermill, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice and it may even result it a display of your own penitence.

The nachos were basic, made with real cheese, olives, jalapeños. It also came with a side of beans and the canned type cheese mixed together.  I probably would not order it again.  The fettuccine was surprisingly good.  Added a little pepper then it was better.   It also came with a Caesar salad which was fine and two pieces  of garlic bread.

The only thing I didn't like is they have cocktail waitresses who bring alcohol rather than your waiter. The first night we went, we had no problems getting drinks. However, the last day, our waitress kept saying she would send the cocktail waitress but she never came.

I am a sucker for breakfast foods, so I always seem to go for the fruity french toast. However the last time I shared a philly cheesesteak (which was great by the way!) and the nachos.

That thing you can share with 5+ people! Between the two of us, we didn't even make a dent. Our server boxed it all up for us and it still took two to-go containers! There is also a photographer that comes by to all the tables and offers you a complimentary picture. We passed on the picture, but next time I might have to prom pose with my gigantic stack of pancakes! *swoon*

We actually were looking for places around the Westgate and found this place on Yelp that was highly recommended, so we decided to give it a try!  It is located by the Riviera & Circus Circus on the strip, so people are able to walk off their food afterwards because there is a lot of food coming your way!!!  

1. Be prepared to wait-Giving any place in Vegas that is good and that does not have a reservation option, be prepared to wait.  There is not much seating areas up front so they will offer the lounge area to wait (highly recommended!) but usually everyone is waiting outside.

2. There are large booths & typical bar seating-There is plenty of room to sit and the decor is straight up vegas style!  If I blinked twice I would have thought I was in a party bus with trees!  I loved the seating arrangement and everyone was in a good mood and can easily talk to the booth next to you!

3. Waitresses were awesome (both times!) They let you know what is great on the menu and I did get everything in a timely manner...even though they were slammed!

4. Food for Days- For the first round, I received the breakfast pancake platter and the size of everything is incredibly huge!  You pay around 13-14 dollars, but it is worth it (especially if your hotel room has a fridge, you will have leftovers!)  The second round I got the French Toast Ambrosia...this I highly recommend!! French Toast with a whole bunch of ""fresh"" fruit on top smothered in whipped cream (if you want) with blueberry sauce!!! YUUUMMM!

Your world is starting to spin and you need some food to keep functioning (and to ensure you don't puke or OD). You stumble into a Denny's and you are blown away by weird neon colors, friendly service, and good food at great prices featuring out of this world portions. You are so amazed by the experience you feel you as if you are dreaming, high, or both.

Well, the paragraph above pretty much describes my recent experience(s) at the Peppermill, except that I was not on a Charlie Sheen style bender. Even stone cold sober and pissing holy water, I was amazed by the food, service, and of course, the neon colored look and feel of the place.

After a long day of traveling and working, I came here for dinner and had a delicious half pound burger with grilled mushrooms, Swiss cheese, crispy bacon, fresh produce featuring onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a delicious dill pickle that Snookie would salivate over. With my entree, I was given the option of a side of fries, curly fries, or onion rings. I opted for the hot and crispy curly fries. And when I say side, I mean a 2,500 calorie mountain.

It was a quality meal and well priced ($16 including tip), considering it was more than enough for two people or maybe even three. But of course, being a nasty pig, I devoured the entire burger and ate as many curly fries as a I could until I felt there was a pimple forming at the end of my nose. 

I was so impressed by the meal and the service, I let my impressive server (who was in training at the time and being shadowed by another server), that I would be back the following day. As I wasn't pulling a Charlie Sheen, the next day I kept my word and returned with my coworker. Word is bond, yo.

This time around, I had a chicken focaccia sandwich filled with thick slices of avocado, prosciutto, provolone cheese, all served a side of Balsamic vinaigrette. The sandwich was delicious. This time around I opted for some tasty onion rings that gave me enough grease on my face to start a fire, a small pimple, and a pair of busted slacks. Whatever. I like being fat. No, really. I swear.

In the end, this has become one of my new favorite places to eat in ""The Vegas,"" even if the food makes my face look young (greasy and pimply) and body look old (round and fat).

When a place is 24 hours and they serve breakfast the whole time, I tend toward breakfast food. That being said, their eggs benedict is one of the best in Las Vegas.

Waitresses are attentive and friendly. There seem to always be cops eating there; take what you will from that. 

Downsides: The place gets crowded. Really crowded. Weeknights seem to be the best time to go if you want to sit down and eat quickly. Also, the parking situation can be difficult.

Tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of Wynn/Encore and south of Riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-Strip or have a car at your disposal. My party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. Hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. All with the requisite dipping accoutrements. So happy. Two of us had the giant pesto burger as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so I'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, I could only eat about half. Good thing I had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.

The atmosphere is as many others say. Like a fully-blown Vegased out version of an all-American diner. Think Denny's with a neon problem. Just lovely and fits the Strip to a tee. Service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.

We stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. Why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. So that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to Vegas.

The cocktail waitress comes separately than the server and our drinks were stiff and fairly priced (for Vegas). A girl taking photos also comes around, and it's the basic drill. You get one photo for free (a souvenir style with your photo placed amongst a collage of the Peppermill) and then you can purchase additional full size photos. As for our food, I truly enjoyed my steak. I asked for medium rare, and it was tasty, but could have used a bit less cooking - I enjoyed it though. Fettuccine was awesome.

Not so now, I had buddies of mine coming into town Friday morning and of course they could not check in to the hotel because it was too early and they were both starving for some food.
I wanted to stay on the strip and suddenly the Peppermill came into my mind, I know they are open 24/7 and they serve breakfast.
So upon arrival (it was around 10am) we rolled up to the Pepermill and were greeted with a 30 min wait time and the reception area was packed with people waiting.  
Then I remembered the lounge out back that serves some of the best Bloody Mary's I can remember having, so off we went to spend our wait time in the lounge.  man I'm glad I did, it was exactly like I remembered it pink and purple neon everywhere and the small water fire pit in the middle....Classic.
Our waitress came and took out orders quickly and then returned with them just as fast, the Bloody Mary was exactly like I remembered them and you get at plethora of choices for your vodka, anyway we had two drinks each while we waited and was then called to our table.
Our waitress gave us ample time to look and order from the menu which I was surprised at seeing as the place was packed, I was  expecting her to rush us and get us out of there.
the portions are HUGE! and can easily be shared, I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs, there must have been a pound of corned beef with a crispy crust and three, yes three fried eggs on top.   
Mmmmm The corned beef was crispy on the outside but once you cut into it, it was moist and creamy then once you cut open one of the eggs and the yolk mixes into the corned beef I was in heaven.
I wish it was closer to my house so I could go more often but for anyone on the strip and bear in mind the Peppermill is located quite far down the north of the strip across from Circus Circus and the old Riviera it is still a must go to for a great meal ANYTIME of the day or night.",srsIW-KsmybstPTbgUpusw,0,0,5,PfWr130vkCaIF-1JsmRBJg

It was only a few blocks walk through the back streets of Vegas. (By that I mean off the strip, for all us tourist folk)  I have been wanting to go there for a while now, and it did not disappoint.
The decor was dark with neon light accents everywhere. Mostly of the blue and pink variety. The bartenders were up there in age, so they knew how to entertain and keep conversation going. I forget the bartenders name that was serving my girlfriend and I, but he was a good time. 
My girl and I ended up finding an open spot at the indoor fire pit so we lounged there for a while. It was interesting... Great for people watching and you get one eclectic crowd walking in and out of there. All sort of race, creed, gender and class. It is now a must go to every time I head to Vegas.
If you are the clubbing/ bar hopping type, its the perfect place to sit with the guys and plan your strategy over some good food and a few drinks. On the other hand, its a great place to just sit after a long night/ morning and well, lounge.",sW9QHMh9ZfIRUhAhDduQ4w,0,0,5,p8n4rE8m18FN18HO5hiNMg

Open 24/7, it exemplifies the glitz and glamour of the old Vegas--garish and all. With everything from the neon lights to the boldly colorful booths and the fluorescent table sugar, this place will make you feel like you've arrived in the city and gone back in time.

Not to mention, it's also one of the best deals on the Strip. For $13.50 you get a lot of food. I'm partial to the omelets, which are huge and come with a hefty portion of hash browns and toast/muffins. My two favorites are the Maserati and the Marco Pollo. 

The hash browns are thicker than any I've ever had. It actually feels like I'm eating pure potatoes--not overly buttered ones.

This place has the classic diner feel, but better food and heartier portions. It's pretty packed, even in the graveyard hours. And every once in awhile you'll catch a famous face sitting at one of the booths.

Our food finally came and we devoured our bacon, sausage, eggs, toast, english muffin and hashbrowns. I was almost angry at how good it was and how it was going to end soon if I kept eating. We got out of the place after about 2hrs - an amount of time unheard of from us, again I'm blaming how busy the place was and slow service.

2523544,2012-07-26,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"This visit to The Peppermill was about a year in the making as an out of town friend had given it 2 thumbs up & suggested we meet there. So I had alot of time to review the extensive menu which covers pretty much the full gamet of what you'd find at a Dennys (Breakfast, Sandwhiches, steaks, fish, burgers, deserts & Full Bar) but more Upscale.

I had also viewed several Youtube videos, one which featured the Mammoth ""SCORPION"" Cocktail ($20) & that pretty much sealed the deal on what I was going to have to drink. The Scorpion came just as it was shown on the vid and was very good wt no hint of any liquor at all which was strange because if you look up the recipe its loaded with alcohol. I am a vodka drinker and I'm guessing it was the 151 in the mix that had me done drinking anything else & sweating bullets towards the end of the visit. It packs a punch.

The Bartender in the Fireside Lounge was very freindly & had a good sense of humor especially when I pretended to have poked my eye out on the long straw that came with the drink and demanded someone call Personal Injury Attorney Glenn Lerner. The Bartender immediatly offered up some scissors to cut the straws to a shorter more manageable length.My accomplice had a glass of White wine ($9.50).

After conversation over our drinks and very hungry, we went into the main dining room and were immediatly seated in a nice out of the way booth in the back that was big enough for a group of 4 so we had pleanty of room to spread out and make ourselves comfortable.

I ordered the 1/2 order of Nachos wt Chicken ($16) and my Partner in Crime had a salad, Shrimp, and steamed green beans ($20) which looked very good and she had no complaints. The Nachos on the other hand were somewhat of a dissappointment. I have definatly had better. The quantity was overwhelming & in fact wt my huge cocktail, could not finish them. My complaint was they had been covered wt white cheese & baked in the oven and the end result was a concrete textured layer covering them. Also there was very little sign of any chicken whatsoever, though we did find a few small pcs upon a close inspection.

 The Nacho's were served wt 2 small cups of sour cream, a chedder cheese sauce & salsa all on the side and was pretty sparse on the other ingredients advertised - tomatoes, blk olives, jalepenos & onions. My expectations were more of a zesty, loose array of all advertised ingredients as I am accustomed  Sort of like a Taco Salad, where one can build each chip as an individual h'orderve. The concrete texture, as well as the limited ingredients, prevented this. Still it was good, but I wouldnt order it again.

The waitress, overall atmospere & company was very nice and based on my experience I would have no problem going back, or reccommending it to others. Go to youtube and see the various vids there. The breakfast dishes look very good as do the burgers. 3 out of 5.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,1,0,3,MUc1tOQRL6rhfEtvWEW7Yg
2525488,2009-11-06,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"If this place doesn't make you think of the swank, bygone days of Vegas where the Rat Pack and the Mob ran the town, nothing will. The interior is romantically dark, but with low, florescent lighting spanning throughout. The mirrors on the walls and ceiling really make you want to rent a kinky hotel room and get it on. The foliage that envelopes the interior adds a lovely exotic touch. The ""tables"" are actually large, low to the ground coffee tables, surrounded by big, squishy couches pushed back against a wall, so everyone gets their own, private grotto. Shall I even begin to talk about the bubbling blue flame pool that you can sit around? Awesome!! 

And let us not forget the drink menu. Typical bars and lounges in Vegas will serve up trendy, funny named drinks where, you have no idea what's in it, but with a name like ""Mouthfuck"", you just HAVE to drink it. Not so at the Fireside. Not only are the cocktails reasonably priced and STRONG, but they're the CLASSIC drinks that you would expect in Vegas. Not only did I recognize all of the drinks on the menu, but there were some drinks that are so classic and vintage that no one my age (25) has ever had them, so they're sort of trendy again. I had my very first Old Fashioned, and then followed that up with my first (of many) Champagne Cocktail. Honestly, Champagne Cocktail is where it's at!!

Then of course is the music. True to old Vegas style, they play Dean, Frank, Sammy, Bing, etc. And then, to appease their younger generation, they play Beyonce, Justin, and whoever else is popular these days. However, the song selection and sound level is hardly offensive; indeed, it's quite mellow and chill, thereby allowing you to suckle upon your champagne cocktail, or other drink of choice, and engage in verbal and social intercourse which might then, if you are lucky, lead to other kinds of intercourse. Really.. this place is friggin awesome.

Between the two of us, we had the Marco Pollo omelet (chicken, spinach, lots of garlic and cheese) with potatoes and a blueberry muffin on the side, and the chicken nachos.

Hits: waffles, steak and eggs, chicken fried steak, eggs benedict 

Misses: corned beef and hash, fried selections (appetizer stuff), mixed fruit 

I hate sharing this place because I know it will just become more popular and in turn busier, but I can't help it!! This place is awesome and I hope they are around for another 40 years!!",lt4l-WFwdbiPuje7zYoOUQ,2,2,4,Jwokat3vSDgzWpJzE8fh5A

2553166,2011-07-27,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"This review is about Fireside Lounge, NOT the Peppermill restaurant.

The staff: Our waitress was friendly.  It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn't wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long ""gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress"".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?

The goods:  I'm not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren't cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend's margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren't bad.  It was really dark, but I'm almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don't think many people come for the food, and if you do, you'll  probably be disappointed.  

The atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It's like Satan's jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of ""greenery"", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you're skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you're lucky, there'll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They're really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.

We went for my going away party and I'm not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn't bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you're looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.  I mean seriously, it's Vegas.",YyGhWvyw6mjJFICgq7rUxg,3,2,3,ZZBngBM4m7Mvl539kA_jxQ

I love this place, in actuality, especially as a last stop on a night that's gone on a little too long when the weather's a little too chilly.  At about 2 AM on such a night, warming oneself at the fire pit with a gigantic plate full of nachos is pretty much an unparalleled delight.

The blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)  The waitresses are always very polite and prompt, and their dresses make me giggle just a little bit.  (Long, black cocktail dresses look somehow out of place and perfectly comfortable there at the same time.)

2572937,2017-09-23,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"My boyfriend and I are waiting for our food right now, and I couldn't wait to write this review. 

I was SO excited to visit Peppermill. It's everything I love: over the top uniforms, kitschy decor, bad music and diner food. We walked in and I was in love. We put our names in, and it was about an hour wait. That's fine, we knew it was popular. We went to the bar and had several Bloody Marys each while we waited. Thankfully our bartender was great and the Marys were alsp excellent, which was the ONLY saving grace in this entire experience. After nearly an hour and 45 minutes of waiting, I went to the podium and asked how long it would be for our party. My exact words were ""I'm sorry, I don't mean to be that person or obnoxious, but could I check on the wait for my table?"" The girls asked my name snd initially couldn't find it, but then I pointed it out at almost the top of the page; it was very easy to see because almost all the other names (a good 20) below mine were scratched out, but mine wasn't. The girls asked me what time I put my name in, I told them right after 1:15. The two hostesses looked at me horrified amd said ""it's almost 3:00!"" I told them yes, I knew, and I was very upset. Then the two girls started arguing ""well, you were putting names in,"" ""but you were the one calling!"" and then turning to me and cooing about the time and telling me it sucked how long we waited. I don't CARE. Fix. The. Problem. 

We were promptly seated at that point, but I asked to speak to a manager. At first, she was very empathetic, but then seemed to lie to my face about what the problem was. I told her what had happened and that I'd wished the girls up front had handled the situation differently (I told her I'd wished they'd just have apologized), and she said she's going to talk to them. Fine. Upon returning, she told me she was the one calling names, remembered calling us, and that she didn't know what happened because the system was messing up. Um, no? For one, the girls told me they were calling the names. Two, my name wasn't scratched off. If you'd even called it, you'd scratch it out if we hadn't come and you cancelled our party. Three, what system? It's handwritten names in a book and a speaker, and we could hear it fine in the bar. Bartender didn't hear our name called, either. So sorry, not buying that bull. She offered us apps but I was over it, I wanted to eat breakfast and leave. 

They expedited our order, and the food was fine. I wasn't expecting spectacular, since I came for the atmosphere. My boyfriend loved his omelette, though. Everyone was nice and all, and the manager comped us and apologized, even going as far as to walk out of the restaurant and wish us a good day. That (along with FINALLY eating) really helped, but still have a bit of a sore spot. We'll see what happens next time in Vegas.",Ne9H3ebmlwR2saEVQ49h6Q,0,0,3,jEpPOvhKrzxV9bOYQcK64g

- my friend's bachelorette weekend in Vegas; this place was suggested to us by one of the cab drivers 
- because we were told this is a classic, the bride had everyone dress pin-up for our meal here

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- in Old Vegas I believe, so farther down the popular area that people frequent on the strip

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- very old school diner throughout the main area; the lounge/bar area with the indoor bonfire was legit though and brought upon a different atmosphere

THE MENU:
- traditional club breakfasts
- Peppermill breakfast favorites
- breakfast sides
- Peppermill omelets
- pancakes and waffles
- appetizers
- soups and salads
- sandwiches
- burgers
- steaks
- entrees
- desserts
- beverages, fruits & cereals
- wine
- beer

WHAT I ORDERED (I can't speak for everyone because I don't recall):
- savory ribeye steak

THE TASTE:
- for the last portion of our trip I was craving steak, so the one I ordered was more than satisfactory

We were not disappointed.  The place will not leave you hungry...and the prices won't leave you broke!

Cooked with Peppers and Onions, and not just completely drowning in Provolone...this was actually one of the best Philly Cheese steak sandwiches I've ever had.

It may not have been even remotely authentic, but DAMN was it good.

The Onion Rings were righteous too.  A little on the greasy side...but who cares?  3 days of eating like a 5 year old were in store for us...

I love the 50's diner look from the outside, the massive portions of virtually anything you can chow down either at a table or at the counter in the restaurant. Nachos are great, huge and perfect for that: ""it's 4am and I need food, stat"" moment; best shared with a friend or 12. Breakfast foods are equally large portions: pancake lovers rave over their stacks; many of my burger loving friends have raved about the burgers. I usually have a gynormous salad, while iceberg isn't my favorite, it is more than adequate here (I never leave without a to-go box) Love that they are open 24/7 and the kitschy decor in the diner. There can be relatively long waits during breakfast hours and at seemingly random times. Worth the wait. Also, it is easy walking distance from many spots on the Strip, so you can walk off some of those drinks/nachos. Recently walked from TI & Bellagio. 

Just the diner side would make this great to this NYer who misses a diner. But then...you walk into the Fireside Lounge and are transported into the 1970's (overheard a man telling his wife ""it looks like a den of iniquity"")  Velvet couches in the round with flat screens playing old school videos, plus the famous floating fireplace add to the unique ambience; there are even matchbooks at your tables. There are gaming spots at bar, if that's your thing. 

Drinks follow the throwback theme along with Mai Tais, Scorpions & other ""Girl Drink Drunk"" offerings (check out classic Kids in the Hall skit on You Tube, riff on Days of Wine and Roses but very Vegas) and unique dessert themed libations. There's frequently a roving photographer to present a memento of what always turns out to be a good time for local and tourists alike. 

The waitresses wear long black cocktail dresses, and do the classic ""Bunny dip"" to place coasters and serve -- reminiscent of the old Playboy Clubs -- there's a decent array of  bar food and appetizers. On my last trip in April we had Caprese Salad (very good) Shrimp Cocktail (a ok) Chicken Quesadillas (really good, very flaky but took forever to come out) and something else I didn't eat but my friend enjoyed it. Drinks are potent, service can be a tad slow, but friendly. Our water glasses were always filled, drinks refreshed and waitress did keep in touch regarding wayward item. 

The people watching alone is worth a visit. Depending on what time you are there, you'll start to see hungry clubbers, hungry/thirsty ""dancers "" and just your variety of only-in-Vegas sightings. From about 3AM on it gets really shall we say, eclectic?' 

So, I'm a fan. Always have been, always will be. It is a cool spot to chow down, get your drink on or snuggle up to your honey. Long live The Peppermill!",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,6,3,4,iyJvUCPYDGJky11bJ1b95A

The Peppermill has been on the north end of the Vegas strip for over thirty years. Many a casino has come and gone in those years but the Peppermill and the adjacent Firseide Lounge has survived.  It is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.
 You don't need to worry about the time of day because the Peppermill is open 24 hours and serves Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner anytime. This makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. For Simone and I, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  After looking over the waitress, I mean menu, I decided to order the Reuben Sandwich and French Fries. Simone decided to go for the Breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a Bran Muffin. My Reuben arrived first and it was massive. In fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of Rye bread. Between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted Swiss and house made thousand island dressing. The kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted Swiss. This was the holy grail of sandwiches and I amazingly finished the entire thing. The fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  Simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . It was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from the day before). Simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. The hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped Simone finish them.  The bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.
The Peppermill is a great experience. Come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  A great Las Vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the Peppermill ****",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,2,0,4,BL8ruFFQ_5h1uq6LS7BRWw

On to breakfast. I had the seafood omelet which had baby shrimp and lump crab meat in it. It was huge and very tasty. The only complaint is that it was a bit lite on the seafood and the hashbrowns that came with it. The egg to filling ratio was a bit off as a result and noticeable. There was also a variety of muffins besides the toast if you so choose. A nice option. My wife had the the taco omelet with hashbrowns. It was also very good.

It's a dark little bar lit mostly with Neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. Instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in July) or roomy booths you can sit in. The atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a Hollywood portrayal of old school Vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. We both found it very comfortable and relaxing. 

The service was fantastic! We never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. She answered questions, was very personable and polite. This was some of the best service we had in Vegas.

We wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the Crab cakes. WOW these were good! They where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! I would highly recommend giving them a try!

We had a couple of their specialty drinks. The Blue Hawaiian, which was our favorite. It was very good, and very blue! We also had the Scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. After we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off. 

One of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. They can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. It gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same. It's just neat to watch it in action.",QIx1kegezE8MHc1TsCBLCw,5,2,5,EBgdndI46ssjOhLnx1H7Tw

I can completely understand how, if you might have had one or nine cocktails, you would think the Peppermill was the shit. With bright neon lights, ginormous portions, and pretty quick service, it is a drinkers dream. I was charmed by the fake cherry trees and our friendly waitress.

Our food, however, was gross. I had the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise sauce, simply put. It was gray and was more like gravy. My English muffin was burnt and I didn't quite understand why I had three poached eggs. BFF had the Joe's Special, which sounded really delicious. We fought over who would order it. It was a mix of scrambled eggs, sausage, some veggies, served over potato skins, with cheese sauce. Sounds delish, but wasn't. The potato skins were just boiled potato chunks and the cheese sauce was bright orange. There was nothing real about that cheese sauce.

When first entering, I could hear the ""Awws"" from the girls as they noted the neon lights, blossoming trees, and ambience inside. Definitely an old-school romantic diner type feel. Got seated at a booth and had a pretty hard time choosing between their menu ranging from Southern fried steak to breakfast foods to pasta. While deciding, we got our picture taken in the booth, whcih we got to keep - cute.

Ended up ordering the following and definitely had to split up to the ginormous portions:

-Seafood omelette: Even split two-ways between Kathleen W. and I wasn't enough to finish this. Filled with shrimp and crab, we wondered how many eggs went in this breakfast monster that could easily take up room in a cake box. Hashbrowns were not as great as I would have liked, but the taste of the omelette was just how I would have wanted it, with a good amount of hollandaise and cheese

-Nachos appetizer: Mound of beans, carne, jalapeno, nachos, and real cheese that you can dip in guac and salsa - basically a heart attack ready to happen, but quite tasty while warm

-Fish n chips: Not gonna lie, these were surprisingly good. Thick slices of cod and curly fries was a total win.

-Mudslide: Delicious with real ice cream in there (much better than the pre-made stuff I usually blend). Girls said they could really taste a lot of alcohol, but I really just enjoyed it like a milkshake

Super filling meal where less than 3 dishes almost exploded our tummies with awesome. A great way to end our Vegas weekend.

What is there left to be said that hasn't already been said in the past 1700+ reviews?

-come hungry. Portions are BIG. Maybe share a couple dishes between your party. You will not leave hungry. Small eaters like myself, I guarantee you will have leftovers for the next day. Or even the day after that.
-this place is always busy. No matter what time of the day it is. So just be prepare that there MAY be a wait.

Very flavorful and my dish came out pippin' hot. Boyfriend had his heart set on the Country Fried Steak dinner. He thoroughly enjoyed it! A lot!

Omelets are huge.  This ain't Denny's or IHOP.  And they're delicious, too.

Sandwiches are all huge.  The burgers are best eaten with a fork, as they are big, piled high with your choice of tasty toppings.  The Focaccia Chicken sandwich is gargantuan with juicy chicken breast, avocado, prosciutto, and melted provolone cheese.  I dare you to eat the whole thing.  

For me the star attraction at Peppermill is the Onion Rings.  I started my cooking career at Howard Johnson's decades ago, and besides being a great place to get ice cream HoJo's made a few things very well that brought customers back.  Onion rings were thickly hand-sliced then dipped in condensed milk, then battered, dipped in condensed milk a second time, then battered again before deep frying.  The results were amazing, and Peppermill's got a good process, too, as their O-Rings brought me right back to HoJo's kitchen in Maple Shade, NJ.

Prices are not cheap, though they are not casino-expensive either.  Any way you look at it, you'll find lots of yummy food, served by good people and fair prices.

SO worth it!  First of all, I think it's probably CRAZY on weekends because we were there on a Wednesday morning and there was a crowd of people... luckily only a 15 minute wait, though.  Perfect timing for us to head into the Fireside Lounge for a Bloody Mary!

The Fireside is AWESOME.  It's so 70s Vegas... all shiny and neon.  There is a big fire and water element in the middle with couches around it in a circle.  Love it.  The Bloody Mary was huge, but not so strong.  I just totally loved the atmosphere and it was nice for us because it was also pretty empty, so we had the fire pit to ourselves.

When they called our names, we were sat in a big booth and ordered our breakfast.  The husband had a French Dip and ordered the fruit as his side and WOW, it was a huge bowl of nice fruit, including a whole cut up banana, strawberries and melons.    Very nice. I was jealous.  I wanted to try a bunch of things so ended up getting scrambled eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy.  It was WAY too much food, so I only ate about a third of it.  The ""three eggs side"" was more like about 5 eggs.  The biscuits and gravy were good, but not great and a huge plate.  I think they should do a smaller version.  I wasn't that fond of the hash browns either.  Only the very top was crunchy and the pieces are just too big for hash browns.  But, otherwise, I enjoyed the food.  

Our server was attentive and the food came out quick.  Cost for food was about $30, but I over ordered.  We really enjoyed our meal and the whole experience.  I definitely recommend a visit to the Peppermill!",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,0,0,4,vB1Vbkyj-9l8LjSxSC-a5Q

I was surrounded by fake plastic trees and hot pink rope lights. I sat where I could overlook the fire pit and was served by a waitress in an evening gown. She and I bonded over making fun of the guy I was with as he asked a billion questions about martinis and I, the chick, just ordered a beer. The alcohol prices, I would soon learn, are pretty much on par with most places in Vegas. They did however have pretty good booze specials that started at either 3 or 4 am ( I cant remember exactly) and ran for a couple hours. I also opted to feast on some nachos.  One order was more than enough for 2 people. Oh, and I know this may not be important to all but I was very impressed that the nachos were clearly layered. By this I mean Chips then cheese then chips then cheese etc.  Not just cheese on the very top of the chips. What can I say? Little things impress the hell out of me.

2716946,2015-11-13,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Peppermill is a fixture on Las Vegas Blvd.  Located just south of the old Rivera Hotel and Casino, it's within walking distance of the casino properties on the north end of the Strip.  I had heard about it for years and they have a website that makes the place look pretty darned cool.  I finally made it there when a relative came into town, was staying on the Strip and wanted to meet us near their hotel. It was the right time to give The Peppermill a try.

Honestly, everything was just okay.  Certainly nothing was bad or wrong, but nothing was better than average.  I was a little surprised.  We went back again several weeks later, but the experience was the same.

The waitstaff did just what waitstaffs do:  seated us, took our order, filled our drinks when they were empty (but didn't keep them from going empty), and brought us our check when we appeared to be finished.  They didn't take too long for anything and didn't rush us either.  Get in, eat, get out.  Average.

The food was average too.  This was disappointing since I had heard so much about The Peppermill before--almost all very positive.  I don't even remember what I had the first time, and I rarely forget what I order at a place the first time I'm there.  The second time I ordered the Southwestern Beef Kabobs.  They tasted fine, but were overcooked and dry as a result.  I'm pretty sure they sat under a heating lamp while the other dishes were being prepared since the vegetables were also dry.  Again, not bad, but not really great either.  I'd expect this kind of food in a roadside diner, not in a fairly well-known restaurant and arguably a feature on the Las Vegas Strip.

The atmosphere is unique but nothing special.  It's certainly a cool change from sitting in another generic restaurant, but it seems they may have once been a special place but have now forgotten they're on The Strip in the middle of a city known for an amazing assortment of all kinds of amazing restaurants and a huge variety of food.  The website make the place look very cool.  Better on the web than in person.  Once again, not bad but not great either.  Just average, and I'm not sure average can survive on The Strip these days.

Parking is super easy:  park right there in front of the restaurant.

I sincerely hope The Peppermill doesn't go the way of the old Sahara and the Riviera.  They could be something great.  (They SHOULD be something great.)  If you're on that part of Las Vegas Blvd and need a decent place to eat, it'll certainly suffice.  But with all the choices within just a few miles, I'd honestly go elsewhere.  There are too many other great restaurants to chose from.  Even though The Peppermill is okay, because they don't seem to care about where they are or what they could be, I can't give it more than two stars.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,2,2,pptvaektABqX4LsoBx2LXw

The staff are extremely attentive and very very nice and welcoming, the wait times aren't ever really that long and the staff does their best to seat you as fast as possible. 

The food here is absolutely amazing and ranges from your breakfast staples like pancakes (which I highly recommend) to dinner favorites like steak or wings. The prices here are also what's a huge selling point for this place as Peppermill really isn't all that pricey despite being a stones throw from the Strip. I ordered the pancakes and got 3 massive pancakes (literally the size of my head), a huge dollop of butter and syrup, 3 pieces of crispy bacon, and a soda all for only around 12 bucks.  Now I do have a small gripe about this place but it isn't enough to ever get me to stop coming. The booths and tables are a bit small so if you have a bigger group you may end up being a bit uncomfortable even in a big booth. Other than that I absolutely love Peppermill and will be returning.",S9dDf0JqSMAvusp5f-9bGw,2,1,5,ihSQaCxoT0vbeBfFXkSr8Q

Chicken fried steak tasted pre-battered, but still good. Service was good as well.

The turkey dinner (seasonal) was actually very good. It wasn't dry at all. Came with a side of stuffing, cranberry jam, mash potatoes with gravy a dinner roll and some veggies.

We also ordered the Soup salad and bread. The chicken soup tasted fresh but the salad wasn't very fresh, some of the leafs were already starting to brown. You are given the choice of Garlic bread or Rosemary. We went with the garlic bread, and I was happy to see that it had cheese on it.

He threw back at me and said ""you better eat all of yours"".  So about half way he gave up I didn't show it but I was done too.

Jaw drop! quite in the restaurant you could hear a pin drop.  The challenge was on!  As i cut through the omelet I could see the layers of tostada, ground beef, guacamole sour cream, lettuce and cheese.  Its warm goodness got me so full so quickly.

The Peppermill is a very odd place. From the outside it does not appear to be anything special. Step inside and you will find a coffee shop that looks like a Denny's on acid. There are blues, purples and pinks everywhere. There are mirrored ceilings, tiffany lamps and faux cherry blossom trees.

The waitresses are wearing very short kimono type shirts/skirts. Making things more bizarre is that there is also a night club in the back that has pools in it that spit out fire on top of the water. Despite all of the craziness, the restaurant is 100% coffee shop in the front.

SERVICE: Everything was right on the money here. There was a delay in bringing my food. Though not a big deal, the manager came over and took a percentage off of the bill without us asking. Everything was very prompt.

FOOD: We ordered breakfast. Their hashbrowns are unique, I have never had ones like it. They were great and I am glad I ordered a plate of them. I could tell that they take great pride in the quality and preparation of all their food. Everything was outstanding. The kids ordered kids plates and loved them. We ate one of their gigantic hot fudge sundaes. The bill was about what you would expect to spend at a Denny's.

My favorite spot in the whole restaurant was the lounge. The sunken fire pit with oversized couches was a great decor. The bad thing is if you drink too much and sit by the fireplace you will definitely pass out from the heat, it was unbearable. I ordered a mimosa and my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary. The drinks were large and filled with alcohol, well worth the money. 

If you eat at this restaurant make sure you order light or plan on sharing. These meals are hearty. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day long.

Based on the jumbo sized portions other Yelpers mentioned, probably to match their jumbo sized booths, the hubby and I shared.  I ordered a small Spinach Salad and he went with the Maserati Omelet.  

While we waited for our food, a photographer came around offering ""free"" pictures.  She came back during our meal with our free postcard picture souvenir and a sales pitch for the larger prints.  It's a nice effort, but a picture in a booth with a window in the background doesn't do it for me...especially for nearly $20 a print!  But I gladly took the freebie.

The omelet was HUGE and served with hashbrowns and an English muffin; the salad was normal sized.  So it was just the right amount of food for the two of us to share.  The omelet was an Italian take eggs filled with sausage, cheese and mushrooms and topped with Italian meat sauce and Parmesan.  It was super fluffy, flavorful and really good.

It's a classic!
The neon lighting to booth style seats in the Fireside area you feel as if you're stepping into a world once been. You would swear you saw Elvis Presley walking through, and not an impersonator.
I've gone to the Peppermill all hours of the day, in all states of intoxication and never once have I been treated poorly. I've always been treated like a rockstar!
The girls on the restaurant side can be a little overwhelmed at times because it's usually slam packed no matter what time of the day you go. I never expect my food to be delivered quickly because it is always slam packed! This doesn't bother me because it allows me the opportunity to go to the Fireside and enjoy a drink. Their prices for drinks versus the portions are absolutely Fair. However, the portions of food you receive are enough to feed a small village in New Guinea. The prices for the portions of food and the flavor of food seem almost cruel because they are so cheap.
If you've never been to the Peppermill, then you've never been to Vegas classic!
Every single kid in my generation has ditched school once and gone to the Peppermill or party all night and gone to the Peppermill for a 6 a.m. breakfast.
Can I think of one bad experience I've ever had at the Peppermill including the food? No, not at all.

If people have bad experiences, I believe their expectations are too high and they don't enjoy the Ambiance for what it's worth.

If you really want to treat yourself, order the French toast.
I would suggest splitting it with somebody if you have a small stomach because it's one of those things where your eyes are bigger than your stomach.

1. 70's Old Vegas neon style decor
2. Fireside lounge with lots of cozy seating

My rating is on the TERRIBLE SERVICE and FOOD:  The service was terrible!! Our waitress Inka was not welcoming! She rarely gave us any attention. She did not ask for our drinks, we had to ask her for the drinks we wanted after our meal came. Fortunately, a waiter passing by gave us water when we first sat down. The food took a good while. I ordered the salmon while my husband along with his brother and girlfriend ordered turkey burgers. The wait was long. The waitress never came by to reassure us of our meal was coming. My order came with a salad and I didn't get it until our entrees were given. My husband's burger was bland. When we got our check, I was supposed to get bread with my meal. We went to pay, I asked the waiter was I charged extra for it because I never received it. She asked who was my waiter. Here comes Inka standing next to her. I repeated the question. Her Response? ""It comes with your meal but I forgot to give it to you."" There was no sorry or anything. We have never refused to give someone a tip before. She was the first.

Do I want irony in Vegas? Where there are soooo many competing amazing places that are open all night?

Peppermill is the kind of place that would mean so much to me if it was the only late night diner in a town with nothing else to do and the strange dark neon/art deco feel was just kitschy. But in my head, I can't put black lights and Hawaiian themes together, so it just feels really strange. I couldn't feel calm in the place if you gave me 3 shots of whisky and a valium. The cocktail servers in the lounge wear long evening gowns, and the restaurants servers where strange teensy server shorts with aloha shorts. It's just very very strange.

You have plenty of choices when it comes to the fare. It's quite a cornucopia / mishmash of food. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich which was quite tasty, but it wasn't something that wowed me. Pork was tender and shredded, but was a basic sandwich.

Basically, I should have tried something that was more on the ""diner"" side (burgers, sandwiches) instead of something like a pulled pork sandwich that takes a lot of time to cook. Basically I learned not only from here, but from any place that serves ""BBQ"", if there's no pit and you don't smell it in the air, don't order ""BBQ"".  

In conclusion, Peppermill is more for nostalgia of earlier Vegas with Denny's type food. It's just a smidge above Denny's, but not by much.",EE9txZm_zUFqWeYGVGaFNg,8,5,3,-H7tDOPpgV5IEseZ7NM-vA

My girl friends and I stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the Riviera where we were staying. 

Us: Can we walk back to Riviera in our heels from there?

Nuff said. Let's go THERE.
We got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, buffalo chicken wrap, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). We tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed.

After reading the reviews and looking at all the pictures I guess I kinda expected to eat around some sort of fire, but I was wrong. The fire is actually in the lounge area which I couldn't go into since I'm not 21. We were seated in the restaurant area which was decorated with lots of plants and flower decor with blue and pink lighting. I expected it to be very blue and pink, but a lot darker, so this was way brighter than I expected. 

I ordered the Conquest Sandwich and coffee and my boyfriend ordered a burger with mushrooms ( I dont remember the name). 

The coffee was HUGE, probably as big as a regular soda cup. It was pretty cool for pictures, but since it was so big, by the time I got halfway the coffee would already be cold. 

The mushroom burger came first. It came with a bunch of fries and a side of ranch. The fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light, not like most other places with thick fatty ranch.  The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.  

The Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich. 

The portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews. 

The service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed.

Peppermill is located on the strip north of the Wynn. You really can't miss it with the big neon blue and pink sign. I feel like it's just a classic place. I mean my mom used to work there back in her day, its been in movies, and it still packed on the weekend. Peppermill is a unique place. It has been a while since I walked into a bar and was just in awe. I know it's an older place and it could use some updating but fuck it, this place is cool. 
You have two parts, the lounge and the restaurant. My friend made reservation for the lounge for his and my best friends birthday for 20 people or so. We walked in on Saturday around 8pm and got to our table and started to order drinks. I love their drink menu. The have some basic drinks and then some ice cream items and even the scorpion. This night I was the DD so I could only taste a little bit of everything. Everyone got something a little different. Alabama slammer, grasshopper, creamsicle, and mudslide to name a few. Everyone had a blast and their happy hour is awesome. They have 50% off well drinks, house wines, and domestic beers. Also their beer are in a bottle. We found that out when we ordered Irish car bombs. No biggie tho. 
Inside the lounge they have a fire pit surrounded by water. Every time I walked by the seats were all taken and there was a lot of canoodling. The decor reminded us of poison ivy's lair with all the leaves and plants and also a strip club. They also have TVs playing different concerts. It was interesting because music was playing but we could hear each other. We had a large area and a lot of people but we could all hear each other. We didn't have to yell across the table or yell in someones ear. Peppermill was a blast from the past and I want to go back.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,33,24,4,8YARcSO_9i0lUdhKEuhJfA

The lounge attached to the restaurant is really cool.  Dark circular seating areas make it a great place for cocktails with friends or dates.  The fire pit near the front is cool too, with plasma TVs all around you shouldn't miss any of the game either.

Their Chicken and Red Pepper pasta is phenomenal, if you decide to eat at the restaurant side. The decoration is super cute and the staff outfits are as well. The graveyard manager is so sweet!!

We decided to try the breakfast yesterday, 1/7/18. We got there at around 10:30, there was no line at the front booth, we walked in at the same time as another couple. We were not greeted by the THREE people that were standing at the booth, talking among themselves. We stood there for a minute without them even acknowledging or the other couple that came after us. We told them we would like a table for two and they did not respond all they did is look down to see if there was a table for us and told us to follow one of the two young ladies .

Our server did not come to our table. We asked somebody else who was walking by for some drinks......at least 30 minutes past and our server still had not taken our order. There was a table next to us full of people who arrived at least 15 minutes after us and they had already received their food.

We told one of the servers that we were ready to order and they told us that they would get our server. They did. Her name was Amanda and she never smiled. We made our order and after that she only came back twice. One included her coming to give us the check.

We decided to pay at the front with the cashier. She also never smiled!!!! Didn't even tell us or any of the other people that paid before us to have a nice day. 

I think the morning staff needs customer service classes. Starting with those that are supposed to greet us, those who serve us and the cashier.

It was very disappointing. We will definitely not go back for breakfast..the late staff is much nicer. But we will be back for dinner and possibly drinks at the lounge.",1r16mREyVJCGEi6RMJIgRg,0,0,3,0fGauu2DtiOhsC9xpr1kmw

They have the curved couches with pillows which are really comfy to enjoy a drink in that you might just fall asleep.  The main draw of the room is a water feature off to the side with a gas fire coming out of it.  

The lights change colors and all the TV's are playing music videos (when is the last time you've seen a music video?).  While it sounds like it's almost a tacky environment, it really is cool and not dirty at all.  

Experience wise, the waitresses have a tiny chair they come in sit down on to take your order.  They call you ""doll"" and a bunch of other retro names and then smoothly walk away their flowing black dress not far behind.

Now one thing with the peppermill, is you may have to wait, but don't worry, you can make the most of your time by either playing at the slots they have or just chilling and having a mimosa in their fireside lounge. The fireside lounge has this 70s strip club kind of feel with its decor of red and dim lights. They have a multitude of drinks to choose from and you can go old school and get a White Russian or zombie. 

Finally when you get seated, they have both a regular menu, but really is more famous is there breakfast menu. By the way, this is as good as any Vegas buffet, because their portions are insane and much tastier. Had the Maserati omelette and I was in heaven. How often can you have italian with breakfast? I wanted to eat more but I was so full. Sometimes wish I was a fatty so u could of eaten it all. Can't beat italian sausage with eggs covered with a tangy pasta red sauce. Delicious!

Honestly, what can be said that hasn't already been written? The Peppermill has a great atmosphere, decent food, and hefty drinks. I brought an out-of-town friend here who, like me, has an appreciation for the ridiculous and the brightly colored, which this venue has many times over with tons of pink neon lights and 80's music videos playing on repeat. 

We grabbed a seat just above the fire and water sunken living set, and were greeted promptly by a server. We ordered a few drinks and went with classic mozzarella sticks and the Sriracha chicken bites. The food was pretty basic, but I would recommend the Sriracha chicken bites, especially if you're just going to sip and snack. 

Beyond the normal vodka soda and martinis, we opted for the Scorpion Bowl. This juggernaut of alcohol and sugar is best served over ice, but if so inclined, you can add ice cream into the mix for that creamy dreamy diabetes fueled coma. The Scorpion Bowl was ok, but insanely sweet and definitely needs to be shared with a fellow boozehound. The bowl is great as a one-time novelty drink, but I wont be ordering this on my next visit to the Peppermill.

3002283,2017-11-14,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"We were looking to find some breakfast in Vegas and wanted to try out a new establishment.  I had heard that the Peppermill was worth a try.  We decided to take a gamble and a short Lyft ride down the strip.  To best describe this restaurant in a single sentence, I would say it is a double-priced Denny's with slot machines. 

We walk in and ask for a table.  There is a 25 minute wait for a table but decide to be sat immediately at the counter in front of the waitress station/kitchen.   Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks never went empty.

We came here for breakfast and their menu had plenty of options.  I couldn't decide on what to get so I asked the waitress what they were known for/what was popular.  She didn't have an exact idea but said people like to get the country fried steak.  I said hey why not and ordered it.  My wife ordered the blueberry pancakes with sausage and bacon.  The food arrived surprisingly fast.  My food looked and tasted average.  The country fried steak looked like a big battered pancake covered in sausage gravy.  It was just too much for me grease-wise.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen I could see all the other customer's food waiting to be delivered and instantly regretted not going with a lunch option.  My sunny side eggs were alright.  My hash browns appeared fresh cut but were soggy.   I tried a bite of my wife's blueberry pancakes and they tasted great.  Fresh blueberries and such.  For her sides, she ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and her meal also came with a side of bacon and sausage.  

Overall, the food was pretty average.  The prices were kind of ridiculous.  My cup of coffee was $4.  My country fried steak meal was about $20.  My wife's meal the same price.  Overall, we ended up spending over $50 for meal that might normally run in the $20s range at a similar diner.  I could have eaten at Hash House for cheaper.  Oh well I learned my lesson.

Maybe I missed something.  Maybe I should have ordered lunch.  I just didn't catch the charm that was supposed to make this place special.",ptELJaRmNK8ej8YwL7Bdjw,1,0,3,bUXkTmD9ib4_ggU_jisT_w

Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny's. Then I would be coming there all the time. 

Located next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don't have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter ""C"", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe. 

The staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay. 

Looking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn't seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don't mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife's coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn't. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left.

They have a very extensive menu so they basically have everything to cover your needs.  The service here was pretty good.  Nothing to complain about.  

Southern Fried Steak and Eggs: Lots of gravy just the way I like it.  They cut the potatoes differently than other people but it was crispy.  
Gyro Sandwich: Maybe it was drunk me but it was probably the best gyro I've had at night.

The staff was very friendly being that this place was super packed with people waiting inside and outdoors for a table.

I chuckle when I see people give this place less than 4 stars because someone didn't honor their existence or because Bobby Flay didn't prepare their meal on their one visit.  This place is remarkable not only for enduring as one of the last of the old Vegas but because the service, portions and quality have all remained consistently high throughout at least the last 30 years.  They've tweaked when conditions necessitate but haven't really changed what they do because what they do is provide great quality and value without caring what trends dictate at the moment.  Pretentious? Go somewhere else.  Got friends and wanna hang?  Try the bar or restaurant, you won't be disappointed.

My mom and I finally made the trip last night and although the food isn't anything special, the atmosphere and service was pretty awesome. On the outside it looks like a Sizzler. On the inside, it looks like a retro Vegas hotel bar. We decided to get drinks in the bar instead of being seated in the restaurant. As soon as we sat down a regular (I assume) told the bartender he would buy my mom and I drinks. I ordered a martini and the bartender asked everything from what type of vodka I wanted to shaken or stirred to what garnish I preferred. Stoli, shaken, olives. And I got 3 olives at that. We played video poker at the bar while 90s and 2000s music videos played on a TV at the center of the bar. It was relatively quiet on a Tuesday night but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The bar only serves appetizers so we ordered the sliders and 10 hot wings. Again our bartender asked us a series of questions about which condiments we wanted with our food. The sliders were standard, but with surprisingly cold patties for how slow it seemed in the restaurant. The chicken wings were better and the sauce was perfectly spicy. I wouldn't consider Peppermill a legitimate dining option but would definitely come back to the bar. It was a lot of fun listening to the waitress' drink orders for their tables. Some of the highlights: White Russian, Colorado Bulldog (White Russian with Coke), and Hawaiian Sunrise. The bartender knew his stuff and wasn't phased by any order coming at him.

Some of My friend couldn't make it to my wife's birthday dinner celebration so we decided to get together to make it up. 
I liked that The parking lot is huge, plenty of parking for sure. Once we walked in, it felt like I stepped right into the 1970's. There is a foyer where a hostess is there to seat you. If there is a wait you can always go to the fireside lounge that's located inside Peppermill to the left of the restaurant side. (It's open 24 hours ) unfortunately The place had a stuffy smell it almost smelled like throw up,  that was a very off putting smell to experience before your about to eat. Plus the restroom were very dirty and close to the foyer. 
Our booth  was directly behind the hostess podium on the other side of the glass so we kept getting random whiffs. 

Hiromi was our waitress she was very friendly. And understanding when We took our time  choosing our orders we started with mozzarella sticks. My wife ordered the California Burger, I ordered the BLT&A with curly fries, my friends ordered the Peppermill Burger, Peppermill Pastrami Burger And the Fresh Fruit Salad. 

Service was 100% amazing. the food was so good and generously portioned. My BLT&A was so big & packed with bacon and avocado. I got the mayo on the side but didn't use any, because the sandwich was great just the way it is. 

My three star review is based on the rank smell and dirty restrooms . plus we thought it was weird that we had to wait in line to pay for our meals . it took us even longer because we had to split the check. And to top it off we had drinks added to our check we never ordered. It wasn't an issue but the fact the our waitress had to be called over to verify took us even longer to pay for our meals.",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,13,8,3,mc9OcRYYcQNsCSESMRGrDQ

I'd never heard of this place before, and never really seen it before even though it's so close to the Strip. My bf said he's been coming to this place for years so I guess for those that know about it, it's a legend. 

Why would anyone bother going to Denny's when you can go to the Peppermill?! 
Food was super fresh, I had a veggie omelette that was gigantic and perfectly fluffy. It seriously had to have been made with at least four or five eggs. Sadly I couldn't finish it, especially since it also came with toast and I got fruit instead of potatoes. Mind you, this was good fruit, not just some grapes and a slice of melon. It was more like a mini fruit salad along with all the other food! 

I must say, I have a special place in my heart for the kind of gaudy decor (fake plants and pink flamingo lamps) that awaits you at The Peppermill. The waitresses all wear cute little outfits and are super friendly, seemed like they've probably worked here since it opened.
Apparently there's also a nice fire pit in the other room, which I didn't get a chance to see. It's open 24-hours too so, of course, I am a fan. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town and I'd love to see what they have for dinner...",p3e9i4tlHM7EhvvUKJyqzg,3,2,4,iD_Oc2mRqWWh083fWLN-MQ

I have to say the food was good - I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad as the side.  The drinks were good as well and, although the one I ordered had no price listed, I found it reasonable.

The atmosphere was fun - lots of bright lights and funky uniforms for the servers.  With everything stated above, I could give the Peppermill 4 stars, HOWEVER....

The server took FOREVER!!!  We were there for dinner and, although seated immediately, were there for nearly two hours.  The server grabbed a box for me to take the remainder of my food home in, but didn't think to grab the check at the same time?  After that it took forever to flag her down... and even after she picked up the check it took her ages to swipe the credit card.

Although I enjoyed the food, the service absolutely killed it for me.  It was busy there, but by no means THAT busy.",AM3NGe9wtZDiwUyB31DZ2g,1,0,3,uOOPcLkee8Smgim6yATcdA

We asked her to choose any place she wanted to go eat for brunch and this is what she wanted. No five star fine dining steak house as we normally do this year. She wanted something much more casual and breakfast lol. What better place than the Peppermill. I was a bit caught off guard because I haven't been to this place in YEARS! I forgot how good it was. When we arrived it wasn't even busy and we were able to be seated immediately! The hostess was very friendly and helped us find a big enough table for 6 including a chair to sit my baby niece in. I also forgot how cool the ambiance of the place was with the neon lights and old school diner style tables. The outfits of the employee's are so cute it's so funny to see them walking around especially the cocktail or beverage girls. Not quite sure what they are called officially but either way it's cute! 

Like many have already raved about.. HUGE PORTIONS! I checked the pictures on Yelp prior to arrival and I had my taste buds fixed on one of these crazy big omelette's. It was more so in the evening dinner kind of time and I thought it was funny that my family all was in the mood for breakfast food. Except my nephew (teenager) just had to be different and get a sandwhich lol. Anyways let's get to this food! Yum! Since this was a family affair nobody ordered anything off the cocktail menu, and yes I know me of all people stayed sober and stuck with my water haha! Oh but believe me when I say I will return and take advantage of their daily happy hour! The drinks here look so fun and colorful.

*Bacon and Eggs: three farm fresh eggs (scrambled hard) served with four slices of bacon, hash browns and your choice of toast ($12.75) ×2
*Eggs Benedict: 3 poached eggs (poached medium) on grilled Canadian bacon and toasted English muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce, served with hash browns ($14.25)
*Joe's San Francisco Special: traditional classic of scrambled eggs with spinach, pork sausage, ground beef and onion, seasoned and served on crispy hash browns and smothered in a golden cheese sauce, served with wheat toast ($13.95)
*Maserati Omelet: a superb omelet bursting with sausage, jack and cheddar cheeses and mushrooms, smothered in a perfect italian meat sauce, sprinkled with parmesan cheese, served with hash browns and your choice of toast ($13.95)
*Side of Bacon: 5 pieces ($5.50)
*Coffee ($3.50) ×4
*Pepsi ($3.50)

I got the Joe's special. I always order this when I go out to breakfast, so it was nice having a Vegas twist on it. I liked the addition of the cheese sauce. I don't always like potatoes, so I kinda wished they didn't put the whole scramble on top of the hash browns. I was able to eat around it though. I tried my friends maserati omelet. I adore meat sauce, so I enjoyed this twist on an omelet. Tasted like spaghetti bolognese in breakfast form. I also got a side of bacon cuz I adore bacon. A good size as it came with five pieces.

I didn't know this until a friend told us, but apparently this diner has been featured in quite a few films, etc. I thought it was a cool little bit of trivia. I didn't recognize it, but one of the more prominent films mentioned was Casino.

Good place to go if you're super hungry as their breakfast portions are huge. I could only finish a quarter of my plate. They have a nice varied menu, so there's something for everyone.

Next we had the New York steak and eggs, decent size cut of meat and we'll seasons with a massive side of eggs and hash browns with a blueberry muffin on the side all delicious. Finally we had the Joe's San Francisco mess which is pretty much just a scramble top with cheese sauce with a side lemon cranberry muffin on the side.

When I arrived, I thought, ""Ok, maybe this is just like another burger or steak place like Applebees or Chili's"". 

Walking through the doors though, was a whole other world. It definitely resonates Las Vegas.

In the reception area you will discover slot machines, mirrored walls with lots of blue and purple neon lights outlining the different segmented areas.

On the right side of the restaurant is standard seating for groups, families, etc. decorated in some nice greenery.

As I walked towards the entrance to the left of the restaurant, that area is known as the Fireside lounge.

Throughout the lounge are circular table settings with a fireplace in the middle. The atmosphere reminds me of what I would imagine of the early heydays of Las Vegas. It was appropriate to dress up to the nines and hit the town and I imagine this lounge to be reminiscent of that era.

I was there to enjoy some drinks with my other Zapponian co workers and we ended up ordering some food as well.

The wings were good but I'll be honest, the drinks took a little long to arrive. I ended up opening two tabs and ordered from the bar.

Other than that, I had a great time.

The veggie omelet was large and comes with hash brown potatoes and a choice of toast, muffin or bagel. My omelet was perfectly cooked. The veggies were al dente and the eggs fluffy.

We stopped in for an early morning breakfast after a late night in Vegas. We must have walked in at just the right time because we were immediately seated in this very eclectic, gaudy diner. The waitress attire varied between what looked like a 80s throwback soda girl outfit and a 90s style prom dress. Hilarious and awesome. 

Families were sat around us, no drunks, no rowdy people--as others have mentioned. And the menu was a classic, American diner reprieve from fancy or over-the-top touristy stops. Me likey. The prices were a little high for breakfast-fare, but again, this is Vegas. 

Their eggs Benedict was the absolutely delicious and featured a split, well-toasted English muffin, topped with THREE poached eggs and some super-solid hollandaise sauce. And by ""super-solid"" I mean just classically delicious. No overly-powerful lemon punch, just well-balanced, rich goodness. Those hashbrowns were also off-the-charts good with fluffy and crunchy spots. I topped mine with Tabasco and loved that some of the yolks and hollandaise dressed the sides of the 'browns.

Peppermill has HUGE portions, I ordered the pancake combo for $12.99 which consisted of 3 pancakes as large as a dinner plate, 3 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage.  Not only is this a great value price wise, but the portions are probably double of what you would get elsewhere.  My friend got the chicken and spinach omlete made from 10 eggs!  It was a monster of a dish and delicious at that.  The customers seemed to be a mix of vegas locals and tourists but the vibe was comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Would definitely come here again next time I'm in vegas.  Oh, forgot to mention they are 24 hours and offer a full bar, nice!",jzRM1YIahBc4GGzvn-4wMQ,4,2,5,096yeGDnKDsu1IX1Q8_4wA

It is old. It's more of a relic of 80's Vegas. The Fireside Lounge is really cool, but very smoky. Not that great of ventilation. 

The food was hit or miss, but the portions are so big you really don't care that much. Or you are probably drunk like most people in Vegas. Just make sure you get something you REALLY like because you are going to have a lot of it. Like, maybe the biggest portion of your life. Peppermill makes Chipotle look like a joke.

When growing up in the late 70's, it was one of our go to spots for large portions of good comfort food, and busty, statuesque cocktail waitresses in flowing gowns.  Man, I remember the colored sugar in bottles on all the tables too...

There are no more Peppermills in the Bay Area, but this one still survives and is a throwback to that seventies diner.  Yes it's ghetto and cheesy, but think of Denny's, Carrow's, or Norm's but with big booth seating, neon lighting, and chrome accents and that's pretty much the way it was.  The colored sugar is gone, but the portion sizes are still decent.  I don't think I would come here to order steak or pasta, but standard diner fare is fine...

This review is in two parts, the restaurant and the lounge.

THE RESTAURANT

Mirrors, fake Cherry Blossom trees, red and blue neon... what's not to love?

Service here is very good, prompt and friendly.  Proportions can be ridiculously large!

On the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and I didn't want to be too full... so I was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  I ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made Yukon Gold Potato chips.  The sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though I could not finish them.  My wife had the chicken pesto sandwich with onion rings, both of which she LOVED.

We returned a couple of days later for breakfast where I had the country fried steak and eggs which was good, though again I could not finish it (and I am a BIG eater) and she has the French Toast Ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  It was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!  

I also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  I am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!

This place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  Proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.

THE LOUNGE

We freakin' LOVE this lounge!  Again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  I have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!

The waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  They prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their ""dress code"" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so I am not too what the boundaries of this ""code"" are.  

They have a really cool menu advertising ""retro"" drinks like champagne cocktails, Manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   I ordered a Vodka Gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a Beautiful.  Both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.  

Again this place can be pricy.  In fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at Treasures, a very high end strip club.

Money aside, I would find a reason to go to Vegas just to hang out at the Peppermill Fireside Lounge.

The ONLY reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.

Edit:  My wife's preferred drink this weekend was a Pina Colada.  She wanted me to point out that the Peppermill was the ONLY establishment that served her PC in a hurricane glass as it SHOULD be.  It may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details.",2xa5FYd6SRxPI9qDkF0N8w,0,0,4,d9uJO5hK2pGfg-4jqZuwuQ

Happy hour drink specials take place everyday from 3pm - 6pm, and 9pm - 11pm, and the bartending staff is very friendly and helpful! They're very knowledgeable about all of the items on their menu, and are not shy about offering their personal opinions of their favorite dishes etc.

The neon lights give the place sort of an old Vegas feel, which I like, and they have a knack for rewinding the time with their music videos from the 90's. I've also always enjoyed hanging out by the fire pit with the blue flame; it serves as a great place to hang out with friends after a night out of clubbing and drinks. Only downside--location. Not a huge fan of the area it is located in but what're you gonna do?

On our most recent visit on Saturday at around 11 am, we knew it would be busy and were told there was a 45min wait.  In comes the Fireside Lounge where we able to find a seat to pass the time where we ended up easily waiting 25 minutes before being asked for our drink order.  Once our drinks arrived in a timely fashion after ordering, they were exactly what we wanted.  As our wait grew longer, we began to wonder if we were forgotten.  At the hour and a half mark after hearing name after name, we went to check on the status of our table for 3 and upon arriving at the hostess stand we discovered our name had been erroneously scratched off at least 40 minutes prior.  Upon this discovery they promised to seat us right away, which they did.

We ordered a mixture of lunch and breakfast items and as always they were huge portions and delicious.  Once seated for our meal, everything exceeded our expectations.

The first time I ever came here, as soon as I walked through the door, I gasped in delight. I couldn't help myself. This is the prettiest diner you have ever seen!!! It's so beautius. The faux foliage with lights, the neon, the dim lighting... It all works so well together, and creates an overall classic retro, yet modernized feel. They have these cool flat screen TVs on the wall at one booth that flash to different scenes around the world. Really nifty to watch while you wait for your food. This place is maybe where say, a pimp might bring his bottom bit*h out for a semi-classy meal at 3am. I mean that in a good way, seriously.

If you have read the other reviews, then you already know: This is the place to come for some after-bar people watching. They get all kinds up in these parts. But everyone is so soothed by the wonderful interior ambiance and happily munching away at num nums that the times I have been there, I have not seen the typical drunk and angry bickering here.

The food is more expensive than your usual diner fare, but it's worth it. Not only is it all pretty much delicious, but you get large portion sizes too. I also love that you are serviced by the waitresses from the Fireside Lounge at your table, so if you wanna keep boozin' it up, that option is open to you. 
Speaking of waitresses, all the ladies who work in the diner are wearing the cutest outfits!! I almost considered temporarily getting a job there, jut to get the outfit!

The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. Not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. It totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why I love Vegas! The menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. Feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does shrimp scampi sound good - check; how about ribs - check. If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.

My husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. For a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.

On my last trip to Vegas this past December I got to introduce a whole posse of Vegas virgins to the neon splendor and faux cherry tree glory that is the Peppermill.  

Vegas is not cheap anymore, Vegas is very hip now and gone are many of the old cheezy Vegas landmarks that us out-of-towners tend to associate with this fair city, except the Peppermill.  This place is the platonic ideal of Vegas and I hope it stays.

I like that the servers are dressed in long, black gowns. It feels like vintage sexiness. The entire place is vintage -from the orange upholstered banquettes to the sunken fire pit. Each booth feels private, and since this place is kind of surreal in a back-in-time way, I could imagine that a couple looking to spice things up could start a night of sexiness at this smoky-mirrored mecca. Note - this place is not for those who like new, modern, high-end things. You will not find the Peppermill sexy if you don't like a little grittiness. If you're fancy and like new, sparkly things, check out the Chandelier Lounge in the Cosmopolitan instead.",nn-eoDYQ7zC6B-1wEtOCOg,0,0,4,RFpRdqBQ-Nsp69v2jjXjOg

In the end, we felt like we were in a bad episode of Charlie's Angels. The food was very sub par. I ordered the ""signature"" burger, and found it dry and flavorless. My wife's turkey burger was unseasoned, bland, and tasted like charcoal. The sweet potato fries were limp, and tasted like they had been sitting in a pool of grease. You can't order drinks from your server, so you have to track down the cocktail waitress. We tried the Scorpion, which supposedly had six shots. It was basically a bowl of ice and fruit juice. There was also a guy going around offering to take a complimentary picture. It reminded me of the guy who would make balloon animals at Carlos Murphy's back in the 80s. The free picture was 3x5.

You know like when you make a margarita and have some leftover in the shaker and all the ice melts and then you drink it sometimes against your better judgement...oh sorry.  Yeah, I know what a bad margarita tastes like and I know at almost  $10 a pop that shit better taste good.  So I was really pissed when the server wouldn't take the drink back.  She said that's why they suggest the 50 cent upgrade when they take your order.  I'm sorry, shouldn't a $9 margarita taste pretty good to begin with?  I asked her if i decided to upgrade would the bartender just pour the shot on top of my already crappy margarita and she said YES!!!  At this point,(when i thought I wouldn't be getting my money back) I said sure throw some more tequila(and possible spit from the bartender) on my shitty drink.  The drink comes back and Quel Surprise! still shit!  Fuming inside, i thought I'd try my luck with the manager.  She explained that it is their policy not to return drinks and that's how it is at most places on the strip, but she was kind enough(and seeing that i had barely touched the drink) to take the drink off the bill.

This place was super D - LISH!!! also, fetured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations... 

Let's start with the wait.. .oh hell yeah there's a wait about 1.5 - 2 hours, yes it was that packed and we didn't get to actually eat until about 1:00 pm or so. 

We decided to take our group of 10 and sit in the Fireside lounge...This gem is so hidden that we didn't even know until about 30 minutes of waiting outside.

Lets start with the FIreside Lounge - Think Super fabulous 70's, neon Lights, water / fire pit, ultra comfy seperate seating areas, did I mention the Scorpian( also featured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations) yeah that ones a rough one- its super huge!!!  My friends and I all started talking on why we haven't yet partied here and enjoyed getting drunk at the lounge... really why haven't we? Next time my friends next time...

So we get called to sit down to eat, the ambiance is like the old 70's/ early 80's charm again but with faux trees and neaon lights and faux plants through out... charming.

We get an amazing server, Jennifer, well we are told the portions are huge, in hearing that and then actually seeing the items delivered to the table - thank God we listened and we shared plates!!!

Breakfast menu is really off the chain here! we all took bites off each others plates to sample the menu.. so not disappointing at all eveything was great!  Chicken fried steak, eggs benedict, Joes grill breakfast thing, biscuits and gravy it was all scrumptious.

After inhaling most of my food we were all pretty much full and decided to walk up the strip to get back to normal after the food coma we just endeared.

My cousin and I had one of those late nights and wanted some grub before heading home. She wanted breakfast food, and I wanted something with meat and fries and maybe some greens to make me feel like I'm eating ""healthy."" Not a problem. Peppermill's menu has a good amount of tasty options.

Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap: I ordered this wrap which comes with the choice of either curly fries, regular fries, and onion rings. I chose curly fries because I can't remember a time when I went to a restaurant where that was an option. I think wraps can be hit or miss, but this was a hit.  I was really diggin' the combination of the spicy chicken and the mixed greens and house made ranch dressing. The curly fries were crunchy, greasy, and delicious.

The service is decent, though slow. We waited quite a while for our food to arrive, but the wait is worth it considering how good the food is and the generous portions you receive. 

Peppermill's location is on the sketchy side of The Strip, but the parking lot is well-lit and there is security that patrols the area.

It reminded me of some 70's porn like that Mark Walberg flick I can't think of right now. Anyway, as the hostess seated us I made sure to check our booth seats to make sure there weren't any stains on it (if you know what I mean). 

We decided to order and I went with a plain 2 eggs, hash brown and sausage meal with a strawberry mojito. My girl ordered french toast and eggs with a mimosa. There wasn't  really anything too special about the food. It was as basic as they come, but the drinks were pretty good! (Boogie Nights is the movie btw)

I did have the opportunity to check out the nice section (separate room) of the restaurant with the fire pit and TV's surrounding it and that part of the restaurant is really cool. I kind of wish we sat on that side and enjoyed my bday breakfast but honestly, I just wanted to eat and head out to downtown to gamble.

Overall, it was a cool experience to check out but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. Especially when you have so many other cool spots to eat at in Vegas.

Was nice and busy but not enough to feel overcrowded, just enough to feel like you're in the action of the Vegas strip. The location is right off of Las Vegas Blvd, so you can expect occupancy especially on a weekend. Awesome date spot if ya lookin for drinks and are trying to impress the lady (my girlfriend brought me here in our early days, smart gal)

The lounge was pretty comfortable considering we packed a corner booth with almost 20 people. Ambiance was awesome and probably the main sell of the joint. Groovy and aesthetically pleasing neons tones and retro seating and interior furnishings. Not to mention they were bumpin' nostalgic music videos from what felt like former MTV bops. The waitress was extremely accommodating and patient for a group of our size; she got every drink order correct, checked on us regularly and made us feel pretty comfortable. 

Drinks were great from what I gathered. The menu was cohesive and provided pictures, always helpful. Pretty sweet fishbowl option for the brave ones, fancy cocktails and beers. The cucumber drink seemed to be popular while I settled for a dead guy IPA in a bottle (delicious)

The only thing that keeps this place from fulfilling its potential is the lack of interesting dishes on the food menu. My impression was that it was very basic and easy dishes that you could expect at any restaurant/bar hybrid. With the glitz and glam of this spot, they could get away with an updated and modernized menu (in my opinion). Revitalized tapas and apps menu with creative or atleast interesting food options.

I wasn't in the mood for anything else but salad, soup, & bread. I had their garden salad, mushroom cream soup, and some garlic bread. Sadly the only thing I liked much out of all three was the bread, but I didn't even finish it. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger & we had ""heard"" that the burgers here were humongous. His wasn't even big at all, and he claims it was ""alright"". However my nephew ordered a mushroom burger & his was big! I saw a few other tables who ordered the nachos (from the appetizer menu)..boy that thing is HUGE!!! I would've been down for that instead :P My other cousin ordered the quesadilla which looked delicious but she didn't seem to finish it. Most of my other family members ordered breakfast & they seemed satisfied; they came in huge portions.

Diverse menu - something for everyone

Bad Highlights:
Hit or miss service

Fireside Lounge - If you don't smoke or hate being around smoke, then it's impossible to have a cocktail in their Lounge. I had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. It was super bad.

Just a general observation for Vegas newbies:
I see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. FYI - This is what I like to call the Vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in Vegas. Everything is more expensive here, even diner food. If you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in Vegas. If you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. You're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high.

inside is just as worse as it looks on the outside. its like a 1970's ate up the amazon forest and threw it up in here. decor is just horrible. we took a peak inside the Fireside Lounge and at least that part looked a lot better but unfortunately, they don't serve the full menu which was what most of the people in our party wanted. 

anyway, we were seated in a long booth for our party of 9, all facing the same direction which was really awkward so we asked to have a few extra chairs so that we could sit across from each other instead of sitting on a bench and having to yell like we were benchwarmers. luckily the servers were nice enough to let us do that even though we would be blocking the walk way. the menu was pretty extensive, but honestly, it's just like a typical diner. some of us ordered breakfast, some just a salad, some ordered sandwiches. none were spectacular. i shared the gyro sandwiches which came with a side of sweet potato fries for $12. it was OK.

After rumors circulated in the car that Holly from Girls Next Door dines there often, I assumed it was in the Planet Hollywood or another reputable hotel. Not the case. It is a completely random single-floor standalone restaurant dwarfed on both sides by megacasinos. They did have a private surface parking lot out front though which was convenient. My spirits began to rise again when I saw the interior - a lushly decorated 1980s bonanza of neon lights and big plastic trees...very disorienting, very stimulating, very Vegas. We got a nice big booth by the window and were only temporarily bothered by screaming children. The menu is extremely long and not in a good way. Not only does everything look atherosclerosis-inducing, it's not the guilty pleasure kind of bad food. Also, the alcohol menu is just a jumbled mix of everything - beer alongside cocktails alongside wine, with no explanations. I ordered a Salty Dog thinking it was a beer label I recognized and was rather disappointed to find that it was a vodka-pineapple. My pesto burger was weird but pretty good. To top it all off, they wouldn't let us split the bill, so we endured a long confusing argument with the cashier over how to pay.

The Eggs were cooked perfect. The Canadian bacon was good as well. It was tender and not salty. Some bacons are salty. The hash browns were cooked perfect but had no flavor. I had to put salt and pepper on my potatoes to jazz them up a little. Once I did that they were ok. 

My husband ordered the Maserati Omelet. It had sausage, Jack and Cheddar cheese, and mushrooms smothered in a perfect Italian meat sauce, sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese. My husband loves mushroom and sausage omelets so this was a no brainer. However, he was a little hesitant about the sauce so he ordered it on the side. He actually liked the sauce with the Omelet so he ate it with the sauce. He said the Omelet was very good and filling. He only ate half the Omelet because it was so big. He said the same thing I said above about the hash browns. He also had a huge pancake. He said it was rubbery and not soft and fluffy. It was not anything special. 

Also with my husband's meal, it came with a choice of muffin. He chose the Cranberry Lemon Muffin. It was amazing!! It was served warm and tasted homemade which I loved. It had cranberries in it with a lemon curd. This was the best muffin I have had from a restaurant. It was just so fresh and flavorful. Definitely try! 

Overall, although The Peppermill was so simple I loved my breakfast. I just wish the hash browns had a little more flavor. The pancake was also not anything special. Other than that, I enjoyed The Peppermill and thought it was a good suggestion.",Xvv0P_0B57LoyGrVHGG_8A,12,12,4,3Of8MOVtpuRWzkxbx4sl9w

We ordered Peppemill martini and Creamsicle that was good and taste like orange cream icecream :) for food Buffalo wings that was tasty and crispy and Brushetta which was ok. 

The reason for 3 stars are the place was too smoky and they played country music and sports so basically a country's sports bar which doesn't suit the ambience.

3564810,2010-05-25,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Wow, I really haven't written a review about this joint yet?  I'm pretty surprised.

This place surprises me.. so unassuming on the outside, you can literally drive past it a thousand times and not notice it's there.. inside it looks like old school, tacky vegas threw up in here.  Vintage plastic colorful booths, neon lights trace the ceilings, faux trees coming out of the booths... wow.  

There's also a fireside lounge which is all the rage, but I normally stumble into this joint on my very last hours of Vegas, tired, drained and out of cash, so I never have the time to check out the fireside lounge.

This place is known for their large 24 hour portions of breakfast.  They also serve lunch and dinner though.

There's an entire page of omelets.  Not a fan of the seafood omelet consisting mostly of fake seafood product and tasting slightly fishy.  I had better luck this time around w/the Maserati omelet filled w/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.  I can't imagine how many eggs it takes to make one order.  All come w/hashbrowns, and your choice of either toast, or english muffin, or bagel or fresh blue berry muffin.  That's a lot of freakin' food!!! 

You can also order some alcoholic bevs from the alcoholic waitress (heh) I had a mimosa given to me in a sangria glass.  Not very stiff, but still enjoyable w/my meal.

Honestly, I'm never really the biggest fan of diners.. so if it weren't for my bf's tradition of ending vegas trips here, I probably wouldn't have come back a second time.... but w/its unique environment, nostalgia, heaping portions of food, so so prices, i can see how it would be considered a good diner.",F_WfNGoYHAHDQy2abIYoNg,1,1,3,5mrq83mVukCs5MoVg2bXQA

Trust me and the other people who review this place, its way better than going to Denny's, IHOP or any place to get late night food.
Its not hard to find, its right on the strip, not too far from the WYNN/Encore Hotel. Basically in between Sahara & Spring Mountain streets.
Portions are big, and everything's not too bad for the price.
Fireside lounge is cute...kinda romantic?
The main restaurant decor is of course semi cheesy but I like it, it kind of lets you know...your really in Vegas hahaha.

So far I think one of my favorites off the menu is the Peppermill Pastrami Burger 11.95

Also if you ever get hash browns try it with cheese and country gravy  on top. For some reason that combination tastes really good when you've been drinking =D

3573589,2013-01-25,6,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"This restaurant is so ... Vegas, in all good and tacky senses.

THE ATMOSPHERE:
It feels like cheers bar for locals meets las Vegas disco ball. Homey, delicious, friendly.

THE DECOR:
Being inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.

I fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful. 

THE FOOD:
The coffee, so necessary after any 1/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.

My friends and I shared:
1) Munch's breakfast, which was sautéed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about.
2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering. 

With your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect. I loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekend.

Finally, there's colored sugar. I know, whoopee, but it just tells you what kinda place this is. It's vegas. there are no rules. have fun and roll with it!

In all, we spent $44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip. A bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being again.

3575414,2014-03-07,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I really don't get the hype over this place.  My wife and I went here for breakfast at about 10am because of the outstanding reviews.  It's typical old-school Vegas gaudy and very crowded. We waited an hour and 20 minutes on a weekday to be seated (now lunch-time) but were looking forward to the food because of the reviews.  They offered us cocktails while we waited (at 10am?  Well, it's Vegas, I guess).

First, the service was excellent.  The waitress was hustling and she kept up with all of her tables.  She was also very polite and attractive.

But that was where the good points ended.

 I got the corned-beef hash because it seemed to be one of the highest rated breakfast dishes.  Where I live, I'm used to corned-beef hash being fresh corned-beef sliced thin and layered over oven-roasted potatoes with sauteed onions and peppers and poached/basted eggs.  I was happily anticipating this sort of dish based on how stellar the reviews were.  Instead, I got a HUGE bowl of what seemed to be Hormel corned beef hash from a can with two basted eggs plopped on top.  Other than the minced potatoes mixed in with the copious amounts of ""meat"" and 4 slices of fresh (but well refrigerated) green tomato as a garnish, there were absolutely no vegetables.

I'm no stellar cook, but I would not serve food of this quality (or lack thereof) to guests at my home, let alone try to pass it off as a dish in a restaurant.  I also thought the size was overkill.  I HATE wasting food, particularly meat, but as a normal large (NOT fat) man, I was only able to eat about 1/3 of this dish and still walked away uncomfortably full, and being on a trip was not able to take any home with me (sad).

I can only surmise that the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are:

a. rating service only.
b. into ""all you can eat"" style dining.
c. tourists from places with nothing resembling a decent restaurant.

Sorry, but it was big waste of time and money.  You're much better off finding a greasy-spoon off the strip and eating something tastier, cheaper, and MUCH quicker.",jJ0YYfno7J0HqhrafOZs0w,0,0,1,S2PDWXgypIN0VK43aY6mWA

They're one of the oldest restaurants in vegas which is so cool! Open 24 hours, it kind of gives me a strip club vibe not going to lie but very worth checking out and dining! 

We came at around 3AM on Saint Patrick day after going to downtown fremont and let me tell you it was packed! There was a gigantic parking lot but it does still get packed. I was so amazed because i have never been here before and there was so many people early in the morning! Everyone was drunk so the customers were all so happy and the crazy thing was we waited for only 5 minutes and got called to sit at a table so they clean up super fast! When we sat down we looked through the menu and ordered. Our server was so nice and the food came out pretty fast too but let me tell you.. the portion is HUGE like the ""appetizers"" might as well be the entree. 

There was a lot of cocktail drinks and someone comes to each table and asks for your order but unfortunately we were drunk enough after fremont so we opted out. I loved this whole set up environment it felt so cozy and a good change of scenery from modern dining. There's also a 3 color SUGAR sprinkle on the table, don't think it was salt like me!

What we ordered: 

Mushroom Swiss Burger: The burger itself was so juicy but my complaint is that it was so soggy on the bottom so the burger was falling apart so for the first time ever i didn't finish my burger!! it was a deal breaker. But i have a love for onion rings and there's is soooo crunchy and battered perfectly they give you a big portion and the option to choose what side you wanted as well! (Medium rare cooked) 

Nachos Nachos Nachos: This thing is HUGE it should be illegal to say this is a appetizer. It comes out in 2 dishes and it was so cheesy. It was 3 colored chips with 2 meats and tomatoes and olives etc

I think this place deserves to be called a Las Vegas gem i'm so happy historic places like this still exists and locals should support businesses like this one to be around for a long time.

Great cocktails. Plenty of servers even if they aren't that good.
The menu is not typical Vegas fare.

Lo and behold, this joint had a burger topped with pastrami and cheese, and was sure I had somehow fallen into a hangover dream where my fantasy would soon be shocked back into reality with some shitty meat atop my dry gross burger - BUT it was not.
Win! Win! This sandwhich has made a footprint in my mind and I will have it everytime I visit Vegas...I will fly to Vegas for this sandwich. It was INSANE and I can only try to duplicate it at home.

3663303,2011-06-14,2,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Let's discuss the Peppermill Restaurant side first, because I feel like you have two totally different experiences in the same business depending on whether you are headed to the restaurant or the lounge.

The Peppermill Restaurant--So, the decor is a little tacky---what isn't tacky about Las Vegas though???  Really???  You walk in to a restaurant and you see neon rainbow lights, slot machines, dogwood trees and waitresses dressed up in skittles colored uniforms.  The visual entertainment alone is enticing enough for me to go there time and time again.  Even the sugar on the table is rainbow colored.

The food portions are humongous and I think if you are an average eater, you can get one meal and split it with someone and both of you would walk out full and content.  The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say that it's the best--but again---you're paying for the experience.  The prices are a little bit higher than an average family restaurant but, hey---someone has to pay for the electricity that's used in lighting up those colorful neon lights.  =0)  The service has always been great every time that I've gone.  So, give the restaurant side a try.

However--should you decide to pass the Peppermill Restaurant up---DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience the Fireside Lounge.  Not everyone knows, but the Fireside Lounge was actually used in a scene for the movie Casino with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.  Apparently, Deniro hung out there during the filming of the movie and he liked it so much that they decided to use it as a scene in the movie.  Aside from the movie trivia attached to this lounge, the experience is truly unique.  I would say that it's quite romantic and great for dates and especially a first date.  If you end up getting a little toasty around the fire on the velvet red couches, there are other areas in the lounge that offer secluded areas for private conversation.  The area is pretty dim and it's got the nightlife feel to it.  So, give it a try!!  And take a few pictures for us!!!

It was the night before my wedding. Our props were impressive--a set of hillbilly teeth fabricated by my friend's orthodontic stepdad, bolas, dreds and curly blond wigs. These luxurious party materials, and the classic Vegas setting of Fireside lounge, set the stage for a full evening of bacchanalia that (we thought) would leave us too tired to party like rock stars the following evening for the main event. If anything, it fueled the fire.

I go to Fireside lounge to enjoy its big red booths and to sit and mingle. Many a fun nights start or finish at this strip location. The free nuts can partially undo a spontaneous alcohol binge. 

Unfortunately Fireside installed TVs in all the booths a few years ago, which diminishes its classic and intimate appeal. Why turn the fireside lounge into a showcase for music videos? That's why I can't give it five stars.

We were cutting it pretty close to having to be at the airport, but had roughly an hour so the 20 minute wait didn't scare us off.

We sat at the bar and each enjoyed a couple of frozen, blended, strawberry drinks (about $12 each) and lots of conversation with the bartenders and waitresses picking up drinks, before our name was called and we were seated. A coffee ($4) was brought quickly and orders were taken fast too. Everything was off to a great start! 

My boyfriend ordered an omelette and hashbrowns for brunch. I ordered 3 eggs over-medium ($4), a bowl of country gravy, and a side of onion rings to dip in the gravy and egg yolk. I know, I know...  kinda weird but the rings on the table next too us looked too good to miss. Food finally came out (HUGE omelette and plate of hash $14!!) - everything arrived but the onion rings - which we were told would be there soon. So I ate my eggs. And then a bowl of gravy with a spoon. As I finished the last bite, we received another apology from Sophia for the untimeliness (still no rings) so at this point, since we'd finished eating, I begrudgingly had her cancel the order.  No offer to bring them out in a to-go box or anything...! Shouldn't they be almost done? I was really disappointed they messed up my breakfast order and did nothing to fix it. I had nothing to dip in my eggs or gravy, yet was still charged for the $3 side, which I ended up having to eat by eatself! No offer for toast.... anything?! Luckily, the airport was close so we had more food and drinks there while waiting for our delayed flight.

I totally understand when something goes wrong in a kitchen, or there's a miscommunication with staff, but in most instances, the best thing to do is not make the customer suffer as a result. If they cooked the onion rings anyway, all I can imagine is maybe they'd rather keep them for themselves than give them up for free to a hungry customer - from the way they looked on the table next to us, that's probably what happened.

I walked in and was seated at the counter (per my request). Although the spot was not cleaned, I assumed it would be soon. The waitress came, after a longer than average wait upon arriving, took my drink order, and left to give me time to decide what I wanted. Five or so minutes later, she returned to take my order. I saw her again once my food was ready and she looked at the spot in front of me with a look like ""where should I put this (as no one came to clean the counter). So I said ""well I guess I'll sit over here since no one is going to clean this"" and sat in the empty space to my right. She looked at me with the 'deer in the headlights' look and said ""oh, uh, sorry"". She set my food down and I didn't see her again until she breezed by to drop off my check. She had time to chit-chat to another patron (an obvious regular) but not to see if I needed anything (like a drink refill). Just as I am ready to leave to pay, she then notices my empty glass and asks if I need a refill.
The food was mediocre but no where near what it used to be, and the fries were barely luke warm.
I paid, left her a low tip but still more than I should have, and left. The spot I originally sat at had never been cleared. My first and last visit here. I can get better service and food from Denny's........and I hate Denny's!",23Lf7jAm4lFrwnTbQk5Pmg,3,0,1,uwrK7lnwpQyOKTS41AtPuQ

At any rate, I was primed and ready for a hearty, big-portioned meal. The Peppermill apparently has notoriety for that. I'm pleased to say that it didn't disappoint.

We were enticed by the Chicken Nachos as an appetizer. Little did we know that the Chicken Nachos would actually end up as our appetizer AND dinner. The serving size was enormous. Huge! Slathered in a variety of melted cheeses and topped with all the usual suspects, it was amazing. What I loved about it was that all the accouterments were served on the side: a bowl of re-fried beans and more melted cheese, sour cream, salsa and hot sauce. It's nice to be able to have control over the toppings.  Heaven! Bliss! After we were done with the nachos we knew we couldn't even consider ordering a dinner entree. 

I'm a little disappointed because I really was excited about trying Peppermill's Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. It'll have to wait until another trip, sadly. 

We also ordered margaritas. Honestly, they seemed watered down. But we are from San Diego and have very high standards for our margaritas. As such, I'll give them a pass for that. 

The Peppermill appears to have an eclectic demographic, consisting primarily of locals (at least at dinner hour). Our cab driver confirmed that. The douchebags don't typically venture that far down the strip, from what I've learned.

I've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.)

The portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.)

I read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like ""one dimensional"" Whats that about? Someone else said ""over priced"" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.

The only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.

The spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass.

- country fried steak + eggs w/biscuit + gravy: uhm... pretty perfect. i loved the crunch of the steak. hashed browns were perfect - hot and fluffy with plenty of crunch! eggs were... you know, eggs. nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. biscuit was fluffy, flaky and light! amazing smothered with the country gravy
- bloody mary: they do it right! spicy, flavorful, i had this at the fireside lounge before we got our table and nearly drank the entire thing. its like a freaking meal in a cup!

for two breakfast entres and two coffees it came out to about $45 (doesnt include the bloody mary) with tip... so, not as cheap as dennys, but i think it was worth every penny.

pros:
- food! well... i cant really speak for anything other than what i ate and drank... but it looks like they do breakfast foods great. the menu looked extensive! i had to limit how much i could look at because if i looked at anything i wouldnt be able to order
- service: pretty good. jennifer was cheerful and had a great attitude. she wasnt always the most attentive, but i went in at the end of father's day brunch, so everyone looked swamped. but despite being busy, she always remained positive and happy
- location: right on the strip towards the north end, its a great 24 hour place that serves great food

cons:
- decor: ... honestly, i went back and forth because i wasnt sure if this was a pro or con for this place. yes its damn cheesy and outdated and wacky. i cant imagine a time when the decor or the servers' outfits would have been fashionable... but, it kind of works with the feel of it. the fireside lounge is pretty cheesy too. it seems straight out of the seventies but... it makes this place memorable! id prefer the blatant outmoded fashion and decor then a place that just tries too hard to look modern and ends up looking commercial (think the wynn decor... yuck!)
- part of the decor i guess, but this place was freaking dark. maybe just part of the ambiance, but weird to eat your breakfast in such a dark place

anyways, despite the cheesy outdated decor (think dennys + disco + lots of dark purple stuff), would i go back again? YES! why? the food was amazing. i love breakfast places. so instead of spending big bucks at a brunch buffet, why not just get it right at the peppermill?",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,0,0,4,igEKsH9JrQxpVAZyqpN34A

3.5*  Unless you eat at McDonalds or a food court, there is no cheap meal in Vegas anymore, at least not on the strip. Prices for breakfast can be steep in the hotel restaurants. Peppermill is an economical option because they give you big portion, like food-coma-big-portion. And it's open 24/7.

It's a diner alright, but with tacky decor. Think purple neon lights and trees inside. Waitresses clad in Hawaiian-theme uniforms. This is the big-eater haven, the greasy-spoon diner where you go to soak up the alcohol. That said, I only come here for breakfast.

*Fruit Plate with Banana Nut Bread ($13.25): This is literally a basket full of fresh fruit--cantalope wedges, honey dew wedges, pineapples, grapes, strawberries and kiwis. You get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  Skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.

*Tostada Omelet ($13.50): It certainly tastes better than it looks. It's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. Looks like nacho. It comes with hash brown AND tortilla chips.

*Sausage and Three Eggs ($11.95): Probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute Canadian bacon or ham. My scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. Very greasy and fatty. Instead of toast I requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. It was steamy hot but chewy. Not very good.

*Extraordinary Oatmeal ($9.50): Sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. Healthy option. 

It's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go. If you want to challenge yourself, get the French Toast Collage with four wedges of French toasts, two eggs, two strips of bacon and hash brown. Eat yourself to a coma. Quantity certainly supersedes quality here. It's not bad but nothing mind-blowing. Service is quick and friendly. It's a no-frill place on the strip north of Wynn between Encore and Riviera. Crowd range from divey to genteel retired. Get here early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after 10.",Zy_Rw00SjE47uhv-WuHTDw,1,1,3,xqX8DOg-QVKw8cBCnMGPAQ

I love this place, it is like an 80's throwback, lot's of glitz and glamour, and all the PerrpeMills I have ever been to are exactly the same. ((Bay Area included)). 

The fireside lounge is pretty cozy as well (same as it ever was) a bit of an icon, nothing like a froo froo drink and some appetizers in front of a fire (in Vegas the fire place is not really a requirement) but it makes you think it might be really cold outside (which in Vegas is rare).

I have lived in Las Vegas for just over ten years now. Finally I have made it to the Peppermill. Service was a little disappointing, but not so bad to kill this review. My wife and I went on a Friday close to 11:20am. We were told it would be about 20-25 minutes until a table was ready; we were invited to wait inside the Fireside Lounge.

My wife and I don't drink but LOVED the atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge. We literally sat fireside, watching the atmosphere, looking over the menu, this is where I discovered that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had dined at The Peppermill. Personally I think that's cool. As if it were on cue, our table was ready in 20-25 minutes.

As we sat, at our booth, Hope you like booth seating. Unless you are at bar we will be seated in a booth! Our server arrived soon after. We were overlooking the menu still as the waitress took our drink orders. When she returned we still needed time to decide. Our waitress said ""I'll be back"" as if our not ordering yet was an inconvenience for her. 

The food was fine. Typical diner like fare. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I ate a  Philly Cheese Steak, Savory u.s.d.a. choice beef strips flash - sautéed with strips of onion, bell peppers, sliced tomato and smothered with provolone on a grilled steak roll. My wife ate what was called, Conquest, Combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, sautéed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon, served on grilled parmesan sourdough. The meal reminded me a lot of eating at a diner like Denny's. When I mentioned this to my wife she fully agreed. 

As we were eating, a lady with camera walked by and asked if we would like to pose for a souvenir picture. We agreed.The lady with camera said she would return as soon as we were done with out meals. But alas she never returned.
The meal was all but over. My plate was empty; my wife still had a few onion rings on her plate. Our waitress came by and asked how we enjoyed our meals. As we were answering, she took the plates, without asking if my wife wanted those remaining onion rings.

WELL KISS MY GRITS!

It's kitschy Vegas at its best. The seating is arranged in these amorphous islands of booths, which makes us feel like we're all neon jellyfish in the middle of the ocean deep, and it's enchanting. 

The diner food is also as good as it gets. The three of us discovered that we are all ""breakfast for dinner"" people, and we freaking chowed down, sharing parts of our ginormous meals with each other but still managing to clean most of our plates.

French Toast Collage - So good, and I'm so glad I got to share a couple of my squares so I didn't have to eat them all myself. Eggs, bacon, sausage, all perfect.

Steak and Eggs - Very good, quality steak, sunny side up eggs, and I tried the wonderful toast and real strawberry jam also.

Although expensive the only thing I actually enjoyed for the whole meal was the bagel. My parents didn't enjoy their food (Joe's SF breakfast and Country fried steak) and my brother said his was okay (turkey burger). Our waitress (Angelica or Angelina or something like that) was rude and never smiled but smiled at the guys at the bar while flirting. My mom told the manager and she said oh I'm sorry about that and didn't even discount anything of the $80 bill. We've eaten better at a buffet dinner for only $65!

You feel like you are in a bit of a time warp here. Waitresses in panty hose and plastic plants abound. 

Once we were seated, the service was great. We decided to split the Lorraine omelette and a Belgian waffle. The omelette was light and fluffy. It featured the perfect amount of bacon. The waffle was solid. I ordered a mimosa for the Mr. It was quite large and carried the price tag to match its size.

The night before we went to the High Roller which everyone should do and had dinner from a taco truck. So around 3am (we are from the east coast so my sleep schedule was all screwed up) I woke up hungry. So around 330 I had woken him and convinced him we should go to breakfast since we had an early flight out that day. 

We were staying at the SLS and asked an employee downstairs of some breakfast options. The hotel had a breakfast but the guy said Peppermill was great so we called an Uber. It was maybe less than a mile away so we ended up walking back. 

Once we got there, we felt sort of old because apparently everyone is just awake at 4am in Vegas - like from the night before. And we are showing up sleepy since we just woke up. Anyway, the place was packed but somehow we got seated very quickly. 

Our waitress was over right away and showed us the drink specials which I could take advantage of but bf couldn't since he had to work that day. So I decided to rub it in and ordered the scorpion which is huge. I think she said six shots are in it. I can't remember for sure because I had six shots of liquor. Whatever it was, it was tasty and gigantic. 

Our food even came out quickly which we didn't expect given how crowded they were. I have no idea what I ordered - I can't find it on the menu but there is a pic and it involved eggs and peppers and chips. It was fantastic and I don't usually love breakfast at 4am. Bf had the chorizo and eggs and ate all of it. 

We ended up walking back to the hotel which made us feel sort of better about ourselves given the amount of food we just ate. Anytime he's working here again I want to come back and try some of their regular menu. It's a great place.

3837144,2007-03-07,2,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the Peppermill Inn Restaurant. 
I had heard about the Peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that I make a stop there during my stay in Sin City. When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.
The lettering on the outside said a lot when I see ""PEPPERMILL"" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, ""Do you get a headache working here?"" She giggled and said,"" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it."" 
As she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.
I called my brother in law for ""must-haves"" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.
Rumors of the breathtaking ""Fireside Lounge"" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic. We sunk into a spot around the fire and it took Superman's will power to get us up and out of there.

From the outside it doesn't really look like much but once you step in, it's like entering a different world. 

The inside was really cool because everything was bright and colorful, yet still had a dimly-lit feeling. The bright neon lights and the light above our table didn't make it seem as dark as it felt. I really dig the ambience to this place. 

I ordered the pork loin and eggs. The dish consisted of 4 pan-fried pork cutlets, hash browns, your choice of toast, and 3 eggs of any style (I went with poached eggs). The pork loin was soft and tender. I'm sometimes hesitant to order pork dishes (especially pan-fried pork loin) because they run the risk of being hard, dry, and unappealing. The way the chefs cooked the pork here made the pieces easy to cut, and retain most of the natural juices and flavor. Bravo!

The hash brown shreds are bigger in size than most places that serve similar diner food. The poached eggs were alright, and is best eaten with the sourdough toast.

One of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. The price for a steak dinner ranged from $26 to $29. I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for $29. The steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners (chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter)  were no better.  If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type.

before entering the lounge you must remember the dress code: no hats. other than that your good to go. it was dark but the neon lights and black lights brought a relaxing mood to this place. it was me and 3 other guys. bad idea. this place is for COUPLES! if your not there with a significant other, you'll feel a little awkward. the plush couches were made for snuggling. we felt really uncomfortable and so we headed straight to the bar. i saw those huge goblets and i told the waitress i wanted whatever drink goes inside those. the cocktail was the scorpion. i had it before at trader vic's. its a very good fruity/girly cocktail. i really couldn't taste/feel the alcohol....yet. its 18 dollars for the cocktail but it can easily be shared by 3-4 people. some guy next to us won 7000 dollar jackpot in video poker, and i'm not too sure the management was too happy with that. overall, this place is a really chill, relaxed place to hang out after a long hard night of gambling, drinking, clubbing/dancing. but make sure you come with a significant other or else get ready to feel lonely and awkward.

3875500,2009-12-13,8,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Mission:  Find an old-school lounge in Vegas.

This place intrigued me from the start, but I almost didn't walk inside. I thought it would be in a casino, but from the outside it looks like an old Denny's complete with cheesy writing on the windows. But just ignore all the families waiting for a table as you bypass the restaurant and venture to the lounge for tropical drinks and shenanigans.

This is what a 70s pick up bar looks like in my dreams. Jack, Larry, Chrissy and Janet would love it! A dark jungle filled with couches and vines and touches of neon on the ceiling. Servers are lovely ladies in long black dresses slit to the hilt who join you on your lounge when taking your order. If you don't mind being part of the PDA show, sit on a loveseat in the firepit and become mesmerized by the bubbling electric blue liquid. Couples that want a little more privacy, should sit at one of the tables.

The majority of their cocktails are fruity tropical drinks and they pour heavy.  My early drinking days were filled with pina coladas and mai tais, but I've since transitioned to elegant cocktails. So it was like handing the reigns back to my early-20s self. I didn't have a care in the world here. They have a few beers, but nothing on tap. Prices are a bargain compared to other lounges on the Strip.

I've got to admit that there are a few buzzkills to an otherwise ridiculously awesome Vegas experience. There are TVs everywhere and they play a continuous loop of bizarre music videos and performance pieces. For every bit of Vegas spectacle (Cher) there was something absolutely ridiculous (early Mandy Moore or really late Hall & Oats). About half of the acts couldn't even be identified. It was sort of like watching and listening to a slo-mo hair band audio car crash. The more significant issue was the continual interruption of the speaker announcing that tables were ready in the restaurant. 

But if you can tune out those distractions, it is a swingingly good time. Mission accomplished!",j4BMT5Oyrt15-pwK3cRSZw,7,7,4,kb_yeySPLJhSY7e6vt_x3Q

Lots of neon lights, what I would call ""costumes"" for the servers, great older music, and endless people-watching opportunities.  The portions are HUGE and the food is great!

Great mimosas and bloody mary's but beware of the up-selling skills of the bar/lounge servers!

Tip: They DO NOT split checks.  I repeat, they DO NOT split checks.  Bring cash or use the ATM there to grab cash if you're with a larger party.
Tip: there are dining room servers (funky ""costumes"") and bar/lounge servers (black dresses).  Don't try to order food from the bar/lounge servers or alcoholic beverages from the dining room servers.
Tip: The wait can be pretty insane sometimes.  Be prepared to wait; have a drink in the lounge or play some slots to keep yourself occupied.

When you're looking to bring an out-of-towner to a classic, old Vegas joint for a bite - you do the Peppermill. The portions are HUGE, the food is diner-y, and the staff's costumes are absurd. 

On this occasion we over heard the hostess call another diner a 'dumb b*tch' to another staff member, and I was pretty disgusted. Not only should you never speak about a customer this way, there's no excuse for it to be done on the floor in front of other diners. Gross. I left a comment on the comment card at the table. 

The french dip sandwich is so good that my husband gets it every time we go. I've tried some of the appetizers and the BLT - they are typical diner fare, so I'm still searching for my go-to meal at the Peppermill. The menu is arduous and nothing really pops out at you, because it's stuff you've seen before. I'm sure something will eventually tickle my tastebuds. 

Along with the neon lights and indoor trees/garden - you'll find a container of sugar sprinkles on each table which is a lot of fun. I'm not quite sure why each table would need this at all times, but it helps to make Peppermill the Peppermill - and that's okay with me.

Oh my gosh, thick foccacia style bread, buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatos, drizzled with balsamic and basil served with a side of fresh fruit.  Yum...I just started drooling thinking about it.  The last time we went I got the steak and mushroom salad thinking it would be a mixed green salad with mushrooms and a couple slices of steak.  No sirree this was the entire piece of meat teetering on a bed of greens.  Granted it wasn't Meyer's Ranch's finest but still for $13.95, holy cow!

Let me not forgot about the most divine part of Peppermill: their breakfast which is served 24 hours.  Of course I've had it at normal hours as well as after leaving the club at 4 AM but the pinnacle of it all is weekend brunch after some hard partying.  Prepare for a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table but so worth it.  Their french toast is melt-in-your-mouth, the eggs benedict is the best classic version I've had in Vegas and their omelettes are too die for and big enough for 2-3 people to share.  Don't forget about their Bloody Marys which are the size of a vase (Rock star tip:  Order an extra shot to ease the transition back to the daylight).

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because with so many 5 star dining places in Vegas, Peppermill is not the most innovative but I just have to give Peppermill the benefit of the doubt and go with 5 because honestly it is just so d*** good.",2JRzKU0fRdgmJkamcHXKiA,2,1,5,FBj6OZ5ks9wLmRJOAeGoXA

My cohorts went to bed early because of a long day ahead for tomorrow, but I'm a late night person (usually go to bed around 3:30-4am) so I left them in the room & went exploring. We were staying at Circus Circus, and after walking around for an hour just checking things out I decided to kill a little bit of time playing slots. Now, I'm not into gambling but I figured I'm in Vegas so I might as well do a little bit of gambling. Within 5 minutes of sitting down I won over $20 on a slot machine so I decided I would cash out & use the money for a late night steak dinner. I didn't see anything at Circus Circus that fit the bill so I went out walking and within a few blocks saw The Peppermill. I figured that was the place.

It was pretty much packed so I sat at the counter. After looking the menu over I quickly decided on the New York Strip & eggs. The place was bustling with patrons & countless waitresses buzzing around. I ordered my steak rare, my eggs sunny side up, the hash browns crispy & an English muffin. The waitress was nice, friendly & attentive.

Everything came out as ordered. The 'shred' on the hash browns were larger than typical but I found them to make the texture even better than the normal shred. I found nothing wrong with each item in my dinner. The steak was rare, tender & trimmed properly. Eggs were spot on sunny side up. Hash browns crispy. Everything was exactly what I was wanting in a late night dinner. Adding a few dollars for a tip to my winnings, I paid & left satisfied.",ib-CV-QFHbQ3fUT8m6yJaw,3,3,4,c0NHheKMMs6INy36LRMWAw

That said, I'm so happy that a place like Peppermill exists, but pretty disappointed that it's taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here. 

This place is SOOOOOO cheesy Vegas - I know there's a Canter's in Vegas, but if Canter's fully embraced the aesthetic of the city, it would look like this place. The ceiling, walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles, the lampshades are stained glass flamingos, and every plant i the place is made of plastic. Even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles! Just don't get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding. 

The menu is pretty comprehensive - you've got steak, sammies and everything a 24/7 diner-like place should have. Prices are kind of on the steep side, but the food is tasty. We went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout the day. By the time we got there, we were all FAMISHED. 

The varied menu made it hard to choose, but I nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich, which was perhaps on my top ten list of Best Choices I've Made in My Short Life. It may have been the fact that I was super hungry, but I do not exaggerate when I say I was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread I was so happy. I chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me. If I was challenged to marry the thing, I would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where Elvis would have married us, and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the ""honeymoon"" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate. It was that good. 

Oh, I sampled other peoples' food as well, and it was all pretty good.

From here we were ask how we would be paying for the table because there was about 8 of us and they don't split checks so everything has to be on one bill(which was understood before arriving to the establishment) we said that was fine and that we will be paying cash, Leliae said I was fine and then a few minutes later came back to the table and as for a debit or credit card to be placed on hold which is odd I've never heard of this being done at a resturant. Especially since we weren't sitting at a bar we were sitting at a lounge, so having an open tabs or and open credit card should not have been necessary I'm very curious now as to if this is a policy that they follow.

My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us.

Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.

My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score.

3999072,2018-03-24,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I are bartenders and know how the whole restaurant deal goes. We came in around 5am for breakfast and we get it: It's early in the morning, drunk people are still coming by to eat, plastered from the clubs, it gets annoying. 

Once we arrived, I was super stoked to eat. It's beautiful inside with the neon lights and a retro Diner! It was so cool looking.

Food: I got the eggs Benedict with the poached eggs and he got the crab cake Benedict with poached eggs. The eggs were NOT poached but mine was still delicious, he wasn't so hot on the crab cakes.

Drinks: We started off with waters and decided to get Bloody Mary's since I saw a few reviews saying they were delicious, so we gave it a go! First off, the cocktail waitress took 15 minutes to get to us and the bar was not busy and the restaurant itself wasn't that crowded. She finally came by and we decided to get mild spice with Kettle One Vodka (for 2 - $21). Keep in mind, they only put single shot liquor in their drinks unless requested a double. Secondly, we tasted absolutely no alcohol and even with a single shot you can taste a little something. We tasted watered down Bloody Mary mix lol was completely disappointed.

Our server: Amanda was sweet. Towards the end, we shouldn't have to wait more than 20 minutes for our bill and was even more frustrated to see her just sitting down at a table talking with someone I'm guessing she knew right across from us. Get it together girlfriend. I'm sure working in Vegas is a hit or miss with tips but decent service can make a huge difference. 

When it came to our bill, we kindly asked if it was possible to take my drink off since I barely drank mine and my boyfriend was a trooper and drank mostly his. She rudely said that problem doesn't go to her, it's all on the bartenders and she'll get the manager for us.... okay. 
The manager came by (Austin, we THINK. Pretty tall dude with brown hair. I don't know, I probably heard his name wrong) ANYWHO, we kindly told him what the deal was and he suggested to put an extra shot because they can't comp off drinks for whatever reason. We declined the suggestion since I no longer wanted to continue drinking it regardless but we still had to pay. The bill ended up being $56.61.....

Sadly, after this last visit I won't be running back. It's always packed and that's expected, but the service was way too slowwwwwwwww. I really hope they make these improvements because they have delicious pancakes and killer Bloody-Mary's. 

Food was overpriced but each plate could feed 4 people so you won't be cheated when you see your platter appear. But if you have a hearty appetite or have a car full of linebackers or truckers they will appreciate the portion size.

The Peppermill has been around a long time. It's an old school favorite of mine and a go-to restaurant back in the early 2000's. The Peppermill has not changed in years and full of enough neon to have their own Neon Museum.  I love it!!

The food portions tend to be the highlight at the Peppermill.  Every dish is on steroids.  For the bros out there, I don't mean that literally.  They hook it up to the max at the Peppermill and still manage to keep the price per meal very low.  I used to come here for their burgers, fries, nachos, and desserts.  They're all good.  But now, it's all about their 10 egg omelets.  That's not a typo...10 freakin' eggs AND it's still served with toast & hash browns.  I even talked to one of the shift leaders and she stated that most people eat only half of their meals here.  Well, not this guy. I will deMELish their omelets every chance I get.  Their omelets are so good that it would be a shame if I had any leftovers. 

This restaurant is always busy and a wait for a seat should be expected.  The service is top notch as well.  I highly recommend the Peppermill, especially if you're craving a beast of an omelet. 

Just a note...
Some people have mentioned that the Peppermill looks like strip club inside. All that's missing is a stripper pole.  I beg to differ with these people and think they got it backwards.  I think a strip club looks more like a Peppermill.  All that's missing is their 10 egg omelet.

I was in town for business on Valentine's Day and looking for a spot to drink a brightly colored cocktail on a velvet couch with my queen of a coworker, Taylor S. The Peppermill came recommended by a few trusted Yelpers and I'm so glad we gave it a go!

Everything screams Vegas at the Peppermill--from the colorful neon sign outside to the outrageous cocktail menu, it's all just so fun. We found ourselves a couch in the fire lounge which was surprisingly not crazy busy for a holiday. Our server was dressed to the nines in an evening gown and was super sweet. I ordered a Blue Hawaiian cocktail which honestly wasn't that good, but the bright blue hue totally fit the vibe. They've got some super indulgent drinks with thing like whipped cream and chocolate chip cookies in them if you're into that sort of thing--you can also get a solid dirty martini (according to Ms Taylor). 

The lounge only serves apps, so we ordered a giant plate of nachos to split. It comes with a side of refried beans doused in some sort of fake cheese. The nachos weren't the best ever (I'm seeing a trend here), but they got the job done and the portion was enormous for the price. There was also a lady onsite taking photos and giving out a free print in celebration of Vday. You could also buy extras for like $20, but I loved my free little souvenir.

This was in the 80's, when your parents sent you and your sibling off with a $100 bill each morning to entertain ourselves all day and night at Circus Circus and other hotels. To get around, we'd catch cabs like New Yorkers and would only go back to our hotel when we ran out of money. Parents. They had it so easy back then.

They say you can never go back to the old days, and going to the Peppermill lounge as an adult is that adage personified. (Not that I was in the lounge section as a kid.) Questionable quality of food that's highly recommended as delicious by all their waitstaff (???) strong, strong, STRONG drinks and hilarious dim lighting, accented by the blue pools of flames that the round booths surround.

The restaurant had a couple of others in it (we're talking dinner at 3:45 so its even early for the early birds) but they sat everyone in places where you didn't feel like you were on top of the others.  Service was prompt, nice, informative, and thorough.  The food was great, I had a fantastic salad, and my bf had a sandwich which looked yummy.  When he realized it had bacon on it, and he doesn't eat pork, the waitress took it back no questions asked and had a new one made for him.  The manager stopped by to ask if everything was okay, and thanked us for coming in.

Hmmm I looked at him and told him again mayo and ranch yet again. He said ok and walked off. It took almost 10 minutes for that, ridiculous. Ok so we ate and like I said food is delicious and the portions are huge but just a heads up you do pay a lot to have big portions. Nothing under $10 in this diner.

My husband loves everything retro. I came across the Fireside Lounge while researching places to go on our Vegas trip, and knew immediately that this would be right up his alley.

I was right. The velour couches, neon lights, and servers dressed in long gowns definitely made us feel like we were in a time warp. Well, except for the fact that bad 90s country music was playing. I mean, if you're going to go with a theme, you need to go all in!

Service was a little odd. We waited a few minutes for the server in our section to greet us. Then another woman came by and was like ""hey, so and so is supposed to be your server, but I may wind up being your server, so we'll see."" Then after bringing our drinks, she said ""yeah so and so is supposed to be your server, but she's busy, so I'll be taking care of you."" I mean, okay, I guess?

I ordered a Kiss Me Cucumber, which was delicious, but super weak alcohol-wise. Even after a second one, I felt nothing. My husband had two double jack and cokes and definitely felt it a bit.

I have tried to hit up Peppermill on my last TWO Vegas visits, but circumstances prevented a drop-in. Looks like third time's a charm, because I was finally able to step inside the glory that is Peppermill, and loved it so much that I came back the next morning for brunch part two.

Peppermill is like an 80s Club + Rainforest Cafe, so basically my two favorite things combined (not even really joking about that). Please take a moment to imagine neon pink and purple lights running along the ceiling, lush fake foliage abound, vibrant blue stained glass lamps overhanging each table, while you enjoy your morning booze and breakfast. No, seriously. IMAGINE.

Both mornings, we dropped in and put our names down before heading into the mysterious ""Fireside Lounge"" door. The 80s club vibe kicks up about 200 notches here, as you descend into a circular pit complete with rusted orange sofas, and outdated music videos on a tv that hovers above a circular pool and fire pit. It feels good for about 18 second before it's absolutely too hot to be down there, but you don't leave because it's just. too. cool. Start off by enjoying a cocktail in any variety (A sweet strawberry take on the mimosa? A ridiculous huge daquiri in a glass the size of a baby's head? Even coffee with baileys will do ya!), served by a young lady in a satin prom dress, before being whisked away to your dining experience.

Breakfast on both mornings was deelish. Morning A introduced me to the eggs benedict, while Morning B seemed fine for the chorizo. Both were extra tasty. On Morning B I asked if an iced coffee was a possibility, though it wasn't on the menu - the server happily accommodated by pouring coffee over ice into an ice cream sundae glass. I also love that coffee comes with options like vanilla creamer and RAINBOW SUGAR!

I will not be back for food (dinner) it was good but I can get the same for cheaper in a local spot.  I think if you are a tourist it is totally worth it for the cool ambiance the lighting is sparkly  and fun, the restaurant is dimly lit anding to all the glittering lights and trees surrounding you.  Big oval booths add to the fun 70's 80's ish feel.  

I had a huge burger Ciabatta Pesto Burger Flame-broiled burger could taste the flame in the food.  Mozzarella cheese, fresh basil instead of lettuce a nice touch, red onions some were hard and not good so I had to pick them off, tomato, Prosciutto (prosciutto was old and hard had to pick that off as well) and pesto (lots almost to much pesto) sauce on a ciabatta the bun was awesome.  All burgers come with the choice of french fries, onion rings or potato salad (I had onion rings pretty awesome as far as onion rings go ;)

I do think however I would come back for some late night drinks in the bar area they are really cool looking and the setting, fire pits and appetizers are pretty good I hear!  That is why they are getting 3 stars instead of 2 because the ambiance and bar is I think the highlight of any locals trip!

I recently had a buffalo chicken wrap that was pretty much overly laden with ranch dressing and not alot of meat, or 'buffalo' style spicy sauce. My friend had a spinach and feta omelet that was not only cold, but flavorless. How that was achieved with feta in the mix, I am unsure. Overall it was unsatisfactory, but we were hungry and tired and went with it. I didn't finish my wrap, I gave it to a buddy and he complained of the excess ranch and lack of everything else as well. 

$81 for 3-4 entrees, some hot coffee and tea, and alot of ranch,. I am not rushing back.

My mom ordered the eggs benedict and her face of disappointment made me not even want to try it. She said it wasn't bad though, but my mom is usually too nice for her own good.

We settled in and took in the decor. Because they were busy and I had a screwdriver in front of me, we didn't make any note of the time. My wife commented that the place looks like the back of Sammy Johns' 1973 Chevy van. Wonderfully kitschy.

Our waitress took our order and made great suggestions, because I had trouble deciding what I wanted. They were excellent suggestions. My wife had a pesto chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread. I ordered Munch's breakfast.

Both dishes were huge and easily could have been split between us. I dove into my plate, hash browns mixed with onions, mushrooms, peppers and linguica, topped with eggs. I enjoyed it so much that I never even asked for a bite of the sandwich. I know she enjoyed it because she kept nibbling on it even after the point of immobility.

My husband and I have always made a special trip to the Peppermill every time we're in Vegas, so naturally, we picked it as the location for our rehearsal dinner. I called to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance. I even wrote to them on their site to ask about the availability of a vegan meal for one of my guests. I never got an email or call back, by the way. 

When I called to make the reservation for 6 people, I confirmed with the manager about a vegan meal. I called back a week later to add 2 more people to my reservation, and change my time to 6PM. So it was confirmed, TWICE. When we got to the Peppermill, they had no reservations for us. The hostess said we would have to wait with everyone else and made no apologies for the mistake. She even said they do not accept reservations, even though it says they do on their site and I called and did so! I asked to speak with a manager. The manager had no explanation and was actually rude about it. Our party had to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, which defeated the purpose of me making reservations in the first place. Then, once we ordered, my meal and my husband's meal was served 20 minutes after everyone else in my party's meal. 

This was the worst experience I have ever had at the Peppermill. My reception dinner was ruined. I was so embarrassed by the poor service and the rudeness of the hostess and manager, especially after we told everyone what a great place this was. I can't see myself dining there again.

4172877,2012-01-01,4,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I'm in utter disbelief that I haven't written about the Peppermill yet. I heard my first mention of this joint on an episode of ""CSI"" and I was interested. I saw my idol Tony Bourdain meander his way here and I was hooked. I took my first glance of the Peppermill's interior and I was obsessed. Am I a coke-fueled old school glam slam Vegas princess? ...Maybe. But I sure do love this place!

The food is generally hit or miss, but believe you me the portions are GIGANTIC. You should either probably split a selection with somebody else in your party or prepare for a ridic amount of leftovers. You have been warned.

My two favorite dishes here are the seafood omelette (Mediterranean I think it's called) and the Corned Beef Hash with basted eggs and all the fixins. Again, we aren't talking Michelin-star quality, but the ingredients are definitely fresh, plentiful, and made to your liking.

But the absolute best part of the Peppermill? C'mon... the entire joint is draped in mirrors, fake foliage, year-round multi-colored Christmas lights, neon trim lighting, and a dark carpeting fit for a fab downtown casino floor. The lounge itself -- which looks deceivingly large thanks in large part to those mirrors -- is a trip, and definitely one of my top ten Vegas landmarks in my heart.

That single fire pit is captivating, sexy, mysterious, and gaudy all at once -- and I promise one glance and a slippery lil drink between your fingers, and you'll fall truly madly deeply in love like I have. Everyone is also very sweet, and although some have mentioned the spotty service, I've experienced nothing but the utmost courtesy and efficiency.

Don't let the place fool you. Get in here, be prepared to eat, be especially prepared to fall head over heels for the Peppermill. My kinda Vegas.",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,6,5,5,USOXs_gSQrEYSn0SDC1y1A

 I think the first customer was the jolly green giant and they just never changed the portion sizes! 
The waiter was super cool and nice. I forgot his name..""sorry cool dude"", but he was telling us jokes and gave us advice on ordering one meal for two. That was very nice of him because he was soooooo right! 
My husband decided to make up his own alcoholic beverage that didnt have a name so the bartender was nice enough to come to our table and treat him like VIP mixing his drink the way he wanted..so either she came because she was super nice like the waiter or she wanted to get a look at the weirdo (aka my husband) that didnt know the name of the drink he was thinking of! haha 
Anyway. We had a full family mixed with adults and kids and everybody was very nice to us. Got our food fast (I think about 9 of us total and our food was ready in about 20-25mins) We all were pleased and fat at the end of the visit.

As we enter the lounge we were set back by the décor that seem not to have been updated from the mid 80's, but it worked.

None of the music was dated I say past 87' but as I said it worked. A mix of locals getting off work and tourist coming and going we ended up drinking and eating for about another 3-4hrs.

The decor is so bad it's bad; a nightmare of plastic plants covering every available surface lit by dim but still remarkably gaudy neon. Imagine if Big lots sold a furniture line they called Gothic rainbow. Now imagine you're looking at it through purple shades and that's what the place looks like in daylight. They also have Tiffany style lamps with flamingos on them - someone should go to jail for that. Did I mention the ceiling is covered in black mirror tiles?

Went here with one of my buddies after night one of Vegas.  We knew that going to something at the Grand would be expensive and probably not very good, so we asked the door guys for the best restaurant in the neighborhood.  They both agreed the Peppermill was the spot.  It's also close to many places on the strip, a ~5 dollar uber ride or 10 dollar cab ride for us.  

While we were on our way, I was anticipating this quaint little diner, maybe some knick knacks on the walls, etc.  Well, I was mistaken to say the least.  Going in here, everything is neon and mirrors.  That being said, it was 7 in the morning (we were on Florida time still) and the place had plenty of people, so it was a good bet this place was legit.

The menu itself is impressive.  So many different varieties of breakfast food.  I got the French Toast Ambrosia, which is just, enormous.  Whoever can eat this in one sitting is clearly contributing to the national health care crisis.  The french toast was very good, not too heavy.  However, it is laden with whipped cream and about 5 different kinds of fruit, so it will fill you up.  The half a liter of syrup I added to it may have contributed to its density as well.  The fruit is good and fresh.  It's not mind blowing, but this is a LOT of food for a great price and, if you're staying at a hotel or something, you can bring back leftovers and have several breakfasts or share with friends.

If you're in the area, bring your sunglasses and come down here to grab a bite.  It's a great way to escape the hotels and have some good food in a more local-type Vegas atmosphere.",w1LvqHwsBKovvSKstzoflA,3,2,4,vdzLRAGUnVlAgU23tlnxjg

Because everything just looked like a big blob of mess, I got full after eating 1/4th of the dish. The hash browns were definitely crispy and good! But the scrambled eggs and everything in it was too mushed together. I wish it was made separately rather than throwing it all in together. ($13)

My boyfriend's dish was good! The pancakes were a bit too crumbly. But other than that, the bacon and eggs were good! Like a regular breakfast plate. ($13)

The fruit ""salad"" was just a bowl of honeydew and cantaloupe and one single grape. Maybe I'm wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such. That's like saying a lettuce and croutons is a salad. Not to me it ain't.

I think my party and I should have headed into the lounge after our meal, since that seems to be all the rage. I'm not sure why we didn't.

You definitely get your monies worth. And the prices were dirt cheap might I add. I couldn't even attempt to eat all of my food. 

I ordered a Scorpion cocktail as well. It was huge! You could definitely share it with 2 people. And the biggest perk is that you can take it with you to go if you don't finish it all in the restaurant.

There are more mirrors and neon lights INSIDE this place than in probably all of the rest of Vegas combined.  It's fairly quiet so you can usually get a decent booth.  

Be warned that the portions are ridiculously large.  That goes especially for their desert sundaes which I never understand why I order because I never finish the entire thing.

Next, I suggest the chicken-fried steak. It's probably the least healthy thing you will order on the menu, but you can feel better about yourself when you see the broccoli and cauliflower on the plate.

Con: Slightly over price food in the Peppermill Restaurant, crazy lights in the Peppermill, so so food. 

Went to the Peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course Hazel's review. Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. 

So, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. 

The hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. 

We walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. 

The food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot.

And like the strawberry Pina colada. 

Giant portions especially for breakfast. All egg breakfasts come with at least 3 eggs and the omelets look like 5 eggs. If you get the side order of cottage cheese, it's a lot. Around 2 cups.

Vegas may have grown and evolved but this place stays the same. I have eaten here many times over the years. Recently I stopped in for breakfast and met Mary the night manager. I could not believe how nice she was considering all of the crazy drunk people she has to deal with during those hours. 

I stopped in to grab a carry out menu but they were out of them. Mary grabbed me a real menu and a pencil and paper so I could write down my order for the next day. I told you she was nice.  I called the next morning to place my order and Mary remembered me. I did a veggie omlette but I went all Sally from ""Harry met Sally"" on them. I went egg whites, no salt, no mushrooms and substituted to Swiss cheese.  Yeah I was that pain in the butt special order guy. I even asked for crispy hash browns. Mary took my order on the phone and even read it all back to me. She also told me my food would be ready in 10 minutes. 

I was finishing my run and headed over to grab my food. I was amazed at how fast I was able to get my food. Mary even went out of her way to get my hash browns really crispy. I saw her giving a little shout towards the cook. You go Mary!

My food was really hot and there was tons of it. I actually couldn't eat it all and saved half of it in my hotel fridge. Hey it's a desert out here, so food hoarding is acceptable here!  Everything was great. The hash browns were really rich.  I think they were cooked in butter. Mmmm...butter!!! I did have to use a few napkins to soak up the oil spill. The omlette was cooked perfectly but again it was huge. Big enough for two people to share. So keep that in mind when you eat here!

Located down the strip almost across from Circus Circus, it is a little nostalgic gem among all the grand new hotels and restaurants.  From start to finish this place did not disappoint.  The inside was eclectic bordering between 60's and 80's vibes; fully of cool neon with a diner type feel.  The menu was massive, and so are the portions.  We had the shrimp cocktail to start which was delish, with five jumbo shrimp I should have just had a salad after to save room for dessert.  But I didn't.  My husband ordered the NY strip, I had chicken.  Both meals come with salad and the portions were so huge we should have just split a meal .  The food was really really great, my chicken was tender and the sauce flavorful.  Mashed potatoes were *real* and not sure why since they were just mashed potatoes but SO good.

The drink menu has some interesting and fun cocktails, we ordered a Scorpion which was 2 person cocktail (although I drank 3/4 myself) and it was wonderful.  Service throughout was on point.

There are some slot machines in the little lobby area, my husband ended up winning 200 bucks on a nickel machine while we were waiting on an Uber.

Luckily I was able to come back to Peppy-mill. First rule of vacationing in Vegas or in general is to fully explore where you are so you don't have to go thru an epic battle to get back to it later. I had been here the week before to spend some quality time in the lounge. While you can order food in the lounge (not just the fruit salad in your drink), the restaurant is a whole different experience. I was in the lounge the week before and I had to go back to the restaurant part.

I've been on a mission this particular week, looking for people I worked with. 

The food is incredible, you can see by the pics. Everything IS over the top, but it was already that way if it makes sense. Restaurants now try to make everything over the top with what I call Epic Menu. It's already been spoofed online and in tv. You have millions of ""mash up"" options can get combos that don't make sense just to be creative (i.e. burger taco?). Restaurant developers have gone crazy from all the cooking shows on tv trying to come up with new trends. But here, they just have many... accessories? To things that make sense that you don't get at the national corporate graveyard restaurants. 

Something happened/s at this bar (meaning counter service, not the lounge, just went over this!) that I haven't encountered at any restaurant I've ever been to. The portions are so huge, if you go by yourself, you will have leftovers. That's given. 

So, I have been to the counter by myself before. This is probably the only restaurant I regret going to by myself because I always enjoy going with a committee of people, we always wind up sharing and sampling each other's food. And that's because the 32 volume leather bound menu can give you an indecisive aneurism when ordering. 

One of the first times I ate here was with a group of Goths I started hanging out with. There was one who decided to go to the empty booth next to us and push her breasts against the window. And while everyone was stupid enough to not take a picture of this (this was back when we still could have put it on myspace), the memory of it struggles and blurs every time I try to rethink of it. I just remember black and lace and... volume. I did go on to date her after months of hanging out ""as friends."" and it was damn worth it. I have to mention the best off the menu special I ever got here, amirite? 

So, at the counter, hungover one night by myself, I had a bunch of leftovers and I seriously doubted it would make the long journey home. I was walking since my motorcycle was possibly at Sahara, or Stratosphere, that kind of night. A couple of seats down this cute couple of girls were also finishing their meals with 2/3's left over as well. They asked me if I wanted to scoot over and help them finish. And then we ate our meals, hey-ooo! See what I did there? They were on vacation and their next trip, we got together again. You probably know I love Peppermill, right? 

There was one more story I wanted to tell, but you get the idea of how great this place is. We went here the night they imploded Stardust. I'll have to figure out where I can continue that story unless I want to do a clearly obsolete review of Stardust? the only place more over the top than the Peppermill is the Peppermill CASINO in Reno. My best attempts would underdescribe that LSD farm.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,3,3,5,mZioe-UQXJ4pOSZG9rDzEg
4414022,2011-04-22,12,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Buffets are overrated and the free breakfast at your mid-budget hotel is just cellophane bagels and hard-boiled eggs.  Solution?  The Peppermill.  It's freestanding, not buried in some casino, so you can park for free and be in the door right away.  If there is a wait, go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary.  It will quiet the demons.  

Upon entering, you will see that the pink, purple, and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco-ball mirrors lining the ceiling. Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin's quinceanera in 1986.  The flamingo-patterned Tiffany-esque lampshades are the essence of class, as are the velour booths.  On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor.

If you think all this sounds cheesy, I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky, crazy, pristine clean.  Yes, there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere.  It is a lovely, inviting restaurant.  If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn, you will know what I am talking about: well-maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone-bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing.  

The breakfast portions are enormous.  The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12.  Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full.  The hash browns are crispy, not soggy or greasy.  

These are restorative foods.  Combined with the Peppermill's professional, attentive service, you can feel your hangover receding with each bite.  I always leave the Peppermill ready for my day's events, whether sunburning by the pool, shopping in the outlets, hiding in a dark hotel room watching ""Ladyhawke,"" gambling away my retirement savings, or braving the gridlock on the 15.

It's as old school as it gets.  You can easily imagine mobsters and movie stars mingling around here a few decades ago, drinking large colorful cocktails and oversized martinis.  Which is exactly why I've wanted to go here forever.  

While the food was pretty good, it's all a little too much for the morning.  It's too much food (way too much).  It's too much to have cocktail waitresses pushing drinks in sexy costumes in the early am.  And after a while, all the tacky and gaudy eventually got to me and I just wanted to get somewhere I didn't suspect the same air has been circulating for the last 45 years.

The Flintstones-sized food:
Biscuits and gravy for my niece - in a bowl as big as her head
A piece of ham steak for my brother - larger than his head and requiring two hands to lift the plate
A side of scrambled eggs with cheese for me - I really only wanted one egg as I like a light breakfast...  but their ""side order of egg"" is actually THREE eggs.  
A spinach omelet for my SIL that looked great but was also ginormous.

Look, everything was good.  It's just TOO TOO much --  unless you're planning on going from breakfast right back to bed (and maybe that's your plan - I don't judge).  We had a full day of sightseeing planned and there is just no way you can even make a dent in these portions and expect to be ambulatory right after.   Trying to order ""light"" doesn't work either - they are determined to feed you until you cannot move at the Peppermill.  I felt bad about all the food waste --  normally I take food home and make several meals out of it, but that isn't practical when you're sightseeing all day and staying in a hotel.  

Oh, and there is someone that comes around and tries to take your picture.  This is one of the most annoying things a restaurant can do.  

All this abundance doesn't come cheap.   Breakfast for 4 with coffees/sodas was over $70 before tip.  If you really need to be in a food coma, this is a way to do it.

It wasn't really close to our hotel but the yelp pictures we saw made it seem so much more elegant than it was. The outside of the building looked pretty outdated, but I didn't want to judge a book by it's cover. At first glance it reminded me of a cheap diner. We walked in and told it was a 30 min wait for a table of 3. In the meantime, we went to the lounge to wait which is what really lost me. It was super dark, the tables were dirty as well as the velvet like booths. It just looked dingy and dirty, but the fire they had going was beautiful! Our waiter came and asked us what we wanted/clean the table as soon as we sat down... Of course we didn't know what we wanted as we had just gotten there. Probably took her 20mins to come back and right after we ordered our name was mentioned over the intercom. After getting our table she closed our tab and we moved over to the dining area. 

After all that, why am I giving a 4 star? Because the food was great! Big portions, and amazing tasting food. We got the platter for the appetizer so we could taste a little bit of everything and it was all good! After that I was full so I just did the turkey sandwich which was also amazing.

4447954,2015-05-18,2,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Quite a disappointing experience.

I went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the Rock in Rio festival. One of my friends who is a born and raised Las Vegan said The Peppermill is a Vegas staple and we HAD to go because my other friend and I have never been. By the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. The restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. We were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.

The ambiance is something else!! Probably the only positive about this place. Neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. I felt like I was in a different decade.

Our female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. I don't think she smiled once. We ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. We got a round of blue moons and ordered crab cakes, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings.

A different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. We closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. It didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. 

- Crab Cakes; Average, nothing special. I think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce 
- Buffalo Chicken Wings; Lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! Came with carrots and celery per usual
- Nachos; HUGE portion. Had cheese, jalapeños, black olives on top. The cheese was cold and dry. They gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. Not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. Also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. 
-  Mozzarella Sticks; The most disturbing part of my experience. I bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. I was grossed out but know that these things happen. When I reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. Hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?

We were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. The mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. Also, I don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. Also not worth hunting down service.

Needles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. If I were to ever come back, I would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,10,4,1,UA7hB4P0LnDPiWY1nr82IA

I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.

I was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.

The omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said ""about 10.""  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.

We didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.

This all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!

The inside is sorta cute. Comfy Boothe's and fun colors. Sort of a night club coloring but more if a diner vibe. They did a great job of fitting as much seating as they could and yet its still comfortable because they are booths and not tables on top of each other.
They had a TON of fake flowers all over the place. Even fake trees in the center. I really am not a fan of all that fake flower crap, the colors are usually off of real stuff. The fake stuff gets SO darned dusty, too, and that's just plain gross especially in a restaurant environment. The one fake ivy thing by me didn't feel dusty, but we were still thankful we weren't stuck under one of the trees.
They have a cocktail waitress, which kind of reminds you of old style Vegas. The cocktail we were handed didn't list Amy beer at all, so I had to wait for her to come to our table to find out what they had. 1 draft option, Stella, so I ordered it. Alas, they were out. So I ordered a bottles beer. Wouldn't it be the cocktail waitresses job to know that there's no Stella tonight?

The menu was what you'd expect in a diner, lots of choices and many fried.. And it was about the quality that you'd expect - we had cream cheese stuffed chicken with penne pasta and country fried steak with mashed potatoes. My hubby said the mashed potatoes were average and enjoyed the country fried steak. My cream cheese/herb stuffed chicken was fried and not too bad. LOADS of pasta, way more than one portion.

I mean I've never seen a banana split that big before. I guess I just wasn't expecting it. The waitress said it was big enough to share but dang it could feed a couple of people. Presentation wasn't too good. Couldn't even see the ice cream because of all the whipped cream but there was 2 scoops of ice cream for each flavor and you had to dig around for the banana. The strawberry shortcake was okay, not my cup of tea really. My banana split turned to soup because we couldn't finish it. Looking at the other tables all the plates were huge.

If you're in Vegas and you don't go to Peppermill, shame on you. And your momma. I am THAT serious. I was in the hunt for a brunch type restaurant that serves good bloody marys and Peppermill did not disappoint. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.

Ambience: 
As other reviewers have mentioned, the pink and blue neon lights give it a divey, strip club-esque vibe which I totally loved. There's a firepit in the center of the lounge area, complete with comfy seating and overhead TVs. There are several other TVs throughout the lounge. It's quiet, yet not awkward, perfect for the invariable hangover headache. Another plus: they're open 24 hours, so you *really* have no excuse.

Staff: 
The bartender was great, I wish I could remember her name. Very friendly, sincere and prompt. 

Food: 
The Fireside Lounge only offers food from the appetizer menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail ($12.95) and a bloody mary (~$7). The bloody mary was definitely tasty, came garnished with a cherry tomato, a cucumber slice and a celery stick. I asked for olives and the bartender obliged. The shrimp cocktail came with 6 large jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce, and what appeared to be shredded cabbage buried beneath the cocktail sauce. While the shrimp tasted great, they were a bit chewy/tough and may have been frozen a little too long. Also, I don't know that I would pay $13 for shrimp cocktail again.

All in all, the Fireside Lounge was the start to a perfect Vegas morning (if 1:15PM counts as morning when you're hungover).",InLqIX5bb2M7H724adkYVg,6,5,5,EQ7SNTtmKmty35lAbIHhjA

The service was good, servers are attentive, food comes out quickly.

The place had a few roudy people but it was a good place to hang-out. The only thing that I would recommend is to be able to move the table out a little because I felt I was in a tight booth.

Peppermill is definitely for the Adam Richman (Man Vs. Food host) in all of us. One would think with quantity, quality suffers but Peppermill definitely proves that adage wrong. Me and my sis always order pancakes, bacon, and the fruit&granola bowl: all are fantastic. The fruit&granola bowl is about the size of 2 banana splits. Pancakes are HUGE, over 12"" in diameter (at least) with a fluffy sweetness to them that beg for just a tiny amount of syrup when you dress them with the AWESOME ""stripper"" sugar sprinkles.

I definitely love this place. The blue neon and comfortable seating and long raised walkways turned into foliage.........somehow makes me believe Peppermill used to be a strip club in a former life.......but who knows ;-).

The service is quite fast and there is quite a few options to choose from. At 3AM I opted for a cup of coffee and ""Joe's San Francisco Special."" Basically, thats a few eggs, spinach, onions, ground beef & sausage, and topped with cheese sauce. Originally it includes hash browns mixed in there but I asked for them to set that aside since I wasn't so sure I wanted to eat them. You do get an option of toast but I chose to try their warm blueberry muffin! I'm so glad I went with that because it was the best part of the entire meal.  

The prices for breakfast are along the lines as a typical diner such as Norms or Denny's but their plates are much much larger here. Honestly, if you were to split a plate with someone, I think you would be better off. 

The coffee was watered down but then again if they're making so much of it, I can imagine this is not their main concern.

Good place to get a bite to eat if you're not in the mood to be picky. I can see how this place gets crowded after-hours as the ""meet up spot.""",Fxzv4iufRNIyPVO0XvKmWQ,0,0,3,dNBaY4Y-V3gJrwbthhIPTA

I got the Peppermill Pastrami Burger and wow. Fresh, cooked well, and they had onion rings as a side option at no extra charge! Onion rings are my favorite kind of rings. They were crunchy and the onion did not slide out when you take a bite. That's a sign of a good ring! The burger was tasty and not overly salty. Pastrami tends to be salty and I was afraid it would be too much, but it was seasoned well and really good. Would eat again!

My partner got the french dip and I only to try one bite because he devoured it. Very flavorful au jus and if my love for onion rings wasn't so strong - I would get the potato salad. Flavorful and fresh tasting. It wasn't heavy like some potato salad can be. It was a cool contrast to the hot sandwich.

So my traveling buddy and I decided to get a early breakfast here after a night of debauchery on the strip. The restaurant had a late 80's Magnum PI type vibe going with the decor. I could dig it. It was cute. We were seated and promptly given menus. I ordered a typical breakfast(scrambled eggs and pancakes, hash browns). My traveling partner ordered  steak, eggs, and hash browns. Our food came out in a timely manner and the portions were more than sufficient, but when I say those were the gummiest eggs I have ever tasted..... babeee, terrible. I really don't want to believe they were powered but those couldn't have been fresh or the hen was past her prime. The pancakes were equally eek and they felt like bricks hitting the bottom of my stomach, just heavy and tasteless no matter how mud I tried to make them edible, I just gave up.

My buddy was a little indisposed( i.e a little hammered), so she actually didn't eat her steak until the next day, but she said it was delicious!.

I absolutely love this place and no visit to Vegas is complete without it. Obviously, I can't give it higher than three stars because it's so cheesy, but I still love it. You enter through a standard diner (with pretty good cholesterol-heavy food) into a pink-and-blue-neon low-ceilinged room with a fire pit in the center. It's like passing from ""Alice"" into ""Fantasy Island"" to complete the '80s feel. I will give them points for the place always seeming very clean even though it's cluttered and hasn't been updated in an age (which is sort of the point). The plastic flower garland hanging everywhere isn't dusty and the cocktail servers in long black skirts slit up to the ying-yang are busy polishing the brass railings and plumping the cushions when not bringing drinks. The drinks aren't very good and tend to the sweet side on the cocktail menu. Hilariously, when I was last there, my buddy ordered a gin & tonic and the waitress asked, ""Would you like olives with that?"" He was a bit taken aback, but said, ""No, typically it comes with a twist. Gin and tonic, right?"" The waitress acknowledged the order and when she went to the bar, he turned to me and said, ""I will bet you money I'm about to get a gin martini."" Sure enough, he got a giant glass of gin with a twist of lemon it in. Thus was born the new drink, a Gin & Tonic-Hold the Tonic. This was a pretty basic fail, but it only makes you love the place more. It's kind of like your slightly mentally-challenged child--you can't help but have affection despite its issues.

Sour note: Since smoking is allowed, when there are various trolls puffing away at the bar, the low ceilings can make the smoke pretty oppressive.",G87zEbu0oPpYzmn4LUMC3g,0,0,3,Ze38-zXq-cFUmg0jElk9Jw
4652445,2017-12-26,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"My wife and I were staying at the Palazzo and wanted to get lunch away from the busiest part of the Strip. We heard that the Peppermill was a great place to go, so we decided to check it out.

There was about a twenty minute wait, so we went outside and walked around for a while. When we got back, there was only one table ahead of us and we were seated shortly after. 

The decor of the restaurant is truly unique. It felt like we were at a special event. That feeling was supported by the fact that someone was walking around taking commemorative pictures for each table. 

The menu was quite extensive and everything looked enticing. To help with our decision making, we looked around the restaurant at what order people had ordered. This did not help in the slightest as all of the food looked delicious and the portions were colossal. 

We ultimately chose an order of buffalo wings, gyros, onions rings, and three fried eggs. All of the food was really tasty. The wings were gigantic and had the perfect amount of heat to them. The gyro meat was flavorful and the pita bread was nicely toasted. The onion rings were piping hot and not greasy. Even though we were really hungry, we were still unable to eat all of our food due to the large portion size. 

While the food, service, and ambience were top notch, I am going to deduct a star for not accepting credit cards. Las Vegas isn't some small town in the middle of nowhere. There is no excuse to be cash only in 2017. We would have ordered drinks too if I wasn't capped by the cash in my wallet.

She was rude and not customer service oriented when I had brought visiting family members in for dinner this evening. After spending a hefty bill bringing in a party of 8. To start one meal was about 20 min late to the table after everyone else had received their entree. Which was fine when the waitress returned several times and insisted the meal would be right out. At the conclusion of dinner the bill was presented at a certain amount. When at the cash registered the total amount then jumped significantly. They explained the late meal was never added to the check and that was the increase in price (indicating the meal was never sent to the kitchen, if that was the case the server should have honestly communicated and we would have canceled the meal.) nonetheless Marie the manager was a total bitch and insisted we pay which we did.

The most amazing part is the fireside lounge where it's a round lounge around a fire that's on water.  It's truly amazing and reminds me of what a backroom of a strip club would look like if I were to go to those in Vegas (I haven't although I tried to once.. I swear!)

First, let me say that I don't like diner food, I detest ""breakfast"" foods (pancakes, waffles, maple syrup, sausages, etc.: OMG vom) and ""traditional"" ""American"" food barely qualifies as food IMO. (Pizza, burgers and chow mein: now THAT's American! Meatloaf and steak & eggs: ICK!) So to say that this is not the place for me is an understatement. It IS, however, open 24/7 and near-ish my hotel.

First trip: I ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portion size was not as big as a lot of places, but that's OK because it was gross. The sauce was gummy and didn't taste fresh, the few shrimp were large, but a little tough, and the noodles were not what you'd call al dente. The garlic bread with ""cheese"" on it was revolting.
My mum ordered the Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta. Hers was better than mine, though her penne was also overcooked. The sauce was pretty good, the red pepper strips were, I swear, Mezetta brand right out of the jar (but I like those), and they were right on the money when they described it as chicken stuffed with herbs and cream cheese; it tasted just like Philadelphia Cooking Creme Italian Cheese & Herb flavour.
Second trip: I ordered New York steak and Shrimp Scampi. I ordered it cooked medium, it was definitely well done. The shrimp were, too. My mother ordered some icky breakfast foods, so I didn't taste them, but she said they were OK.
I think if you like breakfast foods (served all day) and diner food, you'll like this place, but I will avoid it. The waitresses were cute and helpful, though. And the decor is amusing.",fEUjT3KXiXNv80jnfceGEA,0,0,2,LwUa6-bHJp9WZ4jItjoxwQ

For starters, the ""greeters"" were gossiping when we walked in, and halfway acknowledged us as they led us to our table. I realize they frequently have drunk people coming in after bars let out (2am-6am ish) but it's midnight and we are sober.

Our waitress was friendly, but couldn't tell me what percentage of fat was in the ground beef they use for the burgers. The cook went to the back and read the box, and said it was 75% fat. Haha, ok. That doesn't exist in real life, so I asked the waitress if she could please check, even though I correctly suspected they meant 25% fat. The kitchen staff appeared to be overly annoyed that I even asked, let alone requested a second look. Excuse me for caring about what I put into my body. At any rate, 75/25 chuck? Not exactly what I was expecting based on their trumped-up description on their menu.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries. It was good, until a large glob of what appeared to be someone's spit dripped out of the bottom of my wrap. My stomach turned and I couldn't eat another bite. I felt like vomiting as I used the wooden skewer to inspect the substance on the edge of my plate, which clearly was not a food product. Yep, definitely spit. Thankfully I spotted it before I bit into that area of the wrap!!!

I told the waitress, and she tried her best to act surprised. She told the manager, who came over to defend her staff, and tell me over and over ""they don't do that"" there. Right. Angry employees spit in food everyday in all types of restaurants. The manager offered something else (no thanks, don't need more spat-upon dishes). But, she didn't seem apologetic, nor was she able to explain what it was, if not spit. What ingredient in a grilled buffalo chicken wrap is the consistency and color of someone's nasal drip? None.

Nothing more was said, they just removed it from the bill. I will absolutely never return, and I will vehemently steer friends away from this place.

We came back the next day for some more drinks (it is Vegas afterall!) and some food. The Hawaiian Mimosas were amazing! Not sure if they were worth $10, considering you don't get much.

The bill came to $65.81. Certainly not the cheapest breakfast in town, but the large portions, ambiance, and great service was without a doubt worth it!

It's a popular spot after partying for diner faire. Not much else to say. The service has always been friendly and fairly attentive, even when it's packed at 1-2 in the morning. Waters get filled. Missing silverware is replenished if need be. I get my Tabasco before my meal arrives. Seating isn't too big of an issue either. Parking seemed not be much of a challenge on the weekends either. Don't let the pricing scare you, if the menu said it's $12 for an omelette, you really do get $12 worth of omelette and sides. Not a bargain compared to some other deals around the strip, but it's okay. If I had a choice to skip out on this place late at night and go elsewhere, I wouldn't mind. A change of pace from ""tradition"" or a routine wouldn't hurt anyone, especially in Vegas. If my friends want to go here, I still don't mind.

As for the food you get, it's not bad. It hits the spot at that time of the night. Always good times to crowd around a booth with a bunch of your buddies just to recap your night of partying and tell stories over a meal. LIke I said, the portions are huge. Unfortunately, having left overs in the middle of a Vegas trip isn't such a great thing since most hotel rooms don't have a fridge, let alone a microwave to reheat your food. If you're a normal eater, sharing your plate with someone else might be a good idea. Or if you're drunk and starving, perfect! I like the fact that a bran muffin is a choice as far as toast/muffin/biscuit options go with your breakfast. I usually save the muffin for the next morning for those really slow starts to the day. You know how it is when you party in Vegas. Sleep late, wake up late. Eat a ....bran muffin with your complimentary hotel coffee?",Znyys6bs0v9M4XmpWbm66w,0,0,3,65DtnYPWQjREIKxT8lypSw

The restaurant was decorated like a strip club without the poles. It was colorful and packed with people. I ordered steak and eggs and also crab cake, slave girl got the crab cake benny. 

The benny was OK. I actually didn't try it but slave girl said it wasn't bad. 

I asked my steak cooked to medium rare and it actually came out right! My only issue was part of the steak tasted bitter. Don't ask me how, but it did and I had no idea why. The only thing that really pissed me off was, I asked for over easy on eggs and it came out scrambled.

The crab cake was actually forgotten, well, not by the kitchen, but by our waitress. It came with 3 pieces and it was actually very tasty.

The service was shit. We got no water even after we asked for water. Our server never checked on us and we had to wave her over like in a Chinese restaurant. She forgot my crab cake and screwed up my egg order. When we were ready to leave, I couldn't get a box to pack my food since she was no where to be found. When I finally got up to get the box myself, our sever saw me and stopped me. She told me to return to my seat and would bring one to the table. THEN she came to the table empty handed, wtf? That was when she told me she wanted to pack it for me. At that point I didn't want to have extra stuff in my leftover so I asked for the box, again.

Imagine waking into a strip club but instead of strippers, you have diners. Even the sugar here is very colorful. 

Mink doesn't eat much so she found something on the menu that was just her portion size. Unfortunately our server told us that it's only available for kids and seniors. I felt that he could have made an exception but he didn't. Mink ended up ordering from the available menu and threw away 80% of her plate. What a waste. Positive note is portions are generous here. Mel C said they use 10 eggs for their omelette. 

I ordered their French Dip with a Hot Tea. There is no photo because they took forever to bring my order out. Everyone was eating already and I was hungry so I dug right in. Sandwich was decent and onion rings weren't too greasy. The au ju it came with was average. Meal was a little greasier than I'm accustomed to so my stomach was definitely not a fan.

Open 24/7, Peppermill is the perfect restaurant to stop at after a night of drinking. Or a great spot for breakfast (but expect a longgg wait.) The menu is bountiful in choices and its safe to say there's something for everyone. Portions are very large and can usually be shared, and for such large portions are worth the price.

If you're in Vegas, add this place to your list! Call ahead to see if there's a wait & if there is, order to go! The food is comforting and always hits the spot.

We were also helped immediately by our waiter, also - a pretty bar girl taking alcoholic requests and got approached by the Staff photographer who insisted the photo is free. This was the hugest problem we had with Peppermill since she INSISTED the photo is free - to take! To have is $20 for one copy, $25 for a second. Um, sorry, that's not a deal when the first is overpriced at $20! 

We wanted some light bites and got the appetizer platter (substituted the Shrimp for more cheese sticks), and got the Fruit Boat for $18.99 with a side of cottage cheese. It was all fine with a cool presentation with a great waiter.

After any buffet, Egg Works, and Hash House were all shot down for having too large of portion sizes, I finally sold them on the Peppermill, largely by promising them neon.

Pros: 
 - Damn tasty diner food and freely flowing cups of coffee. This is all I really ask for in a solid Brunch Experience
-Super friendly staff and prompt service, and no problems with slightly different orders and keeping coffee coming.
- The look on my friends' faces when they realized this place didn't have small portions either! Oh noes, mah dietz. I laughed and laughed and laughed/

Cons:
- Long wait, really with no where to sit and wait. We hung out on a curb and were frequently asked if we needed a cab.
- Prices were a bit on the high side relative to the awesomeness of the food. Got the impression I was paying for the neon. Wasn't too bad, but also nothing to compose a sonnet over.

Overall Verdict:
- Yummy classic diner food in a classically vegas atmosphere. Will return when hungover, or with out of town and unadventurous guests. Won't be on the favorites anytime list, but certainly not shabby.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,2,0,3,8JBnbS1GrbXBaRLSL5cQig

It was Sunday, a few hours before we had to fly home. We usually like to hit someplace unique to vegas, something like hash house a go go or oyster bar before flying home. The cab driver mentioned Peppermill and since we have always heard great things decided to try it. Nothing was bad, but everything was just ordinary, except maybe the size of the plates. Peppermill burger was just ho hum, chicken fried steak and eggs - no different from anything else. The interior was cool, waitress was awesome.

Many memories of the Peppermill, from the fruit on the plate,  huge portions,  neon lights,  waitresses in short skirts,  cocktailers in long dresses.   The Vegas restaurant is almost identical,  so it was a blast from the past!   One huge difference was there was a long line of people to get in,  long wait times for a table.   If Marin's Peppermill had that issue,  they probably would have stayed in business!   We were able to get a seat at the counter immediately,  and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  We split the omelet,  hash browns,  English muffin,  and a giant pancake side.  Definitely share/split meals here!   Service was quick and friendly.   

We really wanted to have a drink at the fire pit in the bar,  but it was being fixed.   The cocktail menu had all the classics,  and I was so looking forward to a Ramos fizz.   Next time for sure!

Also, she offered to box up our food... but didn't give us one of our leftover meals.  Small mistake, but I had almost an entire sandwich and plate of fries that she didn't give is.

Open 24 hours? Check.
""Interesting"" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check.
American-sized portions? America, Fuck Yeah -- CHECK.
Indoor firepit? Check.

As Damon H mentions, the food is ""surprisingly very good.""  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.

The wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)",-2UOdDlzg7XLuUuyOrldhA,3,2,4,CT1JQFZ0moWYTMNb1qP3mQ

Today, the place was hopping.  And so were the waitresses, who were wearing their tight skirts that fit right into the Vegas old school.  Lots of blue neon lights.

I take a seat at the counter. Yes, the service here is a little slower, but hey, I was in no hurry.  Finally, my waitress offers me drink and a menu.   I look at the menu and have a hard time figuring out what I want because of the various options.  I pick the French Toast Ambrosia. A few minutes later, my long-legged waitress Jennifer brings me this plate of french toast that is covered with fruit and what looks like a half can of whipped cream.  I'm thinking, how in the world am I going to eat all this?  And as I look around, everyone else is being served huge volumes of food also.  At that moment, I decided that I am going to the Peppermill every time I go to Vegas and I'm bringing my friends.

i am not gonna lie. at first i was a bit skeptical. after spending a few too many hours gambling at the $5 blackjack tables at circus circus the night before i happened across this place on my way back the wynn.  maybe it was the bitterness from the money i lost. maybe it was the on-setting alcohol poisoning. whatever it was, i was less than impressed.

ladies and gentlemen of yelp. i implore you. do not judge a book by its cover. because this place is a gem. i ordered nachos. (my new go to for late night eats). a platter of nachos the size of a sewer lid was placed in front of me. and they were delicious. in fact they gave me exactly what i needed: greasy, fatty, awesomeness.  i could not even finish half. i am not even joking. and the nachos were not the only large portioned meal. there were more leftovers on the table than food in our collective stomachs. 

so a few tips for your next vegas visit:

1.) drink and dance until about 6 am 
2.) go to the peppermill
3.) order the nachos
4.) enjoy the deliciousness

this last time would be the exception. Ms. Elisha was my bone of contention even prior to seating.

when the food was ready it was damn near tossed in the table.. we did not see her again until the receipt was ready.. she literally in passing tossed the receipt on the table almost in my husbands plate.. I stopped smiling at that point.. she saw the expression on my face change.. because I was fed up.. so she did decided to turn around and come back to the table and give some    Insincere ass attempt at service recovery.. but it was too late.. you don't throw things.. and you don't behave as if someone is bothering your ass while you're at work..

This place is both trashy and elegant all at once and while the cocktail waitresses wear these wonderfully ironic evening gowns, the place is like a gussied-up diner.  Very Tarantino.  Finish your obscenely large meal (my ""side"" caesar and fettuccine alfredo could have easily fed 2.5 adults... not going to count how many day's calories went  down the hatch on that one), then mosey on into the Fireside for a cocktail in what feels like an early 1980s Central American druglords's den.  I loved it!  It felt like a strip club without the strippers.  The music got so loud at some point that no one sitting with me could actually communicate within a normal decibel range, but I'm pretty sure we were crashing a private party, so I guess I shouldn't complain.

Just a little background...This was our 1st trip to Vegas and we visited the Peppermill based on a suggestion from my husband's co-worker. 

When we first walked in, the cheap decor and tacky waitresses caught my eye. There were a few of slot machines (of course) crammed in a small corner, neon lights, cheap plastic plants, and waitresses wearing orthopedic shoes. Because the Restaurant sells drinks, they have a ""cocktail waitress"" who was dressed as if she were going to the prom (on a budget). 

We were finally seated after waiting 45 minutes, it was Saturday around noon, so it was to be expected. The service here was not good. The waitress was unattentive and forgetful, however the food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I ordered to Lorraine Omelet and my hubby ordered some sort of scrambler. The food was seasoned to perfection and the portion sizes were ridiculous. I literally ate on my food for 2 days and wound up throwing it away. I ordered a pancake on the side and it was literally the size of a 20' rim.

If you are looking for great food with large portion sizes, this is the place.

Instead, what came out was a bunch of waitresses wearing these horrible, ill-fitting, grossly-pastel-colored, school-girl jumpers.  Weird spin on the vibe.

All grease.  Total meh.  (The Caesar salad, for instance, was mostly dressing, with a bit of limp lettuce.)  And for the price, ""meh"" is not acceptable.  If I want meh, I can go to MehcDonalds.  (See what I did there?;)

The drinks were water.  
I am not convinced there was any alcohol in their tequila sunrise.   And when you can get $2 well drinks at the Riviera one door down, why go here?

No, it's not new, extremely clean, or filled with gorgeous modern decor, it is more along the lines of Vegas in the 70's, at least everything I can imagine that was good about Vegas in the 70's:)  I once heard that this is one of the oldest operating businesses in Vegas but I'm not sure if that is true.

Their bloody mary's are delicious, the portions are large, and they have a large selection of finger type snack foods,  which is good after a drunkin' or somehow otherwise intoxicated evening:)  The service is always top notch and the waitresses, no matter what age, are all attractive and wear long black dresses.

This place is a Las Vegas icon.  Over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including Elvis.  I'm glad that I've visited this place more than once.  

To be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  The lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  Full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  Thank goodness it's a historic location of Las Vegas.  

My drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  For the appetizers, we got a crap load.  I'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:

-Shrimp Cocktail for $12.95:  Nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.

-Chicken Quesadillas for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!

-Chicken Nachos for $16.25:  Lots of items.  This was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  Sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.

-Bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  This was actually flavorful and moist.  One of my favorites!

-Chicken fingers for $10.25:  Your standard pub fingers.  Kind of dry.

-Caprese salad for $8.95:  Sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  The slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!

I know I'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  Our group was pretty big!  At the end of the day, it was your standard pub food.

This was our first time here. We walk in. No hostess at the stand. 2 of them talking amongst each other arguing... what were they arguing about? They were arguing about which one of them was going to seat us. We can here them. ""Its your turn!"" ... ""No, its your turn!"" ....  Im already getting a bad vibe. My wife ask them...""Should we just seat ourselves?"" The hispanic looking one acts like she didnt see us.. ""Oh im sorry, how many in your party?""

I see another waitress holding a baby trying to put it to sleep. I know this is a place of business, a restaurant business not a day care. It looked very unprofessional. 

As im paying the bill (have to take the tab by the entrance) and there are slot machines. More kids and they're sitting in front of the slot machines. Some climbing on the chairs.

There aren't many places on the Strip my wife and I like to bring the kids, but The Peppermill is one place my wife and I like to bring the family for lunch that serves up great diner fare and tremendously big portions of classic Vegas ambiance.

(A note here about the Fireside Lounge. It's awesome, and if you're looking for a weird place for a drink that isn't in a casino, it's really a must-visit. Fire pits and scorpion bowls. Awesome. But keep in mind, adults only.)

The Peppermill is a restaurant of all booths, and other than high-chairs and the chairs along the counter, there isn't a single free-standing chair in the whole place. Vegas is all about making everyone feel special, and as everyone loves a booth, everyone gets one. And like I mentioned, they do provide the standard restaurant high-chairs that pull up to the end of the booth. All the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.

The menu is similar to the best of NYC diners. Namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. As for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. There are chicken fingers, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. The prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. And don't forget, you're in Vegas so The Peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays. 

As for the service, here in Las Vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years I've been going there I've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.

We walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. That was ok since it's Christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. But we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. We had 4 (yes I'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! I get it that's a money maker. We order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. 
Our waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again I get it! It Christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. But then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after I've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. I guess he could tell from my facial expression that I was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. We order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried chicken fingers, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), buffalo chicken wrap and nachos. The sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! I huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! It was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). 
It came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! 
So we ate a little bit of this and that Just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! We asked for a few boxes and the check! The waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. He kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and I kept telling him NO! That all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. He tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. On our check we were charged for the sunrise something and I wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!

All in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care AT ALL what you put into your body! I can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. I'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that I've had with both food and service. You're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance!

We went in the early afternoon during a week day. It was busy and I took that as a good sign. We patiently waited as people in the waiting area were seated. But, as the time passed, we were not getting seated. Party after party of 2,3,4,5,6 people, who came in after us, were seated. We spoke to the hostess who said it would be a couple more minutes. Again, people just coming into the restaurant are being seated almost immediately. 

We eventually did get seated and I was hoping the food would turn this into a positive experience. Nope. Yes, the portions are big. However, having a lot of food is pointless when the food does not taste good.  I got a BBQ Burger- it was dry and the BBQ sauce had a weird taste to it. Someone in my party ordered breakfast, so I tasted the hash browns. They were half cooked and flavorless.

The service was ok. The waitresses looked miserable.  It didn't seem like they had enough people working. The downside of having an open kitchen is that when you're sitting nearby, you can hear all of the staff complaints and arguments.

Ok, maybe the Vegas locale, on the north end of the strip and away from the more posh atmosphere of Tao and a million Wolfgang Puck spinoffs, isn't for everyone. But then again, Peppermill is right across the street from Circus Circus and right next to the Riviera, and away from the worst of the Strip traffic.

My girlfriend and I went to Peppermill on the recommendation of a friend, someone who lives here in Las Vegas, always a good sign. Once you enter the place, you're immediately struck by a cunning mix of modern and retro, neon lighting in a darkened room, and waitresses in bright colours and miniskirts. 

We were seated quickly and immediately introduced to our waitress, who was friendly and helpful, and soon followed by the cocktail waitress, dressed to the nines in a flowing black dress but still very comfortable. She helped us choose drinks and returned with them fast, checking on us several times throughout the meal.

My girlfriend got a grasshopper and I tried a Blue Hawaiian, big and fruity and bright blue - it also packed a good kick. No watering down here, I guess!

For our meals, she tried the pork chops and eggs, which came with a generous portion of hash browns and a muffin, while I tried the pastrami burger with (I was delighted to find) curly fries. We finished off with an ""Elegant Brownie,"" a positively massive dessert of warm brownie, hot fudge, and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection - a little bit of pink in the middle of my medium burger, eggs with just slightly runny yolks, crispy fries and hashbrowns, and a delightfully messy dessert that was plenty for two to share.

And the whole meal, drinks and dessert included, came in at just about $50 all told. Not bad at all for a wonderful experience and a whole lot of great food.

The atmosphere itself is a mix between a 70s lounge and an 80s arcade. Very cool. Plus they serve liquor, which is a huge plus. I found the Bloody Mary, while quite generous in size, a little lacking in flavor for my tastes. The Coronaritas however were completely awesome.

Note:  this is a breakfast review (served 24 hours a day) based on 20+ visits.

Come hungry.  1lb flame grilled, bone in ham steak and three eggs and half dinner plate serving of crispy hash browns (or  pile of toast, giant muffin, or entire bagel with cream cheese).  Not enough eggs? add a side of additional three eggs for just $3.95.  Eggs Benedicts with not two but THREE poached eggs atop a split English muffin, a pile of Canadian bacon, buttery hollandaise and those incredible hash browns again.

Giant omelets folded and filled with a wide range of staples from chicken or turkey breast, sausage, or shrimp to artichokes, fresh spinach, peppers and tomatoes all made gooey with  jack, cheddar, provolone, parm, or even feta cheese.  Zero complains.

Greasy spoon French toast made from thick slices of Texas toast quick dipped in a cinnamon, vanilla custardy mixture.  Three eggs, two strips of bacon two link sausages sit alongside.   The carbcakes, errr, pancakes, 14"" giants.  Three golden, fluffy, buttermilk disks that hit the spot.  As a combo, add the two eggs, bacon and sausages.

Go during daylight hours and it will always be crowded.

Tip:  Put your name on the list, and go to the lounge, light up a machine for $20 and play some video poker or keno to pass the time as you enjoy a giant, spicy bloody Mary (lubing the system or hair of the dog).  Don't forget your 10 percent tip for the bartender if you hit.

Very friendly diner service.

Sure, nothing is specially sourced, nothing heirloom or organic, no claims about hormones or non GMO.  Sulfates, nitrates, phosphates abound but so what?

The front end was nice and did a great job dealing with all the hangry (hungry and angry) people. However, the service was a bit off once we were seated.

Our orders came out all together which was nice; none of that awkward waiting and watching for others to get their plates. I got the Eggs Benedict which was pretty good and priced at at about $13. I liked how the hollandaise sauce tasted. It was a bit tangier than others I've had in the past.  The eggs were poached nicely and ran lovely through my crispy hashbrowns. My friends tried numerous things such as the club sandwich, the BLAT sandwich, and an omelette all of which was pleasing.

5155986,2008-02-12,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Two cliches apply to the Peppermill: everything you've heard is true, and words can't describe it.

There's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. It's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s/80s neon hybrid. The pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. Recently several huge monitors were added to the entry/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. A new one pops up every few minutes. Times Square, then Tokyo, then whitewater rapids. It's like a postmodern vacation.

The lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. The bar offers traditional seating. Be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. Pace yourself!

The restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. Here even the menu is huge. I can recommend the Old-Fashioned Belgian Waffle, the Western Fruit Plate, the hamburgers, and the Nachos Nachos Nachos. This is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.

The prices look a little spendy, but when measured against portion size, they're a geat value for a Strip experience like this. Go, and be prepared to be tempted to buy a bag of pink & blue sparkly table sugar as a souvenir.",c33Z36u5N8h5JgYsnweXlw,3,5,5,Jzvg5O8w0ov-ZQxmxOJQyg

Some people actually get to eat under the canopies of the fake trees.  All the waitstaff are dressed up in some way.  The cocktail waitresses have these shmexy long gowns, the waitresses have short skirts and suspenders, and the waiters have a male version of the suspenders.  They show less skin, though. Too bad. 

This place is known not only for its Vegas-y vibes, but also for its large portions!  Most of our group struggled to finish their meals, but a long day of competition worked wonders on my appetite. That mushroom burger didn't stand a chance.  And the milkshakes? GINORMOUS. In general, I'd say food quality is mediocre, but they give you such a large quantity that I feel most people would be inclined to take half of it home. (I love leftovers) Also, for those of you who are into the brekky-for-dinner thing, breakfast is served all day long.

Omelets made of dinosaur eggs (probably), ice cream scooped using shovels and a fruit plate that could have been used for a company party. Amazing and just hilarious. The Peppermill omelet, as big as it was, tasted very good. Loved the hash browns too. The banana split was right on - QUALITY ice cream and bananas.

Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: ""Man, I would love a good salad."" (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)

Following some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are impressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.

In addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a ""romantic flaming pool"", and hot pink is the design scheme. Might as well call it ""heaven"".

The Peppermill is considered to be a LV institution with extremely kitschy decor (think of fake trees, neon lights and vinyl wrap-around booths). It's right across the street from Circus Circus, giving it somewhat of a creepy vibe at night. This area of the strip just feels dead now. 

My review is based mainly on the food, which was surprisingly lackluster. I expected it to be at least better then IHOP, but it reminded me of Denny's. I ordered a cheeseburger that was pretty greasy and my friend's salad was made out of iceberg lettuce with huge piles of fruit that looked unappetizing. My sweet potato fries were okay, but tasted like they were previously frozen.

He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices... But like any horror film, against our better judgement, we follow the leader through the back door of the puppymill PEPPERMILL...  we walk in through the back, enter this room filled with fake trees, bright pink couches and pillows and a smoking atmosphere... no, literally... you can smoke in here. There's a beautiful fire pit lounge with blue flames. The waitresses there are dressed in long black gowns and smiling faces. The cocktails are priced well-- the company was established 72 years ago... totally cool feel. It's like you're in an old movie with mobsters relaxing and sipping on gin... except most people are tourists in there. Beau and i didn't order any food, though I've heard it's perfect for late night snacks. Our drinks were great but the atmosphere was awesome. So perfect for the feel of the restaurant. You never would have guessed that the interior would have contrasted to greatly from the exterior. Super cool place. And then we thanked our driver that we got out alive... ;-)",kEGxd8n3IpWLeOgy3H6pZQ,2,2,4,ZFSBSvHs53z4e2RB1AXVYQ

Featured in everything from CSI to Showgirls and featuring a 24/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was I who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners I was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  Certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the carrot cake as an appetizer while my main course was prepared I was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance I neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with fresh fruits, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing I imagine I'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when I was 8 years old...or 25 years later.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,4,q3XAz-_4-a2p9VhFgi4CXA

My Blue Hawaiian tasted like Kool Aid and the cocktail waitress even warned me that it wasn't going to be a strong drink. WTF. This wasn't a necessarily cheap cocktail for a coffee shop type of place, I expected a bit more than what I got. I didn't finish it.

The hot wings are decent at best, Munch's breakfast which is similar to a breakfast hash was not bad but not that good and I also ordered Joe's San Francisco special, which was definitely the best dish I had their.  Even this dish was maybe a 2 star at best, the only positive of this place is having fun watching the waitresses picking things up off the floor.

I wouldn't recommend the waffles unless you've really got a craving (you do you), only because they're pretty ordinary in size and taste and don't even come with sides.

We came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip. 

Service was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace. 

There were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch!

The cool atmosphere is why you come here, essentially.  The food by itself isn't mind-blowing, but it has a cool vibe - and conveniently is open 24/7, for your round-the-clock eating needs.

This place is sooooo old Vegas it's worth a trip in itself! Typical diner food on a large portion scale with their signature dishes including such (somewhat healthy) items like their western fruit plate which is about two pounds of assorted fruit with a nice loaf of banana bread which is served with marshmellow butter/sauce! YUM! their bloody maria's are excellent and if you'd rather hang by the fire they have a lounge attached that has TV's and sunken living room seating with a fire pit. The interior of the entire facility is adorned with mirrors, obnoxious neon lighting and fake trees and plants! Devine old Vegas style! The Peppermill should also win your love because unlike most of our city that has changed, died or evolved over time the Peppermill has stood strong as a staple here in Vegas for many, many, many years!

The service was great and the staff was very friendly. We got a table the moment we walked in, but i think that was because it was a weekday. Waitress forgot about refilling drinks but apologized for the delay.  
The food portions are very large. We were able to try the other plates that our table ordered.  My sister enjoyed the multi colored sugar and she wanted to steal it.  They sell it at the counter so i bought her one when we went back the next day.

It is always a smile floating past you as you enjoy the atmosphere. Depending on how much you had to drink will determine how good the food taste.

You won't be too disappointed by the MASSIVE portions.  I mean, pancakes larger than a frisbee (but luckily very soft and fluffy).  But beware, these portions can't really be finished unless you're a serious eating machine (or you're sharing one meal with, like, four people), and you will pay for them.  VERY expensive for what's essentially ""diner"" food.  For the experience, I think it's worth it once. 

I like that the cocktail waitresses come by almost right after you sit down to see if you want spirits from the Fireside lounge.  The service is hit or miss.  For instance, if you say you need a ""minute"" to review the menu, be prepared to wait a lifetime for the server to come back.  

There is a photographer that comes by to take a free souvenir photo of your party.  We got it one time and the last time we went, we were gone before they came back to give it to us.

Looking for a late night bite we found our way here because the reviews were pretty good and it was close by.  When we got inside it was an awkward ambience. The photos on yelp make it look a lot more appealing.  In person the feel is like a 1990's strip club with staff standing around talking to each other and not paying attention to their tables.  Our server was a young girl who was nice but completely lacked in the service area.  They should better train their staff to check on their tables.  We had to ask for our check after sitting there watching her talk to coworkers when we were ready to leave for quite some time.  I'm not going to mention her name because I don't want her to lose her job but honestly this place is just so bizarre and the food was barely mediocre.

Peppermill this...
Peppermill that...

I've heard enough about the Peppermill restaurant being a Vegas staple on the strip so I had to check it out for myself. I was craving steak for breakfast but the Americano Cafe in Caesar's Palace had their steak at a high mark up $45+!! I did some researching and found that the Peppermill's steak was only $28. So I got on a Uber for only $7 to get to the restaurant to try it out.

Excited and thrilled I was when I got there because there was no wait at all. It's located just north of Encore and across from Resorts World. The inside kinda resembled a 70's Vegas style cafe, kinda what you'd expect when the mob ran the hotels and designed it with lots and lots of velvet and 70's neon lighting. 

My Ribeye steak was huge and it came with a freshly made salad with three pieces of huge Texas style toast. The steak was cooked perfectly to what I preferred (Rare). I love my steaks bloody and juicy. From time to time, my waitress checked on me and quickly refilled my water. Just checking the decor makes you feel like you time warped back to the 70's era of Las Vegas. I consider this cafe a win win!",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,5,6,5,mLQDAC-R-Mi3iqZMqkpdvg

This is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. I remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the Stardust (now long gone). Many times we would come here for breakfast. The Stardust is a childhood memory that I feel was taken from me. But this place still remains.

As an adult, I love the Peppermill more than ever. Price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. It's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. Last time I went, I had chicken fingers with fries. I received four chicken fingers and could only finish two of them before I was stuffed. And that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. I fondly remember the breakfast platters from when I was a kid, and while I haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. Memo: get one of those next time. 

Another thing I remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. I would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. Everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and I was never allowed to check it out. Wahh wahh wahh!!! Haha. Well, I'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. And yes, it was worth the hype. It's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. Alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. Don't worry, no one will look at you funny. 

The Peppermill is quite the oddity on The Strip, a borderline mystery even. As it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. You're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. A strange happening indeed. Not that I'm one to complain. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Vegas classic.
Retro vibe and feel.
Beautiful lounge.
Huge portions. 

Cons:
Not the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that.
Not the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that.
Can feel a little bit campy, but it works.

It seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers. 

The do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. It's sort of like Buca di Beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. The photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo....

But as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I had the Crab Cake Bene (poached eggs and grilled crab cakes on toasted English muffins, smothered in Hollandaise sauce) and I opted for the Hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was REALLY thick and salty. The crab cakes were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt. 

This place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, LARGE portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less.

The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here.

I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.

No joke, the omelets are bigger than my head, and they should probably give you a shovel to eat the side of hash browns with.  However, quality has not been sacrificed for quantity.

As soon as we sat down, we were approached by someone who took our coffee and water orders (not the waiter) then came the cocktail waitress. Those came out with lightning speed. After that, everything became snail paced.

Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed and didn't acknowledge us for a while - did mention to us a couple times that he'd be right with us as he was zipping past. After a while, my friend got impatient and headed to speak with a manager and that's when our waiter showed up to take our order. Coincidentally.

Manager made sure our food came out quickly so that was nice. Food was decently good which is why this is a 3-star and not one. That and cus the bloody mary was so so good.

Got the crab cake benedict which was delicious - the eggs were made perfectly.
Eggs benedict was incredible as well - my husband said it was one of the best ones he's had which is great since that's what they're known for.

Walking in, you're greeted with the blue and purple neon strip club lights. The music is on all the TV's. Classic Rock, some pop scattered here and there and when I entered GNR was playing on the TV's.  Okay. Peppermill, Ya had me at GNR.

So, breakfast was ordered as I sat staring at a little water pond with a fire place in the middle.  It was a step down kind of pit, and it was so oooooo relaxing I soon almost nodded off. 

Breakfast was fast and huge!  It's like IHOP on steroids. I have always loved little cheese places like this to people watch and you definitely get some characters in The Peppermill at 330-5am. ....

After a few more visits, safe to say service has been pretty consistent and the food is certainly shareable. Unless..you're drunk and hungry and can kill it all by yourself. I, on the other hand, have been able to take leftovers home. Price is quite Denny prices, but similar to prices you'd find at hash house. Honestly, it pick this place over Denny's just because of its ambiance. 

My first experience with Peppermill was in Reno and completely loved the lounge firepit lounge, though, I have yet to visit the lounge at this location despite it being in the same building. 

I thought their food was good and something about those rainbow sugar crystals which I have no idea why they chose to have that on the table...but because it's the Peppermill...it makes sense. Like, why wouldn't they have rainbow colored sugar crystals?! Lol.

It's a great spot to dine and lounge along the strip without having to be IN the casinos. I've seen children in there so it's certainly kid friendly in the dining area. You could even get away with rolling a stroller in as well. Lots of booth seatings. When it's time to pay, you walk up to the register. I'm sure handing it to your waitress is a option as well, but don't grump if your waitress never returns after she hands you your tab.

This place is definitely a 70's disco hall converted into restaurant.  With neon pink lights and plenty of mirrors all around, you walk in wondering if you might be seeing some platforms and bell bottoms with the Bee Gees performing on a stage somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were none of those things to be found.  However, what they do have is pretty good food at very generous portions.

Unluckily for me, I was starting to become more and more hung over by the second by this point in the afternoon but I felt it would probably be a good idea to get something in my stomach.

We waited and I notice 2 seats available at the counter. Sat down and was waited on right away by Maribel. She was very attentive and the food came out quickly. 

The diner has not changed since my last visit 2 years ago when I celebrated Christmas in Vegas. The portions are large. I could have shared the omelette as it is that huge. The salad was ok. The lettuce tasted old. The home fries were good. The prices are less than the hotel breakfast but this is Vegas. The bill was $33.77.

Your staff and your food are worthless, lazy, expensive and just plain mediocre.  I'm so sick of the staff treating me like a worthless piece of crap, so I'm through with you.  I'm tired of paying 40-50 bucks for a meal where I have to practically beg for someone to refill my iced tea and get snubbed the entire night.

We used to be a great team. I'd stumble in drunk, eat your huge greasy food portions, and then get even more drunk off your overpriced scorpions.  Later you stopped caring about me by always overcooking every meal and then you eventually stopped using seasoning.  Finally, your staff just stopped paying attention to me. 

I just feel like you've given up on me, so last night I refused to tip your waitress after being blatantly ignored all evening and having our food shoved in our face which was so bad that I wanted to throw it back at you.  I'm leaving you because you don't contribute anything anymore and you make me hate you.

Good luck, Peppermill, although I know you don't need it.  There are plenty of other tourists, strippers, crackheads, and those down on their luck that you can take advantage of!",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,10,7,1,wfcJdNiQoC1eqqF8S9t9XA
5551389,2015-05-25,1,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"This review is for the lounge only as we'd already had dinner and came here for the dive bar ambiance and drinks.

From what I could tell, the lounge is to the left, restaurant to the right. Inside the lounge/bar area, it's dimly lit with couches sprawled around all over, and small fires burning in central areas (usually with couches encircling them). As most of the fire areas were occupied, we found a small section and sat down. The menu had an interesting list of drinks and we each picked out something when the waitress came by to take our order. I chose a weird ""cream cheese icing"" drink just for the hell of it.

Our drinks came out and I was presented with a martini glass rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and this eye-crossingly sweet icing flavoured drink. Seriously, if you're not a fan of sweet drinks, don't get this. I love sweet drinks and it was delicious but it pretty much made me done with drinking afterwards! 

We had a small incident that resulted in my drink on the floor (and on my pants) and the waitress who saw it came over and cleaned it up, while we apologized and asked for a second one to replace it. She brought it over and even though the spill was our fault and we expected to pay for it, she never charged us for it! Hooray! (we did leave an appropriate tip to show our gratitude!)

The bar itself isn't too loud and rowdy (we were there between 11:30 pm and 12:30 am, give or take). TVs scattered around up on ceiling were playing videos of live performances of a range of music, mostly 70s and 80s rock, which was pretty neat to watch.

Sadly, we didn't stay, just long enough for the one drink. As we had just flown in that day, we both had a sudden crash and wanted to just to find our hotel and rest up. We had planned on staying for a few rounds of drinks but unfortunately did cut it short. This place is on our list to return to though next time we're in the area, as the dive bar atmosphere was pretty awesome and the service was top.",kk2oFTBSU9C2XshIVU7tXQ,2,1,4,0GdxFfFIEjay_y3-nIwcsA
5554565,2009-05-28,0,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"Where do I want to go to breakfast when I'm in Vegas? Does that question even need to be asked?

I've never, ever had a bad experience there, in the many times I've been there over the past 15 years. It's amazing how little the place changes - maybe the management could update the waitstaff's cocktail-waitress-type attire from the Hawaiian nightmare it is now (and always has been), but that's about it. Service is sometimes slower when they get slammed (and they do get very slammed at times) but since I rarely get to bed before 2am when in Vegas, the crowd has usually dissipated by the time I roll in for breakfast at 11ish.

I've almost always been greeted warmly by the waitstaff (although they usually don't know me from Adam until my second or third consecutive morning in), the portions are so huge I can't finish my ham and eggs (and I can eat a LOT of ham) and the eggs benedict is one of the best I've had anywhere. Prices are reasonable, and the coffee cups are large. (Tip: go easy on the sparkly colored sugar in your coffee - the stuff is even sweeter than ""Sugar in the Raw."")

The only other place in Vegas that I'd even consider recommending for breakfast in LV is the Grand Lux at the Venetian, but that's like being the second best golfer to Tiger Woods.

It was busy, and there was a wait, so we went into the fireside lounge. What a cool, hip, old-school Vegas setting! The Bloody Mary was the best I have ever tasted (I normally don't like them, but this one was awesome). The reviews that my husband  saw suggested ordering one, so we did (and two more). The food was amazing with enormous portions, so beware. For Vegas, the prices are reasonable, and we had excellent service in both the bar and restaurant.

I've driven by Peppermill countless times in the many years since I have been coming to Las Vegas but I hadnt tried it until a couple years back. I had asked my friend Judith who is a local and worked in the tourism industry what was her favorite steak & eggs. She immediately said Peppermill... So after landing in Vegas on the first flight out of Burbank we headed for the boulevard and some grub. 

The wait is long. It was Saturday morning and we waited about 45 mins for our table of 2. It was also Halloween weekend so that might be another reason for the crowd. We were starved by the time we were seated. There is a bar off to the side of the hostess station inside that they direct you to while you wait. Or there is a waiting room up front or people wait right outside the door. The parking lot is huge and it needs to be as they get super busy.

My NY steak and eggs was great. ($18.95) I had asked for scrambled eggs and hash browns along with my thick cut NY steak. It was cooked a perfect medium and i scarfed it up with the quickness. It was a tasty steak breakfast. The hashbrowns and eggs were good too. It comes with toast as well.

Service was friendly. They have a big menu but I didnt need to ponder much on what to order. Steak & eggs all the way for me. The decor inside the Peppermill reflects that of the neon side outside.

My wife and I got there on a Monday morning around 10 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. And the food... restaurants always claim to have ""huge portions."" This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too. 


Another bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking.

It looks like some kinda Miami Vice-inspired disco with all the purple and pink neon inside, but it also has waitresses who wear blue and white old-school uniforms and call you ""honey.""  The menu has something for everyone, which is a good thing since it's open 24/7 and you never know what you'll be craving in the wee hours.  
The first visit, I had an omelet which, upon ordering, I had no idea would be made with 10 whole eggs!  No wonder I couldn't even finish half.  The second visit the other day, I ordered the turkey club with fries and that was also a healthy portion, but I was able to finish most of it in one sitting.  There was some kind of mishap in the kitchen, though, with my dish taking the longest to arrive.  Our waitress was very good about getting the sandwich comped because of the delay and the head chef also came by our table to apologize.   
Depending on the time of day you come, there will be a wait, so be prepared since this is a popular place.  We ate lunch here two days ago on Friday, November 11th, at 12:30pm, and waited about 30 minutes.  Mind you, it was a holiday, so considering that, the line wasn't horrible.

The decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.  

Even on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.

Puzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd. 

Food:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.  
My dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.

Cool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.

Once we were seated it took AT LEAST 10min before our server WENDY came over to our table. How do you walk up to the customers who will be tipping you with sooo much attitude??! She asked what we wanted to drink, water and lemonade. We ordered the food while she was still standing there so we wouldn't have to wait again (which for some reason pissed her off to the point she felt the need to talk down to us). We told her what we wanted to her and she responded with, ""Yea, yea I got it..see I wrote it down. What else?"" Rude!

The lemonade never came out, so the bf waved down the next available sever. Our waitress came over within minutes to say, ""Soo..You ordered lemonade?"" We nod. She said, ""You ordered it from me?"". We nod again, and my bf told her she wrote it down. Instead of apologizing she rolls her eyes, walks away and someone else ended up bringing our drinks.

I ordered the tostada omlet and the bf ordered the hamburger. It didn't take long for the food to get out, buuut I'm not sure why tables seated waay after us got thier food first?? (Maybe I'm being too picky??) 

The food was just okay. Nothing I would ever come back or crave again. The hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and straight mush on the inside. Disgusting. I barely touched them.

One is the Fireside Lounge, which has a wonderful 80s retro vibe to it, especially with the lighting.

The restaurant side is where I went, though.  The menu is pretty typical of a lot of the 24 hour diner options -- an expansive menu of appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts.  My French Dip was excellent especially with swiss cheese and mushrooms, both of which were extra.  The service was very typical of the Strip -- very attentive and a team of staff as opposed to one specific waiter.

Oh what to do?!!?  Yep, open up Yelp and let my taste buds do the walking.  

The closest place that wasn't fancy or didn't require a reservation was The Peppermill.  As we walked past the place (had to get to a crosswalk) it looked like a fun place to have dinner and the rest of you Yelpers had it at 4-stars...so we gave them a shot.  From the outside, the place didn't look like much more than a fancy NJ Diner...just with more neon.

When we got inside I realized the place was bigger than it seemed, but it STILL looked like a neon bathed NJ diner...so I was hoping for a good meal at a good price.  The menu here is pretty large, but we were here for a couple of steaks...nothing too fancy, but something that would sit in my stomach for the 5+ hour flight home (what were we thinking?).  Ernesto came over and took our drink orders and was back quickly for the food orders.  We skipped the appetizers (though the meal did come with salad) and we ordered a couple of NY Strips...my buddy added a side of fettuccini alfredo and I stuck with my potato...and we both also got a side of cooked, marinated mushrooms.  We waited a bit for Ernesto to come back with our salads and I asked him 2x for water.  When the salads arrived a waitress named Gabby delivered them and I asked for more water (this time it took about 45 seconds).

Ok, I know what you're thinking...these idiots ordered steaks at what amounts to a fancy diner?!?!  Yep...don't judge a book by its cover.  My steak, though a little small, was actually quite delicious.  Cooked with just some salt and cracked pepper it was tasty and done just medium.  My co-worker had to send his back as his was still mooing, but it came back quickly and was more to his liking.  For some reason, Ernesto disappeared and we ended up with Gabby as our waitress.  Now, I'm not one to judge, but this being Vegas and all, I don't think this was the only job Gabby had...Gabby was very friendly, quite a beautiful young woman, and honestly a great waitress.  I hope she ended up taking the tip instead of Ernesto who did nothing more than take our order.

Gonna give The Peppermill 3.5 stars and have to round down.  The undercooked steak, the disappearing waiter, the multiple requests for water...the service could have been better (though it got better with Gabby).",Kc7IwXLrJVqAVMkX6pxWbA,5,6,3,6mVKXVxbvQMXynN_fk0Hcw

We found it on Yelp (course) and were seriously surprised. LONG day of flights plus a workout in. We didn't want to get super decked out. Went literally from the fitness center in our hotel to Peppermill after walking down to the strip. We told the cab to take us here and he was cracking up.  We didn't get the joke till we arrived. 

Pretend and visualize you at a IHop/Denny's with ambiance lightening, dance music that serves alcohol. You have arrived at the Peppermill Lounge. LOL!!!! 

The food ROCKS here. Late that Saturday night we each had a mediterranean omelette with egg whites and hash browns.  Bran muffin for him, blueberry for me.  We barely said a word to each other. We just chowed! I kept eye balling these HUGE onion rings that were passing our table and said I HAD to go back at some point and get my onion rings.  It was a must-do. 

The next day for lunch we needed something sort of easy and quick. It was Sunday and we walked in around 1130 am to see a JAMMED room of people WAITING for tables to get in....I'm telling you, it's THAT good. We by-passed them and went to the Fireside Lounge side of the facility. We ordered a few cocktails a fruit/cheese plate, BIG bowl of Onion Rings as big as your head...and a plate of sliders. I didn't touch the fruit/cheese, overdosed on Onion Rings as planned and had a slider with maybe a few chips.  The food was again, awesome.  Next time I'm just getting those onion rings. :) 

We made fun of it yet went there TWICE.  We like our grub and it was worth going two times. Prices are more than fair and the staff is good.",tb7q_TIKu_pha2UFyneMmA,2,0,4,Yf7mip0LU-FVG-QR14P1Rg

More than enough on every plate to share, but so many good things to choose that you have to order more than you can eat.

Cocktails served by a glamorous Vegas beauty in a long black evening gown looking like a starlet from a Hollywood red carpet. Who could say no?

The inside looks like a limo/ party bus... appropriate for Vegas. Cocktail waitresses were friendly; drinks didn't taste like there was any alcohol tho. 
One star for unique atmosphere. 

After an hour, I approached the hostess about how much longer & she said ""We're just waiting for tables to get up"" & no apology, which pissed me off. If I've waited way past the amount of time you told me I needed to wait, at least take 2 seconds out of the time your getting paid to stand there to apologize for your hosting skills. 

Literally 1hr & 30 min later , 2x my quote time, we finally get sat! Then, we had to wait some more because it took 3 different people to get our meal started: 1 for basic drinks, 2nd for alcoholic drinks, 3rd for food. We kept hearing ""someone else will get that for you"", WTF. Then we happened to notice that another large party that sat after us got their food faster than us. We're angrier than hangry at this point! 

The food: .. we ate it. Similar to Denny's. Second star for George (our server) for doing your job. 

Paying out: Two people of my party had to leave early so they tried to pay their tab at the cashier stand. The manager gave them a hard time because we all had to be there to pay out but the rest of us were still eating. Annoyed af, I got up there & split the check myself. I expressed to her how terrible of a time we were having and she had no comment. Didn't even take two seconds to say sorry or ask about what happened. She probably trained the girl at the host stand.

They have a restaurant on one side and a lounge on the other side.  We chose to go to the 21+ lounge side to celebrate my hub's birthday. The circular pink plush velvet booths, fake chinese lantern flower vines, and blue neon tubing are so cheesy and awesome.  They have tv's at each booth playing music videos from the 70's.  The waitresses wear floor-length black gowns. They have happy hour every day from 3-6 and from 9-11.  
Went on Saturday 1-9-16 at 6pm for dinner.  $49.67 got us two of their zombie cocktails, a long island ice tea, a glass of moscato, and a chicken tender dinner.  Their drinks are strong and their food portions are very generous.  
I've been here 4 times now and each time the service is spotty...the servers are not overly friendly and they might abandon you for long periods of time.  It took us two hours to eat on Saturday because of the long stretches between seeing our waitress.

Inexpensive and inoffensive. That's how I viewed the restaurant and food. It was early bird specials all over the place. The food might have glimpsed a spice rack in the distance while it was traveling to our table, but it didn't stop to say hello or mingle with anything flavorful. But really, when you're drunk and hungry, tastes get in the way of the  barnyard biological imperative to stuff yourself and soak up the booze.

The waitresses were incredibly friendly, but seemed over-worked as they would accidentally abandon tables to time and history periodically. We recruited the woman hawking souvenir photos to find us someone capable of refilling our coffee and averted disaster that way.

It was a Monday night at 1:30am. The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't. 

Food: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick.

Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad, but then saw a mass of people outside, then a mass of people inside. Uh oh...its got to be a 45 minute wait and I'm starving, so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand. ""It will be about 10-15 minutes"" she said. Wow!

And it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.

Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.

Overall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free. My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent, but the eggs benedict weren't all that this time so I'll try another meal next time I'm back.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,9,5,4,-d_EwpRtd05P44OSbmJy6Q

I had the oatmeal, which comes with a lot of toppings, and bacon. My wife had the two egg breakfast with bacon. We were both pleased with our meals, I will certainly plan on eating here again.

The food there was bland and uneventful. I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross. 
My husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. 
The best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks. 
I give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  Vegas décor and ambiance. Also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses.

This time I enjoyed a Spinach Salad with cut eggs, spinach leaves, substantial bacon, and tangy French-style Dressing (although Hot Bacon Dressing would have been more appropriate), followed by two fine Gyros with soothing cool cucumber Tzaki Sauce, tomatoes, and White Onions.  The large sandwiches were accompanied by great skin-on Red Potato Salad.  

Other guests in my party savored a Gourmet Chicken Salad, Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, and Scrambled Eggs, Canadian Bacon, and crispy Hash Browns, along with an excellent warm Bran Muffin that I sampled.  The ambiance here is always upbeat, casual, and comfortable.  And service was very good.  My only gripe is that my salad wasn't removed after I finished it.

The portions here are HUGE. We ended up ordering two entrees for the three of us since we weren't that hungry, but there was still more than enough food for the three of us. We ordered ribs expecting a few and ended up getting a whole rack. For the money spent, you do get a good amount of food. We ended up taking some home.

The environment itself is one-of-a-kind. They have a sort of retro feel with neon lights and booths for seating. The booths are very intimate; it's a semicircle around a table so you can see and talk to everyone.

The only fault was the service was very informal and casual. My family and I had just walked to the restaurant from the strip, so after a very long day we were exhausted and starving. When we arrived, no one was in front of us or appeared to be waiting, but the two girls at the front were chatting away with each other. They definitely saw us come in, and we were standing in front of them, but they still didn't acknowledge us or stop their conversation.

Very reminiscent of the ""old Las Vegas"" and almost nostalgic. Truly a visual spectacle! The only thing better than the food was the appearance of the restaurant.

The decor is some of the most interesting I've seen with exotic plant life all around you and neon running the walls and ceilings. The lounge was fantastic and very upscale looking with the round oversized cushions and tables. 21 and over in there, so that portion of the restaurant is not for kids.

Food portions are huge! Each time my girlfriend and I took leftovers back to the hotel. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day everyday. We didn't wait long at all for food or drink! Service was exceptional each time regardless of when we went. A huge perk in itself!

I tried the Southern Fried Steak and it hit the spot. Ample portion, but the taste was not compromised. I got it with hash browns and over medium eggs. The hash browns were crispy and the eggs were cooked properly. Both were good. Now onto the main event. The Southern Fried Steak had an acceptable amount of breading and ""healthy"" portion of beef rounds. Seasoning came through with the savory, yet not overly heavy, gravy sauce. I especially liked the hints of mushroom. This is a must try dish! 

Others ordered the Veggie Omelette, Pork Loin with Eggs, and Crab Cakes. All said their food was good. They appreciated the value-based portions. Looks like most dishes are safe bets here.

Every time I go, I'm never disappointed with the price, food or location.

We ordered fish and chips and southern fried steak which came with choice of bread and salad or soup. The both of these dishes were fantastic and he had to take half of his meal home as there must have been 2 pounds of curly fries with his fish and chips lol.

I snuck away and informed the staff that we were celebrating a birthday so I picked out a dessert to present him with!

I chose the THE ELEGANT BROWNIE, a yummy chocolate fudge brownie served steaming hot with a mound of creamy French vanilla ice cream, smothered in warm chocolate fudge sauce and layered with whipped cream and sprinkles.  This dessert was ridiculous good, that homemade brownie and combination of fudge and ice cream was insane orgasmic good!

5849788,2011-11-21,2,XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg,"I could write a ten page diatribe on why I love this place.  I will start with a review for the lounge.  I will then proceed with a review for the restaurant.  I will then sum up my LOVE for Peppermill with a review for their ""banquet"" services - because, yes, when you get married in Vegas... you MUST have your reception at the Peppermill.  That's the only way to roll in this town.

Lounge:  seedy, swanky, and fabulous!  The service is fantastic.  I love that these are the most dressed up cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  Long sleek black gowns.  Nice touch.  The drinks are fabulous.  In the morning.  In the afternoon.  At 2 am.  They are delicious, potent, and worth the money.  I love the flaming fire pit adorned with tvs.  I love the electric glow of purple and pink.  The fake foliage?  Very nice.  The chairs are comfortable (even though I have a small fear of what might be on them in the darkest corners, I take some relief in the glowing purple lights overhead... about as close to black light as we're gonna get).  Looking for a nice place to hang out with your buddies after a late night?  Or a place to get the party started at 10 pm?  Peppermill lounge is the perfect spot.  I would say the parking is super easy.  The lot behind the building is huge.  But if you're going to drink... you won't need to worry about parking.  Take a cab.  They're located at the north end of The Strip, on the immediate north side of Ross Dress For Less.  Now go.  Drink.  And Be Merry.

Restaurant:  bring an appetite.  And a tupperware container or three.  The food is fun.  There is a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.  The portions are MASSIVE.  You can eat until chorizo is popping out of your ears and then you'll look down and still see half of your plate full of food.  Good thing there are fridges in the rooms at the hotel!  The blueberry muffins are warm, moist, and delicious.  Don't waste your time on boring ol' toast.  Oh, you wanted the banana nut bread?  Yeah - you're going to receive and entire LOAF of banana nut bread.  Prepare to share.  My friend ordered the fruit plate with marshmallow dipping sauce.  They brought her a fruit cart (exaggerating, people... but go with it).  In all seriousness - she probably ate her 5 servings of fruit and still took home THREE containers of fruit for later.  And a 2/3 of a a banana bread.  If you're looking for a good deal in Vegas - eat here.  You'll easily get two meals out of one.  And when you're hung over and hankering for a little something when you roll in the door at 5 am - why not nosh on a little banana bread?

Banquet services:  Hubs and I had a morning wedding.  Celebrated with champagne and cupcakes immediately after (see my review for The Cupcakery in Henderson, NV).  Then we took all of our guests to lunch at The Peppermill.  We made arrangements with JoAnn a few weeks prior... selected a set menu, picked out colors and table decorations, got a map of the restaurant to make a seating arrangement... and all we had to do was show up.  It was such a blast!  We had about 1/3 of the restaurant blocked off just for us.  Cocktail waitresses took orders, waitresses took food orders, and we were good to go.  We are proud to say that our friends had never had a bacon cheeseburger at a wedding reception until they came out ours!  Chicken foccacia?  Yup.  Fruit platter.  All us.  The atmosphere was so much fun.  The tables looked fantastic.  The service was excellent.  And it was so neat to see our names on the little display board when we first arrived.  I'm not a traditional sit-down boring reception type person... so the Peppermill fit my and my husbands personality perfectly.  I think everyone had a good time and I'm forever grateful to JoAnn and the crew at The Peppermill for helping to make my special day that much more special... and unique!

There's a separate bar area from the restaurant inside known as fireside which is right by the restroom area.  Inside you will find a fire pit within a jacuzzi, along with neon lights,  trees, and velvet chairs and couches.

For years I've driven by this place thinking that it looks like a Vegas rendition of a Denny's. When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny's theme still holds true with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant. 
You instantly enter into a late 60's early 70's themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70's imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I'd have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it.

We scored two seats at the counter during our wait and realized that our seating included a ""free"" floor show .  Watching the kitchen cooks, expediter and servers was a course in discipline, control and efficiency.  It was a beautiful thing to watch.

My three eggs, cooked as ordered on a mound of delicious crisp homemade corned beef hash and a huge fresh bagel with cream cheese and strawberry jam was outstanding.  My wife's platter included eggs along with bacon, sausage, and French toast.  It's so good to be married to a slim women;  I helped finish everything and it was all to die for!

This is the Hash House A Go- Go (which I loved on previous visits & will return) without some of the showmanship.

My first visit to Peppermill was in the morning after a long night. The wait is usually an hour plus on a weekend morning, so plan accordingly. In my case, planning accordingly means heading straight to the lounge and ordering a Bloody Mary. I don't want to say that Peppermill served up the best bloody I've had in Vegas so far, but I have to say that because it's true. Not too watery, just the right amount of spice, and that wor-chest-chire sauce, that nobody can really ever spell or say correctly, took it to a whole new level of tomato glory. Once our table was called, we finished our cocktails, grabbed our bucket of Coronas, and had breakfast. Eggs and bacon with an english muffin. Delish with a capital D and my perfect equation for curing a hangover.

My most recent adventure brought me back late night. Crystal was behind the bar again and mixed me up a blended cocktail called the Chocolate Chip Cookie. Heaven, dessert, however you want to describe it, it's darn good. Went for the Rueben at 12:30am and I'm so glad I did. The ratio of meat to sauerkraut was impressive. The last minute addition to order a random drink off the cocktail list based on the name you liked seemed like a great idea at the time. I opted for the Snuggler, a hot chocolate with Rumplemintz, which was tasty but wildly unnecessary at that hour.

The portion are decently large, but that didn't stop me from pouding my burger, fries and eating a handful more of sweet potato fries off my friend's plate.

The chicken focaccia is a pretty big hit, with pesto sauce, it's always a good time.  The chicken was so tender and I shouldn't be shocked, but it was tasty.

We stopped in for some cold beers and an afternoon snack. We ordered the nachos, topped with beef. What we received was something the size of a small planet: a mountain of multi-colored chips topped with delicious beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, olives sour cream, guacamole. It was fabulous. And our snack was big enough that we didn't need dinner, and had plenty left to snack on all evening.

So we came back the next day, (why wouldn't we?), for a real dinner. We split a quesadilla and a steak and mushroom salad. Again, generously portioned and delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Mushrooms, and blue cheese topped the salad and they were delicious. The quesadilla had a fresh pico on the inside and it was phenomenal.

The breakfast food is Denny's with a Vegas twist. The twist comes from the funky mirrored/neon interior and the short skirted waitresses. The food was more expensive than the breakfast buffet at the hotel next door, but the staff was friendlier and the food significantly better. If you are not staying in the northern end of the Strip it is not worth the effort to go out of your way for the Peppermill.

Facing a grim flight after nearly a week of avoiding casinolands and focusing instead on the awesome climbing and desert hiking that the area contains, I was hesitant to go into a place that I'd imagined as a kind of cartoon of a Vegas cliche. I relented primarily because it looked a reliable redoubt against the desert heat.

Guess what?

It was a cartoon of a Vegas cliche on steroids and psychedelics and it is truly a worthwhile stop.

With cocktail servers who all look like they stepped from a TV commercial opposite Ricardo Montalban, a surreal decor that verily shouts 1970s pickup scene, and a fountain that shoots flames, the important thing here to note is that they serve cocktails in glasses bigger than my head (and I'm a bit macrocephalous), it has subsequently become my most ritualized stop in Las Vegas.

She said they were sprayed the previous day and that they were assured they had no bugs.  She invited me to look at the kitchen to see how clean it is.  Then she moved us to a different table.  

I was really freaking out, but no one else in my party seemed to be bothered by the bug.  My daughter has mild OCD and I didn't want to exacerbate it, so I tried my best to not draw too much attention to the situation.  She was starving and it was almost bedtime so I allowed her to eat her pancake and we just stayed.  I know for certain if she was not there that I would have RUN out.

I tried my best to eat a couple bites of my food, but I was paranoid the entire time and could not eat.
