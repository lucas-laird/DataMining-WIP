Our server Warren was excellent and helped make our first visit here a really great experience. As for the food, we all enjoyed our meal. From the cheddar bread to our individual plates (grilled shrimp with clam chowder, top sirloin, classic cheeseburger and black tie pasta) everything was excellent. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a family meal at decent price. Enjoy!",kUSWcLG5mdudWZafI1i_3A,0,1,5,P8uCocn7N2rcbbMy5bMSBQ

I was disappointed that Fernando was not able to be my bartender as he is my Favorite from their Town Square location, but he introduced me to Peter and Ritchie and they took great care of us! Peter went out of his way to make my night extra special! My party was very happy with how they handled our consistent requests being it was a few of us. I would definitely recommend Claim Jumper especially their happy hour! If you are dining in ask for Fernando and if you are at the bar Peter or Ritchie hopefully can take care of you! I hope your experience is as wonderful as ours was! 10 Stars for all 3 of them! **********",ibAUjHiOAgLL0qa7ay-V2Q,0,0,5,m4xXui8nooEAZzskjqb0rQ

The wonderful staff was not notified either...such a shame. Now, Claim jumper has new staff, poor service, and their menu isn't as versatile. No thanks. I'm going to Banditos Grill (in the same parking lot) for better service and delicious menu items on happy hour.",3zQB0occCSGJgkT05ae3vg,2,0,1,5abU3MJi60hud0d4ju3uxA

I haven't had a disappointing experience yet. I've ordered the chicken lunch special and the 2nd time I ordered the chicken pot pie which was delicious. This place is a block & a half east of the Las Vegas Strip on flamingo in the Howard Hughes office park where McCormick & Smiths used to be. They bring out freshly baked bread to stuff your face with while ya wait too.",Jy3MoHeefnYoUWNrWii_Ow,0,0,3,f3B6aQ4HTHAdlNIIWXsluA
2406287,2017-10-16,0,BS2Y5IZiCOHBebHMEU2dEQ,Sure it's a chain restaurant. But it's a consistently good chain restaurant with a large menu that offers something for everyone. Service was pleasant and efficient. The food was good. If your looking for something safe and reasonably priced Claim Jumper is a good choice.,vC9P_4VKbxb8m50l7TJ9tQ,0,0,4,8W2hLuVPIC3Gk0xq59Xh-A
2820435,2017-12-08,1,BS2Y5IZiCOHBebHMEU2dEQ,"Absolutely the WORST experience I have ever had dining a this Claim Jumper.  FIRST the service was atrocious.  The severs name was Warren.  He never greeted us, we had to flag another server to get our drinks.  He finally took our order and it came out cold and took forever.  When we spoke with Andrew, the assistant manager, he was rude and basically didn't care and huffed off like we were wasting his time.  Mind you, there were only 3 other tables in the entire restaurant.   I also found that he was interacting with my teenage son very inappropriately.  I am a LSC card member, and since I PAID for this card, I expect the service to be decent and the management to at least ACT like they care.  I am appalled by this experience.  Avoid this Claim Jumper at all costs!!!!  There are to many other places to eat in Vegas to be treated like this.  Shame on them.",vxbw_PE5AKkg6Jgyr3ONmQ,0,0,1,WOlSLmUfw9xsyC28V47dTQ

We came for happy hour which had a pretty extensive menu. Ambiance was very nice and new, I wish we had opted for the outdoor seating since it was a nice day out. Service was good, food was decent. I'd come back.",Rsez5iSKBDgkqt6yU62o2A,0,2,4,i7mXQtX7VjQ8jt7RWl95Jg

4526520,2017-10-14,0,BS2Y5IZiCOHBebHMEU2dEQ,just left there w dad n his friend. Restaurant was not crowded and took an hour for our food. Dad got steak and shrimp and the excuse for taking so long was the baby steak. A steak that small does not take that long to cook. Very disappointed. This location has only been open a couple of weeks. Very disappointing,xPSXDnjJ_oXoVSlkvmDItA,6,1,1,mlxs6Hl3JUB7lIKMOxRfUQ
