Pros: 
Amazing view - Bellagio water show went off all throughout dinner
Great food - had a mixed table (meat-eaters and non) and everyone left very full and very happy. Pasta for the table to share, steaks and sea bass....yum!
Special event - Lisa with group reservations was awesome. Set up a huge cupcake display to celebrate the big bday, didn't have to worry about a thing!

Cons: this is where I'd take off the 1/2 star....
Large group - not so good....we are loud, not obnoxious loud, but having a good time, couple of bottles of wine loud...and there was ten of us. We were put at a table in the main dining room (not sure if there is any other??) but the crowd was definitely couples trying to have a romantic weekend. Not too thrilled with the table of thirty-somethings trying to get the party started.

We were seated my the window facing the Bellagio fountains.  While at the time I wasn't that much into the food (i blame it on the preteen angst), I did enjoy waiting the fountain show.  Since then, I have been back about a handful of times.  Its been getting better.  I want to like this place so much that I keep hoping they'll change my mind.  But now,  I think I only like it because of the nice views from the windows.  The service is ok.  I found the decor to be a little annoying and distracting.  And overall the was food just average.

I had requested that we were allocated a table with the view of the fountains, which we got.  Unfortunately the tables for 2 mean that one of you has to sit with your back to the window, we didn't mind much as my husband sat next to me to watch a bit of the fountain show before our food started arriving. 

We went for the tasting menu which I do recommend.  My husband cannot eat shellfish and they catered for this by offering substitutes for any of the dishes with shellfish.  

I ordered the wine pairing with my food which was absolutely worth the $48, each wine better than the next and decent measures to allow you to enjoy the glass and not just taste. The sommelier was wonderful and very attentive to our table.

I noted the couples sitting next to us eating pasta and was not overly impressed.  the portions were massive and the spaghetti looked  ridiculously thick, so I was very pleased we went with the tasting menu and would return for more of the same.",gqvutr-ov8OS0hnxwOueYQ,0,0,4,k2ASVwOCcG7Cg_OuVvJD7Q
249095,2009-08-07,1,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"If you love eating fine cuisine, but cannot quite afford Le Cirque, eating at Circo will provide you with an excellent culinary experience without going too far beyond your budget.

During my recent weeklong trip to Las Vegas, I dined at Circo twice.  My first experience was with a group of co-workers with whom I was attending a conference.  We were seated at a table by a window, which provided us with a fantastic view of Bellagio's fountain show.  Our friendly server asked us if we would like to try Circo's caprese martini.  Yes, I said caprese: the tomato, basil, and mozzarella salad drizzled in olive oil and sometimes balsamic vinegar that you will find at most quality Italian restaurants.  Out of our party of six, three of us were brave enough to try this unusual sounding martini.  Our willingness for adventure paid off.  The caprese martini was sensational. 

The bartender started by putting basil at the bottom of a martini shaker and crushed it in the same way you would crush mint in a mojito. Then heirloom tomato infused vodka, white balsamic vinegar, and ice is added to the shaker.  The martini glass is sprinkled with a dusting of black pepper before the martini is poured into the glass.  Finally, the garnish consists of the classic toothpick adorned with fresh mozzarella wrapped in a basil leaf.  The result is a slightly tangy, surprisingly refreshing martini that allows you to ""drink your appetizer,"" as the bartender put it.  

Obviously, my intention is to focus on the outstanding martini.  However, I would be remiss if I did not mention the food.  I had the potato wrapped salmon, which was phenomenal.  

When my husband arrived in Vegas to meet me a few days later, I was compelled to take him to Circo to try the caprese martini.  He enjoyed the drink and the ambience so much that we decided to stay for dinner.  We ended up eating our delicious rack of lamb right at the bar.  It was a delightful evening.  I even had the opportunity to watch the bartender make my martini.  My own decanter of heirloom tomatoes and vodka is currently resting on the countertop of my kitchen.  I just have to try to recreate my experience!  If that isn't a sign of a great restaurant, I don't know what is.",fzdAc8lA-Dt5StG8CZZDVg,1,1,5,Cjxr5XvfbcIXpLiS5cv6Vw

The decor is fun, and make sure you ask for a seat near the window where you can watch the Bellagio Fountains.  In particular - the bolognesse was unbelievable - and also very highly recommend trying the lamb and osso bucco.  Definitely one of the best in Vegas.",rEB0XQMM-W-rG1mzR8auOg,2,2,5,PqrF4Fm0MeEXZ4y2rvcwVQ
267970,2009-12-24,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I think Circo is the only fine dining establishment in the Bellagio without a AAA 4 or 5 Diamond rating, and I can see why. It's not that it's bad. It's just not stellar, which is what you should get for these prices. The dining room is beautiful - colorful and playful, somehow casual and elegant at the same time, with terrific views of the fountains through the windows. The service is friendly and attentive. But the food is just okay. It started on a good note, with three kinds of homemade bread in the bread basket, all fresh and flavorful, but it went a bit downhill from there. The caprese salad was one of the most expensive I've seen it anywhere ($18) and also the smallest (a single slice of tomato and mozzarella) - the mozzarella was okay (burrata would have been better) but the tomato was pale and unappetizing. For entrees, we ordered the mezzaluna special, the ravioli, the pasta with shrimp, and the sea bass. All of the pastas were very good but, again, quite overpriced for what you're getting. The sea bass was just awful. I'm not even sure it was really sea bass. If it was, it was the most thin and flavorless sea bass I've ever had. By the time the server came around to ask if we wanted dessert, we were all in agreement that we'd get dessert elsewhere. They brought some mini biscotti, a nice touch, and then brought a complimentary creme brulee, since it was one of my dining companion's birthday. The creme brulee was great, although some found it too sweet. Overall, I just wasn't impressed by the food. With so many spectacular restaurants in the Bellagio, let alone on the Strip, good just isn't good enough, especially not at these prices.",lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,0,0,3,byLq30QQr9eohV5vHhHr8Q

They really do climb up your butt about ordering booze the minute you sit down, but whatever.  My $16 glass of wine was fabulous, and when my husband ordered a highball, they made it right (unlike the Eiffel Tower Bar).

I had the spaghetti with bolognese sauce.  It was super yummy, but (expectedly) salty.  Hubs had the duck, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We finished it off with a Grand Marnier souffle.  YUM!

It's nice to see the water show while you're eating, but also entertaining to see the neon sign with bare chested men right next to it. Romantic and entertaining all at once.",KuvzKejeCzG34wPfZ8GOtw,0,0,4,yODw8p8JzRZ5GoHooGYwOQ
376723,2010-04-21,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I almost feel bad giving Circo four stars instead of 5, but in all honesty for the amount of money you throw down at a place like this it really should be better. I will say the quality of our meal was solid. Great pasta, excellent sauce (arguably the best meat sauce I've ever had), and the seafood seemed fresh. Service was also on par with what you would expect. The sommelier knew his stuff and took the time to give us some good suggestions and samples. Also its got a great location and you get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains at night. 

Despite all of these positives a few things detract from Circo in my opinion:
1) the aesthetic - although I understand the concept it was entirely too bright and colorful for my liking. Fabrics and materials used were good and the furnishings seemed well made, but the theme was wrong. I was there with family so it didn't matter to me, but I don't think this makes a good 'date' destination. 

2) the emptiness-  we went on a Saturday night around 7p and there were literally 3 other tables in the entirety of this large restaurant. I know Vegas is struggling with the economy, but we went to plenty of other restaurants that weekend which were packed or mostly full. This either means that people don't feel that its worth the cost, or that they are doing a poor job promoting the place. 

Overall a nice experience and still a solid choice if you're catching a show at the Bellagio (as we were) and want pretty top notch Italian in a quiet setting. However, I don't think this is a great value and I think there are better restaurants to spend your precious (and fleeting) Las Vegas dollar.",oSXIkCNZ9uEWU5-rd-jRVA,1,0,4,oWXSUHFwT2AYtoy_TO-dsw

People would walk in after us and then get seated prior to us - maybe due to the fact we made it known we were there for restaurant week?  Once we were seated, the service was great and the sommelier was very helpful, which is why this review got 2 stars.  Most of the food was pretty bland and under-seasoned.  Out of the six dishes we had, the calamari appetizer was the only good one.  Overall I was disappointed and definitely expected more.",2xkABRbEo4RQlMFBbAl-Pw,0,0,2,6VpNhB_Z4J1gANXOZiD2eg

We sent it back and she still couldn't eat it the second time as it was still rare (uneven charring throughout).

That being said, hubby's pork chop and mushroom risotto were simply divine. And I only wish we could have gotten the name of that merlot we had as the accompanying wine. A definite yum.

We woke up at 8:00 p.m. starved and on a whim decided to see if we could nab a reservation for Circo.  We were in luck.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed.  The decor was excellent.  I was treated like a princess.  We had a semi-private table with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Almost everything we ate had truffles in it and the sommelier talked with us for about 45 minutes about wine & his training.  We are going back to the Bellagio in about a month and I hope to try Circo's older brother Le Cirque!

However there was a lot of lobster in the dish which was very nice, but the gnocchi was a little on the mushy side which sadly seems to be a problem with gnocchi at a lot of places. The view is great if you get a window table as you can look over the fountains during their shows while you eat which is great. The staff was very good at checking up enough without getting annoying.

468100,2009-03-27,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I was disappointed by this place, and I even went in with pretty low expectations. 

The food was pretty good, but there was not much memorable about it. When we finished, I almost felt like I had just as well eaten at macaroni grill.

The rack of lamb was huge and well cooked, but again, nothing fancy and something that just could have been made at home for a fraction of the cost. It was strange too that it took only 7 minutes from the time I put in the order to the time it was on the table. How does that huge a rack cook in that little time? around $55

Pasta dish with quail sausage - i forget the name of this dish, but it was pretty good. I enjoyed this much more than the rack of lamb. 

The dessert was gross. It was some banana thing that was pretty much worse than anything you can get from Sizzlers' buffets dessert choices.

If I came back, I would stay with the pasta dishes as the meat dishes are too pricey for what they have to offer. I would much rather splurge over at craftsteak on their kobe menu. Yum...

Service was pretty horrible. Maybe they do not believe in smiling, or greetings or even quality checks. They just seem interested in turning over the tables as quickly as possible. 

One last thing. If you want somewhere to dine and watch the fountains, it is ok from circo, but if you want a much more romantic atmosphere and better view of the show, go to Jean Georges' Prime Steakhouse. There you are on the same level as the lake and have a much better view. The food and service is leaps and bounds better over there as well.",uMWWdq_ZYGAuN02E7Z0lqw,0,0,3,TXfCSbBCZ4bFvpn69J4n0g

595140,2012-08-26,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I just came back from dinner at Circo. After reading all the rave reviews I was very excited to try this place. I love all the fresh red and yellow rose bouquets that they had at each table, very classy. I also had a decent view of the fountains, though my party was sitting about 4 tables back from the window. I liked the circus theme, it was done very creatively. The ambience is nice, but the food taste wise fell short especially for the price. The raspberry fizz martini was delicious though!

I decided to try the chefs tasting menu (cost $88). I chose the caprese salad, duck ravioli, scallops, lamb and I picked the strawberry tart for dessert.

The food arrived within good time, though I thought it took the server a little too long to greet us and take our order at the beginning. 

The caprese salad was just ok. It is served with a special kind of very smal leaf basil. There was only a little sprig of it, so there was essentially no basil flavor. Duck ravioli was nice, I liked the mushrooms it was paired with.

Only one scallop is served with the tasting menu but it is a large one. The presentation was very nice on this. I thought the scallop was cooked very well, and was one of my favorite dishes here, though I have had scallops at other places I liked better. 

I didn't really care much for the lamb (you pay an extra $9 for this). It is heavily encrusted in herbs, but surprisingly it didn't taste the strongly of herbs. The meat seemed fairly chewy, I had a hard time cutting it with my knife, and I had ordered it medium rare and it was really red. 

The strawberry tart was ok. the arrangement of the strawberries on top of the tart was pretty. The filling was a mix of strawberries and something else? It was very mushy and didn't have much flavor. The was also a mini strawberry smoothie served along side. There were some pop rocks in it, so that was an interesting surprise. The strawberry sauce in the smoothie was a bit intense, tasted like fake strawberry syrup, it was too sweet. I think a smoothie made with real strawberries would have been better.",5sSy0cGq2SbDx4hYHdHRtw,0,0,3,Eva4zeMEOaoBGuGqZSZOqg

Penne with shrimp

Duck tortellini
Beef tenderloin

The food is rich but not too much so that it becomes gross after 3 bites. It is just as innovative as it is traditionally filling (in the purpose-of-food sense).
The service is great!

Also go early as they had run out of fried calamari so we had to get the antipasto appetizer. It was ok. Had 3 pasta dishes- great homemade pasta.,q9gjfheOcqxfva1qLZ8L4Q,0,0,3,u4c9v9D4r9-Iad-Rq4KrqA
992541,2013-09-06,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"We weren't off to a great start with Restaurant Week so we decided to raise the bar and have dinner at Circo inside Bellagio. It's been our favorite restaurant for some time. We knew it would not disappoint. We had reservations and we were seated in a prime spot in the center of the room against the windows overlooking Lake Como. Service was exceptional as always. 

We started with calamari and caprese. While both were very good, neither are stellar starters. I like the Carpaccio a bit more. Still they were lovely presentations. 

It's Mama Egi's ravioli that brings us back again and again. My husband and I both chose it for our entrée so no sharing was necessary. It was heavenly. 

And then we ended the meal with the infamous tiramisu made by angels. It is without a doubt my most beloved version of tiramisu. I will be a real shame when Circo closes in May. There are no words to express how greatly I will miss these celestial treats. 

The husband and I vowed to return to Circo as much as possible before it closes. We ought to return sooner than later, I'm afraid it might inevitably take a turn for the worse with Mario Maccioni's departure. He's been on site for fifteen years, but recently left to pursue other ventures. With the upcoming closure, the fifteen year contract was not renewed and his services were no longer required. Las Vegas should mourn the loss, but the dining scene has changed. Today is more about gourmet burgers and pizza slices, than a true gourmet meal.

The meal started with 2 oysters each which were very fresh and topped with a bit of caviar to add some saltiness.  Following was a very thin sliced raw swordfish marinated in citrus and topped with a bit of greenery, truly excellent think Shusi done Italian style!  The pasta was hand rolled and served in a wonderful Bolognese sauce.  Not a large dish but just enough. Then on to a grilled sea bass which was also very fresh and perfectly cooked.  Many reviewers mentioned the rack of lamb and that is the main choice on the tasting menu currently and it is really superb.  I think it is a slightly more mature rack than is typically served in restaurants and as such is larger and stronger flavored which when combined with the spices and roasted made it just the best. The 2 ribs served each was plenty.  The desert selection was perfect and provided a nice ending without being overfull.  Total tab with the meal, wine, tax and tip came to $322 for two plus $26 at the bar beforehand.

My husband and I went here for our 4th Wedding Anniversary. It was all part of the surprise evening I had planned for my husband. The Bellagio concierge helped me with the reservation (we stayed a night at the hotel even though we live in LV), especially since we would be eating after seeing ""O"". 

Once seated at our table, with a view of the fountain, our server was gracious enough to give us time to look over the menu and make recommendations. Here's what we ordered (yes, I remember b/c it was that good!):

shared anitpasto-- Frittura di Calamari, Gamberetti, Carciofi e Asparagi-- absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly, esp. the asparagus.

shared pasta-- Ravioli di Vitello e Funghi, Salsa d'Asparagi, Sugo d'Arrosto-- the ravioli were large which is one of the reasons why there were only 10 on the plate. I say ""only"" because we could have eaten more.

my dish-- Pizza Preziosa-- yummie!!! So good and cooked just right. The arugola served fresh on top, after the pizza comes out of the oven, as it should be served.

my husband's dish-- he can't remember and neither can I. Afterall, I didn't eat it. LOL

When we were asked if we wanted dessert, we said no but the restaurant had a surprise for us. When the check was brought to the table, we were given the creme brulee (complimentary) and written on it was ""Happy Anniversary"". No, I did not set this up but was done by the concierge. The creme brulee was OMG! So good!!!

The fountains are beautiful, though.  The night started out great....  nice table, early reservations and not too many people in the dining room.  

The service was good, although the food lacked flavor and was somewhat good on paper, but not good for eating.  I really thought that the food was going to be superb as they are related to Le Cirque, but the food was not good at all.  Nothing to write home about for sure!  

We started with the lobster, crab and asparagus, creme fraiche pizza....  soggy crust and bits of lobster and a watery crab mixture...  yuck.  Then heirloom tomato with shrimp with borgata cheese - a big cheesy mess, rabbit loin stuffed with sausage - mediocre, but not delicious.  

Entrees were the octopus and calamari stew -  alot of seafood, but a bland broth.  My partner had the Swordfish Putanesca.  The fish was all chopped up in little pieces and served with spaghetti.  Even Maggianos serves better italian cuisine.

The best part of the meal was the Italian doughnuts and the panna cotta.  I do have to say, the service was good.  It was better than some other high end restaurants.  It is just too bad the food does not match the service.",8G7wFBuYnV4fZph6iprW5A,0,0,2,GfK8Ni4mXAehkTOMhUVGGA

Ordering the calamari as an appetizer, couple glasses of wine to start was already impressive service.

Recently came here with a group celebrating some special visitors in town. Absolutely remarkable service. Our table was in a small room to the right of the main dining room and overlooked the Bellagio fountains. The view was gorgeous.

The owner of Circo, Mario, sent us over a bottle of prosecco and it was a wonderful apertif to start our meal.

Two people in our group opted for the prix fix menu (I believe it was $85/person) and that contained five courses.

The remainder of our table ordered off the regular menu:

-caprese salad
-dozen oysters (delicious!)
-duck panzotti (little triangle raviolis)
-mushroom risotto
-lamb chop
-filet mignon
-sea bass (one of the specials for the evening)
-pappardelle with sausage (my selection, yummmo)

-tiramisu (my favorite of all the desserts)
-creme brulee
-pannacotta
-pineapple mango souffle
-assorted fruits

We came here for the first night of our vegas trip with an early reservation (5:45pm) so that we could make it to a show afterwards. We opted to do the pre-theatre menu ($49/person) that ended at 6pm, and we got seated and ordered just under the wire (the hostess annoyingly had us wait in the front for a few minutes even though it was pretty empty).

My sister and I ordered everything to share, we got starters of the Buffalo Mozzarella salad and the Fritto Misto. The tomatoes on the caprese were not as ripe and flavorful as I would expect, and the fried calamari had a nice crisp and delicious sauce, but was rubbery :( 
Our entrees were the Chicken and the Salmon (the star of the meal). All of the food has spectacular presentation, I might add. While the salmon was cooked nicely, almost everything else was overcooked - the chicken was extremely dry and hard to eat, as well as the polenta. The potatoes served with the salmon were soggy and hard at the same time. I have no idea how that happens. Such a shame.

Our server was conscientious about asking if we had a show to attend and they were very quick about getting us our desserts, the Tiramisu and Panna Cotta. The tiramisu was sublime, especially the ice cream, but the Panna Cotta was just strange. Pretty, but strange. Our bill came to be $164 for two of us with 2 drinks total and tip.

On the plus side, much of the food is quite good, just not as good as other strip restaurants. I had a venison dish which was quite good and a superb banana souffle for desert (presumably made the same as they do in Le Cirque next door.) 
The menu is fairly large with plenty of options for everyone and everyone at the dinner was happy with their dishes, happy but not enthralled. 

The dining room is gorgeous and the view is spectacular. You can look out the windows with a front row view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris in the background. It truly is gorgeous and in a city as hectic as Vegas, it has to be said that Circo is one of the most calming places to go and eat a dinner. You won't hear the casino floor at all and you'll have this beautiful view.

On the downside, I feel Circo is really overly expensive. I just don't feel the food, service, etc quite warrant the prices that Circo charges. If I'm going to pay the prices that Circo charges, I'd rather pay a bit more for Le Cirque or go to Gordon Ramsay Steak across the street or one of a number of places in Cosmo. 

Also, the service is horribly slow. Service in all restaurants on the strip is slow,  but I really found service at Circo to be much slower than many others.

Italian is usually not very HEALTHY fare.  

Surprisingly, you can find small portions, none of which are laden with cheese or sauces.  

It was really windy in Vegas, so I changed from a summer dress into very casual shorts.  They prefer jackets and ties, but they are not required.  Phew!  

The staff were super accommodating:
1) We were an hour late.
2) They quickened the pace of the meal, b/c we wanted to play one last time before we headed out.

Very satisfying meal, that still kept us light on our toes to throw dice:

4 glasses of wine $48
Beef Carpaccio appetizer, pounded thin, w/generous parmesan $19 
Caesar salad, w/perfectly tangy dressing $16
Rabbit wrapped in prosciutto appetizer, lean & tender $19
Salmon, cooked nice & rare $34

The prices were very reasonable.  Bread was warm, crusty, and I learned that Parmesan in the EVOO/balsamic mixture kicks arse!!!  

We decided AGAINST dessert, but we were presented with a plate full of petit fours.

Sadly, there is no 'Lake' dining at this Bellagio dining room, that would have catapulted it to FIVE stars.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,2,2,4,SAc6wrD5L9grRUSlc46Qlg

My little heart was just set on turkey and stuffing! Don't get me wrong, my evening was so special for more than one reason, but being honest about the food...

We were trying to find Le Cirque, but we found this place instead, no wait, so we went in. Pricey? Oh yes, much more than I felt comfortable with being treated to. But it was beautiful with a gorgeous view of the fountain show. It felt... as casual as fancy dining could be. I was dressed up but I saw others in more casual clothes. The waiters were fancy, put my napkin on my lap etc, and called us Sir and Madam, despite the fact we were about 20 years younger than anyone else in there.

The Turkey was alright, kinda dry, but the lovely stuffing underneath made up for it. I even got my bf to eat the brussel sprouts! His pasta, he said, was one of the best he's ever had, and my cocktail was delicious as well.

My only complaint is that we were somewhere that we could hear the waiters talking to each other, and I heard one tell the other to ""keep and eye on those guys"". They seemed to ""hover"" around us much more than the other patrons, I'm not sure why, if they thought we were gonna dine-and-dash because we were young, I don't know.

1986045,2007-03-01,5,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"Circo is supposedly one of the fine dining establishments in the Bellagio. Walking in you feel regal. Sitting down you feel taken care of. Taking in the decor- a plethora of reds and yellows, marble and silks, you feel as if you are sitting in a high class giant circus tent without the animals and trapeze artists. 

While first impressions are important, that is where the term for Circo's ""fine dining establishment"" ends. First of all let's go over the criteria of what makes a restaurant a fine dining establishment in no particular order:

-Location
-Ambiance
-Quality of Food
-Service
-Price
-Reputation

Circo is in the Bellagio. It's related to Le Cirque. It's expensive. It's looks pretty. I expected more. Was there an elephant sitting in the middle of the room because the staff at Circo pretended they didn't see it. There is something very wrong about the restaurant and it seems as if they don't care. The food selection is mediocre as well as what it actually tastes like. Nothing to jump out of your seats for. No parties for your taste buds. You won't remember any dish here as being 4 stars. Circo, being a restaurant where people actually go to eat, we have to set the food aside and focus on what makes this place a bad place to spend your evening and empty your wallet.

The service here is terrible. First of all the waiter was delivering food to the table next to us and pouring wine when he somehow jolted and poured wine down my friend's back. 

""Oh my, sorry."" 
""Oh oh!"" as we grab for our napkins to dry the excess liquid. Really we are thinking, ""What are you going to do about it?"" 
""Sir, we can have your shirt dry cleaned for you. What is your room number?""
""Oh. We're not staying at this hotel.""
""Oh. Then we can't dry clean your shirt for you.""

Well gee! You pour wine down my friend's back, ruin his shirt and you can't even get it dry cleaned because we're not staying at the Bellagio? Circo did nothing to compensate for this disaster. No curtesy appetizers, no complimentary meal, no offer to pick up the bill for dry cleaning else where, nothing. The most embarrassing to Circo is that the lovely couple next to us felt so bad they sent a very fine bottle of wine to our table, got up and apologized even though it was not their fault but the waiters. Circo does not take responsibility for their actions nor do they care about the quality of product they offer to their customers. It's a pity.",-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA,8,3,1,N4y65dmDXE2X83LExyfQyA

Dessert: berry panna cotta and ""cheesecake""... yum. The cheesecake was a ball of sweet mascarpone and cream, covered in a berry glaze and sorbet. So light and creamy at the same time... yum.

I love the atmosphere - so classy, but with a playful twist.  Views of the fountain are wonderful.

This time we shared a calamari appetizer, which was seriously some of the best calamari I've ever had in my life.  So tender and perfect flavours.  We decided to skip salad since we wanted to dessert, so for our entrees the husband had the ravioli and I had the lamb, with a side of spaghetti for the two of us.  Oh, so good.  Their lamb is always perfection and the husband was really impressed with the ravioli.  The spaghetti was the perfect side.

For dessert, their souffle of the day was a Grand Marnier, which we split.  It was sublime.

They brought us drinks, explained the menu, and got us started on oysters. I went with the Insalata di Cesare, with grilled lettuce, and a fabulous dressing, and for a main course the Pici Toscani, with Bolognese sauce. The salad was noticeable because it is the first variation on Cesare I have seen in a long time that really worked. The grilled lettuce and the stronger mustard, anchovy flavor was a hit. As to the Pici Toscana, the noodles were larger than spaghetti and hand rolled, with the pasta dressed in olive oil and served over the Bolognese. This dish was as good as it gets. It got me thinking how I could do that at home, if at all. Knockout status. My wife had the pre-theatre package, and she loved it. Desserts were a delight, with the Tiramisu, and the Panna Cotta both showing serious pastry chef attention to detail and flavor. I finished up with a coffee house worthy cappuccino.

2219873,2013-09-23,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I can honestly say that this one of the worst food experiances I have had since eating at a Uno's once when I was in hurry. I arrived at Circo with a large group of 11 people which we had a reservation for. We had asked for a table close to the windows so that we could hopefully get a view of the fountains but were seated far away in the center of the restaurant. I cannot blame them for this. I know it can be difficult to accomodate a large group in the prime location so this did not really bother me but it would have been nice.

I am a huge foodie and I have eaten at many places as well as working in the industry for a significant amount of time so I consider myself to be pretty understanding and agreeable when it comes to dining. However, this was unlike anything I have ever seen.

Our party was seated and a cocktail waitress promptly came over with i-pads containing the drink menus. Personally, I find this very odd because we are a table of 11 and obviously the restaurant only has a limited number of these i-pads so she sets down 2 at the table and we have to share and take turns sliding through the electronic pages. Completely STUPID in my opinion.... Just give me a regular drink menu... I can read just the same from paper as I can from an i-pad. So the cocktail server returns a few minutes later ready to take our drink orders. We all nod in response that we are ready to order something from her. She gets through about 4 people before leaving the table. After about 10 minutes she returns with the drinks for the 1st four people (completely ignors us as she rushes to set them down) and then leaves again. We finally had to flag down the server assistant to ask her to return so that the rest of the table could order their drinks too.

With our drinks finally in hand, we move on to order our meals. This goes pretty smoothly and we promptly get our salad courses. Then the never ending wait begins for our main courses. We waitied an hour and 30 minutes between when our salads were cleared and when we received our entrees. Now, I am very patient and don't mind a wait between courses but this was excessive even by my standards, and the rest of my table was not nearly as understanding and were vocally upset about the wait.

Most of our table ordered the Filet, which seemed mostly okay. Some were slighltly overcooked but that was not the real problem. All of the steaks were served with the nastiest asparagus that I have ever seen. These spears looked like they had been under a heat lamp in the back kitchen for hours. I mean I have seen better looking asparagus at an Outback steakhouse or a buffet line.

During out meal there was not 1 instance of any of the waitstaff coming by to check and see if everything was okay and to our liking.....which it certianly was not for nearly our whole table. It was honeslty some of the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant in all my life. The waitstaff was rude and the manager was not willing to even listen to our dismay for the issues with our food.

I would not recommend Circo. There are so many options in Vegas and many of them well worth the price. Try Mortorano's Rao's or Lavo if you are looking for Italian.",tnYbjp8-1-H46eywLyAEEA,0,0,1,SdnISmxGJYOSMtuS6Mx2Ig

The crust was good and the portion was large but that wasn't what I expected from ""the dish that people come back for"" at a restaurant like Circo.

I am giving them 3 stars because my beef carpaccio app was decent and so was my sorbet dessert.  But I don't think I'd be back again.

we also tried the dessert of the vanilla panna cotta with a strawberry compote which was very light and refreshing with the bits of citrus swimming in the berry sauce. a nice balance of tart and sweetness with the smooth vanilla speckled panna cotta.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but it was not amazing, and I'm not sure that it was worth the price.  We used our Bellagio food and dining credit, so it was essentially a ""free"" meal (other than gratuity). 

We were seated with a ""partial"" fountain view, which meant that one seat had a great view, while the other seat had no view at all.  We were not given the option to wait for a table with a full view, though we did ask.  

We were seated and shortly thereafter brought an ipad to view the drink menu.  We settled on the Nino Franco Prosecco, which was good.  The sommelier was a bit curt; he wasn't exactly impolite, but he definitely was not warm or engaging.  We found our waiter to have the same attitude.  Both were fine, but did nothing at all to engage, make suggestions, or make the evening memorable.  

We skipped appetizers, since nothing really appealed to us.  We did have the bread basket, which was lackluster.  We requested balsamic vinegar to add to the (low quality) olive oil, which was brought to us with no problem.  

For entrees, my husband had the Pollo (grilled chicken breast with potatoes and salad).  The chicken was good, but not spectacular.  The salad was a handful of baby spinach leaves with three blackberries, tossed in a very light and simple vinaigrette.  The salad made us very happy that we had not ordered a salad as an appetizer, as there was a clear lack of attention to the composition of the salad (broken bits of spinach, in a salad comprised of two ingredients, is not impressive).  

I had the Mama Egi's Ravioli, which was good but not outstanding.  The pasta was very thick, far too thick for ravioli in my opinion.  The filling was good.  The dish overall was a little too rich, and I did not quite finish it.  I was not offered cheese or ground pepper, as many Yelpers were.  

For dessert, we shared a Grand Marnier Souffle, and I had a cappuccino.  The souffle was good, and we enjoyed it.  I believe we overheard the waiter telling the table next to us that they are pre-prepared and then just finished in the Circo oven, which is why they only take 10 - 12 minutes to prepare.  The cappuccino was actually outstanding; it had good flavor and impressive foam.  

The restaurant's ambiance overall is nice, and I enjoyed the fountain view.  The service of the ""support staff""was very good, particularly the young man who refilled our water, but the head waiter and sommelier were unimpressive. Our total, for two glasses of prosecco, the chicken entree, the ravioli entree, one souffle, and one cappuccino was $121.00 (pre-tip).

Luckily, the inside made up for it. The decor was still circus themed, a bit strange, but in a more subtle way. We got a table overlooking the fountains which made for something like seven water shows. 
Maybe I'm just cheap, but I'd never been to a restaurant with levels of waiter before. All of whom were there to serve me. I felt like I was on the Titanic (pre-Iceberg). My date and I split a burrata appetizer, which was a lot of mozzarella, even for two people. I had Mama Egi's pasta; it came as a much larger portion than I anticipated and I was pretty happy about that. The pasta was delicate and creamy, exactly what it should be. The head waiter gentleman seemed more than happy to help with wine recommendations, but those sort of things intimidate me. The apple dessert was incredible and I wish I could eat it every day.

I got the steak filet with horseradish potatoes, spinach etc... it was good. I'd say on a scale of 1-10 ( with 10 being Capital Grille, this is a 6/7 ) My husband got the lamb, he did not like it. He didn't like Circo in general.

The service here is good. Its almost too good, I think it just barely crosses the line of being rushed. We came on Saturday night, 6:30, it was crowded.. I'd say mostly full, not packed.

It was busy for a Tuesday night (further complicated by a celebrity, 3 bodyguards and 2 photographers in the house), and we were seated 15 minutes after our reservation. That was fine, we were in no hurry.  We were seated and I must say, the server willingly returned the too spicy Bloody Mary that would have ruined my taste buds for dinner.  It was replaced with a specially made blended margarita (apparently their bar only made on the rocks). We made our salad and dinner choices and told our server, only for him to return 20 minutes later and say, "" I lost your order, what were you having?""  Seriously??  I know rack of lamb can take awhile and we were patient. Dinner came and it was delicious. I had the chicken breast and both that and the lamb were perfect.  My husband had to ask twice for a refill on his tea, and we were told it was a brewed tea and they were brewing more.  They didn't anticipate patrons requesting more?

2689703,2012-04-25,2,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"Absolutely, magnificently beautiful with table service that is a standard I judge other restaurants against.

First, while the theme for this restaurant is a circus, the jewel like colors and beautiful design choices just seem festive and celebratory rather than garish and loud like an actual circus.  Add to the the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, visible as they whoosh up from even the back of the room and you have an exquisite dining space.

Happily, the food and service measure up to the dining room.

My dining partner and I were both wearing tuxedos when we came and the host seating us automatically made the appropriate switch from white to black napkins.  This doesn't always happen, even at very upscale establishments.  We were asked if we had theater engagements and told our server that we were happy to have a leisurely meal.

I've dined at Circo three times and never had a disappointing dish.  Everything seems to be delivered to the table at the precise moment that it should and service is magical.  Never rushed or over pronounced and yet always there when one needs assistance.

Our last dinner consisted of caviar service, salads, Linguine with clams and finally the tenderloin.

This restaurant tend towards a high standard but is conservative on innovation.  Dishes never seem stodgy but are very classically presented.

The caviar was served in a jar in a bowl of ice with a mother of pearl serving utensil with all the traditional elements.

The salad was simple but the greens were so fresh and the flavors melded so perfectly, it was again an example of a classic presented in absolute perfection.

The same with the Linguine alla Vongole or Linguini and clams.  Beautifully prepared noodled perfectly prepared, sauced in a light sauce that perfectly complimented but didn't overwhelm the fresh clams which were perfectly cooked.  Just an exquisite treat. The filetto di manzo again was perfectly grilled with a wonderful porcini wrapped pate that was mouthwatering.  Everything was done with delicacy and restraint.  

We finished with a grand marnier souffle that again arrived at the table in the perfect state of doneness.

Circo is not the most innovative restaurant on the strip but its utmost attention to every detail of the dining experience make it an always reliable choice of a ravishingly perfect meal.  It is also worth checking out the small but beautiful bar area where this attention to detail is followed through in the mixing of drinks.",GodI_diMv1dgOFdg8-CyJw,4,2,5,Hp5PFkRIaDVwhVRyUtAaxQ
2719550,2013-03-18,3,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I love this restaurant! By far my most favorite meal during this trip to Vegas. Walking into the restaurant, I noticed the most beautiful red and yellow roses on every table. The hostess said that they change them every few days. I'm sure it costs them a lot, but they were a nice touch.

The waitstaff was extremely friendly and our waiter was great. We got to talking with and each time he came to the table, he'd tell us a new story. 

For my appetizer, I ordered the heirloom tomato salad with burrata. One of the top 10 most amazing things I've ever eaten. I had been dying to try burrata and it was out of this world. It was creamy and you could taste the olive oil. I wish I'd had a never ending supply. Tasted great with the tomatoes and arugula. 

For my meal, I ordered the duck pansotti. Delicious! They don't give you too many since they are a bit heavy. The sauce was some kind of orange emulsion and you could really taste the orange. I also sampled the tagliatelle with pheasant ragu and shaved black truffles and really enjoyed it. 

For dessert, we had the bomboloni which chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce. The waiter also recommended the creme brûlée. I am not a big creme brûlée fan, but this was amazing! 

Lastly, try to get a seat by the windows. You will have a great view of the Bellagio fountains, as well as the Eiffel Tower.

Though Circo is heavily overpriced, the quality and taste of the served food is just as good as almost any other high-end Vegas place. I had the Pesce Scallops special, which was by far the best scallop dish I have ever had. The dessert menu is mouthwatering; make sure to have the donuts.

2759495,2010-01-18,1,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"Went here with five friends last November.

We were seated promptly after arriving and got a table near the windows, with a great view of the Bellagio fountain.  Unfortunately, I got a seat with my back (mostly) to the fountain, so I couldn't see much.  D'oh!  In general, the staff were very attentive and helpful throughout the process.

Started off with some fancy drinks and some oysters, which were served promptly.  I got the Noce Caffe, which was espresso with walnut liqueur and some other stuff.  The oysters were good and fresh.

Appetizers:  The hand-rolled spaghetti was quite possibly the best pasta I've ever had.  Thick, chewy, tasty, and with an amazing bolognese sauce.  The swordfish carpaccio and ahi tartare were both excellent, but not quite as  memorable as the pasta.

I ordered the potato-crusted king salmon, which was perfectly cooked.  Next time I come here (and I most definitely will), however, I'd probably get the filet mignon instead.  A couple people in the group commented that it was the best beef they had ever had.

We didn't have time to order desserts, since we were going to Cirque du Soleil right afterwards.  They did give us a complimentary (and excellent) crème brûlèe, though, since it was someone's birthday.

The whole meal cost about $90 per person, including the fancy drinks.  Good deal, to the extent that a $90 meal can be a good deal.  The following night, we ate at l'Atelier.  I'd say the food at l'Atelier was slightly better, but almost twice as expensive.",AjU1dYlzNVi_GRiWthHjhg,2,1,5,sn-vNzPMOmZkQ7AIV2svJw

Arrived at Circo around 6:15p and was seated immediately - only the tables by the window overlooking the fountain were full.

Service was impeccable - water glasses constantly and subtly refreshed with a smile.  Four different kinds of bread in the bread basket - my favorites were the focaccia and olive.  I ordered the mushroom/sausage pizza and it was delicious!  Being a huge fan of thin crust pizza, I usually leave behind huge chunks of crust.  Not to worry here.  There was also just a hint of sea salt in the dough, which was baked to near perfect crispness.  The toppings were hearty and flavorful - housemade sausage, mushrooms, olive and artichokes.  The menu should come with a warning though - I only had enough stomach real estate for 1/2 of it and gave away the leftovers on the way back to my hotel.

I paired the pizza with a glass of Rose wine - Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Rosato - and hope that they keep this excellent rose on their wine list for a while - fruity but not too sweet.

2949018,2013-08-07,1,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"We chose to go back to this restaurant for delicious Tuscan cuisine and beautiful fountain views! We asked specifically for a table next to the windows, and also semi private. We were running late for our 7:30 reservation, I called to let them know that we would be late, please save our good table. We did some walking from Mandarin Oriental to Crystal to get on the tram to Bellagio. Got there nearly 8, the host still managed to give us a nice little table right next to the windows at the semi private dining area, I got to see the fountain show throughout the entire dinner date! 

Same as last time, this is a slow dinner place, everything goes very slowly, just take time, no rush, the drink menu is on iPads now, very easy to use and read. I asked our server for a not very sweet but strong cocktail, he recommended Cosmopolitan, it was a great pour, very strong. Hubby had white wine while we went through the menu for that night, it was a bit different from last time, they change menu seasonally. Their wine menu is a bit pricey, starting at $60 a bottle, specialty cocktail is $14 each. 

They bring complimentary bread after food order, if you are so hungry, better tell the server that you would like some bread first. The assorted bread basket was great, very delicious. 

We decided to skip appetizer, ordered smoked Scottish salmon pizza with American caviar on the top. The pizza was amazing. Thick layers of smoked salmon, lots of caviar on top. I kept on eating from one slice to 3 slices, until hubby reminded me that we still had entrees... Okie....he was right, I got a bit stuffed already! 

Hubby had fillet 12 oz medium rare, the meat was perfect, so tender and juicy with red wine sauce, the mashed potato and grilled asparagus were light with enough flavors! 

I had seafood risotto, grilled main lobster, Atlantic jumbo shrimps, diver scallops, and Dungeness crab meat: the scallops were so tender, melted in my mouth immediately, the shrimp and crab meat were fresh and tender, the lobster was a bit overcooked, the meat was a bit chewy, the risotto was a bit chewy to my liking too.. So in my opinion, this dish was a bit under my expectation for $58.

I had a glass of Port to go with traditional tiramisu, hubby had double shot espresso. I always have to have an after dinner drink, it makes me feel very refreshing after a big meal. The tiramisu was very delicious, very creamy with enough sweetness! 

Our dinner went on for 3 hours, we took time to enjoy every bite of our delicious food, and sipping on our drinks slowly. The Bellagio fountain shows made our dinner even more enjoyable, more romantic... It was just perfect! I love the ambience of this restaurant, upscale yet still relaxing, the circus themed decors add lots of fun with bright colors. The daisy flowers on each table were so pretty, I just love colors! 

Our drink and food servers were very friendly, kept our drinks coming, checked up on us all the time, even though there were a few bigger parties around us. We were so full in the end, the portions were huge! Even the Port glass was a bit bigger than usual. $300 plus dinner tab was a lot, but at least we had more than enough food and drinks. They can also charge the tab to the room we stay at Mandarin Oriental, so hubby just put in his last name and room number on the tab, very convenient. I believe we did the same thing last time we stayed at Vdara. Funny thing was the front desk staff at check out in Mandarin Oriental asked hubby if Circo was any good, cause he saw the Circo restaurant tab was almost as expensive as nightly rate....Hubby replied that it was nearly perfect of course! 

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, so romantic and relaxing, I highly recommend a romantic dinner date by the windows! 

Ps. The portions are huge, if you are not that hungry, you can do split plates for $3  charge on main course. Hyde lounge is just next door, some lounging time after dinner perhaps.",-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,9,6,5,6t0XMDhsyYryrn3Zt06EUw

My two girlfriends treated me to a birthday dinner here the 2nd week of September. We had originally planned to eat at STK (Cosmopolitan) but because we booked so late we couldn't get a reservation there. Luckily it worked out in our favour :)

We were seated promptly and given a table overlooking the Bellagio fountain. We decided to skip the apps and go straight for the mains. I ordered the rack of lamb. By far - probably the best lamb I have ever eaten. The herb encrusted lamb was everything I could have dreamed of - tender, juicy, crispy herb crust, and the meat was literally melting in my mouth. Definitely worth every single penny. I don't remember much of the accompaniments since the lamb was the superstar of the plate. 

I was surprised with a mini tiramisu 'Happy Birthday!' dessert. Doubly espressos ensued and were perfection. All the servers and our sommelier went out of their way to make the night memorable and beyond exceptional. I will for sure come back here on my next trip to Vegas.

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table to share along with some other drinks. It took the servers a while to refill our drinks and water, but the biggest faux pas of them all? They took away our bottle of wine before we had even finished it! There was still at least a good glass left, and the server just whisked it away without asking if we were done.

All in all, the service SUCKED. Servers were basically non-existent and don't even get me started on the maitre d'.

3134721,2011-03-15,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I came here for dinner after seeing O, which was AMAZING, but I wish I could say the exact same about the meal. Although it had it's good points, for such a fancy place (with an even 'fancier' price tag) I was expecting more of a 5 star dining experience.

My boyfriend and I got to sit at probably one of the best tables in the place which was a great start. We got a nice little table for two right by the window so we had a front row seat for the famous fountain show. It was a very nice setting in a quiet corner of the restaurant. Before we even went to the Cirque show we looked at the menu and knew that we just HAD to get the Pici, homemade thick spaghetti in abolognese sauce.
I liked that they offer the pasta dishes in appetizer portions because that dish definitely would have been way too much as an entire entree. We shared the Pici as our starter and then I opted for the burrata salad as my entree. I really wanted their special rib-eye but the waiter told me they had already sold out of it :(  It was late in the evening though so it was understandable. My boyfriend chose the prosciutto wrapped rabbit for his entree and after ordering we just sat patiently waiting for our food while watching the water-works. 

When the pasta came out it looked simply wonderful. They split the plate for us so we each got our own little bowl of thick spaghetti with scrumptious meat sauce. The noodles were delicious, definitely freshly made and so nice and chewy. The sauce was also great; very rich with classic bolognese flavors, the perfect consistency and ratio of meat to sauce. And what was really nice in my opinion was that they put the sauce underneath the noodles! 
I had never thought of doing this before but it gave the pasta more of a chance to shine without being completely doused in sauce. There was a nice little blanket of cheese on top of the noodles too with a nice crispy fried basil leaf to top it all off. 

While we were eating our pasta though, I overheard the table next to us ordering and one of the women asked to have the rib eye. When the waiter told her the same thing he told me, that it was sold out, she practically begged him to check because she didn't want anything else. Now, this is what kind of bothered me because if I had pleaded like a little child for a dish that they told me they didn't have, would I have gotten my way? 
Of course somehow this woman got what she wanted since as the saying goes, 'the squeaky wheel gets the grease'. I've always hated that saying though because whining about something shouldn't get you what you want. This little bit of unfairness just kind of upset me and turned me off a bit because I felt like I had been lied to. 

Also, I was rather disappointed once my burrata arrived. Even though the cheese was nice and creamy, the tomatoes were pathetic. They were pale and thin, mealy in texture and for $22, I should be getting some gorgeous heirlooms!! My boyfriend enjoyed his rabbit though and it was pretty tasty but in my opinion it was also a bit dry. The flavors were all there but the execution was just not up to par for this kind of restaurant. Overall, the pasta was pretty much what saved this place in my book. The nice table and decor was helpful too, but just not enough to put this place at the top my list. 

I would come back again if I were in Vegas because the homemade spaghetti was delicious and not something that you can find just anywhere. I think my suggestion for people wanting to try this place would be to stick to the pastas. They all sounded wonderful and I would truly hope that they are all homemade. Also, I recommend coming earlier so you don't have to get your hopes up for one of the specials only to find that they our 'sold out'.

Circo is pricey, but hey, when you are dining at any fine hotel in Vegas such as we were at The Bellagio, you come to expect that. The important thing is that you feel you got what you paid for.

Their buffalo mozzarella appetizer (really just a caprese) was alright. The tomatoes and the peppers made the dish. Again nothing special, but quite good when eaten with their house breads.

As we had italian the night prior (which wasn't all that great) I was hesitent and skeptical from the begining.

I have to say that Circo greatly suprassed my expectations.  The choices on the menu were vast and covered an great variety of Italian foods.  

The wine list was very extensive although on the pricey side.  

We wanted to sit by the window to see the fountains and so we showed up a half hour early for our reserved time stating that we would wait if a window table opened.  Within 5 minutes we were seated and at a table right by the window with a great fountain view.  

The entire staff was curtous and attentive.  The food was great!

The only downfall and the only reason I did not rate this 5 stars was that once we had finnished dinenr our server appeared to have vanished and took a long time to get us our check.  Also dessert took a while to get to us.

The wandering photographer charged way too much for pictures and in hind site we should have just said no thank you.  At $70.00 for one folder of some basic pictures that was a mistake on our part.  Always ask the cost up front.

I wouldn't exactly say you get a lot for your buck, but what you do get is amazing lamb chops and steaks. Side dishes are above par, and the wine is too, but you do pay. My first visit there, with my friends (party of five) came out to about $600.00, but that was partly due to some expensive wines. The location is superb. If you have ever been the Belagio and have seen the water show from the sidewalk, well in Circo, you see the show from your seat inside and it is fabulous. (Oh no I di'int just use the word fabulous)

My first of two visits here was a few years ago when Ocean's 11 was being filmed and as we were chowing, in walks Clooney and two hot trophey's in tow. This is definitely a place stars visit. Food really is good and if price is no object to you, then the good service and food make it worth it. Of course, there are a lot of choices in Vegas, this place just happens to have a great location.  Ask for a window seat. Of course, if price is a factor, keep looking.

It's almost impossible to find authentic Italian cuisine in the states, but Circo comes close. The layout of the restaurant is exceptional and a number of the tables have a view of the Bellagio fountains. The restaurant is styled in a circus theme (as is Le Cirque next door). It's refreshing to find a fine dining restaurant set in such a light atmosphere.  

Food:

Ostriche (half dozen seasonal oysters, classic cocktail, mignonette sauce): Incredibly fresh oysters with delicious dipping sauces. 

Pici (hand rolled thick spaghetti, bolognese sauce, aged pecorino cheese): not a fan of the noodles, but the pecorino cheese was perfect. 

Tagliatelle (fresh tomato sauce and basil): My favorite thing on the menu by far, all of the flavors are extremely light and flavorful.

Ambience: 4.5 Stars (Fountains 5 stars, decor 4 stars)

Gee -- I really wanted to be able to give Circo a glowing review, but I can't.  We went in for the pre-show prix fixe menu and the fountain side dining, and left having enjoyed the fountains and the service (particularly the sommelier - I cannot say enough good things about William, knowledgeable, great service, personable, approachable) and the wine, but not the food.

Hubby & I ordered essentially the same items on the prix fixe menu: (a) started with the Wagyu carpaccio (excellent and by far the best thing we at that meal and during our entire weekend in LV); (b) entree was the beef filet (although they were technically med-rare, they had obviously been sitting for a while before we got them and were just kind of ""blah"" -- they should have been much more flavorful); (c) desserts (1) vanilla w/ rhubarb panna cotta (rhubarb was nice, panna cotta was too congealed and dense) and (2) tiramisu was nice, though a bit dry.  The desserts had the feel of a mid-range (Royal Carribean) cruise ship dinner table (not buffet) dessert.  Just nothing memorable when it could have been much better.

Looking back, I think where our food ran into problems was with the pacing of the meal.  It (the meal progress) obviously was set for a quick table turn, but we, on the other hand, took our time conversing with sommelier, enjoying our wine and conversation, and I don't think our waiter communicated our pace to the kitchen.  We lingered over our carpaccio, and I think it threw off the rest of the meal.

Water and bread service was nice and efficient.

Atmosphere was nice with a relaxed elegance and the fountains are just magical -- but then again, I am easily drawn to the water!  I could sit there or at Fontana Bar and watch them all day & night, if I could afford the bar tab!

I wish I could say I plan on going back, but we probably won't.  At this price point, there are better dining options at several restaurants with fountain views.

Fish was cooked perfectly. It was tender and not dry at all. And the purple potato was awesome! It was layered with lots slices of purple potatoes in truffle oil.

Let me tell you this was a FANTASTIC DEAL.  Started with nice diced tuna tartare.  Super fresh . Bit of creme fresh and caviar.  Nice size portion. Then comes one large sauteed scallop wrapped in proscuitto.  Bit of sauce.  Perfect.  Then a small portion of a homemade tube pasta with a meat ragu sauce.  This was one of the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked pasta, so fresh it was still evolving.  I could have been done eating right here, but then comes the sea bass.  Two nice pieces of roasted fish on top of several large artichokes with a great sauce.  I'm bad and cant remember the sauces- sorry to much wine- but they were all perfect matches for the dish.  Then comes the meat.  Two full size lamb chops. Tasting menu?  Way more than at taste!  Perfectly cooked, fantastic sauce and some awesome scalloped potatoes.  Way to much food. But then... you get a choice of deserts.  full size portion no less and each person can order which one they want .  Delicious finish. 

 And the wine parings.  I'm not talking about one sip of wine with each course.  I'm talking about a half a glass ( and in some cases what might even be a full glass compared to what some places now call a glass!).  All Italian of course and all really quite good.  Each one was expertly paired with the dishes.  Very impressive.

Service was good to excellent. A lot of these vegas high end places have trouble with consistent service. I'm guessing lots of turnover and hard to train folks for high end service, but really had nothing to complain about.  

Restaurant has a great setting overlooking Bellagio lake (if you get a table close enough to the windows).

They open at 5:30 and won't seat you before then, which is kind of annoying.  Also the hostess doesn't seem to be great at her job, as I checked in around 5:15 and when I came back in at 5:30 she seemed to have completely forgotten who I was.  Wth lady, there were only two other groups, you couldn't even make a note of my name?  

Despite that annoying beginning, however, the service from that point on was flawless.  Your waiter takes you to your table personally and is very attentive for the rest of your meal thereafter.

The bread basket they brought over was just ok and the bread didn't taste very fresh but it was fine.  For appetizers, we had the fritto misto, the caprese and the caesar salad.  All three were delicious; the basil on the caprese is served in the form of a mousse which was pretty cool.

For our entrees, my mom had the beef, my dad had the ravioli and i had the amatriciana.  All 3 were excellent.  For dessert, we finished with the chocolate lava cake and I asked for a big candle since it was my dad's birthday.  The waiter was very apologetic that they didn't have a big candle and instead offered to stick two candles together, which I thought was funny and sweet.

The sommelier was helpful in picking out exactly what I wanted. I found a wine on the list that I very much enjoy, but wanted to try something new but similar. He found a wine that had many of the same characteristics but of a completely different region (South American vs. my familiar Italian bottle). *That's* what fine dining is all about.

Their dessert menu had so many fun choices. We were quite satiated, but had to give them a try. If you're a little budget conscious and intimidated by the cost of a full meal, make a late reservation and just come for dessert! You won't be disappointed.

3968727,2014-07-27,6,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I decided to go to Circo, one of the few restaurants I hadn't been to at the Bellagio.  I had checked the menu online and was going to go with the pre-theatre prix fixe menu because I was going to see 'O' again at 7:30 and this would be perfect time wise.

I was seated right after Circo opened.  The gentleman who showed me to the table brought me an iced tea and then I sat.  Shortly after, a runner brought me a nice bread basket, and then I sat.  After 15 minutes, as I watched people at other tables who came in after me looking over their menus, I turned to the woman who brought the bread and asked if there was a server for my table.  One of the servers heard me and the apologies started for thinking I already ordered because I had bread on my table.

The bread service is quite large with three varieites served with olive oil.

My server did come and brought a menu with him.  He noted some of the outstanding things on the menu.  I then asked if he had the pre-theatre menu.  Note, there was a large sign at the entrance to Circo with the menu and choices on it.  He brought me the menu and after a few minutes he came back and took my order.  He was also made aware that I had a show to get to.

I ordered the fritto misto for a starter.  This is mostly calamari with a few green beans and zucchini added.  It's served with a cherry tomato sauce.  This was very good.  The sauce, not a traditional marinara, was very good.  I was surprised by the large portion for a pre-theatre menu.

For the main course, I got Mamma Egi's ravioli, ravioli filled with sheep's milk ricotta cheese, spinach, and swiss chard in a sage butter sauce.  The ravioli were topped with grated cheese and the server asked if I wanted more cheese and/or freshly ground pepper.  I did take some ground pepper.  The ravioli were very, very good--the filling so smooth and tasty.  Again, I was surprised by the large portion size. 

For dessert, I opted for the vanilla crème brûlée on the menu which wasn't the same choice as the online menu.  I had wanted to try the Nutella panna cotta but it was not to be.  With dessert, I was brought a dish with two chocolate biscotti and two mignardises, the best being a small meringue cookie.  The crème brûlée was good but nothing different than I've had before.

Service was off.  The check listed a team number rather than a server and the team just wasn't on that night.  Sitting for 15 minutes without a menu until I asked?  Aren't menus given to you when you're seated.  Evidently, Circo does this a different way.  

When a restaurant advertises its pre-theatre on a large sign and on the website, it should be given to you when you get the regular menu.  Ordering from the pre-theatre menu doesn't make me less of a customer than those who order off the regular menu.  Before leaving, the main server asked me if I wanted more cookies and I politely declined.  As I was putting away my credit card and getting my charge slips together, another server came with a plate of those cookies.  I politely declined again.  

Finally, I really dislike when a website has a menu and then it's different than the ""real"" one.  Crème brûlée is good, but I really wanted to experience that Nutella panna cotta.  If you're going to do an online menu, keep it up-to-date.

This would normally be a 4 star review if I was rating simply the food.  The service was off such that I can't give it the four stars.  There have been reports that Circo would be closing this spring.  If the reports are true, is the service a sign of lack of care in some respect?",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,7,3,Y2Wb_8KiGjAC2bNUMKZQ0A

For our appetizer, we ordered the Antipasto del Circo per La Tavola, which came with various cuts of meat, cheeses, and fruits. Everything was fresh and tasted great. I liked how you could order the platter based on the number of people at your table.

I ordered the Capesante (prosciutto-wrapped scallops), which was delicious, especially with the sauce it came with. The scallops were perfectly cooked, but I would've preferred the prosciutto to be crispier. Although the dish only comes with 3 scallops, it was actually pretty filling.

It's real Tuscan fare with fun surroundings.  And the view doesn't get much better.  You have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains which really makes you feel like you've been transported from the buzz of Vegas to the quiet serenity of Tuscany.

We started our journey with the spring salad with toasted walnuts, gala apples and blue cheese crostini.  The balsamic champagne vinegarette was light and refreshing and the cheese didn't overwhelm my palate.  

Next, I ordered the small ($20 for the small, $30 for large) spaghetti bolognese.  The spaghetti tasted like it was fresh made with large noodles with lots of texture, not gummy or chewy and the bolognese tasted as if its been simmered for hours.  It had the lightest notes of wine, rosemary and fresh tomatoes.  

The hubby ordered the specialty of the house which is the lamb chops.  They were perfectly cooked and the spice rub on the outside didn't overpower the meat.  

If you are unsure what to get as the bartenders while you are waiting for your table for their recommendations.  They are knowledgeable of the menu and offer great advice.  

Also, make sure you make a reservation otherwise, its not likely you will get a table, but you can always try to belly up to the bar.

Wine list was great, they had a Ferrari Carano Siena red for $59, and if you've never tried the Siena, I highly recommend it.  We love it, it's such a great red wine that most people will enjoy because it's not ""too much"" of anything, not too dry, not sweet, just a very well-rounded red.

My husband and I shared a beet salad (I have been obsessed with beet salads lately, they are suddenly on every menu and I order them every time. It's becoming a problem).  The salad was just okay, kind of boring.  We also shared the gnocchi with lobster and it was very disappointing.  The gnocchi were really mushy, almost like mashed potato consistency, nothing like any gnocchi I've ever had.  Gnocchi should have a little bit of a bite, IMO, and this was just mush.  Yuck.

We both ordered the same entree (this NEVER happens!) the veal milanese, a breaded, bone-in veal chop with a lightly dressed green salad on top.  It was good, the veal was very juicy and had good flavors, but the breading was a bit too crispy.

The view of the Bellagio fountains was amazing and the restaurant was so beautifully decorated.  The service was good, we had a very nice server who was knowledgable and attentive.

We decided on a trip last weekend to try a new place in Vegas, and after checking out the menu and a few reviews, Circo seemed like the place that fit the bill.

We arrived for our reservation, and were promptly seated at a table with a view of the fountains, as requested.  This was about the last time I even remember being satisfied at this restaurant.

Several groups around us were served several times before our waiter ever returned to go over the menu.  It was about 15 minutes from the time we received our menus to anyone ever returning to our table.

We had informed the person we made the reservation with that we had a show to attend more than 2 hours after our reservation, but just wanted to ensure we had enough time.

After the atrocious wait time for even a drink order, the waiter finally acknowledged our table and just asked if we were ready to order, failing to cover anything on the menu, give any sort of introduction, or talk about the chefs specials.  If this was standard for the restaurant I could understand, however we heard him give this introduction to every table seated after us that was nearby.

I reminded him politely after taking my order that we did have a show to get to, and just making sure we could leave on time.  His reply was a dry ""We'll do what we can"".

Our food came in a reasonable amount of time after ordering, though It'd be hard for me to call it quickly... given the pace of the night so far, this was a bit uptempo.

After finishing our meal and having our plates cleared, we waited another 15 minutes before our waiter returned.  He brought a special dessert for our friend whose birthday we were celebrating.  It was a nice touch, but just too little too late.  Also at this point, he failed to leave the check behind, even though I had told him we needed to be somewhere.

Finally the check arrived, about 20 minutes before showtime... so we were forced to hurry out of the restaurant and on to the theatre.

The food itself was tasty, nothing to rave about, but adequate... although everyone felt the portions did not justify the price, except for the pizza.

After a weekend of such pleasant experiences in a town that prides itself on service, it was literally heartbreaking to have such an awful evening in this restaurant.

Once all of us arrived, we were seated very quickly at a table close to the main window.  This window overlooks the fountain, so you get a great show every 30 minutes.  

All of the restaurants in the Bellagio seem to have a very similar drink menu, but I was in a beer mood so I got a Stella.  

My table got the Giardino Di Mare for an appetizer, which is like a seafood platter.  The oysters are cold water oysters, which are smaller and more full of flavor.  The jumbo prawns were great.  The crab salad was just ok, I have had better.  The lobster and tuna tartare were both fantastic. 

I got the Scrigno Di Mare Risotto.  It had lobster, crab, scallops, and prawns with tomatos and basil.  I had steak the past 2 nights so I wanted some seafood.  For $58, it didn't seem worth it.  It was good, don't get me wrong, just not really up to par with the price tag.  

We got the Crème Brulee as a dessert, and it was worth it.  Very well done.

The pasta was delicious, I ordered the Pappardelle, but after tasting my husband's Pici Toscani, we switched. My husband is sweet like that. The Pappardelle was amazing, it was incredibly savory. However the Pici Toscani was bursting with flavor and the hand rolled spaghetti was just perfect. We had a souffle with strawberries for dessert which was, as Ciara G. would put it, 'Church'.

Atmosphere: BEAUTIFUL. The inside is full of color. I feel like I'm in a circus tent - a super high class one (if those even exist). The seating is a bit tight, but it's still nice nonetheless. Also, if you get seated next to the window, you get to watch the fountain show a few times (and they play the music inside the restaurant).

Food: I started with the Panzanella Salad-Ahi Tuna and Traditional Tuscan Bread Salad. The Ahi Tuna was soft and tasted amazingly fresh. For dinner, I got the Grilled 5-oz tenderloin & prawns - a sizable amount, but the meat wasn't as tasty and seemed a bit charred; I probably shouldn't have asked for medium well. The prawns were large and filling though. Dessert was tiramisu - it was a rather large portion of it and I was so full that I didn't get to fully enjoy it - bummer.

My family tried the other options on the prix fixe menu, and overall they enjoyed them as well. I was told the spaghetti tasted light, fresh and healthy. My dad ordered the Panna Cotta (which has this jello texture to it) for dessert, not knowing exactly what it was. When he received it, we he asked him to remind us what he got, and he said: ""Something jiggly."" Needless to say, it was flavorful yet not too sweet and I actually enjoyed it.

Service: A-ok. The guy was friendly but he didn't check up on us too much. Other people brought us our plates and they were friendly as well.

Part of famed restaurateur Sirio Maccioni's empire.  Circo offers Italian inspired food with a few hidden gems of true authenticity.  But first:

RANT:  In whose mind is this an ""osteria""?  An osteria, the simplest, most austere type of Italian eatery.  Pastas, grilled or roasted meats, endless glasses of house wine. Good, simple living.  With it's beautifully crafted dishes, whimsical, lake side dining room, 900 selection wine cellar, this is not an osteria.

Searching for the authentic, an excellent fritto misto.  Lightly coated, perfectly cooked, crisp fried calamari zucchini flowers with a vibrant cherry tomato sauce.   The Antipasto del Circo per La Tavola is equally simple and delicious.  A good selection of Italian cheese, cured salumi and fruits.  

For secondi, the most classic of pastas shine.  The Buccatini al Amatriciana near Roman perfect.  Toothsome, fresh pasta enveloped with an acidic sauce of pancetta, tomato, wine and pecorino romano.  Not to be outdone, the Gnocchi al Pesto Gratinati.  Perfect pillows in a warm, herbaceous pesto tossed with Parmigianino.  A velvety rich bite accented by toasted pine nuts for texture.

Finally the Bistecca alla Fiorentina.  Although not from the famed Chianina cow of Tuscany, the 40 day aged porterhouse for two, cooked very rare and dressed simply with olive oil is excellent.  Festive, fun to eat.  Nuff said.  The rack of lamb with a pecorino and thyme crust is equally good.  Very meaty, well trimmed, tender and perfectly cooked throughout.  

Good plate of flavorful biscotti and some vin santo make for a classic dessert.

Very good, friendly and efficient service.  Excellent Italian centric wine list with many reasonably priced bottle from a wide variety of DOCGs.

As we sip our amaro, the words of Anthony Bourdain ring true:  ""Into each life a little bitterness"".

My date and I were running behind and Circo staff kindly honored our reservation even though we were about 30 minutes late.  We had a great seat by the window which allowed us to catch some of the fountain show over dinner.  The ambiance was definitely bright and festive, and while it wasn't to my particular taste, it was fun and fit in with all the over-the-topness that Vegas is.

The cocktails were poured stiff which I enjoyed but is definitely a matter of taste.  As we were running a little late and were supposed to catch ""O"" later, we were prompt with our orders and our waitress was very accommodating and friendly given our time-crunch.

We started with the Beef Carpaccio and both enjoyed it.  It was a nice and light starter though slightly on the salty side.  Next up, was a Sausage and Vegetable Risotto for my date and Pan-seared Scallops with truffle for myself, both specials of the day.

My Pan-seared Scallops were mostly fantastic (one scallop was smaller and turned out a little rubbery and over-cooked), and the truffles were absolutely delicious as expected.  The green beans were simple and prepared aldente.

The Risotto on the other hand was pretty bad, as the rice was very noticeably undercooked.  In hindsight, given our time-crunch, perhaps Risotto wasn't the best selection we could have made, but there you go.  When the manager came by and asked how everything was, we let him know about the Risotto.  He apologized and asked if we would like a different entree instead, noting that he could have any pasta dish ready in five minutes.  We thanked him but declined as we were in a hurry.

When the bill came he let us know he removed the Risotto from the bill which was entirely unnecessary.  Every interaction we had with the staff of the restaurant (host, waitress, manager) stood out as exemplary in an era where I find service to generally be poor.  Hence I am giving Circo the benefit of the doubt with four-stars.  I simply docked one-star for a poor dish.  I will be back and update my review at that time.",c3vzEuSGS9bMTSIsbkxdrQ,2,1,4,qg_GHFmoaOgo07kP1N2NMQ

With the restaurant a longterm member of my Vegas ""to-visit"" list and now scheduled to close in 2014 it was with a big smile that I booked Circo when friends from out of town perused the menu and agreed it looked excellent, a smile that would again emerge the moment we entered the whimsical room only to be led to the best seat in the house and a smile that would last throughout the subsequent three hours of pristine pastas and pizza, decadent desserts, and even a torchon of foie gras from Le Cirque next door.  Fluid in service from beginning to end despite our request for courses to be served family style it was with bread and a sturdy, aromatic Margherita that our evening began and moving through a silky round of foie with decidedly sweet accoutrements it was with a trio of pastas that the meal truly began to wow, each a textbook preparation of the respective noodle/dumpling and the sauces rich without being heavy - particularly the meltingly-thin ravioli.  Clearly over ordering but happy to indulge, a single secondi of lightly braised lamb arrived rife with grassy notes beneath a savory glaze while the accompanying bowl of polenta proved sticky, rich, and decadent - the latter carrying right over to desserts, each excellent but the towering cloud of banana truly special and every bit as good as the one being served next door, still one of my favorite soufflés to date.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,3,5,48-2tlpAXo_pK4eXNZ93mQ
5294761,2012-06-26,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I went to the sister restaurant in New York and enjoyed it very much. Was staying at the Bellagio this past weekend and was feeling Italian, so gave the Vegas locale a try.

The restaurant was similarly decorated with red drapes on the ceiling and a spinning circus themed chandelier in the main room. But being situated right on the lake, dining in the evening was especially pleasant with the fountain show in the background (if you're lucky enough to store a table by the windows).

Oysters on the half shell - fresh, sauces are good. only thing is that the oysters were so small! =(

Beef carpaccio - great looking slices of meat with arugula and shaved Parmesan cheese, but all I really tasted was the arugula... I was craving something else on it for a more kick of flavor.

Pancetta wrapped scallops - well cooked, really enjoyed the sauces that came with it.

Fisherman's stew - the soup flavor was fantastic, we asked for a 2nd basket of bread to soap up the remainder. the pieces was seafood was fresh and bigger than I expected for a stew.

A really solid meal in a beautiful atmosphere. Unfortunately while everything was good, there wasn't anything too special to savor and remember Circo by, unlike the amazing green pea ravioli I had at the New York location.",0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q,0,0,3,ni0TeBwgAh2XS65Ff2Hmyw

Try the Colorado rack of lamb. It was cooked perfectly at a medium rare temperature, and was without a doubt the best rack of lamb I've ever had. It was one of those rare dishes you hope never ends.

The oysters were also excellent, as was the caprese salad. 

Our waiter was one of the best I've ever had and, while I don't remember his name, he reminded me of Kevin Spacey and gave us a free dessert for my fake birthday.

Plus, those world-famous Bellagio fountains are in the background, providing perhaps the most romantic scenery Vegas has to offer.

5368729,2014-09-29,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"The concierge at the Green Valley Ranch recommended this place...Wasn't impressed, came for dinner on a Wednesday night. Super crowded and it was 9 pm. Got more of a diner-like atmosphere rather than a fine dining establishment.  A (get'em in get 'em out, gotta turn these tables as soon as we can) vibe. 

When we made the reservations asked for a table at the window at 8:30 to watch the fountain show, when we arrived we were told it was going to be another 15 minutes for ""that"" table wasn't ready. It's okay, no big deal just seat us somewhere else. Which he did immediately.
Host was very pleasant, warm and friendly. 

Sat down had a partial view of the fountain, but didn't feel like we had any privacy. Too close of quarters with the couples next to us.

Server was devoid of any personality, maybe she just was having a bad day. But so was the Sommelier. Looked unhappy to be there.  The guy pouring our water was more outgoing and friendly and had a smile on his face than those 2 ever did.

We took a pass on the apps, since nothing looked too appealing, I had the Mama Egi's ravioli, it was good, sauce was better.  

My partner had the sea bass, thought it was going to be Chilean Sea Bass but when it arrived, it wasn't, and sent it back. It looked like 2 pieces of fried perch on top of a bunch of beans with escarole. I HATE sending food back and tried to avoid it, but ordered the salmon instead, much better choice. 
Not a place I would recommend. Way too overrated.

5370081,2008-09-23,0,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I came to Circo on a whim,  not reading any reviews, just hoping that the Bellagio would do me good. I was pleased overall, the place was pretty fancy with an attentive staff and great food. 

The best part of the meal is the view of the fountains of Bellagio. On most nights they go off every fifteen minutes and are still a spectacle even without the sound. Definitely request a seat with a window view. 

The food and drink also impressed. A couple people in my party ordered a bottle of wine which was served promptly but a little to sweet for me. I got a beer from a wide selection and enjoyed it throughly. 

We asked for a sizeable app to split between two people. Our waitress offered the tomato with buffalo mozzerella and I jumped on that real quick. To me it was below average. The tomato was good but the mozzerella seemed lacking. There was also only dabbs of balsamic vinegar. I like to shower in that shit. 

For my entree I ordered the prosciutto wrapped scallops. This dish was godlike. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the prosciutto was somehow fused to each scallop. It was topped with truffles and a rich sauce that made me stand up and do the robot. I also tried my buddies seabass which, although not as good as my scallops, was pretty darn good. 

We decided to pass on dessert and recieved what I thought was a pretty modest bill for a nice Las Vegas dinner. To me, being able to sit with friends, watch the fountains, drink, and eat delicious food is worth the price of admission.",iOyh9Rq4xcvlBnK5dgQ62g,0,0,4,xeN5mUqKCHl0BLUQKe9MFA
5385764,2011-03-14,6,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"Look, I am a local in Las Vegas so I know that you are going to be paying a premium to eat on the strip, but as far as nickel and diming its customers, Circo takes the cake. 

If you are going to charge that amount for food, it better be something good. There better be fresh ingredients, there should be good service, and there should be a decent ambiance. 

Circo had none of these traits.

First, I never would have gone to this restaurant if it weren't for a group that convinced me to go with them. Before we went into the Circo we decided to have a drink at the bar across the way. I struck up a conversation with the bartender there about living in Las Vegas among other things. The bartender was a nice regular guy with the twang of one of the ""boys"" from the old days. After talking for a while he asked at which restaurant we were eating. I replied ""Circo"" and he laughed and said, ""Hope you brought your checkbook.""....Bad Omen.

THE ATMOSPHERE

We get there and the atmosphere is like children of the corn meets Candyland. It seriously reminded me of the part in ""Fear and Loathing"" where Gonzo had to be pulled off the Circus Circus carousel because he took too much ether.

There are demonic Monkeys on tricycles and clowns hanging from the ceiling. Why anyone would want to eat in a place like this is totally 100% beyond my comprehension. Unless of course they are a serial killer who decided to stop taking his meds.

I understand the whole ""French people like this sort of thing"" thing, so ok, I can get past it. 

Plus the fountains were nice to watch, but I was always hesitant to watch them as I was sure as soon as I turned my back on the tricycle monkey from hell I would get a shank to the back.

Anyway, I digress.

THE FOOD

First of all, the food names on the menu don't actually make any sense. like for instance, if its a Caesar salad, call it a Caesar salad. Dont call it ""Bagna Cauda"" because that's not even what  Bagna Cauda is...

Bagna Cauda is akin to a garlic and anchovy fondue. Hence why it translates to ""Warm Bath""

Bagna Cauda is NOT A CAESAR SALAD. And, by the way, I'm pretty sure they import their Caesar salad from pizza hut because it tastes exactly the same and has the same ingredients....But at least the pizza hut Caesar salad doesn't cost you 18 DOLLARS!

I have to laugh at the other reviewers that posted saying this is ""Authentic Italian""

I digress again. I wanted to stay on the cheap side of things so I just ordered a roasted garden vegetable pizza and got a Peroni to whet the whistle. I figure O.K. you cant really screw this up.

The Peroni comes out first (Peroni is like the Italian Budweiser...Its at the most about 13 bucks for a 12 pack at the corner store.) So i'm thinking for 9 bucks they are going to come out with a Hafbrauhaus style 1 liter stein for me to drink out of...

WRONG...it comes out in apparently a drink-ware made for tiny people from another time period. On the bright side though it made my hand look gigantic in the pictures we took.

The grilled ""garden vegetable"" pizza came out next...Since I knew I was getting bent over anyway for eating at the Bellagio I wasn't expecting too much. At least it met my expectations. The ""Garden Vegetables"" were the typical Eggplant and zucchini that were grilled using the same time honored techniques as used by traditional airline stewardesses. And the crust tasted like Boboli. (I actually like Boboli crust so its not knocking Boboli...but I dont really want to pay 24 bucks for it.)

The girls got some other food that nobody could ever pronounce and they liked it at the time. It seemed fancy and shiny and girls like that sort of thing. But afterward, when they got back to their rooms they were face-down in the toilet from either food poisoning or they had become possessed by the monkey demon king. I'm guessing food poisoning since from my point of view, their fish was actually fresh sometime during the Carter administration.

THE SERVICE

Apparently Circo is way too trendy for ice water... Because they don't give you any. Which is O.K. since when the waiter actually DID come around to pour the warm water he would extend his arm across to reach for the glass, thus revealing the ripe smell of industrial armpits. I had to keep checking him to make sure his shirt wasn't melting onto the table.

The main waiter was probably nice, but I wouldn't actually know that since not even a babelfish could translate what he was saying. At least in the end he tried to stiff us on the check which had a couple charges that we didn't make. 

Now that I think about it, im pretty sure the reason why they use erroneous menu terms is so that they can add it to the end bill and nobody would be the wiser.

All in all I managed to only spend 40 bucks and still look like I wasn't the cheapest man on earth to the present company. Even with my 40 dollar tab, our 6 person table was able to rack up a 480 dollar check only getting half entrees and apps.

Had reservations at 9:15 on a Friday night and we were seated promptly at a table by the kitchen (unfortunately, we were extremely far from the windows for a view of the water show). Let me also say that I really despise circuses...but loved the decor in this restaurant. Five stars for that. 
We requested just normal tap water and the wait staff seemed almost annoyed with this selection. Uh, sorry we're not sorry that we won't spend $9 for bottled water? Give us a break. This lead to infrequent refills of our water-- that's a big negative for me as I am the polar opposite of a camel and drink water like I won't have any again for a week. Okay, enough of that rant...

PLUS: We had some delicious salads. A prosciutto & melon salad and the classic Caprese. Big props for these two!

The bread: Yess, we were fans. One of them tasted like pan pizza crust..the whole table agreed. So good! 

Meals:
--Pappardelle: Wide noodles served with sausage and wild mushrooms. I was looking so forward to this dish, and I think it only fell short in my eyes because of its sauce-- or, rather, its lack thereof. There was NO sauce, just an almost excessive amount of melted butter covering the dish. It was good, but almost a tad bland. My mom and sister enjoyed this dish, though. 

--""Mama Egi's"" ravioli: Either order this as an appetizer, or split this and another dish with someone else at the table. Extremely delicious, but also extremely rich. I couldn't eat more than four or five of these mini raviolis without wanting to stop because it was so rich. 

--Quail. I had never had quail before, and my sister's boyfriend ordered this dish. I only had a bite, but I liked what I tasted. He said it was better than what he was used to. 

Dessert:
We ordered the bombolonis (donuts)-- ooh, sugar-covered goodness. Came with a raspberry sauce and a strong chocolate sauce. 

Overall, Circo wasn't bad. It wasn't bad at all. It had its strong points, but also fell short in some areas.

I regretted to wine pairing option. For $45 it sounded attractive and I was interested in at least a couple of the wines paired so I decided to go for the easy way. Unfortunately the rosé proposed with the pasta was sub-par and the Aglianico proposed with the lamb was substituted by a california cab (which was pretty good, mind you). Maitre d' (or head sommelier) took the time to explain me why the substitution was necessary (alledgedly too many flawed bottles in the case) but when I saw the cab's price I suspected the real reason could be related to non-vinous reasons.

5901133,2010-09-22,1,AMTNJbYbu0OMMAkx4meQxw,"I was in town for a yearly conference; the girl came out to stay with me for part of the week. So a few weeks prior to our visit I purchased tickets to the Cirque O show and reservations for dinner right after. I always follow up an online reservation with a call to confirm and asked for a table in front of a window to view the fountains. The maître said they would reserve an appropriate table. 

I had been in Las Vegas since that Saturday (Conference started 8 am Sunday) and my girl arrived Wednesday, we went to the show and dinner here Thursday night. I estimated based on our seats which were up front and to the left (Avoiding splash) of the theatre that it would take us maybe 30 minutes from our seats to the restaurant's door. I was close, took us about 25 minutes. We arrived five minutes early, checked in and waited to be seated. In no time we were taken to a fantastic table facing the hotel's water fountains. While the restaurant's ambience is that of a European carnival is vibrant in colors, it has a definite romantic yet sophisticated feel. The space between tables gives you privacy, the chairs comfy. 

Our waiter was very welcoming and attentive. He explained the specials. All through the dinner he and his team were on top of things, made sure we were not in need of anything. They switched out or white table linen for black ones, nice!

We browsed the menu. I choose the wines from an extensive and impressive list; I had a Cab Napa for me and an Italian red for my girl. A word of caution is the servings are large for two people. I thought it being European influence, small servings but I was wrong. So when the main courses arrived, it was a lot of food. 

We started with a salad that was very tasty with crisp cherry tomatoes. For the main dishes I went with a veal Milanese (Carne) and a scallop dish for the Pesce. The Milanese was huge, well-seasoned, tender and yummy. Not to oily, the breading was not burnt but nice and crispy. The scallops had great texture and flavoring as well; very tender and buttery. My girl complimented me on the wine selection which made me very happy that I got it right. I don't even remember dessert. 

Overall I will go again at some point but so many places to try next year. The view of the fountain show at night is not to be missed. I did notice that Yelp has categorized this as ""Dressy"" and Zagat called it ""Upscale Casual"". I go with upscale casual. I went in a dark colored suit with a lighter solid colored shirt and no tie; basically business casual. My girl went in a dark tan colored cocktail dress and very sexy heels, she is beautiful. Do not go with lighter solid colors, you will blend in too much with the décor. I also recommend for lunch or dinner with a most favored client while in Las Vegas.",VSwB0IT2PaV_O5ZYI4LPAg,2,1,5,B0yVkMnBefH-yoZCC3wv9Q
