Food was ok, a little pricey but I guess seafood usually is. The portions could've been a little bigger for the price. The music was pretty intense, it was a little too loud for me at least. Still looking for the perfect mariscos spot ,, any recommendations?",CpKSbyB9DsJ1Xe3Ey6s2wA,0,0,3,gQnW7mg8m-YNHNqYnYAQ7A

Most of the items will look familiar to anyone familiar with Tex-Mex. The flavors were authentic and tasty. From the outside, this looks tiny, but inside it is spacious and clean. One thing that's a little confusing is the booths are ornamented with wooden carvings from Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, which is a completely different state than Sinaloa. I had the carne asado but they have a lot of seafood, so I'll have to try that next time. I'm glad it's in new in the neighborhood.",soG9o5PqmXilKJHpAB777A,1,0,4,Hmt39xe0W-GT1XZWgUSbNA
