Been a fan of palace stations oyster bar n am super shocked that its been really popular the past few years. I dont wanna wait over an hr for the oyster bar anymore n make the trip to the strip as often as i'd like so i was super excited to hear that santa fe station, which is like literally down the street from my house, is opening up an oyster bar. Ive been to al's oyster bar at orleans, n the oyster bar at harrahs and lemme tell u, its all about palace stations' AND santa fes'!!!!! Becoz santa fes oyster bar uses the same recipe as palace stations its pretty damn close and good.  to boot they hav more room, you get to pick ur oysters *best part*, they hav a few more options on the menu and dessert!! Woohoo!! 

Had my usual for comparison reasons combo pan roast, NE clam chowder, 1/2 dz KUMAMOTO oysters. (u dont get an option at palace station) lemme tell u evrything was AWESUM SAUCE!!! 

Price is the same, no sourdough bread but a garlic toast style texas toast thingy, but they do hav sourdough bread bowls for the soups so im not to butt hurt about them not having the complimentary sourdough bread. Met the Executive chef and the kitchen chef. The staff was great, im def coming back. Nuff said. Njoy!!",RIroUg2XJyrqzfc-waGZcA,3,0,5,JUuZVDd9d74nW38Qx7yTsA

Service was incredibly poor. However, I would like to point out that the poor service was in no way the fault of the poor girl. I watched her bus tables, take orders, make drinks, deliver food and have to talk to angry people in line. That's way too much for one person to do (mind you there were 3 servers but still get a busser or a host). The restaurant is poorly planned and poorly executed. 

I had the House Gumbo but it was way too salty. My husband had the Fra Diablo and it wasn't even that spicy. The lobster felt rubbery and overcooked in both of our meals. It was just gross and the restaurant was awful.

Used to going to palace stations oyster bar, long wait usually but worth it. Does santa fe compare?   It's close and if you live on that side of town like I do is worth checking out. 

First off,  don't let the prices stop you from coming here.  The portion sizes were more than worth it for me.   

Tried the chicken gumbo,  linguini and clams, mac and cheese, and seafood jambalaya.  Mac and cheese was oh so good. A place that the food comes out hot!

I'm spoiled on good jumbalaya so theirs was respectable.  Nothing like mom's cooking to compare to. ..

Gumbo is my favorite and theirs didn't disappoint.  Good amount of the right spices (level 4!) A tad too much salt for me made drinking those moscow mules even easier.

Linguini and clams, according to my guest, was yummy and worth ordering again.

The fish and chips,  while I didn't order but someone next to me did,  was impressive looking and for how they cleaned the plate must have been good. 

Our server was good and will give the respect that I think the team is new and it just opened and will only get better with each visit.

Lobster Roll was bland.

Dozen oysters were shucked incorrectly, presented on a bowl of ice as if they were an ice sculpture. Poor taste, ultra sandy and gritty.

The atmosphere of the restaurant has a modern casual feel, with great decor. The staff was very upbeat, friendly, and personable. Overall a great experience and atmosphere. 

Now let's get to the good stuff... The food! 

We ordered a half dozen of oysters to start off with. The great thing, is that you get to pick from their list of oysters, and choose which ones you would like to order. The cost doesn't change, and it's nice to have a variety to try from. We also ordered a bowl of the New England clam chowder. All I can say is that it is heaven. I just wish they had the option to serve it in a bread bowl. However, they give you garlic bread (free of charge) when you sit down. The garlic bread was on point. 

For dinner we ordered the fish and chips, and the lobster, crab, shrimp pan roast. The fish and chips were one of a kind. I have never ate fish and chips that were deep fried whole (of course the skin was taken off and the head of the fish, but they kept the tail on.) The batter was not heavy, and perfectly fried. The fish was very moist and flavorful. The pan roast was epic. It was so flavorful, creamy, and absolutely delicious. 

I would definitely recommend this new spot to everyone! A must try for locals!",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,5,1,5,TYfN92Y5MD0oeFDlGtGgZw

1196812,2017-01-18,0,vjFZt8Rt3A3kY7yWh3qmgg,"My wife and I live in Vegas, and often eat out at local establishments. We live only a few miles from Santa Fe Station, and wanted to try the ""oyster bar,"" which is one of the Resturants in the casino. Touted as a resturant favorite is their fish and chips, so, that is what we tried. The dish looked great' however, what destroyed this meal was the service-it was the worst I've encountered in Las Vegas in 6 years. To begin, the resturant was not busy, there were a total of 10 patrons present, and they were attended by 3-waitresses, 1-bus, 1-prep, and 1-cook. In other words more than adequate for the load. We ate at the counter as tables are few in number, and the counter is typically faster. We planned to see a movie after dinner. Our meals were prepared quickly, looked great, and immediately went under a heat lamp on the counter. Then, they sat there, and sat there, and sat there for 12 minutes under the heat lamp--our waitress was nowhere to be seen. I asked a waitress standing 2 feet in front of us, sacking bread to give to patrons, if she would ""please be so kind as to hand us our meals,"" which we're sitting 4 feet behind her. She looked at me like I'd asked her to loan me money and walked away without answering. Another waitress walked by, and I asked the same thing--by now,  our meals were being pushed down the line under the heat lamp as other meals took priority position. We are now at 15 minutes under the heat lamp. The second waitress said, ""just a minute, your waitress will be here shortly."" Damn it, I don't want to wait 15 minutes for my meal, when it's been ready all this time, and has been warming for a quarter of an hour. How hard is it to ask a coworker to help you and your customer out by handing them their meals while you do whatever you are doing? Not hard at all. What the heck? Are we invisible? FINALLY, at 16 minutes our waitress reappears, and begins slowly placing her apron, talking to people and colleagues-put now I am pissed, so I begin waving my arms and pointing to our now lukewarm fish and chips sitting under the heat lamp. Noticeably irritated, she walked up and announced, ""I'm sorry you had to wait, but I had to use the toilet."" You know, I don't care where you were, especially if you were at the toilet, but I do care about my $19.95 fish and chips dinner that is now at best, warm. With disgust she delivers the meals and then makes it a point not to attend to us for the rest of the meal. I did not eat my meal--it was only warm, and fish and chips is supposed to be served piping hot, not heat lamp warm, plus, I hate arrogant, ignorant wait staff. We will never go back, and, we will make sure all our friends know that the service here is really bad, and if you dare to question how you are treated, you won't be treated at all. Resturants come and go in this town, and wait staff and food quality are the primary reasons for failures. I cannot recommend this resturant to anyone given our experience. A total downer, ruined our evening, wasted $40 in food, plus cost of a beer and a glass of wine. It isn't hard to do it right-it really isn't, but when you employ people who could care less about customer service-this is what you get.",mtGwkN52EPd6vGwq9JBBCg,0,0,1,Ta0n9P7criagevqmqT_2Xg

I think it is absolutely ridiculous to have such a small establishment and know that you will have plenty of people lined up to eat seafood but you don't have enough seats to go around. As of this moment, I am giving this place a 2 star rating until I sit and taste the food.

So, I guess an update is in order.

We FINALLY got seated and we ordered our meals. I had the fish and chips and the missus had the house gumbo. She really enjoyed it and I thought it was pretty good. My meal was good: fish was flaky and very well battered. Chips were decent as well.

Overall, I give this joint 4 stars. I'm adding 2 to the 2 already given. But take my advice: expand the seating when you expand the kitchen. 

UPDATE: Wife and I went again this past Friday (5/27/16) and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We had the Fish N' Chips and the Lump Crab Ceasar Salad. Best meal we've had outside of our own cooking.

1532813,2016-03-11,0,vjFZt8Rt3A3kY7yWh3qmgg,"My first experience with pan roast was at the original Oyster Bar at Palace Station. It was truly a once-in-a-while treat until (so I've heard) some of the original people there branched off and opened up some spots in SoCal: Ritter's and Kettlebar. Now, I didn't get to review any of those places as I'll kinda tell you that... well, they all kinda taste the same to me.

But maybe it's because they're all from the same school of pan roast. In any case, this newly opened branch of the Station Casinos' Oyster Bar chain is on par with its pan roast peers.

It did stand out in that it made for a memorable experience for myself and my family. They were one or two people down and it was pretty obvious cause they were juggling serving people and finished tables were waiting to be cleaned. But through smiles and solid customer service, the staff as a whole were able to make it work til close. And even the line banded together to help assist the server in working out where each party would sit.

Highlights were, of course, the combo pan roast. It's a savory dish that's meant to be shared, lest you want to drive home with food coma. (No one wants that.) Honestly, my fams and I got that. My fiancée and I got the level 6 spice for ours but it wasn't that spicy. Step it up if you want that kick. My dad found the clam chowder to one of the best he's ever had, and he's pretty hard to please. Trust. 

On seating... there's way more than the one at Palace Station. But there's still not a ton. In any case, it may seem like that line ain't movin... but trust, you'll get there. You'll get your pan roast.",uzKgxSipSeRHvMxC1Z4r9A,4,0,4,qYHjdYuRWOl_SUQAEk-qMQ

We had to ask Kory to refill our drinks and it took us like 3 or 4 times to get her attention she would not paying any attention we had to like kind of like I had her down to actually get her to see it and we're sitting at the bar to get her to fill our drinks when we got ready to go we needed to go bags she says oh I have other orders in front of you so just wait a minute when she bagged up our food she threw our bread away which is really good she threw the bread away I didn't have any bread to eat when I brought my food home. That's pretty much it luckily I love food so the experience was horrible but you know I'll give it another try because I do love the food there but Corey I hope you read this and really take note on your attitude,7ADmRX6zx3p5H_osgsG-Gg,0,0,3,3gWB_1Ve-qdvFE-uQ5EyyA

The reason i came to this location was because there was a line that was about 15 people long at Palace station which could take up to 2 hours, trust me i've waited before.  So i figure I'd drive for about 20 minutes and save myself some time, so glad i did.

When i got there noticed that they are not open 24/7 like at Palace Station, they open for dinner at 5.  When i got there there was no line, there were open seats at the counter and better still there were tables, not just the counter like at Palace Station.  Also because its not in the middle of the casino, but its own separate restaurant, kids or people under the age of 21 can eat here!  Just some of the reasons is better than Palace Station which is infamous for their long wait times.  Its also very modern design to it.

Service was very friendly and cheery, i got the combination gumbo with crab and shrimp only (omitted the lobster, its only small bits and pieces rolled out of the legs), spice level 4 was perfect, had a good amount of heat but still able to taste the flavor of the gumbo.  It was not as good as i remember at Palace Station, but then again i omitted stuff and the other time was my first time, but still Very VERY good.  It came with a nice slice of toasted buttery bread and a scoop of rice.  So good but I must be getting older because i couldn't finish the whole thing.  So I had a wonderful breakfast the next morning!

Oyster bar, Santa Fe Station Vs. Palace Station

Santa Fe Station
Pros
- No (or shorter) lines during heavy hours
- More seats including tables
- More modern
- Not in the middle of the casino (under 21 can eat here)

Cons
- Further from the strip
- Not open 24/7
- Don't have the Étouffée that the other Oyster Bars offer
- There is not an individual steam pot in front of each seat, (for show) but its still made individually in its own pot in the cooks work station, its just more efficient for the guy to make them all in one place than to move from station to station. (so its a pro for efficiency and a con for showmanship)

Despite not having the Étouffée, I'll be coming here from now on rather than Palace Station.  Or maybe i'll try Texas Station which is a few $ cheaper, but i really like this casino and the modern feel of this Oyster bar.",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,2,2,5,PRD_IOd0O9K_oGB7ORNDrQ

I had the clam chowder and it was delicious. The only reason they lost a star was for seating. There are only three tables and the rest is at the bar. I know it's an oyster bar so that's kind of the idea, but you wait in this weird queue rather than putting your name in. You have no access to drinks from this establishment while waiting, so if there is a line and you want a beverage hit up a casino bar on your way. Plus once we were seated I felt kind of guilty hanging out while I could clearly see all the people waiting empty handed probably willing me to stop talking and finish my wine.

Having tried steam kettle cooked restaurants around southern california, we were excited and curious how it would be.

We were somewhat pleased. Our server gal was great. Executive chef even came out to our table at some point to ask how everything was. 

We ordered half dozen special oysters, shrimp pan roast level 7 and kitchen sink pan roast level 3. Bread that comes out was tasty with hints of garlic butter. The oysters were fresh shucked and DELICIOUS!!!! We regretted ordering more but as soon as our food came out...all regret was gone. The bowls were enormous! They were tasty and full of meat and seafood. Having tried other similar places, we were just as pleased however, veggies (or the trinity) could be diced a bit smaller. 

Weird thing that happened though.

This place only holds around 20 people (4 tables that can seat 2 and the remaining at the bar).  I asked why limited seating.  Hostess stated that it's an Oyster Bar!  REALLY!  The Orleans and Texas Station both have Oyster Bars and with plenty of room to seat many patrons.  Ordered the Fish & Chips for  $19.99.  We got 2 pieces of fish with fries.  The lady next to us received 3 pieces of fish.  Where's the consistency!!!  The fish was bland and the fries were the best part of the meal.  I've had better fish elsewhere.

We ended up saying screw it and left. We went to the Mexican restaurant afterwards and the people ahead of us had the same exact issue right before us.They have more than enough room to add more tables, i'm not sure why they don't. The person who arranged the seating should be fired for the amount of business they have lost/are losing.

Firstly, from the beginning, we waited in line to be seated, and the restaurant was slow for a Friday night. It took them a few minutes to seat us, I noticed that the waitress was busy socializing with her coworker instead of noticing customers waiting in line to be seated with plenty of open tables.

Secondly, after ordering our food, it took them about 45 minutes for it to come out, and once it was done, it wasn't brought right away because the waitress was still socializing with her coworkers as well as the chefs. After she served the food to us, less then one bite into the linguine with clams, it tasted so sour that we couldn't eat it. And instead of the server coming to ask us if everything is okay, she didn't acknowledge that the dish wasn't even touched. Obviously something is wrong when you don't see someone eating their food.

Waiting in line,  I see other parties receive the fish and chips and see that it's NO LONGER THE TAIL-ON LOUP DE MER that they used to serve...not good. Probably a cheaper substitute with no tail.

Sitting up at the bar perusing the menu, not only have prices gone up, but the Lobster Roll is no longer on the menu. We flag down a waitress to inquire about the fate of the Lobster Roll and she confirms that it had been removed even though it was a good seller and her personal favorite!? Why??? ""CORPORATE"" she answered...Figures.

The ""higher ups"" want to keep costs down and quality up using cheaper ingredients and upping the price in the process. Disappointed that one of the few delicious things on the menu were no more.

I had studied the menu before going and knew that I wanted to get the combo pan roast--a combination of shrimp, lobster, and crab in a tomato based stock.  This was the first time I was ever asked how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1 to 10.  I went with 8 but I'll go higher next time although 8 is good spice.  There were a few beads of perspiration on my forehead as I finished but I'm sure it was because I was dressed warmly.  

While I waited for the roast, the server brought me iced tea and some bread to munch on.  The iced tea was refilled several times and she brought a glass of ice so I could replenish what melted.

There was a good amount of lobster and shrimp.  The crab is more in shreds than pieces.  The flavor of the broth was excellent and I really liked choosing a spice level.  The portion size is very large!  You need no more than one scoop of rice in the roast to make the dish completely filling.  I didn't eat all the bread and I'm glad I didn't.  I was full when I finished the pan roast.  I think I'll see if I can get a 1/2 portion when I visit again.

I came here for dinner with my partner in dine.

They're in Santa Fe Station, up around the Northwest,
We dined here for dinner for our Pan Roast taste test. 

Let's start with the service, specifically the wait,
40 minutes, not bad. Not gonna hate.

I was a little annoyed since tables needed bussing,
The food was fabulous. So, I ain't fussing.

I had the oysters and we shared the rest,
When it comes to Pan Roast, OB's the best.

The chowder was thick, tasty, and hearty,
The oysters were huge and can feed a party.

Back to the highlight and I'll keep it real,
At $22.99, the Pan Roast's a steal. 

Tons of bisque, lobster, crab, and shrimp,
Just like Palace Station, this one doesn't skimp. 

Our cook remembered us and his name is Al,
He asked our opinion. My response was WOW!

I told him that their Pan Roast was awesome and the rest was good,
What's even better? You're in my hood. 

Peace!!!


TIP #1:  Get extra rice if you want your Pan Roast thicker.

TIP #2:  They don't charge extra for sharing.

TIP #3:  Come hungry. 

NOTES:
-40 minute wait on a Friday night.

The waitress (wearing too tight pants that allowed her stomach roll to hang out under her too short shirt-not appealing in a restaurant) greeted us right away and took our drink order, an iced tea and a water. The bf ordered jambalaya and I, the clam chowder bread bowl. Maybe 15 minutes later the jambalaya came. I ate some of the bf's food while waiting for my chowder. It was good (not great-not enough seafood and too many green things (celery?) in it) but the bowl was plenty huge for two people to share. The waitress came and refilled my bf's iced tea but ignored my empty water glass until he asked her to refill it. She never mentioned what the holdup on my clam chowder was. Ten minutes after that she brought us the bill and charged us for the clam chowder EVEN THOUGH SHE NEVER BROUGHT IT! I'd, maybe, understand if we were a larger party and ordered a lot of food, but there were only two of us and we only ordered two things! How could she not notice there was no food sitting in front of me the entire time? I handed her back the bill and told her her mistake and she gave a short apology but never offered to bring the chowder, or any other sort of amends.

After we received our drinks and put in our order, every thing was great. Our server was super friendly and attentive. We got oyster shooters to start out with which are so savory they could be a meal in itself. The shooters were followed by gold band oysters, straight from Louisiana. These oysters are so big and juicy, even a dozen looks intimidating. We got shrimp cocktail and lump crab cocktail which are the perfect appetizers. We accompanied it with the Father's Day special crab boil which came with the BEST andouille sausage. For the piece de resistance.. we got my favorite thing on the planet...  combo PAN ROAST.

The pan roast is made to order so it takes a minute to make, or at least to make it well.

I have to admit that although their original location at the palace station has a little better taste, this location is still pretty good minus the hour wait to get a table. The atmosphere and decore is pretty modern and pleasant. We had the opportunity to try different dishes at this restaurant and my ultimate favorite is the pan roast combo. If you have never been there, you must try this dish.

My go to is the pan roast. Honestly I don't care about any other dish here. When ordering you have the choice of rice or pasta. For this particular kind of dish, my preference is rice, though the rice has been slightly undercooked on each visit. My friend changed it up on this last visit and got the jambalaya and a variety of oysters which were all tasty but I'm sticking with my pan roast! :) The servings are for sharing, but if you decide not to and can't finish it, it still tastes yummy the next day.

Once you order the wait for the food can take a while so I wouldn't recommend visiting when you're borderline hangry.",ufOZcCPOu_qky0aDeeKmlw,2,0,4,YOOWLjgrCJbofgnwXQ-r-g
4702418,2016-06-14,2,vjFZt8Rt3A3kY7yWh3qmgg,"Kitchen Sink Pan Roast ($21.99): Shrimp, crab, chicken, and Andouille sausage. The same combination as the Palace Pan Roast at Palace Station. I prefer the pan roast at Palace Station to this one, but it's still very tasty.

Chicken Gumbo ($16.99): Creole stew with Andouille sausage, okra, and chicken. A thick, rich stew served similarly to the pan roasts. It's a decent dish, but not nearly as good as the pan roasts! However, it is a good non-seafood option.

Fish and Chips ($19.99): Tail-on Loup De Mer (Mediterranean Seabass), salt and vinegar chips, lemon dill tartar, and creole remoulade. One of my favorite fish with a fantastic crispy breading. The whole fish is split in half and easy to eat. Delicious chips (fries) as well.

New England Lobster Roll ($19.99): Lobster salad in New England-style bun; served with fries. The lobster salad is delicious and packed with lobster meat. Again, really great fries. These are different than the ones served with the 'Fish and Chips' as these fries have Cajun seasoning.

Alaskan Clam Chowder ($24.99): New England-style with shrimp, crab, and lobster. Amazing chowder! This one is loaded with all your favorite sea creatures and fresh clams as well. Fantastic flavor and consistency.

Monkey Bread Pudding ($5): Monkey Bread, creamy egg custard, and warm bourbon sauce. This combines two already great treats - monkey bread and bread pudding. So scrumptious and the bourbon sauce is a wonderful touch. 

Hurricane ($9): Bacardi Light, Meyers' Dark Rum, passion fruit, fresh lime, and orange juice. A tasty, fruity slush that will make you feel like you're in the tropics.

Amazing, amazing service and it's not as busy as the Palace Station location; normally no wait time. The only instance I did wait was with a party of 6 and it was just 15 minutes. Although I love the pan roast at PS, the additional menu items offered here are great, especially the Fish and Chips and the New England Lobster Roll.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,9,4,4,VsRKYD0IGcIAFXDbI3cgiA

Brian had the fish and chips and it was really great. I ordered Shrimp Scampi, which I always got at Sunset. Not even close, I was so disappointed. The shrimp was delicious, but it was no scampi sauce. It was just chicken soup, without the chicken taste and they just dumped the oregano on it. Not good at all, I was super disappointed. I have read the previous reviews and saw that most got the Pan Roast, which is great at Sunset, too, so next time I will order that. The waitress did give our order to another customer and did not acknowledge that she had done it (although we saw it), but chef and waitress alike apologized for our long wait for the food.

We ordered the lobster roll and combo pan roast for our mains.  Lobster roll came with super crunchy fries that were yummy.  Lobster roll was good, large pieces and not too much mayo.

Pan roast was amazing, rich full of crab, lobster and shrimp.  Heat level was four, and that seemed good just enough heat with out blowing out the other flavors. Plenty of left overs and looking forward to those today.

We went last night, super excited. We LOVE oyster bars. And this one is super close to us. :)

The service was great. We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. Prep yourself for this. This is not a good place for groups as it is very small with limited seating. A group of 5 in front of us waited for about 30-45 minutes. 

We were seated at the bar. The waitress was quick to help and very attentive the entire time. 

We had:

Clam Chowder - this was super good. But it's really, REALLY thick. I dug it, but I was too full. It's good for sharing even just a cup so you save room if you order other stuff. 
Lobster roll - yes. It is SO hard to find a good lobster roll around town. This was packed full of lobster and not caked in mayonnaise. The bread they use is super good too. Light and crispy. 
Combo Pan Roast - I can't tell you how much I loved this stuff. Another really hard thing to find in Las Vegas. It was perfect! I even LOVE that they use real rice and not the precooked shit that a lot of places use. 

Only downside are the hours. They're not open for a great amount of time. Maybe it'll change...

They have the cheap prices....$1.99 eggs/browns/toast, $1.99 short stacks, $5.99 steak and eggs, etc etc.

But do they have the taste?  A lot of these graveyard specials are only good if you are plastered or don't know any better. 

Glad to say that it is worth the money and then some!  LOL...you would hope it would be worth the $2, but we have all been there before where food hasn't even lived up to those short expectations...

Not only are the portions fair, esp considering the prices, but the flavor is there and everything is fresh.  

Service was decent...ran dry on the drinks once or twice, but I am sure they run a thin crew midnight+.  When I requested the refill, it was there asap.

Overall, if you are looking for cheap eats, this blows away anything you are going to eat for 2-3x the price.

Our waitress was very attentive and polite. She took our order right away and brought back 2 sourdough rolls with butter. We didn't receive any bread plates, nonetheless we just ate the bread over our napkins. I noticed the pan roast I used to order changed. It used to have crab, shrimp, and lobster. Now it also includes chicken (mostly) and andouille sausage. The basic makeup of the dish changed too. Gone is the silky cream tomato base, instead it's more of a concentrated broth now. I even watched the 1 cook prepare it by taking scoops out of what looked like a big metal tub stored in the fridge. When eating the pan roast I noticed a gelatinous mass in my mouth. It was like eating chicken noodle soup from a can that wasn't diluted with water. My daughter ordered the clam chowder and it was just ok, nothing special and not particularly fresh. The meal with 2 drinks cost $40 plus tip. Not really worth it in my opinion. 

It's almost as if they understaff the place on purpose. It was very slow getting our food  when we were the 2nd table that ordered. There was one chef and one (hot) guy shucking oysters.

5620667,2016-03-03,3,vjFZt8Rt3A3kY7yWh3qmgg,"I never knew what pan roast was until I saw a Yelp Talk thread about it a few years back.  Pan roast is not roast beef nor is it any type of meat roasted in a pan, which I assumed it was by the name.  No, pan roast is actually a tomato-based soup/stew with either crab, shrimp, lobster or all three in combination.  The pan roast at the Palace Station Oyster Bar also has a secret ingredient that makes otherwise sensible folks wait in long lines just to get some.  The b/f and I have waited in said lines for our fix and talked to out-of-towners who specifically stay at the Palace Station so they can get pan roast around the clock while they visit.  We haven't had pan roast in a while because no one has time to wait in line these days, but then Santa Fe Station opened their own Oyster Bar, which is much closer to us than Palace Station. 
 
Throwing caution to the wind, we ventured over on Friday night around 6:40pm and the line didn't look too awful compared to what we've experienced at Palace Station's bar.  Timing our wait, we were seated in about 40 minutes at the bar and we considered that a win.  This Oyster Bar also has a few tables, thus more seating room, but I usually prefer sitting at the bar at most places for the view of the action behind it.  We got to watch the huge oysters being shucked by one of the staff the whole time we were there and it sure looked like a workout!  
This time the b/f and I shared the combo pan roast with shrimp, lobster, and crab since we decided that our past forays to the Oyster Bar where we each got a bowl was too much and bulking season has to end sometime. Plus we also shared a bowl of clam chowder, Mel had oysters, and I had a Moscow Mule, so maybe the bulk isn't over.  Anyway, the pan roast was just as good as Palace's to me with even more lobster, crab, and shrimp.  The clam chowder came after the pan roast because our waitress forgot we ordered it, but she was very apologetic and comped it because of the oversight; the chowder was great, too.  The only disappointment was the bread they serve since they're basically toasted hot dog buns, not bread rolls.

I ordered a 7 out of 10 on the spicy level but it didn't have any heat at all!  I've ordered a 5 at the other places and they were pretty spicy...The pan roast wasn't all that creamy and the taste was so so!  They need to work on giving a quality pan roast for the price they charge you.  Palace Station is #1 even with the hour long wait!",24-3ri7FV2rB22C9AhTwNA,0,0,3,udP4xoADzD31TZY595hD5w

We had the French Kiss oysters, clam steamers, NE clam chowder, shrimp pan roast, and linguine and clams. Our waitress, Corey, was awesome as well. Will definitely come back!",BAz-SCwkySBlQoTW5giPDA,0,0,5,Wmiur5F6eknaatISnoz9ug

The fish was dry and rubbery, very bland.   The fries had a good seasoning and were very good.   I will go back but not for the fish.   Everything else looked and smelled amazing so we will go for that.   It is very clean, an unexpected location very close to our home.",oUCaxUBcruhxU4XhCF523w,0,0,4,etI3LF10ZbptSa-9xMf9vQ
