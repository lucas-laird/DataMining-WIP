The bread was stale and very obviously not fresh. I asked for bell peppers and jalape√±os and barely got any of either. They both felt as if they had been out for a while. Obviously the fridge was not cooling enough. 

Wish I could get my money back. Would NOT visit again.",eGYQDcMat1p2aIOzNrTKEg,2,0,2,1Y4alPWAI3sFouUBtCU7TQ

I'm more of a cold cut/black forest ham fella. Plus I've been trying to cut down on how much money/calories I use/consume on lunch, so it's a win win situation for me. 

I been to this place more than a few times always on lunch break. The staff is really cool and always greet with smiles. Lately I'm hooked on the cold cut combo with 9 grain honey wheat bread. Add on all the fixings and I'm set. 

Goes well with jalapeno kettle chips and water.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,0,0,4,TxoyeUUu6dVITDEfmAjFRQ

I could understand why the sub artist was upset because she was the only one there but for taking it out on her customer's is terrible, we tried to be patient with her but she was a total *bleep*, never again.

Probably the worst customer service I have ever had. I came in on a Saturday a few weeks ago around lunchtime. There were two people working at the time, with about 3 people ahead of us in line. The girl working seemed stressed and overwhelmed with her orders while the guy just stood watching her, offering input every now and again, but mostly was just being obnoxious and cursing for no apparent reason.  
As the line moved painfully slow, we tried to keep patient as we watched the man working offer no assistance to the stressed woman. When it was our turn the man decided to stand over the woman and give her direction. It was at this point when I realized the girl must've been training. We ordered double meat on one of the meatballs and the man told her ""just dump them all in the middle"" and then when she did he began laughing hysterically. This man was directing this poor girl the wrong way on purpose for a joke that involved my f***ing lunch. I could not believe this was happening. After he was done laughing he told her the correct way to do it all while butchering my sandwich. 
We were the only customers in the shop at the time. As he continued making jokes and flirting with the girl another customer walked in. He stopped making his jokes and started washing his hands. When he finished, he started banging the paper towel dispenser as loud as he could getting the paper towels out and then proceeded to wash his hands again and repeating the banging process.
This guy could not have been more obnoxious with everything he did. I couldn't believe the lack of professionalism. I get it, you make sandwiches for a living making minimum wage, but that doesn't mean you have to be a complete ass****.  When we were finally almost out, we noticed the bill was too high. She had overcharged us.. UHG... 
I couldn't get out of this place fast enough. If I wasn't in such a hurry I would've confronted him. If I ever go back there it will only be to see if that idiot is working so I could file a formal complaint.",92xcpBCgZ3WCZggvmf4omg,0,0,1,5lm2NWwTyGGjfE-5O-Rr9w

I get that its not the best areas, but she was yelling at the top of her lungs ""WATER"". Not only did i get a sandwich, i got a headache too.

3004153,2017-04-25,0,Lb9rNNCbF6gL5EM6znWJUA,"Do not go there. There's a short and stout woman there who tried to cheat me, charged my 6 inch sub for the footlong price and when I confronted her about it she knew she got caught, started yelling at me then walked to the back. If anything, go to the subway on Nellis next to the taco bell and autozone; and let this one die. (Also very stingy with their sandwiches)

Update 
Open 24 hrs except when they're too lazy and tired to work like the graveyard shift, wife went over to get a sandwich, was told that they were closed. If this subway shop dies, we'll all be better off.",lA2DymUTdnokwOreYQpsBw,1,0,1,2SK35lxSwq__2iSgpzQoGw
