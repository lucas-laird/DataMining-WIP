The pizza was not bad enough to send back, but bad enough to not finish. What I had today on a Saturday morning was a poseur of a slice. Yeah, it's thin and crispy enough to fold in half. No, it doesn't taste like a serious pizza chef made it. Couldn't tell who the chef was, but the only guy behind the counter was a young Hispanic guy. It tasted about as good as you'd expect if you went in thinking you'd get a thirty+ year veteran chef and got a young Hispanic guy instead.

Either today was a serious off day, or the five star reviews you're seeing on this page were meant to be written for the Verrazano on Sunset. I'm considering my five bucks a donation to a local business rather than money paid for a meal.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,2,ViBP5aP2RV6lfYTpgBXyxA

Now review on this NEW and Improved Verrazanos WOW! Thank you Ryan for taking over this place, the pizza from old owners here was terrible, I live right around the corner and I would have to travel 5 miles to get decent pizza with this NEW owner that took over (RYAN) , guys let me tell you this, from living in NYC all my life, and tasting the best pizza, this place is for sure hands down best pizza I ever tasted living here in Vegas, I also have buddy's that lived in NY, and Chicago they told me about the great tasting pizza they have here and they are RIGHT! Everything here is made from scratch, no frozen stuff in here, the tomato sauce Home made and man can you taste the different. The owner Ryan is a great guy, Ryan is not New to making pizzas, being a New Yorker him self Ryan food is excellent he takes pride in what he does, and guys it shows, it really does.

Now that I found a great pizzeria here in Vegas, can I now find one of those Mom and pop pastry shops they have in NY, man I miss them",4nApjmB4nWhlwusLQrxELg,1,0,5,OqInLIg6-pCpp9G3vVDu6w

The last 3 times I got a pizza there, I had to wait at least 15 minutes after the time they told me my pizza would be ready. Tonight, I was told my pizza would be ready in 35 minutes. I arrived 40 minutes later and the pizza cook told me that mine would be the next one he puts in the oven and it would be another 20 minutes.  He said that he got a lot of orders all at once and mine was the last one. If he knew that, he should have told me it would be an hour from the start. I would have waited, and been less irritated. I don't blame it on the cook, but rather on the management. They should know that they need adequate staffing to handle the volume of business that they get. Especially on a Sunday night during football season! I love the pizza, but this is probably the last time that I will be back.

Why, why, why would you ruin a good thing and change the quality of a great pizza.",ZtSzW0n2gSqWRAmQ_stkXQ,2,0,1,Pm427d8eWaOQXHzkHPCdzg

  I'll take Verrazano over the Subway. Verrazano is a New York pizzaria and sub restaurant named after the World famous suspension bridge connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island. It is a slice of the Big Apple in Bright Light City. It is not their New York pizza but their delicious New York style eggplant parmesan sub that has kept me returning. 

  This Verrazano is located at the southwest corner of Eastern and Windmill in the Smith's-anchored shopping center. As soon as you step inside the small restaurant, you leave Las Vegas for a mom and pop pizza shop. The white walls are covered with pictures of New York City memorbelia. The red booths resemble the New York pizzaria. The scent of baking pizza permeates the small restaurant. The owner, an older man with a grey mustache reminds me of a New York pizzaria owner east of the Hudson River. 

  I have been a regular the past couple of months. The first time I dined here was on a Saturday evening after work.  I made the trip for the eggplant parmesan sub. At the time, they were out of it. So, I went for two slices of New York style pizza with mushrooms. The pizza was good and could give some New York pizzarias a run for the money. The owner was personable referring to me and his customers as ""friend."" He only charged me for the lunch special. A week later, I made another attempt to try their eggplant parmesan sub. They were not out. This is the equivalent of a New York eggplant parmesan sub with thick slices of egg plant, mouth watering melted parmesan cheese, and toasted bread. It was so delicious that I'd return a few more times. When the owner was here he'd greet me by saying, ""hello friend."" He'd only charge 50 cents for the fountain Pepsi. Usually the hero took ten minutes, which was well worth it. I'd entertain myself looking up at the overhead TV which played anything from basketball to Cops or looked down at the free Las Vegas newspapers or my phone. The baking that took place in the kitchen put a nice potpourri throughout the room. The last time I returned here, the same owner that called me friend on past visits, didn't greet me or talk to me. When I walked in somebody else took my order and when I handed my Pepsi cup to the owner for a top off, he didn't say anything to me. And this time, I overheard him telling a customer that they ran out of pizza slices. At any rate, I don't visit Verrazano for commaderie.  I make the trip here for one of the dearest foods in my life: the eggplant parmesan sub. 

  I am a fan of the delicious eggplant parmesan sub. Disparate from Subway and Port of Subs where they seem to be in almost every major shopping mall, there are currently few restaurants in Las Vegas that serve eggplant parmesan subs. How many New York pizzarias are there in Vegas? There are only a percentage of this small number that serve eggplant parmesan subs. On account of the fact that  Verrazano is one of the few restaurants serving eggplant parmesan subs, someday I plan to return for more.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,6,4,TPizheJJoxdkFryTfC_FJA

I'm not sure if they had changed owners or what going on but the last two times I've ordered I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery.  First time (10/31)  it took them an hour 35 and with no apology and I was stuck with $80 of cold soggy pizza.  The second (and last time which was today, 11/22) I was quoted 40 minutes and 1 hour 55 minutes later our food was delivered.  The pizza was cold and soggy, the wings undercooked and the ranch was warm and spoiled.  When the driver finally showed, without an apology he stated they were running behind.

Went in today at 10.30 (they close at 11), their floors were being cleaned and they asked us to stay on one side, we were the only people in there except for one lady with a take out order. 
We ordered two slices with a limited English speaking person and were told $4 by some other guy. No hello, no, are you eating in, no anything else... we added and drink and asked for ranch too late as they had already swiped our card. They asked us to include .60 cents on the tip line when signing. 
Very rude, gives no shits attitudes. They heated our slices ($5.00 total BTW) and packed in a too go 'box'. We pulled them out and ate at a table. They turned off wheel of fortune on the TV and just kind on stared at us until we finished and left by 10.45. 
Rude. 
They only get 1 stars because of the memories. Pizzas not fabulous. Service is horrible.",GzVw835mGhDdM6ziQNF5EA,1,0,1,dlsuqYu2mN49tvrZU9iXlA
5066880,2014-12-17,3,6Na0jTJjX5GQY_ZJ53G02A,Ahhhhhhhh Verrazanos! I've neglected you for so long! I was born and raised in Vegas and can Tell you I've been coming here since I was a little kid and yes this place has legit NY style pizza. It's the same as years ago when my mom would come pick up wings and pizza for us. The pizza is perfectly sauces and they're not stingy with the cheese but it's all about the crust. I recommend letting it cool down for a few minutes. I like the crust between crispy and soft. If you eat it too quick you can't full enjoy every component. Slap some oregano and chili flakes on it and you're in pizza heaven. Don't forget to order ranch for your wings I don't know what they out in it but I imagine they have this stuff in heaven it's like liquid gold. Purely delectable. It's a garlic ranch so don't plan on making out with anyone after you'll be sure to scare all the vampires away so no need to worry about Dracula coming for ya! Wings could use more sauce but my mom can't handle spicy so she likes em that way. I wouldn't order the garlic knots again. Boring reheated bread with slight garlic flavor but they weren't fresh. Stick with the pizza you'll be happy you did.,r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,3,3,4,xUEerHiQik4vAzD0bJaIeg

But thanks to great reviews by my fellow yelper squad I actually remembered last night and so happy I did!

It was one of those nights that I was torn between cooking and ordering out. Since I was getting off late and completely famished I opted for the latter. Called them up and ordered. They asked if I would prefer pick up or delivery. They said 15 minutes for pick up or about 45 for delivery. Normally I am already at home and prefer deliver but since I was leaving work and they are located right down the road I opted for pick up. Remember... I was too famished to cook!

What I ordered... I was so tempted to order this eggplant parm pizza. Sounds so amazing but I decided to go a little more traditional the first go around.  Meatball, mushroom, ricotta and basil. Unfortunately, I was informed they were out of fresh basil but could substitute with dehydrated. No thanks! I have a fresh basil plant so no biggie. Pizza was solid! Meatballs were yummy, good quality mushrooms and ricotta. I really liked the crust. Maybe I am nuts but the crust had a bit of a sourdough vibe that I really dug being the Bay Area brat that I am. It was right up my alley! Also got the cannoli! Two thumbs up!

I will definitely order again... I can't stop imagining the possibility of an eggplant parm pizza! Ooh la la!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,6,3,4,70RKNjrkErTxDTiHde1g7w

I wanted to order a medium pizza because I was ordering wings as well, but they pressured for a large & I wanted to do toppings so the guy cut me off & was saying how I should order a specialty with everything on it.. which I didn't want everything on it.

The pizza is a great, with a thin but chewy crust, and just the right amount of greasy cheesy pepperoni goodness. The wings are awesome also; made with real ingredients and not chock full of stabilizers like the ""big box"" wing places these days (so gross.) Possibly even better than the food is the customer service. The owner (I think? pretty sure. He's always the same guy who takes our order when we come in...) is quiet at first but then he'll cracks some jokes here and there. But, he really cares about details in things. For example, when you order the bucket of wings, he takes the time to cut out a piece of cardboard to put in the bottom of the paper bag for the cups of ranch, so the bag doesn't collapse and make a mess. Maybe it's a tiny thing but it shows how much they care about details like that.",IwzUGunOvSCtm0xfZwFR6g,0,0,5,GJ5vuotSH_hNQ5TBiQEeEQ

I do have to say that their food was pretty sub-par. The sauce was bland and the cheese was almost non existent. The toppings fell off the pizza and it was almost like eating a crusty old piece of bread with bland sauce and toppings. I do not see how this place is considered even to be remotely NY, other than the vast murals of the Twin Towers, this place has a lot of work to do.
