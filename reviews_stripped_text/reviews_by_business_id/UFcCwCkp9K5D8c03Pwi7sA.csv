457207,2017-11-20,0,UFcCwCkp9K5D8c03Pwi7sA,"I eat here once a week, that's four times a month folks. Young has the freshest sushi in Vegas. I dare you, I dare you! Go in there and just order a few pieces of his garlic tuna sushi and it will most likely be the best you've ever eaten. There's a joke around this restaurant that the sushi you're eating today was swimming yesterday. The owner pays a premium and buys his fish from one of the premium dealers in the industry. This establishment also has the best spicy tuna handroll I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Other rolls of note are the Stacy Roll, Sin City Roll (nice and spicy), double seared roll, Vampire roll, so many, so delicious. Aside from rolls they have a great screaming orgasm, beef yakitori, poke (Salmon or tuna), and the best damn baked mussels you're going to find out here. Absolutely incredible. As for the service, I can't comment because I'm always here mid week before 4pm and have 2-3 chefs at the bar making me food for two hours. Obviously it gets very busy at night and yes there isn't a huge amount of tables so try and get here earlier. If you want massive tables go to one of those franchise restaurants with tons of staff and chefs on board. Sin City sushi is a diamond in the rough so don't expect a ton of people waiting on you. Show up early, grab a seat at the sushi bar, and experience finely crafted seafood concoctions crafted in the elysian fields and prepared in a utopian synergy of incredible flavors and chat with some of the friendly locals as you order each new selection. Again, this is the only place I bother eating sushi anymore. Negative service reviews be damned, you will love this food. As for those of you who have gotten sick here, interesting. Like I said, I eat here four times a month and have gotten ill, never. Perhaps your little tummies shouldn't be eating sushi anymore because you can't digest it. I know lots of vegans and vegetarians who still try to eat sushi occasionally and guess what........they all get sick. Each and ever time lol.

The new location is a welcomed upgrade to a sushi spot that was already hitting the right notes food wise. They have a reasonably priced AYCE option and the food is always well prepared. I enjoy the side board that they use for seasonal/limited items that are available in addition to the menu. I also notice that the owner seems to be very active in the business. Always a good thing.

The only negative is that the service can be slow and the serving staff seems to get things confused often. It occurred a couple times on my last visit in the beginning of January.

Took a minute for someone to help us but as soon as we did we received excellent service for the rest of our visit. Both my hubby and I got all-you-can-eat. It was $23 bucks which is comparable to other all-you- can-eat sushi places. 
What I especially love about this place is that no matter what you get everything is made with excellence. Their oyster shooters were on point and it's hard to find good oyster shooters!
The guys that were working there were very thoughtful in asking us if we wanted to try certain things that they thought were good...I'm so glad we did! We tried this awesome baby octopus salad and baked mussels to die for! The guys working there said that it gets pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights so I think we'll stick to afternoons and get the extra attention!

When we got there I hesitated on staying to eat because the restaurant was a little on the warm side. We waited a few minutes, looked around for someone to find out if there's a waiting list or do we seat ourselves. After a few minutes a waiter came by, told us it would be a 15 minutes wait. As we were waiting I looked around to see there are food on the ground. I gave them the benefit of maybe the previous customers had kids and they threw it on the ground.  We were seated probably 5-10 minutes later. 

Our server's name was Ramon. He came over with a smile, took our order, and went and got us water. My son decided on the AYCE. I was hesitant so decided I was only going to order the tempura Udon with vegetables- it came with two soggy shrimp tempuras, a few slices of mushrooms and a little spinach.  We also ordered salmon nigiri, Drum Roll, miso soup, Sin City Roll, Dragon Roll, and Tiger Roll. The fish were sliced paper thin. The rolls were soaked in sauce. When you bite into the sushi you can only taste the rice and sauce, where's the fish? The only good thing about this restaurant is Ramon, our waiter.

Oh boy, where do I start with the service.  To begin with we had to ask at least 3 times to get wasabi and ginger which should be one of the first things that is brought to the table once an order is made.  Next many things that we ordered never made it to the table during the meal:  we ordered oyster shooters, poke and salmon skins that just never arrived.  When our food did arrive we had no idea what was what aa the server literally dropped it and left.  We got something we didn't even order as one roll was fried and had some sort of cream cheese mix inside something we are not a fan of.  Water refills were non-existent as was clearing our empty dirty plates.  The waitress literally served our dessert and ignored the pile of plates we stacked ourselves in the hopes that she'd remove them.  She seemed very scattered and dropped our desserts and ran away.  Finally a male waiter saw our pile of dirty plates and did remove them as we were a few bites into dessert. To say we were disappointed with service is an understatement.  We did leave a 20% tip as we know the sushi chefs get part of it and as the food was delicious I felt it unfair to them to leave any less.  We only live a mile away and this could be our favorite sushi place but due to the piss poor service we received tonight we have no desire to return any time soon.

I used to go to their old location as well. I've been here over 100 times and I just can't get enough. I've even dreamt about this place XD
I can honestly make a huge list of things to try but I'll try to post a few favorites. 
For starters you have to have the 
baby tako (this stuff is crazy addicting. I've never had octopus that was this good) 
Baked mussels (these might actually be my favorite food in the world. They are crazy good. I've never had baked muscles that compare to these)
Screaming o (the fish melts in your mouth and the sauce is to die for) 
Jalape√±o poppers (so good and creamyCan get spicy)
Unagi (my favorite nigiri. They are honestly all good but unagi is definitely the best) 
Ugly roll (my personal favorite)
The scallop roll is also super addicting and delicious 
Vampire roll
Lew roll
Japanese lasagna 
I have mini review of all the rolls I get in my pictures If that's helpful. 
Some of the reviews complain about the older woman server who is the owners wife. They say she's slow or doesn't pay attention. I've known her for years and she is incredibly sweet.

When we finally got a waitresses attention (which btw she never returned our order sheet even though we did ayce) the sushi chefs were confused as to which one had the our order last. Needless to say my 1 year old had enough of the waiting before we even received our initial complete order after being seated there for about an hour at that point and had to walk out leaving the hubby to finish on his own poor service! Do give credit for the nice hamachi and poke were nice but they need to get a system as they don't have one!

After ordering your 3rd roll, they try to push the check on you so you can leave. We had a large party so we ordered quite a lot. Around the 6th roll, they would combine rolls. So if we ordered a philly crunch, California, and spicy tuna, they would take pieces of each to make one normal size roll. No where on their menu does it say they will do this. From our first time there to our second-in a matter of 1 week- they had shrunk down all their portions for appetizers, side dishes, and desserts. They also had some of their staff deliver us food while they were on their lunch break. One guy was in the middle of eating his own food while serving us our food. That's not hygienic at all.

But if you sit at the bar and end up with Leo or poncho  great guys amazing sushi chef's . First time I went  I sat at a table and dealt with a grouchy old lady from this place and holy shit she can't get a drink order right and she throws the plates on the table. She is known for being a grouchy old lady which I think makes the experience even better. But once I've been there twice and sat at the bar Leo knew who I was he knew my name exactly what I wanted the minute I walked in this guy is top notch and a all around great guy .He makes the experience amazing. I honestly believe I could never get a better experience at a high end casino compared to the amount of detail and service provided by Leo as well as the quality of sushi. This will be my go to place when I visit Vegas I had friends who were visiting from out of town  and they were blown away by Leo and the sushi. For those who complain about this place have no idea what real sushi is stick to your grocery store made California rolls .Sin City Sushi is the spot for one of the kind sushi and one of a kind sushi chef's named  Leo and poncho. I can't say enough good things about this place or it's chef's. By the way order the jalapeno poppers and then the blackjack with the same sauce that goes on the poppers and yes you can name your first born after me for that amazing tip.

Not only is the customer service a freaking sh*t show, but the food is just as bad. Honestly, it's pretty hard to ruin sushi, but this place managed to do so.

I came here for my friend's birthday celebration as a recommendation of another one of our friends. It took them 10 mins to sit our group of 6 down. Just stood at the door while they didn't even bother acknowledging the group. We had a reservation so I didn't think that would even be an issue. Finally the group got seated after too long. 

Then when we ordered, the rolls literally took an average of about 20 mins each to come out. We ate as they came out to the point where we were just hangry and bored of being there. The servers looked cranky like they didn't want to be there as well. Literally only got one drink refill each and the sushi did not make up for all this nonsense. 

My friend is vegetarian and this place doesn't offer than many veggie choices. Poor guy was probably still hungry after we left there. For $27 you can definitely find yourself eating better sushi somewhere else. Somewhere where you wont feel extremely bloated afterwards or get FOOD POISONING!!!

Woke up feeling sick as hell today and my tummy is just a mess. Thank you Sin City Sushi. I will never be coming back ever again.",6XFFMUDMKKQwgz1aDrX2DA,1,0,1,F3kvKbjsR_G5m2zcUymGTQ

On there all you can eat menu , they have some rolls listed but they won't make them for you. Like a zesty salmon roll. They say they are no longer on that menu even though it still shows it. 
The staff says the guys that made the menus messed up on printing them. So they have menus that are still showing items that you can't order and they refuse to make them.

At the end they delivered our check before we got our desert. While I was still eating my ice cream they asked for us to pay the check. I was surprised as I was trying to enjoy my desert. It kind of made me feel like they were rushing me out the door. I lost my appetite and left right after that.

Were immediately seated, and served with our drinks within the first 5 minutes. There was a good amount of people in the restaurant but enough space at the bar/tables so people wouldn't be sitting shoulder to shoulder. Two different chefs introduced themselves and took turns serving us as wells as the rest of the consumers at the bar next to us. I don't think there was a moment where any of us were waiting for our food. We always had something to eat!

Something that really stood out to me about this place is how the chefs/waitresses interact with their consumers. In most cases waiters/waitresses take your order with minimal conversation and they do the same thing over and over to all the rest of the tables. In this case, both the chef/waitresses took their time to ask us what we liked and even gave us recommendations to try some of their specials and off the menu stuff. Connecting with your consumers isn't easy which is why I give them extra kudos for making the effort. Speaking of, it seems like they have a lot of regulars. Every group that left while we were still eating PERSONALLY thanked the chefs (by name) and even asked about the ones that weren't working that day. 

As for the food, the fishes were fresh and melted so good in my mouth. Order the Cajun Albacore Nigiri, for sure! We never got the chance to try this one sauce the waitress recommended, but if you like spicy, ask the chef to make this habanero water dipping sauce thing.

2746792,2016-01-22,18,UFcCwCkp9K5D8c03Pwi7sA,"It's been a couple months since Sin City Sushi opened in the Scottsdale Plaza and I've gone at least once every two weeks since then. I go back so much because this sushi restaurant really is the best. The quality is so fresh, I almost cried in delight after taking my first bite of the Jamie Special roll. 

[Editor/Husband note: She actually texted everyone she knew in the city after trying it with the text 'the Jamie roll at Sin City Sushi is so good I want to cry']

Pros
-------------------------------
- sushi is the freshest I've ever had
- all rolls are flavored to perfection and quality is important. (I recommend the Jamie Special, Crazy Chic, Double Sear, Anna, and literally everything I've tried.)
- the staff is very friendly and personable.  They remembered us even on our second visit.
- the atmosphere is very chill, with no loud music interfering your meal. If you sit near the sushi bar, there's a single TV displaying a sports channel. You can actually have a really relaxing beautiful meal experience
- all the customers I see are regulars from their former location. They did almost nothing to advertise their opening, but they still have a big following. It's not just the Yelp community raving about their sushi!
- The bath rooms are clean. The whole place is clean; everything looks new because everything is!
- As you finish your dishes, a waiter will remove them so your dining space remains uncluttered.

Cons
-----------------------------------
- Tap water sometimes tastes terrible. Get a lemon or enjoy the extra minerals.
- This place is great, so it always has the chance to be busy. When it gets busy, sometimes they are understaffed. I've never had too terribly long of a wait to receive my dishes, but I know service varies depending on the crowd. There's only a few sushi chefs, so your order might be backed up. However, I promise it's worth the wait.

Prices currently are $23 for AYCE lunch and $26 for AYCE dinner. But you can always order √† la carte. Since eating here, I've been disappointed with sushi experiences at other restaurants. This place truly sets the bar high. I look forward to the next time I get to eat there.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,30,25,5,lhTn8T3AYl7e-J9367ZBWQ

I stay at the bar and all the chefs are pretty attentive. I noticed that there's not a full crew to wait on tables but I came here for the food. When you do find a waiter/waitress, they do attend to your needs immediately. I have a lot of friends in Vegas, this is where locals go to. It's about 15 minutes  from the strip. Reasonably priced.

The service is why I'm giving this place 1 star. My party of 4 wasn't acknowledged at all when we walked in. Finally we just sat ourselves. The server came over to give us our menus. We finally ordered and I got my nigiri first. We had ordered 6 rolls. Waited for awhile and kept seeing food go past us to another table. I was looking at our neighboring table and was wondering what they got because it looked really good. Lo and behold those were actually our rolls. Instead of the server going to get us new ones she just picked up the dishes from the table and brought them over to us. Most of our rolls were just sitting on top of the sushi bar not delivered. By the time we got them since there was so much sauce our rolls were mushy messes. 

We didn't get 2 of our rolls and mentioned it to the server and she said that that was all we ordered. Instead of giving us another paper to order more she just ignored our table for 15 minutes until we had to openly chase her down to get another ayce sheet. Finally ordered two more rolls because we were fed up at the time and just wanted to leave. Rolls once again were just left sitting at the sushi bar. For 27 a person, it was a waste of money.

I was feen'in for some sushi and yelped a place close to where I was. Tons of parking near the restaurant. 

Customer service was not as good as I expected, especially since it's a new sushi spot. There were not many people in the restaurant and seemed like the servers barely spoke English. 

Took almost 30 minutes to order our food. For a moment I was thinking that they forgot about my table. But after getting their attention they cake to our table.

We ordered:
Wet dreams $9.95
Kasia-12.95
Paradise- $7
Touchdown -7.95

To be honest everything was SUPER GOOD!! If I complained about the food I would be wrong. My all-time favorite was the Wet Dreams. OMG, Just the picture of it has me craving for more.

They also have an, ""All You Can Eat"" option for lunch and dinner. Lunch is $22.95 and dinner is $25.95. Do the math first and see if it's worth it. My table pretty much got full with the four sushi rolls we had so the option of all you eat was not worth it.

We were seated promptly and put our drink order in however it took about 20 minutes for someone to come take our order of food. we waited about 35 minutes before the first part of our order to arrive, keep in mind we ordered two salads, 3 orders of nigiri and a roll. It was not entirely busy as their we're open tables and spots at the bar and there was 5 chefs behind the bar. They brought out our order of salmon and one salad. 20 minutes after the nigiri and salad came the other salad was brought out 10 minutes later followed the roll. We decided not to order more with how long it had taken to put the order in and receive the food. We waited for them to come ask if we wanted more but no one came. The lady who was waiting on us kept stopping at the table next to us but never made it over. After an hour and forty minutes approx.

Pretty decent selection of sushi to choose from.
Rolls came pretty quick after ordering.

This is where the problems begin.
Just skip trying to tell to the ladies running the front.
Grab a pile of the order slips by the register and mark down a few things for everyone at the table, and then after you wave that in the air to get them to pick it up.
Start on the second slip, and add as you decide what you want, then give it to them when they bring your first order, rinse and repeat.

I am not sure what happened...

1. Service - On a windy Friday and the sushi bar was 80% full but the tables were mostly open.  Greeted right away, seated and given great service!  Menus, water, drinks and etc were quickly arranged.

2.  Ordering - Also great, attentive adn giving a lot of explanations.  2 of were going for AYCE and two were for the bento box style combinations.

3.  Food - The bento boxes were a bit, not bento like.  For some reason, i was just expecting the lacquer type boxes with sections for all the tasty goodness of beef,  rice, salad, California rolls, and your veggies and what nots all raring to go.  Instead the food was served on plates and separately.  The miso, then salad, then the roll, then the tempura, then the rice plate with a bit of the beef... Very strange but oh well.  I would say, everything lacked in presentation, but the taste was not a problem.

4.  AYCE - all the standards and a bit more unique ones.  I don't think it is necessary to go over each roll, as this is your standard menu. We had rolls and nigiri.

a. The Ebi - A bit rubbery.
b. The Scallops - Nice
c. The Uni - good, but small.
d. The Amai Ebi - good and the fried heads were good.
e. Scallops, Uni, Maguro, Hamachi, Albacore - all good.
f. The rolls, not bad, just a lot of ""stuff"" on these as normal.
g.  I also liked that overall there were not too much rice in the nigiri

5.  Service while eating - what happened?  After our first order was put in, we got the sushi after about 15 minutes after the bento boxes were delivered, so we really did not ""eat"" together.  The AYCE sushi came out very slow. It seemed to take forever.

Then, when we wanted to reorder, that took a very long time. I was getting a bit irritated.  We also had to ask for ginger and wasabi and also ask for our own chopsticks.

5.  Overall, I give the food about a 3 - 4. However, ambiance was very bare and the service after the initial seating continued to decline throughout the meal.

GK says, check it out, but order your AYCE quick because if you dabble, the reorder can take quite a long time!

GK says, check it out, however, Sushimon and others, you won't have anything to worry about.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,2,3,3,VyAEugZgB_ZqP1hR1xmlDA

I was so bummed out when they closed their Eastern location, then super excited to see that they had reopened close by! If anything, their nigiri quality seems to have improved! 

Went in last night and they were slammed. Full tables and we got the last two seats at the bar. I always sit at the bar and will admit, yes their two servers that wait on the tables are not that great, but who goes to a sushi bar and gets a table anyways? They are two middle aged Asian women that don't speak great English, but they are never rude. They try their best I guess. Behind the bar is Yung the owner, Jimbo, and Pancho. Don't know if Jessie is still with them. Yung is always super friendly and pushes you to eat as much as you possibly can, even though it's costing him money! They were having a hard time keeping up with orders last night, even though all three were slicing and dicing as quickly as they could.

My favorites have always been - the baby tako and the double seared roll. Their garlic sauce is good, but I think they overdo it a little with the yum/creamy sauce sometimes. Their rice is fresh and has a touch of vinegar to it which is how it should be and helps give it a tiny briny taste. The nigiri was solid with huge, fresh, and creamy portions. This place is right near my place - so excited to see them reopened. This place is in a different league than the dozen other sushi places up and down Eastern.

Overall, it is our go to sushi place and based on our experience of 2 yrs with Sin City Sushi, consistent quality of excellent fish, excellent chefs, welcoming atmosphere, we won't be going anywhere else for sushi.",c4yMO9m5fHcTMsAje1Ghsw,0,0,5,sSGWh4MmLNhP8UxEnrjlFA

The sushi rolls aren't sexually explicit but you might find some orgasm sauce on them. Overall this place is consistent and hits the spot.,kpbUJB-Gq40o7ObDbt5TUQ,0,0,4,ixVOeb79qRHR-CVP-bHFkw

Was at the table for a while but was never approached by a server for a drink order or offered menus.  Watched as a couple instantly get menus after sitting at the bar.

5434585,2016-02-13,3,UFcCwCkp9K5D8c03Pwi7sA,"New location, same menu, same awesome sushi chefs, same unendurable service in the dining area. Come here for the sushi and sit at the sushi bar where you'll get taken care of and you won't have to deal with any of the service issues we've had to deal with. The sushi is good enough where I'm not waving the white flag yet, but they're sitting on an 0-2 count in the bottom of the ninth.

I can't chalk it up to coincidence that I've received bad service in the dining area two times in a row. Recent reviews also support that it's not an accident (8 of 17 most recent reviews are 2-star and under). Unfortunately, sitting at the bar is not an option when I have my family so I have to deal with the servers that walk with their heads down and won't even make eye contact with you like they've committed some shameful act. And if they do happen to bring their eyes to your table, they won't notice any empty plates, empty glasses, or that there is no food in front of the customer. I ordered four times during my AYCE meal and each time I had to physically wave and verbally call the servers each time for the next order which should never have to be done if the servers are attentive and aware. Estimating from time stamps from my first pictures and our receipt, we were there for two hours which is unacceptable for a restaurant that was nowhere near capacity (see picture) after the dinner rush.

From ten years working in the industry, I'm one of the most forgiving diners when it comes to service and sympathetic to a server/bartender that's weeded because the restaurant is too busy and is understaffed. But this has not been the case. The ship is carrying some dead weight that needs to be thrown overboard.

As said before, the sushi has stayed consistent. For appetizers, the oyster shooters, baby tako, and soft shell crab are standard for me. There are generous portions with the dinner specials at an affordable price. I'll only be back if I happen to be in the area and if I know I'll be sitting in the sushi bar for sure. There are literally a handful of other options within a 3 mile radius.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,4,2,3,VgNOTtbONtqh12p1UzTV7w

It's certainly gives you the sushi fix you need. However the service was not great. Our waiter seemed to really push the All you can eat menu. After we explained to him we just wanted to look at the menu first and then decide, he continued to push it. Once he finally understood we were doing A LA cart he took our menus and gave us new ones claiming that they are different. They were the same. The environment in this place is not appealing and I did not feel welcomed. More than likely will not try this place again.",VGP8W1rCyn3e5etCuaEmUA,0,0,3,79lSSodswIHRXPsP1qu80w

When mentioned that we had been waiting long, we got a shrug. I will not be going to this place again. Food was to mediocre for what I had to endure. Wish it was possible to give 0 stars.

For the time I was there there were only 6 people in the restaurant and it took forever to get things. I will say that I do like the owner and the chefs of the place so I hope they succeed but they still need to work out some kinks and speed things up.

Even at the old location it was the same. The staff is intimidated of her and she is just straight out rude. So sad that this happens at what should be a great place. 
The only reason for the 2 stars is for the food. Please, keep this woman out of the resturaunt!

Their baked green mussels are the best of the best and this is probably the only place where I would order rolls. Since I haven't been to Sin City in awhile... The wet dream, kasia, drum roll, the Stacy, and the Japanese lasagna was just as I remembered it to be. The best rolls hands down. If you love garlic flavored sauce, kasia and drum roll is the roll for you! Completely melts in your mouth. The Stacy is amazing as well because of the crunchy flakes all around the sushi. You can definitely tell that the quality of the fish is fresh. Oh and as appetizer, don't forget to order the baked green mussels and baby tako! Really flavorful, fresh, and very juicy. Definitely love the sauce that goes with them. 

Very happy that they reopened the sushi place again. It's a bigger venue so it's more open compared to their other location. Their service was always good. Since the owners work there with their daughter and son, it gives you such a homey feel to their restaurant. I'll be back here again very soon!",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,2,2,4,vjaWHuK4G-gq0dn2qA57Ug

5866507,2015-12-03,0,UFcCwCkp9K5D8c03Pwi7sA,Came in for lunch today around 1:30p. There were about 6 people sitting at the sushi bar. 3 of them regulars from their previous location. So many choices to choose from. Good option for the customer who does not like sushi. Teriyaki chicken and beef. I got the Stacie roll with chicken katsu. So filling. The two gentlemen making sushi asked us if we were enjoying our food. A first for me. Our waitress was great. Hard to understand her English at first but very thankful for our business.  Plenty of seating. They have one area capable of seating 10-15 more customers. Asked the waitress if more tables were going there and she said space could be available for bigger parties. Within walking distance of my home it kind of scares me how many times I'm going to eat here. Plenty of parking. Especially around dinner time when most of the other businesses close by are closed.

Even if I didn't get sick, my opinion of this place would not change. I have been a server & bartender for a combined 15 years - and the horrible food handling I witnessed was absolutely insane!! It's actually no surprise to me that I feel like I'm dying. 

I watched our server remove dirty dishes from our table, set them down, and proceed directly to the sushi counter where she grabbed prepared food (often making direct contact with her fingers), and then taking them to a table, as she adjusted the rolls and other food with her fingers as they shifted and rolled. I even witnessed her take a roll that was mistakingly put on our table and then place it on the correct table, even after my daughter had already started to pick it apart with her used fork. And yes, we pointed that out to the server, as well as her bad food handling practices - but she didn't seem to care. 

Need I mention, that it took 55 minutes for my daughter to get a veggie sushi roll during her ""all you can eat"" meal, which she ordered 5 minutes after we sat down. A few of her other dishes that were clearly marked on the paper were also ""forgotten"" and after I questioned our server she became confrontational and agitated, raising her voice (practically yelling) and throwing her arms in the air as she continously told me she had brought everything out. ""What's the point in lying"", I asked her...""it's AYCE."" Seconds later, they called her to the counter for the few dishes that had been forgotten. Again, just terrible. 

It was just plain AWFUL!!! I am so glad I'm the only one who got sick. And to think I was doing myself a favor by eating clean and ordering the hamachi kama. Let me just say bad fish is NO JOKE!! This place however is just that, a joke. 

Drive farther and get the quality and freshness you deserve - and spare yourself the barf fest, your insides will thank me!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,4,2,1,DsdLFgWZ1qPRD7NiQZBYrw
