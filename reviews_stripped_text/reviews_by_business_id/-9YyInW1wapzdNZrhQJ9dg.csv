I was expecting a meh kind of buffet considering all the reviews I read on here, and coming here was one of the greatest surprises I've had in awhile! We aren't quite buffet connoisseurs, but we do go to buffets on occasion and I think I have a pretty good taste for them. It's true that this buffet is no Bellagio, but sometimes you just don't want to spend $65 per person and 2 hours in line for hand painted chocolate and napa valley focaccia and baby quail, ya know?
We got there at about 10:40 am, which I would seriously recommend because you pay the breakfast price ($14.99 per person) and while you are eating your breakfast, they swiftly turn over the entire buffet to the lunch/dinner menu, which you have full access to for no extra charge! It's awesome!
Some of the food i was impressed by included ricotta blintzes with strawberry sauce, a full yogurt parfait bar, HUGE selection of pastries, doughnuts, breakfast breads, an even huger selection of lunch/Dinner desserts (I loved the chocolate chip cookies! Crispy and chewy and almost like homemade! And they had real m&ms. Had to take some for the road in a napkin) and lots of roasted meats and veggies. The couple things I'd stay away from: the tortilla chips were kind of stale, the candied yams tasted like the syrup for the French toast.
The service was good and speedy, and the guy with the coffee was always eager to keep the mugs full. They had the AC on a little strong, but there are lots of hot foods, so it's okay. 
All in all, it wasn't world-class cuisine and probably not as fancy as the Aria or another expensive buffet here in Vegas. But it was tasty, a good selection, and just a really good price! To be completely honest, there is a 95% chance that if I revisit a buffet in Vegas, this one will be above the Bellagio or any other overpriced pretentious buffet on the list. Unlimited food and drinks actually cost me less than huevos rancheros and one drink the previous morning. Good deal to me!",rUFFTKGMq9ILhgU1vQ5vjg,0,0,4,OwnIHIpfE34oMWoNUwV-Og
176285,2015-08-27,0,-9YyInW1wapzdNZrhQJ9dg,"I ate at The Buffet inside of Westgate 3 times during my 10 day convention stay.  2 dinners and a brunch.  The price was reasonable around $25 for the quality and selections.

The carving station serves great prime ribs and yummy salmon.  Beef ribs were tough but certain pieces were great, roasted pork and ham were nothing to write home about.  The made-to-order pasta and omelette station were one of the very best features here. 

The mussels in garlic sauce was to die for.  Crab legs were an excellent addition to the brunch menu.  Excellent fried chicken.  Believe it or not but this place got one of the best hot and sour soup I've tasted in the US. Good selections of desserts.

Pros: quick and convenient, reasonably priced, above average service. 

Cons: for the price this is not a bad place.",T1QlZChXg5U7iMHbTUpuiw,0,0,4,OMDY4FxQieoDSO3b1-gATw

Spring rolls were not crispy, prime rib was also kind of dry. The beef rib I had was really fatty so it took a lot of manuevering. The salad bar looked good and there was lots of dessert variety. I am willing to concede a Sunday night may not be the best time to dine because the restaurant was not super busy, but I think LVH can do better with their buffet offerings, especially since the massive NAB conference was being hosted at the adjacent convention center and lots of attendees packed the hotel.

The smoked salmon was fresh and tangy. The omelette was very fresh and great!

It's not quite like that. Saturday brunch was the biggest letdown of the food I had in Vegas. The crab legs looked fine, but they tasted a bit dodgy and triggered the ""Back off this seafood"" instinct. You know the one. (Upside- No ill effects) BBQ pork rib that was mostly a lump of fat around a bone with a tiny strip of meat to pluck off. The bacon had the decency to not be paper thin, but it did twirl around my fork like overcooked pasta. They offered eggs Benedict which might have been passable for a buffet, but would not have passed muster with any decent restaurant. Petite NY steak was mostly gristle.

Perhaps my expectations were a bit higher given that this was a Vegas buffet. Perhaps it was a $19.99 price tag that left me wanting something just a bit better.

The food is plenty and comes with your staple breakfast items such as scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and potatoes. There are also pasta and spaghettis for those who gambled too hard the night before and doesn't know day from night. 

The beverage bar is self served and you can choose juice, soda, or iced tea. Milk, coffee, and hot tea are served by the waiter.

There is an omelette station where you can order a freshly made omelette stuffed with cheese, mushrooms, peppers and onions, and ham. One time, there was a steak/brisket station. The brisket was very moist with a good chunk of creamy fat. The steak was a bit dry.

We were able to find some good stuff during our first and second rounds, so you can still get an enjoyable meal for cheap.

Our server Keith was great too. He kept refilling our orange juice, coffee, and water all the way, and was very generous with making sure we were well taken care of. Thanks man! You really made the experience for us.

@ Prime Rib - The staple meat at all buffets. 2 of the 3 was really dry and almost burnt to a crisp. 1 of the 3 was at least red, but still wasn't very good. It just lacked flavor and the goodness of a prime rib.

@ Lamb chop - Why can't I get my meat more rare? This was just cooked perfectly for the temperature, but I want my meat bleeding in a puddle of blood when I eat it!

@ NY Steak - Cooked a notch above medium rare, was actually not too bad. Much better than the 1st or 2nd prime rib and lamb chop.

@ Shrimp Cocktail - Flavorless shrimp. Yum Yum. *rolls eyes*

@ Mussels - This was drenched in sauce, thats why it tasted okay. I guess you're eating the sauce here, and not the mussels. 

@ Salmon - This wasn't that bad. It was cooked just right and the fish still retained the natural flavors before it was seasoned to death. 

@ Orange Pork - If you're not Chinese or you lost your Chinese card you will enjoy this dish.

@ Pork Dumpling - No flavor at all. At least it was warm. 

@ Mash Potatoes - Was this really mash potatoes? Needed to seasoned more and actually mashed. Its mashed potatoes, not chunked potatoes. 

@ Pasta - This is  made to order. The chef will make it to you're liking. Pasta was acceptable, but just don't expect anything exciting with it.  I don't know why they give you a big plate of pasta, enough for 2 people.

@ Apple Pie - Tastes just like a regular apple pie. Nothing too exciting about it. It just a mediocre item. 

@ Bananna Cream Pie - Same as the apple pie. Nothing to really write home about.

@ Brownie - Just decent. Not bad or good. If enjoy brownies, you'll get your fill.

@ Cheesecake - Best item in the entire buffet. If you come here, you absolutely must get it. Now, its not to the same caliber as Cheesecake Factory, but since everything tasted so mediocre, this will taste exceptional!

Our waitress was very friendly. She was really attentive with clearing our plates in a timely fashion and bringing us our drinks. Nothing more you can ask for a buffet.

You can buy up to 3 non-locals buffet, if you have a group that want a cheap buffet. This is applicable on Sundays, Monday, and Wednesday.

This buffet is really small compared to the bigger buffets at the strip casinos. Food is pretty bad, but I've tasted much worse. Unless you get the locals prices, move along.

I had the salmon (dry and tough), chicken Marsala (flavorless).  The turkey was ok, as was the beef and the sausage.  I could find no fault with the shrimp cocktail.  The salad bar was uninspiring and blah - at least have some pepperoni.  
There was unlimited beer and wine -- cheap beer (Hamms) and wine.  Good to get drunk on but alas I had to drive to the airport later that evening, otherwise I would have  tried to drink my money's worth.
The best part of the meal was the soft-serve chocolate ice cream.
We went on a Sunday night and some of the things mentioned in other reviews were not there, namely Mexican food and sushi.  I like both.  My dining experience definitely suffered in their absence.
Service was good.
In the end I regretted being lazy and settling for the convenience of this buffet.  I would have rather have put the $120 I spent towards a better quality buffet at another hotel or gone to a restaurant off the strip and had a cheaper and better meal.",_MVBOp7bBtYU8FyCTMR6KQ,0,0,2,FwEULt9Ct01oqnLwCwOmMw

Staying at LVH, we got complementary coupons to try the buffet.  Knowing we were going to pay for a big dinner, we wanted to grab a small snack beforehand.  Sure, a buffet isn't quite a snack, but I wasn't expecting to eat much, and since it was complementary, the whole ""eating what I paid for"" concept that usually happens at most buffets didn't apply here.

But the food was actually quite tasty.  They're currently having their FESTIVAL ITALIANO.  I tried a few items.  A couple of their pasta dishes, some meat from their freshly sliced section.  They even have a made to order pasta station if you want to be so bold as to create your own pasta dish.

I was a little bummed we couldn't have any of the complementary beer and wine.  Apparently that is only for the weekends.

5496192,2013-08-05,0,-9YyInW1wapzdNZrhQJ9dg,"My wife and I ate here the last time we stayed at the LVH a month or two ago, and to be honest, I wasn't sober enough to write a review of it after that.  So, this time, we hit the Champagne Brunch, and after exercising remarkable restraint by not downing 37 Mimosas, I am able to give this place a whopping two stars.  

Hits:
The omelet bar.  But to be fair, every buffet has an omelet bar and omelets aren't rocket science.

Misses:
Every other single item on the menu.  From the tough-as-leather steak-looking substance to the just plain awful supposedly Chinese food that can best be described as ""orange-colored-soggy-chicken-mcnugget-looking-thing,"" there wasn't a single item on that menu that would make me want it again in the future.

Also annoying is the fact that you have to go get your own Mimosas from the champagne bar when every other place brings them to you.  Plus, the guy manning it was on his cell phone every time I went up there.  I had the impression I was seriously cutting into his Facebooking time when I asked him to make me another one, which isn't how you want to feel as a customer who dumped money to eat there.

Next, some of the food wasn't labeled, leaving me to wonder what it was.  Guess that's just part of the whole Vegas ""gambling"" experience.  Pass.  

There are much, much better buffets out there.  I think the GN's is the same price, and is a hell of a lot better.  And even the Station Casinos like Sam's Town have way better for a lot less.

My boyfriend has been staying at the Las Vegas Hotel for our budget trips and the casino gave us two complimentary buffet passes for dinner. They were FREE buffet passes, but I am still giving it one star. The regular price for dinner was around $21.00 per person and that is definitely NOT worth the price for this buffet.

Food: 
Orange Chicken: Their orange chicken is pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets with an orange syrup sauce. If I had the palette of a three year old, I would have maybe enjoyed this.
Chow Mein: It was a joke. There was chow mein all over the floor and counter. 
Carne Asada Meat: Dry and no flavor.
Steamed Dumplings: This is probably the one thing that I could eat at the buffet that had a decent flavor and texture. I think I ate 6 dumplings.
Fried Chicken: The batter was overly crispy and the chicken meat was super dry. I couldn't finish it. 
Pasta: There is a pasta bar that reuses the cocktail shrimp. There was nothing that special about it.
Ice Cream: The ice cream is a soft serve vanilla or chocolate which wasn't that special. It pretty much melts straight up when it lands in your ice cream bowl. 

Service: The ladies here were nice but they also seemed to have the same sentiments that I did in wanting to be at the buffet. 

And to top it all off? I got a nice old stomach ache when I left the buffet and chowed down on some pepto bismol pills to help my stomach process all of the crappy food that I just ate. 

Bottom line: I went here for free but I probably wouldn't come back if you paid me. There is a McDonalds down the street, I'd rather dine there and get my $2.22 Big Mac.",G89MgEpjVkawmL1cMdM66w,3,3,1,3lNwipRXHr_S9NGe2eDavg

My fiancé and I only came here because we had a free buffet voucher. If this weren't a free meal we would have never come here since the reviews weren't exactly stellar.

The only good thing about this buffet is that we had a nice waitress. She really paid attention to our drink refills and minded our plates. 

Everything else was just horrible... The food was just bland. 

-The pizza made me wish I was eating little caesars instead. 
-Tortillas just stuck on to each other... I had to pry them apart after grabbing more than I actually needed. 
-There wasn't much of a selection.
-The ""asian' section consisted of the most unnaturally orange ""orange chicken"" 
 
sigh...

-The soft serve ice cream was just like flavored and churned water. It was gross. 
-The pumpkin pie was the worst I have EVER had. I'd rather pick some up from the grocery bakery. It's just like previous reviewers had said... The sweets tastes like its make for diabetics. 
-The soft serve ice cream area had a container full of gummy bears... my fiancé ate one and said that it was as hard as a rock. - I have no idea how long those gummies have been sitting there. 
- The soft serve ice cream bar had sprinkles in a vase with a cork in it... ONLY FOR DECORATION!!! Who does that?! 
-I also saw a piece of apple pie with a HAIR IN IT!!!

We would have never came if it weren't for the $50 gift card we got. I guess this place is going down soon that it's trying to save cost to prolong its lifespan. 

Basically everything is tasteless. Nothing taste like what they look like. Chicken doesn't taste like chicken, corn doesn't taste like corn. I really don't know how they do it, it is amazing of how robbed of taste everything is. I had 3 oysters, 2 were tasteless, 1 was bitter. I was afraid to try anything else in the seafood bar after that. Either everything is frozen for a year or they have boiled the shit out of everything before serving. The raw oyster deal I really have no idea how that could be. The orange chicken was very obvious it was frozen chicken nuggets + sauce. I can't remember what else I had was bad...
