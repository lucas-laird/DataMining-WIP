I'm used to it at other places being very Hot, like soup should be. So I decided to order it again a week later, take out this time, and when I got home, again the soup was  only a little Warm. Once I heated the soup myself ( stove top) it was good! 
So yes good ONCE SOUP IS HOT!! 
Recommend telling them to serve it HOT!!!",j0zavHiIKuuhL868R-ipng,0,1,3,QrqKylOek-G4nh7qnylU1w

But then we all discovered BUGS and HAIR in our food. Not just like small little bugs... But bits and pieces of beetles. Yes, that's right. Beetles. We about threw up (and we are all RNs so you know it takes a lot to make us feel sick). When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she told us that what we thought were bugs were actually spices they use in the soup. she brought out a container of the spice and it didn't look anything like the bugs. To give you more detail, in one bowl of pho, we found the head and the body (separated from each other) of a beetle. You
cant mistake that for a spice. As long as you have eyes you can tell the difference. Anyway, we won't be back. If you decide to take a risk and eat there I would just look at each bite very carefully before you eat it.",63F5L7SqmFSWwc_zU45x0A,0,0,1,Y3fSVnv57Q1K3o8St3e3bw

The pho is top notch with a very flavorful delicious broth and a pretty generous serving. I tried the Bun Bo Hue for the very first time anywhere and now I'm hooked. I usually get the Crispy Imperial Rolls to start off then a nice steaming bowl of one of their savory soups along with a nice Thai ice tea to finish things off.

Just needed a quick bite to eat before work so I ordered it to go. The peanut sauce that came with them was pretty good, and the spring rolls themselves were light and refreshing to munch on. Also got a Thai tea with boba to go with my meal. Although the boba was a bit misshapen and clumpy, the tea was made just right, so I'd recommend getting that by itself.

I think that $4.50 for an order of two spring rolls is a little much, but I'm willing to pay since it saved me a trip to Spring Mountain. Otherwise, the service was great and friendly.

I've noticed some complaints about the smell in side with the cigar shop next door. being a cigar smoker I can instantly pick up on the smell when it's in the air and I did not notice it much in the resturant. Certainly nothing compared to inside the cigar shop. Perhaps some folks just have more sensitive noses. If it does bother you, then I still reccomend take out.

573952,2011-05-29,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"Went for lunch with my friends today after hearing about it from our hairdresser. We were nicely greeted by the workers, who we later found out were the owners of the restaurant. I've eaten at many Viet places and this was a pleasant visit. 

It was supposed to be a light lunch, however, because the menu looked so interesting, we decided to try a number of items.  

I had the special spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo, as they call it). It was well seasoned and the spiciness gave it a good kick.  I've never had this noodle anywhere else before, and since this was one of their signature soup entrees, I had a go with it. 

My female friend tried the Beef La Lot (which was this deliciously aromatic bbq beef wrapped inside an edible green leaf and then grilled to perfection).

My guy friend ordered the Beef Pho and it was well flavored. It was accompanied by a plateful of vegetable garnishings, which were very fresh. 

The three of us shared an order of 4 spring rolls (nothing like chinese eggrolls).  These were crunchy and crispy and it was accompanied by a plateful of lettuce and noodles.

It was such a healthful experience and then afterwards we also tried some desserts. The creme brulee and the 3 colored gelatin dessert was a great way to clean our palate.  Not to mention that the recommended ginger iced tea lemonade also did the trick on such a hot day as today.  It was cold and refreshing after a hearty meal.  The owner even recommended for us to try their 'banh mi' sandwiches and so we did (figured we'd want to snack on something a little later).

644022,2013-11-07,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"I have been to Viet Bistro many times as it is the closest Pho in the northwest. I prefer a few of the Pho restaurants in China Town but for days when I am too tired to drive there this is where we go. It is for the most part as good as any Pho, broth is flavorful, decent sized. The Satay has great flavor but it definetely spicy. I have also ordered the Bun before which is also good, what is to be expected. We normally get the spring rolls too which comes with a peanut sauce, again good but nothing outstanding.  I prefer my peanut sauce a little thicker but at least the peanut flavor is good. 

The two things I don't like about this place is it is a $1 or $2 more than other Pho restaurants and it is right next door to a Cigar shop, the smell of Cigars (which I like in certain settings but not with food) seeps into the restaurant. I think the smell must come from the ventilation because there is no way that much just comes in from the outside.

So off to Yelp I go trying to find a pho spot close to home and Yelp led us here.  Now, I wasn't too impressed with the reviews, but you gotta understand, the food choices that we have up north are pretty limited.  But we decided to take a chance.  

First off, as soon as we walked in, it smelled like smoke, as if someone was smoking inside.  That was a turnoff right then and there.  Even the teenager was wondering why it smelled like smoke.  We should have left but we stayed cause we were starving.  The customer service that we received could have been better.  The lady didn't give us our menus til 5 minutes after we sat down.  She got me and my son's order wrong and kept INSISTING we ordered a different item.  So I obviously was not happy with the service we received.

Now the pho, the broth was plain, didn't have much flavor in it.  I pretty much had to drown it with a ton of lime, sriracha and hoisin sauce.  The rest of the fams weren't too impressed either.

The water tasted weird but we're in Vegas and all the water I taste EVERYWHERE tastes like a weird mineral deposit, so what do I know.

On to the actual food:

I ordered beef & vermicelli noodles. Pretty good standard fare, beef tasted good, etc. The sauce was a little less flavorful than I'm used to and overall I'd say it was average verging on good. My partner ordered beef pho. She has low standards but I've gotta say this pho was pretty strange. The broth tasted unusually of cinnamon and the beef was FULL of fat & incredibly overcooked. She was picking the huge amounts of bad cuts of meat out of her bowl the entire night (like literally, strings and gobs of beef fat). I totally get that the beef in pho is supposed to be softer than normal beef, but seriously this stuff was so overcooked it was vaguely gummy and would've been best appreciated by someone with no teeth.

But the food.
Salt and pepper calamari order was $7 for 14 grease-soaked pieces, without any salt or pepper. Very bland, only tasted like grease, served with cups of sweet and sour sauce? Best part was the random pieces of fried carrot used as garnish.

The ""special combination"" bahn mi, with a smiley-face next to it on the menu, was a huge disappointment. Meat was all stacked on one end of the sandwich. I opened it up to distribute it evenly, only to find several blackened pieces of meat- the type of coloration that looks like food that has gone bad, not blackened from cooking. Picked out several pieces, then bit in, only to encounter some crazy spicy sauce or seasoning that was so strong it made my eyes water. All I could see were jalapenos (one piece on the entire sandwich?), and I don't mind those.

 This place may be right next to my gym, and the pho may be delicious, but I will not be coming back. If you can't reliably serve unspoiled cooked meat on your sandwiches, I am not going to trust the meat cooked in your soups.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,3,2,pK4D2Ygh9gl_D3xtM0FeGg

He taught us how to eat the egg rolls, even though I took a guess and wound up doing it right, I certainly appreciated the tutorial. I know he want to just wrap it up for me, but that would have been a bit awkward. Helpful, none the less. We ordered the egg rolls and fried wontons. We got egg roles and fried chicken wings. I know they sound the same. Fried. Oh well, we decided to keep them and they were good. I'd suggest, if this sort of thing would bother you, to speak clearly and point at what you want on the menu. We just rolled with it. I love that Viet is close to home. We also got there just before dinner rush, another plus. The portions (I noticed food is mostly served in bowls) are generous. For me, enough for leftovers. DING! Another plus. My shrimp and crab meat udan was amazing. I think I heard some angels sing. The flavor is so delicious. A new fav to add to my list and I know that this place will come in handy if I ever have a cold, that's for sure. I vow to eat pho, the next visit. Oh, and the gentlemen also gave us a little lesson on kimchi, because I asked if it asked Vietnamese which it isn't.  It's Korean, and I knew that, so I had a derp moment quickly followed up by getting my lesson and partial recovery from said derp moment. Anyhoo, I adore soup, and this is now my noodle soup heaven.

Like their Thai Tea with Boba in the spring and summer. We recently got to try their coffee with sweet condensed milk - that was certainly different. I recommend stirring it before every sip, otherwise it clots at the bottom of the cup. It's weird how the milk only lightened the bitter coffee taste most places mask. 
Anyway, service is always friendly and efficient. They always check on their patrons at least once during the meal, which is fine by us 'cause we don't ask a for a lot whenever we stop by. Hahaha...

2002526,2011-05-19,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"Spring Mountain's endless road of reasonably priced Pho restaurants just made it's way up to to the North West.  And it's about time!

I waited with baited breath for this restaurant to open in one of my favorite plazas adorned with Panera, Chipotle, Cupcakery, and Market Grille Cafe, already a great offering of casual dinner spots.  It finally opened and I managed to get in around 1:30PM for lunch, after running a few errands.  

The interior is very purple, with fresh flowers, tinted lights, and a closed off kitchen.  Comfortably seating 31 people, it's a somewhat intimate space.  There would three other tables there, two of which were Vietnamese diners.  (Which is always a good sign.)

I was greeted with a bit longer of a menu than I expected, (Not Pho Kim Long's length or anything like that, about five pages of offerings.)  I went with the generic route of ordering Spring Rolls and a basic ""everything"" bowl of Pho.

The Pho: Very good.  Not salty at all.  Came out lightening quick, and has a good balance of noodles vs. meat.  

Spring Rolls: Really good.  Flavorful, crispy yet moist on the inside with a really nice garnish presentation.  

The girl who owns it was very friendly and was ready to make a few recommendations for me on what to order.  I went with a very generic choice since i kind of wanted to get a baseline of what the quality was before I ordered the ""house specialties"", not to mention that I wasn't terribly hungry so I didn't want to overload with appetizers and soup and etc.  

I am of the opinion that like all businesses, they're somewhat new with the service so it's going to take a bit to get running super smooth, (i.e. my appetizer came out the same time as my Pho, which made me feel a little rushed), but all good things take time.  

I hope things do well for Viet Bistro as it's pretty good food with friendly service at an excellent price without the drive to Spring Mountain.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,4,3,4,UQq0zUbs-xJ75-2fMQbjYA

However, the bun bo hue was disappointing. The pork hocks were way under done. They are supposed to be tender and fall off the bone. I took a bite and couldn't even get a bite off! I had to pull it off with my hands. The broth wasn't spicy either. The noodles were good though.

We also got the shrimp spring rolls. It's two rolls cut in half and it has the thinnest piece of shrimp paste I have ever seen. Must have been less than 1/4"" thick for $6. Major rip off.

2213509,2014-09-23,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"Decided to try Viet Bistro because I wanted to find a pho place closer to home instead of always having to drive down to Chinatown. This hole in the wall is definitely not worth another visit because the pho broth was mediocre and pretty bland, and the people working here don't speak much English and won't understand your order no matter how many times you say it while pointing at the item on the menu.

When we first walked into the restaurant, it seemed really dark and smokey. Rachel S and I were seated at a small table but I asked to be moved because they gave us the wobbliest table possible. To buy time to review the menu, I told the lady that we would start with an A8 (nem nuong cuon) while pointing direclty at ""A8"" on the menu. She seemed to have trouble understanding me so I repeated it multiple times while continuing to point at it. When our appetizer was brought out, it was like a bowl of noodles or something and I told them they had the wrong table because we didn't order that. She told me that I had said N8 right?...NO! WTF! How can you possibly get it wrong when I was pointing at A8 and repeating it about 100 times! The lady contested me and didn't believe me until she brought me the menu back and I showed her what A8 was.

At least our pho was made correctly but the broth was bland and tasteless. I added a bunch of hoisin sauce which helped a little, but that broth definitely needed a lot of help. The meat and noodles were fine. Just wished the bowl contained a little less steak and more tripe and tendon...because the bowl I ordered was supposed to have all 3 but all I saw was 1 piece of tripe and tendon and a ton of steak.

When our nem nuong cuon finally came out, it was ok. Definitely not the best although it still tasted good. They use cucumbers for crunch instead of egg roll shell crumbles like Nem Nuong Bistro/Brodard. Go there instead, especially because it's the same price at 2 for $4.95",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,0,2,4FjE2LyDKcgNGg7XFWsuSg

They have a large menu, including Banh Mi, which is nice.  We ordered some rice vermicelli noodles, an order of shrimp summer rolls and an order of pork summer rolls, and I had a bbq pork banh mi.  The shrimp rolls were fine...no better or worse than any other place I have been to.  I really enjoyed the pork ones, as they had a nice bbq flavor to the pork.  My banh mi was very tasty and had a super fresh and soft baguette.  It was filled with a healthy assortment of vegetables and had a good taste as well as crunch factor.  The meat could have been a little more thick, as it just had one thin layer of the pork, basically the same as the summer rolls.  For $5.50 it came with a little soup cup, which was delicious.  It was hot and refreshing and I enjoyed it immensely.  They screwed up my banh mi by putting mayo after I asked them not to, and despite the fact that I had eaten half of it already before I really noticed (1 half was much heavier with mayo), they remade the whole thing for me.  The waitress was very nice and friendly, and I did not lack for water or beverage refills at all.  My wife enjoyed her noodles, especially the fried spring roll that came with it.  

Overall, I thought it was a very solid meal and there are many other choices I want to try as well, including a beef roll wrapped in some kind of leaf.

I had the shrimp with crunchy egg noodles. The nest of noodles sat on some kind secret house sauce. The top was crunchy and the bottom of the nest was tender. It had a bit of spring though, not as tender as glass noodles. 

The squid was so tender and flavorful. If you want to get away from deep dried squid then come here as your first try to other cooking methods.

The shrimp was tender and flavorful as well. Steamed just right. The star was the baby bok choy. Bok choy can be tricky to cook. Done the wrong way baby bok choy can be bitter. This baby bok choy was crispy yet tender and not bitter. Understand, not every piece will not be bitter,but this place has the best baby bok choy. 

The disappointment of the dish were the couple fried fish balls. Don't be afraid of those, if cooked properly they are tasty. These however, were rubbery. Such a shame.

Their egg rolls were wonderful with a bit of pork, glass noodles, and what looked brine shrimp (know they were not). It was presented with a dipping sauce of light fish sauce and lime. The dipping sauce was light and brought out the egg

They only have Pepsi products.. Don't say that no one warned you! Their menu is very simple which is best when trying something new so it wasn't too overbearing for me! 

I tried the fried wontons and the #1 without the cow stomach (it had a weird name?) The wontons were crispy and very good! It needed just a pinch of salt but then again, I always add too much salt to things as it is. It came in 4 pieces. It was $3.25 from what I remember. The pho comes in two different sizes. The regular is big but the large is huge! The large alone is enough to take home extras. The regular size is about 8.99. It's a fair price in my book! The broth is very light (keep in mind it's my first time trying pho) and I actually loved it. I added some salt (duh), soy sauce (I swear I'm going to die from high blood pressure) and Sriracha to it and it was just perfect. I don't really enjoy the noodles as much, but I loved the broth and beef so much. I think it was actually my favorite part! It also comes with a huge plate full of bean sprouts and limes so you can put as little or much as you'd like. 

I should also add that they're very friendly here. It's a hidden gem right behind the Canes and In N Out on Rock Springs!

2837533,2013-12-06,3,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"Half of my week is spent working in Summerlin, and the Vietnamese options are slim pickings, but this is my go to spot when the craving arises during my work lunch hour.  For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique. 

I know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the true gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).   

I was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,11,11,4,f0bymAlI0Z1HIxV_aBVNMw

I always get the vegetable/tofu pho. Their broth is incredibly fragrant, and it comes fast and piping hot. Plenty of veggies, noodles cooked well, really good. I also enjoy their banh mi sandwich, all different kinds. One day I decided to order ginger tea lemonade instead of my usual water. Holy crap! Best drink I've ever had! I became obsessed quickly, and the woman who makes it fresh came out eventually to tell me how to make it. I won't be straining fresh ginger any time soon, so I just dream of it instead.

We had the Tamrarind Chicken Wings.  The wings weren't seasoned and only glazed on the outside.  When you bit into the chicken, it was just dry with not much flavor.  They should season the wings before they fry it, then add the glaze.  I wouldn't order these again.

I had the Lemon Grass Chicken and substituted rice for vermicelli.  The lemon grass chicken wasn't bold enough but I liked the taste of the onions.

My friend ordered the Combination Vermicelli bowl with pork, shrimp, and meatballs.  This was definitely the best dish we ordered but anything on Spring Mtn is better.

They do have Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef), Banh Mi sandwiches, and a wide array of Pho. 

Based on the items we ordered, it's average compared to Viet eateries in Spring Mountain but is a decent option for those who live in the West Lake Mead area.  

Since I don't live in the area, I probably won't make an effort to make it back, but it was average.

It's consistent, the staff is nice and the food comes out quickly, making this place a good work lunch spot. I usually get the tofu and vegetable pho but last time I got the hue spicy lemongrass tofu and vegetable soup which kind of blew my mind. It has way more flavor than pho and they serve it with this spicy paste that ups the spice level tremendously. It's also served with mint instead of basil as well as the bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno. The noodles in this are round and similar to spaghetti instead of the vermicelli that comes with the pho. I actually prefer the vermicelli because the round noodles get soggy quicker but other than that this dish is far superior. My coworkers ordered the special combination banh mi and it was crazy small with not a lot of filling. It's too bad these don't come with anything but the sandwich. I think people would pay more for a side or pay less to be able to get two sandwiches. Overall I'm glad to keep coming back to Viet Bistro.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,2,4,_bU-lG2Dyh31tKbFzIi6Dw

This place wasn't the worst nor the best, but it was pretty good I must say. 
 A regular bowl was perfect not to big nor too small. The broth had lots of flavor but it wasn't mind blowing good they used a lot of ginger in the broth which isn't bad but if you no like ginger then I don't know maybe you no like it because it has a strong ginger aroma when brought to the table. (Excuse my FOB moment) But it was good. Oh and an added plus I'm happy that they didn't get stingy with noodles like some places do. When ordering pho you always get a small plate of veggies for your soup I just wish they offer more variety of oriental greens selections like the other places.

I also ordered some coconut juice :) it was awesome! It came out in a fresh coconut!! 

Service was great food came fast and it was a very friendly environment. It's great to have a good pho place close by in our NW area. I will definitely consider coming back for a quick grab n go place to eat.",rSw1VBi2A93qEsQti6eiXg,4,3,4,g1QWTrymVIo_h5Ds4Rtqdg

Service was rather quick. The man who attended to us seemed to be the owner, he was approachable and would give recommendations if you ask. 

Our food was out pretty fast. I ordered the beef pho with eye round steak and beef balls while the bf got his usual chicken pho. We also got the vietnamese iced coffee. 

I love the broth! It was not as greasy as some of the other vietnamese places I've been to, and you can actually taste the herbs. The rice noodles was meh, it was a little too starchy for me, for some reason. The eye round steak was a little overdone. Iced coffee was a tad too sweet, there's a little too much of the condensed milk. 

Overall, a decent experience. I'll probably come back again. 

Side note: if you like spicy food, ask for the ot satay sauce. it's basically Thai chillies fried with garlic paste and it is SPICY- a much better alternative to siracha, in my opinion.",LMJKMZOEiQpWNMBT2G2t_A,0,0,3,E2Y4_Kzleiq663zL_iIeWA

Viet Bistro has good food and service, and it sure beats driving to Chinatown for my regular go-to spot for pho, Pho So 1.  Viet Bistro is pricier but I'm sure rent in this plaza is not cheap.

Their egg rolls and shrimp fresh rolls are excellent.  I've ordered their grilled pork vermicelli noodles and its outstanding.  I've also ordered that to go and they package it up nicely.  My wife loves their Hue Spicy Noodle soup.  I'm afraid to try it because it looks so spicy...almost like flames simmering in the broth!!!

The one thing I don't care for is unfortunately the one item on a Vietnamese menu that usually defines the restaurant - the Pho.  Whenever I eat pho at restaurants I order the brisket & well-done flank.  I've probably had this dish in a dozen+ restaurants.  At Viet Bistro, I find the beef to be too thick and tough to chew. 

However, Viet Bistro does offer something I've never seen before - Filet Mignon Pho. Wow!!!  Delicious thin slices of filet but pricey at $11.

I ordered bun thit nuong cha gio (rice noodles with pork and egg rolls). The dish itself was good and I don't really have any major complaints, but I will say that the flavor isn't as strong as some other restaurants I have been to. Although that could be due to the fact that I've been to a bunch of Vietnamese restaurants back in Garden Grove (in California) and the food there is cheaper as well xD. The veggies were good and the egg rolls were crispy, albeit they were on the skinny side haha. One thing I didn't like was how the noodles was all clumped and sticky since it took some time and maneuvering with my chopsticks to be able to mix all the ingredients together. Besides that, everything else went smoothly lol.

The atmosphere was clean and the staff was very polite and attentive (which is a big plus considering Asian restaurants have been known to lack good customer service). I saw a good amount of people in the restaurant which was reassuring although I didn't see many Asian people in there at that time xD. Where are all my Asian peeps at?

The very best bun bo hue in all the land.  I could probably eat this dish almost daily and never tire of the rich, bursting flavorful goodness that delights my tongue with magical flavor tingles.  The wonton noodle soup is my second favorite dish here.  I didn't really have an opinion on the pho, as I've only had it once and remember it being good.  

The staff is super cool and nice.  On my first visit the main guy in charge noticed my stiff shoulders and arms folded across my belly in an attempt to conserve my body heat and he immediately rushed to turn off the fans near my table.  On my second visit I totally butchered the pronunciation of bun bo hue, to which my waitress ever so politely corrected and assured me that it happened all of the time.  It probably doesn't, but I appreciated the fact that she was so nice about it.  Also, by the way, this particular visit was when my love affair with bun bo hue started.  I've had it many other places, but never quite this delicious and tasty.  

The place is very clean and inviting, decorated with tasteful individual pictures of featured dishes above each table - not overdone and not like the Chinese take-out restaurants that have a wall of pictures of every dish offered with half the names misperred.  At first I thought the name to be somewhat of a contradiction, as Asian food and the imagery associated with ""bistro"" don't seem to jive.  But after dining there a few times, I realize that it works.  The space is fairly small and intimate, with approximately 10-15 tables.

Parking can sometimes be tricky if you try to visit on a week day around lunch time as it's located in a strip center that houses a variety of popular lunch spots.  Any other times, parking is a breeze.

The main reasons why I gave this place a one star was because: 
1. The service was terrible. I was not greeted at the door or at the table until I got someone's attention 10 minutes later. Yes I did sit myself because I thought that was the norm, and yes I came in during business hours. Maybe they were playing hide-and-go seek with me. Who knows. 

2. Perhaps they were trying to be hip, but the room was really dark... The only bright light came from the kitchen. 

3. All the items on the menu were quite pricey compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown 

4. I ordered the bun bo hue and received a few pieces of meat, noodle, soup, and bean sprouts. Keep in mind that bun bo hue should have banana root/blossom or at least red cabbage on the side, beef shank, pig's feet and pig's blood cubes inside the the soup.

You are better off making 10 cent ramen at home. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Chinatown.",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,5,3,1,gH5Rkm7kCyeLkjmoPv2FKQ

Atmosphere: the restaurant is pretty big. It could fit quite a bit of people. The waitress was really nice and patient while we decided what we wanted to eat.

My friend decided to try the Vietnamese sandwich. We both used to live in San Francisco so we had high expectations. The sandwich was definitely sub par. There was nothing great about it. The bread wasn't nicely toasted and the meats didn't quite work on it. It wasn't memorable whatsoever. 

The BBQ vermicelli bowl on the other hand was delicious! I decided to get the bowl with the imperial rolls. It was delicious!

So, I was quickly seated and the server asked if I knew what I wanted. I told him the bun bo hue and later added the grilled pork meatball spring rolls. 

First, I am nt an expert on bun bo hue by any means. My ratings relate more to the overall quality of the dish and not so much to the flavors. The smell and the taste of the soup didnt remind me of pork or beef, but of onions. It was tasty, but I felt it should have had more beef or pork flavor to it. Garnishes consisted of bean sprouts, slice jalapeno, and limes. No other herbs or greens were given. The slices of beef were chuck full of connective tissue. That's not a bad things since the meat was well braised and tender. They were skimpy with the meat however. The lack of beef is further emphasized by the fact there is no pork blood or pork hock in the soup. The only real plus of this dish was it was not too spicey and I was allowed to adjust the spiciness to my taste. The grilled pork meatball spring rolls were ice cold. I think they were made earlier and left to sit. They didn't wow me.

I picked Viet Bistro as my first stop for Pho based on location (in my hood) and Yelp reviews. It had been bookmarked to try for quite a while!

Chicken Pho full of fabulous flavor! I added jalapenos, bamboo shoots, basil and lime.  I ordered it sans cilantro and onions and it was perfect for this nasty cold I have.

The hubby had the Udon Noodle bowl with crabmeat and shrimp and also full of flavor and spicy too.

Eggrolls were delish, fresh and hot.

Thai Iced-Tea was the perfect blend.

Service Friendly.  

Prices I think a bit high...$36 for two bowls, egg rolls and three iced teas.

The downer is that this place is in a strip mall located right next door to a stinky cigar shop...and yes sadly I could smell the smoke :(

Well, we've been to Pan Asian before and it was GREAT!  But we like to try new places.  This place is also located right next to the Cupcakery and another favorite place of ours, The Market Grill.

We walked in and there was just one other family seated.  The place was fairly small (going theme for most Asian restaurants).  We were joyfully greeted by what appeared to be the owner.  What a pleasant man he was.  The menu was big so, it took us a few minutes to decide.

We got:
Veggie Pho (minus the tofu) for me
Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) for hubby
Chicken Pho (split between the kids)
Bin Manh/Ban Minh??? (sliced pork sandwich)

Well, I gotta say, everything was quite delicious.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the sliced pork sandwich, too much fat for my taste--ack.  I even cringed when I peeled the sticky fat from the pieces of meat so I could eat them on the sandwich.  Yeah, I have a thing about fat on my meats...must be trimmed clean.  My 6 yr old and hubby thought it was great though.

The service was good.  Our cups never went empty.  

There was an odor to the place (other than Pho broth smell).  It smelled a little smoky.  As in cigarette smokey, which we can't stand.  We couldn't figure it out but it faded eventually or we got used to it.

I was the first customer here and even though it is supposed to open at 10, upon my arrival, I was told that they weren't ready to serve until 10:30.  I came at around 10:20, so I didn't need to wait too long, but keep in mind to not come at 10:00 on the dot or else you'll be waiting 30 minutes.

Anyway, being Vietnamese and always living in places with exceptional Vietnamese food (San Jose and Orange County in California), my standards for Vietnamese food are ridiculously high.  However, I recognize that I am in Las Vegas and not in California, so I can't compare Vietnamese eateries here to those that I've had.  The bun bo hue here was decent - the broth had good lemongrass flavor and the right spices and heat.  I wasn't dehydrated from MSG nor was the broth exceptionally greasy.  But the meat cuts and accompanying veggies were lacking.  This definitely takes away from the authenticity.  There was also not enough meat, in my opinion.  The bowl is kind of small, so I would size up if you have a moderate to big appetite.

The service here is good, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The prices are fair - most things were between $7 and $12.  Portions are small to decent.  The menu had a good variety.

What sets them apart from other regional cuisines in Vietnam is their relatively small serving size with refined presentation, a vestige of its royal cuisine. 

But the star of Hue is the Bun Bo Hue, spicy beef udon. There are many places that claim to make Bun Bo Hue in Las Vegas, but I would only go to two, Bosa 1 and now Viet Bistro. The service at both these establishments puts all other Vietnamese restaurants to shame.

Especially because I don't have to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain to get good Pho.  I would give this place a 5 but it's lacking in a few areas.  

1) I'm from So Cal and I'm used to Pho costing you no more than $5 for a huge bowl.  All the Pho bowls here are hovering around the $8-9 range.  

2) Its right next to a cigar shop.  The constant wafting of cigar smoke/odor makes into this otherwise cute restaurant.  The odor kinda turns you off a bit.  
 
So for me that took away a couple stars.  Now onto the good stuff:

Great Food!  I had a vermicelli with grilled shrimp bowl ($9) and it was delicious.  Everything a good bowl should be: Fresh ingredients, delicious seasonings, and the right amount every time.  The grilled shrimp was superb and the noodles with the accompanying sauce blended well together.  I'd definitely order it again.  

Good Location.  Located right off the 95, its a perfect location for a Vietnamese joint.  The options in the Northwest are commercial and predictable.  This was a breath of fresh air to me.  Sometimes driving all the way downtown is not an option and this is right up my alley.

Attentive Service.  The servers there are always very helpful if you can't decide what you want.  They are very attentive and ensure you have everything you need.

pros: offered extra pho noodles for free! manager is pretty attentive, secret spicy addon!

cons: not the cleanest, slightly more expensive, they don't use real broken rice =/

We walked in and the place is fairly modern, but had the smell of gasoline or fresh paint or something. It was pretty distracting.

The (I assume owner) greeted us, made recommendations and in general, we felt taken care of so that is a major plus in a Viet restaurant.

The quality of the food is standard but the portions are huge! The $6.50 regular pho bowl was the size of a large normally in my opinion, and it came with like 8-10 slices of beef! Seemed never ending. The special spices he offered also gave things a nice kick. The food flavor hit the spot but I'm not incredibly picky about my Pho. I love Pho, I find it hard to mess it up.

The Com Bi was a disappointment. The pork chop was good but the steamed egg cake was inedible, everyone at the table agreed. And the biggest offense was they don't use real broken rice.

The food wasn't very good at all the broth needed a lot of flavoring added to it and all the noodles just seemed to clump together in the bottom of the bowl in one large gross lump.

But thanks to My T's review, I just had to try their Bun Bo Hue. It's something I've never ordered before, so I have nothing with which to compare. That's really not a problem, of course. In the end, I enjoyed the soup. My friend, Lisa Y, says it's not her fave BBH in town. As for me, it was pretty darn good. I loved the tenderness of the beef. It wasn't very spicy--from what I understand, BBH is supposed to be spicy--but it had a nice hint of heat that enhanced the flavor without the usual runny nose effect.

I should point out that the bowls did not come out with pig feet. I asked about them and they brought a couple right out. I guess they figure that pig feet probably don't appeal to non-Vietnamese people, but it's listed as part of the dish on the menu! Anyway, that's a minor complaint.

The one weird thing about this place is the lighting. It's fluorescent, but many of the panels are blue, while a couple of them are orange. They just give the place a strange hue.

My friend and I were in the mood for some Bun (vermicelli rice noodle dish) and we decided to try Viet Bistro, I'm really happy that we did.

We were greeted at the door by Kevin the owner, he's very nice and took great care of us.

We ordered fresh shrimp Summer Rolls and fried pork Spring Rolls for appetizers. I ordered grilled Pork Bun for my main, and my friend got the grilled Chicken Bun.

Summer rolls came up first. They were fresh and tasty, but not exceptional. The paper-thin softened rice paper is stuffed with shrimp, pork, cabbage and a small amount herbs. The peanut sauce they come with is ok, but we asked for some fish sauce with them which was better. I would have liked a bit more fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro, or something) with these because they were just a bit bland.

Next came the friend pork spring rolls, wow they were really good. These are served in traditional Vietnamese style with lettuce and cilantro to wrap around the fried roll, and fish sauce for dipping. What made these great was how crispy the fried outer roll was. It's such a great texture and flavor combination to roll up the fried spring roll in lettuce with the cilantro inside, then dip the whole thing in fish sauce. Yummy!

Next came our main dishes, grilled pork and chicken bun bowls. This is a dish that I really love, but it needs to be done right. I've been disappointed the last few times I got this dish at places in Chinatown due to soggy overcooked noodles, burnt/overly charred meat, or not-so fresh veg.

Viet Bistro does Bun proper. The noodles were a perfect al-dente with amazing texture, the bean sprouts and other veg were crisp and fresh, the grilled pork was caramelized to perfection, and it had just the right amount of fresh herbs. 

If I have to nit-pick for a con, I would say the fish sauce could be a bit stronger. It's good, but tastes a little watered down compared to how I normally like it.

Overall, this place is an easy 5 stars for the food and friendly owner/host.

Side note:

Upon entering this place I immediately smelled very strong cigar / pipe tobacco smoke. I asked the owner why it smelled and he explained it was the cigar shop next door. He seated us in the back where the smell was not so bad. There is also outdoor seating which I would recommend if you are sensitive to the smell of smoke.

It's unfortunate that the cigar shop next door is polluting the surrounding restaurants and shops. There's a cupcake shop on the other side of the cigar shop, and it has the same issues with the smoke smell.

4934390,2011-10-23,3,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"I was way out in the northwest today and decided to try a Pho place up in this area.  So based on YELP, I tried out Viet Bistro and walked away very happy.

1.  If you haven't read My T. or Paolo D review of this place yet, do so.  I used it for my analysis and visit and I was happy!

2.  Parking - strip mall, very easy.  Odd that it is near a cigar bar, which has a very distinct cigar aroma, however, once inside the restaurant, you cannot smell the cigars.

3.  Ambiance - Small narrow place, with purple walls. Nice overall.  Small and cozy. Nothing fancy.

4.  Drinks - I always prefer fountain drinks and they do have this over the canned sodas, so definitely a plus.

5.  Food - Ahhh,  I tried the Bun Bo Hue based on MyT an Paolo D review an it was great. It was not too spicy at all, and in fact, was very subtle.  This is great as it is not too overpowering and you can always add more spices or the jalepenos.  The noodles were just right in terms of texture and firmness.  The serving size was just right and this is the first time that I drank so much of the broth. It was very, very tasty.  My son had P11 and he enjoyed it as well as with an Iced Coffee.

I also ordered to sandwiches to take home and they taste great and better yet, the aroma is even better.

There is a ton of stuff on this menu. I will come back again, although it is about 35 minutes from where I live in Henderson!!!

6.  Service - As good as it gets.

GK says, check it out.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,8,4,5,9zxJqVl-QRgBLcpciuU6Og

The prices are a bit more expensive than the other pho places, but considering the location, it's to be expected. Came here again, had the shaking beef w red rice and the bun bo hue. The beef was flavorful, but the rice was pretty bland. It seemed like some sort of tomato rice. The bun bo hue was not really spicy, and it was rather lukewarm. Very disappointing! When we asked for bowls to share our dishes, the server brought out four different looking and sizes bowl... It was really weird. This might be a mom and pop shop, but I couldn't have possibly be the first one to ask for bowls!?",uU2B1vrqkpWJI30xoooabw,1,1,2,v9FsaybF9XFiI8CT94Wb8Q

5048456,2012-06-24,2,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"First time the BF and I dropped in I grabbed bun with pork, shrimp and eggroll. Their bun is really good. The eggroll was nice, the pork and shrimp had a nice marinade and was cooked to juicy. The noodles were blanched just right and the veggies below were very fresh. The BF had the curry and while it was full of mixed veggies and chicken, he didn't really like it. I tried a bit later at home and it tasted more like gravy than curry and I thought it was okay, but not something I would order again. 

We weren't feeling so great this week and came for their vegetable and tofu pho. I don't think they have vegetarian broth here or if they do it's not on the menu. There was a lot of broccoli, carrots, bokchoy and tofu in it so they didn't skimp on that which is nice and the sprouts and basil and the ""saw leaf"" that came to the table was very fresh. The broth was a bit too heavy with white pepper and star anise though. It did the trick with helping my sore throat, but it was abit overpowering of a flavor that I don't prefer. I hope that this isn't the usual and was just an off day...I would give it a chance again. 

 I generally think the quality of ingredients here is better than the standard and because of the location far from any competition, the prices reflect both things so keep that in mind. People get so used to dirt cheap pho that you may feel it's expensive even though most items are below 10 bucks. I think the service is decent, and friendly both times and seem family run. 

I say, come for the bun / rice plate , but some of the other things I'm not too sure about. I'm sure we will be back. Sometimes we just don't want to drive all the way from Centennial to Chinatown to get some Viet food.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,2,3,kP8zV5cCCzK-n2pmFqum9g

Writing this as we sit and wait for our food only because there was one thing that stood out so strong about the place. The strong smell of cigar inside this small little 11 table restaurant. It's because of the cigar place next door. MAN is it strong. Ventilation has to improve for me to be able to properly rate this. 

Located in a Plaza on Lake mead and , the parking here is crazy full. So set just enough time to get a proper parking spot where you don't to have to walk. 

So, like I mentioned in my header, it is small inside. 11 tables @ a probably of max 30 people and 4-5 people per table at their biggest table. So if you have a big group, you may want to call ahead so they can combine tables. As for their single table, it's pretty small as well. Condiments take up some space, and as soon as drinks, appetizers, and food come, your all out of realestate. 

What we ordered:
2x P1 Combination phone with rare steak, flank, tendon, meatball, and tripe.

Fried tofu appetizer

Thai tea with boba to go.

The tofu was cooked very well. Nice golden seasoned crust with their special sauce. Yummy!
The pho is good. In fact it's not bad at all. Meat proportions is just right, I love their tendon here, noodle is the perfect length, and the soup base has the right consistency of flavor. Satay sauce is a bit more spicy than we are used to, but it worked. 

Customer service is great. Seated eight away even thought limited seating, but was served and taken care of from beginning g to end. Greeted and thanked.

Overall, this is definitely a come to place for us. Doesn't beat our favorite Photos Saigon 8, but definitely the runner up when we don't feel like making that trip to spring mountain. 

I would definitely rate this higher if the cigar smell did not linger. Otherwise, we found a new pho spot to eat at.",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,5,4,3,3iNVrL2vqPIIUk1iGhe0jQ

I went in about 45 minutes prior to closing, and it was empty with the exception of a group of four people sitting down to eat. I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who I presume was the owner. We spoke briefly after I ordered my pho to go about the spice and how much I enjoyed spicy foods, the spicier the better for me. The restaurant was very clean. He gave me extra jalapeños and some of his extra spicy sauce. When I got home I couldn't wait to delve into my delicious pho, but immediately noticed that it had a different smell than I'm used to. It was a bit pungent to be honest. Whatever, I still wanted to give it a shot, so I put my fixings in and.......ugh it simply was not good. The broth had a sort of sweet taste to it, and just didn't mix well with the fixings. I added sprouts, jalapeño, onion, some lime, and some spicy sauce. Not even the sauce could take away that bitter sweetness. Needless to say this wont be my spot for pho. The three stars are for the cleanliness of the restaurant, the super nice owner/gentleman, and the simple fact that I only tried the pho, nothing else.

I'm more of a banh mi person which is why I don't prefer this place for it because of price to ratio. We'd normally come in if the husband is feeling pho-ish as we wait for our kids to get out of their faith formation class up the road. 

The owners, however, are really nice and welcoming from our experiences. They used to have a business back home.in Hawaii so I'm all about supporting traces of 808. The place is pretty clean. I just couldn't stand the smell of the cigars while eating. I'll smoke a cigar...but just don't prefer the smell of it when I'm having dinner with my younger kids.

Anyway, I'd recommend them as I think they're one of the sure bets around this way. And gosh knows we dont have much pho options around this way.

5599516,2012-11-27,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"This is my third time here and was introduced to this place by some Vietnamese buddies if mine.  Enjoyed the pho, but still think Pho 87 edges then out, nevertheless, above average.  I even got one of my ""white boy"" co-worker hooked on pho here.  He was recovering from throat surgery and needed something easy going.  He always begs me to get pho each time I see him.  #awesomeness.  

Moreover, what sets this place apart from other pho joints is that it offers a lot more of a variety in their menu, not too mention they are more of a quality vs. speed eatery.  They appear to put a lot more love into their dishes compared to fast food, ""you eat and go home,"" pho spots.

However, it was kinda disappointing to learn that there their bun bo hue does not include pigs blood.  To most, this is a plus, but I'm that type of dude that appreciates the goods many tend shy away from.  The waiter explained that it's a health code violation to serve it.  Interesting to know.  Especially, since their are tons of ""violators"" out there if this is true.

Nevertheless, the bun bo hue was very tasty and I almost forgot that there was no cubed pigs blood.  It didn't come with the veggies however, but I guess since I was in a rush, I didn't stress it too much.  I also added a combo banh mi to go, but never got to savor it since I gave it to a hungry monster that kept nagging me...she knows who she is.

5620947,2015-07-09,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"I like their satay pho. Ate there and also to go them plenty of times but no more. Aside from the smell of the tobacco from next door,  the service is slow and has poor customer services.  Have to ask for spoons and for refills of water. Their regular pho was water down, bland and no favor whatsoever.  Their rice dish was dry and is not favorful. Their bun bo hue is nothing like the real bun bo (i guess it something & better than nothing). I only come pho satay cause it's different and unique. i called in to place a to go,  they forgot basil leaves and my satay (i always order pho satay, how can u eat it without satay on the side).  So i started to check my orders the next time when placed a to go. Happened again, asked the lady and she went in the back,   cameo out to handed me a half of an oz of satay for three large pho satay. I then asked for more satay, and she gave an oz container of satay...came home w half cooked rice noodle (banh pho). Ppl to go food home cause we don't want to cook, so i have to boil a pot of hot water to dip in all the rice noodles again.  I want to say i like this place still but the quality and how the customer services is now,  i will rather go eat Thai food or drive myself to pho Saigon 8, better pho and services aren't sloppy. I'm not being unreasonable,  this happens one too many times.  I used to worked at a pho place and this i see is unacceptable.",YlOaRF1YpOdvUtm4foQlaQ,1,0,2,7FFl-BuVTJ1gQEbhhcitUg

5651010,2013-06-20,0,5T0h9YCsXiDZyBsVIN9gcg,"This has got to be my favorite pho place.. Ever. There's something in their broth that make it so good and NOT taste like water unlike the other pho places in Chinatown. The serving is pretty much the same but the prices are probably $1 more than the other places around town, BUT it's worth it since it is much better tasting and much better quality food than the ones in Chinatown. 

I've never actually sat here and dined because I always ordered takeout instead, but the owner and his employees are super generous and they make you feel welcome right when you come into the store. They basically welcome you with a smile! Again, unlike the other pho places I've been to. In this restaurant, they're here to make sure you're a happy customer. 

Big plus: I don't have to drive aaaaalllllllll the way to Chinatown just to eat some alright tasting pho, but instead I can take a five minute drive to Viet Bistro! 

Only downside to this place is that there's a cigar place next door and you can really smell the stench of the cigars once you enter the restaurant :(

The strip mall location is busy and parking is tight during meal time. The restaurant is modest but the food packs a punch with YUMMY. I enjoyed my first lunch experience so much trying the Special Combination Pho and Thai Iced Tea that I have to return shortly thereafter for a piping hot bowl of Oxtail Pho.  The broth tasted so flavorful and the smell was so rich in fragrant.  The delicacy of the fresh Thai basil, lemon, bean sprouts and slices of jalapenos peppers added to the  Pho danced my mouth. The slow cooking meat was very tender and for an extra $2.75 you can add a great assortment of vegetables (not cabbage). The service is fast but count on the server speaking English. I tried the Ginger Iced Tea lemonade with Mint and it was crazy good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.",PqKT6qOR1s5wolJUSqPl2Q,1,2,5,Q1rRJO3u5qGScjqs6K6ZJA

When I saw a new Pho restaurant opening in our neck of the woods, I was ecstatic. We came for dinner on opening day, and the staff was the friendliest and attentive bunch...it was their grand opening after all. 

The menu has so many items that you don't see at a typical Vietnamese restaurant, and that alone will have me coming back.  But, we were there to try our usuals: Dac Biet, Bun, and Imperial Rolls.    (Shredded pork spring rolls and Soda Chanh are usually included on our list of regulars, but sadly- they didn't offer it on their menu.)  

The Dac Biet (Combination Pho) was average in my opinion.  My gold standard is the broth at Golden Deli in San Gabriel, CA.  It was good, but something was missing.  And looking back, I don't recall it having any tendon pieces, and the cilantro was minimal.  The meat serving was also not as plentiful one would expect for $8.50/ bowl. 

The Bun (Rice noodles with grilled shrimp and sliced pork) on the other hand, is a dish I will return for.  The veggies were fresh and plentiful, and the special sauce was delicious. Definitely worth the $8.50. 

The Imperial Rolls were also good, but again not the best I have ever tried. Since they didn't offer Soda Chanh, I ordered a Ginger Iced Tea Lemonade instead.  Unlike the previous reviewer, the ginger flavor was definitely overpowering and the drink was really sweet.  

Nonetheless, the rest of the menu is VERY intriguing- I will definitely be back to try one of those!! And you can bet, I'll back before the 20% off promotion ends on May 31st.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,1,0,3,y5boGyNUvXFSsb0JRrh5vw
