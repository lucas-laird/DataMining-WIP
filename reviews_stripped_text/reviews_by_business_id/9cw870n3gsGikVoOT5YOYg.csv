I now know why they chose the restaurant name to be ""pier"" 215 because seafood here is incredibly fresh! My chirashi bowl is like little jewel box with all these different color of diced up fish and tamago (egg) and micro greens. It was just delish!!! I also tried tempura which my friend ordered in deluxe combination from lunch menu. Tempura was very crispy with just right amount of coating of flour. 
The servers were very attentive, friendly and helpful with menu if you weren't sure what to order (because it's a lot to choose from), and even owner chef, Ted comes out to greet. Making me feel special :) 
The ambiance here is great for a cocktail after work or a party with friends or romantic dinner! Very ""pier"" like decor and color scheme take me right to the ocean.

234307,2017-03-10,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,Pier 215 is one of the best local restaurants in Vegas that I have tried so far. The concept of the food is unique and you can tell the chefs are delicate with their work. I went there for a holiday dinner and the place is cozy but still the service was top notch. Since we had a large party I was able to try a little bit of everything on the menu and it did not disappoint. My main course was the miso glazed salmon risotto and it is amazing! It does not get too greasy and had just enough cheese to make you devour the entire dish. I also tried the pork belly sampler and again grade A item. The seafood ythere; live or cooked were fresh and great quality. All of the servers were informative with their fushion dishes and took the time to explain each item to us.,-dFbueOxUbQR1n36kapO5Q,0,0,5,u_ifkmeLlEH8s6FJa8n8IA

The food is delicious and fresh, with a menu that is interesting and unexpected.  The chef trained with chef Nobu at Caesars, and also worked at Yellowtail at the Bellagio. His attention to detail and passion are demonstrated in both the quality and presentation.  The items are surprisingly affordable for the high quality you receive. 

I'd recommend the Lotus roll, Surf & turf roll, and the BLT roll. For something unique, try the plate of ""assorted Japanese pickles"", which is an assortment of awesomeness (pickles and pickled veggies) that you've probably never tried before.  There are apps, sashimi plates/dinners, very unique rolls as well as classics, and  full entrees also. 

This will definitely be our new spot and my go-to for celebrations with friends.

442124,2017-03-03,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,Service and food was more than expected. Highly recommend the Shigoku oysters. Opens up your appetite for the rest of your meal and was the best oysters I've had in awhile. Started with only a half a dozen and ended up ordering another 1/2 dozen before we closed the tab.  Cajun Shrimp vodka pasta was slightly on the salty side but that may be just a personal preference because I was the only one to notice. Hawaiian sushi roll was delicious. Garlic edamame was another great starter. Overall service was fantastic. Wish I had room to try dessert but we were stuffed and sated with everything else. Great place to watch  the sunset.

450505,2016-05-29,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"I passed by this place many times as it was being built and after finally seeing it open, I decided to drop in!

Atmosphere: Pier 215 did not disappoint. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very relaxed and welcoming. There is a slight breeze in the air that gives you the same chill youd get if you were actually on a pier by the ocean. Depending on where you're sitting, you also get a very decent strip view that adds to the welcoming feeling of the restaurant. Theres an open patio that isn't utilized yet, which gives the restaurant great potential for patio seating and adds more substance. 

Food: incredible. I ordered a traditional chicken teriyaki Roll and the flavor was incredibly well balanced. The meal didn't feel heavy like youd get at other places who use thick cooking materials. We also ordered the Hawaiian breeze roll and the salmon was incredibly well cooked w/ pineapple topping that added amazing flavor. The green tea and passion fruit teas are very smooth even without sugar and have great flavor. The menu was also well organized. There may be a picture menu available on request for those who desire photo menus. 

Customer service: definitely growing, but very acceptable. Given they've only been around for 2 weeks now, the customer service is going to feel those natural jitters and occasional growing points, but Max and the other staff handled everything perfectly with options, drink refills, and light conversation. After more time paases, I have no doubt that this place will have a great reputation for great service. 

Price: very fair! Some items may seem a little overpriced at first, but given the moderate portion sizes and quality overall, the prices actually seem very very fair. Don't judge a book by its cover until you order. 

Overall: 5/5 for sure. This place has amazing potential to be an amazing stop for the SW Las Vegas area and beyond. Furthermore, for writing this review (or any) the restaurant offers free Mochi dessert! For anything, come in for those too because they're so perfect with flavor.",2nYawktHtrfXncWowv82Jw,1,0,5,7dKA_dvBPfaYuOqR5A9QkQ

515446,2017-11-18,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"The decor, atmosphere and service here is outstanding and commendable. A+ in those details. This place has all of the trappings to be exceptional but is held back by a few strong factors regarding the menu and food. The menu, generally, is a touch overpriced despite many attractive offerings. The garlic chili edamame is very very good but the portion is simply far too small to justify the price. The rock shrimp appetizer is conceptually interesting but underwhelming because of too much batter, hiding, whether intended or not, the shrimp themselves. Further, the dish is topped with dried cherries that are clearly out of a supermarket bag. I suppose I would need to make more trips to have an informed opinion on the sashimi and sushi, but, in a city chalk full of exceptional and wide-ranging options in this arena, I would suspect they should invest in higher quality source ingredients because they seemed on par with good quality AYCE establishments - which this place is definitely not. Probably a good place for casual lunch to sample a roll or two or a sashimi offering, but you'd be better served to look elsewhere for higher quality offerings for the same prices.",bD6B4YitEjv-B5V9nDvBBg,0,0,3,hnR24_wiU23yPqzq-BbWeA

As for the food we decided to try a couple rolls and tapas. We tried the pier 215 roll, since other reviews suggested it, and it was really good especially the mango which added a nice sweet perk. We also tried the lotus roll which was like a cucumber salad in roll form and I suggest that one as a must try. We also had the mixed tempura which was delicious with a light flaky batter and really flavorful sauce. Lastly we tried the calamari which my boyfriend enjoyed but we both agree it was very chewy. Our server didn't realize that it wasn't brought out earlier and we did get there later in the evening (10 pm) so I think maybe they rushed to cook it, not sure but the dipping sauce had a great taste to it.

Got a ton of apologies but that's all. Ended up with half our party done by the time the other 2 entrees arrived.",mzW8zPbpF_NLXjC8LMbXSA,0,0,3,FSr5QkYo8z0CXV7TNgEe0A

The service here is absolutely amazing! The waiters know the menu front to back, they are very very very attentative to their customers, and they lighten up everyone's mood.

The oysters here are soooooo fresh. I recommend this place if you want some oysters. Their tappas dishes are also highly recommended if you want a lot of different dishes and flavors.

Now, for the bad news. Their sushi and rolls are not good and they made me and my family lose our appetite after a while. Their fish is actually not the issue. Actually their fish is super fresh (so in this case a cappacio or sashimi will be good). But the problem was their rice. I could not quite pin what type of rice they used, but it wasn't sushi rice. The rice was sooooo dry and it stuck to my teeth. The rice also tasted funky. I have no idea why their rice was so bad, but it definitely ruined my meal. Unless the rice is changed to quality sushi rice, I probably won't be returning to this place.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,15,7,3,9vMOSgX3HZUWCgXjwn4NxA

It's literally down the street from my house, which means I'll definitely become a regular.  All of our food was delicious and they did a great job with the decor and lighting.  We had the spicy Edamame which did come after my sashimi dinner and i wasn't thrilled about, but it tasted great so I could overlook the minor set back. First world problems lol All of the fish in my sashimi dinner was very fresh and they also had fresh pickled wasabi which is a huge deciding factor for me when distinguishing a quality sushi spot from not. The boyfriend had the pork belly which he loved, shishito peppers, agadashi tofu and soft shell crab. I tried everything but the pork and it was all equally as delish. The standout for me was the soft shell crab. Instead of tempura batter they used panko which made it so crispy and light. I think one of the best soft shell crab I've had yet. The GM Sam was also super cool and ensured we were happy with all from the beginning of our service and followed through until the very end. Even if you don't live in the hood it's worth the drive. I'm sure you'll visit the IKEA at some point so make a stop over to Pier 215 while you're there. We'll be back :)",kcIzgzkrnbY2mX0kYd0p3g,0,0,5,lm40DWJOeaGGMbaMQSy8wA

1110190,2017-08-03,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"This is a late review. I've been to this restaurant twice as the first time I really enjoyed the lunch menu. We ordered the kimchee fried rice and short rib. The kimchee fried rice was delicious and very savory. The short rib was full of flavor as well. The ambiance in regards to decor is very nice and modern but the music threw me off during lunch hour. I felt that I was at a pool day club with the EDM music blasting. Lol. We enjoyed lunch so much that we decided to go back for dinner. 
The dinner was a bit of a disappointment for me in one category and that was the lobster that I ordered. There was a sweet glaze to it that I felt overshadowed the natural sweet taste a fresh good lobster would have. I understand the desire to put a twist on a dish but for me it fell short. I had hoped the lobster would've been savory and not sweet. The sushi was fresh, simple and delicious. My boyfriend had the rib eye and it was tender and flavored well. 
The staff has always been very friendly and provide excellent customer service. I do believe the first time we dined there the waitress mentioned that one of the chefs was a chef from Nobu's which made me excited to know that information especially if you're a foodie. 
I wondered if they would be pumping the EDM at dinner and of course they stayed true to their music choice. This time it definitely set the mood to do some fist pumping on the strip after dinner.

The reason I didn't give this place five stars is because of the food, and let's be real, it's mostly about the food, right? Right. Although the miso glazed salmon risotto was buttery, creamy and flavorful, the other two sushi rolls we ordered were just blahh.

We were there during their reverse happy hour and didn't order anything from the discounted menu since it was pretty underwhelming as far as the food options.

I have to admit, the menu tends to overwhelm me a tad -- but the multiple genres of Japanese, Korean, American & Italian means that there's something for everyone here! This has grown to be a go-to GNO spot (since they offer a nice range of wines, beers sakes -- and a full bar!)... PRO TIP: Try to go around sunset & request a table with the view of the strip! It's also gorgeous at night. ;) 

Dubbed a ""sushi seafood grill,"" the chef Ted Jung (previously from Caesar's Palace NOBU & Bellagio's YELLOWTAIL) has impressive food presentation. And while sushi connoisseurs will appreciate his traditional fish preparations, he also creates outstanding Americanized rolls as well! The extensive tapas portion on the menu is also Japanese dominant (I've heard recommendations for the hamachi kama, spicy tuna and kimchi fried rice).

Aside from the sushi/sashimi, there is also a ""Raw Bar"" section, soup & salads, and rice bowls. The main dish house specials are honestly extremely random, but a very interesting assortment nonetheless.

Ordered the following: 
- BAKED CRAB ROLL: baked snow crab meat, shrimp, fried onion, avocado, cream cheese with soy wrap and creamy spicy sauce. (I highly recommend!)
- ANGRY LOBSTER ROLL: spicy lobster mix, masago, cucumber, avocado, soy paper and creamy spicy sauce. (Not too spicy, very good as well)
- SOFT SHELL CRAB: deep fried on top of sweet potato puree, served with a yummy dipping sauce
- PARMESAN CREAM SAUCE FETTUCCINE: I requested shrimp instead of chicken or fish -- and was charged $3.00. (Very basic classic, nothing noteworthy but very big portioned!)
- SHRIMP & SCALLOP TOBANYAKI: With assorted mushrooms and asparagus seared. (I would recommend ordering a side with this, smaller portioned but very good!)
- KIMCHI FRIED RICE W/ PORK BELLY: (Good amount for a side!)
- MACARON ICE CREAM SUNDAE: Choose two ice cream flavors & 3 macarons. (Perfect ending for the meal)
- PEACH/LYCHEE SAKE: Served about 12 shots. (Paired very well with the food!)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,5,3,4,lxjgqlKMwXVABO_TrujT5g

our first three rolls had already came out and had to wait to flag down our server to ask for saucers for our soysauce and the fresh wasabi that we ordered...while our baked roll was getting cold

ordered the udon which I'm guessing is microwaved since after our first udon the second one came out within less than 5 minutes from when we asked for another ..

after our premium sashimi platter finally came out I asked the server if our yellowtail collar is coming out soon she said that it should be done shortly she then went back to the kitchen  and reported back to us she had forgotten our collar, we still asked them to make it ..collar came out and it was not cooked, I had to get the attention of the hostess to ask for it to be cooked more, server came out and gave us the excuse that they cook all their collars medium but that she asked them to cook it throughly for us since we wanted it cooked all the way, but I had ordered it after I saw a picture on yelp which looked completely different then the one we got pale and pink inside..

We went to the restaurant expecting a lot more seeing that they boast that their chef is from Nobu but my opinion, just as it is important for the sushi to be good so does the whole experience...

I then had to get the attention of the hostess who was standing by the register chatting it away with whom looked like the owner to ask for a box and our check..a total of 3 times till I got my check processed..that I had to say loudly ""excuse me"" to the hostess multiple times..

Not to mention that the owner didn't even have the etiquette to come and apologize to us and walked right past our table..

1419333,2016-06-16,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Where to begin! Walking in we were greeted by Sam the GM of Pier 215 he's amazing! He sat down at the table and went over the entire menu with is highlighting a few items that make this restaurant special and boy was he spot on. 

   For starters we went with the octopus carpaccio (my absolute favorite) the truffle  oil was a nice touch and the octopus was extremely tender even better than milos octopus carpaccio. Next we tried the yellowtail jalapeño salsa but with kanpachi instead. The level of freshness of the seafood is commendable and it really shines though in flavor. We didn't go crazy with sauces to accompany our Kumamoto oysters but the wasabi salsa really stood out because like I said their freshness quality is a staple so of course it was fresh wasabi none of that generic powder so that was a plus. 
  
    Now on to the main dishes. The three of us each order an entree and shared a little because I have to try everything. Let's tart with the fettuccine Alfredo sign crispy white fish. Everything was seasoned perfectly the said was the perfect consistency and the fish was nicely crispy on the outside, most and tender on the outside. Definitely a rich dish so obviously on the heavy side perfect for sharing or a hearty meal. Next up I could resist the Asian style bouillabaisse with my love for all things French and Asian so this was right up my alley. I've read other reviews where maybe it wasn't enough seafood but my was jam packed with deliciousness there is definitely no skimping on quality seafood such as shrimp, crab, scallops, mussels & clams with just the perfect amount of mushrooms and bok Choy. When our server tried to clear the plates I wasn't ready to part with the broth once you get to the bottom every spoonful of broth is a jewel full of crab and other delights. 

   Last but not least was the kimchee fried rice let my start by saying the flavor was definitely there but I would have preferred nice cuts of pork belly on top with a fried egg but those are tedious observations. All in all the service is amazing definitely no quirks like most new business have. Sam is definitely an asset to the setting and the food as far as flavor and quality goes is superb. I definitely look forward to coming back and eating my way through the entire menu slowly but surely. Thanks to Pier 215 my gym membership will be put to use and all of my social media following will salivate over my continued foodie posts!",qLjNDw4Bl3ZgZ0fe8XbpwQ,3,1,5,ENo9nphi_ZKi2f3YNQTlOA

I see that the reviews for this restaurant are sort of all over the place so I assume that based on what you order, you will either love it or hate it. 

We mostly ordered from the tapas menu so I cannot speak for the rolls or sushi, but all the tapas we ordered were great. I think the prices matched as well when compared with similar Japanese tapas restaurants around town. I especially loved the beef tataki and the crispy pork belly. We also ordered the Asian bouillabaisse which has a really good broth and decent quality shellfish and ingredients, but I honestly thought was way too overpriced at $25.

The service was frequent, friendly, and helpful. The atmosphere was also very nice with good music in the background. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back again.",vHOyGH1kcLYURvwgdoSI9g,3,3,5,7PUAavc15mocYgpNI9Qh9A

Both were very good and was not the same as most restaurants. I ordered the fish and chips and Black tiger roll.

1598478,2018-05-24,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"I love this place! I love it. I wish I could give it 6 stars. 

First of all let me say that they sell tea here from a company called ""Republic of Tea"" and these teas are amazing. I've tried to buy them elsewhere but apparently they're only available to distributors in large-quantity orders. Next time I'm here I need to ask if they'll sell me a case of them. If you like tea, give these a shot. They have all kinds of flavors. 

My go-to meal here is the Fish & Chips. So well done. The batter outside is so crisp but not greasy or overcooked, and has good flavor but is not overpowering. The fish inside is tender and flaky, not dry at all, and is seasoned well. The fries are well-cooked and taste great. The tartar sauce is just right although I do wish they'd give me just a little more! I always seem to run out when I'm on my last piece of fish, and have to scrape the bowl for the last little bit. I love these fish & chips.

I've also had a few of their sushi rolls. Now let me say that I am not a big sushi person. The raw fish tastes fine, but I have problems with texture, so when I get rolls I always get rolls with baked or fried ingredients. I have had a few different rolls here, like the California roll and the BLT roll. All of the ones I have tried have been great.

For appetizer I usually go with the caprese salad. It's got gnocchi in it! Great salad. Delicious. If I were in the mood for just salad, I could have this and be totally set. My wife likes it too, and it's large enough that we can have one to share and I still have room for more, or we could eat it as a stand-alone meal.

The only thing I've had here that I would say is not 5-star is the quesadilla. The flour tortilla that they are made with is really over-powering. I taste more tortilla flavor than any of the ingredients inside. I would prefer a corn tortilla to be honest, but if I have to have flour they should find one with a milder flavor. No big deal though, because I've really settled on fish & chips every time I come here.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,0,0,5,7mP898w-nWGbJ3TgOcc-4g

The place wasn't busy for an early Saturday evening. We had reservations for 6:30, but didn't need them. There were only a couple other parties seated when we entered. We were greeted and seated promptly and our server introduced herself.

She mentioned cocktail hour, so we ordered a whiskey sour. It only had a splash of whiskey. Turns out, it was NOT cocktail hour. Knowing this, I got the Blissful Sakura anyway because it sounded good. It was tasty, but only had a hint of sake. I'm a light weight and don't like the taste of alcohol... And I liked the drinks. They don't put much alcohol in them.

My selection of oysters arrived and they were delicious. Crisp and sweet.

We then waited 30 minutes for our entrees. Our server had forgotten our shared appetizer. That's a really long wait, especially when there aren't very many parties seated.

At this point, I discovered that they had specials. I heard about them from the server at the table behind us and they sounded great, but too late. I do wish our server had told us about them.

When our dinners arrived, we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed. The server for the table behind us had been explaining each dish while ours didn't, so I asked him about one of the sashimi selections on my plate because it was just so good. So much so that I ended up ordering another one of those a la carte. (Something something yellowtail, not the regular yellowtail, although I'm sure that's good, too. It's translucent white with pink edges. Very, VERY good.)

We opted to skip dessert and when the check came, it was incorrect.

But this place doesn't give off a stuffy vibe either. I don't usually eat at the bar in a restaurant but it looked so inviting! Next time I think I'll sit there. 

The chefs/cooks have the most adorable uniforms! Ben, our server understood that we were just taking our time here to indulge in a few things. So he coursed our meal throughout the night. He was very knowledgable, professional and friendly. Sam, the general manager also checked up on us throughout to get feedback and ensured our satisfaction. 

The food was awesome. 
Pacific and Fanny Bay oysters were super fresh. The sauces were ok. I'd prefer a little spicier horseradish/cocktail sauce/ponzu. But that's just preference. 

OCTOPUS CARPACCIO omg this was the highlight of the night!! I could've ate like 10 plates of this...for reals! 

Beef Tataki was good. I'm glad I tried it but I could probably skip this dish next time around.

Rock Shrimp walnut salad was excellent! Perfect combo of flavors and textures. 

Crispy pork belly...oh so good!! I loved this dish a lot! The flavors were amazing! They were bite size which was great but just a tad too crispy....but it is ""crispy"" pork belly so I can't really complain there. 

Usuzukuri was clean and simple whitefish sashimi dish in a flavorful ponzu sauce and spicy grated daikon. This was a nice finish.

Also had the negi toro cut roll which is always amazing can't mess that up. 

But unfortunately we weren't fans of the BLT roll or the Flaming Ahi roll. 

I'm determined to try one of their specialty rolls that I could rave about! Sam did mention the Lotus Roll to be a favorite so maybe try that next.",FVRAb6vqzkPfr1DyM-8kGA,10,2,5,qpXjZ7ASBXUwa_e6HeEnkA

... And this was not the place for that! 

I ended up ordering their Pacific Oyster, Kumamoto Oyster, and the Kusshi oyster to start off, I've heard great things about their oysters and was ready to try them for myself until my friend stopped me and spotted an aquatic worm wriggling around in one of the oysters! I instantly called back the waiter and told him that i wanted to return the oysters as I wasn't comfortable eating them anymore, how could I?! The waiter then proceeds to apologize and claim that the worm was there due to the oysters being fresh, really now? I guess anytime I order something and it has a worm in it, then it must be fresh, lucky me. The owner then comes around and notifies me that they have removed the oysters from my tab, walks away, and shares a good laugh with the waiter. Well at least they're happy : - ) 

Moving on.

My group also ordered 
Seafood Ceviche: an assortment of shrimp/scallops topped off with a Lime garnish  
Miso Glazed Salmon Steak: 6oz Salmon steak on top of a brown rice risotto. 
Flaming Ahi Roll: seared Tuna, spicy tuna, asparagus, sliced jalapeno, w/ garlic ponzu sauce 
Kimchi Fried Rice
Sashimi Salad
 The Glazed Salmon was marinated perfectly, not too salty and didn't have a strong fish smell or taste, the brown rice risotto complimented it perfectly, bit too much sauce on the rice though, was a bit overwhelming. 
  Seafood Ceviche tasted was just average, refreshing, nothing bad about it but nothing worth bragging about either.  
The Flaming Ahi roll was below average, I don't understand how it's supposed to be ""Flaming"" when the heat level of the roll is equivalent to tabasco sauce. Couldn't really get much flavor from the tuna. Overall the roll was bland, boring, and I'm sure as far as rolls go, they have better options. 
   Kimchi fried rice here was very delicious, not overcooked, flavorful, and the kimchi taste wasn't overwhelming. Highly Recommended. Definitely the highlight of the meal 
    The Sashimi salad was beautifully presented, with taste to match. Fresh, but nothing amazing. 

All in all, due to the poor service and low quality food I will definitely not be returning anytime soon, Vegas still has better options as far as seafood goes, and I'd rather head over to Other Mama's for some fresh, Worm-Free Oysters !",H95BCWxTwwfHYfdTZooXvg,8,1,1,BH9fkqkzG4kPMpeV1MFXjw
1861087,2017-04-18,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"The atmosphere in the restaurant is excellent. Perfect place for a night out and the view is great. The menu, yelp and all these reviews definitely got our hopes up too high. For the price and the atmosphere we expected the food to live up to it. Items we ordered were the braised short ribs, the bouillabase, the baked crab roll, shrimp and walnut salad, hamachi kama, green tea creme brulee, and also the nutella crunch cake. 
My husband always tends to gear towards braised short ribs any chance he gets. So if its on a menu he'd order it. Of all the braised  short rib dishes we have tried this definitely was our least favorite. The presentation is a little lacking and the meat was on the dry side. The flavor was decent and tasted like korean bbq. But I guess we were looking for that succulent fall off the bone short rib and it just wasnt what we expected at all. 

Next we have the bouillabase... it was definitely not worth $27. Honestly it felt like some mixed seafood in a tomato soup. Presentation was a little lacking. I expected it to be a little more elegant. The flavors were fine but it didnt taste as special as I thought it would.

 The baked crab roll was great! It was my favorite part of the meal! My only complaint is that once it arrived I could already tell it wasn't made with premium sushi rice(round and fluffy. It was really good but couldve been better. 

The hamachi kama I dont really have any complaints. It was what I expected and what you would get at other places.

Walnut shrimp salad... the flavors were really good but it wasn't special. 

Then came dessert and we really enjoyed both the creme brulee and the nutella crunch cake. The creme brulee was perfect but the nutella crunch cake I expected it to have more nutella flavor, still good though. 

Overall... we had a really good time. Food was okay and service was spectacular.",YknDEVD19FYJc6jKnARlDw,0,0,4,hnlk5ukQdmDY--Lv99CT7w

1993558,2017-03-04,16,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Such pretty, photogenic dishes! I have been looking forward to going to Pier 215 for ages and finally made plans to go for a belated Valentines dinner with my guy. The location is nicely appointed and intimate, with twinkle lights and a great view. It's a date-night spot for sure. Menu is massive, something for everyone- and again, every dish comes out so beautifully. They really pay attention to plating, everything we had was so photogenic!

PANKO SOFT SHELL CRAB: I LOVE soft shell crab, and the presentation was fun on this one. But other than the actual crab, I didn't care for this dish. It's plated on pureed sweet potato, a flavor that failed to elevate or highlight the delicate crab flavors. And serving this with tartar sauce was also a bizarre choice that didn't really work. Maybe this would have benefitted from more of the honey-mustard instead.
GARLIC BUTTER SEARED TUNA: Gorgeous, light, flavorful. Really liked this dish, and BF compared it to the version served at another of our favorite izakaya style spots in town. Fish was fresh, flavors were bright and harmonious.
PAN ROASTED LITTLE NECK CLAMS: So conflicted! The mussels were huge and meaty, like the ones we had up in Canada. But the broth! It was so bland! That's supposed to be the highlight of a dish like this, and it needs to be served with a crusty bread to soak it up. This had so much potential! 
CLAM MUSHROOM MISO SOUP: One of the more traditional menu items. The miso was muted and the clams were nice, and there was additional tofu and seaweed as expected. But I didn't come across a single mushroom. 
SUSHI DINNER ($25): 10 pieces of nigiri + tuna roll. BF and I were in agreement that this was AYCE quality sushi. Fish was cut paper-thin, and several slices improperly. Half were cut against the grain, which kills the cell and destroys the flavor. These pieces were hard to chew and didn't highlight the buttery texture and fresh flavors of the fish. Very disappointing! Did we just get the sub-par remnants after they got slammed for the holiday? 
215 ROLL: Went with their namesake roll ($22), packed with several ingredients (lobster, soft shell crab, asparagus, mango, micro cilantro, tuna, salmon, avocado, den miso sauce). Again, it was a gorgeous dish. But it just didn't work. Throwing all your best ingredients into a single roll doesn't work if the flavors aren't balanced. There were bits of fruitiness from the mango and crunch from the asparagus, but the fish was not highlighted and the roll was overwhelmingly dry. My guy refused to eat more than two pieces, which is unheard of.

We were disappointed with our meal. Maybe I would have fared better ordering from the pasta dishes and grilled meats featured in their ""specialties"" section. The quality does not match the expectation set by the price point. You eat with your eyes first, so maybe that's where the extra star or two come from in some of these rave reviews.  

I plan to go back for the sashimi rice bowl for lunch and hope for a better experience. Maybe I'll return for their tapa and raw bar items, like the oysters and the octopus carpaccio. But as Rod U said, the fish quality is closer to AYCE than to the upscale caliber expected, unfortunately.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,19,3,TjCZo_iT9C51GBQQQnNf2g
1993823,2017-05-06,1,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Stopped by this place for an early dinner and was impressed. Nice location, modern and classy decor, great service and good good. We weren't very hungry so just wanted to share a few items, planning on coming back to try more items. 

We got half dozen kumamoto oysters and boy were those good! Cute presentation, served ice cold, 4 different types of sauces you can mix and match, the oysters were sweet and crunchy, awesome start to the meal. We also got sweet garlic chili edamame which I thought was too salty, too much sauce on top but nice flavor. Fried oysters was ok, batter a little too thick but their tartar sauce was really good, I usually hate tartar sauce but theirs were not to spicy and has a nice soft sweetness to it. 

We got the steak tobanyaki which was really good, but really small for $29, although the meat was really tender, awesome flavors, even the mushroom, asparagus and veggies on the plate were really sweet and delicious. We go the sushi dinner which was good, came with a bowl of rice. We also got the Hawaiian Breeze roll which was pretty good, a little small for the price but was tasty. 

Overall really enjoyed the meal, they have some interesting items, price is not too crazy spicy. I love the overall feel of the place, very attentive and great service but not uptight. Will definitely come back to try more items.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,1,4,t1Xt_K5Yr0_CcH_UlP1kRQ
1994015,2016-10-15,2,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Not sure if they changed chefs, but something's different. Ever since my first visit, I've ordered the Asian Style Bouillabaisse. The first few times it was AHMAZING! 10 out of 10. But the last two times, it's been meh. Maybe 6.5 out of 10. A lot less flavor, kind of bland, and not as much broth. Heartbreaking!

The octopus carpaccio is still really good, that hasn't changed. And the Kim Chee fried rice is a tad on the sweet side, but also very good.

I've noticed a change in staff as well. We used to see the same faces when we came in, but the past two times it seemed like a lot of new staff. Not sure if this has anything to do with the fall of the Bouillabaisse, but whatever has caused this change, I hope it gets fixed and soon.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,6,1,3,RVSnAtbfiXoaQYjIyKvcnQ

That's the only good thing I can say about it. We were seated pretty quickly. They were out of most of the oysters, which was ok (at the time). Then we ordered the rest of our food: fried pork belly appetizer, chicken Katsu with a side of onion rings, and short ribs. 

After waiting 20 minutes... The onion rings came out (starting to get annoyed). Then a random server comes out and says they're out of pork belly (still no oysters). I told him were done. (So they were out of 1/2 the oyster, some of the entrees, and the pork belly- on a Saturday night) 

We stopped to pay for our drinks, and they tried to explain that the reason the service was so bad, was because the oysters take a long time (seriously, you crack them open and put them on ice), I should've explained to the manager the principles of supply management, because he clearly can't read a spreadsheet (otherwise he would've ordered enough oysters and pork belly).

The outside signage is nice and big and... even reminds me of something I would see in Southern California off the beach. Love that vibe!  However, when you look at the door area, it appears closed.  Luckily my friend had already warned me of this.

The Hostess was welcoming and friendly. Sweet with a smile on her face. Nice!

Server was friendly as well, happy to serve us!  

Restaurant decor was cool!  Very hip and fun!  What was not fun was those middle dangling lights flickering and blinking!  Fail! 

Food wise: So, so, soooo disappointing. Had high hopes and it felt like a Nobu wannabe. They kept dropping the Nobu name...like the Chef/Owner is from Nobu. Bottom line, you're not Nobu!!  I would go as far as to say the fish was bad. My scallop sashimi smelled.  From the moment our server dropped it off till it sat on our table...YUCK!  So fishy smelling and mushy. Nasty!  The taste of our Octopus Carpaccio did mimic the taste of sauce from Nobu, so we liked that, even if it was a copycat. The weird thing was the temperature of the fish.  Everything was room temperature.  Not used to this.  Usually fish has some slight chill to it.  Strange.  

Based on this experience, we won't be making a special trip here or dining here again.  There are too many competitors out there with better quality food out there.",5-tJGiBjYaHP0zou0Pq64Q,0,0,3,F1qt7X3wH3M0DNQWKsRwVQ

We tried a few special rolls and a few simple rolls I don't like all that sauced up baked rolls drizzled with mayo stuff I want quality fish and simple maki style rolls. We had a large party so we were able to try a variety of items. The oysters looked good but they tasted horrible it left a bad after taste. The sushi was worst than grocery store sushi. Nothing was good about this place I can go on and on but bottom line if you KNOW sushi and like quality sushi I wouldn't dine here. First & last!,WgbocVhRcRXHwVyi9kfI4w,1,0,1,FNtIggHFqWo3sws1lHMk9Q

Very friendly welcome! Not only was the server great but the others that brought our food made further great recommendations and one of the other gentleman was talking sports to my son which was great!

My husband swears by the Lotus Roll, one of the best he's had! Perfect combo of taste & texture.  Hawaiian Breeze and Yellowtail Serrano Roll also very delicious. 

Kids enjoyed their simple shrimp tempura, California roll and beef rice bowl so glad they have something for everyone. Kids were happy so I am happy!

I ordered from the lunch menu and it ended up being a ton of food. I received soup, many pieces of sushi, sashimi salad, a roll and a tempura bowl for a reasonable price. Top it off with a fresh cold Sappora beer and I was in heaven. Fat AF but in heaven.

2304017,2017-01-09,14,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Talk about a nice little hidden gem. Pier 215 totally hits the mark although 300 plus reviews later that boat might have sailed. It was my first time so I was throughly impressed from the moment walked into the restaurant. I came with Ohana celebrate Christmas Day dinner together. If random star worthy just being open on Christmas Day deserves one. The last place anyone wants deal with is going out to dinner is anywhere on the strip. Sorry got off topic. Lol.

My brother made reservations although that night could have walked in be fine. The inside decor right off back really like. The whole vibe from the open kitchen, love all the wooden tables and chairs, little sushi bar area, and really feels like eating at high end fancy restaurant on the strip. Throw in some holiday spirit with christmas tree all decorated when you walk in. Awesome first impression.

The menu has a  really nice diversity. I really like the whole section for fresh oysters, They have nice deep selection believe saw ten different types that offered. Not sure if they are based on seasonal. We order half dozen of assorted ones. Forget the ones we got. Everyone tasted extremely fresh! The sauce compliment was unreal good! I love fresh oyster but living in the dessert really not lot of places trust ordering them period. The udon noodle soup caught me eye so got ordered for my own appetizer. It was actually bigger portion then I imagine. It between more entree size then cup or bowl size soup appetizer. The broth was AMAZING. Not too mention the udon noodles. The perfect way start menu with this winter weather. My entree got the Braised Beef Short Ribs. Talk about LOT of short ribs. I was little surprise because thinking the whole high end concept portion size usually tiny. So much meat actually had hard time finishing the whole dish. The sauce was super tasty, the meat most, and the roasted root vegetables was the bomb. Definitely dish would recommend. My brother and sister-in-law both ordered the bouillabaisse. The presentation was seriously artwork. Again I was shock at the portion size or the amount of shellfish in the bowl. It literally was packed. My nieces ordered the chicken katsu. Another great looking dish. We ordered couple different speciality rolls all on point. Not single dish not on point. 

The prices overall close to fine dining. Some items not that bad but still lot more reasonable then going high end asian fusion restaurant on the strip. I guess two of the chefs came from Nobu so the presentations are all high end look but not the high end price. Just keep it real still not cheap place to dine but think about it steal of deal. 

The service no doubt five stars. Our waiter was very engaging, friendly, stayed on top of everything, and us being first timers explained everything perfect along with some great recommendations.

First - the building is beautiful. Elevated ceilings. Brand new building. Clean and very nice restaurant. Elevated Windows all throughout that give great views of the mountains. 

The staff is very attentive and friendly. Had two servers serve us at the same time which was great.

The price on the dishes a still a little high for what you get in size and meat.


We order a few dishes off the happy hour.
The spicy pork quesadilla, rock shrimp, ceviche, spicy tuna with crispy rice. All the dishes were good and had great flavor.

We ordered:

Seaweed salad - really good

Black Tiger roll - Really good

Surf and Turf roll - My favorite

BLT Roll - very good flavor

Hawaiian Breeze - Really good

Beef Tatiki roll - Not good - skimmed meat! No fish!

Seared Tuna- ok

Lobster Madness - Way too much rice!! 

Nutella Crunch - Bomb!

Sundae - Ok

2420483,2016-06-30,13,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Unfortunately I have to update my review on this place to a 1 star.

For a fine dining establishment I was very disappointed in both the owner and our meal.

The first time I came here was really good so I expected to bring some friends here to share my experience instead of embarrassment and disgust.

We ordered fresh oysters, the ceviche, a couple rolls, the kimchee fried rice, grilled salmon, and sashimi salad. When our orders first came out we all started to snapchat our beautifully garnished meals, and as soon as one of my friends picked up an oyster I had to stop him.

Why?? Because I saw an aquatic worm swimming around in it!!!
It was disgusting and made our entire meal feel kinda scary to touch. When we told our waiter he went back to the owner and they all had a good laugh at our disgust, later he came over and apologized and said its because their oysters are fresh.

What a horrible excuse. I don't tell people e. Coli is normal for fresh chicken, how ignorant. Did he try to make any amend for the worm? No. He said he could bring out new oysters or let us order something else.

He didn't offer to compensate anything, or even offer a discount or nothing. Wow. It sure didn't feel like he was he owner, just felt like he was cheap and wanted us to spend more on worms and stomach problems.. 

I have to give this place 1 stars from my previous 4 star recommendation, I don't think I will ever return or recommend here again other than to warn others about the first live worm I ever found in a fine dining restaurant.

I'll stick to other mama or sf for fresh oysters, worm free.

No thank you pier 215. I regret giving you guys a 17% tip that day, I felt I was tipping the worm..

2452441,2017-06-26,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"So some friends of mine asked me to go and try Pier 215 with them. This establishment looked very intriguing based upon menu selection and Decour so I was excited to try it for the first time. My friends and I went for happy hour on Monday which is Industry night. Our luck the server we had was new and inexperienced on menu items. The server actually started off by saying that they are a Asian Italian Japanese infused cuisine. We basically tried everything on the happy hour menu. Most of our questions could not be answered by the server on the spot and the server had to check multiple times with the chef. For example the type of oysters provided and type of fish in ceviche. So let's start there. The ceviche was served on endive lettuce With a fresh mix of salmon , tuna and, octopus. Flavoring was prefect highly recommend this app! Chef's oysters although labeled as Blue points felt like was got Kumamoto because of the mild brininess. Didn't really care for the oysters due to the flavor. If you want something that will spark your appetite get the sweet garlic chili edamame. This edamame has some good flavor and isn't over powering. The California roll is not a standard thing I order but none the less it got ordered. So as for the California roll I've had better. The rice was under cooked and to large of a grain for sushi. The salmon was thinly slice all the other ingredients where large in portion, overall the roll was very bland. Spicy pork quesadilla The chef changed the pork out for my group to chicken seemed like the flavors would pair better with the pork - two slices this app seems small for the value. The beer battered cod was delicious perfectly fried and the cod was moist the french fries were also prepared perfectly. The fried zucchini had a nice Panko Breading on it I guess this is where the Italian influence comes in. Overall I don't think I'd visit here anytime soon due to multiple options in the area based on Japanese, Italian, or Asian cuisine. Specially if I had to pay normal dinner prices, so make sure if you were going to give this Pier 215 a shot go during happy hour.",veB1LASyJHV14tHVjhauJQ,0,0,3,Np_6PMYGGBA0p0ZyM6lVqQ

The wife and I were researching on Yelp for a nice new sushi place we haven't tried yet and this won the search, after perusing the nice pictures fellow Yelpers added. We did see there were drink specials Sunday through Thursday in case a Happy Hour is in your future.

We began with some water and a couple signature cocktails: The Confused One and the Piers View both delicious and refreshing. To start we ordered the Yellowtail jalapeno salsa with micro cilantro and ponzu sauce 5/5. Great tasting even if you don't like raw fish.

Oysters seem to be calling the wife's name so we sampled a few of the Kumamoto oysters with horseradish, Tabasco and vinegar 5/5, very fresh. I had to try a few salmon nigiri which are always good. Then we tried the crunchy roll which was unique with the tiny crunch balls atop the delicious roll 5/5. Time for another signature cocktail, the Blissful Sakura, again very delicious. For the entree we shared the Pan Seared Scallop served atop brown rice risotto, very filling and prepared well 4/5 (would have been 5/5 but the last scallop was a bit sandy). The risk you take when enjoying shellfish. 

For dessert, I thought we had enough room for two; so we ordered the Crispy Cheese Cake and the Nutella Crunch Cake. The deep fried cheesecake came out first and hit the ball out of the park! This was so good I wish we ordered two! A definite 5/5. The Nutella came shortly after and lacked the ""crunch"" in its name and tasted more like chocolate cake than Nutella (coming from Europe we LOVE Nutella). A miss on this one, stick to the deep fried goodness!

Sean was a great server, very attentive and made good suggestions. Will be back again, found a new date night spot.",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,10,9,5,FkILyuFgdZf792XWGqdduQ

After having this place bookmarked for quite some time, we finally stopped by while driving in the area.  The restaurant was clean and the large windows gave plenty of nice, natural lighting to the nicely decorated, dark decor.   Not crowded at all, we were delighted to see there was a happy hour going on and we were seated very quickly.

Off the HH menu, we ordered the corkscrew shrimp and a half-dozen oysters.  At $1 a piece, the oysters were fresh and tasty.   Accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemon, and horseradish, I enjoyed the slightly briny oysters and could have ate more.   The corkscrew shrimp, with its mildly-hot sauce, was a good appetizer.  

My wife had a brown rice risotto with cooked salmon.  The fish was cooked to your liking and the risotto was your standard version, nothing extraordinary, but good.  I had the 215 roll.  It came with a plethora of fillings and toppings which included salmon, tuna, yellowtail, softshell crab, lobster, mango, avocado, and yuzu truffle.    The plating and presentation was nice.   I didn't think the flavors nearly matched how it looked though.   It's possible there was just too much contrasting items that you could not really pick our or enjoy each individual flavor.

Beyond that, my daughter had a Philadelphia roll, gyoza, and truffle fries which were pretty good.

Our server was a little soft-spoken, almost hard to hear at times.   It also took way too long to get our check, give the credit card, and get the copy back for signature.  Especially when there was maybe only one other group dining in at the time.    Beyond that, no real problems.

My kids got the fried rice with steak and we had to order another one because they DEVOURED the first one (which they never do)... worth a try and worth reviewing on yelp!

They brought the food out lightening fast! So fast in fact that we nearly didn't have room on the table between the plates and glasses! The rolls were outstanding! The poke was great, although a little over priced. We ordered my daughter the teriyaki chicken bowl and it was huge! Completely worth the $8. The wait staff was amazing. They were polite, prompt, and really helpful. Odd compliment but the chairs are really comfortable. I hate eating dinner sitting in a chair that looks nice but sucks to spend an hour sitting on.

2802639,2017-08-13,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"I had high hopes for this place seeing the reviews and I thought at first maybe my expectations were set too high while in the midst of the train wreck but no. His place is just bad-bad. Not one bad but two bads. First it was my wife and my two small kids. We made a res on open table and sat pretty quickly and had a drink order taken pretty quickly. When drinks were brought we out in for our kids' food and an appetizer (chicken bowl and wings). Then we wait... about 20min later we had a couple people ask if we had our order taken, which we tell them no, and they went to go find a server. Finally the ""manager?"" Comes by to take our order and one of the severs take over. After we take our order we ask about the kids' meal and the app. Seems like hey forgot about both...

20min later we get part of our ""sushi"" (garlic/butter tuna and a roll). The""tuna"" was just 6pcs tuna tataki with jap mayo sauce on it.  This was total lipstick on a pig. Dish was NOT a $14 dish and the roll was probably 4 total pcs of nigiri worth of fish... then 10-15min after the sushi dinner comes out. Such a let down THEN we get the kids' chicken  teriyaki bowl. (Insert Jackie Chan meme of WTF face). We then ask about the wings... and of course they say they're on the way. Mind you this place was MORE THAN HALF EMPTY when this train wreck was happening and a couple other tables next to us were getting orders placed and food deliver d before we ordered. 

Review of the food. Sushi reminds me of end of the week sushi buffet fish. The sushi rice was overly sweet like you'd find at a Korean restaurant for Kim-Bap. Chicken wings still have feathers on them but that somehow justifies $10 for 5 wings. Do added feathers cost more? The salmon had the stringy sinew attached as did the ""sweet shrimp sushi"". I couldn't find a positive on this place especially given that yelp had 4.5 stars on it. I KNOW there are good sushi places around here. Makes me wonder who is dining here to rate it so high?  Gutter palettes? 

Summary. This place reminds me of when Korean sushi owners opened terrible sushi restaurants in the 90's and cut every corner possible...",5R9VJ0GDts6-w8WAv5iD9g,0,0,1,iKLFa4cgQynrsry19EDh4A

It was smooth and had a very rounded flavor. We got two of each oyster, but my favorite by far was the Kumamotos. The wasabi salsa was EVERYTHING!!! I don't normally like wasabi, but the salsa was fire. They used fresh wasabi. I literally could eat it by itself. SOOOO BOMB! The Assorted Japanese pickles were tasty, as well as the crispy rice with spicy tuna. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the 215 roll. It just reminded me of a donut.

Everything that we had for dinner from the oysters, sushi rolls, kimchi inspired soup and the risotto, my words alone cannot do it justice so I will upload photos soon ;)

I can't write about Pier 215 without mentioning the interior. It's a perfect place for a small business dinner or date. From the moment you step inside there is dim lighting that is done by low hanging lightbulbs in the center of the dining room. The corners of the restaurant has neat decorations like a small lighthouse, baskets full of decor and more. The decorations really ties in the place together.

The oysters were smaller than the ones I'm used to but I can't stress enough about the freshness and quality. They were amazing and I'm not even a big oyster fan. My favorite by far was the salmon risotto. I was very impressed by the risotto and the sauce.

Like I said, it's all a la carte so don't expect a small penny for your meal. It'll cost you but in my opinion it's worth it. I just love the level of quality you can literally taste as opposed to regular ayce sushi. Will definitely visit again.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,1,5,RjdxK8o0BH6zYMB3vGYcZA

Uni nigiri
Flaming ahi roll
Amberjack uni special
2 large asahi

Some of the oysters we had we not properly shucked.  I had pieces of broken shell on top of my oyster.  And 2 of the oysters looked like the person was ate half of it.  Uni was good, but at $6 per piece of nigiri, I wouldn't order it again.  Flaming ahi roll was ok, but there was something in the roll that made the whole thing taste a bit weird.  There was a bitter flavor.  Yellowtail jalapeno salsa was the best thing there.  I really enjoyed it.  Don't think I'll be going back.

It is at a nice location on the southwest side of Las Vegas in a new commercial development. I found them through Yelp and put it on our list of restaurants to choose from when we are having a hard time deciding. So, Thursday night, I brought this place up. 

The atmosphere and decor on the inside is very nice. The kitchen is open to see and the restaurant is not very large. It is the perfect size and can accommodate some larger parties. Once complaint about the atmosphere is that all the windows face West which brings glaring sun in the afternoon. They have some solar shades that come down but they do not quite handle the issue. The second complaint about the environment is the music. It is very loud. It made it difficult to carry on a conversation. 

We ordered some sushi and teriyaki bowls. I did not bring the most adventurous eaters here and may have to rethink my guests in the future. But everything was fresh and delicious. For a teriyaki bowl, it was very impressive and the serving size was generous. I ordered the vegetable tempura and it was phenomenal. Crispy and flavorful. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. We had a crunchy roll which was very good as well. 

I definitely plan to visit this place again soon. For the three of us, it was $62.00 with two cocktails on the bill. We ordered very carefully but it can be pricey if you do not play the menu right.",kmXn7iEJWGDGbWUiEmZ_kA,0,0,4,jggdWBf4mWOvTqyVXTqpaQ

Came here Friday night around 7. Made a reservation through Yelp thinking this place would be packed since it's hot new business on Yelp, plus Daisy Carnival weekends. When I got here, I saw a lot of open tables. I guess I didn't need the reservation but it's better to be safe than sorry.

Octopus carpaccio... Delicious ponzu and olive oil flavor. It was gone in 5 seconds between two of us.

Shrimp scallop tobanyaki... Perfect. The scallops were very tender. Melted in my mouth. Came with shimeji mushroom an asparagus. 

Hamachi kama... I've never seen hamachi kama this huge in my life. Two big pieces of kama. It was in tapas menu so I was thinking smaller portion. This is a meal itself. I know it's previously frozen, but tasted super fresh. 

Kusshi oysters... Very fresh and sweet! The best oysters I've had in Vegas! I liked the wasabi salsa. I would've liked to try all the four sauces...

Sushi and rainbow rolls... Sorry but just like you would get in any AYCE place in town. I've had better sushi in AYCE. Nothing special. Rice tasted OK to me, just regular sushi rice with vinegar. Why can't they make my sushi with brown rice? They have brown rice on the menu. ""I LOVE SUSHI"" in Anthem makes brown rice sushi. They could've cut the fish a little more thicker...

Yes, the view is very nice from the dining area. Not a view you'd find just anywhere in Vegas. Plus the service was very good. The waiter was prompt, knowledgeable and friendly as was the rest of the staff. Great teamwork. 

I liked giving their raw oysters a try. You can mix and match as you please. My favorite was the Kumamoto oysters. Just delicious and super fresh. The sashimi bowl lunch special had a good variety of sashimi pieces. Mine included mackerel, salmon, yellowtail , octopus, salmon roe, and sweet egg cut into square bites. My only dislike was that the rice was super hot which is fine normally for a hot dish but not ideal when it's the bed for sashimi. Usually sushi rice is supposed to be cooled/fanned a little prior to placing the sliced sashimi on top of it just because the heat of the rice heats up the sashimi which isn't good. I think it may have been because we came in 15 minutes after they had opened. I don't think they had time to cool the rice. We noticed the same thing with the a la carte sushi that we ordered. Again, the quality of the fish was great but the hot rice made the fish warm and took away from the experience a bit. 

I know this place is new, so my one little dislike isn't that big of a deal. I'd definitely come back to try out there other dishes.",ga_05brEylDLIabc3lZOgA,4,2,4,RfJBcKKVuful0I_zN2UrMQ

First thing we ordered were the oysters and from the first bite we had a idea that this was going to be a bad experience. Fresh oysters are a must and these were nothing but subpar. The ceviche was too fishy to eat. Ikira with quail egg wasn't great. After that we had a simple tuna and albacore sushi I took one bite of the tuna and that was it. If you are going to serve raw fish please make sure it is FRESH! We even asked the server to try to show him that we are not just saying that to eat for free he refused. When we send back the remainder of the food they still wanted to charge us. And then the cashier ""manager"" on duty told us she couldn't do anything she needed to call the owner. Where at that point the owner on the phone asked what gender were we. Strange ? Odd? Then proceeded to give us 15% off. YAY. Do not be fooled by the yelp reviews for this place.

Came here for dinner, did not know what to expect. Menu was kinda busy and scattered but every page was filled with deliciousness. 

 We started with the Oysters, so fresh so good, we had a dozen of the Japanese Kusshi Oysters, they also had the Kumomoto and BC's Fanny Bay Oysters. Our server let us try all 4 sauces they have for the Oysters, the ponzu was good the wasbi salsa was my favorite, however the Oysters tasted so fresh and buttery it was almost a sin to add anything else to them. 

We then had an assortment of Sushi and Sashimi. The Yellowtail salsa Sashimi was melt in your mouth so damn good I recommend you get that dish. The rest was various types of Nigeri, all was good and fresh favourite of the Nigiri was the Chutoro. 

Much more I want to and will try out here in the future. My only recommendation to management I can give, is please add an IPA to your Beer menu preferably a local one or at least the common Stone/lagunitas IPA. As summer approaches there's not many better pairings then Fresh shucked Oysters and an IPA on a Hot Summer day! Wish you all at Pier 215 much success! Welcome to the Neighbourhood!

Three words that describe our experience at Pier 215 last night. The General Manager - Sam - was awesome! He gave us a VIP treatment that made the night unforgettable. All his recommendations were spot-on. You can tell there is a lot of passion, heart, and soul that was put into creating Pier 215. 

Ambiance: Right when you walk in, you're greeted by a very sweet hostess. The vibe is hip and fun. The place was busy on a Saturday night with large and small groups dining. The restaurant has an open kitchen concept is unique. You get to see the chef's cook in a clean kitchen (which is always a plus). There's also a sushi bar people can take advantage of. The service here was phenomenal! The staff does a phenomenal job at being mindful of the needs of each table. 

Food: INCREDIBLE food. We had the following dishes: 

Kim Chi Fried Rice: Must try and authentic made by a talented Korean Top Chef. 
Pork Belly Appetizer - perfect balance of tender meat and juicy fat that's been cooked for 18+ hours. 
Yellowtail Salsa: This dish is full of flavor and the fish just melts in your mouth. 
Uni Shooter: Interesting experience. If you like Uni then try it with a shot of Sake. :-) 
Sushi Dinner: Rice was impeccable. Fish was fresh and tasty. Excellent quality for the price! 
Asian Style Bouillabaisse: Really enjoyed the taste of the soup mixed with the seafood. 
Calamari appetizer: Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The dipping sauce really enhances the dish.
Green tea, Plum Wine and Vanilla Ice Cream: Savory treat. The Plum wine was the best! 

Price: It's reasonably priced for the quality of the food. There's two chef's that used to work at Nobu and Yellowtail. The food supply is also from there so if you want to enjoy a fine dining experience without breaking the bank, then this is your place! 

Pier 215 is a must try. I highly recommend it! Be sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekends. :-)",kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw,3,3,5,CFcYHFPXfWjdDzXrdej0UQ

Not only that, when we called the next day to inform them, the girl who answered took down our information and said somebody would call us back, but nobody did.

Had a simple spicy crab roll that was also delicious and fulfilling . We also shared a Philadelphia roll with jalapeño-choice! My wife had the specialty baked crab roll...this thing stole the cake. It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Atmosphere is great for dates, and anyone really. Glad it's finally open.

First, the overall vibe of the restaurant was very modern and chic. I certainly want to give them the credit for their sense in  restaurant interior. We were seated right away by the hostess, and our server greeted us promtly. The service overall was on point. 

However, their food did not meet my expectations at all. Their ceviche was not cold, and it did not have the classic flavor that I have had before. Their salmon skin salad was very bland. The server mentioned that the chefs were from Nobu. I did not see any quality of Nobu from this restaurant's menu. Maybe it's because I didn't try anything from their signature menu page, but I doubt I good they can be when the basics of a Japanese restaurant menu is not satisfying ( at least to me). 

Their price is definitely a little above average from similar businesses around them. Their menu seems to overlap a lot with other local restaurants, but prices are more of strip restaurants.

We had a beautiful table in the corner with the windows around us. We were sat and waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came up to ask for the drink order. So not a great start but whatever. We waited about another 10 minutes or more till we finally got our drinks. So long story short we waited and waited and waited for just about everything besides our main dishes after we had complained. Come to find out our waiter was new, it was his first day. So if we have known that from the beginning things would have gone much more smooth and understanding! My father has worked in fine dinning restaurants his whole life. So being his daughter and having my mother with me, we know what good service is vs. bad service. The food was amazing! Absolutely delicious! I highly recommend going to check this place out! The manager on staff that night was great, I can't remember her name but she took great care of us at the end. I don't like complaining but hopefully this helps just to make sure costumer service runs a little bit better. I will definitely come back and enjoy this place again!

The location is great with views that stretch on for a distance (get a window seat if you can). The interior is trendy and very clean. The service is fantastic, with quick attention to every detail.

The food was delicious. We started with a Caprese Salad. What a great way to start lunch. The salad was flavorful and the dumplings added not only a unique flavor, but a nice temperature contrast as well. I could have had just this for lunch and been very happy.

We got a side order of the truffle fries, these were HOT when they hit the table. It was hard to wait for them to cool down as they tasted sooooo good. 

I had the Combination Beef Teriyaki Lunch with brown rice. The flavors popped. The tempura vegetables were cooked well and made a nice side. The house salad that came with the meal was delicious. I can honestly say eating salads is normally not my thing, but the salads here had flavor!

The hostess was welcoming and polite, seating me at a corner table with comfortable high-back chairs.  The atmosphere was comfortable and elegant with dark wood punctuated with ivory upholstered chairs strategically set up along the windows.  Since it was early in the evening, the shade were, thankfully, drawn.
My friend and I both got ""the confused one"" cocktail...lovely and refreshing on a warm summer night....the four stars is because the were out of peach puree so all cocktails including it were unavailable.  Our cocktail had a blend of pineapple juice with apple sake and a hint of mint...absolutely refreshing and not too sweet!!
We got 4 different sushi rolls, fried rice with egg, and sweet and sour chicken wings....not knowing portion sizes, we told our server that this was ""to start""...everything was absolutely perfect and delicious!!  portion sizes were HUGE!!  we couldn't finish all we had ordered and turned down our opportunity for dessert because we were so full!!
Serrano Tuna Roll, Crunchy Roll, BLT Roll, and 215 Roll were all delicious - fried rice was absolutely the best I've had in Las Vegas - full of flavor and moist!!  Chicken wings were glazed in a sweet and spicy sauce, sprinkled with peanuts and a bit of green onion...served piping hot, fried crisp without any batter or breading, just delicious!!
I will be certain to visit again - maybe trying some of the Italian dinner choices and maybe having sushi again - I just know I will be back!!!!",zjQzH2DyOULp2KpO0Yp1Wg,0,0,4,8A_R7rQbFM6S58VWadF4sA

4220379,2016-06-20,1,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Giving Pier 215 2 stars just breaks my heart, but unfortunately it's exactly how it is. Now mind you, I went to this restaurant TWICE. Went to dinner with my friend then went back the next night to take my parents and husband.  If I hadn't gone the next night with my parents I wouldn't have given them 2 stars. I would have given them 5 stars all the way. HOWEVER, the service on my second night- which counted the most to me because I was with my parents and husband was so awful it dropped them to 2 stars.

The second night dinner, they served appetizers at a decent pace. But it was the entree service where everything just dropped in service and food! They served my dad's fish and chips first and literally from that point on everyone else's entrees was served a pain staking 10 minutes later, and no still not at once! I mean next entree was served 10 minutes, then the next 10 minutes the next entree and the next 10 minutes and finally my entree which was scallops risotto came. Ruined the mood, as I felt like my dad had already finished his mean and I barely started. Also my husband ordered the braise short ribs and again, server forgot his rice! We sat there 5 minutes trying to find her and figuring out where the rice was.

The server didn't check up on us and she did say the dishes were delayed but no, it was beyond delayed. Who is expediting? They can't time our food correctly? Also where was the GM? I saw him walking around, and not even an Hello or kitchen explanation on the delayed food. So disappointing!

Food was great, no doubt. But the short ribs were tough. Definitely expected it to be much more tender.

So disappointed at this place. I had a fantastic first experience and it was flawless from service to food, but unfortunately literally the next day I dined here it was night and day. As if they all just give you that dog and pony show the first night only to trick you to come in next time to have the worst service ever!!

They could've done better. Especially when they set that standard for me the first night, you best your ass I am pissed when you barely even delivered the next night.

And then you are either pleasantly surprised or just think..yep, I knew it. Well, this was a ""yep I knew it"" type of place. Nice presentation and good service can't hide the poor quality and execution. We had the 215 roll, which was very strange. Fruit and fish and strange sauce and asparagus, doesn't work at all. All the sashimi btw was stringy, not cut well, very thin and AYCE quality..including the Sushi dinner. I guess the clam and mushroom miso soup was pretty good, but there was no mushrooms, also strange.  Had a few other things that were ok.

Service was good. Cleared plates as soon as we were done. Drinks were brought out quickly. The sushi rolls were yummy. A bit pricey as they don't offer all you can eat.

From the HH menu, we ordered sweet garlic chili edamame and spicy rock shrimp. The edamame were addicting and I could not stop eating it. It had just enough heat for this wuss to tolerate it. The shrimp had a light batter that was not overpowering, accompanied with a sauce that complemented it. My friends also enjoyed Moscow Mules. For our main courses we got several of the special rolls: Hawaiian breeze, Pier, and Two Fifteen. I also got agedashi tofu to go. Everything was delicious.

I'm a vegetarian, so it's basically hard to mess up V rolls, but it's also not that easy to make them super tasty. At Pier 215 they sure did make them delicious.

Ingredients are high quality and super fresh. Presentation is stellar. Really surpassed my expectation- so much better than any sushi rest on the strip.

They were very accommodating of our party of four which had two kids. The decor of the restaurant was just beautiful - very clean, very modern.

We ordered the happy hour oysters $1 each - chefs choice. They were smaller in size but had a nice sweet taste to them.

Wife got the scallop risotto - wow.  I had to steal some. The scallops were huge and the flavor and texture of the risotto was A+. They also have an uni risotto for you uni fans - might try it next time. 

I ordered the chefs premium sushi - what a beautiful presentation. The toro had caviar and bits of gold leaf on it! What attention to detail! The piece of (what I thought was tamago) cake on the very far right of my pic was actually a very light piece of pound cake that had their logo embossed in it, how cool. My 10 month old son ended up grabbing a piece of it before I got to it. Haha

Service - everyone was so friendly. The place was so clean and well kept.

Out-of-towners looking for a sushi place that didn't have a 45 minute wait. I can't believe this place didn't, because it's fantastic. 

SAKE: Great selection from classic Junmai Ginjo for $20 a bottle to more refined $170 bottle choices. 

SUSHI: Husband had the dinner of chef's selections. They ask you what you don't like and work around it. Plate had standards you'd expect  (tuna, halibut, salmon, white tail) paired with more exotic pieces like squid, octopus, clam. Very good quality!

ROLLS: I had the Flaming Ahi Roll and the center spicy tuna was blended with a garlic ponzu sauce that gave it this amazing cream cheese like texture. Excellent.

4557799,2017-03-08,5,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Every time I go back to Las Vegas to visit my friends and old stomping grounds, I stick to the same nostalgic routine. I eat at the same places that I loved when I lived there and bask in the memories. 

This time though, it was recommended to me that I try a new place called Pier 215 and even though I was hesitant to change my ways, I gave it a shot. 

First of all, I have never been more happy with a recommendation!! This place was so perfect. I went in with my fiancé who is the biggest grump I k now and even he was impressed. 

The atmosphere hit me first. It is hip and sexy, but also romantic. With the mellow EDM music in the background, it's not your run of the mill restaurant, but it maintains that Vegas edginess that I love. 

Speaking of Vegas edginess, the place is wrapped in floor to ceiling windows out of which you can see the ENTIRE strip! Lit up in all its glory. So cool. 

Then you see the open kitchen, feel the beautiful decor, and the fragrance of the food hits you... it is a synesthetic feast before you even sit down. 

So by the way it was a Tuesday when we went in which could not have been more perfect as they half off bottles of wine on Tuesday. We got the Nuthouse Pinot Noir (by Argyle) from Willamette Valley Oregon and it was exactly as delicious as it sounds. 

Our server was fantastic.  Her knowledge was on point and she was able to GUIDE us through our dining experience instead of just taking our order. She was engaged and passionate and every recommendation she made, we ordered, and we were so happy we did. Here's what we had:

BEEF SHORT RIBS: braised to perfection, shiitake and beech mushrooms, blistered shishito peppers, adorable baby zucchinis, and potatoes. 

SALMON: a tender filet of salmon belly (marbled with fatty goodness) which is yuzu infused, with a mustard crime fraiche and soy salt. 

... I know! Amazing. 

Now we made the mistake of eating just an hour before we dined so we were too full to go on, but I am telling you this place is my NEW nostalgia. Every time I go back to Vegas, you will find me here at least once. 

I could not recommend it any more highly. You will love it! 

If you don't believe me, check out the pictures. They, as cliched as it sounds, speak 1000 words.  :)",uUO65LtFuUbpBALUh0-7Jw,8,8,5,-p5Y9yQt-QYMObjHlGCrBQ

4661976,2016-07-15,0,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"I've been eyeing this place for quite some time and finally got the chance to eat here. 

MENU:
The menu offers a variety of seafood options - sushi, sashimi, cut rolls, and oysters. For the non-seafood eaters, there's a section of pure land protein like chicken and beef. They also offer a great list of appetizers/tapas. 

FOOD/QUALITY:
I ordered the soft crab roll, an oyster, one order of salmon sashimi, and pickles. My friend ordered the bacon wrapped asparagus and shrimp tempura. We loved every single dish! The seafood is fresh and the dishes are nicely flavored. 

PRICES: 
The roll $9, oyster $2, salmon sashimi $2, pickles $4, two orders of bacon wrapped asparagus $5, shrimp tempura $4. With a beer, our bill came out to about $40 before tip. You can definitely have an intimidate seafood/sushi date without putting a hole in your wallet. 

ENVIRONMENT:
This place has a great date vibe. The decor is chic. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Our waitress was friendly and checked in with us quite often. 

Overall, I would come back again whether it's with a friend or by myself.",zKCAyo1rdFKu8xQGivJeUw,4,3,5,3sTqSicAj6Fhy0PCJQAhuQ

Admittedly, I didn't read the whole review in Seven, so I can't say if I'm agreeing or disagreeing with their assessment. 

Ambience - lovely.  The views are really nice and it felt upscale without being pretentious. Quick service when we arrived and the server was very friendly.

First thing ordered - the Seafood Nacho.  NOT impressed.  The dish relied heavily on what tasted like thousand island dressing (though it was probably spicy mayo). The dish was very bland and I would definitely not recommend it. It also had a heap of sour cream on top that didn't go with the dish at ALL. No Bueno for the first taste of Pier 215.

Next up, we ordered the Sushi Dinner - 10 pieces of sushi and a tuna roll.  (The server asked if there was anything we didn't like, so that was great.) The sushi was roughly about one thousand ones better than the appetizer. I was impressed with how the fish melted in my mouth.  The rice was a liiiiiittle bit dry but not bad. The best nigiri was the salmon, the tuna, and the snapper. The giant clam was really interesting - if you haven't had it, definitely try it. 

The final thing we ordered was the Flaming Ahi roll - this was excellent! 

Total bill was $80 for two of us (including 1 beer).

Will I come back? Maybe for the nigiri, but avoid that ""Seafood Nacho"" at all costs.

The ambience and decor of the restaurant was really chill and I loved the music they played.  We were greeted by a host and our server was attentive as well. After looking at so many choices for sushi and other asian fusion dishes, we decided to try a few dishes from the Happy Hour menu. You can't go wrong with that.

I ordered sweet chili garlic edamame - really good, crispy rice with spicy tuna - rice wasn't too crunchy and just the perfect balance with the tuna, seafood ceviche, and two dozen oysters - very fresh. My partner also ordered the tokyo mule to drink and it was so good! Our waiter said they had some promotion going on so we were offered a free shot of tequila as well, but I decided to pass.

This will be the third revision of this review for me :) I love a place where the food and the service are great. The service here is outstanding. And the food has been great every time we've been back.

The Tapas at Pier 215 have been highlights for me so far, specifically the Shrimp Tempura and Crispy Pork Belly with Kochujang Miso and Balsamic Soy. I have seen pictures of the Deep Fried Dumplings and I am glad they were Pan Fried when I visited. It is clear that the management reads your reviews and is willing to make adjustments to please their guests.

The Tempura Shrimp is light and crispy with a hot, but not overcooked, shrimp center. If you look closely you can see the tiny bubbles in the batter adding to the airy crispness of the shrimp tempura. The batter itself has been nice and golden brown each time we've ordered it. This has become a requirement for me at Pier 215.

Crispy Pork Belly with Kochujang Miso and Balsamic Soy is a hit for me. The pork belly had a crispy exterior with a soft center that just dissolved as I ate it. It was such a nice combination of texture and flavor. I always end up hoarding that dish and saving the kochujang miso and balsamic soy sauce to try it with the other food that I ordered. Next time I'll order it on the side if I can. I especially like eating this tapas with the Kinchi Fried Rice with Pork Belly, which is excellent on its own.

I enjoyed the Sushi Sampler. The fish always tastes fresh and each piece is always dressed and at a proper temperature. That kind of attention brings out a nice bright flavor. The same can be said about the other nigiri we ordered. I have not experienced the issues with the sushi rice as some others have indicated. The rice has always been at a good temperature, neither over or under cooked with a pleasant acidity. In most cases I am more particular about the rice than I am with the neta.

The Scallops and Brown Rice Risotto are a treat. The risotto and scallops were cooked perfectly. The scallops were slightly opaque in the middle with a thoroughly cooked exterior and a nice smoky flavor coming from the grill marks.  I love scallops. One of the tiny voices in my head is a Gordon Ramsay clone and he comes out when scallops and risotto are sensed. 

I could go on singing praises about the food and the service here, but this review is turning into an article. Stop by and try it for yourself. The food here is presented beautifully, service is excellent, and the ambiance is very pleasing. I will be returning here soon and I hope you get a chance to enjoy Pier 215 as I have.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,5,2,5,9r16cu4rc5njwwDyNqkW9Q

We were going to do the Chef Premium Sashimi Platter, but our server said that they have a ""Seafood Tower"" special today.  Seafood Tower?? Omg how can I not?

The Seafood Tower commanded a 3 digit price, but 110% beat my expectations.  It had: King Crab legs, the **BEST** oysters I've had, clams, mussels, ceviche, and an assortment of sashimi.  I just want to point out again - they were the **BEST** oysters I've ever had. Yes that good.

We've also ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and Grilled Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar).  The Pork Belly was not as fatty as I would like it to be.  The Hamachi Kama was a bit lacking in serving size.   

Service was attentive and great when we first arrived and ordered, but our server basically disappeared halfway through our meal.  I think they were a bit short staffed for the holiday.

Overall, I am very excited for a high quality seafood restaurant in the south west region.  The prices were a bit high regular dining out (i.e. vs $25 AYCE dinners).  I think the service hiccup was an anomaly.  I will definitely be back.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,3,3,4,CaV9qbnOSR61UdyQKC6Gjg

The general manager is freaking phenomenal he definitely hooked it up and went over the whole menu with us! He was very very handsome and suave, me and my BF loved him!

The inside is so beautiful we got a table with the view. We started off with two oyster shooters and hot sake which was PERFECT temperature it didn't burn me!!!!!!!!

Food: the lotus roll was a 6/10 wasn't very good but it was fresh but I hate surimi crab haha. Sweet after taste and the flavors don't really come together.

Wasabi and ginger a 10/10

Sushi dinner 10/10 so amazing and fresh fish

The o toro I died, it was so amazing and buttery and delicious. I didn't eat ginger after so I could keep the taste in my mouth

The oysters were FREAKING AWESOME and huge. 

The yellow tail salsa was amazing too!

Miso soup was fresh and so was the gyoza! Not too over fried

My only complaint is that they forgot like 4 of our items and we have to remind them 3+ times but that's okay!! I love this place! I will be back",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,12,6,5,QHYLnAc4NNKIYmsj_iFFGw

Nothing was bland or overpowering. We actually finished everything we ordered. Inside was very nice and clean with a wonder view of the Vegas strip and the mountains from their floor to ceiling windows. 

Ben was our server and he was great. Very nice and attentive. Always checking up on us and making sure everything was going good including keeping our drinks filled and plates clean. He recommendations were good as well. We would come back to personally request for him again. 

Food was excellent.

Miso glazed salmon with brown rice risotto - 10/10 Good flavor. We requested it to be more on the mid rare side so it came out perfectly and not dry

Kushi oysters - 10/10 very fresh go with the wasabi salsa and ponzu

Crispy pork belly - 8/10 good sauce. Nice bite size and crisp. Tender but could be a little more tender 

Beef tataki - 10/10 very tender good flavor

Hamachi Kama - 8/10 

Salmon skin handroll - 10/10 very crispy. yum. had avocado in it too

Oh & Chu toro - 10/10 super fresh and buttery

Yellowtail Jalapeño - 10/10 very fresh 

Deep fried NY Cheesecake - 10/10 the way a deep fried cheese cake should taste! Very yummy and went very well with all of the fresh berries and cream plus green tea ice cream

Green tea ice cream - 10/10 it's the good kind and not the nasty tasting green tea ice cream most restaurants have.

5094986,2016-07-02,24,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"A food court offering Japanese, Korean, AYCE sushi bar style Americanized food with Vegas flair.  Huh?  Then again, what's offered is done well enough to please most.  A great thing in such a multi-ethnic city.

Keeping it real, sushi is AYCE joint quality.  OK ingredients, average quality short grain rice.  Vegas style rolls pack ingredients and over the top flavors.  Pass unless you're into that.  There are more interesting things to try.

Great raw bar.  On a recent visit, four kinds of live oysters including the Kushi, a personal favorite (small, plump, clean oceanic brine with the unmistakable finish of cucumbers), lobster, snow crab, king crab, and jumbo shrimp.  Typical shooters, oyster and uni shooters with quail egg and ponzu. Both fresh and as expected.  Do NOT add sake to the shooter.  Quail egg yolk and sake; you've been warned.  Finally, a good octopus carpaccio that captures the essence of the sea with the addition of yuzu, soy, and truffle oil.

The standout ""tapa"" is the crispy pork belly in kochujang, miso, and balsamic soy.  The pork is first sous vide,  releasing its oily fat leaving behind a moist, tender porky morsel, then its skin crisped to a golden brown cracklin.  The sauce brings out the sweetness. Good eats.  Great alongside a plate of grilled and blistered shishito peppers.  

Sadly, the crispy soft shell crab wasn't crispy and the shrimp tempura, more coating that actual shrimp.  Better examples elsewhere.

From the $hits and giggles section AKA ""specialties thrown in just because "":  lobster rolls and fish & chips alongside chicken katsu and fettuccine.   Props to the bouillabaisse; clams, mussels, fish, etc in a lobster and dashi based kochujang miso broth.  Seafood slightly overcooked but good flavor ending with gentle fermented notes.  The miso glazed salmon steak, properly cooked with a sweet, salty, miso, sake glaze, correct.
 
Good, friendly off Strip service.  

Putting it in perspective, it's not Yonaka Modern nor Izakaya Go.  It isn't fusion rather straddles the line between Asian and American offering something for everyone including those who feel Goyomon is da bomb.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,30,28,4,_TEZcYJ8RmSQ2CmtDZcDVg

Our first visit was a couple months ago and we have now been 2-3 times a week ever since!  Quality fish, excellent service by all of the hostess, waiters and waitress and Sam the manager always makes it a point to come around, say hello and thank us for coming in!  They have a great selection of beer, wine, sake and even a small bar with some select liquor in case you'd prefer to drink a cocktail! We are slowly trying new things every time we go but so far I'd have to recommend the Flaming Ahi Roll, it's delicious if you like a little spice, the Yellowtail Salsa is  also very flavorful if you enjoy sashimi and the Spicy Tuna with crispy rice is always one of my favorites! You can never go wrong with salmon and yellowtail sashimi either, the fish is soo fresh and you can taste the quality with every bite!  Of course the Otoro is always amazing as well!

We really enjoyed the food here. And can definitely see us coming back as regulars. More of a treat once in a while versus a once a week type restaurant. That's not a bad thing at all but be prepared to spend a few bucks if you go all out. Let's get to the food. 

We ordered 

Uni 3/5- plain nothing special wasn't as fresh as I wanted it to be.

Half dozen Kumamoto oysters and Half Kuushi oysters 5/5- I love oysters so these were a great treat and delicious and fresh loved the dipping sauces there was 4 that was offered all were great also a must order!!

Hamachi Kama 5/5- Loved that it was a very big portion that fed me and my wife as a very well prepared piece you yellowtail collar. Absolute must order for sure! 

Black tiger roll 4/5- pretty tasty roll. Not something you've never had before but yummy!

Scallops and brown risotto 3.5/5- Scallops were delicious but risotto was not cooked to my liking I would like it a little softer texture rather than al-dente.

Seafood bouillabaisse 4/5- Really good broth in this I ordered some rice to eat with the broth poured all over. The seafood was good there was shrimp,lobster, crab, scallops,mussels,clams and mushrooms and bok choy. Would order again but would like more crab in this.

On our visit, I ordered the deluxe chef special for $59. It consisted of a small salad, miso soup, ten pieces niigiri sushi and ten pieces sashimi. I received AYCE size and quality sushi and sashimi. That was disappointing. 

My friend got the Anago bowl $18 and did like the cooked eel over rice. My wife had the seared scallops over risotto $28 and said her scallops were a little overcooked but still enjoyed it. 

The happy hour specials we tried were the fish and chips (good), spicy quesadilla (okay) and the fried zucchini (okay).

Japanese tapas are hard to come by and never would I think to try Japanese snapper carpacchio but am sure glad I did.  The tangy sauce was the perfect complement to the thinly sliced fish and the cilantro touch was just enough. My sushi-hating friends love that they have options such as melt-in-your mouth short ribs and chicken fettuccine alfredo. 

The prices are a bit higher here, but you can be sure the product is that much fresher.  I often like to pop in for their lunch combination specials which are perfectly crafted to-go.

Atmosphere:

Perfect, Clean, Simple, Attractive.

Service:

Nice Greeting, No Rush To Order, First server was good, his relief was a little too talkative, nonetheless Service was good.

Food

Simple flavors, complimented each dish, but nothing new that I haven't tasted before. Nice variety throughout the Menu. I always order a Spider Roll aka Soft Shell Crab Roll at any ""sushi"" restaurant I haven't been to, and the first attempt was disappointing, cold to touch, I've never had a cold Soft Shell Crab Roll before and asked isn't the Soft Shell Crab fired per order, they agreed and quickly replaced it with a PERFECT Soft Shell Crab Roll!

5401535,2017-01-23,2,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"What a pleasant surprise! This restaurant is phenomenal. We were driving around close to where we live and decided to yelp areas around town and this restaurant had a high rating. We thought... Is it new?... We decided to try it. We are sure glad we did!
To begin with, it isn't a very good location, right off Durango and the 215. Secondly, it is a very nice restaurant with a lovely ambience and very comfortable seating. It is relaxed and informal, with excellent service and prices that are more than reasonable.
We started with the octopus carpaccio which was delicious, followed by the cucumber salad which was outstanding, and we also tried the mixed tempura made with vegetables and shrimp and it was quite yummy.
We then ordered a yellowtail with scallion roll, toro with scallion roll, and a rainbow roll. All three were simply divine! They were so incredibly good that we were in disbelief that we have found such an incredible restaurant off the strip with such incredible sushi at such reasonable prices. Note that only two weeks ago we went to a restaurant at the MGM Grand Hotel, a Japanese/sushi restaurant with the name of a very iron famous chef, and this restaurant's sushi was so much better than the sushi at that restaurant and I am not kidding. We payed three times as much at that restaurant for sushi that was not half as good as that of Pier 215. We also tried the Pier 215 Roll which is a rainbow roll that is loaded up with way more ingredients including asparagus and mango and several more slices of fish added to it as well as softshell crab: it was pretty good!
We did try a specialty warm plate which was the miso Salmon with risotto: it was not bad at all and really good for anyone that is not a sushi fan. It was really good. 
To drink, we ordered the white peach Hana sake: wow... delicious!
This is a wonderful restaurant, off the strip, with extremely good and high-quality food, with a lot of Japanese and Korean influence, and it was simply delicious. I highly recommend it to anyone and it beats pretty much any restaurant on the strip that wants to compete with this restaurant for great sushi. If I could, I would give this restaurant 10 stars! We are definitely going back!

We were quickly greeted, seated, and brought drinks. Our waiter told us about the sake special, but since neither of us had tried it before, we were hesitant to purchase any. Our waiter was nice enough to bring us some sake to try with our dinner. 

I ordered the spicy tuna and avocado rice bowl, and my fiance ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. We each ordered two individual pieces of sushi, since he isn't really big on fish and just wanted to try some. I got the fresh eel, he got tuna, and we both got a yellowtail to try.

The presentation for all the rolls were nice but we weren't satisfied with the taste. All the rolls were mediocre. For the price of each roll, it wasn't worth it. The single tapas I ordered was great though. You can't got wrong with tempura in a Japanese restaurant! The crab legs were so crunchy and flavorful. The presentation of this dish was mouth watering and it truly was a great dish. Besides the speed of the food arriving at our table, the waiter was very polite and was on top of our drinks. We both had an order of mochi ice cream for dessert and I was sort of hoping for a fresh mochi but it wasn't. And it was tiny too. They split it open and add whip cream for it to be more appealing to the eye. The mochi skin was hard. Maybe I just had to wait for it to come to room temperature?

----------

Summary: This is one of those restaurants that my friends and I like to dub ""Hipster Restaurants"".

What we mean by this is that almost everything is great. Great service, great food presentation, great atmosphere, great range of higher-end ingredients, etc. 

The one thing that isn't great? The food. Not to say that the food is bad, it's okay. It's just that there are sure a lot of lacking and mismatched flavors. I'm sure there might be a dish or two worth going back for. But for the price and portion sizes overall? Absolutely not worth it. It's like they took a regular dish, cut it in half, threw truffle oil and a leaf on it, gave it some fancy description, and doubled/tripled the price. 

Please note that I do consider Firefly and Other Mama to also be ""Hipster Restaurants"". So if you like those places this might be the place for you. If not, then you will probably feel the way I do about this place.

----------

Ordered: The 3 out of 4 dishes we ordered were recommended by the waiter as popular.

Crispy pork belly: The tiniest portion size known to man. Very plain. It just tastes like grilled pork belly with vinegar. You can get cheaper, tastier pork belly at literally any other asian restaurant.

Korean beef short ribs: OK portion size. Texture of meat was strange... super soft and falling apart. Pretty plain for korean short ribs. Expected more for the price. Again, you can get a cheaper, tastier version at any korean restaurant. 

Miso Glazed Salmon: Pretty good. Actually liked this one. Bit pricey but I could see how it would get people to come back. 

The Pier Roll: Your average sushi roll... except with a gallon of black pepper. It wasn't bad... it was just weird...? I like black pepper but the flavour just did not match and was pretty overpowering compared to the rest of the sushi roll.",b4t9cwSUG4FRamK4G8FTSg,1,1,3,YM12ufJ6e8-wrJjGhyNkHQ
5466439,2018-03-02,1,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Went here for Valentine's day dinner. It was just a couple stores down from the gym I go to. Literally just finished hitting the gym and drove over to this trendy and modern location. 

We had made reservations but were 10 mins late. They still accommodated us and the hostess tried her best to get us their next open table. It was quite busy in there but the staff seemed to have their stuff together. The ambience felt romantic; dim lights, good music, and good food. 

My boyfriend and I started off with an appetizer of their salmon skin salad which was a pretty big portion, serves for 2-3. We also got their sale @ happy hour price- . As for entrees, I had their miso grazed salmon with brown rice risotto (yum!) and my other half got their angus steak which he seemed to enjoy. 

We didn't go for anything on their raw menu which seemed to be a popular item that night but I'd love to go back and try whatever else they got to offer. 

Our server was awesome, he gave us some recommendations and also explained things in more detail when we had questions about their menu. Before we left, we also got chocolate (Ferrero Rocher) handmade roses from the hostess.

5508583,2016-11-08,1,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"I've been hearing great things about this place for quite a while now, but this was my first time dining here. It definitely lived up to my expectations. I came in with my husband and my parents, who were visiting from Southern California. Coming from somewhere where they have access to exceptional seafood, my parents tend to be a bit picky in this area, but they were very happy with everything as well.

Since it was our first visit, our server Naomi took the time to explain the menu to us and to recommend a few popular dishes. I took her up on one of her suggestions and had the miso glazed salmon with brown rice risotto. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the glaze was rich and a little bit sweet. My husband had the beef short ribs, which were tender and juicy. My mom ordered the shrimp and scallop tobanyaki (served on a sizzling hot plate) which she said was exactly what she had envisioned in her mind. My dad had the chef's sashimi sampler and raved about the freshness of all the fish and how it melted in his mouth. 

The atmosphere was great and it was easy for us to have a conversation while we dined. The service was attentive but not overpowering. We loved the strings of lights draped from the ceiling, providing a cozy atmosphere that was perfect for our intimate family dinner. It would have been great for a date night too, something my husband and I definitely plan on doing here in the near future. 

The wine list, although not extensive, was decent and affordably priced. The food menu included so many options that we all had trouble settling on just one thing to order. We will definitely be back again in the future to work our way through more of the menu. It's so great to have such a wonderful restaurant so close to home.

5529759,2016-06-02,87,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"New restaurants near home are always a welcome sight, especially one as pretty as Pier 215.  With all the new housing developments coming up in this general area, and Ikea just across the way, I hope this is just the tip of a very delicious iceberg.  
  
We eschewed anything resembling sushi; nothing new being brought to the table as far as that goes.  Since there are other decent options for raw fish just a couple of miles away in multiple directions, $22 for a nigiri dinner didn't feel like money well spent or stomach real estate worth occupying.

The ""Asian Style Bouillabaisse"" featured an assortment of seafood cooked in a lobster gochujang miso broth.  The combined flavors from the mussels, clams, mushrooms and shrimp made for a really nice soup that I'd gladly pay for as a straight up beverage on a cold day.  I also wouldn't have minded an upsell to have actual lobster added into the pot as that would have made it even better.  Lobster makes people happy.  To prove this, I will attempt to throw cold chunks of lobster meat at the next crying child I see.  They should perk up instantly.                

Miso glazed salmon steak (menu said galzed, which could possibly be a trendy new cooking method I'm not familiar with :) was a hit for the both of us.  The well seasoned, almost candied outside of the fish had me ready to hail our friendly waiter down for a second order upon my first bite.  The bed of brown rice risotto it laid upon was an excellent accompaniment.  I would have preferred a lesser cooked center which would have made for more juiciness, but it was still a very well done dish.       

They did a really great job with the design and ambiance of the space.  The big panoramic windows really make the whole room.  I'll be sure to make a reservation next time to ensure a table by them.  It's yet another Asian-y restaurant to add to the ever-expanding rotation of quality spots in this vicinity.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,151,121,4,59DZ4n4av0lZ6HZktIjp_A

Between my date and I, we ordered three traditional rolls- tuna, spicy tuna, and salmon- the spicy garlic edamame, the kimchi fried rice, and the Hawaiian Breeze roll.

Note that at the time of our visit, they were only serving one other table and four others as we were leaving, so they were not remotely close to being busy. Long story short, they managed to forget one of our orders and forget about the check we requested at the end of our meal. For a restaurant at the price point, I expected way better service.

P.S. The food was delicious. But it's hard to enjoy it when it's coupled with bad service.",LCjnHu4gow-W3eJMf-cIJQ,1,0,2,jxbfMXMGrpSDYf9u0kAX2w

We also ordered shrimp tempura which came with 4 pieces and shrimp tempura roll. Waters were always refilled and Ben was always around to be sure we were taken care of with anything else we needed. Sam the general manager also recommended the mochi ice cream which I had the green tea one.

The service was the best I'd seen in awhile. We did order crime brûlée and it came in a aluminum foil container which to me indicates it's ordered like that. The top of it was not torched to create the sugar crust that makes creme brûlée so good. $7 error for store bought creme brûlée that they didn't even torch in house is just lazy. Will I be back?

Second thought: this place has good food.

I had the toro sushi, salmon eggs, and salmon. The salmon is of a high quality, higher than most other places around. Same goes for the other pieces as well. You pay about as much for one piece as you do two at some other places, so it's not like you're getting an incredibly good deal, but the quality is there.

Located just off the 215 and Durango, (same center as EOS Fitness) Pier 215 is located on the end cap of the strip center with parking directly in front of the restaurant if available. 
Walking up the stairs I was greeted with the door opening and welcomed in, asked if I had a reservation, which I did not, but still quickly seated for a table of 5. 

The restaurant has a smaller bar area and the overall appearance of the decorations is above average which makes it nice place for many types of dining occasions. 

Once we were told about the specials, I ordered standard sushi pieces, yellow tail, salmon, and a chiefs special which all was fantastically prepared and fresh.

Overall this place was greatly priced and the quality of the food and service did not disappoint. Certainly will be back to partake in sitting at the sushi bar area!",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,1,1,4,TZejh5K8JSskWAYzEFgxUg

Pros
- Nice location with a sense of humor with the name Pier 215 (view is of the freeway)
- Cool open kitchen
- Sushi quality was really good (however rice was mushy)

Cons
- Server/Chef kept forgetting what we ordered. Multiple times. 
- Food came out excruciatingly slow
- Cooked items (tapas) were creative, but underseasoned

I liked all of them. 

Second, the servers are attentive and the manager is very professional and friendly. 

Third, it's got the great ambiance. Contemporary interior with the best view in town. I've never seen a local sushi restaurant has a view from Summerlin to the Strip from your table and night view is even better. Open kitchen is a plus!

5902835,2018-03-23,3,9cw870n3gsGikVoOT5YOYg,"Service is friendly, but the price is too steep for food that can be hit-or-miss. Here's the lowdown ~ 

I RECOMMEND:
-- Uni Nigiri. It looked great and tasted fresh.
-- Rock Shrimp aka one of the best orders of honey walnut shrimp I've ever had. The batter was unbelievably light and crispy, the sauce was balanced, and the cranberries were a great addition.

I'D SKIP:
-- Chu Toro. It looked sloppy and it was average quality.
-- Beef Teriyaki Lunch Special. It comes with a lot, but it wasn't done well. Both the teriyaki and the salad dressing had too much of a raw onion flavor that was overpowering. The tempura was not much better. The batter was too heavy, while the vegetables had too much bite.

CLOSE RUNNER UPS:
-- Clam Miso Soup with mushrooms. While good, I don't think the quality justified the price.
-- Sashimi Rice Bowl Lunch Special. Presentation-wise, it was beautiful with the different colors of different fish, ikura, micro greens, and radish. Flavor was decent and fish quality was average.

Overall, this place was just okay. I expect better quality for the price, and the food here is too hit-or-miss to have me rushing back.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,7,2,3,svTLvp4yoMXfT8zeqsMPmw

Came here about 1 week after they opened with a small group of friends. Overall the space is clean and functional.  I love the ""seaside pier"" theme in the middle of the desert! haha.  If you are lucky enough to sit by the windows, you might catch a glimpse of the strip far away ;)

Food quality was solid. They have oysters and different sushi options, but also have some random western mixes in there! For example, their Katsu Fish Alfredo....what? it sounds super weird, but is oddly delicious! And makes for good leftovers.  The fish is fresh and portions are good. Ordered the Lotus roll which sounded and looked more impressive than it tasted (bland in my opinion).  The sushi chef carving the cucumber for this roll was kind of mesmerizing though! Also ordered red velvet cake for dessert which was only OK. 

Service was very good.  The hostess was friendly and quick, and our server, while excessively excited, was also friendly and efficient. He was very good about explaining the menu.

We decided to go all out and order fried calamari legs, agedashi tofu, peppers, yellowtail jalapeño salsa, beef roll, oyster shooters and for entrees I got baked lobster tail with angus beef and my boyfriend got angus ribeye steak. Everything was great, the yellow tails was so buttery and melts in your mouth. The baked lobster was my favorite, goes great with lemon and butter.

The food was delicious! I ordered their special which was the miso salmon steak. It's a bit on the pricey side but the flavors really deliver. It's sweet on the exterior and tender everywhere else. Pair it with risotto and you're in for an ultimate experience. It was one of those entrees you wished was bigger just to eat for pleasure. So good. 

My girlfriend got a lobster roll and all ingredients worked in a harmonious effort. From the avocado for the sauce, you're really tasting different flavors that truly completes the meal. 

We also got dessert which was ice cream with macarons. The taste is a bit underwhelming as the vanilla ice cream seemed just a tad basic. It's served in a cone bowl which made the meal fun and three assorted macarons.
