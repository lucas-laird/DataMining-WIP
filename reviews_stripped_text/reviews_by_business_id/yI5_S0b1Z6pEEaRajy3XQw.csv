Rice and beans were flavorful and the plantains were sweet and delicious as well. Improved quality of the ingredients for the jerk chicken would make this a 4-star review!",gCtjQUXDD9nr_ecp9bSE0g,0,0,3,WtVQnbYOP7EH6QL7hz2Z-Q

They are always sold out but fortunately I finally got a plate . It was soooooo yummy. It sucks that it's in a casino.,gfb7cv_N9DMmUn5AhowrSA,1,0,5,aKPcE4MlxdrtjAfmFiifGg
2779466,2018-05-21,0,yI5_S0b1Z6pEEaRajy3XQw,Look at this plate I LITERALLY JUST ORDERED.... I'm so mad right now. This place is hood but they usually have good portions and good food. While my jerk chicken was good it was clearly reheated and not freshly made. Then my plantain look miniature. I'm not happy with this visit by far.,Yn4_EHfEjpDpZjlfqq_1sw,0,0,2,iAwF6h4uQ3KxPKEujMN2-Q

Obviously not  in the nicest part of town, and not in the greatest hotel/casino. My mom spends a lot of time here, so my boyfriend and I decided to hang out with her for a bit and grab a bite. We didn't get anything too exciting (just chicken fingers which were very good), but the menu has some good choices of food that I would like to come back and try.",nmmLmIKmcdZY8hxDzI0HTQ,0,0,4,UKN00AMGgsFzbh37iU_A3A

As a west indian I'm always looking for some good Caribbean food out here, heard about this place and had to try it. The ox tail did sound tempting but since I stopped eating pork I decided to go with the jerk chicken and belizean stew chicken. In the past I've only had Trinidadian stew chicken which I'm not a huge fan of but I loved the belizean stew chicken definitely different from Trinidadian stew. Food was delicious and the portion sizes were great. Definitely making this a regular spot when I'm craving some good old Caribbean food.",nujF3eFdIpWpeocomusfWQ,3,1,5,nBPi7yBwYidYcZ3qNtRBww
4515056,2018-06-30,0,yI5_S0b1Z6pEEaRajy3XQw,Smh only reason I went here was so I can get something cooked cause I don't eat fast food and since I've moved here I figured I'll try they special. Two pieces of chicken and two sides. The chicken tasted like it was cooked in old grease. The sides were tiny didn't even fill half of the Togo box sections. The sides was whatever tho' tase like the pre-made stuff. I also got my favorite famous breakfast I just be wanting two eggs and hash browns. How can anyone mess that up. Man Came with two pieces of your choice of meat and some toast. I couldn't believe how you can be selfish with has Browns. Omg. I pay less at Boulder station and they give you a huge. (compared to this place-paper thin.) It tripped me out how I had more eggs then the hash browns. SMH yeah I'm coo' off that place. I had to do a review cause I keep convincing myself to just be hungry b4 I spend my money with selfish cooks.,RLxcXJkVvOG_bpxgT5HZNg,0,0,2,eMyEAAljKLf2QOu8rNALfw
