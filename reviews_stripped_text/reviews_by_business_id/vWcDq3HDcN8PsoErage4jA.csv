He has consistently gone out of his way and been very pleasant every time I've stopped by. I'm in awe that this man cares so much about doing his job. It blows my mind in the world we live in today!! I just prey someone notices this and give him the credit he deserves. I was done with j&tb.  He kept me coming.",g1cWV9uMsyeifSU4HQMiEw,0,0,4,XlteUli6uWDcn9Lv8KTyvQ

The guy working the drive-thru on 6/8 @'bout 10:30p was super nice. My klutzy ass pulled up to the wrong window, but the guy working the window was still nice, lol. 

After biting into my 1st taco, my annoyance of having to experience a slight wait in the drive thru line, quickly disappeared because the food we obtained was super duper fresh! Also I'm a little extra, when I ask for extra lettuce on my tacos (why? Idk maybe 'cuz I feel less guilty eating them if they consist of more veggies). My hubby sourdough jack was again, super fresh ""of the grill"" good. 

No complaints coming from this location.",8drMKNHWavs2g6uf0pLtvg,8,5,3,rgGoNrGE965pDsos6kUdUg

First, there was a non English speaking family camping at a booth. Like, straight up blankets and pajamas. As I was ordering, one of the kid girls was basically leaning against my leg, asking for something but I'm not sure if she was asking me or the manager who was taking my order. 

Second, this place looked like they had just endured the mother of all rushes. All, yes all, sodas were empty. The light for the shakes was on saying it was low. The bathroom was a pig sty. Paper towels overflowing the trash and all over the floor. 

I should've realized something was wrong when one of the kids working there was running out when I first got there and told me someone else would be with me. He just had this desperation look like something was wrong. 

Was just very odd.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,2,0,1,AUAj4ja3k2rxH1-S7Z3zxw

So I was just like okay whatever it's not a big deal. But tonight, I ordered a cheesecake with my meal... after I get my food I realized they forgot the cheesecake. Already slightly irritated, I drive back around to the window (it was not busy at all) and let the employee know that he forgot the cheesecake. There was no apology at all. He just handed me the bag. It was kind of strange because all he did was stare and didn't say a word.",p_5Uo5YcEyE3MEB369053Q,0,0,1,2_hbtCD2s6BnEjDuhgo4sA

The gentleman working the grave shift is always nice and courteous. Food INCLUDING fries are always fresh unlike so many other fast food joints.  Food may not be super fast due to employees making fresh products. I'm willing to wait. Thank you Jack In the Box-- Ft Apache.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,0,0,5,pF8wqh1GZEixCyiWCSPt3g

She filled the cups and then carried all three over with her fingers in the glasses. Really??????  When I advised of what she did and I wanted ad new one, her body language and facial expression was of anger. She did not verbally acknowledge my complaint, smirked the entire time. She went and prepared a new drink.   How she thought this was okay after handling cash, I am baffled.  I am certain this is a regular occurrence.  My son works for the Clark County Health Department  and I will be filing a complaint.   I understand she was busy and may have not been mindful of what she was doing. However, her attitude and lack of professionalism and customer service is not acceptable.",SVJ71vqsbFAactSL7gwm8w,0,0,1,SCGAZgbUJ0JNM4mpq3X4Qg
