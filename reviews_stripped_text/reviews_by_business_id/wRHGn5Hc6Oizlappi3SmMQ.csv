$5.00 down the toilet. It just wasn't done right. Maybe the instruction booklet was missing that day.",P6_r7O8zEjnxTSBkS6WYfg,3,2,1,T1FQyNeU1thAW7F10ErySA

I will return to this DQ/OJ anytime I am seeking a quick fix for some upside-down ice cream and a dope orange j?l. He deserves a raise or bonus for how well he treated us.",hozbmvGx-rIhUkJ060U3nA,0,0,5,2dprolcpiwMfbHGbQh_vPQ
3098375,2017-08-23,0,wRHGn5Hc6Oizlappi3SmMQ,Husband ordered a pina colada smoothie from here - drinks in Vegas are generally Expensive but this place had smoothies that were delicious and refreshing. It's pretty much a jamba juice located inside the mall.,5yGgNgkkNvsv6dYiA_whFw,0,0,4,T7dxEMgk1cgPtZ2LVlDrug
4286276,2018-01-03,6,wRHGn5Hc6Oizlappi3SmMQ,"Ah yes. Reminiscent of my childhood days the orange Julius kiosk in the malls. 

I was feeling disappointed when the orange Julius recipe just isn't the same slushy treat but instead watery. 

The employees here recommended putting in some ice cream to bring back the slushy feel. They nailed it and really hit the spot. 

Those who were disappointed in their orange Julius experience try above and you won't be disappointed again I promise",L6nrDwHJDyV0KThjON-Kog,7,8,5,ZMf8X_4c14GPLvYvwfK6OQ

Seems that they need a second employees to handle the line of people, many of which walked away.  Not good business.  Apparently on Mondays, just one working.  Ice cream was fine, out of cherries for the sundaes",IR0S-EMmcbHPNZmdi4T5ww,0,0,2,RFUD0KalflN2nBYnMzDi0A

A new worker made my drink and had to review the ingredients before making it.

It tasted horrible...

Stick with the DQ items and get a blizzard.",VYOQLKuR0Ugy9lU-QiOuLw,0,0,2,5wMFGOeiVQjFSRas-k_kGQ
