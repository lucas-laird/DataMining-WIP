So- we people at the airport are actually in a time crunch as it is. To say you're backed up, after the lunch hour (1:30p) with not that many people waiting for their subs to be made is not good service. If they can't handle the rush at a busy airport, then they need to try another venue. Sorry Port of Subs management, but Nathalie T pretty much discouraged anyone in the line from buying your subs thanks to her obnoxious announcements that it would take at least 20 minutes to make a sub. Really? That is NOT good business. Either put more people on staff who know what they're doing, or move to a strip mall. This is not copacetic for an airport restaurant, especially at Las Vegas Mccarran Int'l airport.",3xYBegRgw-MOLtPLJ7albA,1,1,1,pTiKu7Bq2WzxrKEPpjFfVQ

1202374,2013-07-22,1,rFP41LryXOyizCuMPjjw1A,"I'm stunned by the horrifically negative reviews thus far.  What do you expect in an airport for food options?  Under $5 footlong combo value meals?  Yeah, right.  Try buying your food hours before your flight maybe from your local gas station on the way to the airport, and then MAYBE your reviews make more sense.  I mean, seriously, have you never traveled before???

Anyway, Port of Subs.  It's probably the best option available in the terminal, though tastes may vary.  What is nice is that they offer a variety of fresh sandwiches and salads.  And when I say fresh, I mean they slice the meats to order, like Jersey Mike's, not pull them up from a pre-sliced cauldron of questionable sanitation.  Speaking of which, the place was sparkling clean, too.

The service was fast, the staff was friendly enough (didn't go out of their way, but wasn't rude either).  I liked that there was a Mrs. Fields in the same kiosk, too... yum... cookies.  Overall, this was the best option I found in the airport and the price was about what I expected.  You KNOW they're going to jack these up at the airport... don't look for normal prices here.  Still worth the value.  A very full and filling sub, fresh ingredients, and fast service.  Can't ask for more!",OYqbkGuG-FksdFhggwljjw,2,0,4,sroTtpv-UChC0RoIhCjG9w

Why would you do that? You asked if I wanted mayo or mustard, not only did I say mustard but I BEGGED you not to put mayonnaise on it. The cashier and I joked about how awful mayo is, we shared a distaste for it. Why would you do it? Why would you stab me in the back like that? 

I get on my flight. Open the sub. It didn't even have some mayo dabblings, this baby was fully drenched. I payed $4 or something ridiculous for a terrible cup of noodles, threw away the entirety of my useless $8 sub and cried all the way home.

I ordered a large Italian with all the fixings (except for onion). As far as sandwiches go, this was pretty good, especially the bread. The service was very friendly.

The main thing is that they have SMOKEY CHEDDAR CHEESE which is literally the best cheese ever invented and why no other sandwich shops have it I will never know.
