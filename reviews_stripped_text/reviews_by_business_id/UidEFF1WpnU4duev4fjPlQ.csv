I love the feel of the place. Music was at a nice level where we could hear it and still have conversations without yelling over one another. 

For starters I had the oxtail empanadas to start. These were delish!!! 

My main corse I had the sliced chimichurri steak which was a little bland but still enjoyable. 

Desert consisted of the cast-iron skillet s'mores. I WAS IN LOVEEEE and a slice of Chocolate cake for my birthday which my son ate and loved it as well.",WRUBmTtsF0d4DVA9UMcHLw,0,0,4,cCajo8GLcNwVDvnhokwA6A

After drink orders were taken, we order appetizers,immediately, because of the time wait. We ordered the Oxtails Empanadas and the Devils on Horseback. The Devils on Horseback came out first - which were ok. The Romesco sauce was excellent. 5 minutes later the Empanadas came out. Which were basically shredded beef inside dough - which tasted mostly like dough (""Oxtail"" being the catch phrase). Blech! So Appetizers came out separately and took 20 minutes. I ordered the Super Mac w/chicken and my wife ordered the Hanger Steak Tartar. Mine was basically a white cheese Chef-Boy-R-Dee Mac-n-cheese with a grilled, no taste stringy chicken breast, and my wife's was a pickled nightmare of some eclectic vegetables and some type of ground beef (of which we could not decide).

I was in shock for a few minutes and thankfully recovered enough to decide on one of the unimaginative and equally unpalatable handheld items, or what these hip kids call sandwiches nowadays.

As an African American male with absolutely no ancestors involved in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, I was made to feel like I needed reparations after the prices charged for my meal and IPA draft.

The French Dip was a smidgeon better than what you could get at an Arby's here in Lansing, though in defense of the Home of the Horsey Sauce, at least with them you get some cheese of the genus chemical-byproduct with your sandwich, my French Dip was bare at Therapy.

The potato chips I received were indistinguishable from Lays' Truffle Oil ""recipe"".

I've been waited on by private chefs in Avignon, France's finest La Mirande, and have had widowers of late aristocrats in Monaco commit infanticide in front me and on their knees begging to have children from my superior gene-stock, so I know how to live and to enjoy.

This place is the loud and obnoxious, full of fools and their gold (I'll admit, I was one for one night).

We sat at the bar for brunch at 11:45 on Sunday. Not because there were no tables; there were only two parties seated at tables. As a bartender, I just prefer the bar. It's  a more relaxed environment all around, and usually, bartenders are more engaging. It's like you're a guest at their home.

Not at this place.

The first sign was when I asked a question about a particular drink. The response, ""You and I are going to have very different palates.""

Ya think?

The tone would be off-putting coming from a server with a French accent at French Laundry on a Saturday night; much less a bartender on Fremont Street before noon. With two ballgames on the TVs behind her, yet. 

I was a little disappointed at my 5oz wine pour -- but hey, I figured they're watching the bottom line, going by the book, so I had no right to complain... until I saw a solid 8 oz pour go to a person at the other end of the bar, and then 2 more to diners at a table, that the server picked up at the server's station. At that point I'd finished my glass, so I had no case to make.

Speaking of the server, he got a serious talking down to by said bartender not once but twice in front of us. He handled it quietly, mindful of the fact that we were sitting RIGHT THERE. If this was constructive criticism, it was disguised as pure condescension. And we should not have been privy to it at all.

There may have been a manager on duty. If so, he was purely on top of operations; never once came by to ask how we were doing. He did stop by the couple a few seats down from us, upon whom the chef (or someone from the kitchen) also spent a great deal of time chatting. Even the bartender seemed to enjoy their company, because we saw her smile while doting on them (note: it's great when friends come see you at work, but never good form to have two distinctly different personalities: one reserved for friends and one for everyone else).

Let's talk food. Kale salad was fantastic. It's hard to make kale tasty, and this was a solid execution, in terms of flavors, textures, and presentation. The chicken meatballs were okay. The jalapeno pesto made the dish. The mushroom flatbread... I knew that this was not the way to go when I saw the ""flatbread"" was in fact puff pastry. But the flavors sounded so good, we went for it. And the flavors were terrific. But a rich, soft topping of mushrooms, egg yolk, etc. needs the sturdiness and crispness of a proper flatbread to make the dish work - not a buttery, delicate puff pastry that gets weighed down by the toppings.

I've been to Eat, Carson Kitchen, and Park many times, for any combination of great food, solid service, and fun atmosphere. With all three nearby, there is no reason to return to Therapy.",mbqMpRQikQX24vkwPr1nSQ,5,1,1,XryB7rA0gp6ECMuJGH-8Lg

503943,2015-09-21,4,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Went here for a lunch outing with a company I worked for during the summer. It was a few days after Therapy opened in July. I drove by Therapy this morning and was reminded of my awful experience and felt compelled to share. 

I walked by Therapy a few weeks before the lunch outing and heard Dead Kennedys' ""California Uber Alles"" blaring from their doorstep at 11 a.m., so I had a positive initial impression. 

Our party of close to two dozen was seated at a long table in the back. The decor was wood and metal and the kitchen was open which added to the homey, comfortable vibe. Two waitresses were taking care of us. I looked through the menu with my vegan lenses and narrowed it down to three items; a salad, a flatbread or a side. I wanted something filling with a variety of flavors so I decided on the summer squash flatbread and ordered it without cheese. I informed the waitress upon ordering that I cannot have meat or dairy and she said she was nearly certain my order would suit my needs, but if there was an issue she would let me know.

The entrees came out and the waitress informed me the dough for the flatbread contained dairy. Since the entrees had already arrived, I asked her what other menu items I could have. She frantically looked at the menu for a few minutes and suggested the mixed greens salad without Parmesan. 

I didn't want to waste any more time so I agreed. I was pretty disappointed since I was looking forward to something filling and toothsome. I remembered I had stashed a trusty and incredibly tasty Trader Joe's $3.99 vegan BBQ chicken wrap in the fridge at work the day before so I was less annoyed since I wouldn't have to be hungry for the rest of the work day. The salad was the most pathetic plate I've seen in a while. Half the plate was empty and the salad was dressed spring mix and a few radish slices. 

The owner came by after I had a few bites and asked the group which dishes everyone enjoyed. People replied with this and that and he asked one of my coworkers what he thought of the mac and cheese. ""I'm lactose intolerant so I couldn't try it,"" he replied. The owner said with a chuckle, ""Well you don't matter."" I saw a few people look my way and the owner quickly walked away from the awkward silence after his comment. 

I was taken aback and frankly insulted that a restaurant owner in downtown Las Vegas would say that customers who can't eat dairy don't matter. Even as a joke. The absence of vegan items, besides some overpriced spring mix, made a lot more sense after his comment. 

By no means do I think they need to do a menu overhaul. The dishes that came out looked very creative and fun (like the red velvet waffles and chicken), but in a neighborhood where you can get various dairy-free lattes, vegan nachos, vegan pizza and vegan donuts asserting people who can't have dairy don't matter is asinine.",SvOlEx_vKzAprIWnImOkvA,11,3,1,Nqk1Jb6kRWfCka3uXJtsaw

531281,2015-07-19,0,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Went in for a dinner tonight with my sister based on an article in a local magazine, our desire to try a new spot in town, and my knowledge of Chef Daniel Ontiveros and his super skills. Was able to make a reservation in the afternoon and were seated right away even though we showed up a bit early. The build out is extremely well done. One of the best new projects I've seen in the revitalization of Downtown. Trendy but still really comfortable. Our amazing server, Kyrsten, was helpful and answered all of our questions, making some recommendations but giving us plenty of time to talk out the menu and make up our minds. We liked a number of items on the menu and decided to do a tapas style share of everything we ordered and Kyrsten was super accommodating about it. We had the Oxtail Empanadas, Fire Roasted Corn, In the Gnudi ricotta bites, and Shrimp Scampi. As 3 of our 4 choices were apps or from the ""Social"" (or meant to be shared) portion of the menu, Kyrsten suggested we space them out so they didn't all arrive at once which we appreciated. The oxtail had great flavor and the wrappers were fried just right-not too hard or chewy. The corn was charred perfectly and though my sister requested to have the corn shaved off the cob and was told the kitchen wouldn't do it-it was so good she wasn't upset at having to eat it off the cob. The Gnudi was AHHmazing. It's a lighter and much more flavorful cousin to a gnocchi with a sauce that Chef Daniel outdid himself with! Just the right amount of sweet and savory all in one bite! We finished the meal sharing the smore's-I'm not a fan of smore's in general but wanted to taste everything. I made my sister give me my full half! It's sooo good! REAL marshmallows-not fluff, not bagged, but real, I'm assuming in-house homemade marshmallows browned to a satisfying crunch on top of a rich chocolate layer and a graham crumble. YUM!!  I would recommend coming down just to sit at the bar and have a late night dessert and drink if the rest of the sweets are as good as that one. I will say that I feel that the $$ price per person rating does not reflect a full dining experience here. Unless you only come in and have a non alcoholic drink and a sandwich/burger expect to pay more than 20 bucks a person. Our 4 shared plates tonight with no booze on our tab was $68 before tax and gratuity. I'm a local born and bred and have worked in the food industry for years so I have no problem paying for good food; just be prepared that you can easily drop $100 on a two person tab in this place. If there were any ""kinks"" or ""hiccups"" in their opening week or so, I believe they've worked them out because we experienced no issues.

The Smash I ordered was fine, just like a nice refreshing mojito with Bourbon.  But the drink my girl ordered was definitely made incorrectly.  She ordered a frozen drink, but it was more of a meal since she needed a spoon to actually drink it with the huge chunks of ice.  I'll give the bartender the benefit of the doubt since he was obviously new and was reading the ingredient list as he was making it.  But even I knew you had to blend the drink for more than 10 seconds.  

We decided to see if they could make something simple so we ordered a Jameson Ginger.  You cant' mess that up... Yes you can if you put all ginger ale and barely any Jameson.  I went back to ask for a bit more Jameson but he said it was standard pour and would charge me for another shot.  I was pretty surprised as we saw him make the drink right in front of us and he might as well has forgotten to put the whiskey in it.  This night was not starting out well.

We were sat 15 minutes later, around 8:00pm.  We didn't get our food until 9:20pm.  Even drinks were a difficult to get at our table as we watched them sitting at the bar, ready to be served.  We watched a family next to us leave after not being served after a while.  We were lucky we were in good company or else we would have definitely got up and left.

I ordered the Ricky Ricardo sandwich.  They should have just called it a Dijon Mustard sandwich because that's all I could taste.  The plantains were the best part of the dish.  Do not order that!  The Oxtail Empanadas were not memorable.

All night we had to flag down our server and we had wagers on the Over/Under on the time we would get our food/drinks.  The OVER won 9 times out of 10.  

I will not be returning to this establishment.  Whether they were understaffed that night or chef's were having an off night, this experience was one of the worse dining experiences I have had in a long time.

The bartender looked at me like I was crazy when I ordered; turns out, he has no idea what's on the menu posted at the door. Apparently he was so befuddled that he forgot to put in the rest of my order (it was two items). After I waited patiently for half an hour, my question about the missing dates was met with looks of bewilderment and utterances of ""uhhhh..."" The manager was around (his preferences in men obviated by the conformity in bar tender height, weight, facial hair and build), but was of no use. I love fried pig ears, but what the hell was that gummy pile of thumb sized batter sticks I was served? Not ears, I don't guess. And as for my missing stuffed dates, Firefly had never done anything but excellent by my account. It's worth the extra 10 minute commute from my apartment. I was so hopeful, but no, typical Las Vegas nonsense, too big for your britches. And that statement about booziness and vastness? Do better.

Update: 
Well, I attempted it again, last night, Friday, December 23. The website said they were open until midnight, with the kitchen open until an hour before posted closing. There were no corrected hours posted on the door. When we walked in at 10:15, we were told we could have drinks, but not food. A fairly predictable bit in light of my previous experience.

On the first night, I started with a Caesar salad (with bacon, which is a really nice addition).  It was fresh and delicious from the crispy croutons to the flavorful dressing with a twist of garlic.  Presented beautifully.  Then I ordered the chimichurri steak and parmesan fries.  The steak smelled funny to me, chemical-like and I munched on my fries (outstanding) until Mike came back.  I tasted one bite.  I explained to Mike that I thought the steak tasted like it had been cooked over a gas grill and had the flavor of lighter fluid.  I have probably sent back about 3 orders in my entire middle aged life, so I felt bad about it, but Mike was very reassuring and I had a new steak before long.  It was delicious, had a beautiful balance of some acid and some sweet (lime I think) and some smoky flavors.  It had been marinated and was perfectly cooked to the medium rare I love.  I ate every bite.  I did not care for the onion straws on top, they were rubbery.  But I had plenty to eat with the fries.

The manager stopped by my table to apologize and offered me new fries with my steak (very nice but I declined as I had my fill even though they were amazing).  She and Mike were just concerned that I had a good experience and that I felt no guilt at all.  They both handled it beautifully and I felt so comfortable I went back the next night.

I ate more lightly the next night (I'm in LV for work and was by myself both times, at a nice table in this beautiful and elegantly simple- decorated restaurant.  I love the calm atmosphere.  Mike greeted me by name, which I found incredibly impressive and remembered I drink unsweetened ice tea.  The manager also came by and offered me a cappucino on the house-- very sweet.  I had the bacon wrapped dates which were an incredible combination with goat cheese and truffle and this to-die-for red pepper sauce.  Also filling, then I had dessert and the chocolate in the s'mores made me want to lick the plate, just the fix I needed.

When I return to Las Vegas, I will definitely visit Therapy again.  It does have something special-- human connection that you don't often find in restaurants.  I travel solo for business pretty frequently, and this is the first time in 25 years that I've been welcomed back like I'm a regular.  I very much appreciated that and the delicious food.  It was a great experience both nights I was there.  If Mike and the manager and the others who refilled my tea and checked on me as I was working on my computer are reading this, thank you.",UtHQVQU9pLbi-M44MoD2iw,0,0,5,ZQfJXAcUhJSjAACUBcD1fg

I had read a few reviews of the area restaurants and recognized Therapy as one that intrigued me. A quick glance at the menu posted outside and our group of four agreed it would be worth a try. 

The restaurant did not seem too busy but the manager/host asked if we had a reservation. It is never smart to assume that since there are empty tables that they are available so we would have completely understood if we had been turned away or asked to return at a later time. The manager however was accommodating and after checking with the server he seated us quickly. 

Our server was lovely and answered all of our questions and even made some recommendations when I couldn't decide what to eat. I opted for the red velvet waffles and chicken sliders and they did not disappoint. The red pepper remoulade was the perfect accompaniment to the dish and the slaw added balance and crunch. It was served with syrup but I found it unnecessary to add that sweetness to an already perfect dish.

My husband had the super mac and cheese with bacon and it was easily the best mac and cheese either of us have ever eaten. We will both crave this pasta.

Our son and his friend shared the veggie empanadas and the beet salad. The salad was beautiful as well as tasty and the empanadas were seasoned perfectly, the dough light and crispy.

We've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Vegas and Therapy has been added to our list of favorites. The service, food and drinks were all exceptional, we can't wait to go back again.",Cne3bj1NygqTHnR2hAKdAg,0,0,5,SMul-yth-Lr8X81qYcacRg

The popcorn was a disappointment for $7..way to small of a portion.  Empanadas were average.  Steak Tar tar was outstanding and all the flavors meshed well together.  Mac and cheese was also a hit.  In all, the appetizers were solid but the portions were too small for the price.

Draft beers - Not sure if it was me but the draft beer glasses looked to be a 12 oz pour and should be 16oz pints.  Also the wine and cocktails pours looked short..mgmt please review.  Strip maybe can get away with this but not downtown.

Entrees were spot on.  I had the best kale salad ever, and im normally not a kale salad fan.  The Char took it to another level.  Everyone else at the table was pleased with their entrees.  Burger, French Dip, Flat bread, and Caesar salad from what I remember

Desserts were to die for.  Had the Smores and the carrot cake which the server talked us into.  So glad she did because its not your typical carrot cake...much better and executed.

The service was perfect and the staff was always there if you needed anything without being intrusive.

The waiter was friendly and genuine. But they must have been short handed because he (and one overworked bartender) was the only person serving the entire restaurant at lunch. So of course the wait time was unreasonable. And of course we had  hard time flagging him down. But that was a staffing issue. Not an issue with the staff. 

Sadly, the food was just okay. The greatest disappointment of the meal was that they served the same aioli on most of the dishes that we ordered: mac and cheese croquettes, chicken and red velvet waffles (pass on this dish), and the oxtail empanadas.   

I enjoyed the texture and crunch (there was lots of crunch) to the dishes, but there were no real distinct flavors to anything. It seems to me that they have a few standout dishes (that tomato soup) and the rest is just the newest take on faux-hipster.

First, service & atmosphere were great. Coffee was great- some of the best I've had. My dining companion had the salmon, which she said was amazing-- although for $19, the portion seemed a bit small.  Unfortunately, I was NOT a big fan of the ""Charred"" Kale Salad. Kale was sauteed, not really charred (and I've had charred spinach and kale at other restaurants so I had some expectations about how it would be prepared). It was not cut into manageable pieces and was chewy. Very hard to eat (thank goodness I was eating with a friend and not on a date). And I think I counted about 4-5 small beets in the entire salad.

We were seated immediately by (presumably) a different employee. 

The food is either family style with tapas small plates or they also have individual plates as well. We decided to go the tapas route, and ordered the Pesto Chicken Meatballs, Seared Brussel Sprouts, Oxtail Empanadas, & Tuna Tartare. They were all good but honestly the brussel sprouts were my fave. The kitchen forgot to bring us out the chicken meatballs so they came out late--after some prompting. Our waitress felt so bad, we got a Carrot Cake on the house. 

If you're coming here for drinks, they're a little pricey.. $13 on average for a mixed drink. Which, to me, is a little steep for not being on the strip. They were tasty though. The Smash was delicious! The Life's A Peachy was too syrupy sweet for my taste, but reminded me of a sweet wine cooler. They have an impressive whiskey and wine list, as well as a decent beer selection.

For starters, everyone was pleasant, from the hostess to waitresses to bartender. I decided to order three appetizers and a salad for the table to share.

The crab dip and oxtail empanadas were delicious to say the least. Both were cooked to perfection where they had a slightly crispy exterior. However, the crab dip was an amazing consistency to the point it was velvety, while the oxtail inside the empanadas gave a tender, buttery filling. As for the salad (we got the Therapy Signature) it was fresh, tasty, and oh so colorful!

The only disappointment was the ""In the Gnudi."" It's an appetizer with baked ricotta and toasted walnut bread with some fancy sauces included. However, it was too sweet, especially as an appetizer. It seemed much more fitting as a luxury dessert of some sort, so we didn't finish the plate. 

Small note: The restaurant was loud (like really really loud) to the point where we couldn't hear each other across the small table.

To make this short and sweet, I was having severe dizziness and almost collapsed walking around downtown Vegas (particularly Fremont St) with family on the Monday before Thanksgiving and I happened to walk into this establishment to sit down and see if resting for moment would help me. 

The first bartender provided me with some water and said I could sit there for as long as I needed. My headache, dizziness, and numbness in my body was getting worse, and I was getting super worked up about what was happening with my body, and I know the staff could see it was taking a toll on me and my family. The second, and extremely helpful bartender came up to us and offered some kind of drink (with bitters) to see if it would help me and told me that I should probably sit in a comfier chair by the window to relax more. It seems like she notified the general manager about what was going on and the GM made her way over to us. She knew I was suffering and told me that I could go upstairs to lay down if I wanted to, in which I respectfully accepted. We went upstairs and she accommodated me in EVERY way possible to make me feel better. She moved the tables a bit so I could get by and lay down on the flat booth seat, brought me several large and soft-ish packages to lay my legs on to keep up high than my head in case I was low on blood sugar levels, and the bartender brought me some small eats and some water and orange juice. We were just blown away by how amazing and caring these individuals were to me and my family, and for the entire (almost) 2 hours that I rested there, I felt that I was basically pampered and being cared for as if I was some sort of royalty who had a panic attack, lol! 

I mean, even the bartender called her friend who is a nurse and let me speak to her on her cell phone about what I was going through! Just absolutely so grateful to have accidentally gone into this place because I know 100% had I walked into anywhere else around this area, nothing would have compared to the treatment I got here. 

Both Maria (the GM) and this lovely bartender took amazing care of me, and I deeply appreciate their willingness to calm me down, help me out in anyway possible, and honestly leaving such a good impression on their establishment. I will DEFINITELY come back here to dine in or have drinks the next time I find myself in Las Vegas, because I feel that I owe them big time for everything that they did for me. Writing a nice review is the least I can do for such an amazing establishment whose people cared for me in a time when I needed some comfort and help. 

Although I did not officially dine in here, I do have to note that the mashed potatoes that they brough me were delish (even though it sat for a while I wasn't even eating) and the drink with the bitters was all of the rave from my family. They all loved it! My dad and brother both ordered a few beers from the bar so I'm sure they enjoyed their time there too while I suffered, haha. 

Nonetheless, if any customer has the pleasure of meeting Maria and the nice bartender, know that you are in great hands. I have restored faith in humanity, especially in a city like Vegas where one would not typically expect such great hospitality due to the negative connotations people perceive Sin City to be like. 

Well, I certainly didn't make this short & sweet, but I just want to say again, thank you SO much again for everything! I truly do feel that Therapy certainly fits your restaurant's name (how ironic).",f2ba-VDOpatAnuDef-KlKQ,2,2,5,TpcxPnmWOjG1Xpr35Fmm8g

My husband loved the pork chop and appreciated the gluten free designations on the menu. The only blip and a bad one was the duck confit.

So the good folks of Therapy make this chicken and red velvet waffles slider dish... go ahead and get that because it is delicious! I never knew how important red velvet waffles were until I had them.   They are typically served with the slaw on the sandwich, but I opted to have them on the side just in case the flavors clashed - they definitely didn't and I definitely ended up adding it to my slider. The chicken was perfectly fried crispy on the outside. 

I also ordered a side of french fries. Typical quality bar fries but also complimented the red velvet waffle fried chicken extravaganza well. 

I do not recall the beer selection being anything to freak out about... but at least they have a selection I guess. The atmosphere is very chill... the staff didn't seem rush-y or anything... but not exactly super welcoming at first. Maybe because we stormed in as if we had been stranded outside with no water for a year... I'm not sure. 

Definitely worth stopping by and grabbing a bite. I'd recommend making a dinner night of it.

My friend is gluten-free. Not in the ""I'm a hipster and so I think being gluten free is cool even though I don't know what gluten is,"" but in the actual ""has weird body reactions can't process gluten"" type of gluten-free. Therapy has many gluten-free options so we decided to go there. WELLLLL my peeps, she orders an entree CLEARLY MARKED GLUTEN-FREE and then when our food is about to come out, our server asks whether my friend is actually gluten-free BECAUSE THE SAUCE IN THEIR GLUTEN-FREE DISH HAS GLUTEN. This was after my friend confirmed before ordering that the entree was entirely gluten-free. So, that's a MUY BIG PROBLEMO, seeing as how you're representing that a dish does not contain a certain ingredient, but in fact it does. And that certain ingredient can cause health repercussions. Can someone say lawsuit? I mean, would you say that a dish doesn't contain nuts (for the nut allergy peeps) and then later when the food is about to come out ask if it's okay that it has nuts?? NO WAY JOSE. That would be a personal injury attorney's dream. And then, their solution is that my friend eat it without the sauce bc ""it's still juicy"" and the other entree she tried to order would take 30 mins. I CANT EVEN. Also, it was not juicy and it was bland. So bye Felicia. That's my story. /endvent

The good part: the drinks are good and my food was good but overpriced f'sho. I'm just glad I'm not gluten intolerant.",KRUfX3aZdOV2sLigsTpAAw,1,0,3,gN0VREko6S2u8gQ0EruEnw

Came here after the Bridal Spectacular event for a late night meal with the family. Has been on my bookmarks list for the longest time, and we had originally planned to go somewhere else across the street, but they had decided to close earlier than what was advertised (on Yelp). Anyway... 
Food was delicious. My family liked Therapy's Crab Dip (2 orders) in particular. If I remember correctly, we also had about 4 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, Empanadas sampler, Chorizo Empanadas, Soup of the Day (chicken and veggies with added noodles), ""Ricky Ricardo,"" Filet Tartar, Sliced Chimchurri Steak, and the French Dip. Everyone pretty much shared their food fares. I should add that it was done only out of courtesy XD 
Customer service was decent, but I think they might've just been extremely busy. Other than my family of 8, there were 2 other large groups around 10-11:30PM dinner service. I was happier than most in my family, but hey... It's Downtown on a Friday night, and we decided to come here last minute. I just really appreciated how patient Jonathan (sp.) was, and how he respected my wish to pick up the tab XD

It does not look roomy from the outside, and is easy to miss, but the interior is surprisingly spacious and elegant. They open at 11:30 am, and by noon they are almost at capacity. We were seated in one of their comfy booths and ordered drinks from our friendly server while we waited for the rest of the party to arrive. 

The lunch menu is limited to sandwiches/burgers, a few salads, and some signature dishes. I am not really a fan of chowing down a burger while trying to carry on a professional conversation, and that along with sandwiches seemed to be the primary focus of the menu.
I saw the sign outside claiming ""award winning"" oxtail empanadas. I am starting to quickly learn that ""award winning"" anything on a menu will not meet the expeactions and the oxtail empenada were no exception.

I opted for the burger and it was just a burger. The highlight was my husband's chicken and red velvet waffle slider. It sounds odd but it was a great combination of flavors that made for a delicious, hearty option.

1850335,2015-06-22,9,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"I'm excited about this new place! So far based on the two drinks I had, the service, and the environment, this place is getting 5 stars! Grabbed drinks here while waiting for a table at Le Thai, and our experience was delightful. 

We sat at the bar and perused the cocktail menu. There were so many interesting, scrumptious sounding drinks to try, but I went with the Piña Colada, my favorite. This one had a particular appeal because it included banana liquor, which I thought would be a nice touch. My husband ordered the Smash. Both of the drinks were so unique and refreshing. Not super sweet and not super heavy. Very light, delicate flavors and very beautifully presented (see photos for presentation obviously). 

The service was great. Our bartender was very friendly and willing to answer all questions about the menu and was just an all around cool person. He had a lot to share with us about the chef, the inspired food and drinks and just regular human conversations. As we were walking by the window of the restaurant a few hours later, he waved at us. The fact that he remembered us is huge for me. When I worked in the restaurant business it was rare that I could remember a person. But he did. It means a lot to be treated like new friends than just customers. 

Piña Colada: I love this drink. I am always ordering Piñas and this one was very different from the Las Vegas poolside original. It was not super sweet and didn't feel like I was drinking a milkshake (which is a good thing in this case). The banana liquor added a different dimension to the drink and gave it an added tropical feeling. They finished it off with some shredded coconut on top, and i think there was some in the bottom of my drink as well, which was a nice surprise at the end. All in all, I really loved it. 

The Smash: This one has all the things my husband loves ""smashed"" into one glass. The fresh blackberries muddled in the bottom of the glass with fresh mint leaves creates a refreshing, light, sweet combo. Its almost like an adult blackberry lemonade. It is one of the fan favorites so far. My husband loved it as well. 

We didn't have a chance to try the food yet, but I took a glance at the menu and there are about a million things on there that I would LOVE to order. So I will be back and add to this review, for sure!",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,14,12,5,3f_X5Fy3Bxu4_-UEZixSvQ

The Smash coctail with bourbon, black berries, mint, lime etc. was delicious! Ordered a second. We ordered from the Social menu. The beef tartar was yummy and made even better with the pickled turnips, cauliflower and pickles. We also ordered the ox tail empanadas.  The ox tail was sumptuous but I always prefer empanadas baked not fried. The baked Califlower with dates and curry was like a meat dish. Be sure to eat the mint with it. Takes the flavor over the top.

It was too early in the day to drink, so I popped in for some apps: the Social Club portion of the menu is tapas-style but the portion sizes don't really lend themselves to much in the way of sharing.

OXTAIL EMPANADAS: Delightful outer shell, great flavor on the actual oxtail, but it was a bit on the dry side. Those corner bites where the grease and juices collected were pretty great, though. This was served with a harissa-lime crème fraiche dipping sauce that had more color than flavor and did not add anything to the flavors of the dish itself. 
HANGAR STEAK TARTARE: A passable classic version, but not one of the better ones in town. Good selection of pickled veggies, four crisp slices of grilled bread, and a reasonable portion, but not something I'd necessarily get again.

Even with just the two dishes I tried, the menu shows some promise. I'll have to come back with a few friends to try more, particularly the In the Gnudi, as my dining partner this visit is unable to eat ricotta.

It's mainly American fare in a dining room that is unique and not generic. Although I understand their mixed drinks are excellent, we didn't have any. 

Instead, we focused on the food starting with the ""In the 'Gnudi'"", an interesting dish of baked ricotta and fig jam. I loved that it was different than anything I've had in the past but it was also well prepared. Even though this place is known for its tapas, this is the only one we really had. Afterwards, we jumped into the entrees where I had the chimichurri steak. I have a hard time saying 'no' to this dish and for good reason! In this case, it was perfectly prepared (medium rare) and seasoned equally as well and the portion size was healthy. We finished off with the recommended carrot cake, which absolutely didn't disappoint and probably could have been the highlight at many other restaurants.

The location is super cool because it's in downtown, although it might be a little hard to find parking. You definitely have to walk a couple minutes to the restaurant, you cannot just park in front of it. The service has been a hit or miss. The waitresses and hostess are always friendly, but I can't speak too highly of their attentiveness after being seated, but it is hard to blame them too much because it's always been so busy when I come in for a meal.  The ambiance is very urban and very cool, and it's nice that they have a bar! 

They have a lot of sharing food, so it's good for a group. Otherwise, it's a little pricier than I prefer to get my own meal. We got the empanada trio, which I would recommend! And the smores skillet is what keeps me coming back!",5rdF7DT7rRYOC70rl1-bTA,0,0,4,hjStb-sn8RQzQgiM4aCuVA

Ordered the following items including the price:
3 different empanadas (oxtail, veggie and spicy chorizo) $21 - they're very small. For 9 pieces, this is definitely a meal for one.
 
Super mac with bacon $13 - Therapy blend cheese. Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it was okay. When they said blend cheese, I was thinking more like mozzarella, ricotta, etc. Nope. Their house blend.

Crab dip $15 - Gluten free! Yeah I enjoyed this one except the most except the fact that the crab was too salty. Heart attack. Yum.

Chicken meatballs $13 - The green sauce on the bottom is jalapeno pesto. So yeah, it'll be spicy.

Crumbled carrot cake $10 - This is a joke right? You know how hard it was to eat crumbled carrot cake? I tried to fork it and it just fell apart. Still good tho, but I wouldn't eat this again.

So the bottom line is, it's a-okay. I wouldn't really go back here as it's not really worth the price for the small portions of food and okay tasting food. Service was subpar, it felt like a regular restaurant service.",oS2O8YQ31HTSTQgPQKc7Cg,2,1,3,UdsJvoGVMVLbS_FpuGoLdA

Once seated, our waiter arrived immediately, but only to ask us if our fourth person was coming. We replied with a yes, and before I could ask about the cocktails, he was gone. He returned just after our fourth person arrived. We all ordered drinks and they were moderately prompt with serving them to us. The cocktails come in short glasses. They were pretty tasty. but I believe they are a little skimpy on the alcohol. No big deal.
We ordered 2 appetizers / small bites: Dates and Chicken Meatballs, and 2 entrees: Chicken and Salmon. After about 40 minutes of waiting our waiter returned to apologize for the delay as they had a large party upstairs. At that time, I wasn't upset about it because we were having a good conversation.  Several minutes later I began to get irritated, especially since I had an empty drink. The waiter returned with the 2 entrees but didn't offer to refill our drinks. 1 entree was incorrect but he returned with the corrected item about 5 minutes later. About 10 minutes later, after the entrees were now cold, he returned with the appetizers. This was probably the most irritating part of my night. He did mention he wanted to bring out the entrees so they didn't sit under heat lamps, but our appetizers were simple and should have been made before the entrees. I wanted to order another drink and another small bite, but was scared I'd have to wait another hour. I expressed my feelings about the wait and he sent over the manager who gave us a 25% discount off the entire bill. That was kind of him and much appreciated. Overall the vibe is nice and the staff was kind. I just think they cannot accommodate for larger parties. Maybe it was an off night or they were short handed in the kitchen.

We went for a little tasting for a work event and it was enough of a tease, a good tease to make us want to come back for more. We got a taste of the carrot cake with brown butter ice cream, baked ricotta with fig jam on a walnut cranberry crostini, chicken meatball with cilantro pesto, gulf shrimp ceviche and summer squash flatbread. And upon arrival greeted with a delicious Cab. All very tasty!

Back for lunch the following day for a team lunch. I got the hangar steak tartare which the presentation was cute and liked the pickled toppings. Street corn was my favorite!! If you like bacon the popcorn mix is different and a fun appetizer.

I do recommend if you are going for lunch or a meal order the burger or French dip because the price you pay for a flatbread is the same and you get more for your money for a full sandwich.  Seems a little odd that you pay the same for a giant/good size burger or French dip and a small flatbread. The flatbread won't fill you up unless you have a bunch of other snacks. It's more of a pricey appetizer small plate, the middle section of the menu. It's good just not a meal if that is what you are expecting, so I think pricing is a little disproportionate.

You look at the longevity of restaurants in this city, for example, Lotus of Siam, Yama Sushi, the environment isn't so fancy but they know how to turn tables and deliver great quality. 

Our first impression into Therapy was inconvenience. We were walk-ins and the restaurant was 30% full and the tall woman with short, dark brown hair whom seems to be a manager greeted us with an abrasive attitude and asked if we had a reservation. We did not we said & I said do we need one and she whispers under her breath, yes. See we said we'd go elsewhere and she's literally saying out loud ""every reservation and times"" then grabs menus, no smile ever and drops menus. 

I've opened 2 nightclubs, 2 restaurants on the strip and that kind of attitude isn't going to cut it. Manager or not, some managers try to do to much. 

The food was sub-par but the meatballs were awesome but for 6 small ones, overpriced. The server room forever to drop the check too. For being such an inconvenience with no reservations you'd think they'd try to turn the table faster.",LNLMsRqQ3Rx9VzJ7LbaRkQ,3,2,3,Z6SdXHrDkTY6r3t2GuVSgw

Not the end of the world, however the restaurant was empty besides two people at the bar and one table that came in later.  A large party had cleared out right before we got there but this really shouldn't have had an impact on service.  

We spent the majority of our time waiting for Mauro the server to attempt to actually do his job, I don't know, check in on the drinks, maybe stop by before we were finished with two different appetizers....Never happened.  We had to flag down the poor busser for, water, to order food, to go boxes, the check. Probably the worst service we've ever had, we even tried to remember one time, one place that had worse service than this place.

The food wasn't so good that you'd dream about one particular thing they had on the menu or stop by with friends. Ever.  We had oxtail empanadas and the mac and cheese croquettes.  The first was just okay, nothing exceptional, the second was covered with spicy mayonaise, or aioli if you want the fancy name for mayonaise with something added to it.  It also came with a ""tomatoe jam"" which was more sloppy marinara sauce with too much sugar and a little bacon thrown in there for no apparant reason.  The fried chicken sandwich was dry and cold (it was acutally siting in the window for about ten minutes before it came to the table) with ""The Ricky"" a pathetic attempt on a cubano sandwich.

It would be worth the (probable) dirty looks from the kitchen just to try.

While our tab wasn't cheap, I felt the food was delicious enough to be decent value.  I'd go again in a heart beat.

2370684,2017-01-10,10,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"I had a few amazing first's at this little down town, urban eatery. My First Tartar and believe it or not... My First time trying Charred Brussel Sprouts. I know... how have I never ordered Brussel Sprouts at a restaurant. Well I will from now on! 

The Tartar was Filet Tartar. Topped with Egg Yolk Confit and Parmesan. Served with Pickles and Grilled Bread. This was so decadent, that even sharing, my husband and I did not finish it. It was very good, just too rich to keep going. The Pickles were a pleasant side pairing with the richness of the egg yoke. I would get this again but it might be a once in a year kind of thing for me. The Charred Brussel Sprouts were made with whole grain mustard and toped with Parmesan Cheese and Cashews. These little babies were a treat. Pop them in your moth and crunch down on pockets of awesomeness. These were gone in a matter of minutes, unlike the Tartar. Loved getting that extra crunch from the cashews. 
We finished our night of exploring new things with something we were very familiar with. Carrot Cake. Crumbled Carrot Cake with brown butter ice cream and of course layered with cream cheese. Nothing special but very good. I tried to take the baby carrot that topped the cake out with us for the night but my husband wouldn't let me. It was just so damn cute! 

Besides our meal we really enjoyed our 2 servers. I did not catch their names. Something I need to get better at. But it was a young man and woman that were personal and friendly. We very much enjoyed the atmosphere and set up of this place as well. Open layout with stairs that go up to what I think is a separate dinning area. Possibly for private parties I am assuming. And a very large high top bar area, where we sat. I can definitely see myself coming back next time I am in town.",el3TmKFEFzZOcNbCw2FNlQ,16,14,5,-M5a464KCwsRo3tSVsGfQQ

Our group is risky and trendy, so we were looking forward to try it out. Funny that most of us tried similar tapas & dishes, and ended up trying a bit of everything. The Cuban sandwich was not the typical, but this one was quite tasty. We also tried the meat ""empanadas"" (can't remember the name, if different), and they were also very good. Almost gave it a 5, a booth would have been better than sitting at a table next to the kitchen/ bathroom - wink. Enjoy :)",WXXm9sJc14RfCFiw7aA6nA,0,0,4,DLuDu0Fg7b7RDI0m-Cgu0Q
2394286,2015-07-03,1,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"So I am not sure what people are talking about when they are saying good value.  Does this mean that the portions are big, or the price vs. what you get is comparable to other DTLV?  Because that is not the case.  

First of all let me say that I am not the type of guy to walk into a restaurant and base it off of how much food you can serve up onto a plate...this is ridiculous and the reason we have major health and obesity issues in our fair country...well along with a lot of other reasons but it is a strong contribution.  Therapy has come into the DTLV area and with the first restaurant under the owner's belts it falls short on a few things.  

Let's focus on what they are doing right first, because I'm not here to bash, I'm here to help the readers make good decisions on their dinning experience and go to a place that is true to what you read.  The space is amazing.  Exposed beams that were stained walnut and were a discovery while demoing the room for the new restaurant, a brick south wall that ties in the exposed ducting and ventilation to make the place seem huge and open.  The place breathes and the 130 seats fit nicely within the walls.  Nothing is cramped, it was an impressive renovation and detail was attended to...nice job gents!  Chef Daniel Ontiveros who hails from Comme Ca as the Executive Chef in the Cosmopolitan has taken over the open window kitchen and has serious chops.  His menu has been sliced and diced though due to the size of the kitchen...which is the only thing in the restaurant that is small.  9 menu items have already seen the chopping block due to the sheer need for more space and prep.  On the DL he had more to his menu in the beginning and that was put by the wayside for a more ""American Tapas"" style.  What the Hell does that even mean...""American Tapas""?  They are more of a shared small plate style and do have a few larger entrees that look like they might fit into a more traditional meal style establishment.  The Bartender was super friendly and tried to guide me in the best way she could through the menu, although she really didn't have a good knowledge base of the beers they had and had no idea where to find them in the cooler....I actually had to point them out to her.  Not a big deal, but if you are new, and you have put all this money into a new venture, let's start paying attention to detail folks and train your staff.

The food...well it was good, nothing to write home about but tasty enough. But do you go to a restaurant to have just OK food?  I mean I like to walk away and be like, ""I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!""  which is how I felt about Carson's Kitchen and the newly changed menu at RCP, all in the same area.  The dishes were also a bit overpriced for Downtown. The asparagus, country ham and shaved Parmesan with a poached egg is what really tweaked my britches though.  I never send stuff back, mostly because I have worked in the food industry and there are some shady buggers in the back that get peeved and do not so nice stuff to the food...maybe not in these types of places but enough to make me worry just a bit..ever seen ""Waiter""...yea.  The soft poached egg came out, the first time, hard and not a bit of yolk to spill out over all the yummy goodness that I was expecting after the the GM prepared me for what was to come.  So, I sent it back and received a new one.....DAMMMMIIITTTTT!!!  It was the same bloody thing.  Ugh!!!! I asked the GM if they suveed their eggs or cooked them to order and he told me that they did them to order, and then proceeded to tell me that this was the way it should be even after telling me that it should run over the asparagus and soak into the dish like a pretty little yolk blanket (my words not his).  So I ate it and...well meh.  The Oxtail empanadas were pretty good though, the oxtail meat is braised apparently for 12 hours and the empanada dough is home made by the pastry chef in back who also does their bread in house. Chef Daniel came out to apologize for the mistakes and that made most of it all better for me, I love when a Chef has the newtons to come out and take the beating for what is being created in the back..good for you Chef.  

So, I will probably go back just to try it out and see if it all was just growing pains and I will bring a bigger wallet and maybe a rich friend to pay for it all.  The last thing is, Owners, please don't lurk, I know this is your first venture but creepy is not a good way to keep people coming back.  Thanks Chef Daniel I know you have the chops to make this place better, please, please don't let the menu fall into the Bar and frozen drink category of Freemont street, seriously guys...frozen drinks on your cocktail list...wow.",BDb9yKmRuFwl9Qs2ckyt7Q,3,2,3,DN35xEiuzmFBqUlaLDyaEw

The oxtail empanadas were great as well, full of flavor with a tasty dipping sauce to accompany it. The roasted street corn was pretty addicting, and I ended up eating some of my friends half because I liked it that much. The aioli mixed with Parmesan cheese went very well together. My friend loved the crab dip; it had a good amount of crab topped with melted parm on top with a side of tortilla chips. Chicken meatballs and brussel sprouts were good but not anything amazing. My absolute favorite of the bunch was the Devils on Horseback which was truffled goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. I love anything truffle and this was delicious.

We had a couple of desserts but their most popular one is the s'mores dessert and I can honestly say it was fantastic. Very rich and filling, but worth it.

For some reason, I always end up at Therapy when friends are visiting because it's just so easy so I guess this is a nice place to take out of towners. Parking this time was a b$6#@ but our waiter JASON was so wonderful as to give us an insider tip. Sorry, yelpers. I can't tell you the secret. Guess you'll have to go and ask JASON next time you're dining there. Thanks, JASON. You da best!

Between the 4 of us, with no drinks, our tab was around $90 before tip. No bad. 
We ordered the Oxtail Empanadas, Chimichurri Steak, Crab Dip, Caesar Salad and another salad. Can we talk about this Ceasar salad again? I don't know why but I am addicted to the Ceasar salad here. It's just so simple with just enough dressing. I think it's because they cut the romaine lettuce into perfectly bite size pieces. You know when you have to shove a big piece of lettuce into your mouth? It's just not cute! 

Anyways, I think this place is going to be on my regular list pretty soon. Thanks for a wonderful evening, JASON!

***

Honestly, I love this place because it's a cool hipster hangout spot. (I'm sorry if this is offensive to you) I love the warehouse feel with the high ceilings and ventilation ducts? I really don't know what those are for but it looks industrial and cool. And their chairs! Who doesn't love to have dinner while sitting in nice chairs! So important! I also like the waiters and bartenders here. They make strong drinks and are dressed REAL NICE. 

This scene is definitely my kind of vibe. This is a great place to catch up with an old friend for drinks and appetizers. A lot of it will be on the heavier side. One of the dishes we ordered was the CEVICHE. It was recommended to us but it wasn't my favorite thing. Guess I'm just used to the old traditional way rather than a new twist. All good, though. Everything else we had was spectacular, including my CEASAR SALAD. No really. It was a really good caesar salad. Just the way I expect it to be!",--ZNfWKj1VyVElRx6-g1fg,0,0,5,rPxzIBEClshqhI5utV4VEw

Our meal started with the crab & artichoke dip. Honestly, one of my favorite app's I've ever had. I could have ordered this as the appetizer. Another order for the entree. And a third order as my dessert. Gadzooks was it good! Rich & creamy, the blue corn tortilla chips that came with it complimented the dip perfectly. Buyer beware, it comes out like molten lava, but once it cools down you can't shovel it in fast enough.

For our entree's we shared the mac & cheese and a cheeseburger. Both were very good. I'd probably try something different on my next go-round as neither blew me away. The mac & cheese was really good. We ordered just the small side order portion. Per our waiter, it's exactly the same as the entree (and less expensive). The kobe beef burger was good, but a burger, not too exciting. I'd probably get a little more exotic with my entree next time.

For dessert we rolled with the Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding. Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share. Being totally honest, I was so full by the time this came out that my flavor sensors were probably stretched to their limits. It was a good dessert, the house made banana sorbet was definitely the highlight. I'd order this again for sure, but would have to be mindful of how much I ate beforehand so I don't tap out after a few bites.

So it's a weeknight, and most of Vegas is pretty quiet (no major events going on.)  So the wife and I set up an 8pm reservation at Therapy.  Our Uber dropped us off at 7:45, so we went up to check in.

We'll hang out front and people watch.  Well, 8pm comes and goes, and now its closer to 8:15.  So we wait for the mean hostess to head inside, and ask another one what the status of our table was.  When she realized they were late and heard what was said to us previously, she immediately took us into the bar and comp'd us drinks.  SWEET!  Unfortunately, this is the last positive thing that happened.

So we're now hanging in the bar, getting a little buzzed on empty stomachs, and after having several waitresses ask us if we'd been helped yet, and hearing that we had reservations, we FINALLY were seated at 8:45pm.  Our new waitress came up and took our order, along with another drink order (since our drinks were long since gone), and brought us our drinks rather quickly.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Every 10 minutes or so, another table would get a single plate.  The table next to us (a lady and her son) were in the same boat as us, and eventually they paid their tab and left after receiving just 1 or 2 items.  FINALLY, at 9:40pm, we received our first plate!  We scarfed it down, and then around every 5-10 minutes, another plate would come out.  I'm estimating this, because by now, I was pretty wasted after drinking for 2 hours on an empty stomach.  The food was mediocre honestly - roast beef french dip was bland, crab dip was boring, the charred brussel sprouts were fine but forgettable, the ""in the gnudi"" was frankly inedible (we left over half of it behind.)  In fact, the only thing we REALLY liked was the ""devils on horseback"" (goat cheese and almon stuffed dates), and it was the first plate that came out, so who knows if we were just so drunk and hungry that ANYTHING would have tasted good at that point.

The bartender was nice, but the wait staff was overworked and stressed out.  And while the main hostess was nice, her assistance was perhaps the most rude hostess I've ever met (we listened to her give attitude to other people too - it wasn't just us.)

In the end, there were no redeeming qualities for this establishment.  Don't ever come here.  There are too many good places to eat in Vegas (even within walking distance of Therapy) to support a business like this.",2GUjO7NU88cPXpoffYCU8w,5,0,1,HlKKAiuumLxOdzzMD8I4Zw

We did not have reservations but the two hostesses we extremely accommodating sat the two of us right away up front which was fun. The waiter Rene' was the absolute best! Very helpful, personal, and tons of fun. 
Therapy's drinks were amazing mostly bourbon bases with their own smoked version - they brought us a sample it was real smooth with a simple bite at the end and the bottle is gorgeous! 
Our food was spectacular the best we have had in Vegas - but that is not really giving it proper merit. The food was superb really have not been impressed with Vegas food until Therapy. The Crab Dip was out of this world good and Fried MAC Croquette with the tomato bacon jam was incredible! 
Now back to the drinks, I enjoyed The Smash so much that the hostess let me meet the bartender Michael who taught me how to muddle the berries and mint and make the drink for myself and yes they gave me that one on the House!

2616111,2018-03-21,9,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"To be quite honest, I didn't know this was more of a restaurant until I visited for the first time last Friday. I had assumed it was just another bar in the Downtown area.

I met my cousin here for a few drinks before going out and we enjoyed ourselves.

The simple décor gives Therapy a cozy yet modern feel- Brick walls, high ceilings, charming light fixtures, and visible air ducts. I like it all. There is a decent sized bar where we sat, a separate section with restaurant-style seating, and more seating on the second floor that overlooks the space. 

My go-to drink is always a rum and coke, but I wanted to try something different for once and ordered a Raspberry Rose from the Specialty Cocktails menu. Rum, fresh lime, fresh raspberries, and a rosemary garnish, I'd give this cocktail a solid 3 stars. It was tart as expected, quite refreshing, but where was the rum? A little disappointing, but still good.

I've never seen my cousin order anything but beer. He ordered a Heineken on tap and the bartender explained that they've been experiencing problems with the tap all day, so she offered him a bottle ($7) for the price of a draft. I thought that was really nice of her!

I appreciated the quick follow up, and of course was willing to go back and see how they could turn it around. 

My friend and I who were there the first time came back in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:30pm, and the 2nd time around was 100x better than the last (of course). It wasn't very busy, but our food came out very quickly, which I'm sure was not a coincidence since that was a huge complaint of mine last time. We each started with a salad, I with the charred kale and poached egg, and she with the caesar. We split the pretzel appetizer- the cheese mustard sauce is AMAZING. We split the side of mac n cheese (with bacon on the side for her, which was successful in execution this time), and then were surprised with FOUR desserts that came out. The fresh sorbets were a delight, I believe they were cherry, key lime, and passion fruit. The popular s'more cast iron skillet was among them, which was far too sweet for me, but she liked. The decomposed carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and brown butter ice cream was a pleasant surprise for me, and made a great breakfast the next day! The manager ALSO brought a chocolate ganache torte type ensemble out in a to go box, which was really just indulgent and over the top, but we appreciated the effort and it did get eaten a couple days later :) 

The food was much better, the service was great, and we had a chance to chat with the chef and management. Of course it was a comp meal, but not everyone makes the effort to remedy a bad dining experience, and they really went above and beyond to make sure we had a good time the 2nd time around, and the VP of Ops even followed up that afternoon with a phone call.

2699878,2016-01-24,0,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"*sigh* A bad experience. Did I upset the Food Gods? No idea but I sure did have hell of a lunch date! My date and I arrived at therapy around 2 o'clock to try the beautiful and delicious food we had previously discovered on Yelp. When we walked in we were immediately greeted and sat at a table. Our waiter was a beautiful young lady with dark brown hair that was also working the bar. She went over the menu with us because we were new customers, which I appreciate and took our drink and food order. The food literally took 30 to 45 minutes to cook because we had to leave right when the food came out to go pay for an additional hour for our parking. That was very inconvenient and a bit frustrating the fact that lunch was fairly empty but I guess that's what you get when you go to a restaurant that cooks fresh food. My partners ordered the famous burger and I settled for the red velvet waffle chicken sandwich. The host that greeted us at the door delivered our food. 

     My face frowned when I looked at my plate. The waffles were obviously very burnt inside and out having a black coating and a smoky smell. I immediately pulled out my phone and compared pictures on the same plate that other people had ordered on YELP & I noticed that everyone else is waffle was a bright red or bright pink color without the burnt glaze. My partner asked me, ""Are your waffles burnt??"". He waved down who seemed to be the manager on duty. Heavyset Caucasian male over to the table. I politely pointed at the waffles and asked to get a new batch because I received burnt waffles. I had already tried to scarf it down and cover it with mad syrup, but it did no justice. 

     What made me feel a certain type of way is the fact that the manager sat there and to my face explained that the waffles were not burnt and that they just come that way. The hell.... I don't know if he was trying to be funny or he was blatantly being an a****** looking me dead in my face telling me that these burnt rectangles are perfectly fine. I think he was trying to make me feel stupid!!! But he insisted on making a new batch for me. 7 - 10 minutes later I receive a new batch of red velvet waffles and just as the ones before had a charcoal coat. It. Tasted. Burnt and unappetising. I put all the waffles to the side and simply at the juicy chicken and left hungry. The bartender then came over to check on us. She asked his our food was, but before we could even answer she asked me "" Are those burnt???"" I shrugged and told her that the manager said they can't this way. She looked at the kitchen and said ""oh.."" And walked away with a scrunched face back to the bar. When we were done eating we never were given our check because our waiter, the bartender was busy. A birthday girl and her group came in and they ask wanted drinks. The manager is in the corner folding silverware and the host is upstairs, doing whatever. So we had to walk up to the bar to pay. We left no tip. 

I was jealous that my partner enjoyed his bomb ass burger and I had shitty food and questionable service considering I only eat at YELP 4-5/5 reviewed restaurants. I am willing to try this place again but I will come for dinner instead to avoid #1 Whoever the Chef was and #2 the manager.

The menu is very different from what I'm use to. There were many different items I had never heard of or tried. 

We decided to try the DEVILS ON A HORSEBACK -Bacon Wrapped Dates Stuffed With Truffle Goat Cheese & Almonds on a bed of romesco. 

We only ordered that item which was an appetizer and the server informed us it was going to take about 45 minutes to be ready. I didn't ready think it was worth waiting for but we wanted to try something new so we waited. When the appetizer arrived it was about 6 of the dates.

2860819,2016-01-04,0,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"My girlfriend and I ate here on New Year's Day (2016). We decided to try a new place and I keep a copy of Las Vegas Weekly's October issue where they did a round-up of the best eats in LV. Therapy's ""In the Gnudi"" dish was ranked as best ""small bites"". So, we took the trip down there.
First, the atmosphere is very trendy, but not unnervingly so. What I mean, is it's hip but if you aren't wearing your cuffed selvedge denim or lumbersexual attire, don't fret - you won't feel out of place. There was a mixed demographic of ages. Overall, it felt very comfortable in there.
The waitstaff was great, too. They were doing some drink specials but they said only if you were sitting at the bar (which didn't make sense to me 'cause ya know...I was there, right?). But our waiter said he'd honor the prices. So, I wasn't really sure why he even made a point of telling me it was only for the bar, when I guess it really wasn't but whatever...I got my $5 Blackberry Smashes (Bourbon, muddled blackberries, 7up me thinks, mint leaf, powdered sugar). The drink was really good. The bourbon mixed well with the other flavors. I had 3. Got a real nice buzz. Took part in a wedding ceremony at the Plaza later. Not my own. Like to think the booze guided me a little bit there. Another few, who knows...might've been my own.
As I mentioned before, we went for the Gnudi. Never had gnudi, but a magazine told me to eat it (the gnudi, not the magazine), so eat I did. It was really good. Baked ricotta balls with some fig jam and cranberry and walnut cristonis to spread it on. The jam with ricotta was a great taste. We also ordered and split the Red Velvet Waffle and Chicken Sliders and Oxtail Empanadas. Everything was great. The food wasn't cheap for the portion sizes, but, well, the food wasn't....cheap. It was all very good quality and I tend to like the smaller portion sizes that don't treat the American stomach like an ever-expanding balloon. I left full but not dragging my engorged colon behind me. With that said, the oxtail empanada portion (4x) was disappointing for the price of $12 (everything was $12). My girlfriend really, really enjoyed the empanadas. I thought the Waffle&Chicken sliders were the best followed by the gnudis and then the empanadas. However, this ranking is slightly arbitrary. Everything was good. 
Finally, a disclaimer: I am in no way a gourmand or foodie. Give me an overturned trash can lid and throw a pile of charred meat on it and I'll probably be happy. So, take my opinion of culinary delights with a grain of salt (or whatever seasoning foodies prefer).",ZLTHICnSurX7PxL9hgsF-w,1,0,4,_Ws-gGxaJViYwJxqt9xuIw

It's beautiful both during the day and night. The ambience is very classy urban. Almost as if you're stepping into a classy New York apartment type atmosphere in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. If you look up when you get inside, you'll know what I mean :)

2869911,2015-08-25,19,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"2nd review because therapy convinced yelp to remove my first...

Ate Beef Tar Tar likely cause of hardcore food poisoning. Left me on the toilet for days and I would have been hospitalized if I didn't have many natural remedies.. Liquid bentonite clay, kombucha tea, 50 billion 24 strain probiotics,  bee propolis , royal jelly, copious amounts of pink salt water for electrolytes, 
When my stomach finally calmed because of kombucha I began to be able to hold down some liquid ..I then became bed ridden with insanely ridiculous back and kidney pain and unbreakable fever left me in a pool of sweat  for 2 days. 

Explosive vomiting over 35 times and diarrhea. Massive fever as well by far the sickest I have ever been.. now 1 week later I have a severe cold coughing green phlegm incessantly for days.. Important to mention  have not had a cold or flu for over 2 years previous to getting poisoned by Therapy..

 I now wish I went to the hospital to gather evidence against them.  The reality was I felt too sick to get myself to hospital any way..

THESE MAMMALUKES are trying to cover up that they are getting people deathly ill.. let's see how long until they convince yelp to pull this too..

My friend who I ate with also got insanely sick. But not quite as bad as me.. he only puked and diarrhea for 12 hours or so. I guess that's what you call a lucky therapy victim..

Now for rhe food.  Beef tartar lacked seasoning was super bland and one dimensional.. 

Crispy pig ear is a gelatinous mess which is then coated in a thick batter and deep fried. A mushy and crunchy texture that kept my stomach turning for days just thinking about it..

Charcuterie board is a total joke. Super thin pathetic and definitely not unique selection of sliced cured meats which could be purchased from any deli. Accompanied by some standard pickles some mustard and toast points.  No one could make rillette, pate, lardo, brasaola something? That would be too much work apparently easier just to buy a meat slicer and purchase deli meats from grocery store. Absolutely zero creativity. 

Empanadas were the only item we thought were good but not great.

Service was decent at the bar however had to ask for multiple water refills. And when we inquired about wines by the glass we would have been better off asking a chimp.. 

I want to be clear  I am not basing my food opinions on any part of the fact i got deathly ill.

Avoid this place like the plague unless you do not value your life. Especially, keep away elderly or children as they would not survive a food poisoning like therapy gave me..

Last review therapy had yelp remove it.. if my massive food poisoning didn't now turn into an awful cold I probably wouldn't have bothered to rewrite this but thanks to therapy and unlucky for therapy I am now sick in bed again with lots of free time.",E3-bcRsTtyICecnHxJOGlw,12,4,1,x7Eu-GO_XXFPU9gu6V2M0Q

I will start by saying that two of the items we ordered were pretty danged good:  the oxtail empanadas and the chicken meatballs.  The rest, however, wellllllll let's just say very underwhelming.  We ordered the baked truffle ricotta ""In the Gnudi"" and although the cast iron skillet it was served in was screaming hot, the cheese itself was cold and hard and I was not a fan of the crostini that was served with it; too sweet when combined with the truffle and honey on the ricotta.  The lobster mac n cheese sounded delish as well, but quite frankly was bland and fishy tasting and smelling.  Took one bite and that was more than enough.  Lastly, we ordered the barramundi sliders, and again bland and fishy.  The kitchen should probably consider fresher fish offerings.  It reminded me of walking into a grocery store's meat department and smelling spoiled fish.  Not good.  The atmosphere is amazing however.  Love the high ceilings, brick walls, open floor and bar area.  And of course, it's hard to beat the setting of Downtown Vegas among all of the revitalized businesses and Arts District.  Maybe the kitchen was having an off night, I'm not sure, as this place didn't live up the reviews we'd read.

Normally this might have bothered me, but I actually found it to be a little fun.  

We ordered the deep fried brussel sprouts and the mac and cheese croquettes.  Since it was so busy, food was coming out slowly and we found out that the kitchen ran out of the  mac croquettes shortly before our table neighbors got what was probably the last batch delivered to their table.  My wife and I had a good laugh, because of course they'd run out and we'd have to watch the table next to us enjoy the last batch!   I'm not mad though, the deep fried sprouts were fantastic!  In lieu of the croquettes we ordered a side of mac and cheese, which was delicious, but since it was a side, didn't have any frills- but still very delicious.   

Service was good, despite the big crowds and the long waits, we were checked on regularly and taken care of well.  Overall I liked this place.  I think I will like it better if I ever get a chance to come here when it isn't packed, but I understand- it was a Saturday night in Vegas on a holiday weekend.

We were seated at the bar because the hostess told us happy hour was going on (20% off food, bar only). The tap list is pretty short but they have some bottle and can selections so I got an apricot hefeweizen from the friendly bartender. So far, so good! I should mention that this is around 3:30 pm and there are only a small handful of others at the bar. Then we ordered the empanada trio and crab dip - both came out pretty quickly. The empanadas were amazing! There were two each of the three different fillings: chorizo, oxtail, and veggie. The chorizo was my favorite but I would eat them all again! The crab dip was also really good, mostly cheese and artichokes (light on the crab), but it had good flavor and the accompanying chips were great.

We were finished with our food and we sat around waiting for awhile... and waited some more... and waited again for our checks. Finally we managed to get them but we wanted them split.

Up until the arrival of Therapy, the 500 block was, in general, ailing with poor service and an even poorer menu selection.  Taking over what used to be a dump of a gift shop, the space is now a complete gut-remodel with clean lines encompassing two levels of industrial quality finishes that are subtle yet appealing to the eye in a way that does not try to detract from what really matters in the space: quality ingredients prepared properly and served with attentiveness.

Grub selected: 

Soft Pretzel Bread - if you like soft pretzels as much as I do, one order won't be enough. 

Oxtail Empanadas - light, fluffy and filled with the tail of an ox; really, these are a great appetizer. 

The Perfect Cure - a very nice selection of cured meats, mustard and pickled vegetables; it is artery-clogging and healthy all at the same time. 

Hangar Steak Tartar - large portion of chilled minced 
beef with egg yolk and cheese on top. Comes in a nice mason jar type container to distract you from the fact that this is as close to puppie chow as you may be willing to get; fork optional, just how Fido eats works too. 

Cast Iron S'mores - more of a baked dessert casserole than traditional s'mores but very nice nonetheless. I'm a traditionalist: s'mores should have milk chocolate not semi-sweet as these do. 

Trio of Sorbet - the s'mores casserole didn't leave us feeling gluttonous enough so bring on the cherry, orange and key lime sorbet!  ""House-made"" and tasted delicious while being washed down with...

THE SMASH! - Four roses bourbon, blackberries, fresh mint & sweetened lime. Everyone on East Fremont is [trying] to make smashes; Therapy happens to know how to do it right.

Giving Carson Kitchen a run for their money...competition (and selection) is a good thing. May the best man win.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,5,7,4,9um1cRpbvZiXxBTD4V6MWg

There are many options in Vegas for an ""upscale"" bar food experience, but sadly most of these spots fall pretty short when it comes to delivery. Therapy isn't reinventing the wheel here, but they are making a better, tastier, and more attractive place to hang with friends. 

The location is great, smack dab in the middle of a bustling Downtown Las Vegas great for both tourist and locals alike. I came here after attending the Las Vegas Film Festival and instantly loved the decor and flow of this place. There are no walls in the place, you can literally see into the bar, kitchen, and upstairs dining area from anywhere on the lower level. 

My guest and I weren't super hungry so we went with a smattering shareable food items found on the, ""Social Club"" menu section. The Oxtail Empanadas, The Chicken Meatballs, Roasted Curry Cauliflower and Mixed mushroom Flatbread. 

From the best to the not so best... The Oxtail Empanadas, our server Georgie suggested these amazing little pockets of tender meat. Lite crispy pouches filled to the brim with slowed cooked shredded meat, a must order! Thanks Georgie! 

The Mixed Mushroom Flatbread. Mushrooms, truffle oil, cheese, all on flattened puff pastry. This was a little heavy on the truffle oil, but was still very tasty. I really enjoyed the bacon cut into cubes rather than diced strips. Comes with a soft boiled egg for all that runny goodness! 

Roasted Cauliflower. Solid curry flavor especially when paired with dates. Cooked perfect with a light snap as you bit into them. 

The Chicken meatballs were just ok. They were a tad bland and dry, so thank goodness it came with a cilantro pesto. I pretty much had to drown the meatball in this tasty sauce. This might be a one-time thing so maybe I'll try this on my next visit. 

This place is definitely worth a try even if you just pop in for a quick cocktail and snack.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,14,15,4,CEUtst8KGD65VyG5wbRu5Q

The restaurant sports a very clean and modern look with plenty of open space. We were seated in the upstairs dining area, which offered the perfect perspective to appreciate the design of the place.

The staff was very accommodating and had no problems making a change to our order after it was placed. We decided to go with a few options from the sharables ""The Social Club"" portion of the menu. The dishes were a bit on the pricey side, but they were also very tasty.

FOOD
Oxtail empanadas: These were so moist and delicious. I only wish there were more of them for me to devour. My girlfriend and I had to split four empanadas between us.

Super mac (with bacon): This was some of the best mac and cheese that I've had in a long time. It was pure cheesy heaven! And even more so than with the empanadas, I really do think the portion size of this dish needed to be larger. I could have easily eaten the whole dish by myself.

Chicken and red velvet waffle sliders: This was yet another amazing dish. The chicken was especially juicy and the waffles actually tasted like red velvet cake. There could have been more syrup provided though.

Charred kale salad: This was the only dish that we didn't particularly enjoy.

DRINKS

The Smash!: According to the waitress, this is the most popular cocktail. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. There was a certain bland, watery aftertaste to the drink.",jsu8iKgjn-mrDuuJ1juXJQ,2,0,4,8e3oQ-qDUGEhqcCCuw0rKQ

Lighting was dim and later on I wasn't sure if my eyes adjusted to the lack of light or they made it brighter... Anyway, really cute metal pieces of art and lovely chandeliers along with a clean bathroom. There is a long bar that's all along one side of the wall with 3 TVs I believe. There's also a few tables upstairs and some comfy looking booths on the first floor.

Our server suggested that we share about 3 tapas per person but we each wanted our own entrees and decided to order the Mac and cheese with lobster and the Brussel sprouts. My friend and I split the French dip and a chimichurri steak. We were told that the steak usually comes out medium, which is how we prefer our steaks anyway. The two guys in our group ordered another chimichurri steak and a portobello mushroom burger.

2/5 My French dip ($16) came with truffle chips. The chips were a bit oily and had a very subtle truffle taste. I enjoyed the chips but could only eat a handful before I got tired of them. The French dip sandwich itself was lacking cheese. While the meat was nice and soft, it was also missing pickles or something. It got boring very quickly. 

 1/5 we were recommended the chimichurri steak ($25) and we all agreed that it was SUPER chewy. The steak I shared was also done medium well, while my friends' steak was done medium. The chimichurri sauce was ok, but The entire table was very disappointed in the steak. I would recommend something else on their entree menu, but if you do order the steak, be sure to order a side salad!

My friend liked his portobello mushroom burger, and he said it was good how it was. 

2/5 ma and cheese with lobster ($19). What I liked was that there were actually lobster chunks on top of the ma and cheese. The dish itself was creamy but needed a more cheesy flavor to it! I thought it was just me but again, the table agreed. 

2/5 charred Brussel sprouts were semi charred and pretty soft IMO. It was missing a sauce but overall it was good.  

Presentation wise, everything was beautiful. Our water cups were constantly refilled. The total for everything including a Stella ($7), a mango drink that tasted like a margarita ($12) and a chocolate stout ($11) was around $150 for 4 people.

The establishment was clean and well staffed. The service was excellent and the food, well what can I say, the food was really, really good. Not too over the top, not too mainstream but rather a new fresh look at basic favorites. The cocktail I ordered was well priced for top shelve and the bartender actually knew how to make drinks properly. Therapy does not try to be something it is not, its basically great tasting food in a very nicely decorated space with a management and staff interaction you would expect in higher level establishments. Understand your clientele and deliver good service and food. These guys (and gals) definitely know what the public wants and its refreshing to see for once, in Vegas a place that knows how to deliver!

Be sure to try the sauce that they come with. The devils on horseback were also delicious, as was the crab dip. To be honest the brussels sprouts were not memorable. The ahi poke was strange to me. It was mixed with watermelon, which I think served more as a filler than a flavor enhancer. I would not order it again. To top off the evening we ordered the s'mores for dessert. It comes with crumbled bacon on top. It was odd, but surprisingly good. It is a very rich dessert so unless you have a HUGE sweet tooth or are still very hungry I would recommend sharing it.

3167858,2015-09-03,3,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"It's neat to see what Therapy has become, especially considering where it started. What used to be a complete dump of a horrible tourist gift shop is now one of the nicer lounge type restaurants in the area. Not only does Therapy have a full bar if you're looking to just stop in for a drink, but there are dining areas both downstairs and upstairs. It's another great example of the revitalization of downtown.

Our first visit here was a somewhat short one. We had just finished dinner around the corner, and decided to stop in for a drink. Alongside a handful of beers on tap, they have a few signature cocktails and house-made sangrias. For the ridiculously hot days in Vegas, they even offer some frozen drinks. I decided to give The Smash! a shot after hearing good things about it, but unfortunately wasn't a huge fan. The bourbon was there, but not much of it and completely masked by the blackberry and sweetened lime. 

On our next visit, we sat down with a party of about 10 and ordered up about as much as we could on the menu. Much like the direction many new restaurants are taking, Therapy has two sections of the menu called ""The Social Club"" and ""Bites"" which focus on shareable plates. Of the 15 items between the two sections, we ended up ordering 10 of them.

A few things that stood out for me were the Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle Sliders, Shrimp Ceviche and the Hangar Steak Tartar. The chicken and waffle sliders are actually pretty big and if ordered alone could probably be a dinner for some. I liked the large, juicy piece of chicken and the mild sweetness from the waffle. It also has a spicy remoulade that adds a nice little kick. And while the ceviche was real heavy on the tomato flavor, but mild on the citrus, I still enjoyed it. It was fresh, bright and flavorful. As far as the tartar goes, I think i was one of the few at our table who enjoyed it. I haven't had tartar at many restaurants, but I liked the seasoning in addition to the egg and crispy grilled bread. 

We didn't order a whole lot from the larger plates, but we did have a couple items that are worth mentioning. The Charred Kale is an excellent salad that was really one of the top items of the night. It had amazing flavor and I loved both the fresh egg and bacon smoked bacon vinaigrette topping it. Another surprising favorite was The French Dip. This sandwich is not the typical dry bread, low quality meat and oily ju that you find almost everywhere else. The flavors were spot on, the meat was tender and juicy, and the sandwich as a whole just had the right amount of heat from the horseradish. It's also served with crispy chips that have a present, but deliciously addicting truffle flavor. 

To finish out the night, we ordered 3 out of their 4 desserts. The Cast Iron Smores was crazy sweet, and could definitely benefit from a little more bacon to offset that. Both the Crumbled Carrot Cake and Pure Decadence chocolate cake were much better, but still probably not something I'd order again. I did really enjoy the brown butter ice cream though that was on the carrot cake, and would probably order that alone if it was offered.

Because we ordered nearly 20 items from the menu and only a few were things I'd come back for, I don't think I'd rush back. We also had less than stellar service. For whatever reason, our waiter forgot to put in an order of the Cheddar Mac & Cheese, which was something quite a few of our party was anticipating. She admitted to forgetting it, but after asking her to still put the order in, she either forgot again, or blew it off. This was basically towards the end of our meal too, and we had already asked for it twice before that. Shortly after, we watched another table next to us get an order of it, then our table was cleaned off and she started asking about dessert. Luckily she remembered to take it off the bill, but it was still frustrating to miss a dish that was asked for multiple times.

After 2 visits, I'm still a bit torn on Therapy. They've definitely got a lot to offer, and it's another great addition to the ""New Downtown"", but some things just fall a little short to bump this up to 4 stars.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,9,5,3,WXXiUCKXzvb1E-efc12ZPA

  The food is good and atmosphere is pleasant, but I do have a few quibbles to air. Cole slaw with chicken and waffles is a nice idea but poorly executed here ( either too old or too finely cut to maintain any texture) the French dip has some of the finest meat available (and I'm a butcher) but the Demi (not au jus) is straight up number 10 can of knorr powder. Grilled carrots are uninspiring and over use of arugula garnish plagues many dishes.

We placed our order for the wagyu burger and French dip sandwich (approx $20 each), both came with sides as well. We also ordered Brussel sprouts to start as well. The burger and Brussels came to the table and the server came by and apologized that she forgot to put in the French dip order to the kitchen, and she was putting it in now.

Therapy is a very hip restaurant in downtown Las Vegas.  The crowd is definitely working class and the prices reflect that, with each tapa/meal costing around $12-15.  We came to Therapy to try a few dishes and settled on the mushroom burger and brussel sprouts.  The bad part was that it took about 45 minutes for the meal to arrive.  Considering it was 9:45 when we were dining, this rubbed me the wrong way.  Still, the mushroom burger was excellent and unique, while the brussel sprouts weren't anything to get excited about.  The drinks ranged from $6-10 for beer, wine started at $9, and cocktails around $12. Actually a very good beer selection, though prices were a bit high even for Fremont. Therapy is definitely a destination type of restaurant and not an every day Happy Hour joint.

3341115,2017-12-29,4,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"I was really hoping this place would warrant a five star review. It's close to work and part of the revitalized area of Fremont Street downtown near the Fremont Street Experience. I had a lunch date with a few friends and co-workers I hadn't seen in a while, so I was primed and ready to go. A short walk through the brisk mid-morning air had us all hungry and ready to get our grub on. We arrived shortly after their 11:30 opening time and were the only patrons in the restaurant. We were seated promptly and that's where the promptness ended. 

I never figured out if one of our waitresses was in training or if there just wasn't enough to do, but multiple servers for our party of seven added to the confusion and lengthy lunch. The menu referenced ""lunch"", but the lunch specials are not listed on the menu. Had a few members of our party not been there before, I don't think we would have known about the lunch specials listed on the Therapy website. I opted for the French Dip lunch special which consisted of half a sandwich, french fries and a soda. The quality of the food is what is keeping this review a float. The french fries were outstanding and the French Dip was packed with meat and flavor. There is no ketchup on the table, so you are at the mercy of your server to put it in one of those little stainless steel cups and place it on your plate. Somehow I managed to be the only one who missed out on the ketchup. DL quickly rectified the situation and requested some from the server. Although the server took my soda order, it never arrived, and by the time I got her attention, the meal was winding down.

Our party was fairly diverse when it came to lunch choices with everything ranging from the Beet Salad, to the Chicken Fried Sub and the Super Mac. The lunch special, after tax, was just north of ten bucks, so this kind of Therapy won't break the bank. TD ordered a salad with his Super Mac, but probably should have just ordered dessert instead, as the salad must have been hanging out with my soda, as it too arrived at the end of the meal.

I will be back for another round of Therapy and hope any kinks they may have had with the service are worked out. If you are headed there for lunch and have any sort of time constraint to make it back to work, you might want to seek alternatives or at least be prepared to come up with some excuse for the boss man on why you are late. From arrival to departure we were there is excess of 90 minutes, much of which can be attributed to the service.

Bar staff was excellent. Very attentive. Manny was the guy, but I didn't get the name of the girl. Both were great, even though it was a very busy night. 

We started off with the steak tartare. I loved it. They only brought out (4) Crostini and that was definitely not enough. Luckily, they had no issue bringing us more. The pickled beets or whatever they were tasted great. 

Next we ordered the chicken meatballs and the chicken and waffles. Both were great. The Red velvet waffles were so good. Honestly, waffles usually aren't my thing. ..but this was really good. I took a small bite of just the waffle and it was heaven. I didn't really understand the little pickle garnish on top, but it looked nice. The jalapeño, cilantro pesto sauce on the chicken meatballs was simply addicting. 

Since we ordered three small plates we decided to split just one entree, the hangar steak. I really liked it, but the boyfriend was hoping for a larger portion.

For this dine in experience we decided to try the Chimichurri steak and the Mac&Cheese Croquettes. 

Both were equally delicious. The Mac&Cheese is paired with a sriracha aioli sauce, which if you pair with the chimichurri steak you won't be dissapointed.

The service was decent no real issue the waiter was attentive respectful and apologetic for what followed. 

First the food  the mac and cheese was far from super it was pedestrian at best the bacon didn't enhance it at all it was one of the few times bacon didn't make it better. 
Chicken meatballs, why did a chicken have to die for this?  It was basically an anti vegan falafel.  Deep fried with a mere spec of sauce. (I did like the sauce) 

Last my beer, normally nothing to complain about but a fly was in it!  Ok sure it happens but it iced the cake. (the waiter did remove it)

3519594,2015-11-11,9,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"It's unfortunate that Daniel Ontiveros left, but if the new executive chef can lead the kitchen as well as his predecessor, Therapy will continue to be a quality spot Downtown and is already one of the most beautiful spaces in the area. They spent a pretty penny on this build out and the quality shows. More upscale than surrounding restaurants but still a casual environment perfect for hanging out with friends or for a date night. 

I stopped by a couple times earlier in the summer and both visits showcased well crafted dishes where the smaller, shareable plates shined. They have some classic dishes like steak tartare made with hangar steak and chicken and waffles using crisp and airy red velvet waffles. Latin inspired dishes can be found on the menu. Street corn charred and smothered with cheese, a lime aioli and a subtle kick from chili peppers makes for some good bites. As do savory, rich, and slightly oily oxtail empanadas or an order of shrimp ceviche and chips.

The most successful items were also the most unique. Fried pig ears were a first for me, but I walked away a fan of its crispy exterior and chewy (almost like biting into a fig) texture. Their ""In the gnudi"" dish was also a hit. Although slightly sweet with a fig jam and cranberries, spreading the baked ricotta and topping on top of the accompanying walnut crostini created an enticing array of tastes and textures.

Both flatbreads I tried -- the summer squash and mixed mushroom flatbreads -- were equally outstanding where the buttery, flakey pastry-like crust stood out as the star of both dishes.

The biggest letdowns were the limp popcorn and salty and dry chicken meatballs. Aside from those missteps I'd have to say that Therapy has lots of promise, provided that the changes in the kitchen don't hold them back.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,13,10,4,dx9EuiDA8BhkmXTHRtHxFQ

3546670,2017-12-27,2,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"My family and I were trying to find somewhere good to eat in Vegas on our last night, so we decided to go to Therapy. It is located on the ""old"" Vegas strip and the popular road of Fremont. Therapy has a cozy feel but is still spacious. As some of you know, I love tapas so this was a good place to go. The establishment was clean and the staff was extremely nice. 

I love eating tapas because I love to be able to try different options. Here was no different.

-Chorizo Empanadas : Spicy Spanish Chorizo, Bell Pepper & Jalapenoño Filled Pastry & Harissa Lime Sauce. These empanadas were very tasty. The pastry shell was fried perfect. The Chorizo inside gave it the perfect flavors and taste. They tasted homemade. 

- Charred Brussel Sprouts : Tossed With Brown Butter, Crispy Bacon Lardon, Apples & Toasted Almonds. These by far had to have been the best Brussel Sprouts I have tasted. They were perfect and full of flavor. The crunch on them was perfect, not to hard but not too soft. The bacon added the perfect touch. Overall, an amazing side dish. 

- Fried Mac Croquettes: Crispy Fried Mac & Cheese Croquettes With Tomato Bacon Jam & Sriracha Aioli. This dish was interesting. I have had fried Mac and cheese before, but I think the jam and aioli is what made this dish. The jam had a sweet flavor that was good. The Mac and cheese was fried perfect and had a nice crunch. The flavors all went together well in this dish. Yummy! 

- Chicken & Waffle Slider : Red Velvet Waffle, Buttermilk Battered Fried Chicken Breast, Red Pepper Remoulade Slaw & Vanilla Maple Syrup. I can honestly say this dish was so, so. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best. The ""Red Velvet"" waffles were definitely NOT Red Velvet in flavor. They literally tasted like a vanilla flavored waffle with red food coloring. I LOVE Red Velvet and know that distinct taste and this was not it. The chicken wasn't bad. It was fried perfect and lended the perfect crunch. The chicken was seasoned pretty well from what I remember as well. Overall, it was ok but it's prettier than it actually taste. *shrugs*

I loved it as well, it was my first time eating something new such as this dish. Very delectable. 

We also ordered Pork Belly and I asked if it was fatty and the server said not too much but it was quite fatty and had little meat. My boyfriend liked Devil on Horseback, and The Ricky Ricardo was supposed to be cuban style but the flavor didn't taste like a cuban sauce. It was tasteful but they should have called it something else.

The restaurant is spacious with a high ceiling which we like. We were seated upstairs with a table overlooking the restaurant.

-The Perfect Cure - the meat had varieties of soppressata and prosciutto while there were four selections of cheese. All were good but the creamy brie was the winner on this menu selection. They also had some house pickles and artichokes with a grilled peach jam,  cranberry crostini and some dijon and mustard seed for dipping. An excellent dish to say the least.
-The Big Sexy - A Wagyu beef burger topped withlettuce, marinated tomato, brie. I had the  scallion mayo on the side and used it for the fries. the burger was very juicy and served a perfect medium rare. With the marinated tomato, creamy brie and lettuce no additional condiments were even needed. It looks like a basic, run of the mill burger but was backed with great flavors.
- Sliced Chimichurri Steak  - marinated in citrus with spices and some jalapeno for kick, the tender cut of steak was melt in your mouth excellence. The chimichurri sauce and fried onion strings added on top for extra flavor and texture sealed the deal for me on this. I am glad this was one of the items we tried and I want to go back to get it again.

Service at Therapy was excellent, even sitting at the bar which was filled from one end to the other. Maybe next time I will save room for desert.",L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,4,2,5,3xYC3r05Wo5C2saDQmZMfQ

Sadly, only a few stood out as things I would get again. The star for me was the French Dip with Truffle Chips. I also enjoyed the Fried Pig's Ears and the Hanger Steak Tartare. The rest of the spread were more like a ""one and done"" kind of deal.

TASTE is first and foremost, and while the presentations were appealing to the eye, I don't see wanting to return any time soon. Glad we got to try it out though, and it seems to be doing great for DTLV's dining scene. ALOHA!!!

Brussels Sprouts: covered in parmesan, if you're into that. Fried a bit too harshly? The outer leaves were almost entirely blackened. The addition of the cashew nuts was interesting. This dish was brought down by the sprouts sitting in a bit of a bed of oil. For something as refreshing as Brussels Sprouts, it's disappointing to find them heavily greased.

Mac and Cheese: a little better than a standard mac and cheese -- the pasta was Orecchiette, which was cooked al dente and carried the cheese nicely. The cheese was good as well; not overwhelmingly flavored. However, this dish could have benefited from extra garnishing (spices, breadcrumbs, etc.).

Overall, I found this restaurant to serve decent food, though nothing outstanding by any means. However, it's probably among the best destinations on the Fremont strip.",JQ_O7ZD_iuLmmRFdFNBMqQ,0,0,3,QpasB2RB6to_A6CsyJPDSA

Our main issue was with a sandwich called the Ricky Ricardo. It has dijoinaise on  it. My husband wasn't a fan of that and was talking with the hostess about other options.

Chicken and waffle slider: ill pass. The ""red velvet"" waffle was red, but wheres the flavor? Same with the chicken. It desperately needed seasoning. 

Bacon dates: another yes for me. Its bacon how could you not?

I personally ordered the chimichurri steak and it was not good at all. The steak was tough. And i ordered it at medium rare. Can you imagine?

She is the most critical person I think I have ever met when it comes to restaurants. No dish is ever good enough and she never likes the drinks. She always manages to find something wrong, and criticize both. 

I knew I wanted to go downtown Vegas one of the nights I was here, so I googled restaurants in downtown Vegas. I clicked on an article called ""Ten best restaurants in Downtown Vegas"" and Therapy was one of them. It just seemed perfect, as i didn't want a place inside of a casino or a street-food type of place. I looked on Yelp and the menu looked like it had something for everyone so I made a reservation. I've given up on pleasing my mom, so I wasn't thinking of her. I just assumed she would hate the food like she does at every other restaurant. 

Although my son and his gf got the big sexy burger, which they loved, the rest of us just shared a bunch of different things and it was all delicious! We ordered the fire roasted corn, the chicken meatballs, the Super Mac, the Crab dip, and the Perfect Cure. Even the soup was sharable! Instead of coming in one bowl, it came it 3 small bowls. It was a tomato soup with cheddar bacon dumplings. Omg it was so good! The menu didn't say it was spicy but it was. That was my favorite dish. 

Ok so back to my mom, I put a little of everything on her plate and then just ignored her because I didn't want to hear her complaints. After I had 2 drinks in me, I got brave and asked how she liked everything. I almost had a heart attack when she said ""oh I loved it!"" WHAAATT!!!?? Did I hear correctly!!?? Did she just say she LOVED IT!!?? That's when I decided to write this review. 

So if you are ever in Vegas, and want some good food, drinks, and service, come to Therapy! I know rude and I know nice, and this place is full of the nicest people.

I would like to say the hostesses greeting guests were very friendly, welcoming, and so was the bartender who served us, however, friendly only gets you so far. 

First we took a look beer and wine list and the beer list is quite extensive and we had many questions about the different beers, unfortunately the bartender didn't know very much or even know how to pronounce them. They also server frozen drinks, which I thought was a bit odd considering it's all inside and it definitely isn't a pool. 

Next, many ""manager"" or ""owner"" type guys were looming around (maybe they owned the place, maybe not). Now, I understand it was the first night, but none of these guys really seemed to be professionals, we weren't greeted by them, or asked how we enjoyed ourselves or anything. The reason I knew they had something to do with the place is because they seemed to have set up shop in the corner or the bar doing their work, eating, drinking (it was a big glup type drink, classy) all in view of the guests. If you are the manager or owner you should be greeting ever guest walking in your door on opening night, not just your buddies, and ask how everyone is doing. 

The food was good, and this it was I'm actually rating my review on. We had the roasted cauliflower which is one of my favorites anywhere. This was super oily though, so for me I probably wouldn't order it again. The summer squash flatbread was great and my boyfriend really enjoyed the oxtail empanadas. None of the dishes were to die for, but they were good.

If this place is going to be more like a sports bar than a tapas experience then I probably won't be running back, especially if the owners/managers carried themselves the way they did.",9ARxqHzCnZ6pY1DmSGFqFg,3,3,3,RxYUVfkDHujMrdkV-ty45Q

Came here because places to eat on the Strip tend to remind me of Disneyland - overpriced, oversalted, and just overrated. Just craving some fun and different food for a reasonable price.

This place totally delivered. We originally intended to bring our entire bachelorette party here - but when a day club turned a bit too intense for most of the group, we came with three instead. The took us in with no problems and made us feel right at home! 

Started with the empanada trio - super delicious. Loved the fillings - thought the outside could have tasted a bit fresher. Split a bottle of rose which we all loved. For dinner, had the red velvet waffles and fried chicken sliders. BOMB.COM. Five stars. For dessert, we had the dark chocolate souffle.

We sat at the bar to take advantage of Happy Hour menu, which included $5 beer, wine, Mimosas, Bellini's, well cocktails, a Happy Hour menu and 20% off all regular priced food items. 

I had a Bellini, and my husband had a beer. We split the shrimp ceviche which was excellent ! It was a generous portion, served alongside black bean taco chips. So good - if you like seafood - I highly recommend! 

We asked our server / bartender Kimberly what she suggested for a main. She chose the Ricky Ricardo ( which we both were considering ) It is a Cuban sandwich filled with pork, ham, cheese and pickles. It was very good. We split this as well and it was enough to have us both satisfied. 

We each had another drink and got the bill. It came to under 45$ including tax which seemed really decent. 

Kimberly was behind friendly and polite. The ambiance was cool, and I really liked all the metal sculptures that were all over the place. It's not old and smoke filled like most of Downtown Vegas. I would definitely return and totally recommend.",q-v8elVPvKz0KvK69QSj1Q,8,5,5,5FpG8kcx92eiQSEumJTz1g

3971713,2015-07-19,15,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Joining a growing list of DTLV eateries, Therapy. has some inventive dishes and new takes on others.  Items served:

Oxtail empanadas with lime crème fraîche
Soft pretzel bread with spicy beer mustard
In the ""gnudi""
Roasted Mexican street corn
Assorted mushroom flatbread with smoked bacon, caramelized onion and soft cooked egg
Red velvet waffle sliders
Hangar steak tartar
Crispy fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard sauce
Roasted cauliflower with dates and yellow curry
Cast iron s'mores with semi-sweet chocolate and bacon marshmallows
Crumbled carrot cake

Greeted by the general manager, Chuck Scimeca, we were quickly seated and brought water and I ordered an iced tea.  We were asked if we wanted to order items from the menu or have the chef send out items he chose.  After looking at the menu, we opted for them to make the choices for us but we had a few requests--items they had already planned for us to have.  During our dinner, Chef Daniel Ontiveros, formerly at Comme Ça, came to the table to talk about some of the dishes and his plans for the menu in the future.  I saw him several times stopping at tables to chat with customers.

Outstanding dishes were the gnudi--baked ricotta, truffle honey, fig jam, roasted almonds & cranberry and walnut crostini.  The jam and almonds with the baked cheese on the crostini was excellent!  The Mexican street corn was very good.  I'll go for this anytime.  The assorted mushroom flatbread was very different.  Instead of being a standard flatbread crust, it was instead a puff pastry crust.  The char on the pastry was perfect without being burnt.  The soft cooked egg mixed onto the flatbread added to the flavor of the mushrooms and bacon.  The last two items were ones we asked for and were good choices.  The baked cauliflower with China Ranch dates and yellow curry was excellent!  The light curry flavor was very good.  Finally, the pig ears were so much different than others I've had.  These were meatier instead of being a thin slice of pig ear.  The honey mustard dipping sauce with them was very tasty.

The two desserts were quite good.  The s'mores with bacon marshmallows on top of a graham cracker crust in the cast iron container was a fun dish--a perfect example of Chef Ontiveros's slant on a dish that's available in area restaurants--this with a very different twist.  The favorite, however, was the crumbled carrot cake served with cream cheese frosting and a spoon of vanilla ice cream.

Service during the evening was excellent.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass before I  was done with the previous and the servers were all pleasant and efficient.  One negative for me--the music was loud at times and it almost overwhelmed our conversation.  Therapy. is very close to being a five star review. 

We were not presented a check.  The servers were taken care of instead.

Therapy. has been open for just over a month and things are running very smoothly.  It was with a very full stomach that we walked back to the garage where we'd parked.  I'll be back to Therapy. soon!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,24,21,4,YiA0ghB08TaayBex8pN6hA

The ambience inside is super hip with that rustic industrial modern vibe going on.
It's fancier than some of the other new places (publicus/glutton/etc) and more restaurant-y than bar-y.
The beer and wine and cocktail selections are quite good, with a couple unique beer offerings I hadn't heard of. 
I liked the menu: small plates, ""new American"" style, kinda fancy, heavy on the veggies. Most of these things would be a turn-off to Mr. A., but luckily they had a burger/sandwich menu, too, to keep him interested.
I tried the carrots, brussel sprouts, shrimp scampi, and 'in the gnudi.' Liked them all. Loved the gnudi, but it was a pretty big portion for just one person to eat and my husband isn't about to try something involving 'fig jam.' Also it's really rich, so I couldn't finish it. Also loved the carrots (although, again, too sweet for the Mr.). Brussels sprouts were good and shrimp scampi was good, too, but they weren't extra memorable.
For 4 small plates and 2 beers, it ran us almost $90 with tax and tip, which seems a little high. 
Service was friendly and efficient, but it's just too expensive for 5 stars.

My boyfriend ordered the Sangria, I ordered a Vodka soda with muddled fruit, one friend ordered a Pina Colada (again off the menu) and the other was a ""specialty cocktail"" off the menu. ALL OF THEM were horrible. The Pina Colada tasted like chocolate ice??!! seriously?? my Vodka soda came with a skewer of bar fruit on top of the glass. The specialty cocktail tasted like flowers and the Sangria was the worst I ever tasted. Ok, so the food must be good...right? We waited an hour after ordering before we flagged down the waitress and asked where our food was.  We received it 15 minutes later.  Literally the burger that was ordered looked seared on the outside and completely raw on the inside. The meat wasn't even slightly cooked.  My Chimichurri steak was slightly cooked but tasted like meat with lime juice. We had a chicken dish off the menu and it wasn't cooked thoroughly either. What a disappointment. We asked for the manager and waited again. I felt so bad for our waitress, as this was not her fault and she seemed horrified. When the manager showed up at our table, she apologized for the food and said ""I've been working in this business for 10 years and sometimes there are off days!"" Really!? Ok, off days maybe...but at least get a decent bartender that can make a Pina Colada right. You might as well make your clients good drinks so MAYBE the food will look and taste better. After it all, we waited 2 1/2 hours and had bad drinks and no food. I tipped the waitress $20 because none of this had to do with her, and we left to go have a burger at the place across the street. What a terrible start to my Birthday weekend, thanks to Therapy.  I would NEVER recommend this place to any one of my friends.",a4vBoQMPc1D84pUiBhofWw,3,0,1,-Yuj_usyBrcN3fZTQNG-fw

4061535,2017-05-09,1,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Visited on a Saturday night at 8 PM with no reservations.  Place was packed but we were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar. (Party of 2)

Service: 4/5 The bartender was also our server since we were at the bar.  She had our menus ready for us as soon as we sat down and took our orders promptly.  She kept checking on our food orders as well as keeping our drinks fresh.  

Food: 4/5 The oxtail empanadas were tasty and is something I look forward to on my next visit. The chicken meatballs were also a hit for me.  The size was only slightly larger than a ping pong ball and 6 came out in a bowl, but the meatballs were dense with chicken and rich with flavor.  The raw filet tartar looked and tasted great.  The egg yolk and parmesan cheese mixed well with the filet.  The carrot cake was tasty and presented in this unconventionally mashed potato shaped fashion.  It was interesting and definitely didn't hinder the taste.
Best part of the night was being introduced to tonic syrup for the first time with my Tito's vodka.  It gives an appearance that it's been mixed with Coke or Pepsi.  It's a little sweeter than tonic water but not too sweet and really takes the edge off the vodka.  Tonic syrup is something I'll be looking for in the future. (see pics)

Value: 3.5/5 The appetizers are priced in the $11-$17 range and the entrees are fairly priced for the quality of food you receive.  If you have a big appetite the bill can add up quickly but you will have a tasty good time.  

Ambiance: 4/5 Industrially decorated with high ceilings to make it appear even more spacious.  It's going to be busy and noisy on the weekends as it is a popular spot downtown.  There seems to be a mix of parties of either looking to eat and run or staying for awhile ordering plate after plate. The tables and booths are separated enough and comfortable for dining.  There's a good energy and vibe that helps kick start a long evening out.

Summary: This is my second visit and I enjoyed it as much as the first.  I highly recommend reservations if you're coming down on a weekend night.  The location on Fremont street is close to the main bars in the vicinity, all walking distance.  Therapy is my go to place in Downtown for a light dinner and some good drinks right before I head out for the night.",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,1,2,4,usb4-O3MoY0MwlhVdjnKIA

So I came here for a friend's birthday and was super excited because of all the hype. We walked into the two-storied trendy restaurant and saw that our party was sat next to the open kitchen. I thought it was cool at first...until I realized it was a sore spot for outgoing orders. This meant waiters bumping into the back of my chair multiple times, trying to grab their food. One waiter even dropped his plates which splattered everywhere. Our group yelled out, ""Opa!"" and applauded to distract him from embarrassment. See, I did not let this discourage me! 

It was more-so the food that disappointed me. It took sooo long for our food to arrive, aaand they all came out at different times. Some of us had already finished their meal while others had just started. After awkwardly staring at my friends enjoy their food for a quite some time, my dish finally came out (LAST) and it wasn't even hot anymore. Like it seemed like it had been laying out for a while. 
Despite the wait, my friends seemed to enjoy their orders - red velvet chicken waffles, chimichurri steak, big sexy burger, and oxtail appetizer.",2yPRCQMd2u0ka7r5IdITBQ,0,0,3,vdnRjEuvywG4LmimM3pzoQ

My first thought when I walked in was, ""this place was huge!"" Then I tried to scour my brain to think of what used to be there. We were seated immediately. The inside is very clean. Nice, modern touch to it. Everything is in top order. A plus.

Server was very nice. First beer I ordered was not available (it was a brown ale). The Fort Collins Rocky Mountain IPA was gross. Too flowery. The Fort Collins 10/20 pale ale was also gross. Not Therapy's fault, but this is just to set the stage of where my night was going.

We ordered the Oxtail Empanadas and the Steak Tar Tar. The Oxtail Empanadas are out of this world delicious. Oxtail is delicious and there is a generous amount inside that fluffy shell. The Creme Fraiche was a nice compliment for the empanada. Little sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the empanadas, great flavor as well.

Now the steak tar tar. There was not one thing I liked about this. The Steak Tar Tar comes with grilled bread and some pickled vegetables. I took a bite of the steak tar tar on top of the grilled bread and it was FUNKY. Just funky. Now I've had steak tar tar before, but not like this. I tried to pick out what I didn't like. I had a bite of the bread and it was legitimately gross. I asked the server what kind of bread and she wasn't quite sure what it was. I had a nibble of the steak tar tar and that was also funky. There must have been a spice in the tar tar, but I couldn't figure it out. Even the damn pickles were disgusting. One was fine and then the other...I just got a mouth full of black licorice. I was told it was probably (star anise?) the pickling agent. It was foul.

The good thing was that I was honest with the server that the steak tar tar was not good. I did say that it might just be me though. Server was nice enough to remove the steak tar tar off the bill (I didn't ask her too, it was very nice). I wasn't super hungry so I didn't get anything else, but was intrigued by STREET CORN. 

Overall, I think this is a good date spot. It's clean and new. You can dress up or come in with shorts and a tank. It's versatile. Plus, the food servings are the best for really 2 people. I may give the place another shot. I will be downtown again and it's great to get a bite to eat. Just hope my next venture in I have better luck.

We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

Just a few steps East from the Fremont Experience is a delightful , small nondescript restaurant that is not to be missed .  It's in an area that is ""re-developing"" and it is a restaurant that will appeal to a more sophisticated diner, not a Fremont Experience guzzler who loves $1.50 hotdogs.

We stopped to look at the menu and the hostess came out out to the street to greet us and induced us to give the place a try. Denise, our hostess, did an excellent job of greeting us and explaining the menu in very engaging terms.

A delightful restaurant, spacious, very well appointed, comfortable and with very attentive table service. And then there's the food... Excellent, unusual, delicious and filling. All of the food is housemade and the flavor demonstrates that. From the appetizer through to dessert the meal is a wonderful dining experience.  The Oxtail Empanadas (you get 4 small empanadas) were different, tasty and a fine appetizer. I recently had the French Dip which was excellent with tender and plentiful slices of beef and real (not salty bouillon) au jus filled with small pieces of beef. The truffle chips and the pepper chips are very good. The Chicken Fried Chicken Sub was delicious, with a large fried (not oily) chicken breast on a wonderful roll.  A very rich chocolate cake and good coffee topped off the lunch.   Full bar with a very nice beer,wine and cocktail menu.  Dinner service begins at 3PM.   

The restaurant is wonderful for couples , business lunches and dinners and it has a loft area that can accommodate large gatherings . Roger, the owner, stopped by and we had a pleasant and informative chat. Our server Tracy was excellent, attentive and informative without being overbearing.

4129509,2017-06-08,3,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Trendy place with some excellent food. I'm pretty sold on this place when I'm in the area and in the mood to get off the strip (which is almost always). I emailed them for a reservation of 14 for dinner a few weeks before our trip and it was totally fine. Very prompt response. They sat us on a long table and we decided to split the check three ways inside our group to make ordering a little easier. 

Parking: They don't have a parking lot, but you can probably find street parking somewhere close by. 

Ambiance: Clean, trendy, welcoming. Slightly dim. 

Food: 
- Roasted Street Corn: Their take on elote. So good! We kept talking about it on the way back, It's a must get. It was so yummy that we got another order. 
- Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Sliders: These are actually kind of large. I was trying to figure out how to eat it without getting my lipstick everywhere. It was pretty tasty, but I do remember the chicken being a little dry. We cut each side in half and shared between the four of us in our mini group. 
- Shrimp Ceviche: Really yummy! Not too acidic either. I was a fan. Shrimp was nice and  fresh too. 
- Korean BBQ Porkbelly: So delicious and mouth-watering. Must order!
- In The Gnudi: I was sort of surprised by how much I liked this dish. It was a nice break from all the savory since it was also sweet. I'd def order this again.
- Big Sexy: The patty was juicy and it the bun was nice and wasn't soggy. 

Cocktails: 
- Nice and strong. I was able to try ""The Smash"" and ""St. Therapy"". Both were really refreshing and had good flavors. 

-Service: The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because they messed up our check 3 times (which took about 20 minutes to rectify) and I was getting agitated because we were on a tight schedule. Our waiter was very nice though and he checked in on us in a timely manner. Also, the host was really nice too. He was able to accommodate our large party even when I called to change our reservation to an earlier time. 

TL;DR: Totally going to be coming to this place when I can. Also told my friends who just moved here to check it out. The corn is awesome.",Qo_tDfEiCF0cOZ1Vp7MSgw,5,6,4,5A1wDZgKvzDRXtzZXxKGNg

Most of it is small plates to share but they do have a spoon & fork section on the menu that is meant to be larger portions.  Upstairs is perfect for getting more of a restaurant vibe.  

Service was good-ish and a bit off-timed.  Not to the point of being awful or anything...little things like taking food order before getting drinks in, not bringing enough water glasses, refilling only when we asked, slow to clear some plates but collecting others as we were still eating off them (literally) and not knowing the menu.  Again, it wasn't terrible....these are just some reasons it's not a 5.  They were out of a few liquors so they couldn't make some of their specialty drinks.  Not a deal breaker for me.

Seated instantly and really liked the atmosphere. Georgie was our server and she was a sweetheart. 

So the positives are that the place is a cool spot and they have great service and it is apparent that their menu is still a work in progress. 

I had seen their funky popcorn from Yelp pictures and wanted to try it, but they axed it off the menu because nobody actually liked it. 

We decided on the steak tartar and the oxtail empanadas. The steak tartar was just ok. I could not place what spice was off putting about it. The parm and egg on it were just fine but the meat also did not seem very fresh. Georgie was nice enough to take the item off of our table and off our bill when we told her the feedback. That is awesome! 

I did really like the oxtail empanadas. The creme fraiche had a little seasoning to it that I liked.

The place appeared as though there was no where to seat us since it was packed, but to my surprise there was an upstairs, and we were sat immediately. Everyone working in the restaurant was super friendly and greeted us as we walked passed. 

I chose the chicken and red velvet waffle sliders due to all the rave reviews, and sad to say I was disappointed. The portion size was huge and filling, which was a plus. The flavor is where I felt the dish was lacking. The chicken was too salty, and the salt overpowered all of the other flavors besides the syrup.... But I didn't buy this to just taste syrup. The red velvet waffles had a cake consistency, but no red velvet taste. I also wasn't a fan of the ""slaw"" which was torn pieces of lettuce with sauce, but then again I was expecting southern slaw which was probably the wrong assumption. 

I think this dish is a great idea and the presentation is beautiful, but I felt the execution was poor. Maybe the flavors vary based off who cooks it. More prominent, balanced flavors would do this dish justice.",upd0bAa7lGk6aZfWrResQQ,4,1,3,NnSeDfofh3Hl_DhHMlkhEg

Unfortunately, everything else was good, not great. Oxtail empanadas, ok. Chicken and red velvet waffles...mixed. Great waffle, crispy outside, and somehow melts in your mouth. And the bourbon maple syrup was perfectly balanced. But the chicken was just kind off there. I might have been just as happy if they substituted with a boneless strip from KFC.

Service, well, they try hard, but I think they need a stronger manager at the helm. We have a late reservation, knowing it would be Friday night and possible packed. Well, what good is a reservation if we end up getting served at the bar 40min later anyways?

The reason for the 2 star review:

1. They had great happy hour specials ( I showed up at 11 on a thursday). Me and my friends ordered a bunch of four roses whiskeys on the rocks....for $5 bucks! Fantastic deal. Then the bill comes.....they charged for ice! Yes ice! We asked the bartender if the drink listed was part of the happy hour and she confirmed that it was. And somehow we didn't get the $5 dollar price. I looked over the menu after getting the bill and it didn't say anything about a charge for ice. I'm surprised that they didn't charge of for the use of the cups. Just absurd. Be aware of extra hidden charges!

I would have preferred it either pre mixed or in a bigger plate so I can really make sure the parmesan and egg blend into the tartare and distribute the flavors properly. 

The duck was much touted. I actually liked the sauce and root vegetables quite a bit more than the meat. They recommended medium on the duck, but I'm glad I got medium rare. The duck was somewhat tough, and medium would have made it too dry to eat. When combined with the sauce it was a pretty good dish.  

The desserts are huge. For sharing only,  I'd say. I got the banana bread pudding. There were some good flavors there.

The first thing to come out is the lobster bisque which is lukewarm at best (it had obviously been sitting there for a while).

Chicken Meatballs - good with Indian overtones and a nice way to begin our meal.

The Ricky Ricardo aka Cuban pulled pork sandwich was ok, plaintains weren't as sweet as I like, pickles were good.

The Chicken & Red Velvet Waffles were surprisingly much larger than slider portions so a good value at $14. The chicken had a prominent & well-seasoned crust, the waffles were airy & reminded me of communion wafers. I did not care for the mushy slaw that ruined the sandwich or the sparse sauce on the chicken.

I ordered the The French Dip, which came out on a grilled hoagie roll - which gave it a crisp bite, but enough soft-insides to be good for soaking up au jus. The only thing I did not like about the French Dip was the au jus served alongside it. It was much more gravy-like than au jus, so the bread didn't soak it up very well. When I think of a French Dip, I want regular au jus to soak into the bread, not just a dipping sauce. However, I have to admit the gravy had great, deep flavor, and the meat inside the sandwich was succulent, with very little fat. Chips came with the sandwich, and were crunchy, salty, and tasty.

S: Why don't we try Therapy...they're open.
Me: Sure...I could use a therapy session. (LOL)

Friendly greeting when we walked in.  They were going to sit us at a table where we would have to face another party.  For this ""therapy"" session, I needed to be away from people...lol!  So we asked to sit up front, which they obliged.  Nice comfy atmosphere!  Our friendly server asked if it was our first time in and explained the menus to us.

Me: Grey Goose dirty martini

It is going to be that kind of a ""session""...lol!  We ordered the oxtail empanadas...very tasty...I wonder if they thought about steaming them and making dumplings?  Just a thought!  The Chard Kale salad was really good!  It was served with beets, bacon bits, and a fried egg on top!  I would come here and order that for breakfast!  The mac n cheese...with bacon added.  Like always, I compare any MnCH to Cafe Chole's in San Diego, this one was by far very close.  So it is my 2nd favorite!  The chicken meatballs were just okay...I mean, I liked the sauce, but they just weren't my favorite.

She: Would you like another martini?
Me: No, we have to go back to work.
She: Where do you work?
Me: I'm with my family this week...IT'S WORK!!!

She suggested the chocolate mousse cake and it was delicious!  Not overly sweet and just the right balance of mousse and cake!

The chicken & waffles was my favorite, just the right amount of ingredients and the sweetness wasn't too overpowering. The pulled pork I thought was just eh alright.

We had dessert too which was excellent. Our main complaint was the atmosphere. We found it confusing, whether it was nice dining, a sports bar, or a night club. It was very dark inside and the music was so loud, and it was top-40 style dance music. Not something I want when I'm paying $100 for some drinks and small plates.

I tend to stick to their ""Bites"" menu - plus these dishes are discounted during Happy Hour.  They are famous for their empanadas - I've tried every flavor and you should too!  The Devils on Horseback are as sinfully delicious as you expect them to be, and the ""In the Gnudi"" is a fun take on gnocchi that I really liked.

I ordered the short ribs, which had great flavor but were overcooked- not terribly, but enough to remind me of at-home pot roast.

The food took forever to come out, which was strange because, well, no one else was there.  The waitress was pleasant, but not the most attentive ever.

We started off with an app called Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates stuffed w-goat cheese and almonds), it was sweet and savory and the thick cut bacon was perfectly done.  For dinner we shared a French Dip (roasted prime rib on a toasted hoagie roll) with home made Truffle Chips.  The prime rib melted in your mouth and the chips, oh the chips!  I don't like potato chips, but I tried them anyway.  Glad I did ... I ate half of them myself.  The oil and seasonings on these chips were like nothing I've ever tasted -- they are amazing. Then we ordered the pork sliders.  I was a little doubtful when I noticed the meat was not slathered in BBQ sauce, but once I bit into it I knew why ... the flavor is in the meat.  Not only was it tender juicy and tasty, but it was piled high and there was no gristle or fat chunks in any of it.  The pulled pork rested on a savory bed of mustard slaw ... we loved it.  I also had glass of the house Malbec - smooth and served at room temperature (so many places chill their red wine).  It was delightful.

We had reservations but arrived early. We sat at the bar and they were able to get seated earlier which was great. We only ordered beer but their cocktails looked tasty! I would like to try one in the future. 

They serve everything tapas style so you can order a few things to share for the table. They also serve some dishes that are considered larger and can be used as a meal instead of getting tapas. We decided to start off with bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese inside served with a red sauce. They were amazing! Dates and goat cheese are two of my favorite things so I knew I would love these. We then ordered a crab and artichoke dip. This was one of the daily specials and I was excited to be able to try it. It came with homemade blue tortilla chips but we also ordered truffled chips to go with it. I really enjoyed this dip. We then ordered the red velvet waffles with fried chicken. They were served as two sandwiches with coleslaw and a chipotle like sauce and syrup. These hit the spot! If you have never tried chicken and waffles this is the place to try it. You can't go wrong with red velvet waffles. We then ordered the sliced chimicurri steak. It came out sliced already which was really convenient. It was so tender and I enjoyed the sauce it came in. We were very full at this time but we had to have dessert because we saw other tables order it and it looked too good not to try. We decided to order the smore skillet. It was amazing! It had marshmallows with crumbled graham cracker and chocolate. A great way to end an awesome meal.

Service is mostly good but I also had a bad waitress before. I like the environment. It's spacious and well designed with the industrial feel. It's a place I would keep coming back. 

Some of the things I've tried,

1. Oxtail empanadas (4/5): one of my favorite thing on the menu. Although it seemed like it looked more like a potsticker than an empanada now when I went today.

2. Chicken meatballs (4/5): this dish is light with chicken and I loved the cilantro jalapeño pesto. It inspired me to be creative when I make my own pesto sauce. 

3. Charred kale salad (4/5): I liked the grill flavor and loved the egg yolk on my kale. 

4. Fried pig ear (5/5): I loved the fried pig ear, but it gets bit much after 4 pieces. 

5. Steak (2/5): I've tried the steak here once and I wouldn't order it again. The quality of the steak here is under average. 

6. Hanger steak tartar(dinner)/ fillet tartar(lunch) (3/5): I've tried both and they were just mediocre steak tartar to me. They are not well seasoned. I can do with or without. 

7. Chicken and red velvet waffles (2/5): I love love chicken and waffle. However, the waffle here was soggy. I didn't really enjoy this dish. I've even told the waiters a few times. Hopefully they make the waffle more crispy now. 

8. Shrimp scampi (3/5): light white wine sauce with fresh shrimp. Not too bad. 

9. Fire roasted street corn (3/5): it would be bit better if they added more seasoning, the lime and the Parmesan cheese. 

10. Cast iron s'mores with bacon (4/5): add bacon! It's free anyway and the bacon flavor makes the dish a bit less sweet which I like. 

11. In the ""gundi"" (3/5): I love the baked ricotta with truffle honey, but they don't make this dish as good as some of the places I go to. 

12. The perfect cure (5/5): I enjoyed some of their spicy cured meats selection.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,3,0,4,mciDKvA8xVqVlAnCC046IA

There's soo many newer local restaurants to take advantage of in the Fremont East District and Therapy has been on my to do list. 

Took my sis to lunch Monday 2.20.17

I ordered:

Therapy's Crab Dip: Omg this dip arrived sizzling and didn't disappoint my taste buds. This dip was so delicious and I enjoyed the Parmesan taste. Must order!!! 

Super Mac: Another great choice! The mac was moist and full of flavor.

Caesar Salad: I typically don't use black pepper but it was a great addition to the Caesar and I devoured this salad bread and all!!

Therapy's Catch MP Salmon: $35 was a bit expensive in my opinion but it was delicious and cooked perfectly. 

Carrot Cake: Great presentation and even better tasting. Definitely the best dessert I've had in a while. 

I was a little disappointed Street Corn was out of season but I shall return soon for more deliciousness!!!

We were seated in a very comfortable spacious booth with a great view of the excellently appointed dining hall-like atmosphere. We started with wonders gin cocktails mixed with muddled fresh blackberries (our server's recommendation) and shared both a chorizo empanada and chicken meatball appetizer that were incredible! After another cocktail, my wife and I started with undoubtedly the best Caesar salad  we've ever had. Even though the menu is filled with tempting delights, our table settled on four different entrees. Our friends had the French Dip sandwich (OMG) and the Therapy Salad (generous portion and ultra fresh). My wife ordered the Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles (probably the best thing at the table--delicious!), and I tried the Wagyu Beef Burger with a fried egg and bacon on top (no words to describe except YUM!). We also had sides of the loaded mashed potatoes and 4 cheese mac--insanely good! This meal would have been $200 elsewhere (and worth it!) but it was literally half of that.

Tip:  Share everything (but take a bite of the sandwich and put it back on the plate instead of cutting off a piece and I'll stab you with a fork).

The filet tartar topped with shaved parm ad a raw (uncured) egg yolk, as good as any (though not as good as when they used hangar steak).  Coarse beef, gentle seasoning that relies on the parm for salt and earthiness.  Mix, spread on the charred toast, add a bite of vinegary pickled veg to brighten it up.  No complaints.

Oxtail empanadas definitely work.  Tasty, gelatinous oxtail and a hint of fresh jalapeno chili flavor and heat in a puffed, crisp shell.  A dip in the earthy, zesty harissa lime sauce balances the flavors.  

Equally satisfying, the charred Brussels sprouts.  Buttery, cashews for texture, mustard for zest, shaved parm for earthiness all serve to enhance the bitter sweetness of the sprouts.  Perfect cocktail / beer food.

The tender grilled octopus and zesty shrimp crevice (to be scooped up on blue corn tortilla chips) both good choices.

Limited but well chosen selection of craft beers and wines by the glass and bottle.  Well made craft cocktails (Downtown Manhattan baby).  

Tip:  HH Mon - Thurs 14:00 - 17:00; reverse 21:00 - 23:00.  Good discounts and f&b pairings.

Our 4 person party was seated at one of 2 tables fronting the kitchen which gave us the best seat to watch for our food. My friends started with 2 Bloody Mary's & a mimosa ( I'm not a fan of day drinking). I was peer pressured into trying the gigantic Bloody Mary topped with a huge piece of bacon, green olives & a slice of goat cheese soaked in red wine. Since we had read such great reviews we decided to order a lot & share it amongst ourselves. Our group ordered the red velvet chicken & waffle sliders, the BLT, the French Dip, chicken fried chicken sub & an order of their brussel sprouts. Yes, yes I know what you're thinking, how are 4 kids from Hawaii going to grind all this food? We were hangry, so it was quite easy! 

Everything was amazing, but my favorite was the red velvet sliders. It was literally the perfect combination. The chicken was so juicy & not overly breaded so it went great with the red velvet waffles. I am so glad I decided to order this instead of the portobello sandwich. Thanks Ezekiel for doing a great job! He was so nice to talk to & always made sure we were doing okay!

I highly recommend making your way past the safety net of the Fremont experience & head down to Therapy. I can see where they got their name. Once I took a bite of their food I knew it was exactly what I needed to take a break from losing money.",eM2xBhJMpJ-q8D4jQ9Vwvg,6,4,4,_VmucTx3h5heyEpKhhI6eA

We ordered:
-Red Velvet Chicken & Waffles: 5/5 stars. I ordered and devoured the entire thing. It was a good balance of chicken and waffles, though the red velvet made it a little sweeter than usual
-Filet Tartar 4/5 stars. My boyfriend loved this dish ate every last bit of it. I wasn't a fan of the bread they paired with it, particularly because I like softer breads than the thin crispy kind they provided
-The French Dip: 3/5 stars. Not much to say about it aside from that it was filling.

Although, for those interested a friend use to have an El Cortez players card and was able to park in their garage for free. Anyways, apparently tonight's Friday night traffic, cold weather and far parking was looking a little too right. 

Of course, I referred to Yelp and decided to try a new spot to catch up with a friend. It was pretty early evening and we were promptly seated upon entering.  They were serving happy hour with only a couple food items and drinks at the bar area but since I don't drink we were seated in the dining area. The food was decent and nothing on the menu was shouting pick me. I took a while to decide on something. We ended up going with the chicken meatballs to start with, pulled pork sliders and the big sexy. The chicken meatballs are a must!! They were mainly delicious because of the cilantro and jalapeño pesto sauce!!! The big sexy was 2.5 out of 5 due to the fact it had this gross extra creamy ""Brie and Scallion Mayo"". It almost tasted like goat cheese. In addition my friend rated the sliders a 3 out of 5. We ended our meal with dessert as well. We decided on the Cast Iron Smores and it lacked flavor. Maybe more chocolate could've added more flavor. I recommend ordering anything but that. The customer service was great, too. The servers checked on us often. Overall, for the cost I rather eat somewhere else. Downtown has many new and improved restaurants!

I was set on Le Thai, because I already love it there, but so glad we came into Therapy for dinner last night to try something new. Here's what our party of 5 experienced:

The Food:

The good:

CHICKEN MEATBALLS - comes with 6, we ate them all, quickly. Tender and savory, I would order these again. 

FIRE ROASTED CARROTS - the vanilla bourbon maple syrup was divine. And the feta. Perfect.

SHRIMP CEVICHE - the tomato lime sauce was just so satisfying, I actually was running my fork along my dish to get a few more final tastes when I finished. Well done. 

THERAPY SIGNATURE SALAD - the red wine vinaigrette was very acidic, some found it slightly salty, but I enjoyed it. I would like to try the charred kale salad, but I am a sucker for granny smith, candied walnut, and bleu cheese combos..

The not so good:

IN THE ""GNUDI"" - maybe it was the truffle oil, maybe it was that it was our last dish. It was a miss for me.

HANGAR STEAK TARTAR - with the confit egg and herbs...kind of was like eating meat waiting to be rolled into balls..and I'm a fan of tartar and carpaccio in general.

The neither here nor there:

CAST IRON SMORES - eat it while it's hot. Pretty good, but not memorable.


The Service: it was slammed in here. Park across the street was having an event outside with a half pipe and some snowboards. The bar was in the weeds (we sat there for an hour waiting for our table). We sat for probably 20 minutes without even being greeted, let alone served. With a barback, 2 bartenders, and a runner, I felt like they could have done better with a little assistance from the manager. I saw him, he seemed to be of no help whatsoever. Not sure what he did aside from look around. He didn't talk to guests or step in to make drinks or run anything. Strange.
In spite of that, they were clearly trying, and I have been in their shoes. No judgement here. 

Our food runner was awesome. Wish I got his name so I could give him the good feedback. Very sweet person.

4 stars instead of 5 for the lack of help on the floor, but they did really well for being so busy. Great food, I would definitely return!

P.S. also, Manhattans are typically made with a swirl of vermouth around the glass, not a shot of it. Not sure if that was intentional. If so, this needs to be reconsidered.",mE6-B9YhbbVTEolfYO_t8g,3,3,4,mRT_ogiH-j7x3Www_2Gyzg

Today, there were no other options for us to go for lunch and was kinda ""forced"" to eat here. Glad we did! While I can agree it is expensive, I believe it is worth it because the portions are huge and it is delish! Do try the Empanada Trio to include the Oxtail. Mac and Cheese is truly cheesy and creamy, one of the top Mac n Cheese I've had. Also ordered the Ceviche, they have their own take on it. I can't say it's the best, but it's quite good. The portions are so huge I didn't get to eat my main meal (which I'm going to share with my daughter), BLT, we had a bite of the chips that came with it and it was great and peppery. The only thing I would change is the bread used for the BLT, they use croissant. It's still good overall.

We shared the crab dip and the oxtail empanadas, both of which were home runs! 

Crab dip was creamy with generous chunks of crab, served with blue corn tortilla chips for dipping. I wanted to lick the ramekin clean!

Oxtail empanadas are 4 to an order, and probably half the size of typical empanadas making them easier to eat. The oxtail was slow cooked to perfection while the dough was crispy yet pillowy. Served with some sort of yummy aioli. 

Judging by the two items we ordered, I don't think you could go wrong with any of the food options. To wash it all down I had a watermelon sangria, which was a bit sweet for my taste, but refreshing nonetheless.

Service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Bartender overheard me say my phone was dying and took it to charge for me.

5229173,2017-09-27,0,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Great service and atmosphere, decidedly mediocre food. Went here on a whim with a big group and we had a good variety of choices that we more or less picked from other Yelp reviewers. The most popular dish on the menu appeared to be the velvet red chicken and waffles while friends opted for the mac and cheese, the fried chicken subs and salads. The sandwich looked great and I was really excited to find that the waffle had absolutely no velvet flavor, or any flavor at all while the fried chicken was bone dry. You had to be very liberal with the maple syrup to power through the sandwich. My sandwich was also obviously on the short end as the slaw wasn't like anyone else's cabbage slaw, it was replaced by another leafy green for a half of it and really had no flavor. 

My significant other had the fried chicken sub with truffle fries. The fries were done to perfect, but the same could not be said for the sandwich. It was just as dry as my waffle sandwich and the bland bread roll certainly didn't help. 

Another friend had the mac croquette which was very delicious despite the density of each croquette. Although it had awesome flavors, it was marred by a very odd choice of sweet salsa garnish as opposed to what looked like marinara at first. The flavors didn't pair well with each other and the croquette would have benefited more from something that is more tangy than sweet. 

The pricing is decent for what you get, and the serving size is definitely perfect. I'd recommend approaching this place as distinctly a gastropub.",2T50pKKwDGG3kpKrwWfk3g,0,0,3,HComNhMA9j5cq8Axu7GCqg

My beau and I decided to stop at Therapy before a concert on a Sunday night around 8PM. The restaurant on the first floor was empty aside from a few people sitting at the bar. We were immediately seated and our orders were taken promptly, but service after that kind of fell flat.

PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM BURGER ($13): Between a choice of this and macaroni and cheese, the burger won! The menu doesn't specify whether this entree comes with a side, so I asked the waitress if the burger came with fries. She said it usually comes with a salad but substituting fries would be no problem. Score! Nobody wants that rabbit food anyways. :P The burger taste-wise was alright - it could have been kicked up a notch or two flavor wise. The fries were warm and had the perfect texture, but likewise were pretty flavorless. We added salt. 3/5  

CHIMICHURRI STEAK ($19): My husband said the steak was alright and that it filled him up, despite appearances. This is an a la carte menu item. 3/5

SERVICE: The manager brought us our entrees and opened the door for us as we left, so he was awesome. Our server was mostly absent, though. It was a struggle trying to get refills and the check. Another annoyance was that the table was sticky and left a gross film on my phone cover. 2/5

The real killer here for us was the service. The place was practically empty, so I don't see how the service could be so dismal. Maybe eating at the bar is the way to go here?

5279475,2015-07-22,6,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Recently opened in the white-hot Fremont East district, an interesting decision given the established gastro-pub offerings of Park, Glutton, Carson Kitchen and more, it was at the suggestion of two trusted palates that dinner at ""Therapy."" was booked, the menu seemingly featuring all the right words with execution left to Chef Daniel Ontiveros in his debut role as head toque in a restaurant off The Strip.

Long in layout and two-stories tall, the space formerly inhabited by a Dollar Store completely renovated with a sexy bar and exposed ceilings as an open kitchen operates towards the back, it was at the hostess stand that we met the GM and swiftly led to a tidy four-top at the center of the restaurant the option of dining a la carte or letting the Chef cook for the table was offered, the later obviously accepted with a few special requests.

Admittedly allowing a friend of the house to arrange the reservation, and unexpectedly presented with no check at night's end, it was with service proving not only friendly but exceedingly well-informed and efficient that the meal began; a plate of soft pretzels set beside a quartet of oxtail empanadas, the former unequivocally buttery and luscious while the latter found surprising levity when dipped in peppery crème fraîche.

Sipping a stiff yet fruity frozen drink, and later treated to a tasting of signature sangrias from which the Elder-Melon iteration proved an on-point summer refresher, it was with good pacing that round two arrived a few minutes after opening plates were finished and although the citrus kissed street corn was certainly no slouch there is little sense arguing that the star of the show was in fact the absolutely irresistible ricotta dumplings entitled ""in the gnudi,"" a gooey bite both sweet and savory that wows equally when eaten like gnocchi or spread on crostini, an item already rivaling the best appetizers in the city and a midpoint contender for the year's ten best bites.

At this point seeing lights lowered as a pop-heavy soundtrack switched to Taylor Swift at a volume that seemed a bit unnecessary given the growing din of the crowd, it was onward to a flaky puff-pastry 'flatbread' topped with mushrooms and a soft-poached egg that the savories marched on, and with a shocking degree of smoke imbued in the crust given the use of an electric oven each slice was slowly savored, a follow-up jar of silky steak tartar on par with what should be expected while the whimsical red-velvet sliders were unfortunately a bit muddled by all the accoutrements, a bit less slaw or more brine to the bird needed to add balance while the 'bun' would have been better off crisp.

At this point a bit full, but unable to resist tasting a few more savories before moving onto dessert, it was with good fortune that a request was made to sample the meatiest pig's ears tasted to date, and yet as delicious as the indulgent strips were it was perhaps a bit of a surprise that the charred yellow cauliflower presented even bolder, the use of curry, dates, as well as nuts offering a great degree of balance and giving one hope of great things to come when Ontiveros launches a market-driven blackboard in the months to come.

Told that sweets at Therapy. are something not to be missed it was after a short visit from the Chef that the meal would reach its end, and again treated to a duo one would be hard pressed to decide whether the cast iron s'mores or deconstructed carrot cake was better, each creamy spoonful of the first exceptionally decadent despite being nicely anchored by a graham cracker base while the crumbled semicircle of spice cake was unquestionably more elegant, each bite offering something slightly different when paired to ice cream and airy cream cheese.

Still new, but already executing at a high level from the kitchen to the front of house staff, Therapy. marks yet another success for East Fremont, an area where things may indeed seem 'same-same' on the surface, while a deeper shows Chefs like Ontiveros instead pushing new concepts in an attempt to evolve the scene, and perhaps even swing the pendulum away from the strip and thereby change the game.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,8,4,haDL9PvYm8Wbykh_XOgNog

I thought I was a green leafy salad with pieces of beets, hearts of palms, hazelnuts,  goat cheese, pickled kumquats & orange ash. Instead, there were no greens and the full size salad was more like a fun-size salad. My husband ordered Therapy's Signature Salad with radishes, Granny Smith Apples, candied walnuts, blue cheese crumbles, and a white balsamic vinaigrette. He added chicken to it too, and could barely finish. Our server accidentally sent me the half-size portion of the Signature Salad without chicken instead of the Caesar Salad. She let me keep them both and I couldn't decide which one I loved more. It's like saying, which child do you love the most? Well, it depends on the day.

The decription of menu items seemed all so delicious. We gave a few items a try...

In the ""Gnudi"":
Fig jam, baked ricotta, truffle honey, roasted almonds, arugula on cranberry walnut crostini. They look like takoyaki with grilled bread on the side. Different textures and flavors in a simple dish. Sweetness from the fig jam and honey, the peppery taste from the arugula, the smokey flavor from the grilled crostini, the mild taste and creaminess from the ricotta, and the crunch from the almonds. 4/5

Oxtail Empanadas:
Empanadas filled with oxtail with lime creme fraiche. Split the empanada in half to release the steam from the hot and juicy oxtail pieces then dip in creme fraiche. I just wish there was more of the tasty filling. 3.5/5

Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider:
Crispy chicken breast with a red pepper remoulade in between red velvet Belgian waffles, with syrup on the side. The chicken itself was nice and crunchy without being heavy on the batter. The remoulade adds heat and tang but the sweet syrup with a hint of alcohol balances it out. I tried to eat this with my hands but the waffles weren't stable enough to hold the heavy chicken and the wet remoulade. Definitely eat with a fork and knife. 4/5

The French Dip:
Roasted prime beef, horseradish cream on a grilled hoagie with truffle chips on the side. I haven't had a good beef sandwich in this country since I moved out of the MidWest. The jus is more like a gravy as it's thicker than your average jus but honestly, you won't even need it. The truffle chips were amazing. They weren't oily and they were freshly-made. They definitely taste like truffles. 5/5

Even with open bar, the server was always filling our drinks and making sure we were doing okay. The food... the food was outstanding! Literally some of the best food most of us had ever had! I was worried because they serve everything family style, which can mean some get more than others..... that was not the case! We could not keep up with the amount of food they were serving us!

So I guess you can say it's somewhere in the middle there. Therapy offers a classier than your usual Fremont restaurant atmosphere. It is definitely fancier and nicer looking than a lot of the restaurants you find on Fremont street, especially so close to the Fremont Street Experience area. 

I've been to Therapy about two times now. The first time was short -- we only ordered the crispy fried pig ears and the fire roasted street corn. Along with those, we ordered two drinks.. the smash and the devil eyes. The pig ears were delicious. It was fried perfectly with some yummy seasoning .. it was on the saltier side of things. If you have had pig ears before, it's pretty gelatinous when you eat them deep fried. The cartilage is also not as hard as they usually are. They're pretty much melted. The fire roasted street corn was amazingly delicious. That lime aioli that goes with it is just perfect. It adds just enough of a tang to the corn. The drinks, on the other hand, was nothing to write home about. The flavors were missing and the watered down alcohol is the only thing that sticks in my memories.

The second time we went, we ordered the crispy fried pig ears, the fire roasted street corn, mixed mushroom flatbread, and the ""big sexy."" The crispy fried pig ears were a miss this time around. They were essentially burnt with no flavor. We had to get them to remake it for us and even when they remade them, it was still not as good as the first visit. It had too much batter with little to no seasoning. The fire roasted street corn was still very delicious. The mixed mushroom flatbread was amazingly delicious. The poached egg on the flatbread just brought all the flavors together in a whirlwind of tastyness. The ""big sexy"" .. the meat in the burger is very well seasoned. The tomato that they used and the brie that they used was definitely a different spin on everything. Overall, it meshed in perfectly. 

We sat upstairs during our second visit and the service was slow. I guess no one wants to walk the stairs! Haha. Therapy is a good place to try some out of the ordinary food. However, the prices are a bit on the high side. Four pieces of corn for $8? Yeah, talk about steep for certain things that you can get for less than a dollar. Nonetheless, it's still a decent place just to grab a bite or two with a group of friends.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,2,4,RHN8jQ7zZrMUkI1LR2bhrw

We were seated right away and the decor is nice, so matching with the decent reviews I was super hopeful.
We received water right away and my boyfriend asked about beers, but the waiter walked away before he could actually order. 
We ordered the crab dip with blue corn chips and that was super tasty. 
I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp- this is the description:
Fresh Parmesan, Creamy Black Pepper And Garlic Dressing, Served With Garlic Parmesan Toast
Shrimp / Chicken

There was no Parmesan. The crostini were mediocre- it was literally a pile of romaine with garbage dressing. The shrimp was $7 more for a total of $17 for a shrimp Caesar and there were 3 SHRIMP! I have no problem paying for extras, but what is the point?! 

My boyfriend got the filet mignon and he asked if he could get mushrooms- the waiter mumbled something about vegetables and when his dinner they brought him a big thing of brussel sprouts?

I've been enjoying the new revival of downtown...E.A.T., Carson's kitchen, the Perch, etc. This restaurant delivers on the sleek and modern interior but falls considerably short on the rest. The food was ok. Out of the 3 shareable items we ordered the mushroom Flatbread was the tastiest. It's small and made with puff pastry but I liked the egg addition. The oxtail empenadas weren't bad but nothing I'd order again. They were small 2 bite empenadas. The mac and cheese was bland and void of flavor aside from the occasional bite of bacon. The sauce was more of a bechemel with very little cheese flavor at all. The waitress, although pleasant, was borderline car salesman-like. By that I mean, I felt pressured to order more food. She also blatantly interrupted our conversation to tell us more details about the items we had already ordered while we were waiting for them to be prepared. I also don't appreciate  being given only the option of 2 different bottled waters when I ask for water. I want tap water..yeah I know it's appalling, my apologies. The elder melon drink was another letdown. Priced at $12 and being given the sales pitch about how it's a sangria and made fresh daily on the premises, I guess I expected too much. The drink was small and tasted like a strong alcohol with a watermelon chunk in it. It resembled nothing of any sangria I've tasted before, no sweet fruity flavor. After we were done eating and were presented with our check...it took ages to get someone to take it. I ended up flagging down another waitress and asking her to take it, if I had cash I would've just left it on the table.  My final gripe is that there is no happy hour menu. We ate 3 appetizers and had 3 drinks...the bill was $77 and change. Sooooo not worth it.

My girlfriend is in town from SF, so we had some big 'foodie shoes' to fill with finding places in Vegas to show her - I was up for the challenge and enjoyed bringing her outside of the usual 'Vegas Strip"" scene to Fremont.

We went first to Oak and Ivy - my favorite bar so far - which she loved, and immediately hopped onto Yelp to find a local restaurant near where we were walking... Enter: Therapy.

SERVICE: PHENOMENAL. Our bartender/server Manny was so friendly and descriptive of the menu. He knew each item, which he would refer, and took us on our first journey through their new menu seamlessly. The other wait staff never hesitated to refill water, check on us - the manager on duty came by and welcomed us to Vegas. 

FOOD: We were floored! We had bourbon blackberry cocktails (called the Smash) - and I'm not the one to usually enjoy bourbon. We all shared a bunch of appetizers and food items including the Chimichurri Skirt steak with crispy onions, red velvet chicken and waffles, the Pretzel bread bites, roasted asparagus and roasted/charred kale.... the steak was so tender...the bread bites made in house with a beer cheese sauce...and the roasted veggies were devine. The red velvet chicken and waffles had juicy chicken and the waffles weren't too sweet or too dense...probably my favorite chicken and waffles I've had with two very nice sized ""sliders"". We also shared the cast iron S'mores - and let me tell you, we added bacon which was the right choice and TORE IT UP!

SCENE: Comfortable seating and a great style to the joint! I loved the vibe here and also the cleanliness!

They have their gluten-free dishes itemized, which was nice for my bae who eats GF. Options include their signature salad, beets by therapy salad, Brussels sprouts, crab dip, short ribs, hunters chicken, pork chop and filet mignon. They also have vegan items pointed out, but there are just 2 of them.

We tried the truffle fries. I'm not a big fan of truffle and I thought there was just enough truffle oil. My bae who LOVES truffle says they were good but lacked enough truffle flavor. Take form that what you will. Every fry was eaten regardless.

The ""devils on horseback"" is their bacon wrapped dates. They were pretty basic for me, nothing special from what I've had elsewhere. They were yummy as bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese always are. 

The crab dip was a highlight for me. I couldn't stop eating it. I agree that it's probably not lump crab, or if it started as lump crab then they flaked it. In any event, the dish is creamy and delicious and full of crab flavor. 

The pork chop was thick but a little dry. We weren't a fan of the mustard potato mash. Next time I come I'm going to try a different entre.

ROAST DUCK ($26): 
Crispy-skinned duck breast was perfectly cooked (the best fat rendered duck skin I've ever had!). It was served atop a bed of pureed butternut squash and roasted root veggies. I could've done without the roasted root veggies though because it was too briny. 
The sweet huckleberry reduction and pepita seed granola brittle was a nice touch. 

THERAPY'S CRAB DIP ($16):
Gluten-free dish that was pretty damn good. It wasn't lump crab meat as advertised but there was a lot of crab meat & tasty melted parmesan nonetheless. We didn't taste any artichokes in the dip though.

FRENCH DIP SANDWICH ($17):
Really tender roasted prime beef with aged cheddah served on a nicely toasted hoagie roll. The fries were nicely seasoned and really crispy too.
Absent was the advertised creamy horseradish. Still a tasty sammie overall. 

KOREAN BBQ BAO ($15 for 3):
My favorite dish of the night! Super tender slow-braised pork belly that just melts in your mouth. 
The thin ""Korean BBQ sauce"" was sweet & savory and didn't overpower the precious pork belly at all.
The ripe kimchi and pickled julienned carrots added a nice crunchy texture to each delicious bite.

Husband and I got some hours in to do what lovers do.   So of course that meant...beer hopping! Isn't that what lovers do--beer hop? Lol. Well, whatever...that's what we did that night. What a great place to kick off our evening--therapy. 

We entered, immediately greeted then seated, and seated on the 2nd floor because yes...it has an upstairs seating overlooking all of you down there. If your legs are aching from a leg workout, watching you walk up the stairs to get to the 2nd floor would be so entertaining.

 I loved the decor of this place. The flooring, the seating color, etc...just my type of spot.

Long story short...since we were planning on hopping around, alls we ordered was the ""In the gnudi"" and a 20oz Stella. It is a baked ricotta shaped into the size of an eyeball (or what I believe to be) served on top of a crostini with fig jam and honey dropped atop
And holy gnudi did it leave me in the gnudi for a gnudi. Btw, gnudi...pronounced like nudey. 

Apparently, it's an award winning appetizer per the waitress. Not surprising because it was fantastic! The waitress informed us most their menu is meant to be shareable...13 bucks and 6pcs of these little guys, I say one man for themself. Don't share! Lol. 

If you ever make it in, I highly recommend the gnudi if you are a crostini type of folk or ricotta is your shiz. We were trying to catch their happy hour, but it ended at 5 and it's at the bar only. So NOTE that homeboy/girl.

Highly recommend. I honestly wouldn't bring my children in here because the menu and pricing isn't kid friendly. If the first floor is busy and you are seated upstairs with a stroller, infant carseat, etc... bah humbug.

First off. The wrapped dates were so over cooked our bacon was black. And that made it out of the kitchen. They were extremely chewy. 

Second, the ricotta small plate was bland and had an odd texture. 

The other thing id say is their signature dish, the chicken and waffles.. was okay but nothing special. Could not tell at all the waffles were red velvet.

My drink was so overmuddled with raspberries, you couldn't drink it through the mini straw they provided.

5529598,2015-09-02,55,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"When comparing the hot triple threat of New American eats in DTLV, Therapy reluctantly gets the bronze medal by a few tenths of a point.  It's still worthy, offering things the others don't, like cozier seating, a nice sized bar, and the only place on the block with big TV's for sports.  But despite a few interesting menu twists, their dishes either match similarly in quality to their competitors or fall a bit short, but never really surpass.         

The ""Crispy Fried Pig Ears"" are presented like a bride's bouquet at a high end redneck wedding.  This group friendly dish came a lot crispier with less breading on my most recent visit, which I felt to be not as good as my initial time; it still magically disappeared though.  The truffle honey mustard dipping sauce is kind of gross, so I just eat them straight, preferably with a large glass of Hamm's.  

Another great partner with beer is ""Popcorn"".  The fried peanuts and maple candied bacon make for wonderful companions, but sharing this with actual companions is slightly awkward since you'll basically be eating bits that were touched, but unsuccessfully attempted to be picked up, by others when diving in for their handful.  I wanted chopsticks!  A bigger bowl with a mini shovel would work better.  I'd like a couple of hits of whatever the chef was smoking when he thought of this one.   

The ""Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider"" is an eye catcher with all its color, but a crispier waffle would have made for a functional sandwich instead of sloppiness on a plate.  The fried chicken itself was crispy and very juicy.  I would have been down with just a bucket of that.  Definitely worth returning for, but I'll be eating this all deconstructed with a fork and knife next time.

One dish to be avoided is the ""Roasted Cauliflower"".  The extreme char masked any signs of seasoning.  That place on Carson that starts with a ""G"" does an incredible version of this.  Get the excellent ""Street Corn"" instead or save the extra bucks (and room) for one of Therapy's great desserts like carrot cake or smores.

The staff here was really nice and on the ball, I always appreciate that in a place.

I came here with a big group so I was able to try a bunch of their dishes. All the food here was actually really good, a nice surprise, and even though it looks like not enough food on your plate for most dishes, it usual has ended up being just the perfect amount of food. I had the pork sliders which came in a portion of 3, with nothing else but it really was okay, I felt full after eating them.  A burger here will set you back about 16 bucks but it will be worth it. They are made from wagu beef, and one of the best burgers I have had in Vegas living there about 6 years now. It comes with fries too which were handcut and freshly made, a nice touch.The side portion of carrots were interesting to note. They looked like a bunch of freshly picked long stem carrots that were soaked in honey or something similar, but were good. The seafood dishes also looked impressive and no one was unhappy with their meal after we left. They do offer a dessert selection as well, but we were so full that we only tried two of them. Both were good choices-if you want to see pictures of multiple food items of any desserts check out my photos for this place.

I understand the desire to reinvigorate downtown but know your audience.  Sandwiching this place between the vanguard lounge and a local coffee shop is not going to generate customers.  The atmosphere is actually quite barren, part of the disheartening trend to push customers through without comfortable dining.  The menu is sparse but with interesting options.  

We tried the chicken meatballs, devils on horeseback and the shrimp scampi.  The chicken meatballs were ok but nothing to write home about.  The devils on horseback were very disappointing.  The shrimp was good but be warned, it is a small plate and comes just with shrimp and toast.  The toast is forgettable.  We did enjoy the cast iron smores with bacon which was the star of the night.

 We have our priorities after a day of meetings, so off to the bar we went after racing each other downtown. Came in during happy hour, which was nice for a pre-dinner cocktail.

 Dinner and appetizers came out promptly and everything was delicious. There was a shared appetizer of bacon wrapped dates and pretzels, dates got a raving review. 
 I had roasted cauliflower and steak tartar. Rest of my party ordered pretty much everything else on the menu and everyone was happy. Shrimp scampi smelled heavenly and pork chop looked amazing. 
 Had to have a house margarita, which was nice and strong, and also made me forget about looming fourth quarter.
 I loved the atmosphere and most of all the owner, Roger, who was ever present in the dining room and engaged with our group all night. I especially appreciated Roger expressing his concern that food for our party would come out at varied times, we acknowledged that it was perfectly acceptable, and he coordinated it beautifully. Nice contrast to Public School we visited night before, where to our disappointment some in our party were already eating, while others barely had a chance to place their orders.

For dinner, I got a filet, which was so tasty!! I almost ordered it again the second visit but after a tiny bite of the short rib I couldn't say no to that. Oh yea, on that note.. the short rib is amazing. The polenta that it's served on is meh, but the meat is amazing.

Everything else was really tasty and we went through every last bite of food!  A few rounds of wine, 5 small plates, and the bill was $100, including tax and tip.  Not bad!

I was recommended to come here by a friend who was completely correct in their recommendation (The Ricky Ricardo sandwich IS absolutely amazing!) but I found the rest of the evening to be pretty hit or miss.

First, my cocktail was gross.  I know, I know... if I didn't like it I should have said something but I hate sending stuff back and I always feel like ""well you ordered it, grin and bear it.""  I just thought it would be good because it's named after the restaurant.

We got a bunch of apps to share and each of us got an entree.  Some things really stood out as delicious, like the gnudi and the cuban sandwich and some things were just eh, like the devils on horseback and the shortrib.  I think I'd rather be underwhelmed in general than to think some things are excellent and some things are terrible.

A service note that bothered me a bit was that it was my birthday and yet there was no acknowledgment of it.  I mean, I'm not the ""give me free stuff on my birthday"" type but I've never been to a restaurant that didn't even say happy birthday to the birthday person.

We each ordered appetizers, main dishes, drinks, and, as our waiter was informed, our intent was to sample and share everything on the menu.  We came close to it! We were given extra sharp knives, had large plates on which to put our share of appetizers and meals.

Our waiter, Jonathan, was the best; he made excellent recommendations, was very friendly, took our MANY orders through the evening (requiring many trips to the table as we ordered only two or three things at a time) with good spirits and a smile. JoAnn was the expediter that night, and, boy, did she hustle, moving quickly around the restaurant to help servers, even offering to take a group photo of us when she saw what we were attempting. Three others also helped at our table, bringing water, napkins, dishes, clearing; altogether friendly, observant servers making sure the dining experience was the best. Oh, and the manager came to the table to make sure all was well, which was nice!

Yum for the food! The pork belly was the best I've ever eaten, and I'm glad--as I've had it three or four times before and NOT liked it--that I gave it a try. And finished off the plate.  Be warned if you like fat; there was none. All the other pork belly I've had before was just all fat. This was fall-apart tender and flavorful meat.  The Devils on Horseback appetizer was lovely, as was almost everything else. The only dish we didn't scrape the plate for was the macaroni.  It was creamy smooth, but just too bland even after we added salt and pepper to it.

She said she was going to do it when we closed out, which makes no sense whatsoever. When my boyfriend and I were nearly done is when she came to check on us. We both work here in Vegas in the restaurant industry and her act was highly unacceptable. Sad to say this place could have easily gotten 5 stars since the food was delicious and reasonably priced. Will return when they have a better serviced bartender.",xRZBVvCJy8LOefuwgb99Rg,0,0,1,z5gE3KSEddrMURXE5gSD6g

Hubby had the french dip and I ordered the portobello mushroom burger. You have a choice of a side and we opted for fries. The fries were crispy and made from real potatoes. I liked that the bun of my portobello burger was toasted to keep it from being soggy.

We ate at the bar and ordered a couple of their specialty cocktails. Drinks at the casino restaurants are $15 and up so I was thrilled that the drinks here were only $12! I can't remember the name of the drink but it was something that had peach jam in it. OMG it was GOOD!! Not too sweet, but a good balance of sweet and sour.

The service was friendly and the bartenders know their craft. It was fun talking to them and learning how different flavors are paired. This is not a cheezy, overpriced place with mediocre food and drinks. But, if you are looking for good hand-crafted food and drinks made with quality ingredients (and love), then Therapy is your place!",85lFIofoE39PqVwBCRXFQQ,3,2,4,OlP61wiZ9BxT8FBZouAy9A
5919754,2018-03-09,0,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,Service and follow up is great here.  The drinks were excellent. My Pina colada was so creamy. The Brussel sprouts appetizer was the best I've had. I also had the red velvet waffles with chicken and it was so good.  The macaroni dish was a little sparse. My dad has the tartare Fish and the presentation was excellent. It's not his usual dish but he ate most of it.  I'd definitely make another visit to try other tasty offerings,6eml0Mw8NglMn2GCyJzi-w,1,1,4,4Q5T5iXRN10WvZ9lWar7Gw

5941668,2018-05-27,0,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"Horrible service and the food was subpar at best. The place was not busy at all on a Saturday night (not a good sign), yet our server would go 45 minutes without asking if we wanted drinks or needed anything. Our food took over an hour. They gave us a 10% discount for not having all of our meals out at once (roughly 10 minutes between each) I worked in restaurants for many years, and this place was clearly just run poorly - at least on the night that we came in. Don't get the beet salad - it is pretty much just a pound of goat cheese on a plate with beets with the stems still on them.",M7DFhi0TrRbXxYwJrUwOTg,1,1,1,gs8dgCBqzut43KW7QRi-Qw

5953698,2017-06-24,9,UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"It's been about a month since I was in here, but I'm definitely impressed by this place. I love the name! It still just makes me giggle. 

My mom, my brother, and I were walking down Fremont Street when we got toward the end. It was insanely hot outside. Imagine that, Vegas being warm! Lol. Anyway, my brother and I were going to walk back to find the car and pick my mother up. 

We left her here, at Therapy. This made for a hilarious joke! My brother and I annoyed her so damn bad, that she had to go get therapy, and a few drinks to make it through the rest of the day with us. Just kidding, but we did tell people this. 

We left here here for approximately half an hour. She found a spot by the window, so we could just drive up and pick her up. Gave her money in case she really did want to drink while we were gone. 

The staff were super sweet to her while she was there. They didn't mind she wanted to sit by the window while she waited. They brought her water, even adding extra ice after she requested it. They didn't seem worried about her that she wasn't ordering anything. They were more than happy to let her get out of the Vegas heat and simply hang out while she waited for us. 

I'm not really one to go into a business like this if I'm not planning on buying anything. A business is there to make money, so someone taking up a table and not ordering anything basically costs them money. Is it the nice thing to do? Absolutely. I'm always impressed by a business that can look at something like that from a personal standpoint, versus a cold business standpoint. I wouldn't do it again, but I appreciated the fact they let my mother get off her feet for a bit (she's not too steady on her feet, which is why we went to find the car and left her there to rest) and just get some water in her and cool down from the heat. 

It is a place that deserves both my business and recognition for being so kind to my elderly mother. It makes me love it that much more, and the next time I am in Vegas, I will make it a point to stop in and try some of their food and drinks.
