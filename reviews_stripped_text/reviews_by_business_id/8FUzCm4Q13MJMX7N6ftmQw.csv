She took our drink orders and came back immediately to take our food order.
We opted for General's chicken, Hong Kong crispy noodles and one order of their pot stickers.  I tried to order the Hong Kong dish as an individual dinner as it comes with egg rolls, soup and choice of rice, but it was not one of the choices.  Our very friendly waitress advised that she would bring a free soup and a free order of egg rolls anyway.

The wife said the General's chicken was very good and my Crispy Hong Kong noodles were spectacular.  The egg rolls were very hot and crispy, giving them a wonderful taste.  Sweet and sour sauce was provided.  The potstickers, six nice ones, were the best we have tasted.  

Orders were very generous portions and we both brought home plenty of leftovers.

1543846,2015-06-23,1,8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw,"Tried this for the first time tonight... with trepidation, based on the scary meals we've had at other Chinese restaurants here in the northwest valley. Surprisingly, pretty good!

First, the reasons for not giving 5 stars:

The potsticker dough was too thick, made them chewy and a bit unpleasant. Also, everything was served on Styrofoam plates with a plastic fork and spoon each. As the potstickers were large, I had to cut them up using the edge of a plastic spoon. Finally, while the complimentary eggrolls were nice, no spicy mustard was served.

Now for the good, and there was a lot.... huge servings per entree, each was enough to feed two hungry people alone. They were made fresh, and the sauces were good & flavorful. Also, when they say spicy, it IS! 

We ordered Szechuan (Hot garlic) Pork and General Tso's Chicken (Hubby's favorite). Both were good and we're definitely eating there again. Though, based on the plasticware, we might go for delivery or carry-out next time. Dinner was under $30 with tons of leftovers, and I noted that they deliver within six miles for $2.00.

UPDATE:

We got take-out when we had company last weekend and it was horrible. They said it would be ready in 10 minutes, luckily we got there early as it was already done. Got it home (VERY short drive and in the desert heat) and the food was all cold.

Crab Rangoons.. very little filling, absolutely zero flavor
Beef Broccoli - okay, needed more sauce, nothing special
Pork with String Beans - same as the Beef
Orange Chicken - I don't know what that chicken did to piss them off but apparently it was nasty. They pounded chicken to thin oblivion and breaded/fried it, served it with sickly sweet orange sauce on the side. It was chewy and tasteless without the sauce; sweet, chewy and boring with the sauce. Definitely the most hated entree of the night.

All four of us tasted everything then tossed it all out. Sad follow-up to what had been a great intro!",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,3,1,3,_ZefMmvANaRkWtU7NlineA

Having just completed some errands in the area, it was confirmed with the GF, neither of us wanted to cook or clean anything.  It was decided between the both of us, Asian would be the meal of the evening.

I grabbed the smartphone and fired up the all knowing yelp app to see what my options were.  A quick reading of several reviews and I was sold on China Hot Wok.

A quick drive down Tenaya to Craig and CHW was located with ease.  I walked in and took notice of the semi-small dining area, but the cooking and prep area seemed larger and was teaming with activity.  

I stared at the menu on the wall and was unable to comprehend the menu...because everything looked delicious, I could not decide on what to order.

I grabbed a menu and started reading that.  I spied the weekly menu and saw they were doing sesame balls.  That would be the first thing I would order. 

I decided to give the Individual Dinner a shot.  A non-seafood item is going to run you $10.98.  This includes fried or steamed rice or chow mien, 2 egg rolls or 2 crab rangoon, egg drop or hot and hot sour soup, or wonton soup.  I picked the General Tso Chicken.

I ordered up for the GF, the Chef Signature Honey Walnut Chicken (12.98).  It came with a heaping serving of rice.  More on this meal to come...

The nice lady behind the counter was all smiles and friendly.  She was smiling even when she was taking orders over the telephone.

They were busy but my dinner-to-go, was out in quick fashion.

The particular type of food does not travel well.  By the time I made it home and the GF and I started eating, I did really take to General Chicken.  That being said, the Honey Walnut Chicken was awesome!  It serving size was enormous and puts all the other corporate Asian cuisine restaurants to shame.

The rice was good and the serving size of wonton soup was enormous and tasty.  

Heck yay, I am a fan.  I will happily stop by again when the family does not want to cook or do dishes.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,10,8,4,gfh-jLrT4Het5f5P-VfwiQ

Lunch special is until 4 pm each day and you get rice, noodles, egg rolls, and entree for $8. My favorite has been the mongoian beef and it comes with veggies I actually eat like onions and bell peppers complimenting the dish nicely. If you like your dishes extra spicy then just ask when ordering and they will hook it up. The pot stickers are really good and 6 come in the order at just under a buck each. I have ordered the pot stickers a few times now and it's been consistent and delicious. My wife really likes the fried won tons and the couple that I tried were pretty good. The noodles can be made with or without veggies, an option I like and the ones without veggies I had was pretty darn good. If you have room for dessert give the Chinese Donuts a try. The donuts come with sugar on them (ask for light or none if desired) and had a lightly crispy outside and softer inside and they were good.

I consider myself a foodie, and I have no problem driving anywhere for truly delicious food, regardless of the type of cuisine.  As far as Chinese cuisine is concerned, in Los Angeles, we drove to Chinatown to go to Yang Chow, or to Shanghai Grill near Beverly Hills.

Since we discovered it, China Hot Wok is now our go to spot for good Chinese food.  There are not that many tables for dining in, however the restaurant is clean, and the staff is very friendly and courteous.  Nina is super nice.

What we really appreciate is that they will make  any dish that you want, even if it is not on the menu.  They will also add or exclude whichever ingredient or vegetable, or make it more mild or as spicy as you would like.  We like their hot and sour soup made with pork, rather than seafood.  I like to put in some hot chili oil to make it more spicy.  Also, if you find a dish a little too sweet, you can ask them not to add any sugar, or as little oil as possible, etc... 

Also, they have squid, which most Chinese restaurants do not have, even some of the upscale restaurants.  I love Kung Pao squid, extra spicy!!  China Hot Wok also has big portions.  Two people can share one of their lunch specials, which are very reasonably priced, or you can have lunch and have enough left over for dinner.

I've been waiting forever for this place to open as it is close to my home. Every time I walked past the restaurant I saw more and more pieces of furniture going in.  Finally,  the lit up Boba and open sign appeared! Yay! 

The owner Sharry is a bubbly and sweet girl who warmly greeted me and asked me what my preferences were in terms of spicy and overall flavor. One thing that I liked was the fact that they had an open kitchen so you could see all of the preparation.

I opted to get one of the ""individual dinners. ""

The sweet and sour soup was my starter: smooth and not spicy, chunky with ingredients. 

Next was crab Rangoon. Perfectly fried,  just wish there was a tiny bit more crab. 

Spring roll was delicious.  Best thing of the menu.  Lightly fried,  tons of seasoned, crispy shredded veggies inside. 

The curry chicken was well prepared but since I asked for spicy, it was a surprise to taste how mild it was. 

My main compliment for the restaurant is how well everything is fried - no trace of greasy.

My portion size for individual was huge.  I took most of it to go!

This is going to be ridiculous because no one should have to write reviews on bad service, but know that the food is a little blander than other Chinese food places, but overall not terrible. So we order Family dinner b with sweet-and-sour chicken and mixed kung poa. Comes with hot and sour soup, 2 egg rolls (more like a thicker spring roll), two fried shrimp and 2 crab rangoon. The latter 3 need sweet and sour sauce as well as our sweet-and-sour chicken. We only had one sweet and sour sauce, which by pics you can tell is less than 8oz. Hell with even just one 8oz. you'd still be left with desert dry chicken choking all the moisture from your body. We called and asked what's the deal and she had the stones to say ppl like it that way. Bitch wtf!?!@ Do people like calloused dry handjobs where you come from?! No way in hell is that enough sauce for sweet-and-sour chicken and two fried shrimp and two crab Rangoon and two eggrolls. 

I came back the next day since she promised she would give me the sauce the next day because we would have it for lunch. She looked at me like I was some alien when I asked for the sauce (it's not too far and I had to be at Albertsons). She still insisted that some people think that it is too much sauce.

We used to enjoy the restaurant based mainly on its convenient location. The food has always been good in my husband's opinion, and alright in mine and the kids. The price is in line with other Asian restaurants that have better tasting food, but as I said the location was really what helped this restaurant. Especially due to a sudden lack of transportation. 
On the plus side the food does consistently remain alright. 
We had not visited in a while, but did order from them twice within the last three weeks. The first time we waited just over an hour and 45 minutes for a delivery order. I called at the point of just about an hour wait and was told that it was on it's way. I called again at that hour and 45 minute mark to be asked to confirm the address, which they did have correct, but I was told the order was back in the restaurant. Completely frustrated, and now had a famished family I stated to never mind the delivery that I would come pick it up. There was no real apology or empathy shown. The food was alright in the end of it all. My husband's order was better, and something we hadn't ordered in the past. 
About a week later we place a pick up order & ordered the Ginger Beef again as we did like my husband's. Only this time it was not nearly as good and didn't taste like Ginger at all. It didn't really taste like anything other than plain beef. I called to confirm what we had ordered, let them know it wasn't flavored at all and that we still had the full order. They made no apology, or effort. All that I was told was to ask for extra Ginger on our next order. She completely missed the fact that we had a $40.00 order of Ginger Beef in front of us that missed the mark entirely. Claerly the ginger had been forgotten during preparation. She seemed to be relying on the communication gap, and the order being lost in translation. I was repeatedly asked to just order it with extra ginger next time. 
The fact of the matter is, I simply won't place another order. There won't be a next time. It has been about a week since the incident, but because I am still a bit heated over it all and with a recent request from Google to share our experience, I figured I may as well.

We placed our order online and paid for it. Then headed over to pick our order up. We had ordered Wor Wonton Soup, String Bean Beef, Vegetable Chow Mein, Crab Rangoon, 2 orders of Sweet Sour Chicken and 2 orders of Chicken Fried Rice (one was suppose to be free as part of a special). The order did come with 3 things of plain rice as well. They were packaging up our food right as we arrived. The lady who helped us was very friendly and said to call in our order next time and they would give us a discount. We took our food and left. We realized when we got home that they only gave us one thing of fried rice (we didn't get the free order of fried rice). The food was ok. Felt the Sweet Sour Chicken could have used more pineapple chunks (only found a few in each order). Same with the Chicken Fried Rice. Only found a few pieces of small chicken. Everything else was ok. Not sure we'll be back though considering we paid $57 for everything. Bit pricey for just ok food.",TqKDnj5_IthGvPCGgN1qvQ,0,0,3,rFHBup-3_TUcQcBwYzufnA
2290911,2018-05-06,3,8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw,"China Hot Wok is located in a busy shopping center. My first visit ever was last week when I was in the area running errands nearby. I used my Yelp app to find a place close by to grab dinner and found this tasty place.

China Hot Wok is a step above your usual Chinese take out spot. It actually has a decent amount of seating for those wanting to dine in. The cashier will take your order if you are just picking up to go, or in our case she came to our table to take our order. She was friendly, refilled our drinks, and even offered us a free order of pot stickers! I was a fan just from that simple gesture. How nice is that? 

We ordered the general tso chicken, hunan beer, combination (beef and shrimp) noodles, and salt and pepper pork. Steamed white rice was included with our order and they were definitely not stingy about the portion. She even offered to bring us more rice if we wanted. The pot stickers were homemade and even though they were a little bit different than I expected, I still liked them! My favorite dish was the hunan beef. The food was great for the price! Four dishes, a mountain of rice, two drinks and free pot stickers put our bill around $45. Not too shabby considering I now had leftover that I could take to work for lunch the next day (and then some!). 

I would definitely come back if I ever found myself hungry on this side of town. The ingredients were fresh and everything we ordered was on point. Not too forget the huge portions-- perfect for family gatherings and such. 

Pro Tip: bring cash! I saw on the specials board that there was a deal for a free half entree for those who are paying with cash. Not sure if it's an on going offer, but I thought that was pretty cool deal.",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,6,6,4,ckCRuw4Mm4KpZEK_yIFiNQ

I'm not sure how they plan to make a profit unless they are going to be very very busy. At any rate I ordered hot sour soup and sizzling rice soup. Both were very good, hearty and taste very much like the ones I was used to from San Francisco. Next, Chinese chicken salad which, is one of those items that is been made popular in American Chinese restaurants. This was basically some mixed field greens, sliced fried chicken breast, some crispy wonton skin and assorted salad vegetables. The salad dressing is light and actually quite good. It's nothing like the cheesecake factory version however I would order this item here again. The orange chicken was decent, Albeit made with a little too much cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The flavor was surprisingly good. The last and weakest item I ordered was chicken Pad Thai. Being that it is a Chinese restaurant, my expectations for this dish were quite low. Call it a test. My expectations were aptly met. I would delete this item from the menu all together and focus on what you do best which is Chinese.

-Paper wrap chicken is super good. I had no idea what it was but ordered it anyway. It seems to me to be ground chicken steamed in little foil packets....? Not totally sure but it was spot on and didn't need any dipping sauce or anything.

The chicken chow mein was delicious. Most of the time chow mein can be a bit greats but this wasn't. The onion was cut a bit to big for our liking but that pretty much was the only complaint on the whole order.

3519541,2016-03-29,57,8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw,"I stopped here to China Hot Wok for some lunch to-go and was pleased enough with the service and food to come back to place a to-go order for dinner the following week. They have tables/seating inside and the employees were nice and helpful with going over items on the menu and current specials going on. Even though they do have coupons on their website and menus, they are not necessary. One of the girls working told me that they have specials written on the board daily, but there are more offered depending on the amount that you spend and the coupons attached to the to-go menus are just to remind you to ask for your freebie and they are cool with making certain adjustments if there is something else you are wanting to try. This place was very busy with both people eating inside as well picking up orders. My order took about 15 minutes the first time and about 10 minutes the second time to be ready which did not bother me since I saw how busy it was and knew it was being made fresh. 

Fried Wonton ($4.98 for 12) - I didn't think these looked appetizing the first time however they were so tasty that I wanted to order them again on my next visit. They are filled with ground chicken and onions and I felt no shame about eating all 12 of these crispy, tasty gems.

Pot Sticker ($5.98 for 6) - Filled with chicken and green onions. I prefer pork, but these tasted good and it was a nice portion for the price. Hubby liked them much more. 

Vegetable Egg Rolls ($1.98 for 2) Hubby didn't like these however I'm sure it was because there was veggies inside of which he's not a fan. I personally loved them and really liked that they weren't greasy.

Chow Mein ($6.58) - I asked for noodles with no veggies and they had no problem with my request. The noodles were good and more than enough for 2 people. 

Hot Garlic Chicken ($8.98) - This dish has chicken, carrots, mushrooms, bell pepper and onions stir-fried in a spicy szechwan sauce. I really liked this a lot, but there was nothing spicy about it. It had great flavor and I'd totally order it again, I just didn't get any heat from the dish. I put some of it over the white rice that came with it and it was really tasty. 

Chinese Donuts ($3.98 for 10) - If you don't like sweet things this isn't for you. These fried donuts are covered in sugar. I couldn't sit there and eat a bunch at once, but they were actually good! The donut alone tasted like a cruller and I am sure they can make some without sugar or you could ask them to go light, so if you are a fan of crullers give these Chinese Donuts a try. 

Mongolian Beef Lunch Special Combo ($7.58) - The price and portion was very good. I was impressed with the amount of beef there was and it came with rice, noodles, 2 veggie egg rolls (you can choose egg rolls or crab rangoons) and a fountain drink. The Mongolian Beef is stir-fried with veggies in a spicy Mongolian sauce. The first time I had this with the lunch special it had a nice kick, but the next visit when I ordered a full portion ($9.28) it lacked the heat it had previously. The beef was still delicious and worth the money however I will make sure and request it extra spicy when ordering in the future.

This isn't super close to my place, but I'm willing to travel because so far I've had pleasant food and service experience. Everyone knows it's tough to find a decent Chinese place. This spot is definitely worth a try if you find yourself wanting some Americanized Chinese eats.

I only really order the chicken noodle soup and wonton soup, but I will branch out eventually. The chicken noodle soup is delicious, with lots of noodles, vegetables, tasty chicken, and a great light broth. They separate the noodles out which is nice. The wonton soup is also good, but I wish they would pack the broth and the wontons & veggies separately because the wontons tend to sort of deteriorate when left in the broth for an extended amount of time. No one likes gummy wontons. No one! Other than that, pretty gosh dang tasty. The wonton soup is the Wor kind so it has all the goodies. Chicken, veggies, BBQ pork, wontons, all in a yummy broth. I've eaten a lot of wonton soup in my day and this hits the spot. 

They pack you up some crispy wontons and sweet and sour sauce, which is a nice touch. On to go orders, they put in napkins and cutlery in your bag as well. Please separate the wontons from the broth and you will be five stars for me, China Hot Wok!

Pick up is easy and they always have my order ready. The ladies are always nice during our brief interaction. I will continue to frequent this place and try other dishes. Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. Get yo wok on!",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,2,1,3,OC8yy1J05ytgRYDq9aN8UQ

This had more bean sprouts than what I am used to receiving but that isn't a problem.  Thats just texture.  There was not shortage of noodles or meat which is the important thing.  I got a lot of food for a completely average price.  Service was great as well.  The lady at the register was very friendly and the food was ready quite fast.  I'll be back for sure.

I especially loved the Kung Pow Chicken.....really great spice!
Other honorable mentions are the Shrimp with Lobster sauce and the Chicken with Black Pepper Sauce.
As the Yelp reviews have mentioned.... the portions are huge! You can opt for Fried Rice instead of White Rice with your Entree', I ordered two Entree's with White Rice and two with Fried Rice. I ended up with an enormous amount of fried rice!
Delivery was extremely fast and food was quality, will definitely order again.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,2,1,4,VEohA02zvqRiTuoFlEM-Yw

It's clean, the service was really good, and the menu was typical.

   We ordered two of the ""individual dinners"". For the price you get a lot more for your buck instead of ordering the entrees separately. We ordered a General Tso's Chicken with hot and sour soup, fried rice and (2) crab rangoons, then a Sweet and Sour Chicken with wonton soup, steamed rice and (2) vegetable eggrolls. Then an order of Honey Walnut Shrimp. 
   The delivery was right on time and the food was delicious and fresh. I was taken aback by the General Tso's chicken because my first bite I bit into a pepper! Hahaha, but it was very good. The Honey Walnut Shrimp, eggrolls and rangoons were still crispy. Although the rangoons had barely little filling. We asked specifically for utensils (chopsticks, forks and hopefully spoons because we ordered soup) but received none. We'd order from here again.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,0,4,wXKi1s7twDrgb9hZaFfenw

They're friendly. It's only taken a few minutes to get my order. And it's relatively consistent. 

The Singapore noodles have plenty of flavor, and a substantial amount of meat. In particular, I always seem to get a lot of shrimp, which is awesome, because they're well cooked and delicious. Nothing is greasy. And I always ask for it to be very spicy, and they do a reasonable job of giving it a little kick. 

The egg rolls are good, I usually don't like egg rolls but these are nice and crunchy and don't taste like old cabbage.  

The hot mustard is legit, just have to ask for it. Very hot, exactly how it should be.

We came here during lunch hour and they offer a wide variety of dishes to choose from for under $10! While we were looking through our menu, they gave us a bowl of egg drop soup and fortune cookies. That made us really happy!

I ordered the honey walnut shrimp (not on lunch menu) and my other party ordered the Mongolian beef. We were amazed of how fast it came out and how beautiful and delicious it looked.

The young lady that answers the phone to take your order is polite and patient.  

We have enjoyed:
Wonton Soup - tasty broth and delicious ingredients
Hot and Sour Soup - nice balance
Orange Chicken - perfect amount of tangy sauce and crispy 
Shrimp with Lobster Sauce - has black beans and green pepper.
Honey Walnut Shrimp - scrumptious
Combination Fried Rice - wonderful

The lady who normally works behind the counter is always friendly and helpful, even when they're really busy. If you order a large amount of food, you can get a free entree or appetizer, depending on how much you spent. Even with just two people, we normally get a free plate of Chinese doughnuts, egg rolls, or crab rangoons.

My favorite dish here is the Hong Kong Crispy Noodle (a.k.a. pan-fried noodles), but the Salt and Pepper Porkchops are great, as are the Walnut Shrimp and most everything else.

Again, the portions are pretty large, and each entree hovers around $10. I've ordered only one entree for myself and walked out with leftovers.

Ordered delivery from here and was a pretty bad experience.
We got General Tso chicken, extra spicy, and also orange chicken. The food arrived cold, it had been sitting for so long that the steam had formed cold water on the lid and was dripping back onto the chicken and made it soggy. To throw in another complaint, the General Tso chicken was not spicy at all.

I'm usually not a picky eater, and can chow through even a mediocre meal. A couple bites and I couldn't stomach anymore, I ended up just eating cold rice and a fortune cookie. Talk about a waste of money. Never ordering from here again.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,6,2,1,1rug0X2FKKlmDwTUaM7hrw

I ordered a ton of stuff for dinner last night. Even though it was just me at home. But, I knew my fiance would want something to snack on later. 
They actually added 3 little things in that I didn't even order. 

What I had:

Spring rolls - Finally. I found my favorite in town. Some of them have way too much celery, but this one was yummy. 
Spicy Garlic Chicken - I ordered spicy. This wasn't even mild. And it was pretty sweet. This was my least favorite. 
Honey walnut Shrimp - to my surprise, this was insanely delicious. It's usually way too breaded, heavy and tiny shrimp. Nope. They used tempura batter, and it was awesome. Highly recommended. 
Salt and Pepper wings - good, but just be ready to want some kind of sauce. 

They added - Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers. The rangoons were super tasty, but the pot stickers, not so much. 

Overall, this place was probably the best fast food Chinese I've had in our area. Fast service, super friendly and of course, an added bonus for throwing in a couple of things. If they saw how little I was, they probably wouldn't have added it.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,20,14,4,DeUyKIB02lhDasFmUzxqMg

The food smelled amazing as we drove home to eat!! But, there were some issues. Here's what we liked / disliked:
Chicken Skewers: The chicken was rubbery, and had a strange sort of glaze on it.
Pot Stickers: The meat inside was not very appealing, had a weird taste / smell to it.
BBQ Pork Fried Rice: Pretty darn good!! Would order this again.
NY Style Chow Mein: Also very good, but they forgot to give us the crispy noodles that go with the dish, which you need to offset all those veggies. I'd order this again, but I'd check to make sure I got those crispy noodles.
Sesame Chicken: Ummm...not like any Sesame Chicken I've ever had before. It was basically Orange Chicken with sesame in top.

China Hot Wok is located in the Albertson's shopping center off Craig and Tenaya. While there is seating available inside, China Hot Wok is best suited for take-out orders. This small fast-food joint is very similar to the set ups of China A GoGo and China One. My family ventured over here on Christmas day for lunch - China Hot Wok graciously resumed its normal business hours on this holiday. We dined in and ended up having a kind of Chinese buffet. 

VEGGIE EGG ROLLS ($1.98, x2): the nice young lady working behind the counter brought out 4 egg rolls instead of 2 and said there was a mistake in the kitchen. Score for us! The veggie egg rolls tasted great. 4/5

SALT AND PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS (FREE, reg. $7.98): There's coupons on the menu that we spotted. We asked the waitress if we could use them, and we did! Can't beat free. My parents and husband were fans. 4/5

BEEF BROCCOLI ($9.28): Never fails, my husband always orders this at Chinese places. No complaints from him! 4/5

ORANGE CHICKEN ($8.98): Dad said it was a-ok. 3/5 Huge portion (but everything served here was gargantuan, to be fair).

CHICKEN CHOP SUEY ($8.98): Mom loved her entree. 5/5

EGGPLANT TOFU ($7.98): I ordered this because it was supposed to be spicy. I wish it was spicier. The eggplant kind of weirded me out, so I just ate the tofu and rice (the texture of the eggplant was too soggy for my liking). I wouldn't order this again, but I would be interested in coming back and ordering another menu item. 3/5

*All entrees came with white rice. The waitress brought out 3 plates of rice and asked if we needed more!*  

Everyone left full and satisfied, so I'd say we had a good run at China Hot Wok. :)

It is so refreshing to have a qualitative family owned Chinese restaurant in a Northwest Las Vegas. They have affordable lunch specials, family meals, and they offer catering services. Sherrie and her staff consistently go above and beyond to delight their customers. They appear to have a pretty loyal following too.

I hosted a few corporate events and the crew at China Hot Wok made them all huge successes. Believe it or not, food has the power to make or break an event. They delivered piping hot and delicious Chinese food from Northwest Las Vegas to North Las Vegas (near the Aliante) which was nearly 20 miles each way. 

The following are my recommendations, but feel free to try everything on the menu:

My daughter and I love their vegetable egg rolls and for only $2 they're a steal.  Their chow mein and fried rice with or without meat are very tasty. I highly suggest their chicken & vegetables--if your feeling healthy, Mongolian beef, orange chicken, beef & broccoli, sweet & sour chicken, or egg foo young.

where you can check the status of the order and the time it can be picked up. how easy is that? I have to say I was a little wary because of stories where orders are placed online, fax or phone,  you get there and food is not ready or they can't find the order, so you wait again, or leave hungry and exasperated. but for my first time it worked and it was seamless.

Now for the food, it was ready at the counter when we went in. we ended up getting the Mongolian beef, general tsao chicken and hot Sour soup. these are our usual in rotation with the beef broccoli at any Chinese restaurant. my daughter was in heaven! she said it was the best Chinese and was happy we got takeout. The hot sour soup was the best I had. they put good size shrimp and imitation crab in there. it comes with won ton strips  to put on top. the Mongolian beef was flavorful, we got medium spice and it was tender. they also stir fry bell peppers and onions with it, makes me wonder what the pepper beef is like? the general tsao chicken was crispy and tender under the sauce they use also had peppers, onions , carrots and pineapple which I don't mind the veggies, but at other restaurants it doesn't come that way. crab ragoon is better than any other I've had. at least you can see the crab and it's jt sweet. spring rolls aren't anything special. it's basically cabbage with a tiny bit for carrot. I would have like to see more carrot and some onion in there. it would make a difference and set it apart from others. 

All in all, this place is very good for the 2 times we've been.  I can't believe we haven't been more. the other time it was at lunch takeout and it's pretty sizeable portions.its very fast, it's chinese after all.icant imagine they would take more than 10mins to prepare. I'd never get delivery, I'm so close, but not close enough to walk and pick up to take home, well maybe if I didn't have a car.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,2,1,5,CBiCerLxFIVa0uwuei0pdA

5690710,2016-01-30,0,8FUzCm4Q13MJMX7N6ftmQw,Good take out w/fresh ingredients and generous portions.  Big menu of wok-cooked Chinese fare served fast and furious.  I was not as impressed w/the flavors of the food as apparently others were.  Not a good dine in place but gr8 lunch specials.  Sea bass in black bean sauce is good.,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,0,0,3,vkOWTTQo9evQLUSVh18jRw

We are big-time yelpers and neither one of us are the huge fans of Chinese food both very picky when it comes to it!!! With that said we locate at this place with her the less than a couple of miles from our house from the time we walked in super friendly service everything we ordered was absolutely fantastic!!! From the war wonton soup the honey walnut shrimp Hong Kong noodles as well as their egg rolls absolutely to die for!!!! Their portions are huge and the leftovers are even better the next day!!! Would definitely try delivery next time as the reviews are great on it and I believe everything would come piping hot as well as top-quality,xMrhd5OHNPmpW4HiH25yTw,0,0,5,CkZTIyr6484HupdAp3oDkw

We called after an hour and fifteen minutes and were told it would be another ten minutes. We called 25 minutes after that and were told it would be another ten minutes, but they would take $10 off. 
So we waited another twenty minutes and haven't heard anything, we call the location and THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE!  They have already charged the credit card and we don't have food.
If you want a timely delivery, a trustworthy company, LOOK ELSEWHERE. One of the Worst experiences we have ever had.",Qkyxbu17EbT2lNfDdTxU0A,4,1,1,75GRCawgFjapQA8YgZQYmA
