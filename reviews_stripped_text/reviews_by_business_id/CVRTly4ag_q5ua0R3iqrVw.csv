3259,2014-10-20,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,Decided to check out this place with friends during our stay at SLS. The food was delicious. The noodles are made from scratch and you can taste the quality. My favorites were the Crispy Bao Bun and the Hakka Fried Rice Pot. It's a great place to have a family style kind of meal. Our server Alex was helpful in food recommendations and just amazing overall. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Vegas.,Di8uJuWvFmJI7Fdy1LQoog,0,0,5,_Ti11ImhYFsfMkS6xnMVDQ

He immediately greeted us with a smile, asked if we've been here before and proceeded to explain every dish on the menu (so patient). I chose the chicken sui (appetizer) and he recommended the lettuce cups......Both ARE AMAZING,  the flavors but especially the freshness of the food. My husband had the lo mein and he also loved it.  

We will definitely be back for more. Thank you Haptu for being a great waiter, you are an asset to Ku Noodle.",dAjok7cvSs0F4p1iHaAJ8w,0,0,5,KyIijnokHOS4d_OqjFWiDw

126688,2016-03-30,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"We had an amazing and memorable experience here at Ku Noodle. There is a nice view of open kitchen as you walk in, so you can see how everything is made. Especially, their handmade noodle was very interesting!

We tried their Hakka Fried Rice and it was amazing. It was totally different fried rice from what I've ever tried before. Each ingredients were making great harmony in one pot. It is served on hot clay pot which keeps your food crispy and warm on your table. Great flavor and great portion as well!

Another must try is their shaved ice! Its texture is just as soft as real snow. Restaurant offers various flavors of ice and topping options you can choose from. They also have option of shot for their dessert so that you can make your own Vegas dessert! We had a Pina Colada with a shot of rum and it was gorgeous. We will try another dessert with shot of bourbon next time. 

I would highly recommend this place to anybody visiting Las Vegas. Every food was plated really nicely, service was great and they have fun and unique atmosphere. It became one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Thank you for making my day with awesome food! I will definitely go back soon with my friends :)",JM4Juj_yRz2YU7WHiF-iPw,0,0,5,J0jbyfBhTFkSULe-0AIr_g
131105,2014-10-05,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"Health hazard! Decor and extremely high price suggests high quality, handmade food.  It's not.

Taste is awful. That's actually not my main complaint. Taste is suggestive after all.  Trying to be Din Tai Fung I think.

Portions are miniscule.  $25 for three tiny shrimp.  Appetizers are bigger than this place's entrees.

However, my main problem is the fact that they serve raw meat.  And it's not steak tartare.  It was a won ton noodle soup.  Won tons are supposed to be pork and shrimp.  No shrimp.  That would cost them too much.  This was corn starch, gravy, and some meat I think was pork.  Yes, it was awful.  Not the main problem.  Owner insulted me and we got into an argument about it.  He said I didn't understand what fusion food is.  Fine.  We'll agree to disagree.  It doesn't change the fact that the pork was RAW!  You can't serve raw pork!  You can pass intestinal worms that way.

Our poor waiter was so embarrassed.  He even said that he doubted he would see us again but if he did, he hoped they would have improved.  The health department will probably shut them down first.",BN0A--UWIGBvSGKdY0Q64Q,3,1,1,IDdcTaGWDIWgmpPOAURk6Q
135937,2015-09-06,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"This might be my one and only 5 star review for a westernized Chinese restaurant.  I had lunch last Thursday with my sister.  She's one of those lucky butts that gets free things from hotels like free rooms and food credit, she's not a high roller so I'm quite perplexed by this.  I'm just lucky to tag along whenever I can.  She had a $60 food credit for any sls restaurant,  we thought about bazaar meat, but couldn't wait for the 5:30 pm start time so I suggested ku noodle instead of umami burger, which you can get all over LA.  Best decision for lunch I've ever made while in Vegas and my sister agreed!  The food was flavorful, our server Kate was very helpful and friendly.  

Food:
Watermelon Radish Salad 5/5
-Nice mellow flavors to ease us into a delicious meal with it's sesame dressing, is there anything sesame oil does not taste good on?

Mushroom Salad 5/5
-This is made with the wood ear mushroom and growing up, we wouldn't eat it like this in a salad so it was an interesting and delicious with it's spicy marinade.

Five Spice Duck 5/5
-This reminds me of my Dad's duck he occasionally makes, but in taco form, also similar to a beef roll, but made with duck!  Can't believe I almost forgot this in the review.  I know I'm using delicious a lot in this review, but that's what keeps repeating in my head when I think of the food I had here, delicious, delicious, delicious.

Ku Monk Noodle Soup 5/5
-Possibly the best vegetarian dish I've ever had!  This soup was so flavorful that you really forget that it's just a vegetable broth base and the only protein is a perfectly poached egg.  I can't stop thinking about that soup!  The handmade noodles had a nice chew to it, you know, al dente.  Definitely get this even if you aren't vegetarian.  I'm coming back to get this whenever I can!

Hakka Fried Rice Pot 5/5
-Mmmmmmm..... clay pot cooked fried rice with pork belly, lap cheong, eggs, wood ear mushrooms....... The pork belly tastes like the delicious pork belly my family makes on special occasions.  When I ate this I felt like a fool, because I never thought to add pork belly to fried rice, but I can't get to mad at myself, we rarely have leftover pork belly to make it into anything else.  I read someone else say that this is like the Korean Dolsot.......  All of Asia uses the clay pots!  Even though we don't cook rice like this in our house right now, my parents reminisce about the crispy rice layer from the old days.  It's rustic, it's delicious, it's all of Asia cooking their rice in clay pots before there were automatic rice cookers.  

Cereal Bowl 5/5
-Taiwanese shaved ice!!!!!!!!!  The most refreshing bowl of cereal I've ever had.  Condensed milk with berries and caramelized crispy rice on thinly shaved ice milk.  I'd definitely get this again.       

Green Tea Margarita 3/5
-My drinking days are over with liquor.  Sadly this is the only thing I won't get again simply because I'm not much of a liquor drinker.  We got this with the coupon from the hotel.  


Service: 5/5
Kate was great!!!  She had wonderful suggestions, always made sure we were enjoying our meal, and that our water glasses were full.  There was definitely some great team work going on behind the scenes, making sure we got our food in a timely manner.  She actually suggested the cereal bowl and Hakka Fried Rice, glad we were seated in her section, super friendly service!

So to sum everything up, I'll be coming back to get just about the same thing except for the cocktail.  It was a delicious combination!!!  I don't want to ruin it.  I can get siu mai all over the SGV, so I'll pass for now on that.  Thank you Mr. Andres for another delicious meal!!!!!!!!  I hope the quality is the same when I come back, it will probably be a while until I make the drive up there again.",lIjQ277KWvL1YhO64bSkzA,2,1,5,N3TqCdlgAI7sW50nDBDi7Q

Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Offered suggestions on menu items. One of which was Ants climbing a tree. It was a very tasty dish with the ground chicken accompanied with mung bean vermicelli. The bok choy was a nice addition and very fresh tasting. I Added peanuts to my dish which I really enjoyed. The dish was slightly oily leaving a thick layer in my serving dish.  Other than that I would still order it again asking them to use less oil.

I went there and most of the food was gross but some things that was a meat-oriented dish tasted better. Overall this restaurant was okay.

This place makes their own noodles and it shows. I ordered the ""Dan Dan"" this dish was perfectly spicy and delicious in every bite. To wash it down I had the lemongrass iced tea. This drink was a bit sweet for my taste but still really good and I definitely finished it.  I heard great things about the shaved ice so naturally I had to order one. I had the Zhulong Shaved ice - seriously so amazing. This was not overly sweet and I could taste each component as they married perfectly. I ordered a small and it was still way too much for one person to finish especially after a bowl of noodles. Lastly, the service here was flawless from each staff member that assisted me.

The service here was ok. The waitress constantly checked on us and it was good enough for me to leave her a tip.

The food here was terrible. I had their Lucky 12 siu mai (an order of 4 different siu mai 3 each. One of them was at par it was edible. The others my god what were you thinking when you made these. Is this something you would eat for lunch and dinner? For my self after one bite I couldn't eat it any more.

I also had an order of their crispy ocean noodle. Nothing special the sauce they added on to it just made it feel like its suppose to be like chow mein? but its crunchy? not memorable or appetizing at all.


When the server asked me how the food was I let her know she told me that she would bring the manager over I told her not to but to just bring me the check. 

She was nice enough to bring us dessert. 

She brought us Thai shaved ice which was decent. My note to this was if you're going to us fruits please use fresh ones or at least try your own fruits before you serve it. They had blue berries and strawberries in the shaved ice and both were bitter.

564867,2014-10-10,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"We just moved to Las Vegas and wanted to check out the new SLS.  We decided to have lunch at Ku Noodle because of the bright, clean dining room and delicious-looking menu.  The service was amazing and the waitress did a good job of explaining the dishes to us.  We decided on the Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai (Very good!) and the Crispy Ocean Noodle dish.  The waitress said the noodle dish was a very large dish, enough for two people.  She must have been talking about the size of the plate rather than the portion, because it was far from a 2-person plate of food.  It was delicious, but there were only three shrimp and they had the heads on.  Some people may like this, but we were grossed out by it.  The waitress was very apologetic about it and said that she should have mentioned that the shrimp came with the heads on.  However, it really should be mentioned on the menu.  Another thing not mentioned on the menu is that there are no free refills on tea.  I had a small glass of iced tea for $4 and since the menu didn't state ""no refills"", I asked for seconds assuming it would be free of charge.  I was not told that there would be another $4 charge for the additional tea, so I was very surprised to see the additional charge on our bill.

The food is good, but way overpriced.  The dining room has a casual vibe and the service is amazing, but with food prices this high, I expect a little more, like maybe not having servers in jeans and t-shirts.  This place really isn't worth the price and we won't go back.  For great noodles at a great price, we prefer Noodle Asia at The Venetian.",noBpu-5Z9m0k1Z1V5Sg_bg,0,0,2,4Wdak1b4psgbd8cNg5RDxQ

605235,2014-08-24,12,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"Ok, where to begin. First we were told by the hostess that there was not any way they could seat us because they somehow had the place booked out for reservations. Can't see how that could have been possible when there were only 2 or 3 tables with people seated. We had a party of 7 of us, and had to ask to speak to the manager since we were not sure how they could turn people away with so many empty tables. We were really excited to try this place out since we frequent so many noodle places in and outside of LV. Somehow the hostess came back and said they could seat us after all.

Wish we would have realized then that we would have been better off going anywhere else to eat but here. Once seated we ordered drinks and they came out looking good but tasted meh. Then ordered the Lucky 12 Shui Mai platter. That came with only a vinegar sauce. We had to ask for the chili sauce and soy sauce which the soy sauce never came and the chili sauce was more of a BBQ chili. The dumplings came out barely warm. The flavor of all the types that were included in the dim sum combo were all dry, terrible and not at all like any dim sum I have ever had before, and I have had a lot of dim sum all over in Asia. We also ordered the hot pot which was completely flavorless along with the won ton soup, I agree with the other yelper Lisa N. We ordered the La Mein which the noodles were way overcooked and had a bitter flavor to them. Just terrible. Then came the Watermelon salad with Cilantro and mint. This was so sugary it should have been more of a dessert item than salad. Not too many Asians I know like sweetness to this level in their food. 

We told the server everything was awful and I asked him if he thought the food was good and he looked at us nervously and said that he felt the food was terrible as well.

Wait it gets better and worse from here....we asked to talk to the manager and he completely defended the food as if we were crazy to think it was bad which we soon realized why. Jose Andres the owner was sitting at a table not far from ours. 

Me being the ballsy kinda girl I am approached Jose Andres directly about the food. I let him know that the food was not good in fact terrible and many changes would need to happen if he wanted to get returning customers. He told me he thought it was wonderful and that I have bad taste. I told him what was going wrong with just the dim sum and he said he would pay for our meal. I said I was not trying to get a free meal just trying to offer him some ""REAL"" feedback on how the food he was offering was from a customer's perspective. He told me not to come back and I said ""No problem."" Good luck to him. Even if he begged me to come try the food again free or even payed me I would not trust ""HIS' palette on anything Asian.",-Eye5PO9b7Nh-xr8dYvY9w,20,6,1,5QItGjpealSUr7Do3kopHw

Yes, it is a bit pricey considering that Chinatown is not but 5 miles away, but you are paying for the handmade fresh noodles, the sleek atmosphere, and Jose Andres concept of an Asian noodle kitchen  NOT for the authenticity of Chinese entrees.   I ordered the wonton noodle soup and noticed that the wontons were very flavorful on their own, but the soup was made even better with their homemade hot sauce....it added heat and another dimension of flavor.   But if you want an extremely unique desert, go for the Taiwan shaved ice .  I had the chocolate flavored ice with toasted coconut, crunchy chocolate beads, tapioca pearls, and caramel sauce.....OMG-it was the best and yummiest thing ever!!!!

I walked by at 11:30 and was thinking if I don't try it now I don't know when I'll be able to so might as well.  The menu is pretty limited, not like Noodles or Red8.  I asked the waiter what he recommended between a couple of noodles and he said la mein lo mein.  When it came out, I had two bites and all I tasted was immense salt, soy sauce and what seemed to be msg.  I told the waiter this was way too salty to eat and he was nice enough to take it off my bill.  I didn't want to be adventurous again and decided to order the wonton noodle soup thinking this can't be screwed up.  Guess what?  It was.  The wontons were so salty and had a terrible taste to it.  The noodles texture weren't great, it was softer than normal and again the bowl of noodles just felt like it had a lot of msg and salt in there.  The waiter asked how it was and I again gave the thumbs down.  They then sent the manager over who was kind enough to explain to me this is Jose Andres spin on Chinese food and it's not traditional Chinese cuisine.

It is usually either doused in extra soy sauce or covered in some type of sauce where one can hardly taste what they are eating. 

I've always been a huge fan of Jose Andres creations and thought to try this place out. I am very thankful that I did. 

Lo Mein- 3.5/5: This dish was very flavorful but almost had too much sauce. I love the assorted vegetables and the pan fried flavor. This brought back memories of good Chinese noodles, but nothing out of the ordinary. Just expect it to be saucy. 

Shrimp/Pork Wonton Soup- 4/5: Although this dish was on a lighter side, I was impressed with the soup broth. It is light and NOT SALTY! Thank you for not overly salting the soup broth. The noodle were overcooked and soggy, but the wonton pieces were quite delicious. The wonton skin was actually quite thin and I am quite surprised as you will never find that in most restaurants. Soup broth on point. 

Vegetable Noodle Soup ""Ku Monk""-5/5: Can we just keep talking about this soup noodle? This vegetarian noodle soup was phenomenal. The spice level on this was off the charts. It was so delicious. The chips on the side were also very interesting. I loved that this dish had an extra twist to it and that is what I was expecting from Jose Andres!

We tried out the Ku Noodle at SLS Resort in Las Vegas in April 2015.  We originally wanted to try out Bazaar Meats but didn't have a reservation, but were intrigued to see the Ku Noodles making noodles by hand.  We asked to be seated where we could watch the noodles being made.

Ambiance:  It's a small restaurant, simply decorated but clean and interesting.

Servers:  The servers were exceptionally attentive and knew the menu well.  Our server suggested several items, all of which we ordered, and each one of them was very good.  The servers are dressed casual in jeans and plaid button front tops.  They were all smiles and looked like they enjoyed their jobs.

Food:  We ordered Crispy Bao Bun ($9) which included two servings, and we fought for both of them, they were sooo good.  And Ku Sticky Wings ($12), also very good.  My husband ordered Lo Mein ($14) and I ordered Hakka Fried Rice Pot ($26).  The Rice Pot is poured together table-side and sizzles as it cooks right in front of you.  Both entrees were delicious.

Ambience: the restaurant is fairly informal. When you walk in, you go through the bar area which has a fairly large bar and some regular tables. In the back is the main dining room with booths along the wall and high top tables in the center. Again, fairly informal with no tablecloths, and fairly Spartan decorations.
Food: We started with the Superior Wonton soup. It had a ton of bok choy and egg noodles with a few shrimp and pork wonton thrown in. The portion is huge, more than enough as a starter for 4 people. Good but not great. Next we have the pork and shrimp siu mai. This consisted of 6 fairly small dumplings that were not very flavorful. I have had much better in local restaurants. We followed this with an order of lo mein. This dish was fabulous. They had hand pulled noodles with ham, mushroom, cabbage, and scallion. Fairly large portion. Every bite delicious. Our final dish was the shrimp pad thai. A very large portion pad thai noodles in a spicy peanut sauce with a generous helping of shrimp and a garnish of a single giant prawn. Fabulous!! But we saved the best for last. What is a birthday celebration dinner without a decadent dessert? We had a portion of shaved ice for dessert. The presentation was outstanding (see the picture). And the taste was even better than it looked! I will come back here just to get that dessert again.
Service: our server, Bailey, was at our table almost immediately to get our drink water. Because we were first timers, she helped us make some of our food selections. The food was brought out  at a very nice pace . Daily check back with us  at regular intervals to make sure that everything was going well. Overall the service was excellent.

SIU MAI: menu has four varieties, tried the scallop and pork and the lamb. Lamb was the favorite at the table, scallop version was overpowered by pork taste with a slight seafood aftertaste. Juicy, cooked well, wouldn't pay $10/6 pieces though.

NOODLES: The Lo Mein, Dan Dan Mian, and Beijing tomato dishes were all tried at our table and each had their own advantages. Lo Mein was my personal favorite due to the chewy texture and tasty sauce, while the Dan Dan could have used more spice to perk it up. The Beijing tomato dish was fairly unique- felt it could have used a more pronounced black garlic flavor by using oil rather than the actual garlic, which was only present in a few bites and used more as a garnish than a flavor-enhancing ingredient.

RICE: Hakka Fried Rice pot was delicious, available in two sizes and made table-side. Tasty combination of flavors and textures made this the standout entree of the table.  Would come here to get this again.

DESSERT: table customized two bowls (one small, one large) of the shaved ice. You select one ice flavor, one syrup, and three toppings including some more unique options like bacon and maldon salt (which I certainly wouldn't pair together). The combinations we put together resulted in an enjoyable confusion for our tastebuds as raspberry ice and honey interacted with perfectly-ripe blueberries in one and the crispy-rice texture dominated in the other dish. Ice texture was perfect but melted very quickly, so do not lollygag around after it arrives.

Overall impression was that the food was decent enough- noodles were tasty, other ingredients were of good quality, but the word 'fusion' is tossed around in many of these reviews and the food simply seems to be an Americanized take on many of the dishes, but that's not necessarily a negative. What IS a negative is the lackadaisical service- our server was polite enough when she was actually around.

Service at Ku Noodle was awesome and very accommodating. I also love the casual attire for the staff but still hotel restaurant quality service and decor so it's like you know you're eating somewhere really good, but can still feel casual and comfortable during your dining experience there. 

We started with the snow pea leaf salad that has orange slices and jasmine lily bulbs that are edible!! Talk about a perfect light crisp citrus blend salad with a fusion twist. Very light and refreshing and was the perfect way for me to start my meal here. 

Then we were served pork and shrimp siu mai and their crispy Bao buns (slider size) and tbh the siu mais were okay... And to me they were a little too small. But taste wise it was nothing mind blowing and I've had better. But oh man the Bao buns I really really enjoyed and I will definitely be back for more!! It was like a banh mi in a slider bun form!! 

The two larger entrees we were treated with were two noodle dishes, the Beijing Tomato noodle which is like a tomato basil with egg. Fusion mix, like basil tomato meets Chinese chow fun but with  light tomato sauce instead of dry soy sauce. The other noodle dish was Dan Dan Mian Noodles which was a spicy pork hoisen sauce consistency with carrots peanuts and sliced cucumbers. I enjoyed this as well but the spicy pork sauce was a little strong tasting for me. Like not salty but very sweet soy very similar to how hoisen sauce taste. But still enjoyable. I preferred the Beijing Noodles but honestly I will be back to try both again!! 

The icing (haha) on the cake was the Taiwanese Mango shaved ice with coconut shavings, lychee, and mochi balls and talk about flavors melting in your mouth!! Huge serving enough to truly share with 4 people and not finish it. But the mango flavor shaved ice was 100% on point like I was eating fresh ripe mango!!! Best way to end the night! 

Very clean and modern white decor and I really loved the atmosphere of this place!! The 4/5 coz I was very satisfied and happy with the food and service and the drinks (btw their drinks are strong) but nothing was really palate mind blowing expect the dessert. But I'm definitely going to go back for another experience to see if I can't give them that additional 1star and bump it to 5stars!!!",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,6,5,4,xOnkvmhrIZR7YP8GDsAexQ

*incredible egg noodles in the won ton soup

now onto the food we did order.  
dan dan mien (Hand-Cut Noodle, Spicy Pork Sauce, Peanuts,
Cucumber, Carrot 16.88) - the flavors were fantastic!  i would order this again.

ku monk (Hand Cut Noodle Soup, Egg, Vegetable, Mushrooms,
Rice Cracker 16.88) - the broth was rich and flavorful, the veggies used were authentically asian.  delicious.

open sesame (Wheat Noodle, Sesame Cucumbers, Carrots,
Watermelon Radish, Peanuts, Soy Dressing 12.88) - one of my favorite chinese noodle dishes that i grew up eating in my mom's kitchen.  this one was a little light in the sesame department but i still did enjoy it.

all of the noodles in each of these dishes were slightly soft, slightly well done.  i would have preferred them a bit more on the al dente side.

as you can see, the prices are unreasonably high.  however, the food was quite tasty and, if the prices weren't so extremely outrageous, i would most certainly return.  so, if you're staying at the sls and just need a quick bite and don't care about value, i would highly recommend ku noodle.  for the rest of us, we'll just stick to chinatown for authentic food and prices.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,5,2,3,mj3lGt1OV9zkhGZaywtkRg

""Lucky 12"" - The dim sum sampler consists of a few of each dim sum items on the menu (shrimp & pork, scallop & pork, chicken, and lamb).  Each dumpling was less than bite size and was on par with the finest selection of frozen dim sum found at your local grocer.  Microwaved, that is.  2/5

Fried Wontons - solid, with a decent curry sauce too.  3.5/5

Beef noodle soup was middle of the road.  The bowl was more broth than filling and lacked that beef flavor.  I've had much better back in LA, but after working through some macabre dim sum, this was a welcome distraction.  2.5/5

Dan Dan noodles hit the spot.  Loaded with spicy minced pork, sliced cucumbers, radishes, and carrots, I'd have to say this was best item we split.  4/5

We chose Ku Noodles because we wanted dim sum. They didn't open until noon so we waited around until they opened. I was watching one of their chef handmade some dumplings which was amazing. I usually go to dim sum places where they buy prepackaged dim sum and steam them. The prepackaged dim sum can't beat freshly handmade dim sum. When we got seated the nice server introduced herself and gave us options and advice on the menu. 

We ordered the Lucky 12, Shrimp and Pork Siu Mai, and Golden Pork Mein. We first ordered the lucky 12 and tried all of their Siu Mai and found that the shrimp and pork was most delicious though we loved them all. These were the best Siu Mai I've ever eaten. The shrimp and pork siu mai has gold flakes on them which made it look more appealing. After trying the lucky 12 we decided to order another tray of the shrimp and pork. Yes! It was that good. After the lucky 12, the server brought out the Golden Pork Mein. The only thing that was appealing to me was the pork belly. I didn't really enjoy the Mein. It lack some flavor, the sauce under the noodle wasn't so good. The portion was pretty small too. 

There isn't too much of a decoration here. They have a bar, 2 TVs, and Chinese cholegraphy on the mirror. Somewhat oriental decors. 

I pretty much enjoyed the siu mai and still want more. Next time in vegas I would go back here for their dumplings.

Chinese long beans
Pork & Scallop Siu Mai
Crossing the Bridge Noodles

The Chinese long bean dish was extremely salty. This is one of my favorite vegetables and it was bordering inedible given how salty it was. I was too hungry and this was the first dish that came out. I did mention it was too salty to the staff and was offered a replacement plate. This was really nice of them, but I had more food coming so I didn't take the offer.

The siu mai's are decent. They are a bit more delicate both in the physical form (smaller, less firm probably due to the scallops) and the taste was light.

The crossing the bridge noodle was disappointing. The whole thing was bland (just no taste) but the broth was just very salty without any other taste. I wanted a soup noodle to warm up, but didn't end up drinking any of it.

2468750,2015-01-26,3,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"Hand drawn noodles are a special thing. Ku Noodle does them fresh and provides a window into their kitchen to watch the artistic process unfold in front of your eyes.

Rumor has is it the Ku Noodle may not be around for much longer (reported by Eater Vegas January 23rd, 2015). Fans of José Andrés, fresh noodles, and playful fusion, may want to make it down to Ku sooner rather than later just in case these rumors hold to be true.

Fresh, hand-pulled noodles aren't quite the whole story here, but they are the main characters. Ku Noodle is a gleaming white eatery accented with vibrant shots of red tones that combine to evoke more of a nice clean energy than a sterile operating room. The dishes are Asian at heart, with a nice playful fusion element. Don't take your Chinese mother-in-law her with a childhood friend from the old country though...that would be silly. They would probably tell you how inauthentic everything was, comment on the smaller portions and higher prices and not appreciate the modern, dare I say, hip ambiance. How foolish are you?!?...yep, did that...but in my defense it was local's night, so we were only paying 50%. The fusion is kept to a minimum and the essence of each dish certainly shines through, but in the end is is delightfully not authentic.

Any meal here really should start off with one of their incredible cocktails:
Status Ku is crowd pleasing choice with Le Melon Vodka, Lychee Liqueur, Melon Liqueur, and Lime Juice. Still on the refreshing end of the spectrum is Ku's Nakamura, made of Cucumber Vodka, Sake, Lime Juice, and Cucumber Water. My personal favorite is the Five-Spice Old-Fashioned. It is a sweet but incredibly well-balanced take on an Old-Fashioned oddly enough and composed of Rye Whiskey, Five-Spice Syrup, and Angostura Bitters. Fans of Whiskey can also try the Ma Collins with Japanese Whiskey, Star Anise & Ginger Syrup, and Yuzu. Not as sweet as the Five-Spice Old-Fashioned, yet still balanced, in the Ma Collins sweetness gives way to citrus and aromatics.

Dim Sum serves as nice appetizer selections (provided that your mother-in-law is okay with eating dim sum in the evening when Ku is open). My favorite item here was the Pork & Scallop Siu Mai, with lots of love for the Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai and Crispy Bao Bun as well.

For noodles the La Mein Lo Mein and Dan Dan Mian are both popular options, but I prefer the subtleties of light fresh tomato contrasted with the richness of black garlic found in the Beijing Tomato. I also want to make it back to try their Japanese-Style Soba Noodles. Dessert allows you to customize Taiwanese Shaved Ice flavors, toppings and sauces for an individualized experience. The Shave Ice here held its light, fluffy texture far better than most versions I've had.

There are other items on the menu I'd like to explore. Hopefully Ku Noodle will be around to provide the opportunity to do so here in Vegas.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,8,4,4,hI7tSO26wxxW_Togv8j84Q

Tracy was so awesome because she made us a lemon drop martini and custom lychee martini!! If you want some awesome drinks ask for Tracy!

I have been wanting and craving Bao ever since I heard it mentioned in the *cough* prematurely canceled *cough* tv show Firefly when Saffron makes Bao for Captain Malcolm Reynolds.  It's a very modern and almost futuristic restaurant that ironically actually looks like it could be in an episode of Firefly as a restaurant. The prices are cheap for the strip and I was actually surprised that I didn't pay that much. The Bao, drinks, and tea cost me all together 17 dollars which is pretty cheap consider I may spend 50 bucks for that at a place like Tao. The servings were actually pretty large considering that the Beef Bao is actually only an appetizer. It's about the size of a large sandwich and it's very and I mean very filling. The beef was tender and the Bao was extremely flavorful and the Bao itself was a 10 dollar item so really not that pricey.  The tea was delicious and I mean it was to die for. The tea needed no sugar or honey because it was so fresh and flavorful on it's own. It tasted like it was just picked 5 minutes ago. I love this restaurant and while it's more expensive than other Asian restaurants it's a decent enough price that I would come back for the Bao alone and maybe to try another dish like the duck or the noodle dishes. It's a great restaurant and the service was phenomenal. I went around 1pm and it actually was really quiet, there were only two groups in the restaurant; a couple and two ladies that had just arrived and were getting ready to check in. It was a very nice restaurant and whenever Serenity lands at the SLS again i'll eat here again.",S9dDf0JqSMAvusp5f-9bGw,0,0,4,4HNWulSDsfYhOO_zBnRKbg

I would highly recommend stoping in. The only minor criticism that I have is that they close a little early. We tried to stop in last night and they had just closed.

2832967,2014-11-25,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"One of the big (ok, probably the only) reasons to stay at the SLS in Vegas is that it's really cheap right now. While the hotel itself is cheap, the same can't be said for the food options and this restaurant is one of the worst offenders.

I wanted to try all the various shao mai they offered, since I'm a big fan of fusion food done right. If you order their ""Lucky 12"", you get 12 shao mai, for the incredibly stupid price of $20.88. With the exception of the 3 lamb shao mai, they all were completely bland and uninteresting. You can head to Din Tai Fung and get an order of 10 for $7-$8, and the worst thing I've ever heard anyone say about them is that they aren't as good as the XLB. We were off to a bad start.

Next up for me was the ""Crispy Pork Bao Bun"". This started off good. I waited a little bit for the bun to cool off, and bit in. Great texture on the bun. This immediate burst of flavor hit, and then I had the weirdest culinary experience of my life. I didn't even chew, didn't even swallow, and all of the taste just disappeared. From a chemistry standpoint, I don't even understand how it's possible for flavor molecules to just dissipate or disperse that quickly. This went from me thinking that this was a dish I could return just to eat, to me wondering if I had brain tumor or a stroke or something. I tried the next bite, and the next, and the next. It was like all the taste was there, hiding in the background, too shy to introduce itself anymore. That was $9.88. (everything on the menu ends in 88 cents, because Chinese.)

My friend ordered the ""Superior Wonton Soup"" which features ""Superior Broth"" as its primary component. First off, Soundwave is superior, and all others are inferior. More importantly, this is some of the blandest soup I've ever tasted in my life. If I roll over to A&J or literally any other Chinese place, the thin chicken broth that they give you to pour over your rice has 100 times more flavor than this did. My friend commented that the only way to get any taste besides ""water"" out of the soup, he had to eat every spoonful with one of the wontons. This cost $15.88.

Even in terms of Vegas pricing, this is one of the least flavorful, least satisfying, and least cost-effective meals I've ever eaten. I wouldn't have cared about the prices if this stuff actually just tasted good, but it was all just bland, bland, bland. Maybe part of it is due to the general funky smell that the SLS has right now, but since I couldn't just turn off the SLS odor, I have no way of knowing.

I don't intend to come back to find out.

Service was ok, and my friend really liked his Sake Punch, which is why this gets more than one star. This place is only open for dinner, which was a source of consternation.

However, the GM Ceilidh was not as warm. Lina was serving me and the GM interrupted her to help her with a transaction.  Rather than lead by example, greet me and apologize for the interruption, she was cold and didn't even make eye contact with me. The SLS and SBE are world renowned and emphasize stellar service.  A simple hello and how's your meal would have sufficed. 

The food was delicious.  Lina recommended a delicious beer and a very comforting vegetable and noodle soup.

We sure did. The prices here are outrageous, a common theme in the reviews.
They could have saved a ton of money on the plates and bowls by purchasing smaller versions to match the small portions. I'm not quite sure what exactly the idea is from a marketing standpoint when restaurants use great big dishes for tiny portions. I can't eat the bowl. Add more stuff. It's not morels or truffles...it's f'n noodles! In the grand scheme of things in a restaurant they're free compared to things like meat, vegetables, seasonings, flavor. Did I mention the flavor? I had ants crawling on a stick, not literally, that was the name of the dish. No stick, no ants, no crawling unless you include me crawling to the toilet later in the day... This stuff was spicy but lacked flavor, extremely salty, left a taste in my mouth like a shoe and induced acid reflux which lasted at least three hours. I love Chinese food. I'm not even sure the guys in the kitchen were Chinese. They looked like they had been working at Burger King the week before.
My wife had the 'Superior Wonton Soup'...NOT! She kept on saying, these are box noodles, these are box noodles...except they don't taste as good. 

Then the bill came. Toxic shock, soft drink, iced tea and the two dishes, $50. Like I said, ""Screwed again!"" 

Funny thing about the way Yelp is treating these reviews. Many of you have provided extremely detailed negative and I might add based on my personal experience, wholly justified comments. Yet Yelp has chosen to summarize only positive reviews at the top of the page of reviews.

Unlike most Asian restaurants, the food is all very fresh and plated beautifully. It's a little bit pricier, but it's definitely worth it. Ku is one of the few remaining restaurants in vegas (or in any city for that matter) that make their own noodles! If you've never had fresh noodles before, trust me, the difference in quality is unbelievable. 
When people think of Asian food, they mostly only worry about price, not quality, and it's such a shame. It's so worth it to have freshly made Sui Mai and fresh noodles rather than frozen dim sum and food filled with MSG. 

The Taiwanese shaved ice is without a doubt the best in town. It's made in house, from scratch, so the quality at other shaved ice restaurants such as kuma show and snowflake just aren't comparable.

Their noodles are handmade, the dough kneaded and and threaded individually into noodles, tasting very similar to udon noodles, just not as visually symmetrical. In my opinion, the food encompasses a traditional Taiwanese style of cooking. The food is lightly seasoned, the meat is tender and well cooked, and the vegetables fresh. The presentation of the food is simple, consistent with the cooking style. The restaurant set up is modern with Chinese writings on the mirrors that makes it look too busy and a little tacky. Word of caution, if you're not accustomed to more authentic Chinese food and are looking for more Americanized Chinese dishes, something safe, then this would not be the place to go, it's more of an acquired taste.",BFS6u-Utr4BhsLrm7WN_Gg,1,0,4,_V6Fg7tfvCMzZImhw8-zRg

3971573,2015-01-13,5,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"I've wanted to try Ku Noodle since the SLS opened.  I saw Ku was the restaurant for the Sunday 50% off for Nevada residents so I made a reservation and went along with the recommendation of a good friend.

Shortly after being seated, while I was looking at the menu once again, two friends from Yelp--some of the first people I met when I first started Yelping--were leaving and stopped by to say hello.  They then pointed oiut the two best dishes in their opinion.  Who was I to disagree with that?

I started with a Thai iced tea and some water and then ordered two items--shrimp and pork siu mai and Hakka fried rice pot.  The shrimp and porl siu mai have a nice blend of jicama, mushroom, peanut, shrimp, and pork.  The dumplings were topped with some gold leaf.  At the same time the dumplings were brought, a server came with the rice hot pot which is finished at the table.  The rice is in an extremely hot pot and the server adds chile sauce for spiciness (if you want), mushrooms, and soy broth.  The server mixes the rice, vegetables, pork belly, and sausage with the items he put in.  The pot is left with two spoons for getting this richness out.  

From then it was having one siu mai, some fried rice, one siu mai...repeat.  Both dishes were very good.  The Hakka fried rice comes in two sizes, regular and a 1/2 size for someone dining alone like myself. 

My server asked me about dessert and I had been prompted by all to enjoy the shaved ice but I wasn't sure I could finish the large bowl it comes in.  My server told me they now have a smaller portion of the shaved ice.  Bingo.  Dessert for me.  I got a small order of the shaved ice and I chose the malted milk topping, crispy chocolate pearls, Maldon salt, and bacon for the three additional toppings and I got chocolate sauce drizzled on top.  This shaved ice is like nothing I've had before.  It's almost like ice cream it's so rich.  The toppings were all good and the smaller size was perfect.

Service was excellent.  The servers were attentive and helpful with suggestions and I appreciated their help with letting me know about the smaller portions.  With 50% off the total, the meal was a bargain when compared to normal prices.

Now I can go back sometime and try the noodles.  They sound so good.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,7,4,lTPMRfACl1TfGUrzro62xQ

Lamb Dim Sum & Scallop/Pork Dim Sum - Both freshly steamed with flavorful filling 
Beijing tomato Noodle - Noodles are hand pulled! I can't explain it but the combination of the tomato, egg and light sauce bring the dish together. Add some spice for a kick.

4107173,2015-02-02,0,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"I was excited to try Ku Noodle tonight with friends. Not only have I not had the opportunity to dine at a Jose Andres restaurant before, but I was especially excited for the vaunted dessert.

Of course, we had to have a meal before that part. We started by sharing the scallop & pork siu mai and huhhot (lamb) siu mai (each $9.88 for 6 pieces). The scallop & pork stood out less than the lamb and cumin morsel. Both were savory and juicy, with a delicious wrapper. They're about average size for siu mai, but I thought that they vanished pretty quickly without leaving a lasting impression.

SInce I was in a good mood after the defeat of the losing Super Bowl team, I also had a Five-Spice Old-Fashioned cocktail ($10.00). I know little about cocktails, but this one had the full alcoholic punch while not tasting too strongly of alcohol. The giant ice cube kept the drink cold while not melting too quickly. The fruit garnish was pleasant and not alcohol-soaked. I wouldn't mind having it again.

My entree was the Hakka Fried Rice Pot ($16.88). Our server told us that this would be enough for two people to share, whereas the larger size was more suited for four, and I was pretty happy with the portion size. They have a special presentation of sorts, where a senior wait staff member opens the pot table-side, pours in a soy broth, adds an egg and chili oil to your level of heat preference, and mixes the contents of the pot for you. The same person did this at all tables that ordered the rice pot.

I think the rice pot was quite delicious. Parts of the rice had crunch from being cooked in contact with the pot. The soy broth instilled umami and a balanced salt flavor. Pork belly was tender and tasty, lap cheong (sweet Chinese sausage) was delicious as expected. Mushroom was nicely cooked and more enjoyable than the wood ear fungus for me, the latter of which was sadly not cut into small pieces.

I also sampled the other entrees, which I was glad for due to the presence of noodles in all of them. The Lo Mein ($14.88), Dan Dan Mian ($14.88), and Beijing Tomato ($12.88) all had tasty fresh pulled noodles. The dishes all seemed balanced enough, and the Dan Dan Mian is mild-medium in spiciness at best. No complaints about any of them.

We finally arrived at the much anticipated dessert. For those who don't know, this is a Taiwanese treat called xue hua bing, which is also available in town at Snowflake Shavery. I ordered a raspberry shaved snow (the ""shaved ice"" name sounds so Hawaiian) with crunchy chocolate pearls, Maldon salt, blueberries, and honey ($8.88). We also had a smaller sized malted milk snow with caramelized rice, tapioca pearls, and diced mango ($5.88). After comparison, the larger size seems to be a better value and a better way to enjoy this treat.

The shaved snow was quite similar in texture to the one at Snowflake, aka merely the second-best texture I've had. The flavors were pretty outstanding, however. The honey played with the snow in a very interesting way that somewhat overwhelmed the raspberry flavor, so I couldn't actually taste the raspberry too much. I didn't detect the salt either, but the variety of chocolate spheres and the blueberries were both standout toppings. I also tasted the smaller snow dish and was struck by the unexpectedly hard crunch of the rice. I liked it a lot, and I'd certainly order it next time (unless the rumored demise of the SLS becomes a reality). Overall, it's an assertively flavored and not overly sweet dessert that seems to celebrates the multitude of toppings at least as much as the snow - a possible negative if you're a snow purist.

Now, take 50% off all of the above prices. The four-star rating is predicated entirely on taking advantage of the Social Sundays pricing for locals, or else I would consider it average and/or overpriced. The dishes all felt like they were designed by somebody not Chinese doing Chinese food, albeit with plenty of care and quality ingredients. The service was spotty at times. We were seated at a table with only two place settings and had to request it from our server when we put in our order. We also had to request water refills, and we had slightly extended periods without seeing our server.

Overall, I had an enjoyable experience with the locals-only special and enjoyed a good rendition of shaved snow. I would quickly direct others to other restaurants, Strip or off-Strip, that are more likely to impress.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,2,4,80_PfdKvmUaz5NlmE0hjgw

On a side note the SLS seems designed for young 20-30 something's that have a lot of money to spend. The traffics flow is confusing, navigating the SLS difficult. Anyway, the restaurant is bright and clean, we were quickly seated and brought water and beverages. The fried wontons were very light and had a nice peanut sauce. The crispy rice bowl prepared table side ($26) however being somewhat tasty was mediocre and not very filing, though the presentation was nice.

We both ordered the Superior Wonton soup but I got mine with Vermicelli noodles instead since I'm not a fan of egg noodles. It took 2 different wait staff (wasn't sure why the first one had to ask another) who then had to ask the chef if they could make the switch for me, but thankfully the chef said yes. The broth was a little bland, I could only taste salt, but after putting some chili flakes in the flavor was a little better. My sister was pretty disappointed with it too and she loves wonton soup. The wontons themselves had a lot of flavor, although I'm not sure I personally liked it, and there were only like 2 pieces of bok choy in the soup with was a little sad. 

The shaved ice was delicious though! Better than most I've had and we ordered a small strawberry one and it was HUGE!

Anyway for what it's worth, Ku Noodle was a very original restaurant that broke the mold of what you normally see in big Vegas casinos. I ordered the Ku Monk noodle bowl, the Shumai, and the ""bowl of cereal"" shaved ice dessert. The shumai was a small, but very tasty dim sum syle dumpling dish. I was very impressed with the freshness of the ingredients in the noodle bowl. And the dessert was like nothing I've ever had. The description of ""bowl of cereal"" was very accurate. It tasted like a frozen bowl of cap'n crunch.

The SLS Hotel and Casino was new for us and we were not only not disappointed, but were thoroughly impressed. SLS has easy valet off of Paradise and an even easier self-park garage. Ku Noodle is the first restaurant that you see when you enter the casino from reception. 

My husband and I ordered the ""Ants Climbing a Tree"" and the meal-sized ""Superior Won Ton"" soup. We split a small order of the Zhulong (the strawberry & mochi one) Taiwanese Shaved Ice for desert. The dinner, quite honestly blew us away. The ""Ants Climbing a Tree"" isn't pretty to look at, as it's a very dark brown plate of food. Don't let that deter you! It was very complex and layered in flavor profiles with a fantastic mouth feel. Trust me. You can't lose with this dish. The ""Superior Won Ton"" soup was aptly named! Bar none, the most savory and single best Won Ton soup that I have ever had. Stunning. 

If all of this wasn't enough, we went ahead and ordered the strawberry Zhulong Taiwanese Shaved Ice for dessert. Simply put, it changed our life. I can't wait to try every one on the menu! From reading the menu description and the fact that it's called ""Shaved ice,"" you think you can reasonably, accurately have an idea about what this dessert is. You don't. Stop thinking. Order it. Thank me later.

I've got two more Vegas trips booked in the next five months. I will be back at Ku Noodle. A LOT. I'm bringing friends.

Your restaurants generally delight the palate, overwhelm the senses, and to put it simply - put a big ole smile on my face.  Sadly, Ku Noodle is the exception.  

I've tried eating here twice and both times, have been let down.  I ordered all the ""popular items"" recommended by servers, and everything was under-salted, under-flavored, and far below mediocre.  Add your exorbitant pricing to tasteless food, and you've got a recipe for disaster (pun intended).  

The cocktails aren't too shabby - but they don't make up for the bland, boring noodle and rice dishes.  In fact, I have to make up a new adjective to describe this atrocity...cardboardy.   All the food was cardboardy.

Everything was tasty with the Pork/Shrimp and Scallop/Pork being my favorites. The gold foil on the Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai was a nice touch. They're decent dumplings, but certainly not the best ones I've had. I probably wouldn't order these again because the noodle dishes certainly stand out more.

Crispy Bao Bun ($9.88): Slow-cooked Pork Belly, pickled vegetables, peanuts, and cilantro. The bao was nice, but I didn't care for the filling. Nothing stood out about the ingredients.

Lo Mein ($14.88): Hand-pulled wheat noodles, ham, forest mushrooms, carrot, Napa cabbage, scallion, soy sauce, and cilantro. The noodles were fantastically chewy and it was an overall flavorful dish.

Dan Dan Mian ($14.88): Hand-cut noodles, spicy pork sauce, cucumber, carrot, watermelon radish, cilantro, and Chinkiang vinegar. I really enjoyed his dish. I loved the spicy pork sauce reminiscent of Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and all the vegetables.

Crispy Ocean Noodle ($24.88): Egg noodles, head-on prawns, snow peas, Shiitake mushroom, and Chinese gravy. This was my favorite dish of the bunch. I love crispy noodle dishes and this was delicious. Also, the prawns were wonderful.

Taiwanese Shaved Ice (Large; $8.88): Coconut snow, condensed milk, fresh strawberries, toasted coconut, and mochi. I highly recommend the shaved ice (or shaved snow). This is probably the best Taiwanese Shaved Ice I've had. Really light, airy, and equally creamy. Wonderful flavor and I loved the toppings! It was also nice to eat out of a large bowl, so the shaved ice was nicely contained.

Overall, I think the food is really nice. Though the prices are a bit high for dishes that I didn't absolutely love; which is why I find it difficult to return frequently. Especially with the increase of hand-pulled noodle places in town.

PS the water sucks here. I wouldn't recommend slurping that stuff down. The mister ordered a Pepsi and I got the Thai Iced Tea ($4), which was absolutely fine btw. 

BEIJING TOMATO ($12.88): Vegetarian options are severely limited here, but this entree did the trick. I think the dish was fine but could've used more flavor. Maybe more greens? More visual appeal? There's a little pot of chili sauce on the table and I loaded 3 spoonfuls to add some spice to the noodles. 3/5

HAKKA FRIED RICE POT ($26.88): This potted dish is mixed together at the table, and I was able to sample some before the pork belly and sausage were mixed in. I really liked the rice.

He stated the hefty $26 price tag would have been ridiculous for this entree if we paid full price. 3/5

SERVICE: Dismal. Got off to a slow start and we had to ask for refills all 3 times. He was fast to get the check though. Hmph. 2.5/5

VIBE: I expected it be more crowded on a Social Sunday. Even so, it was LOUD in here. Bad for conversation. It's a causal Asian diner with trendy features. The restaurant is all white with a few blotches of blacks and reds. It was freezing in here! I was so glad I brought a jacket. The metal chairs didn't help any either. 3/5

No stranger to Chef Jose Andres or the concepts born from thinkfoodgroup it was with great curiosity that I entered Ku Noodle on Saturday evening and with a menu largely selected by GM Ceilidh Lamont along with her team in kitchen I'm happy to say my expectations were exceeded.  Sparsely decorated but brightly lit, with white porcelain and leather beset by mirrors on both sides, it was just after 5pm that I found myself seated at a table near the back of the space and soon greeted by the first of several servers I couldn't help but be impressed, each smiling face possessing both knowledge and opinions on the cuisine plus a whimsical professionalism far too infrequently seen in Casino dining these days.  Beginning first with dark tea liberally sweetened by coconut milk alongside a light salad, vibrant with mint playing off the sweetness of peeled orange segments, it would not be long before the table was flooded with heavier hitting flavors and presented as a four-part feast the only question was where to start - an answer soon found in the appropriately named ""Lucky 12"" and its four triplets of innovative Siu Mai as each delicate wrapper was stuffed to bursting with poignant flavors set against accoutrements including tobiko, goji berry, and even gold leaf.  Not to be outdone by dim sum the next bites of Ku were of the signature noodles and although future visits will be required to sample other styles I have to say the texture of the thick wheatbelt variety speaks volumes, each tender bite teaming with spice in a broth rendered from lamb neck as pickled radish helped to temper the spice.  Having already heard good things about the bao and happy to confirm that the fist-sized umami-bomb on deep-fried bun is every bit as delicious as its ingredient profile would indicate it was finally in lowly congee that I indulged and although most will eschew such a pedestrian option in a place like this suffice it to say that this is not your mom n' pop rice porridge, the silky stock itself teaming with vibrant spices and all the better for bites imbued with egg, tender vegetables, peanuts, and a whole lot of funk-meets-sweet meat.  At this point quite sated but unable to resist dessert described as 'can't miss' by nearly everyone in the restaurant my final decision of the evening was which of the eight flavors of Taiwanese Shaved Ice to choose and eventually opting for Malted Milk with a trio of toppings plus one sauce I'll simply say that anyone who thinks Snowflake is 'amazing' needs to stop by The SLS ASAP, the $9 bowl more than enough for two to share with rich flavor amidst a stunning texture that you are actually encouraged to experience with chopsticks in order to focus on each snowy crystal...at least until you give into temptation and grab a spoon to fully indulge in a mouthful and never look back until scraping the bowl clean.

Undoubtedly facing an uphill battle in a city where cheap meats and ramen shops speckle Spring Mountain Road, Ku Noodle presents an upscale option for those willing to invest in quality ingredients, innovation, and presentation.  Perhaps my favorite thinkfoodgroup experience to date, outside of 'e,' every single plate at Ku Noodle proves Chef Andres dedication to both quality and creativity while the staff is every bit as well trained, efficient, and pleasant as that at Bazaar - something you surely aren't going to find on Spring Mountain where service is often an afterthought, at best.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,4,q7WNzSq8ua7SK5RnMYELaw
5312826,2014-08-23,3,CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw,"Slightly below average Chinese food for way above average price.  

The flavors of the various noodles we tried are okay, but they could really do a better job on both presentation and how they cook their core product - the noodles.  The noodles were definitely overcooked, which is a bit of a waste considering that these are hand pulled. 

Worst complaint is that you are paying an arm and a leg for Chinese food ($20+ on average), and the portions are absolutely tiny.  Any average guy will need 2 orders.  No really.  

They are still figuring their shit out here as of their grand opening, which is when I came.  Give them a few weeks; maybe it will get better.

We covered a lot of ground on Friday night, and we've only had one date, but you're awesome and you really get me.  We started strong with them buns, your delicious crispy bao buns packed full of porky goodness and pickled veggies with peanuts & cilantro.  How did you know I have a weakness for all things pickled?  And then go and smother it in some pork.  I was registering sensory overload off the charts and we just started.  

Just when I thought the night couldn't possibly get any better, you sent over 3 dishes served up family style: Shrimp/Pork Siu Mai, Dan Dan Mian hand-cut noodles,  and Beijing Tomato hand-cut noodles.  You know the way to this girl's heart is not with flowers, but food.  I love the Beijing Tomato hand-cut noodles  luxuriously topped with tomato, eggs, black garlic, & cilantro.  I'm not even sure how black garlic differs from regular garlic, but it sure does sound fancy.  

I think my eyes are glazing over at this point, as I sit and doodle Ku & Steph, followed by experimental doodles of Steph Noodle.  Sure, that sounds cute, right?  Oh wait, there's more???  Taiwanese Shaved Ice, holy mother of all that is sacred to put in your mouth!  This stuff is fricking amazeballs!!

I had a greet tea margarita ($14) and it was small and forgettable. My friend had dan dan Mein noodles while I had the shrimp crispy noodles. The service was great however nothing else was. My shrimp dish tasted ok... Definitely not worth $25 but after I got home I was immediately sick and have been for 5 hours now.

My friend ordered the Japanese Soba, which I liked (but it's a really simple dish to begin with). Along with a Banzai Bunny White Peach Sparkling Sake ($35 for 300ml )

There Chicken and Mushroom Dim Sum taste like Steam Dumpling and are really small in size, it was nothing special!

I love Taiwanese & Chinese cuisine and I love Jose Andres' restaurants...so to see him come up with an Asian/Chinese/Taiwanese fusion restaurant was absolutely refreshing.

The  Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai here are so delicious. We enjoyed watching them make them by hand, fresh, thru the Clear Glass Windows... most of the times we never know what goes into pork siu mais when you go to your traditional Hong Kong restaurant!

All the noodles/soups dishes were great, too. Super flavorful and I didn't feel thirsty afterwards.

Only mediocre part was probably the Shaved Snow/Ice -I expected this though. It was refreshing and light, but not nearly as good as the ones in southern California or abroad in Asia. Still, makes for a good dessert treat!

Good but be prepared for the more ""Fusion"" twist on all dishes! If you want something authentic, go to Noodle Asia in the Venetian!",ibvH1Y7Rh_tstiWgH0OFTA,0,0,4,-JrdGKdV3flMGJ3vGmANKQ

Ku noodle doesn't look like anything fancy but I thought the food and service were fantastic when I had dinner there. I was alone so I sat at the bar and met a really nice bartender named Tracy who gave me great pointers on what to order.

I have a weakness for any kind of Asian dumplings so I was going to start with the siu mai but instead opted for the watermelon salad. Wow, was that a good choice. It was so light and fresh but with a huge explosion of flavors. My extremely knowledgeable server said that the way to eat it was to get a little of each ingredient in each bite (watermelon, radish, and greens) and that really worked but the dressing is what made it really amazing. I followed the salad with the Dan Dan Mian. If you've had dan dan noodles at Pei Wei then these are similar but with a more complex and less sweet flavor. I really enjoyed that dish. To top it off I had a really delicious cocktail called the Nakamura. They have really great drinks at Ku but they are a bit pricey. Fortunately I was on the company dime.

I would have to agree with most of the reviews here with the service being slow but, they just opened. We'll let that one slide this one time. We ordered the dan dan mien (for you koreans, ja jang myun) and was pleasantly surprised how tasty it was. It does have a kick but it was perfect for us. Not too heavily seasoned, not too spicy. I just wished the noodles had a chewier texture. We added our own twist to it as we added a bowl of rice and mixed the remaining meat sauce. We added a little more spice to it and it was delish!

We then got the Siu Mai platter which pretty much was a mixture of all their different flavors. It was perfectly steamed, flavorful, and was delicious. The shaved ice was another winner! We ordered the coconut ice, graham crackers, pineapple, condensed milk, and the chocolate balls. Yum! They use the same bowls you get from your noodles so imagine all that ice! It was a perfect end!

Go in, don't expect quick service, no expectations, and enjoy the food. Ask for the extra bowl of rice when you order the dan dan mien, order the shaved ice at the end of your meal and you will go home, a happy camper.",jbn7XQV7CngRu0sA6cZN1Q,1,0,3,9UQxgv7VQdTfuWQlrXSfIg
