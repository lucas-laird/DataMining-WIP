342241,2016-10-15,1,YYzHvjD16a8Vn6AeaWBKJg,"My friends and I were so excited to have a sushi burrito spot in our neighborhood, and we really wanted to like this spot. I did give it two attempts, but sadly we will be going to Soho from now on. 

My first trip I ordered a shrimp burrito on seaweed paper. Right away the woman putting my burrito together pulled out soy paper (I have a soy allergy) and started assembling it. I got her attention and asked her to please make it on seaweed paper because I am allergic and her response was ""But you asked for soy."" Why would I ask for something I was allergic to?? I reiterated that I cannot have soy and needed seaweed. She became very agitated, aggressively threw the soy burrito in the trash, and started making it on seaweed. Then at the register we literally stood there for over 5 minutes while the woman working it had a conversation with her friend. It was not busy and they were discussing something personal. I nearly walked out. The food itself was passable at best... the burrito fell apart completely after one bite and the whole thing was extremely watery. 

Last night I ordered again through Postmates, and the yellowtail was DISGUSTING. It was definitely not fresh. It tasted like one would imagine a dirty fishbowl tastes like. One bite and I actually got physically ill. I ended up throwing the entire thing away.

751435,2016-09-12,2,YYzHvjD16a8Vn6AeaWBKJg,"I wanted to like this place, I really did.

Pros:
- It is conveniently located across 24-Hour Fitness in the Albertson's plaza on Maryland
- The staff was friendly and attentive
- The raw vegetables (my bowl had red onion, cilantro, and cucumbers) tasted fresh

Cons:
- The seafood in my bowl didn't taste fresh and had an unusual texture (probably a good idea to get some after-meal Pepto-Bismol if you decide to ignore my review and go here anyways)
- The bowl was drenched in sauce that was extremely salty
- The seaweed salad was really low quality, another issue with its texture and it being abnormally slimy even for seaweed salad. If you read the ingredients you find out it has a bunch of additives like corn syrup and hydrolyzed veggie protein
- The green tea mochi was good... initially, then I was surprised by the aftertaste of rubber glove (probably mishandled at some point by one of the servers)
- The tables are awkwardly low. I'm 5'3 and I had to hunch over to be in a comfortable position to eat my food
- The structure of the restaurant just doesn't make sense- the dining side is cramped while the section you're supposed to wait in line is way too wide, so wide that it's not functional and it was hard to figure out where the line actually started
- The ""vibe"" in the restaurant could use a lot of improvement- white walls, no decor, cheap interior materials and furniture all topped with ""ambient"" (trying way too hard) loud house music

I'm guessing this place has a high-star rating because of all the nightlife industry people that get comped by the owner (who's partner is an Omnia promoter)

Side note: I'm giggling at the first image posted here where there are people all texting at the table. (Say hello to the promoters that were comped and asked to write a five-star review for this less than mediocre place.) It's obviously staged.

Tip: Drive about a mile from this place to get the good stuff at Island Sushi's Poke Express.",rsYlXrd3IvPdzir6XOhkJA,4,2,2,bZPZBugBNhHsJHX91g-CdQ

My second visit was the only time that I had received good service and the staff was welcoming and helpful, but the other two time were the total opposite. On my most recent visit, the guy became extremely annoyed with me because I asked for shrimp tempura, but I guess ""at 8 o'clock they shut down the oven to be cleaned""... which doesn't make sense because they're open until 9. If this is the case, there should be a sign posted saying last call for baked food is 8pm or at least make the customer aware of the situation prior to ordering. (Sadly none of the employees wear name tags so I was not able to recognize the employee by name so that I could give a high five to the good ones and a thumbs down to the not so good ones... or management could). He then proceeded to touch everything like the phone, his hat, his hair, all of the countertops, his clothing, utensils, and then began handling my food. I had to ask him to change his gloves because I witnessed all he had touched and realized he was then going to attempt to make my food with the same gloves. The rest of the time he was very short and rude because ""he had just gotten in trouble by his manager for turning on the oven past 8"" although he kept saying ""oh it's no big deal. Don't worry about it. It's not your fault."" But clearly I could tell he was annoyed. You know how they say ""third time is a charm""?... well yeah this is probably the last time I will eat at this place. Unfortunate because it's right down the street from me but it's their fault that I am going to take my business elsewhere.

Everything is set up Subway/Chipotle style with all the fillings/toppings/condiments in front of you to choose...the only problem was that there were no labels. That would have been nice, since I had no idea what I was picking. 

ADVICE: If you don't know what you want or what pairs well together (like me), I would recommend asking your server for suggestions. That's what I ended up doing and my tacos were bomb.

Usually you need to go down to the strip in order to get a good tuna poke or at least a higher end restaurant. The problem with this is the time it takes to get ready go down and then sit wait for the food. Well NOT anymore! 

Tail and Fin combines the best of both worlds high quality product, and I mean high quality the fish was literally as good as Nobu, and the convenience of a quick service restaurant. 

I walked into the Restaurant and was greeted politely by the entire staff. It was clean well organized with the tables on one side and a lineup for people to order on the other. It's similar to a chipotle where you get to choose what kind of protein and toppings you want on your burrito or burrito bowl or salad. The choices to put on we're very diverse and let me have many options for my most favorite poke variation cravings from the classics like avocado to a little more unique like pomegranate arils. Next up the sauces, the classic poke sauce is delicious but let me tell you what, YUZU MISO SAUCE is the business! Finally you get to end your choices with a combo upgrade which lets me pair my favorite side dish ever cucumber sunomono.

I came here with high expectation because of the high ratings on yelp. I walked in to this store around 3:40pm, there was only one person in line. Lieterally took them 10 minutes to get that person's order. The employees who make the rolls or burritos seemed like they just started working there. They were looking at the menu while they were making the rolls/burritos in front of customers. 

I stood in line for 5 minutes and finally it was my turn. I ordered the stupid good tuna burrito and the crabby bastard burrito. I waited about another 10 minutes to get my orders. Again they were looking at the menu I was standing in front of them thinking I would have been faster if I were to make one. I get it that they just started the business but come on, think about a lot more customers waiting in line waiting for their order. I wish they can speed up their orders.

The rice is the most important factor but here nahhhh. I was very disappointed. Overall the flavor was okay but man that rice just ruined everything. 

Another thing I did not like was their portion. I am not a big eater but when I saw those burritos, I was bummed. Jaburritos offer almost the same price but their portions are as twice as more.

Pretty small portions. I guess I'm used to Sushirrito in SF. The portion size wasn't even the biggest concern to me...it was the quality of the fish. The salmon tasted SO fishy! I was burping it up later and could still taste the fishiness. It's like I had just popped 4 fish oil pills. One thing that turns me off of a sushi joint is the lack of freshness! Quality raw salmon should not be this fishy! It was gross! When the worker was scopping the salmon he was trying to get a perfect little scoop, and that's fine but he was scraping it against the canister to do so, pretty much squishing the salmon. He kept re-scooping and scraping to try to mound the perfect little salmon ball, so that might also be why the quality of the fish was subpar. IMO it's not worth it to mash up the fish just to avoid giving the the customer a little extra (and I'm talking like 2 cubes extra here lol). Raw salmon isn't like beef from Chipotle where you can just crush it and it will be fine (maybe even more tender lol). Texture of raw fish is so important! It's not even his fault though, he was obviously just trying to follow instructions given to him. He was really sweet...but that raw salmon was just plain ol' bad. But hey, I don't really see anyone else complaining so maybe I just got a bad batch. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe next time it'll be better.

I was also kind of annoyed that when I opted out of pomegranate as a topping (included in ""the crabby bastard"") and asked for masago instead (they were both premium toppings that costed $$ to add in), they still wanted to charge me for it. Even though I asked for no pomegrante already! I feel like if it's the same price point ($1.49) it should be an equal substitute.",SbzpL48_peoFEPJApFsV4g,5,1,2,Lww8npE5_5Td4OTXNSiCLg

I ordered the Stupid Good Tuna which comes with ahi tuna, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, tempura flakes,yuzu miso sauce and unagi sauce from their signature creations. I chose the sushi rice and it was mushy. It's probably because the container they put it in is plastic and the condensation makes it mushy, so it's not fresh. The ahi and crab was ok, the veggies didn't seem as fresh and I was not digging one of the sauces. The miso wasn't too bad had a little kick to it.

I'm very particular with my poke. I realized after all these poke bars that has opened up everywhere that I'm more of a traditional Hawaiian poke kind of girl. Honestly, the only poke shop I fux with in Vegas is Poke Express on Stephanie in Henderson. I mostly have had bad experience at these create your own, overly topped style poke spots. 
Tail and Fin has similar concept to those poke shops that have been trending. From poke bowls with endless topping, to sushi burritos. 

A couple distinction stands out here though. They also have sushi tacos and the pineapple bowls. The best distinction I can say about this place compared to its similar shops, the fish taste fresh. I had the salmon, ahi, and spicy tuna for my $9.95 build your own + $2 for pineapple bowl + $1.50 for masago. The fish were perfectly cubed. Not too big of cuts like other places. The pineapple bowl gives the whole bowl a refreshing level of extra freshness.

Unfortunately, it was subpar. I enjoy sushi quite a bit and have visited a multitude of sushi bars, poke spots, and sushi burrito establishments all around town. This place is second to last on my list. 
In comparison to other sushi burrito spots... Portion size is terrible here. 
Taste/texture is nothing to rave about. 
Topping ratio is COMPLETELY off. 
I got a bowl and when asking for certain toppings, they were counted out and nowhere near what I would like (5 cucumber pieces and 2 Yama gobo spears). 
I also ordered a burrito which I believe had more seaweed salad in it than all other ingredients combined. 
Price is fairly consistent, if not slightly higher, than similar stores, but not worth it for the amount of food you get. Myself and my friend were both still hungry after our meals. 

I will say they are still fairly new, so maybe things will get better as they mature. I will give them A LOT of time to figure it out before/if I try it again though.",8OKpRDoUGAlxrUI-GWeP2g,0,0,2,8a0_3A6RMBIi-tW-oO42RQ

Upon parking easily right out front, we walked in and immediately jumped on line (it was understandably busy) The restaurant is in a small section of the strip mall and neighbors Teriyaki Madness, Subway, and a pizza place.

It has minimal modern decor that caters to us ridiculous social media addicts (Photo op wall, and a snapchat geo tag).

There's only about 8 tables, if that. So, I expect it to always be full. We opted to take our food to-go, instead of waiting for a seat to open. 

The food is to die for. My husband and I got two different burritos. We semi customized both. 
We ordered The Crabby Bastard- soft shell crab, surimi crab, cucumber, tomato, furikake, avocado, pomegranate, unagi sauce. We subbed the  pomegranate for spicy tuna and cilantro.

Also, The Omega- salmon, surimi crab, romaine, tomato, avocado, red onion, ponzu, honey sesame aioli. I added mango, raw jalapeño & chili garlic aioli. 
I highly recommend adding mango, it adds a nice sweetness. 

We were in and out in 10 minutes, on the grand opening day, including our wait time on line. Impressive! The staff was organized, happy and on point!

3043329,2018-05-03,0,YYzHvjD16a8Vn6AeaWBKJg,"So ok my first impression trying this place was lukewarm. 
Came in around 3:45 pm on a Wednesday and it was empty. The modern, simplistic, upscale decor is definitely attempted, but it wasn't enough for it not to still feel oddly industrial, and like the space didn't fit the vision. It was just off. Especially behind the counter it all seemed very homemade so it was hard to be convincing that it was upscale modern when you look behind the counter and it looks like someone's home kitchen. 

The young girl who greeted us was very nice, explained the menu, but couldn't tell us about their most eye catching, IG famous menu item which is the Pineapple Express, served in a half pineapple. But she was very sweet and didn't charge me for adding avocado to my burrito because we had never been there before. Which I'm certainly grateful for because the amount of avocado she added to my burrito wouldn't have been worth the up-charge. 

The service was pretty slow compared to other poke places, and my friend got the half pineapple item which required someone special in the back to cut it which extended the preparation even further. My burrito which had been waiting at the register in the meantime, got handed to another customer who left and then had to be tracked down to retrieve it and it was kind of a mess for a second there. We walked out of there like ""whew we made it"". 

That all being said, the food was tasty, but it didn't rate so well in every other way. Hey, if it tastes good then maybe that doesn't matter. But it did affect my overall opinion. 
I got a burrito with brown rice and the rice was slightly hard but surely nothing that would make me stop eating it. The seaweed wrap became so soggy from the time it was made to the time I began eating it that i couldn't take a clean bite. Each bite resulted in this catastrophic avalanche of ingredients falling out all over my hands and onto the paper beneath.  lol it was a friggin mess eating that thing!! I had stuff falling out all over the place and sauce all over my hands. So it tasted good, YES. But it was messy AF to eat and simply knowing sushi burritos shouldn't be like that was something I can't ignore. I think the girl added way too much sauce and really didn't wrap it that well so it was kind of a bummer to have this good tasting meal that was a mess and falling apart. I finished my burrito with a fork so in my humble opinion, burrito skills not on point here, guys. Do it right or don't do it at all. 
Thank God they give you wet wipes in the bag because I needed one like I had just eaten a half rack of ribs. 


The price point here is good, you certainly don't feel like you've been over charged and the food tastes good if nothing else. So it's worth trying but in my opinion I'd have to have a much different experience overall for them to merit 5 stars.",P28OrLTcpxU0eOlwizYKeA,0,0,3,fT64WpUeVP_MW-tGhHdNBA

While walking in we were greeted with a warm hello and a kind smile by a team member named Sophia. As stated, my daughter has never had sushi before and Sophia was kind enough to go through the menu, make suggestions and described some of her own likes and helped my daughter figure out what she should order. Needless to say my daughter was very happy with her selection.
As stated, I find myself stopping by more often to pick up lunch before I go to work. If I have the pleasure to be assisted by Sophia she asks me about my daughter and always remembers what I like to order!!

Pros:
-The two male employees and once the owner got back on track were very friendly. 
-Serving portions were decent. 
-Spicy tuna was flavorful and not too overly spicy. 
-Spicy crab was really good too.
-Fish tasted fresh. 
-They bring out mocha after you're done eating so that it isn't melted if you chose the combo option and are dining in the restaurant. 

Cons:
-Both our sushi and brown rice were rock hard and cold.  (Biggest negative here)
-Fish (salmon and tuna) wasn't mixed with poke sauce; just added on top so there wasn't much flavor to it. 
-Cucumber was bland and oily tasting.

Highly recommend the yellow tail. The first time I ordered it on the avocado for my bf and I to split as an appetizer.

The ingredients are fresh and plentiful. 

Last time I ordered they did forgot my togo sauce. I was super bummed when I opened my bag, but honestly the yellowtail is so delicious combined with the seaweed and it was good enough without it. But note to self - confirm order before I leave :)

When I took the tacos out of the bowl they were soggy because the bowl gathered the sauces into a puddle. Tasted as good as any other poke place and the concept of poke tacos seemed awesome, but this place didn't do it justice.",0QlcJrIKGXpMPIfITLVaAg,0,0,2,gaGA7yiye_c5ZBiYLGeKZw

I got the Pineapple Express. I wanted something different and I thought the pineapple would add a nice contrast to the bowl. Now, I didn't love the bowl but I won't blame them for that, it was probably because I didn't love the pineapple so that's my fault for the choice.

When my friends and I came they ran out of salmon. Unfortunately my friend ordered a sushi burrito with tuna and salmon. They added some extra tuna and then more salmon came out! The guy was nice enough to also add salmon because my friend really wanted it.

The service was friendly and very patient. It took us awhile to order but we didn't feel rushed by them. I'll definitely be back to try something else!",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,1,0,4,bnZ84AHYVbieF7kgpCxP8Q

4106868,2016-09-05,8,YYzHvjD16a8Vn6AeaWBKJg,"Although they had a shaky start, this newest sushi burrito and poke spot in town won me over on the second visit.

Tail & Fin is the latest attempt to capitalize on the trend of poke bowls and sushi burritos. Given that it's headed by a former Nobu executive chef, I expected great things. The interior design looks the part - modern and clean, although the loud music tries a little too hard to be like the Bacchanal Buffet.

Like the other places, you can choose from a predesigned menu of dishes or build your own entree as you walk down the assembly line. Whichever the case may be, you'll be able to make the creation a sushi burrito (choice of seaweed or soy paper), poke bowl (sushi rice or brown rice), or salad (mixed greens or Romaine lettuce).

If building your own, you'll go down the line and pick your proteins (two for a regular portion, three for a large size, +$2 for additional) between ahi, spicy tuna, surimi, salmon, tempura shrimp, soft shell crab, yellowtail, grilled chicken, and tempeh. Then you get to add veggies and other toppings, including some premium options if you so desire (+$1.49). Finally, you can pick from a variety of nine sauces - more on these near the end of this review.

The first time I stopped by was in their first hour of their grand opening. I made some picks from the ""signature creations"" menu to see what was up.

Crabby Bastard sushi burrito ($11.95 for a large): soft shell crab, surimi, cucumber, tomato, furikake, pomegranate seeds, avocado, unagi sauce. It was a pretty good sushi burrito in all regards, but didn't distinguish itself in flavor or quality from other sushi burritos that I've had. No complaints about the pricing, which seems par for the course and provides a good lunch portion (let's be honest, you're not going to do AYCE lunch if it's to-go or your time is short).

The OG poke bowl ($9.95 for regular, confusing in that it says $12.95 on the menu): ahi, salmon, yellowtail, Romaine, green onion, poke sauce, cucumber. I actually skipped the Romaine this time since I figured that it wouldn't add much aside from texture. The poke sauce was awesome, and although the employee couldn't really explain the ingredients to me, it seems like sesame oil, teriyaki or some other sweet sauce, and wasabi. The fish were all tasty if not too high in quality (Soulfish had awesome cubes of ahi) and the green onion and cucumber were nice.

There was a significant issue with the sushi rice in my bowl though: most of my bites had hard grains of rice. My coworker noted the same in her order. A chef with the pedigree of Nobu should not be putting out something with flaws in a fundamental part of sushi.

Thinking that this was a fluke, I returned with friends to give them a second try. I built my own poke bowl this time. The sushi rice was better today, with no hard grains at all. The salmon and yellowtail were both good, but I still wish that they wouldn't cut up the fish so finely. I went with a majority of the toppings possible today, and the standouts were the seaweed salad, red and green onions, and furikake. These were fresh, alone with Romaine, cucumber, tomato, and cilantro. I disliked the tempura flakes because they seemed like more of a puffy cereal type of thing than what you'd find on the outside of tempura fried goodies.

As promised, a discussion of the sauces I know this goes against traditional sushi thinking, but we're talking about glorified handheld rolls anyway, so let's embrace sauces. They're the real star of Tail & Fin from what I've had. I'd already enjoyed the poke sauce, and I was able to try three more on the side today. The yuzu miso was the best, with a citrus kick that's hard to find elsewhere on the menu. The chili garlic aioli is pretty much their version of spicy mayo, and it fills the role capably. Last but not least, the honey sesame aioli is a sweet thick sauce that reminded me of what you'd get on my childhood favorite walnut shrimp dish.

That said, they've been a little stingy with the sauce in general. If you ask for multiple sauces on the side, they tend to fill the plastic sauce containers halfway at most. If they could get it to 2/3 at least and are cool with providing extra sauce for sushi burritos (my Shrimp Tempest today could've used more sauce), then I'll definitely have an enjoyable third visit and more.

Judging mainly from my meal today, Tail & Fin is a fairly successful foray into the poke bowl and sushi burrito space, with fresh toppings and excellent sauces carrying the load of a menu that's otherwise fairly indistinguishable from its competitors. I can't say yet whether it's worth driving across town without giving all of the other places a try, so stay tuned.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,17,15,4,GTjc3LI9kUVy-K5ifeuzBg

Sushi burrito to me is slowly losing it's excitement i mean I still think it's an uncut sushi roll and we've had jaburrito/soho around to establish their dominance as the sushi burrito spot, nonetheless sushi burritos are still tasty. 

Setting: Interesting how lots of sushi derivatives are forming around gyms (poke express/eos, tail&fin/24 hour). The restaurant size is normal, maybe a little bit bigger than the old soho location. Interior is clean with plenty of places to sit. 

First impressions: I noticed a lot of people who look like they worked at a night club, shaking hands with the owner, and taking selfies all over the restaurant. I asked the worker if she noticed the same thing and told me that the partner is an omnia promoter so go figure lol which coincide with a lot of positive reviews on this place but hey that's expected. 

Food: The burrito is small compared to the likes of it's predecessors. I got the crabby bastard which was nice but not mind blowing. The crispiness of the crab was good and the pomegranate seeds added a nice sweet accent. 

Overall: Convenience of course is great but I wouldn't mind driving a few extra miles for food that is more substantial and tasty. Nobu executive chef turned sushi burrito chef? hmm... doesn't make sense to me.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,15,3,2,t1wNMVEf8ulnab4QKdPkfw

The whole point was to pick and go, because I had a scheduled appointment. They proceeded to make my burrito, which they got wrong. They forgot about what we had spoken about earlier. So I waited 15 additional minutes for them to fix the order. In addition to this, the food is mediocre at best. I had the O.G which had day old rice and no seasoning. The burrito was dry and flavorless. My wife got the shrimp tempest, the shrimp was bland and just overall blah. There are plenty of other alternatives to this sushi burrito establishment.

For the Crabby Bastard, I wanted brown rice.  Which they were out of.  Yet again.  You advertise that you have both sushi and brown rice, yet every single time I go in there for brown rice you are out.  Why?  How can you be out of one of the foundation staples of your menu?

For the Shrimp Tempest, I ordered as a salad with mixed greens.  I added spicy tuna and jalapenos, and had them put the sauces on the side.  I thought they would be able to handle this, but when I got the item home, my wife noticed that they forgot to put the surimi crab on it.  IT'S PART OF THE NORMAL ITEM.  How do you forget how to make the Shrimp Tempest when you've got the menu right in front of you?

I think the biggest issue is that they don't write anything down.  I'm constantly having to repeat my order to whoever is behind the counter multiple times, in addition to reminding them to add this or remove that.  It's not that hard to write down what someone orders and then make it, is it?

All told, I doubt we'll go back.  The food is good when it's right, but it's almost never right.  Either hire people who know what they're doing or at least have them write stuff down so they don't screw it up.",g8j4NyIgPeXCuMtM5qDh7w,8,1,2,DiDAjkmeqKBcKCqKtdaUZw

My bf and I both ordered poké bowls off the menu, we didn't add anything extra, since it was our first time we just wanted to try the food as is.

He got Stupid Good Tuna: ahi, crab, lettuce & fried flakes.
He didn't really end up liking it, the fish didn't really have any flavor, even after topping the bowl with unagi sauce. He got sushi rice with his bowl and felt like there should have been more for a ""bowl.""

I got, Flaming Tuna: spicy tuna, crab, seaweed salas & jalapeños.
I enjoyed the spiciness element to it. I really love almost anything spiced. The salad was good, couldn't taste much of the crab and the tuna wasn't that spicy or really couldn't taste much as I ate the bowl. They serve sushi rice with the bowl which I'm not a fan of at all. 

The rice have too much vinegar and over powers the rest of the flavors in your bowl. Opt for brown rice or any other option if they have it!!!!

My first visit would have earned a 4 stars, but the flaws that I thought would pass were still present at my last visit. I cannot look past the ridiculous amount of time it takes to make a sushi burrito. It was forgivable the first time because they just opened, but now it is not. Please get another staff member to help with workflow. 

Items tried:
Shrimp tempest (shrimp tempura/surimi crab) burrito
Stupid good tuna (ahi tuna/surimi crab) burrito
The Omega (salmon/surimi crab) bowl

The shrimp tempest is one of the better cooked sushi burritos I've had. Overall, it's not big on flavor, which is not a bad thing for this burrito. I feel like it needed more than just unagi sauce though. I did like the sushi rice, which was done well.

I did not enjoy the stupid good tuna. The mushy ahi was flavorless. It was hard to get one bite with all components of the burrito. The way my burrito was made, I had to endure many bites of plain mushy ahi. Instead, the veggies had all the sauce. 

The Omega was tasty! I really liked the ponzu and the salmon was fresh. Having it as a bowl allowed me to make sure all the flavors get mixed together. 

A word of advice: I've seen other poke places mix the raw fish in a bowl of sauce or seasoning before adding it to the burrito. 

With so much competition out there now, it's hard to say that I'll be back until I try other places to see how they compare.

5094742,2016-11-01,19,YYzHvjD16a8Vn6AeaWBKJg,"I hate poke bowls if they are NOT made in Hawaii.  There I said it.

Rant:  Poke is the dish.  It is more than just raw fish.  Don't be throwing raw salmon and tuna in a bowl, squirting aioli and eel sauce on it , tossing fresh cucumbers and heaven forbid, avocados on it and call it poke grrrr.

That said, I'm totally digging these sushi burritos and what's served at Tail and Fin is a step above.  

The chef is from Nobu Vegas and the cut above flavors in the sauces, rice, and genius combination of ingredients shows it.  Yes, it's more expensive but definitely worth it (if you're into this ""stuff"").

Example of the creativity?  The ""Crabby Bastard""; deep fried soft shell crab, imitation crab (stop calling it surimi another grrrrr), cucumber, tomato, avocado, kabayaki sauce and pomegranate that adds a burst of freshness and texture that cuts through the oily, richness.  The ""Shrimp Tempest""; two large shrimp tempura, imitation crab, lettuce, green onion, avocado, kabayaki sauce and yamagobo whose earthy, vinegary taste adds complexity and clears any oily finish.

Brave enough to make your own combo roll?  Well chosen, un-daunting list of ingredients and sauces that all work together.  You don't need to worry about making a disaster.

Rolls are 90% filling, 10% rice so the flavors stand out.

Not into pressed rice and laver?  If you must get a ""poke"" bowl.

Friendly off Strip service.  You won't feel rushed if you stumble over your order as a first timer.

I ordered the Shrimp Tempest and added tuna ($2 extra) the burrito was a good size, the length was as big as my forearm. They're pretty generous with their portions. Upgraded for a combo which came with my choice of miso soup and a fountain drink. Total for lunch cost $16 

The taste was good but not great. I've had other sushi burritos that were delicious. This was pretty basic. The flavor didn't hit me like WOW like I expected. It was mediocre. Which I felt a little bummed about.

I like that the restaurant is clean and has fresh ingredients. The staff was friendly but they didn't pack me a spoon to go or napkins in my bag. Good thing I ate there, I had to help myself. Although it's a new establishment, I feel this business can thrive over time and experience.

While unwrapping the burrito, I noticed that it wasn't tightly packed. The seaweed didn't overlap and there was a big gap with fish and rice falling out. The sauce was a bit overwhelming and overpowered everything else. It even leaked into the wrapping paper making everything sticky and a big hassle to eat.

It's clean, the fish quality is good but one issue with the place is the small servings of protein you get with a bowl. With one bowl I had two tiny scoops of protein and maybe half to ¾ cup of rice for about $11. The quality is good to justify it, but if you're really hungry you could probably eat three bowls and at that point you may as well just go to sushi mon for that price.

I always look at the yelp pics to see what looked appealing. I saw mangoes. I love mangoes. So I picked the ""Yo Adrian"" burrito (I like spicey) and added a bunch of veggies and mangoes with extra sauce. Just like how I would make my subway sandwich. Lol. I was a bit afraid of how the sushi will taste. If it's fishy then you know it's not fresh. I took a few bites and there was no fishy smell. Thank goodness. It also makes sense why the place is so cold. They needed to keep the freshness of the raw fish.

 Wanna know if it is good as leftovers the next day? So I kept the other half of my burrito in the fridge. Left it for about a day/24 hrs. The next day I was starving and forgot I had left it in the fridge. I decided to take the challenge and took a bite. Wow. it tasted even better?? my fridge is turned on pretty cold which made the texture a bit firmer, not soggy. So it didn't feel like raw fish. So good!

Note: I am a big rice eater. Most places have dry rice and the people/places here in Vegas don't understand how to eat/make proper rice. It needs to be moist! Dry rice is the worse thing. And I love how this place knew how to make amazing rice. I just want to order it alone and eat it.

First thing you'll notice is the modern decor that immediately connects you to the sophistication of the name itself... ""Tail & Fin"". They deliver quality ingredients followed by a more than awesome staff that provides utmost customer quality experience. You have the choice of carefully crafted items on the menu to creating your own bowl or roll. I highly recommend coming here if you're ever in the neighborhood!",UF5S9-XHsCBaPBL_ShBvkQ,0,0,5,bF_urIq9OuP0a_bXzYuTpA

I mean who wouldn't want to get items with funny names on it right? It was funny until I actually ordered...I got myself the Stupid Good Tuna in a sushi burrito roll. I got my little girl a kids chicken teriyaki bowl. Service was excellent and very helpful. **TIP- if you're new to the place, let them know and they will walk you through it and even recommend getting the already established choices.***  For the Stupid Good Tuna, i opted out the jalapenos and subbed it for the mango. SO GOOD!!! Why oh why must you be so far away?! Food was so fresh and tasty. Honestly, this place was better than SoHo Sushi Burrito. Even my kid liked their made to order teriyaki bowl. She is such a picky eater so when she was chomping down on her chicken I knew another star needed to be added. Prices aren't bad and I think next time I'll do the poke bowl instead and see how that tastes. I could only imagine just as good or better.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,4,5,5,zZNri2B-BMLa9poVNn0lMg

They had unfortunately run out of salmon, I'm guessing this place gets busy..figured it might be a good sign. I got the little left with a spicy tuna, and ahi tuna tacos with the chili garlic aioli, wasabi aioli sauces, I also got the Avocado Boat with yellowtail and the yuzu miso sauce. It was a good ripe avocado and has lettuce and spinach which were just the right amount like a mini salad bowl. The person who took my order was super friendly, and nice enough to offer to take my tray when I was done.

I particularly like you get to choose from a variety of delicious sauces! I also like that with the smaller options this place offers, I can try more fish options. If only they were closer to me, but I could see them opening up even more locations in the future. I will definitely be back!",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,1,1,5,_N1gbTAjhNKbSO7lLZC_jQ

Great food, great taste and the staff top notch, very friendly and takes the time to explain the menu and suggests alternatives if needed!",wK2UyiRYSdUomgSVsJgGxg,0,0,5,Q8QlzG22wV6HJN2L-kkmFA

They were out of pomegranate, which sounded like a strange thing to put in a burrito. But they asked if I wanted a different fruit component added and I chose mango. It actually works. Delicious food and an inexpensive way to get a sushi fix. Thanks all!!",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,1,0,5,Romjt_RmmYz_xgh5fFYCEQ
