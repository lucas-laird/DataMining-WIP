5449,2016-08-04,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"It's rare that I take the time to write a review, much less a negative one; but I could not allow such a horrible dining experience to go unreported. I, much like many others, look to online reviews when making the decision to visit an establishment for the first time. This has been a pretty reliable practice until now. The negative comments were few, but I definitely should have taken heed to them even though they were drowned out by the many positive reviews. I only wish that my family's experience were even the slightest bit similar to those that felt compelled to sing this restaurant's praises. Perhaps your personal experience is dependent upon the cook and wait staff on duty at the time of your visit... In any event, as a first time patron to the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, I will never return. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately, that's where the positives end. Shortly after ordering our drinks, a very persistent fly or two buzzing around our table and our shooing them away seemed to go unnoticed by staff; this was my first opportunity to cut our loses and leave. Instead and regrettably, I ordered the Grizz breakfast, and my wife and youngest son the Spaghetti & Meatballs. In short, they were flavorless, cold and disgusting. My other son and daughter ordered the Western BBQ burger and Chicken Strips, fortunately theirs although nothing to write home about, were edible. The spaghetti and Grizz on the other hand were irritatingly horrible. The spaghetti looked and tasted as if someone poured ketchup over 4-day-old pasta and 2 day old, half-hazardly formed meatballs. Regarding the Grizz, the eggs were cold, flavorless and watery, which its still a mystery how someone can cook watery eggs; the meats were cold and salty and the hash browns were cold, undercooked and flavorless. The Pancakes were edible, until a fly landed on the plate.  I called the manager (Don) over shortly after receiving our food and he seemed utterly shocked that we were not happy with our order, stating, ""we are one of the highest rated restaurants in the city"". I found his defensive statement odd and completely detached from the fact that there were major issues with our order. He did however; eventually express his apologies and a desire to make things right by having something else prepared. Unless there was another cook to prepare it, I had no faith that it would be any different from our first order and declined. The waitress (Chrissy) came over to our table as the manager was there and asked if we needed anything. The manager mentioned to her that we were not happy with our meal and she gave us a look that made no effort to hide her irritation and walked away... That and the fact that the manager made no comment about her disrespectful actions was unbelievable and topped off what was already a horrible experience! The manager adjusted our bill; we paid and left completely feeling as if we just walked out of an episode of the twilight zone. I will never return, and to those that read this review and still take a chance with the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, good luck",UVKEf2UA_j1u5nBwreTINg,3,0,2,1JZE1W0JVbYin0-2m8DPNQ

However to the POS manager DON YOU HAVE SOME NERVE!!
1st off hire more staffing if you know that you are hurting with the wait time and service. (Common sense)

We waited 20 mins to be seated not bad but then 45 mins to an hour more just to get our food!!! You were arrogant and rude you yelled at your poor waitress who was trying so desperately to accommodate to her full area. Everyone was upset! You them tell me nd other customers that our meal would be comped which it wasnt. Now the thing that truly upset me was our poor waitress was so upset she was crying. She was  apologizing for the service since the other waitresses were grabbing her food and she couldn't provide the service she wanted....never ever put down your staff in front of clients!!!

Horrible service not because of the waitress but because of management!!!! 

Fire DON hire someone that knows what he is doing, maybe then he can stop comping out meals!!!!!! And make it enjoyable!!!",Vcgtj8dUkCKYpqUYjNMCCw,10,2,1,dTdpgp_PbsrGoxhNJfx-Vg
19602,2010-07-26,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Black bear is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat.  It's diner, comfort food at it's finest.

This go around we went for a late breakfast.  Had to wait about 15 minutes (Sunday around 1130AM), but it was no biggie.  

We ordered from the lighter fare section of the menu and got a Small Volcano (around $7-8) and a basic egg, sausage patty, hashbrowns, and biscuit (about $6-7).  The small volcano came with 1 sausage (subbed for bacon, no problem), 1 bacon, 1 egg, and 3 pancakes (for $1 more I got the oat/nut pancakes).  I eat big, but still didn't finish the pancakes.  More than enough food.  Good, crispy bacon, simple scrambled egg, and some pretty tasty, hearty pancakes.  All was delicious, and we both hoped they'd come take our plates quickly so we'd stop picking at them.

Service was good.  Coffee kept coming, food came quickly, waitress knew all the answers.  Black Bear never disappoints.  Total was about $24 with tip, a tea, a coffee, and the 2 meals.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,3,1,5,EnlUqavqt50OaAXriwf2CQ

They couldn't take my reservation over the phone though, :( but when we got there we did wait the full 15 mins, but it wasn't that bad. Our waitress was sooo busy in her section but she still managed to check on us when we needed, it's like she read our minds. I had the breakfast from their smaller portions section of the menu. I think it was called the volcano? I can't remember. Anyhoo, I couldn't finish! The small portions are big too! The fruit bowl I ordered on the side was sooo good too.

We were greeted by friendly staff and seated quickly.  Our server was friendly and attentive.
Between us we tried pancakes, eggs benedict, an omelet and a traditional breakfast combo plate. None of us were disappointed in the least.  Each dish was generous, attractively presented and totally YUM.

49221,2014-10-05,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Two and a half stars, if I could.
Water tasted tappy. Environment was quite loud. Price to portion ratio was decent but not impressive.

I ordered The Gobbler sandwich, which was good but not great and certainly not five star amazing. The fries came out a little bit lukewarm and the oil tasted weird, so I sent them back in trade for some mashed potatoes which were slightly overcooked but otherwise nice.

My co-diner ordered chicken fried steak, and in her own words ""wolfed it down."" Came with aforementioned slightly overcooked mashed potatoes, some very overcooked mushy green beans, a corn bread muffin that was alright I guess, and a garden salad that was fine and came with a surprisingly tasty ranch dressing.

We got a free bearclaw from a coupon we'd found on the internet. Super mediocre, and I'd have been very unhappy to buy it at any price. I'm used to the baked-fresh-daily bearclaws from Panera, but this thing came out cold, solid, and covered in clingwrap.
""It's... not fresh. It's maybe three days old. It's a puff pastry, but it's very dry. If you bite into it, it explodes all over.""

I was hungry but didn't know what I wanted. One friend ordered breakfast with hash. The other a salad with chicken. I went with something different: steak sandwich with chimichuri sauce. It was delicious. The bread was soft, the meat was thinly sliced, and the sweet potato fries were the best I had ever had. My lunch was $11 and change. It was so filling I wasn't hungry for dinner. 
My friend wasn't a fan of the hash, it was shredded as opposed to chopped, bed she found it a little dry. The other friend had the taco salad with chicken, he said it was "" ok"".

The food here is flavorless and since Americans basically will eat anything with salt and sugar, it will be fine and reviewed well by most of them; HOWEVER, if you actually want flavor and service, go elsewhere.

Server didn't some back at all after delivering food to bring pancakes, coffee refill, napkins, etc. She only came back for the check claiming the kitchen is backed up, which is irrelevant when relating to service.

When I left, manager rung up bill and didn't even ask how everything was because he probably knew how terrible the complaints are in there due to flavorless food and lack of service.  I then told him that I am further dissatisfied as to why he didn't ask how my meal was, but he could care less since it is busy and this place is making money from people who don't know any better.   

HELLO!!! THE MAPLE SYRUP THEY SERVE WITH THEIR 'FANTASTIC PANCAKES' IS THE CHEAP ONE WHICH HAS ""HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP"" LISTED AS #1 OR #2 INGREDIENT, but most fatties just eat that up.  A normal person knows that there is only one ingredient in maple syrup, and that is MAPLE SYRUP.

64563,2013-06-10,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Ever since we found one of these while visiting our property up in Reno, this is our ""go to"" place for weekend breakfasts. Although this is a franchise business, it never feels that way. The owner/manager is always by the front till, greeting the customers and welcoming them to the establishment. The portions are large without being obnoxious and the food is usually pretty good. We only come for breakfast, so we can't comment on their other meals.

The place is usually packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but don't let all the people standing around waiting scare you off. They turn tables rather quickly and the wait usually isn't more than 10 to 15 minutes. If you bring kids, there are plenty of stuffed bears and other bear related items that can keep them occupied while you wait. One word of advice--if you go on Sunday, try to get there before the local church services end. It seems like that this is the place people like to come after church and the wait can be up to 45 minutes.

Once seated, the service has always been top-notch. No matter how busy the place is, the servers always seem to have a smile on their face and make you feel like you're their most important customer. We've been coming here for years and it doesn't look like they have a lot of turnover in the front of house so the workers must enjoy the atmosphere. It's usually no more than a minute or two before you have your menu and the waitress is ready to take your drink order. Their coffee is good and we'd recommend their fresh squeezed orange juice. Unless you know exactly what you want for breakfast, the drinks will be there before you're done reading through the menu.

I mostly order one of their three egg omelets (the California or I'll choose my own ingredients). No problems with substitutions here. The omelets come with hash browns which have always been crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. My only complaint would be that the hash browns are under seasoned, which could be good if you're on a low sodium diet. I'll include a side of their sausage links to add a bit of meat to my meal. The links have just the right amount of seasoning to have that sausage bite without being overpowering. They are large, fresh and juicy instead of the small, wrinkled ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp that you get in some of the larger chains. Their buttermilk pancakes are large and fluffy and have never been over or undercooked. If you don't think you can eat the full meal, try ordering from their ""Little Less"" menu. The omelets are made with two eggs instead of three and all the portions are a bit smaller.

The bad part about this place is that it's out west Tropicana which is a bit of a drive for us. We wish they'd open one somewhere in the northwest, although then we'd be eating here more than we probably should.",SHaD3Xf6anwY8hIRoYeDXQ,0,0,4,KMHEr3QVHJAFeaf6aYWVBA

74740,2011-07-22,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Warning! If you suffer from Ursaphobia(fear of the bear) do not visit this restaurant. This is one of those themed based restaurants which gives reverence to the ""Black Bear"". They have bear carvings, 100s of stuffed bears, bear hot sauces, etc. I visit this restaurant often because they serve generous portions of freshly made food. I typically go here for breakfast, I have ventured out into the lunch portion of the menu only twice so my review is basically for breakfast. If you are tired of the other restaurants trying to sell you their orange juice as ""fresh squeezed "" then try this place. I hate when I restaurant tries to pass off orange juice from jugs delivered to their location as being freshly squeezed. That's just false advertisement. Black Bear has freshly squeezed orange juice which is made on the premises. The machine can be seen in the left corner as you walk in to the restaurant. 
I usually get the freshly made corned beef hash, hash browns and a biscuit with gravy. This place not only makes the corned beef hash fresh but also the hash browns are also freshly shredded . One of the few places in town that I'm aware of that makes their own hash browns. I have also tried the Joe's Hobo omelette a couple of times. 
For lunch I enjoyed the hot turkey dinner with mashed red potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The turkey is nicely sliced white meat with ample portions. I've never left this place hungry. 
The one day I would stay away from here is on Sunday. The regular manager was not here on a Sunday I dropped by here recently. I must say, the place was not very well run on his day off. The manager that day definitely seemed confused and overwhelmed. The other recommendation I would make is to try to stay in the main dining room.

As far as the food is concerned I usually leave full and happy. The quality of food is good and I enjoy that their hashbrowns and potatoes are not pre-frozen and are all prepared there to order. So far all the food I have tried I enjoyed.

I wanted to give 4 stars but the last two times that I have gone the service has been less than stellar with a really unorganized front of house.

There's so much that we appreciate about the place; the friendly faces, the mixed local clientele, the fresh better than homemade cooking,  but one thing we love is the portions.

397835,2013-05-21,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  Homemade gravy.  That's all you need to know.   

After viewing some YELP reviews about their chicken fried steak, this Texas born and raised girl had to make a special trek across this desert valley to test the YELP opinions about what could be ""the best chicken fried steak"" in town.  So far, this is the best chicken fried steak I have had in Las Vegas.  

A rookie visitor here, I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was.  For a busy Saturday morning, with more than a 45 minute wait - the staff was extra friendly and working their tails off.  

Unlike some other reviews I see, the place was filled with a very diverse clientele.  Very diverse.  I saw many people from every racial and ethnic background in this place.  

The food was excellent.  They have a wonderful kids menu as well.  Our little one had her first ham and egg scramble here - and she ate all of it!  

My final thoughts?  It is worth the drive across town for the chicken fried steak - whether for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  If hungry for anything else, I would probably stick to places closer to my home.  

For Las Vegas southerners who might crave a chicken fried steak once or twice a year - this is my favorite so far.  Not exactly like my momma's - but nothing comes close to a momma's CFS.",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,6,2,4,Q3hAAd1ApdpFd63S4znHnw

700324,2013-11-25,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I heard great things about this place. The reviews raved about the chicken fried steak. However, I had a horrible experience there. It might be because I went there at 5, and they weren't prepped for dinner yet?  My friend ordered the stuffed chicken and I ordered the chicken fried steak. They just ran out of soup, and since we were both in the mood for New England Clam Chowder, we opted to wait 15 minutes. They brought us coffee that we didn't order. We didn't get any of our food because we chose to wait for the soup. My friend had ordered onion rings, which we hoped they would bring early, but alas they did not. Her stuffed chicken was dry and lukewarm. My chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well. The steak was crunchy and it might have been better if it were steaming hot. The waitress ending up forgetting about the onion rings which were amazing. They were hot and crunchy and delicious! I only wish the rest of my meal was just as amazing. 

For our dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate lava cake- both a la mode. However, they premake the dessert, leave it on display, and warm it up.  The cake was kind of dry. The bread pudding was pretty yummy. 

We both signed up on yelp to become a member to get a free coffee and bear claw. However, neither of us got the e-mail which isn't this store's fault, but a fault of yelp?

Two tables came in after us and we left later than them. I understand that we opted to wait for our soup. However, we spent two hours in that diner!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,1,eD10jaEfM-cIXwa3PTGB0w

It is usually a pretty good and convenient place to pick up a home style breakfast but today ""not so much"". To start the waitress brought us water in dirty water glasses. The waitress brought me another glass of water which a little later I realized later that the glass also had old crusted food particles on it as well.  Then I ordered a medium rear New York Steak and eggs and my daughter ordered the triple bacon club. The waitress brought me a bloody rear Steak  and my daughter's club sandwiches had a hair in it. We both excepted new plates of food because we had been to Black Bear several times and the food was amazing so we did not want to totally throw in the towel on the place. By this time I brought the issue up to the manager. Hoping that whatever was going on in the kitchen could come to a stop after his intervention. Our food came back with almost no issues.  My daughter's club was perfect and tasted great but unfortunately my Steak was awful. It had absolutely no flavor and tasted dry, for a medium rear steak that's usually hard to do. I had to drown it in there Steak sauce to even eat it. The Steak sauce was great. So back to the water glass.  I was unaware that during my second discovery of the the dirty glass that the manager had observed my dismay. He immediately came over to the table, apologized and brought me a fresh glass with great tasting cold water.  We are finally through our meal when another manager comes to the table with our bill.

Service was friendly and fast - even though they were very busy. Portion sizes are big, so will will probably have left overs. They also have a huge menu.

The corned beef was ample and it wasn't pasty like number 10 can hash.  The eggs were cooked to order and hash browns were the wide shredded style and NOT over cooked!!  I also liked that the food wasn't over salted in some lame attempt to generate flavor out of a can.  I was able to add salt and pepper to my taste.
Our server was great. It was crowded, not packed, and she took good care of us.  The food arrived soon after we ordered, it was hot and more than enough to fill you up.  The prices were reasonable and a lot better than the $3.50 hotel Starbucks tall coffee I had this morning

Update: I returned to the diner this evening with my family for Sunday dinner. We were less than pleased. My eggs and potatoes tasted like canola oil and my fruit bowl was subpar at very best, clearly not fresh. My sisters sandwich had little to no avocado and white American cheese instead of pepper jack. My dad, a big omelet lover, ordered a spinach, onion, and jalapeño omelet. What a disaster that was. Firstly, they do not have jalapeños despite the fact that I could throw a jar through the front door from the grocery store in the same parking lot. Then when the omelet arrived it was nothing more than a sheet of egg folded over with the onion and spinach sloped on top. No cheese, he hadn't asked for cheese because we were all under the impression that cheese came with omelets as a pretty main component of such a dish.

I have rarely finished a meal there, which is not a bad thing since I love leftovers. The menu is huge, the portions are huge but the cost is reasonable. 

This place smokes Denny's for breakfast and they put IHOP's pancakes to shame.  I have eaten at black bear too many times to count but occasionally I have I had a bad meal at black bear, but that would be 1 out of 100 maybe. 

Worth noting  is the variety of breakfast meats you can get. In addition to the usual bacon, sausage, ham they also serve chorizo, linquica, corned beef, ground beef and tri tip dishes. 

I only have two small nit picks. First I wish they had more then one location in Vegas, (HINT HINT I hope your listening Black Bear, put one up north!). Second I wish they would go back to their old steak fries. What they serve now is just not as good their old ones which were the bomb.

The place was half full and we were seated immediately.  We got our drink order right away and then were given our leisure to peruse the menu.  Lots of tempting choices so she had to check back with us a few times until we were ready.  Decisions.....

We ordered the chicken fried steak, and fish and chips.  The chicken  fried steak was crispy (almost too crispy) and flavorful and loaded with gravy.  The potatoes (red skinned mashed) couldn't have been better.  It came with grilled/steamed veggies done just right.  

The fish and chips were moist and flavorful while crispy and not greasy.  The only complaint on the fish and chips was that while the portion served was big, the pieces themselves were smaller than we've had other places.  The french fries looked better than they tasted.  Not crispy enough for us.

We got pie to go.  The chocolate cream pie was a disappointment.  I don't know what they use for the chocolate filling, but it had an odd taste, almost like a cherry liquor maybe?  Anyway, didn't care for it.  For the price, would rather have gone for a Marie Callendar's and had a full pie.  

Will we go back?  Yes, this place has good diner quality food.  The salads served at other tables looked pretty darn good and what looked to be chicken and biscuits at the next table is going to get us back there for sure.  Their meatloaf special and club sandwiches are on the list too.  

Okay, for some real complaints.  There was a burnt on the grill smell in the air when we came in.  Maybe due to the openness of the kitchen to the dining area.  But a little unpleasant.  When we went to pick out our to go dessert and asked what was in the bear claw, the hostess was clueless.   Let us hope she was new.  One of the waitresses popped over however and helped us out.

I previously gave the Black Bear a 5 star review for my first visit 3 weeks ago, but I am afraid that this experience barely warrants a level of 2 stars.

For 930 am on a Sunday morning there was quite a crowd of people waiting but the place is so big that we were seated within 15 minutes.  
 
As you walk through the door the decor is definitely ""black bear"" themed.  A shelf of stuffed bears circle the restaurant-every stuffed bear you have ever seen is up there.   Probably a little creepy at night.  Just sayin.  So we sit down to order-we are famished!

So in honor of St. Patricks Day I HAD to order the corned beef hash.  The waitress was pretty nice and seemed to know every guest seated around us.  It actually looks like a place where the regulars would go. :)   My friends ordered some kind of nut grain pancakes and biscuits and gravy.  My friends husband had the nut grain pancakes and I thought for a second ""what are you thinkin"" but I let him make the mistake on his own as he is the biggest breakfast guru I know.  He was very sad and disappointed but ate the whole thing even though he didnt like the tast.  The busquits and gravy was just that....a plate full of stick to your ribs gooey biscuits with white gravy.  Looked yummy but I would feel I would need something to go with that...It was huge by the way.  The corned beef hash was incredible with their homemade potatoes.  Toast a little on the dry side but all in all - I ordered the best breakfast out of all of us. ;)

On the way out they have these homemade pies-individual size.  They looked amazing and I was half way temted to grab one to go.  Maybe next time.  I wouldnt mind trying this place out again to try something different.  Its a little out of my way but ya just never do know where you will end up on a Sunday morning on the town. ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,1,1,4,6v-UdweDzP3l3Pyv3Ex-TQ

Our late start had me concerned that there would be a long wait.  But I was happily surprised that there was only a brief wait before we got seated.  And even though it was rather busy our waitress arrived promptly, brought our drinks and took our order.  Their Easter breakfast special was an asparagus and ham omelet.  I don't see how that dish fits with Easter, but I ordered it anyway.  Being gluten intolerant I asked if I could substitute fruit for the bread offering and they were happy to oblige.  I was surprised that the fruit had strawberries and seemed to be more of an upgrade than a substitute, which was great.  The omelet was good enough, unique to my taste, but it wasn't well blended so the filling pieces separated when I cut into it. Sadly, that subtracted from the full effect of the taste combination, but that is the only complaint I have.  My wife had pancakes and bacon from the menu which she really enjoyed.

The long-awaited remodel begins on 15 February.  It seems that, due to some details in the building code, their large collection of stuffed bears will not be permitted to stay in residence after the remodel.  (Dejected sigh.)  They have placed signs on property stating that, if you are the original donor of one of the bears, you have the option of taking it back.  But, the basis for this review has to do with what they plan to do with the bears that remain.

Law-enforcement officers are frequently called to ""referee,"" for lack of a more polite term. domestic assault and domestic violence cases.  These calls frequently involve children, if only (only!) as bystanders.  Police also respond to auto accidents involving shook-up little ones.  Almost every police car has a stuffed animal or two in the trunk to attempt to calm the little ones down.

1103025,2012-08-06,3,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I am writing this review based on their Rib Eye Steak Dinner for $14.99.

Food:

I am not sure why I thought that they would have a good steak, since most diners are known for their breakfast, sandwiches and shakes (should have just went for a shake....), but I still ordered the steak anyway.

Their steak was absolutely disgusting! The worst steak I have ever had in my life (even worse than the overcooked, slightly burnt ones from my ex boyfriend). It was extremely hard to cut through, especially since it was so thin. It was mainly gristle, and no meat. It had so much fat, very bland, and dry. 

It came with an assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, squash, zucchini, and onions) which were the best thing on the plate!

Their salad plate was warm, and the salad was literally lettuce, two dime size onions, two warm tomatoes, two cucumbers, and some carrots. There were no croutons, cheese, and their was barely any onions. They were also out of their gluten-free Honey Dijon dressing (which was aggravating).

I really wanted this Diner to work out, but it didn't. 

First Impression:

The outside makes it look somewhat like a lodge. The inside is just a ridiculous, tacky assortment of fake stuffed teddy bears ( in all different sizes!).

I don't know what type of look they were going for... but when I think of a lodge, I think of walls covered with dead animals, and huge stuffed bears with big teeth (not a little beanie baby....??)

Service:

The server was nice, and we tipped her 20% on our bill for $35.00. Food was delivered fast, since we were basically the only ones in there.

It wasn't because of the food, it was because of the service and errors by the cooks. The food was very good with huge servings, but.... Cindy, our server, began cheery and friendly but ended up not meeting our needs. We look over their super, cute newspaper menu and decide what each of us want to order, she takes our orders, but before she leaves to put the order in, she all of the sudden remembers that the biscuits won't be ready for 20 minutes! :( WHAT?! A few of us had ordered the biscuits and gravy, now we have to re-order! :( So, she brings out the order, well.... ""most"" of the food...a few of us had to wait an additional 5 minutes for our food (didn't order anything special). Something was cooked incorrectly (cooks fault) so now that person has to wait another TEN minutes for their food. It was ridiculous!        NOTE: There were 7 adults, no kids, no unreasonable demands on food preparation....it just wasn't an good experience for us at this location; however, we would still HIGHLY recommend visiting a (different location) Black Bear Diner!

My son lives close to this Diner and wanted to meet here.
His treat sooooo . . .

Wife: Chicken fried steak and eggs
The breading on the CFS was light and crisp, gravy matched well and not overpowering.
Eggs cooked as ordered, potatoes had no crisp at all.
Biscuits looked great but it was very gummy.
Forget the biscuit choose something else
like toast.

Me: Mini-volcano breakfast
Bacon, sausage and egg were cooked to order.
My apologies for being a pancake snob.
Pancakes for me were no bueno.
No crisp to the edges, chewy and rubbery.

Son: Breakfast bowl
Eggs were over cooked.

No bueno for the breakfast bowl.

Don goes out of his way to greet every guest with a high-five or hug, and every child with a balloon.  He makes every visit fun and memorable.  It is because of Don that we return week after week and it is also why my family from out of town and I will be having Thanksgiving dinner there. We can't recommend Black Bear Diner enough.  If I had to find one flaw, I guess it would be when Don isn't there and another Manager covers for him.  The restaurant just doesn't run the same. I've met several of the other Managers and they don't have the same outgoing and fun personality that Don has.  If you're looking for a delicious family oriented restaurant, Black Bear Diner is a MUST!!!",0NjervlRSbrUDH_2A3gqCw,0,0,5,SfKD3UX3xPEsSN3nslbq_w

The waittress was attentive and we were served our coffee and milk right away.

Portuguese sausage was on the menu as well, which is unusual for a non Hawaiian restaurant to offer.   Maybe next time, but this time, I ordered my usual diner breakfast... Eggs benedict with Hollandaise sauce on the side.  Plus, the fruit on the side was plentiful which was an absolute delight.  I actually took that to go as a snack for later on.  
I also got the diced potatoes while hubby tried the the hashbrowns. He also got the fluffiest Buttermilk biscuit to sop up the gravy.  He raved that everything was homemade.  Note: You have to eat the biscuit before it gets cold.
Son got the Strawberry Waffle off the kids menu.  It was big enough for adults and had lots of fresh strawberries, not the gooey artificial kind. 
I loved the diced potatoes as they were tasty,  nothing here was too salty.  
There were stuffed bears all lined up high on the wall to complement the Bear theme.  Also, the menus were cute in that they were newspapers with the menu items listed on the inside. 
Our food arrived timely and since we got there around 8:30 am on a Saturday, we got a table.  Around 9ish, a line started to form.

1570479,2010-07-30,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Honestly, I have never heard of Black Bear Diner before I came here. I thought it was a Vegas/ Nevada thing. Turns out, theres 40+ locations all over the Western U.S., including 4 in the Bay Area. WTF? Shame on me. I wish I learned about it earlier. I would have been coming here more often, checking-in as a regular, and enjoying ""bang for your buck"" meals. 

Speaking of food, if you're craving a lil bit of everything for Breakfast, order ""The Grizz."" It comes with 2 of their special pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links, 1 piece of ham steak and hash browns. They're pretty easy-going on changing things up if you desire. So instead of the 2 bacon strips, I replaced it with 2 more sausage links and in place of hash browns, I went with potatoes. Better. Much Better. 

I couldn't believe how big the portions were. I'm still thinking about it. The sausage links are not your average-sized links. No Jimmy Dean, you couldn't out do these sausages. And when the menu said ham steak, I didn't think it was a HUGE ham steak. Not really big but like I said, above-average, cooked just right. Also, the eggs came in 3 and not your usual 2. It helps to have one more. I was happy with the exchange of hash browns with potatoes. They weren't salty at all and they also threw in some chopped veggies. Good contrast in taste and made me wanna finish. I saved the pancakes for last. I didn't really see what was so special about them but just thought they were alright. If by special they meant size, then yes, they win there. Large pancakes for an already large meal. Overall, very complete meal, like it was meant for two.

Our waitress took our orders WITHOUT a pen and paper; she checked-in on us; AAAND she returned my friend's pair of very expensive sunglasses he had left on the table. Say it with me: WOW. I don't t remember the last time I received service like that but it deserves 5 stars on its own. Besides that, breakfast seems best served here. Diner joints like Denny's don't compare. They make Grand Slams look like a joke. 

The place is a little weird when you first walk in and see all the stuffed bears hung up across the walls and ceilings, as if someone has a fetish with furry animals or something. But it just feeds into the whole concept of the diner. I figured they must've won all the stuffed bears from Circus Circus, being that it's located in Vegas, but then again I haven't visited other Black Bear Diners so I wouldn't know. Anywho, I may not be in Vegas sometime soon to return here but at least now I have the pleasure of hitting up other ones closer to home.

I had the open faced turkey sandwich and a side salad. The turkey was all white meat and moist. The gravy was smooth and a perfect temperature. The lettuce in the salad was fresh - no brown pieces - and the ranch dressing had a nice mild taste. 

My husband had a scramble with ham and sausage. I tasted the hash browns and was pleasantly surprised because they were not greasy like many that you find. I also tasted his eggs and they were cooked perfectly - scrambled hard, just the way I like them.

Service was good as well. We did not wait to be seated or served. Our waitress was very nice and checked on us just the right amount of times. She also brought me a refill on my soda before I asked.

California Bacon Benedict: I'm a Benny person, probably one of my favorite breakfast items, i don't need to say much but this was on point

It's a homey atmosphere with lots of bear paraphernalia and a newspaper menu.  It's seen better days but was certainly packed at lunchtime.

I went for the patty melt and while it wasn't the worst I've had it wasn't that great either.  Kinda bland. 

What I really like is that instead of the typical french fries or onion rings on the side, you can have a cup of soup instead.  As with the patty melt, the chicken soup was average.

Did not know BBD was part of a chain until we started doing research when we arrived.  Our server was friendly and promptly took our order.  Our coffee and water was never empty.

I ordered up the CFS.  It was a damn fine...FINE piece of breaded meat!  The gravy was a nice compliment and not the kind that round house kicks your guts a few hours later.

BBD is home to the magic pancake!  My memory escapes me on just how it was ordered.  Perhaps, it was just to sample and then again...maybe to satisfy some sort of high carb addiction.  The pancake required NO SYRUP!  NONE!  It was sweet, light and fluffy and defied my expectation of what a diner pancake should be.  

It awesome watching the plate float around the table as it allowed the others in our party an opportunity to enjoy.  The second best part of the experience was watching or fellow Black Bear explorer dump a portion of the scolding hot syrup which accompanied (unwarranted and not needed) the mystical flap jack on his lap.  Well, one side of his lap.  HIs GF must have marveled at the one half, maple Brazilian he gave himself.

As I roamed out the parking lot, high on fat, sugar, caffeine and carbs, I stopped to look at some of the photos of celebs who have eaten here, and who should I spy...Nicholas Cage wearing some funky outfit!

Any way, the decor is cute and devoted to its name black bear. It's a family friendly restaurant and I'm not sure if the southern accents are real but they're cute. We were seated immediately but it was about 9 on a Wednesday so I can't tell you for sure if they ever get super busy but I have a feeling they do. The location is about 4 miles from where we stayed off the strip so it's not a terrible drive.

The hostess who sat us didn't really help us much because we hadn't been there and we were confused as to why we didn't get menus but they are in the paper (actual newspaper looking) she sat us with. So that was cute.

We ordered the classic eggs benedict and the country fried steak. Both super delicious. Hand down the best chicken fried steak because the batter is so light and you can cut the steak with the butter knife. Anthony chose to have a biscuit with his meal which was light and fluffy and delicious with both butter and jelly. My eggs benedict we delicious and I had never had it with slices of ham instead of a ham steak and that was yummy because I got more ham with my bite. They also come with a bowl of fruit and hash browns which were crispy on top and fluffy in the middle.

3. sweet cream pancakes - too die for!  just wonderful! freshly made, not heavy, very rich, very buttery.
4. sausage - they say they make their own.  I am from PA where many butcher shops make their own sausage so I think I am quite a good judge there - and their sausage was fantastic!  Grilled, not deep fried like so many places today.
5.  eggs over easy were just that - and not covered in grease.
6.  wait staff was perfect - paid attention to refilling and checking on you but not ""in your face"" - so hard to find that balance anymore.

Ambience: very informal, very casual. Decorated in early ""bear"" - photographs of bears, stuffed bears, and sayings about bears decorate the walls all around the restaurant. Just about the right tone for a place to go for a family brunch.
Food: my wife and I shared a California omelet and the bear claw french toast. The California omelet add sauteed mushrooms, melted cheese, avocado, and other goodies folded into what appeared to be a 3 egg omelet. Fabulous!!! This had to be the best California omelette I've had in any breakfast place in a very long time. The bear claw french toast came with butter and syrup. It was stuffed with almond flavoring. Incredibly sweet. You certainly don't need the syrup on this one. A delicious second course to follow up the omelette.
Service: our server was very friendly and very welcoming. Unfortunately we got there during the Sunday morning rush and she was spread way too thin.

1983049,2011-10-10,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I fell in love with the place before I even ate.

Imagine if your grandmother (who loves stuffed bears but isn't creepy about it) opened a restaurant and it was awesome.

The entire restaurant is lined with stuff bears. Look up? There's a stuffed bear. Look on the wall? Stuffed bear. Look toward the bathroom? Stuffed bear. Besides stuffed bears, wood carving of bears appear both in and out of the restaurant. There's even a painting of bears playing poker! It's thus living up to it's name: Black Bear Diner (even if there are some non-black bears).

It's just one of the places that seem cool and inviting from the moment you step in. The restaurant looks 1/2 Grandmother decorated and 1/2 California Grand Adventure from Disneyland. If you like your surroundings to have a bit of warmth, you'll like it.

But it's a diner and not a museum piece so how does the food taste?

Awesome. That's how it tastes.

I found the place by searching ""Biscuits Gravy Las Vegas"". Several people mentioned this place as having some of THE best Biscuits and Gravy available. Being a former Southern girl, I'm very familiar with Biscuits and Gravy and they didn't disappoint.

Nice fluffy biscuits you can break apart easily. Creamy white gravy that wasn't too runny nor like paste (as I've seen at other restaurants). Great flavor too!

My only mistake was I ordered the spicy sausage patties. Don't get me wrong! They were good and done well. They were simply too spicy for me. Now that's rare as I'm used to very spicy food. Being from a Mexican and Cajun loving background, I'm no stranger to spicy food. Yet, the were really spicy and just a tad outside my tolerance. I could eat about 1 and 1/2 patties before I had to stop.

Next time, I'll get the regular patties. I can't fault them for it. They did ask if I wanted hot and spicy patties and they delivered. I'm the one that couldn't keep up. =)

My fiance had Eggs Benedict with a side of hashbrowns and fruit. Normally I see Hashbrowns that are grated into tiny slivers. Their hashbrowns were more thick which made for a better hashbrown. A nice thick outer shell with a softer (yet still well cooked) center. The fruit was fresh and didn't appear to have any signs of aging.

The service was just fine. I got my coffee filled fairly fast and the manager came by to make sure everything was alright. As a nice bonus, he was cheerful and sincere when he asked. He had that nice grandfather look when he asked instead of the deadpan question you sometimes get. ""Hello. Everything fine? (1000 yard stare) That's great... bye."" Didn't get that there. Just a nice friendly question.

On a final note, the employees all have a smile on their face. They don't have that ""dead inside"" look, I've see at other places. Who wants to eat where the employees look miserable? I don't.

So if you're looking for an old style Mom and Pop type place (at least in feel since they do have several restaurants), give the Black Bear diner a try. It's my new favorite place.",Gcx8OEYpT85qddaoiFw3Gw,3,1,5,vvs-Z67bBA3gDtrCcAXyjg

2006115,2018-06-09,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"This is your basic all-American diner. The decor is cute with wooden bears (duh) and wooden chairs and tables to give it a rustic/lodge look. But tbh, I came here for the food, not the decor. I got the ScramBowl which comes with a side of homemade biscuit and gravy. It's decent but nothing memorable. However, I did really like the gravy which is probably where all the calories are haha. 

One thing to note is that there are calorie counts beside each dish on the menu...which could be nice or not really because sometimes I just like to be oblivious to how much calories I'm ingesting. I appreciate the honesty though. 

Main reason for my 3 star rating is the service and the amount of time it took for the food to come out. I seriously think we waited close to 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't like they were that busy. The waitress would disappear on us and when she did magically appear again, we had to ask for refills on our water instead of her just doing it. She also dropped the check off without even saying anything so we sat there for a while thinking she would bring it to us. I finally looked around the table and saw she dropped it on top of the condiments...because that's where most people leave the bill? 

I don't think I'll be back. Maybe if I'm feeling for basic breakfast and mediocre service.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,2,1,3,zWaNOqdR_4sMa2devrC0Cw

Three of us in our group ate that.  The fourth had the waffle with chicken and said it was great.  The waffle was huge and had a paw print on it to go with the bear theme throughout the restaurant.  The two children ate from the kids menu and loved their dinners and their ice cream for dessert.  Smaller versions of the meals are available, and these are also large portions.  Diners are not charged an extra plate fee if they choose to share a meal.  To go boxes are readily available.  I would suggest getting a to go box and saving room for dessert.  We had the bread pudding, sugar bears lava cake, and the banana split cream pie.  All were delicious and HUGE portions that were perfect for sharing.  We discussed coming back with a large group and ordering one of every dessert just so we could taste each one.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is great, and the atmosphere is family oriented.  We will definitely be back!

The quality of the food itself was a bit disappointing. I requested butter and whipped cream for my waffle, and discovered they only have butter ""alternative"" and synthetic whipped cream. It's a breakfast place with ""whipped cream"" on the menu quite a bit- they should get stuff that contains actual cream in my opinion. Fortunately, the waffle actually came from a fresh iron.

I ordered my eggs over medium, and they came out very runny and soft. I understand they are busy, but again, egg orders should be a strength of a breakfast diner.

I was happy with the service, and the price point. I'd likely actually stop here again when I'm in town, but I'd like to see some improvements to the authenticity of the ingredients.",51JR5RdBs_Jn72HTCoIqHw,0,0,3,YSZ_-T8kkiiGT40yTVJ3QA

I strolled in on an early Saturday afternoon, with small children and a teenager in tow. My boys immediately took a liking to all the bear decor, Black Bear Diner is truly living up to its name. 

The hostess immediately greeted us and we were seated right away. The bus person came out, took our drink orders and let us know the server would be with us shortly. Meanwhile we were waiting, we had plenty of time to look over the menu, by the time our server appeared, we all knew what to order. Our server was friendly but a bit stand-offish, she wouldn't make eye contact. 

Items Ordered:

-Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich
-Chocolate Cream Pie

Our food came out about 10 minutes after placing our order, so it came out quick! I ordered my sandwich with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The meat was tender but it had no flavor, it was very bland. It came with a side of au jus so that made it a little bit better. They don't skimp on fries here. Everyone's plate had an abundance of fries, the seasoning they use made them taste great. Now, onto dessert, the chocolate cream pie was amazing! It was really rich and creamy, it was the best part of the meal. It came topped with a lot of whipped cream and chocolate chips, the bottom layer of the crust is chocolate. Since we came in after 11 a.m., my boys received a free sundae with their meal.

Overall, I would return but next time I would try something else on the menu since I wasn't a fan of the tri-tip dip sandwich. Food is decent, service is good but our server could have been a little bit more attentive. As we were leaving, our boys were given a balloon each by the hostess, I thought that was a nice gesture for the small patrons.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,15,12,3,rNayymPbDq5eflsqFVdJng

 I ordered the Rustic Ravioli because it looked good in the menu. When it showed up on the table it was watery and just tasted like italian seasoned beef. I felt like an idiot because I should have known better than to order pasta at a place like this! C'mon, Black Bear Diner is for breakfast-all-day, burgers, and excessive amounts of french fries! It was a foolish mistake on my part, so I didn't send it back. I ate the bread that came with it and picked apart a few ravioli. My sister let me have some of her yummy breakfast foods that she was sensible enough to order. We decided that when the waitress came back we'd order some blackberry pie.
   The waitress (I wish I'd caught her name! She was really tall with light hair, probably in her 40s) came back to check on us and noticed I had barely picked at my watery ravioli.  She asked if it was okay and I think my discomfort with complaining showed on my face. I told her that I knew better than to order pasta here and that I was done with it. She murmured something placating and took it away. When she came back with our pie she let us know that she'd taken the offending ravioli off our bill and that the pie was on the house. 
   This great service turned a ""Ugh, let's forget this ever happened"" experience into a feeling that someone really cares about customer satisfaction. Good save, guys!

I had the combo meal, which came with your choice of pancakes, French toast, or a waffle (I chose pancakes), eggs, and your choice of meat (I chose smoked sausage). The portions were definitely hearty! I really enjoyed the pancakes, they were filling, yet not too dense, and I intentionally only ate one, so I could have the other later. The sausage wasn't my favorite, but I couldn't figure out why. Eggs were fine and cooked to order.

Our server was pleasant and made sure to come around often to top off our coffee. We ended up with an extra glass of water, strangely, but no complaints. He did seem eager to get us out of there, which I didn't understand- the restaurant was busy for a Wednesday morning, but there was no wait.

My hubby and I went with a bunch of pals. It was hit or miss whether the food was good.

My hubby enjoyed his ribs and fries - a very large portion size. The ribs were fall off the bone and layered with a good amount of BBQ sauce. They weren't the best ribs ever but they were good for the price. The corn muffin was not good due to the fact that it was stone cold. My hubby said that my corn muffins are better regardless... and I make mine from a box (Trader Joe's, baby), LOL!

I ordered their famous 7 almond granola pancakes ($6.99) which were alright. They are a rather large size (not Hash House a Go-Go size, but big enough). The flavours  were okay but the main issue was texture. They didn't have quite the fluffiness on the inside due to the amount of granola. Nor did they have the nice crispness on the outside either.

Our waitress was fine for a diner setting. She split our checks without a problem and was okay with the refills.

Overall, considering the service, food and value - this place rates a 3 star review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,3,3,KAu-y01KsMYIyrBUBSggxQ

My main issue with this place was the time I went here which was on a Sunday, that I waited an extremely long amount of time to get seated.  It was because I was solo that day because there are no bar seats here for single customers it really seemed like anyone coming in by them selves waited way longer than customers in groups of two or more.

Maybe I shouldn't have ordered hash at 4 in the afternoon? They do advertise breakfast all day but maybe the morning breakfast cooks handle it better.  HUGE disappointment.  The country potatoes were chunks of REALLY greasy potatoes sprinkled with some burnt onions.  Not caramelized or sauteed onions but actually black, incinerated, charred and inedible.  My over-medium eggs were over easy, very easy.  And the big biscuit was MICROWAVED and chewy, soggy.  Anybody who knows anything about biscuits knows not to microwave them.

I was greeted promptly by our server William who was bursting with energy it seemed!  He brought my coffee while I waited for my friends.

Without a car, I would not attempt the trek here if you're not a local. It's not in the fanciest strip mall or in the best location, but the food is reliable and the service is friendly. I think of Black Bear as what I'm always expecting Denny's will be but isn't: Big servings, fresh food, fast service. 

Omelets, Chicken Fried Steak, and other plates range around $10 - and if you order a biscuit as your bread for any of those, you'll have invested in at least two meals; they're huge!

They are mass produced and honestly lack in the ""homemade"" taste you would expect anything labeled a ""diner"".

Daughter had the Chicken Parm, $13 - she was trying to convince herself that it was really really good, but from the looks of it it fit on the plate to nicely. Would rather see the chicken hanging half off the plate and spaghetti sauce dripping from the plate, you know rustic diner food, this dish fit on the the plate perfectly, the chicken was perfectly shaped and the spaghetti sauce kind of watery. the cheese on top of the parm looked like a picture right off a banquet tv dinner box. Meh.....

My little guy had the 6oz ny steak off the kids menu. For $7 was a deal, he said the steak was good, didn't touch the veggies. Ate the mash potatoes.

This is where the word ""diner"" should be removed from the Black Bear. They don't make their own mashed taters and the brown gravy tasted just like was power and water stirred till thick, total disgrace. With the mashed potatoes they did try to fool you by having a chunk of potato every 3rd bite. These babies tasted like 6th grade lunchroom taters. What a shame.

The cook is nearly always excellent and delivers the best tasting omelets and hash browns.  I switch between wheat and sourdough toast. I have opted for the fresh fruit before but they tend to put flavor full fruit on top of rind flavored fruit chunks. Flower (hostess?) and Marlene to me are the power duo. I have always had good , prompt and friendly service here but those two are the shining stars in my opinion. There are bear decorations all over the place and a jukebox kicking out older tunes . A very home cooked meal and small cafe feel kind of place. I was shocked to find out it was a chain since everything seemed to perfect to be a chain. The pies and shakes are the only other items I have tried (to go) and they are quiet flavorful. They are about the size of a Marie Calendars pot pie but filled with sweet tooth goodness. I only wish they would have a Peach Cobbler that wasn't flavored with splenda as I despise fake sugars.  The other cobblers (Apple, Blackberry ) were very good. They also have Banana, Chocolate and Coconut creme pies if that is more your style. The Cinnamon rolls are massive and look very tempting  but I am always so  haven't tried one yet.

I recall discovering it around 2005 and I'm not even sure there were other BBD stores in the valley at that time.  However, it appears that there are now a foursome or thereabouts.  Regardless, this is my ""go to"" Black Bear Diner when in Sin City.

This is solid eating, folks.  I'm more of a lunch and dinner person, but I have been here for breakfast.  Breakfast may be good, but the lunch and dinner fare is great.  I like the selection of entrees, the portion size, and the taste of their food.  It's far from fine dining, but it certainly fills the stomach and is a good value.

Also, if you think The Strip is the real Vegas, you're kidding yourself.  I'm joking.  However,  If you want to rub elbows with the real Vegas, come here, especially on weekend mornings for breakfast when there's a wait.  You'll see newer cookie cutter home dwellers, mobile park residents, locals, foreigners, New Yorkers, Californians, tourists, retirees, casino employees, and employees of anything and anywhere nearby.  It almost makes the crowds on The Strip look like the fake Vegas.  Well, that's not true.  However, the reality is that this is the amalgamation of what makes Las Vegas tick, breaking bread right alongside you.

In concert with that, the service is informal, friendly, and even animated.  The same could be said of their patrons.

Of about a handful of visits over the years, two really stand out.  On a breakfast visit, the duo behind us was very interesting, but I was the one positioned to see them.  There was a sinewy muscular guy who looked like a gangster wearing a polka dot sundress with white tennis shoes and nylons and his hair in a ponytail sitting with this big guy with a beer gut in tattered jeans and work boots.  Now, while it does not matter, the hows and whys this incongrous duo are lunching together might still have you scratching your head.  And you just tell yourself that you're not in, say, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  But it wasn't just that table.  Everyone in there was interesting in that ""everything and the kitchen sink"" Las Vegas way ... and the place was packed.

On a more recent dinner visit, a friend and I were discussing the whereabouts of a previous long term employee we were very fond of, in addition to talking about friends going back to about age 24.  A friendly enough patron approached us as he finished his dinner and started talking to us about the employee, who he also liked.  While that was good to know, that also meant that he had probably listened to half an hour worth of armchair psychology.  After chatting with us, he left.  We then paid the bill and also left.  Once we got into the car, we busted up laughing because we were wondering how much of our conversation he had eavesdropped on.  And you just tell yourself that you're not in, say, Seattle or Minneapolis.

In addition to their good food, amicable service, and the trademark quirky theme and decor, this is the sort of stuff that makes this BBD even more memorable.  The people are ""real"" in that irreverent, free wheeling ""doesn't matter where you're from"" Las Vegas sort of way, making this more of a ""real"" Las Vegas experience.

Black Bear Diner really covers the bases ... from Mt. Shasta, where the chain was born on a hillside where black bears eyed the strawberries, to the I-5 corridor between Portland and Seattle to the Central Valley of California to this one, at Trop and Decatur in Las Vegas.  And, regardless of which BBD I've eaten at, one can count on their consistency and on delivering.",_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,10,7,4,OUdD4KLlxkNj7SfUsKDBcQ

The place is decorated with thousands of stuffed bears and other bear essentials of home decor.  The place has a very homey fell and the staff are very friendly and welcoming every time we come.  

All of the dishes have a made by Grandma Kitchens taste.  Every dish I have tried has been delicious.  The Pot Roast is so tender and amazing with the taters, veggies, and yummy gravy.  Breakfast dishes are also very delicious. I absolutely love Omelettes and they have some tasty combos. Pancakes are also solid with thick and crispy bacon.

Unfortunately the supervisor we spoke to was not very knowledgeable about the way to cook salmon, as my son in law got, if the salmon was not thick.  Seriously!  It was like a brick, crispy on outside and dry in the middle.

In strong first position is Baby Stacks= however, if you are in the area and there is a Black Bear Diner close by- by all means stop. I always select an omelet from the healthy side, you will not be disappointed. Made with egg whites, crisp fresh filling of bell pepper, onion, tomato. spinach, what ever you desire. Fresh warm toast, pancakes, awesome crispy hot potatoes, ( I always have the home fries), delicious coffee, and they even include a lil fruit bowl. Yummy, fresh and friendly, my kind of place! Have never had anything but breakfast here so I cannot comment on other menu items, but have heard the pot roast is mouthwatering. Note: There will most often be a wait because this is one hot spot to eat- I try to keep in mind that the wait isn't the fault of the management- it is the folks who are enjoying those great dishes= soon my table will come, and I will side into my seat, place my order and slowly devour every succulent morsel.... yes you will wait, but it is worth it... so very worth it.",0Ws_PZXIa2c0GRAF_eHsXA,0,0,3,qIQ5vPHAdOrdmTlFrsgpxg

Corned Beef and Hash ($10): it came with a side of ""fresh watermelon"", two over easy eggs and a biscuit.  The Corned Beef was not from a can but it overcooked where the meat was crunchy and hard.  The fresh watermelon was not fresh, it looked like it was sitting in a serving container.  The biscuit was OK and the over easy eggs were good. 

Polish Sausage Link ($4.50): The polish sausage had no flavor and it was super greasy.

Since im trying to stay away from red meat, I ordered the Spicy Turkey on Sourdough Bread. It came with onion rings. If you refer to my pic, the sandwich itself is pretty big. I gotta say it was very tasty with a little kick to it. It Definitely filled me up.

Service was above average meaning she came around and checked up on me every now and then. I only had to ask for refills once so she was on point for the most part.

I would say this place is a decent place to go to if plan A falls through. For some reason I thought they were 24 hours but they have had the same hours since they opened long ago.

So this place to me is ok in my book. Decent food, service, and ambiance. Nothing really stands out and nothing really deserves a complaint.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,10,8,3,gNQYJI3Q_CJO51iZT6WpnA

They have an assortment of foods anything from your normal eggs,sausage,pancake breakfast platter, to one of their best sellers their homemade meatloaf. If you are in the mood for food to lift your spirits but not worried about calorie counting this is the restaurant for you! Great portions, good quality, and very very affordable! What more could you want?!
       I got The Bizz; 3 eggs, 2 sweet cream pancakes, 2 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon and hash-browns. It was exactly how I imagined and the pancakes were some of the best I ever had. I have never been big on pancakes but I fell in love with these they were fluffy and being made with sweet cream gave them this hint of sweetness. The only thing that could have been better were the hash-browns. They weren't your normally shredded  potatoes they were more like flat noodles that had been cut up and fried. The outside of the hash-browns were very crispy and the inside really soggy....were not really seasoned so they left much to the imagination. I think I will choose the country potatoes instead next time.
       My boyfriend got the country fried steak. Never been a fan of country fried anything because it is normally very very salty. This on the other hand was pretty good. My boyfriend being a country boy raised on this stuff said it was very very good. 
       Last but not least no matter how full you are you must take home or try one of their home baked goods. I have always gotten their cobblers and they have never failed me. Crust and fruit filling are always the perfect combination and the crust especially flaky and buttery. This time around I tried the strawberry cream pie with cookie crust yum yum. I think I would like their banana cream or even coconut cream pie better. But def must try! I will continue to come here time and time again.

There a nice cabin feel to the dining room when you walk in, and at the hostess station has  a  nice display of mini pies in a small refrigerated display case,   Those pie would be been cleaned out of the case if Boo Boo was here.   The interior is surround by hundreds of teddy bears, and a few collectible toys from a few generations before hand. 

Well, I sat down and looked at a menu, and that darn menu could doubled as the Yellowstone Gate newspaper, because it had a rather large selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner items.    It took a few minutes to decide what to eat, and the waitress who had five other tables was running slight attitude like Ranger Smith on a bad day.    Perhaps, I just wanted to keep her waiting a little longer, but I really couldn't decide what to eat, after all it was my first time eating here.    Well, I gave up, and asked my waitress for her advice, The Bigfoot chicken fried steak or the Grizz?    At that point, she mellowed out, and said their specialty is Chicken fried steak, and Bigfoot is the signature dishes.    Chalk one up for the chit, and put the order in doll face.

Under three minutes later, my pancakes and main dishes is served!   Wow, that was way too fast, and holy smokey bear this order was huge!   At first, I was a little confused...three minutes to make this order?   Well, I hammered the pancakes, and it was pretty good.  Not the best I ever had, but it was about 7.5 out of 10, and this was the best thing about this meal.   As for my chicken fried steak, it was pre-made, and didn't have that nice crunch when you bit into it.    The gravy was okay, but didn't have that slight sausage flavor, and I hate saying this but I had better at a few mom and pop places around town.   The egg were done right on the spot, and the hash brown was very good. 

That morning, I was a rogue bear running amok, and setting a bad example for the other animals, but this review is one of them.    It wasn't a bad visit but it wasn't a great one either, the size portion Black Bear gives are enough for a family buffaloes or one huge Hawaiian bear like bruddah IZ (which I'm not), but what threw off this visit was the waitress (who might have gotten too many tables) and questionable speed of my meal.   I rather wait for a fresh batch of chicken fried steak, than to get it in three minutes.    Did Boo Boo miss out...nope, but they can decide for themselves on Yes or No when they visit Black Bear, and so should you.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,2,2,3,lgiHsbtOP5UAHSzeHzxnnQ

2927408,2011-03-13,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I went on Yelp one morning to find out where my boyfriend Don and I should have breakfast at. We wanted to go somewhere we've never been before and a place that was a local hot spot. I came across this place and (based on the reviews) it was a must.

We met up in the plaza around 9am. The place is pretty incognito on the outside. Because we live in Vegas, it just looked like another sports bar and grill to us. Don actually used to live down the street from the diner and I guess he never thought it was an awesome restaurant, judging on its low-key appearance. 

We were greeted and seated right away. Based on the personal conversations and waitresses knowing the customers' names, it seemed like there were a lot of regulars. That's how you know this pace is a local gem!

I ordered some coffee and Don ordered some oj. After perusing through the Black Bear Times Newspaper Menu, Don decided on the Country Fried Steak and Eggs and I opted for the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes with a side of sausage links. Normally I'd get pancakes with chocolate chips or sweet toppings, but I decided on the 7-grain because the menu said that they were FAMOUS for them. 

Our plates came and they were pretty big. Good thing neither of us got the hungry bear breakfasts! Don's plate came with a giant biscuit that was perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. It was soo delightful!  I didn't try any of his country fried steak or potatoes, but he finished the entire plate, which is a good sign!

My pancakes were delicious! I've never had anything like them. Normally when I order pancakes, I can't finish them, but this time I finished all three and the sausage links. They were perfect with the syrup and they weren't too dry or too mushy at all. The almonds gave them a very nice sweet taste and the grain/granola combo actually tasted awesome (sorry, I can't really explain!). It didn't taste as ""healthy"" as it sounds though, which was definitely a plus in my book! It probably was pretty healthy though, because I literally had to drive like a madman all the way home and run into my house just to use the bathroom. 

All in all, I love this place! It's a great place for breakfast and it is definitely a local gem. I really suggest you try the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes if you're a fan of pancakes, because you will love them. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, which is hard to come across these days. Their coffee is also delicious and it comes with free refills of course!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,7,5,5,JX9iWMxvgBYAynpuANm_0g

2999517,2014-07-29,2,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Quick Look: Not exactly a classic ""diner"" that someone from the Northeast (like myself) would be accustomed to. Someone said a ""country kitchen"" in another review and that is spot-on. Let's just say it's a country-diner w/ decent enough food. 

In Depth Review: Walked in on a Saturday at 8pm and was greeted by a friendly hostess and a pie display case that sounded like the motor was on it's last leg and needed some WD-40. I asked to be sat away from that noise. They sat us in a back corner table near the kitchen, the floor underneath was covered in food debris from previous diners. Not the best first impression. I am not going to lie, I was nervous at this point. 

Waitress seemed friendly and took our drink orders. We each ordered the Arnold Palmer (iced tea / lemon-aid / strawberries) and they were delicious. The lady ordered the corned beef and hash breakfast and I ordered the grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich with a side of fries. Took about 15 minutes for our food to make it to the table. Side note: during this time I used the bathroom. The man's bathroom was quite the site. The toilets were disgusting. The vent system was making an awful screeching noise in the ceiling above and the light was flickering. Was the perfect creepy setting for an 80's horror flick. I was really nervous at this point and got out of there fast! 

The food arrived and the portions were HUGE! They certainly feed you here. My wife loved the corned beef and hash and scarfed down a good amount. She's tiny and I was impressed. My chicken club sandwich looked great but was not up to par in the taste department. The chicken was overcooked and dry. The bacon was hard as a rock. I am certain the bacon was not cooked fresh and was cooked earlier in the day and just slapped on the sandwich to expedite the kitchen process. On a positive note, the french fries were AMAZING! 

So it was a mixed bag with our first experience here. The bill was cheap and I can understand why so many senior citizens were eating here. Saves them and anyone on a fixed income money. The food was decent enough, just not over the top impressive. 

In Summary: I have been missing the Greek Diners that I grew up going to in New York. The massive Lemon Meringue pies that are about a foot tall in the display cases up front. The club sandwiches, steak fries, milkshakes, fresh coffee and all day long breakfast at the counter w/ your neighbors. Was hoping that the Black Bear Diner would satisfy my diner itch, but sadly it did not.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,2,1,3,3OyU0m8xEkukW_4JKsaYgA

3028688,2014-10-02,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"My husband and I went there for the first time on a Wednesday night about 7pm and there was no waiting time. We approached the front counter and there was a girl with one elbow propped up on the counter behind her and she said hi and I said there were 2 of us. She asked if we wanted a booth or table, and I replied we would like a booth. She proceeded to take 2 folded newpapers (which, upon our own investigation, we found to be the menus on the inside) and walk towards the first booth. She didn't mention we should follow her, but I figured we should when she went to the closest booth. She somewhat tossed the menus on the table and asked what we wanted to drink and said our waitress would be there shortly. Needless to say, our first impression of the restaurant was awkward, and we almost felt like we were intruding on them. Meeting our waitress wasn't much more pleasant. I honestly don't remember her name, but I would request, if we were to visit again, to not sit in her section. Here's the thing, I'm under the impression that if you want to make good money as a service person, you should be very pleasant. Our waitress was just nice enough to warrant a tip, but she was not very friendly or cheery. My husband and I are neither one hard to please in the least and we both were unhappy with the service. Every time I said thank you for whatever she was giving us, there was absolutely NO reply. Nothing. Some sort of acknowledgement would be nice that I spoke to you.

Now, on to the food. The sweet tea was great, and this is a hard thing to get an approval for from 2 southerners from Texas. My husband ordered the CFS with fries and green beans. The CFS was pretty good and the gravy was good. The fries were also good. The green beans were WAY overpowered by the onions in them. That's all you could taste, pretty much. I ordered the Mikey's chicken pot pie. It was pretty tasty, however, I wish it had been mentioned in the description of the contents that there were mushrooms in it. I don't care for mushrooms, so I dug through the pie to remove them, then enjoyed the rest of it. The crust and creaminess were great. We both started with salads, and those were good, too. My husband ordered the lava cake for dessert, and I had a few bites. It was also pretty good. 

At the end of the dinner, we went to the front counter, and again, was very briefly asked, by the same girl as before, how we liked it, and we replied that it was good. She took my credit card for payment and, instead of handing it back to me at the lower part of the counter, she placed it on the top counter (almost at eye level), handed me a pen and 2 slips from my transaction, and turned and walked away. Really?!?  There was no ""Thank you"" ""Get lost"" or even a word after. Again, my husband and I just felt like an inconvenience to them. This whole experience was just awkward and we felt unwelcome for sure. I wish we had been on the other side of the restaurant where the only cheery and happy and laughing waitress was. I saw no one else that worked there smile. Not even once. Our waitress barely broke a grin, for goodness sake!

Overall, I liked the food way more than the service, and that isn't saying much. There is supposed to be a new location opening in Henderson this fall. We will probably go eat breakfast at that location, but I don't think we will return to this location probably ever.

If I could have given this place a 1 1/2 stars, I would have. It's too bad since I really have been wanting to take my husband there for the sole purpose of him getting his beloved CFS (it's really hard to find a great southern style one to compare to back home in Texas). He was happy to get a pretty good one, but the experience was tainted by the unwelcome attitudes and faces we encountered. What a disappointment.  :/",kjxfZDGWnHM_x4ERmJhGnQ,4,0,2,oHYqsHpmbB57sR9og9ZIUQ

Black Bear Diner, was pretty much easy to find.  On the corner of Tropicana and Jones, you can see it right off the road.  The location, is a good location to find this diner.  From the looks of it, it has that wilderness look and a set of wooden bears outside, which I thought it was cute, but of course that wasn't the only cute thing about it.  Walking inside, we were greeted promptly and was seated right away.  The really cute part of it, is all these stuff bears all around you.  Kind of brings back the childhood days, when I had a stuff bear.  It really put a smile on my face to think that.  

We went there, early lunch, which I had my doubts on service.  Cause usually when its the beginning of lunch, I usually assume slow service.  But it was a bit surprising that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be and the service was prompt.  From the point we were seated to a waitress asking what we would like to drink, was just a matter of seconds.  I was very impress that they were ready and willing to take our orders.  Unfortunately I wasn't ready and needed a minute, but after I was done and put down my menu, there was our waitress, who is ready to take our order.  Well, she was talking to another customer, but really surprise that she came to our table right away, after the fact that I just put down the menu.  

I was debating on the Taco Salad or New York Steak.  They both sound good and tasty, but decided to go with the New York steak and eggs.  I'm sure the Taco Salad, would of been great, but I'm glad that I went with the steak.  It was well done to my satisfaction and presented very well.  I basically ate the whole thing, and a slice of toast.  Hoping I would of went with dessert, but I was full and satisfied with the steak.  I'm sure dessert would of been great.  

Over all, I was very satisfied with my visit, and recommend this to anyone who is very hungry, like  a bear.  Even though, you may not be hungry like a bear, you got to check this place out.  Sure enough, you will not be disappointed.  Especially if you love plush bears on the ceiling, that got to put a smile on your face at least.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,2,1,5,g52NnRuw280HxzsCdxlwcQ

When we walked in the place was a bit empty. Our servers name was Dawn. She wasn't talkative at all but was nice enough to suggest a few things off the lunch menu since I was feeling a little indecisive. That and I sometimes like to see what server suggest seeing that they know the menu better than I would. She suggested the chicken club , so I ordered that without Swiss . And my wife ordered the turkey club. They both came with fries since I wasn't sure what kind of mayo they used I requested mayo on the side. 
Later reading the menu I noticed the chicken club didn't mention what type of bread it comes on so I flagged a different waitress to see what kind it came on. She replied whichever kind of I wanted , I frowned replying that I wasn't asked so my wife and I told her we both would like them on white. 
When our food arrived everything looked so good, I almost forgot to take photos lol but Don't worry I snapped a few. 
The food was great our server wasn't to attentive we had to flag her down a few times to ask for extra napkins refills etc. her service wasn't so great to say the least. 
The chicken club was great but I loved the turkey club better! If you asked my wife she loved the chicken club more, so we swapped . And if your wondering what type of mayo they use, it's Best Food. Black bear diner gets an A plus for that . 
Oh and by the way I ordered a bear claw to go because I read a review that mentioned they were so good (I had to ask about it because it wasn't on the menu) I wasn't impressed , my mom says it tasted fine & I thought it was dry , I don't know !

I love the environment and the theme, bears bears and more bears. Also, the kind of woodsy feel ties it all together perfectly. Their menu is rather interesting, it's a print of an old newspaper. On the inside is the actual menu. I have my personal favorites including the grizz breakfast and bobs big bear burger deluxe. I also really enjoy their side salad served with mm bacon ranch. I have had a number of other things from their menu that were sensational. The price isn't bad for anything either, especially for the amount of food they give you.

It also comes with eggs and potatoes. I usually get the hash browns extra crispy. These aren't The frozen hash browns. They are fresh potatoes sliced and fried into deliciousness. 

Back to the pancakes. It's like having dessert after breakfast. They are sweet cream pancakes and are hearty. I'm not a fan of fluffy air pancakes. I like mine dense and hearty. These hit the spot. 

They do have other good food as well. Their burgers are good and the fries are really good too. Their thousand island dressing tastes homemade. 

Service can be hit or miss. Most of the time they are all friendly though. But I still give it a 5 stars.",gvseieQ-NpW_YobHGQo3FQ,1,0,5,51uDFAGjOdYmdj9AF5lE5w

I went with country potatoes cooked up fresh with peppers and onions. It comes standard with a  biscuit or toast. I opted to substitute a pancake, which Candy obliged without hesitation. The pancake was so good we passed it around the table and ordered two more. They come with plenty of piping hot syrup, which is a good thing because JR drenched his pants with the first one. No need to wax this week. The over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was better than average.

As we are waiting for the food, candy (server) was walking around helping all the other customers with a smile and very nice. I'm thinking, that is weird. Maybe when she gives our food to us, she will be nice now. The food comes and Candy says excuse me! and throws my plate down and does the same with my BF. Wow! WTF did we do? Whatever, by this time, I'm like let's just eat our food and leave ASAP. She made me feel so uncomfortable. She went to other tables and she was chatting and laughing and recommending items to customers. I have never felt so uncomfortable and confused in my life. 
Onto the food review:  I take a bite of my Tri tip sandwich (blazin bear sandwich) and it is cold. The bread and the tri tip was very cold. It came straight out of the refrigerator and onto my plate. The most disgusting thing I have eaten. I couldn't even finish my food. The Tri tip was hard and dry cause it was so cold. Not sure how they can serve food colder than room temperature, when what you ordered was suppose to be a hot sandwich?? I ended up eating my fries, since that was the only edible thing. My BF ordered the grizz. The bacon was cold and soggy like it was cooked hours ago. My BF complained that the pancakes tasted funny, so me loving pancakes, I told him if I can have some of his pancakes since my food wasn't edible. I took a bite of the pancake and realized it was raw. The pancake was gooey in the middle and uncooked batter. That was my last straw. I wanted to leave whenever candy came back.

This restaurant is like the Black Bear version of Cracker Barrel.  The ambiance is filled with stuffed bears all along the top of the walls and a big bear totem-like structure in the middle of the restaurant. There is a gift shelf stocked with tshirts, loganberry syrup, etc. if you want to buy a souvenir.  

The food is good and it is definitely a family restaurant. It's clean and the employees are very attentive.  Angela was our waitress and took her job duties very seriously.  I had my bear claw which could feed 2 people! The coffee was good but I like my coffee very strong which it wasn't. Hubby had chicken fried steak and eggs and was very happy with his breakfast.

I perused the rest of the menu and if you are vegetarian you won't have a problem with breakfast items. If you are vegan well there is only a seasonal fruit plate or salad. I really wish that this restaurant offered a vegetarian /vegan burger or even a vegetable platter.

The pies and cobblers in the front case looked exquisite. 

There was a mango tea advertised which made an excellent mocktail. Black bear diner doesn't serve alcohol.

The place has a real country/rustic feel to it with its fake wood columns and beams, wooden bear sculptures, and nature paintings. It's a cozy and comfy environment. The menus are kinda cool because they're designed like a newspaper with the food and drinks listed on the inside.

Come hungry because portions are big. I got the bacon bleu burger, a huge burger loaded with bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bleu cheese with a massive pile of fries taking up every available square inch of the rest of the plate. It was really tasty and more than I could eat. My kid got some apple cinnamon french toast, which was cut in thin strips. He enjoyed it but it was a little too soggy for me when I tried it (I always stuff myself silly when we go out to eat because I eat my food and usually his food that he doesn't finish). He also liked all the stuffed teddy bears lined along the walls.

Service was friendly, but after we got our food we didn't see our waitress again until we flagged her down to get the check. It would have been nice to get a  refill on drinks.

I thought this might be locally owned, but it's a franchise. One of 42 locations throughout the west coast, Arizona, and Colorado. It's a pretty good place to go for lunch and their breakfast items looked appetizing. It's definitely worth another few visits.

She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their ""little less"" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a ""Bear Claw"" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,31,28,4,RORCaYV9Y7caN50q1lbhjA

Chris the morning manager the day I went, was really on top of service, he got us seated right away, continually walked the floor and made sure people were taken care of and just overall assisting wherever needed.  Our waitress on the other hand could have been more involved.  She took our order and was barely around and was a little gruff when I asked about the selection of hot sauce and that whatever was on the table was all they had (which my other visits demonstrated there were still only proprietary sauces but there were a couple of choices).  Chris ended up getting a refill on my coffee and made sure we had the rest of what we needed, the only other time the waitress stopped by was to deliver the check.

For this location, I tried the California Benedict.  It was pretty good, the hollandaise worked well with the bacon and rest of the ingredients.  In future visits that will be a selection I try again.  Otherwise it was a quick in/quick out visit, but had Chris not closed the gap I would have ringed another star.",S35wtbj1kKgmmSBD5wLfuA,1,1,4,HefnJQYCrZ5kYE0Ozp8GmA

I ordered the thick-cut bacon & two eggs, which comes with hash browns (or country potatoes or fruit) and a biscuit.  The eggs were perfectly done. The hash browns had a bit of a buttery taste to them, which I'm not a fan of but it's nothing that would prevent me from getting them again.  The bacon had clearly been cooked and sitting for a while, but it was thick, crispy, and quite good nonetheless.  The biscuit is a bit of an oddball.  It's massive (about the size of 2-3 McDonalds biscuits) and looks more like a roll than a biscuit.  In fact, even the taste of it is somewhere between a roll and a biscuit, with a consistency similar to cornbread.  It was also room temperature, which is a big no-no.  I'll opt for the toast next time. 

The serving sizes were more than enough.  2 eggs felt like 3.  The potatoes were double the amount you would get at any other restaurant, the bacon slices were not only thicker than I've had at most places but very long, and the biscuit, as mentioned above, was huge.  For $7 it's quite a good deal.  They have even larger meals, some which come with three eggs and two biscuits for around $10.  Breakfast is served all day, by the way.

My server was attentive and service was actually too fast.  What I mean is instead of waiting 2 minutes for my food, I'd rather wait 5 if it meant I'd get fresh bacon and a warm biscuit.  Still, the amount of food you get for what you pay can't really be beat.  I think the owner or manager even made rounds saying hello to all the customers.  A nice touch.  On the strength of how good the breakfast and service was I'm likely to go back in the near future and sample some of their lunch/dinner fare again.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,1,4,UYs1ssfV36OocVdIFHZfPw

Everyone was friendly and smiling. Our server was attentive and polite. She helped us choose our order but didn't tell us when me and my husband both ordered biscuits and gravy that one order would end child hunger. No joke. One order was mammoth much less us having two! The biscuits were not like a traditional biscuit. It was more like a large dinner roll. They were definitely not house made. 
The eggs and bacon were okay and as many have said the pancakes were the best part. Sweet due to the cream they add but heavy. Not like an ihop or Cracker Barrel cake for sure. I would say it's worth a try.",nTFHW94an19CGFGeWCScBA,1,0,3,2Z3-WZKARwKpQ5GS35n1ZA

My girlfriends and I came here after a morning workout at the suggestion of our trainer.  The place is cutely decorated with stuffed bears all through out and a couple bear statutes before you even walk inside.  What I like about Black Bear is unlike Eggworks or Cracked Egg it wasn't as crowded and seating felt more comfortable and not as tight.  The menu had your basic breakfast items.  If you are trying to eat healthy they offer Fit and Focused Scrambles for under 500 calories,   And I don't know how healthy the 7-grain granola nut cakes are but they had an interesting nutty flavor to them and I like them better then regular pancakes.

3591828,2016-10-28,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I really enjoyed my meal at Black Bear Diner - I just had a chicken club sandwich and fries, but I thought their prices and their portion sizes were excellent and the food was very tasty. There's nothing super special about this diner, and there doesn't need to be. It just has good food at good prices in good (and probably too large) amounts. The service was pretty prompt and on top of anything we needed. 

My companion had a half sandwich and a chicken noodle soup combo. She didn't really like the soup as it had a bit of a sour flavor to it. I figure they add some kind of lemon or some veggies that add sourness but I wasn't sure why it was sour. However, her half sandwich was a good quantity and that combo was only seven dollars.

I didn't have enough room to try their dessert but I think I'll be back here when I'm in the mood for some diner food.

One thing that was a minus to me was the tables at the booths are tilted, as they are attached to the wall and sagging. It's not a huge problem but it is a tad awkward and it feels a bit run down because of that, and I didn't feel comfortable leaning on the table.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,0,0,4,b-Wqv9pL1wDLux2uzSVadw

The FF would have been awesome had they not over salted them with season salt .. I finished the FD since i had something to wet it down with!!
The husband ... Who normally cleans his plate, wasn't able to finish his turkey burger, the patty was super dry and very bland, the bun fell apart on the first bite, so he tried taking it apart to finish it but just couldn't get past the dull taste of turkey, his fries were just as bad as mine... Our server asked if there was something wrong with his meal since he barely ate 1/2 of it.. He mentioned it was too bland and dry, she actually agreed with him and offered something else, he declined but she insisted he take a free dessert  of his choice home to make up for his yucky dinner..

If your looking for fancy and chic Sunday brunch, this is NOT the spot. This is family, relaxed, down home, and comfort all the way! Hence, I tend to come more during the winter months. 

FOOD: 
Traditional American breakfast diner, I must say that this particular BB makes exceptional biscuits and gravy, so this is one of my must when I do stop by...
Other nice dishes are: corned beef hash, steak and eggs, as well as the traditional pancakes, bacon and sausage. I love their Acapulco omelet, I try to eat healthy for the most part and it's both healthy and delicious (egg whites, veggies, and avocado). I'm a big fan of their pancakes and waffles the batter reminds me of waffle house down South! 
Every single dish isn't a home run, but most everything I've tried is solid. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Staff is always friendly and welcoming, and of course attentive. I've never had an issue with a meal, and I love that they let you customize your meal more or less and LISTEN. I'm most impressed that even under busy and hectic days like Sundays they don't make you feel rushed.

Let's start off by saying the service was good, but the food wasn't so much. I had the Griz breakfast. Ordered it with the hash browns and got the country potatoes instead. Our waitress immediately had it corrected. However, both potatoes lacked flavor or seasoning.
The ham chunk was pretty salty, but then the bacon was ridiculously salty and the sausage was mushy texture, fatty and too much sage for my taste. The eggs ordered over medium were ok and more towards over easy, but that's ok. Oh, and then the pancakes. Well, I thought they were ok, but a bit sweet, but my wife thought they tasted too much like cake batter, and they kinda did, like sweet cream or cake batter ice cream. I'm sure that's the way they supposed to be, since they were sweet cream pancakes, but maybe a bit too rich. 
I'm a coffee snob and sold coffee commercially for many years, and I would just say their coffee was mediocre. For a place like this, they should have distinguishable coffee with a unique flavor note.
In the end, I wasn't able to choke down the sausage, bacon or too much of the ham and hash browns. Overall, just not that great as I was hoping for better.",awbUZngn1XiQUanQC7Yh-A,2,0,2,GVYViy0VNN9DiCYpvenZ8Q

They're famous for the cinammon rolls and they are the size of a human's head. So please believe you can lose your fork digging in that thing. Another thing that's homemade is their buttermilk biscuits and their fresh orange juice. 

I tried the tri tip scramble which was meaty and delish! I'm a meat lover, and so I had to have meat as part of my five food group. The portions are huge and the scramble definitely had flavor thanks to the tri tip and the onions.

Would love to know where they buy their oranges!  The place was tastefully decorated for the holidays while keeping their cabin theme. So so cute and cozy!  Their servers were fast and friendly.  Only downside is the waiting area on sunday. There isnt really one for a place that is clearly very popular.  Lots of us were standing and squeezing together before the receptionist in a tiny area that has a big jukebox, cabinet with cute black bears merhandise and newpaper stands and something else that was bulky (i cant remember).  I feared my husband would lose patience with the tight squeeze and leave.  There's a fridge display with lots of delicious looking  home made pies next to the receptionist. I would love to have browsed but then i'd be in the way of people walking thru to leave & to get to their tables.  i have to wonder how they can sell any if their merchandise when there is people standing in front of it blocking most of the view. 

But again, amazing food!  That is why there were so many people waiting in an uncomfortable space! It was worth the wait, which thankfully was not long at all for 2 people (10-15 mins?) We cant wait to go back, but i think we'll try a time that isn't busy.",UOwxo6NQaIN22VG2v1UKag,1,1,5,CJSiQH0m2KctZtCGXgGYcw

Have not been here for sometime since they stopped serving South of the Border Omelette. 
They serve Chorizo Scramble, but it's no where near as tasty & still leaves you craving chorizo.
Since they no longer serve South of the Border Omelette, I ordered a California Omelette & had them add Chorizo along with the Avocado & Jack Cheese. 
Of course it added $2 to the cost but was ok with me.
Food & Service was 5 stars but down rated  to 4+ stars due to cost about $11?

If you read the ""place mat"" BB credo states that if you prefer your meal different than shown in menu, to ask waiter & they would do their best to accommodate you.
This our waiter & cook did when I asked.
Waiter was very friendly and continuously checked on us.
We have always had great service here.

Omelette came out great & was really fantastic tasting!

Had Hash Browns which was great and very similar to years back. Sometime back, I believe they substituted russet for a while which was crumbly & not as tasty as ""new or red"" potato as used now.

The Menu appears to have really shrunk and not as interesting but I generally come for the breakfast & know what I want to order.

Sorry I took picture of my omelette after eating half. Couldn't wait to dig in after  smelling the aroma of and seeing the Chorizo Omelette.

It would be nice if they brought back the South of the Border Omelette & dump the Scramble.

They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat.

It immediately came across as a warm and happy environment.  I love when I can walk into a place and feel like the employees actual like where they work.  Service was superb as we were immediately seated, drinks never ran empty and the waitstaff constantly checked in with us without brooding or coming off as imposing.

I ordered the Joe's Hobo Omelette. Stuffed with a bunch of meat along with onion and spinach. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the omelette was so tasty. I ordered the red potatoes as a side, which weren't as crispy as I liked but still very good. I would definitely recommend trying this omelette. 

Finally, the best part, the pancakes. The other two people I ate with ordered the pancakes and couldn't shut up about them so I had to try. One sweet delicious bite led to about 15 more. They were hands down the best pancakes I've ever had. So thick and they melted in your mouth along with the syrup that tasted like it came straight from a log cabin. The pancakes are a must try!!

Charleston, but being in the heart of Las Vegas will do too.

Everything they make is HOMEMADE, not that artificial shit you see common in many of my other reviews.  I love homemade food because it's made with passion and ingredients that really give a true flavor.  Black Bear Dinner didn't miss the memo on that.  Although there wait times are extremely long and perhaps service could be better, the food killed it.

I had orange juice and I expected to be served Tropicana or Minute Maid equivalent orange juice and to my surprise it was actually fresh squeezed with REAL orange juice.  You just don't find that anywhere anymore!  My breakfast was French Toast with country smoked bacon.  Perfectly powdered with sugar and the bacon was nice a crisp and you could taste the smoke still from the grill...YUM!  My eggs were good too, the real deal.

I ordered the Shasta Scramble which came with avocados, spinach, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and Jack Cheese all served with a housemade biscuit. I can't remember the price, but I know it was under $10.

The three egg scramble was well scrambled and seasoned. I liked that they did not hold back on the avocado and vegetables, especially the spinach. The sprinkling of Jack Cheese was light, but just right, and the onions and peppers still had a slight crunchy appeal.

The potatoes were simple but effective. They were cooked well with a little browning on the outside and tender inside. They could of benefited from a little extra seasoning. The biscuit was okay. It was baked to mild density and was moist. However, it's flavor was a little bland, with its spotty areas of salt. I was glad they served the biscuit with soft whipped butter.

What makes this place special is the staff.  Hands down one of the best restaurant staffs in Vegas.  They all just seem to get it. The GM's name is Ray and he runs a great ship. I'm a very loyal customer and would tell everyone in vegas this is the place for breakfast. Come after 730 am, so you don't take my seat.",sXYqRSQaEQCzOD8kcnNJBw,0,0,5,Rw9jnPEJxfe9Y0PfU8GZKA
4014606,2008-06-12,2,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I went here for breakfast with the gf and the kids one Sunday.  I heard about this place from Yelp and wanted to check it out.  I like diner eating sometimes because it's a break from so many buffet type places here.  We should have got here earlier on a Sunday, because it was super busy!  Good sign that the food is good here.  We had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a booth but no biggie.  The decor was cool, apparently they're into Black Bears...ha ha...they were all over the place!

When we got sat at our booth, we were right next to this huge machine with oranges.  I had to ask, and our waiter said they squeeze fresh juice from oranges every day.  What a trip.  Too bad it was like more than $3 per glass, a bit pricey but I guess you pay for freshness.  Their menus were cool too, printed on old newspaper articles.  

Their menu was big, and we had tons of choices from the breakfast and lunch menus to choose from.  I love my breakfast, so I ended up choosing their 'Volcano' breakfast...it's their most popular.  I got three HUGE pancakes (As big as the plate...I opted for the 7-grain Almond ones for a buck more), 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausage links, and 2 thick pieces of bacon.  This plate was made for a king!  Wasn't bad for only 8 bucks and change either.  It was seriously one of the best breakfast dishes....ever.  Pancakes were moist and buttery, the links were snap fresh, the eggs were great, and the bacon was oh so yummylicious (nice thick strips).  This beats IHOP and Denny's any day.

Their burgers are humongous as well.  One of the kids had a Bob's Big Bear Burger, the Califoria Burger to be exact.  It's a 3/4 pound (big) burger and had avocado and jack cheese, as well as your standard fixin's of lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and pickle.  It was too big to put in your mouth!  We had to cut it in fourths just to dig in.  They give you a huge portion of fries too, crisp and delicious.  With some ketchup and ranch, these are pretty killer.  

I will be going to this place again when I get the craving for some great diner food.  People were nice and courteous, but also quick.  Good quality and value for the dollar.  I can't believe this place is a franchise!  Sure don't seem like it with the down home charm and the unique decor.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,3,4,-8RdktUpIPvUoUOxs90vWQ
4024965,2011-11-06,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"This is our fave ""neighborhood"" go-to.  We just moved to this side of town in September and a friend recommended them for breakfast.  Since then we have become regulars.  WARNING!  THIS IS A DINER... A DINER DECORATED WITH BEARS...STUFFED BEARS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK!  So if you are looking for a place that is super modern or Zen-Hipster whatever, then the BBD is not for you!!!

Some of my faves:
Southern Scramble- their homemade scrumptious sausage (spiced with fennel? sage? I'm not huge on sausage but this stuff is to die for) on top of their huge biscuit with scrambled eggs and country gravy on top.  You can pick hash browns or country potatoes (pick the country potatoes!!!)
Shasta Scramble-eggs scrambled with avocado, spinach, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers & jack cheese 
My husband thought the homemade corned beef hash & eggs were great! (The Bagel Cafe is his ruling stick and BBD's was a close 2nd in his opinion). 

THE BEST HAMBURGER!!!!
I have to say I have turned into a creature of habit (not of the stuffed bear variety) with their Burger Basket combo! I would choose their cheeseburger ANY day over In-n-Out, Create & 5 Guys!  EASY!  It comes with a huge portion of tasty fries which come out perfect every time I have been there. EVERY time and they taste even better when dipped into their Ranch dressing. For all you Ranch Dressing aficionados, BBD's Ranch is the real thing!!!!  I'm not sure what is going on in Vegas with Ranch dressing but most of the restaurants in town have bland, bottle-brand tasting weak-ass Ranch.  (My fave use to be Cheesecake Factory's Ranch which I use to buy to go and all Ranch is compared to theirs!)  For an extra charge (2.99?) you can order one of their hand-dipped shakes that comes with the extra in the old-fashioned tin cup-we tried the black berry...Once again, delicious!

My hubby has liked the T-bone, Tri-tip and the Prime Rib- he liked them all.  (He is not comparing them to any of the better steakhouses or anything but states they taste like the homemade Sunday dinner you use to get at your Grandma's).  

We also love their coffee and the service is always good!  Always! Expect a wait on weekend mornings.",tAcY4S3vIuNlAoRlCcz5VA,2,0,5,24_t7vCRBu72pRRxfHQ2jg

Everything from matchup to hot sauce says s Blackbear Diner! Server was attentive snapped a few pictures of us after we ordered and it came out the way we ordered it. So it was very nice. They made sure we had a good experience. Soup was hot and very creamy. His salad was cold and had greens and tomatoes, son said dressing tasted homemade.

4051135,2009-09-29,2,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"I will preface this by saying I am very critical of breakfast restaurants. Staff is very friendly and on point at all times. The look of the place is fun too stuffed bears fill a small shelf that trims the interior. Carved bears and cute chachki gifts for purchase. I am a firm believer that if you have a signature dish it should knock me over, or at least be something I will talk about. Black Bears trophy meal is Chicken Fried Steak (also one of my guilty pleasures). Firstly get the freakin orange slice, parsley and plastic portion cups off my plate (All these things just say Denny's,IHOP). Eggs were cooked right, Hash Browns were good, Chicken fried steak was just OK. It is panko crusted gravy was not very flavorfull and I got a lump of flour or whatever they thickened it with. For me to not finish a Chicken Fried steak is a big deal. The other diner had a Choriso,Green Chili, and Cheese Omlette. My first bite was a sinuey grissel and cheese that was spicey. Not the best Choriso I have had. The Coffee here is so weak that I didn't even finish one cup. I ordered milk when it came the plastic cup smelled like dish cleaner and was still wet? This place is driven by an older crowd and that explains the weak coffee and bland food. Not the mediocre choriso though. This is also a chain so the recipes are not changing, and from the 20 min. wait to get in why would they. This is more from the lack of enough Rock Star breakfast spots, than a salute to the quality of Black Bear itself. As of yet Hash House A Go Go and some select casino spots are still holding the top spot by a large margin.  I am gonna give them 3 stars this is driven by the ambiance and service.",zn2jJvhshrv0jAP3Kiy_HA,2,2,3,YHFiBuyzW6v7BwrwD0G73w

From the chainsaw carved statues outside to the teddy bears lining the walls, there is even a little carved bear near the register you can have a ""Kodiak"" moment with. 

I had the meal tittled ""The Grizz"" and for 9.99 it was a sweet deal of two sausages, two strips of bacon, three eggs, a piece of ham, choice of potatoes and two pancakes. While the meat was good and the pancakes were really fluffy, the potatoes were a little bland. A couple shakes of the salt and a squirt of ketchup took care of that. The coffee was also very rich and I loved that the table came stocked with flavored creamers. 

I wish this place was a little closer to home because I'd be here every week. There are so few decent places for breakfast in this town and this place just rocks.

The line cooks don't know scrambled eggs from an omelette. Burned/overcooked and no curds.... I got Mexican resort fold-over eggs instead of scrambled.

Boring chicken fried steak patty. Bacon was gamey.

Pancakes  were too sweet. Didn't need any syrup. Kids will love this part!

The service was decent even though it took a half hour plus to get mediocre line-cooked short order items. Probably the last time I visit a BBD.

The thick-cut hash browns were okay and are the extra star in this review.

Cut our losses short by letting the waitress know our displeasure in the meal and not sending the food back.

Bill came to $33 for 2 adult and 1 child's breakfast, not including $6 tip. A bit expensive when there are plenty of other more popular options.",EHN2fcdsWLMsGbCVS3lZ3Q,1,0,2,VuRXjM9-g-JfoIt_CESl3w

The service is amazing and consistent, everyone is always so friendly if just a couple of us, or the whole fam. The food is awesome, the menu is everything you would expect from an old school diner, simple food cooked by someone cares. The burgers are always great, the sandwiches are as well. The breakfast is damn near perfect, I don't think my kids have ever even tried anything else due to this, and we usually eat here at dinner time! 
I usually try different things when I eat here and have recently found my hands down favorite, the Blazin Bear! Pulled pork with their special spicy sauce that I had a hard time believing wasn't candy, it was just so good! I grabbed the waiter after my second bite to tell him it was amazing. He was grinning from ear and was almost excited telling me it was his favorite thing on the menu. Even the cole slaw on it tasted great....and I detest cole slaw!
They also have great dessert, the pies are all pretty tasty. The coffee is pretty good, too. Kids eat free on Teddy Bear Tuesdays, our kids even brought in Teddy bears the first time we went on that day and they are still up on the shelf after the years.

4147700,2012-08-27,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"The first time I saw a Black Bear Diner was in Yreka, CA. I did not get the chance to stop and was kind of upset. So I was excited to find one right here in Las Vegas. Last fall I tried it for the first time. It was busy and I figured that was a good sign. Service then was alright as was the food. Nothing spectacular. I don't really remember what I even ordered. The place did leave enough of an impression on me to sign up for their email club. I get periodic offers from them though I never take advantage of these offers. Black Bear is not in my area of town. Today, however, I was in the neighborhood and feeling like lunch time was upon me. So my roommate and I stopped in. We were taken to the seating area quickly though our table was not cleared yet. We waited while they cleaned. Our drink order was taken right away and by I think three people. All very friendly. It took several minutes to look through the menu and our server had to come back a couple of times. I almost ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. I went with the tri-tip dip with potato salad. My roommate ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Our food took a little while to come out. No matter though, it was busy after all. Both my roommate and I thought the same thing about our side. It was kind of bland. Neither of us finished our side. My sandwich seemed very familiar. I think it was I ordered during my first visit. It was not overly memorable this time either. The au jus seemed watered down. The beef was mostly tender. The Swiss cheese was great as were the mushrooms. The onions were supposed to be sauted but they were still mosly raw. I don't like raw onion so I picked most of them off. Nevertheless, it was filling. That is a bonus. As for the service after the food arived, it was lacking. I had my empty glass of tea on the edge of the table and was walked passed by our server several times. My refill came after my meal was finished and my plate was gone. I don't think I'll be back any time soon. It has been almost a year between visits and I imagine it will be at least another year before the next. I think I would like to try their breakfast sometime. Corned beef hash is still on my radar. Only time will tell.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,1,3,wMi4rmQ9vD2I4ydc3SgAbA

My wife and I visited here the first time today for breakfast and we'd decided to share the grizz before even getting there. Upon arrival it seemed pretty busy in the parking lot and when we walked in it didn't feel comfortable. As an African couple the first thing we noticed was the patrons were all Caucasian, not an issue but we wanted to give it the benefit of doubt since the reviews were favorable. We were immediately greeted and sat at a booth where a waitress took our drink order and told us our waitress would be there in a few. Since we already knew what we wanted there was no need to look at the menu. About 7 minutes later our waitress named Candy arrives after tending to a few other tables and asked for our order in a very dry and forced tone. I didn't get a friendly or good service vibe by the tone of her voice, more of a ""you were sat here and I have to wait on you"" vibe. As a former waiter I've worked with people like her and know how the game goes. We ordered the grizz and just sat and observed how Candy treated all of her surrounding tables, she was friendly and gave casual conversation. Until she brought out our food was the next time she came to us. No type of check in like ""your food is coming soon"" ""how's everything tasting"" NOTHING!! We asked for a second syrup and she said ok 5 mins later I had to flag her down for it and it was obviously she forgot or ignored it bc she didn't apologize for not bringing it the first time. All in all we didn't feel welcome at black bear by Candy and it felt like we weren't deserving of the service she gave her other tables. Maybe because no other guest there had our skin color is the only reason I can think of. Customer service is top priority in the restaurant industry and we did not receive that at black bear. We will never return or recommend.",Xd4juaFMOJf3UP-W97pm5Q,0,0,2,yZVQ8PanrW4WP9iWyl3WHw

I had to put 3 creams and 5 packets of sugar and it was still too strong and it was only an 8 ounce cup.

To elaborate - great place to eat. It's at Tropicana and Jones in the Smith's shopping center. It's pretty low key so you might miss it, but look for the carved bears standing outside the door. Speaking of bears:. this place is ALL ABOUT BEARS. They have stuffed bears on the walls, carved bears, bear murals on the walls...they love them some bears. It's pretty cute, actually. I love the poker bears on the back wall - they're awesome.

Service is pretty good - I've had good and bad service here, so it really just depends on the server. Food comes quickly though, so that's a big plus. They're not open 24 hours, unfortunately. I think their hours run from 6AM to 9:45PM though so you have a pretty good time window to get in here and get stuffed.

As for the food - HELL TO THE YEAH. It's classic American diner fare - chicken fried steak, meatloaf, sandwiches...you name it. My first time here I had the large chicken fried steak. It covered the platter. They don't have dinner plates - they have platters. HUGE. They load them up with food, too. Come hungry. I don't like meatloaf at all - I can eat theirs. It's that good. If you order coffee they'll actually bring you flavored creamer to go with it. For the record, their blackberry cobbler is fantastic.

All in all, this is a great place to eat. The prices are low, the service is pretty good, and the food is fantastic. Eat here.",glYwn0bUfowzSEujf4Tmcg,3,2,4,m9Pbjem3oGNIvETLyFuJ-w

So we decided to arrive early around 530 pm to avoid the rush.   When we got there the restaurant had plenty of seats and no wait which made us very happy. 5 stars

The cup of chicken noodle I ordered was awful and tasted like it came from a can.  1 star

The chicken and waffle was misleading since it was chicken tender and waffle,  but that didn't matter because the waffle was delicious. Although the tender was dry and hard versus juicy and crispy like it should be. 3 stars

Chicken Biscuit and gravy presentation was a fail,  but it tasted good so that was a win.   We decided a more suitable name would be upside down chicken pot pie. 3 stars

The kids portion were enormous, that's about it.  Nothing great. 3 stars

It's a restaurant chain with ok food but it wasn't anything amazing about it when you compare it to the other big names like Dennys or IHOP. I can see us visiting this place maybe once a year...maybe.

The biscuit minus gravy was a bit dry.  Even butter wasn't enough to moisten it.  Gravy is the only solution.  The homemade corned beef has was meh.  It was just shredded corned beef brisket with some potatoes.  They need to grill the hash so it's has more crisp.  The hash browns are also a bit soggy.  A small amount of crisp, but not enough to want to finish the hash browns.  The sweet cream pancakes were very sweet.  Tasted like angel food cake batter was used to make the pancakes.   I didn't realize this place was a chain.  I thought it was a local mom and pop shop.  Now I realize the CFS was something special that got me to come back, but the bacon being like jerky is something that would make me not come back.

4371817,2011-04-04,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"First time going here tonight with the family. We decided to go since none of the ""usual"" choices was working out. Thankfully it was really close to where we live. 

The service, at least to me, is quite good. There was some waiting to do but not horrible. For drinks: mom, lil' bro, and I ordered the OJ. Mom's bf ordered coke lol. I'm an OJ-type of girl. I even ask my grandma to buy bag-fulls of oranges just to freshly squeeze them for me in the morning. I have to say, their OJ was yummy--didn't have too much pulp but you can tell they're not store-bought. 

I ordered the Bear Paw Chicken-Fried Steak alongside red-skinned mashed potatoes, corn bread muffin and lots of heavenly gravy. I also ordered a side of their famous Sweet Cream pancakes (short stack).  Mom ordered the T-Bone steak with baked potato and their muffin as well. Bro ordered their Gardenstyle Veggie burger with Jack cheese and fries on the side. Mom's bf ordered the BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and eggs. He got it with hash browns, but instead of the biscuits he opted for the pancakes. 

My chicken noodle soup and mom's salad came first. Soup was okay; not salty and the serving size was just right (since the main dishes were HUGE). We waited a little bit for our orders but I wasn't complaining at all, since I'd usually be getting antsy after 10-15 minutes of waiting. I got my pancakes first, slobbered butter all over and pretty much drenched them in syrup (yum!) Short stack comes with two pancakes the size of regular dinner plates at my house, my mom was surprised at how their ""short stack"" was too big of an order. The top pancake was a little burnt, so that's a bit of a downside, but the bottom one was the most perfect pancake I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. I've been searching for a good breakfast place and I think I've found it in Black Bear! As I was still waiting for my main order, I took a bite off of my brother's veggie burger. The texture of the patty told my taste buds it ain't real meat, but the taste definitely passed the test. Their fries were also pretty good, I actually ate a lot of it (sorry bro!) My mom also gave me a piece of her steak; now, I'm not much of a steak person when I'm not craving it, but that piece of meat was juicy and flavorful. My chicken-fried steak finally came, and the first bite was enough for me to rave about this place. I've had ""country-fried"" or ""chicken-fried"" steak from other places, namely casinos, and they all were too salty or too dry/hard or just plain yucky! I didn't even used a knife to cut it, and when I put it in my mouth it just melted. It was crunchy and creamy and all sorts of heavenly goodness in one bite! The side of mashed potatoes were also quite awesome, I like how they used red potatoes--best kind for mashed. The veggies tasted good too; a little greasy at times but hey, that's what diner food is all about. 

We couldn't go for dessert, everyone was just too full and in food heaven by the time we were done. Gave our server $10 tip since she was attentive the whole time. Definitely going back next time I'm craving breakfast food :D",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,8,4,5,XQwa62VMkSL3WMzSkkb_Og

We had the chicken fried steak (normal sized), which was covered in a reasonable white gravy.  Not the best I have ever had, but wasn't too bad either. Not overly greasy, and still had good crunch on the crust.

Also had the burger with nacho cheese and tortilla strips.  I know, disgusting.  But we were hung over and it actually tasted pretty good.  Burger was hand pressed and not overly dry, and the cheese and tortillas provided a great creamy/crunchy texture contrast.",eXEe37RaENFfSCh5lg_rQw,0,0,3,hj9CEZbS7BPFX12x7We17Q

First of all, there is bear-ly anything in this restaurant that isn't bear themed (so many puns everywhere) making it really fun for kids. It's out on Tropicana ave so you see the mountains as you drive up. You may have to wait a few minutes (11:30 am Sunday we waited 10 minutes) but it is worth it. 
Food: 5/5. We tried the regular and the pineapple upside down pancakes(highly recommend), both were amazing and fluffy- the biscuit with gravy is so huge its the size of a dinner plate. Everything tasted top notch. There are really cool and creative menu options and we were sad that we didn't have time to come back for dinner. (we had plate envy of the nearby tables too). They have these mini pies, like the size of a cereal bowl, which are heavenly and can feed a group of 4.
Price: 5/5. SO CHEAP compared to what you get on the strip or around Freemont. Portions are monstrous, our milkshake was more like three. You can eat breakfast for 9-15$ a person, but one combo easily feeds 2.",bSdj6dg3PaKxS9viXcgZLA,0,0,5,XrbVpJKrT2qOcYAVHqonJA

4451971,2013-01-18,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Second go-round at Black Bear Diner involved my husband and his cousin along with her boyfriend. The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.

The restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.

I was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99

My order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty. 

The only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!

I'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,4,1orm2X4RXTZIlIrYMo9k-Q

This place is a locals classic. They build their restaurants to be reminiscent of  ""when life was a little more simple, and service and quality were the cornerstones of business."" Its a great motto and they execute it very well. I have been driving past this place since I was 15 years old and it was ALWAYS busy. I felt, it was time to finally take the plunge and get in on the buzz. Boy am I sure glad we did!

The server was very polite even though she was extremely busy. She brought us coffee right away and took our order as soon as we decided. The one thing that I LOVE in my coffee is Splenda, which they(like so many other restaurants) didn't have. Not a huge deal, but i just hate sweet-and-low, and equal.. Yuckkk! Coffee was good though. Woke us right up! My son accidentally spilled his chocolate milk all over the table and our server was over at our table, super fast, with plenty of napkins to help. 

I ordered the ""Volcano"" which came with ""Sweet Cream Pancakes""(Which were excellent), Sausage links(fantastic! Tasted like homemade sausage), and crispy, delicious Bacon.

The place was hopping on Sunday morning with hungover twenty-somethings, families with young kids and elderly lovebirds just getting out from the Methodist church. It was loud, a little too loud for my hungover head.

Servers were oddly hipster for this type of a restaurant but hey, they were interesting to look at (more interesting than the 1000 different types of stuffed bears crammed into every visible space). 

I ordered the chicken fried steak, my friend ordered the veggie omelet. Both plates were MASSIVE and neither one of us was able to finish. The chicken fried steak was so crunchy and toothsome and seasoned perfectly, I'm dying just thinking about the little piece I left on my plate. The seasoned red potatoes were nice, too. I also noticed that their bread is thick-sliced and looked delicious, but alas, I was too full to touch them.

Prices are ok, $6-$10 for a plate of breakfast, but keep in mind how much you're getting! I wish the noise level was significantly lower, but in a big open room it's hard to control the volume of a crowd. If you're in Vegas, check out Black Bear Diner on Tropicana.

Located only 3.2 miles from the strip, I was very pleased to find this place. When you first walk in, the hospitality is amazing. We were greeted and seated almost immediately. Go early, the line gets long. Cindi was our waitress. Southern hospitality at its best. Coffee was strong but with great flavor. Fresh squeezed OJ!!!
Now for the food.....
I ordered the sausage scramble. 1 giant biscuit topped with 2 large, homemade pieces of sausage, scrambled eggs and covered in gravy. This came with a side of hash browns that was huge! The plate was filled to the max, all portions are twice as big as they should be. Come hungry, or plan to take left overs. I had trouble finishing the meal, but I made it through.

We went the next day because of the service and food. I ordered the corn beef and hash. Home made corn beef and hash, so good. Nothing canned at this diner. Again with the OJ and coffee. You won't have to eat lunch after a breakfast here.

It was a great touch to their perfectly seasoned fries. My girlfriend ordered the Ribeye Steak Medium Rare. Sooo good!! 

My only gripe is the Jim Carrey looking guy who helped ring us up. Before I finished paying, he was asking the waitress if the previous group had left a tip.

I pride myself on trying to support local business before resorting to chains but I feel it my civic duty to let the good folks that support this local establishment know that Blackbear Diner may perhaps be doing you a disservice.  I have a rating system that I only share in detail to those closest to my heart.  By such system this place is barely better than McDonald's. In terms of taste, this place easily has the edge over McDonald's.  It also has the advantage in terms of customer service, but no surprise there. 

BTW Support Local Business, you'll still find individuals who care about how you feel about their business.  

Ok, back to my review.  I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast & side of Bacon.  I could just imagine those cinnamon rolls piping hot & crunchy slathered in butter, dripping with warm dark maple syrup.  What I got was room temperature,  soggy, fried cinnamon bread.  Imagine my disappointment when my little dream came crashing down into a sad, soggy reality.  I'm sure for most people the fact that these folks here are the crème de la crème of hospitality & service should make up for bad food.  I am here to enjoy my meal.  The staff did their job.  I certainly enjoyed the warm family type atmosphere!  Where this place fell flat for me, is the food.  So half of my experience was missing.  No matter who you are or where you are in life you know that if half of anything is missing it's incomplete.   What was an incomplete in school boys & girls? An F.

Pancakes and Eggs Benedict were delicious! The desert looked very appetizing, however the breakfast was so large, I had no room left. Nonetheless I look forward to trying it when I return again. 

They have several credo's they try to follow. If you need changes they're willing to accommodate if possible. I did need changes to the potatoes, they didn't get it exactly right, however I'm sure if I am more clear of my needs in the future, they'll do everything they can to make it right. 

Also a small add, however very welcomed, is that they have flavored creamer for the coffee. Always a pleasant surprise!

As for the eggs, they were scrambled, and delicious as everything else. The service was pristine, as the workers are very nice and easy to talk to.

I ordered take out and the breakfast was called ""The Grizz"" which included two pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs and hash browns which where all pretty decent tasting.  My issue here was with customer service.  Amelia who took my order was very rude and had her back turned towards me after asking what I had ordered, after waiting for about 5 minutes another staff member asked if I had been helped, I appreciated her concern as she made sure the meal was coming out and I let her know I was ready to pay.

4655514,2013-06-28,8,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.  

 Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.

Credo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.

A Yelper's growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.

Credo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.

A Yelper's growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear's Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.

Credo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.

A Yelper's growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear's Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.

Credo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don't be afraid to take leftovers home!

A Yelper's growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up. 


Credo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.

A Yelper's growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level. 

Credo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.

A Yelper's growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.

4662508,2011-07-25,1,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Wow! Great breakfast and a laid back atmosphere. 

When I walked in, the first impression I had was of a small town diner where you see the old men sitting around, telling each other stories over coffee: inviting and comfortable.

The menu is interesting. Setup in the style of a 1940's newspaper, the vast menu covers all areas of down-home cooking.

I had the Country Fried Steak and eggs with country potatoes. Steak was great and the cream gravy really pleased. Eggs were ok. The wife got the California Omelet and really enjoyed it. Fresh veggies and huge chunks of avocado. The kid ordered the child's chocolate-chip pancakes with powdered sugar. Pretty sure there was more chip then cake, which pleased to no end.

You know how bacon can be overcooked to the point that it just disintegrates in your mouth?  That's what I had.  The sausage was overcooked as well.  I did like the pancakes, the eggs, and the ham.  Based on that and the decent service is the only reason this isn't a 1 star review.  Overally Blackbear is 0 for two.

Free coffee and bear claw if you sign up to be a bear member.  If i knew it wasnt being honores i wouldnt have ordered the freebie. Cashier guy said you needed a coupon and will receive it via email within 48 hrs. We were very unaware. There was a miscommunication between management, server and us. As far as I know, I was going based on yelp offer. Server said it's ok and we'll be taken care of at the front. Usually when yelp has offers its smooth however this is my first encounter having a problem. 
Told cashier no problem I'll pay for it. All I'm saying is they shouldn't put up offers if they don't know how to honor it.

The serving was huge and the fried chicken was juicy and crispy but way too salty. The brown gravy was salty as well. It seemed the only thing not salted on the plate was the green beans, which were canned. The chicken fried steak was incredibly bland. The breading and the gravy was so bland that even with some salt, it didn't help. Overall, the place was nice because their service was nice.

This place looks country and has a very ""homey"" feel. It was cute- I felt like I was home.  My friends and I ordered breakfast, but they do have lunch and dinner. 

We had eggs, bacon, pancakes, potatoes, and coffee. The food came out faster than expected, and was hot. More importantly, it looked like everything was fresh and homemade ( the eggs looked like real eggs, and the hash browns looked like they cut their own potatoes). It was good, but it tastes like something I could make at home. The ""sweet cream"" pancakes were too cakey for our liking, but the flavor was there.  The hash browns had good flavor, but they needed a tad bit more cooking. The bacon tasted great. 

They do have a wide selection of pies ( i LOVE pies). I didn't try any, but it all looked so delicious. 

I would come back to try more things on the menu in order to have a better idea on how I really feel about this place.",NYqp6yjtWnwh_VDANzNU2w,1,0,3,6GwV0-3rc7QGy5zITg-oew

My family and I went to Black Bear Diner off the strip for breakfast the second day of our vacation and it was great.  Southern country ambiance inside, the servers were friendly and the menu immense!
Our party of six ordered a wide variety of items from Cinnamon roll french toast (which was sinfully awesome), to breakfast burritos.  I ordered the country scramble which was biscuits, eggs, sausage, and gravy with potatoes on the side.  Everybody seemed very happy with their selections.

The only thing preventing this review from being 5 stars for me was that I was not a fan of the sausage that came with my breakfast.  It was a large, thick patty that just didn't have the flavor or sear I like in a sausage patty.

4723760,2016-06-04,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Perfect back-home comfort food at its best!

This place was a regular eatery for my parents and I back in 2007 but we stopped going for a while.  That while became a happy return for my fiancée and I recently where the food is still top notch!  Portions can often be big so it's best to ask the servers just how big the size of the plate of food is.  Biscuits and gravy are not just served on a small saucer, they're served on an elipse sized platter covered in gravy!  You WILL need to share some of these platters between two people!

Recently I had one of the most delicious sandwiches EVER!  The Gobbler, not to be confused by the Gobbler served at Farm Basket, is sliced roast turkey, avocado, mayo, tomato, and cranberry sauce on toast.  Oh my God! Was that a tasty sandwich!  I think it was almost as good as the Bobbie from Capriotti's!  It's really like having Thanksgiving on a sandwich!

Really attentive servers that always come around to bring you fresh beverages and they are quite knowledgeable with what comes with each platter so you don't get the whole ""I'll have to check the kitchen for you..."" or ""I'm not sure...I can ask for you...""

I'm looking forward to going back more and more to Black Bear Diner as it's definitely the place to go for comfort food favorites!

The only thing I wish, is that they were open 24/7.  The diner reminds me a lot of a diner my family and I used to frequent back east in Wilmington, Delaware called The Golden Castle.  The restaurant really seems perfect for 24/7 business!",m8d1HYOCF8WCfO3AuwiJSw,1,1,5,-Mhi6CAsuVBJsArlKA9c7Q

Well, we have a Love-Hate relationship in this place.
Location is convenient. Easy drive on the way home after work. Plenty of parking spot! 
We are only eating breakfast here, so I don't know how their other food items. (We ate dinner once in Reno! It was horrible!) Anyway, we had really bad and really good experiences in this location at breakfast time! It depends who is the cook, food can be very good or very mediocre!
I would never eat their Steak and eggs! Somehow they can not make it right. Eventually they are taking it off from the bill, trying to makeup for the mistake. My point is that I don't want free food! I would like to eat a good meal after working 12 hours in my job! We told them that, so we were getting somewhat better food lately. I found the Classic Eggs Benedict very tasty.

The hostess told us approximately 25 min wait and she crossed off our name by accident after I inquired 22 minutes and haven't heard her call and people behind us already sat down. So I'm kinda annoyed at this point and hope the rest of the experience would be good to make up for it. We get sat and did get drinks fairly quickly. We ordered 2 kids meals (burger, chicken fingers, fries) and 2 Eggs Benedict (Huevos Rancheros, California Bacon Avocado). The food took a long time (35 minutes). The waitress was not very attentive. She did not check on us or let us know food was almost done. After food came out she did not ask if we needed anything like tobasco or anything. The food was fairly good. The poached eggs were cooked correctly. It was nice it came with a little bowl of fresh fruit and choice of hash browns or homestyle. The waitress did not check if the food was okay. When we were done she asked if we wanted anything else. I saw on the menu earlier the kids meals came with a sundae. So I had to remind her about it. She was like oh yeah it does. I think if I didn't know she would have pretended not to know so she wouldn't have to bring it. The fresh squeezed OJ was cheap quality and tasted like it was diluted and sugar was added. They charge $5 per glass. Skip it. Sad to say but I will not be returning to this diner as the food and decor/atmosphere was not bad.

Black Bear Burger
8 inch daimeter  sesame bun
7 inch diameter beef patty & 0.8 in thick  (medium rare recommended)
Fries, approximately half a pound, similar to 2.5 servings of In N Out Fries
1 Glass of water

The burger was ginormous, thick, juicy and prepared just the way I envisioned. They do not lie with their portions and motto of serving ""Heary portions for reasonable prices"" (or something like that).  The ambiance was pretty much a ""cabin"" type environment, with stuffed, wooden and toy bears all over the place. It felt warm, and the staff provided excellent service. It was like going to a Denny's in the middle of the forest without the creepiness. For my portion, it was just about $10.

I cook for a living, we server burgers as well at my work, don't give me that BS. Anyways she really didn't try to fix the situation.

had a meeting this morning at work and usually a few of us follow up with breakfast at jamm's. i didnt feel like waiting for a table so i suggested black bear diner. my friend had eaten here several times with her dad and i only heard great things about it so i wanted to give it a try. one of my co workers had eaten here before and said it was good so we all agreed to grub here.

parking was easy! unlike jamm's. i'm lazy.. i always want VIP parking.lol.. it was nice to have more spaces available.

i had the portugese linguica sausage breakfast! (pics in the profile!) it was deeeeelicious. my co workers were staring at my food when it came and while i was eating. yeaaaaa i saw you!! lol. the portions are hearty and i was hungry so it was perfect. hash browns were thick and chunky and crispy and scrumptious! toast was thick and buttered just right i didnt need to ask for more. and the OJ!!! it was 3.69 for a glass... a little pricey? but im pretty sure it was fresh squeezed and worth EVERY penny. 

my friend got the cali omelette. dont know what was in it but i saw avocado and she ate it all so i know it must have been great.

services was excellent. we were checked on several times and drinks were refilled promptly. when my co worker asked for ranch the server remembered to bring it with her food. usually i have to ask again after i get the food but she was on the money.

Not only that, she was attentive and very fast to getting plates in the back. She's a friendly fireball! 

Let's get down to the food, my husband and kids loved their food. My Mom and I both had a room temp plate. Maybe it was just sitting in the back too long while my husband and kids food was being made.

I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and when it came, it was so DELICIOUS I didn't even realize that it had come with eggs! The steak was so good that the eggs were basically like extra credit. On top of that- I asked my friends ""who's 2 gargantuan biscuits are these?* They all said ""uhh yours bro."" 

The supervisor at the time was Marlene and she politely asked if we enjoyed our dinner, to which we replied with ""yes, it was lovely."" Safe to say we have a new favorite place to eat.

5051619,2013-03-04,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"We had a failed attempt at going to brunch elsewhere so I popped on my app to figure out some of my bookmarks. It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe. 

The BF and I shared: 

Chicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be. 

Fajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again. 

Your breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.

You get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy. 

Sidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette. 

Service was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most ""mom and pops"" don't make their own sausages or potatoes. 

We took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky. 

Even with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,1,4,CJ3zdiCA_P10bbS1KR0WBA

Coffee was GREAT
Service was as expected for a breakfast place. She was around when needed, checked back, provided refills, was friendly. Certainly no complaints with the service.

Decor was fine and typical for the theme they were going for (lodge/bear type feel)

I ordered chicken fried steak which came with 2 eggs, and hasbrowns and my coffee which came to $10.00

Chicken fried steak was good but not great (Blueberry hill has the best country fried steak), the gravy was good, hasbrowns were good. 

Their biscuit was huge and only had a tiny bite and didn't care for it, 

I was disappointed though for $10 for breakfast especially here in vegas, all breakfasts should come with bacon or sausage and pancakes.  A side of any of this was at minimum $3  Their portions were huge but remember, bigger portions doesn't mean it's a better breakfst.  I've had smaller portions at dennys but for the same money I got more food because I got a main item, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon AND sausage AND pancakes AND coffee for UNDER $10


So on that little point, they can't compete with other places.

Overall food was alright, not great, certainly not bad by any means. I would go back, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there specifically though.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,1,3,nw-PiU26sKAqwh1wPXHWKw

I'll start out by saying I will be back to give it another try in the future. A buddy of mine met up with me here for dinner a few nights ago and we were both in the mood for breakfast (+1 for ALL DAY BREAKFAST!)
I had to laugh as we didn't realize that the small newspaper that was put on the table actually was the menu! The waitress came to take our order and we asked for menus. She looked at us kind of funny and laughed. Honest mistake! lol
Anyway, my food was decent. I ordered the Volcano (pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage) and my buddy ordered some dish with eggs, home potatoes, Portuguese sausage and a biscuit. His food came out warm at best and his potatoes seemed a bit overcooked and lacking flavor. My pancakes were good, eggs were eggs, the sausage was eh and the bacon was terribly overcooked and dry.
The decor is fun, cheesy and could possibly be a bit frightening if you are not a fan of bears or stuffed animals.
All in all, not a horrible experience and seeing as it serves breakfast all day and it's right around the corner I will probably be here more than a few times. Hopefully other menu items are better and I'll update my review from there.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,1,3,OX09q8UlVCnPx7eHFqzt3Q

I'm like an overgrown she-child, so this place should have been paradise for me.  Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.

It took us ten minutes to be seated.  The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess (I guess), so she left to find someone to seat us.  We waited FOR-E-VER for someone to finally show us to a table.  Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order.  I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start.  It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup.  For my meal, I ordered pot roast.  Over 50% of it was fat.  The sides were pretty nasty as well... a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables.  My fiancé's turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form.

anyhow, this place looks like it came out of some ski/snow resort up in tahoe. awesome and pretty at the same time. i think their theme is ""goldie locks and the three bears"". they had a lot of wooden bear statues - perfect for photo opportunities. did you know that black bears can practically run up trees? crazy.

the yelp reviews raved about the pancakes. unfortunately, i'm not a pancake fan. maybe i just haven't had any decent ones growing up. so we all stuck mostly to the typical breakfast food - omelets. i mean, if you mess up eggs, you're not really much of a diner. i got the california omelet and boy these yelpers sure weren't kidding about the portions. it was LOADED with avocado and mushrooms, inside AND on top. i've been trying to avoid those buffets in vegas because of the quantity - this was equally as bad. 

the actual omelet lacked flavor, so i had to play with the salt a bit. the amount of avocado, bacon, and mushrooms made up for it. the biscuit, though large and house made, was rather flavorless without the butter + honey. the only constant that you can't go wrong with are the potatoes. i chose the red potatoes over the hash brown because it had a little bit of green - bell peppers.

It does get a little busy for breakfast, so I would recommend coming early.  For lunch and dinner, I've never had to wait very long.",D5SRmkUhF_fHLBhdY-Tyhg,0,0,5,V8Q4LW6HfBd_xOXopvpPfg

It was sooooo good well seasoned both potatoes and sausage. They give you more than enough too! Babe got the sweet cream pancakes and bacon. They were so fluffy melt in your mouth even before the syrup. Most definitely going to have to try this place again.,_jlnfcSbOUk_BWE3fSxGTA,0,0,4,d6qkEAHHLzkFnqXNZACuqA

First off from the outside you would never think anything of this place...if you were just driving by it looks like a plain diner...BUT the minute you walk inside it has a warm woodsy homey type of feel! The decor is bear and woods themed! It's so adorable! It was very busy which is always a good sign! We were greeted very warmly when we checked in. The wait was only about 15 minutes.

We were seated by the manager Don who started the experience so positively! We had some friendly chit chat and he really does a fantastic job and making you feel VERY welcome!!

We were served by Anthony who did a fantastic job with our whole dining experience!! Also just so genuinely friendly!!

Now most importantly...the food. Let me just say breakfast is my absolute favorite and this place will NOT disappoint!! Everything about what everyone ordered was so on point and flippin' DELICIOUS!!! I had the Bear's Choice, in which I chose 2 scrambled eggs, 1 sweet cream waffle extra cripsy, bacon, and a side order of hash browns. Lawwwwwwwd have mercy it was the BEST tasting batter I have EVER eaten EVERRRR!! My hats off to the chefs in the back who our entire meal beyond perfect!! 

I am so grateful I got a chance to eat here and I am so excited to eat there again!!!(Probably go back later today and tomorrow...lol) I told my friends if I could give a restaurant a hug they would totally get one from me!!

If you are in Las Vegas I HIGHLY recommend trying Black Bear Diner !!! If you love breakfast GO THERE!!!",Y6Yp8iwAy6vpz36NIE0KmQ,1,0,5,mEHB88DkYIkxnMopJb03tw
5269617,2016-12-30,2,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Well I was all psyched up to come here from out of town and come to this place since it was one of the highest rated breakfast joints to go to in Vegas.  

Things got off to a rough start when we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated on a Monday morning, however I'll take in consideration it was a holiday weekend that was just finishing up. When we finally got seated, it took the waitress almost 20 minutes to take our order. Before that, she had apologized profusely to let us know that they were short-staffed and that there were six other people ahead of us before she would even be able to take our order. About another 40 minutes later, we finally got our breakfast and my order was messed up. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage I instead got bacon,  I didn't bother letting the waitress know because it would have probably taken another 20 minutes to get some sausage. My husband had ordered white toast and it wasn't until we got our order that we were told they ran out of white toast.  seriously who runs out of white toast for friggin breakfast time? 

 overall id say the food was average. I couldn't really say it was fantastic because we waited so long to eat. There was a couple who sat near us and by the time they got their food their eggs were cold and they got up and just left the Good! Which is crazy to me  because we were all waiting so long to eat anyway.",UR0BtHwg_OFLw3Ll9c8RWA,1,1,2,TzkXeF2nqgcR5A9WlnAM3A

My friend has the opportunity to eat here for lunch with a few friends from her job and apparently enjoyed her lunch. Came over that night and told me I have to give this place a try.

Unbeknownst to me a regional chain with over sixty locations throughout California and parts east an early morning stop at Black Bear Diner was prompted not only by a convenient location and inviting menu, but also by the promise of a 'dinner and a show' - in this case the traveling ""Chainsaws for Change"" crew cleaving blocks of wood into all sorts of shapes while I partook in a four part breakfast...plus a couple items to go.  Kitsch in décor with a pervasive log cabin theme speckled by bears both stuffed and carved it was to the tunes of the Four Tops that I entered Black Bear Diner and greeted first by a host behind the small pastry case and then by my server, Ray, the morning progressed in two courses with countless cups of coffee, the carving action outside visible through the windows while I dined.  Starting sweet and progressing sweeter it was to the flavor of custard-rich, ice cream crowned bread pudding that the meal began and rife with caramel, pecans, and raisins the steamy block proved surprisingly light while a duo of fresh baked breads with whipped butter and honey proved equally well done; the $0.99 cornbread toothsome and buttery while the $2.39 biscuit was so fluffy it literally flaked apart to the tooth.  Working slowly through the trio as wood chips flew it was only after the pudding was polished off that Ray put in my order for round-two and arriving piping hot the quartered cinnamon roll dressed in eggy batter and fried golden was superb, a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting mingling with the surprise of pure maple syrup into pure decadence - the sort of dish best taken with milk or coffee...and perhaps even better, shared.  At this point taking my leave and settling the bill it was with two additional items that I exited the cozy confines of the Black Bear and saving them until hours later suffice it to say that it was with some disappointment that I found the signature bear claw's pastry poorly laminated around pasty nut filling while the requested ""Cinnamon Apple Bavarian Cream Pie"" had been substituted by a standard, albeit delicious, traditional Apple Pie with a glossy butter crust instead - next time I guess I'll just have to enjoy all three courses at the table instead.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,1,3,zM4ZMujCstAT28OZMsxCHQ

As a country\chicken fried steak connoisseur, I must mention that everything you may have heard is true - they DO have great chicken fried steak. Every bite is worth EVERY calorie. Eachtime I've come here in the past year (I'd say over 10 times), I tell myself that I will try something else on the menu. Um, I haven't - I CAN'T!!! I feel ordering something else will deprive me of the opportunity to enjoy one of my favorite breakfasts.
My husband especially loves that they have a ""Hungry Bear's Breakfast"" section - he hates it when he can't get a big breakfast! Even though the chicken fried steak (big foot version - of course) is his all time favorite, he loves The Grizz too.
All the food is hot and fresh --but most importantly - consistent!!! That's a biggie.

I love the owner\host guy that is there every time we walk in and seats us. He is the cutest old guy in the world. Every time we come in he gives us the warmest welcome and has this adorable smiling face. I keep telling my husband - I swear I just want to give that guy a hug.

The wait staff seems to have been working there forever.. They know everything on that menu front and back. The service is always top notch. 

We haven't been there for any other time except breakfast but we have been meaning to and probably will in the near future. I would recommend signing up for their loyalty program - you get great deals via email that are hard to pass up.

I got the tri-tip dip with a green salad. The cuts of meat are thick and generous without being jaw dislocating. With three large slices of perfectly seasoned beef, grilled onions and mushrooms, it was perfect. The vegetables were not drowned in oil and the roll was not soaked through. The tri-tip was cooked to a medium/medium-well. I normally prefer medium rare, so next time I will request it and see if they offer that option. The green salad was standard. My friend got the hobo omelet and you have to be starving to finish it. It is a gigantic monster stuffed and topped with bacon, sausage, ham, spinach, onion, and cheese. The red potato chunks are tender, not too salty, but not crispy. It comes with a bread as well. He got the biscuit. They are big, not dense and light.  Both entrees cost around nine dollars. We were shocked by how generous the portions were for the price and that it tasted good too. I could not finish the meal without getting a blackberry sundae. Even though I was full, I cannot resist the cold stuff especially if it is topped with berries. They give a large scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with warm blackberries. Instead of doing a compote, when heated, the berries release their juices to create a sauce. As the ice cream melts and melds with the fresh fruit and whipped cream, it is heaven. 

This is a nice place to have a relaxing meal. The only thing that is rushed is the food. The kitchen and staff are quick to deliver without making you feel like you have to shove it down and get out.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,2,4,hg3k0YGSVTWhCr2smuUErg

Black Bear Diner is best for breakfast and comfort food - basically diner faire, but they're made up a little classier than a greasy spoon diner. This location also seems to have plenty of parking and seating, I went at a reasonably busy hour and there was no wait.

I want to extend ""word of mouth"" for this place.  It has a very California feel to it, which is a nice diversion from the usual Vegas.  The whole style reminds me of California Adventure/Grand Californian Hotel at Disneyland.  It has that same rustic style, and looks decidedly non-Vegas.  And yes, there are plenty of bears and bear pictures and bear statues.... But it works really well here.  It's charming and funny.

I tried their eggs benedict, and they know what they are doing.  I was really pleased by how well done the eggs were, and while I am not so much of a hash brown fan due to the wimpy little potato slivers that usually comprise a hash brown, these are potato CHUNKS.  They're cut as a standard hash brown, but they are huge pieces, and are excellent.

The service here was top-notch.  From the waitress, to the manager who stopped by to see how our meal was.  You know the drill: Manager stops by with the obligatory ""How is everything"" speech, and may or may not care about the answer.  The manager here was very sincere and genuine.  He clearly wanted to make sure that we were having an enjoyable time, and I was pleasantly taken aback by that.

When we left, the manager was again there, friendly as could be, and chatted us up while we cashed out.  There was a handful of staff members by the register, and again, it was surprising how friendly everyone was.  For a first time visit, they made us feel like old friends.

Granted, I've been here one time, and with my limited food experience from their menu, I don't know the full extent of how everything tastes.  But they impressed me enough to want to make this a regular spot.

I really liked this place a lot, and if in need of a new and different food option, this is an top-notch choice, and worth the drive over there.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,6,1,5,l548XFP5-k7ZxrP3pV-xhw

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but ""Chicken from Satan"" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entrée was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how ""comfort food"" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,49,41,3,Lsw_juezAMTP28p0cWSFIA

All I can remember is that I had a big portion of comfortable and tasty breakfast meal with a strong cup of coffee( I enjoy drinking bold in the morning). I decided to try it again on one Sunday morning. 
When I walked in, it was a full house! I waited about 5 min and got a table. 
I knew what I wanted,,, Omelette, Omelette, & Omelette :) 

*My Happy Meal of the Dayyy: 

1. South of the Border Omelette-seasoned ground beef OR chorizo with ortega chilies, jack cheese, avocado and homemade salsa, served with a flour tortilla. Choice of strip-cut hash browns OR red diced potatoes($8.99): I had the chorizo and the red potatoes.. 

2. Coffee with vanilla cream and sugar: It was bold & smooth. 

Well, I really enjoyed my meal. The service was provided promptly by friendly waitress. The portion was HUGE that I had to take some home. There was no cut-off time for ordering breakfast here. I prefer real all day breakfast places for a late breakfast( I am pretty much a late riser on weekends). I noticed that a full service menu is offered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'll definitely give them another shot. Nowadays, I can't seem to find very many good hole in the wall, mom and pop owned places to have a breakfast in LV. It is definitely a chain world out here in the city!

As we were leaving the restaurant, we happened to look over at a gentleman who had ordered the same thing and just received his meal. SIX pieces of steak. Count 'em, SIX! Why the difference?

The vegetarian omelet I got was chock full of sautéed vegetables, much more than I had expected! The egg also had that standard fluffy quality. And the biscuits...They were massive! They were warm and fluffy and oh-so-delicious thanks to the fact that my date decided to get gravy on the side. On another note, the hash browns I had were my favorite to date and the corned beef hash was better than I've ever tasted.

We also got the banana cream pie, which was pretty good but not mind-blowing. It was sweet, creamy, and crispy in all the right places.

Black Bear is a restaurant chain that started in Mt. Shasta, California with locations in the western part of the United States, such as Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.

On weekends, they do get crowded, but fortunately we came on a weekday, and was seated right away at 9:30 am.  The restaurant is ""bear themed"" and the portions are lumberjack sized.  They do offer a a few menu items for seniors or those who are light eaters, and the portions are still very generous.

We had dinner plans at 7:00, so we didn't want to fill up with a huge breakfast.  We decided on the ""Mini Volcano"" which is 2 pancakes, bacon and/or sausage, plus an egg for $8.99.  The pancakes are made with a sweet cream, which I ate without syrup.  They reminded me of the taste of a fortune cookie, with a hint of vanilla.

Service was friendly, and there's plenty of free parking.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,4,7,4,1ow_53mogNvrGbBXpuasfg
5717373,2012-04-17,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"OK, after a few days of eating average Vegas buffet food, we cruised over to the Black Bear Diner for breakfast and all I can say is that we totally screwed up... by waiting so long to try the Black Bear.  I had an order of chicken fried steak that was so tender and tasty that I could literally cut it with the fork.  Along with that, I had diced red potatoes with onions/peppers and a killer sweet-cream pancake.  My wife had the hobo omelet, hash browns and a huge homemade biscuit.  The daughter had a stack of the pancakes, eggs and bacon.  We were so stuffed that there was no way we could enjoy any dessert, so the wife got a bear claw to go.  Apparently that was pretty good too, since I never got a single bite of it...  The entire staff there is super nice and friendly (normal) people.  We'll definitely be back

Not buying it.  I tried the chicken fried steak as everyone seems to recommend it and I will say that who ever thinks this is the best they've ever had, have you ever been any where else??  I am very sorry but the gravy was a basic mix with no flavor AT ALL other than a pound of salt.  My husband had the Tri-tip dinner, all four little pieces of it for a whopping $17, and it had absolutely been microwaved as it was HORRIBLE!  No one ever came back to see if we were ok, until the end when our server came back with the check.  We told her that this was our first and would be our last time in.

I usually come here for breakfast items, but will occasionally have a burger when I feel like it.  Food is a-ok but definitely had better breakfast at almost half the price.  The pancakes are fluffy and moist, which is a super plus.  I like their classic cheese burger too.  Everything else is pretty standard, but i must add that i haven't ventured off to their dinner items.  Portions are huge and that's not necessarily always a good thing.  A bit excessive if you ask me; if you're not too hungry sharing would be wise.

Service is whatever.  I'll occasionally get a really friendly waitress who's personable and sweet, and then one who's rushed and without much personality.  

This morning i had the latter.  I was craving French toast and noticed all they had were cinnamon French rolls (their take on French toast).  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested it as being really delicious.  I took her word for it and left it at that because she seemed slightly impatient.  I would not recommend this dish!!!  It was cold, dry, too sweet, and hard.  It reminded me of a failed attempt at a Cinnabon.  I took a bite, put it to the side and shared my BFs omelet.  I actually really did try eating it though. 

Waitress comes up, asked if we needed a box, I said no, and she asked whether I liked my dish.  I said no, she hesitated about whether she should drop my check or possibly take my uneaten meal off of it. She decided to drop the check and went on her way.  Whatever.  The food wasn't expensive, but I definitely wasted $10 because I couldn't bring myself to eat that crap dish!!

Anyway, overall this place is a-ok.  

Will I be back?  Yes.  Not anytime soon that's for sure.

I'm definitely passing on the cinnamon french roll next time and I'll pass on that waitress too.

Servings are huge! The GF had a chef salad that could have easily served and filled up a family of four. The ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Only. Complaint was that they didn't have regular ranch and she had to settle for their Bacon Ranch (there was none of it left to take home with her leftovers so it really wasn't a complaint with merit)

 The daughter had fish and chips, another huge portion good fish flavor but the fries were soggy. They might need a different routine (not leaving them hang over the frier etc to keep them crisp).

I had the Ravioli it was a huge portion I took half home with me as I also had the BlackBerry Cobbler. The Cobbler was amazing definitely worth stopping in for all by itself. 

The Ravioli wasn't bad but definitely not the best thing on their menu. It looked odd/out of place on the menu amongst all the country dishes and I just had to give it a try.

The Ravioli had a strong vinegar taste that I didn't care a whole lot for. The sauce outside of the vinegar was good and the pasta/meat was almost perfect.

Holy Bear Heaven, Batman! This place is a little slice of Northern California right here in Vegas! Delicious food, giant portions, fantastically happy and friendly staff!

SPECIAL KUDOS
Dan is the manager at this location and he loves it. We connected with him over Northern California (my friend Jessica grew up down the road from him). It's a special thing when you can have a nice conversation with restaurant staff. Speaks volumes about job satisfaction that translates directly into the quality of service from the host, to the cooks, to the manager.

I didn't catch William, our server, without a smile on his face. He was also fun to chat with and seemed to enjoy his work. He kept our drinks full and faces smiling.

Seriously: major kudos and props to the team at this restaurant. We will be coming back every year to relive this experience!

THE EATS
Breakfast Burrito -- I opted for something hand held and I wasn't disappointed. The burrito itself wasn't huge, but that was overshadowed by huge flavors. It also came with a side of fresh salsa and a giant portion of their delicious hash browns.

My friends had the California Benedicts and Joe's Hobo Omelette. It would be an understatement to say their plates were clean. There was nary a speck of food left to make you think the plates hadn't come straight out of the dishwasher.

I was wondering after the first visit could this be heaven??? What pure deliciousness! So fresh and yummy for my high maintenance tummy. Great job guys. I also had egg whites scrambled with cheese on top and a hash brown. They were made to perfection.

While on vacation in LV, we decided that we were going to have most of our meals off the strip, to eat where the locals eat, and have some time when The Black Eyed Peas are not blasting in my ears when I am trying to eat. 

Thanks to YELP we checked this place out. Loved the decor from the very start, the place was hardly crowded and the menus are printed on newsprint.

Our waiter was super friendly, and the food was great. I had the Tri-Tip dip, the sandwich was cooked to perfection, the others at the table had the meatloaf and the chicken fried steak. All where a hit. For dessert we all split an amazing coconut cream pie.

The prices are really good, about average for what you would get anywhere else. What we ordered would probably cost twice as much, if you could even find this kind of food.

The setting was about 4 miles off the strip and offered a nice change of pace that allowed us to talk to one another and plan the rest of our night.

Great place, if in Vegas this and The Original Pancake House are a must for eating.",gxLf7JLLKVp6NVTBLJbsiQ,0,0,4,DTGg7aS6t_sLj_IQMWSF6A

My only issue was that the place is filthy.  The carpet is old and stained there was food on the floor and when the staff was wiping off the take they were simply pushing the crumbs onto the seats.  

If the clean that place up it will get a 5 star from me.",fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,0,0,3,v2b2XpSGD91hYK45OXyyng

That being said, I come here whenever I want food on the cheap, in my neighborhood served by friendly staff in a timely manner.

The wait staff is pleasant and friendly and how can you not like the decor. Bears, bears and more bears!

It's best to probably go for breakfast or dessert. Their lunch and dinners are nothing to write home about. Definitely check out the Blackbeary Cobbler a la mode. It's devine and oh so cheap!!! :)",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,6,3,fTmcg55nPlF-SFQeiGK6RQ

The hostess took our drink order so there was minimum lag time to getting a beverage! That was a great bonus as sometimes a server gets busy and you wait forever for a drink. 

Dawn, our server was efficient and prompt. She was attentive yet not too over ""bearing"", lol. Seriously, she was super friendly and came back or by several times incase we needed something. The portion sizes were gigantic and could probably be shared.",nGYWMsfUofP3cWmzuW8fWw,1,1,5,JsQXuVNrbR3SZj6g8QfBZQ

The food was blah...I had the French dip. The meat was over cooked and the side salad was boring (iceberg lettus with a few cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices). Overall, just not good food. 

The service was fine. Nothing great but not terrible either. 

I should have known when I walked in to this place it was going to be a poor experience. The decor and cleanliness were poor...normally I leave if this happens but the friends I was with didn't want to. 

It must have a good breakfast, idk why else the stars would be so high.",5YR_DM50DTMEK_8ydDjaaw,2,0,2,y_3B7ie5uoF6r5ssglJDfQ
5983731,2013-02-27,0,PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ,"Brunch date!

I met up with the date buddy at 1PM on a Monday afternoon and was out the door in less than 45 minutes (partially because we were on a time crunch since he had to go to work).

When we first walked in the door, I noticed how exceptionally busy they were.  There were unbused tables, people lining up at the cashier register to pay their bills, and no host/hostess in sight.  I was a tad confused as to what to do, so we just waited.  Eventually, a gentleman came around and greeted us, asked us to wait for a table to be cleaned up, but then proceeded to greet the party of 4 behind us (whom he was obviously familiar with) and lead them to an open table.  I was also a tad confused to this as well.  But we eventually got seated and drinks ordered.

The menu is cutely printed on a faux newspaper, and it seemed a bit huge and overwhelming.  I didn't realize they shoved breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner all into two pages.  It was a bit much.

I ordered the eggs benedict.  The food came out super quick and was perfectly warm.  I noticed right away there were bits of bacon on my potatoes, YUM! And these were real potatoes, not frozen and reheated, but real potatoes.  That's always plus.  Then I noticed there was a GENEROUS portion of hollandaise on my eggs.  It was a tad much for me, but it was good.  My eggs were wonderfully poached and the ham was tastefully salty.

Like I said, we were out the door in 45 minutes, even after waiting to be seated and the cash register debacle of taking awhile to process our debit cards when we were checking out.  I wanted to give the restaurant 4 stars because of the food, but I had such high expectations from reading other Yelp reviews and the service did not deliver.  I do believe it was in part due to being so busy and they did appear short-staffed, but I was slightly disappointed.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,3,2,3,RVfI2wQeZQAsdeRyPvkLIA
