140209,2017-03-27,0,VFcx35QDd_kZgLT4UDV8xg,WORST Robertos location in the valley. I go to the University location. I was extremely excited when this location opened just down the road from me. I made the mistake today on going to this one and I knew better. My wet bean and cheese burrito was all tortilla and no filling. I've had many problems with this location from beans not being completely cooked to burritos being so thin they'd fit through a mail slot. This location is hit or miss with MISS being the primary theme. Continuous disappointment... I'll continue going to the University location and this one can continue raking the tourists over the coals who know no better.,pk4kVtaCAfhyr7QBpQnRAw,0,0,1,6frM_faq5vqztndf11iKhA

Of course, the cashier decided to chime in and call the paying customer ""Stupid""... in Spanish of course.  Yeah, this didn't go well.  And in the end, I still didn't get what i ordered.  They still got it wrong.  Chicken does not sound like pork... or steak.  And after we argued, the cashier had the nerve to charge for the difference.  And then walked to the kitchen.    Why?

I understand food prices go up over time but not this much all at once ... this just seems like ""Hey, we can hit the Hard Rock tourists up for a lot more than we already are, let's go for it""

Shocked to read other people saying they charge $1 for any credit card transaction now too ... it used to be only if you spent less than $4, which I felt was OK because those things do cost money (try freelancing or running your own business to learn all about the joys of paying out the ass to let people pay you with credit cards). $1 on every transaction is excessive though.

The details of of my first time trying Roberto's Taco Shop are debatable but it might've been about a decade ago in San Diego. I'm prone to forgetting entire dining experiences if they aren't immediately  documented on Yelp. 

As fuzzy as my memory might've been at 4am this past 4th of July weekend, I still recall raving about Roberto's bomb-ass rolled chicken tacos which were covered in guacamole, sour cream, cheese, & lettuce, but still uber crunchy, especially at each end. A few forkfuls of his carne asada fries were all I needed to know I've had better (most likely somewhere in sunny San Diego, as well.) An Orange Bang would've made this a 5-star meal, but their cold & sweet Pi√±a drink went just fine with the rest of the delicious Mexican flavors on my (styrofoam) plate.

I feel like based on my last visit which happened to be at this particular location, I had an epiphany.. you know like one of those ""AH-HA"" moments of why it is that I'd went so long without eating any food from them. The quality definitely lacks more than what I remember, that's for SURE! 

After a fun night hanging out at the Hard Rock with my friends after a concert we were of course hungry and needed to soak up all that liquor from drinking. Who doesn't want a 1,000 plus calorie meal to feel better right? Oh and to have this place be so conveniently located right across the street there was no hesitation at all. Located right on the corner of Harmon & Paradise Rd you will find them in the Harmon Square. When we arrived it was busy and they only had one cashier who obviously hated her job.. just rude for no reason and shouldn't have been the face of the company that night but that's a different story so I'll move on....

Let's address these prices... Now Mr. Roberto.. Are you for real? I need you to get it together because since WHEN did the carne asada fries come up to $10.77?! I remember the good ole days when these use to be like one of the best bang for your buck options of what to order because it was so much food for a reasonable price. I'm just not seeing these price increasing warranting the taste of what is being delivered. My carne asada fries weren't as delicious as what I know they can and have made right in the past. Then the facts kick in on how much they cost now which made them taste even worse. Bottom line is I really think I'm calling it quits with Mr. Roberto. There are far more better Mexican fast food joints around Las Vegas and even though they may not be 24hrs I still will choose them over this place.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,1,2,orDSNQhVVJspiw11KDEv8A

I order the same thing every time; carne asada burrito minus the guacamole and add sour cream. They charge an additional $1.50 for the sour cream which shouldn't be a change when you are subbing it for guacamole but ok that's fine. I open my first burrito and no sour cream, I take it back to the counter and ask for sour cream. She ask for my burrito and she returns it to me not folded and no flooded with sour cream. I can't even take a bite with liquid pouring out all over my plate and drenching my hands. I try to fold it back together again and now the burrito is soaking wet. I bring the burrito back to the counter and she offers to make another one which is great. They make it immediately and serve it back to me. I take two bites and realize there is no sour cream on the burrito. Another team member steps in and I figure things will get better now, nope she says I already got enough sour cream on my previous burrito. Really??? I ask for a side of sour cream and she wants to charge me again for another side of sour cream. I try to explain to the new team member that I have already paid for a side of sour cream, she finally decided to just give me half a cup of the completely liquid sour cream.

I ordered a potato burrito and it came out perfectly; just like grandma used to make.  It has just enough firm fried potatoes and eggs to make my mouth happy.  

The fresh red picante sauce is spicy!  Yum.  Love the marinated jalape√±os and carrots, which all taco stands should carry.  Radishes and cucumbers help cut the heat.  They even have the traditional plastic bags for the veggies like in LA.

It's very clean and service was swift.  The menu looks huge and includes menudo on the weekends, a great hangover cure.  I'll try the chills relleno next time.

5518988,2016-05-04,14,VFcx35QDd_kZgLT4UDV8xg,"When your transplanted Vegas (now in Austin) friend posts on Facebook that she is having serious (non-preg-related) cravings for carne asada fries, and the place she mentions is Roberto's, and you see there is a yelp listing for one just far enough that you can incorporate it into your daily workout as you jog there, and you're on vacation with no other lunch plans, and your wife is busy at a conference on The Strip, you just say ""Why not?"".

This location is a comfortable 1.75 mile walk/jog/run from our spot at the Venetian.  I wasn't sure it this location was even open yet (the website still said ""Coming Soon""), but I decided to do a little recon anyway.  It's in a new shopping center on Paradise right across Harmon from The Hard Rock.  In Vegas fashion, it's open 24 hours a day, just like the Subway next door (who knew I could get Subway at 4 in the morning?).  When I got there, I thought it wasn't yet open.  But they had opened just a couple hours before (on May 2, 2016).  

On to the food.  The Carne Asada Fries were as promised.  For $8, it is a Mount Charleston-sized pile of melted cheddar, beans, salsa, sour cream, onions, and guacamole-sauced goodness, piled onto just-fried potatoes.  I enjoyed it with my Dr. Pepper, but completely wish I had noticed the horchata to drink instead.  It really feeds two (or makes a decent second meal later), so a couple could devour an order, have a couple soft drinks (Pepsi line of products plus Dr. Pepper) for like 12 bucks.  The menu is a broad variety of tacos, burritos, torts, etc.  Just like you'd find near the southern border of California.  I saw other reviews for other locations that mention disinterested (or worse) staff.  But here (and to be fair, it was their first day) it was all smiles.

A little bit of San Diego's taco counter roots, planted BAM! in the middle of Las Vegas.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Though it's perfectly acceptable to run here, you probably won't feel like running after you have more than, oh, a third of an order of those fries.  I had about half and walked back.",wXSzeF0XoUm3P9MezcVKtQ,18,16,4,Ms6-hckQ-_llrAfCvOIXdQ
