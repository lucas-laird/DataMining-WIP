45352,2017-04-16,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,I was hoping I would be getting authentic Mexican cuisine. This place is another Summerlin hangout for white people who don't mind over paying for rice and beans. The settings throughout the restaurant are great. The staff is well educated about the menu. This entire place is all show and no go. I guess my expectations were too high.,vHSm0P2ty5WXeCgjA2W6Cw,0,0,3,Kf0wOywGkLDCE1K1Z4gC-A

I had the tortilla soup and the street tacos, both were super delicious. We also ordered the guacamole and had the house salsa. Good choices! This would be a fun place for a large group as well as just 2 people. The music they played was of good variety as well.

When my girlfriends wanted to meet here, let's just say it wasn't my first choice. So glad I went though. Our bartender was Sam and she was hilarious. I didn't have to stress over what to order thanks to her descriptions of the menu items. I went with her suggestion and ordered the dynamite tacos and carnitas. SO good! We went on a Friday night so the bar was a bit crowded but we never had to wait for drinks or fight for attention/service. We just ate at the bar so can't give input on the dining room but if they provide the same service as our bartender then you'll be set. Food was delish and now I'm not so uncomfortable ordering.

Painfully loud. Can a Brother get some soft surfaces on a wall or two to cut the sound reflection?

Granted we were there on a busy Saturday night, but I can honestly say that I've never been to a louder restaurant in my life. It was so loud that I downloaded a decibel meter on my iPhone, and it clocked in at 91 decibels. THAT'S PRETTY LOUD!...WHAT?...

Food was just OK and the margaritas were meh, but the servers were great. Very friendly and attentive...they get an extra point for that.

Saying that, I am more than satisfied with Libre taking over and replacing the old Merchadito. The food was amazing, and had its own little spin to each dish which made it that much better. There seemed to be a lot of employees working, which I'm sure is to be expected when opening a new restaurant even though it can be overwhelming at times. Our server/servers (Kevin), in specific, were on point when it came to knowledge of each dish, having great recommendations, and making sure we were satisfied and well taken care of.

1241415,2017-07-18,1,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I came to Libre on a Taco Tuesday, and I was surprised with the quality of the tacos. The Taco Tuesday offer was $24 for all you can eat steak and chicken tacos and as many tequila shots and margaritas that you want. Chips and salsa were also complimentary. The chips were warm when they came out, which was a good contrast to the chilled salsa. The salsa was fresh and flavorful, where the notes of cilantro were evident and it was not too spicy. The chicken tacos were tasty and the bits of chicken were tender and juicy, where they were lightly seasoned. The steak tacos was the real winner though. The steak by itself was marinated very well, where the spices accentuated the natural flavors of the beef. The meat was cooked to a tender medium, where it was still able to keep its juiciness even though the steaks were cut to thin strips. 

Even if you don't like to drink alcohol, Taco Tuesdays are wonderful at Libre. You can get your fix of as many tacos you want and their chips and salsa are just as great.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,3,2,4,jWddDc3mlKrCHy67YHuLiQ
1242584,2017-01-18,1,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,Wow so I went here last night for the taco Tuesday I was amazed. The special consisted of all you can eat tacos and all you can drink margaritas or tequila shots (double shots). I was skeptical at first that they was going to be limitations and rules....there wasn't the only thing stopping me was me. I was amazed I sat down in less than 5 min my waiter was there ordered two specials and a bean dip cause we were starving and needed an appetizer...well in less than 10 min all the food and drinks were out! The service was tremendous constantly helping and very friendly. I'm so glad I tried this place! I will return!,NifKMdVokA7QYrUeyMj_Sg,2,1,5,YHbZ9I1lMBRZcO3ZMhZikw

1255399,2018-04-23,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Good food in generous portions!

The fresh guacamole appetizer was awesome! The chips were fresh, and the salsa was fantastic.

I'm a fan of the ""Sidecar"" cocktail. I had several here, and they were on par with the best. It's sort of like a margarita made with cognac and lemon instead of tequila and lime. Try it if you like classic cocktails that go well with Mexican food!

For dinner, I had the chile relleno - deep fried and delicious! served with fresh avocado and a tasty green salsa. Really good! The accompanying rice and beans were standard. Not exciting, but fine.

All-in-all, a very good experience. I'll definitely be back.

So, why four stars instead of five? The prices. Though they are not unreasonable for a casino restaurant, I have a hard time paying inflated prices for a food that is (a) generally so inexpensive (rice and beans, right?) and (b) so ubiquitous in Las Vegas.

We're essentially in ""Occupied Mexico"" here. Really good, authentic, and cheap Mexican food is available pretty much everywhere in town. I understand that we're paying for the service (which was great) and the experience (which was above average) - but for me,the $60 tab (including tip)was just too much when I can get a similar meal in a less fancy place for a good deal less.

Still, kudos to the team there for killin' it!",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,3,2,4,RwMBqihRdsXqod3LRuskiQ

1260636,2016-11-07,1,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"We just had quite possibly the worst dining experience ever here. 

It took a while for her to greet us, but to start, we ordered a coke, an ice tea, water, a kids water, and a margarita. The margarita showed up after a few minutes, the water for me followed that. We asked again for the kids water an assumed (stupidly) the other drinks were on their way.

We got the guacamole and the bean dip, probably the highlight of the meal.

It took her about 20 minutes to come back and get our order, and we were finally able to bring to her attention that we still didn't have an ice tea or our coke, as the guy bringing drinks was thoroughly clueless and painfully absent.

We ordered a chicken al pastor burrito, a Chile relleno, a kids quesadilla, and chicken enchiladas with green sauce. We asked if the enchiladas came with rice and beans, and were told no, so we added a side of rice (she didn't want any beans as she can't eat them).

The ice tea finally came, still no coke.

Rice comes out, alone, weird, whatever. the kids quesadilla comes out, ok, fine, baby can start eating. a little while later the rest of our food comes out, pretty quickly, still no coke.

Enchiladas came out with rice and beans, annoying because we didn't want the beans, and we ordered a side of rice and paid extra for it because she told us there was no side of rice. Her enchiladas were also smothered in red sauce, instead of green. 

My chicken burrito was beef, and tough, tendony beef at that. I cut it open and waited to start eating because I wanted to send it back.

She never came back, so my mother in law decided just to eat her wrong enchiladas, and deal with it. Good thing too she would have starved too, because the waitress never came back.

The coke finally showed up when we were well into eating our entrees (well except for me, as i was not eating, still holding on to a glimmer of hope that I would get the chicken burrito I ordered)

We tried to get someone's attention, but no one seemed to care, so I waited with an untouched plate of food in front of me.

I thought my hubby stopped eating his Chile relleno out of solidarity with me, but turned out his food was just gross. The Chile was breaded nicely but it was raw inside, and totally flavorless.

The waitress finally came by about 30 minutes after our entrees got dropped off, and everyone was done eating, except me of course, I sent the food back and just asked it be removed from the bill since I didn't feel like making everyone wait while I ate.

Drinks were never refilled.

She did take a ton of food off of our bill, even though we only complained about my burrito, she must have known we got crap service and was trying to salvage a tip.

The manager never came over, he preferred leaning up against the bar and watching his staff struggle with basic restaurant tasks.

We will never come back.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,4,1,1,27D-KMYSbZ2-AV1BZzBUxg

I went into Libre hoping it would be something similar. (I was told by a friend that works with Light group, the group that owns several of the restaurants in the Red Rock, that they basically forced Mercadito out in order to place their own restaurant there).

The drinks were nothing spectacular. The server hyped up their happy hour special that was a shot and a beer for a price that ""basically gave you a free beer"". We had two of those specials, two cocktails, an extra tequila shot, and the ceviche taco appetizer, total came out to $80. Let me also say, thank goodness I wasn't very hungry, because the size of these tacos... Oh man... They're supposed to be 'street taco' size, but they look more like Fisher-Price toys when you buy your kids their first play kitchen. I ordered the cucumber cocktail (can't remember the name exactly) and it wasn't very good. Being a proper alcoholic I still finished it of course, but I long for my Misty's Sleeve from Mercadito!

1291133,2016-02-08,1,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Ok, first things first. Leaps and bounds better than Mercadito (which was nothing but gringo fluff, latin-ish, pretentious crap). Service at the bar was great, all the girls were friendly and helpful. The menu was everything it should be, a fancy version of the real thing, not an ""inspired"" dish some overhyped chef invented.

The food I tried:

Pozole -  Excellent, very tasty but too small for the price. A cup size great for tasting.

Mahi tacos - Delicious, good sized plate but were sweetened with a honey glaze, I personally dont care for sweet food unless its dessert so it would be nice to know in advance.

Rice and beans - well they are rice and beans....good quality, which I will take any day over most crap out there but, but nothing special, homemade are still best. 

Coconut ceviche - I was concerned by the name it would be sweet but it was delicious, again though to small for the price. 

Chips and salsa -  chips were good nothing spectacular, but way better than most other places, Pico de Gallo was delish. 

Churro Ice Cream Sandwich - A spectacular foodgasmic messy event to cap off the smorg. 

Overall they hit the mark, they would have and will get 5stars from me if they adjust the portions to match the price. 

I complimented the manager, who was very gracious, and told him Id be back to try to whole menu, and I will.

We sat out on the patio because it was such a beautiful evening but walking thru the restaurant we experienced a cool relaxing vibe. We'll eat inside next time. I'm not a big margarita fan but with 2 options going on (unlimited tacos and tequila ( Tuesday only) or $6 HH margs and teezers. I decided to go with a marg. I was pleasantly surprised it did not have an overly sour taste as I experience with most margs. We ordered off the HH menu and had guacamole, corn fritters, ceviche and carne asada tacos. I'm a purist when it comes to guac just like avocado, cilantro and a little onion this is how is was served very yummy. But if your looking for tomatoes and other add ins there not there but I'd still suggest giving it a try.  The ceviche (shrimp) was good and a nice touch is that it was served with fried plantains as opposed to tortilla chips.  My only complaint is the tacos. Although very tasty didn't think it was worth the $6 price especially because it was only 1 taco for that HH price. Wonder what the regular price of a taco is?  Waitstaff was pleasant always checking on us filling our water and removing empty plates.  Patio had plenty of customers, good music playing and an overall nice vibe going. We'll definitely be back and sit inside next time waiting for a rainy day or cooler weather for that though. So we may be back in the patio before then. Also will go with the unlimited tacos and margs next time. Better deal we believe.

First they offered us a table that was way too intimate, there was no way I could sit down and enjoy dinner with strangers 5 feet away from me so they brought us closer to the bar and wow once again they did not think of personal space when they planned the seating areas because my friend and I struggled to get on the high top chair and sit down with the little space between the chair and the table. 

The service was so FAST it was scary. They also followed high standards and kept filling my glass before I could even enjoy a second sip of water. We literally were in and out in probably 45 mins and most of the wait time being spent was them waiting for us to decide what to eat.

I had the chicken quesadilla. Presentation was perfect, quality was delicious. For dessert we ordered the churro ice cream sandwich. My friend was dissatisfied and sent hers back immediately and honestly I just finished it for the experience and I would never order it again. The churro was overcooked and with the ice cream it made it so cold and almost hard to eat as there was no warmth or realness to it. The ice cream and chocolate sauce was nice but the reason to order it was for the churro so, I shouldn't have wasted my time and sent it back as well. 

Overall I would come back and try more, nice to know that even on a Saturday night I can dine here and still make it to my movie with no problems unlike the other restaurants in the casino!

1433056,2017-10-19,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Not exactly the experience I was hoping for.  My partner and I went there on a Wednesday night.  I do not eat animal products, so I was pleased that this restaurant has a small vegan menu.  It was happy hour, so I decided to try one of their $6 house margaritas.  Way overpriced for what you get, it's served over a glassful of crushed ice.  Based on what I saw on the menu, all of their alcohol is much more expensive than it needs to be ($6-$8 for a bottle of beer, including domestic).

My partner ordered the chicken fajitas.  Our server mentioned he could get a beef/chicken mix instead if he wanted, so he ordered that.  I ordered the guacamole with vegetables, and the veggie and tofu fajitas (which is specific to the vegan menu).

Our guacamole arrived with cheese on top, something that was not mentioned on the menu.  As we were trying to flag down our server to send it back, our entrees arrived.  (So, essentially, everything arrived at once. Not good.)  A manager came to our table to take away the guacamole.  He asked if we wanted another order without cheese; we asked if it could just be cancelled since our entrees were sitting in front of us.  He agreed.

My partner's fajitas were good, mine were disappointing.  The tofu was too soft, almost custard-like, cut into big slices and covered in what looked like buffalo sauce.  I later mentioned to the manager that they should perhaps use extra firm tofu and slice it into strips for more of a true fajita look and feel.  He said he'd mention that to the chef, though I had the impression this was more of a ""yeah, whatever"" attempt to come up with a response. (I could be wrong.)

When we got the bill, we noticed that the guacamole had not been removed, and that there was a $4 upcharge for the chicken/beef mix.  We mentioned this to our server, she stated that it was indicated on the menu.  We think it would have been nice if she had mentioned it at the time it was ordered.  My partner still would have ordered it, but it wouldn't have been a surprise.  We checked out a menu and it is indicated in small print, nowhere near the section for the fajitas.  Eventually, our server removed the guacamole and credited the cost of one of our meals (via a Red Rock Resort coupon), so we're thankful for that.

As for the restaurant itself, the ambiance was nice.  The decor is interesting, and it wasn't overly loud.  Unfortunately, it's not a restaurant to which I'm likely to return.",Yo_Ho8R1YqQBlGani7C1_A,0,0,2,IROJMiMi6ZUZjQu7zTmmNA

I had ordered a strawberry margarita, I wanted it blended, but their blender wasn't working so I ended up having it on the rocks. It was actually just as good on the rocks as it is blended. Then I tried a mango margarita and WOW, so good. I love trying different flavored margaritas. As for the tacos, they were very good as well. I got chicken and steak, WOW again.

1598456,2017-01-08,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I was really unimpressed with Libre. Pretty expensive for what you're getting, and the food wasn't that great. 

Started off with chips and salsa. The chips were pretty good, but the salsa was not. Way too much cilantro, and not a lot of flavor to balance out the tomatoes. My wife and I decided to get the bean and cheese dip to go with it. This was alright. Didn't seem special. It was alright. If I was grading on bean dip alone: 3 stars. 

Followed this up with taquitos, which were not great. There was plenty of meat inside, but they had a flavor that was not what I expected. The meat was under-seasoned, but what what seasoning there was had a...an interesting flavor. I would not order these again. Nothing about them made me think that something was wrong with them in the sense that I should send them back, they just were not that good. Came with a side of guac, which I did not try but my wife informs me was also not good. Which is nice, because we had considered guacamole instead of bean dip, so we dodged a bullet there maybe.

Lastly, our entrées. I had carne asada fajitas, while my wife had a chicken dish in green salsa. My fajita meat was actually pretty good. The meat was well-seasoned, and well cooked. The presentation of this dish was really nice, I thought it looked very creative and was happy when it arrived. Although I'd asked for corn tortillas instead of flour and got flour; eventually they brought me the right ones. On the down side, the cheese that came out with this dish looked and tasted like the cheap supermarket mixed shredded cheese that comes out of a plastic bag. Not great, not a lot of flavor. My wife's chicken was severely over-cooked, and had the texture of rubber. The tomatillo salsa was alright, and the seasoning was okay. 

The real point about the food is that the only thing we finished was the bean dip. My wife and I only ate about half of our entrées, we left behind a lot of chicken and steak, and we left behind a taquito as well. No to-go containers, we just had no desire to make leftovers of this meal whatsoever.

Service was also not very good. I carry a water bottle with me everywhere I go, and I had it with me at the restaurant. For about half my entire meal I was drinking from my own water bottle because the waitress never refilled my drink.

And lastly, the environment of this place could use a lot of work. It's a ""Mexican Cantina"" and yet the music at one point was Fallout Boy from the mid-2000s. Not exactly reinforcing the ""Mexican"" vibe. I'm sure if you want more modern music, Mexico has plenty of artists to offer you. The table we got put at in the bar area was also really jammed in there. I had to squeeze between the table and the chair just to get in, and I had to ask the person at the table next to us if they could scoot their chair in so my wife could get into hers. Not good.

Definitely won't be back.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,4,1,2,Gk4oz3gaT7ruXsE2-1QKSw

1702472,2017-08-14,2,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I usually avoid eating at hotel restaurants off the strip if I can since I haven't found any that I really like. While looking for reviews on Mexican restaurants, we chose Libre. We decided to sit outdoors and on a Friday night there were 5 tables taken and a couple inside. I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded for a Friday night. We were there for the reverse happy hour.

The food was not bad. We ordered 3 items all off of the happy hour menu-
-nachos
-corn fritters
-ceviche 

The above food is pretty basic and so maybe a better judge of the restaurant would be ordering more complex dishes. 

The nachos didn't have much melted cheese if any which was a disappointment. It had a cotija cream on it and salsa. There was also no guacamole. I prefer nachos with real melted cheese on it. 

The reason for the 1 star is this-

Our waiter- not sure who he was because he never came back. Someone came to fill our water and we saw several men walking around in a suit who appeared to be a manager and our waiter was long gone after taking our order. 

Overly sweet margaritas.

Cockroaches!!! One crawling about 5 inches away from me as I ate. They helped us move our things but did not seem to be concerned about the roaches saying it's part of the summer heat and making excuses. Ummmm are these roaches inside too? Grosssss!!! I continued to see roaches crawling all around outside!! I felt like I'm in a third world country. I get that it's Vegas and there are roaches but I think they need to control roaches in a restaurant. Is that asking too much? 

We were charged full price for the meal which is fine if there was some concern shown about roaches at their restaurant. Nope. The man in the suit didn't seem to feel bad nor did our waiter and when addressing roaches just made excuses. The most concern was shown through the water boy.

We had to sit on the patio because the wait inside was 45 minutes.

All you can eat and drink tacos and tequila for $24. The tequila is terrible, margaritas aren't back though, because they mask the cheap stuff in them. Also bummed that you only have two types of tacos to choose from: chicken or steak. The steak was really chewy and both types of tacos had way too much slaw in them.

Our favorite thing by far was the guacamole and the salsa.

1870751,2018-03-23,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Looking for a new delicious Mexican place in town and saw the reviews at Libre.  Our waiter was excellent, but what little food we ate was lacking. 

We arrived excited to discover that it was happy hour. Unfortunately, the prices were already very high and the happy hour menu was very small relative to other places we enjoy. Yard House's happy hour menu easily annihilates the one we so at Libre.  We opted to get a bean and cheese dip. It was not very good in my opinion. My girlfriend found it to be alright.  

Next we ordered the signature Dynamite Shrimp Tacos.  They were $15.  We received the 4 tiniest tacos I had ever seen.  I will go to places like Raku and spend some serious $ on some incredibly tasty but incredibly small dishes.  There is a place for that.  And even though these tacos were very good, a Mexican restaurant that offers happy hour on a weekend is not the place I am wanting to overpay for tiny amounts of food.  These taco appetizers were obnoxiously small.  4 gyoza-sized miniature nano tacos for $15.  

That was enough for me.  Inferior cheese and bean dip, lackluster happy hour menu, overpriced food items...We went to yard house and pounded back-to-back orders of poke nachos to finish off the night. 

I will say again though, that the waiter did do an excellent job.

We've been here 3-4 times before, but most recently dined here last Saturday night with a group of friends. 

As a self proclaimed vegetarian foodie I give them kudos just for having a vegan menu.  Surprisingly they have 5 options on it!

I ordered the Veggie and Tofu Fajita. One friend ordered the Tofu Brown Rice Bowl another friend ordered the same bowl but with Mahi Mahi. 

The fajitas were served on a sizzling hot plate with 3 toppings to choose from: vegan sour cream, guacamole, and house made pico. The presentation was pleasing but the taste was lacking. The onions and peppers were raw and unseasoned. It appears the chef was adventitious enough to put Tofu on the menu but seemed to loose direction with what to do with it. Both of our Tofu dishes came out with the Tofu undercooked and slathered on one side with a hefty layer of what tasted and looked like Sriracha hot sauce. They were overwhelmingly spicy for even a spice glutton like my husband. The brown rice bowls were served with a very sweet poppy seed dressing that didn't pair well with the spicy Tofu, but our friend who ordered the Mahi Mahi said it was very good.  They may benefit from tweaking the vegetarian versions of their dinner entree recipes but overall put up a good effort for even having them. 

My husband ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Chorizo, Eggs, and crispy potatoes. He orders this time and time again and likes it a lot. 

They offer free chips and salsa for the table. 

Mexican Street Corn on the Cob and the Bubbling Queso Fundido are a must and were fresh, tasty, and delicious appetizers. As a vegetarian I would come back and eat a combination of these with chips and salsa.

First impressions are really big for me when it comes to a restaurant. The hostess was very quiet and hardly said anything to us. She said ""Hi. 2? I'll seat you."" Takes us to our table, and no other words just walks away. No menus are given until the server approaches you. Server was attentive. 

They have reverse happy hour on weekends from 9-11 pm. We were there around 9 and my boyfriend took full advantage of $6 margaritas. Strong drinks! I got a frozen mango margarita (this was not on the happy hour menu), and it was excellent. 

Chips are given with salsa, bean dip & guacamole are extra $. Salsa is delicious. Full of tomatoes, spices, and a little heat. We also ordered the bean & cheese dip and it was just average and not worth $8. It was mostly mushy, refried beans with a large amount of cheese hidden in the middle. I don't think we even ate half of it. Entrees are decent. My fish tacos were full of flavor. Large amount of fish in each tortilla. Not much else on the taco that is worth fanning over. These were $14. My boyfriend loved his chicken tacos, but was not a fan of the carne asada tacos as they lacked flavor compared to other places. These dishes came with refried beans and rice, which I wish I would have known then we wouldn't have ordered the bean dip (I assumed we may have black beans or even refried beans that were not blended). The Spanish rice had a lot of flavor and were not dry like other restaurants. 

Ambiance is very modern. Darker setting with beautiful decor. Inside & outside seating. Part of the dining room is covered in a wallpaper with Lucha Libre athletes all over.

2228508,2018-03-11,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"The carne asada nachos were great, although a bit pricey $16. The meat was very tender and plentiful, and the toppings weren't skimpy. The extremely tiny crab ceviche tacos were not worth the $12, esp since it was advertised as king crab, when it wasn't even snow crab. It was imitation krab! The very distinctive stringy strands stood out to me immediately, and the overly fake sweet taste confirmed it. You get four tacos for $12, so for $3 for one bite, def not worth it.

You do get free chips and salsa, but the salsa tastes like your standard jarred supermarket variety. I'm sure the salsa trio that they charge for is better, or at least I hope so.

One of our table mates also was not happy that her $15 lemon drop didn't come with a lemon. I mean come on, it's in the name.

Service was awful. It was busy when we first got there, but later it cleared out and it was still next to impossible to get our check. The lady who had been checking in on us the entire time was standing by the bar watching the game. And when we were finally able to get her attention, she just points at the bartender, who is two feet away and doesn't even tell him we needed service. Just telling us with her eyes that she's not helping us. Then walks away. Apparently at that exact moment she was done watching the game. To be fair, the bartender did come and check up on us once during the meal. But had no idea he was the one that was to be taking care of us after that, since no communication with us about that was made.

Check came fast after that tho...and yet another guy came back to pick up the card.

Is there a reason why all the restaurants at the Red Rock are always changing out after a few months?! The one next door is new now too.

If I'm in the mood for nachos, I'll go to PKWY Tavern down the street. The meat isn't as good, but they are huge, hits the spot and all for $10.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,0,0,3,CFK5SUB1BtBBvcZK60PShg

2291714,2017-06-11,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"So after two separate outings I figured a review was finally deemed appropriate and how can I sum up in one word Libre? Libre you say? No, it's Libr-YAY!

As of this review I'd go as far as to say Red Rock houses the best Mexican food in Vegas (if proven wrong that food has got to be on point)! 

Before getting into the food I want to recognize the staff, which as we all know is equally as important as the food. From the hostess to the top you can feel the top notch quality they put into creating an ideal environment for all who ""wrestle"" their cuisine. 

During the first outing we went ham and sampled way too much, but did determine (for the humble price) the portion size well outweighed that by far. Their Mexican street corn comes with 4 cobs so sharing is certainly a possibility, but the happy tummy well you may want to share that internally. I admit I do get disappointed when I see it dressed with tajin because c'mon I go out to get something I can't necessarily get at home. Don't get me wrong it actually doesn't have a homemade feel with the abundance of cotija cheese and mayo (I was actually pleasantly surprised it curbed the tajin taste to an extent). Also on the outing was my choice of the chicken al pastor burrito which lead me to the 5 star rating: their green sauce. Total mic drop if there ever was one! As you can tell in the pictures the size is Goldilocks style (not too big or small, but just right) so Dessert can be had without feeling like you ate a Luchador! I did find the sauce for the pastor is actually one of the better ones I've had. It had a slight kick, but not overpowering and the green sauce was like a very rich cheese like after tone and that just blew me away. Equally as special was the hint of roasted pineapple for sweetness and tender consistency of the chicken itself. That is a highly recommended dish to say the least!

After a tease of shrimp from a shrimp taco my wife had during the first time there I was hell bent on getting their grilled shrimp burrito on my recent trip there and darned if that didn't walk out with the championship belt after my bell was rung. It's partnered with a pineapple salsa which I thought ""oh no a recycled sauce from the burrito?!?"", but no the experience was WAY different than before which I tip my sombrero to. No one wants the same experience twice (unless positive). Ha-ha. The shrimp though is far from scrimped (pardon the pun) on and between the perfect grilling and passionate seasoning packs quite the punch. Please give this a shot and you too will feel like El Jefe as the check arrives!

What I hold my head down for is not fully experimenting with their dessert menu. To date I have (much to the disappointment or our waiter and my wife) I chose the traditional Flan. Sorry if I'm a Flan connoisseur and don't follow a crowd when picking my meal, but next time for sure I am attacking the immensely popular cinnamon churro ice cream sandwich. As far as Flans go it was good, but to be fair I was not blown away by it (pains me to not be more impressed). The consistency is a bit thick and more mimicked the Flan my mother in law makes, but I personally prefer a softer Flan. I didn't quite taste kiwi, but was actually glad I didn't since I don't see why that'd be in a Flan (and that's even being an advocate for kiwi). All in all it was still a tasty way to wrap up the meal don't get me wrong, but their claim to fame is the ice cream sandwich so fine I'll conform on my next visit.

Whether it be plane, train, or automobile cruise over to Libre and you too can sway those hips to an A+ meal and exquisite culinary wonders!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,0,0,5,sp63Tk9ipOXhuIzKOeoqEA

I am a huge fan of restaurants with a Vegan Menu and although Libre's is short and sweet, it packs a great punch! The options were just what I was looking for, and the portions are huge! Enough for a second or third meal.

The service was a bit slow, coming in at 730 I expected that, however the management really made up for it as she took the time to greet each and every table to make sure all of our needs were met. Our server was polite and patient and made a great impression overall. 

The only reason for the four star rating is the fact that I am serious about my Mexican Corn. I feel that for the price they were offering it at, the portion and the taste did not compare.

Here's the scoop on this meal...the chicken in the quesadillas was excessively salty. My fish in my Mahi Mahi bowl tasted fishy/previously frozen. Prices are a bit high for Mexican but I'm willing to pay...especially for good Mexican....sadly this isn't good Mexican.  However the trio of salsas that I was given when I asked for hot salsas was quite nice! In fact, the tomatillo salsa although mild has a rich slightly roasted flavor. The habeñero salsa, unlike most, went beyond heat and added layers flavor often forgotten when it comes to HOT salsa. All of this means there's talent in this kitchen but perhaps they are stretched by financial limitations? Not sure....
The atmosphere is hip and kinda fun. I'm not sure how the full price margaritas are as I was here on a Thursday where $5 margaritas are on offer. If you want a cheap margarita...go for these. If you love a hand crafted, no sweetNsour margarita...pass on this. If you want elevated, creative, delicious Mexican at the same price, go to El Dorado!

I came for the pre opening dinner with some coworkers and must say that the restaurant came out great. It's a nice transition from Mercaditio. This was a pre-fixed menu so we got what we could. 

-Guac on point traditional style
-Chips tasted fresh
-Salsas were all good, but the house was so crisp and fresh, excellent!
-fundido was tasty but must be eaten quick before it hardens up! 
-meatballs were different. The sauce had a strong presence of what tasted like cumin or mace. So if that's not your thing, you won't like them! 
-I had the al pastor chicken tacos, strong on the cilantro and onion, but the chicken was seasoned nicely and fairly juicy. 
-corowrkers had the enchiladas and loved them. 
-dessert, churro ice cream sandwich with caramel. That was creative and delicious! 
-margarita was ON POINT. Not too much sour or tequila, literally leveled each other out, I was very happy!

Hostess were dressed nice and very polite. Sever was knowledgable and very friendly. Little mix up when delivering plates, but this was after all their way to work or all the kinks. I'd say for just opening, everything turned out really well. 

Theme is neat too, like a nacho Libre setup. 

Overall 4 stars, def worth checking out!",aF0x_jysPRIkR9O-qq8xuw,3,1,4,Bd74E9YSv8W8_Z8rq3R4cw

We came with another group, but this time it was only about 10 people. This time they did not have any record of our reservation. I guess the hotel takes the reservations when the restaurant isn't open, so it must have gotten messed up because of that. As always, we were told that they could do separate checks. Half of our bills were incorrect. My bill was only $2, so I should have just been happy about it, but like an idiot, I had to be honest. We told the server about the incorrect bills, so he took them and left for a while. When he returned, he gave us a single bill and basically told us that we had to figure it out. He was nice about it, but it is in poor taste to make it on the customer to figure out their mistake. The Manager didn't even come to apologize. Look, I get it. It can be a pain to do separate checks. If you can't do it, or if you don't want to, just say no. That way, we know it's up to us to figure it out from the beginning. If you have a group of 6 or more, don't come here. If it's just a you and someone else, it will probably be fine. I've been here 3 times with a group of 8+ and there has always been an issue with the service. I won't be doing that again.

Libre is an ""upscale"" Mexican cantina located in the Red Rock resort, and the food is good, but the price is a tad high. I came here after seeing a movie and decided to try this over Yard House. We shared the bean and cheese dip and an order of fajitas with lettuce wraps, $22 for the steak fajitas and almost $9 for bean dip. 

The steak fajita flavor was good, but it was a little on the salty side. The veggies were still crisp, and the steak was tender, this is a great option for sharing. The lettuce wraps needed to be doubled-up to hold the hot food, but when you're trying to be healthy, you can't scarf down three or four tortillas. 

The bean dip was... well bean dip. Not sure how they make it, but I have a feeling that ""Tostitos"" might be behind that chef's jacket. I normally hate it when people complain about price in their reviews, but when you charge $9 for what taste like canned bean dip, you got some splaining' to do. 

Like I said the food was good, but not enough for me to drive back to this side of town. I did get a free margarita with my Yelp check-in and which ""liberated"" me of feeling too bad for the price of food.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,33,17,3,Cw6U2Nn-5O2i4wFbwCqLzQ

I have made it a mission to spot out any and every one of them that can be classified as decent for me and my co-workers to go and enjoy great food and drinks. Finding places that have happy hour available on Saturday's can be a challenge just because there are soooo many that only offer on the normal Monday-Friday time period.

This past weekend my crew and I had the pleasure of heading over to the great Libre Mexican Cantina which is located inside of the Red Rock Hotel & Casino! I did some research on some of the places in my area that offered happy hour on Saturday's and come to find out I had actually already had this place bookmarked so why not right? When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised that there weren't very many people! This past weekend was super windy and slightly chilly but nothing crazy. I love places that offer patios to sit back and relax on while enjoying the drinks. 

When I arrived, I happened to be one of the first out of my group so I was told to pick actually anywhere out on the patio to sit and a serer would be right with me. The service here was actually really good and that always goes a long way in my book. A young lady greeted me and brought out my water just to start. Now at the time, they were offering a free house margarita with check-in so I also added that into the ordering rotation as i waited because were cutting happy hour kind of close . From my experience the check in margaritas at most places are either way too sweet or just not good at all since it is free. That was NOT the case with Libre! These margaritas were AMAZING and STRONG! YES! This is what I call a happy hour. Now it was time for ordering! The food is limited as far as the selection goes on the menu but literally everything we tried was delicious. We ordered damn near everything on the Happy Hour Menu:

Guacamole: Cilantro, Sweet Onion, Jalapeno

Chicken Nachos: Pickled Onions & Jalapenos, Arbol Sauce, Sour Cream

Mexican Street Corn Fritters: Cotija Crème, Poblanos, Grilled Corn

Cheese Quesadilla: Crispy Flour Tortilla, Mexican Cheese Blend

Shrimp Ceviche: Kiwi, Lime Mojo, Crispy Plantine 


Once the rest of my crew showed up, they followed suit and checked in and requested their drinks as well. We ended up double up on drinks so at one point we had about 8 margaritas coming out. Our server changed again and we got a really nice guy who was training another server so at this point we didn't know who to tip lol. Everybody was great!

The beef empanadas was flaky and savory with a little hot sauce dipping cart on the side. Also to start where they bring you a massive bowl of salsa and chips which tasted fresh and a tiny bit of kick.

I understand that this is a completely different restaurant than the former mercadito.

3301107,2016-04-14,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Ok this place used to be called Mercadito (cute Spanish word for Market) placed inside Red Rock. I'll tell you I loved it! For one, they had a nice selection of fresh tacos, even had the taco of the month. Their civiche was amazing, and the guacamole was out of this country amazing. I also loved that on Tuesdays they had industry night and gave a 50% discount (eventually coming down to 30%) but still, a highly recommended, fun and delicious Mexican restaurant.

So what happened? It closed down and was renamed and revamped. Apparently a new company or owners took over and added this weird art. My problem is the menu. All of a sudden they have Fajitas? I like faijtas but why change a menu that was popular?

This place would get packed back in 2015, we had to wait 40minutes but we knew it be worth it. So we walked in, on a Tuesday and was surprised to see it was kinda slow. And even more surprised to discover the menu was petite and the flavor wasn't out of this country. 

I'm conflicted, it's not that it tasted bad, and it's not that it's overpriced and I miss my discount. It's just not impressive anymore. The guacamole is ok, my girlfriend had some Mahi tacos and they were served on flour tortillas and she wasn't going crazy for them like before.

I miss my jalapeño Mexican Mac+cheese, and now there's nothing exciting to order.

In the end, it's worth a shot for just having a margarita and some chips and guacamole if that's your thing. Just bear in mind the food isn't anything to rave about.",v8r2uSz9-mj0mUVFX6cdCg,2,1,2,KjTmqhycMLUG2daXdmR73w

Ok no big deal, I understand they can't shampoo it everyday. We were kind of tightly squeezed, so we asked our server if we could move the empty table next to us down and connect them and he Said , ""yeah"", and he walks way and doesn't even do it for us, my elderly father had to get up and do it himself. So we were there at happy hour , it started at 4:00 , and it was 4:05 and we had no happy hour mentioned or no happy hour menu from our server that took our drink order. My mom asked if we could see a happy hour menu and the bus boy Said ""it's not happy hour"", so my mom Said ""Well when does it start"" and he Said ""at 4:00"" my mom said ""its  4:05"" . He then brought us the menus. We ordered 6 appetizers. At this point I never got my Pepsi , so I mentioned it to our server and he was such a smart ass, he Said ""you'll get your drink, don't worry"",with a huge attitude! I was embarrassed, so I said ""oh it's not a big deal, when you get a chance"". He walked away and I looked at my mom and said, ""oh this is gonna be fun""! So he brought the Pepsi and we got our appetizers. They were fine, no problems with them. He came around to take our dinner order and We all ordered fajitas , we were four people and he said they were big enough to to split, so we ordered two orders. He said if you pay and extra $4 they give you extra protein, lol, yeah right, we literally received two chunks of the mahi mahi and about 6 strips of steak! This was for both., like 4 tortillas for Both as well. No rice and beans at all, I mean for $26 you'd think you would get rice and beans included! The fajitas, I mean I have had better at many less expensive Mexican restaurant, the steak was dry, the flavors were sorta bland. The waiter had kind of an attitude the whole time, so I was afraid to say anything . We then ordered 2 desserts and split them as well. We never got drink refills unless we asked for them. What has happened to customer service? I was telling my mom while we were eating that there is no such thing as good customer service anymore, she said ""yeh I never expect it, so I'm not disappointed"".

The tortilla was flaky and buttery...almost too greasy. But was good. It had a flakiness that reminded me of a crossaint. Again it was good/ok. It was a little salty but I would probably order it again. The guacamole and chips also came with salsa. More than enough for 1 person. The salsa was very chunky and had hints of spice, lime and cilantro. Very good salsa imo. The guac was just mashed up avocado and had no real flavor.

Appetizers: Dinner kicked-off with a complimentary bowl of tortilla chips with a side of mild salsa, but we also ordered the Bubbling Queso Fundido. A hot skillet of cheese topped with a small scoop of guacamole, some pico de gallo, and what I believe were pickled onions. This was also served with a side of flour tortilla halves, which I could've done without -- it's better to eat this with the tortilla chips, in my opinion. 

Entree - Street tacos (Al pastor pork): Three individual tacos wrapped in foil and served with a side of chips, all in a bucket -- yeah, a bucket. I appreciate the creative twist in presentation, but a plate would've been practical. The bucket took up too much space on the table, and it's just odd eating from a bucket. Aside from that, the tacos didn't disappoint.

I asked them how they liked their food and almost all rated their food either a 4 or 5 out of 5. Some constructive criticism to the waitress and bus workers would be to  ask if the people are done eating before clearing a table.

We obviously expected a wait since it was the weekend but the hottest did offer us to sit in the bar or a text once a table was ready. Opted for text since it's easier but we did try to get seats at the bar section which was full so that option was out. Looking through the menu, all sounded appetizing. Ended up ordering a brown rice bowl with chicken, mango margarita and the churro ice cream. The bowl was decent. The chicken was seasoned but just lacked some flavor. Nor did it offer or the waiter didn't offer any salsa to add more flavor to the dish, sadly. The chicken to rice ratio was off. Had more rice than chicken. The cherry tomatoes was an interesting add and barely an corn in the bowl. Overall the brown rice bowl is fulfilling but the flavors did lack. Along with the mango margarita, I was hoping to get a wow of mango flavor so that was disappointing. For the churro ice cream , presentation and looks good but the textures of the churro was odd for me. It was grainy as if the dough wasn't  cooked all the way. My friends and I agreed that the ice cream part of the churro ice cream was the enjoyable part of it. Would I come back here anytime soon ? Probably not.

3498988,2016-11-11,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"This review is in regards to the AYCE tacos/tequila/margaritas. Vegas itself doesn't compare to Taco Tuesday's in California, but glad to see this place is starting the trend here! I came here for my first time on Taco Tuesday & boy was my assumption right. This place is dangerous! This included chicken, beef, and/or pork options. Since it's ayce, the soft tacos were basic. Nothing crazy We had to request for sour cream, limes, & tomatillo sauce on the side so our tacos weren't so flavorless or dry. Don't forget to request those in order to enhance your meal. The margaritas were chilled & neither on the rocks or frozen. They were strong though. The tequila shots at least came with lime, but no salt. It didn't taste like Jose Cuervo or anything cheap. The tequila earns 4 stars itself in my opinion. I'd say Libres' atmosphere & AYCE special is definitely worth the value. I'd come back for it because I'm a fan of both. I have friends who don't care for tequila so I don't think the $27 tacos would be worth it to them. The tacos start getting more satisfying after a few rounds (haha). One reason why I couldn't give 5 stars is for the super super slow service that night. I felt as if for every one request we had, we had to ask for it twice in order for our female server to remember. She would check on us, but man I don't think she listened well.

3517647,2016-10-23,3,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Created by the same company (Clique) that brought Hearthstone and Salute to Red Rock casino, Libre is a decent, if uninspired, Mexican restaurant. I actually prefer its predecessor, Mercadito, to this place. At least Mercadito had a unique variety of tacos. The menu at Libre is more run-of-the-mill Mexican designed to be approachable to the majority of the Summerlin palate. I imagine concepting meetings were filled with decision makers saying, ""make it as generic as possible!"" If that was the case, they've succeeded. There isn't much that makes Libre special or memorable.

Their appetizers are the only place with a glimmer of originality. The Mexican street corn fritters ($12), in particular, stood out. The deep fried balls had a thick, crunchy exterior covering a mixture of corn and topped with a cotija creme. The crispy taquitos ($11) were executed well, but not much different than what you'd find at any other Mexican restaurant.

Of course, you can't have a Mexican restaurant without fajitas, right? The quality of the steak ($24) they use is rather good and the plating is cool with its mini jars of salsa, sour cream, and cheese. But, the price may lead some to wonder why they didn't go to a neighborhood restaurant instead of one in a casino.

The execution of the food is solid, but the lack of original menu items may lead some to never try them. On the plus side, their menu calls out plenty of vegan items, gluten free dishes, and a kid's menu is available.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,9,5,3,ZYuMK5bKEqXcDIGDff_pcA

They quickly adapted to our growing party and were still fun  and professional up until the point where one of our guest had an allergy to the food. Before she began eating she asked the server if there were carrots in the food. He said ""no"". Without even asking the kitchen or a manager. He assured her there were no carrots that would affect her allergy as she explained. After two bites of her steak taco she saw the orange shreds of carrot in the food. She started having reactions immediately. She began scratching her arms and neck. Her throat swelled and her breathing became deep and shallow. We stepped outside and informed the manager as soon as we saw these signs. Red Rock security came to take reports on the situation and AMR came to the rescue confirming it was an allergic reaction. Libre claimed no fault and took no actions to even try to relieve the situation.

Waiter up sold us on 2 Guacs for the table of 4 adults. Too much if you're getting ACE tacos. Half way through my drink and about 15 minutes later, (so i wasn't gulping them down) I asked for a shot of tequila as my margarita was too sweet, so i was going to add the tequila shot. Was told I had to finish one drink before ordering another. Even when it took him 20 minutes to bring one drink. So how does this make sense? You'd rather me down a drink to get another shot than just bring me a shot, so i can enjoy the drink i already have and you're still brining me the same amount of alcohol you would if i downed it and you brought me a shot. I can see if people are ordering shot after shot, then maybe hold back. But it was my first cocktail, and I'd rather have a stronger, less sweet and take my time than down drink just to get another. And our waitress the first time we went was happy to oblige. I was half way through my drink and she brought me a shot to add to the drink. Simple. Happy customer, good drink, good service = return customer. This time, not so happy, service extremely slow, bad drink = unhappy customer that will not return for the ACE taco Tuesday.

Before you give a crappy rating, and if you go to a restaurants opening, go back after a month or two to see if what you don't agree with what has gotten better. It seems to me, people are butt hurt about closing of mercadito (whose drinks outweighed their crappy food tenfold) and not giving the actual food and drinks of libre, a rating that it deserves rather than the tit for tat a la mercadito.

So the lowdown. The hostess was super nice and gave options on where I wanted to sit, it's summer, IN VEGAS  and I don't do sum and heat so indoors it is. A booth. I was immediately greeted by my server Jo/Joe. Not sure how he spells it. Good service from the get go. I checked out the menu and noticed some healthy options for myself. Quinoa and cucumber with Apple salad. Amazeballz!!!! I had to ask what this dressing was because it was so yummy! I polished that off. It was Avocado Vinaigrette if you're curious.  Then I ordered a brown rice bowl with well done chicken because I love my chicken well done. Another great choice! I finished all the chicken and most of that too. I wish I had a third stomach.

3958341,2017-06-30,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I think this place is such a great little spot and reasonably priced. It's not the most authentic Mexican food I have ever had but it is flavorful, fresh, and tasty! I look forward to the chips and salsa the most here. The chips taste buttery almost which I'm sure is not good for you but it is so good to you! Then their salsa is just the perfect balance of fresh flavors and slightly with a kick which makes you want more and more. I ordered the restaurant week dinner special for $30 and I got the guacamole as a starter, steak fajitas, and the churro ice cream sandwich for dessert. Great deal and the guacamole is to die for! The touch of cotija cheese on top just makes it that much creamier! I could eat a tub of that daily! Then the steak fajitas come out sizzling and I just love the way it is presented. The fajita plate is placed on a wooden tray with little grooves for 3 separate condiment areas for cheese, sour cream and then the pico, And a side of tortillas. The churro ice cream I thought was ok. The churro has like a vanilla flavoring to it but the ice cream wasn't frozen enough so it basically was a semi cold cream that melted quickly. I think I prefer it on the side next time. We had a nice waiter and the hostesses were pleasant too. Enjoyed my experience and meal and shout out to the bus boys there who refill the water and clear the plates. They are super hard working and on point.

3972784,2016-03-14,11,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Can Mexican restaurants not course their service properly?  This is the second in two weeks when I was enjoying my appetizer when my main course was brought.  Next time, I'll order my courses separately.

I had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived about 3 minutes early.  I was seated in the section away from the far and closest to the casino.  The artwork of lucha libre wrestlers is quite different and it's colorful even if you don't know what it's about.

I was promptly brought the iced tea I ordered and I studied the menu for a minute or two.  My server, brittany--a delightful woman--came by and asked if I had any questions.  When I asked about the meatballs as an appetizer for one person, she explained that it would be fine.  She showed me the size of the meatballs using her fingers and I went with that.  I ordered the chicken machacados for my main course.

In a short time, a runner brought the meatballs.  As I was eating the second one, another runner came with my main course.  What is wrong with this picture?  I finished the meatballs and then enjoyed the chicken.  The chicken consisted of pounded, grilled chicken breasts with a tomatillo sauce and poblano chilis.  A very flavorful dish.

Lest one think that I was taking so many photos and spending too much time on my phone, here's the data.  I was seated just about 5 PM.  I was finished with my appetizer and main course at 5:23.  That's much too fast.  I don't want to wait a half hour for my food, but with a restaurant that wasn't full and had no waiting line, this was ridiculous.

For dessert--ordered separately after the dishes were cleared--I got the churro ice cream sandwich.  It was made with two pieces of churro with vanilla gelato in the middle.  There was a small container of melted chocolate which made the dessert richer.  It was quite good.

To put the time in context, I had from the above mentioned 5:23 until 5:45 when I left to order my dessert, pay the check, and leave.  There was more time with the last part of the meal than any other time.  It's a shame because the food is good and my server was good.

This is so close to being a 2 star review for the run on service with the appetizer and the main course.  If I come back, I'll order each course separately and space it myself.

Edit:  In my review, I forgot to mention the generous amount of complimentary salsa and chips brought shortly after you're seated in Libre.  I especially liked the wide nature of the bowl of salsa because it makes dipping a chips easy.  It's so much easier than small containers some places use.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,24,14,3,7lTMkXBr6rsOAQe2zeMTIg

I was happy to see a vegan portion of the menu although I did not order from it. Maybe next time! We received our drinks and chips and salsa promptly after we sat down from our friendly, attentive waiter. We also had free guacamole from checking in. All was delicious.

Two of us ordered the Achiote Chicken Street Tacos ($14), one ordered the Al Pastor Pork Street Tacos ($16), and one ordered the Breakfast Burrito ($12) with green sauce. Everything was really good. My only complaint is more pickled veggies and lime wedges! I like to load street tacos up with spicy carrots and lime. But no worries, our server brought me out some extra when I asked.

The place is pretty cool looking inside, really modern and colorful. The seating was comfortable, and worked well for small parties. The music and ambience were great, and we could still hear each other. 

As for the food, you have a choice between the chicken or carne asada tacos (no substitutions or alterations, like no onions etc.), but the tequila is limited to the Casa Amigos. The tacos were tasty enough,  but I preferred the asada over the chicken. You start out with 3 of one kind of taco,  then you can order more one at a time. Shots come out consistently, as quickly as you take em. Overall I felt it was a good deal at $24,especially considering the prices of the other foods on the menu

It was easy to find from the front parking lot. I had made a reservation just in case it got busy on a Saturday night. When we arrived, the hostess greeted us and told us that our table was getting set up so it'll be a few minutes. 

I took off 2 stars because A) the service wasn't all that great B) the food wasn't to exciting either. I say the service wasn't all that great because the hostesses weren't very welcoming. Didn't ask if we've been there before, how our night was going, etc. I've worked at a hotel for 9yrs before and customer service was always top priority. Our server wasn't very enthusiastic either. She had went over two menus. One for the restaurant week that was going on and the original menu. My wife had asked about the restaurant week, what that was all about since we didn't know. Our server didn't give us a very good answer. It was as if she had to give us the menu, but didn't know nor care to know what it was all about. My wife even said after she left ""if this menu was to help feed the homeless, don't you think you would be a little more knowledgeable and enthusiastic on selling more of that menu then the original menu?"" Since it was going to a good cause. My wife works at a restaurant herself and said she would've put more emphasis on the menu for restaurant week. 

The food came out fairly quick. I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't all that great. Juan's Flaming Fajitas or even Matador is more flavorful than Libres dishes. In my opinion. It was just bland.

I would definitely come back and try something new, if not just order appetizers. The service was great.

I understand is Cinco De Mayo and is extremely busy at the time, but however I was there to celebrate my birthday and a dear friend's birthday, not for Cinco De Mayo. Not only did we received two phone calls before the reservation and said we'll be charged a 25 for each person if we canceled and on top of the that we had a two hour limit. I never been to an establishment where there was a time frame, I thought that was extremely rude. With that said I expected excellent service. It took us about 20 minutes to received our drinks. Since we had a time frame to leave I thought they would be a little quicker than that. Our server was nice but it took him a long time to get back to the table. The food was excellent that's the reason I gave it 3 stars. When we left the patio is where we sat was completely empty. So my question is why did we have a two hour time frame? My husband and I drop $400 in this establishment. And I couldn't believe the unprofessionalism of Libre. I really enjoy the food. Is probably one of the best Mexican food in Vegas.

I think it's a great deal but I honestly got full really quick from the margaritas and tacos. In addition to that, the taco is, at best, decent. I wouldn't come here on a regular day to order the tacos from Libre, but I'll sure as hell eat them since they're included in the Taco Tuesday deal. I definitely think this Taco Tuesday deal is for an excuse to drink moreso than to eat a bunch of tacos.

Although the staff were all very friendly, the service was 3.5/5 at best. The service was a little slow, but moreso, they messed up on the orders quite a bit.

4411765,2016-08-11,2,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I've never even once considered leaving a review for an establishment  based solely on service but considering I wasn't even able to try the food, I decided to make an exception in this case.

First off let me say that I was invited to a Tacos and Tequila event in which we were supposedly able to sample some free tacos. I immediately jumped on the chance to attend because contrary to popular opinion, I actually enjoyed the former restaurant Mercadito and its all you can eat tacos and was excited to finally try the spot that replaced it. 

We waited for exactly an hour and the only thing we got to sample was their water (5 stars for the water by the way, very refreshing) because it was extremely packed and an unorganized mess. It was an every-man-for-himself situation where people fought for tacos. 

Yes it was supposedly free food and generally I wouldn't even bother leaving something negative but when you plan your day around an organized event and you dream of tacos all day long it's kind of hard not to end up disappointed. The nail on the coffin is that the servers kept promising that ""more tacos are being made in the back"" only to say that after another 40 minutes of waiting that ""there will be no more tacos brought out.""

All the while this was happening, the management team was blankly staring at all of us optimistic people waiting for what would never come.

In retrospect, it would of just been nice to have a simple notification from the management saying something along the lines of ""I'm sorry we didn't anticipate this"" or ""I'm sorry, there are no more tacos."" We would of left disappointed but understanding of what happened and even just dined regularly (oh man was I craving tacos).

Instead, the management, fully aware of those patiently waiting, did nothing but stare at all of us.

I think the art inside of restaurant lured me in too. I have a weakness for themed restaurants.  I wish the waiters and waitresses had outfits to go with the theme of the restaurant.  I think that would be fun! 

We started with the guacamole which is good sized. Then I ordered the shrimp burrito. I liked the sauce in the burrito but I thought there was too much. When I bit into it the sauce came squirting out of  the burrito. It  eventually started breaking apart. I would order it again but see if they can go lighter on the sauce.

We had the Churro ice cream sandwich for dessert. The churro wasn't soft it was hard which made it hard to bite into. Everything else about the dessert was good though!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,2,3,Ab_EJ9RPQcpVbiO3Aw4LBA
4492099,2016-11-11,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Everything was good, but somehow I was just a hair disappointed.

We used the yelp offer to get a free order of chips & guacamole. The chips were really good. The guacamole was pretty average.

We also got an order of the Mexican Street Corn Fritters. It was one of the menu items that put this place on my radar, so I had really high hopes for them. First, our server warned us that they were more like hushpuppues than fritters, and he was right. Fritters are typically crispy, and these were definitely more doughy/bready. They were a good size and portion. I really enjoyed the cheese sauce they came with, but I really didn't get flavors of street corn...or really much corn flavor for that matter. I think my expectations were too high so I was disappointed. Again, they weren't bad, but they could have been great.

For entrees we had the Carne Asada steak & Carnitas. My husband raved about the Carnitas melting in your mouth. My Carne Asada was, also, tender and cooked nicely. Which was good because they never brought me a steak knife. The grilled onions and peppers on top of the steak had a pickled flavor I wasn't expecting. The chimichurri sauce was really good, too. Both dishes were served with red rice and refried beans.

For dessert we had the Churro Ice Cream Sandwich & the Flan. Both of these were excellent! The best part of the meal.

Overall, I would give this place a solid C. Not terrible, but nothing outstanding. Just average. I might go again if I was at Red Rock, but I wouldn't drive across town for it. I thought it was a hair pricey for what it was. You could pay half as much at an authentic hole in the wall and have better food.

I ordered the the Carne Asada street tacos ($16) and a frozen Margherita. A few minutes after they brought tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were very thin and broke when you tried to scoop up some salsa. Most were already broken in the can that they place them in. My Margarita arrived and after one sip I almost spit it out. It tasted as if someone used a full cup of Country Time instant lemonade to make the drink . It was putridly SWEET! I tried to get the servers attention, but the Manager arrived first. I asked if I could have a Heineken instead, and they said ok. A few minutes later the server comes back and says sorry, we don't carry Heineken.  REALLY! IN RED ROCK? OK, so I ordered a Pacifico instead. The tacos came at the same time as the beer. There were 3,very small soft tacos with maybe 4 or 5 small cubes of very salty tough beef and very soggy shredded cabbage,placed on a bed of more tortilla chips?? There was a small ramekin of maybe 5 pieces of diced onion and pepper, and another which contained what tasted like Frank's Hot Sauce! 
This meal was the most pathetic example of Mexican food that I have ever ate! I should have went to Rubios in the food court for a much better meal, at a third of the price! They could have at least used beef tenderloin and served it with rice and beans. Also they should have doubled up on the tortillas or used something that wasn't as soggy as the cabbage that they used, the tacos literally fell apart when I picked them up.

4554846,2018-04-27,1,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Compared to their almost identical restaurant, Borracha at Green Valley, this place just really missed the mark for me. A friend and I came here to watch the Golden Knights game since they had a promotion going on which I saw on Facebook. I initially got a bad impression when we told the hostess we wanted to sit anywhere that we could watch the game and she first placed us facing the opposite way from a TV. 

For food is was just so so for me. We had the chip and salsa to start off and I wasn't loving the flavor of the salsa much, it needed more spice. For an entree I had the Shrimp Ceviche. I liked the uniqueness of the plantains instead of tostadas, but the flavor was just alright. 

Another thing that really bugged me about this place was the fact that their advertisement said free shots of tequila with every vgk goal and when I asked our waitress about it she wasn't even sure of what the promotion was and had to check with the manager. I feel like if you have a promotion running, you should probably be knowledgeable about it and proactive. They also advised that the sound for the game was only available in the bar area which was another thing the hostess left out when she was seating us. 

I don't think I'd come back here again. There's plenty of other Mexican restaurants in the area with better food and better service.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,5,1,2,PYMpHUqjTfugwx-AyMB-SA

Tacos y Tequila Tuesdays: $24 all you can drink tequila and all you can eat tacos.  What? Yes.  I do want to clear some things up though - the all you can drink tequila is just that - tequila shots. Not margaritas, not tequila cocktails, just straight tequila.  It's good tequila - but you've been warned; it can turn into a BIG night fast.  The tacos are delicious (I recommend the steak over the chicken), but I can't really eat more than 3 tacos, so the all you can eat doesn't appeal to me as much as it may to others.  (Ok...that's a lie - I CAN eat more than 3, but I probably shouldn't.)

Cinco de Mayo: We walked right up and got a table on patio. OKAY!! (Lil John not included.)  Granted, they told us we only had 90 minutes, but that worked for our timeline.  We had the house guac and salsa, as well as the chicken fajitas  - all were very tasty!

On to the cocktails: Sangria = a winner. If you've seen any other reviews of mine, you'll know that I love a good Sangria, but I HATE when Sangria is too heavy with juice.  This Sangria was light, flavorful, and refreshing.  EXCELLENT.  Their cocktails are all well-balanced and fresh, nothing tasted overly sweet or overly tart - including Pepino Picante (my favorite - a cucumber marg with a hint of spice), the other spicy cocktail whose name I can't remember, and of course, the Margaritas. 

Definitely check this place out - whether it's for Taco Tuesday or any other day of the week.  It lives up to the hype.  Lastly - THANK YOU Libre for bringing me Margaritas within stumbling distance of my place. :)",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,4,3,5,HWVGf8BbMKw-NBEpDXwTyQ

My dining partners had the fish tacos and quesadillas and were very happy. I ordered vegan chile rellenos which was very attractive and tasty. My only criticism comes from the vegan nachos. Although vegan, they looked little more than chips with cheese. I'd suggest a sprinkling of enchilada sauce, some sliced olives and sliced jalepenos topped with guacamole or vegan sour cream.

They changed their ingredient profile and made it much more fresh and high class. The chicken taquitos were amazing. Loaded with cheese on top they were just divine. I also received free chips and guacamole with my Yelp check-in which was delicious as well. The guacamole was fresh as was the pico de gallo. It's nice to sit on the patio at night.

4786339,2016-08-19,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"Manager is useless.  Before you get the details, let's go through what was done well.

Sitting at the bar. Our bartender is great (long black hair, tall, slim, named Aja/Asia?) and really doing a terrific job to be attentive. 

Our food came out quickly on a Thursday evening (7:30pm).  

Shrimp veracruz has a delicious salad and rice.  There are around 12-15 pieces of midsized shrimp for the order.

The Mahi Mahi fajitas tastes great but there wasn't a lot of fish for $24.  It does not come with rice so you're essentially making your own tacos (grilled Mahi mahi, onions, peppers with jars of Pico de Gallo, fresh sour cream, and shredded cheese).

Male bartender (white button up semi see through short sleeve) was smack talking the female bartender when she stepped away to check on our order.  Not sure why he thought customers sitting in front of him couldn't hear it but he he tried to get the other Asian bartender upset about her leaving her station and leaving him alone etc. Basically they are bro-ing it up behind the bar and talking smack about their coworkers but smile in their face.

Biggest problem, the manager. He has not stopped texting since we've sat down for the past 40mins.  He's not managing his staff, helping serve, or coordinate.  In fact, 40 mins ago, our server asked him to change the channel to the NFL game.  30mins later, when she followed up, he told her ""have the customer look up on their phone what channel the game is on and I'll change it.""  Um, excuse me!? For a man who hasn't stopped texting on his phone or failing miserably at hitting on his service staff / bartender, he has some galls.

Overall, food is not bad and you're paying a casino premium. Service to the customer is pretty good but their biggest problem is the staff here clearly don't get alone with each other and their conversations as well as disagreements spill over to the customers' experience.  I would implore RRC to come in with better management to get their personnel under control.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,5,0,2,-31jUGqRNyLtSSmAMK8RCg

The waited was awesome, but that's about all I can say was exceptional. 

Firstly- the ""immediate service guacamole""-  can taste the processing of it, it's bland, fake tasting and definitely not freshly made-  a good fresh guacamole takes 5-7 minutes to make properly.  This tasted like it was scooped out of a plastic tub from the grocery store.

The mahi mahi tacos I ordered were ok- nothing to get excited about.

My wife ordered steak fajitas- those were actually pretty darn good, very tasty, but had lots of fluid in the skillet with it so the vegetables got soggy after a couple minutes.  Also, their tortillas were not held in a steam pot so wishing a minute of removing from the wrapper they got very hard.

As far as the service (sitting outside)....our server was super sweet but starting off she was very lagging. She seemed busy b/c we witnessed her running from a table to the inside of the restaurant throughout our entire dining experience until the crowd started to die off.  The drink service was awful. It never lined up simultaneously with our food. We finished our 1st order of chips n salsa, hadn't received our 1st round of drinks, hadn't placed our order yet and considered just leaving.

With this place, I'd be surprised if it stuck around as well. It's very overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. These are strip prices, even for the drinks. 

It's a cool place with cool decor. The music was all reggae. Which is pretty bizarre. 

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which they don't have on the menu. So they charged us for individual ones. They were pretty good. Lots of tequila, if that's what tickles your fancy. 

For the food:

I had the Carne Asada fajitas. They were again, just okay. For paying $24 for about 4-5oz of decent steak is pretty meh. If it was really high-quality meat, I could see the price being reasonable. But they sure did pack on triple the number of onions and peppers. 
The tortillas aren't homemade. 
We also had a shrimp burrito. It's like something you'd get at a fast food place. Nothing worth spending that much for a burrito. It also comes with pre-cooked rice. 
Pre-cooked rice is my nemesis. I don't understand why restaurants use that stuff. It's very displeasing to the taste buds.

Everything came out just fine except for my son's order. He didn't get the street tacos as we had ordered and received a kids meal with the rice and on a flour tortilla instead. They were kind enough to fix the mistake and give him a few corn tortillas on the side. No biggie.

I loved the house-made salsas, the variety of tacos, the cocktails and the service. I wanted to experience Libre with an open mind, but in my first visit tonight, it does not live up to my Mercadito experiences at all. I'm so disappointed that Red Rock chose to mess with a good thing.

Kim was my server at the bar and was great. The rest of the bar staff was nice and accommodating as well, which was good because the kitchen was running really slowly. (I placed an order for cheese enchiladas and still didn't have them 45 minutes later.) The bar staff kept checking on my order and apologizing. They even brought me more chips and salsa. Kim also made me a very nice house margarita. So, even though I miss Gus, Ryan and the Mercadito bar staff big time, this new staff seems to be trying hard.

Chips and the house salsa were fine. It was a chunky type of salsa that had good hints of cilantro, onion and lime. It wasn't much different than the salsa I've had at other fair-to-good Mexican restaurants, but it was tasty. (However, I liked Mercadito's salsas much better.) However, my entree - the cheese enchilada - was another story. The entire plate tasted like it had been drenched in salt, and I'm a person who likes salt. It was so salty that I kept gulping water and couldn't eat it all. I finally realized that the red enchilada sauce drizzled over the top was the culprit. Once I scraped the sauce off, I could at least eat some of the enchilada, but the rice and beans on the plate also tasted like they had been overly salted. The salt in the red sauce on top overpowered the flavor of the cheese and the nice avacado/sour cream sauce that made up part of the dish. I'm not sure if a chef simply had a heavy hand with the salt in the kitchen tonight, or if the salt is part of the normal preparation for this dish, but I know I will not take the chance of ordering it again. 

It looks like Libre has a decent happy hour, and some people around me ordered the shrimp ceviche and liked it. The mini crab tacos also looked flavorful, and I didn't hear anyone near me complaining about them. I'm sure I will go back for drinks and snacks and probably happy hour, but I'll be wary of ordering full entrees for dinner.",z7VqnBoR_MpN4YS37unzTA,3,0,3,N3C0IuYwhE_sYo16abmDfA

Disclosure: we were in love with Mercadito. We went often, savoring the taco varieties, the guacamole, and excellent salsas. Mercadito was a tough act to follow. 

And Libre failed. 

The food tastes exactly like the type of Mexican food people try making at home -- or even worse, it's like Taco Bell. Something about the shredded cheese and lettuce tastes incredibly unauthentic. You cannot charge $18 for tacos like this. (At least with Mercadito you had the option of lobster and sea bass)

The guacamole is plain. The chips lackluster (and only filled halfway). Salsas were probably the only halfway decent thing. 

""Traditional tacos"" are served with rice and beans. Both sides are disappointing. The rice over salted. The beans an unidentifiable mush. Incredibly annoying: you can't substitute one taco for another, or even flour or corn tortillas. You are committed to your unoriginal, uninspiring plate of tacos. 

It's entirely tragic Libre replaced Mercadito.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,16,9,1,_9FBQievGuU5y9mGZSjhJg

5556384,2016-08-10,2,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"This place has the most horrible customer service I have ever experienced. First off, they held a ""Complimentary Tacos & Tequila"" event yesterday and it was completely unorganized from the get go. I overheard the hostesses discussing how the restaurant only expected 40 people to show up but there ended up being about 100+ so they did not have enough tacos or drinks for anybody. Mind you, you had to have reserved a ticket ahead of time before attending the event and you would think that they would've looked at the numbers of how many people registered, but I guess they failed to do so. So there was not enough margaritas and tacos for anyone at ALL. 

Second, they completely LIED to everyone there saying ""we're making a new batch of tacos and it'll be out soon."" Only a handful of people actually got a taco or two and the rest of us were waiting. 30 minutes go by, I already saw many people were leaving but I was hopeful and continued to wait. The event was only for an hour and it started at 6pm so when it came to 6:58pm, we asked a busser to be honest with us and ask are they even bringing out the tacos at all? He said: ""Oh no sorry guys we're not bringing out anymore tacos."" So they made all these people wait based on a lie, FOR NOTHING? At least have the decency to tell us you don't have enough food for this event you're hosting! 

I understand the event is ""free"" and we can't really complain, but actually stick to your word if you're gonna host an event that people are expecting something out of it. They also gave actual dine in customers the priority of service and acted like the people at this event were second in customer service. No one came up to our table at all and the hostesses were rude whenever we asked questions. People were complaining and leaving the restaurant upset because there was no sense of direction and professionalism with this restaurant and the fact that they lied and made people wait for nothing makes it so much worse.

Next time they host an event like this, they should actually treat their customers with respect and don't lie to our faces; also they should be more organized and actually have enough food and drinks that people were expecting. This place is ridiculous and their customer service is horrendous.",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,6,1,1,MTqtaiwGmWZ8D1unHMJ-lg

Though the hostesses were a bit snooty about it.  Many of the restaurants at Red Rock seem to had snooty hostesses.  Not sure why. It certainly doesn't give a good first impression.

We waited about 15 minutes for a table and got sat to the left of the entrance.  This was perfect as the rest of the restaurant was open to the outside and it was very hot out.  You would have been sweating if you were at the other end.

Our waiter was attentive and came around often. He also brought out menus instead of the hostess doing it.  Not sure I like that as we did sit for a few minutes without them.  The busser kept our water glasses filled and brought chips and salsa quickly  I loved their chips and salsa.  The salsa was flavorful with a little heat but not too hot.  

For entrees, we all had fajitas.  They were served in these long plates which were a bit hard to maunever but the food was great.  Lots of onions and peppers with the meal.  Then sides of sour cream and shredded cheese.  There was choice of flour tortillas, corn tortillas or lettuce wraps.  We all went with flour tortillas.  They were on the smaller side which allowed you to eat more of them.

I had the red wine sangria.  It was tasty but could have been colder.  It actually tasted warm until the ice cubes cooled it off but the flavor was good.

Al Pastor Chicken Burrito: The chicken had little flavor and it comes with filler that resembled cole slaw. Should be called the 'Chicken and Cole Slaw Wrap'. Avoid ordering this until they grasp the concept of Al Pastor and burrito. 

Crispy Dynamite Shrimp Taco: The most expensive appetizer at $19. It's actually comprised of three tacos (plural) and they are the size of Polly Pocket tacos (size of a folded slice of Bologna). Tasted very good though.

5654075,2017-04-22,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I hesitated on the yelp review, I dislike not giving a place a few tries first. I thought maybe it was an off-night for the waitress. But then I realized the couple who sat down by us were experiencing the same and this was not out of the ordinary. 

Like them, we waited a bit for our drink orders, then... our drinks. Thankfully we ordered our dinner at that time or I'm afraid it would've been another 10/15 min. After we ordered and had been there for almost 20 min, we were told we'd be getting chips and salsa. Then we got water. (Usually that comes first, but no big deal) after another ten the waitress came by and saw we didn't have chips.. Long story short everything took a ridiculously long time. 

We noticed the couple seated by us consistently looking behind them for their waitress. They too seemed frustrated at the wait for more than one item. It wasn't that busy, in fact we seemed to have a hard time finding any staff at all. 

It was a Friday night we weren't rushing and it was lovely outside, but the experience overall was subpar. The food was ok. Nothing like Mercaditos. 

My biggest frustration was having to eat my rice with chips until it was almost half gone because we couldn't locate any staff who could bring us silverware. If I'm spending $80 for tacos and drinks I want a fork.. 

They also dropped a portion of our side dish on the way to the table and another 15 min later brought back one tiny piece to compensate. No I'm sorry or anything -in fact nothing was said they just dropped the plate off and walked away.. 

The staff we interacted with for the most part were nice, the hostesses were very pleasant. Not enough substance for a return visit. No doubt there's room for improvement in several areas.  :/",boqxGXXD1_roAd7RSYwAYg,7,0,2,4nLMej-cpypgiS04_qMliw

We had chips and salsa which were pretty good and salsa wasn't too spicy. We also ordered the chicken fajitas which were my favorite entree. The chicken wasn't dry and came to the table sizzling. I do recommend asking for extra tortillas though. 3 aren't enough. We also had the corn fritters which were ok. For the chips and salsa, fajitas, corn fritters, 2 beers and a margarita it came out to about 50 dollars. Not bad for all that.",oZ9NBQVAIXhTAUlUIPRBsQ,2,1,4,zn60mjFFbpnX26QF1HAmiw

Unfortunately, I never got the chance to try any margaritas or entrees at Libre, but I already decided that I'll never return to this restaurant after experiencing an unacceptably abysmal lack of service by its staff. 

Three of us waited 20 min (according to Yelp's check in timer) before leaving out of frustration because the drinks we ordered were never made, the chips that the waiter expressly promised to serve in just 2 minutes were never dropped off, and we didn't get an opportunity to order any food items because the waiter ghosted us. 

For entertainment, we got to watch all the nearby tables get their drinks, their food, and their subsequent orders in while our table was continuously overlooked. Perhaps the restaurant was understaffed, but it wasn't very busy either; there were three other occupied patio tables when we took a seat around 4pm. The only helpful staff member was the guy refilling waters; he repeatedly stopped by our table to keep our glasses full. However, this was not enough to stymie the ongoing attrition of our hunger for food, spirits, and the waiter's attention.

The bar was packed, I'm not sure if it was the manager I asked if it was ok to grab a table. He right away put one together for me. The resturrant was busy. I think that's amazing custumer service. 5",uz1_cds7yyehTPYnrArdYA,0,0,5,9Fcv-e7tbQApA7ypltqE8Q

Nothing special about menu and prices leaned towards expensive for a location targeted to locals. Service was worse than average as we often felt like an afterthought. 

Need to try their unlimited taco and margarita night before I draw my final conclusions.",imUgKz_a1y8gWkDw8btwgA,1,0,2,_1-O6WFkkr_NfNWWs2E1KA

The food was rich with flavor and the chips and salsa were perfect. Table side guacamole was tasty but could have used more salt for my liking. The taco plate was delicious. I had three steak tacos which were cooked perfectly. My husband had the chili relleno which he said was cooked as it should be. The outer shell was crispy with a flavorful soft, tender and juicy inside. He also had a side of corn which was light and a nice addition to the main dish. I do wish that he menu had more options. For this type of restaurant I think that the items were reasonably priced. Definitely adding this place into the regular rotation of eateries. Also they do have vegetarian options. We finished our meal flan. It was a bit heavier than other flan that I have had but it wasn't too sweet and tasted as flan should. The decor is really neat and the wait staff was attentive and professional at all times. Excellent experience overall.",kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,0,5,YBL15Ba9XENl_I9JnPPyEw

Why is it before she didn't offer me the wait list. She finally seats me it takes 3:32:07 mins for them to bring me a menu but they sat the people after me and they received a menu right away and water. Then the waitress goes to the table and takes there order after me. It take her 9:35:33 minutes to come ask if I want anything I was here before the table next to me but she went to them first. I ordered guacamole and salsa on the menu it says chips or veggies she didn't even ask which I wanted she just rushed by. I ordered my salsa and guacamole before the table next to me they literally ordered there's 3 minutes after me be received it before me mine came a minute later literally a minute. The waitress refuses to check on us she just checked on the table next to me. Still haven't received my ice tea but the next table got their beer. I just talked to the people to the left of me who have finished eating they ordered a beer they say ""20"" Mins ago and she just brought it. I just got my food and it was chicken instead of steak and shrimp. The salsa here has no flavor. The traditional tacos are bland but I do recommend the sizzling platter the chicken taste better. The steak is to chewy but the shrimp makes up for the steak. I can't find the server to get my check. The server was Cat. I don't recommend her at all. I asked her assistant to get the check Cat comes and asked did I want the check and was I finished. The walks away to go get the check. Comes back to clean off the table and still no check. After asking 3 times I finally get the check while I'm talking to the manager Danielle. I made her aware of that  the server didn't even card my friend.",b9ncqgPDrh9pZQ3n-IfW7Q,0,0,1,VuftViFY9KI8Wk9l-WxkYA

5876263,2018-01-03,8,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,"I've only ever sat at the bar here and it's always been a great time. The margaritas go down easy, the vibe is cool, and the patio view vibes are strong.

My favorite dish here is the Dynamite Shrimp Tacos. They are served with a jicama *tortilla*. A thinly sliced, cold, and crisp jicama pairs with the warm and tender battered shrimp. The sauce is divine and makes this a no-share dish for me. The guacamole is hit or miss for me - either chunks of avocado or it's mixed until smooth. EIther way, the chips, and salsa are a saving grace.

I have yet to experience the dining room because I'm into the type and level of service I've experienced at the bar.

Oh, and the flan. I'm not worthy! My apologies go to this dessert because I never knew it could be this good. I've always said I don't care much for flan - that was until I had it here. It's creamy and rich, similar to a creme caramel. It's heaven.

5879946,2016-03-09,0,lvuuyYZ-CzFrg1BLdV2OPw,This is my second week in a row going to Libre. Both times we have had Michelle who is an excellent server. She has a vast understanding of the menu and has great understanding of detail and customer service. The $25 special all you can eat and drink on Tuesday might be the best happy hour available in Las Vegas and is run by one of the best managers in Young Lee. He not only addresses every table but also cares to learn every customers name. This was an excellent experience I will tell everyone I know as well as continue to keep visiting.,oeBfJa2tibHBWKazCo6NcQ,0,0,5,B7Pq48yFknIIQwsSZCwbMA

Strip prices is one accurate comment. Entrees are around $20 and they still charge for chips 'n salsa. Stop the madness! 

The yelp check in offer for guac 'n chips is awesome. The guac is tasty and is a huge serving.
The happy hour $6 margarita is great. Regular prices for margs start at $10. Also on the plus side, I love the patio. The music isn't my taste, but I'm used to that! Patio decor is what I call ""Red Rock chic"". It's bright, festive and comfortable. 

The misters were going on the patio and the atmosphere was perfect for happy hour and a little beyond. Service was attentive and we didn't have to worry about going thirsty thanks to this! Our server also mentioned the Monday & Friday ""extended"" happy hour deals from 4-7, which includes bottomless marg's for $10.
