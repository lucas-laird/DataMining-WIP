Their exceptional customer service was greatly appreciated. As soon as I walked in the door they made me feel extremely welcomed. They all had smiles on their faces which was a nice change to what I usually encounter at other food establishments. I was lucky enough to meet the owner, and he was absolutely phenomenal! He was hands on and worked will his team. You can tell he cares about each and every customer. He treated them like family. He made sure no one left dissatisfied or disappointed. I was so impressed with my experience, I knew I had to write a review to let everyone know about this location. As for the food, it was excellent and the presentation made it more irresistible. My sandwich was great. You can definitely taste the freshness in the veggies and the bread.This is truly what makes a establishment worth coming to. I will never eat at another Subway again!!",3Qj5HOnjaI6PfitlvneBug,1,1,5,R7i0Cd9jhbsASJdiIjt-aQ

This particular Shop is in the top 5% of the nation as far as we are concerned The meats are high quality, well kept and well sliced.  Veggies are definitely fresh, crisp, well cleaned and displayed. The folks who make the Subway Sandwiches are very pleasant and work very fast to give you what you want and how you want it. The shop is always clean and fresh. It makes you confident, happy and proud to be a customer. The Subway Sub Makers actually know my Wife by name and what she is going to order. This is one of the very best in the chain.",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,2,2,5,jcaNx4_iIoaK7z10TzfXUg

4600531,2013-12-22,2,avBS62WEvwWyoDWBXAlxmg,"I have been to a lot of subway's. 
And my sandwich is always made in the same fashion.

Bread, meat, cheese, veggies.
And then out the door. 

Let me ask, what is better, a sandwich made by your parent, or when you make it yourself?  
My Answer: my grandmother! 

Why? Love! That's why. The care and compassion that goes into food. Some may say, its just a chain , but no! Its the people that work there that make all the difference.",znWsSGHayYsJhbdHfbyIWw,3,3,5,_Ag6tjcaA1sFLUYGIqtWGA
4776282,2014-04-10,0,avBS62WEvwWyoDWBXAlxmg,"Their food is always great,  only downfall is it seems as if their a bit picky with their portions that they put on their sandwiches.  I always ask for them to put on extra and it's very little.  It's like going to a fastfood and asking for hot sauce and they give you 2 for 4 tacos.  Other than that their flatizzas are always made great,  and that is always what I get from now on due to their stinginess of sauce.",FMZPw64X5bXw_wBKWt2TvA,3,1,4,T0WAICKnxN5KCQhr4AfwZA
4934754,2013-09-17,0,avBS62WEvwWyoDWBXAlxmg,"The team here is efficient and very very professional!  This is a great place.

1.  Location - Southwest corner of Trop and Pecos, very easy to get to.

2.  Parking - Not much, perhaps a total of 10 spaces for three stores there.

3.  Ambiance - A typical Subway.

4.  Food choices - A typical Subway, with all the normal meats, cheeses and veggies

5.  Not Typical - What sets this place apart is the quality service.  Just three days ago, I was at another Subway in Henderson ordering a sandwich platter for a meeting and so I have something recent to compare:

a.  Meats - I think they are controlled by this, so nothing special.
b.  Veggies - They really packed these on. Compared to the Henderson one, they went all out.
c.  Service - I was there at 11:15 and one person was before me. When I ordered the platter which is 5 sandwiches,  Then, 5 people came in immediately after me, so they had a very busy time. Immediately two others came out of the back and started helping all the other clients. Excellent way to manage client expectations and a busy load. 
d.  More - They even asked me if I wanted another sandwich for 5.00 more as it will pack the tray that is reserved for the mustard and mayo packs. I did do this and it rounded out the platter nicely.  At the henderson Store, they did not ask and I did not know and the tray looked a bit empty to me and not a nice way to impress the meeting.


6.  Overall - The service here for a chain was tremendous. I recommend this place!

GK says check it out.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,2,2,5,ihm764F1LgnqiTl1drN-3A
