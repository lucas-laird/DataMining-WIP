1516542,2017-03-04,0,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,We came in like 15 minutes before they closed and Dakota made our sandwich and she was awesome and upbeat the whole time. I know what it's like to have people come in close to closing time but she was smiling and talking to us and it made for a nice visit. Thanks!,bcx2WkH_VW86_aUUiOk1hw,1,0,5,GhAlryhm9uP86SPOWalfhQ

2230166,2012-06-07,3,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,"They don't offer the veggie patty sandwich here and they rip you off if you use the buy one / get one free coupon for 6 inch subs. Isn't the point of a franchise restaurant knowing that you can get the same thing in every place?  Not true at this place, worse subway I've ever been too.",A1ZvfsC6IJRhkF5JDKXp2w,1,1,1,5v9GPaHb83isJ-Ykl7cuAA
2673262,2010-05-17,0,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,"$5 for a footlong is a darn good deal. Just note that the subs are much, much thinner than in the pictures, so I would suggest asking for double the meat, cheese, or whatever you want. 

The toasted subs are my fave. (I'm not too fond of cold sandwiches.) 

I like that they make it front of you. Half of the sub will fill you up, so the $5 foot long is actually good for two meals. The food isn't fabulous, but if you are budget conscious, you can get your money's worth here.

I don't have a favorite, but my boyfriend loves the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki sub.

I've been here about 3 times and the customer service has been good every time.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,2,0,3,ukxuS0ASHkGfJ1_SPmvBdA
2829872,2016-02-26,0,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,I think the service here is great! Its mostly because of the girl that makes the sandwiches DAKOTA! She is so friendly and kind! Great customer service and always greets you with a smile!,z0_DSeiCJgTkyMFiW4d9Rw,1,0,5,2j7igbhV4szQrp3bdPK5qw
3728021,2015-07-28,4,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,"Never again.   I like to go to Subway in a pinch. (like I'm really hungry and the only other place around is McDonalds) but there's one thing I've noticed repeatedly that grosses me out.

The employees act as if the gloves are to protect their hands. 

Money has to be the filthiest thing on earth and handling money with gloves on and then going back to prepare food....

Eeeeuuuuwww!

It's not just at this location.  This was just my last attempt.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,5,2,2,4eIjsEZ7KVYub_hEUrDJWw
3829488,2011-03-02,5,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,"This Subway is around the corner from my house and I just found it after living in the neighborhood for 3 1/2 yrs!  It's located in a non-descript building kind of set back from the road next to the 7-11, which is probably why I've never noticed it before.

Anyway, I ordered my usual 12"" BMT toasted w/Green Peppers, Mustard, Mayo, Onions, Salt/Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Provolone.  The Sandwich Artist did an OK job with the Sammie....she went a little light on the Veggies, so that was the only downside to it.

Overall, an OK experience at Subway.  Glad I found one so close to home!

4127298,2017-06-24,2,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,The past two times I went to this location they didn't have ice tea prepared. I don't drink soda or juice. So I wasted my money on an empty cup of ice. Now I'm taking my precious ice home to fill it with some of my own tea. Wow thanks subway. I was willing to pay a whopping three bucks for some ready-to-drink iced tea.,c2-9Rm7Uhf7Xy-FzqU1aPw,1,1,1,1IvZwoSot1YVFy5zoOBe2A

5318429,2017-02-13,1,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,"This isn't our ordinary location, but we were in the area. Boy are we glad this isn't out normal location. The teenage boy behind the counter had major attitude and the place was a MESS! Mustard and crumbs smeared all over the place. They ran out of the bread and cheese we wanted, which isn't necessarily the boy's fault, but why have attitude over it?? Just apologize and try to be pleasant and sell what you have on hand. No, the kid could have cared less, which is a reflection of management in general. Then the straw that broke the camels back, he threw a piece of chicken that been out for God's know how long, he threw back in the bin.  My husband, who is a chef, screamed about cross contamination and got us out of there.  NEVER AGAIN!!",DBD3NB1ecSF5_OJNsXjK_w,1,0,1,8IoaO7Mde_GM3lFfq8sq-Q
5583280,2012-05-02,1,AurgTYGyCItvvgFp9NQBag,"My 7 year old thinks this place is the bomb.  However, I beg to differ.  Their slogan is eat fresh but I look through the glass at the fixins and wonder if Fresh is the right word.  Not to mention their cold cuts look like they have more fillers and preservatives than actual meat.

Some things are good as they do have a lot of choices but I would stay away from the limp bacon or chicken sandwiches.  In a pinch this is edible but there are many better sandwich shops to choose from in the area.  For kids, the ""fit meal"" works well and comes with a little subway bag.  Chip and drink choices are limited but they have great cookies. Try the white chocolate raspberry!",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,1,2,o1oE2EQxNjpuo8c3UdRKOg
