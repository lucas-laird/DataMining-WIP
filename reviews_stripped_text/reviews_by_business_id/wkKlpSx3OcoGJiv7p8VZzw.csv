39900,2017-07-17,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"We went there on Bastille Day, July 14 without a reservation.  We were flying out in the morning and wanted something away from the strip with easy parking- and not far from our hotel.  I saw the 4 stars on Yelp and we decided to try it.  They had a table available if we promised to be finished before their next 7:45 reservation.  No problem for us. I don't know what their regular menu is, but July 14 was all French.  We ordered wine and beer and decided to share a steak frites- think that's what it was called.  (I think sharing was our fatal flaw.) We ordered it ""medium"" as I don't like rare meat.  The service was slow. Slow to get our drinks  and very slow to get our dinner.  The table for 2 to our left had 2 plates of bread along with their meal. We had none. The table of 4 to our right ordered foils gras and other things. They must have been important as the Maitre D fawned over them, brought them complimentary appetizers and returned to chat with them several times while we waited for our dinner.  Finally received our RARE steak frites. The steak was Luke warm and gristly. The fries were piping hot and excellent. Never saw any bread. We felt treated like second class citizens. We won't be back.",Q1BkWysx-QKj3KVOJBpNEQ,0,0,1,Vw8SBHNsk06DlrncctQuyQ

I recommend the stuffed clams, the Argentina shrimps, and the bone marrow dumplings. For the drinks I loved the one with mezcal tequila.

219675,2017-07-16,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"I wanted to love it, I really did.  Arriving early for our reservation, I thought we could have a drink at the bar.  We were told we could go stand at the and of the bar and order a drink...because all the bar seats were taken.  The reason seems to be is that the bar is treated like a really long dining table, so there is no place to get a drink other than at the end of the bar, where you are dodging staff trying to do their jobs.  What happened to a bar being a bar?  

Once seated, we waited approximately 15 minutes with no service, so we asked a passing server if he might be able to help us.  Thankfully, he agreed, and did a great job.  The cocktails are creative and well made, and by that time, we needed one.  As for the food, it is also creative and beautifully presented.  Unfortunately, the portions for shared plates are very small, and expensive.  If you want bread, for instance, its $6 for a loaf slightly larger than a baseball.  Really?  The other dishes range from $12 to $18, but are so small, sharing really means you get a bite of something.

The restaurant itself is really well done with a great vibe and lively crowd.  I was surprised how little seating there was though.  Its a good sized space, but the kitchen seems to take up most of it. 

Maybe its just me, but I'm looking forward to the end of the shared plates craze, when you can go into a restaurant for an actual meal.  Again, I was excited to try this place out, and I would say it had great potential, if it wasn't already so busy.  Maybe its just not for me.",9x62gJ0OWzz_8KHVD3GExQ,1,0,3,oaVo-cJoqqWD1vV_isCUNw
316164,2018-01-05,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"I hate to leave a bad review but this is the 2nd time I've been here and am disappointed.

I love food. Any splurge purchase I ever make is food related. I love food so much I am a cook by profession and am engaged to a cook. Hell, I even cook on my days off!  My 2nd job is in customer service. Needless to say I am a good customer. I spent over $300 the last time I visited. Tonight I spent around $200 (tip included). Same server but I'm not sure she recognized us. I am here to say it was not worth the $$$

We were on time for an 8:30 reservation but there was no one up front. Later I realize the hostess was running food.

The oysters were bangin. We got the grilled oysters and the celeriac/wasabi ones. If the meal had stopped here I would have left  completely happy. We ordered the uni melt. It was delicious and super fresh.

Unfortunately the oysters took over 20 min to arrive. After we got our 2nd course (essentially a sandwich) nearly 20 min after, our server finally checked it to ask if we had the oysters yet. If we hadn't that would be pretty terrible that she hadn't checked sooner.

~20 minutes later, the skate arrived. It sounded glorious on the menu promising ""Alabama white sauce."" It was dropped off by the hostess who struggled to describe it, calling the grapefruit ""dragonfruit.""  Her coworker reassured her it was. She came back later to correct herself.

A major turn off- the skate wing comes with all the bones. On first glance it looks like you can just fork into it, but after doing this, we both got mouthfuls of bones. This wouldn't be so unforgiveable if we were told upon ordering or even upon being served  but there was no mention of it. I told the runner that cleared the plates I wish someone would have just told us because we just dug into it and got a mouthful of bones. He apologized but then made the excuse that the staff was still ""acclimating"" to the new menu. I understand this but warning someone of bones in fish is pretty important. As you see in the picture there were MANY bones, and any less cautious eater could choke on them. The grapefruit was actually really good with the sauce, but the skate itself was borderline salty.

At this point we were regretting ordering so much. We devoured everything delivered within 2 minutes of it arriving - we were so hungry. Our server checked in with us (since we probably looked very impatient) and informed us that the trout dish was being plated right now and that it would be 2 more mins. The trout was delivered by the chef/owner himself and he asked us how everything tasted. Of course we said it was good - the food was fine, it was the service that had been terrible.

Until this dish. The trout was simply deboned and butterflied, served with tiny dots of two different sauces, neither of which I could really taste unless I ate them alone (which I did, just to make sure I wasn't imaging things. The green sauce tasted very leafy and the white sauce still tasted like nothing.) That's it. No side or anything that explains why I paid $26 for it.

Finally, our Japanese sweet potato and sweetbreads came in at the same time, shortly after. We wanted to pack up and leave. My fiance was so upset by the trout dish (or lack thereof) I had lost my appetite. The sweet potato (which our server had upsold us because they were out of the brussel sprouts) was totally different than I imagined. It was basically a loaded baked sweet potato. Not worth $12 when I know it had about $2 food cost--being generous. Why had such a dish come out last?  Sweetbreads were okay. They came with a sweet sauce that made me think of bread pudding. The protein was severely underseasoned The veg on the plate was virtually nonexistent. 

There is no excuse for this wait. We arrived at 8:30 and left around 10:30. These are small plates and the open kitchen reveals many cooks not moving very fast. The place wasn't even packed and yet I watched as the bar filled up and emptied out before my last course.

Our server was pleasant but really not present other than when trying to sell us more food. I asked for the rest of the food to go and the check. A runner picked up the food nd I told him to pack everything. He didn't take the other half of the potato which we packed ourselves. None of the other things on the sweetbreads dish had been put into the box which is like throwing $10 away. I also watched as our server held a long conversation with a table she obviously knew and watched as a table that got there much later than us got their check before we even got ours. I had to ask for a corrected copy because they charged us for the brussels (which they were out of). My server said ""Oh, they forgot to take that off?"" Who is ""they""? Aren't you my server and didn't I see you print and hand me the check? I don't know why everyone treated me like I was a stupid child that doesn't know anything about restaurants but I guess it was because I spent so much money here.",DGMVPJaU6MmosJliJF-Qag,2,0,1,wxqzooase_L8eHdTnnNYlQ
447821,2017-07-09,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"So glad to have discovered this place thanks to Yelp! Had reserved a table for two but when we got there we changed our mind and asked to sit at the bar and I'm so glad we did! The two bartenders were amazing. They were on top of our drinks and waters, this was a huge bonus bc it was over 115 out, and were definitely in sync with one another's style. Great team effort on their part! 

Drinks were delicious (the cucumber gin, Model T, one was not my fave but it's not horrible) the slushy on tap is a must try! Along with the carrot ginger one, Lieutenant Dangle. 

Artichoke appetizer was fabulous and so was the pork shoulder that just fell apart when you touched it! Oysters were also very delicious!  

Will definitely return here when in Vegas!",AKjsaJ8LGRoR9hDMcXNYeA,1,1,5,MUJP3D0eqvTSuMqXLVH1xg

Sparrow + Wolf WOWED us!   We shared a bunch of plates including a special of caviar on toast (maybe my favorite all night).  Also had a hummus plate and a hamachi tartar with rice crisps that was amazingly flavored.  They had a couple of meat dishes that they loved.  

If I return to Las Vegas, I will surely return here. The food was great...the staff was great...the vibe was great.",TB_qjgTdFu0wqCA3fVOj5g,0,0,5,oQE2nonc80pUItpUboAqsg
515441,2017-12-24,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"I really wanted to be tougher on this place, but, alas, instead it proved itself a worthy gem in the crown of the ever-burgeoning local Las Vegas restaurant scene. Conspicuously designed and plopped right in the heart of the humble, gritty, authentic Las Vegan Chinatown that already boasts a lively yet rightfully sincere array of brilliant eateries and options, Sparrow + Wolf overcomes its ""try-hard"" name and west LA envy with a disciplined, focused menu and high-level yet simple wine offerings that will leave any patron remiss for anything negative to say. Our party started with fresh Baja oysters which were exceptional in quality (usually they are overpriced and undersized at most places due to lack of discernment in selection). Moving on to lamb dumplings -- which offered house-made dumplings and exceptional lamb amidst a brilliant yet tangy reduction -- my only tip would be the dumplings were a touch too doughy and not enough texture despite the handcraftmanship (a simple cure of an extra 30 seconds on heat or perhaps higher heat). We also took in a wild mushroom dish over a hummus which was outstanding but the hummus clouded the spotlight and could be taken off the plate without a tear shed. Amongst a few other offerings, the star was the bone marrow offering -- which was rounded out and served with escargot. One of the best and balanced bone marrow offerings I've had in Las Vegas, this dish was a real star and substantial as well for a ridiculously great $18 price tag. Accompanying everything was a bright, brilliant blanc de blanc by Ruinart that truly, even if less so by the establishment's knowledge than by default, represents truly one of the best and most versatile champagnes to compliment much of their menu. Will be back and I didn't think I'd be so pleasantly surprised. Well done.",bD6B4YitEjv-B5V9nDvBBg,0,0,4,90KSTSSbncrGvdhawICYIg

783856,2017-06-23,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"From the moment you walk in and see directly into the open kitchen you are greeted by a warm friendly and well informed staff. John Anthony and the staff are engaging and can tell you anything you need to know about the food from farm to table. The room is built around the kitchen and it's very unique looking so there's plenty to see in here as well. The music playlist impresses immediately as I heard music I loved sandwiched between unfamiliar tunes that made me stop and listen. We began simply with the charcuterie and cheese plates and every item was not only visually great to look at but delicious and fresh tasting. Presented on unique trays, one of which was a very cool petrified wood platter. These were Some of the best meats and cheeses I've tasted in a long time and we went with chefs suggestions which all paired up perfectly. We followed it up with the Farm Egg and Artichoke dishes (I can't recall the official names of the dishes but they were very well thought out and put together). Both were stellar and involved layers of flavors that evolved with each bite. The Farm egg dish changed as we dove deeper into it and got richer with each bite of egg asparagus and spices that got warmer along the way as the ingredients mixed together more. Both John and our server were attentive throughout the meal and also gave us as much time as we needed to enjoy each course...suggesting just the right accompaniments and drinks along the way.  We then had the beef cheek dumplings (again just my loose description of the dish which included many other tasty ingredients) and they were very satisfying and hearty and delicate at the same time. Really a great balance in this dish. Like everything that was served to us the presentations were all beautiful and appealing the the eye, so you just want to look at the food for a while before you dig into it but it all tasted as good if not better than It even looked. Chef Howard took the time to stop by to check on us during the meal even though he was hard at work in the kitchen all evening with a full room. We then finished off with the Halibut and the Udon Lamb Bolognese and again both were filled with thoughtful and delicate textures and flavors that both satisfied and entertained my palette. There were plentiful unique Flavor combinations that were new to me but evoked a familiar comfort and within each dish was a subtle unfolding of new flavors as I would dig deeper into each dish...making it a really fun food experience as well. It was an excellent first experience and I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",WBDJp0mse7u4HjL_YGGu6w,0,0,5,ZLW56rgDN-QShbIJeYU8_w

That being said, we did not have a reservation. We waited 40 minutes for a table when the hostess told us it would only take 15-20 minutes. This is a crowded environment and it is loud. You will turn and hit another person. In order to talk to someone, you will need to yell for them to hear you. The restrooms are also crowded. In the women's restroom, there are only two available stalls. A problem I came across was not being able to reach for the seat liner, because it was too tall. Some of the workers are unorganized, forgetting an order or where it came from. I noticed the glasses and utensils were dirty, (they were not washed and dried properly), you can see water residue. Other than that, it took 8 minutes for us to order and 45 minutes for the food. Although, the introduction to the food was great and the food itself was (4 1/2)/5. The Udon I had was still a tad undercooked. It was a bit hard and chewy compared to how it is normally served. The Udon and Halibut had a bit too much sauce and seasoning for the dish itself. Besides that, the Udon, the Halibut, and the Full Monty were all excellent. The Calamansi Tarte was amazing! (That's coming from a Filipino!)",Czy123eGQiK7V1NyJSA3gw,1,1,4,FHvi3NL93POIeZFp7bXiug

Very nice and a great gesture. Perfect way to get the night going. Thank you, Brian.

1389087,2017-07-14,4,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"We were so excited to try this place even before they opened.  Finally made it tonight and was fairly disappointed. 

Called ahead to ask if we needed reservation and hostess highly recommended yes. Made a reservation and when we showed up, we were offered the bar cuz there was no table set aside for us (defeats my reservation?)..After we sat at the bar, we saw the happy hour menu (we were also not informed when we called at 5pm that there was happy hour).  Personally I think it's quite important for a new restaurant to inform their customers events, promotions, and specials.

Decor and ambience was hip.  They definitely invested time and money, it's well thought out!! Loved all the little details. 

We ordered Clams Casino..$7.50 a clam with the smallest Uni on top. (Photos on Yelp had much larger Uni) both my husband and I barely had any clam, I had 2 large bits of mushroom and bacon instead.

Lamb Tartare needed some kinda kick.. like more red onions or capers or something acidic.. the curry powder in the bread just isn't enough flavor to wow us.

Bone Marrow dumpling was a beautiful and visually appetizing plate.  Though the dumpling dough is too thick, the flavor is not bad. But still mediocre 

Beef skewer was my fave tonight because the beef was a perfect medium rare, just how I like it.  Taste was more flavorful than the rest. Again, does not exceed expectation

My husband wanted to refresh with a mojito.  It wasn't the best and it wasn't chilled enough. 

I wish I could really like this place cuz I live close by and love to bring outa town friends to new places but it's very hard for me to Want To recommend it right now, especially for the price, we really expected to get mind blown.",dEiKPMxq8wCiGe-fgU0_OQ,5,0,3,h07spDxm6q1W6COVB_hhNw

This new restaurant finally brings the farm-to-table, modern American restaurant concept off the strip, and bringing it over to the ever burgeoning popular Spring Mountain road area.

After hearing a lot of buzz about this place, I was able to finally check this place out on their opening night. The interior is really well done. It has a modern elegant/rustic casual feel to it. 

Sitting down, our server took our drink orders. I partook in a lovely libation called a Lieutenant Dangle, a take on pina colada that has carrot juice mixed into it, it was splendid. I also ordered their draft of Stone Tangerine IPA, and that as well was fantastic.

Onto the food. As previously mentioned, chef Howard is doing the farm-to-table, artisinally sourced ingredient, modern American restaurant concept that people seem to be gravitating towards these days. The food here is fantastic. You can see a lot of influences in Brian's previous experiences, as well as him trying to branch out and try different things, which is always fun. 

The service here is very good. They seem to have a strong GM here, which every successful restaurant needs. The servers did a good job, as did the runners and bussers. It was the opening night and those are always unpredictable, but I'm good at noticing things, and I could tell that they will improve quickly in time.

This is a brilliant, unique restaurant concept that no-one else is doing off the strip, and it is located in the most perfect location in town. I loved the ambiance of this place. Great food and drink options that are right on point in terms value. I see this becoming a super popular spot, and I will definitely be back.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,35,32,5,AFXyje31G5JtLd1RWGwVzA

The big ass pork shank is enough for one major appetite or easily shared for two not so starving people. The slow roasted fall off the bone pork amazed. Strangely enough I didn't think the accompanying sauce was necessary and preferred the pork solo. The  mushroom/hummus dish was a delightful surprise and a rewarding menu choice. Don't sleep on the house made bread. It's part of the appetizer menu and the warm sourdough had the prefect hint of ""light sour"" bread with an amazing texture crunch and chew. The honey toast is a perfect dessert a nod to the  Asian version but with their own twist.  Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere, thoughtfully executed menu and can't wait to come back.

I like the casualness of the bar along with decent craft brew offerings, but I also like good and inventive food.  Is this what people call a ""gastropub"".   When I read about Sparrow + Wolf (what's with the ""+"" - how long will it be before restaurants are named by emoji's?), I wanted to give it a try.

The craft beer selection is small, which is not bad if it means they're turning the kegs over at a decent rate.  I had the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings.  They were very good.  The fillings of the dumplings was like a pate, soft, unctuous, and with a savory, meaty flavor.

A couple of complaints.  The music is very loud, so normal conversation isn't possible.  Second, the restaurant is dark, another current trend.  However, the plates are also very dark with high rims which make it difficult to see.

A compliment: the staff, everyone, was super friendly and helpful.
Normally, all of this would garner four-plus (or, as the restaurant might say four+) stars.  But my companion couldn't stop raving about her dish, a smoked beet salad.  She said it was one of the best things she's eaten in a long while.  She wanted a spatula to scrap up every ort.  She got orgasmic about it.  I thought she was going to have Meg Ryan - Katz Deli moment.  So for that, it's getting all five stars.",uyqE8kvAq2LxPnm385T6NA,3,2,5,jIK-7zV1J8ZEYgmTPLdOzQ

Our new date-night spot located in Chinatown, away from the strip - catching all the locals for sure! Dimmed for that romantic, classic yet modern, intimate feel. You can dress up or be casual!

Jason has been our server during our visits and he's truly amazing! Knowledgeable of the menu and drink items. He's so nice, funny and great personality!

Menu consists of raw, cured or fresh items to unique, mouth watering items! Constantly changing things up, adding new specials that run out so quickly!
Few items we've tried during our visits :
BENTO BOX
CHINATOWN CLAMS CASINO
TRUFFLE WAGYU MEATBALLS 
BEEF CHEEK & BONE MARROW DUMPLING
BIG ASS PORK SHANK
CAMPFIRE DUCK
LAMB BOLOGNESE UDON
HEARTH BAKED BREAD 
FARM EGG 
SWEETBREADS
TRES LECHES
BLACK SESAME CREPE
SPRING MOUNTAIN SOUR

These are like portioned size, so sharing is a little hard (except the Big Ass Pork Shank, that truly was huge). I would though, like for them to add some stuff to the savory items, like for example for the Bento Box you get all these cured meats and tartares, but they'll only give you one small, grilled toast. Also, their libations are STRONG! At least for my little self. I can't handle the strong whiskey drinks, I'll give it to the Spring Mountain Sour though, the beet foam in that is so good!

I believe their goal is for presentation and quality, over quantity. Expect to spend a little here though, but it's definitely worth it!",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,13,13,5,JAeZ_42fiADLVeuXOBs8QA

They weren't offering the chef's tasting menu, so we created one of our own. Here are some of the highlights: 
You might not want to spend $5 for bread, but it is worth it! You'll be talking about its rustic goodness and the umami butter for days.Our charcuterie plate included wonderful poached pears and beets for pairing with the various cheese. 
The Uni Melt was everything yummy other reviews have claimed it to be. 
The Japanese sweet potato was a revelation. I expected root vegetables in a sauce. But it's presented as a traditional American baked potato but includes tastes you've never considered as part of that homey side dish before, especially the plum crème fraiche. 
The only potential disappointment was the lasagna. The round plating is ingenious and inviting. But it arrived way too hot to eat, then ultimately found it dry. In our mind it needs a more prominent béchamel sauce.  
But this was completed made up for by the Wagyu beef with chanterelle mushrooms. It was one of the specials that night, but if you get lucky like we did, do yourself a favor and dive into the succulent, perfectly cooked dish. 
We finished the evening with a brioche dream of a dessert. It was like an elevated French toast and I already want to go back and have it again.",-elwF1k3csZRx9Zknnh-uQ,0,0,5,3lrWpHn0_5n0l3NE7VM68w

Nestled into Chinatown with a tight menu of raw and wood-fired shareables, the dark space is cozy, modern, and classic all at once. I'm more about the flavors and service when dining out, but I really enjoyed the decor and ambiance found here. The menu was such that our group ordered nearly everything available, and there wasn't a single dish that didn't find a fan.

The dish I will never be able to not get is the Butcher Wings with burnt tomato and nudja, sold by the whole piece. They are huge, juicy, and full of flavor. The Argentinian Red Shrimp is another delicious dish, and the Sweetbreads were a surprise hit at the table too, accented with smoked bacon and peas. The delicate Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings are beautiful and surprisingly light despite the rich filling, but those with texture issues may be turned off by the green onion emulsion. The beef skewer entree is a great choice that highlights the use of the wood-burning oven, and the chickpea relish really makes it pop. The Campfire Duck was the favorite dish most of the other diners preferred, but the portion only really allows for a shared taste at the table. Like Phil T says in his review, I'd appreciate the option of a larger portion to really enjoy. The pork shoulder and halibut are also solid choices for those preferring those proteins, the former benefitting from the texture of black garlic and peanuts while the latter was simply and perfectly cooked with a nice citrus confit to complement.

Whether or not you try the house bread and butter is a personal preference- while it's tasty, I'd rather splurge on other items. The artichoke dish was a bit of a disappointment to me, presentation reminiscent of a terrarium but not much in the way of actual artichoke. The udon with lamb (and added farm egg, per our server) was just okay and went unfinished at our table; perhaps it is better without the addition, which made it a very wet dish.

The desserts were okay; neither the Calamansi Tart nor the take on Tres Leches quite hit the right spot but both were beautiful and unique options. Looking forward to returning for their late-night burger specials and some more seafood, like the Chinatown Clams Casino. 

Service throughout our visit was attentive, and we were able to take a tour of the kitchen and speak with the chef himself about his sourcing and inspirations, which is always a treat. The staff really seem to push the Bento Box option, which includes some exceptionally fresh oysters and house-made terrines- good option if you're looking to impress.

Walked in, ambience is chill, sort of minimalist modern, dark blues and blacks. Sat at the bar, can sort of see into the kitchen, everyone in the place is dressed nice, but no jacket required. Dig the vibe.

Ordered a drink to start, the wife had ""Have Knives Will Travel"" sort of a sweeter, smokey old fashioned. I had the ""Spring Mountain Sour,"" the house take on a whiskey sour, came with a big dollop of beet foam, maybe it was a little pink but dammit that was fresh, the sweet/salty foam pairing perfectly with the whiskey and the citrusy sour. Do yourself a favor and get this one.

For starters, the charcuterie. This is when I knew we were in for a great meal. Culatello ham and soppressata, served with some sort of magical pickled yams/yellow beets/hell-if-I-know-but-super delicious, homemade mustard and grilled bread. Yes.

Next we had the grilled octopus. JESUS. It was fantastic. Seriously it was tender, tasted like octopus not fishy or overly cartilaginous, it was that perfect texture and seafood/shellfish goodness that's so hard to hit. If you've been to Marea in NYC, seriously it was like that braised octopus fusilli. Forgot the pic, consumed it too quickly.

A note on the timing, it was legit restaurant good. Like, we had good time between drinks, apps, starter, main dish. It felt like a prix fixe, but we just ordered off the regular menu. The details man, the details.

Next we had sweetbreads and the beef cheek/bone marrow dumplings. Dammit if they weren't fantastic as well. I'm legitimately upset bc none of you will believe the meal was so good. You just gotta try it. The dumplings were umami bombs, just pure beefy essence of greatness. The sweetbreads were the essence of culinary gestalt, served with bacon wrapped endive, caramelized shallots, watercress, and peas. I don't even like peas but the way they all worked together was redonkulous.

The bar tenders were awesome, cool people who appreciate good food and drinks. So nice to see and visit a legit good food place that serves in a down to earth manner, not pretentious. The manager, John Anthony, was out making the rounds and seemed like a regular dude who loves his job. Respect.

Will definitely be back, with friends. You gotta try it.",Fhius40l4G-Dc0Zdou9HSg,4,3,5,vFJA-30T7-cWnymPW_ReEA

Our party of 3 walked in around 8:30 pm with no reservations but we got seated at the bar immediately by John, who was happy and friendly when greeting us. The restaurant is very hipster but also stylish and upscale. Loved the interior decor. 

Our bartender, Andrew, had lots of suggestions on wines. I love it when bartenders share the wealth of knowledge that they have. We were also asked if we wanted tap water or bottled Voss water and I know that made my friend happy because she's such a water snob, lol. The menu is simple but has lots of variety. 

We ordered the maitake mushrooms, 2 orders of the lamb udon, and the scallops. My friends were raging over how good the maitake mushrooms were. I tasted the scallops and was very impressed. So buttery! It makes up for the fact that the scallops came out later than the rest of our food. Also, I want to say that the lamb udon IS ALL THE HYPE because it was soooo bomb. It needs to be ordered with the egg, in my opinion.

Nothing disappointed. I loved everything. The duck and foie gras was BOMB and you know it's good when everything including the food decorations on the dish is amazing. So amazon that we had to ask John how the wood ear was cooked! (Emailing you still about the recipe) hehe 

The dumplings were amazing with the garlic and onion foam! I honestly don't know what dumpling can top that one. The fresh sour dough bread was fresh, hot, and crispy. Recommend it if you're a bread lover like me. I do wish the bread had something more than just plain butter since everything else was so out of this world. 

Cocktails were cool. I liked how John told us that nothing gets wasted in the kitchen so they use it in cocktails! So new cocktails every so often according to the kitchen menu. Woo 

Service was very attentive and water cup was always full.

My date and I got 5 dishes (including the bread): Campfire duck, Japanese sweet potato, Hamachi carpaccio, and II don't remember the last.  The bread was good but honestly had way too much crust which made it really hard to tear and chew.  The Japanese sweet potato wasn't really my thing but my date really enjoyed it.  It was honestly just a baked potato with slightly different flavorings.  The hamachi carpaccio was really interesting, in a good way.  The fish was very delicate and the roasted grapes were amazing.

Had our aunt and uncle not awaited and prepared dinner for us, we would've indulged in our sensory beyond 4 dishes: Hamachi, clam, foie gras, and lobster tail. Our favorite is definitely the hamachi! 

Despite the wonder of this place, our experience was unfortunately a bit misplaced due to a rude couple sitting next to us. They conspicuously mocked us for taking photos of our food before indulging. They are free to think and feel as they please, but they should have the courtesy to keep it to themselves for a later time and settings. We thought it was obvious to them that what they are doing was rude by the stern look we gave them, however, they had the audacity to take a picture of us taking a picture of our food. At that point in time, we confronted the woman (the man stepped out at this point) first about their misconduct, who denied both discussing anything about us and taking the photo. We felt that it was not worth it to take it further as it was suffice to stand up for ourselves. Not long after the man returned and shouted at us that we were tacky for taking photos and stormed out threatening to put us on Facebook. We were so appalled by this misconduct, but surely it didn't take long that it was brought to the attention of our host, John, who came to commiserate with us. His commiseration was unexpected, but definitely appreciated. Thank you, John and to the staff that went the extra step!

We detailed this experience, because we hope that no one will ever have to go through what we went through and inspire others to be respectfully to each other even if we have differing opinions. Every one should be able to have a pleasant dinning experience. 

Overall, we were left with a mix of discombobulation, gratefulness, and delighted palette that night. Nevertheless, we look forward to second round without the misconduct.",_bZVTmAe5l5zqPxnGLsMqQ,0,0,4,kUY40mP7U367kCGN7w8ieA

We arrived 15 minutes ahead of our reservation as we could not wait to have our palettes pleased.  After a short wait we were sat and promptly approached to discuss libations.  We ordered a round of a Spring Mountain Sour (beet foam!!!), Where There's Smoke (mezcal), Model T (Gin/Cucumber) and a Jump the Shark (it's a shark shaped glass w/ bourbon!).  All of the drinks were so good we downed them (enjoyed them slowly....) and ordered a second round.  For starters, we went with 4 pieces of the Chinatown Clams Casino and the Hearth Baked Bread (as who isn't a sucker for in house fresh carbs).  The bread had the exact crunch you look for in a dinner roll / sauce picker upper.  More on that later.  The Chinatown Clams Casino were an interesting take as not everyone is an Uni fan, but it worked and I want more....like now.  For our entrees we decided it was best to order a smattering of items and pick them apart like vultures.  We ordered the Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings, Sweetbreads and Campfire Duck w/ wood ear mushrooms and a healthy portion of foie gras.  The flavors were all spot on so it will be hard to want to order anything else although the Big Ass Pork Shoulder passed our table and I think I drooled on the floor.  Just a little....don't judge.  Overall, we were all pleasantly filled and the minute I got home I opened their website and booked another reservation.  This is a great neighborhood (off the strip) gem that I hope succeeds and keeps their high quality of service and ingredients rocking.  

Side Note: Very cool meeting Chef Brian Howard as he went around touching tables and it's always nice to share some moments with the curators of your culinary experience. We were running low on our bread over entrees and had a good amount of sauce leftover from the beef cheek and duck dish so Chef Howard brought us another bread on the house to help transport that delciousness into our bellies and we obliged.

2663533,2018-03-03,1,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"I wanted to love this place. I really did. There were some bright spots but overall it wasn't that great. 

Instead of a 3-star review for being standard or ordinary. They had some good dishes and some that were horrible. 

First of all the service was wonderful. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The owner/manager was chatty without overdoing it. The restaurant is fairly tightly packed and the vibe at the tables near ours was good. We chimed in on each other's conversations a couple of times which I always think is fun when the mood is right. 

So the good stuff were the cocktails. Yum! The wine list was reasonable and offered a bit of everything. We had a scallop special where they were served oyster style - with dressing on the half shell. 

We ordered a half dozen oysters that were not a great choice. The oysters were fresh...the problem was that the ones we got with shiitake lap cheong vinaigrette were so so salty. Then the simply raw oysters came with nothing at all which we weren't prepared for- usually I expect horseradish or vinegar. The very least they could do would be serve with a lemon wedge. Nothing. 

My husband got the better choices he had campfire duck and a chocolate dessert. Almost faultless but the duck was a little salty. Folks at the table next to ours liked their duck too. 

On to my dishes. I love lamb dishes but the roasted lamb neck was truly awful and inedible. The seasoning on it was good but when i took my first bite I got a huge mouthful of fat with it. So off putting. When I carved farther into the roast lamb I cut off huge globs of fat. I've never been served anything like it before. There was so much fat, more than there was meat. I couldn't eat it. Was it not cooked long enough and fat was supposed to render and drip off during cooking? That would make sense but the way it was served was just wrong. Our waiter was very good about it and took it away. I had the Thai lime creme brûlée. Another mistake. Again the flavors were there but the top of the brûlée wasn't fired at all. No sugary crispy top means it's not a brûlée. And the custard although tasty flavors was grainy. So 2 dishes we couldn't eat. 

It's a modern cool room with great drinks and staff but I can't get past the poor food. (Or poor execution of good ideas)",ar-o21pk2bC3OsJCQAuhRg,1,0,3,jT_m-Q9ppmIb26rcqZRalA

This night had a ""fried"" whole mackerel dish with veggies and it was light and the perfect portion. My husband had the Beef Short Rib with rich red glaze. He loved it. The cocktails are great too, my server was quite knowledgeable and helped me pick the perfect after dinner drink, but the Burn The Witch lives in my heart.

It's not often that I come across a restaurant that hits so many elements that create an amazing experience for me. Usually I settle for one or two of the 5 things I look for and choose to be happy with that. For me personally my experience last night at Sparrow + wolf is worthy of an explanation.

Location: Center of town and easy to get to from anywhere with tons of parking = No stress getting there or leading up to walking in.

First Impression: Room is gorgeous, Music choice and volume is instantly noticeable and pleasant and the instant view of kitchen and staff working has a good vibe.
Bar Stools: Are comfortable AF with nice backrest and arms. As someone who loves to sit at the bar for a drink and a couple appetizers THANK YOU!!!

Menu: This is as close to a dream menu that I could have imagined or have come across. Last time I saw a menu that made me this happy was at The Eddy in NYC. Not to many choices to choose from and every dish seemed to be a signature item like the Udon Lam Sausage, Chinatown Clams Casino (Favorite Dish) and the Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings. Cocktails were also amazing and I found my new favorite spirit which was like a 100% Agave Gin.

Staff: I ate at the bar last night so this is about the bartenders mostly and they were on point. Sara and Cody were attentive, aware and focused on guest experience. They were also knowledgable and passionate about the food and drinks they were about to serve our group of 5 at the bar. The food runners and bussers also did a great job because the food was delivered and cleared seamlessly. Obviously the back of house killed it because everything I ate was stupid good.

Congratulations Chef Brian Howard, Chef Justin Kingsley Hall and GM John Anthony for everything it must have taken from patience to passion to bring all these elements together. What a gift it is for this community to have an establishment like this available to us and thank you to the entire Sparrow + wolf team.

2724913,2017-07-31,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Sparrow + Wolf offers a selection of entrees of American dishes modernized to match the trendy and hip atmosphere of which you'll be dining in.   Offerings include fresh oysters with various options and specials to determine how they're prepared, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and duck with delicious foie gras prepared on top.

We arrived around 6pm without reservations and were still seated promptly.  I can only imagine that as the popularity of this restaurant rises, a reservation might be a good idea if you want a seat.

First to try, an order of their ""hearth baked bread with cultured butter"".  While I can understand   the concept of selling bread instead of serving it complimentary for an upscale trendy establishment, I felt the rolls were on the small side and did not particularly stand out by any means taste-wise.  I'd save the dough (see what I did there?) and use that towards any of their fantastic appetizers and entrees.

The beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings with green onion emulsion, garlic foam was pretty delicious and shareable with another person.   It was weird because at this point, we were offered complimentary toasted bread to scoop up the sauce to enjoy all its tastefulness.  The bread itself was burnt though.

My wife ordered beef skewers which were paired with crepes, butter, and chickpea relish.  Slightly undercooked per my wife's taste with lots of red on the inside of each piece of skewered meat.  It also came out somewhere between cold and warm, probably sitting on a plate for some time before being served to us.

My duck entree was definitely the star.   The flavors were on point and the foie gras elevated the dish even further.   This was their saving grace for me.

Overall, a nice establishment with a great selection of appetizers and entrees but lacked a bit as far as execution goes.   We would have preferred our meats hot and our bread not burnt.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,6,3,3,WNHek-uUwgc0Ml7k64kjgg

If you want to eat at a place where the manager (John) touches each table with a passion for food and hospitality that's second to none - a place where the small plates are a hybrid of Providence on Melrose and Factory Kitchen in the Los Angeles Arts district - this is the place. Each small plate gives four guests a pretty good sampling. Some of the best dishes we've had in a long, long time were the beet salad with charred lemon ash and blue cheese; perfectly cooked octopus with house-made XO sauce; and beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings with reduced balsamic vinaigrette. We have never had digestives after the meal but this time we decided to try a couple and boy were we surprised on how effective they were. If the manger (John) isn't too busy, it's fun to hear him discuss the history of digestives.

This place is on its way to becoming one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Grab a seat now before the word gets out. It's only been open three months and it was packed tonight. I foresee in the near future that you will need to make reservations a month before your visit.

2763762,2018-04-20,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"My review of a tasting menu we are ordering for an event in a few weeks....

The menu was spectacular tonight.  

The chef, Brian Howard, and his business partner, John, are  locals to Vegas.  Chef Howard (he opened chef Thomas Keller's Bouchon restaurant) has worked under several amazing chefs including Micheal Mina, David Myers- and the menus are influenced from classic training from  middle eastern / Mediterranean and French backgrounds.  The primary cooking style Is live fire and his ability to pair items is amazing.  This menu is influenced as modern American bringing as much local produce - tomatoes, vegetables, and ""urban gardening"" together with seasonal influences proteins- sourced as responsible as possible.  Farm to table.  


The passed canapé's were a little bigger than one bite and they assured me that  this was because they thought I was two (although I eat as two!)

 I believe that the best option is to do a French service for the salads. The beets salad was delicious with a surprise crunch of arare at the end and hint of fennel.  The color of the beets and the green apple was so lively, they deserve to be on a white plate and not sure we should force a choice of one salad when two are offered.  I did not try the urban seed green salad https://www.urbanseedinc.com/ but would have loved it!

The vegetable tart was again beautiful.  With the caper sauce it filled the plate and had a LARGE assortment of Vegetables. I particularly like the variety of morel and left foot mushrooms which were very filling. I did ask that they cut the green onions, I found them a little difficult to cut because they were cooked.

I believe the reason I was here was really to check out the short rib and halibut dinner. That was definitely the highlight of the evening. The short rib had a sticky thai glaze on it which made it a little sweet, but they offset that with a very tiny green pepper which gave it a pop.  It was cut into three sections so it was very easy to eat. The halibut was a perfect portion of about 3 ounces and it was very flaky. I understand that halibut is really in season and it's freshest point Within the next five weeks so we are right in its wheel house. The plate was   Presented in a way that the food was the star. It was very simple presentation, with very little sauces. I was not prepared for all of the flavors in the meal and  they definitely surprised me.  I took the opportunity while I was there to speak to the guests at the table next to me :)They were talking about the short ribs, as a matter of fact, and said that this was the reason that they were there. The restaurant was completely full by the time I am leaving. It's definitely a neighbor restaurant that is drying a very large crowd because of the chef.    I might have cheated and eaten some of the potato but it was just too good looking not too!  

The desserts were all beautiful. Lemon is my favorite anything and I understand you guys are going to have that served with a chef preparation at a station. If so that'll be beautiful for your guests on a gorgeous evening.",TXxp9fYRICh9omffMEGbgA,0,0,5,urBmmP1roCpVgNBVErTx4w

Saw on Yelp that there was happy hour which I was excited for but came here with a buddy and the bartender said the only happy hour was for drinks. Little bummed but whatever. 
Took a look at the menu and man there were some pricey entrees. But by reading the reviews, figured I would get a good bang for my buck. Since my buddy and I were here for the drinks we focused on that and just got a full monty cheese and charcuterie plate and a skate wing. 
To be fair the drinks were good. Beers on tap were great and they have some good choices on tap. The food however was the issue. You would think a cheese and charcuterie plate would be filled with a variety of meats or something but all we got were 4 thin slices of meat, a few cheeses, a slice of pate, and a few pickled vegetables. Granted they did taste pretty good but I thought it was hardly worth it for $26. The skate wing was also good but man it's hard to justify it for $26. For some people who eat here price may not matter, but if you are looking for good happy hour that will fill you up, has great food and is not that pricey, there are plenty of other places in Vegas which will suit your needs.

We chose this restaurant since it seemed like it has great rating and the food looked excellent so my friends and I decided to come here for dinner, and to celebrate Chinese New Year. However, it was a disappointment. 

First of all, when I called to make the reservation, I was not treated rudely but I felt like I wasn't very welcome either. I was not being thank for for making a reservation and not even a bye before being hung up on the phone. He already hung up the phone while I was saying, ""Thank you and bye."" Whoa...

Second of all, many of the items on the menu were not available and it was all the ones the reason we decided to come here. Then we were also informed later on that the whole menu got changed at the beginning of the year. 

Third, staffs are nice but super slow service. 

Fourth, the food were just an ok. The uni clam ($7.50 for one...lol) was salty. The uni melt was ok but the uni was a little fishy. The hamachi poke was good. The lamb neckbone was ok, it was way too oily and none of us liked the sauce. The drinks were ok, nothing impressive since the ones we wanted were no longer on the menu. Then there's something called sweet bread, boy how it tricked us, it was pig liver. And yes, just tasted like liver. Um, no. 

We were just glad we didn't order that much for a group of 8. The bill still came out to be over $200 while all of the dish was small, only the lambneck looked like a main entree. My bf said this place should call Tapas.

I'd been meaning to go as the restaurant continues to be well-praised and so happy I finally got the chance to. Very interesting menu items, all with East and Southeast Asian flare, either through certain ingredients and spices or the preparation style more generally. This is an awesome place to come for a group that loves to share food, enjoys the flavors of different Asian cuisine, experiments with new combinations, and comes reasonably hungry. Really really beautiful plating, dishes, and colors as well. Only thing we did wrong was order two desserts, which were both really good, but were somehow bigger than the portions of each entree and we were way too full. My advice would be to try the sweet potato if you're a sweet potato lover! The creme fresh was awesome as a pairing, and they were deliciously sweet and cooked to perfection. It stood out probably because it so exceptionally surpassed expectations, and I always love a sweet potato. I reiterate that the dumplings are necessary. Loved the hamachi and grilled oyster prepared with miso. Short rib fell right off the bone and the bread cut the heaviness is the sauce. Kind of wish we tried the duck too or instead because I love a perfectly cooked duck, but still super happy with the preparation and flavor of the short rib. Toast for dessert!

To clarify, I don't think this restaurant necessarily tops popular contemporary Asian fusion restaurants in cities like NYC, DC, SF, and LA, but it sure does champion almost anything that exists in Vegas. Price point differences aside (this dinner was so reasonable compared to the strip!), the food at Sparrow + Wolf was also objectively much better than anything on the strip, but anyone from Vegas who understands the culinary scene here knows that's how it works.

3020823,2018-05-07,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Came here and got the Salmon Poke, Beef cheeks + bone marrow dumplings, Lasagna, octopus, duck, and mushrooms.

There were some tiers in terms of the quality of food IMO.The dishes on one level were the poke, dumplings, and duck. 

The poke was on this crunchy rice wrap and had the szechuan peppercon flavoring. Loved using the wrap as a vessel to consume the poke and the spice had a nice subtle kick (assuming you are used to szechuan cuisine).

The dumpling had this green onion foam on it, which I didn't think added much except for presentation. The actual dumpling had a thicker/harder skin than most dumplings. I think it really meshed with the thicker filling well though. Make sure you use the base with the dumpling as it might be a bit bland without it (since the skin is thick).

The duck had some foie gras on it and that was delicious. The duck stole the show though. Definitely had no gamey taste and was just cooked perfectly. On the more rare side, and had a nice outer layer vs just meat. It had a great balance of meat + skin/fat and that made the bites that much more delicious. I really prefer having both in my bites.

The mushrooms. It was hummus (not special) + some terra chips (def not special) with 3 pieces of mushrooms. Was not worth...

The octopus had some korean sauce on the outside and it was pretty spicy. I thought the quality of the octopus was really good, it was just that there was too much sauce and that didn't sit well with me. Overwhelming flavor, because of that reason I'd pass on that.

The lasagna wasn't that special IMO. The doughy layers were very soft, almost like mac and cheese texture so that was nice. I couldn't tell the lamb was lamb (tasted like beef tbh). Not sure why use lamb when it just tastes like beef.

Overall it's a great experience. If you stick with some certain dishes you will love this place",vcCDxkFQujyIXE4kJXEuMA,1,0,4,gORzh1Sm-M6G9fuVPFfqgA

Exposed kitchen almost had me walk back there after 5+ minutes of nobody.  Restaurant is not that busy on a Thursday.  Host is finally seen talking to some patrons leaving.  He stops them for a conversation right next to us about, ""I've known the chef for a decade. He does things the French way -- everyone is yes chef no chef no matter who they are.  He knows Thomas Keller.""  All trite, porous, grandstanding after having waited for him to show up.  
We are shown to a table and ok! Do not care about all that let's just have the food.  Waitress has us wait another 8-10 mins as we have water filled.  She says I'll be right back and after 5 more minutes I'm ready to leave.
I really wanted to go here.  I love fine American when it is well executed and the menu was something that intrigued me.  But the hipster couple struggling with some blown up chicharrón and the lack of any service had me defeated.
As I'm leaving I decide to tell the host who looked like an overweight Brian from Office Space with all the flair, that we're leaving we have waited too long.  He spins around and I tell him we waited 10 mins in the lobby and 15 mins at the table and didn't get served.  He replies ""it was not more than 5 minutes at front"".  Uhh ok maybe closer to 5 minutes of nobody greeting us on a slow Thursday: great point.  Then proceeds to say, ""you were angry when you came in here, you were never going to be happy."" Then pirouettes around and walks away from me.

Maybe they are dancing upon the hubris of their success over there, but bad service while bite you back in the end.

Though the options were limited on the Happy Hour menu,  I did try the Argentinian shrimp ($5 off) but went with beef tartare from the main menu as well.  I also ordered a few half price draft beers (originally $8; though only 4 options so very limited selection).  Wine and cocktails were unfortunately not affected by Happy Hour either.  And Happy Hour is strictly limited to the bar only as well (5:00-6:30).  I ordered their house old fashioned which was fantastic and strong.  I also got the Spring Mountain sour which was a little too experimental and tasted too much like beets for my liking but interesting nonetheless.  As only an drink and bounce, that's fine, but combined with food, it was a bit overpowering.  The shrimp were huge and tasty but not much going on in terms of outstanding taste.  However the tartare was fantastic; some of the best I've had.  And the bread had some Indian spices on it which were truly complimentary to the tartare.  Overall the meal was very nice and Sparrow and Wolf would be perfect for a dinner out off the strip.  It's very nice to see successful chefs in the area venturing off and creating their own small menu to call their own.  A big peeve I found was that the online menu clearly had not been updated, so one of the cocktails I wanted and the lamb tartare were no longer available.

1. Campfire duck - seared duck topped with foie gras. Enough said :)
2. Big ass pork shank - the pork is so tender!! The meat literally falls off the bone.
3. sweetbreads - This is very unique and flavorful dish. They use korean seasoning, so the dish has a spicy sweetness to it.
4. Udon - the ragu has a strong lamb flavor, which is perfect to me since i love anything lamb!
5. Spanish Octopus - tender with a nice grilled flavor on the octopus.

Notable runner ups are their beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, chinatown clams casino, hamachi, and oysters.

Also, don't forget to get their baked bread. Fresh baked and just perfect with the butter they serve!

For drinks, i love their have knives, will travel and their german slurpee cocktails.

The one thing I don't recommend is their bento box. It's pretty much a bento box of all their cured and raw selections. I just don't think charcuterie goes together with raw oyster, hamachi, and tartare. There's nothing special to the charcuterie selections offered, so for the price, I think better to get oyster, hamachi, or tartare alone.

+Service - From the hostess to the waitress to the bus boy, everyone was really nice and gave us great service

+Food - of course the most important part.  We found the food to be interesting and good quality, also reasonably priced for what it is.
+Hearth Baked Bread - Ridiculously good for just bread.  It's something you can share between 2 people, any more then that and you should just get another order.  The bread is incredibly crisp and delicious.
+Argentinean Red Shrimp - That sauce yummy!  The shrimp itself is sweet and grilled to perfection but that buttery sauce it's cooked in is the real winner
+Udon - It smells really gamey and I was a little put off, however when I took a bite, it didn't taste gamey at all.  The lamb has a great depth of flavor and the olives really add a lot to it.  I normally don't even like olives.
+Beef Check & Bone Marrow Dumplings - Beautifully plated and wonderful flavor.

The place is cozy, intimate and friendly. The fare superb. 
Tuna poke, wood fired lasagne, beef cheek and marrow dumplings and short rib (see pictures) just blew us away (my daughter and her husband from New York were my dining companions).
A lovely experience complemented by very friendly staff.",5RhE6tDc2xH6ySYGiSjiGQ,7,6,5,-DVstzGJ-iKd_93SiONjiQ

This time we got
-Ribeye special
-lobster dumplings
-maitake mushroom
-chinatown clams casino 
-lime creme brûlée 

Service was okay here this time. Didn't feel like our server went so much out of his way for us but it wasn't bad either. 

Finally got the full portion of the maitake mushrooms and it was just as good as the sample my friend made for me the first time I went. I almost finished the whole bowl to myself. I think that the clams are now 2 little ones for $7.50. I had ordered two pieces but our order came out with 4 shells. I was a little confused thinking they charged us for 4 but when the itemized check came out we were only charged for 2. Then I realized that the clams were a lot smaller than the last two times I went. We got the ribeye special cooked to medium. Sooo good and perfectly cooked! The lentils on this dish were amazing and everything went together so well. The lobster dumplings were eh. Not my personal fave, but honestly I think the bone marrow dumplings were better. For dessert I was torn between sticking to what I knew or trying something new. I loooove the honey toast here and it is honestly one of the reasons why I come back. I decided to step out of my comfort zone lol. I tried the lime creme brûlée, which our server suggested was better than the honey toast. I gave it a try, really delicious, buuuuuut.... I have to say my heart is stuck on the honey toast.

Overall, still a great dining experience and it was actually better than the last time I came in. I love this place and I will keep coming back so long there is honey toast hahaha.",JtpZw-NLL5m6BNjd0LPQVQ,0,0,5,hDl6T6gY5lXHIjZOiNcitA

Hamachi tartare - bland, can't taste the hamachi, lychee didn't do much to this.  The only interested thing about this app is the rice cracker since it is different than the typical tortilla chips.

Beef cheek & bone marrow dumpling - Meh, nothing different.  I could not taste the bone marrow.

Spanish Octopus  - this by far was the best dish of the evening.  The bacon bits seriously add the depth of flavor needed.  The octopus was tender.

Sweetbreads - no bueno...just a pile of mush that is too lightly dressed.  I don't give a shit about this dish.

Campfire duck - the presentation looks different than what others posted in the past.  For $34, we got a chewy small piece of duck with sinue, and a small piece of foie gras on top.  I was very disappointed in this dish.  

Calamansi tart - meh.

I came here with my bf around 5pm today. As we walked in, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or table so we chose to seat at the table. I noticed people walking in and they all sat at the bar and my bf heard them talking about happy hour. The hostess should have asks us if we wanted happy hour at the bar or dinner at the table.

Most of the dishes had good combination of ingredients and sounded unique. We put in some orders and was debating between Campfire Duck and Pork Shoulder, the waitress suggested twice to get both. 

The first order came out, called 'Chinatown Clams Casino. ' $7.50 each, pricey and it was just ok. Then 20 mins later, the second dish came out, it was Farm Egg. The dish was bland. The waitress push us three times to get the bread for dipping. The bread was $5 so I don't understand why she was trying to sell this.

The Beef cheek and bone marrow was presented beautifully but the taste was average. Our favorite was Campfire duck. We were planning to order more dishes but decided against it as the price wasn't worth it.

Their libations had interesting names. We went with Jump the Shark. It came in a cute shark cup but the drink was very acidic.

The ambience is nice for bringing dates. The food is just ok, but definitely not worth the price and the portion size. We left semi-hungry.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,8,1,3,BFTcPYWLKEdrtLWZ08u0sw

We waited for the hype to die down and the kinks to be worked out before we dropped by
last month. Wanting to try something new, Sparrow + Wolf seemed to be generating a lot of buzz within the community, so we came here and were not disappointed!

We started off with the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings. If you love Tacos de Cabeza, this is that same type of buttery, juicy meat. The wrapper had just the right chew, and 
Hearth Baked Bread with Cultured Butter was the perfect sidekick for the dumplings, as you will need it to clean up all the goodness in the bowl! Other reviews complain about paying for bread, but hey, it's just something we've grown accustomed to in the U.S. like the tipping system, and idiotic auto-grat BS...If you don't feel like paying, don't order it...simple as that.

For a TUF guy like me, the Campfire Duck was a no brainer. Fellow TUF guys and gals will surely agree that this dish is a MUST!
(TUF guy or gal- Lover of all things TRUFFLE, UNI, AND FOIE GRAS...;)  The Lamb Ragout with Udon was another winner, and  portions were perfect considering the price point, quality of ingredients used, and the caliber of chefs in the kitchen. Great to see Chefs Brian Howard and Justin Kingsley Hall (SLO-Boy) back in action! Great first visit,  and most certainly not the last! Gotta make it back for that 11pm Burger du Jour, and it would be cool to perhaps one day revisit some of SLO-Boy's
signature items as well....that Griddled Bread Pudding though! If you know, you know...ALOHA!!!

3611429,2018-06-10,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Fabulous evening at Sparrow + Wolf! Three of us enjoyed libations and dined at the bar. The atmosphere is undeniably hip. 

Andrew, our bartender, was as charming as he was deft at his craft.  For my cocktail, I ordered the The Golden Negroni, an off menu special, a clever blend of gin and a German Riesling. It was a refreshing concoction on a hot Vegas night; a perfect balance of crispness and sweetness in much the same way as bitting into a fresh picked apple. My husband's barrel-aged Old Fashioned was refined masculinity in a glass.

For our dining pleasure the three of us shared the Japanese sweet-potato as a prelude to our dinner. It was rich and salty from the crumbled bacon atop and the potato was creamy and decadent. Elevated comfort food at it's finest. 

For our main courses my husband had the sweetbreads, our friend had the duck and I ordered the grouper. The grouper was a delicious meaty fish perfectly seasoned  and cooked beautifully. Our friend's duck was plated with skillful elegance and also cooked expertly to a perfect rare. My husband raved over his meal as well. All of our meals displyed the thoughtful restraint of the chef whom allowed the food to shine by not over-complicating the dishes. 

We finished the evening by sharing the strawberry rhubarb shortcake and chocolate peanut butter torte special. Both desserts were sublime. The shortcake was sweet & tart and the house made whip was fantastically  creamy. The torte topped with a cherry compote was sinfully decadent.

I look forward to our next visit.",4vCJm6F8nhce4plWBOrDtA,2,2,5,2OB_P7B7otkFTlELarlNzg

When we arrived for our 8:30 reso the place was packed . It's a relatively small establishment with a smallish bar . When you walk in you I can see the chefs working on the dishes . 

The restaurant is small and a little loud but that can be expected in a new hip foodie spot. 

The service was a little slow we had to ask for water a few times . We also had to ask the server to remove empty plates and replace dishes with fresh ones . 

We had ordered probably close to 75% of the menu.  
The menu is small but explained very well by the service and the general manager when he delivers dishes has wonderful explanations of the dishes and also the restaurant as a whole.  

Favorite dishes - beef skewers with crepe
-duck
- halibut
- dumplings 



Dishes I'll skip next time - chicken wings 
- clams casino  
-artichoke 

The charcuterie plate was ok but we felt like cheese should also be on the plate although the cheese plate is on the dessert menu. We said we would just join both as a first course . 

The drinks were on par with most libations at foodie spots . 
 
I feel The goal is a social spot and we had a great time . There are no TVs in the restaurant or bar area  creating a more person to person social atmosphere . 

Overall a great spot . The music that played throughout dinner was spot on . We had a great time and all said we would be back .",PemAGpIKTHpBVRaRkDwJKQ,1,1,5,mtEGZMylNcx1wvw7hzdF4g

I am obsessed! Wow was I blown away by the craftsmanship or the bartenders. Not only that, but the energy of the staff and management was so positive and exciting. 

I would prefer the call these bartenders mixologists due to their extensive knowledge in beverage including spirits, extracts, aromatics... 

Luckily we came in toward the end of the night we so got a lot of one on one time with the most awesome bartender Terry Clark, and another amazing female bartender with Tattoo sleeves (sorry I didn't get your name!). 

They were both whipping up random concoctions to test and they will custom design a drink to your preferences. 
This is the type of bar I would want to be on a first name basis with all the mixologists. It's a very inviting space and the smell of bacon is intoxicating! 

I will definitely be back to try the food and hang out at the bar!

I love that the manager or chef come around and talk to the guests.  They engage by asking if we, the guests, have questions about the menu.  They help with suggestions and pairings enhancing the dinning experience.

This time around we got the Bento Box, Hamachi, Creekstone Farms Beef Skewer, Where There's Smoke and Model T. Sadly they were not playing hip hop this time around ayyye

The Bento Box comes with 6 oysters, 2 clams, shrimp, tuna tartar, crab, charcuterie, olives/pickled carrots/sweet onion and grilled bread w/lard. Highlights included the clams, shrimp and tuna tartar. I hate comparing restaurants, but the oysters here while fresh and tasty just doesn't offer the same interesting flavors as the oysters at Other Mama (who has better condiments and oysters). Everything else while delicious is nothing special. The grilled bread could either be toastier or softer as tearing it required some effort and wasn't the easiest to bite into, which made the terrines a bit much to eat. The three sauces (a pineapple, mayo, and cocktail condiment) could also use some reworking. The pineapple condiment worked well with the crab but overall they just didn't pack much flavor or work with most of the bento box except the cocktail-ish condiment working on the usual shrimp and oysters. You could find similar in many other French/New American restaurants. There is nothing new or unique or executed better than normal. I like the Bento Box (it's fresh and tasty), but it's unlikely I'll order it again or recommend it for others when there's so many other dishes here to try!

The Hamachi is fun in its presentation. The flavors here complement each other wonderfully and is a nice light dish to start your meal with.

The Beef Skewers... was sold out last time we visited, so we were very, very excited to finally be able to try it this time. The chickpea relish and crepe while tasty couldn't quite save this dish for me. Perhaps I'm not sure how skewers should be had but it was a bit dry and I like my red meats on the rarer, juicier side. The chickpea relish wasn't enough for me to offset that dryness. The meat still has good flavor, but if I were to recommend a heavier, meat dish I would definitely go with the campfire duck instead (which is straight fire!).

We finished this off with a Calamansi Tart, which was absolutely delicious! I usually find tarts too sweet or sour, but this was perfect! The vanilla merengue, blueberry all had a nice slight tang and crunch from the crust. This went by super fast. Enjoyed this dish over the Black Sesame Crepe (where the cherries just had too much of a punch). Would definitely like to see more dessert offerings here.

Not every dish will be a hit, but the freshness of the ingredients used here are undeniable. Everything has a nice clean, rich palette to it.

5 Stars for the very personable and friendly service, but today's dishes would otherwise have been a 4.",XjyTxD6wAINeTsclXB6LeQ,1,1,5,_z7ItIdIrJKY0X4cTySuIw

Items served were:

Charcuterie platter with lardo and culatello ham
Lamb tartare with bhatura bread
Hearth baked bread
Artichoke with white bean hummus, charred tomatillo, mortared herbs, pine nuts & arugula
Butcher wings
Beef skewer
Black truffle meatballs with bonito flakes
Chinatown clams on the half shell
Duck breast with foie gras
Lamb ragu with udon noodles
Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings
Sweetbreads with grilled romaine hearts, smoked bacon, English peas & fond blanc
Tres Leches--vanilla bean, orange and cocoa nib crunch
Calamansi tart with vanilla meringue and blueberries
Black sesame crêpe with cherry yuzu, marmalade, and whipped cream

With the selection we opted for, there was something for everyone.  The charcuterie platter was nicely done with the N'duja being tops in flavor.  The lamb tartare was very good with the apple and walnuts, as were the black truffle meatballs topped with bonito flakes.  Another favorite of mine was the duck breast with foie gras.  The beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings need work.  The dumpling was very chewy. 

Of the desserts we tried, the Calamansi tart and the tres leches were my picks.  The tart was excellent and the tart was a good sized dish meant for sharing.

Service was very good and the music was at a level that allowed conversation while still being able to hear the music.  Later as more people arrived, the sound in the restaurant picked up but it was never loud.

Highlights of our happy hour experience were Chinatown claims casino and house charcuterie.  Our bartender Sarah made several choices for our charcuterie and it was finger-licking good.  My friends tried several of the craft cocktails (sorry, I was on wine time) and loved them all, especially the where theres' smoke.  We were visited by one of the co-owners and he really personalized our experience, gave us some of the backstory of how Sparrow + Wolf came to be and the genesis of some of the menu items.

Service: The hostess seated us immediately on a very busy Thursday evening.  Our server was very attentive throughout the evening and the dishes all came out timely.  Throughout our dinner, the manager who i found out later was the owner Brian Howard assisted the server with our table and other tables as well.  He checked on us to ensure we were enjoying our dishes which i totally appreciated.

Food & Drinky Drinks: For drinks, I tried the jump the shark and the spring mountain sour.  Jump the Shark can in a very cool shark headed glass, but the Spring Mountain sour was the winner of the two when it came down to taste.   A very cool mixologist cocktail.
This is a place to go with a foodie friend and sample a lot of dishes and my favorites were the:
Chinatown Clams: Tasty and after one order, we had to order another one quickly.
Farm Egg: The pickled asparagus and feta mixed with the egg all complimented each other.
Campfire Duck:  Great preparation of the duck for this dish. Ordering next time.
Hamachi: Very fresh and digging it served on the rice paper.

Ambiance: It's a smaller dining area that I assumed it would be but very trendy, contemporary and dimly lit for a great date night.  Lots of dark wood. which keeps it classy.  Noisy because everyone is seated closely and there's definitely a pulse, but not too noisy where it distracts from table conversation.

Location is great and I love the great mixology options along with some interesting dishes to sample.  If you're sampling a lot of dishes, the bill can add up quickly but the quality of food is fantastic.  After this first visit, future visits and dishes are coming in the near future.

Promptly seated in the only area suitable for a large group.  Rest of the restaurant was pretty full. Waitress was quick to greet. 

So there was one person in the group that is a bit of a wine snob, more because she reacts poorly to sulfates.  The manager came over and was incredibly helpful in providing suggestions. Settled with a Chilean red that was not even on the menu.  Great suggestion. 

The manager suggested the Benito Box.  Another superior choice. Fed 6 quite well.  The waitress suggested nearly the perfect amount of food for the table. All was outstanding and I mean outstanding.

CHILLED LOBSTER- cute little tail over eggplant + pesto

I must say this place has great potential HOWEVER...
Called ahead and a table was available. 
Small room, intimate but loud. If that makes any sense. 
The hostess informed us that they had just re-opened after re-tooling the entire menu.  This information really did not need to be disclosed. It just made us wonder why, and if something was wrong. 

We were sat right away at a deuce in the middle of the room. But with no reservation on a Saturday night we weren't going to be too picky. 

The server came to the table and just started our order. No greeting. No menu explanation. No specials. Nothing. So I introduced myself to her and greeted her instead to get things going. 

We ordered cocktails before dinner. It took, and I am not exaggerating, 20 minutes to get an Old Fashion and a glass of wine. 

We decided to order the charcuterie plate as a first course. A few minutes later she asked us if we wanted to order apps. So we did. 35 minutes later the second courses of apps arrived. When we asked for the first course they just said this is how it comes out. So finally after another ten minutes the manager brought out the first course. 
The server talked me into the foie gras special app. At Market Price. Watch out for MP!  $30 for this dish. 

Now it's been an hour and a half and we are really digging the food. Amazing flavor. The chef is very talented. The use of beets in 3 out of four of our dishes but all completely different in taste and texture was amazing. 

When it came to finally ordering our main course we were informed that they were out of the dish. When u only have five entrees and u run out of one at 8 pm that's not a good sign. 

The GF didn't want or couldn't eat any of the other four entrees so we decided to go directly to dessert and after dinner cocktail. 

Upon finishing I tried unsuccessfully to wave down our server for fifteen more minutes. By now I am tired and getting ornery and just wanted to go home. 

All in all the food was amazing. But the operations needs ALOT of work still. 
I just don't know if I want to spend another two and a half hours and not even get dinner for another $150.

We sat at the bar as the hostess told us that's the only way to enjoy their happy hour - they only have a drinks happy hour no more food HH like my friend had on her last visit. 

The place looks really nice, it's small but feels inviting and most of the staff is pretty friendly.

We looked through the menu and it was a little hard to pick something as they don't have a lot of options but a lot of them were pretty tempting. I chose the Hamachi carpaccio and asked for a REALLY sweet drink -
 I have the feeling our bartender heard something completely different when we talked about the drink because he gave me a really bitter drink he made with beer and whatever else he mixed with it. 

The food and my drink presentations were, hands down, the best. Everything looked seriously beautiful! 
I was so very pleased when I saw my carpaccio but when it came to the taste I was a bit disappointed. I felt like all the seasoning was done in the center of it and the edge parts tasted really plain (just raw fish with black pepper).

We ordered desserts and I ordered the Terrine while my friend ordered their Shortcake. Once again the presentation was awesome, but yeah the taste wasn't amazing to either of us.
I did see other things I'd like to try on their Menu but I'm a little hesitant since everything I ordered - literally - disappointed me.

We started with a huge fresh salad, whole roasted vadouvan cauliflower, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings (I'm eating only this next time), steak, chicken and some lovely desserts.  I'm not a dessert person so I don't always remember those so well. The cauliflower was not on the regular menu that night, so we had a lot of interest and jealous stares, and ended up sharing some with the table next to us. 

I rarely remember to review places anymore, but I want to remember this place in Chinatown for the next time I'm in Vegas.  Everything was simple but delicious.

I called a couple of different times trying to get same day reservations, but with no luck. (I am terrible at planning out my food more than a day in advance. Who knows what they want to eat tomorrow? Not me!)
Anyway this time I called and they said they could seat us at 5:15 or 9:30.... ugh, I was desperate to try them so I took the 5:15. 
We arrived on time, and were seated immediately as more than half the restaurant was empty. They did just open at 5:00 though.
I had done my research, read reviews on Yelp, and knew going in there were some must have dishes. I was a bit disappointed though that some of the items I wanted were not available, their menu is seasonal, which is understandable, but still disappointing. No Argentinian Red Shrimp, or Butcher Wings in the fall I guess. 
We started with the Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings and the Homemade Bread and Butter. Both were delicious and I highly recommend the combination as the bread is fabulous at soaking up all the delicious broth from the dumplings.
Our entrees were the Campfire Duck and the Udon with Lamb Bolognese to which I added an egg.
Both were delicious! I have absolutely no complaints over the quality of the food what so ever.
I did feel like it took an extra long amount of time for the food to come out, both the appetizers and then the entrees. But it was definitely worth the wait. 
I was a little irritated at the fact that even as we were leaving the restaurant almost half the tables were still empty. Either they had a whole lot of no shows that night or they could have gave us a better dinner reservation time.
I do recommend this place as a great ""date night"" restaurant. Just make sure and call a couple of days ahead to make your reservation.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,5,4,4,5xepQw95Im0KlHT_2ykR0g

Our waiter was really sweet & accommodating, if only I could remember his name.

My friend and I order the oysters, the big ass pork shank (yes, that's the actual name), and the Bone Marrow Log with escargot and mushrooms. It doesn't seem like a lot of food but it was really filling for two people. Especially, the big ass pork shank! Everything was very flavorful and the pork shank melted in your mouth. I highly recommend it as well as the bone marrow log. I actually recommend everything we ordered. We were not disappointed at all. 

As for the drinks, they're on the pricier side but they did come in a cool, rose gold Gnome. Sadly, we couldn't keep it but it was definitely IG worthy!

I recently joined an epicurean club, who invited by Jacob and me to come to dinner with them for a special crafted tasting menu tonight. I am so happy that I have finally come here!

As a resident of China Town, I have never been surprised by the variety of restaurants that are located here, until tonight. This farm to table restaurant with a variety of creative small plates, has blown my mind!

Because there were so many dishes we tried today, I placed a small description of each item under the photos. Some of the orders were specially made for us, so I'm not entirely sure of everything ate, although I enjoyed it all anyways! Originally they were informed there was only 6 of us, Jacob and I were last minute additions and they so kindly helped seat us all anyways. 

Our server was extremely kind and informative and we were also greeted by the chef who regularly makes an appearance in the dining room. I loved how personal he made each experience and the multitude of specialty items we had tonight. 

My favorite item was by far the bone marrow, and I wish it was on the menu for me to come back and try. It just melted in your mouth and was so sweet and succulent at the same time! I loved the seasonality of the dishes and know that each time I come in will be a new experience. 

For a Wednesday night I was extremely surprised at how packed this place was in China Town! I loved the lively ambience even in such a dark space. I had so much fun tonight, this was not only a dinner to me, but also an experience, Sparrow + Wolf has exceeded my expectations, and I will definitely be back here!

4574262,2017-09-26,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Service: I made reservations here for my sisters birthday on 9/14/2017 (1 week prior to the reservation date) for 16 people and called and confirmed it that same day to make sure my sister b-day would go as planned and reminding them it's for birthday. The lady on the phone informed me that the manager might call me to tell me about a pre-fixed menu for the large party. I never received a call until the day of my reservation at 2:30 pm and the manager was calling to confirm my reservation and he asked me how many people will be joining the dinner because if its more than 13 people there will be a $45 minimum for each person because it's too late to make a prefixed menu for our party. So I was given 30 minutes to confirm how many people will be showing up to our dinner. I was confirmed 12 people which allowed us to be in a semi-private area which was really nice looking. I called the manager back and told him how many people will be attending and another reminder that it was for my sisters birthday. He said thank you for confirming the reservation and that we'll be taken care of. 

When we arrived at the restaurant everything was good and we needed an extra chair cause my sisters husband attended the dinner but didn't eat. I don't think the restaurant was too fond that we needed an extra chair. since that would technically be 13 people. We were only given water once in the whole hour and a half we were there. Our waitress barely came to check on us. When we first got there all the tables were filled but it died down after 10 PM since they close at 11 PM. When I asked our waitress if I can pay a part of the bill because I had to leave earlier than everyone else she just said, ""Oh perfect! I'll bring the check right over"" when my sister and her friends were clearly drinking still. I just need to leave a lot earlier but it forced everyone else to finish up and pay. I felt bad but I guess it's my fault i wasn't more aggressive towards stating that I'm the only one that wants to leave. She didn't ask about dessert at the end all she asked was ""Is there anything else you guys want because the kitchen is closing in 5 minutes?"" So we just said no because it was kind of passive aggressive how she said it. So i guess this restaurant doesn't give a free dessert for birthdays but we weren't even offered dessert even if we paid for it. The bill was paid all cash which makes it better for them and I don't know if they split tips but it was a auto-gratuity of $80 for a server that didn't accommodate us at all. 

I can hate because I work in the industry and I always make sure all guests/customers are well taken care of. Especially for huge parties like that since the tip will be auto-gratuity.

Food: We ordered 2 Bento Boxes (3-Tier assorted shellfish, 6 oysters with 3 different toppings, cured meat with bread) and 2 of the Beef Cheek Bone-Marrow Dumplings and lots of cocktails and wine (at least 13 drinks were ordered) The Bento Box had a great variety of food, I wouldn't recommend it if you are not into raw fish, but if you enjoy raw fish this is the dish to turn to.  the Beef Cheek Bone-Marrow Dumplings are good it came with 5 dumplings.

Drinks: For drinks I ordered the Spring Mountain Sour which was my favorite drink and Jump the Shark which came with a cool shark cup. 

Summary: My huge downfall on this restaurant is service which is surprising cause it's new. I would only recommend coming here if it's only 2 of you. Maybe you'll be better taken care of. Don't come here in large parties. The food was so-so but the hamachi and oysters were definitely good and all their cocktails are great as well.",G_yIAts-NuBdnp1uYEszpQ,2,0,2,we0DSOeDB9jHyHe8kEisew

They did adjust the price of our clams casino but not for our drinks.

Hmm.. weird. I am in no way shape or form intoxicated and I could have sworn the happy hour menu they handed us at first had $8 specialty cocktails on it, but I'm not in an arguing mood today. The food and drinks were good. I would say some of the best cocktails I've had in recent years.

The design and decor makes this place different from the other culture cuisines that you would find in the Chinatown location. You will see the drastic change in the atmosphere when walking from the parking lot to opening the doors of the restaurant. I didn't have much expectation since I haven't ever really gone to a place with this type of mood in the Chinatown area. It is not comparable to the culture cuisines in that area, also being that the restaurant before Sparrow+Wolf opened use to be a Vietnamese pho restaurant. 
This atmosphere is great for any occasion from hanging out with a few friends and having a drink or for a date night.
The menu selection is not overwhelming and the libations are also what catches the eye at the tables. The food and plating also caught the eye because it was not far from the looks of the restaurants on the strip! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The oysters were really good along with the lamb.

Anyway, we went ahead and ordered 2 of the udon, maitake mushrooms, and scallops. The udon came out first, then the mushrooms. There was a 10-15 minute wait after the udon then the scallops came out... but trust me when I say it was totally worth the wait! So buttery and so so good. The udon was cooked perfectly.

DINNER

I have lived in Las Vegas for 7.5 years. I have dined out quite often here, both on and off the Strip & Downtown. (I am not one of those locals that eschews the Strip, I'll go anywhere if it is enticing, and the Strip has been, many times.) I just finished posting all of the details of last night's meal at Sparrow + Wolf on my Facebook. I do not feel I have to do that here. I just came here to say this. Last night this restaurant served me one of the greatest meals I've ever had. And I've had incredible meals in the past, from all around the world. Wolfgang Puck (+Ed LaDou+Mark Peel+Nancy Silverton+...) in LA in 1982 3 weeks after the first Spago opened. Ken Frank at La Toque, in LA in the 1980s as well as Napa Valley in 2005. Pierre Gagnaire in LA in 1998, and in Paris in 2000. Charlie Trotter in Chicago in 1998. Thomas Keller at the French Laundry in 2006. Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park in 2009. And there have been others. And now Brian Howard has been added to my list. In addition to every dish being absolutely exquisite, the service was downright jawdropping, in that every single seat in the dining room and bar was filled, and yet the staff went out of their way to be attentive and friendly.

Service: five stars. We sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive; both the bar staff and the general crew. When they brought us our food, they explained the dishes in details. I really liked that because it built up the anticipations! 

Food: five stars. Half a dozen fresh oysters with three different toppings: lemon jelly, pineapple flavored something and a mint something. They were all good but my personal favorite was the mint.  Artichoke salad: so delicious with the hearts of artichoke as the bed with flowers and deep fried leaves and fresh vegetables on top.  Pork shoulder - stuffed in some sort of casing and garnished with the yellow dikon pickle and black garlic paste. It was a good dish but I thought the shoulder meat could be more tender and flavorful.  Last but most definitely not least and my absolute personal favorite: the duck. Slices of perfectly seared, medium rare duck topped with a generous piece of foie gras. The perfect combination of the duck and the foie gras in each bite was orgasmic.  I purposefully chose a glass of the Troublemaker from Paso Robles just for this dish and it was heaven. 

I am so in love with every aspect of S&W. The people that work there are super friendly and good at their jobs. We even met the manager, John, and he was so much fun and kind. He made us felt so welcome and like we were frequent patrons, which we will now become.

We came in at 5:15 PM, literally when they opened(Opens at 5 PM).  We didn't think we were going to end up eating and drinking for $220/person.  LOL, definitely came with a foodie group.  We didn't know what to order as a group so we asked if they would do food tasting.  Only because we came when they open, they agreed to do the $135-$145(I forget.)/person.  There are 3 different price ranges.  We did the most expensive because everyone wanted the bone marrow and oysters.  Plus on the top of that, we ordered 3-4 bottles of wine and some cocktails.  It makes sense why the bill came out that high.  The food and service was great.  We loved the presentation when the food was delivered to us with all the kitchen staffs.

5023006,2018-02-02,3,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"It was our first night in town.  The wife and I had made it point to dine off-Strip as much as possible to experience some of the great spots that only the locals know about.  As a result, we made our way off-Strip for dinner on a Thursday night at SPARROW + WOLF.  The chef, Brian Howard, was the chef at Comme Ça, a place that we had really enjoyed when it was open at the Cosmo.  We arrived around 6PM.  We were greeted with a smile by the hostess as we walked in the door.  The dining room was fairly empty, but we requested to sit at the bar.     

Sparrow + Wolf's cuisine was eclectic American but with seeming Japanese influences.  While we looked over the menu, I started off with a We Can Prevent Forest Fires ($14) made with Dalmore 12-year old Scotch, Cynar, Vida Del Maguel Mezcal, lemon, pine simple syrup, and garnished with a flamed rosemary sprig.  It was a delicious mix of boozy, bitter, goodness with a pronounced, but balanced smokey note.  Although the standard menu looked great, we decided on the Chef's Tasting Menu ($125/person) with beverage pairings ($45/person).  Since there wasn't a printed tasting menu, it's likely safe to say that it changes frequently, if not daily.  Most, if not all, of dishes that we received didn't appear to come off of the regular menu.  Every dish that we received seemed to be made fresh to order, incorporating high quality ingredients, and beautifully presented.  We found every course enormously satisfying.  The beverage pairings were spot on with the food and generous.  Service throughout was friendly and attentive, making us tourists feel like local regulars.  Sparrow + Wolf was an excellent start to our week of dining in Las Vegas.  Locals have probably already gotten the word on this place, but I'd highly recommend it for those adventurous (i.e. willing to leave the Strip) out-of-towners looking for an amazing food easily accessible from/to the Strip by Uber or Lyft.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,6,6,5,XY1_ban3sa5ooWE5q-ldeg

5093172,2017-06-09,3,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Was super excited to come in to try this place. Our expectations were pretty high having dined and loving Comme Ca. Interior and atmosphere was very nice smelled of wood fire which was lovely. Only complaint would be that the tables were super close together which made a bit of a tight squeeze getting in and out. Another down side was the arguing couple right next to us who was almost elbow to elbow. It felt like the crazy lady was kinda yelling at me bc of how close they were. It was even harder to look away bc I could see her frowny face from the corner of my eye without even trying 


* Get Off The Lawn was very strong. Served with an orange peel and a very very small beef jerky that is supposed to be eaten while you drink ..gonna need a much bigger piece of jerky to go with that drink tho lol

* Model T - was good. Cucumber was very refreshing 

* Beef Cheek & Marrow Dumplings - We ordered this to start when we ordered our drinks but it never came out bummer bc I really wanted to try this. (We probably sat at our table foodless for at least 30 mins) 

* Duck & Foie Gras - Amazeballs!! This was the first food item to come out to our table. Comes with 3 slices of duck breast over wood ear mushrooms topped with a good piece of foie gras in a savory sauce.

* Butcher Wings - sold by per wing. Really liked the wood fired char taste to it. Very moist as a wing should be. 

* Argentinean Red Shrimp - Served with 3 shrimps with heads on a plate. Really enjoyed the sauce it came in 

* Beef Carpaccio - Good 

* Sweetbreads - Good. Haven't had good sweetbreads since Rosemarys was still open. Loved everything about this dish from the sweetbreads to grilled baby romaine wrapped with bacon to the sweet english peas and pea shoots 

Tres Leches - kinda torn on this one. Served with the cake on the bottom and a chocolate Hennessy moose on top with chocolate tuilles. I'm a Hennessy shot drinker myself but the amount of cognac in the moose made the flavor too strong to enjoy. If you love the strong taste of cognac then you will like this cake more than I did.

Overall the food is good. The portions are on the smaller size but you are paying the higher price for the better quality. After being open for 1 month the service could be better. Our server was nice but she did not check back on us often. After she took our drink order and failed to put in our dumpling order she never came back to take our food order. We had to wave her down after we finished our drinks to take our food order then had to ask another server for a dessert menu. We will be back to try the other yummy items on the menu. Still want to try the dumplings we missed. Heard the happy hour is coming soon definitely can't wait for that one",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,9,7,4,wSRfOewdjrJvD-_lp3cqzQ
5094883,2017-06-15,21,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Pardon my French but F*** Me!  Coup de foudre.  This is what happens when you let a chef play.  Brainchild of Chef Brian Howard of Comme Ca Vegas, this new eatery is a stunner.

Global cusine with a nod ot Asia. (possibly owing to it's Chinatown location).  Dishes are bold and rich offset with herbs, sprouts, flowers, and greens.   Beautiful plates of playful food that won't tire your palate.

The perfect expression of this, the outstanding sweetbreads.  Crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside, nice offal flavors.  Along side, bacon wrapped baby romaine lettuce, an interesting foil, that makes no sense until you combine it with the sweet peas and vegetal, raw pea tendrils and herbs; a great way to add brightness to the dish.  Bacon fat plays a role in the sauce bringing the dish together.

Artichoke, a take on the roasted artichokes of the Jewish quarter of Rome, excellent.  Bitter, crisp, creamy all at the same time.  It's flavor elevated by the white bean hummus, charred tomatillos, peppery wilted arugula, and pine nuts and a dousing of olive oil.  

The beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling showcases tender beef cheeks enriched by melting bone marrow.  The wrap, relatively thick and cooked al dente, bordering on being too chewy but holds everything in.  The peppery beef perfectly matches the green onion emulsion but the use of foam; sorry I always think of cat spit, not appealing.  It's just me.

THE showstopper, albeit it inconsistent, the ""campfire duck"".  Holy $hit!  Beautifully rendered fat (almost no white under the skin), perfect mid rare, topped with a melting, pan seared thick slice of foie sprinkled with a few crystals of rock salt that adds burst of texture and flavor.  The whole thing sits on earthy, wood ear mushroom slivers and briny Japanese cucumber pickles (what you'd find in a bento). An Asian inspired, sweet sour plum and duck jus ties it together.  Sublime.  Sadly the fat of a duck breast from a second order (placed later in the meal) was so poorly rendered, disappointing. 

The head on Argentinean red shrimp (creamy head fat with lime butter; just saying) and culatello both delish.  If that's not enough, get the hearth baked bread.  A true European style bread with great texture, perfect for mopping up any savory juices that remain on any dish.

Creative craft cocktails.  Well chosen wine list with very reasonable, off Strip pricing.

Check out their FB for promotions and specials.  HH from 5:30 - 6:30.

Addendum:  Be sure to check out Burger Night (Thursday - Saturday 11PM - close).  Great blend of cuts, cooked to temp, topped with burata and arugula plus a COEDO black lager for $20; steal!

For this visit, we started off with their charcutterie plate. If you like spicy sausage, you'll love the thinly sliced hunters sausage. We also had their pâte, which went well with the onion marmalade. And slices of their cows milk cheese; nothing really special, but good.

Now, their beef dumplings in celery foam is more what this restaurant is about. The flavors were unique, on top of the preparation. Everything was just so well balanced, and I believe the bone marrow was in Au jus. Amazing. 

For the entree, I went wood fired lasagna with miso and burrata. It retrospect, I should've realized it was going to be kinda soupy. Still, the flavors were delicious. And the accompanying garlic bread was perfect in between bites. It was also nice the owner came over to see how we were enjoying our meal.

Went with a party of 4. Table ready when we arrived, seated quickly. 

Our server came out and explained the menu and drinks to us, to include what wasn't listed on the menu. 

Two ordered drinks, Jump the Shark, and a German slushie(I think). The ladies that ordered them loved them. 

We did the heirloom tomato salad as a start and the made in house sourdough bread. Great bread, and the tomatoes salad was fresh, tasty and perfectly seasoned. 

Entrees were the big a$$ pork shank, duck, beef skewers, and the beef dumplings. All were great, but the pork was amazing. Portions were very good sized and perfect for sharing. 

Desert was a lemon tart and the beignets plate. All fantastic.

Tried the Beef cheek & bone marrow dumpling it was very tasty and on point. It did not taste or feel fatty with the bone marrow.

Also ordered the Chinatown Clams Casino which was clams on the half shell topped with fresh uni. This was very good must order!
the lemon blueberry tart was a very good desert dish and it was not too tarty or sour at all.

5279601,2018-05-01,6,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"No longer the ""hot new spot"" in a city where that title changes almost weekly, Friday nonetheless found Sparrow + Wolf packed just prior to a 7:30pm reservation, the smell of a warm hearth welcoming guests at forty feet with additional greetings offered first from a hostess at the podium and subsequently by GM John Anthony

Tightly packed and excessively loud, an overhead soundtrack added to a cacophony created by too much Alcohol and guests shouting to be heard above the din, it was mere moments after seating that a young woman approached to collect Menus as she'd been informed of the table's choice to invest $125 each in a family-style Carte Blanche, Beverages coming in two rounds with the first happily seeing a return of the German Slurpee alongside others with clever names included the fruity yet complex Ichigo Time and easy-drinking Violet Beauregarde

Happy to adapt a menu to the group's preferences, allergies or intolerances, a majority of the 150 minutes anchored by currently offered plates with additional daily Chef's inspirations, it was together with an assortment of Pickles and Fermentations that course one was presented by Chef Howard, the King Salmon Poke immediately attesting to high quality product accented by acid and heat, this theme recurring throughout the evening but never redundant in the way other ""fusion-y"" places tend to be

Matching the glistening cubes of Fish plus its crispy Rice vehicle to a second Tartare of Beets and sour Apples, the vegetarian affair one of Sin City's best 'Beet Salads' as a result of both texture and taste, it was prior to three styles of Oysters that a true treat arrived in the form of Japanese Milk Fish flown in that day from Tsukiji Market, the flatly pounded specimen almost melting on the tongue beneath  a  light brushing of Pepper plus the sweet n savory interplay of Grapes and Caviar

Graciously accepting Chef's suggestion to raise the lights a bit, an oddly placed Blue bulb nevertheless casting a glow across diners and tablescape, it was fast on the heels of $5 Sourdough which has grown in size that the first of two hot courses arrived, the bowl of roasted Mushrooms mingling with Hummus and Sunchokes a bit earthy for some though beautiful in the eyes of others while BBQ Salsify was a crowd-pleaser thanks to its surprising sweetness plus tenderness akin to slow-roasted Pork lent a savory finish by Sesame and light charring

Growing heavier henceforth, Howard's Foie Gras presenting a nicely seared Steak atop French Toast with boozy Pineapples and Cream, it was an honor to be one of the first to taste Chef's soon-to-debut ""Beef n Cheddar"" straight from the kitchen, its caramelized Marrow providing an unctuous backdrop to traditional Parsley Salad and fragrant Cheese Sauce with Wagyu Beef Tendon both top and bottom

Here taking on two new Cocktails, Easy Peasey a bit too minty for most while Molly Ringwald is an easy sipper, it was with five additional items that savories came to an end, the meaty Grouper straight out of Florida as good a piece of Fish as one will find anywhere on The Strip but with better Potatoes and saucing while the Short Rib will happily see guests wiping up its sticky remnants with ""White Bread,"" the same act of scarpetta likely to occur with Garlic Bread accompanying the crispy Lasagna loaded with Bechamel and Lamb Bolognese
 
Not forgetting skewered Sprouts or a Japanese Sweet Potato that redefines ""loaded"" by way of tons of umami given stability by Crème Fraiche, the latter a personal pick for the menu's best item, it was with only nine of the (jokingly) promised fifteen Desserts that Dinner came to a conclusion, the smaller bites highlighted by ""Moon Rocks"" that pitch Lychee as Peanut Butter's Jam beneath a veil of Cardamom while Howard's Lemon 'Soufflé' Cake eats lighter than most actual Soufflés with a full-frontal assault of Citrus that will appease anyone who disregards Chocolate in favor of a Fruit finish

At this point well-sated, Sparrow + Wolf's lack of online menu prices no different than the likes of Sage or Aureole for similar portions and ingredients, it was in homage to its Spring Mountain address that the Kitchen finished with Asian accented Strawberries + Cream plus Panna Cotta that saw an unlikely pairing of Black Sesame with Rhubarb, though neither were as memorable as Howard's Honey Toast that tops caramelized Bread Pudding at this time with Oranges and warming Thai Basil Ice Cream that leads nicely into dense Chocolate Truffles with their own peasant Peppercorn sting

****1/2: Almost completely reinventing the menu twice-over in the past ten months, the nearly-deafening volume a lone complaint as shouting to hear ones date or having to ask a server thrice what is being served can be grating, there is no doubt that Brian Howard has found a style all his own on Spring Mountain Road and for the sake of Las Vegas' local dining scene one must hope that the place remains packed and (ideally less) loud for many years",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,14,5,yypRmbEkvlznPmByJqfWvg

5319797,2017-05-19,10,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"This wasn't the original plan for a post-workout meal. Needless to say, I was underdressed for this place (I was the only person in Lululemon and Nikes) full of hipsters, beards and tattoos. I seemed lost and confused...the crowd seemed like they should be in Downtown Las Vegas but they're in Chinatown.

What was even confusing to me was the beautifully-plated food that belongs on The Strip. Chef Brian Howard brought his A-game to Chinatown in a rather unassuming stripmall. The interior is small and modern. The food was complex but has familiar flavors. You can taste Asian, Indian/ Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean influences.

The menu is simple with less than 20 items to choose from - you want a small menu so, the kitchen can focus on perfecting the dishes they have. And believe me, the items I tried did not disappoint. All delicious and beautiful.

Hamachi:
Thin slices of Hamachi on fish-cracker/pork rind with citrus and lychee, miso schmaltz, scallion, and buckwheat. Great textures and flavors with a fine balance. 5/5

Artichoke:
Crunchy exterior with a soft and almost creamy artichoke center on a bed of charred tomatillo, herbs, hummus...sprinkled with pine nuts and arugula. This has Mediterranean + Middle Eastern flavors to it. 5/5

Chinatown Clams Casino:
I'm not fond of clams but I gave it a try anyway. This has shiitake mushrooms, lap cheong, and uni hollandaise. It has a rich and creamy feel to it. 5/5

Beef and Cheek Bone Marrow Dumpling:
Dumplings with green onion emulsion. The least appealing dish of the evening (see picture). But appearance aside, these dumplings taste good. I liked the pepperiness of this dish to balance the richness of the beef cheek and bone marrow. The dumplings were cooked al dente so they have a nice bite 4/5

Pork Shoulder:
A patty made with pork shoulder with crushed peanuts and a schmear of black garlic on the side. This has Chinese and Thai flavors to it. The pork was tender with a hint of ginger. 5/5

Beef Skewer:
Tender and flavorful pieces of grilled beef with a side of sweet and sour chickpea relish, and Vadouvan crepe + smoked tallow butter. You get Indian + Middle Eastern flavors. Use the crepe to scoop up the relish and juices (like you would with injera). 5/5

Calamansi Tart:
Calamansi is a small citrus fruit from Southeast Asia - mainly the Philippines. I'm not a big fan of citrusy desserts but this I liked a lot. Calamansi can be overly tart but if done right, it's superb! Creamy calamansi custard topped with torched marshmallow on a crisp tart. 5/5

The service was excellent. The food came out at a reasonable pace. We got to meet Chef Brian. It was an overall delightful experience.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,18,18,5,ImHN5RVXhUeI9c6xV4X2Ng

5401505,2017-08-18,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"As soon as we walked into the restaurant, the first thing I noticed is how hot it is inside the restaurant. It is uncomfortable. The restaurant is small and quite boring. There are ceiling fans going but it's not helping. The ambience is nothing to write home about, and all I see is a bunch of people getting mixed drinks at the bar. Therefore, I think this is a great place if you like to drink.
As we walked in, with reservations, we were placed at a very uncomfortable small table right next to where the waiters have their water pitchers and likely put their orders in. We request a different table, preferably a booth, and it is not available. We accept a different table, but it too is positioned in such a way that, when the restaurant is full, there is no ability to move your chair around without hitting the chair of the person behind you.
We look at the menu and have to ask how it works. As we look at the menu, we start laughing, realizing that this restaurant charges five dollars for bread and butter. Really? Unfortunately, nothing on the menu seemed appetizing. Initially, I thought let's try a couple of things on the menu to see what they're like. My friend and I decided to opt against that for the following reason: the restaurant was not full... Probably only a quarter full... And it was so hot in there. So uncomfortable and so stuffy. With the incredible variety of options in Las Vegas, we chose to simply get up and leave, which we informed the hostess of so she could give the table to someone else, should they need it. I was really excited about trying this restaurant. The disappointment that I felt as soon as I walked into this restaurant... I would not try to come back to this restaurant, nor will I recommend it to any friends. For me, the ambience and comfort of a restaurant is as important as the food that is coming to your table.

5428961,2018-04-02,1,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"This restaurant was packed so we ate at the bar. If Yelp allowed .5 stars this would be a 4.5/5. We ordered a bunch of smaller plates and shared those as opposed to getting entrees. Portions are decent sized for two but we were sharing between 3-5 of us. What we ordered:

Hearth Baked Bread - It's good bread with good butter. Would be dope if it came with the meal but not complaining.

King Salmon Poke - This dish was crazy good. It wasn't spicy but the spice for some reason coated your tongue and made it numb. On the rice puff cracker there are blood orange and lemon jelly/jam/puree that when consumed cuts through that layer of numb oil coating your tongue giving your taste buds life again.

Uni Melt - So fire. Mini grilled cheese sandwiches with uni. The blood orange and bacon jam on the side is so fire...

Barbecued Salsify - Cousin of carrot, barbecued and mixed with different spices. Never had Gochujang but it looked like it was dipped in it.

Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings - Nothing to say but fire.

Brussel Sprouts Robata - Done really well, was curious about the jungle curry as it must have been really subtle. 

Wood Fired Lasagna - Not a fan of lamb but it was done really well to the point that I couldn't distinguish whether it was lamb or beef. This dish was probably the most filling as it was dense as fuck.

Their drink programs is excellent here with many different unique and instagrammable as fuck options. We ordered:

Burn The Witch - A strong tasting drink in where they light some shit on fire and place the cinnamon-y aromatic smoke in the drink. Tasted exactly like what you would expect based off reading on the menu.

Shrubbin Bubbles - A very light and sweet drink. For the....you know

Lost In The Woods - The name for some reason reminds me of Kokiri Forest. Shout out to the nerds out there. A very well done drink.

Overall this restaurant is interesting and it seems like their menu is ever-changing which is a good thing.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,1,0,5,tHgkm7F6o9qz-IRyodbi9Q
5434986,2017-10-04,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Sparrow + Wolf is a hot & new trending must try restaurant! My friends decided to take me out for my birthday celebration. They know I love places that I can wine & dine at and this definitely the place to go. Even if it's a birthday, date night or just to explore amazing types of food. Amazing on reservations for a Friday night and seating your party together!

We first started off with drinks. First, we tried Spring Mountain Sour that was like a sweet volcano in your mouth with plum & beet with a spruce of lemon zest all in one! Second, we tried Model T, which definitely takes a name after itself. Reminds me a manly drink hence the dry gin that's in it. Third, we tried Jump The Shark which came in a cute Shark decorative glass. It was a little sweet with a kick of tropics. Lastly, I had this new item drink with Hennessy, but a mix of Sparkling wine, it was my favorite! I thought the Henny would be too strong, but it balances out with all the other flavors. 

Now off to the main event, we started off the Charcuterie Board The FULL Monty, the seasonal pickles are mouthwatering. Then we had the Hamachi which was amazing and presentation was amazing. Next, we moved on to Chinatown Casino Clams and it was to die for! The Uni Hollandaise sauce from it was so good I had to dip it into my bread from the charcuterie board.  After, we tried the Oak Grilled Scallops which just melted in your mouth with the corn and miso butter melting together as you chew. Maitake Mushrooms with the hummus made a good impression then we had German Butterball Potatoes to add carbs to the table, the butter, garlic & lemon ash all went well well together, can be used as a side dish. Lastly, for dessert we decided to order the beignets topped with matcha green tea powder with a meringue cream inside. Sounded amazing, but it could of been more creamy and the matcha just added a bitterness taste at the end. 

Overall, it's a great place to try different types of modern Midwestern foods with a twist.",bydI3xl_ZpDZRbAQMAPITQ,0,0,4,ox2pLHVwAZ-h-tV-emAdPQ
5435926,2017-09-23,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Sparrow + Wolf is my pick for the best dining experience Chinatown has to offer right now.

The interior is well thought out. It's a very nice remodel from when Jenny Pho was in the same location. They kept the best aspects, like the open kitchen, and gave the interior a really nice facelift. It feels very clean. The staff are warm and friendly. Quick to refill drinks, take orders, clear plates...  and they always had a smile. They were all very welcoming and it felt like they genuinely cared about what they were doing.

The food is wonderful. Brian Howard, the executive chef, has done a really good job creating a rich tapestry of flavor. We tried the beef skewers, which had a great charcoal taste like it just came off the grill (because it DID!). It was paired with a crepe and sweet and sour garbanzo bean relish, and it was a really creative dish that we both loved. Next we tried the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and they were worth it! Again, very rich flavors. The marrow melted in our mouths. 

The only thing we ordered that was a bit disappointing was the hearth baked bread. It tasted a bit bland... maybe a little salt or rosemary, or a side-dish of balsamic vinegar or something else to dip it in would add a lot to the dish. Five dollars for warm bread, when a lot of places just give you bread for free, perhaps set the expectations higher than maybe they should have been. But I feel like I can make better bread at home, so it was a disappointing pick from the menu.

For desert, we tried the lemon and blueberry Calamansi tart. It was perfectly sweet and sour. I loved the way the meringue melted in my mouth. I wish I had more! 

The Sparrow has a few things we would change. For one, the music selection is confused. When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were greeted with a Notorious B.I.G. track that almost made me turn around. Next up was an old 60s anti-war tune, followed by some contemporary EDM, and then a bluesy track by Kai Straw called Hurricane. The playlist felt completely random, like each track is being decided by a roulette wheel rather than having actual thought behind creating a mood.

The other thing I would nitpick on... the spoons they gave us for the tart were huge. And when that's one of the only flaws you can find at a restaurant, well... that's pretty good. 

I definitely wish the Sparrow great success here in Vegas and I will surely be coming back to try the shank and the duck. 

An Honorable mention to the  general manager John. We got a change to meet John as we walked out the door and he overheard me commenting about the fire wood smell. He proceeded to show us around their kitchen and pointed out their amazing setup. I can't for the life of me remember the type of wood stove it was because I was so impressed by the GM's thoughtfulness.",HLY9oDcVBH9D25lU4X_V5Q,3,2,5,Tw4PPF7qYQ__IqwzbzkacA

And to think this was a shitty pho joint just a few months ago to a now beautiful, modern dining room executing some very creative food and drink (my first libation arrived in a large cup shaped like a shark) off the strip is awesome.  I was a big fan of Chef Brian Howard's Comme Ca (RIP...sniff, sniff) at Cosmopolitan, so my expectations were pretty high and everything we tried totally delivered.  

The ""Campfire Duck"" had me written all over it.  The duck breast, cooked a lovely medium rare with a delectable piece of foie gras on top, wood eared mushroom, salted cucumber, plum and rich duck bone broth was so ridiculously good that I plan on writing a letter to Santa for a box of this.  Do not share.  Think selfishly.  Be an asshole if you have to.  

I could handle being a vegetarian if I had their ""Artichoke"" every single day.  Featuring white bean hummus, charred tomatillo, mortared herbs, pine nuts and arugula, it was presented wonderfully and every bite was a great mix of char, light citrus, and earth.  Another big hit at the table was the ""Udon"" with its lamb bolognese topped with a sous vide egg.

If there was any downside at all, it was portion size.  Our party of 4 was still a bit hungry after 6 dishes and 2 desserts, which may just be our fault.  But if the duck is $21, why not just make it $30 for a larger sized plate?  I am positive that I'd shell out even more for a full breast (sounds dirty?) and feel confident I wouldn't be the only one.  If these plates were truly meant to be shared, 3 slices of meat to a serving just leads to a stare down for the last piece.  Who wants to get stabbed with a dinner knife on a hot date?  Not I!  So my advice would be to over order by a couple of dishes or perhaps start with some wine and their charcuterie board. 

That's all minor stuff in the grand scheme.  This place is outstanding and I look forward to repeat visits!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,136,119,5,MD-mnBwIiIBqrVYAUhv7Xg

I've been coming to Vegas since before the restaurant boom, and even with the celebrity chefs the food isn't as authentic as this.
Our table quite literally begged for more of their homemade sourdough-and sure that's not usually the food item that people write a yelp review about, but the fact that they make perfect bread from scratch is an indication of the care they take. 

Hanger steak was perfect. Fried trout was the best I've had since a beach restaurant in Mexico where they caught and filleted the fish on the spot. The dessert, zomg.

After a night out, you have endless amounts of options that will not disappoint. &  with the addition of Sparrow + Wolf they just took it up a notch. 

Easily & visibly located right on the end of the Macy's strip mall 'yells' Sparrow + Wolf that you can't miss it! As I walked in I was immediately greeted. There are views of an open kitchen just blocked by glass with all chefs busy away in the back. I decided to grab a seat at the bar, it's an area I enjoy more and more rather than being at a table. You are in the constant sight of cocktails being created and all the views of the amazing dishes being served. 

The energy was lively on a Wednesday night @ 8pm & gave the vibe of a restaurant that would be located in NYC, minus the small congested and overly loud places you may be use to. 

Im a basic gal and of course just stuck to the norm and ordered a glass of wine. BIG MISTAKE! Do yourself a favor and look at the cocktail page. There are a variety of choices & unique options they offer.

We left the menu in the chef's hands, and course after course, the creativity and flavors kept hitting the right spots.

We opted for the chef's choice tasting - if you don't see it on the menu, definitely ask! The dishes were a selection of current menu items, plus few unlisted courses. We ended up with 12 (generous) dishes for our party of 3. 

Some highlights: 

Charcuterie Plate - They make most of the charcuterie in-house, and it was noticeably better than your standard charcuterie. The pickled persimmon was also unexpected but amazing.

Caviar Bump - Yes, you read that right. This was literally a gigantic bump of caviar on my hand. Hilarious and amazing.

Maitake Mushrooms - Apparently I have a thing for food that looks like an autumn forest floor - I loved the woodsy presentation. The layers of sunchoke, chili, hummus, and mushroom created a pleasing variety of flavor and texture.

Spanish Octopus - I hesitate to say anything is the best, but this beat out my previous favorite (Evvia in Palo Alto) for the best octopus I've tried. The tenderness made me weak. 

American Wagyu, Duck Breast, Foie Gras -  All three of these ingredients I'm particular about. Wagyu is often overcooked or under seasoned. Duck breast is usually gamey and/or too chewy for me. And I'm not a fan of most foie - I've only truly loved the taste one other time. Sparrow + Wolf pulled off all three on the same plate, and I loved every freaking bite.

Chocolate Caramel Tart - The plating for the whole meal was awesome, but this was especially stand out. The chocolate was decadent and not too sweet, the vanilla ice cream lightened the dish, and the cocoa nibs added nice texture contrast. A perfect ending.

Wine pairings - The sommelier and FOH manager John picked a fun mix of whites and reds. I liked that he switched it up and paired a white for the meat course. The Locations CA White was my favorite - oaky like a typical California chard, but also uniquely crisp at the same time due to the blend of chardonnay, sauv blanc, viognier, and roussan. I've never had a white quite like it.

I came with a VIP regular, so the service was especially great. The staff was full of passion and everyone seemed like they truly enjoy working there. Chef Brian Howard came out a number of times to describe the dishes. We also had a new server, but she already seemed seasoned.

5630259,2017-08-23,3,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Four of us came here for a post-show dinner, having made reservations for 9:30pm.  When we walked in, it was pretty empty.  Sort of surprising for such a high rated place.  I think this just goes to show that LV is pretty saturated with good eats.  Definitely need more of this saturation our way so that not every mealtime need be a test of patience!

Our server was very nice and professional.  Drinks were good.  Brother-in-law even got one in a shark mug.  How whimsical!

We proceeded to order and started with the bento box which seemed like a great idea for the four of us. While some of the elements in the bento box were good, I don't think we were quite impressed with the presentation, especially when I think we paid $75 for it.  So I'm ok with skipping this one next time around.  Oyster toppings didn't really stand out to us and there was quite a bit of shell left in the shucked oyster.

Other things we ordered:
Hearth baked bread - Good bread
Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings - good but was salty; not sure I tasted marrow
Coal Roasted Beef Salad - lovely presentation, a little tough to eat with the huge tuft of pea shoots on top, tasty overall
Campire Duck - fantastic, must have
Halibut - came last; we were stuffed but couldn't help but gobble this one up. Perfectly cooked fish.

The only thing I didn't appreciate was that they basically threw all the food on our table in quick succession. With us still working on the bento box, the runners were trying to figure out ways to fit things on our table and I'd made a comment about slowing down the food and all they did was chuckle and scamper away. But the food kept coming.   

Sadly some dishes got cold while we were trying to eat everything so they're really doing a disservice to themselves when they throw everything out at once.  We finally got our server to slow it down on our last dish and of course he made sure to mention that they had to recook the halibut. Still very nice and pro, though.  Not sure if they just wanted us out so they can close or if the chef had no concept of letting his diners enjoy their food but it was pretty damn annoying.

The decor was decent but nothing overly wow about it. We ask for a 6:45 pm at 6:30 pm and had no issues at all so we were off to a great start. We ordered the popular items: clam casino, duck with foie Gras, and beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling. All 3 items would normally have me drooling for more but the description was way fancier than what we got. 

Clam casino - I didn't taste any Chinese sausage at all. And the uni was an after thought. It felt like it was placed on the clams just to get instagram pics. Don't get me wrong, I love uni! But the dish didn't need the uni at all. Although the clams were tasty, I thought the dish was trying too hard. 

Beef cheek & bone marrow dumplings - My Uber driver warned me that these dumplings were too salty and boy was he on point. Dumplings were salty and soggy. It didn't taste like beef cheek or bone marrow. If anything, they tasted like plain salted shredded beef dumplings that were left in a pile of foam. Nothing spectacular at all. 

Duck with foie Gras - Maybe the chef had an off night but my duck was extra chewy. And the foie Gras tasted a little burnt. Overall not impressed! 

To summarize, pricey lackluster food. People seem to come here for their cocktails too but we didn't get a chance to try. I doubt I'll return.",Omo53neF5AX04hx9ZbN1yw,1,0,3,22D1_Y6Hao-3EO8NQRiFgQ

The food are large plates meant for sharing. We ordered the campfire duck, big ass pork shank, udon, lemongrass chicken, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and Spanish octopus. Everything we ordered was delicious. My favorite plates were the campfire duck and udon. My only complaint was it took a very long time for some dishes to come out. The time we waiting between the second to last and last dish was like 30 minutes. By the time the last meal (lemongrass chicken, which is very good) most of my party was tired from waiting. Overall, I enjoyed my dinner here, I recommend it, and will be back.",4lWQjFGyGQZa61AfdcRr_Q,1,1,5,1wp4esJwfpIxSpKjoczUVw

As I walked in the restaurant I found the decor was very warm and comfortable.  The menu wasn't too big which I like. The tables were kind of close to each other I was fine with it but some may feel a little crowed. The advantage with tables so close is that I can easily check out what others are having.
Things I liked:
*Wasabi butter, celery root oyster which was very refreshing.
*Lobster wrapped in Kim Chi, if you like Kim chi you will need to try it and the foam was delicious.
*Foie Gras with corn meal and pickled carrot was excellent. Great contrast with all the parts of the dish.
*And I loved the Honey toast with mascarpone ice cream. The toast was nicely brûlée and the ice cream was smooth and creamy but not too sweet.
Things I didn't like:
*Oyster shiitake mushroom and lap cheong vinaigrette - I love shiitake and lap cheong but with oyster just didn't work for me. They overpowered the oyster.
*The dinner took over two hours. Not sure why. The next table came at least 30 minutes behind us but their dishes seemed to be arrived about the same time as mine. Our server was fine but she seemed to struggle to keep up with all her tables.
*Beef Kafta - actually everything of the dish were good except the beef. The beef just didn't have a lot of flavor.

Overall I really liked the restaurant and appreciated chef Brian's creativity and the way he brought many different ingredients and flavors around the world to create his dishes.
I look forward to go back to S&W.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,0,4,aWjaozYkJxnFQda4gtbtPA

The hostess was really nice and said they only had bar seating and that was fine, I thought of this place last minute....but as we sat at the bar she realized a table opened up and asked if we wanted it after they set it up...of course! We sat at the bar and waited and the bartender was uber friendly and mentioned to not feel locked down to the drinks on the menu that they loved making freestyle drinks...when our table opened up they joked that we left them haha. The waiter took awhile to get to our table but it was fine, took us much longer to decide on what we were drinking and the menu was interesting. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and I love that the Pinot they have is from Willamette...it's my favorite region for a Pinot and it was delicious. We asked him for recommendations on food and the choices all sounded even better! We love the story behind the casino clams and ordered that, bone marrow, bread, and the beef rib that he said was new on the menu. The bone marrow dumpling was so delicious...he said the bread would be good with it for the sauce...but the only bad thing about this place was that bread....it was so hard....you could break a tooth! The casino clam was the most flavorful thing I've ever had and I couldn't even describe it or compare it to anything except say it's amazing and a must order. The beef rib was good, but next time I'd probably eat 2 Casino clams instead. I decided to have dessert since I was on a winning streak. I tried the lemon soufflé cake, and it was very light and I love how it just finished the palate nicely. My boyfriend didn't like the noise level in here, he loves a quiet place...I had.

I erroneously had the impression that this was an Asian Fusion restaurant which is why I took so long to agree to our reservation.  I am so happy that I bended on my aversion for all things ""Fusion!""  I have never found a neighborhood cookery that takes such care of their cocktails, and innovations in food.  I love their clams casino, Udon, Spanish octopus, and even German Butterball potatoes (not the Peter Luger version, but really a wonderful complex of flavors).  You must try the bone marrow dumplings, and pork shank.  Finally the heirloom tomatoes with fresh watermelon makes your meal an event.  Lastly, unlike most meals the food is not heavy, and will leave you with a satisfying feeling late into the Las Vegas night so you can even hit the tables.  This is a concept that should branch out to America.  However, the dedication of staff is hard to duplicate.  I cannot wait until my next visit.  Does this qualify for All Madden status--No!

5716326,2017-05-19,8,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"An incredibly crafted American cuisine off the strip in Chinatown

I've been to this location several times in its former business and never has it been this beautiful, this delicious, or even occupied with this many people at one time.  The head chef Brian Howard, who I've read about in LV Weekly and Seven magazine, really has something special here - it's more than just a meal.

My experience began with a drink:

- ""Get off my Lawn"" ($14) - a Camus v Cognac served with a technique to initiate its full enjoyment. A flipped sniffer glass arrives sitting atop singed cedar wood to encapsulate a smoky aroma. Once turned right-side up, a house cooked bacon slice is place inside at the base, and before pouring your classy booze, a thinly sliced orange peel wraps around the inside and rim to secure that hint of citrus flavor. Sounds like work, but damn, smells so good and goes down so smooth.  ""I'll have another please!""

Ordering food is suggested to be done so from the left to right (cold to hot) of the menu, so the first round was this:

- Lamb tartare ($13) - gorgeous, light, fresh, and served with bhatura bread
- Farm Egg ($11.50) - this one actually surprised me. Asparagus (two-ways) never tasted so good to me. Really cleaned up this one.

Before the hot round, the Urban Seen Chopped Salad ($12) was ordered to freshen the palate and prep for the next course.  Simple yet several ingredients assembled for this bowl of lightly dressed leaves. I could never put together a salad like this. That's because Sparrow + Wolf works directly with a local source specifically to produce all their greens, and I'm glad they do, it was great.

And now to the main attraction:

Beef Skewers ($18) - deliciously cooked beef bites with chickpeas, served with a side of crepes.  Damn that's clever.
Campfire Duck ($21) - Three well-marinated duck strips along with a thick piece of foie gras made this dish my favorite of the night. Made me wanting more.

Since the closing of the former establishment, this neighborhood spot has kept me curious until it's grand opening yesterday.  Today, my visit and experience has satisfied the anticipation and only leaves me curious for more.  How are the other dishes and cocktails?  What will be on the next menu?  Will there be a happy hour??  I look forward to it all",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,31,23,5,22Z86ikZ123Pwbu1ywxv0Q
5740410,2018-01-09,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Sparrow + Wolf has been ranked among the best restaurants in Las Vegas, and after eating there I would say it is with good reason. 

I had two dishes, the uni melt and the lasagna. The melt was fantastic, a five star culinary treat. A few complementary flavors in the dish bolstered the experience. And at $12, it is actually reasonably priced.

The lasagna was quite good. Not quite the distinct experience of the uni melt but a very enjoyable entree, and quite filling--I had some the next day for lunch.

Despite being a trendy restaurant, the folks working there are not pretentious. Everyone with whom I interacted was friendly and down to earth. The bartender made some drinks that got rave reviews too, though I didn't have any of them.

Sparrow + Wolf is definitely a spot to check out.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,5,fbqY11lPyiCYgrV_k70flw

Upon walking in we were greeted by the hostess who was kind enough to let us choose where we sat.   This was the first in a long line of great things this restaurant provides.   

Our server was attentive without being pushy and very knowledgeable.   We ordered plates to share and he coursed them out for us perfectly.  Not only that but the timing was on point as well. 

He and the other service staff (and even the owner) made sure our plates cleared quickly and that we had fresh plates and silverware for each course.  The owner also made sure we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal.   This was very much appreciated and such a nice touch. 

Now to the food... everything we ordered was amazing!   The absolute highlight was the coal roasted beets.   You must get this!

5831199,2017-05-18,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"Congratulations to Chef Brian Howard and his entire crew. My group of 14 was very impressed. We've been looking forward to this opening night for a long time.

The service was incredible - this is a crew of professionals that were on their game - I suspect they did a few rehearsals because service was nearly flawless. I don't know the GM's name, but he was fast, accurate and a good host who treats you like your patronage is valued. Jason, our server, was a great guy - very witty, and very attentive. Jackie was handling our drink orders, and she was sharp and helpful as well. Even though the chefs were busy in the back turning out some wonderful food, Brian Howard took the time to come out and say hello to everyone.

The food was, well, Brian Howard. We loved every dish - and we tried almost everything on the menu. The Bento Box included 4 large prawns, a couple of huge crab claws, 6 oysters, a Full Monty (every meat available on the extensive charcuterie menu) - it was incredible. But so was everything! We all passed around our plates; we couldn't get over the tastes. Favorites were the Duck Confit with Foie Gras; Beef Skewers with the best crepe I've ever tasted; the Farm Egg; Charcuterie; Beet & Endive (the endive was smoky goodness) - I could go on and on.

The drinks were excellent. While we all enjoyed the unique cocktails or a glass of wine before and during dinner, there were some real surprises on the drink menu at the end that we enjoyed exposing our group to. The Pedro Jimenez sherry was a huge hit, followed by the Amaro Nonino (there were FIVE amaros on the menu). Chef Howard is way ahead of the game with his cocktail menu, tapping into the rising popularity of sherry and amaros among millenials, and popularizing Cognac again before the whiskey shortage hits.

The restaurant itself is very visually appealing as well as perfectly comfortable for enjoying a long and varied meal.

The artichoke was tasty, so was the bread. But $5 for one roll is highway robbery. In my opinion the meal went way down from there. The steak and frites were tasteless. My potstickers were so chewy I didn't eat them. We were very disappointed the halibut they had on the menu was not being offered, apparently their fish monger was providing bad halibut. It's summer, halibut is great this time of year   It was also very warm in the restaurant , the hostess advised their air conditioning was not working great. With all the new restaurants opening around town, we were so turned off by the entire dining experience. The management didn't try and make our dining experience any better. Two thumbs down.

5937196,2017-11-13,0,wkKlpSx3OcoGJiv7p8VZzw,"This review is NOT about the food it is in regards to my interraction with John Anthony,  the general manager (GM). I brought 9 of my guests, I'm a Vegas local,  with me with a specific desire to enjoy sweetbreads. This was my first visit and had heard they served them. Upon arrival our group was informed that they were not available. I informed the server that that was the primary motivation of our visit and asked her to speak with the chef to see if any none menu options in the offal department were available. Instead of hearing back from her the GM came to our table. He recounted that sweetbreads weren't available and asked how he could help. I asked my earlier question and asked if there were any none menu options, as I found it unsatisfactory. He said,  ""No."" I was looking for customer service and was told,  ""I don't know of any restaurant that offers anything other than the menu.""  Then he suggested that we just leave, ,he didn't care.""  I told him I had no more questions and he kept going on and on about why he didn't have sweetbreads. I asked him to step away from the table, he ignored that request and illucidated each facet of the menu over a nearly 10 minute period. Essentially he likes his definition of customer service and boiler plate approach. I have had many experiences where off-menu preparations have been proffered at much less,  and more, expensive establishments. A simple,  ""I spoke with the chef and would love to accommodate but we don't really have any options other than the menu. Our sweetbreads are great and we hope you'll come back,  in fact a serving will be on me if you choose to return and hope you enjoy the other item tonight.
