It's been years & I've never spoke my mind but now it needs to be on file. Both are RUDE & make the experience uncomfortable. When I walk in....if either of them are working WE walk out.

Not too loud. Easy-going regular crowd that is usually happy to include you in the conversation.

Just a really good hang. A Vegas version of ""Cheers"". 

The only downers? Smoke. ...and because of the smoking, nobody under 18 allowed. 
It's never been horrible when I've been there. When I first moved to Vegas, this would have been considered one of the **less** smokey restaurants. But now that I'm used to smoke-free dining, it's hard to go back. 

Still; I'll go back. It's worth it.

1573512,2015-09-06,0,HfxMovSXJZVqL514iUD02g,"It's been a few years of me warming my regular stool so I'll go ahead and update my review.

Food is still great, normally John Taffert or any bar consultant would suggest a small menu to limit choices for food to maximize profit. The menu has many choices (not Chocolate Factory huge but larger than PT's) healthy and not so. They do it right, good if it's hummus or a greasy sandwich. All of the waitresses are attentive, cute and friendly.
- Every Tuesday is taco Tuesday. Cheap and good tacos.

Beers: the regulars are still here (Bud, Coors, Sam) plus Goose Island Matilda, New Belgium Fat Tire, Sierra Nevada and they have newly on tap a Ninkasi Tricerahops. Don't ask Jen to pronounce it haha. I would say they rotate/add to the taps about once every three years :P. Don't ask questions, just come thirsty. There's a full bar so if you're a Whiskey, JÃ¤ger or Fireball person you're good here too.
- There is no happy hour. Drinks are cheap, don't complain.

Machines are good too. People are constantly winning. Video poker and keno are popular here. There's card of the day free play and monthly drawings with tickets for keno wins over $100. There's a monthly party for winners of both with a theme, free food and a free video poker tourney too. The party fills up fast.

This is a sports bar. Baseball and ESPECIALLY football are big here. When it's out of season, in the afternoon tennis and golf are covered (ESPN). College games are shown. If there's a game you want to watch just let your fantastic beertender know and they'll switch it. I've even watched Criminal Minds and Shark Tank at the bar, so if there's a review that says they won't change the TV it's a lie or time of an extremely big game.

There is good drink & food specials when it's football season. There's even regulars from people out of state who come every year just to watch football games here. They give out team jerseys for some big games if Johns working. If it's Super Bowl and you gamble, show up hours early for a machine. It gets PACKED.

Music: 99% of the time it is blues and classic rock.
Ingrid: Works most afternoons, is pretty lenient with music, it's either blues/classic rock, a mix of top 20 (usually a lot of Bruno Mars - Uptown Funk), which rolls into Jens shift at 5:00pm. Ingrid's good with whatever the majority of the crowd is feeling (If it's blues and Ingrid's in, chances are there is a few regulars playing the machines).
Jennifer: Works after Ingrid most days at 5:00pm, so top 40, turns into Motown, classic rock/blues but usually country. If I'm here through both Ingrid & Jens shift I might slide in some Ray Charles & A Tribe Called Quest with the Motown. If it's on.
John: When John works, no one touches the jukebox. It might as well not exist. Blues all day. He's not a juke nazi, it's just that EVERY regular gamer comes in for his shift. I'd be lying if I did not tell you every regular gamer or not, loves John. It took me three years and lots of nudging from my mother to stick money in a machine and gamble. I was a regular, earned half of my check ins watching football and drinking here. I love all the ladies here, Johns just got a great smile and attitude.
If it's dead and his graveyard shift, he might make an exception but it's rare (for me only haha just kidding)
Angie: Great smile too. Blues or top 40.
There's another bartender, Tim that mostly works grave, I hear he favors reggae but I haven't been on his shift in a very long time.

My favorite bartenders are John, Ingrid, Jen & Angie. They will always take care of you. 

I love this place. I've been here probably 7 times as as many check ins I have at least. 

In review, it's a dark, smokey, blues sports bar with good service. The crowd is 99% industry. If that's up your alley, you'll fit right in.",Kez5MabViniF-HUZ166HFw,2,0,5,NWtv4jFhCn3VcltLKbEOAA

The atmosphere is pretty inviting and upbeat, there wasn't anything notable about the decor or interior, it just felt like a comfortable bar to hang out at. 

I looked at their menu and was actually pleased to see the wide selection of items at very reasonable prices....and by reasonable i'm not talking about the inflated Vegas bar price but rather a truly reasonable price (and they serve breakfast all day as well)

I opted for the ""Jumbo"" Wings and boy they weren't kidding! It was a heaping pile of large wings and fries....and pretty darn good too.

I only have one small grouse-  I wished the drink service was a bit faster, i felt i had to flag the bartender down for a refill.

Starting with the food. A step above ordinary bar food. Full menu from regular appetizers to full entrees, with daily specials sure to satisfy any taste. Quality is outstanding and price is very reasonable. 
A sports bar setting, but not dedicated to one team or town. Over 16 tv's so if there is something you want to see, just ask the bartender. 
Not a big gambler, but slots are fair and payouts are good. 
So what makes this place five stars:
Service!!!
Quite a few regulars but first timers are greeted immediately and soon enough you'll feel part of the family. Special acknowledgement to John (manager/bartender). He will make you feel at home and treat you like family.

The steak had a little gristle but heck, for the money, who cares, it was SO tasty!   Our margaritas were not so good unfortunately, tasted like a bottled mix was used, a little too watery.

The bar itself is pretty standard for Las Vegas bars that target locals. Lots of tvs for watching sports, video gaming for the gamblers, and comfortable booths for groups that want to eat away from the bar. The bartenders pour strong, even the first drink, and that is always a plus. 

The burgers are big and juicy, and you can get them with sweet potato fries! I love that they have sweet potato fries as an option for the side at no extra cost. Salads are nice and large, and the club sandwich was good enough that I'd order it again. 

Good bar food at good prices. 3.5 stars is what I would rate them if I could, but since I can't do half stars, I will round up.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,4,3,4,9BSkQJwMH6yjzW8EhJILcA

We tried the deep fried asparagus spears and it does prove that deep frying really does make it better. 

My top pick because I've had it 3x is the Ortega Burger with cheese. 

We went for Happy Hour the 1st time and for $30.00 got 4 Bloody Marys, big platter of wings & the pretzel bites (a bit doughy but soaked up the booze in the Bloody)

First, i love the ambiance. Its a feel good sports bar and MNF is the best. Ive never been to  a bar that does it up like that for MNF. I went when it was the49ers playing and my bf is a huge fan (me.. Im a cowboys fan myself) but they give out a ticket for every beer that you order. ($1.50 budlights if I remember correctly) and at every quarter they call a number and if you're there you win a prize. I happen to have won!! I never win anything but I wont a 49er T-shirt that I gave to my bf who was in love. 
They had $1 pizza, 2 hot dogs for a buck, wings, you name it , fish tacos. all kinds of $.50 and $1 goodies and waiters bringing it out to you and catering to you like you ordered a $15 plate. I loved the friendly people. and the blond girl waitress who is a huge Giant fan, I dont give her such a hard time about being a G-men fan b/c she's so gosh darn nice. Never been in the place without her working so I wonder if she has a cot in the back that she sleeps on. 

The cobb salad is to die for, the buffalo chicken wrap is soo delicious. . the ruben was good - Looked even better that it tasted but I shared it w/ my love but most times we split something b/c the portions are big so you can share and most times they will serve it on 2 separate plates which is super nice. I love this place and if you havent stopped in- try it. Its close to the Orleans - about a block over - Its my fave place to watch football on the west side of town.",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,4,1,5,L4HWZJAr_w5PMdueO8OdOA

5004905,2014-08-02,6,HfxMovSXJZVqL514iUD02g,"I was at the O'Aces Bar & Grill this morning at 4am. I have been there several times before this but it was never this bad. The experience I had there was SO BAD that I can honestly say it was the worst time that I had EVER in any bars... especially here in Vegas.

I had a choice of either going to a casino or a bar. Me, my husband and my friend opted to go to the bar, (in this case O'Aces), since the several times that we had been there, a bartender named Tim comped us our drinks and the food was decent.

I don't drink alcohol so I only went there for a small bite to eat and couple sodas and to buy drinks for my hubs and friend.

The problem begins when I asked John (the late night bartender/manager???) how much we owe them. He rang us out and said that the bar portion was $22.50.
That is for 4 beers and two shots of sambuca. As far as any bar's are concerned, it's really not that badly priced. The food portion of the bill was $26.

I asked him if I am getting ANY drinks comped. Since between me, my hubs and friend spent $180 on their video poker machines. 

John then said that well ""obviously"" I got comped my SODAS, and although we all fed money in their machines, my hubs and friend played 1 coin... (which is not entirely true since 1 coin was played only when the machine was giving out bad hands. Otherwise they played $1 - $2 per hand)

Regardless, I was playing $1.25 in the beginning, then fed more money to play $5 per hand.

I told him that I am paying for the bar tab and I'm not a 1 coin player. John then told me that it doesn't matter if I played $100 OR if I'm the one that is buying all the drinks. He can't comp out my hubs and friend, since THEY were a 1 coin player (once again not entirely true).

Anyway, John then with a holier than thou attitude (oh btw, did I mention that this guy not only has a cocky attitude, he also seems VERY egotistical and seems borderline narcissistic, and TOTALLY passive aggressive) tells me he's comping 1 beer. SERIOUSLY? 1 beer? oh and not to forget my 3 diet cokes... what a joke. It would've been ok, if he did this without acting like I should be thankful. That he's a gracious giver. Once again, after spending a total of $200 on their machines, this level of customer service is a TOTAL JOKE.

At any rate, we paid for the bar tab... and my hubs even gave him a tip. At this point, I would'nt have given this guy ANYTHING. And here's what really ticked me off. After he received $4 in tip... (more than 20%), he then with an attitude threw it in the tip bucket. Like literally threw it in there. I was totally disgusted.

Are you kidding me? I could've gone to The Orleans, right around the corner, played the same amount or even less and gotten more than 4 beers and 2 shots comped. Our pretty cocktail waitresses would've gotten $80+ on tips from us, we would have all had a great night.

FYI, I managed a bar in NY for 3 years. None of my bartenders would've treated any patrons this way.

The point is, if you're looking for fun in Las Vegas, your best bet is to avoid this place like a plague. Trust me. Just like someone else said on YELP, this bar is dark and musty.

Food - $$ and mediocre at best 
Customer Service - what customer service?

We came here at some ungodly hour after a long night of drinking. Happy Hour is 50% off all appetizers! I came with 4 of my other girlfriends and we feasted on about 6 different plates. The appetizers here are huge! They certainly aren't stingy. 

The holy grail items are the fried asparagus and garlic knots. 

Our waitress was a sweetheart and made absolutely sure our drinks weren't dry. She delivered more napkins when we needed them and definitely earned her tip. Most of the people at our table work in hospitality or some other customer-service related industry; so we know good service when we get it. After 6 appetizers, a few drinks, and a hefty tip.... the split was only like $10 bucks a head.
