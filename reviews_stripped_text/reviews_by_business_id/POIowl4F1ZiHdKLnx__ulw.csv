Because this is a chain fast-food restaurant, I know what to expect when going to Chipotle. This location was no different. Friendly staff, clean environment, average pricing. Oh yeah, and good food! The employees here also hook it up with big portions, which is awesome!

Everyone's experience is going to be different, but I personally enjoyed mine. And if you don't like it here, well you're in luck because there will always be another Chipotle close by.",awGQrgC8d6_6P8Kc-YeiJQ,1,1,4,PRj0WCxMA6-C_2UV5YOFQg

995175,2016-08-05,0,POIowl4F1ZiHdKLnx__ulw,"I have frequented several Chipotle's across the West Coast and I have to say, this location is extremely well run.  I am already a fan of the locally sourced, fresh ingredients that Chipotle is so well known for and everyone knows it's delicious, healthy food.  But every time I come in this location, no matter how busy, the meats are fresh off the grill and the servers are working together like clockwork.  

In my experience, when all of the servers are courteous and friendly it's a reflection of the manager.  Connecting with customers can be really difficult, especially when it gets super busy, so I give credit to the manager Brenda Murillo (I got her name from a business card in front of the register.) The store is always super clean and I have never had anything but 5 star experiences in the several times I have been there.",ooGJc6Nbq57Ku7OQ7EXPOA,0,0,5,RX1-9JIdvidEuhNVSbxVxQ

The chairs were covered in tomatoes, sauce, and worst off some dirty person from before had dog hair all over them and left it all over the seats! How gross. There were no workers on the floor cleaning the dirty tables so my friends and I had to clean it up by ourselves which means all the food and crap went onto the ground.
It just seems this place has no pride or ownership and especially during the busy lunch hour from 12-3.
Also as we stare at the glad to look outside because we want to enjoy the sun since we don't get to at work, the glass is also filthy. Covered in scratch marks and finger prints! There is no way that since the last shift that all that dirtiness can come that quickly. My friends and I know that they are just lazy here.

They also need to work a bit on their food consistency. The fajitas and chicken were blackened (aka burnt). Maybe that's more of a local taste thing. I'm not sure. 

Employees were friendly though and it's a clean location. Food tasted fine overall. Just not as good at the local Chipotle I go to back in California. 

It's a convenient distance from my parent's place out in Vegas though. I'll be giving this place a few more tries before giving up.",CwZ8pPU9sYuQM6gUF1L5Pg,2,1,3,wwb0rtmAmIXMOQ4F92enOw

It also doesn't help that Blaze Pizza is right next door.  I've been to this location just a handful of times.  It's been dead every single time.  Ordering is easy and the service is always great.  My go-to meal is their Chicken 3-Pointer (2 or 3 scoops of chicken & cheese).  The food is just okay.  If I'm at Chipotle it's only because I'm trying to get my protein up.

4845796,2016-01-09,0,POIowl4F1ZiHdKLnx__ulw,"This place just opened and they already have low reviews... I'm sure it's due to the lack of customer service. 

I placed an order and paid online. When I got there the cashier (who was very friendly) told me she would have to charge me for the extra guacamole I ordered on the side... I told her it was no problem. 

Here is where the problem starts... When I got home, my order was completely messed up... They charged me extra guacamole but they never even added guacamole to my meal.... I asked for the chili-corn salsa and instead they put some spicy green salsa on there. 

I called chipotle and after I told the person on the phone the issue they said ""ok hold on"" and placed me on hold and put the manager on the line.

When the manager got on the line, he said ""what happened"" not ""thank you for holding"" or anything. When I explained the issue and told him I was just there 10 minutes ago, the manager said ""well did you eat it? If you didn't bring it back and we'll exchange it."" I told him before he even said that, that I didn't have time to go back, so when I reminded him that I didn't have time to go back, he said ""well bring it tomorrow"" I told him I wouldn't be able to go back anytime soon and I would be able to go next week. And he told me to just put it aside and bring it in next week. 

Never once did this ""manager"" apologize for the inconvenience, or the error or anything. 

It wasn't until after I became upset and told the manager that it's not fair that in order to provide good customer service they have to inconvenience their customers even more. The manager was so rude and was almost yelling at me at this point and said to just bring in the receipt whenever I go back and they would comp a meal. He took down my name as well. I'm sure if I do go back they won't know what I'm talking about and charge me full price. 

I don't understand why some people refuse to provide good customer service until you become upset and rude. Never once did anyone apologize for their error they were just offended that I had the ""nerve"" to call in to complain. 

I do like how they charge me for guacamole and then charge me for extra guacamole and didn't give me any. Nice.",ma4ae7Pv12uRp3jOEbWGzw,2,0,1,DNaW9pZghiEVGLd9VeJVPw

I asked for a steak burrito and apparently it's the hardest job in the world to make more steak that takes 10 min to make. A depressing caucasian employee probably 25 years old making $8.25 an hour that had green gauges in his ears and tattoos on his arms made the biggest outbreak because he felt ""obligated"" to make more steak. He started slamming the steak container in the table, throwing the lid that had raw steak to the side, then slamming the steak on the grill... all very aggressive and annoyed! He even started talking about how he felt to the girl who was taking my order! And then she had attitude with me! I felt it was for one, highly disrespectful, and secondly surprised by their childish behavior being that they represent the famous and popular franchise Chipotle. I've never had an issue at other Chipotle locations. If I had known it would have been an issue, they should have told me and I would have gladly walked out and left without a problem. I would have reported todays concern to a manager but seeing that most of the employees facial expressions, they look miserable working there. I figured the manager was one of those employees that also looked miserable so why waste my breath? Word of advise to those who were working that night...mainly the caucasian with green gauges. If the job isn't paying you enough to keep you happy. Get a better job. And to Chipotle...fire that guy...he sucks for your company.
