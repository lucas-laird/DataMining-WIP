The lady taking our order was so rude from the tone of her voice to the look on her face. If you don't like working here then leave. This is how you chase away your customers. So stuck up! I didn't have a attitude until I realized she did. Didn't even know her name bc she didn't have a name tag on. A girl with a full face of MU is as much I can describe her as ?,7CHAwlWdii23g_QIG2LbJA,1,0,2,6g9cPxfitGWjIPNCd0Hy8A

Wings where over cooked and fries where under cooked. No garbage cans you leave it on the table.,mf4kLzetv1Huf3hDKBwyrg,0,0,2,nOI9s4_QWmpPtXt2_7WksA
