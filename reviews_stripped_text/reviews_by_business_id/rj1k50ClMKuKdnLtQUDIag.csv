963748,2015-07-23,2,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"This place is open, previously it was reported as being closed. Given the experience at this restaurant, they should really close. The employees were rude. And given that it has a Japanese name for a restaurant, they actually serve mediocre Chinese food. The only Japanese dish about this place is the udon, sushi, and tempura.",OR0e3jDmrnQ-IQFCKi06Yg,1,1,1,ZvlqSqaFQvWKRLkDbu8IYQ

I went around 5:30pm on a Monday and they were busy so I thought that was a good sign. Boy was I wrong! I took a couple bites and threw the rest away. That's how bad it was. Another review mentioned that it seems like they are serving leftovers. This is exactly how it tastes! 

Sadly, I haven't found any good places in this food court. Luckily, there are many restaurants in the mall.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,1,0,1,NuNEovHz6UhN3ppHurSPCw

If you need to grab a quick bite to eat then I guess it's a convenient option. Definitely have had better though.",FyrYa3fL4agc5kZiW_3WFQ,1,1,2,oeTqx5o5CuVJwt5uOQ79lg
1832838,2010-06-26,1,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"Ichiban is a fast food spot located within the Fashion Mall across from the Wynn.  The UFO shaped mall has a large food court with lots to choose from, but Ichiban is probably one of your best bets.  Ichiban is a Chinese fast food restaurant that serves quality and tasty food at a reasonable price.

Whenever I'm visiting Vegas, I make a point to stop by at Ichiban and get a plate of their delicious teriyaki chicken and vegetable fried rice.  The teriyaki chicken bursts with flavor as its drenched with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken itself is tender, tasty, and nicely grilled and goes great with their fried rice.  In addition, the Mongolian beef is also worth trying and has a bit of spice to tingle the taste buds.

The food portions are large and more than enough to fill you up.  The cost of two entrees and fried rice is about $6 and after you add a drink, your total comes to about $8 and some change.  I highly suggest trying Ichiban; you'll love the teriyaki chicken.",BdV-cf3LScmb8kZ7iiBcMA,2,0,4,6OioG0qYZjD_xkVsayOf9w
1864184,2013-08-05,0,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"It was lunch time so we decided to eat at the food court. I ordered the bento meal which had sesame chicken, teriyaki chicken and fried rice. When I took a bite of the chicken sides, they were cold and it seems like they are serving leftovers. Both of the chicken were tasteless and bland. The fried rice had no flavor.  You're best of eating Panda Express than this place. I'll never go and eat here again.",WQlpSN8aH3TkwE3arsEL6g,1,0,1,2wvSV6kP-JRqfrZD81Jlow
2772062,2011-04-06,0,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,Nice lunch spot in the Fashion Show Mall that is close to where I work. Everytime I have eaten here the food is always fresh.The sesame chicken and the teriyaki are very good and I like their rice. I judge Asian places on how well they can make rice. I know this is weird but I can't stand rice that isn't soft and fluffy. If I can't pick it up with chopsticks it is a no go for me. It seems recently they have been offering a small sushi selection. I ordered some inarizushi and was surprised when the clerk told me it would be about 5 minutes. Not only did they make it right then but they made it the way I like it. Inari needs sesame seeds and they did it right!,zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,1,0,3,jhGF8BPCw0UgUGmpL3E6Qw
3409877,2014-08-24,0,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,Tastes like straight up garbage. Don't do it. They should be out of business. The udon and chow mein tastes really funky.,ovuXWKwb8vPGHi3xhaI9Zw,2,0,1,zLVRsjBY9uMPqasTFZjPSg
3410462,2012-12-03,3,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"YUM!

Don't go to the Panda Express. It kinda sucks. If you are making a decision between the two ""Asian Influenced"" food court places at Fashion Show Mall, this one is most definitely the better of the two.

They not only have better tasting food, but I happen to think the quality is great too. They also have more unique and interesting choices here as opposed to Panda Express like tofu, seaweed salad, tempura shrimp and sushi.

Always friendly service, and quick as well.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,3,4,4,7kL47_pJd2drK-je9NHYwA
4922640,2012-11-01,0,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,Noodles were disgusting. Like spiced top ramen. They ruined everything. Anything they touched. Teriyaki chicken was nothing special. Sesame chicken had a bone in it. Drinks are way overpriced. Egg drop soup alright. There's a reason there's no line for this establishment.,a0UcfaWHo_Rjl87G5coUvg,1,0,1,5SZoCiP7sVfgWnjxn6XSrQ
5053957,2014-03-22,3,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"I'm sorry to say that Ichiban is really not a good place to eat. Actually, the whole food court in the mall could be way better on a deeper level! If you're planning to eat here, or really intent on eating here...I would say that their best out of all dishes would be the chicken teriyaki. 

On my plate, I had the chicken, noodles, and shrimp tempura. All of it was painstakingly dry and not very well seasoned. None of it was really that warm either. I'm probably not ever going to eat here again. On the plus side, the people working here were very polite and nice! 

The food court is one of the worst places to eat in the entire Fashion Show Mall. FSM, please reinvent your FC, because the place is just too big to be -that- bad.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,2,3,2,o_h4g8ustFHgZxpJk0UGyQ
5199009,2012-03-22,1,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"Ichiban is not the mall version of a  live action hibachi spot that I hoped for; it is more of a grassroots Panda Express. It is a quick bite at a reasonable price when you're on a shopping mission. I opted for vegetables instead of noodles or rice, and for my two entrees teriyaki chicken and eggplant. The vegetables had an off-putting flavor. I would not make that call again. As with this type of spot, the eggplant dish was heavy on the sauce, but had a nice flavor, and the chicken was flavorful and tender. So, of my three dishes one was not good, one was aok and one was solid. You may have better results elsewhere.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,1,2,v6mmqime1-iwZDZQMHI1Og
5353522,2011-12-06,0,rj1k50ClMKuKdnLtQUDIag,"I work in the mall, so it is hard to find a good, affordable place to eat. Ichiban offers a plate with fried rice and two sides for $5.89 + mall discount which is unbeatable. Not only do they have good prices but their food is flavorful and generously portioned. Try the chicken curry....it is some of the best.

Enjoy!",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,0,0,4,AQQEaa4O1NYp2rBUHOkGaQ

Also had an excellent miso soup and mango Mochi ice cream. All were incredibly tasty and delicious. I wish I wouldve ordered their tuna sashimi. Buttery, fresh and delicious. Well worth it, considering their location at the basement of the Bally's.",e4V7QgrETxaD-1LzYLoxFQ,0,0,5,R8Fs3lHjx19PV1IpqS1BMw
