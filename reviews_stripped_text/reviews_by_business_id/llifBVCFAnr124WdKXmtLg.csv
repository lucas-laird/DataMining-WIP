I arrived just minutes after they opened on a Saturday, I was very hungry, I was seated quickly and ordered a variety of options including hummus, falafel and chicken swharma, grape leaves and so on. It arrived quickly and was obviously freshly made. That cured my hunger, and the waitress, (from Michigan) was very helpful and friendly.

90206,2014-12-28,1,llifBVCFAnr124WdKXmtLg,"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday as we were trying to utilize one of the last Entertainment book coupons we had for 2014 (yes, it's ok to be thrifty). We both tried a lunch plate-the chicken kabob and the lamb one (9.95 & 10.95 respectively for the lunch price). The waitress was nice although with only 1 other table there, we waited quite a while for water. If you've eaten Mediterranean food before, you know that kabob plates come with rice, vegetables or cucumber salad and, obviously, a kabob. NOT SO at Ali Baba. We both recd a small plate with plain (AND I MEAN PLAIN) basamati rice (no spices at all) with a few slivers of onion and a half a tomato off to the side. The 4 pieces of chicken were so dry, I was washing it down with water after every bite because it was getting stuck in my throat (the whole meal...super dry). It wast most obviously a leftover from the night before even though we were there at about 12:30pm. The lamb wasn't as dry but, no taste...at all (again...no spices). I was super disappointed....all I could think was-at least we're not paying full price for this 'food'. As I've mentioned, there was another table and (because I like to eavesdrop), I overheard them ask for a side of yogurt and heard the waitress say 'yes, I'll bring you a little bowl"" and even made the gesture with her hand as to how big the bowl was so the guy knew how much he was getting. Thinking that the yogurt could make this less than stellar meal a little less dry, my husband asked for some only to be advised that the only yogurt they had was included with an app on the menu. I'm a great eavesdropper, the other guy DID NOT order the app. The only thing I could think was 'that's what we get for using a coupon'. We paid and left.....and will never return. Not because of the waitress....because food drives me-and this was not worth the half price we paid.

We love Mediterranean food so, if you're so inclined to love it too...do yourself a favor and drive a mile or so more South on Eastern and end up at Yalla's - you won't be disappointed!",Y1cEsHLj4yb9WBe0L-Iv5A,2,0,1,KuoayUCiqZmxBWOzEDtCQA

VISITORS ... RESIDENTS ... ALL of you PEOPLE ... BEEEE AWARE OF THIS ONE ... THEY WILL TRY TO CHARGE U TWICE FOR TIPS!!! What kind of people do that really!!!

I went to this one because one of the nearby restaurants (Middle Eastern) was also closed for renovation.

Let me begin my review with this: 

1. They charge you automatically 18% a gratitude tip of the overall amount! It is CLEARLY written in the bill as 18% Gratuity (mine was around 7 dollars). 

2. Then the server will bring you another bill to sign with BIG BLANK SPACE With the WORD TIP!!!! AND NOTE: the 18% are already included and they simply want you to add more!! BUT without your attention!!

Whhhhat ... This is the first time everrrrrrrrrrrr in my life I find someone with the courage the do such stupid cheating!!! Do you want me to tip you again!! Do you think people are really stupid not to notice that!!!

I'm a person who tip generously ... I like to tip even when the server is not that good because we all face hard days so don't expect a perfect service each single time you sit in a restaurant. Waitress and servers are human and face greater pressure than us who just came to enjoy a meal and leave. But what happened in this cuisine is really unprecedented! To have the courage to decide the amount of tip I wanna put is mean and malicious, but to send me another bill with tip space (with the total amount already including 18% tip) is PURE THEFT!


To the owner: 

1) I hate when you decide in behalf of me how much I should tip your employees. The server was good (may be because the restaurant was really empty), but still this don't give you the right to decide for me!!

2) Your shish taooq is really not tasty! $17 for a small plate of kebob is really OVERPRICED ... I'm a Middle Eastern who live in LA, California and even in fancy places which are located in the most expensive locations like West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, SFV (not in the border of Las Vegas like yours) don't charge $17 for a small  Middle Eastern Plate! I know how much it cost to prepare a high quality plate (I'm into the food business), and yours are totally and ridiculously overpriced. You will have (2 to 4) dollars revenue in a $10 plate (the average cost for a kebab plate made with good and fresh ingredient, not to mention it  includes labor cost and rent as well!). Yours, based on my experience, cost less than 6 (100% sure providing I don't know how much is the rent in the border lines of Las Vegas): Thus, it is completely ridicules to ask for $17 to your plate ...

3) I'm seriously disguised by your trick! I dare you to replay with reasonable answer to this incident without the words: I'm sorry, it was a mistake!!

More expensive than I prefer, but clearly labeled $$, the decor is fairly plush, authentic, very comfortable, a place one could linger with friends for hours. And the existence of hookah means that's more likely. 

I got the appetizer for two, which is a spendy $35. But it was full of excellent, varied, well prepared and delicious choices. Babaganouj. Dolmas. Hommos. Tabouli salad. Yogurt dip. Spinach pies. Cheese pies. Fresh bread. And those Falafel! 

After filling up, I took more than 1/2 home in ToGo containers (which they prepared for me in the back) to my son waiting at home. We'll enjoy this double appetizer for the next couple days, until mommy and the boys get home.

The food was so great. When my family goes out for middle eastern food we always order family style. It's the ONLY way you should order when eating middle eastern food. Get one of everything that looks good and go in a big group. We had the hummus, baba ghanoush, kibbeh, grape leaves, falafel, tabbouleh, knafe, kebabs and a lot of other stuff. All of it was amazing. The kibbeh was moist and the meat had amazing flavor. The baba ghanoush was awesome, and it's really hard to find a super well done baba ghanoush. 

The grape leaves were also fantastic. Now, people who have tried grape leaves before, most likely you have tried Greek dolmas. These are not those. These are the middle eastern grape leaves. They are hot and come with meat and rice in them. They are, in my opinion, much better. But be warned, they might now be what you expect. 

I could go on in detail about how awesome everything we had was, but I'm going to skip to the knafe. 

It is SUPER hard to find good knafe. Theirs was great! First of all, they make it with shredded filo dough, sometimes they are made with a more grainy pancake like dough. But the shredded filo is the way to go always with knafe. The cheese was gooey and warm and the rose water syrup was outstanding. Very sweet, so ease up on how much you dump on top of yours.

There was also live Arabic music and it was really good! If you're brave, there is a dance floor. I had not had enough to drink tonight. Maybe next time...

And can I just rave about the service for a second? They were so accommodating and friendly. It was like someone was having you over for dinner in their home. They were hospitable and kind. The food came out very quickly and our server was very good at explaining and answering any questions we had. When we paid our bill and were leaving, he walked us out and said goodbye. It was truly and wonderful experience.

There are some foods in this world that make me wonder, how did I ever grow up without this?? Lebanese food is one these! 

My friend Nicole and I were going out for lunch the other day and decided to try Ali Baba, a Lebanese restaurant. Upon arrival the waitress was outside and greeted us with a friendly hello. As we entered the restaurant I couldn't help but take in all the decor...the Tiffany inspired chandlers, the paintings on the wall (which turned out to be wall paper), the pillars, the long tables, and the dance floor with a stage that was set up to play bands. There was only one group of dinners in the restaurant and there wasn't any music playing, which was a little unsettling. But we decided to go forth and see what the experience could bring us!

The menu was quit detailed, so if it was your first time eating Lebanese food, you'd know what you would be getting into. It all looked so good to me! We ended up ordering some hummus, tabbouleh, a shawarma sandwich and a chicken taouk sandwich. We decided that we would share everything! The hummus was so tasty, just like it should be. So creamy and smooth with a buttery taste. The tabbouleh was amazing with the finely minced parsley, diced tomatoes, onions, cracked wheat, mint, extra virgin olive oil, and lemon juice! Very yummy...I could eat it every day! The shawarma sandwich was good. This sandwich is usually marinated in yogurt and spices over night, although, I'm not sure what this places uses as the marinade. It did come with tahini sauce, garlic, lemon juice, seasoned onions, sliced tomato and pickles. The chicken taouk sandwich wasn't as good but I think that's because of the garlic sauce they put in it. If you dare to eat this sandwich, make sure you don't have to be up-close and personal with someone! The chicken was char-grilled served with garlic sauce, tomatoes and pickles. Both sandwiches came with french fries, which I thought was a little odd. I would have preferred a small side of hummus or babganoush instead.

Over all, we stuffed ourselves and had leftovers! I will go back when the craving for hummus is calling! But I would wait till later in the day for when the band and belly dancers show up!  I can't wait to see them perform in person!

2348219,2014-02-14,0,llifBVCFAnr124WdKXmtLg,"Went here last night with my wife and another couple.  We were absolutely the only people inside the restaurant, while what looked like the owner/manager and two friends were smoking hookah outside.  
    After waiting about 3-4 minutes we were greeted at the table as we had come a few minutes behind our friends who had already ordered drinks.  The owner/manager I mentioned earlier was our waiter because he didn't seem to be wearing any kind of serving uniform.  
     After we ordered our food about 10 minutes went by at which point a man who was clearly the cook (wearing apron) came up to us, hurriedly, to take our order.  We told him we had already ordered, and he asked who took the order and we pointed to the manager coming through the door with ingredients bought at a nearby market.  He ran up to him then they both ran back to the kitchen together. OK so they ran out of ingredients, and clearly the cook had no idea anyone was inside the restaurant or had ordered for those first 10 minutes.  
     About 20 minutes later we got our food, which was OK, definitely not anything great.  The chicken shawarma looked like it had been thrown together rather quickly and not really fully cooked (probably because they were trying to rush after having to go to the market to get ingredients).  
     I had a beer but my wife had ordered a Mojito.  BIG mistake... it was absolutely terrible, did not taste anything even remotely close to a Mojito.  It was so bad even I wouldn't finish it just for the buzz.
     Then we waited for our check.....and waited....and waited..... and waited.  The manager walked past us towards his little office near the front of the restaurant twice, without saying a word to us.  Then he went outside for about 5 minutes.... then came back and went to the kitchen... then finally came over and asked us if we needed anything.   Uhhhh yea the check, we've been sitting here for 13-15 minutes.  
     So finally the check came... and WOW! Each beer (12 oz.) was $5.  The previously mentioned absolutely terrible Mojito was a whopping $9.  The other dishes were $13-$19.  The Chicken Shawarma was $16 but definitely not worth more than $12.  So everything was definitely overpriced.  
     I would come back here if I had no other options, but if there is another Lebanese place open within about 15 miles I would go there rather than here.....

Visiting Vegas for the weekend and wanted to get away from the strip and enjoy authentic middle eastern atmosphere. We called in advance and reserved a table. 

Our table was ready and we ordered cold mezza ( appetizers) and a few cocktails. Haven't had a Lebanese Almaza beer (lager) in a while so I ordered that. My friend ordered Arak, and of course we wanted to smoke some hookah. Prices were very reasonable for food and cocktails.

Service was prompt, and the host/owner Hussam was on it. People started flocking in around 10:30 and the first singer appeared. He sang tradition Lebanese & popular Arabic songs. Followed by a belly dancer  that danced mainly in the dance floor area then moved between tables and was showered with tips. Then a second male singer came to the stage and sang upbeat songs from Arab countries, Armenia, and Turkey. 

In summary, excellent service, tasty food, friendly atmosphere, and good entertainment. Highly recommend this place for authentic Arab food and entertainment!",3oC57Z24H8GfR6jXiJJyUw,3,0,4,Y-aYsnKkwV-3skFXpP1GmA

The Shisha is regularly attended to by staff members circling the room. This place really comes alive weekend nights. There is live music with popular Arabic songs performed.

I was introduced to Lebanese cuisine by my Persian girlfriend back in 2005 when it was all the rage on 2nd St in Long Beach, CA. I remember that every time my husband would visit them on a monthly basis, this was a must. This in no way makes me an expert on Lebanese food, so my review is based on customer service we received and the flavor of the food and not on its authenticity. 

Just straight up slow slow service. So slow that they gave us free hummus and pita while we waited as they fried our French fries. 

I love hummus so I'm not sure what was wrong with there's. I can't even explain the taste. I thought at first, maybe we needed to stir it a little to bring out the flavor but it never got better. 

I ordered a chicken pita sandwich and even that was just blah. The only thing I enjoyed was the French fries.

And then back to, the service, just so slow. and because this was my work lunch hour, we were almost late back to the office. In order for us to get back to the office on time, I had to get up, go by the kitchen door and yell ""EXCUSE ME!"" because I wasn't getting any response with my delicate plea for help.

I'm hoping that this is one of those off days. But unfortunately, this was my first impression and this just wasn't a good one.  I see all the great reviews regarding this restaurant and I'm sure it is honest. So I guess the problem is inconsistency. I think once you have that all worked out, there will be less unfavorable reviews like this one.

This was huge and I could have easily just eaten this without ordering an entree. This could be split 4 ways, they also offer Grand Mezza, which is twice the amount of food. Only place in town to get Kebbeh Nayah, which is a definite if you come. 

A good accompaniment is Arak, it is to Lebanon as Ouzo is to Greece. It is 100 proof, delicious and I prefer over Ouzo or Sambucca. The way to drink it is over ice mixed with flat water. It is very smooth. 

For my entree I went with the seafood kabab, included a full salmon fillet and marinated shrimp. This was delicious. My date ordered the lamb shank which is supposed to be a house specialty (I'm not a fan of shank anything, so this was not my fav), but he gave it two thumbs up. Lots if Arabic desserts, try the Kanefeh, Maamoud and Lebanese Ice Cream. 

This place gets busy on the weekends around 10pm, they have live music (Arabic) and the belly dancers start at midnight. The atmosphere was good, large room, painted murals, comfy couches to sit and enjoy a hookah.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,5,2,4,YmuOzSUJIYZSJliuyptQjQ

The hummus was okay. I was disappointed to have paid so much for it and the pita bread was ...well, I can get better at Trader Joe's. For that matter, save your money and grab hummus and pitas at Trader Joe's.

Don't do the shawarma. Don't. Seriously. I moved far away from my beloved Mediterranean favorite restaurant and now I cannot find anything to replace it with. My 50.00 bill from Ali Baba was a kick in the stomach, or was it the Shawarma that was a kick in the stomach?

I'm on a serious Mediterranean kick and I am on a mission to try every place that is a reasonable distance from my home or work. This particular restaurant caught attention since they serving Lebanese food and I can't think of another place doing that in town.

I decided to call in a takeout order on a weeknight to pick up on my way home from work. The man taking my order asked how long until I'd like to pick it up. I said 15 minutes and he said it'd be ready. It was waiting by the door when I arrived 15 minutes later. 

The Kafta Kabob entrée came with two kabobs and white rice. The kafta was nicely seasoned and not greasy. The rice was flavorful with nice seasonings and some almonds for additional flavor. I like that they included onions, a grilled tomato, and a grilled jalapeno with the meat and rice. 

The Mini Mezza Appetizer (for one person) was a real standout. Everything that comes with this was incredibly delicious. It's also a ton of food and I would not describe the portion as ""for one"" as the menu says. I wouldn't not miss on this if dining in a group. The hommos is creamy, baba ghanouj is smoky, and lebnah is thick and tasty. The tabbouleh was fresh with the perfect amount of dressing. The falafel was spicy and the grape leaves were very good with a hint of lemon. There was plenty of pita bread to help scoop up all of the delicious hommos, baba ghanouj, and lebnah.

4451748,2013-10-14,1,llifBVCFAnr124WdKXmtLg,"Here's the real skinny on Ali Baba - either you're going to hate it or love it. There's probably not much in between.

As for me, my husband and I attended a friend's birthday party here on a Saturday night. As other reviews have mentioned this place gets poppin' on the weekends. My husband and I arrived as the first of the anyone in the party to get there. We were seated at one of the many long tables. That's a thing with Ali Baba, it does seem as though they tend to serve large groups, not small dining parties. I wonder if this is because of a tradition in Lebanese culture? I'm not sure.

Anyway, the place is dimly lit, with a disco ball spinning in one corner above the dance floor and musician's stage. There is a bar area toward the back. The whole of the restaurant is painted with Middle Eastern type scenes. 

On Saturday night they have a band and a singer (yes, a real singer) who sings VERY loudly and everyone cheers and claps and some people sing along. Well, the only way you can sing along is if you know what language he is singing in! People get up and dance all through the night and through their dinners. The singer roams the dining area enticing people to sing and clap with him. it's like a Mexican place that has a band/singers, but taken to the next level. 

By the way, they do hookah here directly on the tables while food is being served. So, if that ain't in your ball park, go elsewhere or it's going to seriously ruin your dining experience if others in the restaurant are partaking of the option, which our party was. I thought it was deliciously naughty and fun to be able to smoke, eat, and drink all at the same time. ;)

As for the food and drinks, and this is honestly one of only two dings I had regarding our experience here. I find the pricing to be a little much. My husband ordered a Jack and Coke and it cost him $10 (plus tip). I mean yikes. That's crazy. Plus, the food is NOT cheap. You can get food such as this elsewhere at lower prices. 

What we had food-wise was appetizer plates split between our entire group. We got two orders of their Grand Mezza (which was actually too much for 10 people). It came with: Hommos, Tabbouleh, Baba Ghanouj, Labneh, Falafel, Kebbehballs, Mixed Pies (Cheese, Spinach, Meat), Fool Medamas, Sujok, Bastermaand Grape Leaves. I honestly cannot at this point in time remember what I actually ate, although I tried to get a bit of everything. I thought everything had great flavor and was tasty. The only thing I did not like was the Bastermaand Grape Leaves. Too much of a bitter flavor. I think I would have to go back and really sit down and know what I was eating to really give a good review on the food. But overall, for our party these dishes worked well.

We also ordered two bottles of Arak for the table. This is the national alcoholic drink of Lebanon and it is 100 proof liquor and it is not cheap. We all imbibed and we were all very merry. We danced and clapped and ate and smoked and danced some more and ate and drank some more.

Honestly I loved partying here! I thought it was fun. The only issue I had was that it was just a tad too loud to hear much of what my party was saying. 

Besides the loudness and the high-prices Ali Baba was an awesome time. I would defintiely recomend if you are lookiing for something a bit different for a large group party.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,7,3,4,OyYu9f0HbPRNo_aENmVUhg

We were enjoying our dinner and were just winding things up when a scorpion fell from the ceiling and bit my husband twice..once on the neck and once on his chest.  It caused much alarm and distress among our table, needless to say.  The waiter was alerted to what had just taken place and with absolutely no sense of urgency whatsoever wanders back into the kitchen and comes back several minutes later with a mumbled apology and says they will, 'take $25 off our tab'...which, by the way, was well over $300!

STAY AWAY...it was a baby scorpion that dropped from the ceiling where there was a small hole!  I'm fairly certain that was not the only one up there!!!

She's half-Lebanese and this was her turf, food and location-wise.  She wanted grape leaves; I don't like them, so we settled on hummus and spinach pie for appetizers.  The hummus was okay, the spinach pie less so - four or five phyllo triangles stuffed with a dry spinach mixture.

For the main course we ordered ""Tasty Salmon"", which is supposed to be ""char-grilled fresh salmon with rosemary and lemon juice served with a special spinach sauce"".  There was no char, I didn't taste any rosemary and lemon juice, and the special spinach sauce was an orange-colored cream sauce with a few flecks of spinach.  The menu had no mention of cream in this sauce.  Cream and I have a love-hate relationship.  Overall, it tasted okay, but nothing special.  The salmon was a smallish portion, but it came with a huge mound of rice pilaf, and vegetables just this side of the freezer.

Service was very friendly and good at the beginning, but later on, when the big space was crowded with just two more tables (!), it was somewhat hard to get the waiter's attention.

My friend said that the beautiful patio fronting the restaurant is new.  Unfortunately, it was brutally hot and even steamy, so there was no way we were going to sit outside.  But since this restaurant is way on the other side of town, I'm unlikely to savor that patio. There are too many better, closer restaurants.

Apps:
It was happy hour between 4 and 7, so most of the apps were 1/2 off. We ordered fattoush, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush, meat grape leaves, and veggie grape leaves.  Everything was pretty good except the tabouli had too much dressing and could have been mixed with some more bulgar wheat. The fattoush was pretty good and it had enough sumac in it too. Some people don't put enough sumac in their fattoush.

Iced Tea - I think they put rose water in their tea. It was pretty good.

Entrees:
 Chicken shawarma plate. It came with hummus and real Lebanese style garlic sauce. The chicken was not cooked on the proper vertical rotisserie, but it was spiced properly and it tasted very good.

Lamb Kabob - my daughter ordered it well done, so she basically ruined the meat, so I didn't bother to try it. It was a nice presentation though with the rice and veggies.

Falafel plate - they were good. Served with the traditional tahini sauce.

I have to say if it wasn't for the music & singers (on weekends only) I would never go there to eat or drink anything. Since they have this automatic tip policy, the servers/staff could care less if they give you any ""service"" whatsoever. Went there for dinner & drinks and this one new server had me waiting almost an hour for a drink! After asking her several times ""where's my drink"" she finally comes over and instead of getting close to the table to set my drink down, she grabs it from her tray (far from table) and spills it all over me! she doesn't even apologize, and was like ""oops"", then walks off. I was appalled at this situation. Any other reputable establishment would have comped off my entire dinner or at least all my drinks. Not this place, they didn't even bother, they only took off 1 drink (which is the one she spilled on me & I did not drank). This place is horrible.",NnOddexO0L_eOCH6jwJqzA,0,0,1,DCfl7NmWnyuJbeON0Y8M6A

I printed one myself not knowing we already had one for our group. Needless to say I still have my coupon. Dont really want to go again even with a 25 dollar gift certificate. 

The food is ok at best, I found stuff half the price and way better in flavor, texture and quality. 

The shwarna didnt tatse like it came from the tradition spit, I could of fried my own beef/lamb at home way better. 

The chicken was moist but bland.

5199269,2010-11-29,5,llifBVCFAnr124WdKXmtLg,"Mediterranean buffet? Yes, please. This $15 culinary treat happens only on the weekends, and I stopped in on a Sunday. I was surprised to find the restaurant pretty empty, but that never stopped me from noshing on hummus!

The buffet offers approximately 8 hot dishes and 4 cold dishes, which I thought was a generous offering. The hot dishes included beef and chicken options. I was surprised to not find too many vegetarian entrees, as even the eggplant and grape leaves had beef. In terms of the flavor, I thought the hot options were good, but perhaps a little oily. The chicken dishes were tender, and the beef was all nicely seasoned. However, I only had one plate of the hot goods. 

For the cold dishes, there was hummus, tabouleh, baba ganoush, and romaine salad. I thought all of these were above average, so I filled up a second plate with these. Sadly, the pita (my preferred serving utensil for hummus and baba ganoush) was not homemade or warmed properly. It became hard quickly. 

When I was there, I think they forgot to turn on the music, so there was an awkward ambiance. You wanted to whisper! Service was rather nonchalant. 

If it were several dollars cheaper, it may earn a fourth star, but the price to tastiness ratio isn't quite there, and the pita bread was a real disappointment. Still, for a weekend gathering of pals, it is still a good option!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,9,3,aCo_iKFHmvDv4W7389heYQ

I would recommend all of my friends to go just because of her. If they lose her they're in trouble. Thank you so much Monica for being amazing!!,pA6RYPC4xfqyloo11AsZJQ,3,0,5,DnXj0xtom51bbJZAfUwINg
5375913,2016-08-07,5,llifBVCFAnr124WdKXmtLg,"Well for starters if I could give them zero stars I would. I have gone to many middle eastern restaurants and had great experiences. So I had very high hopes for this restaurant but I was extremely let down. I have middle eastern background so I thought this would be one of my best experience since I know how everything is. So it turns out that I was wrong and extremely disappointed. When we first walked in the door we automatically felt unwelcomed. We didn't think much of it and sat down to enjoy our night. So as the night went on, the owner/manager didn't even care  to ask us how our experience was but he went to ask the other tables constantly. Then came the music, I had talked to the singer and he was more then happy when I requested Armenian music. I thought everyone would enjoy it and dance along, since we were enjoying there's, but I was wrong. Looks like my music was also unpleasant. I will not recommend this restaurant especially to my Armenian community. The only positive experience from this place was our server. I over all felt unwelcomed and am disappointed at the money we spent there. Thank you I will never be back no matter what.",nJ1C5GSsCuhNbWFc7ERE-g,1,0,1,ZS8WbV7RD7A21yyEDww8hA

They have the standard stuff like hummous, babaganoush, and lebni, but there are most interesting treats, like kibbe, and a mindblowing bean concoction which is intensely garlicky and the beans are so buttery they melt in your mouth, they also serve up some pastries similar to mini spanakopitas as well as chunks of feta, olives and some fresh jalapeos, I could go on, there are thing's I've forgotten to mention, I'm sure. We've also had some of their entrees and sandwiches, all of them were excellent. Definitely seek this place out. 

One word of warning, they have live music on Saturday's and Fridays and it's wacky Mediterranean music with a belly dancer that walks around all the tables, nothing wrong with that, except it's a bit too loud and I like to be able to sustain a conversation over dinner.",oi2vm37j6CQGg_42avKwQw,9,3,5,J6UXSQw1dl9IVaWx6cuing
