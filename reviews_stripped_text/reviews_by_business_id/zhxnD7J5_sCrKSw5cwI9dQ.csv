I drove up to the speaker box on their drive thru lane; I was immediately greeted, I was offered to listen to their specials, I ordered a special combo with chicken, fries, a biscuit & a drink for $4.99. I asked the order taker if it was possible for her to hold the biscuit and substitute for fries instead, she kindly said it wasn't possible, so I said that's fine just hold the biscuit; I wasn't going to eat it, & I didn't want it to go to waste.. Before completing my order I asked her to upsize my drink to a large, and so I thought she did. When drove up to the window, she was nice, but not enthusiastic, just the minimum.. I paid she gave me my drink a SMALL drink, and when I got home I opened the box & the first thing I see is a golden buttery BISCUIT. I rated my overall experience 2 stars, because the service was fast, but my order wasn't correct due to the lack of attention to detail. From other reviews I've read it seems the employees should be oriented on customer service.",68IW-sxk2plGV2uUaEa_Dw,0,0,2,2W9F7JyRZWEo_m3JR8oG1w

We got home and there were more crunch than meat on the tenders not only that the meat was extremely dry, the fries were chewy. The manager looked as if she had a problem with people ordering food. The whole establishment is terrible, the worst I probably will never go there",1tUVPFVwtiJWfJM9CrkWNg,0,0,1,C5y9VTPtUgYxbb8v_vu8UQ
796653,2014-06-11,0,zhxnD7J5_sCrKSw5cwI9dQ,I really love Popeyes they have excellent food. But the one on bonanza has the worst customer service especially the drive thru girl her name is Kenia. She has the worst attitude and the worst customer service. I asked for a drink holder she threw down my straws and rolled her eyes because I asked for a drink holder. I hope they find professional employees for their establishment. Because she is worst employee on the one on bonanza specially that drive thru girl.,_ZxUVj9LHBdMknmr54wevA,0,0,1,xKpIxvkotUe_TbLmOYenhg

They were already cleaning everything and had attitude when I said I would wait for the wings to be cooked. I parked and waited and watched as they turned away multiple cars of people who wanted chicken so they could CLOSE EARLY.  Lazy worthless employees giving Popeyes a bad name. Then a Hispanic male who looked like a manager walks outside hands my wife our chicken wings saying have a good night. When I get home I'M SHOCKED to find overcooked wings WITHOUT BREADING FLOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Complete crap to pull that kind of stunt! They were upset they couldn't chase me away so they messed up the order being LAZY. Too lazy to do Thier jobs till closing like a GOOD POPEYES. They wouldn't answer the phone also that night. I called after opening the box. The next day a nice female manager remade the order and it was perfect WITH BREADING FLOUR lazy night shift early closers!!!!!!!!!

RAISING CANES KNOWS HOW TO TREAT A CUSTOMER!!!! You lost a customer who seriously eats out almost every day. 

Get your night shift crew together!!!!! Want to close early? ???? Then don't work the closing shift jerks",Gl8DTNp1pSFqKN4LxsiLIA,0,1,1,SxzUJbO17y7KfA6-TdbStw

Well the service was ok and pretty fast as I didn't have to wait long for my order and the food was hot.  Or course I ate the fries on the way home (I just can't help it) and at the chicken and a biscuit once I got home. 

Well the chicken very extremely puny and lacked any kind of spiciness whatsoever and tasted like their regular chicken.  I mean these pieces of chicken were really small and made me regret not going to my default chicken spot Church's Chicken. The fries were ok and didn't taste like it was cooked in old grease and fairly warm.  And the biscuits were pretty good also but I see that also getting smaller as time goes on. 

I probably will not be stopping here again and will listen to my first mind and go to Church's Chicken instead.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,2,pjDNoREZOT6TKn5MrMelmg

Now, we've never been through the drive through which apparently catches hella flack on here lol but the service inside isn't bad. The place is clean. Bathrooms were clean. This is always a wash you're hands after type of meal. Out of all the fast food chicken joints Popeye's is the best imo especially their red beans & rice and their tea. I also like their biscuits and the fact that the food is always hot.",3ZCS3niZj8GjbZY6Dx7uqw,1,1,4,TjREfF6XTHIXbKQ1djUjuQ

I know I should check it each time but I hate holding up the car behind me.  The employees are young and don't understand the value of customer service. They never thank you for your order. My last order was their 'limited time only' waffle fried strips with special honey sauce. Guess what?  They were out of the sauce!  Completely ruined my meal. I won't be going back to this location. 

Well, I did go back!  It was worse this time. I bought the $5 Spicy Honey Strips. It might as well have been a cardboard box. I swear it was the worst chicken I have ever attempted to eat. I gagged!  It tasted like dried out fish. Needless to say, I didn't eat it. I went hungry that night.",w9z4RxpTpGg4pOlr1h2k_A,0,0,1,6bnUddUpBkmFZQi_EMS-Hw

I got the 3 piece combo and they gave me all white meat and it's such a good spice. This is definitely for people who can't stand crowds.,-UfRzeLgzIm-Pvf_F00k2Q,0,0,5,Q8Sj0g3U-nnocmF6UQGSPg
5228547,2012-04-19,0,zhxnD7J5_sCrKSw5cwI9dQ,"VEHEMENT is putting it mildly!!! I went thru the drive thru of this Popeye's while  on my lunch break on 4/17/2012. I started watching my calories for health reasons. I must say the lady @ the window assisted me, as she took my order with excellent customer service. So I decided to go back today 4/18/2012 and order the chicken wrap as I did yesterday. It is only a $1.61 nothing at all to pay, when I usually spend over 5 bucks a day for lunch.

 But like I stated, I was watching my calories. I pulled in approached the speaker and asked  to order a chicken wrap WITH OUT the WRAP ( a heavy, large, flour,  tortilla) Which makes up most of the chicken wrap, in addition to the calories. Immediately with out any thought the woman-behind the speaker said ""No! We can't do that) this was @ 12:30 noon Ironically there were no cars behind me. That should have been a red flag to me. But I was hungry and apparently oblivious too. So I said I would pull forward to the window. 

As I approached the window I repeated the order and the woman said ""I told you NO we can't do that"". My reply was: What do you mean you can do that?  
She says in her very broken English, You have to buy the chicken strip separately and it will cost you more. @ that point I requested to speak with a member of management. 

She rolled her eyes telling me I am the manager. SMH because I'm hungry, my lunch is just about over. I didn't believe Melissa, because the badge she  was wearing did not indicate manager, and her appearance defiantly  was not that of a manager over seeing an eatery.   
 So I became upset at this point. I asked her what was the problem? mentioning that my request was not rocket science. I didn't want anything free. All I wanted was my chicken strip and tablespoon of red beans and rice that come in side of the wrap.

No more no less. 
She asked me how is she to prepare that. With tears in my eyes, because I was starving and my time was limited. I said... Look lady, how difficult is it to place a chicken strip and a tablespoon of red beans and rice on the the paper you wrap the wrap in. She says:"" well it's gonna  take four minutes to cook, because you dunt tell me if you want the chicken spicy or mild"". Then she request that I park off to the side of restaurant as the chicken cooks. And some one will bring it out,Because customers were behind me.

 I asked her what the hell am I?  and I refused to move until she gave me my order. Amazingly  the chicken strip appeared before my eyes. But the saddest part about it, was after all of the drama ,I returned to work late and hungry.

 I was afraid to eat the food Concerned that It may have been tampered with. A word of advise to Corporate and Franchisee alike. I will be sure to spread the news about my Very Poor service at this establishment.  With that said, Hopefully the drive thru will continue to look like a ghost town until your business is no more. And when it happens, Just remember the service @ your establishment is POOR, POOR ,POOR : (",ieC7pjTPm1jGtj5da1Bx0w,3,0,1,ht4NsSYNo0Bpo3solyyKlQ
5344446,2017-05-15,0,zhxnD7J5_sCrKSw5cwI9dQ,"Ordered 5 box of 3 tenders, side & biscuit, sides were fine, as I bit in the chicken tender it was hard chicken, not soft as it should of been, it's was under cooked as if it were still frozen, Yuck, so I can the restaurant & told me if I wanted refund, I had to bring the food all the way back today with my receipt to have it replaced?? First of all why I have to drive the undercooked chicken all the back in order to replace it, & it has to be today, bad customer service, you served bad chicken & all you say is sorry but you have to bring it back, yea NO, i wasted $6.50 & will never eat there again",rAk4Vh2HWs2geS2cxekj7A,0,0,1,EnAdsgGfjQEyhDgOQ2QAWQ
5490796,2011-12-29,0,zhxnD7J5_sCrKSw5cwI9dQ,"Restaurant was very dirty inside. The manager taking our order got it wrong 3 times. They've got 7 people working and still can't keep chicken ready to serve. Waited 7 minutes just to place our order to find out they had none and it would be another 15 minutes to cook some more. The spicy chicken strips (while had good flavor)  were extremely dry and small (more like large chicken nuggets). The green beans were cold, the large mashed potatoes were only half full and their soda tasted like the machine had not been cleaned in a few months. Very disappointing.",e8Y8NIX1fTmM9kAan859Kw,1,0,1,3EuPgHomaapDjGSZerLzPg
5661250,2014-03-11,2,zhxnD7J5_sCrKSw5cwI9dQ,"I just wanted a chicken wrap with ranch.

When I visited Popeye's tonight, my sister and I went through the drive-thru. While we were at the speaker, we asked about what was in their chicken wrap. We asked a few questions (if there was lettuce and ranch in it, how big the wrap was), but the ladies couldn't hear us and asked us to finish our order at the window. Eventually, we decided on 2 chicken wraps. While cashing up our order, one of the ladies started talking in Spanish to the cashier. Fortunately for me, my sister understood everything. They called us spoiled, complicated, and picky. Just for asking about the products you were trained to sell? So unprofessional and plain rude! Haha, and to finish it off, she put one packet of ranch in our to-go bag for two wraps. Very poor customer service.

About the food.. The chicken in the wraps were good. Flavorful like I hoped. The wrap itself was sooo plain. The ladies never told us they put rice and beans in the wrap when we clearly asked what was in it. Obviously ranch would be terrible in this kind of wrap.

I don't like writing these kinds of reviews. I love Popeye's, but I will definitely not be returning to this particular store.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,3,1,1,jcFraM_7oSe8LuvI3tW4dw
5897640,2014-04-02,0,zhxnD7J5_sCrKSw5cwI9dQ,This place has terrible customer service. I was in the drive through and wanted to add a soda to my order and they told me I couldn't get one because someone was behind me and the couldn't re-open my check?! That is so ridiculous. What kind of business is this where I can't add something to my order? They couldn't have gone to another register that was open?! I have never been to a place in my life that was not able to add something to a check. They must not want any business. They need to train their staff a lot better!!,iyUFEq2iyIzb0gzBOvBNdA,2,0,1,yRNekku9CVvQ73Y0O1ScLw
