So, we eat at In-n-Out almost every time we go there. Every location has been great. This one (and the one on Blue Diamond) are not as crowded as other locations. 

My favorite is the double-double ""animal style"", which means they put mustard on the beef while cooking, add grilled onions, extra sauce and add pickles. Pickles are not put on their burgers unless you ask for them, or order ""animal style"". When I'm really hungry I get a 3x3 'animal style', which is three patties and three slices of cheese. You can even get a 4x4 or 5x5 etc..,. 

The quality is always great. I don't know why, but their burgers always TASTE better than any other fast food burger place I've been to.

In the short amount of time that we were there, two very rude customers were as well. I, as well as my fianc√©, were very impressed with the staff and how they handled the customers. The first one was a lady who was obviously on her lunch break from goodwill. She continued to interrupt other customers to ask how much longer her order would take.  The second was a man, whom, from the moment he walked in, was treating staff inappropriately and seemed very agitated for reasons unknown to me. We lost our appetite immediately after he began yelling at the young man with his French fries. He was screaming about needing fresh fries very condescendingly. The young man kept calm and cool, he apologized and accommodated to the barbaric  mans requests.  
The staff's professionalism in the matter is what I wanted to write this for.  They deserve praise for their hard work and outstanding customer service. 
As two people in the service industry, we appreciate when others can do all that these kids did today.

1375835,2017-06-23,11,Yq92uUpugGyJLvDtcDRunw,"In-N-Out, In-N-Out, my favorite burger in the world.

Let's be honest, I haven't tried every burger in the world. There might even be a better burgers elsewhere in the world that I haven't tried yet, haven't.. but would like to some day. That is always a possibility. But from here on out, I stand by what I said.

In-N-Out has been around for a long time. But while their contemporaries chose a different route, including the ones with the golden arches, to sell out to the man, In-N-Out said that people deserve quality. They deserves our BEST. That's what I'm talking about people. Creating a fresh, tasty burger, with fresh ingredients. It's not something that should be frozen and then reheated in a microwave. It's all about doing things the right way, and it shows by their massive, cult following.

Buns. I like big buns, and I cannot lie. You other brothers can't deny. In-N-Out has great buns. They don't get too squishy when you bite into them, but they aren't dry either. The meat. Never frozen. NEVER. It makes a huge difference in terms of the moistness of said patty. The cheese is underrated at In-N-Out, they use a cheese that taste like 100% dairy. And, come on. Special sauce? Yeah, I'm about that. Just pour it all over, man, all over babay. Fries? I like em well done, but that's just how I roll. Like an Animal.

You can't really beat the prices for what you pay for. The employees are really friendly. I wouldn't even take a star away if it was crazily busy all the time. I would not be able to in good conscious, considering everything that is involved.I will forever love the burgers from In-N-Out, my first one was life-changing, and my last meal will always be a Double Double, Animal Style.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,19,20,5,R1BpHJ5K1Ak7oChWvggulQ

Not to mention an older couple was introduced by animal style fries when I sat down with my order. Pretty sure I changed their life and they will never look at a fry the same again. I've never been a huge fan of In N Out fries (here comes the backlash), but who can go wrong with melted American cheese, that special sauce, and grilled onions?

1434658,2016-01-29,0,Yq92uUpugGyJLvDtcDRunw,"In n out is my favorite place to get a burger. It is cheap, it is basic, it is good! The hamburger and bun have a crispiness around the border which makes it feel like there is a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. The coke for some reason even tastes better than usual. The fries are just average and I think McDonalds has the upper hand here. But their hamburgers are awesome! 

So what about this location? The crappy thing about In-N-Out is the drive through can get RIDICULOUSLY long, but they are relatively fast. But at this location it is particularly difficult because there is a break in the line to allow cars to pass. This break causes 2 things: first is you don't know where the line begins, and second it causes some cars to crowd in front of you. Also, being in a parking lot you often block in other cars. But they do a decent job of having someone outside to take the order.

The other bad news is if you decide to order from the inside it takes forever! A long line in the drive through is faster than being the only person on the inside. I'm not sure why that is. Either way you must try In-N-out!",BGZcv3B3mlofVJYG_TTsMw,0,0,4,dh8xlMU9A8PsARRXmH5jDw

If your worried about the carbs, order your burger animal style and there won't be any buns, it will be wrapped in lettuce.  If you don't mind the carbs, then order your fries animal style...it will come with grilled onions, cheese, and their special sauce on top.
Their shakes are bomb also..I always mix mine with 1/2 chocolate & 1/2 strawberry...i'm craving one right now so I'm gonna go grab one! Hope to see you there!

The burger itself is just so unappealing to me. It's primarily all produce. The actual burger is no bigger than what you get at McDonald's. And my burger always seems to have a weird crunch to it. And personally, I don't like my burgers to crunch when I bite into them.

What I do like is the animal-style fries. But I can never quite finish them as the fries always seem to be too overdone at this location.

After eating here the night of march 16th, I woke up the next morning and noticed some stomach cramps. by the mid afternoon the cramps got really bad. After a few hours I was puking my guts out and having extreme diarrhea. I am still not back to normal from this.

I remember when looking at the hamburger patty seeing a bit of pink, however at the time I thought it could of been a piece of tomato. Could be the patties are undercooked or who knows what could of gone wrong. Either way, after most of the puking had subsided,  I decided to stop by and tell the manager what happened so they could have a heads up in case there was a contamination or if someone was not frying the patties all the way. Talked to the manager and was totally blown off. Was told it was not possible for me to get food poisoning at In-N-Out, it was just not something that could happen there and that I must of gotten it somewhere else. 

I was not very happy that I got food poisoning, but hey, people make mistakes, I thought I would at least give them a heads up so they could eliminate future problems. I can forgive for an honest mistake. But no, I was treated like a total idiot and was given a total BS response. Absolutely no concern or effort was put forth when it comes to food safety, not even a ""Sucks that happened, I'll talk to the cooks and make sure the patties are not getting undercooked"". 

So yeah, I like their burgers, I am not so liking being food poisoned by them, I can forgive though. However I am MAD that when you bring a food safety issue to their attention they will not even admit to the possibility it could of been them or at the very least make a token effort to PREVENT possible future cases.

Coming from the East Coast, In N' Out was this idolized burger business model which marketed fresh ingredients in a super paired down list and even a secret menu which gave those in the know, 'an insider elite status' (it was even brought up during class at The Hotel School...although I wouldn't call it a menu, rather a variation on existing items )  But, In N' Out has that evolutionized mystique, a cross between nostalgia, fast-food fare with that healthy, Californian fresh-food zeitgeist that dupes all of us into believing that we're eating healthy and saving the dolphins with each purchase...

With that said, the burgers, the architecture along with its core values has become a staple in the West Coast culinary landscape and it's always on the list of places we go to grab something quick and delicious, (it's really bad that there's one across the gym...)

It's a pretty simple menu, and going there is no brainer, but we like to get a couple of things different; for the burger, it's always a 2x4,  (a double double - two beef patties with extra cheese -four slices) and get it, 'Animal Style' where the patty is Mustard Grilled, with Grilled Onions, Thousand Island Dressing and Extra Pickles.  You can ask for the Burger to be, 'Medium Rare' for it be pink in the middle, (sometimes well done can be too tough for me) all in all, it's got great flavor and the Beef shines through above all the condiments....

For the Fries, it's got to be, 'well done' (cooked until they're extra crispy).  I don't know, but maybe because they cut the fries fresh, they can be chewy/soggy so when you order well done, they come out crunchier.  on top of that, we order them, 'Animal Style' as well; that's with Melted Cheese with Grilled Onions and Thousand Island Dressing on top.  You have to eat it with a fork and it's decadent!!! Wash it down with a Root Beer Float, (Root Beer with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Creams) and you're back in the 50's, beeboping to the jukebox after school with girls in hoop skirts and neckerchiefs swung to the side!!!!

In fact, I feel like having In N' Out right now.... gotta run!!!!

2363665,2012-05-09,2,Yq92uUpugGyJLvDtcDRunw,"#1 fast food ever. Drive thru can take a while. I prefer to dine in just because the fries lose crispiness in the bag. If you come with a food companion, get their order and have them save a booth. Seating can be tough.

My favorites:

Neapolitan Shake- vanilla, chocolate and strawberry coarsely mixed and it is truly a pleasure. No fruit chunks in the strawberry either.

Animal Style Fries- don't be a fatty, share. Loaded with spread, grilled onions and a slice cheese you will need a fork and a wet nap. We usually get these and a regular fries to offset the guilt.

Double-double Protein Style- sure the bun is good, but you know what's better? Tons of thick, crisp lettuce that doubles as a ""burger cup"" if you will. I go light on the onions because if you don't it's way too much. The cheese oozes all over. If you have no dignity you can eat large chucks off the wrapper. My husband calls it ""cheese paper.""

Now if you get regular fries you have to ask for the spread when you pick up your order. Get a condiment cup from the napkin station and DIP DAT!

The most ongoing pleasantry of dining here is the delicious stink you get on your hands. Don't wash it off! It's a gift. The curse of eating here is the gas. Sorry, but it's worth it.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,2,0,5,4458g3JVITMic0feDkiqZw

Yet usually every other time I come here i'm either harassed by them lurking outside begging for $ not food or sometimes they venture in to panhandle there which really sets me off. Last time there was a real winner who smelled of booze and filth who was asking folks in line for $$ the employee told him to stop, gave him and meal and drink and told him he could stay in the building if he would stop harassing customers. Well a few bites into his cheeseburger he starts asking for $$ again saying it's for him being catholic or some such nonsense. They again told him to stop he gets up makes a scene, yells slurs they call metro and after he gets done cussing he leaves the food and wanders outside. They had to lock him out, he eventually wandered off before metro came. Yes I know this is no fault of the restaurant just a byproduct of where they are located.

OK, maybe not that sad, but pretty sad.  

In-N-Out burger is all about the secret menu.  Secret menu you ask?  I am talking animal style!  What is animal style?  It's a mustard-cooked patty with additional pickles, cheese, spread and grilled onions diced up and mixed together on the grill before getting dumped on your burger.  Yes it's pretty much the most awesome burger ever.  I also get chopped chilies on my burger.  This will put some extra kick on you burger.  Don't forget to get a double double or if you are feeling adventurous then go for the 3X3.  

What's great about the IN N Out is the the prices are pretty reasonable.  The restaurant can get pretty packed.  Sometimes they are slow to clean the tables.  So you end up guarding the table you want to sit at waiting for someone to come clean it.  If you have guest from out of town that aren't from California you have to take them to In-N-Out burger.

I enjoyed sinking my teeth into that nice, juicy, fresh tasty burger that came with a basket of copious amounts of fries! I almost want to say that the burgers were better at Five Guys, but the prices at Five Guys are just completely rediculous. The three of us were able to eat here for under 15.00, which I think is more than reasonable.

Only complaint is that those booths are rediculously tiny! They were NOT made for 4 people to use! None of the three of us are large people. I am the ""largest"" at 5'7 and 170 and I felt like we had to get a little too cozy to fit in there. Next time Ill get it to go! ;)

Is the food good?, Yes. You have to try really hard to mess up a burger and fries, but, I'm not here to talk about the delicious treats served here, but the service. This is the kind of place that will literally do anything within reason to serve its customers...

- You want neapolitan shake?... coming right up. 
- You want animal style fries on your double double and you want it protein style?... You got it. 
- Grilled cheese?... got it!
- You want an animal style milkshake?... small or medium? 

You really have to fail at life if you can't properly order from this menu. Even if it's you're first time here, because the menu is so basic. Burgers, fries, and shakes. Done!  

Beyond the one million food algorithms you can create here, the prices are still considerably lower than any other fast food place. I mean my order is almost always under six dollars and is sufficient enough to feed the beast. A double double, fries, and water. Yeah. I don't drink soda. 

Plus the food is good! Don't believe the haters. No one really hates In-N-Out, besides vegetarians, but they have veggies options available! Really, anyone who hates In-N-Out is probably just a spiteful jerk who looks for the bad in everything. I can name a few people right now... Skeletor, Thanos, Tuco from Breaking Bad, Cosmo G.

Ordered a double double with no lettuce, tomato, or onion, but added grilled onions for no cost (basically the way to get it animal style, without saying animal style) :) Also got the fries animal style, yes I know, let's have a few calories today for lunch ehh?
Walked right up to the counter at about 1:45 yesterday, (5/20) and the kid was quick at the register, got everything right, and the price I think was in the $8.50 range. 

This location isn't the closest to me in town, but when I'm cruising down the 215 or in the st. rose and eastern intersection area sometimes I'll hop over to this location and knock out a double double (this location as most of you will know is just seconds off the 215 and Eastern exit, on the east side of the street) 

I got an unusual amount of fries this time, not real sure why but they were awesome, it took me a long damn time to polish these off, but man they always have the perfect crispiness and you know they're fresh. You can see the guy (or girl) shredding these fat potatoes right in front of you, then straight into the fryer less than a couple minutes later.

I am not a huge fan of fast food, I really like quality whether I am spending $5 or $50 and  In-N-Out is one of the few places which understands this. You can't really go wrong with there 3 menu items, hamburger, cheeseburger, and a double cheese burger. But thats pretty much about it. I dream of a day when they come up with a chicken sandwich, but hey I CAN dream right? Overall the food here is great, fresh veggies, actual potatoes for their fries, nothing frozen, and consistent quality make this a great place. I really do wish they mad more variety cause you are SOL if your friends decide on In-N-Out and you want something other than burger.

Also their service rocks! I know its weird to talk about service at a fast food restaurant but the employees here rock! They never get the order wrong, they are super nice, quick, and on top of getting you whatever you need. It really does make a difference.

If you haven't already, check out their secret menu which I am sure you can find on the internet. One of the worst kept secrets in the fast food world. Also keep an eye out for the random bible verses they have on all their stuff.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,3,5,4,lu5qWMRWLXLCJ_PzWAt_iw

3707204,2012-08-03,2,Yq92uUpugGyJLvDtcDRunw,"This place severely needs a major edit in Yelp's database to earn anything over 4 stars.  To label this place ""fast food"" is terribly misleading and for me to enjoy it, I have to erase this thought from my head.  Every time I go here, I get mentally prepared to wait at least 20 minutes to get my food whether I dine in or go to the drive thru. 

Once you get prepared and realize this is not a fast food place, you then have to judge the food.   The burgers are greasy and tasty but definitely do not compare to a grilled giant patty at numerous other restaurants here in town.  The ingredients are fresh but somehow always manage to fall out from the burger no matter how fancy In-&-Out wraps them.  

The fries are tiny and average.  They are so small, I often find myself having to pinch a number of them just to get a substantial bite.  Also the tiny size of them tend to lead to getting ketchup on the fingertips when dipping.  

Another thing that has always bugged me about this place is the incredible crassness and smugness that many patrons exhibit by knowing about the ""secret menu.""  Newsflash people...There is nothing secret about any menu since the advent of the internet.   

Bottom line, this place is okay if you have at least 20 minutes to kill.  Just don't expect to be ""In & Out"".",lwFrxQb-Y1rI7xMG1fDlow,3,3,3,SPPHF-LZOO_QsCqcMBzFeA

If you're looking for a quick lunch, don't expect to get in/out of this place in less than 20 minutes after ordering. During lunch/dinner hours, the drive-thru creates a line of cars that do their best to wind themselves throughout the parking lot while people are trying to get in/out of their parking spots.

As someone not a particular fan of burgers, this is pretty much the only spot I go to and am always happy with a burger. Probably for the fact that their burger patties are thin and don't overpower the rest of the ingredients that make up a burger here. 

This was my first time coming to this location and I came at opening. There were only one two other people ahead of me in line, so I was able to order quickly and only waited maybe 5-7 minutes before my food was ready. The guy at the register taking orders was in good spirits. He was efficient and made sure to repeat each order before telling you the total. He made sure to smile and welcome new customers as they entered. 

Since I came at opening, everything was clean. From all the table to the drink station and the floors. The ketchup was filled as well the drinks and the lemons. Trash was empty and bathrooms clean and stocked. 

I ordered the #2 combo which is a cheeseburger with fries and a drink for just over $5. Can't beat that price for what you get, especially since everything was cooked just right and it was fresh and delicious! I love how the fresh veggies are always so crispy here and they don't skimp on them. Unlike places like McDonald's or Burger King, they make sure to give you a whole piece of lettuce, a large slice of tomatoes and a whole slice of onion as well. If you want something taken out or extra they are always willing to accommodate you.  My guest got the #1 combo which is a double-double and made his fries animal style. Only thing I would've changed was to ask for my fries to be extra crispy, but other than that everything was perfect.

If you like ""normal"" burgers, then these burgers are pretty darn good.  ""Normal"" being cheese, special sauce, lettuce, tomato, onions.  Cheese melts well.  Beef is juicy.  Vegetables are fresh.  I'm not a fan of raw onions though.  Thankfully, they'll ask if you want onions each time.

However I much prefer ""specialty"" burgers over ""normal"" burgers.  Things like sourdough bread, onion straws, blu cheese, barbecue sauce, guacamole, and bacon are what I like.  In-n-out has none of these things as they maintain their 50s era vibe.

The fries are absolutely vile.  They have a weird glaze of vegetable oil on them.  They don't taste like potatoes; they simply taste like crystallized vegetable oil.  I simply abhor shoestring fries.  You can put as much junk on them as you want (""animal style"") and they'll still be nasty.

I would also like to point out the douchebaggery of the ""secret menu"".  News Flash: it's not a secret.  You aren't cool.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,1,1,3,UK9LeiW89rloos1Ttirmxw

4314988,2014-04-12,2,Yq92uUpugGyJLvDtcDRunw,"King of the west coast, nothing beats the quality and price of in n out which is why i hail this burger mecca as one of the best! Where can you find a burger joint where all the ingredients are fresh, you can see the workers make the food while you wait for it in the drive thru and a secret menu to make you feel so exclusive you little hipster you!  In n  out doesn't need an extensive menu with new burgers and meals coming out every month.  They stick with a very simplistic menu which i respect a lot.  They know burgers. 

This particular location is no different in taste from the other in n outs which is good.  I've been to probably all of the different locations and consistency in taste and service is unrivaled.  I always get the same order which is the #1 double double animal style with chopped chilis, extra toasted bun, no salt in the burger or fries and if i'm feeling it the Neapolitan shake (which is amazing and if you're the adventurous time, dip your fries in it).  Orders come out pretty quickly considering the volume of customers. 

Coke products are available and their pink lemonade is awesome.  Nice and tart! I like to fill about 3/4 of my cup with sprite and finish it off with some pink lemonade.

When you order is done, they'll call your number and here is where you can enhance your meal even more.  ASK FOR SPREAD! its the special sauce they put in their burgers and i like putting extra and adding it to the fries! Also ask for a fork so eating the fries with the sauce isn't messy.  They have chilis by the condiments section, add these to the fries as well. 

Overall, one of the best quick bites that doesn't compromise quality with speed.

**At this location, the local bums like to hangout at the outside seating section so be careful

You know, I always stay clear away from all fast food places whenever possible.  My kids and wife like burgers and we have tried all the latest places. From 20.00 burger places down to 1.00 dollar specials.  In the end, ya cannot beat Inn N Out on a regular ""gotta have it"" basis.

1.  The experience - Sure the other places are good to try out and have a completely different ambiance. I agree. Yet dollar for dollar the food here is comparable to most I have tried in all the places here in Vegas.

2.  The price - You cannot beat the prices. For a family of three, you can easily spend under 20.00.  

3.  Parking and Access- Okay, this particular Inn N Out is on Serene and Eastern near the 215 in a strip mall. It's entrance is just before a huge freeway onramp. This makes turning in with raging drivers behind you a challenge at best. Now I am not sure why we see so many strip malls empty and with parking spots that look brand new after 5 years or more, but this place is always very busy. Parking can always be found, but perhaps not directly in front of the restaurant. 

4.Take Out - They seem to focus on getting the take out customers and the car line moving, so even though it may seem very long, it moves fast.  They do a great job of having a server walk out with a remote ordering system and getting to each car faster than the car getting to the ordering kiosk.  The only issue is that the lines can wind around the parking lot and can be a bit confusing.

5.  The FOOD - There is some great stuff on the menu and many not on the menu...

Shakes - Great, tasty, perfect texture and thickness!

Burgers - This is the best.  
Onions - Be sure to tell them grilled, raw or none
Cheese - You can specify how many, the default is one
Lettuce - FRESH and CRISPY!
Tomato- Big hunking slice. 
Meat - The perfect size. You can have a single, double double which is 2 patties and 2 cheese.
Protein Style - Wrapped in lettuce, without the bun

Not on the official menu - Here is a small sampling, I am sure there is more!
Animal Style - A Cheeseburger with mustard, extra sauce, pickle and grilled onion.
3 x 3- Three patties and three cheese
4 x 4 - You know the drill
Flying Dutchman- I haven't tried this one, but it is two patties and a cheese, that is IT.
Fries Animal Style - Yep you got it.

GK says why didn't I review this place before as it is the best deal for a great burger.  Check it out!

 But this location is murderously slow to one's lunch break!  I had three cars in front of me and it took 27 minutes from arrival to getting my order and leaving.  It wasn't anything off the secret menu, just a Double-Double combo.  But even when it was my turn at the window, it seemed lagged.

The ""secret menu"" enhances the already delicious burgers. Animal style consists of grilled onions, their house sauce (think thousand island), and cheese. It is artery clogging goodness. Protein style burgers come without the bun and wrapped in lettuce. I convince myself that by cutting out the bun, I am doing myself a great favor and ignore the calorie overload I am ingesting.  

The burgers are the main star and surpasses all other chains in flavor and value. The fries are my least favorite because they are too starchy. That is the problem with fresh cut fries, they do not get the time to soak and draw out the excess starch. By making them animal style makes it easy overlook this problem.

They stay open until 1:30 on Friday and Saturday nights and we made it here at 1:10 AM.  There was a long line in the drive-thru... there must have been at least eight cars in front of us but the line moved pretty quickly. We were out by 1:25... so not too bad considering the long line.

I had the number two which was the cheeseburger, fries, and drink combo. My boyfriend had the number one which was the double double, fries, and drink combo and he got his fries ""animal style"". I usually eat the fries first, I like it nice and fresh and hot. I waited one time to eat it after the burger and it didn't taste as good. But that's just me. By the way, I can't take a bite from my burger and then fries and then burger again. I like to eat one food at a time so I can really taste it and enjoy it without the interference of other foods coming into the mix. Get what I'm saying? LOL. The burger was good too but I admit, it was no longer hot by the time I got to it.

The young lady who was at the window spoke so fast! My boyfriend and I looked at each other like...  whoa! 

The next time we come here, I will most likely be a vegetarian by then. So instead of ordering a burger, I'll just order their grilled cheese which is not on the menu, but you always can ask for it.

Oh, I almost forgot this part... I thought it was cute when the guy who took our order asked if it was to go. Ummm.. yes!  We're ordering from the drive-thru! The boyfriend and I had a good chuckle. :)",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,8,10,4,59Ny5Tjj5YIanidRe-J7Zg

My personal favorite is the protein style (secret menu, which is pretty extensive) burger that replaces the bun with a healthy wrapping of lettuce.... so I can eat my fries!

There's just something special about the simplicity... the burger patty is so small, yet perfect.

Where In N Out is located its a pretty busy area, you have Chuckee Cheese to the 99 Cents store etc, right before jumping on the freeway! 

The drive thru line can get very long and the wait time is not as bad as if you were in a McDonalds drive thru line. They have a rope and poles to direct cars so no one gets cut in front of or from other directions. The last couple times we've been here it's not too bad, and wait times are 5-7 mins, depending on how much the first car ordered. 

Today though I have to state my first complaint. I ordered a hot chocolate. Now I've been reading the news and seeing them boast about how good the hot chocolate was with marshmallows...it was horrible. If you call watered down hot chocolate good then I guess you would love it. I was disappointed. I should've tried it then and there but I was on my way to work. I didn't even get the marshmallows.
