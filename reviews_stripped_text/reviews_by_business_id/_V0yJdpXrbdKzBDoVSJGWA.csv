Rooms smell, if happen to gamble and need help you actually have to take time and look for someone to help, and if your ticket is stock and your machine is not responding then good luck looking for someone while your money is in the machine. Also I was mailed some room comps as I have stayed gambled there before but after trying a few times I was told very rudely no we can't honor them as we only we have few rooms available, requesting to talk to the hotel manager was extremely un comfortable  and he was very unprofessional, he told me well it says in the fine print depending up on availability, and I said you do have rooms they are available what about that, he said well we can't give you those few rooms. Anyway no big deal, I would never ever stay or gamble in a place like this who treats people like that. Also I have never ever seen worse buffet in my entire life, I can't not even believe that people call that buffet, that's just the size of it but quality of the food, well I will not even go there as I am about to get sick.

My major complaint was the strong cigarette odor in the room, despite it being labeled as a non-smoking room. This was slightly disruptive to sleeping that night. I could not connect to the Wifi for the room during my stay. It's a solid 25 minute walk to the strip, which isn't so bad unless you've been walking around the strip all day.

The pool was generally nice but crowded, as would be expected on a Saturday in the summer. It's a shallow pool, maybe 3' throughout and filled with kids.

I couldn't tell if it was a language barrier, or if she was having a bad day, but it was all business with her, which is kind of unusual in Las Vegas.

The kitchen must've been busy because there was quite a wait for our meals, and our water cups weren't refilled during our visit. Again, unusual in Las Vegas.

Both burgers were tasty, but not all that special, except for two aspects: the greens used in lieu of iceberg lettuce were fantastic, and the onion ring appeared to be a sweet onion! I'm surprised other restaurants don't go this route because it's genius!

If we're in the neighborhood again, and hungry, we might go again, but given the curt waitress and slow meal preparation, probably we'd just go somewhere else.",wM826KHTxfMC4paZ13rwxg,1,0,3,xsASt48znLnQkg_atv-0eQ

I will start with the only positives - our room had AC, and we had a TV. But its downhill from there...
The location leaves a lot to be desired, unless you happen to be a victim of mental illness or some type of disorder because after dealing with these people trust me you will be crazy. Nestled a couple blocks from the strip the area attracts the sort of people that you would cross the street to avoid. As you enter the hotel, you are greeted by decor that is almost suicidal  and strange old men and women always angry looking at you as if it's he'll in here. Next, you enter the lift I have seen suicide attempts that adhere to more health and safety measures. Seriously - take the stairs. It rather optimistically has a four person maximum capacity. May God help you if one of your companions happens to be fat. In the hallways it smells like a run down slaughter house - but at least the carpet is almost clean. The same story continues in the room; there hasn't even been an attempt to clean it. The floors and surfaces are coated in dust; as well as a whole host of stains that I WILL describe in detail to fear you not to come here. Upon arriving our room had a Dirty DIAPER on the ground, BODY (pubic) HAIR on the bed, COOKIE CRUMBS on the bed, papers lingered all over the room, there was a not so mysterious YELLOW STAIN under the toilet and BROWN STAINS  on some of the towels.

Got off the airplane and called to find the free shuttle and as soon as I began explaining that I was at the airport the man on the phone cut me off and said go to ""ground 0"" and wait for the shuttle. He did not give a good explanation the where to go so I went toward the exit that said ""shuttles"". My mom and I waited until we saw a bus that said silver sevens and we went towards it to get in. The man, John or whatever said that we weren't at the right place for pick up but to ""hurry up and get in"". The whole way he was scolding us about how we could've gotten a ticket, embarrassing us in front of everyone else in the shuttle. When everyone got out he continued to scold us even after we apologized and explained that the man on the phone didn't give us much direction. After we arrived at the hotel, John walked up to us and continued his sermon about getting a ticket. If it was that much trouble he shouldn't have let us in and told us where to go instead. GEEZE, we get it. That kind of ruined the start of our mini vacation. It wasn't until we said we left him a tip inside the car did he quit scolding us. Thank God we only stayed a night. We ate at their buffet and the cashier girl can learn to smile a little bit while talking to us. She did not seem like she wanted to be there at all. After, we inquired about getting a taxi. The man up front said to let him know when we were ready and that it would be there within 5 minutes. When we were ready to call for one the person said it would be 10-15 minutes. We waited for around half an hour and still nothing. We asked them again and they told us to keep waiting and they'll call again. Still nothing and I was going to be late for my interview. I went in one last time to talk to this blonde lady at the desk and who merely seemed to listen or care about my issue and said there's nothing she could do about it and she could not guarantee when they would come. First they said 5 minutes, then 10-15, and now she can't guarantee it? Where's the consistency? I get it that it wasn't their fault but the taxi cab they have a partnership with but at least look like you are trying or that you understand why I am upset. I was fed up with the employees not caring about the customers who give them business. I left and just walked up to a taxi on the street which was SO much easier and who are a million times friendlier. I am so disappointed in the service here, especially when they have pretty nice rooms. Such a waste.

My GF and I were there playing the machines before going to eat because we had heard some good things about the food for the price. A couple of sketchy guys sat next to us at the machines that acted nice enough but they were still a little sketchy looking. I went to the restroom and when I came back, my GF was freaking out. One of the guys snatched her Iphone 6S while I was in the restroom and they ran out.

Contacted security about the incident and they were COMPLETELY LAME. Their response was basically Too bad, we have better things to do. They didn't give a damn about her or a stolen $600+ phone. Their attitude towards the situation was just downright rude and was basically tough Sh*t, you should have been paying attention cuz half the people here are going to steal anything you give them a chance to. Check out the surveillance tapes and see where they ran out to? Nah, don't waste our time. 

The Security's attitude at this joint was basically if you are not stabbed or shot, than leave us alone and you should have known better. Damn, I once had somebody steal a $25 chip from me on the table and Bellagio was all over it tracking the perp down all the way to their car and contacted Metro to have them arrested. 

So, moral of the story about this place, watch your belongings because if something happens to you, Security isn't going to give a damn unless it's a serious enough incident where Metro (Las Vegas Police) has to show up. Trust me, Metro has better things to do than coming in for stolen phone reports in Vegas.

Didn't really expect security to be able to track down the scumbags that did the apple picking and get the phone back, but at least they could have shown some empathy and acted like they cared.

936107,2013-11-19,1,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"This is my third stay in this hotel in the past year.  I come here because it's close to UNLV, which is where I need to be.  I think that others who have posted reviews for this hotel are being overly critical.  To be honest, this isn't the hotel where I'd stay if I came to Vegas for a fun trip.  I'd pay a little more and stay at a hotel on The Strip.  This isn't where you come if you want to soak yourself in the excitement of Vegas.  This is a no-frills hotel and casino.  The pros about this place are that it's cheap, it's clean, there's some opportunity for playing the slots or table games, and the food is decent.  The cons are that more than half the rooms in the hotel overlook the hotel parking lot.  Looking out my own hotel window, I see a bunch of hotel employees sitting on a bench waiting for a bus to take them home after their shift.  It's a little depressing.  It reminds you that Vegas isn't exactly a never-ending party for everybody.  For these hotel employees, it's just a hard job that requires manual labor, and the pay isn't even good enough for them to afford a car to take them home.  

The hotel recently changed its name to this new name.  I suppose they changed management.  It used to be called Terrible's Hotel & Casino.  I prefer the old name.  Silver Sevens is a very generic name that means nothing significant and can be easily forgotten.  Nevertheless, the hotel is still the exact same as it was under the old name and ownership.  

I paid $21/night here, plus an additional $3/day as a ""resort fee,"" which is still a term that I don't understand.  They say that covers the cost of using the pool (which I won't be doing because it's too cold), and the parking lot (which used to be free, so why are they charging money for it now?).  It does not cover the cost of internet.  There is wifi here, but it costs $4.99/day.

After reading some of the reviews, we were a little nervous about what kind of experience we would have, but we had a great time. If you're looking for a glossy high-roller experience, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a down to earth place that won't break the bank, it's great. 

A lovely gentleman named Joe checked us in and made sure we got a renovated room, which was quiet and clean and had a great jacuzzi tub. A lovely lady named Trinine checked us out and helped us with questions on the bill (the resort fee gets added AFTER your final total). We ate several meals at the Silver Spoon and had excellent food every time for much cheaper than we could have gotten on the strip (they know how to make a rare steak, BTW). The casino floor does still smell like cigarettes, but the upstairs rooms (at least the renovated one we were in) was odor free.

1014115,2017-04-23,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"I'm currently on day 2 of my stay at Silver Sevens, and these are my observations thus far... 

First, the numbers: $80+ per night for a ""premium room"" (looks like an average, not-bad/not-great room to me) for six days.  Upon check-in, a $100 deposit and roughly $150 in resort fees.  I'm not sure if these prices are hiked up due to the conference I'm attending (NAB), but I've heard there's a good chance that's the case.  Either way, they seem a bit high for what you get.  

The impression that I got upon arrival is that this hotel is best suited for older travelers.  The machines are mostly old, and the guests a mix of elderly visitors, locals, and a few younger guests mixed in sparsely throughout the crowd.  There was even a good old fashioned blender giveaway that I got to watch while I waited five hours to check in (3:00pm check-in time).  The more senior attendees lined up around the corner for their blender (which there must have been dozens of).  

My interactions with the hotel staff, including the front desk, security, restaurants, and gift shop, have been positive thus far (except for one floor waitress, who was still kind, but we'll get to her in a moment).  

Oddly enough, this hotel also boasts small esports competitions on their website (competitive video games for the uninitiated). I've heard it isn't a huge draw, but perhaps the hotel is trying to get younger guests any way it can and just doesn't know how to market the events.  Maybe?  They are advertised as being held in the Corona Cantina, a small sports bar off to the side of the casino floor, but I noticed that they now have signs indicating an actual esports venue upstairs.  

Sure enough, upstairs, amidst a small herd of slot machines, was a set of closed double doors with a standing banner next to them advertising esports events.  Based on the very narrow view I gathered from the crack between the doors, it looks like a pretty standard mid-sized conference room.  After asking the customer service desk if the esports competitions were now being held in the upstairs venue, he informed me that it was their bingo room and handing me a print-out copy of the website's advertisement.  As far as I'm aware, bingo is not an esport, so I assume there is some lack of communication on this issue.  I haven't attended a Silver Sevens esports competition yet, but I plan on winning it this Sunday so I will update this review with my observations if they seem relevant.  (Personally, this competition is what I was most excited for, in regards to my Silver Sevens stay, so I hope it is fun and not depressing or uneventful).  

One of my favorite things about Vegas is free drinks on the casino floor.  I ordered it but it never came.  That's all I can really say on that front, as I plan to do my gambling elsewhere.

Positive: If you are a dork like me, this hotel situated relatively close to both the Pinball Hall of Fame as well as Game Nest arcade.  

Negative: My main reason for this review and for giving 2 stars instead of 3... The wifi is terrible.  There are only thirty basic cable channels included on the television for free (that I can tell).  They suck, but so does TV in general nowadays.  No problem though, as I had planned to relax in my room watching Netflix, Hulu, Twitch, etc... but unfortunately the wifi is too slow to handle even that.  I did a speed test and peaked at 0.45mbps. I didn't bother testing the upload speed.  For younger guests, this is a violation of basic human rights and requires immediate action by the U.N.  Alternatively, you could shell out the cash to order from the TV's fine selection of adult entertainment.

Obviously, my stay is not over yet, and I fully intend to update my review if my experience changes drastically (for better or worse).  And also, if you're there on Sunday for the tournament, prepare to have your ass kicked... not really.  I'm not very good.


Update 1 (Day 3):

Positive: A senior manager at the hotel messaged me directly to ask about my concerns, and was completely open to the criticism (and was even able to find the humor in it), so that was nice.  Also, the internet has gotten somewhat better, and I imagine the slow speeds may have had something to do with it being Friday/Saturday night.

Negative:  So it's confirmed, the esports tournaments are no longer held at the Corona Cantina, and are held in the upstairs venue by a group called Leet Gaming (https://www.leet.gg).  Unfortunately, the Overwatch competition advertised on the hotel's website was not actually being held, so I did not get to compete. Sad face.  There was an odd moment when I asked Leet Gaming staff member if he was sure there was no Overwatch tournament, to which he replied, ""I make the schedule so I should know"".  That's simply one of those moments where I don't know if you're being rude or just don't know how to communicate well with other humans, so I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and assume the latter.",0EGcfhNVExKWsK4XpOanPA,1,0,2,ow7yEvY2XegKCUZT7lIjVg

Although, I have decided not to come here any longer.

I have mixed views about this place. For one thing, a lot of people who frequent this casino just don't have any sense of fashion. Second of all, and this is a big complaint, at the Sportsbook, you can't have a seat and catch a game without feeling that you're sitting besides a homeless person who hasn't showered in a month. For some strange reason, it appears sports bettors are not given priority in being able to sit first. I'm very social and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but come on, the lack of personal hygiene of your fellow man can be repulsive.

Now there are positives. The dealers are pretty cool, the pit bosses are very welcoming and some even greet you with a smile. The buffet and restaurant cafe are found upstairs, and I would not recommend eating at the cafe at all, it just takes too LONG for them to take your order and bring your food, totally not worth it. The casino floor is well laid out and small to navigate so for the few cuties that stop in once in a while in high heels, it shouldn't be an issue. There is plenty of parking close by so step out, grab your ride and go to your next spot.

     I have been coming here on & off for over 20 years since it was Terribles.  It has SO much going for it:  location,  a good staff and a great pool . The new  ownership has put a lot of money into improvements,   yet  simple problems seem to haunt this place.

Casino . Great promotions, the corona bar was small but friendly and they have a  super S1.99 bloody Mary -good quality and the happy hour at the bar had really good tacos 2 for $3.00.  But  depending on where you are in the casino the ventilation is still lacking and in places none existent.  I had to leave because I got a headache from the smoke. 


  FOOD.  it has some of the best food deals to be had near the strip and people come here for the food . I found the buffet for $5.99 at breakfast to be an especially good deal with made to order omletes , fresh fruit and carving ham - very tasty.  The staffing issues at the Sterling Spoon Cafe is a bummer. I visited at 3 pm.
      
 For example, Wednesdays the casino offers some great promotions called Nifty Fifties , all day on Wednesdays anyone over 50 eats for half off in the cafe, great deal but  I waited over 40 minutes in the Sterling Spoon Cafe after being seated.  My order was finally taken but then the server had to come back to tell me that they were out of the entree I had ordered. ( I left at that point)
     There was only 2 servers for 18 tables. , The very nice waitresses were exceedingly overwhelmed and the was a lack of communication btwn the seating hostess and the servers

POOL.  This COULD  be one of of the best pools in Vegas. Well it is .... because hardly anyone knows about it ...  Leaving it to be one the the nicest  little known oasis of a pool in Vegas. 

   ROOMS. ,The rooms are nice one of the best deals in Vegas. Affordable and recently remodeled you can get a room here for around $45. AND that includes a FREE SHUTTLE to and from the Airport.
   Oddly they have combined the player club and hotel desk INTO ONE LINE so that you have to stand in line to check in or out behind everyone who wants to go to the players club.  

So.... If you are willing to wait in line at the hotel check in and at the restaurant and can dodge the smoke bombs... then you too can score one of the best rooms and 
 food values to be had near the Vegas Strip.",yInuq2-D-87ZElrJUFYalg,5,1,3,HwCVonlNbKDrYqTpQGasVA

This time I decided I would book a hotel room thru Expedia. I had spent a couple of days reading a lot of review on different hotels. I came across Silver Sevens and thought they have a sweet rate! Most of the reviews were not that very helpful to me but hey! the pictures of the hotel looked nice and everything seemed so convenient for the reasons below.

1. Cheap rate 2. A $9.99 daily resort fee verses $20.00 3. $100 deposit verses $200 and up 4. Convenient restaurant located upstairs 5. located about 2 miles from the strip 6. Free shuttle to the airport and strip 7. Pool and jacuzzi 

Let me tell you that our room was nicer then expected. The room was clean. I always examine my  sheets for stains and they looked clean. The AC blew really cold air.

I do have to mention something that really bothered me, my son was apparently followed by a young hispanic man that asked him for $20 dollars, my son politely told the gentleman no and he walked away. Through out the day my son noticed this same man following him through out the casino and it made him nervous, so he walked over by security until the man left. On Friday morning going to pick up my son from the airport these two ladies were standing outside the casino and asked me to give them a ride home and persisted, I had to tell them no about three times, eventually I had to just walk away. I know its a local casino but the security needs to be more alert with the harassment of others. On Saturday night a older black man approached me saying he lost all his money and do I have $20 dollars, mind you while asking me for money he had money hanging out of his front pocket, once I told him no and looked at him with disgust he then went and ask another man by the bar for money, this man set him straight and then came over and checked on me. He was just another guest that was concerned if I was ok, not security!!!!! But to top off the weekend my son was followed again on a different day, so worried again not knowing what was going on he stepped out to the pool area where this man approached him he was security and began to question my son asking him if he is a guest or not, telling my son that he smelt weed. Once my son verified with security that he is a guest by asking his room# and of course my name the security apologized. Where was security when me and my son was approached by strangers asking for money? where was security when two people out front are asking their guest for rides? As far as my room I thought it was nice and fairly priced, but I did wake up on Thursday morning with three small bites on my face and I know it was bed bugs, I hope none caught a ride with me back home, then I will be really upset. My room key was demagnetized, dam near everyday we had to get new keys but that's not a big deal to me. Cant wait to go back again, just please no bed bugs and security please tell the difference between guest and locals. I won a little, keep me playing but nothing to take home.....sad face

I do like Silver Sevens and I would come back again. I would like to mention three people but only remember two names. Two servers in the Cafe James, he served us late on Thursday night, awesome guy, called us by our names, laughed and joked with us. Saturday morning at the cafe I think his name was Hector (forgive me if Im wrong) but he also was our server and he was a breath of fresh air, very kind, respectful. The other was one of the waitresses I know her if I see her, but she was the best!!!!!!. I teach customer service and its a big part of any organization or business and Silver Sevens employees the ones that I encountered had great customer service, from check in to check out and all in between.",zaBL9ZDo65k0afpnp2gDXA,0,0,4,wDCltJ-woZleTVyd3ENpuQ

The four separate individuals who attempted to serve us got very confused as to who was handling what and as a result I never got a refill for the table's sodas/beers or got a chance to ask for things like ketchup or jam and we ended up grabbing them off other dirty tables nearby. 

When my server-one of them- came for our drink orders, I asked what beers they had on tap. she told me none, so I asked for the bottled beers list. She answered ""I dunno, Bud Lite, Budweiser, there's a lot."" She literally threw up her hands and shrugged. She did not know how much it was a beer and said ""Something like that,"" when we asked if it would cost more or less than $5. It was like pulling teeth, it's a shame that these people have jobs when there are way less lazy homeless people out there. 

I ordered eggs over easy which came fully cooked in the center and were served with cold bacon and rye toast. The toast came out well. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which is pretty tasty, but the check was dropped with the meals and no one offered us refills despite the fact that my boyfriend made a point to ask twice. We wanted to get dessert and split the check, but it seemed like they really, REALLY didn't feel like up selling that day. 

We flagged someone down finally to order dessert, got gross mushy apple pie which they claim is made fresh every day. Well, I've had better pie at McDonalds. It was gross and if they are really baking these fresh they should stop now and invest in some Sara Lee frozen crap because it's better tasting than their pie.

My buddy picked up the check rather than try to get these geniuses to split the check properly. I've never even seen such an I-Don't-Give-A-Crap attitude from someone at work before. There are people who are unemployed who would love an opportunity to give great service and get a good tip, but the people employed at the Silver Sevens cafe clearly don't care at all.

It was my first time not staying on the strip, so I was a bit skeptical wondering about price and location, but for $60 bucks a night on a Saturday (plus taxes and the surprise resort fee of $11...about $85total), I felt it was worth it. My biggest element I look for in a hotel is a comfy bed and somewhat modern appeal in the rooms. The Silver Sevens totally had both. I was surprised by how nice the decor and cleanliness of the room was. I felt for the price, that it was worth it because anything on the strip would have been well over $100 for a Sat night. It's not too bad of a walk  to the strip - probably about 15/20 minutes each way or a short cab ride away. It was hard to hail a cab on our walk so be mindful to call one or if you want the exercise the walk is definitely do-able. The Hard Rock Hotel is across the street and there were lots of restaurants around - PF Changs, Lawry's etc. I've seen this hotel listed for $30 a night and would definitely book it again at that cheap price!

Cons: 
No comforters on the bed - I thought it was strange, but the bedding only had 1 blanket and a top sheet over it...maybe it's a summer thing? It got cold with the air on, so ask for another blanket.

Tolietries - I would suggest bringing your own shampoo's and soaps. Very tiny soap bars and the seemed stingy with the towels - we only got 1 big towel in our room and had to call for another. 

No iron - my boyfriend needed to iron his shirt and it took 45 minutes for someone to come bring us an iron and board because they were short staffed. They didn't really seem to care at first, but after our 5th call to the front desk they finally did something about it. 

Air quality - the air quality in this hotel is poor. It does not have a strong filtration system like the major hotels do. Totally smells like a weird dirty casino a bit, but it's not unbearable. 

Coffee Maker - no coffee maker in the room, I guess they give that in the suites...seems funny...so be ware morning coffee drinkers, lol.

No drinks? - We drove from CA and totally wanted a cold drink, but there was only one tiny bar open and it was filled with people sitting at the bar playing digital poker games...it's definitely not a hotel with ""options"" as far as multiple lounges, bars, restaurants inside. The Cantina bar was closed. 

Pros: 
We enjoyed the Sunday brunch buffet - $10 bucks a person with unlimited champagne was worth it",MJRGWGyiscqciyIMK9DZKQ,3,0,3,MwYI7IZDuv3O9MTuW2venw

I booked a room here for just one night because I was getting in around 2 am and just needed a place to crash until I could check into my room at MGM. This is going to be a long review but keep in mind all of the events that took place at this crack shack of a hotel happened in 3 hours. While walking with my sister and cousin to our room a guy comes out of nowhere and starts walking very fast until he catches up to my cousin who was walking about 10 feet behind us due to her poor choice in footwear. (HOTEL TIP: if you do have to stay here wear running shoes!) This man gets in the elevator with us and goes to our floor. When we get out of the elevator he goes to the first room and starts pretending like he is trying to get his room key to work. My sister noticed that something was not right with him and told me she thought he was following us. so I grabbed my mace and looked in the hallway to see if this freak is still out there and low and behold he is at the door next to ours pretending to use his key! I called security not sure what happened but we never saw him again. So pretty sure we just barely avoided being raped or robbed so that was good. Feeling anxious about what had happened I needed a drink to get to sleep so my cousin and I go to the casino for a bit then start back for our room. Walking down the hallway we notice a guy holding the elevator open but nobody getting in or out... weird. Once we get to the elevator we see another man inside watching a girl scrambling to stuff a back back full of little wadded up pieces of toilet paper that I'm assuming are stuffed with meth due to the meth scares all over her face... could have also been crack not sure. They grabbed the backpack without zipping it up and book it for the exit. Omg. Whatever we are from marysville California so seeing crackheads is no big deal. We go to bed and leave first thing in the morning. This all happened within three hours so I think it's safe to say that the hotel knows this is a common occurrence and still have no security!!!! They do not care to waste their money on security to keep their guests safe. They don't care if people are in their hotel trapping as long as they are getting paid! Spend the extra $10 to stay at the flamingo! It was smelly and there was vomit on the floors but I can't even write a bad review about that when I was assuming it was going to be a little grimy because of the price. I actually feel a little bad because the front desk and bartenders where very nice but this is not a customer service complaint. This is an ownership complaint. I'm not bougie, I'm not naive, I know most of Vegas is people doing drugs and trying to get laid and I don't care. They mind their own business and the casino hotels are packed with security so I feel safe enough. Not this place, this was some next level stuff! When we were packing up to leave I notices the coupons they gave me included one for 20% off my next stay and I couldn't stop crying I was laughing so hard! You couldn't pay me to come back to this sad sad little hell hole. I'm begging you to spend the extra $10! Don't come here! Stay away! If the owner deletes my review again I'll report this business to the BB. People deserve to know the truth. Now I understand why this place has such good reviews. They delete all the bad ones!!!",RhG_3GYD31eMB790tdLX9Q,2,0,1,MHgQMyYKGSooZkDt2r5Deg

1778467,2014-07-04,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"Stayed here for 3 nights.  Here's a real quick breakdown:

Pros:
Clean and spacious room
Decent pool, deepest it goes is 4.5 ft I think.
Shuttle to the strip 4x a day, but that's also a con.

Cons:
TV didn't work
No fridge in room
Distance from strip
Thin walls.  Our experience was we could actually hear someone snoring in the next room.
Few people working the front desk, which means longer waits.


We stayed here to try and save some money, but ended up paying more for taxis anyway (and who doesn't love getting Vegas history lessons from taxi drivers?), so next time we'll just stay somewhere on the strip.  It's just more convenient and I would advise you to do the same, unless you're driving.

Boy was I wrong. The rooms are very big and updated! Love the theme! I felt I was at the beach with the color schemes. The only reason I'm not giving this rating 5 stars is because the size of the bathroom and the nosies the toilet made once it was flushed. The size of the bathroom was very small.

There is a constant stench of cigarettes and air freshener because the carpets/furnishings haven't been updated in probably 20 years. The casino is filled with outdated games, the smoke is inescapable,  and the layout is horrible...no indoor stairwells, terrifying and smelly elevators are the only option. It is most definitely NOT a 3.5 star hotel...I would say that 2stars is generous. It's a step BELOW a Super 8 or a Days Inn.

The rooms are disappointing.  Clean-ish, yes, but gross carpet, gross showers, no in room ammenities such as coffee, ironing boards, safe, fridge, etc. The rooms are simply: beds, lamps, a desk, phone, and a/c. There is a tv, but the cable is really poor quality and only a few channels.

They almost made me miss my flight because their shuttle driver was nowhere to be found, even though I had booked the shuttle well in advance, and they refused any responsibility for their driver's/employee's absence and I was forced to take a cab...which they refused to comp. The whole reason I needed the shuttle was because there was no money for a cab. Thanks to this, I no longer have money to eat with during my day long voyage home. 

The only positive points about this hotel are: its cheap (unfortunately in all the wrong ways as well as price), the drinks are cheap, and the restaurant has a decent buffet.

The vibe is quite off putting and so is the STRONG stench of cigarette smoke... I always felt as if it masked my perfume even for hours later... BUT it is a budget hotel and casino in Vegas...

The rooms are basic; no fridge or coffee maker but the bed quality isn't the worst. 

The fire alarm BLARED for what felt like a continuous 30+ minutes... startling us awake- half naked- scrambling to grab what we could. FALSE ALARM... and no one had the decency to tell us except another couple of guests. GR.

It's located a little off the strip so on our last night we thought we'd go back and gamble/drink a little in the casino so we could return easily and safely to our room. We spent a bit of money on the machines but had a harder time receiving service for drinks... 

There is a complimentary shuttle to the airport but it only goes every hour from the hotel and 20 past the hour from the airport. I either misunderstood or was misinformed but at the end of the day, we had to book a uber because we were 4 minutes past 10am and it had already left.

I am returning to Vegas this summer for a friend's wedding but I think I'll book somewhere on the strip that can provide a little more quality and a better location, even if it means spending a little more.

Only 11 tables there in the little restaurant area which is overflow to the buffett and cafe if needed. WHen we walked in (we were the first ones there as it opened) we were asked by the sassy hostess if we had a reservation. When we replied no, that we tried to make a reservation online and couldn't, she only replied ""operator"" like we were schoolchildren.
Apparently this is a popular spot for the elderly, as we were the youngest diners in the room during our hour and half stay (and I'm mid 40's). The one waitress knew most of the patrons by name and was a little to casual to us for my liking for the ""upscale"" prices and ambiance this restaurant was supposed to have. Butter tasted terrible for the bread, the filet had NO flavor to it and my friends beef was overcooked. We ordered the French onion soup and it wasn't a regular french onion soup, don't know how or what they did to it, but you basically had to put the bread in the soup after it was brought to you and so no cheese on top of the bread baked on.
There came a sauce with mushrooms on all beef selections and that was not specified in the menu OR by the waitress. It wasn't very good. I would have liked to have been told that it comes with a mushroom sauce ON the steak. 
We were offered a free dessert due to my friends steak being overcooked and the dessert of Creme brûlée tasted frozen and cold on top, and runny on the inside.

When arriving to the location it had many places to go from gas stations to a CVS and restaurants down the street. Make sure to use a car though, because it's freaking hot out at this time. Anyways outside looks nice but going inside it's just like a regular casino but not a huge one either. 

When checking in they had only two people in service to our help. Which made the line and wait longer. What can you do but patient right? Going into the hotel there is a gift shop with some food and drinks, but the hotel is sketchy itself.it only had one elevator so if you have multiple people then you might just need to take the stairs or wait till the elevator is empty again. 

The rooms are decent and have the old atmosphere. Where the air condition is one of those old boxes. The bathroom is decent and the room itself is decent.

2196373,2015-05-22,1,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"Eh... I'm rounding up from what really is a 2.5 star review. If you really need a lower cost hotel, it's a weekend where there is a big event in town or a holiday weekend and you forgot to book something till the last minute, or everywhere else just has crazy prices (both true in my case) then this hotel is alright for a night.

It's not far from the Strip, so that's a plus. But the casino is old and smokey, the halls are smelly and dirty (we saw someone's leftover room service outside of their door all day, night, and into the next morning), and there are lots of people using it as an extended stay motel- full families with cribs.

We were able to get an updated room, and it was actually pretty decent, aside from the bathroom, which did not look like it got the benefit of the update. The shower didn't have fantastic water pressure, but at least the water got hot enough. Beds were just fine.

If you meet the above criteria, then Silver Sevens is ok, and you could do worse. In other circumstances, you're better off booking elsewhere.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,3,1,3,6QDOx2qwGzDrU13tQsLRiA

I had to wait 45 mins to get the casino card. Only 1 staff was working and she was as slow as snail. No smile , no greetings. She was rude to all the people in line and was telling to hurry up to elderly people as they were taking  little longer . That was rude.

2233068,2016-06-09,2,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"A truncated review. This year my January sojourn was split because after my first two nights at Silver Sevens I was comped a room at my convention hotel. My loyalty only goes so far.

The usual fine service and accommodating personnel were in evidence, including the free safe-deposit box at the always-open, always-friendly cashiers cage, the safest place on the property. 

Although I was staying at the convention hotel (no reason to hide it, it was the Hard Rock) my frugality drew me back to Silver Sevens' Sterling Spoon Café for Deuces Wild breakfasts and half-pound burgers whenever I was hungry. The five-minute walk is good exercise, the food is good for the constitution, and the check is good for the wallet. 

With the Summer travel season upon us I'll be back. Silver Sevens is my go-to Vegas lodging. 

NOTE: As a regular customer and reviewer I have received some comp room nights in the past. As I only used two of my five planned room nights I don't think I got a comp on this trip. No matter.

The only promotion for new players was $5 slot play. The had some newer machines but a lot were older and I had trouble getting my free play to work on them.

2248590,2014-07-13,9,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. By far the worst experience I have ever had in Vegas. 

Typically hotels in Vegas are known for being extremely catering to their guests. This was not the case. Plus the whole hotel looks like absolute crap filled with the scummiest people. 

Next, my room was absolutely filthy. There were piss stains running down the toilet to the ground, it also smelled like someone died in my room. The bed felt like I should have brought a black light and possibly a hazmat suit. Best part about my room was the AC actually working, but the shower/tub looked like someone had just washed their cars undercarriage in it. The towels felt like sand paper and were barely large enough to be considered bath towels....more like hand towels. Getting a cab is nearly impossible since no where does it say you are required to tell the front desk to call a cab or just call it yourself, since they don't employ someone at the entrance to wave cabs for you. Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.

Lastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.

After all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.

If I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass. 

In the end I feel like I got raped for my hard earned cash just so I could save a little. Definitely learned my lesson and going to spend the extra cash to stay at a real hotel next time.",zSqMbeNZXI-qippJ_vLmfw,3,0,1,LZhBVX5InaovoMsg5ZMBLg

I thought of giving the place a chance. It is not on the strip. It is close to a CVS, however (so you can save on drinks). The room is spacious, and looks decent at first glance. But when you compare it to what you can get if you book ahead of time, it's not worth it.

Cons:
Towels are stiff, not soft and plush
Shower looks like any other tub in a house. 
Shower head is cheap. 
Tiny bathroom! I am sub 5'6"" and I felt cramped!
The bed is way too firm, yet it sinks. Woke up sore.
AC is loud as heck. Wakes you up when it turns on. 
Far off the strip to walk. Either drive, or get an Uber/Lyft/Taxi.
Parking is not covered. If you care about your car, you'd dread leaving it in the sun like me. 
Hallways smell like smoke, yet rooms are smoke free. Worried about getting charged for smoking in the room, when I've never smoked in my life. 
Elevator felt and sounded like it was going to fail and trap me. 

Pros:
Spacious room.
Internet is available (3.5 Mbps Download, 1 Mbps Upload when I tested it).
TV, but limited channels.
Cheap room service, but I can't speak for the quality of the food
At least you aren't out in the sun.

2 night stay, room 309 on 8/05-07

 Pros:
-$50 a night
-free drink vouchers
-less than a 5 minute drive to the strip
-room was clean....ish
-room had a slight remodel
-even though it was near an airport, I really didn't hear planes taking off or coming in
-no bed bugs! (At least in 309)

Cons:
-rooms sheets had what I hope was red lipstick smeared on different parts of them
-a/c was 50x louder than the airport
-walls had some shoe prints marks 
-our non-smoking room still had a lingering smell of cigarettes
-bathroom floor felt hella flimsy

Overall, I feel like this saying ""you get what you pay for"" is exactly what this hotels slogan should be. You shouldn't expect five star service from this lower end hotel. The employees gave off the same essence as the hotel.

The kicker is there was not ONE ATM that worked on the floor I checked 6 and all of them said disabled or ATM not working.  That is awful....how can you gamble if you can't get any money?  I asked a floor person if they knew where there was a working ATM?  She pointed to some of the ones  checked but after I told her those were broken..she walked away and disappeared.

I recall it being one of the first properties I visited on my first trip to Vegas a decade ago, so I'll always be fond of it.

The buffet was excellent, and the mainstream restaurant kicked out the biggest slabs of prime rib I think I've ever had.  

The little convenient store in the middle of the casino was always good about letting you pay for merchandise with comp points/dollars.  There always seemed to be a huge selection of beer available for it being a convenient store.

I had a one night stay in one of the standard rooms in the original tower, ground floor.  It seemed to be a step up from a Super 8 or maybe an Econo Lodge, but nothing too extravagant.  My stay was comped, but I've seen very good pricing here if you're paying for rooms.  I've heard that the newer tower and the jacuzzi suites are a bit nicer.

The check in desk area was a bit convoluted, as it seemed to be right smack dab in a corner of the mainstream casino floor.  Usually best to leave your bags in the car until after check in to avoid the madness.

There have always been a good amount of local patrons in the casino, many with interesting stories to tell.

Definitely worth considering if you're looking to stay near the Strip without paying high prices (it's within walking distance), and it's directly across the street from the Hard Rock.",56QSLA3M13Xk1YQ0pXa5tg,3,1,4,PK65rAp6i5p8vd15BzgNZg

I came here for two reasons. One was to check out their $7.77 special in the Sterling Spoon Cafe which consists of Half a Rack of Ribs and 10 hot wings which sounds like a good deal. The second reason was to go check out a comedy show on the same floor.

As we leave our car in the parking lot, we make our way to the front entrance. Just right before that there is a drop off section for cars to go through. Watch out for idiots that are not paying attention for you might get run over. The exhaust from cars passing by was overwhelming. Since it was really hot outside, we were happy to enter an air conditioned building. Not.

As soon as we walk in, we were literally ran into a wall of cigarette smoke from all the smokers playing at the tables and slots right as you enter. I take back the overwhelming exhaust from outside for the smoke inside was an understatement. 

After eating at the cafe and watching the comedy show, I just wanted to get out of there before I contracted lung cancer. Memo to new owners of this place. You may have changed the name but the sickening environment is still the same. I literally had to keep my windows down in my car as we drove home so I can try to get the cigarette smoke off of my clothes.

So for those of you that are in search of good food deals, this is not the place for the mediocre food does not make up for the health hazards that you are exposed to. Defintiley not coming back to this piece of dump establishment. Based off of this, I can only imagine how horrible the hotel rooms might be.

It is only a mile or less off the Strip and is cheap.  Rooms are clean so nothing to complain about and they have a pool.  We stayed in the suite and it was huge.  Two rooms, two tvs, fridge, wet bar, two bathrooms, and a jacuzzi.  Free Internet also.

About $110 per night for three people, what a deal! However, this casino is not near the Las Vegas strip. I had to Uber to the strip every night. At least it's pretty quite, that's good. The customers here aren't really the type of people you want to gamble around with. Think about Vegas and people you don't want to gamble with, you know what I'm talking about.

I lived at the 5th floor. The elevator felt like it's ready to drop any second. The worst part was that my room door broke on my first night here! What a fucking luck, should I gamble more with a luck like that???!!!

Anyway, I had to go all the way down to change my key cards, all three of them. The front desk lady told me that my phone had disabled the magnets of the keycards. I didn't believe anything she said though, because I've travelled lots of places, stayed in lots of hotels, handled lots of keycards, and this doesn't happen much, except in Motel 6 sometimes.

I was right, it was the lock that's broken. I went all the way down again, almost sucker punched some gamblers here. Other front desk girl (very nice) called a maintenance guy to help us out. That guy came up, tried the door with his key, still didn't work. 3 a.m. in the morning, standing in the hallway, and teaching my mom to never be cheap again... and also writing a review on Yelp... Great fucking memory.

What I have to compliment is the maintenance guy. He barely speak English, but he's a hard worker. He accidentally broke his finger and started bleeding. But he kept doing his job and didn't complain about anything. He couldn't make too much noise because it was midnight already. This guy deserves a raise, a promotion, or even better, he deserves a job in Caesars Palace! We gave him a bandage in the end.

After seeing this maintenance guy, I became more patient and changed my attitude for this whole thing, especially when he proposed to switch us to the 'Mega Room'! But no, they gave us another room on the 5th floor, and we all lost one hour of our sleeping time.",0U72HY-r2didt1EkpArdlQ,2,0,2,erAvpFGoUU1ws5VFFp_goQ

I have spent a great deal of time in and out of this casino over the years since moving here. It is small and very smokey. That would probably be one of the greatest strikes against this place is the low ceilings and crappy ventilation are horrible if you're a non-smoker. After a little while in this place, your clothes will reek of smoke!

Upstairs on the second level they do have a bingo room(never tried). They also have a buffet and a cafe. I tried both of these when it was still Terrible's, so I don't think it's fair to review them until I have a chance to try it under the SS banner. 

I also stayed in the rooms when it was under the Terrible's banner. I know that they built the new tower in 2009 and those rooms are much nicer than the older ones. The older ones have been around since the early 80's and definitely show  their age.

They have a William Hill Sports book inside, for your race and sports betting options, replacing the former Lucky's book that was there before.

The employees are hit and miss. I have come across some of the friendliest people here, and also some of the surliest. Just depends...


I like the fact that they re-branded the place and are at least making an effort to make the place a bit better. Plus I like the whole Corona Bar idea, as well!

I think housekeeping could do a better job as the place looks like it could use a good deep cleaning but for the price, I could deal. 
My favorite thing had to be the pool. This was my first time staying off the strip and I wasn't sure I'd enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas but the pool area was so relaxed and clean and the casino area was great. 
The restaurant upstairs has an amazing BLT and prompt service and the gift shop is very reasonably priced! The have a great assortment of items so you don't have to go far to find what you need.

They could have easily put the bathroom door in a different place so as to include the sink and extend the size, but they didn't. The bathroom itself is ridiculously tiny. The door opens inwards into the bathroom, and it almost reaches the tub (which is against the parallel wall), that's how tiny it is. You barely have room to change clothes behind the bathroom door (which is necessary when staying in a room with 2 other people). The door opening inwards into a tiny bathroom also makes it really hard to get in and out. 

There are really rusty and bulky metal fixtures that I assume are sprinklers in case of fire. They look gross.

I just read two reviews saying this place has roaches, and really wish I hadn't because now I feel grossed out and creepy crawly. I have yet to see any, but will update this review if I do.

They only give you two fairly flat pillows per bed, and no extra blankets.

Now for the slightly redeeming qualities, and reasons why I'm giving a 2 star rating as opposed to a 1 star:
There's ""free"" (free in quotes because of resort fee) wifi in the rooms, and so far it's been decent. 
The pool is pretty nice, but freezing in the beginning of November. I feel like they could have heated it a bit, but that's just me being picky. The area around the pool is really nice. 
The jacuzzi hot tub in the pool area is nice. 
There is 24/7 pizza (which was good) and other good food (I also had the pancakes which were good).
The beds are pretty firm, but I like that.
The staff so far has been pleasant, but I admittedly haven't dealt with them that much. 
The mirrors and sink counter are nice. 
The air condition seems to work. 
I met a couple nice people by the pool today. 
The lamp on the bedside table has an outlet so I can easily lay in bed and charge my phone while using it (lol).

Really this should be 1.5 stars, but I tend to round up because a 1 star rating to me says that there was nothing good about the place, and that's not true. But there is definitely WAY more bad than good.",6YHGwlpjkZZF75g9M9HZnw,2,0,2,ekPsUCXz9qyGE_21YWZ8lw
3263802,2014-10-28,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"We stayed here a year and a half ago when it was Terrible's. There have been some major improvements and one back slide. In general, it is a great value.

Improvements:
     They took my suggestion and install an electrostatic/ozone air cleaner. The casino smells much better. Give it a while to work it might even get good.
     The breakfast buffet is great! Practically no way to improve.

Backslides: 
     The furniture in our room was lacking. Last time there were two comfortable lounge chairs. This time there was one dining room chair.

Pros:
     Very convenient. Parking 20 feet from the door.
     Great room prices (even with the Resort Fee).
     Nice exercise equipment.
     ""Gift shop"" is more of a General Store: Alcohol, Pizza, Gifts, Toiletries, etc.
     Almost forgot to mention the pool. Sustainable while still being stunning.

Tip:  Ask about the pool side rooms with a private patio.  Well worth the upgrade. Next time we might go further and try a suite.",9RcLzAko9QZ_Zj1kc0P4_g,2,0,4,sngC71T6xTUnEGwNiJig-w

I needed an early day room to sleep in while on a long, 6 hour layover while travelng to san diego from Michigan - and therefore booked the room at 7am on the day of arrival. I did this after calling the hotel to verify that I would be able to check in early.  I was told that housekeeping came in at 9:30 and they would give me the first available room.  

After arriving at the hotel at 9am I was told by the SAME PERSON that I had spoke ot on the phone that i could not check in until 3pm which would be after my connecting flight anyhow.  In addition I would be charged an early check in fee and the resort fee, bringing my $25 hotel room up to about $70 to be in it for a few minutes before going back to the airport. 

As these options were completely useless, I returned to the airport after paying non refundable $25 on travelocity plus $30 round trip in taxi fees only to have absolutely NOTHING in return.  I slept in an airport chair for 4 hours on my layover instead.

3577092,2017-09-09,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"All things considered, this is not a great place, but there are some good things about it.  I'll review the casino itself, food, and then the hotel.

First off, let's review the casino proper.  A decent number of games, some are spaced oddly where things can get pretty cramped if busy, though.  You see the usual things out of having a player's card... you'll get some free rooms, freeplay, and dining credits.  They have a lot of promotions like most of the locals casinos including drawings, point multipliers, and gifts, but they need to do a much better job of posting rules somewhere.  

The big gripe with the casino is that the clientele is less-than-savory.  Silver Sevens is located within a stones throw of Hard Rock and Tuscany, both of which attract better patrons.  I've only been here maybe 5 times and I've seen multiple pimps, couples in the bathroom stall together, and people smoking in the bathroom (illegal in Nevada) while employees were in there and they said nothing. I've been in line at the cashier while a lady behind me was clearly strung out on some drugs, and I've seen people totally sloshed while the cocktail waitress continued to serve them (I'm pretty sure this is illegal).  

I was playing video poker over by the sportsbook bar and there's this really disgusting older Korean couple who keep jumping between machines every 2 minutes which was really annoying.  He smoked like a chimney and would either let the ashes drop on him or he'd flick them on the floor.  He won some drawing and I saw him do it while employees were right there and they didn't say shit!  I could maybe understand if he was some high roller, but the guy was playing quarters.  Fucking disgusting degenerate gamblers.

As for the food, it can be hit or miss.  The cafe actually has pretty good food.  Burgers, wings, crispy pork sandwich, etc. all are good.  Breakfast is good there too, and if you get biscuits they are almost a carbon copy of KFC biscuits (a good thing, in my opinion)!  The only downside is that the waiters/waitresses tend to be a bit odd.  I was chastised by one for not finishing everything I ordered, yet another started complaining about how the place has gone downhill since they switched ownership and her hours/benefits were cut.  Also, the service can sometimes be slow, but that's more the fault of the kitchen than the waiters.  The only other place to eat here is the buffet.  Dinner buffet is a little depressing in terms of options, but breakfast buffet on the weekends is quite good.  Staff at the buffet are nice and usually quick, mainly because I never saw more than a dozen people at the buffet any of the 2-3 times I've eaten there.

Lastly, the hotel.  I booked a room and was told I had a certain type of room.  When I went to check in, they said they no longer had that room.  The front desk guy just kind of laughed about it like ""Oh yeah they said you'd get that but ..."".  I also asked for a smoking room but there were no ashtrays there.  I asked the front desk and they said they'd have someone bring some over.  Nobody ever came with the ashtrays so I had to jack some from the casino.  The room itself was ""adequate"".  On the outside the place looks OK, but when you really start digging around you won't be happy.  A really messed up tub that had lumps in it, bent shower curtains, rust on anything that was metal (towel rack, sprinkler).  TV options are severely limited.  I don't even think there was a pad of paper & pen in the room which seems to be standard at literally every hotel.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,2,bNXrWG8Kqn65SQkveF_V3A

The gambling was great!  I swiped my Players card for a bonus $10 for my birthday which totaled $25 in free play.  The five cent video poker machine turned it into $30 cash!  Then I tried the progressive five cent poker machine on the wall. ..hit four aces with a kicker & walked away with $100 profit!

3888139,2014-10-16,1,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"I am rating the Silver Sevens Casino under four different categories:

As a hotel, they get a lowly 2 Stars
As a restaurant, they get a 4 Stars
As a bar, they also get a nice 5 Stars
And as a Casino, they get 3 Stars

First we checked into the hotel late. After a long road trip, I wanted to go to the restroom before heading back out to get some dinner. The toilet was NOT bolted down properly and moved if you sat or bumped into it. The bathroom looked clean but very low budget. The tile was poorly installed but oh well, we're here to drink, eat and gamble in no particular order. As I went to wash my hands the faucet was also NOT bolted down correctly. The bedroom and the sink area were nicer and I must say the beds were very comfortable. They might have gotten a 3 if it had not been for the elevator that took 5 - 6 minutes to go down one floor. Every time you got in the elevator, you knew you may be rescued soon. One guy i bumped into inside the elevator said he comes about every two weeks and half the time it is out of service. 

We did leave the room and go to the Sterling Spoon Cafe. I was expecting their old favorites which were: a rack of ribs, a NY steak or a Sirloin for $9.99 but it has gone up to about $14. They did have a very good breakfast and midnight specials, which I love at Vegas. The food was very good in the Sterling Spoon so we went there for a couple more meals. The buffet did NOT look appetizing so we stayed with the SS.

I wanted to catch the ALCS and NLCS [go Royals since my Dodgers are done] and played a while at the small bar on the NW side of the property. They had a couple of great bar tenders that were fast, courteous and knew how to pour a drink. Met some great people from all parts of the world. Happy Birthday Mike from Sweden and great talk Joe from Costa Rica. This was the best part of the day and even won a little on the machines [before you lose it back somewhere else].

The casino was kind of slow. It was a Tuesday but I made my way over to the craps table and it was quiet. Some guy was losing his shirt and I recognized some of me in him so I stayed away. Played a little at the slots but I not a slots guy. I want to be at a craps table or a BlackJack table. It was a Tuesday again but no action, no real enticement to jump onto a table.

Overall, I like the Silver Sevens since it was Terribles. We go a lot more often to Buffalo Bills, Whiskey Pete's and Primm so the points help us get rooms and/or specials. Now that Terribles is gone,l they seem to be doing a little better. Its still a great value.",5lhisOo609Mymwf9-4MOlA,0,0,4,5heszNQPuWxuLKF3HlDOOQ
3894625,2017-03-16,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"Stayed here while I was in Vegas for a work trip. (My 4th trip to Vegas 1st time staying off the strip) Since there were several big things going on in the area the price of my room was $180 a night and I stayed for 4 nights. I shouldn't complain since my work paid for it BUT.... First night there I got in about 9pm. Like every other comment on here the smoke smell is horrific. They had two different check in lines, one for ""frequent flyers"" Other line for ""Random Joes"" like me. Both lines had 3 people in it, The frequent flyers were helped first which was fine. Shannon was the lady behind the counter and she was super nice and helpful making the long wait irritation go away.  She pointed down a hall way to the elevator and I was on the 3rd floor room 3049. The elevator is not labeled and blends in with all of the other room doors making it hard to find, Got to my room which was suppose to be a King bed and got two queens but that was ok with me. Room was nice, has the basic wear and tear for an older hotel, cracks in the walls, tile, stains on the floor and something gross smeared all over the bottom of the bathroom wall, wifi was free but very spotty. Shower head is super low and hardly any pressure but a shower is a shower.  Next day went to use the rooms blow dryer and it clicked, turned really red and hot and started smoking black smoke. I hurried and unplugged it. Called down to the front desk a lady answered and was super nice, said she would have someone up there shortly to replace it. So I waited and waited until I had no choice but to get to my work event. Came back to the room and had the same dryer so I called down to the front desk and requested it get switched out before the morning, insured it would be switched out I felt relieved. I got a Lyft (Uber but better) to the Strip. Next morning woke up to the same blow dryer. Being a handy lady I unplugged and un-mounted the dryer and took it down to the front desk myself where an older gentleman listened to my safety and fire concerns and insisted I take the dryer back to my room and someone will be up shortly to switch the blower dryer out. Like the day before nobody came. Next day still was not changed out, and to make matters worse after the 2nd day I requested our room to be serviced. Cleaning lady took all of our dirty towels and didn't leave any new ones which was not realized till after the shower, she left all of our dirty dishes from the night be fore's rooms service, oh but don't worry she made our bed. At this point my husband and I were over it. I usually do not leave reviews for anything less then a 3 star, because I like to believe I am patient and I understand that things are forgotten like towels. But Putting my safety concerns on the back burner is not OK. therefor I am leaving this review and its only getting 2 and not a 0 because of how nice some of their staff was, like Shannon and how easy and convenient their gift shop was even though I wished it was open later.  ** I really hope they fixed that blow dryer in room 3049 before someone gets hurt**",yeSNOmd6YWwsROuHX4bIQA,1,0,2,XxMhQf8--gG6v6yOEO_blw
3898356,2016-06-16,2,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,I stayed at this hotel and felt very saddened at my poor choice In accommodations. Upon entering the room there was a foul wet odor that was coming from the air conditioner. I looked at the floor next to it and there was a huge wet stain like someone had spilled something and left it to soak in the heat and cause a foul odor.  After putting down my bags I entered the bathroom with a live roach trying to flip over since he was stuck on his back. I grabbed 3 squares of tissues and tried to flush the roach down the toilet but the toilet was clogged. In fact it clogged 4 or 5 times in the 3 day stay there. I ended up buying a plunger since I didn't want to call the front desk to unclog the toilet for me every time someone peed. Not to mention tip the person that unclogged the toilet every time. I think that this hotel needs to work on plumbing and pests. I can understand its summer and water bugs might start to creep in this was a huge roach. Also was here for a concert and no ironing board or iron in the room and the tv would randomly get darker the longer the tv was on so I wasn't able to stay in room.,hL7r14V5Im_wx-b3kIVJdw,0,0,1,_qbANiIWLiaBZSE3uLN5fA
3918158,2017-02-09,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"We wanted a budget friendly place to stay on the Southeast end of the strip. This place fit the bill perfectly. I always stay at different places in Vegas depending on what I am doing, location, and who I am with. I will admit I was worried about staying here considering the very inexpensive price. However, I would say overall I got exactly what I would expect at this price point and enjoyed my stay here. First of all, the staff here is very friendly and go out of their way to take care of you. I was greeted by Esperanza at the front desk and she was wonderful! She even remembered me and would wave and say hi every time I walked by the desk on my way in and out. The security staff and housekeeping were also great. 
Pros: very budget friendly, great location from strip, large updated rooms, smaller casino so everything is easily accessible, ample FREE parking, large well kept beautiful (unheated) pool area with hot tub, great staff, free coffee coupons 
Cons: paper thin windows made for lots of outside noise, and stained towels
I never ate here so I can't comment on that. I did notice they have some great deals on food though. Overall you can see my pros far outweigh the cons. I would definitely stay here again if it worked for what I needed on that trip.",wrZ81OY3ss8YpWSa4HgIYQ,1,0,4,PexZ9NKa9ZFLMT-eeoIFIA

Affordable prices. ($82/2 nights+$100 deposit-read the fine print, folks...it's there).

My customer service experience at check in was nice. The guy was fast, friendly, and gave good directions. Even complimented my husbands fine beard! (;

Clean room (Non-smoking premium 2 Queen)
Comfortable bedding/bed-pillows be like oh.my.gosh.
Ample parking.
Within walking distance to the Strip (which I wouldn't recommend doing if you're wearing heels) ah, lesson learned. 
Elevator was squeaky and scary...no lie. Flickering lights and all. 

We had 4 people to our room and it was definitely space friendly. Wish the bathroom was slightly bigger, but it was more than accommodating. However, the shower head was very low and water pressure sucked! I specifically loved how many tables we had in the room for all our junk. Plus, a nice wall mirror to assist in getting ready for a night out! 

Aside from the not so pretty view, I would definitely stay here again! 

Side note: This was mine and The Beards first time in Vegas so no comment on this particular buffet, or casino. We wanted to experience all the glitz and glamour the Strip had to offer.",p2ihTq8es6UZKZ9CHFVHzw,2,0,4,u3vCBzwfTdrbJrJvS7i5UA
3946180,2017-02-14,4,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"Arrived here on 2/11 at around 11:45pm. I had forgotten how casinos make you drag your luggage and crap through the blank stares of people having ""fun"", so I made a concerted effort to not make eye contact. I had to look around for anything resembling a front desk, and found some employees by a ""Customer Service"" counter and asked them where I should check-in. They pointed toward the customer service counter, and resumed their ""business"". Thankfully no one was at the customer service counter when I arrived, because I needed the extra time to formulate what I was going to say.... right. Thankfully, after a couple of minutes, a young lady emerged from the back room. 

I booked through Hotels.com, and the thought of getting a solidly reviewed room at $50 a night, filled me with hope. Thankfully, Silver Sevens kicked me back to reality by tacking on a resort fee of $22.49. Vegas: don't worry if you don't spend money on gambling, we'll spend it for you. 

The room (2257; I so wish I was paying more attention, so I could have asked for room 2249...) was decent. Nice beds, desk, night stand, sinks and toilet. The shower head could have been raised about 6 inches (I'm 5'7""), and for tall people, another 3 or 4 inches. I had to duck down to wash my hair. True story. The tub was kind of slick on the feet, and probably could have used a thorough cleaning. 

As is common with hotels, you can hear conversations in the hall, especially when someone is screaming. I didn't really hear anyone in rooms on either side of mine. 

The check-out process was quick, and the attendant was cordial. Note to self, remember to tack on the resort fee and room tax prior to making an educated decision on a 3rd party booking site.",RJrGgtBXkpX2oEHM4hSqXg,7,3,3,_xA9gYbB8HFzKkM9XkA9zA

this place used to be terribles, and I used to enjoy stopping here on my way to other destinations in the southwest. but several annoying things have changed, mostly involving hidden charges:

* no more free wifi!! (it used to be free!) it's now around $5 for 4 hours of wifi in your room. apparently there's some free wifi in one section of the casino, but didn't try it to confirm. I guess they hope you'll buy a drink why surfing the web. 

* they now require a $100 deposit when you check in! they didn't have that before when they were terribles. 

* upon check-in, terribles used to give you a coupon for one free drink (maye even two?!), and some coupons for deals on meals and coffee, but not any more with silver sevens!

* it took 30-45 minutes to get the attention of any drink service while playing the slots. they must have cut the staff - it used to be much speedier. 

* they're now tacking on an unannounced $3 ""resort fee"" upon checkout. they said it's new as of July 2013. I either never paid such a fee in the past when it was terribles OR the fee was included up front in the price. it seems unnecessarily hidden, a ploy to get their price to appear the lowest on Kayak and elsewhere. 

moral: don't trust their lowest price on kayak!

on the other hand, their rooms have been massively updated - new carpets, furnishings. etc. though I kind of liked the scuzzy nature of the old terribles. but then again, the casino itself hasn't been updated and is pretty boring and uninteresting.",NRoYq3aYyQ1JbAu7Y6AEcg,11,1,1,ozZ5N446obMzroNH-Jq37g
4020984,2016-12-31,2,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"OK - so I am TRYING HARD to give this place a chance....

I go into the cafe at 12:30 AM (Late night Friday Dec 30th/early morning Dec 31) - The place has a LOT of tables filled!
We get seated (two of us in the party) and the tables on each side of us are complaining.  Loudly.
Seems they have been waiting a long time to get any service OR get the food they had ordered.
We decided to stick it out...  (STUPID on our part)

Order taken by a waitress who was obviously stressed out about the situation at hand..
FOUR wait staff on the floor - should be plenty for this small restaurant (Using that term loosely).
We noticed since our last visit (which has been sometime ago) that the menu is cut WAY down on selections.   I have worked the restaurant business for 40+ years - I get it - smaller menu, less to worry about and food comes out of the kitchen faster...  HA!

We ordered after a 25 minute wait for our waitress to acknowledge us...  We then sat for another hour and 10 min waiting for our food to cook?  WtH?  We watched as table by table - the cafe emptied with disgruntled people. Some waiting as long as 90 min with no food served.  They got up and walked out..  Table by table - the ""herd"" was thinning...  Wait staff FIGHTING over who was going to tell the customers their food isn't coming out yet - in front of us!

so - where is the MANAGER throughout all of this?   A larger fellow in a rather ill-fitted suit coat kept walking around at about half pace.  His name is Dennis.  AB-SOUL-LUTE-LY CLUE-LESS!!!!!   The wait staff (when I asked why don't you tell your manager) LITERALLY rolled their eyes and threw their hands up in the air saying ""he wont do anything!""  The man didn't come talk to one table!?!?!

Talk about poorly run!  WOW!  I sat and watched $$$$$$$ WALK OUT THE DOOR!  It was amazing to watch.  doesn't anyone in that building CARE about their customers or how to treat them?

When asked why the breakdown in the kitchen - all we got out of the waitress was ""we only have TWO cooks!""

Yes, and???????

The table next to us - who waited 90 min+ - had order three breakfasts.  PANCAKES!  P-A-N-C-A-K-E-S!  how long does it take to make PANCAKES?  NINETY MINUTES?  Seriously?

We finally got our food (cold) had a comp to pay for part of it - and OVER paid for what we got ( in quality of food AND service) - we could EASILY had gone to Ellis Island OR Tuscany OR the Palms and gotten food, eaten, GAMBLED, and left by the time we got our over-priced food at Silver Sevens...

Sad.

This place USED to be a gold mine.  they knew how to take care of their customers AND their staff.

Not anymore.

I suspect the doors will close on this building within a year or two...  It is starting to look and run like the old Continental (the name of the casino before Terribles bought it and cleaned it up) 

 I tried to gamble for 10 minutes after eating - I was approached by TWO homeless guys wanting change.  One of them hit me up twice!   I watched as one of the men unloaded his bag of dirty clothes and God knows what onto a stool at a machine - as he picked through it all - then shoving it all back in the bag - he left the bag tucked between some machines and started his rounds again, begging for change.  Security couldn't be bothered...  Certainly didn't feel ""safe"" in there....  I fear for the employees who HAVE to work inside that building!

Yes, this place WILL CLOSE at this rate - they are chasing off locals AND tourists alike due to their obvious inability to manage and run a casino....

4089988,2016-08-16,1,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"Found this location through an online website quoting me an affordable rate for a hopefully nice 3-day summer weekend in Las Vegas. I'm going to be forthcoming in that I was planning on giving this location two-stars as I'm jotting down all the flaws we encountered.  But I changed my mind because overall, it wasn't that bad.  As the 3 stars claim, it's ""A-Ok"". But it wasn't the best & definitely, definitely not a perfect place. Immediately worth noting--the smoke smell is intense!! I mean, smoking is rampant in Vegas & EVERY casino has cigarette aroma, but this location has weaker ventilation or something.  If you are ultra sensitive about cigarette smoke, I advise you to look at another location other than this one....unless you do what we pretty much did, hold your breathe & run through the casino till you get to your car or to your room. Their TV is on complete input connections lock-down.  That means that you can't hook up a gaming system or console to play video games or even watch movies of your own.  We've never experienced a hotel that did this.  I guess they want to make sure you only purchase their movies.  If you have kids that want to play video games in between exploring the city, you're out of luck at this location.  Two free coffees are available in the gift shop for each hotel booking, but you must ask for the coupons at the Customer Service desk.  They don't remind you or even let you know they're available.  I only happen to see ""free coffee"" on my key attachment and wondered how to redeem it so I asked the front desk.  That's when I was told we'd have to get the coupons every day.  I was put-off by the fact that if I hadn't noticed it was available, I wouldn't have gotten this freebie (& I'm big on freebies).  They also offer ""Free Shuttle to the Strip"", but when my husband asked at the front desk they told him, ""Yes, we take you to The Strip, but you'll have to find your way back.""  WHAT??  That's SO odd!!! We ended up chatting with a lady at the pool/jacuzzi & she told us there are shuttles back, you just have to pay attention to where they are & ask about them.  But why didn't the Customer Service desk tell us that??  SO strange!!  In order to receive restaurant discounts, you must have a Player's card & if you find a coupon in a magazine or something, you have to redeem them at the Front Desk--it's no big deal but it does require possibly going through another line. When we arrived in the room, they only offered a super tiny shampoo and a super tiny lotion.  They didn't even have regular hand soap.  I always have my own, but it just looked weird that they didn't offer their own.  I love getting those little sample-size toiletries.  The second night, we did end up getting small little soaps. I wonder why it wasn't there the first night.  Again, strange.  So, again, why did I give them 3-stars despite all this griping? It was still an overall pleasant stay.  The room was large enough and clean.  It's close (like walking distance) to other eating places like Chipotle, The Habit, Pieology & Panera Bread. The parking is under cover and easy to access to & from the elevator.  The Pool is open early, 7am which is unusual because most pools open at 10am.  The family and I were able to get our swim on in the early morning to avoid the scorching mid-day heat.  We really enjoyed that! So, would we come back?

There really is no reason to gamble your hard earned money away anymore , other than to get comped at their crappy restaurants & as it is , if you do wander  into their restaurants for whatever reason the prices are pretty cheap to begin with, so dropping some cash into their machines is kind of a moot point !  Before there were point multipliers during the week which you really didn't mind dropping a 100$ or so , because you were earning part of your money back in free play , points or could use them to buy beer , cigarettes or crap in the sorry ass gift shop ! But now the only point multipliers are on weekends , which as any local knows , you just stay away from the strip area if you can on fri, sat sun !! I play here out of habit , but like so many others I'm over it !! there are no familiar faces of my fellow locals anymore , it's basically just a rest stop for hookers and other malcontents during the week with the occasional tourist that got rooked into booking a room there!! It used to have a fun vibe , but whoever is running the place now must have a no smile policy , because everyone that works there looks like they hate their job or are looking over their shoulder because they are afraid of getting fired or f@&king up !! I'll still go here every now and again , but for rewards and to drop some of my cash , I'm going over to a few of the other local haunts , where I feel my patronage is appreciated !!",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,0,0,1,yAmOvsMGTp4LJc9eZxhTRA

Probably a good thing that I don't live in Vegas as that rule wouldn't work too good on a daily basis.

I generally play for the amusement of the little bonus rounds. That said, the machines at this casino didn't keep me too amused.  The bonus rounds were really rare. There was this one machine ( pirate Queen- yeah, I know, go figure) that I played $60 and never once hit the bonus. I finally gave up...

My husband and I have been staying here for several years and our last two most recent visits was the worst experience ever. There is a black female with blond hair that works there and she talks back at you, argues with you and when you ask for a manager she seems to have a problem with that. As you're speaking to the manager she's cross talking and making absurd and rude comments towards you. And supervisors and managers have yet to do anything. On our last visit there was an older  gentleman by the name of Joe that actually walked up  behind her and grabbed her by the waist and felt on her butt. People skills are great ass in the only thing I can say is that's good about the casino is the food in the café.

Thursday night, after we checked in, we headed over to the cafe as it was 8 pm and the gift shop was closed (even though it says open til 10pm.) We were hoping to just get something to go but we were informed that we had to sit down and tell the server that we wanted our meal to go. We received our waters and then waited on the server... and waited... and waited. Finally, after NEVER seeing the waitress, we walked out. Hey, at least we got some waters out of the waiting. We ended up driving down the street to get food. 
On Friday morning, I called for a ""do not disturb"" sign from housekeeping as there wasn't one in our room. We then proceeded to the buffet, which was overpriced for stale food. I will say the omelette was fantastic and the inside of the pancake was delicious, you just had to tear off the edge as it was very hard and stale. When we got back to our room, there was still no sign on our door, nor one inside our room. Supposedly, they had just made a note on the housekeeping sheet that we requested no service through our stay. That's cool but it's not a ""do not disturb"" sign. I tried calling housekeeping and got the voicemail, I then called front desk and sat on hold for a few minutes when I finally just got up and went down to the front desk to try to get some answers in person. There was only one agent helping a line of 4 people deep and trying to answer calls while helping guests in front of him. My question is, why didn't he have any help on a Friday afternoon when people are checking in?? Anyways, I finally get to the front of the line and he has to go searching for a ""do not disturb"" sign which, thank God, he found one and gave it to me. I then asked for a shower curtain as we were staying in a handicap room with a walk-in shower and it had the bar for a shower curtain but not one on there. It didn't help that the bolt holding the shower head onto the faucet was loose so it was spraying everywhere. The front desk agent made a note and said he would get a curtain up right away. Two hours later, no shower curtain, and I've had it. We found a maid cart, grabbed a bunch of towels, and put them all over the floor in our bathroom so we wouldn't slip. You would think that would be a concern to the service staff as we could slip and hurt ourselves but, no worries, we'll just fix it ourselves since we can't get service. 
The rest of the stay was great since we didn't have to deal with anyone at the hotel. What a shame that this hotel doesn't have better service though.

-lack of customer service all around.

Because of this I had to pay $60 bucks on a motel until check in time (4pm). 

-gambling here is uneasy. Machines are all old and more often than not it may even break on you. The real challenge is getting service to come help you. 

-rooms are supposedly remodeled but they aren't so modern. Expect something a little better than motel 6 with a dirty bathtub.

This place has a reputation for providing a basic clean room with convenient parking but with no customer service, a terrible gambling experience, and rooms that make you question if paying $10 more for a hotel is really worth it, I can assure you it is.

5067317,2013-11-16,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"So you're looking for a place off the strip where you could find yourself a cheap room for a night or two, a good meal, and maybe a little bit of Vegas fun. Well, when this place was Terrible's Casino you probably could have gotten all that. Located a hop from the airport, close enough to the strip to see some action if you'd like, and a great ""no-frills"" deal for the economy minded or business traveler Terrible's was that. In the past year, though the Terrible Herbst company has drifted away from gambling establishments and sold to Affinity Gaming where Terrible's Hotel & Casino is now the Silver Sevens Resort.

Here's my review of the place when it was Terrible's:
http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=F4_zHEXU1p5E12A2o-5_ZQ&q=terribles

None of this is true anymore as they completely overhauled the establishment. Well, aside from the aesthetics. It's still looks like a Vegas local's spot with a tight casino ground floor and second story loft style area for dining, bingo, and a few more games. It's everything else that has changed.

Dining
One of Terrible's greatest appeals was it's dining deals. There were great $9.99 meal deals that included prime rib and a roasted half chicken. Graveyard specials included $2.99 bacon and eggs breakfast. The buffet at Terrible's wasn't the best but at affordable prices and the frequent BOGO tickets that could be found, the low price trumped the limited selection. These are all but a memory as prices have gone up and having a player's card only gets you $1 off. The graveyard specials are now limited to the single menu item and those wonderful $9.99 are gone completely. 

Hotel
For a reasonable price, Terrible's room were a great deal. On top of those wonderful secret ""resort fees"" that they tack on now (this is everywhere now), Silver Sevens now includes a $100 deposit to any stay! Keep in mind, this isn't just $100 for the room in which they will refund you (usually in 48 hours), this is ON TOP OF your room stay amount that they authorize for. The worst part is that they NEVER tell you this when you book the room. You just show up and they tell you this as you hand them your card and ID. If it's a slow night, be prepared to argue with the front desk supervisor about canceling your reservation without notice, too.

Amenities
Forget it, there are none. Even the WiFi in the rooms are no longer free. Which was a HUGE reason why I would stay there. If you're a gambler, drink wait times are excessive and the pool isn't heated. Can't say much about the room itself because I didn't want to drop the deposit. I will say that the location is great and close to everything. 

My $.02
Silver Sevens is a HUGE disappointment of what used to be a great hidden gem a city that's at the ready to gouge you of all your money. As a former local, I used to enjoy going there because it was a great deal. It was a great place for locals to enjoy some of what their city provides without obligating to the strip. Perhaps Silver Sevens is trying to re-brand and compete for the same market as their neighbors the Hard Rock. I don't know but it seems like Station Casinos or even Sam's Town might be the winner of this.

Giving the ""new"" Silver Sevens a 1 Star for the overall suck of the place now that it's not Terrible's. Which is a huge drop as compared to the 4 Stars I gave it's predecessor.",F4_zHEXU1p5E12A2o-5_ZQ,5,2,1,FdSsG1XZP9q23B_XI3EF6A

(*Skip to the edit to see the end result) I'm on day 1.5 of a three night/four day stay for an event that is using this as the conference HQ.

First the room was clean and fine. Better than motel 6, but not a 5 star high end hotel. I think it's fair for the price TBH. Beds are comfy and no bed bugs (I always check before unpacking). The top sheet situation is a little weird as it's not a fitted sheet so it came undone when I went to pull put the tucked in blanket. Noticed stains on the bed cover but nothing horrific.
The walls ARE thin. I can hear full on conversations in the room next door and children running up and down the halls screaming. I slept fine all night but my event starts late tonight so I was hoping to nap through the day. Other guests in the halls were yelling so nope.
The bathroom is cramped and my toilet paper role fell out. Seems to be missing it's spring?
o
Anyhow room works for sleeping and chilling so it gets a pass.

The lobby is like any casino. Smokey, loud, full of people who look kind of burnt out. I'm not a smoker so I can only last so long, but hey I did win alright at roulette and closed early due to smoke so win for me.

Room service food was fine, prompt, and hot. It's what I expected and the delivery guy was polite.
Buffet food was buffet food. At brunch the lunch items were better than the breakfast items IMO. I did leave because some dude behind me was loudly slurping and chomping with his mouth open and cussing up a storm which was just too obnoxious to chill around.

Staff has all been pleasant. But I always go out of my way to be polite because I get it, this job probably sucks. Dealing with angry and drunk people all day? Pass.

Overall I'd probably stay here again if i had a reason to be in town but my only real complaints are how noisy it is in my room and that I wish there was a third more pricey top tier restaurant in another part of the hotel with super great meals and away from smoke/a-holes. I'm a picky eater.

- There was nothing appetizing at their international buffet. I don't say this much but it was mediocre at best! I do value price vs quality and comparing it to feast which is the exact same price for dinner, feast buffet wins by a long shot. Even Hometown buffet is no match compared to this place. The quality of the food takes first place for being the worst. 
- I didn't bother trying to eat much since almost of their entrees looked unappealing. The prime rib was recooked so many times that there was no longer texture and just felt like mushed meat. Their fresh fried chicken tasted like microwaved banquet. Their soups and gravy had a nice thick coat at the top layer proving it has been unattended for a long time. Haha. 
- I can go on about their tacos, Chinese food and dessert, but their only deeming quality would be their friendly service. Fast drinks. 
- After just getting one plate, I decided not to get anymore. I did try their ice cream machine to make a root beer float but it was a complete disaster. Maintenance was working on a leak that was from the root beer while I was getting my soft serve.

Previously I was at a 5 Star hotel about 30 minutes away and quiet honestly, I wish I had saved my money and stayed here. Don't get me wrong, that hotel was amazing, but I prefer this one for the location and the laid back-ness. The first day we took an uber to the strip and made it there in about 7 minutes. The hotel is also very close to the airport and they have a free shuttle that will take you. My only issue was the smokeyness of the whole building. I think I've got too use to DC where they banned indoor smoking everywhere, so to constantly smell smoke was a little off putting to me. I also was not too fond of the hallways, they were long and dark and the elevators seemed to be placed in the most odd locations. The house keeper never came the second day. The bathroom was very small and outdated. The people who seemed to frequent the casino were a little sketchy and constantly tried to hit on my sister and I (and we both look like freshmen in high school even tho we are in our 20s). Some pros were that, according to my sister, the room service food was delicious. She also liked that it was 24/7 service. I loved the pool area. It was beautiful and relaxing. I went in January so everything out there wasn't open, but I still enjoyed the scenery. 

I appreciate the hotel staff. My aunts flight got canceled and she asked if she could take over my room since I was leaving at 9 pm. I guess she didn't know that she had to ask if she could stay in the room past checkout the next day, but she didn't. When she was ready to check out the next day, around 6pm, she went to try to pay for the extra time she stayed, but they wouldn't let her because the room was still in my name. I called and explained what happened and they ended up saying that she can just go, she doesn't have to pay anything. That was real nice of them.

Well if you sign up for a players card, weekday buffet lunches are only $6.99pp. Then bring in a 2 for 1 coupon in the weekly Sunday magazine, and you got yourself a $3.50pp lunch.  We all know this is not top of line food here, but can you even get a combo at Mickey D's for less than $5 bucks nowadays? Nope. And the cheese is never melted on their burgers!

There were quite a few more than edible items. Ham in the carving station, cowboy stew, machaca, baked chicken, deep fried scallops on skewers (gf went back for thirds on those), plus a decent sized salad bar, fresh fruit (cantelope and honeydew, pineapple, and various canned fruits in syrup).  The small Mexican section even had nopales salad.  One dish to skip is the pork chops though. Dry!

Doesn't ever seem to be a line here. So if you're in the area (great location on Flamingo near Tuscany and Platinum) stop by for a cheap lunch.

To be clear...I am a fan FOR BREAKFAST BUFFET ($8.99 if you have an A-play card)

A-Play card takes about 5 minutes to get...look for the signs or ask security 

I wondered in about 4 years ago on one of my walk abouts in Vegas.  I walk early in the morning and the buffet opens at 7am.  Learned quickly about the card discount and the buffet is varied and extensive with endless coffee/non-alcohol drinks.

I tend to eat healthier and they can accommodate that.  Started with various sliced fruit and had eggs with some baked ham (sliced) ,  They had chicken fried steak, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy, breakfast tacos, various kinds of potato etc etc etc.

Take your time, eat slow...enjoy...its upstairs off escalator on 2nd floor.

Casino is a bit smokey..older casino but if looking to save money...try it...and you WILL come back.

This was my 4th visit...for that kind of money close to the strip...can't beat it.",2gTej1xVoN49nUmi8R4BNQ,1,0,4,P-M_oFfjGo18O1qQM4WCxw
5672032,2017-01-06,4,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"So when I was initially researching a trip to Las Vegas, I had gone onto LasVegas.com I plugged in my desired stay times and sorted from cheapest to most expensive. These guys were at the top....or bottom. For just about thirty dollars a night, I could sleep just a bit away from the the ritz, glamour and noise of the Las Vegas Strip. Awesome. I booked a room with no problems, and eventually I found myself here after a haul from Santa Clarita.
    I easily found the place, and I parked my car in a warm & fuzzy spot within the large and completely free parking lot. Then I crossed the smokey and noisy casino to the check in desk in the back. I was a bit rushed, as I had an hour or so to check in, settle in for a wee bit and then get over to the Neon Museum for my tour. And I wasn't sure where that was....or where I was in relation to it. (turns out just a few miles) 
     The girl at the front desk was quick, friendly, helpful and obviously very proficient at her job. I was checked into the place within a few minutes. I think her name was Ashley? Amanda? Definitely an A name... As I checked in, I was handed a pair of card keys, and a lil card holder filled with coupons. She also handed me a magazine and a map about Las Vegas. Within the lil card holder were coupons for a couple free coffees, a discount at the gift shop, a free virtual scratch game, a discount on my next trip out this way...that kinda thing. I thanked her, she thanked me, and she directed me towards my room.
     I ambled off to my room, and dropped my stuff off. The room was nice. Spacious, and comfortable. The bathroom sparkled, fresh soaps and shampoos awaiting my use. There were arm chairs. There was a desk for writing. The bed was massive. It was a very nice hotel and casino. I cranked the AC, dropped my bags and went back out to continue the adventures for the evening. 
    Over the next few days, this was my home. A welcome respite from the outside world where I could recharge my devices and myself at the same time. One evening I visited the buffet, and for seventeen dollars, it was very welcoming and very enjoyably tasty. Many delicious things were eaten that night. And, I didn't have to drive anywhere.
   The place is across the street from the Hard Rock Casino, and about a mile or so to the self-parking lot for the LINQ Promenade. That parking lot is free and a pretty great place to start your meandering tour of the strip. I had no woes and/or security issues, and felt entirely safe for myself and my vehicle the whole time. 

    While I didn't actually gamble during my stay, I did cross the casino a few times. It was as clean as any of the other casinos. The drink girls wandering around were hot too! It's a small lil casino/hotel when compared with the gargantuan places on the strip. It's nice. Cozy. Everybody I interacted with in the place was a pleasure to be with, and I will most assuredly be staying here upon my next visit to Las Vegas.",43WiflwfTbmjizIfxvQ_jw,4,2,5,HP88AAU2jNfageDeQ0T7Uw

This was the worse experience I've ever had here!!!
Our room was way in the back by the parking lot, ice machine and elevator. The ice machine is very noisy especially at 6 am when someone is filling up the whole cooler. First of all I'm disabled and my mom is elderly and disabled as well. It was such a long walk to our room with our luggage and all. The room even though remodeled in the past few years looked kinda worn down. It definitely wasn't clean! There was hair in the tub and the tub was clearly dirty! The bathroom floor was ridiculously dirty! Yesterday I requested for the room to be cleaned and when we returned to the room the beds were made of course, but the bathroom hadn't been touched. The same hair was there, tub and toilet just as dirty as before. 
There are a lot of very nice people that work here especially a waitress named Kai  but there are also some very unprofessional and down rite rude staff here. 
Very disappointed!",vr-_DPBPom_aFiydvgPpeA,1,0,2,yakNI-n65xbzeC_gjFIjfw

5811713,2015-12-06,1,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"We have stayed in the hotel many times before when it was Terrible's and the rooms were really nice and big and always clean. So I am not sure now that they changed names how they are but we have come to this casino many times over the years and have enjoyed staying here. Had a problem once with someone at the check in but it was taken care of with the manager on charge, 

There hasn't been too many changes we have seen except they are changed the players club location a few times.

We have been to the restaurants here as well. The cafe and the buffet.
If you gamble here you will get coupons to eat for free. We have ate at both places where your glad it was free! (will put review for restaurants on their own page)

When you gamble you will get free drinks as with any casino,
This is a ok casino. It can get pretty busy I think Locals and tourists come here cause it is not far from the strip.The table games get real packed.

Over all the casino is not bad for playing the machines. They do have some neat ones we have played.

They do have a band not sure if it is every night but they are usually pretty good. They do drawings at certain times while your playing on the machines..
If you come here to stay you won't be unhappy with the size of the rooms. We always like how big they were and always asked for a non smoking room.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,2,1,3,im5ZNAJBzkXHMwpTtG2Uuw

While visiting the Vegas area my friend and I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel but we saw the huge silver seven billboard while out on a walk and thought we try it for breakfast.
Their billboard advertised cheap breakfast and was located in the back of our hotel so we had to make a visit. The breakfast was advertised for $2.99 (Pancakes, eggs and a breakfast meat option) but you needed to sign up for their casino card to get the deal which is free so we didn't mind. I also scored a $5.00 GC for food when signing up.
Breakfast was better than expected. Service was provided in a timely manner and we were not kept waiting long to place our order. The food itself was served hot and very good. My friend requested her eggs cooked a particular way and she said they were perfect. The meal was more than filling. We also ordered orange juice after the waitress assured us that it was freshly squeezed and it was surprisingly.
We came here for breakfast the rest of our stay and service was always great.",u5cuZkrIqiZLUc6scFlrmA,5,2,3,rz3cWyfOYwtEjToix4yLyA

note: you need to make a players card for the 5.99 price. if you don't, it's around 8.99",8inAKvB9x2yU16TvNL3KFw,3,0,5,hKlzu82XOrp3XQGE1zM08Q

5966121,2014-05-23,0,_V0yJdpXrbdKzBDoVSJGWA,"I was told once, ""There are two things that casinos don't have, clocks and mirrors"".  A clock, so you don't know what time it is; and a mirror so you don't see how bad you look, after long hours of gambling. lol THIS casino did have a mirrors!  Unfortunately, we did not stay the night here... but, since this location was so close to our hotel, we kept coming back here to eat and gamble. I liked this casino, because our chances of winning on the slots were so much greater than going to those big fancy casinos.  The hotel we stayed did not have a casino, and no restaurant; it was boring and bland. And the review on the hotel we did stay, coming soon.  

I was playing Texas Hold'em, I believe it was called limited. I've always played with family, without rules, 1st time playing with strangers and rules, I was really nervous. BUT, Michael and the other dealer was both patient with me, and were teaching me as we go. They suggested I get a players card and explained how that worked. So being around a bunch of strangers, I felt so comfortable, and I completely blended with them. In no time, I felt like a pro! :)

We went to a wedding in downtown Vegas, then after the wedding, hung out and played in multiple different casinos. My mother, who loves to gamble, wanted to go back to Silver Seven casino.  Towards the evening when we were going back to our room, she suggested, ""how about we stop at the Silver Seven and try our luck again. That's the only hotel where I was actually winning."" So, guess what, we came back to Silver Seven after 2:00 am that evening.

The next morning, after we checked out of our hotel, we went back to Silver Seven for breakfast and continued to gamble.   

The only negative thing about this place is all the smoking in the Casino.  Unfortunately, there was no section available for those who are non-smokers. 2nd hand smoke is just as bad as taking a hit yourself.  Additionally, getting into the parking was a bit tricky.  It felt like a long drive to get into the driveway when the guest parking was in the front.",HwIrEW2_zW8r9MV0YYO6kw,1,1,4,QJP0eLwuw85JMo-gld3gbQ
