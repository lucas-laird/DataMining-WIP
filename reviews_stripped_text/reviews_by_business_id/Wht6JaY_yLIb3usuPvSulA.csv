447183,2012-07-02,0,Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA,"I've been to a fair share of Mexican seafood restaurants in the city and I have to say that I would not recommend going to Las Islitas because there are better options available!!! 

My wife ordered the shrimp ceviche tostada and the tacos el gobernador plate. Im somewhat of a fish taco aficionado so I ordered the plate of 3 tacos. The ceviche was just ok, a bit bland and nothing special. The shrimp tacos with melted cheese were pretty tasty when the green salsa was put on them.  In my opinion, the fish tacos were some of the WORST I've ever had!! The fish itself was not seasoned and was soggy from a lightly  breaded coating, but was overcooked at the same time, if that makes any sense!! Not enjoyable at all! Even worse, each taco was inconsistent with the amount of fish because one taco had a decent amount and the other two hardly had any, just a tortilla full of lettuce!!  It was not even close to being worth the $10 price for the plate!

If you're looking for a nice, relaxing restaurant, this is definitely not it! We were with a group of people and it was nearly impossible to hear the conversation because of the noise. The live music, which is usually a plus, was way too loud for the size of the place. Between the loud music and the chatter of the other customers, all conversation was lost unless you were sitting right next to the person. 

One more thing that I feel must be pointed out....the girl who rang up my check deliberately tried to keep my change, and this was AFTER a tip had already been added to my bill because of the group!!! Are you freaking serious??? I wouldn't have believed it had I not seen it with my own eyes. On a $37 bill, which was not worth it's value as is, the cashier put the $40 in the register and NEVER pulled change...then immediately started cashing out other bills! After 5 minutes, my wife had to go to the cashier to inquiry about the change, and the cashier still had the nerve to play dumb about it!!! 

If I could give this place zero starts, I definitely would! The only good thing I can say is that the server was nice and attentive. Other than that, I'll spend a bit more gas and go to La Palapa in North Las Vegas, which is outstanding!!!",gTQ9Vwp0FGXDQVX9Opo-7g,1,0,1,5O8KURZwCQFn9zIgcc__Aw

864935,2017-05-07,0,Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA,"In the last 3 years I've only dined in a handful of times with friends but I do call & order their ceviche casero for pick up at least every couple of months. It is pricy (almost $30) and at least 75% of the time it's pretty good. The other times it's  either overpowered by the lime juice that makes you pucker and unable to continue eating it or at times the consistency of the shrimp is questionable... very mushy and weird tasting. But overall it's my favorite dish there.

My pet peeve however is because 99% of the time in the last year I've gotten the same lady at the register ringing me up for my Takeout order. Not that seeing the same face on a regular basis is a bad thing what irks me is that she ALWAYS  makes a point of asking if I'm going to leave a tip after she rings me out. 

Whenever I dine in anywhere I always leave a tip even when the service is not up to par. Perhaps, I'm not up to date with tipping etiquette... but I do not always tip on my Take Out orders. There's been a few places where I have tipped on my takeout orders but because they either brought it out to my car and/or it was a complicated order. 

Whenever this particular lady asks me if I'm going to tip on my almost $30 order of ceviche casero and I say sorry no thank you , she usually makes a face and continues the transaction with an attitude. On one occasion, after I said I was not going to tip, she turns around and tells the other lady at the counter in Spanish that I was not going to tip her and for the other lady to ring me out...seriously? So when the other lady took over I made sure she was aware that I speak and understand Spanish. She was very apologetic & embarrassed... not that it was her fault. 

I usually cringe before walking in hoping she's not there lol. So on the rare occasion when she's not the one ringing me out like last night then I do leave a little tip... simply because I wasn't made to feel uncomfortable or given an attitude for not leaving one.",BALHquDmc4S4Y_JKdCPOyQ,1,1,3,Egy4xxIZxv9bYBrGgl-ozg

With scenes of watery docks, and fish leaping from the sea surface painted on the wall, you expect a seafood-centered menu, and that's exactly what you'll find here.  I went with a Shrimp Ceviche tostada and the fish tacos.  While the chips and salsa were good, I can't say the same for the rest of my meal.

The smallish shrimp served on the Ceviche tostada was flavored well enough, but unfortunately none of them were deveined.  I'm an adventurous eater, but I'm not trying to eat the last meal of each shrimp, partially digested.  I sent it back, and the waitress was nice enough to remove it from my bill.

The fish tacos were sloppy, with big pieces of lettuce and a few scattered red onions.  While the fish itself was lightly fried well, there was little flavor and an odd texture to it.  

The service was fine, but the product is lacking.  I can't see returning here with all the other options to explore in Las Vegas.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,2,0,2,CxjUpux-i4taTvgYrC3wkQ

We were missing a couple of more people from our party so we sat there waiting for them and it just got hotter and hotter and it was really starting to get uncomfortable. Mind you it's 114 degrees outside on that specific day. Once the rest of our party arrived they also notice how suffocating it felt without any AC and we decided to cancel our orders and left. I've never ran into this issue before at the other location let alone at ANY restaurant in last Vegas! No AC?! C'mon!

Pricing is kind of all over the place: seafood can be pricey, but I didn't expect to see burritos around $11 and some meals without sides run you $15? There are also a couple of sushi rolls on the menu, but they seem to use cooked ingredients (fajitas?).

I like having the option to order the submarinos- a halved cucumber scooped out to form a boat, served filled with fish and shrimp ceviche and avocado slices. The portion is large and price is reasonable, ~$12, but the ceviche is not all that fresh and is lacking in flavor.

I've dined here two times with the gf and within the two different times, We've had two different experiences ( try saying that 5x LOL) from the customer service to the way the food tasted ...

First time - Walked in and stood there for a couple minutes until a waitress shouted "" pick where you wanna sit"" uh ok.... We sat down and we had the choice of booth or table, so we chose a table, and then after a couple minutes our waitress finally greeted us with very bland Chips y Salsa starter .We were  asked if we wanted a beverage ... ""Of course we did right?"" ... GF and I both chose Preparadas and they were by far the tastiest and better than B. Michoacan * cough...  We ordered the most amazingly prepared Guacamole y chips ! The chips were deep fried and flaky and the guacamole was the perfection of the right ratio of onion and lime, and strangely it was topped with a cheese... I'm thinking it could've been Oaxaca (not sure) but it was damn good .. Oh and we both shared the Submarinos - shrimp and fish ceviche inside a hollowed out cucumber, 2 per order. It was just enough for both of us . We saved room for dessert and ordered Churros con Nieve (ice cream) the Churros were okay :/ not the best but not the worst ( they were filled with cajete & chocolate ) and the ice cream was .. Well it was ice cream ?  I give it a 3/5 

Now ... 


Second time-  Gf ordered a Preparada and I got a MANGOCHELADA oh my ! It was prepared like a Chelada but it had mango pieces and a tamarindo straw- it was amazzing! We shared the Guacamole, but this time it was way off, it needed salt, lime and more onion. It was a totally different dish from the first experience . The chips y salsa were a little better, it wasn't so gringo this time. Sorry :/  then lastly we ordered just the ""ceviche de camaron "" and it was great.. We skipped dessert this time .. 

Overall .. Food was good, better than most places in town, drinks are GREAT., but work on the customer service and making people feel welcomed & not rushed .. Both times were different so I'm sticking to 3 stars.",mg8z-d-4ziWnCGyw8veuxQ,2,0,3,UohTIguGu4svC-pqhZteiQ

We ordered different food/drinks this time.

We also ordered the chips and guac again and the guac tasted off to me....we added a whole lime and salt to it and it was still just okay. Definitely a downgrade since the first time we went.

The salsa improved thankfully - I actually enjoyed it this time but the chips are still so stale that it hurt to bite into one at times. 

My GF got the Mangochelada which was AMAZING. It's a preparada with mango pieces and a tamarindo straw. I will definitely get that the next time I'm in.

We got a different waitress this time and service was good, which I was happy about so I decided to keep the rating because though some things were improved, others declined.

3075220,2018-03-29,0,Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA,Wow I am so glad I decided to eat lunch here with my boyfriend. We came on a Thursday afternoon and we loved it! I ordered the lemonade and it came In a big margarita glass which I thought was so cute. I ordered two Mangonados for my love and I. They were so good! I asked the waitress and she told me it had mango juice and chili in it. So refreshing it didn't even taste like beer. We asked for the lunch special menu which is so worth it! I ordered the Camarones rancheras. Shrimp empanadas to start and my boy ordered the steak chimichanga. The food is a 10. The rice and beans were authentic and so good. The green salsa that comes with the shrimp empanadas is spicy but gave the empanadas a better flavor. The chimichanga came with a small hot sauce on the side and it was also really good. The interior of this place is super cute with paintings on the wall and Banda music playing in the back. I felt at home here. They have live banda on the weekends I would definitely be checking that out,qEjm0_ivRn8WlfJipeFAgg,0,0,5,l3PPXRaloHXcnIJsFvOEFA

However, felt like this location is lacking that ""touch"". I ordered the shrimp ceviche and fish tacos and they were definitely not as flavorful as they are at their north town location. The ceviche tasted way too fishy, needed lots of lemon and salt and the tacos where just blah!  

The restaurant itself is nice. Waitress was nice and attentive, just didn't get the same experience. The people I was with also agreed as they have also tried the other location. I will not be coming back to this location, especially because the prices have increased but worth it if you get the ""Islitas"" experience. This place does not have it. Go to north Las Vegas location. They are overpriced for the quality.

The only thing that didn't disappoint during our visit. It's a clean enough restaurant, but the service was slow and didn't explain menu items very clearly. 

I had a shrimp burrito. The portion was generous, but if it's not that good that's no consolation. The shrimp was overcooked- rubbery. The rice was a pale bland mess and the only thing I enjoyed was the beans. My husband had a plate of whole shrimp with a red sauce. It looked better than it tasted. 

Overall we paid $50 for 4 Cokes (no refills- it's bottles) and 2 entrees. We tried to give a card to the gent who brought our check and told to wait for our server - but I didn't catch why. We swapped that plan for cash after waiting- we just wanted to leave. The server saw us get up and ran over to ask if we were going to pay- maybe she thought we were making a break for it. We weren't- although the thought did cross my mind ;)",pAUcdHTJxwPNeOK43K1_Cg,4,2,1,M6GexOA9entbRVOFEgmG6w
3884241,2016-09-19,1,Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA,"Expensive Mediocre Seafood.

I was expecting more from a marisco place not that great. We tried a little bit of everything here. I ordered shrimp imperiales, shrimp tacos governador, empanadas, Shrimp coptel, Ceviche botana, langostinas, micheladas. 

Nothing memorable, I judge a place right of the back off the salsa. Salsa no flavor stale chips. Next michelada for the hangover, this one was disgusting not refreshing at all. Their shrimp is not devined, disgusting eating shrimp dookie, ill. The shrimp is precooked for the ceviche does not come fresh. Our food smelled very fishy not fresh at all. The shrimp imperiales were ok the salsas they use are extremely bland no flavor at all I guess that's why they have several bottled salsas at every table. The tacos governadores were OK, they use tiny shrimp in these tacos with again a very bland sauce. My coptel de camaron very dissapointing no citrusy flavor at all, they serve it with all veggies on the side and lime. You have to fix it up yourself how unoriginal. The botana that we ordered again very bland very expensive 6 of us walked out of there with a $220 bill. 

Just to give you a little background, Im mexican grew up in LA, grew up on home cooking. This place will not give you that hangover cure and seafood craving you are looking for. Try small hole in the wall place I have on my other review in Vegas.",twx2ZgFUbat87vGQ_tFbPA,0,0,2,Nt-kDs4sb5eZtINYXrVPbw
3929787,2017-10-16,0,Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA,If I could give a zero I would. Should have read the reviews before going. Where to begin? Oh yes they have a sign that they want you to wait to be seated but then expect you to sit as no one welcomes you. The place was empty so you would think food would be served at a decent wait. Well first of all the waitress claims that our party of 10 was to big so she needed a minimum of 4 separate bills. We said ok then she took 20 minutes to bring our drinks. When the place was empty. I ordered a jarrito with tequila well it was a sunny d beverage no tequila there for $13 instead of the $10 on the menu with a quality of a dollar. Next our food after a long long wait was cold and tasteless. No lemons no salt on the table no refill of sodas no napkins but remember about the separate bills? Well each was charged a $10 tip on each one. So that's why the bills were separated. Mind you none of the totals were less than $90 when I orders fish tacos at $5 and shrimp cocktail plus my sunny d beverage and a michelada totaled to $85. My sister who ordered 3 items under $20 paid $70 . How is this place in business ???,VFKSNhBDx8I2ktosrBduUQ,0,0,1,di1C_DIM8gpbxJXQYBPRmQ

Well, all I have to say is that I wasn't disappointed. I really enjoy sea food and the taste of the items we ordered was delicious. 

I ordered a cocktail which was really big and it was packed with sea food. It was kind of pricey but you get your money's worth and good tasting food. 

There are also options for the kids just in case they don't like seafood. Chicken nuggets with crinkle cut fries are apparently popular, and not bad tasting either.

4974861,2008-11-02,0,Wht6JaY_yLIb3usuPvSulA,"It's the last day to claim those Entertainment book coupons and after finding out Siena Bistro was closed for a private event, we headed to Las Islitas #3.  Their banner outside advertised lunch specials starting from $5.99, Monday through Friday.   

I had already called ahead and learned that their seafood dishes were not part of the coupon special.  After looking through their menu, it left us with very few choices.  (Their specialty is seafood, so the majority of the menu had some kind of seafood in it.)  On the back page of the menu were a few meat dishes so we stuck with that selection.

The waitress had already brought over tortilla chips, salsa, and fresh limes.  (The Big F really liked their tortilla chips and I found their salsa with just the right amount of heat.)  We were more than hungry by the time our food arrived.

The Big F ordered the Carne en su Jugo ($14.95) ""beef stew with bacon, onion and green sauce"" - The first thing I tried was their refried beans and was impressed.  Sure, they don't give much rice, and they really should give more beans because it's that good!  It's so creamy and unlike other refried beans I've had.  The Big F thought the beef stew was different, and liked it a lot.  His plate was licked clean.

I tried their Fajitas de Res ($14.95) ""beef fajitas"" - It came with either corn or flour tortillas, and I chose the flour kind.  Chunky pieces of beef with red and green bell peppers, onions, and some other red vegetable.  It was a pretty filling dish, and I had enough for leftovers.  The Big F found the beef to be a bit dry, but I loaded it with salsa and hot sauce, so I couldn't really tell.

We were definitely curious about their seafood dishes since we saw other diners enjoying themselves on generous dishes of ceviche.  

Overall, we were surprisingly pleased with our lunch.  We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy.  We were probably more bugged with the 'no seafood' part, so we couldn't really enjoy what they offered if we wanted to take advantage of that coupon.  Oh well.  Next time!

American Express not accepted.

3.5 stars.
