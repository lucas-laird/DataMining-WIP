Putting out a variety of house-made fries, available plain, with cheese, cheese and jalapenos, loaded baked potato, or Asian chicken (with a sriracha cream drizzle and cilantro). They smartly had all of their featured styles on display, and despite having one of the longest lines, it moved pretty quickly. 

Chips were fresh, portion as huge for the low $5 price tag, and they were generous with the toppings. Their old-school ticketed ordering system helped keep things running smoothly and ensured everyone got what they ordered, as they turned their ticket stub in to pick up their food. Their website indicates that they do general catering, and I'd be interested to hit up the truck if I see it again to see what other food they put out.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,6,4,iNRcFyiUlaPJh1uJtTlnkA

Which this stuff wasn't cheap, it was worth every penny. So much that I wrote down the name of the cart, and wanted to write a review about it. I got the loaded baked potato option, and it was exactly what I needed. I loved this cart and would totally want this at a sporting event or something. SO GOOD.",X568BojbbH6cAxqXU5zLwA,0,0,5,t1vGnmVSTQ1Bk8avb3AzYA
4382558,2016-05-02,0,xZlUykq9UzBUbROIPxi-tA,"I just tried Clever Chef at The Great American Foodie Fest over the weekend. The various loaded chips were calling to me each time I walked by. I had the Loaded Baked Potato Chips. The chips were delicious and obviously freshly made. The idea was great and the taste was A-OK. The portion was huge and the combination was rich so it would definitely be best shared among two or three people. 

The service was very friendly and my order came up quickly, especially compared to the wait time at the other stands. The chips were $10 which seemed a bit steep for chips, even at a food festival. Maybe a smaller portion for $5 would be a good festival option.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,2,3,HngxIoFH7cLf2R-de6349Q

Loved the Asian influenced sandwiches when they have them. Simply the best.,IZSDRRghRVkwOM8k0fos-A,0,0,5,2WQrjGdEE7deyRUwd3LRlw
