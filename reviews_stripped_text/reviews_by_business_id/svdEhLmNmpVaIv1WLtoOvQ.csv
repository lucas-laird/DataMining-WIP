Came here around 1p thinking their HH was earlier than it really is but decided to check it out anyway since we were already there. Inside decor is hip and I remember hearing Empire of the Sun playing in the background. My friend noticed a Black Keys poster hanging on their wall. Got seated by the windows and started off with a passion fruit margarita, mango margarita, and chips and salsa. Margaritas were good. Preferred the passion fruit over the mango. They were flavors you can easily down. Chips and salsa were ok but for $1.95 it wasn't bad.

Ordered the corn salad, fish taco, shrimp taco, and the al pastor. My friend liked her fish taco and I liked the shrimp. The al pastor for us, was meh. We thought it wasn't as good as the fish and shrimp. I think what makes their tacos good are the tortillas they use. I could probably eat it alone. Such perfect texture. Also, don't skip out on the corn salad. Probably my favorite thing I tried here.

Service was very attentive. They consistently make sure you're doing okay but it came to the point where they checked on us so often, we felt rushed to finish our meals. 

HH is 3p-6 and 11p-close. I'd come back to check it out. The HH menu does seem like it got shorter in comparison to the past but prices are reasonable regardless.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,1,0,3,kL7jOct3JUm4XDUt4Upe_Q

This is the worst place I've been to in a very long time and it really really takes a lot for me to say that but I feel everyone needs to know so that they don't experience what I had to go through. From the beginning I knew it was a bad sign when my party and I were not greeted , not knowing if we can seat ourselves or have to wait for someone, after waiting for a minute to be seated we were told to sit anywhere and when we chose a table we were told ""you can't sit there"". What!!? So after we were given a table that we could sit at our waiter came by and took our order, well that was the only time we saw our waiter, he disappeared never to return, never checked up on us, NOTHING! Our order was wrong when it was brought to us and our side dishes didn't come until the end, the point of side dishes are to enjoy them during the meal. The food was nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary, their beans taste exactly like Hormel chilli beans and everything lacked flavor. Del taco has better tacos and beans than this place and they even sell burgers! With no service from our waiter I flagged down the busboy and then took the job of our waiter refilling our drinks and taking our plates, etc. When it came time to pay the bill it was just as awful, more like a 25min awful wait. I literally could've dined and dashed with all the opportunities I was given not being served but my party said no because karma is a bitch so I agreed. I ended up getting up to pay the bill at the front of the Resturant where I met the owner and told him about our horrible experience and he didn't seem to care, at the same time out waiter magically appeared as we were leaving and talking to his boss. After a couple of minutes of them talking our waiter came back with a revised bill, I paid him and gave the tip to our busboy. On top of all the horrible service and horrible food I ended up getting food poisoning that I still am suffering from as I write this review. DONT GO HERE!

Props for labelling it the flautas sauce, but fail on being what I asked for. Luckily I'm saving them for leftovers. The ceviche was good but I felt like it was weirdly chunky. If everything had been cut finer, it would have been even better. 

The carne asada fries were a total fail. My boyfriend asked for no beans or guac and both were on there. Cheese wasn't shredded so getting extra created just pockets I'd melted cheese.

Some looked like they may have been off the clock or just hanging out but still went back and forth behind the bar and in the kitchen so it's hard to say. It was painfully difficult to get someone's attention. Mind you there were only about 20 or so customers in the place.

At first we were thinking fast food but then we passed by tacos and beer and thought, why not! And we were not disappointed at all. We ordered guacamole and added corn, bacon and cities. It was absolutely delicious, had some hint of spice, lots of crumbled, crispy bacon and sweet corn. Our tacos came out shortly after. The prices were amazing, most expensive was shrimp at $3.95 and a lot were under $3. I got shrimp and carne asada, and they were the best tacos I have had in Las Vegas. They were big, over flowing with pico sauce, guac and meat. If you are a fan of shrimp tacos, you have to try the ones at tacos and beer. My fiancée got lengua, carnitas and beef barboca and each of his were better than the last. Each taco had an array of fillings and sauces and the flavored were perfect. We didn't try any drinks (had just come from a bar) but next time for sure.

Their tacos are ala cart so if you're a fatty it can get expensive, but it gives you the freedom to sample the menu. Tacos are delicious, I had carne asada, crunchy chicken and chorizo, all three were fantastic. The crunchy tacos come with mashed potatoes which may sound odd but was quite delicious.

My husband and I have eaten here several times, and we love it more with each visit.

The atmosphere is great. The decor is really unique and inviting.

The staff is friendly, and helpful. The bartenders were very knowledgeable of their extensive beer menu. If you're a fan of great craft beer, Tacos and Beer is the place to go. They have an amazing selection of hard to find craft brews. Everything from imperial stouts for my husband, to wild sour beers, and even honey mead for me. The general manager, Dave, knows more about beer than anyone I've ever met. He was kind enough to introduce us to, what are now, several of our favorite beers!


And the food is absolutely delicious! Chips and guacamole are great. Oh and the beer cheese dip is ridiculous. We've tried most of the tacos and love them all. Our favorites are; the crunchy tacos with mash potatoes, the puerco verde with pork rinds, the beef adobada, and the pork al pastor. The flautas are also great! We have also eaten dessert there, and my goodness, the flan is amazing, definitely the best flan I've ever had. The churros are really great as well.

Chicken tinga.  Super tender and moist. Salty but sweet?!?  3. Puerco verde.  Same as the barbacoa.  Moist flavorful.  Not too spicy.  Oh, and served with a handful of pork cracklings on top 4.  Pork al pastor.  This was my favorite.  I love the hot spicy of the pork and the cooling sweet of the pineapple.  And a small swath of crema on top.  Yum.  
Only one complaint. The tortillas which are made in house, were cold.  I'm sure there's a reason for this. But I prefer warmed taco tortillas.

Tacos & Beer is a small spot in a strip mall that serves a large variety of differently made style tacos, with plenty of beers on draft, and a great venue.  
I actually live in Austin TX and we have tough standards when it comes to quality tacos.  My friends took me here one time and instantly loved it.  I have made it a mission to visit every single time I am back in Las Vegas.  You can easily take a $8 Uber/Lyft from your hotel room on the strip to go there.  This place stays open past midnight each day.  They have a covered outdoor patio also at the venue.  It is more of a restaurant than a bar, but the venue itself is great.  Not too crowded, well run, friendly staff, and some really tasty food.  
First start the appetizer off which some salsa & chips or maybe even order some guacamole.  The chips are freshly made here. Now you have this huge list of tacos to choose from.  The tacos are mid sized so a normal person will probably want to order 3-4.  The menu has such a great variety to it.  The steak carne asada taco is an easy win with the grilled skirt steak, beans, guacamole, pico and queso fresco.  I love the spicy pork Chorizo taco with cilantro and onion. Certainly enjoyed the chicken tinga taco with verde salsa and pickled red onions.  The BBQ beef taco was just ok, but didn't care much for the bbq sauce.  Loved the fried avocado taco.  Lastly, who doesnt love a basic bean and cheese taco?  Mix and match your taco selection to get the full combo of flavors they offer.  
They serve the tacos on this cool rack that holds each one in place.  Come on Taco Tuesday for $.50 off each.  The bar has plenty of beers on draft and specialty drinks.  Seems Vegas locals also like this spot from chatting with a few different Lyft drivers.  When you are in Vegas, sometimes you just want a simple meal but you still want it to be tasty.  I would much rather pay for the Lyft fare to this spot, get a great meal, then just get another ride back to the strip.  You will realize the cost isnt that much higher than eating in a Vegas strip hotel's basic food court.

1375827,2014-11-13,7,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,"I was interested in this place after seeing a bunch of yelp buds check into here. It was a very solid experience. 

I guess that this used to be the old Firefly restaurant, with the same owners as Firefly. Instead of a tapas restaurant, they have turned it into an upscale Mexican restaurant.

The interior is dark and moody, giving the place a very relaxed feel where you can just kick back and chill with your buddies.

First ordered the house guacamole. It was nicely made, but I thought it could have used a touch more seasoning. But, I did enjoy that lil kick of heat that they put in it. The chips were super crispy, and not too greasy.

Then, my tacos came out. First, I gotta say, I love the tacos here. They put a lot of attention to the small details. The rock shrimp tacos are bomb. Coated with a slightly spicy (but not too spicy) seasoning, they were cooked to perfection. I would also recommend the crunchy tacos. They actually put mashed potatoes in them! And it works marvelously. The lengua and barbacoa tacos were hits as well.

Ordered some sides as well. The charro beans were just OK. I did like the fresh chicharrones on top though. Also got the hot chilies. I would say to avoid this. It came with just 3 roasted chilies that were cooked with lime juice. I'm sure there are better options on the sides menu that you can choose.

I like this place and would come back here with friends and colleagues. I would also like to try some drinks here next time, they seem to have an interesting program going on there.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,14,10,4,P2d5t-eox7arcDo-ahithg

This place was amazing from start to finish ! 
Got there around 10:50 pm
The happy hour started at 11pm where they have Mexican beers and margaritas on special for 3& 4 dollars.
The shots of patron we got were like 10$ each but big shots worth it with a diet coke back . (Also they refilled my diet coke through out the night it was on the bill
After but they took it off cause I told them it was my backer for my shot) it was a big glass. 
Customer service was great! Waiters are pleasant and attractive. 
The tacos are amazing! all reasonably priced and sized like 3/4$ each . They are speciality tacos and very good not like generic ground beef or something. Each is unique and flavorful 

The spicy shrimp (big shrimps ) n steak taco were my favorite! I will definitely be going back for those. They were spicy and had different amazingly yummy hot sauces to choose from
On each table . I also got mahi mahi taco and ceviché was an amazing appetizer with loads of chilled mahi mahi .
Tip : come during happy hour and your tacos are only
2/3$ and happy hour is 3-6pm
Or 11-2am
The ambience was great! There was live DJ spinning great music, I didn't want to leave.! And it makes it for a good place to have some drinks of course. 

Crowd was classy and attractive. And it is a mexicAn resturant , so there was also a Mexican soccer team
There. It was cool :)

It was pretty dark with green neon lightening . Which I loved added to the night life ambience.

Unfortunately I found the lengua plain and greasy, but the grilled fish taco was fairly good. Unfortunately it was wrapped in a waxy, store-bought flour tortilla. Prices are a little high, ~$3-4/per with a 50-cent discount on Taco Tuesdays. If you're going to hype up your tacos and price them higher than nearby taquerias, at least buy the good tortillas to use even if you don't make them in house (which isn't that hard).

THE BEER: Sat at the bar for my visit. Selection looks good, but my server/bartender wasn't particularly knowledgeable, friendly, or service-oriented. There were several friendly ladies behind the bar but the one serving patrons seemed to be the least suited for it. She barely made eye contact, didn't engage in any conversation, and didn't seem to want to be there. Perhaps she was having an off day.

THE REST: Interesting setup, lively atmosphere.

I flew in from NY and I was there with my brother, his girlfriend, and my boyfriend and we came to enjoy some tacos & beer for Taco Tuesday.  We had ordered our tacos and my boyfriend wanted to try the beer sampler my brother had recommended to try. So minutes later we got our guac and tacos and beer sampler. 

I wish we COULD have enjoyed it but.. MINUTES later.. our beer sampler had been SNATCHED from our table from the manager (Chuy Ramos) without us even knowing why. Just gone- disappeared right off of our table. I thought he was going to come back and explain himself--- but NOPE. HE didn't. So in awe that ANYONE in the restaurant business would do that, I called my waitress. First of all, vegas is HUGE on hospitality and taking ANYTHING off anyone's table without first explaining WHY is a NO NO. You just DON'T do that. So back to my story, I spoke to the waitress to call him over because I wanted to know first hand why he took our beer sampler away without any explanation of why. He came over, was rude and DEFENSIVE- NOT apologetic at all. He told me that he thought that our table had no intentions of paying for it.. WHAAT?? How does that even make sense. REGARDLESS- I told him it was inappropriate and unprofessional and rude. His response: ""I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE. HAVE A GOODNIGHT!"" .. I WISH I was joking.  Management or the owner should know that this is the kind of manager that is running this restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be returning and neither will anyone of my family members. That is definitely not the Vegas hospitality I was accustomed to.  I'm from Vegas, grew up here, went to UNLV here.. and I have never experienced such rudeness. He should have been apologetic and brought back our beer sampler.. but nope he did not. Just watched us until we finished our food and we left.",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,16,5,1,e8W3yyjOzm9_PlVOWu4row

We started with the TNB salad, and had a variety of 6 different tacos. We had the BBQ beef, shrimp, grilled fish, pibil, crunchy chicken, and the pastor. The pastor tacos are out of this world good, for sure favorite. I strongly suggest trying a few different ones, and sharing if need be. Looking forward to coming back to try the hurache, which is always a favorite dish of mine when I come across it on a menu.  

I would have totally given this place a 4 star, but the service was really, really sub par. We had the dozen mini taco plate, and two full size pastor tacos, and the bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers. The jalapeños were really tasty, and the pastor tacos were fantastic. The dozen mini taco plate on the other hand, was a bit of a let down. Our server did not indicate to us that the minis are not served as they are described on the front of the menu. They are served with just the meat, cilantro and onions. Not as they are described with specialty toppings that I feel make the tacos unique.

So, I gave this place another chance since my good friend loves it...and I'm so glad I did! 

This time, hostess was wonderful, server was attentive (enough) and the food was still incredible! I'm so glad this experience made up for the terrible service I had the first time I came here, because the food is just too good! 

One of the owners, Carlos is absolutely wonderful and his beer knowledge is impressive. If you don't have a palate for beer, like me, you should really ask him what to order, if he's around. I was so surprised that I found two beers I LOVE, 1) Tangerine Haze (IPA)  and 2) Elephant Heart Brett. 

It's a fun atmosphere and you should really bring a friend, or two or three and come have some eats and laughs!",4GJR4CmkM2nLPK5_0q4aMA,3,2,4,NuwLgyjR3p47bovqXKhVtQ

Shortly after we polished off the first order of queso modelo our individual orders came up. My three tacos I ordered came out perfectly. I loved every one of them and they got better and better with every taco I ate. My grandma ordered the fried avocado taco with cilantro dressing and proceeded to destroy it commenting on how it was the best taco she'd ever had. My cousin ordered the carne asada fries and asked me to eat half of it and they were extremely good. We were extremely satisfied with every aspect of this restaurant.

They managed to make the the formerly Firefly space seem way less pretentious and more welcoming, which is great. I started with a Tahoe Mountain wild pale ale that had a fragrance of grapefruit and a pleasantly hoppy finish. My wife had a Gose which she found too sweet, but I found very tasty. Salsa offerings with the chips and salsa were very fresh tasting. The Queso Modelo on the other hand was bland with a very un appealing texture, in our opinion. On the plus side though, it was a huge serving for an app. 

Entrees were the taco sample with a few more tacos on the side. The stand out had to be the Adobada. So flavorful. Carnitas and Puerco Verde were also very good. I thought the Lengua was somewhat flavorless; all the punch on that taco came from the delicious pickled radishes and salsa on top. 

On the side we tried the Charro beans. They were so good they made me wanna slap my momma! Definitely a must try. 

Service was speedy and attentive. The food came just about as fast as it takes to make a fresh tortilla and make a taco. We will definitely be coming back especially for the happy hour specials.",t5pwzGdE80KyFVZY6PI8vQ,3,1,5,dkn9Jn_iv42C4IrooJbp7Q

I was ignored by the bartender most of the (slow ass) night. Things started badly when I asked for the HH menu, which says a certain set of bottled beers are half off - and that these beers are marked on the menu. It turns out to be a disingenuous menu because none of the bottles are marked. When I asked my bartender about this, she seemed confused, and called over someone else. This man was very unclear. 
Me: ""Which bottles are on happy hour""
Him: ""oh what kind of beer do you usually like""
Me: ""I like various beer, but I want to know which bottles are on special""
Him: ""If you tell me what beer you like, I can get you one similar""
Me: ...

This went on for a minute until he informed me that they weren't doing bottle specials anymore, and that was an erroneous menu page. This was a bait and switch, pure and simple.

Frustrated with the experience, and just wanting to leave but still waiting for my tacos, I asked for an iced tea, it was served with no ice - just a room temperature brewed tea, and the bartenders/servers couldn't even be reached to try and fix the problem.

They charge for chips and salsa (altho price isn't that bad... Approx $3). We also got the carne Asada fries, which consisted mainly of fries and some kind of dressing. 

We actually came for the house Sunday event which is advertised to start at 9pm. It hadn't started at 930 and we had to leave for something else, so that was a little disappointing.

It's located in the same spot as the original Firefly on Paradise. So it's small-ish. And parking can be challenged when this little strip mall is packed. But that said, we had zero issues at 7pm on a Friday night.

We were seated immediately. Though, there was no hostess at the hostess stand. So we did stand around for a few minutes trying to catch someone's eye.

They're repainted it and whatnot, but it's still a similar layout to how Firefly was. Nice decor. Good ambiance.

The waitstaff were attentive and pleasant. Particularly quick to refill drinks and clear plates.

The guacamole was good. Nothing particularly noteworthy. Next time, I'd probably opt for one of their queso options (they have 2!).

The tacos were delicious. It's all a la carte. The tacos range from $2.50 to $3.75 for one taco. And you can mix and match to your heart's content. The Groupon included 6 tacos, so we tried 6 different ones. They even have vegetarian options, which were quite tasty. In fact, my 2 favs were a veggie one and the pork al pastor (good flavor and topped with pineapple). The beef ones were also good choices.

You can then pick various sides. We went for the chorizo and bacon beans and the cilantro rice. Both were full of flavor.

The drink list is actually pretty good. There's some cocktails and wines, but beer (duh!) is the star here. The beer list was pretty lengthy and had some good finds.

He then immediately got annoyed and said ""so, what do you want to drink?""  Not sure what part of ""I hadn't looked at the menu yet"" he missed). Salsa showed up after we had already eaten a couple of tacos, no explanation of what the salsa were, and when asking us if we wanted anything else, all he did was start to ask the question and before we could say anything (or swallow the food we were eating) he just turned his back and walked away as he finished the question. 

Just a whole host of other small, bad customer service moves which when added up made for a really disappointing experience. Server clearly didn't want to be there and was not interested in anything. Really hope management there gives a bit of a refresher on basic customer service training. Will definitely steer people clear of this place.

It's always crowded and we usually have to stand by the bar with some beers before we do get seated. Once you finally get seated, however, that's when the magic starts. They have amazing Margaritas to start with, and their chips and salsa and guac are delicious. Finally, you get to the tacos, where they have both great vegetarian options and amazing meat options. My go-to tacos are usually cochinita pibil, Baja fish, and Al Pastor. However, with the amount of times I've been, I've heard about or tried almost every taco on the menu, and there have never been complaints. If you want a more local bite of Vegas, go 2 blocks off the strip and check the place out!

The tacos were good, don't get me wrong but all of these people's reviews saying they are the best in town are kidding themselves.  I love the variety and even love that they have so many vegan options (even though I am a staunch meat eater).  I love the variety of unique appetizers but the flavor seemed to be lacking on everything and I made sure to try a lot.  I had 6 different tacos and 2 appetizers and a passion fruit margarita which seemed so fake tasting, way too sugary.  

I would go back and try this place again but probably not for a bit.  I feel like there of plenty of other places that you can have a better taco at in the valley.  Maybe the atmosphere won't be as nice but it will be cheaper and tastier.  

I was so full though after eating all of that that I unfortunately did not get to try their desserts which I REALLY wanted to try.  I guess that gives me an excuse to go back!",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,0,0,3,6zVkmpZi0z5jvZh2JBysHg

We especially loved the Al Pastor and Puerco Verde tacos. The Al Pastor has pineapple in it and that's what gives it such a bright and great taste. They also give you a starter plate of chips and salsa - also very fresh tasting.

We went back to the restaurant a few days later during their afternoon Happy Hour from 3-6 PM daily and again, it was equally as good, both food and service. We were checked on multiple times and never had to ask for anything.

I've heard that this fun, little taco joint is owned by the same owner as Firefly (located a hop, skip and a jump down Paradise), one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why would we expect any less quality and amazing-ness from Imperial? This place absolutely exceeded our expectations.

The tacos were very thoughtfully crafted with some lovely, complementary ingredients. We tried a wide variety of their signature tacos and I don't see any reason to stray into the other entree options. The cochinita pibil taco was the only land creature I ate that day and it had intensely good flavor; I especially loved the habanero marinated onions. The grilled fish taco didn't blow me away, but was definitely solid. I loved the fried fish taco, but felt the shrimp taco was probably the winner of the day. Family said the puerco verde was a winner, as was the guacamole appetizer we had to start with.

Their tap selection was great and we were able to buy some IPAs for the table. However, I always forget how expensive Vegas is (we aren't residents) and couldn't believe paying $8-10 for a pint of craft beer. Fortunately, we came during happy hour and were able to quench our thirst with some $3 Negra Modelo on draft.

Finally, we had to get dessert. Their version of choco tacos and churros were awesome and expertly crafted, but the gold medal goes to the churros with their chocolate y whipped cream dips.

The hostess noticed that I was getting upset and she said she would give me a table, but if she needed it to seat someone else I would have to take my food and move to the bar. I told her that's fine because at that time the restaurant was getting empty and a lot of tables were getting clear.

Service was interesting. When I first came in. I said I was expecting someone and took a table. Ordered margarita. The nasty passion fruit one. I asked how it was and he said a little sweet. Liar!!! That thing was like drinking sour candy! And he kept coming up asking if I was ready. Seriously in 10 minutes he came up 5 times. And when my friend sat down asked if we were ready. I literally had to say give us a minute. Geez the guy hasn't even looked at the menu yet. Then he wasn't around when we were ready. Finally he came back and ordered. Two other people came up and checked on us. Then we waiter forever for the check.

After a long and hot day at the Las Vegas Comic Con, I was hungry for tacos and wanted a chilly IPA in my hand, Tacos and Beer, I see you. First off, the outside is pretty deceiving, like most Las Vegas ""snackateria's"" it's located in a strip mall with a plain look and minimal signage, but when you walk-in it's dark, cool (temp wise) and has clean rustic-hipster look. I'm sold already. 

I went with two tacos; a Fish Taco and the Pork al Pastor plus, chips and salsa, and bacon wrapped jalapenos. The Tacos were amazing, the al Pastor was super tender and the pineapple chunks went with the avocado cream sauce perfectly, great sweet and savory combo. The Fish taco was not fried, but grilled which sometimes can lack in flavor, but this time around that was not the case. Flaky fish, habanero-mango salsa, and cilantro, boom. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for ""lighter"" taco option. 

The Bacon-wrapped Jalapeños were huge and stuffed with cream cheese and came with a guajillo chili sauce. These were a hit it on all cylinders for me, even if it meant I would be paying for it later on in bathroom. 

The service was fast and our waiter knew the beer menu very well, he even mentioned a few beers that weren't on the list, but were still available. If you haven't been here yet, the beer list is pretty extensive, so for him to memorize the entire beer wall menu and know the taps was pretty impressive.

Their beer menu is pretty impressive, I forgot to count but it looked like 6 pages of beer selections and cocktails to choose from. One thing I was a little sad about, no horchata :( I must have horchata  with my tacos!!! Maybe even make an alcoholic version! Lol 
The main thing that makes their tacos stand out is the tortilla! Not too thick or thin, freshly handmade and had perfect texture! Delicious! The guacamole and chips also tasted really fresh and it was a pretty big portion. We ordered 2 pork al pastor, 2 carne asada, 1 beef adobado, and 1 chicken tinga. Oh my, I will definitely be back for the al pastor, it was perfect! The pineapple with the pork and the perfect tortilla, heaven! The carne asada was a little lacking in the seasoning, the adobado had a good flavor to it and so did the chicken tinga.

Ive been here three times now. Every time the order is always wrong. I'm very specific about ordering the barbacoa tacos with no cheese and no crema. The first time I went I ordered three but they brought out only one and it took forever so i decided to just not wait another 20 minutes for two tacos. The second occasion they had crema on it still when i ordered it to specficailly not to. People have food allergies so I dont understand why this is taken so lightly to get an order correct. The third occasion being last night I went with a party of 4 and they got our whole order wrong.

First lets talk about service, there's not much to it that is tasteful. Someone came by and dropped off chips and salsa that we didnt request for.  We asked if it was complimentary but they didnt say anything and ended up charging us for it on the bill She wasn't our server but every time she came by to pick up plates she kept on giving us attitude and rude glares. Our server took 15 minutes just to take our drink order and left in such a rush to not even ask if we wanted to order food. He came by 4 times before finally asking if we wanted to order. It isnt our job as a a customer to have to say hey, we're ready to place our order.  This is a rule of thumb in any restaurant - serve your tables with a proper greeting and ask what we would like to drink and order in timely and professional manner. As usual, I ordered my barbacoa tacos with no crema and cheese, three to be exact and I orderd a fourth taco being chicken. Two of my barbaco came out as the crunchy taco which is a different meat and those tacos still had crema and cheese on it. Now i'm left with missing two tacos again having to wait AGAIN for them to be made properly.The upsetting part was that the server repeated the order? So maybe it's kitchen staff who don't know how to read the quanity of how many tacos to make?

I'm never coming back to this place again. It's not that hard to get an order correct and the service doesn't make up for giving this place another shot.

Also, this isn't really a place to bring your kids unless you want them to get a free show. The host wears a really skimpy romper out with no bra. NO BRA! We are not in a nightclub people. This is a dine in restaurant. Where is the uniform? My poor son had to keep looking over at her because her boobs were popping out of her chest.

3087574,2017-07-25,0,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,"Fancier tacos for just a little bit more than a taco shop. The restaurant is small and cozy and there's a patio towards the parking lot. Some nights can get reaaally busy and loud. So much so that I've left because I don't want to deal with it. However, their tacos are far better with more variety than you'll get anywhere in town. 

I've had a lot of their tacos but the number one recommendation is: anything with mashed potatoes. It's a game changer. The BBQ beef taco does this well. Lately I've been trying out their vegetarian options and I must say the Veggie taco is surprisingly good. The mushroom is thick and flavorful and of course the potato adds smooth creaminess. I tried the beer battered avocado taco last night. It was packed full of avocado and creamy sauces. The batter definitely reminded me of having a beer battered halibut taco, minus the halibut. I'd probably get this again but it's a lot of food. The guacamole is nothing special, but it is fresh and I like the queso fresco in it. 

I'm usually good just ordering two tacos, and my boyfriend is usually full off of three. I do recommend eating any crunchy tacos first, as they get soggy pretty quickly. Also make sure to ask for hot sauces, they have four to choose from. Overall it's a great place to bring friends and family. There's a lot to explore on the menu and the quality is a surprise to people expecting taco shop food. Check the website to see if there are events going on to avoid the place being packed and loud music, unless you're into that.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,64y23-qzftvpOlYlqdly1A

The restaurant is very nice very clean with plenty of seating with a very popular patio area as well. But since it was full we had to sit inside no problem. Took a minute for a waiter to come over but it's all good we're on vacation. Our waiter was a really cool and relaxed guy he was super helpful as my dining companion had a bunch of questions.

So to start things off right we got the house margaritas One frozen the other on the rocks. Omg it was soo good you can tell they use fresh lime or an in-house mix because it was so flavorful and not overly sweet. As an appetizer we ordered the chips and salsa it came with a roasted tomato and an avocado tomatillo salsa it was absolutely delicious and definitely homemade. It wasn't spicy which I was kind of hoping it would be but if that's what you're into this would be perfect for you.

For my entrée I ordered three tacos  The barbecue beef, the Carnitas, and the Baja fish all were amazing! My favorite had to be the barbecue beef with the mashed potatoes shredded lettuce and sour cream all the flavors combine perfectly and the crispy shell perfectly complemented this taco. The fish was delicious too it had to be my second favorite cooked perfectly w/flaky fish and slaw w/the lime crema and guac mixed it was perfect together overall great flavor. I wanted to try the Carnitas because the pictures looked so good. I thought it was OK but it was my last favorite I think it was because of the chicharrones they tasted too intestine like. Which lets me know they must be fresh and not from the bag like I'm used to.

Everytime ive gone service is bad which i dont understand why when they are always over staffed. When i sit at a table there's a guy that brings you water, the server that takes your order and the runner that delivers your food, and in your 30 minute dining experience youve had 3 different people come to your table. And no one comes back to make sure you're ok maybe because they all think the other person is checking in.

Today i was frankly fed up with it, which led me to finally writing a review because i noticed its an ungoing problem. I went in around 5:30 sunday july 30th sat at the bar, bartender was chatting with some girl seemed like her friend. Didnt say anything finished her conversation grabbed some menus without sayin a word. I said ""hi how are you"" otherwise there would have been no interaction other then what can i get for you. We ordered our food, food came out and we got half way done with our food and i needed hot sauce so i then got up to ask for hot sauce because by now she had some other friends she was busy talking to. 

This bothers me greatly because i am in the industry. Ive served ive managed and i would never allow unfriendly people to be in customer service. I understand life happens and it might not be your day but get your shift covered or leave it at the door. We are paying patrons that expect an experience when dining out.

The food,service, prompt and efficient service was impeccable. Our server, Armando, was beyond attentive and knowledgeable. The GM and Manager, Manuel and Carlos were equally hospitable to not only us but, all the customers dining. Everyone helped out with serving, cleaning and seating that this was the best teamwork I have seen in any restaurant so far. Round of applause to this restaurant and we hope to see another location up by our neck of the woods soon. Affordability meets Quality!! Bravo!!! You have gained a couple of regulars and many more to follow us..
First review below but, I want to state that our complaint was with the service not the food...
My husband suggested this place because he heard the food was good. So, we were first timers here. May I just say that the food would've tasted so much better had we had good customer service and hot food. When we walked through the door, there was no greeting. The hostess walked passed us to seat another person. It is Sunday and there were only 4 tables with people... meaning they were not busy at all. They had one hostess, one bartender, and about 6 people maybe more in the kitchen. So, the hostess comes back and she seats us. We wait about five minutes, then we get served our water. Again, this is our first time, so we start asking the person serving our drinks to us about their sauce and options about the menu and he was clueless. So, I ask him ""Are you our server?"" and he says ""Ah, good question"" smiles and walks away. So, we wait another 15minutes, looking at the menu... then the hostess who sat us comes over and to our surprise, she is also our server. So, we start asking about the menu & order our food. Now, I don't know who hasn't been to a Mexican restaurant but, normally when you order Chips & Salsa (which wasn't free) you get it before your meal comes out. So, we are talking, having conversation and about another half hour later, No Chips , No Salsa or my extra side of Refried Beans. So, we get caught up in conversation again... another 15minutes goes by, and our food arrives.. not hot but lukewarm... and still No Chips or salsa. So, assuming they forgot, I told the guy who served us our food to just cancel the Chips, Salsa and Refried beans... he says ""Oh, you ordered Chips& Salsa? I'll get it now"" ... he then goes to the hostess/Server and tells her. Then, comes back to me and says ""So you sure you wanted to cancel the chips & salsa?"" I say yes and he apologizes. Mind you, only one other table sat down after us making a total of 6 tables filled now. In addition, our hostess/server did not check on us at all until the middle of our lunch. She did not apologize for the mistake in our chips&salsa order either. The table that sat waaayyyy after us also got their food before us. The only time our supposedly hostess/server was nice was as the end , when we asked for the check and a to go box. Don't get me wrong, the food here is good and I wish the service was better. I have a background in customer service and management and if this was my restaurant, I would want someone to let me know what I could do to improve it. Well, this is me telling them what needs to improve. I only gave this place 2 stars for 1) the food and 2) because I feel bad that I can't give more. Normally, I take pictures of the decor, menu and the food but, I was distracted by the lack in customer service that I just wanted to hurry up and eat and leave.",41hC-Wuw5229lYdog_kUHw,1,1,5,C6XrsS3PZRvNf7f9EuXVlg

The staff was friendly and we were given a table and menus. Drinks were ordered and appetizers were on its way.

The first to arrive were our chips & salsa (green & red salsa) - but the shining star was the guacamole! We liked it so much, we had to order additional portions.

The next appetizer that arrived was the Bacon Wrapped Jalepeños! Wow! Mild sweet Jalapeños wrapped in smokey bacon. The name alone should have you salivating already! This is the other shining star of the appetizer menu!

The food arrived for our party and I remember how everyone was commenting on how fresh the tortillas were and hailing the guacamole as an encore.

I ordered the hamburger with guacamole & creme. It came with a side of chips and cheese sauce (homemade!!) my birder was awesome - though they did forget the guacamole creme, but quickly redeemed themselves by giving me some on the side.

We stayed and enjoyed our food and conversation. The staff were pleasant and nice. We even took a selfie with one member of the waitstaff!

They had the usual options like Dogfish and Ballas Point that you can find easily throughout Las Vegas restaurants and stores, but they also had rarer varieties like Stone specialties, Evil Twin, and an extensive bottle list.

I came to have a few beers after work with some others and I guess we missed the Happy Hour, but supposedly it ends at 6:00PM.  My main complaint is the seating issue I encountered.  We had trouble finding a seat immediately so we decided to go to the bar and still put our name down for a supposed 10 minute wait.  20 minutes later we finally got seated, though we noticed 3 separate tables throughout the restaurant stay open the entire time.  We never got updates from the hostess and those tables stayed open (on a Friday night) for the entire 1-2 hours we were there.

For a nice beer with a crowd of younger, working class people, this is your palce near the Corporate sector of town.  The prices are more in line with the strip, however.  I have not been for Happy Hour and do not know the deal, but I would be back.  Just don't expect the service to blow you away.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,wbx0g7Yf3Kpt7CbQn-9D0Q

The tacos were better than average. My taco standard is fairly high though. I thought the lengua tasted a little gamey, but the pastor and carnitas were good. I also thought it a little odd that the hot sauces are chilled. We also got the queso, which was awesome.

Also of note, the taco trays can be flipped upside down to accommodate 2 or 3 tacos! I'm guessing other people knew that already, but it kinda blew my mind.

Just walking distance from each other, I'm so glad they did.

First thing I noticed, obviously, was the outside seating. Very casual and fun vibe to hang out with friends.
Inside, it's dim with religious candles acting as ceiling lights, giving this place a ""dia de los muertos"" kind of feel.

I sat at the bar.  Comfortable bar stools and enough space to enjoy dinner without feeling crammed.  
Immediately I was greeted and had a menu in front of me.  

They have a full bar and a variety of margaritas, with happy hour specials, and Taco Tuesday discounts.
I started with a Passion Fruit Margarita and absolutely loved it.   Great balance between tequila and the fruit, keeping the tartness of it.

Even though it was Taco Tuesday, I went with a Shrimp Quesadilla.  Excellent choice.  Generous amount of delicious shrimp, with perfectly melted cheese, and a small side of salad and guacamole, if you want to add to the quesadilla or eat on its own.  

Before I was done, I had to try one more margarita.  This time I went with the Jalapeño one.  Another winner.  

Drinks and food were great but, what I liked most about this place was the service.  I went by myself and not even for a second did it feel like it.

Tacos are only half of the name though and the beer list almost out shone the tacos. Rare and flavorful beers from all over. Yes, you could drink the common mexican beer, but why when their are so many amazing flavors to try.

The chips were stale (I dunno how that even happens?), and the tacos were uneatable. No flavor whatsoever, and the ingredients seemed a day old. The final straw was when I opened my al pastor taco and saw a single piece of cilantro! Just one piece! These cooks bestowed no pride or effort into making these tacos, I would have been better served at TacoBell (and I hate saying it). My only mistake was taking my food to go, or else I would have demanded my money back!

Our server Frank was awesome, he went over everything to show us how the menu was laid out, what was in each dish, and his personal recommendations. 

He made the dinner that much better so a big thank you to Frank.

I saw Melissa Y. check in here and I've always passed it while driving on Paradise so I thought hey why not give them a try. I can certainly say this is a young hipster-y vive of a Mexican joint. Can't exactly say the ambiance nor the food is your Abuela's authentic Mexican cooking, but a bit more Americanized and modern. I ordered the Baja fish taco, veggie taco with chips and salsa on the side. I enjoyed both tacos they were both pretty stuffed. The guac was a bit more ""whipped"" than I prefer, but once again this a modern fix on the tacos. This was all I ordered and it came out to $9 and some change. I was pretty full, so I did get my money's worth. I didn't order any drinks, but plan on doing so the next time I come. I sat at the bar and the bartender was okay for the most part but was just kind of whatever.

If anything isn't right with the food they fix it asap.  Now, the tacos.  Mouth watering right now as I think about the tacos I ate on this past Tuesday.  I had the Barbacoa, El Pastor and Chorizo tacos.  Melt in your mouth with explosive flavors.  It should be noted you can see a lady pressing tortillas inside the restaurant behind glass.   So that alone tells you they're fresh.  

I started with chips and salsa.  Fresh tasting warm and crispy tortilla chips.  The red and green lime cilantro sauce is a must.  

Drinks were micheladas that were on point with a Cadillac Margarita that was sweet and strong.  

Tacos and Beer is a must for those who visit and live here in Las Vegas.  Now for that person who has yet to find a taco place that's not white washed or fake Mexican made this is the place you will need.  

Back to the tacos.  Every single time they are packed with whatever meat you order.  It's all in the toppings and the preparation of the meats.  Consistently tasting amazing each visit.  

Techno Tuesday has a DJ with pretty loud music so if you're not into that go a little earlier in the day.  Do check out the happy hours because your entire meal is pretty cheap on Happy Hour.  Even without Happy Hour this place does not have the high Strip Prices.

I squirted a little lime juice in it which kinda helped.  as for the tacos, blah.  the famous crispy taco was pretty boring and the mashed potato was gag worthy.  the pork taco wasn't bad but at 4 bucks I'm gonna put it in the fail category.  finally, the barbacoa taco shared the same fate.  for a place that supposedly specializes in tacos, Imperial has a lot of work to do.  go try the lamb tacos at carson kitchen if you really want to be blown away.  and, they make their own tortillas.  almost forgot to mention the beer.  they were out of the one I wanted.  that fact, combined with the lack of front of the house service, and a mostly empty restaurant at dinner time, lead me to believe this place is in serious trouble.",BeitdSC8JuthwhzjGrObwA,0,0,2,IINYhgc_j8R82VeQzP7oxA

I like the location and decor. It's a great place! I came with high hopes to taste the food and wasn't disappointed. The bacon-wrapped  jalapeños are good! The beer list was long and extensive but a bit over priced for the place. 

The BIG disappointment I had was my michelada! As any Mexican knows, Micheladas are like our daily protein shake! The mix wasn't good at all. I asked for other sauces to fix the flavor and the bartender (nice girl) stated they didn't have any and all they could serve was the mix. I found it to be a big thumbs down. Definitely that should be looked into. Have Maggi, Wosteschire sauce etc.... 

Sucks to say but, the Micheladas at broadacres (Vegas swap meet) are more authentic then here.

staying out recommend Ed this location, besides me already being aware of it. I have always wanted to try Tacos and Beer, so here I am. I know in my own experiences that tacos go especially well with beer. This establishment is no different, since their tacos are amazing. The style and feel of the restaurant is so laid back bar type cool. I am surprised that they don't have pool tables, this seems to be what they lack. One can dream of course. This is a sit down restaurant with very amazing murals and paintings surrounding the guest. The service is stellar. The music is upbeat and in English which is something I like since it is old school rock from the 90s and it takes me back to the old days. 

The alcohol choices that they provide from the bar are exceptional. Their prices for example on mezcal vary from $11-40. So it is nice to see the various variations of alcohol choices from low to high; and the in between too. I ordered Coors Light since I wanted to taste how the beer would pair with their carne asada tacos. The soft tortilla shells on the tacos are larger than that of street tacos and they taste so good. These tacos melt in your mouth in essence and pair well with beer.

I am a real big fan of green chili's so as an appetizer I tried the green chili's with cheese and held the chili sauce. The chili sauce is hot but I feel that it ruins the cheese filled green chili's. Dessert was something that the twins wanted so I ordered them the dessert tacos.

Tacos & Beer, Tacos:  They have so many different tacos (20+?) on the menu and I love it!  You can order them individually to personalize your own taco combo.  I went with the Carne Asada, Beef barcoa, and the Crunchy.  My favorite was the Crunchy.  It was a traditional taco (ground beef,lettuce, pico, sour cream, hot sauce, cheddar, etc) but was very tasty.  The Carne asada was very good but the Beef Barcoa was a little too salty for me.  All in all, this was a great taco experience.

Tacos & Beer Ambiance:  The ceiling is adorned with individual candle lights and makes for a very cool look.  A Cheech and Chong mural is showcased at the bar and the there church influenced murals throughout the building.  Lots of dark wood matched up with this make for a very attractive dining area.  

This place gets really busy and I understand why as they deliver in Service and their food. There will definitely be future visits as I'm looking to sample more tacos, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,5,4,4,abOLhKwnMCpm3a8s_67T9A

Tacos: Shrimp taco. That's a must. You'd be a fool to skip it. Lengua is always a crowd pleaser. Pork al Pastor was one that I wasn't sure would work, but it definitely did. It's marinated pork taco with avocado cream / pineapple / and achiote. I did not and still don't have a great understanding of achiote. All I know is that, it helped make this taco taste amazing. Not sure you can go wrong with any of the tacos there.

Beer: I had the DirtWolf (Imperial IPA) by Victory Brewing and 1000 IPA by Mikkeller. Both pack a hell of a punch.

Located along Paradise Rd and a little past East Twain, Imperial Tacos and Beer is situated in a decent sized strip mall across from Marrakech. If you are local, it's where the old Firefly was located.

I'll start by saying this: Don't fill up on starters. The Guac crab and mango starter is great but is filing.

The tacos here are great, sampling variety from Crunchy to Baja Fish but the one the I can recommend is the Verde Pastor. Plenty of flavor with an interesting combo of ingredients. The servings are a little bigger than your regular street tacos so don't worry you won't be hungry later.

The beer selection is extensive. The menu has most of the beers broken down into simply categories that are easy to follow. If you want an updated beer menu check the blackboard beside the bar.

As for the service, our busser and host were awesome. The busser took our orders and recommend different tacos. The sever wasn't really around that much.

The hostess was amazing, she had a very extensive knowledge of beer and was amazing in recommending. Management better change her to the bar or someone is going to scoop her up!

SO...Finally getting a chance to write about this spot since the change over from Firefly. Ok, here's what was good. The food tasted right, nothing muddied in the flavors and clean executions with seasoning. ""Mexican"" style food can often get a lil crammed in with too much going on. You can tell that quality marinades, and proper prep work went into the grub here. The beer selection is really good. Always a steady rotation of quality beer and good drinks. 

Here's what's often not good : the service. I have actually had servers that have been employed there since it was the previous restaurant - Firefly - tell me that they were new employees. They did this because they had forgotten orders. Not ordered our food .. And in one event, the server was dancing in front of the Dj while we waited for our check for over 15 minutes. 

Telling the manager about the issue did nothing. The manager was combative with us trying to defend the servers mistakes when we asked for nothing other than the check.  The tall Latino, male night manager we dealt with, went so far as to lie and say we had been using profanity against the server - as if to say that any other mistake made by the server - was invalid. No such thing happened. 

I want to support local business and I wanted to be a regular diner at this establishment. That kind of behavior is unacceptable. 

So if you go check it out - maybe lunch is a better option. Happy eating to you !!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,15,10,2,mYavcJBK-NWo-VQkem3GvQ

CONS: 
Due to it not being busy what so ever it did take a bit of time to our drinks, but once our drinks came it went by quickly. 

The portion of guac is way to small to share with another person, it should be a tad bit bigger. 

They give you a slice of lime per taco but the limes did not have any juice in them.

As someone who doesn't eat meat or cheese it is generally pretty hard to find a place with good tacos. Yes, there are places that offer meatless tacos, but they aren't always good. Come on-- no one wants to eat just a tortilla with a few fillers. Tacos are supposed to be all about the vibrant flavor of a simple comfort food. When I found Tacos & Beer while preparing for a Vegas trip, I was thrilled to find out that they offered vegan options. My husband and I added it to the top of our list of places to go.

As soon as we made it to Vegas, our first destination turned out to be here. I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the coolest taco space that I've been. You can find candle holders hanging from the ceiling, sweet decor, and friendly faces. 

I started my visit here by ordering the chips and salsa. Yes-you do have to pay for it, but the salsa is soooo damn good. It's most definitely worth the $3. Our order arrived shortly after ordering. As soon as the plate was served, I had the most beautiful sight looking back at me. 3 perfectly plated vegan tacos were right before my eyes. They include a grilled pineapple and black bean taco, jackfruit carnitas, and beer battered avocado. My husband and I already started discussing when we could plan to come back again during our trip.

Unfortunately, our next visit was NOT so great. We arrived with two other friends but decided to order our food to-go instead of waiting for a table. This wasn't a problem at all because we only cared about the food, not where we were going to eat it at. All 4 of us ordered our food and then stood by the door to wait for it. After a few minutes, my husband and I decided to go snag two seats at the bar because we were exhausted after a long day. Immediately the bartender(Karen or Kerri) rolled her eyes and demanded that we give her our ID's. As we were getting our ID's out, I smiled and let her know that we had just ordered food to go and that we wouldn't be ordering any alcohol because we don't really drink. She immediately got an attitude and told us that if we weren't ordering a drink that we couldn't sit there and would need to get up for someone else. I was shocked! My husband and I travel to many places to try new restaurants and do reviews and NEVER have we been told that we can't sit at the bar and need to give up our seats for someone else. I'm really hoping that this wasn't because we are an interracial couple. There were other seats at the bar, the bartender was still able to make money, and she was busy anyway. I'm not sure what the issue was, but this is totally unacceptable. As soon as the next couple sat down, she had a beaming smile and loudly welcomed them. 

We requested to speak with a manager and the other staff members quickly worked to try to resolve the problem. The manager was at the sister location so we opted for a phone call instead. My husband and his friend (a Local) both talked to the manager on duty who was incredibly nice and apologized for the incident. They offered us a credit for a future visit, but we opted to not use it since it wasn't the businesses fault but an employees. It seems that the manager and other staff members do care about the customers.

Bacon wrapped jalapenos!!!! The jalapenos were stuffed with cream cheese, had the seeds they out so NOT spicy and were amazing. I highly, highly recommend them. 
I ordered 3 tacos and that was pretty filling. I was pretty basic and got the carne asada, beef barbacoa and baja fish. The baja fish was the BEST. Best fish tacos I've ever had- next time I'm ordering 3 of these. They were stuffed and the fish was so thick, breaded lightly and perfect. None of that all breading, little meat stuff you get at other taco joints. This was a FAT fish.

Rather then having plates the tacos are are alacart. The al pastor taco was my favorite, but nothing we tried was short of a 4 to 5 star taco.

FOR THE FOOD: 3.5 STARS
The tacos were unique, but it doesn't beat the original Mexican taco places around Las Vegas. I don't like how some tacos use ground beef or pork (ex. the al pastor) tacos. Overall, the tacos tasted good, and I particularly liked the vegetarian tacos a lot. The refried beans were awesome! The drinks are TOO EXPENSIVE for what they provide. $8 for a margarita, I had assumed that it would at least come in a tall glass, but instead, it comes in a small 8 oz. glass.

FOR THE SERVICE: 5 STARS
The service was perfect. Our server was very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Only criticism, was that, every time we have gone there, there was always been one missing taco. Every time. Maybe it's just a miscommunication.

FOR THE DECORATION: 1 STAR
Some of the stuff is questionable. I like the unique pop culture components. However, the religious components mixed with the alcohol theme is tasteless. Even for non-religous customers, it can be offending and disrespectful, because it is blasphemy. I hope the artists of the restaurant reconsider their theme. I think it's particularly disrespects a religion when you have Mother Mary eating a taco and being surrounded with alcohol. Not to be one of those overly sensitive trolls that get ""offended"" with everything, but I like to courteous of other beliefs. If that done to others, I am sure it would be very disappointing to them as well.",Yxtso_x5WiCqb71j9hNaEA,1,0,3,ff_vHPd7PkL32AfAKLf4cg

The tacos are delicious and creative! Between the 4 people in our group, we shared about 15 tacos. 

We mentioned to the server that our friend has a shellfish allergy. Pretty standard allergy. The server seemed flustered and said our friend would have to sign a waiver. This is ridiculous! If a restaurant does not know the protocol when it comes to allergies how are they still open? No restaurant should require you to sign a waiver because of an allergy. The server was not very professional and did not smile once. He seemed to hate being there, which didn't ruin our time, we just felt bad for him. We found out which tacos our friend couldn't have after the server went back and forth to the kitchen a few times. He didn't seem to know how the food was made, which is embarrassing for him and the management for not training their staff thoroughly. We found out that they fry the fish in the same oil they put everything else in, which is not only gross because the other stuff tastes fishy, but it could potentially hurt someone very badly if they weren't aware of this.

First, the environment is very fun. It's a great social spots to bring friends, enjoy delicious foods and hang out.

Their decoration is also sick, with candles floating on top and some funny Hispanic artwork.

Second, the service is great. The staff is very friendly and the waiters never left me thirsty. The food and drinks came out very quickly as well.

4720966,2017-05-03,0,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,"This place has a huge selection of tacos and beer (big surprise given the name, huh?). It was actually pretty good over all, though this isn't the place to go if you just like good simple street tacos. This place definitely targets the hipster/trendy crowd, and the menu (and prices) reflect that.

The menu has at least twenty types of tacos, ranging from the basics to more fusion style. The have carne asada, the classic crunchy taco, carnitas, al pastor, etc... along with unusual things like bbq beef. By far their most original creations were their vegan tacos, which actually blew me away (at least the ones we tried).

Since this was our first time here my wife and I ordered way too many tacos to sample their menu. It was taco Tuesday, so all the tacos were 50 cents off. The tacos range in price from $2.70 to $3.70, which seemed a little pricy. However, when the tacos arrived I was surprise by how large they were, so they are worth the price. It was obvious upon their arrival that we had over ordered, as all the tacos also had good portions of meat in them instead of piles of lettuce and other toppings.

The tacos themselves were a mixed bag. We tried 14 (yes, I know that's way too much for two people) different tacos. I loved the carne asada, though my wife didn't. I also really liked the chicken Asada and their vegan tacos blew me away. In particular their jackfruit carnitas taco was amazing! I would have sworn it was meat! The flavor was awesome and if your vegan or vegetarian you have to check this place out. My wife and I both agreed that our favorite taco was the pork shoulder though, which will be a must have every time we return here in the future.

There were only a few tacos we didn't care for. The crunchy chicken and bbq beef were both disappointing. The bbq sauce was too sweat and the both these tacos had mashed potatoes at the bottom, which just didn't work. We also didn't care for the chili verde, which was two stringy and the green sauce was overpowering.

One other thing I should point out I didn't like, and its something simple. First of all, I have never liked Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa, but if you do, they should at least be good. The chips tasted like they came out of any bag you bought at a grocery store and their salsas were blah. Right before our tacos came out they brought out three bottles of home made sauces, which were far better than the salsa. The sauces should have just come out with the chips to make them better. For a place that is supposed to be higher end they really should have been better.

I almost forgot, we got the Choco Tacos for desert. You get two desert tacos for $5, and they were so worth it! They were homemade with horchata ice cream (which tasted like homemade vanilla, which is a compliment). This was a highlight of our meal. I highly recommend them. A perfect desert for two people.

Their beer selection was a nice selection of craft, with most beers in the $6 to $8 range. If your into craft, and don't mind the slightly high price, this is a good place to check out.

So in summary, if you want to check out a higher end taco shop, this is a decent place. Don't get the chips and salsa and don't be afraid to try the amazing vegan tacos.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,4,TDVJTJcZNJ-qgyenWfDk6g

Yes- definitely get the Baja tacos - for those who don't know what that traditionally is, it's beer battered white fish with some form of slaw and salsa. I'd say they executed it pretty darn well~ fish was perfectly crisp and soft inside and their avocado sauce accented the fish well. 

No-  don't do the carnitas - they were lacking flavor and crisp usually from being broiled. I was sadly disappointed by these soggy carnitas tacos and do not recommend.",2ZAGNRs2kmUk1H2BOW_3OA,3,1,4,F_cI-z9WlLbcY4CNF2krOQ

Tonight is ""Techno Taco Tuesday,"" and I guess they have started a new cover fee program, charging $5 per person to enter the restaurant. Huh? I just want my veggie tacos. I'm not a fan of techno music at all. I am not here to party. We just want to eat. I've never before heard of a place putting an extra charge to enter the restaurant on top of buying food and drinks. Even the top nightclubs in town don't charge cover if you get a table! The cover charge amount is not the issue...yes, we did pay the extra $10 so we could get our food and drinks. My issue is the principle! They are taking advantage of people that just want to eat at the restaurant. They should just charge the people trying to party, not the people that are just trying to eat. 

Old review: My boyfriend & I came in on Nacho House Sundays last Sunday night around 1am. We have recently been cutting down our meat consumption so we gave the veggie tacos a try this time. We each got a beef taco and 2 veggie tacos. OH MY GOD! The veggie tacos were by far the best ever! We both preferred them to our usual favorites. You know a restaurant is good when their veggie dishes are just as good as their meat dishes! The food is always solid here, and the drinks are usually on point as well. 
I have complained in the past about the volume of the music, but this time it was low enough that we could hear each other while we were eating (at the furthest table from the DJ booth). After eating, we walked outside to the DJ playing some great old school soul music. I am not a fan of their Techno Taco Tuesdays, but man do I LOVE their Nacho House Sundays! We ended up staying an extra half hour dancing with everyone else I the dance floor. So much fun!!!

Rajas Con Crema $2.70 Taste way better than it looks. Seasoned well and the cheese was delightful.

The decor is cute. It's in the old Firefly location on Paradise, but only half of it. I believe the other half is a sushi place. 

We both ordered a veggie empanada and some beer to start. Unfortunately I do not remember the name of mine. It's on the fruity list, and came in a light blue almost Hawaiian can. Only complaint I have is that my friend had taken a drink of the beer that had been left in the can, and the server walked by and poured it in to my glass of beer without asking. I'm a weirdo about spit, so I was very turned off by this. The can wasn't even sitting by me. I know he didn't know better, but still.

The beer battered avocado taco was my favorite by far. The avocado was crisp and not mushy like I half expected. Very tasty.

Beer - Good mix of craft and mainstream Brews both on tap and bottle. And no taco place is complete without a list of margaritas. 

Tacos - Wow! Great selection of individually ordered tacos for 3-4$. And the flavour was amazing. Tried the grilled fish and carnitas and both were stuffed with fresh toppings. 

Only knock was the service was a bit slow. Waited 15min to place drink order but looked like the waiter was swamped. He seemed like he was working hard but maybe a bit light of staff that night. Glad we had patience though as the food made up for it.

The Elote were these barely bite size tastings, and there was hardly enough for all that came to participate. I had one flavor of the four offered. When I arrived the staff had no idea about event or where we should sit. We sat in restaurant and I guess we should have been sat in bar. Bar was way overcrowded standing only.

I was in town for a trade show and in search of good tacos and beer. What luck to find Tacos + Beer just a mile away!

Let's start with the food. I'm from Florida and lived in New Mexico for four years, so I've had my share of good Mexican food. This is very, very good Mexican food. You can get individual tacos ($2.50-$4 ea.), enchiladas, tortas, nachos, etc. There are about 12-16 taco varieties to choose from, and over my two visits I tried pretty much all of them. My favorites were the Baja (fried) fish and the Rajas con Crema (roasted chiles + oaxaca cheese), but they were all phenomenal. The tortillas are fresh-made on site (you can watch it being done) and the ingredients all tasted very, very fresh. If you're a cilantro hater like myself, they'll happily remove it when possible. I also had a bit of someone else's torta and it was very tasty if slightly soggy due to the filling they chose.)

Then there's the beer. Las Vegas is a s**t town for beer. Everyone knows this. But this place has a beer selection to rival some of my favorite places in Boston, which is really saying something. There are 20 taps and they offer a really surprising mix of local, faraway domestic, and international beers. In my first visit, for instance, I had a Tilquin Gueuze, a Tahoe Mountain wild ale, and a Ballast Point Victory at Sea. These would be great addition to taps anywhere, let alone Vegas. Lots of German and Belgian drafts, and even some from Switzerland(!). Reasonably priced, too.

The service was also excellent. We arrived on time for our first reservation but our table wasn't ready. The manager greeted us, explained the situation and gave us a free round of drafts (it was a group of 8, so 8 free beers). He also stopped by the table later on to give us some samples of newly tapped beers. The waitstaff were also extremely friendly, efficient, and accommodating. They happily handled split checks, despite our large party size.

The downsides? Either the bartender or the waiter mucked up our beer orders a couple times (perhaps a lack of familiarity with the subject matter, since they weren't like-for-like mixups), but they made it right quickly and without fuss.

Did I mention the place is really affordable? Fully belly and a nice buzz for $27 + tip. Can't complain.",wiVHxE7FE-gEH6RSNaQ5ng,3,3,5,kIag5pCzrXu-YaMJtfWchg

I've been coming here for quite some time now and everyone that comes to Vegas to visit me, I bring them here and highly recommend this place to all my friends. But recently when I come in the staff is so incredibly rude it's starting to make me hate it here. 
Last time I came I brought 7 people with me and was basically told by the door girl that my party was too big and they could ""see if they could seat us"" and that the wait would be over an hour. I gladly gave them my number and told them we would be at Sushi Way (next door) having a drink while waiting. After about an hour and a half we went to check and they claimed they called me (but they didn't) and made us wait even longer then put to tables together and stuffed us in. Then when the table next to us opened up we asked if we could add the empty table so we weren't elbow to elbow and they were so incredibly rude about it, it made all of us uncomfortable after asking that. 

My friend (who I highly recommended this place to) came in on his lunch break and sat at the bar. He told me he actually timed it and sat for 21 minutes before the bar tender even acknowledged him. By this time his break was almost over so he got up and left. And said there were only 4 other people sitting at the bar. 

I use to come here and be personally greeted by the manager, matter of fact I have about 3 of his business cards. That's how great the service use to be here. Now they're rude and completely disrespectful.

So trust me when I say we KNOW good tacos. But this place didn't have ""good tacos."" I mean, they didn't even have ""great tacos."" In fact, when we first heard of Tacos and Beer our expectations for an authentic Mexican dish were sub par, and we definitely weren't prepared for what was about to happen in that restaurant off the strip. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager, and offered a margarita. Ok, Brownie point #1. We were promptly seated amongst fellow hungry patrons and handed a menu to gaze over the vast options of appetizers, tacos, and beer. I quickly discussed the options with my date and we decided the only way to be sufficiently satisfied was try every single taco. So we did. The waiters didn't miss a beat! To our amazement taco after taco began to emerge from the kitchen and onto our table. We both grabbed one and immediately made mouth to taco contact.  What happened in those next few moments may only be understood by other Tacos and Beer diners. My taste buds were sensually awoken with powerful flavors of tenderly marinated carne asada layered between the savory caresses of cheese. My salivating mouth discovered many new tastes and textures with every second that passed.  I gazed up at my co-taco entrepreneur and realized he too was going through the same experience.  Our ravenous eyes locked and tacitly acknowledged that our trip for a simple bite rapidly became a life altering experience.  We exchanged tacos, allowing the other to orally grasp the new combination. More explosive tastes erupted from each bite, putting every other hand made taco I've ever had at home, or in Mexico to shame.  After sufficiently divulging each morsel (in some cases twice), we concluded that 1) to say that the were merely ""great tacos"" would be committing a great disservice...2) We were compelled to try dessert.  My sweet tooth landed on the churros, and his on the chocolate taco. Like with tacos in SD, I thought I was a veteran churro eater. I mean they sell a bag of 30sec old churro in the border crossing line...but as with the tacos, my palette was put to shame.  As I finished devouring the last of my devine, sugary stick of perfection, I became remorseful that our time at Tacos and Beer was coming to an end.

Quality of the tacos are top notch and at 3 - 4 bucks a piece reasonable, especially for being so near the strip. Being a brewer I can be picky on beer.  The beer list is quite frankly one of the better ones I have seen in public. The service for the most part is great.  The waiter was nice and did his job excellently.  Taco Tuesday is cool because all the Taco's are 50 cents off.  I highly recommend the Lengua and the Shrimp tacos. 

The only knocks on the place that gives it 4 not 5 stars are three things. #1) When seating us the hostess warned us we only had 1 to 1.5 hours to eat or they would ask us to leave so the can clear the table.  Highly odd and somewhat unsettling especially when the restaurant is 1/2 full at 6 pm on a Tuesday night.  Starts the night off with a bad tone, has you constantly checking your watch, and for an a la carte place like this it isn't unusual to order again after eating the first round.  #2) was the Queso.  We got the one with meat, etc in it.  It was OK not great.  Too much milk in it and the most bland thing we ate that night.  #3) Charging for chips and salsa is lame.  Just lame.  No excuse.  Lame.

I love me some tacos. 

First of all, the decor and feel of the restaurant is what I'd like to call ""modern taco chic."" Cool vibes and fun colors. If Paisley happens to be the host, give him a high five because he is so wonderful and friendly. 

Their menu and beer selection is one of a kind. I'm loving this whole trend of gourmet tacos and this place does it so right. Tracy took charge of ordering the appetizers because she knows what's up. She went with the chips and guacamole with extra pomegranate seeds...possibly my new favorite thing to put in my mouth. Next she ordered the corn salad with a side of rice, which once you get them, mix them together! The corn salad is their take on Mexican street corn which we all know to be fabulous. Next I ordered two tacos, the Al Pastor and the Baja Fish. It was SO difficult to just chose two, they all looked mouth-watering. The Baja Fish was very yummy and big! However, I wish I would have followed Tracy's suit by ordering two Al Pastor tacos because OH. MY. GOSH. Easily the BEST Al Pastor taco I've ever had the pleasure of eating. 

They have an extensive list of craft beers on draught which will pair wonderfully with any of the food on their menu. We finished off our meal with their churro dessert and I can say I've never had churros quite like theirs, filled with deliciousness and chocolate sauce for dipping. 

If you're in Vegas, please check this place out!! I really wish they had a location in Arizona for me to go to!",LrkuATjnUC7i62ExOXmGcw,2,1,5,4iF0ASNEOd-56O6DPnHcSQ

While getting service wasn't an issue, it seemed the kind crew was understaffed on this busy night. I saw maybe two waitresses in a room that probably packs 60+. I think even the bussers helped refill waters and chips. 

BEER: I went for something new and different with the Gose Gone Wild Tijuana ($9 in an 12oz. sniffer glass). A bit sweet then immediately sour. Not my thing so I fell back to a safe beer, Corona, to compliment the tacos. 

3 TACOS: BBQ Beef ($3.70), Lengua ($3.70), Grilled Fish ($4.15). Damn, they were all bomb with BBQ Beef being favorite - it just had an awesome marinade to it. I only had three on this evening - there's probably a dozen more to try.

There's ZERO decent parking in the lot, it's very small and crowded by 7pm. We waited 30 min for a table in what seemed like a pretty dead night for early taco Tuesday. We went to the bar to grab a beer while we waited, the bartender in her grungy beanie ignored us for several passes, and when she finally got to us, she seemed annoyed and was very rude. 

We actually discussed leaving and trying something else further down the block because of this, but no one in our group felt like re-parking so we stayed. 

When we were finally seated for dinner, we ordered chips and guacamole, another round of beer and we all ordered a set of 3 tacos. I was really hoping for truly authentic when it came to the food, and it was pretty much white-washed. They were still good, just not what I was hoping for. Decent portions for tacos (I had the Rajas, Carnitas and carne asada). Didn't care for the techno dance club tent they also set up in the parking lot either. 

This place came recommended from good friends at work, but I can't say we will be back or pass on such a good review. Pluses were definitely the",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,0,0,1,12mCJ9V_3vskphozHS8cIQ

We got a bunch of chips & salsa, guacamole, queso and flautas for the table and those disappeared. The guacamole is top notch with lots of avocado and the queso is probably the best I've had. I'm not sure what all is in it but it has a great flavor.

The beer selection is one of the best I've seen in town. They've got about 20 beers on tap and a lot more bottles. The beers on tap aren't your average beers either...they are hard-to-find microbrews and Belgians. The people at Tacos & Beer seem to know a thing or two about beer so they pick out the good stuff.

As for the tacos, I only got 2 since I was full from all the appetizers and beer but they were both touchdowns. I got the carne asada (a classic - and it was delicious) and the fish tacos. The fish taco was probably my favorite actually: big chunks of fish, tasty and crunchy veggies and a big dollop of guac on top.

Second, I felt the price of the tacos was right in line for what you get.  These are definitely not your regular street tacos (which I like too).  For two us .... 4 tacos, one beer, and tip came to $21 (no complaints).
Third, the tacos were really good.  Only got to try two, so looking forward to going back and trying some of the other creations.
Fourth, probably my only complaint (and it's a small one) is that I feel for ANY restaurant that serves a lot of finger food, they should have hand sanitizer all over the place ... very accessible.

Came in Sunday afternoon for a quick bite to eat at the recommendation of a friend. Within our group of four, none of us had been there before but were all happy with the food. 

We had a couple of instances where our server may have gotten overwhelmed. We were her first table, but quickly picked up 3-5 more tables and that could have crossed her threshold of comfort. She was VERY sweet and we did not pressure her. From our table, three of us had been bartenders/servers so although we were understanding, our expectations were higher. 

Our guacamole was asked to be served without pumpkin seeds, it came with. We were given an additional guacamole as compensation. One of our tacos was asked to be served without the traditional flour tortilla, it came with the flour tortilla. There were just a few instances where our very specific dietary requests were not met. 

Regardless, the food was pretty decent. I was not impressed with their chicken taco but was very happy with the pork (had pineapple in it too). For the bigger eater, the bill can run a bit high than you might expect but you can tell this is absolutely a great spot for happy hour.

Asada fries(no pico by choice) it was a small plate but still shareable portion for atleast 2 ppl or 4 in our case bc we had the chips and salsa as well. 

Chicken Tortilla soup - definitely recommend.

The tacos are folded and STUFFED. They are not huge but so flavorful.
We ordered a few different kinds of tacos
Carnitas, chicken, fish, Asada, chicken/potato. 
I love that the carnitas came with chicharones on top of it.
I ordered a side salad with my 2 tacos. I thought it was weird when the waiter didn't ask what dressing I wanted, so when it came out with green salsa and Mexican cheese crumbles I didn't think I would like it. But it was surprisingly good! I even added on top of my tacos.

The decor was/is very welcoming. An upscale place. Where you can fit in with a Chevy shirt and jeans.... sitting around nice dressed folks.

I had a small appetite tonight, so I ordered the chiquito taco platter.  (Small tacos)
You can mix up the flavors. I had the 1/2 dozen (by waitresses recomendation) carnitas, BBQ beef, and the been and cheese.

All were good.  But I'm a sucker for carnitas.  So those were the favorite. 

The waitress, Mandee and server in training, David were very polite. Mandee was very attentive in her service.  Not only with me but with all her customers. Definitely a very seasoned waitress or just plain rocking the customer service!  David was very personable as well. I think he'll fit in well with this group. 

The hostess was very friendly and got me a table very quick. (Was fairly busy night on a Monday too)

Now the creme' de' la creme'.....
I absolutely despise guacamole.  Hate it with a passion.  But I ordered the chips n salsa.
Out it came w the, assumed normal guacamole n salsa.
No.... I thought let's just taste the green stuff. (My grandma always said just try 1st then judge) So I do.....and wow. All I can say at my 1st bite. The "" tomatillo-avacado salsa"" was amazing!!!!
A hint of spice with a little salt paired superbly with the chips.

Since I moved to town from Montana days ago..... I think I found my ""spot"". Next I'll have to sit at the bar and try to see how the mixologist fairs.

Lastly..... enjoy folks. You won't be disappointed!

We stood at the front for 3-4 mins near the absent hostess table before we began to be greeted. I say ""began"" because before she was even finished with her sentence, the person who greeted us promptly turned around and walked off talking to another worker.

A minute later someone else hesitantly approached us, and the first girl came back and addressed him as if we weren't there: ""can you seat them?"" He did; left & came back only seconds later to take drink orders, and since we hadn't had time to walk up to the bar & look at the current beer selection (the taps change & their waiters evidently don't bother memorizing what's there), he disappeared for a while.

He finally reemerged, took our drink orders, said ""that's it?"" and in the 4 secs it took us process & say ""um, just to drink, yeah, but food wise..."" he was gone again. He didn't come back until later in the evening. I say ""evening"" because the whole experience of ordering & receiving 2 drinks & 4 tacos took nearly two hours.

A different guy walked over 10-15 mins later and asked if we were OK. I told him we wanted to order food, to which he replied, ""oh, I'm just filling in, I'll be back."" Why did you ask if you weren't expecting to have to do anything about it? To his credit, he did come right back and take our order, and you could tell that he probably had just been called over from Firefly to help out; he was the most communicative out of all the employees we encountered. He checked on our still absent drinks for us and apologized for the wait.

Meanwhile, it was still 30 mins or so before 2 of our 4 tacos were finally delivered. It was another 10-15 mins or so before someone else (who'd also apparently just arrived) came by and asked how we were doing. I said we were still waiting on half our order, and he went to check on it. It was another several mins before the other two got delivered -- and one was missing half of the ingredients the menu said came on it. I finally got someone's attention and let them know. He brought it back to the kitchen window, where one of the cooks dumped a small dollop of salsa & avocado pieces on it, & it was brought back and put in front of me by the first waiter kid, who turned & left again without so much as an apology.

By this time I'm kind of over it all, so when the guy who also apparently just got there came back over to ask how everything was, I told him how there'd been several misses over the course of our time there and I really couldn't see myself coming back. He apologized & said he'd just gotten there (yeah, I gathered that much), and next time he came by he said he'd take care of our food. The 4 tacos cost less than our 2 drinks, so I guess that's good for them.

Food-wise, it was meh. Salsa was decent, but had no spice at all. Chips OK. The veggie and the beans & cheese tacos were pretty good; the baja & chicken tinga tacos, not so much. All together, food would have been a solid 3 stars, & beer selection is decent. The myriad customer service faults dropped it to 1 star. Raised to 2 stars because at least the dude comped the food part of our bill, & one of the other dudes had brought us a second thing of chips & salsa because our food was taking so long.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,10,2,2,KBJ91O5SVeI8D9rQycDE0Q
5934771,2015-12-16,1,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,Seriously. Seriously. This place. I just can't. Their food if stoopid fantastic. I actively have to talk myself out of going sometimes cause I would be there everyday (I do go once a week though). By far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I've tried about 1/2 of the menu so far (only half because I have some favorites that I HAVE to have when I'm there) and everything has been amazing. I will warn you though...if you are considering the Carne Asada Fries...prepare to share or take some home...it's massive. If you are visiting Vegas - it's so worth the Uber or the cab cost to taste this place!,5hF9h2B2qB-HdGo5NoSPYw,1,1,5,z-r29B0llkdPRgiHhBwZBw
5936068,2016-04-09,0,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,"Tried this place out. Food was all pretty good. Tacos were a good size and all the ones I tried out had good flavor. The tortillas were so fresh and authentic, delicious! We all shared a margarita pitcher which was also good. Only thing was service was ok at best. But I think since grat was included, he really didn't worry about us that much. Sat at table for 10-15 minutes before being asked for drinks. The place was steady but not busy enough for that type of service. Would def come back and try them again.",Y5Hl2fhl4OKvIckphulpEg,0,0,4,V7CiAjxt1eZQC2KCyg98Ww

Prices are totally reasonable and the staff is super nice!  Very helpful and friendly!  I think I've even met the owner a few times and she is very nice as well.  My new favorite spot near work.  Can't wait to celebrate cinco de mayo here tonight!

PS - even better is that I just 2 free tacos cus the kitchen made some extra..not too shabby!",cdKitdStoNG4kuS9dbJgWA,2,2,5,6qT0IzJ34mV3MazGBZL8sA
5948115,2015-05-31,0,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,"Came with a groupon that I paid 16.00 for( with a promo code).  The groupon was for 6 tacos, 1 quacamole, and 2 sides.  

The guac was great, though I wasnt a fan of the chips.  They tasted store-bought, nothing fantastic.  Its a shame since they're making homemade tortillas for the tacos.  

My wife had 3 carne asada tacos.  She enjoyed them.  I had a shrimp, a baja fish and a chicken tinga.  I loved the baja fish, probably my favorite.  The chicken tinga was good too.  I wasnt a fan of the shrimp.  The shrimp were chopped up into tiny pieces and they were served on a huge flour tortilla.  The tortilla totally overwhelmed the small amount of shrimp.  The rice and whole black beans were good, very small portions of the sides.  

We left full so all in all a good value.  Not sure if I'd pay 4.00 for the fish taco, or 3.00 for a chicken taco.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,5,1,4,vvRHjqzkXmT2uGLopps9CA

We ordered al pastor,  carne asada, Baja fish, cochina pork and another pork taco that I can't recall the name of and lengua.  We also ordered the beans and grilled Jalepenos....those sides were the cherry on top. They're not your typical beans that's for sure. I can probably eat two  orders to myself (no shame, they were that delicious) they also have a nice selection of craft  beer, so that's definitely a plus. I will be going back for sure.",JOalzQBIhSam35GzxxwNIg,1,0,5,DivMKorzpr0WN-szVWbQNA

5967414,2015-10-26,0,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,I came here on a Friday night and it was popping but not busy. I was able to secure a table on the patio as soon as I walked up which was cool since it was a nice night out. Service was a little slow at first but they redeemed themselves after. Now I can see why people rave about the tacos. They were fricken bomb! I was expecting them to be as good as everyone said and  they were right. The margaritas were really good to and I'd love to go back and take advantage of the $5 dollar margaritas. Good job Imperial Tacos! Aplausos!,Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,0,0,4,Vjt9JqI46BhrDdIQgjffWQ

5992786,2017-03-15,4,svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ,"My flight got canceled due to the surprise snow storm of March 2017, but it meant that I could stay an extra day and catch the legendary Techno Taco Tuesday. I'm so glad I could.

As a beer fiend, I was definitely excited about the draft beer menu. There's something here for everyone, and they feature a lot of very good beers per style. I didn't check out the bottles list, but I did see it was large and likely also nicely curated.

Wait for a table at 10 was an hour, but we got a seat after about 40 minutes. It was very hard to pick tacos since they all sounded so good. My favorites were the baja fish and al pastor. The quantity for the price was pretty good, I ca think, at least compared to some other taco places I've visited while in Vegas.

The TTT event itself was a lot of fun ($5 cover). I was impressed by the line up, and really dug the DJs, especially the dark techno. The headliner, Hito, got on at 1am, and she vitalized the packed crowd. Generally, other patrons were courteous and not too pushy, though some people commanded a large space for their dancing. Nonetheless, it was a memorable night and a great spot to dance with locals. The vibe is truly ""come as you are"" and mostly in their 20s.

Definitely check out this spot for the techno scene and some delicious drinks and eats.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,6,7,5,KDvJK1hwatUZPU9nwPZTFg

Our group ate just about every taco server, a plate of nachos, and the enchiladas. All were pleased. We were actually shocked by the price point of everything. 

Definitely recommend and will return.",_MdNc9oQDkphUqzRDcXZtA,2,2,5,xuGhf2lUBzn140BhoqscqQ
