Did breakfasts, late lunches, and great full meals with a bottle of wine.  Chef Matthew has developed a great menu for each. Try the Huevos Rancheros, or items from the Skinny Menu, or his Home Fries with sweet potato pieces. The salmon fillet with citrus spinach was excellent. 

The Cafe is considered casual dining, the ambience was relaxed but the wait staff was friendly and attentive;  so though the prices are Vegas Strip (you are at Caesars), it was great value - excellent menu, attentive service.

My wife and I went because she was hungry and we were seeing a show at Caesar's Palace. She got the Margherita pizza, which was pretty solid, but my meal was not good at all. I got the grilled free range chicken off of the skinny menu and it was bad. The chicken was dry, way over cooked, and stringy. I literally had to put some water in my mouth while chewing to soften it up. The asparagus was bland and chewy to the point I had to cut it in individual pieces to swallow because it was not al dente and my teeth couldn't cut through it (and I have some respectable chompers).  The brown rice was good, but hey, I never met a plate of rice I didn't like!  Overall, it wasn't good, and given the price, it was downright bad.

I had the chicken barbecue sandwich- a sandwich that features chicken with a guava barbecue sauce, cheese (I think it was Swiss), a fried onion ring, and bacon. All of this delicious middle was put in a sesame brioche bun. The chicken was tender, the bun sweet and fluffy, the bacon not too salty, and the onion ring on point. The only complaint I have is that they didn't put enough cheese on the sandwich, but it didn't make it or break it. All of this came with fries.

Overall, the service was good. The major issue that you will find in most of the bad reviews is that it's pricey. But with a sushi place selling 90 dollar sushi not too far away, I think that the prices are justifiable.",cjldIUugBhRjMdSCriDVWA,0,0,4,vzEe-IgiTAYX2UrEJX434Q

We sat on the patio and got guacamole and chips, and 2 margaritas. 

The bill was $48. Here's the thing, I am not complaining about the price - I realize it's expensive to eat and drink on the Strip. However, give me some value for my money - the margs were made from a mix with cheap tequila. If I am going to spend $15 for a cocktail, that's fine. 
But: Make. Me. A. Cocktail. 
By that I mean, put some tequila, triple sec and lime juice in a shaker and go to town on it. I can get the shitty marg mix anywhere. 

Then there was the guac - it was so cold it was almost frozen, like it had been in the fridge since someone made it several hours earlier. Again, if I am going to spend $15 for an appetizer:
Make. Me. A. Frigging. Appetizer. 
Don't just go grab something out of the fridge that the crew on the last shift made. 

Our server was a super nice guy, too bad the food and drink didn't meet up to the effort he put into giving us a good experience. I couldn't stiff him on the tip, so I added 20% and walked out of there $60 lighter and unsatisfied.

My waiter was a little creepy. Just caught this weird vibe. He kept hovering and asking me if everything was ok and stuff. Used to people checking on me once after delivering food but not more than that. Perhaps because there were only 3 tables occupied he didn't know what else to do.

Since I had only consumed a protein shake and was starving, and was planning on a late after-show dinner, I decided to get something that would ""stick"" with me: Pasta!  The chicken carbonara mac and cheese had perfectly al dente penne pasta along with a fantastic cream sauce, just enough cheese, and large pieces of crispy bacon and moist chicken breast pieces.  It was an excellent meal.

Their soup is only sold by the bowl, not by the cup, which was disappointing.  Also disappointing to a family member was their lack of Eggs Benedict on the abbreviated all-day breakfast section.  But the do give out condiments in tiny little glass bottles and jars!

Our waiter did keep vanishing for long periods of time, so it was very difficult to order additional items or get refills.  Hence only 4 stars.

First of all, it is ever-so-slightly cheaper than Cafe Bellagio (okay, $1-$2 isn't much, but still). Don't get me wrong, I don't eat or drink at places like Caeser's Palace and Bellagio to save money, but it is still an indicative factor.

Second, hash browns, much better than CB, smaller portion, BUT- you also get toast. At CB toast was a separate side item, cost extra. What.

Third, the toast comes unbuttered so you can portion the butter yourself. Thank you! More places need to do this!

Fourth, the service, once seated, was phenomenal. I believe I was helped by Ryan K, at least that's what is on my receipt, and he was prompt, courteous, professional, and checked back often to ensure I had everything I needed. More servers need to do this!

Getting seated, however, was disastrous. It wasn't even busy. Lots of open tables, but for each group in line they were setting up tables ad-hoc. Maybe I came right after a huge rush left? I don't know, I'm not docking any stars for this - I just felt for being third in line, that the wait was kind of laughable.

Most likely someone there is using a credit card or debit card reader to save or steal account numbers. I've gone there twice on two seperate occasions both several months apart. Both times the only time I ever used my debit or credit card was at this place only to order drinks as usually everything else including dinner and hotel were being charged to a master account for the company I work for. Both times I've come back home to San Diego only to about a week or so later get a call from my bank that my debit or credit card was being used in Las Vegas at Chucky Cheese and some Waffle House. Oh let's not forget Frys Hardware for $400. Then there was also the gas station. The bank asked me to recall where I've used my cards on these seperate instances and it's only ever been at Cafe Americano so I put two and two together. Highly unlikely that it's mere coincidence that both times I've gone to Vegas my info gets stolen out of thin air. You've been warned! Cafe Americano please look into your POS systems.

My friends and I went into this establishment at 3 am we had just came in from out of town and were excited to have our first drink. We sat down and were reading the menu that was on the bartop. We were deciding on which drinks to order. I noticed the bartender busy pouring Hennessy, he then walked over to the guests next to us and he didn't make eye contact. I tried making eye contact with him he ignored my friends and I. It was about 3:15 so I just explained to my friends that he was busy and he would get be right with us. He didn't acknowledge us or make any time of effort to talk to us at any point of our visit. Then two gentlemen walk to the bartop and sat right next to us and he immediately served him that's when we got upset. We left at 3:33 am that's how long we waited for service. I recorded him so management can take action on his discriminative behavior. He definitely needs to be trained on hospitality and how racism and discrimination isn't part of the service industry. His lack of hospitality was vividly demonstrated last night, I'm sure this wasn't the first time he has done this. I work in the service industry and I know exactly what he was doing. He was picking and choosing who he was wanted to serve. I wouldn't want for anyone else to experience such discrimination. I would hope management will take my post seriously and have a conversation with him. **It won't let me post the video however if management will like to view it you may contact me.",u3WjNUOi1_VvgzhcoMQm9Q,0,0,1,nL8tzWvMTmzbyWKHGaJgcw

The first breakfast place that excited me since I was a kid eating at diners on Long Island, so much so that I had to submit this review. If I was still a party animal, I could also see eating there at 4 am after clubbing - but those days are sadly long behind me...

Food awesome. The American breakfast - with the typical eggs (three), meat choices (ham steak thick and succulent), potatoes (incredible crispy thick hash browns or home fries), half dozen toast options, etc was perfect. The huevos rancheros (again three eggs any style and delicious chorizos) with lots of extras including avocado were better that I can find in Dallas where I now live. The plates of French toast, fruit, etc that went by my table looked fresh, authentic and amazing. Coffee just as tasty as Starbucks. 

Ambience bright, open and delightful. Big TVs over bar in case u want to watch games while chowing down (NFL ticket allowed me to watch four games over breakfast on Sunday morning).  Tip, if not watching ball games, ask for table towards rear by windows, unless hangover won't allow u to be near sun!  Also nice outdoor seating. 

Service excellent, too.

I have walked by this cafe for years and always wanted to try it, so we gave it a whirl for lunch the other day and were thoroughly disappointed...

We were seated fairly quickly and greeted by our waiter who took orders. We got diet cokes, a chopped salad, a chicken salad, and a side salad with chicken. We asked for bread and butter and apparently they don't have any...huh? Our waiter got us some toast and butter which was nice, but still odd they didn't have regular bread and butter (being a cafe and all). Our food came and the only order that was correct was the chopped salad. The chicken salad didn't come with the right dressing, and the side salad didn't have any chicken. It took 15 more minutes to get some chicken and our waiter didn't seem to care at all. The salads were pretty good all around and I must say the dressings were superb. The cafe itself appears from the outside to be peaceful and inviting, but the inside of it does not flow well; it's crowded and loud. The staff is running around and no one seems to be on the same page. The experience was not great, but decent...until we got the check. Obviously we are in Vegas and things are pricey but holy smokes!!!! 3 diet cokes were $18, a side salad with chicken was $18, and our total bill for measly salads and lousy service was just about $100...absolute robbery!

If you need condiments or anything extra just ask. For both my visits it seems they don't want to waste condiments so they'll give it upon request like sauces, ketchup, jams, etc. It's also nice that they have lines for people of status in Total Rewards because our first time eating there, there was a fat line but since my pops is diamond status, we got seated within 5 min which is really cool if you play with Total Rewards. The only thing I think was a little overboard was the price. I know we're in Vegas and all and the atmosphere is cool, but a traditional Steak & Eggs plate usually goes for $17-$22 at most place. Over here it was $45.

I've never tried a poke so can't really tell if it's good or not, but it didn't impress me at all.

Clam chowder was GOOD.  It had lots of real clams and thick bacon pieces.  Bacon was a bit too thick to my taste, but still it was one of the best I've ever tried.
