WOW! Authentic Filipino food. We had the bone marrow and the garlic shrimp appetizers. The bone marrow was so good.... Deep rich flavor... 
For our main course we had the crispy pata and the baby back ribs and both were delicious. I am from Texas and we know BBQ. These ribs were fall off the bone fantastic!!

I highly recommend this place. YUMMO!!!",Yttw8VCqX4vuZPa_jI5Oew,0,0,5,BBwSTDe5BeJye1uXjFEy7w

My dad loves this place so much! I used to go to Nanay Gloria or Cafe de Cebu but not anymore. I'm glad Cutting board is now open in Las Vegas.,IwBtyddRUMIGPM7PqeUBWg,0,0,5,n3OXSvSAdhVnefvSIwNc8A

Service was amazing! Our server always checked on us and was very efficient refilling our drinks.

Food came out at a reasonable time after we ordered, however they did forget one of our ordered items. We went with happy hour sisig tacos (comes with 2, normal taps comes with 3). Tacos were ok, have had better at other locations. Along with that we ordered fish balls and lumpianitas with a side of garlic rice. All together the meal was good and reasonable priced with the happy hour.",w_B8hRcgXOzntK4MFNefXQ,0,0,4,MO50sIca27WUYvwEvoApqg

The food was quite good. We tried:

Pork sisig
kare Kare
Crispy pata
Clams
Bone marrow
Baked chicken
Garlic noodles

For dessert:
Bibingka soufflé 
Bread pudding
Halo halo served in a coconut shell

All were very tasty and filling. 

In my opinion, Filipinos are one of the hardest critics. Some days will be better than others... I think it's like that in anyone's kitchen. Try it out. 

Will definitely make another stop over when I'm in Vegas again.",rvCwuymhIbaZX2oAQJKHtg,1,0,5,hzS06GqlWCauOZ7iYVtBpg

But this food amazed us! It's gourmet Filipino food with unique dishes such as roasted bone marrow, chicken adobo with plantain, spicy escargot, fish sisig, cow tongue in a creamy sauce to name a few of the unique cuisine. Of course you have the usual Filipino food too for the not very adventurous. The setting is casual and they have a bar with a great choice of wines or beer. The dessert was an excellent ube souffle which my wife and I shared. Do order ice cream along with it. The staff is also very pleasant.

233488,2016-10-10,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Very impressed with this place. Great food, good vibe. I ordered the bone marrow dish, which is best shared between at least 2 people. The portions are large. The sinigang soup was superb, again best shared the portions are LARGE. I've had both the beef and pork sinigang, I prefer the beef. The last dish was the Ube Soufflé, this was amazing! They explain the best way to eat it as well. It does take 25 min to make so best to order in advance, with the rest of the dishes. The presentation of the dishes is nice and the service is good and not too pricey. If you like Filipino food with a twist this is definitely a place to check out. 

Update* wouldn't recommend ordering for pickup they jip you on the serving size. I've ordered this soup a few times and when I had it in the restaurant the part
I took Togo filled up a whole cup. Then when I ordered for pickup the first time it was two cups. This time it was only one!!!!! For the price I pay for the soup that's ridiculous. Very disappointed",U_cGqvV30mRf9oSEivkoIw,1,0,2,Kt8T2H2VCX3p8nWVqI6ozQ

I received it severely under-baked. It was like bibingka-flavored whipped cream, nothing like what a souffle is supposed to be. I had it returned and still the same result at the second round. Was going to have it returned once more but my family and I are already impatient and just wanted to leave. I was boggled because there was so many ravings in Yelp about the souffle. By the way, my daughter's flan was overcooked and the toron is nothing special too. That's a total of 3 different desserts and each at thumbs down!

3-stars is given because it had a great ambience and it is clean; and considering that I haven't yet tried their entrees. 

Just not valued at 4+ stars, not for me anyway.

He started looking around who was available but he ended up taking our orders. After that, we noticed everyone got their orders, even the ones who came after us. Seemed to us that they forgot our orders. The server said they were just busy. Our first order came at 1:20. But it took almost 2 hours from the time we got there to the time they served our last order. We were so hungry we started eating even if we were missing 2 of our orders. We were so disappointed.

1094033,2016-07-16,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"The place was okay. Really nothing to rave about. I was really excited because i like gastropubs. But I really dont think you can hipster-ize/fuse filipino food. Atmosphere was pretty cool. We went when it opened at 4pm and there were about 4 other parties already there. A little confusing but the door sign said they were open at 10am? I dont even know. They had a food blogger/critic event and our food looked nothing like theirs.

We were given the menu.. Which were 2 pieces of paper on a chopping board. Yes, its creative but heavy and bulky. Ordered a few things. 

2 beers- beer is beer. 

Oxtail kare kare- im not too fond of peanut-based food. But this was okay to me. My friend said it was pretty good. The veggies that it came with.. It was simple yet they were the best part.

Fish balls- tasted authentic!

Fried calamari- this was pretty good too!

Lechon kawali- reviewers said it was pretty oily.. Ours was a little bit on the dry side. But still pretty good. 

Beef steak- oh man. This was a major fail. Ive had filipino beef steak before so i know how it should taste like. It was so strong, it tasted like someone used the darkest soy sauce they had. I had to eat it with a mouthful of rice and i still couldn't. Needless to say, we asked them to take it back. They were nice enough to take it off our tab and comp a dessert. This dish came out 10 mins after our other food. 

White rice & java rice- get the java rice.. They give way more.

Go back here in this bad restaurant. So first the food, crab fried rice, it's a trick for customers, there were no crabs in the fried rice at all, what it is it's fried rice with food coloring and green peas u will never taste or eat crab on their fried rice! DO NOT ORDER it! They do this so u can pay more for rice! Fried shrimp is crispy and good, banana plantains burnt! No flavor, their tofu sisig is swimming in OIL!!! And so for their sisig tacos swimming in OIL, to the point that the tacos are wet and floppy! Bibingka soufflé overrated! Nothing is good about this dessert. No flavor and the egg is like one piece and so tiny u can't taste it no flavoring. Staff is horrible! Waited for my dessert 30 mins after dinner even though I ordered them ahead of time, no water, our drinks were never refilled like our soda, no ice water for us so u can choke! I tip generously but these servers does not deserve 1$. They have a lot of food on their menu that's not available. What kinda of restaurant is that. No personality on the chef. When we came there were no customers at all. We ate there and the resto is empty! Now I know why. Their trash outside and shopping carts are visible. And that's not acceptable!

1208934,2016-08-05,2,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Look, I am proud to be Filipino, but I am honestly not a big fan of Filipino food (hold off from throwing the kamatis at me please!)... but wow, this gastropub concept with an awesome fusion menu has such a delicious spin on traditional Filipino cuisine! Dishes from the Philippines aren't really considered to be mainstream, but I believe this place may be the one to steer it into that direction -- and I am totally on board (the cutting board that is)! ;)

We ordered:
- FISH BALLS ($3.00) & SHRIMP BALLS ($3.00): A popular filipino street food, these were a must order for me. Lightly fried with a chewy texture, I would order 10 of these if they were cheaper! lol. 
- CHICKEN SKEWER ($3.00): Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned chicken. (We ordered two of these!)
- LUMPIANITAS ( $8.00): A good portion of crunchy ground pork & vegetable deep fried mini-eggrolls.
- PORK SISIG ($12.00): Served still sizzling, a generous amount of pork diced with onions so incredibly full of flavor! A must try!
- GARLIC RICE ($6.00): Had to get some rice to eat all of the meat with. Plain white rice is only $2.00 but we wanted the flavor of garlic to pair with our meal! 
- TOCINO KOBE BURGER ($15.00): This was a cute spin, but honestly not as authentic tasting as the rest of the meal. Tocino, which is sweet roasted pork, on top of a kobe beef burger with all the toppings and mixed fries! (I honestly was probably just too full from all the above to enjoy, lol.) This is definitely a more American choice if you're not feeling too traditional.
- CALAMANSI JUICE ($4.00): I always need something sweet to wash down the saltiness of a meal. This paired absolutely perfectly! Drink slow though; no refills!

$60.00 of food later, we definitely did not leave room for dessert (I wanted halo halo so bad, but we even had lots of left overs to take home)! But not only was the food very impressive, but the venue is very large with a karaoke area, parquet dance floor & a DJ booth too... great for an event! Service was great as well (thank you, Anita!). 

Hope this place is here to stay because we will definitely be back! Who knew that one day the girl who disliked filipino cuisine would be converted! :D",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,7,3,4,Nl-b18N1xTzASEMLFeOTww

We ordered pork sisig tacos, chicken inasal, crispy pata, side of white rice and the bibingka soufflé. The sisig tacos weren't as good as I was expecting. The pork was stale and even the flavors wasn't the best. The chicken inasal was ok. But I guess it was more of a single person order because it came with one cup of java rice. The crispy pata came and it was honestly the best dish that we ordered for the night and possibly the best I've had in Las Vegas. It was fall off the bone and the skin was fried to perfection. The only thing was the sauces it came with the black sauce wasnt super tasty but the house made gravy that came with was really good! You can tell they used some of the stock where they slowly cooked the Crispy Pata. Then came the bibingka soufflé i guess i expected too much. If you've ever had the traditional bibingka from the Philippines this doesnt compare. The only thing that made it taste a little bit like bibingka was the small slice of salted egg that it came with.

I started with a lychee mojito which was incredible: fresh mint, lychee, perfect amount of alcohol. We ordered a selection of tapas: roasted marrow, garlic fried shrimp, and lumpias. We also ordered lechon (I think it was called). It is a rice medley wrapped in fried pork belly. We were too full to eat much of that, but it was good. They have an amazing side salad of kale and papaya: sweet, tangy, crisp, fresh. that was so good I ordered extra to go.  Everything was delicious, lovely plating and great service.

1313465,2017-07-22,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"We came in at a few minutes before 9pm and was met by a friendly server. Since we only had 30 minutes to eat before they close, we ordered everything from appetizer, main course to dessert. We specifically ordered the bibingka soufflé since we heard good reviews about it. 
We had fishball for appetizer. Not so great. It was tough --- like they didn't wait for it to defrost a little before deep frying it. We ordered daing na bangus only to be told that they didn't have it --- but they had bangus sisig. We ordered pork sisig and was told that that too was not available ---- but they had lechon kawali. 
After about 20 minutes, we were ready for our desert only to be told that the bibingka was no longer available since they didn't have enough time to bake it. Duh? That's the reason why we asked for it early so they could prepare it ahead of time. The server said it takes 15 minutes to bake it and shld be eaten at once. It shld not matter when we eat our bibingka--- just serve it to us!!! 
But even after the frustration, We will still probably come back to this place just so we can taste the sisig and the soufflé ...

Then again, the menu had quite a bit of surprises too. We appreciated how they try to do more with traditional Filipino dishes by adding or substituting elements so it's a fresh take yet still familiar. The fried pork belly is used in a few of their dishes so we decided to try it. It was a little under-seasoned but at least it was tender. The gambas was on the sweet side but the shrimp was cooked well and they added longganisa where others have used chorizo or some type of sausage. The bibinka souffle for dessert was good. But we need to try other interesting dishes like ube pancake, lechon stuffed with paella, the silog breakfast, etc. I hope to see this place continue to grow, may the food just keep getting better so it becomes THE go-to Filipino restaurant in Vegas.",XzJY1Wnwbl-jxNnsy3QjOQ,0,0,4,cXeYcmUkOihCq7jSl5Da2g

I once again had my favorite dishes pancit and chicken adobo. The chicken adobo is a little bit different tasting than how I remember in the Philippines I felt like it was missing something so the owner Tiffany suggested that I get  a little side of vinegar and mix it up in the sauce and it tasted delicious.

1488911,2016-05-24,10,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"When I saw the sign for Cutting Board a Filipino Gastropub, I was ecstatic! A Filipino restaurant that serves high-end beer and Filipino cuisine? The business, based out of San Francisco, finally expanded into town. Vegas surely deserves a high end, upbeat, modern Filipino restaurant where tradition meets fusion just like the motherland! If you have been to the Philippines in recent years, you know what I'm talking about. This place just upgraded Filipino cuisine to a whole new level in taste, creativity, and presentation. This is the first of its kind in town! 

There are good number of Filipino restaurants in Vegas, but for the most, in my experience, there is ""no love"" with the end results. Well, that all changed tonight! The menu cries out..What the heck do I order?!? I had anxiety attack! Hahaha! The tapas, signature/traditional, noodles and soup, and casa rice?!? Oh my! If you're familiar with Filipino food, you're definitely in for a treat with a twist! 

I am usually a stickler for going traditional. I ordered the lumpianitas, bangus sisig, fish and shrimp balls, bibingka soufflé, and calamansi (Philippine lime) juice. The lumpianitas were crispy, but the flavor didn't stand out. I was given 2 different sauces, sweet chili and some kind of vinegar dipping sauce with not too much acid and with a good amount of sweetness that really improved the flavor of the lumpianitas. The bangus was unmarinated, chopped and garnished with mango salad as stated on the menu. However, mine didn't have mango pieces. It came with onion, tomatoes, and scallions. The whole fish just needed a little more flavor, but the skin was super crispy! I would have preferred a marinated version of this dish. The fish/shrimp balls had an excellent presentation. It took me back to my childhood memories eating street food at your own risk! The shrimp balls had a great batter but both tasted just okay. I'm told the bibingka soufflé is their signature dessert!  It came with a small piece of salted egg, dried cottage cheese, and an awesome custard sauce that paired well with the soufflé. The calamansi juice was very refreshing, but it didn't have enough tartness to it, like it is supposed to have. 

The atmosphere puts other Filipino restaurants to shame. The open floor plan gives it an industrial feel, with community tables, flat screens, and nice view of the bar. This place is family friendly. The prices are shockingly affordable, with good quality food. I'm glad a restaurant like this opened up on the west side of town. I can't wait to be back to try all their menu items one by one. Filipino food is one of the more underrated cuisines. I'm happy that Cutting Board found a new home in Vegas!

Well, principle far outways physical and the one time my husband and I came back for lunch excited to have the beef tapa silog and they brought it out with half meat and half gristle. I know some flips may say, well what is so wrong with fat? Gross!! Who wants to chew on lard bubbles? Not I! I was very disappointed, because the first time I ordered this meal for lunch it was actually quite delectable. It was mostly meat, and had a tender middle while it had crunchy edges which is what tapa is standardly supposed to be. This was blah, and I suspect that not a minite or drop of marinating was involved. It was pale in color and clearly something a cheap Frankenstein would create and with huge balls would manifest, as a meal stitched up with marbles of fat!!! On top of all of that, we politely with tact disclosed the issue to the owner and she smiled and said ""I will definitely let them know."" She did not hear a complaint or sense any urgency. We were not sympathized with nor apologized to, nor compensated in any way shape or form, but with a mere statement of corrections to be made in the future. Why bother? Thanks, but no thanks.

1537672,2017-01-09,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Food: We had a chance to try different entrees this is Filipino fusion , some of them had a twist that I did not expect. Paella's choice of lipid is typically olive oil, the paella's twist at the gastro pub was the butter in the paella and surprisingly the flavor was very good. The sisig also had different sour component, which turned to have different savory outcome. Of all the entree I tried I think sisig was the best. We had the fried chicken which tried to emulate Max's fried chicken , it was a good take on Max's. The kawali was crunchy and tender, 
The escargot was also new they did it via ginataan which is coconut milk with garlic bread on the side. The bone marrow could have been better executed, the marrow was just too rich for me , the marrow would be like butter slathered on the bread. The bistek had a better presentation than any of the local Filipino restaurants in the valley, they turned out to be good too. Although I was a bit disappointed since I wanted to try out their bibinka souflee however they did not have it during dinner service. Each entree were presented very well and not how the typical Filipino serves their food. The calamari, the bistek, kawali, bone marrow were served with their own fusion twist and each was good except the bone marrow.

Ambiance: cutting board had some great decor , eclectic yet interesting wall decors. It was definitely Filipino fusion pub.

Service: Service was excellent, however the temp inside the restaurant was very cold, It would have been a better dining experience had the temp been optimal for dining. 

Overall: It's a great place to bring guest over, and a really good introduction to Filipino food for my American friends. Had a discussion with one of my friends while dining at the pub. The couple  tried the food when it was busy since they opened  and they didn't think the food was good, however since they came back , and tried the food where it wasn't that busy , there was a huge difference in quality. For people that tried cutting board while it was newly opened , please try it again as it might change your opinion. Will definitely come back and try their bibinka souflee, cutting board if you are reading this review please adjust the temperatures inside the restaurant optimally so the patrons can enjoy the delectable Filipino food.",pcynTq-0cvM1fEW0oBVyww,2,0,4,TvcH9dbvIzYEHmIOKSKHRg

We drive all the way from Henderson to this location just for the bone marrow and a Thai tea. The staff is amazing and the one waiter, Justin I believe, remembers us and our orders because we have gone so often. Even better is that they played all of the basketball games during the playoffs. They went as far as changing the channel for us to be able to watch more than one game of baseball during MLB season to make our experience better, as well. The garlic noodles are also delicious if you are in the mood for pasta, and the presentation is nice. The only part that varies is the bone itself for the Parmesan Garlic Roasted Marrow. This is at no fault of the restaurant itself just means you may need to order more than one! That's not too much of a negative to me at only $10 a pop.

1633502,2016-06-11,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"I happen to see this new restaurant thru Vegas Eater and was intrigued with the food pics and some Yelp comments. I had to try it myself. The restaurant location kinda sucks and believe me the place was crappy inside too before - I've been to the two restaurants before them that went belly up.  Typical buffet style Chinese and Filipino food poorly executed.  

Wellll this place now has been transformed to a more refined place, modern rustic theme, no hint of Filipino inspired food from the decor. Layout is cool because you can watch some big a.. TVs and get a couple cold ones and appetizer with some friends. If this was in Downtown Summerlin, I much rather go here than the big boy restaurant places now placed in there. 

Ordered a lot and pretty much liked everything. Some notes Kare Kare needs more salt but the grilled vegetables were awesome, had the smokey taste without being charred. Props for the bangus sisig thoroughly enjoyed that. Heh Paella was fine, loaded with good amount of seafood, but I think needed more saffron to make it blow up and burn the bottom - isn't that how it should be.. Little crusty on the bottom. Garlic noodles were good for the kids. Liked the fish balls and had the bibingka soufflé, need more bibingka flavoring - tasted more like Brazo de Mercedes to me. Liked the halo halo coconut concept. Server also needs to be more schooled in the menu, struggled a lot but then again they've been opened only for a few weeks so lots of tweeking I'm sure. Sorry didn't like the cutting board for the menu holders, too bulky and kids starts hitting each other with it.  Oh also the tables were to small, can't eat a lot if the table can't hold all the food, lol. 

Gave a 5 star for a strong showing for makeover of the place and food selection. I really hope they click because it's a great place. Nice paint job outside and finally no graffiti. A great addition to the area, do a smaller same type restaurant by Downtown Summerlin, no competition up here.  Oh and get the website up dudes... Got a nice restaurant but no running website. 

My requests if the restaurant looks at what people say, would like churros with hot thick chocolate for a desert selection that would bring me back a lot - hit me up if that happens. No sinagang concept... Also there were jars of fruits for their Vodka, I thought it was ur old fashioned pickled green mangoes or Santol - that would bring me back in a heart beat. Sorry get rid of the cutting board for the menu, or get a smaller one, it slowed me down in ordering, lol.",LLsyjn2GZ715AwIPlWZ4Pg,2,1,5,kER8JEaiJrn8nx2gwWElOg

1716787,2016-11-17,2,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Came here on Veteran's day and was glad to see they were open.  I was looking forward to trying their soufflé which the waiter informed us takes approximately 10 minutes to make so order it basically knowing it takes a while to make.  The ambience was nice and not typical to any other Filipino restaurant I have been in.  I am not a fan of Filipino food but I have a few dishes that I like.  I ordered the pork sisig, my sister ordered the oxtail kare kare, and my niece ordered the calamari.  When I asked if the dishes came with rice the waiter said it did not.  It was $2 extra for rice.  This is when it started to go downhill.  

The calamari came out first before the other meals even though we asked it to be brought out with the other dishes.  Not a big deal I guess but shows how much attention was paid to our request.  Our waiter then came to inform us that they were making new batches of white rice so he asked if we would like garlic rice instead and he would not charge us for it.  We said that was fine. 

When the food came out I was excited to try the sisig.  My first bite however was traumatizing.  I did not know that the pork would be so sour!  It was very vinegary and oily.  I never had sisig before so I did not know what it was supposed to taste like but sour was not what I had in mind.  It was more sour than adobo.  The taste does grow on you but it definitely needs rice and the egg that came with it.  The description of flavor should be on the menu.  If it was I apologize but I missed it.  

As for the other food; the calamari was alright and while the kare kare had tender pieces of oxtail, the sauce tasted weird.  It was a weird gray color instead of a bright orange brown.  The vegetables were also gray and not vibrant and very very oily.  The vegetables looked grilled but tasted deep fried.

Before we finished eating we informed the waiter that we wanted to put in an order for the ube soufflé and that's when he told us they were all out of the soufflés.  I was very disappointed after that.  We ordered another dessert but it was not that great either.  

When we reviewed the bill I noticed we were charged for the 2 sides of white rice that we ordered.  I informed the waiter and he said that yes he still charged us for the rice but substituted for the garlic one instead and did not charge us for the garlic one.  That was not what I thought would happen but I said fine, whatever.  

Thankfully the waiter was nice enough to take the rice of the bill.  I wish he took the dessert off the bill as well or gave us a discount for not having the items on the menu we wanted.  

In summary - the service was okay, the food however was blah and overpriced.  Most likely will not be back",dQPrX-xVKLk3565zZoOfHw,1,1,2,kRajQ0ehZZTZklmLazy-Hg
1720303,2018-06-20,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,First I asked for a recommendation for what to drink. The waitress looked confused I just wanted a beer to go with the food it's a pub right? She didn't know what to suggest then every time I picked one they didn't have it anymore and finally I ordered a crabbies ginger beer and she brought me a regular one when I told her that I wanted the alcoholic one they didn't have that either. If you don't have anything to drink on the menu suggestions would be welcome but she still seemed lost. Okay whatever guess I wasn't drinking the food came out and everything seemed ok lumpia was tasty but then we bit into the chicken wings neither of us got past one bite they were totally bad and even smelled off. We just wanted out of there at this point so we took the rest to go and threw it out. ROTTEN CHICKEN IS NOT COOL. I have eaten lots of subpar chicken wings but serving expired or bad food just doesn't fly. Also just a tip don't leave the bathroom door right by your entrance open especially when it smells like raw sewage.,WkhhFMlmeuXqfv3q9lxTcQ,0,0,1,oDcAraIm8Xosv1-uhGBezA

The ambiance of this place is super modern and hip, but it's a great place to bring the whole family. With large tables for large parties, this place is suited for you to bring everybody you know!

The cocktails all sounded delicious, but I ended up with a Calamantini--A MUST TRY. Not to sweet, not too sour, it's just right. My mom got a Mango Mojito--she says it was way too strong, but I disagreed, it was still yummy. 

The menu included Filipino classics with modern presentations. My table ended up ordering the Kare-Kare, Pinakbet, and Pork Sisig. The Kare-Kare is the best I've ever had (SORRY LOLA.) It was super taste that I didn't even have to use the bagoong they provided. The presentation of the Kare-Kare was also so pretty and well put together. The Pinakbet was also really good, and the Pork Sisig had an over easy egg in the middle---I never knew eggs and sisig were a good pair until I have Cutting Board's.

Was gonna order some San Miguel, but decided to use the free thai tea check-in. Pork sisig was bomb!! Lots of flavor, the pork was cooked perfectly- slightly crispy on the outside with a nice slight vinegar bite that wasn't overpowering. Adobo fried rice actually had a lot of chicken adobo mixed in, which was a pleasant surprise. Also it was topped with some plantains and you know that's bomb.

The service was GREAT, they checked on us a few times and wasn't all up in our business. We actually met the manager Tiffany and talked about a lot of things she's implementing - happy hour, live music, and BREAKFAST! (ube pancakes - what?) Im super excited. She even brought some stuff out on the house. Turon w/ ice cream and this mango salad that went really well with the sisig. 

I think the cherry on top was that the prices were solid and reasonable. Overall, great experience and looking forward to coming back again. Start happy hour already! lol

I don't think I've ever had such horrible service in a restaurant...I understand that the restaurant is relatively new but the poor customer service my family and I had on Sunday deserves no excuses. Maybe they just had the worst employees all working together on that one day? I don't know..

Food was good but I don't think that is enough alone to bring us back... They really need to train their employees better. 

Our server (don't remember him saying his name) rarely came to check on us. He forgot my husband's Thai tea but was forgiven because he caught himself. He never looked at our drinks, we had to ASK FOR REFILLS. 
They forgot one of our dishes... Had to cook it again... Then gave it to another table... I don't understand how that happened because there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant... By the time they offered to make it again we were already done with our meal and didn't even want to wait for the dish... Anyways, they kindly took it off our bill and put it in a Togo box for us.

Our server brought us our check, never asked if we needed anything else or wanted to order dessert.

We had the lumpianitas that my son proclaimed taste just like Grammy's. The sisig tacos were a natural take on a long time favorite ""pulutan."" The lechon kawali and bangus sisig were very familiar flavors that we thoroughly enjoyed. We ended our meal with halo halo and the fried suman.

1920827,2016-07-18,11,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"The name says it all: Cutting Board (what many of the dishes are served on, there's attention to presentation and many meat dishes) Filipino (style of cuisine served here) Gastropub (they have beer and the food is modernized). This is not the place to expect a 5 pound Styrofoam takeout box full of cafeteria-style food that tastes like your grandma made it, for under $10. 

BONE MARROW APP ($10) Two huge bones, great presentation with crostini and mango slaw. The marrow and bread are both seasoned, which was a bit much but the marrow itself was good. The slaw was necessary to balance this dish. Unexpected and cool to have this dish available at a more casual restaurant, usually have to go on the Strip if I want it.
GRILLED BANGUS ($14): Large sour-tasting grilled milkfish, served with fish sauce and garnished with slaw. BF loves this dish and was happy with this version, I was glad to have a lighter, healthier option instead of just greasy pork plates as elsewhere.
PANCIT ($9): Recommended by our server as one of her favorite dishes, a traditional dish mixing two types of noodles with a variety of meats and some vegetables (cabbage, carrots, celery). This dish was greasy but not overwhelmingly so, paired well with the fish and had shrimp, sausage, and pork. Shareable, family-size portion.
MANGO SLAW ($6): More because I really liked it. Julienned mango with kale, carrots, and a few other vegetables seasoned with a vinegar sauce. Fresh and acidic, and went well with everything we tried, lightening and brightening up flavors.

Service was attentive during our visit without being overbearing or annoying. Prices are low for this style of restaurant (I am referring to their modernized gastropub-fusion concept, NOT Filipino food in general) and the portion sizes they offer.  I will note that comparing photos of our dishes to others' here on Yelp, the same dish looks quite different across several photos, which seems to indicate that they need to work on consistency.

I do not claim to be particularly versed in Filipino cuisine, but I liked the dishes I tried. Majority of poor reviews seem to be expecting a more traditional experience, flavors, and pricing, but I like that this spot is offering something different, and I'm looking forward to bringing friends in to try more dishes like the escargot, crispy shrimp, squid ink paella.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,19,4,UBxS8VaYj0mmKVlTXYmehA

My husband ordered the Crispy Shrimp...it was not crispy. He also ordered the BBQ wings - which were excessively salty. 

I ordered the Chicken Inasal, this dish was weird...the chicken was so burnt. It tasted chalky and old too! Why serve customers old food?! I mean $12 for old chicken? Sheesh, at least give it at a discounted price. 

The service was eh, okay. Our server forgot our extra napkins :(. Our water came late too. All the salt from the food was dehydrating my taste buds.

2108732,2016-11-13,2,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Friends and I walked in here at about 8:50 pm. We were seated quickly. Started looking at the menu and realized it was almost 9:00 pm aka start of happy hour time! Yaaaassss. Server was prompt in bringing us the happy hour menu.

The happy hour had quite a variety of items at reasonably discounted prices. (Of course I had to order the lumpia, lol). The regular menu also had the bulk of what we Filipinos love, items like: pork sisig, kare kare, different options of silogs, pancit, arroz caldo, and even desserts like turon.

I ordered garlic noodles off the happy hour menu. Very, VERY salty in my opinion. But maybe I'm just sensitive to sodium. I knew deep down I should have asked to adjust the seasoning level before ordering, but I wanted to give the regular garlic noodles a try. Nothing amazing.

The lumpia -- fresh, hot, and crispy. No complaints here.

My boyfriend devoured his order of kare kare. But the restaurant charges for side of rice (steamed or garlic), which I think entrees should already come with a side of rice, but hey, that's just me. 

Our friends ordered the bone marrow, chicken sisig tacos, bangus silog, fish balls, and some mango juice.

Ambiance was nice. Kinda hipster-ish but cute. Very good for large parties (PS there was a large party who had their kids running around uncontrollably, being very loud when we got here, lol). But otherwise, it was an alright experience.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,5,2,3,VzXoUKJz_Thn-SNFdrBVjA

2155128,2016-06-09,4,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"The Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub was cleverly created with passion of Filipino Food & the craft of fusion. It's modern day twist to traditional Filipino dishes proves that it too, can lure other ethnicities, other than Filipinos, to dine and experience the culture through delicacy. The concept is great...however there were downfalls in my dining experience which explains my less than mediyoker 2 star review.

Located just off Rock Springs & Lake Mead near the US 95, it's location is easily accessible and inviting to the area locals. It's building  was formerly another Filipino restaurant and Chinese restaurant which both failed to thrive. (Let's hope the cutting board survives and surpasses its predecessors). Upon entering the premises, you get a feel of some sort of seafood joint (you know the type that sells crabs, shrimps, crawfish and the whole shabang), yet it also feels like a warehouse still under construction. Maybe it does give it a Filipino feel, but is definitely different. They do have some nice decor though, with menus paying homage to its name with cutting board themes and big flat screen televisions especially for those anticipated sporting events and what not.

The place it self overall seemed decently clean mind you the warehouse feel and the servers were friendly and occasionally checking up on patrons...but on to the food...

Food was decently delicious, but definitely not on par with it's high price to portion ratio. We ordered sisig, Lechon kawali, Lechon ramen, calamari, bone marrow & Kare Kare. The dishes were uniquely displayed only to disappoint how the servings are strategically presented to appear how it should be, but only an illusion. Garnishes of mango strings & onions slices seemed to be 1/3 of the order. 

Another gripe I had was feeling ripped off. Our family ordered 5 cups of plain white rice at $2.00 a cup. (Should be free). Upon being served...we were surprised it was in one bowl, the waitress noticing our questioning looks, immediately stated she just put it together. That's fine and dandy, even though we did not ask to put it together, but the table next to us had individual cups of rice and it was easily clear to see that we were at least missing a cup and a half of rice. We didn't even finish it, but the point is we still paid the price and deserve to be treated fair and not have to feel like we are being taken advantage of. Common now, rice is cheap, be honest and not stingy.

Over all the food was good, tasty & we left with a full stomach (busog!) but is it enough for me to come back? Honestly, this place wouldn't be my main go to Filipino restaurant. I won't name names, but I would rather drive further to a Filipino/Vietnamese fusion restaurant just off rainbow and 215 which offers a good amount of serving portion at a respectable and reasonable price. 

I think it's only fair to give it another shot and try some of their other stuff. In fairness they are just starting out. I just hope they listen to reviews and customers to help improve negative issues. It's great to have another Filipino restaurant in the valley that caters in the delicacy and something new at that. I hope my next experience will be better so that I can update this review and give them a higher rating they deserve.",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,8,5,2,tNVSVBMLhVnwfgFnycK8fg

All the dishes available styled in a modern way, meaning that the way they are presented is impressive. It feels very much like a hipster take on traditional food. Some of the entrees aren't entirely traditional. For example, their Pancit uses two different style of noodles. It was decent. The Lechon Kawali was my absolute favorite! Do yourself a favor and try it! The Sinigang was not the best I have ever tasted, it was good but I'd rather make it at home. The Lumpianitas weren't to die for but absolutely satisfy the craving and were delicious. I will get them again. I wouldn't get the crab fried rice or mac and cheese again. The crab fried rice didn't have a very bold flavor at all and the mac and cheese can just as easily be found at any bar. Again, both of these items were good but not special. They were sold out of Halo Halo which was nearly devastating. We didn't get any complimentary plantains - which I thought came as a starter like bread would come at an Italian Restaurant. I think if it WAS supposed to be a started that would kick this place up even a notch more, but I was probably mistaken.

The waitress was nice, the owner kept checking up on us, and the atmosphere was sleek and interesting. They have only been open for a few weeks I am sure they are still working out some kinks.

With its exceptional service, delicious food, and streamlined menu concept, Cutting Board offers something for both newcomers to Filipino cuisine and also to adobo connoisseurs.  While the restaurant could use a little more personality with its decor, it still receives a 5-star rating in my book.

Service 5/5:
We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly.  The menu is displayed on a cutting board clipboard (nicely themed and very fitting!).  The food came out hot and sizzling and in a timely manner.  We were constantly in contact with a our waiter, who was very attentive and polite.

Food 5/5:
The highlight of the night was the bangus sisig.  It was so delicious and paired well with our fried rice!  We also tried the bibingka souffle.  It was light and not too heavy.  Perfect with two people to share.  We didn't try any of the alcohol, but our waiter did confirm that they had San Miguel and Red Horse (among dozens of others in their selection).  Good stuff!

Location 4.5/5
The restaurant is located right next to Wienerschnitzel and is a little tricky to get into at first.  But it's not really a problem!  I do think the inside could use some more personality.  Perhaps some pictures of the Philippines or some sort of artsy theme to add some character.  The lights are cute and the TVs offer entertainment for guests while they dine and catch up.  It is very spacious and clean.  Not too much to complain about here.

Overall: 5/5

Definitely Instagram worthy! :) We had the lumpianitas, seafood paella, beef steak, bangus sisig, a side of fried plantains, and a side of garlic rice. The bangus sisig was perfect! It wasn't greasy nor soaked in mayonnaise like others we've had. For dessert, we had ube soufflé and coconut flan. I'm not big on soufflés, but my hubby and oldest son wanted to order it. It was good. I enjoyed it. My favorite was the coconut flan. It was delicious! Thanks to Jill, the manager, for having us try it. We enjoyed everything we had! 

The customer service was superb! We came for a late lunch, around 1:45-2:00, so it wasn't the busiest time. But there were still a good amount of tables filled. Our main server ( I wish I could remember her name) was very helpful, friendly, and attentive. She checked on us often and refilled our drinks. Other servers also stopped by our table to pick up any items/plates we were finished with, to help clear some space. The manager also checked on us and made sure we were happy with our food.

1. I love their kare-kare and since my boys are not into this dish as much as I am, I get the leftovers all to myself. Yummo
2. My son loves their sisig. He eats out a lot with his friends and he actually took his friends here just so they can taste the sisig. As for me, you guys know how picky I am when it comes to this dish. I think Cafe Moda's is still #1  but since this is closer to home, I order here more often.

2641305,2016-06-06,27,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Extremely clever concept, but overall poor execution.

We were very disappointed with our experience here and we didn't taste any love going into these dishes. I was really looking forward to some classic & updated Filipino food amidst ambiance, but unfortunately everything fell short. I'm even more surprised after reading my fellow yelper reviews; I suppose we came on the wrong day.
 
Our server was brief with us and not welcoming, she almost seemed bothered we were here. Whenever she would bring drinks to us, she would slam them down on the table and walk away. Awkward for sure, but I won't let that interfere with the main reason why we came.
 
Unfortunately, the food we sampled was mediocre and I really didn't feel there was any value offered here.

I enjoyed the flavor of the Pork Sisig with Egg ($12) but I really couldn't look past how much oil it was sitting in. I get it, it's a fried dish and it's supposed to be oily, but we've enjoyed this dish elsewhere and it definitely wasn't swimming in that much excess oil. Rated: 3.5/5

The Lechon Kawali ($12) was a huge regret. It was mostly soggy fat and not balanced or meaty at all. Lots of the skin bits were rock hard and way too hard to chew and the other remaining bits were too soggy and soft, soaked in oil. The sauces were also regrettably bland. I couldn't find any refinement in this dish. Carding's Tambayan (on Jones) makes this dish soooo much better & their sauce is to die for! Rated: 2/5

Mango Salad Slaw ($4) This came as a garnish on the Lechon Kawali plate and we enjoyed the refreshing flavor, so we asked for more. This really helped balance all of the oily fried pork dishes. Rated: 4/5

The Garlic Rice ($6) was a tease and lacking aromatic flavor. Where's the garlic? I see it, but I barely taste it. I've had garlic rice where you can taste a lot of care went into it, this one tasted like an afterthought. Rated: 3/5

To end on a poor note, we had our heart set on trying the Bibingka Soufflé but alas they didn't have any. I guess it was not our lucky night...",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,44,34,2,d8ze6SghHDD4cw9v5qvDAw

What I liked is they look classic Filipino dishes and changed it up just a bit with a twist. For example, the bibingka or ube soufflé. 

The prices are a bit higher and for some it was too much. Now a days the price of ox-tail has gone up. When I was growing up this cut of the cow was cheap but now everyone loves ox-tail increased the price. For example a decent size bowl of Kare Kare is $19. We didn't get it because we chose so many more items that we could pass this. I did sneak a peak at our neighbors and it came with grilled vegetables on the side and the sauce looked really creamy. The bowl looked like it would feed 2 people if that was the only item.

Started with the ube pancake since it was free with a yelp check in. It was moist probably due to the ube. I had it served with maple syrup but some pictures showed it with a purple syrup. Don't know what it is really served with which sucks since it wasn't consistent can't really judge if you wanted an entire stack. The ube flavor wasn't really obvious in the pancake which I liked. And it was good with maple syrup.

Pinakbet: served with shrimp. Also just vegetable version is also on the menu. Wasn't too soupy. Well flavored but not so salty. The vegetables were crisp. And went well with the Lechon kawali.

Lechon kawali: so good! Crisp pork belly with a soy sauce and Lechon sauce. Served with their version of atchara which is with cabbage and mango.

Bangus Sisig: probably fried whole sisig and then the meat was broken up and cooked with bell peppers. Topped with tomatoes and their atchara. It was well cooked. I loved fried bangus and they used the bangus as part of their presentation.

The rice is separate from the dishes.

And for dessert, bibingka soufflé. It came with a salted egg to mix in and the cream. When I first tried the soufflé minus the add ins it just tasted like the egg whites. Better with the cream, I didn't do the egg since that's not my jam. I did feel that the soufflé could have been in the oven just a bit more. It rises and kept its poof but in it, it was too foamy.... like I know it shouldn't be firm but it was almost more liquid foam.... does that make sense? Lol.

Each dish including dessert is from $7-$15.

They have an assortment of cocktails and is open for breakfast.

Overall I loved the flavors. I loved how they had a lot of vegetables and how they cooked the vegetables making them still with a bite.",1aDhu7u0T_ssAbVV-PVeBQ,2,1,4,MGOSR1waoX9_wvHsCCNTtw

The servers wear shirts that say something like,  ""Try a slice of Filipino food,"" which is clever considering The Cutting Board name and the fact that the food is a modern vision of traditional Filipino food woven with modern techniques and quality ingredients. 

We were a party of 5 and ordered 16 items (yes, 16, not including steamed rice). We had gambas and longganisa, chicken lettuce wraps, black mussels, choriburger meatballs, bone marrow, crispy pata, pork sisig, garlic noodles, oxtail kare kare, chicken inasal, bibingka souffle, coconut halo halo, bread pudding, lychee mojito, calamansi mojito, and a martini.

I liked all of the dishes and had at least two servings of each (we ate family style). My favorite main dishes (though all were packed with flavor and tasty) were the sisig and crispy pata. The acidity and slight bitterness of the kale salad that accompanied the pata was such a perfect pairing with that crispy friend deliciousness. It was also really good with the marrow. Oh, that marrow was the butter of gods! I'm not a fan of chicken, but, as I mentioned, I had at least two servings of the chicken inasal and the rice that went with the chicken reminded me of being wrapped in a warm blanket on a cold winter's day.

All the desserts we got were amazing. The bibingka souffle was such a perfect balance of sweet, salty, fluffy, and finish. The bread pudding was served with a sauce and ice cream that sang to my soul. My heart belongs to the coconut halo halo, though. It is not your traditional halo halo, but it has all the elements that gave me the familiarity of what I love about halo halo. We had ours with ube, my favorite flavor. It was served in a chilled young coconut. The best part was scraping that young coconut meat to eat with the halo halo components. 

My friends couldn't get enough of the oxtail kare kare and its sauces. They also loved the black mussels bathed in an irresistible coconut sauce. Remember to dip that buttery bread in there!

The food put me in awe and Bernadette was the best waitress. As you can imagine, we were asking a lot of questions, ordering lots of food, and getting a lot of leftovers packed up for our breakfast (and lunch) the next day.

-chicken skewers; these are a must get, classically marinated.

I'm not so knowledgeable when it comes to Filipino food, besides adobo and couple of other dishes I've had before. So this review isn't baised on ""how Filipino food should be"", but baised more on ""taste good or not taste good""

It was one really delicious, flavorful, porky feast and I loved it!!


Mild, spicy, sweet and salty, saucy, crispy.

Food like these are great for exploring and training your taste palette.

Between me, my husband and our toddler who eats like a teenager, 1 app, 2 entre, 1 side was more than plenty. 

Can't wait to go back to try other items!


We visited there a little after 6:30 pm on Saturday evening. Was seated immediately. Hosts and servers were very attentive, friendly. 


I thought this place'd be great for date night. Installation is very laid back, casual, full of sunlight (while the sun is out, obviously), And their food is super sexy.

We ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer, which was good. Served with toasted bread.

Kare Kare was average. Nothing special and really pricey $18. Yikes. It did come with a good amount of oxtail and veggies. 

Sisig was delicious! Some of the best I've ever had. Yum yum. Must try. Came to the table sizzling with an egg.

Tamarind BBQ ribs also delicious! Served with plantains. This dish was definitely my favorite but it was expensive as well $18. Tamarind BBQ had a different taste, one of a kind! 

The star deduction is for the rice! They charge $2 for a cup of white rice. Although my waiter did hook it up with rice, it does bother me that I have to pay so much for rice. We're Filipinos, we eat rice with everything... and if you truly insist on charging for rice, at least make it $2 for 3-4 cups!",Pd_9FVQPlfooE3gZFB0hcw,0,1,4,KyvK54J3Kz754OPkKxAgNg

2990189,2018-02-17,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Let me start off by saying that I have never really been a fan of Filipino food (though you would think I would be considering that I am more than half Filipino). Anyway, every so often I like to try a new place that features cultural foods. And tonight, I went specifically to enjoy a plate of sizzling sisig. As soon as we entered, we were graciously greeted by the older gentleman at the register. We settled in, picked up our menus, and I immediately knew what we were going to have for dinner.

*Roasted Bone Marrow
*Crispy pork sisig with egg
*Garlic rice

To be quite honest, we came for the sisig but the roasted bone marrow definitely stole the show. The generous portion was roasted to bone marrow perfection. And served with garlic toast; you can't go wrong. I'd say that the appetizer is the sole winner of all 4 stars.

I was excited to have the crispy pork sisig after the numerous photos on Yelp. The flavor was okay - I think it could have used a little bit more of a citrus taste. The dish was also a bit more oily than I am used to. However, we added a bit of sisig on top of our bone marrow toast and found a whole new reason to love the appetizer even more! However for the sisig itself, I think I would give it up for an alternate dish in the future.

Garlic fried rice has been a staple in my home from before I could remember. My grandparents would fill the rooms with the aroma of fresh garlic almost every day when I was young. The version of the rice we had for dinner was not comparable at all. It tasted as if it was cooked with dry rice and bottled garlic. Definitely lacking a lot of flavor.

Overall, the experience wasn't terrible. And we would definitely come back to try it again. Although, next time I will have to think of something a little different to pair with my 4-star bone marrow",Ih85YhFRDzOnB09yS__94g,0,0,4,O0O0JU4tWeat9tClSDefJg

Ok, understood, but the other group of people who came later than us already got their food as well. In the meantime our kids havent eaten yet and we were done. I guess they have forgotten to put it that order and so it cane so late. Kare kare came so late that we thought we forgot to order it. Mind you the kids order was just fried chicken.

Free thai tea when you check in but only ONE per table. 

The servers are okay. Lack of team work. We ordered first but the other customers next to us were served first. Then when our food was ready the other lady server was just staring at the food (like cmon just get it or call our server)

The only server I see that's hardworking is this one guy thats not filipino. He looks middle eastern or something. He always try to find things to do and even though he is not our server he still served our other entree.

3040677,2016-08-07,1,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"We went here on a Saturday night around 9:00pm. It wasn't too crowded but I did notice that other tables were getting cleared up so we might have just missed the dinner rush. I'm not sure if we lucked out with our server because we had great service! Their service might not be consistent as I compare my experience to the other yelp reviews. I took down one star because of the ambiance. It seems like they were trying to pull off something like ehem.. what Disctrict One Kitchen & Bar has going on but they didn't quite get there. Their ceiling fell short and should have looked more industrial rather than just plain and flat and blah. Their bar lighting is too bright in my opinion and just off-putting in a way.

Let's get to the good stuff! The food the food! The food was quite amazing actually! Cutting Board by far exceeds other local Filipino restaurants. There isn't a single Filipino restaurant in Las Vegas that would compare. It was hard to decide because almost everything on the menu looked yummy. Their beer selection was impressive as well.

What we ordered:
Escargot in Spicy Coconut
Bone Marrow
Grilled Hamachi Collar
Seafood Paella in Squid ink (they were out of squid ink so we got it in some type of red sauce)
Crispy Pork with Egg Sisig
Lechon Ramen Noodles Soup
Pork Sinigang
Bibingka Souffle
Bread Pudding

The escargot was phenomenal, the bone marrow was superb, the grilled Hamachi was so juicy and served with soy sauce on the side, the sisig was to die for, pork Sinigang was with kale and it really worked out complimenting the dish, the ramen tasted like Lomi (interesting but I would probably still stick with Monta when I get my ramen craving), the deserts were both OMG, YASS!!! Everything was a hit except for the Paella. We need to try it with the Squid ink next time.

I have probably said enough. I have decided that I will take my dear mother here for her birthday next month. I will update my review then. Hopefully we get the same experience we did because I am now a fan!",WXaREepn5cjdovdbNdPvrg,4,2,4,hmm53XIinZT6YEZfWBgYKQ

Atmosphere: Lively and comfortable
There is both neon lighting and an aspect of the Pacific Islander culture in the decor of the restaurant. Gives a modern feel upon entering, especially with the suggestion of the name ""Gastropub"".

Service: Quite reasonable
We were seated promptly. The servers were nice and answered all of our questions efficiently. The servers shared their opinions upon request and we were able to narrow down what we wanted on the menu.

Food: Lacked availability
The food that was served to us was nothing short of delicious. We had the bone marrows, which was as smooth as butter itself, the kare-kare was flavorful and tasted genuine. The thing that truly disappointed me was that I asked for longanisa but was informed that they were out of it after ordering, then I asked for another dish, but they were out of that dish as well. As stated before, the food served was delicious, but without the communication that certain dishes were available made a significant blow to my visit. 

Summary: Worth it!
I would give this place 5 stars, but not having the traditional Filipino dishes available at the start really did not put a good taste in my mouth, figuratively, but not quite literally. The food is truly genuine to the Filipino culture and worth the taste. Just sure that the food that you want is available at the start.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,4,Q-MG4Pf8bNLouv6ISijpkw

She let us take all of the time we needed to figure out what we wanted and even recommended the pancit. 
We ordered the paella Valencia and the pancit and two drinks. Drinks and water came out quickly and the food was not too far behind. 
The pancit was well balanced and sauced perfectly. The lemon wedge on the side gave great contrast.
The paella had a beautiful crust on the bottom and all of the seafood was cooked well. I love the spice of the rice itself, very flavorful.
Our server checked on us a few times and brought us extra napkins since we were making a little bit of a mess!
This spot was an excellent value as well! One beer, one bloody, a coffee and two entries only 36$!!

It wasn't really busy, but it still took them 15 minutes to seat us. They had clean tables. I didn't have a large party with me. So starting off like that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.

Speaking of bad tastes, the pancit awful. Flavorless. Raw veg. Overcooked meat. Since my cousin checked in, we got a free ube pancake. It was pretty. It was purple. Didn't taste anything like ube though. We asked for a bowl of rice with our meal, which I think is BS that the dishes that need to have rice doesn't automatically come with it. They didn't even give us the rice the first time, so we had to ask again. They charged us twice for it. The rice wasn't even steaming hot. The dishes were fairly small for the prices they charge. I could have gotten a better deal with better customer service at the small Filipino places that blast TFC all day. They also never really refilled our glasses of water. Again, this place wasn't that busy at the time.

Well since I got most of the complaining out of the way, let's talk about some good stuff. They had this lengua dish that brought me back to my childhood. The serving was on the smaller side and it wasn't piping hot, but it still tasted good. My mom used to make that dish but she couldn't remember how to make it. We had the bangus sisig which wasn't bad. The adobo fried rice could have been better, but it did come with a good amount. The lechon kawali wasn't bad either. They didn't give us extra vinegar to dip it in but it was fine. 

I would come back to try out other things though. So if I do come back, I'll update my review. Hopefully for the better.",szp2U1vmBor1N_awHyP6_w,2,1,3,J2hUEdCgIAH-EAm7FnvcFA

3349535,2016-06-30,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"For us to have a neighboring gastropub is amazing. i love the flare to the flavor, but kept the classic taste of the usual Filipino cocktail-match of food. Come visit something familiar but also have a different twist to your usual restaurant. I've been waiting for so long for a Filipino gastropub, and to for this to be next to my home-- I am blessed.  

To those who seem to be disappointed, I understand where this is coming from and maybe you should change your perspective? I came from the midwest, in nowhere Indiana where they barely know where the Philippines is. So moving to a city where we have Pinoy Buffets and now a Gastropub is awesome and truly appreciated. The fact that they serve a select few of craft beers with a fusion of classical Filipino dishes is honestly great. I consider myself a foodie, who happens to be a local concierge now. I will definitely suggest this to be an option for someone who probably lives in a place/city that is not as diverse as Las Vegas. 

If you're Filipino-American, try it! Amazing selection of a few craft brews, wonderful place to spend an afternoon with friends and family. Great ambiance!",WtDFbn3YLJ5eUkiQ6Yx_Cw,3,0,5,bJba_GUU5183W7TntaAyPg

Lola's dish it was not, but it was a refreshing spin on a classic served with plantains. I also got the Bone Marrow which was a generous portion for the price. I had the halo halo served in a hulled coconut, also a non-traditional spin on the Filipino dessert. I actually preferred it done their way; gelatinous (is that a word?) coconut and jack fruit all the way in the bottom was like a treat at the bottom of your cereal box.

We came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner with his family and upon entering the restaurant with my service dog, we were greeted right away and found our table with his family already seated & waiting for us.

The food comes in large, family sized portions so if you're eating solo, keep that in mind. Otherwise, we ordered what we thought was enough for the 6 of us and we still had leftovers to take home (not that I mind!) The staff here, from my experience were all very nice and accommodating. The only thing we noticed was that no one came to refill any of our waters until we asked shortly before leaving. 

We ordered Pork Sisig, Pork Sinigang, and other food that I can't remember. Filipino food is definitely one of my favorites and this place, thankfully, did not disappoint. It was a bit greasy, but I think that's just how most Filipino food is. 

If I could give this place a 3.5 star rating, I would. I mean if family want to come here, I would come, but it doesn't stand out to me. The difference between this restaurant and D'Pinoy Joint? Probably the interior, but that's it. The food, just as good. Staff, just as welcoming.

The service was really good considering there was pretty much one guy working the floor (he was greeting, taking orders, bussing, running the food). 

The menu offered a lot of traditional Filipino dishes.
We ordered
-garlic rice
-bangus sisig
-lechon kawali 
-veggie pinakbet 
-bibinka soufflé 

I enjoyed everything! The lechon was fried to perfection. It didn't have too much fat and the lechon sauce was good. It was my favorite paired with garlic rice. I loved the bangus sisig, it had the best flavors. It didn't leave me feeling heavy or as guilty as I would have felt if it was pork sisig lol. I've never been a fan of pinakbet (even when my mom cooks it haha) but theirs was good. The veggies were fresh, my dad liked it a lot. For dessert we ordered the bibinka soufflé. It was good, nothing special. The soufflé was cooked well but we probably should have opted for the ube flavor instead.

I would consider this place like.. fine dining Filipino food compared to other Filipino restaurants in the valley. The concept is interesting and even tho they make their own twists on traditional dishes the flavors are still there. You'll definitely pay more here than you will at cusina ni lorraine but it's worth it. My family and I enjoyed it, we will definitely be back.",JtpZw-NLL5m6BNjd0LPQVQ,4,1,4,LdVY8PAeE6jBPS0vfGYGNA

I was really hoping to like this place, too. The Filipino food movement in Vegas has surely grown since I moved here. 

The set up reminded me of Boilng Crab without the major wait. Considering there were 18 of us, the wait wasn't bad at all. 

We looked thru the menu and ended up ordering per table to make it easier for the waitress & there were 4 tables. 

I had already had a big lunch so I had my mind set on the side of plantains with steam rice. My friend ordered the chicken insala and said ""don't order the rice cuz you can eat the rice that comes with my chicken."" Ok, coooool. 
Well, 2 of the 4 ppl on my table orders and the waitress, Jill, moves to the next table ...uhmmmm, hellooooooo....half the table didn't order our food. 

Ok. Whatever. 

So I leave for a bit to say hello to some coworker who were also eating there. 

I come back to my table and my plantains are there. My friends' chicken insala comes and there's red rice on her plate. She tells me, ""idk the waitress told me it comes with steam rice."" 
Well, I end up ordering the steam rice and, I kid you not, the rest of my tables' lumpia, bone marrow, hamachi, lechon, fried rice come out before my steamed rice. 
Yes, I'll snack on their food but...

WHERES MY RICE!?!!! 
Is this place like a Chinese restaurant where the steam rice comes out last? 
I order the rice again and it finally comes. 

Plantains are plantains. Can't go wrong with that. I wish it was fried a little more so the plantains were crispy caramelized.  
Lechon kawali was very oily. Definitely fried the pork then put it on the plate. Love the shoyu sauce with comes with tho. We would take my plantains, dip it in the shoyu sauce, and boom. Chicken insala was dry; good marinade tho. 

Another friend of mines, waits for her squid ink paella and was tempted to cancel the order bcuz it took soooooo long. Finally, paella comes and the rice wasn't cooked. Hard. Hard rice :( WTF! 

***I know I'm ranting about rice!***
***i love rice, ok!***

Other food I tried: 
Sisig -- it's not Cafe Moda sisig. Not even close! I found that to be too oily, as well. 
Hamachi -- it was salty. Idk how u get that wrong...just grill it! 
Bread pudding -- I liked the coconut ice cream! 
Bibingka soufflé -- it had no taste to me. Looked like soft scrambled eggs. After we left, my coworker who was also there told me I was supposed to add the salted egg and creme (on the plate) into the soufflé --- wth, no one told us that! 
Bone marrow -- the biggest bones I ever did see ***4 stars*** the toast was a little too overpowering with the marrow once on top but, I like bone marrow! 
Calamansi crush -- eh, just order the Calamansi juice on ice! 


To add to the lackluster food, service was all over the place! We have Jill 2 credit cards to for our bill and she gives us one and comes back with the other 15 minutes later...why?! 
My friend had a crying baby she had to bring home but, couldn't because she was waiting on her credit card. Shouldn't they both come at the same time if they were given at the same time =(

FOOD:
After trying several items from their menu, there really isn't a lot of different experimenting with traditional Filipino dishes like a ""Asian fusion"" restaurant would have. However, everything we tried was pretty solid.
Bangus Sisig - definitely my favorite dish here. The sizzle, the grease, the seasoning, and the zest were all perfectly executed. Fried fish that's mixed with a bunch of vegetables and butter that's served in a sizzling plate. 
Crispy Pata - super fried pork legs with tons of flavor and best dipped in one of the sauces. I really liked the flavor but the meat was a little too tough for me.
Kare-Kare - traditional flavor with oxtail that's perfectly cooked. The vegetables on side is a nice touch cause you can dip them in the Kare-Kare sauce.
The one odd aspect of the restaurant is that basic white rice does not automatically come with the dishes. The only Asian restaurant I've ever been to that doesn't give you white rice free. But it's cool cause we end up having to order the Garlic Rice or Seafood Fried Rice which are both super tasty.

They have pretty unique drinks here including the cocktails with Calamansi.. they are a little on the weak side though. Great beer list!

AMBIANCE:
The look of what could be a really cool gastropub.. but it feels more like a nice family restaurant. During one of our visits, there was a DJ playing really loud music.. it was actually a little awkward and not necessary.

SERVICE:
Awesome service.. everyone is very friendly and welcoming. True Filipino hospitality!

TIPS:
Order everything! You won't find a bad dish on the menu.",xpaIV92-DStPlBjyfITZqA,2,2,4,NL63L1DCZcJFigQjE2-FWQ

Onto the food! Hands down I've had way better! The adobo fried rice didn't even taste like adobo fried rice! It had no flavor and it didn't even come out hot. For me my very first disappointment was the lechon roll. I was super excited to try it however as we were flipping through the menu it clearly stated that it needed to be ordered a day in advanced.... it's great that it comes fresh however super disappointing for people who yelp search restaurants and don't get to try what they hope to try! Lastly the tip of the ice berg for me was the ube soufflé, I'm a huge ube fan and from my experience with eating soufflé that cutting boards soufflé was wayyyyyyyyyyy under cooked! It was watery mushy and really wasn't that flavorful! Most likely won't be coming back and for us that sucks!

3959207,2017-04-15,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"The food was decent. But to be honest, I'm better off making this at home. 

Coming from a family who has had many successful and still thriving Filipino restaurants and businesses....You just can't mess up lumpia. Pretty standard! I did cringe when my fiancé decided he'd dip it in soy sauce. This, of course, didn't affect the ratings. 

Longanisa skewers were a little soft and mushy for my liking. I'm used to longanisa having a firmer consistency. Granted, it's different for every province. But if you don't get the longanisa burps after eating it, it probably wasn't marinated enough. 

The adobo tasted watered down. The plantains were a nice touch. But I guess my ideal ""gastropub/modernized"" touch to Adobo would be a little more flavor and some kind of kick to it. I felt like I could have gotten adobo anywhere else it would have tasted the same minus the plantains. I was with two Caucasian people, one who knows good adobo one who doesn't know Filipino food at all. The Who did know adobo said I'd give this adobo a run for its money. 

Crispy binagoongan... very good! The pork was perfectly crispy. Eggplant was perfectly moist. I hate when the eggplant is undercooked and they did a wonderful job. The freshness of the tomato and mango was a nice, cool, contrast to the warm pork belly mixed with bagoong. Green onions were a nice little touch! Added more color. 

We ordered garlic rice. Can't go wrong there! Always a good staple to have sinangag. 

The garlic baguette (ordered by my companions)... honestly I didn't try it. But they barely ate it. I'm assuming it was crispy because it was supposed to go with the bone marrow which we didn't order. 

The tamarind ribs. They were good. The server raved about them. And she is right. However the thing that turned me off, I asked if we ordered a lot of food and she said that we need to try the ribs. We could have had 3 more people with us, this leaving us an enormous bill. 

Regarding this bill. I have never, in my life, paid 75 dollars for a Filipino meal like this. We added tip. I mean, we ate at ceasars buffet the day before and it was the same price??? I get that it's a gastro pub but I KNOW you're not spending that much on ingredients. This is TOO expensive for family style Filipino food. If that's the price I'm paying, it better be the highest quality of food. And honestly, most Filipino food doesn't need ""kobe"" beef or korubuta pork. I saw beef steak was 20 bucks?!?!?!?! I nearly fainted. 

Prices are not friendly. Food was ok. Some of it good. But nothing I'd write home about. I'd rather go to Sariling Atin and pull from their hot trays. Way better for a decent price!

4014474,2017-08-15,6,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"AI SOS!  What do you say?  Filipino Gastropub near me on the NW side of town?  Less than 5 minutes away from the Las Vegas Athletic Club I frequent?  Intriguing, I must try!  

Probably the 1st of its kind anywhere in the Las Vegas valley, Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub was worth checking out!  Family & I went on a sunny Saturday morning - yes, right after working out!!  Gotta get that important serving of carbs & protein in to help fuel new muscle!

Upon stepping into Cutting Board, quite surprised - the restaurant is very nice!  Airy & spacious, slick concrete floors, huge bar space.  Yah, totally reminiscent of a pub of sorts!  But I'll save a drink for some other time.  We got a bit overzealous on the menu and ended up ordering a TON of food for only 3 people:

-Lumpianitas ($7) - ground pork & veggies rolled up and deep fried till golden
-Bangus Sisig ($14) - milk fish minced in house sauce and garnished with mango salad
-Pancit Bami ($9) - chicken, shrimp, sausage & veggies
-Crispy Lechon Kawali ($10) - deep fried pork belly
-Adobo Fried Rice ($9) - topped with plantain

Holy cow...it was really a LOT of food!  All perfect for sharing, family style!  Put up your feet folks - if you're not ashamed, go do it KAMAYAN style!!  No forks!  No spoons!  But unfortunately, since we weren't home (and no other table around us was doing it either LOL) I went with the utensils route.  Very nice presentation on the dishes, colorful and very picture worthy!  Like the touch of using actual cutting boards for some of the entrees.

Taste?  To be up front and honest - this is not your 100% traditional Filipino fare.  Most Filipino food is seen as assertive in flavor (especially in salty/sour) and much less on the color spectrum range.  But...I can say, this I like!  The food is a great jumping board for the less initiated in Filipino food, but still bridges the gap with the more familiar tastes.  We tend to eat with our eyes and the dishes at the Cutting Board look sooooo pretty.  For me, the flavors are still very much there & still very similar to what my nanay or tatay used to cook.  It really is a fusion of Filipino & American.  Yes, somewhat more palletized to the American taste but yet very distinct.  

My niece - who is about as Americanized a Filipino that you can get (aka - not into bagoong or balut), rather enjoyed the Bangus Sisig of all dishes!  That in itself can take a bit used to eating especially if you're picky about seafood.  It's fishy but not FISHY - the house sauce and the mango salad balance it out very nicely.  

The Lumpianitas were crunchy, tasty with with dipping sauce.  It's like Lay's...you can't eat just ONE!  Well, one basket maybe.  The Pancit Bami was plentiful, with a bounty of meat & veggies over the well-cooked pancit noodles.  I wished for a bit more umami flavor (perhaps a splash of patis or kalamansi) but I think that's an easy fix.  I really liked the Adobo Fried Rice a lot, it was covered in a nice brown lacquer with strong adobo flavor.  Who doesn't like that salty/slightly tart combo?  Delicious with the semi-sweet plantain on top.

The Crispy Lechon Kawali was a favorite for the entire table.  Just think about it.  Thick sliced pork belly, rippling with sweet, sweet pork fat...all fried up until golden brown?  *DROOL*...paired up with their house 'All Purpose Sauce' it was a match made in heaven.

Only real problem we had here at Cutting Board??  White rice is NOT included with your meal!!  Whutttttt!!  All this food goes perfect with a bowl of hot white Jasmine (or Calrose) rice!  You can get some, but it will set you back a little bit extra.  We settled for our fried rice & pancit...however I don't think it's the same.

We were so full from our post-workout meal that we couldn't even fit in dessert!  Cutting Board makes some really interesting ones though...come on, a Bibingka Souffle?  Yah I really wish we had room for one of those.  Maybe next time!!  

I think we'll make Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub one of our neighborhood joints!  Gotta go back as soon as I can!  MASARAP!!

4078348,2016-08-19,4,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"I really wanted to like this place, I reallllly did! Judging by the remarkable reviews, I had high hopes but it just didn't cut it for me.

So I came here with my family and was greeted by a nice young lady. She was super friendly, efficient, and even told us some specials. So +A for service.
The presentation of the food is also very Instagram-worthy. It is very modern with their rustic wood plating and newspaper design. Their menus are also super cute, clipped to a very thick large wood as well. You gotta appreciate the small details they put into their look. 

So lets start with the mishaps:
We ordered: calamari, pork adobo, lobster mac and cheese, sinigang, and lechon. 
-The calamari came out first and was delicious but my brother found a long piece of black hair stuck in one of the pieces. I'm not one to complain about a measly piece of hair, but damn was it long and thick! lol. 
-As for the sinigang, the broth was super flavorful but I couldn't really enjoy it because it wasn't even hot; more on the verge of lukewarm. Another bummer. 
-Finally, the lobster mac and cheese. I wanted to taste a non-filipino dish and once again, it was a let down. The mac and cheese was soo oily! It left a weird aftertaste in my mouth that I had to wash it down with water or the lukewarm sinigang just to reset my palate. 

Okay so I have to leave on a good note right?
-The lechon was everything lechon should be: crunchy, with a little bit of fat, balanced with a good proportion of meat. YES. Cooked to perfection. 
-The pork adobo was what I looked forward to the most and it was the only dish that really stood out for me! I was pleasantly surprised due to the mishaps of the other dishes. It was hot, didn't have hair on it, and not too oily. YES!

Overall, I think this place has some execution flaws when it comes to their dishes. Each dish would have been great, but there's there's just that one major flaw that kind of ruins it altogether. I might come back here and give it another go since there's just so many good reviews. I just want to like it so bad! haha.",2yPRCQMd2u0ka7r5IdITBQ,2,1,3,ueyEwvVEZGn2RoMwBDvpLQ

The server wasn't supposed to be pur server she was saying the server will be with you guys in a little bit, but she ended up taking our orders instead because our supposed to be server is also the cashier.

Food: overrated. They put twists to most of the dishes that some doesn't taste right anymore. We ordered sisig, kare-kare, binagoongan, fried rice, bibingka soufflé. 
Sisig is ok. It has bell peppers in it. I know it's hard to do the authentic kapampangan sisig but why put bell peppers?
Binagoongan is 3.5/5. Among the three, this is the best but it's still not as good to get 5 or even 4. It has fried eggplant, not too salty, a little greasy, but the meat is dry. Taste is coming from the sauce only. 
Kare-kare: 1/5. 1 for the presentation. Taste is not kare kare. No peanut taste at all. Vegetables that comes with it are small leafy I don't know what that is, eggplant, zucchini, asparagus. It's very bad. 
Fried rice: 3/5 fried rice like pinoy fried rice just garlic and rice but the rice is very soft like sticky rice that has oil and garlic. I bet they didn't fry this with garlic because it has not garlic-y taste. 
Bibingka: it's souffle but I don't think it matches the bibingka. Real bibingka is still far better from making it a soufflé. This is overrated. It has no taste like bibingka it's like you're eating marshmallow soaked with milk with salted egg. 2/5 2 for the presentation instagram friendly
Servers : she's nice and friendly.

Where was the shaved ice? Not very good at all. These are $10 and we ordered 2 and couldn't even finish it between the 8 of us. When I think of halo halo, I think of shaved ice, condensed milk, gelatin, coconut jelly, flan, ice cream, and nice and COLD! How sad that Jolibees halo halo is way better and tastes more expensive than what was served to us. 

Now, you may ask...""you have a lot of 5's"" but why the 1 star? 

The service was ok, one waitress stood out because she smiled a lot and was really nice. She was the only one that smiled at us out of that whole staff...even the person who seemed to be the owner didn't even seem to acknowledge anyone or say thank you,seemed snobby. The happy people you see dancing and smiling in their Facebook videos were the complete opposite in person. Not smiling, complacent and seemed annoyed and couldn't wait for us to leave...the waiters seemed very new or inexperienced...more than one person spilled drinks on us and dropped longganisa skewers on to the table off the plate... we still ate it though  I know, gross!

The second time was kind of disappointing. Almost everything we asked for, they did not have. Lechon Roll, Pork Ramen, Red Horse, Sam Adam's...they didn't have anything. What drew out the process was that the waitress did not know what they did or didn't have so it increased the wait time for food. The food that did come out, the portions were HUGE. They should keep in mind that especially with rice someone who is not use to filipino food will probably not finish it all. Everything was delicious except for the fish and shrimp balls, which they burned. Also, they need to learn how to properly pour a beer, I don't enjoy paying $7 for a quarter cup of foam. The beer was flat and foamy.

4236938,2018-06-13,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"I remember when this place just opened up I got to meet one of the owners. We talked about the Filipino Music Scene here in Vegas a bit and how she wanted to actually have some bands perform here. It was a short conversation since they were catering to an event that was ongoing that night so everyone was busy. Mind you this was like a year ago. I just happen to remember by chance. 

Anyway onto the place itself. Some say this place is kind of cursed or haunted or unlucky. It sits right in front of Lake Mead off ramp from the Southbound 95. So a lot of people may or may not be able to find this place right away. The interior looks more of an American Diner than you would a Filipino Restaurant. Mind you it isn't your traditional Filipino Restaurant so there really isn't any argument to be had in terms of design and motiff. 

The service was good considering they had an event ongoing while serving regular customers(me and my friend were also part of the event but we acted like we were just regular customers, I don't know this was a year ago so don't ask me why). Both sides of the restaurant was coincidentally divided by a row of metal post. Kind of like the ones you see where bikes can be chained onto. The right side of the restaurant was where the event wasthe left side were regular customers. Me and my friend chose to sit on the left side of the posts. The server greets us and asked us for drinks which was served after a few minutes. Then she gladly took her time to answer our questions even though I already knew what I was looking at. We ordered the sisig and Lechon Ramen. It took a little while since they were busy trying to accomodate a good stream of regular customers while trying to manage the event as well. A couple of minutes later we got our food. The sisig was good. It wasn't your typical Pampanga style sisig which most Pinoy restaurants have instead this was",34AkcX5nFt12oE5-Sfx-Nw,0,0,4,xL1cb6wpNPEPIO8OAOI17g

If today was our first time here, we wouldn't return for sure.

I had their Seafood sinigang (tamarind based soup dish with veggies and seafood which can be eaten with rice or as is) and their Pinakbet (veggies and shrimp cooked in a shrimp paste). I loved both! The sinigang could've been a little more sour but that's just my personal preference but overall it was really tasty and they gave an ample amount of seafood and veggies as well as the broth. The pinakbet was really good as well. You can really tell that the veggies were freshly cooked because none of them were soggy. It was perfectly cooked as it wasn't too salty and just the right amount of flavor from the shrimp paste. 

For dessert, we had the bibingka souffle. I'm not too sure how to describe it but it was buttery and sugary but not too sweet. You pour the condensed milk in the middle and it's just amazing. I've never had anything like it and I would most definitely go back for that. 

The service was impeccable. They seated my friends and I even though they were set to close at 10pm and we arrive a little after 9pm.

My dining experience at Cutting Board was beyond what I imagined it would be. 
I'm not sure why the mixed reviews, that is very unfortunate. I came here on a Wednesday night and It was very calm, there was more than a few customers and the staff was super nice.

The food here was really delicious.
Customer service was really good, our server was so attentive and really sweet! (I think her name is Jen) 

If you have a sweet tooth definitely try the halo halo, it is soooo AMAZING!! Its a little different, 
not traditional but familiar at the same time. I really appreciate that it is served in a coconut. Of course the ube ice cream is to die for. This is something I would order again when I come back, and yes I will be going back even though I live 40 mins away!

The bibingka soufflé was very light and airy, the texture reminds me a lot of brazo de mercedes. 
It is nice to have if you are craving something 
light and sweet!

As for the street food/ apps we had the $3 deep fried balls of awesomeness! (shrimp and fish balls), which is always good to have! The sauce was just okay but the pickled/atchara ampalaya on the side was a nice touch.

The garlic rice was good.

And finally we had the sisig bangus, it was soft but it had a crunch. The seasoning was on point.

It appears they know what they are doing. Honestly I'm not a fan of filipino food, but this place is making me rethink that. The atmosphere is hip and modern. The menu has a great variety of options. The portion sizes are pretty big and are made to be shared family style. We ordered the escargot with spicy coconut which was awesome. For our main entree we ordered the crispy beef short ribs and man they were crispy! The short ribs were tender and nicely cooked. This dish also came with a nice basil sauce which gave the dish a very unique flavor. Our 2nd entree was the bangus sisig. This is by far one of my favorite dishes. The dish was so rich and tasty!! I just wished it had more fresh veggies because it tends to be a bit salty. Overall, I was very happy with the food and the service.

I saw both good and not so good reviews,but the unique Filipino dishes with a twist peaked my interested to try this place out.

The day we came in was a Good day at the gastropub. They asked how we heard about the place, and I said, I found them on Yelp!! 

**PROs: large inviting space when you enter, not your typical Filipino restaurant setting, an industrial-feel like restaurant.  Fast quick service, and great tasting dishes.

We ordered the: 

-Sisig- sizzling and crispy!! Very flavorful and although they didn't have Tabasco sauce to add some spice it was still good.

-Sinigang oxtail- tangy and slightly unique flavor, not your typical Knorr sinigang packet type of sinigang

-Grilled bangus- boneless Bangus with grill marks and a mango salsa on top with shredded cabbage coleslaw, was delish and a something not expected. A must try and a healthy dish to choose.

-Pinakbet- my favorite and the best pinakbet I've had! Not too salty and veggies had a nice bite, a must try if you like pinakbet but tastebuds want a change from your home cooked pinakbet.

-Kare Kare- was ok, but very bland without the sautéed bagoong (shrimp paste).

All in all they were good tasting dishes and this review is a 4.5/5!

It was a lot of food for 4 people, we could not finish and brought back left overs. 

**CONs: they had a kamayan package available, but the dishes included were not enticing, wished they had more of a unique variety with grilled seafood and more BBQ options.",Ej3mCvjcwVXCSPB_avIfjQ,2,0,4,e2Yf3rrAxWM-pPSdflWsCg

Food is thoughtfully presented and portions are for sharing.  The table of three next to me each packed leftovers after ordering just 1 plate each with an order or garlic rice for sharing.

Lechon Ramen Noodle Soup $10
Ingredients: over 10 pieces of fried pork, sliced hardboiled egg, sake braised mushroom, seaweed, and micro greens.
Taste: 3.5/5 Oily and salty broth.  The pork was slightly overfried so the skin stuck to my teeth like caramel chunks rather than being crispy.

Overall great value for quantity of food and it's a clean  and bright atmosphere.  I would not order the noodle soup again but I'm interested in trying other dizhes on their menu.

The location is easily accessible from 95 so I recommend venturing here for a company group lunch.

I enjoyed the pancit, although it didn't have much flavor. The beef dish had a strange flavor although I enjoyed the onions it came with. The pollo adobo was tender but otherwise did not have too much flavor. There were other items provided, but not much that impressed me. I also didn't find the presentation that professional. And, to conclude, the experience was marred by a broken AC on a 110 degree day. Inside was sweltering, and they only had one fan plugged in the corner for the entire place.

Last night I took my wife and mother-in-law to The Cutting Board - Filipino Gastropub for a birthday party. My mother-in-law is allergic to shrimp. Therefore, when she ordered - my wife made CRYSTAL CLEAR there would be no shrimp of any sort in her dish. After her eyes swelling up, sweating, and starting to tremble - it was evident she had consumed shrimp. After some time and a lot of benadryl - she is fine. However, her daughter and son-in-law are infuriated. When the waitress was confronted she made it evident to our table that she had made the notation on the bill, but the cook ignored it.

The only action taken by the restaurant was to remove the dish from the bill. Had there been more shrimp consumed or it happened to someone more allergic - there may have been a fatal incident.

I just spoke with Tiffany, the managing partner. In my life - I have never heard such a fake apology for such a gross mistake in my life.

Three time's she repeated, ""It already happened, what do you want me to do about it."" She already knew that I contacted her wanting a full refund for the groups bill and the cook to be fired.

Here is how I feel they should have handled it:

1. Fire the cook! The fact that he is still employed there is dangerous to anyone with food allergies in the Vegas community.

2. Refund our groups bill. No explanation needed.

The food was actually good ladies and gentleman, but I refuse to sit idle while a local restaurant that my friends and family can visit is run in such a deplorable manner.

Service:1 star 

Filipino food is not mainstream Asian food. However, they are getting popular recently with all the Ube and pork belly hypes. I have this place on my bookmark for awhile ,and was exciting to go try it. 

I went in today around 12pm. Explained to the server that we are on a time crunch, so we would like to order asap. After we ordered, the Lumpia came out relatively fast. However, my friend ordered a Kobe beef burger that took about 40 mins. She had to pack that to go. Then, we asked for a check, and then waited for another 15 minutes. The waiter just completely ignored the fact that we told him we needed to leave. We just walked to the front to pay, and our server didn't come acknowledge us. Another person came to help us. 

Food wise, I think it's average 3.5 star. The portion is big. I ordered the chicken Insal. My chicken was pretty fresh. The seasoning was okay. I didn't taste the lime but just lots of sugar. The sauce was bland. I did enjoyed my garlic rice that came with it. My friend ordered a chicken adobo which it didn't come with rice. We thought that was odd. She's actually Filipino and she didn't like the dish either. However, I did enjoyed the Lumpia Shanghai. That was quite delicious.

4947994,2016-06-23,3,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"Since we came as a big group, I was able to sample bits and pieces from what the others ordered.

Lumpianitas
Sadly I didn't get to try this, but from the general consensus of the group, it was tasty. Prefect little bites for everyone to share. And great presentation too. Always was a sucker for little fry baskets. And the large cutting board it was served on, now I get the name of the place lol.

Grilled Hamachi Collar
I'm a sucker for grilled Hamachi. No matter where I go, I will order it if I see it is on the menu. Parts of it were well seasoned and the others were just too salty for my taste (and I'm normally a salt fiend). I had to get to the most inner part of the collar just to get away from the saltiness. As for the mango salad that was covering part of the hamachi, I'm torn about it. It was light and refreshing but when I got to the dressing part, it was just very tart. If they can find the right balance on seasoning, I would've enjoyed this dish more.

Calamansi Juice
Very light and refreshing. I will endure the sugar rush from this drink. So well worth it, especially during this summer.

Bone Marrow
First off, I just want to say ""Damn! That's one huge bone!"" If they can keep it consistent, I will definitely get this. The group agreed that the garlic bread that accompanies this dish over powers the marrow itself. With all of that fat, a little bit of acidity helped it out (took the lemon wedge from my hamachi and squeezed it on the marrow).

Gambas and Longganisa al Ajillo
Their take on sausage and peppers was pulled off nicely. Just straight forward sautéed prawns, peppers, onions, and longganisa. A little bit too oily (from the longganisa and olive oil combo), but very good. I would definitely order this again. And be forwarned, it doesn't say it in the descriptor but this dish contains jalapeños. So be prepared for a nice little kick!

Seafood Paella in Black Squid Ink
Seafood was cooked nicely. Seasoning was on point. However, the major downfall was the rice. It's one of those things you dread, very crunchy rice in a paella dish. I don't like spitting things out on the table but definitely not edible. 

Tamarind Honey Baby Back Ribs
Great balance between the tart tamarind and honey. Not too sweet. Just a little bit flat. As for the ribs itself, it was okay. Could've gone a little bit longer in the oven but the meat was tender enough.

Crispy Tadyang
Out of the dishes I sampled, this one stood out the most. Almost perfect. Crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. As you bite in to it, the meat practically falls apart it was that tender. Even with the sauce that comes on the side, I think the meat could've endured a little bit more seasoning, but other than that, this was one of the dishes I enjoyed the most.

Chicken Inasal (Not Pictured)
The only problem with this dish was the grilled chicken was on the grill a little bit longer than it should've been. The meat was very dry / overcooked. The soy sauce / vinegar / lemon that accompanied it was the best part of the dish, but even then it didn't help out the chicken at all. It just accentuated how dry it was.

Crispy Lechon Kawali
The second dish I enjoyed was this! Perfectly crispy skin. How I missed you! It was accompanied by their liver sauce/sweet chili (very reminiscent of Mang Tomas mixed with thai sweet chili sauce). I suggest getting a side of the dipping sauce from the Chicken Inasal! Yum! 

Bibingka Soufflé 
This dish was very impressive as it hit the table,  but for me and the group it fell flat (no pun intended). The soufflé itself was the problem. There was just no flavor at all. Two of the three (I didn't get a chance to taste the third) was just too ""eggy"" tasting. Literally it felt like we were eating a soft egg white scramble. Sadly, we were informed by my friend's co-worker (?) from the next table that their server informed them that for the soufflé, that the guest is to mix the salted egg, cheese, and the sauce before eating it... however, no amount of us mixing in the accompaniments would've salvaged the dish from tasting like an egg white scramble.

With most of the food review out of the way,  now comes the FOH service part. I understand the restaurant just opened up, but it does seem bad when your server walks away from you as you're still placing an order for appetizers. 

A pet peeve of mine is not getting my water refilled. That's a reason why I order more than one beverage that way if one runs out, I still have another without having to flag down the server. 4 of our guests didn't get their water until after everyone else received their alcoholic drink orders.

To cut this review/rant short, I will wait for the FOH and BOH to get their bearings and then come back and give them another try. #supportlocalbusiness",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,7,5,3,4Cy5wCkRvXuwC9By2IbnqQ

Stopped in for a quick beer while killing time and decided to bring the whole family back for dinner that night. I love the sweet chili sauce for the calamari. We also had chicken and pork fried rice, chicken adobo, lettuce cups, and a crispy tender beef that came bone-in. Everything was delicious and the lumpianitas were addictive. The star of the meal, however was the soufflé dessert that is well worth the approx. 20 min prep time (so order it when you order everything else).

The owners were incredibly accessible and gracious, and all the staff we interacted with really made us feel at home. At one point the chef came out to say hello to guests, which gave us a chance to compliment him firsthand.  The beer and other alcohol choices make this a great ""pub"" option if no time for a meal.

Unfortunately, their head cook was out sick that day so we couldn't order the Pancit Bami we kept reading about.  I was really sad that only one person had the capacity of making pancit.  Secondly, they were out of Lumpanitas.  Ugh, you're killing me, Ate!  Really?  We couldn't get mad at her as it wasn't her fault, and, she was super embarrassed by it.  So, we ended up ordering their Lechon Kawali which was standard, Chicken Adobo which was salty, Sisig which was really good, and Garlic Rice, which was tasty.  I really wanted to try other dishes, like their Kare-Kare and Paella but was afraid of further rejection.

I'd love to give them a second chance, as I'm sure our visit just happened to be a fluke, but the hubz clearly does not want to return and well, he's my ride.

5022807,2016-09-05,1,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"There was a lot of rave and from the things I read, I made my trip there even though it's on the other side of town from where I live.

Let's start off with the customer service. When we arrived, we were seated right away. As we sat down, we didn't even know who are server was at first. It was probably about 10 mins before someone came to our table to take our drinks. Being a first timer, we were skimming through the menu to find out what we wanted to eat anyway.

As far as the food, I wasn't too blown away as far as flavors: 

Kare Kare- Dish was great but the bagaoong tasted burnt with a slight sweetness. The 2 together didn't taste good. Kare Kare is my favorite dish out of all the Filipino dishes and I was disappointed. 

Beef Steak- The presentation was pretty and the cut of the meat was on the thicker side. It wasn't as flavored like how beef steak usually is and for some reason it had the texture of liver. I have a 9 year old and a 4 year old and they couldn't stomach the flavor or texture.

Lumpia- A great starter. Can't go wrong ordering these but it seemed like the middle was a bit undercooked, the middle was slightly cold while the outside was warm. 

Crispy Pata- 10/10 You can't really mess this dish up. Super crispy with the perfect brown color on the outside. Bring some aspirin after you eat this lol! The sauce they bring with this dish is a vinegar/soy sauce blend but it tasted too strong and had a bitter flavor. I actually asked for some vinegar instead for my dipping sauce. Even the vinegar had a different taste. I feel like they try to do a little extra for the sauces they bring with a plate. 

Bar Drink: My brother ordered absolute vodka with Sprite and a lime. I didn't taste it but to his disappointment, it lacked the flavor of the alcohol. He had to order another drink specifying to add more of the alcohol. 

Coconut Halo Halo- HEADS UP on this dessert: It's served in a coconut, there is no shaved ice and it doesn't contain a lot of usual jellies and lanka. It has the flavors of halo halo but all that's in it, is the meat of the coconut, a big scoop of Ube ice cream, gelatinous coconut and a lot of the beans. I was so disappointed it wasn't the original halo halo. Presentation was beautiful but it didn't hit the spot for me but I did enjoy eating the meat of the coconut. 

Our waitress was Anita. She was awesome. I know she was busy waiting on other tables, she did the best she could to attend to us. Overall, the staff was friendly and welcoming. I don't think I'd come back to this place. It's a little on the pricier side if you compare it to DT's or D'Pinoy Joint.

5085132,2016-05-31,8,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"A modern take on Filipino cuisine! Cutting Board offers traditional Filipino dishes with a twist, as well as a mix of American, Spanish and Asian flavors. 

Lumpianitas - Typical lumpia shanghai accompanied by sweet chili sauce. I appreciated the meat to wrapper ratio. 

Tamarind honey baby back ribs - Damn Daniel! Fall off the bone tender pork ribs with sticky tangy tamarind sauce. It comes with a slaw and plantains. I really liked this dish!

Kare Kare - A pretty good version. It's a peanut stew with oxtail and various vegetables. Cutting Board's version has grilled veggies on the side like eggplant, zucchini, green beans, and asparagus. You must eat this dish with a little bit of bagoong, which is a necessary condiment! The asparagus was unnecessary and was over cooked and very hard to eat. 

Bibingka soufflé - I was most excited for this dish, but it was the biggest let down. I like the creativity behind this, but this dessert wasn't for me. It tasted like a big fluff of sweet egg white. The salty egg and cheese on the side did not agree with my taste buds. After we left, I just wanted something traditional. I ended up getting halo halo from another place. I will have to try Cutting Board's halo halo on a future visit though. 

What kind of Filipino place does not include white rice with their entrees? Seriously, I can't believe I had to order two sides of rice. 

They have a good selection of beers. The Sam Adams nitro white was excellent. They also carry my favorite brand of grapefruit beer. Great, casual atmosphere. I liked they there was no TFC on the TVs, but instead several sports stations were on. It was nice to see the basketball playoffs on a nice big screen.

""I want to try real Filipino food before deciding if I want to be a gastro-tourist in Metro Manila and Cebu""  I say to a car full of ""yeah right"" looks.

The food is very approachable.  A blend of Americanized Filipino street food and Spanish influenced dishes (from the Spanish colonization in the 16th century). 

Tip:  Use any fermented shrimp sauce if provided.  It might stink but it boost flavor to the next level.

Tip:  Dishes are meant to be shared family style.

Straight to the pig.  Best to worst.  The crispy pata (brined and roasted pork hock) excellent.  Fall off the bone tender with crispy skin.  Aggressively seasoned hinting of a juicy, fatty piece of ham.  Lechon Kawali (deep fried pork belly), while juicy with a nice crisp skin, the texture of the belly including the fat is rubbery and the flavor one dimensional.  I prefer the roasted lechon cooked over a fire seasoned with lemongrass, oregano and other herbs.  The crispy binagoongan (pork belly sautéed with eggplant in fermented shrimp paste topped with tomato and mango) boast a great sweet sour flavor.  Fermented notes help the sweetness of the pork.  Garnishes make the dish refreshing.  Finally the crispy pork sisig (pork belly sautéed with onions, peppers, topped with a fried egg), no.  Way too oily.  I should have listened to fellow yeeps.

The grilled bangus (milk fish), the highlight.  Well seasoned, charred bitterness, flaky and moist flesh topped with a refreshing, herbaceous mango slaw.  More slaw would have made it even better.

The kare kare (oxtail peanut stew), is very good.  Perfectly braised, suckably good oxtail, creamy peanut and beef sauce.  A side of grilled summer squash and eggplant, epically when dipped in fermented shrimp sauce, make the perfect foil.  

Finally the crispy tadyang (crispy beef short rib).   Simply braised beef short ribs deep fried to finish.  Very moist and pull apart tender, with a contrasting, chewy texture on the outside.  Comes with ""house gravy"" but adding anything to it is unnecessary.  This is good eats naked.

OK off Strip service.  A little haphazard (unless they expect you to eat with your hands) or only three in your party is thirsty.

We get it. 
But really. Is any Filipino's cooking the same as the next ones? No. 
My mom is Filipino. And guess what, her brother's cooking tastes nothing like hers. Neither does her mother's cooking. And so on...
Every Filipino has a different style of cooking. Some of them REALLY suck at it, and some of them are amazing. 
I'm lucky, because my mom's cooking happens to be amazing. 

Going foward: This place is a gastropub. They're looking for a different type of theme, and I totally dig it. Especially since they have good beer.
This place is super good, in my opinion. Especially the Pork Sisig. Some people said it was too greasy. Mine wasn't overly greasy--but again. For fucks sake, people. Do you know what pork sisig is? A shit ton of fat. That's what most of the pork is. And THAT's why it's so flavorful. 
Some days, I really hate Yelp. Other days, it's great because it helps me decide on what I want to stuff my face with. 
I also had the chicken adobo. I really like the dish. I wish it was a little less garlicy, but it was still super tasty. Just prepare yourself. 

The prices are super reasonable for the portions you recieve as well. 

I'll be back again soon, so I can keep trying an array of dishes. Because that's what I do. Eat my little black heart out.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,74,65,4,6lF08h8A_rfV8YymdanpHw

So he finally got the chance to stop by and have dinner here, and I was invited.

We were immediately sat and asked what we wanted to drink, by our server, Nadine. She offered some specials with what's at the bar & tap and certain street food specials. So we were tempted to order some shrimpballs & fishballs, along with our cocktails. Those Calamantinis were so refreshing & delicious! So we're those shrimpballs & fishballs, that totally reminded me of my childhood & the street foods in Manila. One thing I was so skeptic about were those pickled ampalaya, (bittermelon), that was served with the seafood balls. They were tossed with some onions, garlic & ginger. I tried it & I was highly impressed, in how it took the bitterness away, from how they prepared it! Little things like that alone makes such an impact to me. Clearly they know techniques in how to prepare certain foods, that has an acquired taste, and make it better. We also ordered the Tamarind Honey Babyback Ribs & the Pork Sisig, that were both phenomenal!!! There were very little leftover for me to take home. Even that was great the next day!!!

Born in the rural Midwest and spending the better part of thirty-two years there while in school, suffice it to say that it very well be that I'd never really engaged in conversation with a person from the Philippines until moving to Las Vegas just two-and-a-half years ago, the island's cuisine no less underrepresented in my dining history but also in the United States as a whole considering the number of their hard working people that make up the population in 2016 - the chance to dine with two local Chefs, one of them actually Filipino, plus a friend providing more than enough impetus to check out Cutting Board on Saturday afternoon.

Officially titled ""Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub,"" the extended descriptor part invitation to those unfamiliar and perhaps a bit cautionary to natives that the food is not exactly ""authentic"" to the style served back home, the restaurant took over an Asian buffet on Rock Springs Drive just off Lake Meade Boulevard near I-95 just a few months prior and having gained mixed reviews from trusted persons it was with a wide focus that a menu already undergoing several changes that an order was compiled, the dozen plates largely successful with portions that are not only generous, but often quite excessive.

Decorated in a manner not particularly ethnic, but more befitting a ""gastropub"" with limited décor aside from televisions showing sports, the layout of Cuttingboard features several hightops with backless industrial stools plus those uncomfortable steel shop-chairs at many standard four-tops, the better bet being to request one of the larger options suited for groups or communal dining that provide padded seats beneath the din of Pop-staples like ""No Scrubs"" from the 90's and early 2000's.

Listening to several specials while also seeing plates come out from the kitchen to others, the clientele largely Filipino families early before transitioning to a mix of Caucasians, African Americans and Latinos closer to two o'clock, it was merely minutes before the order started arriving, the $170 all-in cost without drinks quickly flooding the table with first bites of both the Silver fish and Escargot in Spicy Coconut proving to be robustly flavored even before being spread on slices of baguette liberally soaked in garlic.

Unable to resist fried plantains, the ripe fruit lent a gentle savory note here that was replaced by a crisp Shell plus sweet Chocolate Sauce in the Turon a la Mode served for dessert, attention was immediately diverted to a duo of plates that would prove amongst the best of the meal both in terms of size as well as portion, the sizzling Pork Belly Sisig served on cast iron quickly filling the air with a delectable aroma of Onions and Peppers while the Crispy Ham Hock was easily enough to be split by a family of four as the shattering skin gave way to the melted fat and collagen plus rich meat beneath it.

More than a little impressed by the complex Sauces native to the Philippines, everything from the Spicy Coconut to Lechon/Liver Sauce and Aged-Soy going well with both the items they arrived with as well as fluffy Garlic Rice, another surprise was found in the funky Fish Sauce that added another dimension of flavor to the rich Oxtail Kare Kare with tender bits of Tripe mixed in, the meaty Pacit Bami another intense dish chockablock full of Garlic while a daily special of thick-cut Beef Tongue was almost French in its inspiration, bathing with Peas and Olives in a Mushroom Cream Sauce.

Heavily pushed to by servers to taste the Bibingka Souffle, a dish that others have declared as everything from ""delicious"" to ""disappointing,"" opinions at the table tended to feel the latter more accurate as mild sweetness did little to mask the nearly raw, eggy center - a far better concept presented by a dish described as Suman with Mango Sauce and Toasted Coconut served over a roll of Sweetened Sticky Rice with mashed Ube at the center.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,10,4,LMM6PUFBLddFtvYVUgEDkQ

Service and foods are both perfect.Their Crispy Pata is perfectly cooked that is really soft inside and crispy outside...Just let the server know when they take your order that you'll be having a bibingka souffle if you have a plan to take it as a dessert cause it takes about 20 mins to make which is understandable. Chicken Inasal with Java Rice has perfect taste where the Java Rice has a kick of mango taste which give the food a good flavor on it... I also love the salads that comes with the food it make things perfect... The only thing that is kinda bad is the sisig tacos, it's just I am expecting for soft tacos but they serve it with hard tacos, well that is their concept that people has to respect lol but still good flavors on it...

5303884,2018-01-14,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"I've had this place bookmarked since I moved to Vegas 2.5 years ago, and today I got a chance to try it out!  If I was just rating the food I'd probably give this place 4 stars, but there were other factors that lead me to take away a star.

We ordered: 
- Pork sisig tacos - 3 come in an order and this was probably the highlight of the meal for us; both for value and taste 
- Filli classic omelette - contained sliced longanisa, spinach, and mushroom... good taste combo and actually comes with the option of rice as a side
- ube pancake - free with yelp check in, though our server forgot about it until we asked where it was once we had finished our meal; very tasty ube flavor, I wanted to lick the ube sauce off the plate
- chicken inasal and fried chicken - both well cooked and had good flavor but neither came with rice. Also portion side was rather small for the price 
- garlic rice - since dishes do not come with rice we order a side of garlic rice, which had good flavor; but once again portion size was small for the price

Our server today was very friendly but seemed rather distracted, unfamiliar with the menu, and failed to check in on us once our food was brought out - as mentioned earlier she forgot about one of our dishes until we questioned it.  I can understand some inattention when a restaurant is busy but this was not the case, aside from  my group there were only 3 other tables present. Drinks weren't refilled and had to track her down for the check despite already having the table cleared of dishes.",U-lHUPZbG8R7Bqxzq8X_lQ,3,1,3,BxMOK_OWHySvlzSpqrh4NQ
5319357,2016-06-03,13,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"I had a vision of a nice Filipino restaurant without the tacky décor such as a nipa hut, bamboo, abaniko, giant utentils on the wall, carabao or a jeepney. Where you can simply enjoy Filipino cuisine and know there is authenticity without it screaming at you. This is what Cutting Board is about.

Modern décor with lots of space without being stuffy or pretentious. The menu is simple enough with pretty much all the Filipino favorites such as fish balls, pancit, crispy pata. lechon kawali, garlic rice, lumpia, calamari, sinigang, sisig, paella, chicken inasal, kare kare, bangus, beef steak/ bistek, and tomato-based dishes. Filipino cuisine is a culmination of Malay, Chinese and Spanish (with Indian, Japanese, and American) foodgasm. So, to see paella or callos on the menu is not unusual. Choosing what I wanted to try was rather difficult because I wanted to EAT ALL THE FOOD!!! I figured, I'd start with my favorites first and then come back and try the others.

Lumpianitas:
Basically, lumpia Shanghai. Ground pork with veggies in rice paper then, deep-fried. The dipping sauce was good and does not resemble anything you buy in bottles from Asian stores. My mom and my sister would have lumpia in bags and freeze them so, all I had to do whenever I had a craving was to fry them. Cutting Board's version is just half a level below what I've had before. 4/5

Choriburger Mini Meatballs:
Choriburgers we've had in the past are spicier and I was not too fond of spicy food back when I first had these elsewhere. These are pork, beef, longganisa (Filipino sausage) meatballs with bourbon lime tomato sauce on a crostini. You can taste a bit of garlic. 5/5

Crispy Pork Sisig with Egg:
There are two versions of sisig: the Kapampangan version which has pork cheek and cartilage, and the Manileno version which is basically finely chopped pork belly. Cutting Board's version is similar to the in between version - but meatier and the pieces are chunkier than the Manileno version but the flavors of the Kapampangan version. The best of both worlds. 5/5

Garlic Rice:
I can't say enough how much I love garlic rice. I'm not a fan of boring plain ol' kanin. Flavors get elevated with this on the side of any ulam. 5/5

Chicken Inasal:
The last time I went to the Philippines, I remember seeing chicken inasal everywhere. It's Filipino BBQ chicken marinated in lemongrass, garlic and lime juice. This comes with Java rice which is the perfect combination with Filipino BBQ. The chicken strips were tender, juicy and flavorful. 5/5

Crispy Pata:
If your tito/tita, lolo/lola, dad/mom, kuya/ate ever had a heart disease, it's probably because of this. My dad would eat one crispy pata by himself - cardiac delight! Deep-fried brined pork hocks. What's interesting is that they give you two sauces. Normally, you get the soy sauce + vinegar dip. Some places use lechon sauce. Cutting Board gives you soy + vinegar dip, and GRAVY! At first dip, I was like ""this looks like lechon sauce but does not taste like lechon sauce at all! But it's surprisingly good"". It's a huge hock that can feed a family which is equivalent to 1 me. The skin is crunchy and the meat is juicy and flavorful. 5/5

Bibingka Souffle:
I like soufflés and bibingka is ok. Put them together and you get an airy, fluffy, egg white foamy baked treat. The salted egg that's normally on top of the bibingka is on the side and you get to drizzle your soufflé with yummy crème. Nicely done! 4/5

They have 4 Seasons (juice with pineapple, mango, guyabano, and dalandan/lime)They offer a nice selection of beers including Red Horse which many Pinoys would tell you that drinking it would feel like you really got kicked by a horse. And they also have this calamansi cocktail - it's the drink that got me so drunk while I was on vacation in the Philippines a few years ago that now, I can't remember the name of it. But yeah, just ask for the alcoholic calamansi drink and they'll know what you're talking about.

Service was great. They don't have dancing, loud music and karaoke - thank goodness!!! They have TV's so you can watch sports that Filipinos love such as basketball and boxing...and maybe, putbol. I'm just hoping they would open for lunch soon.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,26,17,5,9W1fEZPUlhaPLatppXuNtw

5355548,2016-06-13,12,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"You never really hear ""Filipino"" and ""gastropub"" in the same sentence, so you could imagine my curiosity when I saw that there was a gastropub that focuses on Filipino cuisine. I brought two of my friends with me to enjoy the modern twist to my culture's food. I honestly believe that this is a great concept, but they do have problems with execution & a lot of hiccups in their service.

Let's start with the drinks. I ordered the Calamansi Crush, which is made with: lemongrass vodka, elderflower liqueur, ginger, and calamansi  juice. I must admit, it was very refreshing. They did forget, however, to garnish the drink. It was missing the lime wedge element, which I usually like to squeeze the juice into my drink and muddle the wedge in a little. Their Monsoon Sweet Tea was nothing special. It tasted exactly like a Twisted Tea. Weak and not worth ordering. My friend ordered a Lychee Mojito, but our waitress failed to let her know that they were completely out of it until everyone else in my party received their drinks and the appetizer was dropped. Not good. 

Our waitress should've known ahead of time which items on the menu were 86'ed for that night's service, or notified us sooner before the appetizers and other drinks hit the table.

My appetizer was the bone marrow. This was two halves of a big bone (marrow exposed) roasted in compound butter & herbs. It's served with bite-sized slices of garlic bread on the side that had a balanced ratio of garlic and butter, only to be complemented by the perfect crunchy texture. You can put the savory marrow on these slices of bread or you could be like me, and enjoy it with a side of garlic rice. The marrow was basically rich like butter & will leave your tastebuds wanting for more. Probably my favorite out of everything I ordered.

For my entrée, I went with the seafood paella in squid ink. I've heard of squid ink pasta, but not squid ink paella so this was a very interesting choice for me. The squid ink added a slight saltiness to the dish. Its sea-like flavor definitely went well with the other seafood components, although it was pretty thick and soupy when I got to the bottom of the bowl. The garlic aioli and lemon wedges helped cut back on some of the saltiness. This dish was alright. Our waitress didn't bring this with everyone else's entrée, so I was basically sitting there with nothing while my friends were already halfway through their meals. So disappointing.

The grilled bangus (milkfish) was a great switch up from the traditional fried bangus. The slaw on top had a pungent vinegar taste (but not too strong) that traditionally goes well with Filipino fish dishes, especially fried ones. The fish itself was soft & cooked well, albeit a little flavorless.

Finally, for dessert, we ordered the bibingka soufflé. I thought I was going to be blown away by this through its presentation alone, but it fell short of my flavor expectations. It was very light & airy and garnished with powdered sugar on top. The bottom had a sweet sugar glaze, but I detected no taste of bibingka. It just tasted like whipped egg whites, not even a hint of coconut. Boo. Should've opted for a different dessert.

It's places like this that make me happy that Filipino food is slowly making its way into the mainstream. It's definitely not your Lola's home cooking, but the modern twist to traditional dishes is much appreciated.

Once they fix some service issues and improve what they have on the menu (flavor & portion sizes), I'm sure they'll be a force to be reckoned with in the culinary world. For now, they're just average.

They are still all over the place when it comes to service. Friday after Thanksgiving  and had a hankering for Filipino food.  All Filipino restaurants were closed in my vicinity except for this, let's give it another shot. It seems livelier with a DJ at the corner, supposedly spinning music. There was no person up front but 2 servers (?) were by the bar chatting. I could see someone at a corner, counting his tips (?). After about 5 minutes or so, someone comes up to the counter to greet me. He did say he would come back to get my order. Another guest comes in and I'm assuming the front person (as I have seen her before at the reception area) is handling her personal business ignores him for a good minute before she turns and asks him if he needs to be seated.  He says he's here to pick up an order. She says she'll find someone to help him and it takes about 5 - 10 before he finally gets to pick up his order. The server turns to me to get my order (while not done with the other guy). I order the bangus sisig, no tomatoes, side order of mango salsa (not on menu - totally willing to pay extra for this), and garlic fried rice. He indicated he would check if he can accommodate the mango salsa, confirmed my order. I asked how long and he said in 20 - 25 minutes. I sat down,  started my review.

We ordered 4 main dishes and 2 desserts for 4 people and I thought the total price was pretty decent at $60 for making us super full! 

- Crispy Lechon Kawali - Loved it (although my arteries probably didn't love all the oil)! The pork belly was cooked to a crispy yet tender perfection. I really liked the slaw that it came with and only wished there was more! Yes, the dish will be oily but that's the nature of it and why not treat yourself every once in a while? 

- Chicken Adobo - really flavorful and I loved the fried plantains that topped it off. 

- Crispy Pork Sisig - similar to Lechon Kawali but the pork is diced, grilled, and served with a fried egg! 

- Pancit - super delicious mix of different meats, veggies, and noodles! For what it's worth, my Filipino friend stated that this one of the best pancits he's had. 

- Coconut Halo Halo - Halo Halo with actual, real coconut and it was a fresh mix. This was my favorite of the desserts. 

- Bibingka Souffle - This pretty dish came with condensed milk for sweetness and a salted egg. The souffle itself has hints of coconut and a definite egg flavor! Very soft, warm and hearty. 

I was really happy with all these dishes and highly recommend trying this place out!

We had gone in the afternoon when it was pretty pavemen + egg type of heat. When we arrived we entered the restaurant, and found out that the restaurant had no A/C. The staff said it was getting worked on. We were given a lot of water during our meal.
My husband and I had the lumpianitas, tamarind honey baby back ribs, beef steak and the pork sinigang. All the items were so tasty, and changed my idea of flip food, into fancy cuisine. BUT, the beef steak was too different for me to really enjoy. It tasted like familiar beef steak, but super light on the flavor, and lacked juices.
The reason for the 3 stars- the food, service, and price did not match. The server was not welcoming, but that is contributed to a no A/C work environment which we were sympathetic to.

As if it had been sitting under the light because no one knew who it belonged to. I think there were just too many hands everywhere.

It is much nicer inside than a ""gastro pub."" The food was great. Very creative concept. The best dishes in my opinion were the Longanisa Skewer, the Crispy Lechon Kawali, and the Bangus Sisig which was my absolute FAVORITE! All of their bangus (milkfish) dishes are thankfully boneless!

Cons.. I ordered the kare kare.. 45 minutes later.. waitress comes back and says that they didn't have it anymore.. utensils were dirty.. parking (near the restaurant) was limited.. waitress didn't really know how to say the items on the menu, and didn't know some of the things on the menu (maybe new staff).. fish balls were really tiny... the fish sisig tasted raw.. chicken was burnt.. a little overpriced..

The kare kare was good the first time but then they started replacing the oxtails with other types of beef and the kare kare was not nearly as good.  Other times they simply ran out of the oxtails and didn't offer the kare kare.  The inconsistency results in my 3 star review.,I2uVrasAAc_cC439ONZ1mw,0,0,3,M-_oJIkUotXXCppYGvyNew

I don't blame the servers but i do blame the kitchen for being slow in cooking the food. This place already had a bad reputation, and they continued to not be consistent with their portions since the last time we came here.

5641375,2016-12-04,1,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"A few things to know about this filipino gastropub:

Service is friendly and attentive.
Rice dishes are much large than expected. Generous portions.
The baby back ribs are a hit. Can't miss with those. 
The special lechon is an interesting dish with crispy pork rind and fatty pork belly around paella style rice. Good but not a repeat dish for me.
Plantains, lumianitas eggrolls are tasty and popular with the kids.

Overall an enjoyable meal, as long as you know it's time to throw the diet out the window for the night, since filipino food is not the healthiest around.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,1,1,4,NM5Hr8YdjXPxZeuwcxzpHg

We ordered the crispy pork sisig, and lechon kawali. I've been to several filipino restaurants in Vegas, and this place has the best pork sisig! It beats the Cafe Moda ones which used to be our favorite sisig place. The lechon kawali is melt in your mouth goodness, the meat was soft and the skin was crispy. I didn't like the sauce or gravy that came with the lechon kawali though, I wish it was the traditional Mang Tomas sarsa. I ended up eating my lechon kawali with no sauce on it. The bibingka souffle is just so so, it's good but not great. Not something I'd be craving for, and I find it too expensive for $8. I'll be trying the coconut halo halo next time! The reason for the 4 stars is because of the size of the serving, the portion is on the smaller side. Because compared to other filipino restaurants I've been to, the serving was much more compared to this place and you pay the same price. Or if the serving cannot be much more, at least lower down the price. Nevertheless, I will still come back to this place!",RnEAAtZyEi_v0-VbNcetqA,0,0,4,EOe9RwzBKDA7kf8Zz7dcxQ

I tried the bibingka soufflé and that was interesting because soufflé aren't something you see in the PI all the time. But in Vegas you can see it all!  LOL. The soufflé was good. Not too over sweet and you could taste the bibingka in every bite but it wasn't the same consistency of traditional bibingka. It was crazy good. The cocktails are on point. I had a mango mojito that was sooooo good and the hubby had a calimansi cooler cocktail. It was sooo good. The service and ambiance was great. 

My only con is the restaurant was pretty warm inside. We were in there later in the evening but we ordered sinagang and it was great but we were both breaking a sweat while eating it. It's kinda unfortunate that everything else was great but we were both uncomfortable because it was just too warm in there. Even our server was glowing because she too was breaking a sweat and we were the only table she was waiting on.  We did ask if the AC wasn't working and we were told that the managers don't like to have the AC running too cold.

We made sure we have room to try their bibingka souffle, served with cheese, salted egg and syrup( looks like condense milk) . I ate it without any of the sides and like it that way.

5772286,2017-08-14,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"We seeked out this place because it was recommended by a friend.
Location/parking: off the Vegas beaten path. Parking were plentiful.
Atmosphere: not your typical Filipino restaurant in decor and setup. That's because this doubles a a bar/dance club. The DJ booth, widescreen TVs, and beer list proves that. Noise was good during lunch but during dinner the music was distracting. These guys need to decide if they're primarily a restaurant or a club. Their great food should give them their answer.
Food: we came in during lunch (and returned a day later for dinner). The menu is fusion Filipino and a variety of other cuisine. Those that were not fused, were prepared in some unique way. The presentation was great. This added another dimension because I always thought that Filipino food were meant to be smelled and tasted. Read the menu or ask the servers if you can't decide what to choose. We got the kare-kare and lechon. Both were served in generous portions. The photos and descriptions on the menu were very accurate.
Price: about $25 per person.
Service: needs improvement, slow, and our server was not too knowledgeable of their menu.
Overall I give this place a 5-star because the food were really great and serve with a fusion twist.",6fCCHJ67Y4408GXY9UyncQ,1,0,5,xGfMCNVz6ufX9I_WevGZKw
5786350,2017-08-14,0,QMKgn9p_hRUlumBDAAfWlA,"The cutting board is a great place to eat with a very cool interior. Kind of like chipotles. It's great for family, friends, and couples. The floor space is spacious so you're not table to table with your neighbors. While I was there music was playing in the back ground and it created a warm atmosphere. 

There were about three servers running tables for about 9 tables so we were always being help! A+ 

Now let's get into the food! The first thing that we ordered was the calamari I was hesitant so I had asked if the calamari was going to be heavily seasoned- our waitress told me they can adjust it if need be! I told them it's fine and trusted the cooks. When it came out- PERFECTION!!! Barley any oil, lightly coated, and balanced seasoning. You must try the calamari! 

As for entrees we ordered garlic fried rice, pork sisig, and pancit bami. Garlic fried rice wasn't too heavy on the garlic but just enough for flavor. I enjoyed the sisig as well, I can't give you a comparison to others because I haven't eaten sisig that much not know the difference. The pancit was good too- the noodles were thick and I liked that a lot!  Overall everything blended well together.

Drinks- we got a Thai tea and a calamansi mojito. That was something new that I've never seen before but wanted to try it so bad because I love calamansi juice! The mojito came out really well. A little bit light on the mint but it enhanced the calamansi taste! Thanks!!! They also had a lychee mojito which I will try next time.

The only thing I'm knocking a star off for is was the fact that it was really hot inside. I'm not sure if the ac was down what but it was kind of uncomfortable at the end of our meal after we ate really hot food. The servers were amazing and very prompt.

Knowing that it's Mother's Day, the restaurant should've been prepared with volumes of orders.

We were the first ones to arrive and yet, was served last....  it's interesting that any place can easily charge your group the gratuity, I understand that we were a big group and that's it's an automatic thing, but the word GRATUITY, means tip for service.... an exceptional service that is --- which we did not get... how dare you collect $32 gratuity for our group for food/dishes that came in one by one?

This is our go-to place for when we have Filipino relatives visiting us from out of town.

Binagoongan - My wife loves binagoongan and she said that it is one of the best she has tried. Honestly, I am not a fan of this this, but I like Cutting Board's version... it's not too salty! Maximum deliciousness!

Crispy Tadyang - My Favorite! It kinda tastes like the one from Gerry's Grill.

Bangus (milkfish) Sisig - for those who don't eat meat, you gotta try this! (see picture posted - it tastes as good as it looks).. this is a healthy alternative to pork sisig. It's so good you won't feel bad not getting pork sisig.

Fried Chicken - This is always a hit with the kids... and adults...we all liked it!!! 

Bone Marrow - because YOLO!
