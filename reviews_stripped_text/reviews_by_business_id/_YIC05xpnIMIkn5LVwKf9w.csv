854472,2015-10-22,0,_YIC05xpnIMIkn5LVwKf9w,Horrible place. Never went to popeys before so I hope the othera are better. staff was unfriendly but the quality of the food was worse. I had the popcorn shrimp. It was a lot shrimp but it tasted very old and overcooked. I dont know how long ago that stuff was fried. I was already afraid to be sick later when I ate it and I didnt have to wait for 20 minutes till my stomach was hurting. I had to chancel my trip at the strip way earlier than planned because I needed badly a toilet and went back to the hotel. was at the toilet for 20 minutes. didnt feel that bad for years. Never again,gA56qDiFgkvg_ts0DG1R5w,1,0,1,sHRlI4ZaS54VJoo1DHATNA
1189498,2017-02-07,0,_YIC05xpnIMIkn5LVwKf9w,The workers make this place real crappy. They made me wait for a 4 piece of chicken. Half and half. We waited for about 25-30 mins. A lot of people tried to blame the manager. But it's these ghetto unprofessional black girls that make this Popeyes terrible.,AYEY5HMZiG3VH9Me9o0kZg,1,0,1,eWcLy03QqcqzI-HVD8XNsA

In the past,  the night crew were young men who always had a smile & acted grateful for the business. The staff during my last few visits are older women ( younger than my 60 years,  but older than the young men of past  visits). The lady at the counter acts as if every order is a punishment to her . No smile, no thank you ....no customer service skills at all.  
Although the food is still good, this will be my last visit to this location.
I'm too old to pay for poor service when other choices are steps away.",Okyv6hApILYBI4oqpImBhQ,0,0,3,mc4mZK-AElM_hcWFHzG_MA

Not only would they not honor it at that location the manager couldn't even explain why they wouldn't accept it. The coupon is good through the 31st of August 2015, hope everyone asks them to honor it.",n_pKk2zOelBJTcikND-qLw,0,0,1,1omlqOHq3WUfTBf16-3YoQ
2544351,2016-08-19,0,_YIC05xpnIMIkn5LVwKf9w,"I was staying at the Monte Carlo and had a hankering for some spicy wings. After reading  a lot of BAD reviews of Popeyes in the Vegas area I was a bit hesitant to come to the food court where this Popeyes was located. 

This Popeyes is located on the Strip and you take an elevator to the second floor. Lots of other chain food places too. 

I ordered 3 spicy wings. I was told there were 2 spicy wings and 1 regular wing. I asked if I could wait for a new batch of spicy wings. The server, Lizette told me no problem and if I wouldn't mind waiting 12 minutes. I said sure.

This is where excellent customer service shows up. I was waiting....it had been about 5 minutes. Lizette hands me a cup for a free soda. I ask what is that for. She says its for having to wait for my order. I declined, but I sincerely appreciated her thoughtful gesture. Great job Lizette---you really know how to take care of customers!",OmRCx3406Jk_5969ONBdqA,0,1,5,DyJBYAcAny8QGnhY3ijl6g

All of the order was items that take a minimum time to scoop into a serving container, yet was made to wait behind people getting large chicken orders.  My party was done with their food from other vendors by the time I received mine.  Not cool. The ladies behind the counter were rude to others who were waiting on them and their incompetent method of order filling. By far the worst service I've gotten in any Popeyes restaurant.",GlQzLjWaicboHwuUd3MVUQ,0,0,1,qBRRmIVv1oAwLnFfjt2qfw

Since the other people with me went to other places in the food court, I was on my own to order whatever I wanted. oh yeah! So what did I get? The kids meal. For $3.99 it was a great choice. I got two chicken strips (buffalo sauce), a side of beans and rice, a biscuit, and a drink (that I refilled). Whoa, that was a nice snack for the price. 

The service was quick and friendly.
My meal was packaged well.
There was ice in the machine and lemonade was a choice.",PtLRuZrcS7qlIWP_ZXIREg,0,0,5,FjGN1bxpd1M_a4kloCjkJA
