The pasta we ordered  was quite good, however,  I am a little disappointed about the deep fried calamari which were covered with too much flour.    Pizza is not bad.",Wsk24j_qKWLOhhRLBoJl8Q,0,0,3,J0z_nPZ2L52gVsJUENM5hg

The place was empty, there wasn't a sole in the dinning room but the staff.  Our server was gracious and attentive, she kept a close eye on our drinks and brought plenty of bread. 

We ordered a clazone as an app, slipt it
Between the two of us and it was really good, the dough was slightly sweet, crispy, and the rolled edges were perfect! The mariana sauce was thick and rich.

For my entree I got the veal, stuffed with eggplant, spinach and smothered with cheese, my only complaint was the 'drizzal' of olive oil' was too much and put a bitter taste in my mouth, the veal was cooked perfectly!

My husband got the liguini and clams! Very generous portions!

Overall, good food and excellent serive, I would go back and try more, the pozza oven looks very tempting!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,DqZT73ZBlFwyV-PSc5v5Lw
