Their yelp and grub hub both say they're open until 10, but when I show up at 8:15 they are closed. It's the only yogurt shop close to my house and I've never been so frustrated by a local business in my life. Get your shit together.",RIYYTSjB7HxHVgKsKwBjVg,3,0,1,lNyOJm1TwPSMi3yfG_elbw

(I did like the former and miss My alot!) we dropped in to try out the new store and it is nice and clean freshly painted. I enjoyed the yogurt and they had lots of toppings to choose from.,UV-pwUM9wn57exkH5Ftihw,0,0,5,9vcRiCc6cJ4YHDHdwTlrzA

Then she welcomed the customers who came in after. We couldn't help but feel like we were the Wrong color (not white, but Pacific Islander) Yogurt wasn't that good either, we've tasted a lot better! No wonder the place was empty. Thank God we bought a Groupon!! My children do not want to go back...",Kh6AplQ7R8wDxn3W2uFZUQ,2,0,1,LmLLyplXCFz4WTyrQN7fOA

1050363,2014-09-28,0,aBLQxmSlqkahg0BEokTPKw,"This is the former home of Chill-N-Yogurt. Now it's Froyo Time and what a difference!

The place has been remodeled with bright new paint, new tables and chairs and a completely cleaned up counter section. All toppings are fully stocked and tidy. 

Most importantly, the service is excellent. Most of the frozen yogurt places I've visited are staffed by what seems to be extras from The Walking Dead - totally out of it and not at all happy to be working. This isn't the case here. Management is enthusiastic and definitely 100% customer centric.   

Looking forward to my next visit!",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,1,0,5,ialmungBxWcPiNuN7tEx_Q

I loved the Belgian waffle flavor but I had a hard time picking just one, so did my husband (he had five flavors). Definitely going back!",KXqZ4Kf7y0c1WQ76DsFqfA,0,0,5,4aPjk-r9fIv-7JGijXs2LA
1460067,2015-06-27,0,aBLQxmSlqkahg0BEokTPKw,"Let me first say that I live fro-yo time and it's frozen yogurt! What I didn't love this visit was the girl behind the counter! She was rude and not customer friendly! Never offered us any sample cups, asked if we had a stamp card or even bothered to offer us any other products-water, soda, the freezer cups that were 50% off. I watched as 2 first time customers came in and had no idea what to do and all she said was ""the cups are over there and serve yourself""...and again didn't offer them any samples or even come around from behind the counter to help! Now the couple who came in didn't speak English but she could have SHOWED them what to do! As a previous sales manager this is one of my pet peeves!! Your job is to help your customer if you work in any type of customer service! So let's hope this girl learns a little something before my next visit!",yImCXtWJRHVK2_TZoDZezw,3,0,1,BlYaidSsIhc_-6srEEy2Hw

1999512,2015-05-02,4,aBLQxmSlqkahg0BEokTPKw,"I swear, this spot has been two or three different froyo businesses over the past couple of years. This one doesn't really vary from the norm: about 10 flavors, a bar of toppings, a polite but bored teenager working.

The peanut butter and toasted marshmallow froyo flavors were decent. Nuts are in small open-air bowls with spoons by the register, possibly an allergy risk? Found it odd that whip cream was in a compartment in the condiment bar rather than in a can. Just not used to seeing that.

Cheap stop for a sweet treat. Customer service was pretty nonexistent. Second time I've been here and been the only customer for my entire visit. Decor is very child-friendly. I like the colorful spoon options at checkout, and they do have a loyalty card program.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,3,3,I3UPz1-9ZsFsthN-bZ2PLA
2385477,2015-01-27,0,aBLQxmSlqkahg0BEokTPKw,"I had the Turtle Caramel froyo. It hit the spot! My kids as well as myself loved the vast variety of self serve toppings. Popping pearls in various flavor from strawberry, cherry to lychee. Maraschino cherries, Nerds, crushed candy bars and syrups. The wall mounted television is a nice distraction. As far as ambience felt a little empty. The seating limited to 2 tables (4chairs each table) versus U-Swirl. U-Swirl has more of a social lounge style with grouped seating layouts, knee height coffee tables, Ottomans,etc. Froyotime had fun pastel colored chairs and all around neat and clean. Friendly service with a smile.",ie6bdQuBibWwnypu55kysw,1,0,4,7Mh-P181B_X20vIZrdpcYQ
