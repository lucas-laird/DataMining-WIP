19754,2009-10-21,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Took the wife there a couple of days ago for a nice quiet dinner.  The atmosphere was perfect - refined but not stuffy.  Our primary server was a touch distant at first but opened up nicely as the night went on.  The rest of the service was wonderful - attentive, efficient and yet never intrusive.  As for the most important part - the food - what can I say except that I will never go to Vegas again without stopping by Ogdens.  The Maytag blue cheese souffle is about as decadent an app as I've had.  For main courses I had the halibut (best fish I've ever had), while Robin had the bacon and scallops.  Her dish was wonderful as well.  Dessert was the cheese course and it was both pleasure and thought provoking.  At the end of the meal, the server took notice of our obvious satisfaction and gave us a copy of the menu - a real nice touch.  Most highly recommended.",u7uuoa6LUbQTsgZKb2a2ww,0,0,5,39BuVEJrrMMPFqZJ14CjBA

And certainly nothing worth the price we paid. We tried the fois gras, blue cheese souffle, ceasar salad, rib-eye, pork loin (you get 2 slices of pork, but 1 was undercooked, the other was over-cooked). I have a sweet tooth, so I was hoping maybe at least the dessert would be good, but no, it was the worst part of the meal. I got the smores, and there was way too much marshmallow cream before I could even get to the chocolate. And I don't know what they did to that chocolate, but it wasn't sweet enough. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. For the prices they charge, save your money & go eat somewhere else.",LlrbcY_fX3gA1BzsiqdgHg,1,0,1,axAqLsuV0vMLc3y27Zi57A
100867,2010-03-26,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"I probably would give it 4.5 out of 5. We split the burger and two entrees. The only negative was the burger was hyped as the best burger in Vegas and it was fine, but not memorable. At the end of the day a burger is just a burger. It was huge and the meat was prime, but the seasonings were subtle and the grill obviously had a few hot spots as parts were charred. But the Duroc Pork stole the show. It was perfectly cooked and had an amazing flavor. The Halibut also left a good impression. The French Fries were also quite good. 

Very good wine list with good value at both ends of the spectrum. Chef Ogden gave us a very informative kitchen tour and the service was outstanding.",-qp7B7BBxMeVXfp_2ThNCQ,0,0,4,E9lP_RcVLzVDmwpAib2k8Q
124321,2011-09-07,1,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"If someone told me I was going to try a $19 burger that Alan Richman of GQ Magazine said was the ""best burger I ate this year"", I would be pretty damn excited. And I was, until I ate it. How can a burger that costs $19 that is located in a multi-award winning restaurant suck? Bradley Ogden's restaurant showed me how.

Located in Caesar's Palace, Bradley Ogden's is positioned along a small row of restaurants within the casino. The exterior of the space is fairly unassuming and subdued, as is the décor within. I didn't get to venture too far into the actual restaurant, as our burger is only served in their lounge area. Apparently a $19 isn't good enough for the regular menu, although I'm sure for the price they would serve it to you if requested.

Being that this is a blend of 'house ground steak' according to the menu, it had to be ordered medium rare to sample what would hopefully be tremendous flavor. After what I think was far too long of a wait for a random week night when it wasn't that busy, our food arrived. The presentation was great as you can see in the picture, but the situation quickly deteriorated from there. Because the meat is supposedly so amazing according to the chef, the burger is served with absolutely no toppings, just a bun. You are offered ketchup, spicy mustard and a decent aioli, along with a 'salad' and fries, but that is all. Upon biting into my burger I came across the largest disappointment of the night though; an overcooked burger! You would think that at $19 they would get my medium rare order correct? No such luck. This really pissed me off, and Burger Boy wasn't that thrilled either. The meat had not as much flavor as expected for such a blend of meats, maybe because it was cooked too much, I don't know. The bun was ok, toasted pretty well, maybe a bit dry too. But together they just didn't hold up well without any other toppings and not being juicy and bloody as ordered. The lettuce 'salad' was ok, but kind of out of place here when yearning for some real toppings on my burger instead. There were also two different types of pickles that were tasty, but still not enough to redeem this.

The one saving grace of our whole meal was the fries; they were fantastic. Large, natural cut, with what seemed to be sea salt sprinkled on them, and they were delicious. If anyone remembers a place called Boardwalk Fries that was around in the late 80's, this rivaled them. But we're here to review a burger, and the burger wasn't right. Being able to properly deliver on an order is a huge part of my review, so if you fail to cook my burger properly when it costs as much as this one does is a total fail. I refuse to send a burger back during this review process, although sometimes I might be depriving myself of something better. Either way, for $19 this burger is not worth it.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,2,iZ-zgt48iAWNdZvnMyraNA

149860,2007-02-25,1,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Had a great experience at this Bay Area chef's recent (or pretty recent) foray into the world of the Las Vegas mega-casino restaurant. Can't recall specific prices too well for this meal, so I'll apologize for not being too helpful in that area. The service was spot-on, with me placing our order based on most of our server's suggestions. The four of us started with two appetizers: a bluefin tuna sashimi and the fried frog legs. The first was your standard sashimi appetizer at a high-end restaurant, but the second course was amazing. Perhaps one of the best single dishes I've ever tasted. The meat itself was incredibly light and moist, and it was perfectly fried and seasoned. It was accompanied by some sauce I've since forgotten about, but that was good also :) And since some at the table were wary, the remaining two of us got the whole dish to ourselves. Our entrees were light: scallops, sturgeon, chicken, and hake (a light fish). All were excellent- my hake was perfectly flaky. All of this was accompanied by a great riesling suggested by the waitress as well. (To echo another reviewer, the wine list is very expansive and features lots of CA, OR, and WA selection- priced from $50 to $9000)

We again had our server suggest desserts and we ordered their four best, including a lemon tart, an apple crisp, and two chocolate desserts. I'm not a one for lemon, but the other three were pretty fantastic (especially because they all came with an ice cream). And at the end of the meal, we were presented with their butterscotch pudding as a very nice finishing touch. You will be absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal, so leave plenty of time to enjoy to tea or coffee before you have to rush off to a show.

Other reviewers are right- the restaurant is located in one of the busiest parts of Cesars, but none of the outside noise traveled into the restaurant at all. In fact, it had a very soothing art-deco meets zen type decor about it. How very California.",Qc-WE8i3Ahczno58OKw-Nw,0,1,5,6LWeBcT1v4RLhsiQkhdsbA

The only thing I ate that my husband did not was their ""signature"" Maytag blue cheese souffle.  I woke up the morning after regretting ever having stepped into the restaurant.  It was violent.  I guess it can happen anywhere.  To tell you the truth, the most shocking part of the experience was the total apathy of the restaurant management.  I called to inquire & let them know.  They promptly referred me to ""security"", who referred me to ""risk management"", who blew me off.  I guess they won't respond unless my lawyer calls.

The waiter did an excellent job at making the food sound delicious but, out of a party of 5, none of us enjoyed our meal. Below average food with prices that are way to high. I would be more than happy to pay a good amount for a good meal, but bad meal + high prices = disappointing experience. 
(I got the scallops other got both steaks, chestnut soup, caesar salad)

The cocktail menu was unimpressive as well. I had to resort back to a basic vodka soda water which was disappointing because I can get that for free in the casino.

461045,2010-11-23,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"The best burger in Las Vegas! Every few months when I visit, I eat here at least once. It's so good, I have never ordered anything else.

$29 prix fixe (in the lounge or bar only)- a choice of salad, house-ground rib eye burger or fish and chips, fries and dessert. We sit at the bar, enjoy a bottle of champagne (or 2) and Carl takes excellent care of us.

This time, my more adventurous friend did try the fish and chips (I had a couple bites) and they were good. Not as good as that heavenly burger though:) We started with one Caesar salad and one mixed heirloom tomatoes, both perfect and finished with the butterscotch pudding and snickerdoodle cookies.

We had dinner there on July 31st.  Unbeknownst to us they were closing for a month two days later.  

Normally that shouldn't matter, but they basically were running out of things on the menu.  It just seems odd to me that a place with a Michelin star wouldn't always want to put their best foot forward--maybe customize the menu each day based on what ingredients were left.  It was also a little unsettling thinking ""we're having what they haven't run out of yet""...the freshness of everything comes into question.

And it wasn't so much that some things were unavailable, but rather WHICH things were unavailable.  First thing gone was a roast corn soup.  Fair enough.  

Then they were out of the Foie Gras....a real favorite of my wife and I.  Bummer.

Finally...no Filet Mignon?  I mean come on.  I can *sort of* understand about something that is relatively exotic like Foie Gras.  But no filet? 

I can't even imagine what the NEXT night was going to be like.  Peanut butter sandwiches all around, perhaps?

528349,2012-01-29,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Yesterday morning I went to the quickest timeshare pitch ever at my resort and they gave me $125 in dining vouchers. A three-course burger meal at Bradley Ogden's in Caesar's Palace is $30, a price I would never pay for a burger, but since there are tons of raves for the burgers and I like the fancy restaurant aesthetic and service I decided that it would be a great place to use a voucher.

I sat at the bar and had a great Bourbon Sour. I order this drink virtually everywhere and the sour mix is the only thing that makes the difference from restaurant to restaurant. I'm guessing they make their own here as the drink was excellent.

I ordered the Burger Prix Fixe with the caesar salad. The caesar was excellent. I really like how they do the whole romaine heart and I need to figure out how to get it adequately coated with caeser dressing at home without ripping it to shreds. Also, the sheets of parmesan were awesome.

Now, the caesar salad came out very quickly, so I was a bit concerned that my burger would be following shortly. But no, things worked just how I liked it. I didn't get the burger until  a few minutes after the salad plate had been cleared. I really, really hate restaurants that bring your courses out practically on top of each other so I really appreciated the perfect time gap here.

The fries were awesome, with big pieces of salt crystal on them (sea salt or kosher, I guess). I LOVE the taste of salt hitting my tongue and the slightly garlicly mayonnaise was nice and creamy with the fries. Could have had a little more garlic in it though.

Onto the burger -- initially, I thought it just tasted like a normal tasty burger, good but nothing that special, nothing to get worked up about. But somehow the taste improved as it cooled down and I guess maybe because the burger bun was marinating in the burger juices or something because by the time I got to the last bite I was going MMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm. So yes, it was a very good burger. Was it the best burger I ever had? I don't think so, but it was damn good and the surroundings and the service and the presentation were all awesome so that all adds up to a pretty great experience. 

Now dessert - The butterscotch pudding was literally a tablespoon or so of pudding. WTF? It was delicious, but thank God I was already fully.",SX7Di7rGSHXRvKVl07qk5Q,1,0,4,mlf_ZyGPz291yT9zKuQfqg

It was my first taste of foie gras and well, to my untrained palate it tasted like a runny cheese, heh.  I got the halibut which was nicely done with some marble potatoes.

It was a teeny bit salty (I'm a little sensitive to salt though) but it was absolutely delicious.  Tender and great to chew on.

About a half dozen full leaves from a heart of romaine perfectly dressed (It appeared that each leaf was dipped in the dressing) sprinkled with croutons and large shavings of fresh Parmesan cheese.

I think it was one of the managers that finally stopped by our table.  Apparently our waiter was busy serving a large party.  However, when she did show up, she made up for it the rest of the evening.  Friendly, attentive service.  None of the stuffiness that some expensive restaurants have.

I had the oysters and lamb entree, my wife had the caesar salad (we were at Caesar's!!) and grilled chicken.  Everything was fantastically delicious!  The lamb came with two nice sized chops perfectly cooked on top of two lamb canelloni.  One of the best meals I have ever had.  The wife liked hers also--the caesar salad is amazing.

Our waiter suggested we try the lounge menu prior to seeing Celine perform the following night.  We took her up on her suggestion and split the three course hamburger selection.  Caesar salad, terrific hamburger and the butterscotch cup for desert.  Service in the lounge was terrific even though it was quite busy.

As we're all piling out of the Cher concert at the Colosseum, the immediate thought of FOOD comes to mind

After perusing the many menus of different Hotel restaurants, throughout the day, to plan our evening nosh, we quickly came to discover that most do not cater to the veggie...........WTF?!?!

Even the ""famous"" Michael Mina restaurants (like Nob Hill) didn't even offer ONE veggie meal.....I mean, come on - if you're supposed to be the ""SF Experience"" in restaurants & don't offer 1 measly veggie dish than you are NOT representing, my friend

Anyway, walked over to Bradley & see a few veggie appies & an entree that sounded yummilicious so enter we do to happily discover we can be seated in 10 minutes....YAY

Waitress was super nice, jovial, & made fab-o dessert recommendations

To start us off, the Bar made me an interpretative Bellini & it was deeeelish

Homemade WARM breads circulate around to appease us while we're eagerly awaiting our delicacies

Sis had the Blue Cheese Souffle & Eggplant w/ Crispy Tofu & it was heavenly.  The tofu was just spicy enough & super crispy - which is just the way we like it!

I opted for the Heirloom Tomato & Beet Salad & the Blue Cheese Souffle & both were *extremely* tasty

Dessert consisted of the Banana-Claffouti for Sis w/ its caramelized naners & PB ice-cream

I had the Almond Butter-Cake w/ the Almond Toffee & Caramel ice-cream & it was outstanding

After all is said & done & the bill arrives, you're treated to a homemade Butterscotch Pudding that is absolutely 2-die-4.  Rich & creamy w/ tons of vanilla seeds all over the place!

We sat in the bar/lounge area since the main dining room was closed. I have to say, the food was excellent (had the hummus, a yummy cheeseburger and the fish and chips to share among the group) but the service was TERRIBLE. Our server neglected us most of the night, everything took FOREVER to get to our table (and they weren't busy), and to top it all off, the to-go order we placed for a friend too ill to come to dinner was obviously never put through to the kitchen. Instead of owning up to that mistake, the server let us sit there for 45 minutes, coming by only occasionally to say they were ""working on it."" Hmph.

This experience is the reason for the four star rating, because my SECOND experience - on New Year's Eve - was truly a five star experience. We arrived early for our reservation and, sadly, got stuck with the same cocktail server as we waited for our table in the bar area. She was still incompetent and it took forever to get our drinks, but once we moved to our table in the restaurant that entire experience was forgotten. Our dinner service was impeccable, as was the multi-course prix fixe NYE menu. Among the items I sampled: roasted garlic soup with a garnish of fried frog legs (amazing!!); mini blue cheese souffles; Alaskan crab poached in butter with shaved black truffles; grilled sturgeon with a manilla clam chowder broth; grilled pork tenderloin with a honeycrisp apple chutney; and - the BEST of the BEST - grilled bison tenderloin. Heaven on a plate. The bison was so lean, and so perfectly cooked, you barely needed a knife to cut it. Desserts were a sticky pudding and individual chocolate fondue, complete with our own ramekins of melted chocolate and assorted mini cookies, cake bites and fruits for dipping.

Our server was kind enough to create a wine flight to pair with each course. It was the perfect accompaniment to our meal, as was his attention to detail and the overall classy atmosphere. I've eaten in many casinos, but this was the first time I actually felt like I wasn't in one!

lila h. and i were in vegas for a fun girls' weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner...we chose bradley ogden after hearing about their famous dessert on food network's ""best thing i ever ate"" and the many great reviews on yelp...to my (and her) disappointment, our dinner was so so

first of all, i have to comment on how the meals were plated. everything that lila h. ordered came out with what looked like poo smears on the plate. i really wish i had taken pictures, bc it would really help illustrate what i'm trying to describe here. i know the kitchen was going for some artsy fartsy modern plating with sauces smeared here and there, but seriously, her pork chops came out on a plate that must've been substituted as toilet paper...i'm a very visual person and if it looks like there's poo smears on my plate, i'm going to probably lose my appetite just a bit

overall, the food was just average, nothing special at all. as an appetizer, i ordered the caesar salad which was definitely tossed with bottled dressing you can get from the grocery aisle (prob the generic brand) and lila h's cheese souffle were just meh, a little too salty for my liking. for my entree, i had scallops that were, texture-wise, cooked well, but flavor-wise were extremely bland. lila h's pork chops weren't badly seasoned, a little dry, but like i said, the plating really interfered with my enjoyment of the flavors

as for dessert...whoever the chef was that said that the banana's foster dessert-a-ma-bob was the best thing he ever ate, um, i will not be going to his restaurant EVER. what uncultured tastebuds! if that was the best thing he's ever ate, he certainly hasn't been around the block enough. if someone is going to vouch for a dessert on cable television, then i want ever single bite to be an orgasmic experience. my first bite was like the same disappointment a woman encounters when they meet an extremely gorgeous, charming man who ends up being a horrible lover in bed.

maybe i was expecting too much, because the whole dinner was anticlimactic. the only thing i enjoyed was the teeny tiny complimentary cup of butterscotch pudding that comes out at the end...i guess sometimes big surprises CAN come in small packages.",qYj2HQTun4E-PNZfT1EsCA,1,1,2,iS5ZV1kLJm-HGWy2ktwpEw

I had goat cheese and beets with cashews, which were an unexpected but welcomed touch.  The salads were plentiful and delicious.  Burgers were cooked to order.  Buns were a bit large but really good.  Fries were excellent also. House made pickles made the burger!  The pickles were excellent.

Service is always great (it helps that I'm always here with my father, whom most of the staff know). Everyone is wonderful and friendly. They start you off with an offering of three different breads: dinner roll, sourdough, and a blue corn muffin, I think. Yummm I could make a meal just out of the bread. For the appetizers, I highly recommend the blue cheese souffle, the squash soup, and the farmer's market green salad, which had an amazing pecan goat cheese that tasted wonderful with the pomegranates. 

The first time I was here, they didn't have any vegetarian options on the menu, so we had the chef prepare something for me, which was good, but nothing spectacular. The next time, they finally added a meatless dish! The mushroom risotto which is fantastic. Normally, I don't even like mushrooms, but this dish was creamy and earthy and yummy. The rest of my family swears by the bison. Can't say anything about that, but there you go. 

The ice cream trio is always a good choice for dessert, and the flavors seem to change almost monthly. I had the pumpkin flan during the autumn season, which was easily the best dessert I've ever had in Vegas. Oh, and I love the delicious little butterscotch pudding cups.

The last time I was there, they had an enormous party that was holding up the kitchen or something, because we ended up waiting in between courses about 30 minutes. And when they finally brought out the entree's, one of the bison dishes was completely overcooked. They comped us most of the meal because of that, and the waitress (she must have been new) was so nervous and nothing but apologetic.

We had reservations on a Friday night, table of 6.  
Most of our table did the Summer Prix Fixe menu.  
I selected the Tomato Soup, Halibut, and Banana Fosters cake.  
Tomato Soup is served with the small grilled cheese in the bowl first, then at the table the soup is delicately served in the bowl.  If you don't eat the grilled cheese first, it will get soggy.  This soup tasted and smelled delicious!
The Halibut was perfectly cooked and had ""cucumber noodles"".  The ""noodles"" were long strands of cucumber.  This went nicely with the watermelon soup?  Such a nice summer entree - very refreshing!
The banana fosters cake was more like a muffin/cupcake and was served with a creamy cream cheese ice cream.

At our table we also had a pork loin - YUM! and Maytag blue cheese souffle.  I was really surprised to how much I liked the blue cheese souffle! Make sure you eat it with the other items because all the flavors complement each other really well (it is really rich though - should go nice with a wine).

Read about their Pre-Fixe Menu on Yelp and it looked promising. We found they don't offer it unless you ask for it, which was rather tacky. Service was spotty and unattentive. Ambiance was not conducive to fine dining, between the TV at the bar, the loud music, and the tables practically next to the casino floor.

Between my husband and I, we tried 6 different dishes plus the seared Foie Gras.  The best dish besides the Foie Gras was their Caesar Salad, which was very authentic and made from scratch.

The Blue Cheese Souffle was pleasant but nothing to write home about. It needed some honeycomb to counter the saltiness of the cheese. The Seared Foie Gras also needed a sweet sauce in addition to the sourish berry sauce. The Roasted Petaluma Chicken badly needed a sauce. It was served next to some mushy pasta (I think that was what it was.)

1497650,2007-07-23,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"I have to preface this review by saying that I only went to the bar for a pre-show cocktail and appetizer.  My friend and I were staying at Caesar's and had heard great things about this restaurant.  Since we didn't have time to actually eat dinner there that night, we wanted to at least stop in for a drink and to taste something from the menu.  The first thing that caught my eye on the drink menu was a Strawberry Basil Mojito.  Being a big fan of basil, I knew I had to try the drink.  So I ordered it and the bartender started making the drink in front of me.  I tell my friend that I'm so excited to have a drink with basil in it (and the bartender must have heard me because she was looking right at me when I said it).  A minute later she hands me my drink and says ""sorry, we don't have any basil so I just made it without it.""  Wait a minute!!!!  Isn't this something you should tell the customer (especially a customer who wouldn't shut up about basil) BEFORE you make the drink so that the customer can decide if she really still wants that drink?  I would think so.  Anyways, I tried the drink and it was definitely missing something.  It just tasted like some mushed up strawberries and sweet and sour mix.  So, I then asked her if she had some mint I could put into it because it definitely needed something.  She found some mint and took my drink, poured it back into the shaker, added the mint and TONS of soda.  She shook it up and strained it into the glass and then added more soda on top.  So, basically there was really no alcohol left in this $16 drink and it was extremely watered down.  To be fair though, once I tasted the rock shrimp appetizer from the bar menu, all negative thoughts about my cocktail experience flew out the door - the shrimp was amazing.  All in all, I would love to try this restaurant for dinner next time I'm in Vegas.  I'll definitely stick with just ordering a glass of wine with dinner - hopefully the bartender won't be able to mess that up!",ORiNSdYMqWgTsUeEVh80Mg,0,0,3,-215Sr7kzi9AR-1xG9-pMA

My boyfriend doesn't like beets and he was even raving about the dish. We also started with foie gras served over a Belgium waffle and huckleberry sauce. I LOVE foie and have had it had many restaurants now, but nothing was like this one. The dish was perfectly crafted and well balanced with the sweetness of the berries. The dish was $26 and worth every penny. For the entree, I had a prime rib eye steak that was served with a potato puree and braised greens.

She blew it with my mom's food by not bringing both items out at the same time as requested. And when my wife's burger was grossly undercooked it took us a while to flag our waitress down to get it fixed properly.

The food wasn't too bad - a couple of us ordered from the fixed price menu and had the burgers, Caesar salad, fries, and cookies/pudding. The salad was OK (not even remotely close the great one I had the following evening at Delmonico), the burger was very good (but they need a better selection of cheese), and the cookies were very ordinary (disclosure - I find Snickerdoodles to be very boring and the ""Snicker"" part of the word is very deceiving as it has nothing to do with a Snickers bar).

Otherwise, it was my destination because the stars were perfectly aligned for me and their famous burger. I came in at about 6:30 and sat at the bar. I was pondering a bevvie but something about the bartender discouraged me from really digging in and experiencing the place. I absolutely loved the burger - no gristle, just the right size and it went down easy. You could taste the faint woody essence from the kitchen grill and the greens on the side were super good. I had already had fries that day so I was happy.

Dining at the bar, I'm not sure if it was just my luck but while the service was efficient enough, I found it to be somewhere in the realm of cold fish. I thought about having a peanut butter cup martini for dessert but the prospect actually seemed a little depressing. This wasn't my experience dining solo in about six other places in Vegas over the past week, so I'd say some work needs to be done in that area, if they care.",7Ek4da_Btvznc4Q4S0_Bag,3,1,3,Z8TmSLHvYo8leN7Tb2qLxQ

My husband and I go to Vegas once a year, and we make certain there is a night dedicated to Bradley Ogden.

The restaurant focuses on farm-fresh produce and excellent meats.  Although the menu can seem a bit simplistic, it is always thoroughly enjoyable and on the whimsical side.  This trip, we enjoyed a lovely prix fixe for a very affordable $60 per person.  The twice backed Maytag blue cheese souffle was perfect, as was the pork and halibut.  For dessert was a delightful white chocolate panna cotta and pb&j bread pudding.  

I tend to be sensitive to sodium, and I found for the first time, that my main course was a bit heavy handed on the salt, but given the excellent track record I'm definitely making reservations next year.

The staff is extremely accommodating for events such as birthdays and anniversaries.  I really can't recommend Bradley Ogden enough.  Enjoy!",MeIb-tKpULX-I3GC18g26w,0,0,4,UqW7-ei30k6Sk2EHNxweSw
1970680,2011-05-09,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Found this on a previous ""Las Vegas Seven"" magazine, featured with a few other mentioned burgers but this seemed like a Must Have Now!! 

I was on a mission and all I wanted was the burger. They only offer one burger but they also had a pre-fix meal that included the burger, salad and their dessert for like 10 bucks more.. Might as well.

Outcome of fixed meal:

The Farmers Market Salad: Fresh, Fresh Greens, light dressing.. Very Nice!

The Burger: Easily One of the Best Burgers I've had.  Eating this Burger should of been a Crime! Compared to other burgers, (gourmet, diner, fast food..) this just had a Very Obvious Quality, Balance and was Cooked right on point (I asked for medium well, came out more medium but no complaints)................ It was worth a Standing Ovation! It came with 3 dips/sauces:
Pepper Mayo = I like mayo, a touch of pepperness.. can't go wrong  
Dijon Mustard = strong horseradishy bite, add a little and it goes a looonngg way
Ketchup =  typical, I just used this as dip for me fries
 
Hand Cut Fries: comes on the burger plate: Fries were also awesome, genuine potato flavor..

Butterscotch pudding and Snickedoodle cookies: I could of had a gallon of that pudding! Cookies were equally delicious!

* Before the meal started, we were given an amuse - spoonful of some real crab creation. What a tease! Just melted off the spoon..

* Bread basket: ..The brownie, What a Treat!

* This meal was split between my girl and I, I mentioned to the server/bartender that we were going to share, nothing else. We received our burger plate already split in half on 2 separate plates along with 2 of everything else and looked like equal full portions (dipping sauces, veggies, fries..) + XX Stars!!

* Shout out: We met a really friendly lady at the bar that made our experience even better! I would consider her a foodie and so it was easy conversation. We did talk about ""Yelp"", I tried convincing her to join as she had the evident whim and attitude that would certainly benefit the community! We even exchanged/traded a piece of my burger with a piece of her wagyu.. By the way that wagyu was ridiculously Amazing! Thanks Elena, come aboard!

Service was 11/10, Ambiance was elegant and comfortable, All the food, especially the burger was a 10/10, Worth every penny, more than I expected!....",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,5,3,5,CLSQy4i3Vshmo6iaLS-Bqg

Anyways, I loved this place.  Although I've eaten at a lot of fine dining restaurants, I felt like I was a bit intimidated at Le Cirque by all its glory (yes, I gave it a 5), but I felt relaxed when I was at Ogden.  EVERYTHING about it was just.. perfect!  I sound like some blond cheerleader..

Naturally, the decor in fine dining places at the Vegas strip is beautiful- pretty modern and never outdated.  Ogden's is no exception.  Surrounded by warm woods and soft lighting, it is a stark contrast from restaurants like the metal jungle Shibuya at MGM Grand and Barmasa at the Aria.

My family and close friends (party of 7), went there one night with reservations, and it was amazing.  The service was indefatigable, being able to put up with the demands of my mother, and even I could tell that she was a bit intimidated by the ambiance of the whole place.  The front of house serves traditionally- starting with the ladies going clockwise and then the men.  Serving dishes from the left, taking them from the right, everything was like clockwork.  Fancy, fancy...

The manager greeted us after the server took our drink order, which is always a warm touch to any dining experience.  The drink I got was recommended by the server- a sparkling chardonnay.  NO IT WAS NOT CHAMPAGNE, people keep telling me that, holy crap.. it's not.  It was amazing and totally out of this world.

Aside from the 5 choices of bread that kept me full, I got a caesar salad which was good- it didn't taste like Walmart salad, but it didn't dance in my mouth- I mean, what do you expect from a salad?

The main course I got was Alaskan halibut (Alaskan halibut, an endangered species at a restaurant whose chef seems like one of those green peace dudes?  yeah, shut up).

I expected it to be bland because that's how halibut is naturally, but I was very surprised.  Slightly tangy, it was accompanied by some greens.  It wasn't filling, but are main courses in fine dining restaurants supposed to make you feel bloated?  Anyways, you can tell from the flavor and the pairings of the ingredients in the halibut that this came from a chef who was still a true gourmand chef at heart.. unlike some (ahem, Mr. Puck).

The menu is purely organic and constantly changes with each season.  When you eat in the summer, you won't see the same dish in the winter, nor will you see it in the summer the year after.  The diversity and evolving nature of this restaurant is the reason I gave it a 5-star.

The website tells you that it is traditional American, but I call it contemporary.  I don't see anything traditionally American in Atlantic diver scallops in .. coconut curry.

A dinner for two there is very appropriate- they even have a bar nearby to bring your buddies to.  Don't bring your children or toddlers- you don't want to make the angelic waitstaff turn bitter on you, if it's possible.  Otherwise, it's amazing.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,1,1,5,IRIu7NGYr7zkuk_6E1_8UA
2178517,2010-09-02,4,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"This review pertains to the restaurant week dinner menu (2010 - which is very similar to their summer tasting menu) 

The Skinny: well executed dishes with some missteps and odd flavour profiles for their chicken dish, dessert was rather poor for a restaurant of this quality (3.5) service: so-so, not great for a fine dining establishment (3), value: though the serving sizes are large for a tasting menu, you can't overlook the not-so great desserts (3). 

I would say there is a large contrast between the attitude of this restaurant for Restaurant week than the others. First of all, no signage signifying that it is participating in this event. Plus, the server required us to ask about the Restaurant week menu before we were able to see it. He seemed rather gloomy about providing this for us. 

Our waiter didn't really interact with us at all - he didn't offer any specials or any details about the menu. Did I mention it took a while for him to even show up at our table? At this point, the restaurant was pretty empty too. This is a huge contrast to the service we received last night at Sage (which was excellent, for your information). 

Alright, enough griping. On to the food. 

We started with a refreshing amuse of israeli couscous. The bread course was interesting with the rather tasty blue corn muffin (would have like a little more crisp on top but overall, really good) with a rather bleh dinner roll. 

We ordered the Caesar salad, the Blue Cheese souffle, the Duroc pork loin and the roasted chicken dish. Of note, with the exception of the souffle, the serving sizes here are enormous for a fine dining restaurant. 

This is a classic Caesar done well although I would have like a little more lemon in the dressing. The flavour of house made dressing was nice and I loved the presentation. Only gripe was the crouton was toothcrackingly hard even when mixed in with the other components. 

Blue cheese souffle with the plum and watercress was quite blue cheesy. Texturally, light with a crisp top, it matched well with the mild bitterness of the watercress and the sweetness of the plum. I would mention, if you're not a fan of strong blue cheese, you may not like this menu item (it kind of hits you like a truck at the end when you taste it). 

The Duroc pork loin with corn succotash was pretty good. The smokiness of the pork came through in this presentation and was well-seasoned. Wax beans gave it a more interesting texture to the succotash underneath. 

The roasted Petaluma Chicken with goat cheese gnocchi, ratatouille and roasted tomato salad had some major issues. Although the chicken itself was cooked perfectly - nice crispy skin, juicy chicken breast - the skin was very over salted. The goat cheese gnocchi had too much ?lemon flavouring in it, covering up the goat cheese flavour. Texturally, the gnocchi was rather gummy and not fluffy at all. The vegetables were rather bland. Not a successful dish. 

In both entrees, we were rather surprised at the lack of balance between the starches and protein. We would have preferred more than 3 pieces of gnocchi on the plate and a little more corn succotash. 

At this point, we would have considered giving this place a 3.5 to a 4 despite the rather lackluster service. But then the dessert arrived and it just killed us. 

We ordered the bananas foster and the peanut butter/chocolate dessert. 

I love bananas foster - all that rum-buttery goodness served warm with vanilla ice cream... what isn't there to like? 

It's an insult to call this dessert a bananas foster. Everything on this plate is cold, cold, cold. It's cold bananas mixed in with some sort of cold syrup (not much rum/butter to speak of) overtop of some cold banana bread with some oddly floral-sour tasting ice cream. I have one word for this - bad. 

The peanut butter/chocolate dessert consisted several components. A overly dry dense peanut butter brownie which was more the consistency of a cheap over sized cookie/cake than a brownie. The peanut butter cookie was okay, not great. The vanilla bean ice cream lack vanilla flavouring. The peanut butter milkshake was delicious however there was too much whipping cream on top to truly enjoy it fully. 

Overall, given the service and food quality - this place deserves a 3.5 star review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,3,3,DszRdMoKJIsaWjCRKE6EUg
2220545,2007-11-01,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"OK. Hands down.  One of the best place I've ever dined.

My friend E. and I walked by here last weekend and thought it would be nice to have dinner here.  We had no problem making a reservation for Sunday at 7pm.

When we got here, we were offered immediate seating but chose to spend some time in the bar.  While there, I checked out the decor which consisted of wood paneling and ocean scenes lit by back lighting.  The effect was clean and modern.

After a few minutes, we decided to start the dinner and were seated within a booth.  We were greeted by the awesome Rebecca who was friendly but not overly nosy (trust me, this is a fine line).

We started with a couple of appetizers and used the time to decide on our entrees.  For the appetizers, we had the crab cakes as well lobster with coconut cream.  The plates had nice presentations and the pairings, both color and taste, were totally out of this world.

We then decided to share the butternut squash soup, and the server was nice enough to pour it into two bowls.  And that was yummy too.

Oh, almost forgot to mention the bread.  There are three choices of bread: dinner roll, blue corn muffin, sourdough.  Always served warm.  OMG.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Soooo good....

For dinner, E had the Alaskan black cod which was cooked in such a way that it had a caramelized crispy outer 'shell'.  Absolutely heavenly.  I had the sea scallops which were seared just right.

For dessert, we had the chocolate mint brownie mousse three layer cake (forgot the name) which was very good.

We ended up spending three hours in there and got to meet the chef and the GM, both of whom were super friendly.  Everything was fantastic - the food, the service and the ambiance.  A word of warning though, make sure you save up for this place. It's quite expensive.  Fortunately for me, E paid for it.  Lucky me.  :-)",VkSUizrGQKl5IIBIIXCFIQ,1,2,5,aBtX7YoVnIp6mUyI_jQoaA

2238826,2007-10-26,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Ok but not special...
Bradley Ogden was one of three restaurants we tried during our Las Vegas stay. We liked the other two (L' atelier de Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand and Andre's at Monte Carlo Hotel) much better. Although being in the same price range BO was the least remarkable in food originality and quality. Service was below average (but to give him credit our waiter tried very hard and helped to make the overall experience somewhat acceptable). 
Based on my experience I would not recommend to go to BO since Las Vegas offers many other really excellent options.

The first annoyance...
You can only make a reservation at BO by giving your credit card number to them. You are then told that you can change or cancel by 3pm of the day of the reservation. Otherwise they charge a 50$ per person cancellation fee. Wow. I can understand such a thing in a 10 table 3star restaurant which is always fully booked and makes a real loss on a no-show - but not in a 50table hotel restaurant that was 80% empty when we arrived... This is simply arrogant. 

The food...
We started with a ""salt cured foie gras with...""  for 29$. Tasted like your typical foie gras pate, the sides were nice but not particulary interesting. Overall - ok. Price for Las Vegas ok too.

For the main course my friend had a Maine Lobster Salad (another starter) for 24$ which she told me was fresh and very tasty (I did not try it myself since there were only 4 small pieces of lobster in it and I did not dare to steal one). Overall - very good.

I had the a Red Snapper with spinach, grapefruit sauce and a chorizo paella (basically a small iron pan of fried yellow rice with chorizo and shrimp) for 42$. Price ok for Las Vegas, quality not: fish and rice both cooked a little to long and so the rice was to soft and the fish to dry. The chorizo was hardly recognizable which is remarkable in itself since chorizo normally is quite strong in taste.

The wine...
The wine list contains primarily American wines. Prices seem high. As an example we had the 2006 Williams Selyem Pinot Noir in Andre's the day bevor for 265$. In Bradley Ogden they had the same wine 1997 for 400$. I don't know about possible differences of vintage years there so I leave this for you to judge. We had some desert wine for the foie gras which was excellent and white wine by the glass for the main course which is not worth mentioning.

We passed on the desert and took two double espresso (5$ each) instead which came without any pastries. Coffee itself was a bit too sour. 

The service...
As pointed out our waiter himself was very good. The rest was not. It started with two waiters introducing themselves to us as our waiters - well they sorted that out later. We got the amuse bouche twice - well I do not complain about this one. The starter (foie gras) should have come with ""delicious organic brown bread"" and came without. When they finally managed to bring some bread we were almost finished with the starter. Obviously they wanted to get us out quickly then - the starter plates were collected immediately after we finished the starters and about 30 seconds later the main courses arrived. 
Later we found that our desert wine was on the check at 41$ per glass instead of the correct 12$ per glass. (Ok, they corrected that without discussion but it fits the general picture.",pqGewd-k2-K6SpwGyynjrw,1,0,3,BJUfSYBSPiVDOws3NcL8HA

2352365,2009-12-03,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"I was worried, having found many ""great"" food spots in Vegas major disappointments. But this one was excellent. Friendly service, great quality, and a relative value for the food and location. 

I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. The food service was handled by others, but she expedited a bit and everything moved along well. I had the fixed price option, three courses for $29, with two choices for entree and app. 

I opted for the Caesar salad, which was very fresh and perfectly dressed. Croutons could have been a bit less toasted, but no teeth were cracked and they had a delicious cheese flavor I couldn't quite place. It was a fair sized portion as well which never hurts. 

The burger is special in some way, refer to their marketing materials, but I do give them credit for an excellent version of the old classic. I opted for Blue Cheese (included in the price, no added charge, a miracle in Vegas, or perhaps I'm forgetting that it's a $29 burger to start with). The bun is clearly freshly made and had a brioche feel. The meat was perfectly cooked to my requested medium, and the combo with the cheese was very flavorful. I added a bit of mustard (they serve the burger with some condiments), lettuce and pickles. The lettuce was dressed and the pickles were home made (both sweet and dill). On the side was a fancy flute of french fries. These were pretty good, but perhaps too well salted. I loved the whole course, though the cheese was unevenly spread so I barely got any at first then the last bites were super salty and strong, minor complaint... 

I was getting full and asked for the check-- forgetting the final course. Fresh baked snicker doodles with home made butter scotch pudding. Sounded a bit odd in combo, but I stuck around for it. And that was the right choice. The cookies were a bit tiny, but they tasted great. The pudding was incredible, especially served with fresh whipped cream on top and a few toasted pepitos. One of my favorite restaurant desserts ever. 

So I would recommend this place for the fixed menu, and I would take a chance on the rest of the menu without hesitation.",QMvKdCyjwCzqQey1Y32nKQ,1,0,4,RJt7bbO3qyW9jvyCfJhF8w
2522946,2011-02-02,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"my fiancee and i dined here last week to celebrate her birthday.  we originally were going to get the prix fixe but felt like having steak again (we had just had steaks at BOA a few days before!  haha)

anyway, we were fans of Ogden having eaten at his Solvang joint ""Root 246"" last Spring when we went wine tasting.

the restaurant has a nice warmth to it; lots of wood and just dim enough to set the mood for a romantic albiet gut busting experience.

we started off w/ a glass of champagne and i had some cocktail which now i've totally forgotten about.  ok, let's get on w/ the food..

first we had the complimentary amuse bouche; it was a crab salad w/ crispy rice noodles w/ a hint of curry.  it was quite tasty and even tastier because the server accidentally gave us 2 servings each!  bonus!!

next we shared the caesars salad.  OH MAH GAWD.  hands down the best caesars salad i've ever had.  the dressing was bursting w/ intense flavor; the cheese, the anchovies...wow.  even the romaine lettuce was super fresh, crunchy and delish.  if i were to base this review on the salad alone, easily 5 stars.  i even used the bread they gave us to wipe up the dressing left over on the plate.  oh, and the croutons!  super crispy like they had been deep fried.  bravo Mr. Ogden.

my entree was the ribeye w/ fingerling pototoes and mushrooms.  unfortunately it was underwhelming.  good but not worth the $48 price tag.  i much rather have the ribeye from BOA or Ruth's Chris or even the Hawaiian ribeye from Houstons.  the meat was cooked perfectly, though; medium, just like i ordered it.  and it did have a nice 'woodsy' flavor, just as the name suggested.

my fiancee had the NY steak.  it originally came w/ beets and potatoes i believe.  the server (who was great, btw; excellent service albiet a little on the slow side) asked if she liked beets.  she hesitated and said 'they are okay.'  so he asked, ""what other vegetables do you like?""  carrots being her fav, she told the server.  viola!  her steak came on a bed of carrots and fingerling potatoes.  very nicely done.

after our entrees we were stuffed and asked to have our leftovers packed.  we passed on dessert but i was wondering if the restaurant would bring someting out since i had mentioned to the lady taking the reservation that it was my fiancee's birthday when she specifically asked ""do you have any special requests?""  but no.  it was a little dissapointing.  oh well.

i didn't say anthing and we were ready to get on our way but then our server brought us two, mini shots of butter scotch flavored butternut squash and whipped cream desserts!  he said he didn't want us to leave w/o having something sweet.  nice!

the minus one star accounts for two things:

1) ok, not great steak
2) when we opened up the leftovers, they completely left out all of my fiancee's carrots!!  what the hell?  that was her favorite part!  they just packed the meat and a few fingerlings (and the goat cheese croquet she didn't finish) but no carrots.  and she had a lot left over after her meal.  needless to say, she was bummed about that.

overall, great service, fresh and high quality food.  we're still fans of Mr. Ogden and are looking forward to tasting his other creations.",UaSBdxaE7TzKxfv6f5AUHA,0,0,4,fFeUU2Wez1MEMw1lIjmOgA

2581020,2009-05-24,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Perhaps one of the most underrated and anonymous high-end restaurants in all of Las Vegas, Bradley Ogden focuses on farm fresh, seasonal New American cuisine.  

Service was OK, but I don't necessarily think that was our server's fault, per se.  The table next to ours had at least 12 people, mostly of the high-maintenance (read: stupid) variety and needed a lot of help.  They were also loud and annoying, but that happens sometimes in the big V.

The food, though, more than made up for that.  Mentioned in many reviews here, the blue cheese souffle is otherworldly.  I'm not a huge fan of the ribeye cut (often find it too fatty), but here it was rich, buttery and delicious.

Next time I go back to Vegas, I'm returning to Bradley Ogden and having the hamburger.  Numerous sources, both on Yelp and in print, have deemed it one of the finest available.  We shall see.",dR9OiTIjuzvDdoqjuulKrw,0,0,4,h94gz_Bfvlq1ok_llWj1aw

My friend and I spent a day at the Qua Spa and decided to get a bite to eat. We had spotted this place after going to the Bette Midler show, and it seemed to be a place fit for foodies.

We saw there was a special lounge menu with a prix fixe menu offering a caesar salad, the ""best burger in vegas"" and the butterscotch pudding with snickerdoodle cookie. We opted for that, and because it was later at night, they allowed us to sit in the regular dining room.

The service seemed excellent at first, but then grew to be inconsistent. Sometimes the servers didn't fill our water glasses fully or didn't bring the bread until after a while. But when they were there, they were excellent. Not exactly what I'd expect from a Michelin restaurant.

The food also was good, but not exactly what I'd call the best burger in Vegas. I think Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was far more interesting. I opted to have blue cheese on my burger, and I felt there was too much, which made it a little too strong. I didn't know what a snickerdoodle cookie was, so I expected it to be like a snickers bar, but the server told me it was more like a sugar cookie.

Perhaps living in San Francisco has made me too much of a foodie so that the food at Bradley Ogden didn't seem much different from much cheaper, delicious restaurants I frequent in San Francisco. But if I lived in the suburbs, I would probably be very impressed. 

Maybe I should've ordered something other than the prix fixe menu, but if that was a representation of the food style, I don't think I'll be coming back. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill is right nearby so maybe I'll check that out next time.",CYG_BYUBSz9WZexdZzjRUQ,0,0,3,LsMIc87OtOhr6I8LWABLQg

After a day of wandering on the Strip and some gambling, we were able to get seated for dinner here with no reservation (a plus). I decided to go with the lounge menu prix fixe, three courses for a very reasonable $28. There were only two options for appetizer and two for entree; I picked the Caesar salad and the fish and chips. The one dessert option was a pudding with snickerdoodles.

The Caesar salad was delicious: crisp whole romaine leaves dressed in a traditional Caesar dressing (obvious anchovy presence which I love), and fresh parmesan on top. 

The fish and chips were disappointing. The french fries were very soggy. I was a little shocked that the french fries were less crispy and tasty than the ones I had for lunch at the Augustus Cafe (the 24 hour cafe in Caesar's). Maybe I just got a bad batch? The fish was also lacking in flavor and crispness. Really disappointing. In contrast, the entree my husband ordered, the gnocchi, was fantastic. 

The dessert was mediocre. The three mini snickerdoodles were probably homemade but honestly didn't really taste it. Pretty blah overall. The butterscotch pudding was okay but nothing special and frankly reminded me of Jell-O pudding. 

The service was pretty good; waters stayed filled and the order taken and food arrived in a timely fashion. I definitely felt that other tables were getting a little more attention but perhaps this was because we were casually dressed and I ordered off the lounge menu.

First off, I only review burgers.  My newly relocated cousin told me that the best burger he ever had was at Bradley Ogden within Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.  I had to verify so I made it a priority to visit.  We sat in the lounge area to the left of the main entrance.  I'm not sure if they serve the burger in the main dining area, but that wasn't a big deal to me.  I ordered the burger and am convinced that there is no better burger out there.  And I base that mostly on the quality of the burger patty.  It tasted like the best rib eye grounded up into a burger patty.  PERFECTION.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.  Any burger I eat will be held to this high standard.  It came with 3 condiment sides.  Fancy ketchup, fancy mustard and some other fancy condiment.  I tried a bite with each of these and none of them made the burger taste better.  I ended up finishing the burger without these condiments because I didn't want them tainting my perfect burger taste.  I heard some bad news that Bradley Ogden's lease is up at Caesar's Palace so it will be closing and possibly moving to another part of Las Vegas.  I regularly think about this burger and when I can have it again.

2959142,2008-09-04,1,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"I have to admit that I actually did not plan in advance to dine here.  For me, fine dining is a process that requires a tremendous deal of forethought.  I research possible restaurants, reading menus, looking at reviews on Yelp and Chow; and when I've narrowed it down to that one special place, I make the reservation.  Then, finally, comes the certain mindset that prepares me for the consumption of a memorable meal.  

We arrived in Vegas much later than intended and ended up at Bradley Ogden because it was one of the few restaurants still open that Friday night in Caesar's Palace.  Impromptu fine dining totally throws me off.

Since dinner was already spontaneous, we decided to sit in the adjoining lounge for our meal.  I was afraid that the service would be poor since we definitely weren't dressed for the occasion but the staff was very accommodating and our waitress was extremely attentive. Although I did feel that the service wasn't entirely sincere. 

Our complimentary bread consisted of a blue corn muffin and a dinner roll.  The corn muffin was springy, soft and delicious with corn bits distributed throughout.  As for the dinner roll, I would have traded it for another corn muffin.

I opted out of the tasting menu but made up for it with an appetizer of Hudson Valley foie gras torchon.  I'm sure it was meant to be shared because the mere dimensions of it widened my eyes with surprise.  It was a sizable round that was served with a black mission fig tart, bacon power, shallot confit and a center of foam.  The foie gras was extremely, extremely rich and I found myself wanting more of the tart towards the end.  It was hard to conserve the mouthwatering tart for the foie gras.

Old habits die hard but I veered from fish and indulged myself in some red meat in the form of oak grilled prime rib eye, medium rare, with sides of baby carrots, Bloomsdale spinach, and red wine essence.  This rib eye was really something -- I rarely say this but it was probably one of the best pieces of cow I've ever had.  The meat was ultra tender and at times my knife just slipped through the meat without much force at all -- it had just the right amount of fat.  I savored every bite of my plate. 

On this rare occasion, I passed on dessert, and instead took small bites from my friend's ice cream trio, which was part of the Summer pre-fix menu.  There were three rounds of vanilla bean, chocolate, and almond flavors.  The almond was quickly decided as the table favorite as it had almond bits and a strong sensual nutty flavor. 

I guess spur-of-the-moment dinners can be just as enjoyable as thoroughly researched ones.  Or, maybe, luck was on my side for once in Vegas.",e-5rPyejoNnqrVD0UpC8Ow,3,2,5,s3EWt6eOCip0EXFvg35znA

I hate doing this but we really wanted something where we could just hang out and take our time. Our server was Chris.  Awesome server! Moved us to the bigger cushier table without a hesitation. 

We looked over the menu and nothing really jumped out at us. I remarked how expensive the Kobe beef was and jokingly ordered half an ounce. At that point, Chris let us know that sometimes the chef will do a tasting menu not on the regular menu and will often include the Kobe beef and if we wanted to wait a minute he would go ask if the chef could do it. And guess what? He did! He offered us a six or nine course tasting menu and asked if there was anything we were opposed to. We chose the nine course and were not disappointed! We were actually brought out 12 courses which included some of the most creative and inventive dishes I've ever had. Since this dinner was the focus of our evening, we took our time. The key to a successful tasting menu in addition to the quality of food in my opinion, is the timing of dishes coming out. Everything was perfectly spaced with not too much nor too little time between each plate. 

After dinner, Chris invited us on a tour of the kitchen where we met the chef and his amazing staff. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Dinner total with one bottle of wine was $635. Money well spent!

While staying in Vegas for the long weekend, I read in one of those advertising booklet that Las Vegas has something called Restaurant Week.  It's like Dine about Town in San Francisco when restaurants have prix fixe meals at super bargain prices.  Restaurant Week ran from Sept 1-7 and a list of restaurants offered three-course meals running from $25.08 to $50.08.

I made an 8p reservation on the same day during the mid-afternoon.  They needed a credit card to hold the reservation which could not be cancelled less than 2hrs in advance.  I don't know what they'd charge otherwise.  Since Monday is probably the slowest day in Vegas, the restaurant was quite empty and didn't fill up until 930p or so.  When we first arrived, my husband and I were led to a booth with lush leather seats.  He pointed out how we didn't have to brush any breadcrumbs off the cushion like usual.  Well, we don't usually go to such a fancy restaurant either.

We chose the 3-course prix fixe special and added an entree:
Tuna Tartar in Clear Tomato Juice - A free amuse bouche!  I ate it before I remembered to take a picture.  Sorry.  The most interesting part was the tomato juice which was very good.
Cheese Souffle w/ Watercrest - I've never had souffle before.  It looked like a mini-muffin, cut like moist cake, and tasted like cheese.  Fantastic.  Watercrest was a little spicy.  I didn't recognize the taste of the vegetables but I ate them all anyway.
Seared Scallops w/ Sweet Yellow Corn Sauce - Perfectly cooked scallops but the flavorful sauce stole the show.
Pork Loin w/ Mushroom (and some sort of dough-y bits) - Excellent.  The best way I can describe it is ""really great steak"", except it's pork.  I had no idea that not all pork was created equal.  It was just a great piece of meat that happened to be perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I suppose pork is an art just like steak has different grades.
Coconut Rum Cake w/ Vanilla Bean Ice-cream - The cake turned out better than I thought because I don't really like rum and I didn't taste any!  The coconut cake was good.  The ice-cream was just ice-cream (unless maybe if they gave me more...).  Little bits of peaches, possibly dipped/simmered in simple syrup, was very tasty.  The little sprouts are kinda strange tasting so I picked them out.
Butterscotch Mousse w/ Whipped Cream and Walnuts - Another freebie!  Super buttery taste but we just couldn't finish the little shot glasses because we were just so darn full.  Will have to remember to avoid the bread next time but the spreadable butter was hard to resist.

My husband and I don't drink so we had two ice teas and a coffee.  Total tap: $112 plus tips.  That deal is probably impossible any other time at such a fancy place.",jKJPREWQEOw-LHYQiurk2A,2,2,4,YfrVOY0b6TrqR1_Er81wiA

It was divine when I broke through that little egg and the yolk spilled over the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. I've never been able to cook my squash to have the noodle consistency some claim spaghetti squash can have but this little side gives me hope there is a way to achieve it! I could have eaten just a giant bowl of  the egg and squash! But the real star was the chicken - so moist and well seasoned. It was a rather big portion of meat that my fellow diners were happy to help me with and it paired so well with the sweet and savory brussel sprout topping.

The other starters, mains and desserts ordered that night were the market salad, ceasar salad, oysters, blue cheese souffle, ribeye, short ribs, striped bass, ice creams, bananas fosters cake and panna cotta.

Todd Williams has enamored me with his food for the better half of the last decade from my frequent trips to Vegas and for all of the culinary standouts along the strip, I'm saddest to see Bradley Ogden go.

There was never a dull day in this Michelin Star monster of a Vegas restaurant. Caesars always had my nod, but it was Bradley Ogden that had attention. The food was excellent, incredible by some standards but nothing less than outstanding by any means. The same bodes for the rest of the establishment, easily among the strip's finest.

It didn't matter if you were a first time patron or a high status player, the service made sure everyone was well taken care of from the beginning to the end of their experience. The restaurant wasn't large, but it was beautiful in its own way - contemporary, sophisticated, and elegant up from the chic decor to the personalized table sets.

Like any high end restaurant, the menu was a seasonal hodgepodge of various creative edible outputs; the kind of food that is beyond anything typical, with little to nothing to reference for folks with novice palates. It's hard to pick a favorite meal when every plate had its own unique twist on it. Everything from a blue cheese souffle to their legendary burger to a seared foie gras with a scallop and potato puree had me dying for more. There wasn't anything that didn't tickle my tastebuds in a way where it didn't leave anything less than a stellar impression.

I always downgrade my expectations a notch or two for Las Vegas restaurants. What passes for 3 stars here would be fortunate to get  2 stars in a more discerning town. Nonetheless, onward.

Enjoyed a glass of Willamette Valley Pinot as the table was prepared. Soon seated, we were served by a friendly waiter who delivered excellent service throughout the meal. I started with 6 very fresh Kumomoto oysters served with a very good mignonette. Excellent.

A second glass of pinot anticipated the main course which arrived shortly. Duroc pork loin with potato rosti, braised red cabbage and granny smith apple. While tasty, the pork came out a bit dry and a touch overcooked. The potatoes and cabbage were fine. I only ate half the pork.

While I didn't order dessert, a short glass of butterscotch pudding appeared and was taken in two spoonfuls. Very good...much like the San Francisco version.

All in all a good, not great, meal.

My husband and I made reservations at Bradley Ogden to celebrate our anniversary, and spent the week debating the merits of each choice on the prix fixe menu.  When we walked in we were well-prepared and extremely excited about the meal.  I almost wondered if we had set ourselves up for a disappointment...

Disappointment was definitely not in Bradley Ogden's vocabulary.  Everything we had was absolutely delicious.  The hubster started had the poached prawns with cocktail sauce and lemon gel, and I had the twice-baked blue cheese soufflé.  Both dishes were everything we hoped for.  The prawns were plump and juicy, with the perfect amount of acid provided by the lemon gel.  My soufflé was creamy and pungent, with the pear sauce serving as a sweet counterpoint.  A fantastic start.

The second course was a little more difficult for me to decide.  The hubster knew he was getting the ribeye, and I had been debating the bass.  When the menu arrived, however, the bass had been replaced with salmon, so I also went with the ribeye.  Flavor, temperature, and accompaniment wise - absolutely 5 stars.  My steak was a perfect med-rare, the potato puree was buttery and indulgent, and fingerling potato chips provided a nice textural contrast.  I only wish that my steak had been trimmed with slightly more care - I felt as though I left a lot of gristle on the plate when I was through.

Our final course arrived, and despite being stuffed with steak, we immediately dug in to our desserts - bananas foster cake for him, buttermilk pana cotta for me.  Scrumptious, absolutely fantastic.  I had a bite of his peanut butter ice cream (fabulous without being overwhelmingly rich) and the densely delicious banana cake.  It was wonderful, but my pana cotta was to die for.  Intensely creamy, topped with a crisp phyllo cookie and tart cranberry compote...it reminded me of a re-imagined creme brûlée with berries.  

As if our meal wasn't already fantastic, our server also brought out a small shot glass with creamy butterscotch pudding.  It put us right over the edge, and we finally called it a night, though definitely not the last one we'll have at Bradley Ogden.",kkYsGbpZadE9skXgf9m9lw,0,1,4,LD2OnSRM4DX2-Qjcj1HSHA

I started with a glass of Perrier Jouet champagne while we waited for the remainder of our group in the lounge. The lounge was very comfortable with large, over sized chairs - almost like a living room. 

I started with the foie gras. 1.5 oz of sonoma foie gras seared with sea salt sprinkled on top.  It was served with a peanut butter mousse and pomegranate gastique on top of a peanut brioch toast stuffed with pear jam. It was delicious and very unusual. 

For my entree, I had the scallops with golden raisin with baby cauliflower confetti curry, flat top seared with sea salt and black pepper. The serving was a great portion, not too large but I was left very satiated. 

We had Quintessa Cabernet and the Grgich hills chardonnay with dinner. Finally, we finished the night with a glass of Patron aged in cognac barrels.

Basically, it's what it would look like before it's chopped up haha it was a little weird but I guess it was their signature way of doing it (I call it lazy).

3517481,2009-09-08,1,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"It was restaurant week so I thought I'd give Bradley Ogden a shot and I'm disappointed that I haven't tried this place sooner. I actually enjoyed this place more than my dinner at Daniel Boulud Brasserie a few nights before. The atmosphere, while not as elegant as DB Brasserie, felt more warm and inviting. We were seated at a cozy 2-top in the front half of the restaurant. I appreciate the fact that they space out the tables as to give diners a little privacy. Many places will cram in as many tables as possible, leaving diners about a foot apart from their neighbors (and I hate it when larger patrons have to squeeze by and their big ass knocks into my beverage). 

We ordered the prix-fixe restaurant week menu (which is also available on a nightly basis as their pre-theater menu).

FIRST COURSE
- Blue cheese souffle: smaller than I thought they would be. They look like 2 little muffins. The plating was nice and the flavors were great. The blue cheese souffle matched with the figs was fabulous.
- Yellow corn soup: as good as the blue cheese souffle was, this was even better. Creamy, yet not too thick or watery with a little bit of a kick from the spiced popcorn.

MAIN COURSE
- Alaskan halibut: one of the better fish dishes I've had recently -- delicate and flakey, tremendous flavor. I'm usually not a big fan of bok choy, but it went well with the fish.
- Pork loin: this dish had 2 sizable cuts of pork, both very tender and tasty. The star of this dish was the potato croquettes. There were only about three of them but I could have eaten a whole plate full of them. Fabulous!

DESSERT
- PB&J bread pudding: tasted much better than I thought it would. Subtle hints of peanut butter, not too overpowering. Warm, moist and delicious.
- White chocolate panna cotta: light, creamy, not too sweet. Accompanied with fresh berries. It was a really good dessert.
- Butterscotch pudding: loved it! It was a great way to end the meal.

The service was really good. Very buttoned-up and formal with the way they clear dishes and silverware between courses. I guess I don't know enough about fine-dining because I asked the server to bring me a new fork for my halibut. They were so quick to swap out silverware that I thought the small fork left on the table was the salad fork. It wasn't. It was a fork specifically for a fish dish. As the server pointed out it had three prongs like Neptune's trident and was designed to pair perfectly with the delicateness (is that a word?) of the fish. I'm an idiot for not knowing that. The server still brought out a regular fork, which I used. By the end of the night our server finally seemed to loosen up and joke around a little bit. Before that point he was a little too formal (all the servers wear suits which just adds to the stiffness of the service). A little personality always adds to the experience in my opinion.

The food here was excellent. We had the Spring Tasting menu.
I had:
Butter Rolls, Blue Corn Flour Muffin, Sourdough- 4 stars - Sourdough was not that great but the other two were awesome.
Blue Cheese Soufflé - 5 stars - The blue cheese was present but not like eating blue cheese (since I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese this was a plus)
Free Range Chicken with Pea Rissoto - 4.5 stars - Chicken was well done, the Peas were fresh and still crisp, and the Rissotto was perfect. I was hoping for some richer flavor in the jus.
Chocolate Mouse - unstarred - I was so full I couldn't eat another bite, well perhaps just a little taste it was very rich and tasted good, but since I wasn't able to truly eat it I'm not going to rate it.

Hubby & I made reservations a day or so before hand, for a Saturday sitting at 8:00 pm before the 10:00 pm Jay Leno show -- what a great evening, all around.

The host staff was professional, yet welcoming.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time, and we were seated immediately.

Our waiter greeted us promptly & explained the menu items -- both the prix fixe and the ala carte menu -- and gave us enough time to review & ruminate on the menu while reviewing the wine list and comparing our menu & wine options.  We had visited expecting to go with the prix fixe menu, but the ala carte was too tempting & we're not dessert persons -- so that made it easier.

We ended up sharing the Twice-baked Maytag blue cheese souffle & the chef prepared it on two plates for us so we didn't have to fight over it on one plate.  The souffle was delicious, and we enjoyed the sourdough bread from the breadbasket for a great starter.

I ordered the prime ribeye -- cooked perfectly as ordered med-rare.  It was on a bed of Yukon gold puree with pea sprouts, frisee & arugla.  The combination of meat juices with the potato puree on the wilted greens was wonderful.  Delicious meat -- tender, flavorful, nicely marbled.

Hubby ordered the South Dakota bison tenderloin -- probably the most beautiful pieces of meat I've ever seen & the presentation was lovely with the chickpeas & onions and greens for garnish.  I realize I didn't get a good picture of the tenderloin cuts after he moved the chard & sliced the meat.  It was perfectly cooked with a crisp & dark crust and bright pink to red center with the finest grain I've ever seen in a ""meaty protein"".

We went with a Neal Family 2005 Napa Cab (perfect with the meal), and skipped dessert and coffee -- but we did get a lagniappe of butterscotch pudding in a tall shot glass, topped with whipped cream and pepitas (roasted pumpkin seeds).  The perfect size for a dessert for me!

The waitstaff was well trained & very proficient -- the waiter was well spoken & he explained Chef Ogden's philosophy quite well.  The support staff (water, bread, bussing, etc) were all timely, yet not obtrusive.  The sommelier was interesting & fun to talk with.  Did you know they recycle their corks?  Wolfgang Puck doesn't (as I found out a few days before).

Total bill pre-tip was $260 - pricey, but well worth it.  FYI -- check out the lounge menu too -- there's a smaller prix fixe menu there too.

You see, I love to go to nice restaurants, but am never one to order the most expensive item on the menu. So my little trick is to go to a fabulous place and take in the atmosphere and sample the food in the bar. Here they actually offer the full menu as well as an abbreviated lounge menu. Why I ended up eating at this Michelin-starred restaurant is that they had a $29 prix fixe option. Now you're speaking my language.

Our experience was one of my highlights in Vegas. Not because the food was the best I ate during my trip, but it is the only place where I felt the level of service was not only excellent, but funny, warm and welcoming. We actually had an authentic moment with someone.

Our group was in the mood for a small meal after seeing a Cirque show, so we power walked through the casinos to beat the rest of the masses to grab corner seats at the bar. Perfect to view the flesh parade in the casino as well as the rowdy cougar convention next to us. I didn't want a huge meal, so Mr. K and I ended up sharing the 3-course prix fixe. But rather than roll their eyes, they went all out. Each course included two plates, not one, and the only thing split in half was the entree, their famous burger. So, two salads and two desserts and they didn't even assess a split plate charge. Our friends chose to skip the other courses and just ordered burgers, and they brought them desserts on the house. 

Oh, and that dessert. Butterscotch pudding with snickerdoodle cookies for dipping. Simple and fabulous. All of the food was just what I was looking for... elegant twists on comfort food. The burger was singled out as ""Best Burger of the Year"" (2009)"" by GQ Magazine and while I wouldn't go that far, it is something special.

So perhaps the generosity was because we were enjoying many Maker's Mark cocktails, but I think they just may be a classy place that believes that the dining experience includes superior food and service. I had a lot of fun with the bartender who had his hands full that night with the 'ladies' down the bar. When we left, I said, ""Good luck with that"" and I meant it.

Went to Bradley's specifically for the lounge burger I've heard so much about. The place was packed.  Busy night.  

We opted not to have a beverage.  All the specialty cocktails are $17.  Too rich for my blood.  The wine by the glass ranged from $11 - 30.  The $11 choice being a Gewurtz and $12 for a Reisling...no thank you.  The pinot noir and chardonnay were in the $16 range. yowsa!

We ordered 3 burgers.  $19 each.  After 45 minutes (this is not an exaggeration) we got them.  We were ravenous by this point! And then, OH NO!!! my burger was wrong wrong wrong! Covered in blue cheese, which I just can't do. 15 minutes later I got a new one.

The burger was delicious. Really delicious.  Approx 1/3 - 1/2 lb. dripping juicy slightly bloody fresh ground steak, topped with melted cheddar on a thick bun.  Fresh housemade pickles served on the side with a nice mesclun salad tossed perfectly in a sweet balsamic dressing.  The fries are rough cut and salty and good.

After, we got the butterscotch pudding and fresh snickerdoodles.  A tasty, whimsical treat served in a shot glass with a sweet ittle demitasse spoon.

The food was good, very good; but if someone told you ""you have to wait 1 hour and pay $20 for a burger but it'll be good"" what would you say?  I'd say thanks but no thanks.  

Since our food took SO long and came out incorrect, Bradley's did the right thing and removed it from the check.  So all in all, I left very full and happy circa two hours later, but I can't imagine I'll be going back.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,3,2,3,nhGFDNofI7e8vf6rg2jKsw

we had a pretty huge party so they were able to give us this little room that they have sectioned off, it had a long table and glass windows so we didn't exactly have too much privacy, but it was nice. they had this little fountain next to us as well which i suppose is suppose to be peaceful.

the menu however is kind of small and there isn't a wide selection, but i guess they didn't really need it since everything on the menu was delish!! 
since we had such a big party we almost ordered everything on the menu that night. 

so i had a green salad to start off, which was decent and the only reason why i say so is because i regret not getting the caesar. i had a bite of my bros and it was so good, had a hint of bacon and the dressing was not overpowering. the soup, a chestnut, which i didn't thik i would be fond of, but it also surprised me. it had the texture of a bisque almost and didn't have a strong taste, but it was something everyone enjoyed! 

i had the pork loin, which i think is a hard thing to make because it can easily be made very dry, but here it was almost perfection!! mom had the scallops which were also done medium, but came out very delicious. and from what i hear the rib eye was also very good!! 

the service was impeccable, however the bill is a little high, but i guess you kind of assume that coming into a restaurant like this. also, we had told them we needed to rush a couple orders cause my bro and his gf needed to rush to catch a show and they were completely understanding and accommodated to all our needs!",JHOwFfCBXpe6gG1lsWQ22A,0,0,5,BI1LcJEXlkM8YzK1oPt4EQ

My husband and I both ordered off the 3 course, $59 prix fixe menu. I did enjoy my blue cheese souffle to start and I would have to say its one of the most unique things on the menu. My husband's caesar salad was good but nothing special. I had the fish for the entree, I wish I could remember what kind. It was some sort of white fish. It was decent, but perhaps a little over salted. My husband had the chicken which he said was good but did not compare to a similar entree he had for lunch at Spago. I had the banana fosters for dessert which I wasn't crazy about and I left about half on my plate (doesn't happen often with desserts for me). My husband had a peanut butter dessert thing which like most of the meal was good but not spectacular. We did both enjoy the complimentary butterscotch pudding that came with the dessert. 
A few notes about the restaurant aside from the food:
Price wise, I didn't think it was too bad but I was a little in shock that my cocktail was $17. The only time I had paid that much for a cocktail before was at Mastro's in Costa Mesa but it was essentially 2 1/2 drinks for that price since I got my margarita in my glass as well as everything in the cocktail shaker. I expected that here too for the price but all I got was an average size drink that tasted a bit below average. Way too sweet for my liking.
Service was polite but a little lacking. Our appetizers came out before the bread. Had I not noticed that people sitting next to us had gotten bread and specifically asked for it, I doubt we would have been given any. I don't recall ever going to a restaurant and having that happen, not even a place like Cheesecake Factory, let alone a supposed fine dining establishment. 
I found it a bit disconcerting to be at a restaurant that seemed like it was trying to evoke a calm, quiet environment yet we had a clear view of the middle of the casino and we could hear the noise of it pretty loudly throughout the meal. I've eaten at quite a few restaurants in Vegas casinos before and its never bothered me before. Perhaps their acoustics weren't the greatest. With that being said, I do have to say I liked our booth. It was similar to the cabana style booths at Nobhill. 
Only after we had ordered our meal and been served our appetizers did we notice several tables next to us ordering the supposed ""best burger in Vegas"". We asked about it and they told us it was off the bar menu. I knew there was a bar menu with a burger but our server never informed us that we had the option to order from it. Our server just said that we could do that ""next time"". Hmm, not sure there will be a next time. With so many places to pick from in Vegas and even in Caesars, I doubt that I will be back after a merely mediocre experience.",USoDds58VsEJXyVmfp7kBg,0,0,3,cMUunyRlsgkMTAbp_R9lHQ

The burger is part of a prixe fixe menu, where for 30 bucks you get a salad, entree, and desert.  The staff was very accommodating when we asked if we could split two entrees  among our group of four.  We requested caesar salad and Ogden does an unique twist on it.  They serve large pieces of romaine, nicely flavored with the dressing, and a nice bit of anchovy and garlic.  This is topped by a generous portion of shaved Parmesan.

The burger is extremely flavorful, and is served with condiments on the side, including ketchup and mustard.  Also included is a generous serving of excellent fries.

For desert, we had some amazing butter scotch pudding (high praise from me, who doesn't really go for pudding).

Even splitting the meal, we were all well satisfied.  We'll definitely be back here on our next visit to Sin City.",PBcTLTUwU39hKQq18Jo_dg,2,0,5,Fyscrp6aT2_mC1PTd5VZCg

After doing some research on this Michelin rated restaurant @ the Caesars, I decided to come here with my girl friend on our first night in Vegas and had a wonderful experience.

Everyone was really nice and warm, especially our waitress Alexis. She was very knowledgeable about all the food, and explained all the dishes to us in a very suave mannerism. Listening to her talk about the food was like music to our ears. We did not decide on the special prix fixe dinner, but instead ordered the bar prix-fixe and a side order of their famous cod, which was amazing. it was super tender, juicy, and flavorful. A little bit pricey as a single entree though, so if you're going to get that, getting the prix fixe that includes that is a better deal. 

We really wanted to try the kobe beef slider/burgers that's on the bar menu that everyone raves about, so we got that prix fixe which included a caesar salad (even that was super fresh and tasty), the burger, and then a dessert that had a sugar cookie and a tirimisu mousse cup. They said that they didn't have the kobe beef anymore, but it was the wagyu, which was still super high-grade. The burger was undeniably one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was sooooooooo juicy and flavorful and just omg, mouthgasm. The dessert was just ok, but must compliment on the breads here! They're served fresh out of the oven and still warm, and the mini ones that are sweet and the little muffins are just so good! I got seconds and still finished everything.

Overall, it was a good experience that I enjoyed a lot. But maybe because I've been spoiled by going to Joel and Daniel Bouloud already in the past, this is stil 4 stars to me. Perhaps one day when I come back again I will get the full prix-fixe, but I would definitely want to just come by the bar and get a burger! :D",4SzBoG7EbYhsynUNXyDB1w,2,1,4,G6W82DR619lYXPudJWiWxg

There were 7 of us and we decided to go for the tasting menu with wine pairing.  Looking over the menu, we wanted to swap out the 'common' salmon dish with a quail dish.  The waiter pointed out that the salmon dish was actually one of their most popular, and so, we decided to order the quail on the side.

I'm so glad the waiter and suggested we keep the salmon, because it was the BEST salmon dish I've ever tasted.  Slow-cooked to perfection!

The entire meal itself was the most memorable and delicious meal!  Everything was precisely excuted, presentation was clean and spot on, the service was definitely 5-stars (we even had the chefs come out to serve one of the dishes).

We were at the bar with only one other couple. Unless you had all your attention focused on me and my feet, you would have no idea that my sandals were not on.  Spawn of Satan appeared in a nano second and in a Darth Vader laced voice breathed heavily in my ear: ""PUT YOUR SHOES ON!'

Anyways, we ordered the risotto with black truffles, twice baked maytag blue cheese soufle, Bison tenderloin (med rare),  and Duroc pork loin (med). The risotto was extremely good. I'm not a big truffle fan, but it went very well with the risotto. I had the chance to try the blue cheese soufle, even though I really hate blue cheese. This was surprisingly good as the blue cheese flavor was very mild in taste. The bison tenderloin was cooked perfectly and the pork loin was good. We had the chocolate peanut butter trifle for dessert which was very good. They also brought out some kind of minty mouse ""from the chef"" which was also good.

The only negative part that we had was the service. It was damn awful. After being seated by the hostess, we waited at least 10 full minutes before even being approached by our server. Refills for water and coffee took forever.

He also brought the entire table a seafood amuse bouche after we explicitly discussed that one person in our party didn't eat seafood.

Each time we tried to inquire about portion size (to figure out how many appetizers to order), our waiter would quickly leave our table, saying he'd come back once we had decided what to order.  At one point, we expressly said ""don't leave"" but he walked away anyways.  The tables that were seated after us received bread and drinks before we could even get the waiter to answer our questions.

After speaking to the host about getting a different waiter, we were assured they would correct the problem. We then received a condescending tone and fake smiles from the same waiter.  

The caesar salad was over dressed, and the chicken, while perfectly cooked, smelled like it was stuffed with trash.  The wine list is outrageously priced by anyone's standards.  Our vegetarian received a plate full of vegetables piled on top of each other after insisting that the waiter ask the chef to make a collection of sides.

That said, the rest of the food was delicious, and the portion sizes were large. However, the service was so awful the whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths. I cant imagine Bradley Ogden would condone this type of service.

our party of 9 was seated in this room near the front window that had another table of 9 (just about to leave): 8 ladies and 1 man....all over the age of 60.  i couldn't help but think, that could be us in 30 years (minus the old man of course).  so cute!  we were all dolled up and our bride was wearing a crown and a sash, so of course we were drawing attention.  when they left, one of the ladies came and asked what we were celebrating...we told her.  she complimented us, telling us how beautiful we were (awww.....).  then she said ""are you all related?  you all look alike.""  okay, so sweet, but so wrong.  granted, we were all asian, but you had 2 japanese girls, 3 vietnamese girls, and 4 chinese girls.  poor sweet old lady.  if it were anyone else, i would've busted out my ""not all asians look alike"" comment.  

when you're shelling out this amount of dough in a fancy restaurant, the thing that puts it over (other than the food), is the service.  our waitress was superb!  she took her time with us, but could tell we weren't in to close the place, so even asked us if we needed to be somewhere at a certain time.  we told her we had plans so she took excellent care to not let courses drag, and not rush us either.  she even helped us play a couple of the ""bachelorette games"" with us.  

the sommelle (is that how you spell the name for the wine guy?), comes to recommend a wine.  we order our food.  the bread guy comes to each of us and offers us three choices.  i love that they were big enough only for 2-3 bites, so you could taste all three of them.  there was a sourdough, a mini regular roll and a blue corn muffin.  i loved them all, but the muffin was my favorite.

either it was because the menu wasn't very large or we gals all have the same taste, because 3 of us ordered lobster, 3 ordered the rib eye, and 3 ordered the burger (from the lounge menu which was more ""casual"" and cheaper).  the lobster looked tiny when it arrived, but i couldn't believe how much meat there was.  our waitress called it the ""lazy man's lobster"" since it's already popped out of the shell for you.  i'd never had beets before and paired with the lobster, it was yummy!  i took a bite of the rib eye too which was good, but i'm still not a steak lover.  the gals who got the burgers said it was really good, and the fries too.

we didn't order dessert, but we ended our dinner with vodka shots w/a pickle chaser.  yes.....here is where i learned that a pickle chaser helps when taking vodka shots.

My friends and I bid farewell to Bradley Ogden, which is closing on August 5th. Although I have meant to come here numerous times I've never made it. I figured I better do it now, before I can't anymore.

We showed up around 6 PM on a Saturday evening and were greeted by a nice, yet not in particularly attentive hostess. She ended up seating us at the bar, but in a portion of the bar that was to be used for a private party. We were unceremoniously swept to another area of the crowded bar and hastily shoved in a corner by the hostess and another, rather brusque woman. 

So it didn't start off well. At least the bar service made it all better. Our bartender was impeccable, kept an eye on our drinks, and fulfilled our needs with ease. I had the Riesling ($12), two glasses, a 2010 from Willamette Valley. Honestly it was one of the best Rieslings I've had. It even outshines many German Rieslings I tend to stick with.

Moving on to the Pre-Fixe Lounge menu. Of course I ordered the Hamburger, cheddar cheese, the Bradley Ogden Ceaser Salad for starters, and ended with the butterscotch pudding accompanied with two snickerdoodle cookies.

The burger really was delectable (ordered Medium, and usually I go with medium well) and had that fresh farm taste that very good meats tend to have. If you can taste the fact the cow is eating well, that is good meat. The burger came accompanied with fries, a mayo, a spicy mustard, and a ketchup. The mayo was heaven, I even dipped my fries in it (FATTY ALERT). 

BUT - I think I may have enjoyed the Ceaser Salad even more. It was crisp, perfectly seasoned, the croutons were crunchy and perfect. I mean, I don't understand how a salad can really be that good, but honestly, it was! 

Lastly, the dessert was light, not super decadent. It is a nice end to the meal, especially after having eaten the heavy burger. The snickerdoodles were soft and complimented the butterscotch pudding.

The presentation of the fois gras ($29) was unusual and appealing. The crepe was half rolled making it easy to get a forkful, and the orange curd and cara cara orange segments added the perfect amount of tartness and sweetness to the dish. The only complaint was that the fois was cut too thick, decreasing the surface area available for getting the dark sear that is a must. We agreed if they had cut the piece in half and doubled the surface area, the dish would have been more successful and not felt as heavy. The rock shrimp ($17) were certainly crispy, as advertised, and were tossed in a sweet sauce. Normally this would be something I would devour completely but in this case the cook used too heavy a hand with the salt, making it difficult for me to eat more than a few.  Other than that, it was near perfect in execution. The 'fish' was battered well and the black cod they used was buttery and flaky, yet something about it tasted very heavy, and almost creamy on the interior of the batter. Between the five of us we left one piece on the plate, so something about it obviously made it hard to eat more than one. The burger ($19) was excellent, but for the money I'd rather go to Binion's (you must go try one here). If you want to sit in a more sophisticated environment while you eat your burger , however, (is that oxymoronic?) then Bradley Ogden would be the better pick and possibly worth the $13 price increase. Possibly. I must say I was dissapointed with the fries that came with both the burger and fish, especially for a restaurant of this caliber. Although they were hand cut and looked great, they weren't super hot and tasted somewhat stale, as if they had been held under a heat lamp too long. I know they would have been a million times better if they were fresh, but imagining what they could have tasted like didn't make me happier.

The only other time I went to Bradley Ogden I had the roast chicken, which truly impressed me. I could imagine someone who grew up on a farm tasting it and saying, ""now this is how chicken is supposed to taste."" Our lounge meal was very good, but if you want the wow factor from a restaurant with a reputation such as Bradley Ogen, I'd get the chicken.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,1,1,4,P-Mp6aykHTjL1SBVIb3Cgw
4492891,2008-03-23,0,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,Looking for a place to eat on a Saturday night we wandered over from the Bellagio after our attempts of getting in to the buffet were dashed due to a very long line at 9pm (March Madness/Easter Weekend). Having never been here we decided to give em a try. Dress code seemed formal but they didn't mind me wearing a baseball cap. Nice atmosphere with medium shades of wood trim and crisp white table cloths. Service was quick and attentive with the drink refills and bread service. I had a Caesar salad that was tasty with some of the best croutons i can remember. Seared yellowfin tuna  was average but it had a nice side sauce. My main entree was the Colorado Lamb rack and shoulder over rissoto that was tender and excellent. For dessert was a Espresso layer cake that i wish i had more of. Downside is this place is a little pricey and the servings seem a little small for a big eater like myself but you're not over stuffed.,T_RiQ-TOeZf8N2kiCNCiSg,0,1,4,TmHeyALRdyO9WNvGSj8T8Q

We had a little bit of trouble finding it in the massive Caesars Palace, but once we did we were impressed with the decor. Beautiful restaurant and an intimate and cozy feel to it. I ordered a glass of the house white (the wine list was RIDICULOU$$) and the oysters to start. I love oysters and these were very, very good. No big, fat, gross ones which was a relief. My friend got the Foie Gras which was divine. For my main I ordered the Rib Eye, which I regretted because although it was tasty, the cut was a bit too fatty for my liking and the red wine sauce was virtually non-existent. My friends got the Scallops (really good), the Salmon (a little undercooked), and the Risotto (weird texture). Our dishes were presented beautifully. We did feel that the servers were a little abrupt, if not rude, but perhaps that's because we were 4 young ladies and maybe they didn't think we were their ideal clientele. However, they brought out the complimentary butterscotch pudding shots after the meal and we felt bad about criticizing them. After receiving the bill ($18 for a glass of house wine?!?! GET OUTTA HERE) I paid my $120 share, a bit too steep in my opinion. Afterwards, we stood out front and took some pictures, and the Executive Chef for Caesars came out to speak with us. He asked how our meal was and gave us his card for future trips to Vegas, which was really nice. All in all, it was a good meal, but not worth the price in my opinion.",eWyhZ-114SqkZkG0RyJG9A,0,0,3,lKCL8MDKntiNdN830u3oaQ

Jonesing for steaks, we saw the faux James Beard accolades and went in. The front room has a more upbeat vibe for groups, while the back room is more chill for couples, etc.  

We went off the pre-theater prix fix menu and ordered the oak-grilled steaks and split the shrimp cocktail and Maytag Blue Cheese souffles. All expertly executed and tasted great.  The appetizers were small enough to where I didn't think the dinner would be so big. Boy was I wrong. The steaks were a good size and pretty much put me in an embarrassing meat coma.  A tip - there are two sauces on the side. Not that you need them but you can always ask for a sample and try. Also delicious.

We ordered the mac and cheese and creme fraiche potatoes which was sooo delicious and put me in a standstill.  The dessert are regulation size cheesecake and creme brulee. The entire meal was really delicious and well-prepared.

The service between our waiter and the sommelier was fantastic. My only complaint is that the wine list was really expensive. Example, a half bottle of Cornerstone Cabernet was $68.  You can get that for half anyplace else.

First let me say that the service was outstanding - it's rare to find a top of the line place in Vegas that will seat a group of 15(with reservation made that morning). Our servers were prompt and knowledgeable, both about the food and the wine, which expedited our evening and allowed us all to sit back, relax and have fun during the meal.

Everyone tried something a little different, though several folks went off of the prix fixe menu, and they all highly suggested it. I skipped the appetizers and although I ogled the Kobe Beef, I went straight for the Prime Ribeye. It was perfectly cooked. And when I say perfectly cooked, I mean PERFECTLY melt in mouth, medium rare. Although it didnt come with any sides(you order them on your own) it was extremely filling, and beyond delicious. Finishing it off with butterscotch pudding was the icing on the cake, and was so sweet it took away the sting of those gambling losses over the week.

We started with the oyster amuse bouche which was lovely and delicate.  I had the squab as the starter and although I was so tempted to pick that little sucker up and eat it with my hands, I thought better of it.  It was nicely roasted and very evenly seasoned.  And though it was kind of hard to eat, I think I managed to scrape all the meat off those tiny bones.  I had a taste of my friend's onion soup with was velvety and rich.  
Next stop was the sturgeon - a serious misstep on my part.  The fish was cooked very well, but the sauce on the scallop dish blew the sturgeon out of the water....(pun intended).  
Everyone else had the short-rib (a trend that I do enjoy but am rather tired of).  But I, being the soul-less foodie that I am went with the veal chop.  It was a nice bone-in, thick cut of baby cow.  I'm forgetting the accompaniments now, but it was a nicely seasoned piece of meat.
The dessert was the baked alaska which fell short of my favorite incarnation at the Oceanaire.  It had a nice charred merengue over huckleberry and a lemon poppyseed cake.  A little tart, but refreshing after the meat heavy meat.

TWICE BAKED MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE SOUFFLE-too much blue cheese. I know, why did I get it?! I love blue cheese, but it overpowered everything on the plate. Nice texture, great presentation.
PAN ROASTED ALASKAN HALIBUT-this was delicious, the fish was cooked soooo well and the watermelon broth, definetly simple, and genious.
BANANAS FOSTER CAKE-had better. Still very good, not big enough though. Banana foster to me cant be gourmet, dont make it to be, just let it be:)

DUO OF FOIE GRAS-all delicious , but on the seared style they missed a few veins. Made it hard to eat.
OAK GRILLED RIBEYE- Im a picky steak person, and I always have something to down it. This was a great pick. I ended up eating his leftovers:)

I'd recommend skipping the ""signature Caesar"", which paled in comparison to both the fresh corn soup and blue cheese souffle. 
My main was a perfectly cooked Alaskan halibut, served with olives and fennel. Tried the bison loin, which was also very well cooked. 
Desserts were all quite tasty, a peanut butter and jelly bread pudding which has just the right amount of peanut richness and berry sweetness, and the berry panna cotta was the light perfect dessert. They ended with a bonus dish: a salted butterscotch pudding with pepitas which ended the meal on a high note. $60 for a three course tasting menu of this caliber is quite reasonable.",DhJ1RSmlh8GCIWsYUNN0dg,2,0,4,YIBzael4CHXB8olTDBzC9Q

ANYWAY! What I DO remember:

Dark woods, gleaming glass and silverware, quiet enclave, group dinner. Startled, cute-ish white male waiter in his smart suit, tending to our grandiose demands with a charmed look of shock and rolling along with us all quite gamely.

Male Asian friends flossing with their Rolies and Tag Heuerwerses. Me and my female friends with our cleavage all out, our hair all done up, our jewelry and lips shining at equal wattage, teeth flashing in laughter and expectation of SUCH good food and SUCH good dancing to come, and it's only 9:30 pm at night and the night is oh so young.

And a bottle of SOME fricken white wine our gourmand pinoy boy (my foodie soulmate) ordered that got us ALL in trouble because none of us could walk straight to the bathroom down the sexy restaurant hallway, and our breasts kept startling the wankers over 40 heading back down the hallways to their plastic, sourpussed wives (puss having more than one meaning, eh? EH?!).

We were regal, we were generous, we were laughing, we were Vegas - as others have posted, sex, great food, great wine, great service. The only dish I remember was the risotto, I think there was blue cheese in it, or maybe that was a mushroom risotto and the blue cheese was the souffle but either way godd*mmit I was in heaven and my mouth was having sex with the food and the wine and we were giddy and our lightweight resident Asian girl was a giggling nonsensical mess.

We were all in that magical state of just shy of stupidity, just before drunkenness actually hits, the kind of sly stupor a really hot makeout kiss gets you into, on the verge of dumb enough to have sex when you shouldn't or where you shouldn't, pheromones and seratonin, a happy place that only great food and friends and talk and wine and ambiance can bring you to.

We were there. I can't promise anything, but you might try it. Order a couple really good bottles of wine and bring out the cleavage and the Rolies. Vegas misses you.",XIR1_GVjl2M2P9uit2kxpA,0,1,4,lsaHahRTjsx3A0xNGDBjlQ

I thought I was going to get a filet mignon wrapped between buns or similar to that; but alas, it was the ground beef type of burger.  Don't get me wrong, the burger was juicy, it was tasty, and my goodness it was the best burger I have ever eaten.  However, if you think about it, how good can a burger be??? EXACTLY!  It can't get that much better.  For 1/3 the price, I can get a really delicious and juicy burger elsewhere.  On a scale of 1-10, Bradley Ogden's burger is a 10, In-N-Out is a 9.  So save your burger experience, and get something else if you dine here.

Aside from the burger, the appetizer oysters were good.  I am not an oyster person, so probably not the best judge.  The foie gras was like any other foie gras.  They tried to be a creative by adding a waffle to it, but it didn't enhance the dish that much.  Pork was delicious!  Try that dish.  

Excellent service.  I like Bradley Ogden, but I probably won't be back given all the other food choices that are available.  But it was an overall good experience (except for the $19 burger).   Gosh I am bitter.",J5tJo-hoZtG6FNvllUDaJA,0,0,3,d1mbwghdOV8i-FWMnoctyA

The foie was one of the coolest foie preparations I've ever had. It had a peanut butter mousse and a pomegranate jelly and toast. Sort of a pb&j take on it. MMMM

So I'm on the fence on whether the $29 burger + salad + dessert is a good deal vs the $19 burger. The pudding and cookies is downright incredible and probably worth the $10 to me, but the caesar salad was  boring. I guess that's a decision you'd have to make for yourself! 

The burger was definitely amazing. Merlot - butter.. yup, f-ing MERLOT BUTTER is on this burger. The beef is rich and delicious and he forms it with the perfect blend of sirloin/ribeye/etc to make sure it's fatty and delicious. The bun is perfect. The cheddar cheese is perfect. Is it worth $19? I dunno, it was to me but I know some people just wouldn't get enough enjoyment out of it ! Is it the best burger in Vegas? It's definitely in the top 2 (sorry, I love my kobe at Burger Bar too much to just overlook them). 

Oh lastly I'd like to add dining in the BO lounge is a great way to have a relatively cheap special dining experience. We ate here for our anniversary before going to see Elton John and were pleased with how far our $100 took us. Drinks, bread, yummy foie gras and a HUGE  gourmet burger. Oh and salad and bada** dessert too. 

If you've been dying to try a piece of BO but can't justify his $100ish per person price tag, pony up $20 for a burger !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,0,0,4,r8cplhO_aIebtnfWOCkWQQ

Entrees included Pork loin with Potato Rosti and braised cabbage - incredibly flavorful Duroc pork, but a tad tough, and a butter soft and buttery flavored New York Strip that was fabulous.

We anticipated a peanut butter and jelly bread pudding, but it wasn't on the menu that night, so we settled for French Toast bread pudding with semifreddo, fried dates and citrus.

5342221,2012-06-22,1,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Oh boy, I am in Vegas to attend a professional trade show. Oh boy. I must comment on 2 restaurants we ( co-worker and I) tried, to soften the strain of being stuck for 8 hours in super-refrigerated conference rooms then fried to a crisp in the streets upon release. The first of these 2 restaurants is Bradley Ogden. (The other one is at the Wynn, and I will review it tomorrow. Stay tuned, Dino!)

We hit BradleyOgden at around 9:30 pm on Saturday night. Maybe the staff was tired, or had a bad day (or bad night. One never knows what time it is in Vegas, ah ah) but although the place was almost empty, we could barely get any attention. (Although, next to us, was a table of 6 people tasting multiple fine wines with their meal and they got all the maitre d' and sommelier' s attention one can dream of...). My co-worker is a nice-looking tall white guy, I am a non-glamourous white chick. The hostess at the front desk comes and goes and ignores us. No one seems to see us for 10 minutes. There are plenty of open tables in the restaurant but somehow they sit us by the busy drinking sixsome. Our assigned waiter was flippant and mostly absent - especially when he learnt we would not be ordering booze. The food came very slowly. The atmosphere was ZERO. At some point I went to the bathroom and encountered in the corridor (within the restaurant) a uniformed employee - bartender or waiter, who knows- walking in the opposite direction, and instead of stepping aside to let me go by as any gent would do, a fortiori an upscale restaurant's employee, he marched steadily forward, not showing signs of seeing me or willingness to acknowledge my presence. So I decided to do the same, reasoning "" I am a woman and I am the customer! I have priority!"" He finally moved over grumbling"" Okay!"" as we crossed paths, as if I had offended him by taking the lead. I thought to myself ""Who trained these employees?""

Now the food was good, as is the case in all the top notch eateries of LV. It is also beautifully presented. And each ingredient in my plate had its own distinct burst of flavor. But it is also crazily overpriced (hey, I live in the Bay area: I live by quality cuisine in top notch restaurants! And, sure, they can't grow baby arugula in the back yard of the Caesar's Palace& Casino or catch wild salmon in the Bellagio pond, but I think tripling the price of entrees in Las Vegas is more reflective of a state of mind than the cost of food transportation). So when the service is mediocre -here downright insulting-  and moreover the fish is overcooked -and it was, Mr Ogden, sadly it was-, even if the veggies were tasty and the dessert divine ( the co-worker and I shared the Strawberry Napoleon with basil sorbet and almost fought over it), I scream bloody dismay. And I vent on Yelp, yep, because, see, I clearly do not have the right profile to get the attention of the restaurant's manager otherwise...",shxRU0OPiIHV57Yc-hIjow,1,1,2,4SHGl2DZt6gyO_JYfHq3pA

For my birthday weekend extra-gabanza, Vegas was the destination and burgers were on my brain. Well just one really. After countless hours search Vegas talk threads, reading endless reviews, and cross checking against all other foodie sites, I settled on Bradley Ogden for my sole Vegas burger.

Hidden in the dark depths of Caesar's Palace, it was quite the hike to get to the restaurant. Once inside and seated with our cohorts, I began to scan the menu for my burger. IT WASN'T THERE! Freaking out, I feverously asked our server if I could still order the burger I thought they had. Then we all learned that all the food we had wanted was on the bar menu. So in true uncouth manner, we all stayed in the dining room and all ordered from the much cheaper bar menu. I got the burger, medium-rare, as part of a 3 course meal. I also added the foie since it was my birthday week. 

First came an amuse bouche of I have no idea. The flavor was indescribable as I cannot for the life of me remember a single thing about it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=ofjbhlxnYs4RcIERrU62wg

Then my wife's large and uncut salad came, meh.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=PilAaN3bksUGAQwrhd-n_g

Next up was the foie; perfectly cooked and it melted beautifully in my mouth. I think it came on French toast or something like that, but whatever it was, I loved it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=R7Z22Ri5ritivCsi7as0Fg

Now for the burger. It came simply presented with a tall cup of fries and a little salad thing to the side and three small dishes with some condiments. The bun, thank god, was not brioche and tasted pretty fresh.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=cV3UoVQRumiu_MC78Y_THg

After one bite a ""rare"" problem occurred; my burger was UNDER cooked. Luckily it wasn't raw, but it was very rare and cool in the center. At this level of cooking, it was no wonder my patty lacked a good crust. The burger was seasoned lightly, but wasn't cooked enough to really let the meat shine. My friend's medium-well patty was served closer to medium-rare and he wasn't as okay with it as I was. The fries however were outstanding. Fresh and salty, just how I like them. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=75O4GRTCxO_rVGXGDVHwPw

Here is where we ran into trouble; the mussels. Two of the four in our group ordered the mussels and both ate a couple and stopped. The mussels were raw. No question or debate about it, they looked and tasted as if they were merely blanched in hot water and that was it. Our awesome server saw their disgust from across the room and made a point to make it right, despite us telling him not to worry about it. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg?select=bvc7a3BTD80Vm7cFCm-RZw

He returned a few minutes later, and told us that the chef said if he made the mussels again, he would make them exactly the same! I didn't know what to think of that! The chef to be so bold and refuse to cook mussels so they weren't raw and make a customer happy was unreal! I have never had that happen to me in all my eating days. The chef may had well come out and spit on us. 

So one ordered another dish and my wife decided to not take any chances. 

And to wrap it up, two more horrors occurred. First while my wife was eating my side salad, she chomped down on a shell! In my salad! Way to take one for the team but WTF!? Then, only moments later, my friend who sent back her mussels in exchange for scallops, bit down on a large piece of shell as well!

By the end of the meal I was mortified that I picked that place for dinner and couldn't believe how rude the chef was. Kudos to our server for being gracious throughout, but with that many issues in the kitchen, and only a par+ burger, it was the worst Michelin restaurant I've been to.",4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A,13,8,1,jfZ7VbZBrYrAxrgpdJCy-g

I strolled into the Bradley Ogden lounge on a Monday evening, hungrily surveying the intimate space for quiet whispers and plush cushions to soothe my ringing ears and aching feet. Sliding into a chenille armchair the color of oatmeal, I felt my shoulders relinquish their vigilant posture, and sighed. 

Perusing the short, interesting menu, I opted for the famous Kobe and ribeye burger with frites and a peanut butter cup martini. The martini sidled up to my table a few moments later, flaunting a garnished rim of peanut butter and chocolate crumbs. This heady beauty swirled chocolate vodka, peanut rum, chocolate liqueur, cream, and simple syrup infused with peanut butter seductively in her glass, rendering a nicely layered drink with a rich, slightly earthy profile. She stayed with me through the meal, and promised to see me again. 

In due course, a gleaming burger, a tall cone of frites, a simple, luscious green salad, and sides of Dijon mustard and housemade mayonnaise requested a spot at my table. Never one to miss a new experience, I welcomed their company, particularly as the burger was lightly scented with red wine butter and smoke. Moist, rich, and beautifully pink, the burger dazzled my palate, its light touch of blue cheese perfectly complementing the light seasonings, its soft egg brioche roll a subtle cushion absorbing its juices. The frites were nicely browned and earthy, while the fluffy salad greens were dressed with a miso vinaigrette whose silky finish prepared my palate for the richness to come. An excellent meal.

The service was relaxed, gorgeous, and engaging, the drinks were innovative, if occasionally touched with flakes of ice, and the lounge perfect for a quiet, casual dinner for couples or single travelers. Recommended.",Xj4NPAq2efs4mzS4kFHGyQ,3,2,4,6ZKJubg48EH3c_pYgz7-dw

5586791,2011-09-06,1,ujKxpaUmTUVpGRBFSvZfbg,"Girls' Night + Las Vegas Restaurant Week + Bradley Ogden = five princesses eating like queens and being treated like empresses.

We started in the bar (bien sur!) where I was given an amazing recommendation of a granache blanc when I didn't care for the chenin blanc/viogner blend. When it was time to move to our table, both the sommelier and our waiter were in attendance to make sure we had all we needed and that our drinks were moved, etc.

As we were choosing a bottle of wine, we were presented with a glass of champagne to toast our evening. A fantastic special extra! As we deliberated, I asked my companion if Orin Swift was on the list and immediately everyone said ""The Prisoner!"" That set it for us, and the sommelier quickly brought it back for tasting and pouring.

Before we ordered, we were given information on the specials and, as we deliberated over the regular menu and the LVWR menu, a smoked salmon and creme fraiche amuse was delivered. Served on a chilled spoon it was a cool, refreshing, perfect sampling of our culinary adventures would go this night. A perfect way to enjoy the champagne.  (And, yes, there was spoon-licking.)

We decided to stay on the LVRW menu with the addition of a foie gras appetizer from the regular menu.

The foie gras could easily be a meal for me. Maybe a salad and some wine to go along with it? This was something-to-write-home-about perfection. One portion was done as a pate, served cold with a strawberry gelee. The other portion was a generous piece, seared crisp on the outside but melt-in-your-mouth soft once you taste it. It was a good thing we ordered two!

The twice-baked Maytag souffle was amazing. I expected it to be a bit heavy (blue cheese often is) but it was light, without sacrificing the tangy bite you would expect. Just the tiniest bit of perfect crisp on the outside, it was creamy and decadent without weighing down the dish or the other flavors.

The halibut was flaky and done very well, with a nice crisp finish on the top. The flavors melded well and I loved the herbs and the watermelon broth... what a creative combination! The cucumber ""noodles"" were deceiving (in a good way) and added a fresh crispness that I wasn't expecting.

I also tasted of my friends' free-range chicken dish (highly recommended by another friend before I went to dinner). So tender and juicy, the crisped exterior is rubbed perfectly with herbs and the whole thing comes together very well. Really fantastic.

The chocolate pudding was, by far, the best pudding I have ever had. It had a texture and a depth of flavor that kept all of us digging into the bottom of cup and wishing we could go further. We were also surprised with a butterscotch pudding shooter that was a fabulous blend of the buttery, earthy flavors with the sweetness of homemade whipped cream and small chocolate pieces.

Fairly high traffic outside, but I didn't notice the casino or nearby shoppes entrance once I was inside. The whole of the experience made me feel set away from the hub-bub and allowed me to enjoy the company of my friends without distraction or the ambient cacophony so prevalent in Las Vegas.

Amazing service, perfect recommendations, and a great ambiance to the place overall. Add perfect food? You have five very happy, Vegas foodie gals raving for more.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,1,5,kG--BxHouDXSpwi-43uC9A

- Kumamoto oyster & Osetra caviar - just a simple treat but is always my FAV each time I'm here.

- Artichoke soup, with that crispy golden fried, micro green, & the soup pour in afterward, so sweet, tasty & it was a vegan dish, wow!

- Heirloom tomatoes salad, pesto sauce, cheese & toasted bread - refreshing dish.

- Pan Seared Florida Frog Legs, saffron-stinging netlles timbale, herb butter sauce, parsley foam ;-) yummy!

- Oak Grilled Ribeye with Bloomsdale Spinach, red wine essence - juicy, pink, & tender!

The price fixe was a pretty good deal - around $50 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had the ceasar salad, which was whole lettuce leaves covered in dressing and topped with homemade crutons.  A great starter.  

The entree was the star of the show.  I went with the chicken.  I thought it would be just a plain chicken dish, but this was honestly the BEST chicken I have ever had.  It was crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The seasoning was a perfect combination of salt, pepper and other spices.  I am still amazed that chicken could be this good.  There were also mushrooms on the side that complemented the meal very well.

The scallops were HUGE and very good.  They did not taste fishy and pratically melted in your mouth.  

The dessert was a three scoop ice cream dish.  You can't go wrong with ice cream.  They also gave us a butterscotch mousse dessert that almost put me over the edge.

When I went to Bradley Ogden last week, I went with a large party. This allowed us to order all the appetizers!

I don't have caviar very often so I can't say i have much to compare it to, but it was pretty awesome. I was disappointed in the fois gras pate (it wasn't very memorable) and the blue cheese souffle. They weren't BAD, but they were just ok. 

Moving on to entrees, I had the bison. It was pretty good, considering i never had bison before.  Bison is rather gamey, I don't mind it that much but it could be an acquired taste.  I also tried to scallops, which were yummy. And for the piece de resistance, KOBE BEEF. I have never had such an amazing piece of meat in my like.

Twice baked cheese soufflé - good
Fois gras - so. good.  This was my first time eating fois gras and i'm really glad that i ate it here.  The figs/sauce that was paired with it was spot on.
Field greens salad - yummy dressing

Pork loin - pretty good
Gnocchi = not what i expected.  the dish ended up being more of a tortellini than gnocchi
Fish and chips - the fish was fresh.  the hand cut potato fries were a little too potato-y for me...but then again i like my fries extra crispy
Steak burger - delicious.",IeV1IcxMzPWji8ZYXDzmUw,0,0,4,8MVYTCamdYwTdsJGL97ceA

We had five courses before the main dish, I was amazed at everything I ate, there was nothing that I did not like, or should I say, loved! My waiter was incredible nice, and friendly but professional. Our experience went beyond our expectation. We will definitely go back to Bradley's. 

To start we had the hummus-very tasty and it has a nice zing

Osetra caviar with creme faiche 
It was incredible good, and I don't like caviar, this quickly changed my mind and my boyfriends too.  

Tomato with burrata and tomato gelee, ricotta salata
It was out of this world, we loved this simple, but complex dish so much.

Pan roasted halibut, saffron broth, mussels
This was a well balanced, dish. The saffron worked so lovely with the fish, the fish was buttery, moist, just plain delicious! 

Corn Soup
You have never had corn soup until you have Chef Todd's corn soup!  It was like drinking a sweet, savory corn on the cob, it was smooth, silky and it was very light, not weighed down by cream, it just had the right amount. A very delicate soup. 
His soups and the whole menu is seasonal, so I can't wait to go back for the next season soup. yummmmmy! 

Main Course

Petaluma free range chicken
it was perfect, I just could not fit anything in my stomach. these are the time where I wish a had a big stomach. 

Tomato zucchini lasagna
It's very good, but not what you would expect from a lasagna. It doesn't have sauce, bechemele, or tomato sauce, it's just a simple but delicious layers of tomatoes and zucchinis.  It was simple and good.

Dessert:
ice cream sampler:
Tahitian vanilla, strawberry, gianduja, and corn (yes yo heard it right, corn!)
The corn ice cream was so good, it was an interesting flavor, but it was really good, it made me smile. 
The ice cream was not overly sweet, it was the perfect amount to give you the feeling of eating something sweet without giving you that overly sweet, sticky feeling. I love this ice cream, and if they packaged it and sold it, I would buy it.

My entire experience was amazing, I ate good, I enjoyed every aspect of my meal, and there was NOTHING that I would complain about, everything was right down perfect.

Thank you Chef Todd we had a great experience at your restaurant, I will for sure be back for more.",1mI_WcnyKUfTX10XNey_AA,0,0,5,iUYo-_j1E-FATZ53z17k1A
