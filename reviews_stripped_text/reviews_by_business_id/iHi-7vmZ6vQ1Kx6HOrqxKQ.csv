Ordered some thai food and while it was tasty it was reeking in oil.  Had to drain the oil from the plate.  
Their egg breakfast starts at 2.99 and in retrospect we should have just ordered a simple breakfast.  This place is located adjacent to the Stratosphere Hotel so it is NOT IN THE BEST PART OF THE STRIP.

Located in Aztec casino and if I was staying at Stratosphere, I'd come across the street for this compared to some of the overpriced mediocre fare in Stratosphere.

This is purely based on the food I ordered. This place had the WORST fried rice I have had in my life and the most mediocre but overpriced egg rolls. I ordered the fried rice with all the meats in it. It was super soggy and flavorless. It was like they took soggy steamed rice, threw a little unseasoned stir fried meats, and stirred it around with a dash of soy sauce. Maybe I was hung over. Maybe I was hangry. Maybe I was just being a drama queen, but I almost cried how bad it was. I'm not that  picky when it comes to fried rice. I kid you not. There was half a shrimp and it was a tail end. The rest was cheap, bland meat. On top of that, they garnished with a slice of cucumber that looks like it was cut days before and had been sitting out. It was dryyyyy. The cucumber looked like it could use the moisture from the rice. The egg rolls were just bland cabbage-filled and super greasy. I was starving so I ate as much of the egg rolls I could stomach and kind of picked at the protein in the fried rice. The worst part of it all is my check came out to $17. I was blown away. If the food was even slightly palatable, I would not mind the price. I specifically came here because Yelp said this place was cheap and good. I don't mind paying more though if I'm satisfied after a meal. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The place seemed Thai-owned so I figure they could make a semi-decent Thai fried rice. I was sorely mistaken.

The servers were nice, but even I think they knew that they served me was disgusting. I feel like I should have voiced my opinion there. I'm sure this place has some really good dishes. I just don't think I care to find out.",Mszugkpt4STGlY-puv_8Wg,2,0,1,2QvwBUZJY-RLau8CzxrMZA
