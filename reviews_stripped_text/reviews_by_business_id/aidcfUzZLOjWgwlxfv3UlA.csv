Ordered Hawaiian Pizza, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, Side Salad, Breaded Mushrooms and a cheesecake. (Lol a little more than pizza craving) Deliver time is stated on website 45min-1hr. Which is very reasonable for a place thats open til 3am..  With the quality food that we received tonight. The fact that they are open til 3am is too awesome. Their caesar salad is a really generous size and they even gave us more than enough salad dressing on the side. Pizza was nice, not too saucy. Breaded Mushrooms had a nice little crunch to them, and were nice and juicy. Great job for a midnight craving.",R2UDgsb8MD8XtiWYLp8ljQ,0,0,4,nI-QZ8jdp2tKhg-2Prb1Fw
231513,2015-10-16,5,aidcfUzZLOjWgwlxfv3UlA,"Lol... this is the first time I tried a place based on a NEGATIVE review, and I'm glad that I did!  Someone said the pizza was greasy and the crust was thin and soggy, so I thought 'hmmm... that sounds like real legit pizza!'  Here's what I would say about that description:

Greasy - when you make pizza, you don't add oil or grease... so this isn't something you can control.  The grease comes from using REAL ingredients like whole milk mozzarella, and good pepperoni.

Thin/soggy crust - no problem here.  This is because the crust is stretched correctly and there is a healthy amount of toppings.

When I think of the awesome pizza I grew up eating in NY and the east coast, I think of a place where there is a guy wearing a t-shirt, covered in flour, probably perspiring, and a pencil behind his ear.  He takes your order by asking 'whatcha you want?'.  There are no fancy toppings, different styles of crust, or ___ -free anything.  I haven't visited the shop yet (just delivery) but this is what the pizza reminded me of. 

I ordered an 18 inch cheese and pepperoni... and it was perfect, I hope it is always this good!  It was delivered in under 30 minutes, and it was hot.  Easily the best pizza I've had in Vegas!  So good that it inspired me to sample something else from their menu... eating it now, and another review forthcoming!",SuDSi-dyc2sc6wAwGwSVrw,5,1,5,ghpmJ_lW6r0TP_BRvA6VaA

At 1235 I received a call from the driver advising me that he was outside of my home and that he was trying to get someone to answer for several minutes.   
I advised the driver that no one was home and that was the reason I had requested a 1am delivery time. 

On my way home I called the driver back and was sent to voicemail. I then called the store and was advised the driver had another delivery and would be back by the 1am delivery time. It is now 140am. No delivery. I called the store and they stated they too could not get in touch with the driver. I asked how old my food would be and was told ""it's in a heater bag so it should be fine"". I was also told they would attempt to get in touch with the driver again and someone would call me back. It's been over an hour since the first attempt at delivery so I'm guessing the food is at least an hour and a half old.

About 20 minutes later, I got a call from the driver saying he wasn't allowed to go upstairs, that he was in the lobby waiting for me.

I call him back, and he says that he is at concierge, that happens to be where I am standing and he's not there. Then I tell him are you sure you are at the Luxor, the East Tower. And he tells me the Luxor has no east tower according to their concierge desk. Well concierge has long been closed, so I asked the check-in desk, and I asked the bell desk. No one has seen a pizza delivery person, and they all know there is an east tower at the Luxor.

They offered Coney Island style hot dogs which I've always loved especially from Sonic and I figured why not? I decided to complement the meal with some mozzarella sticks as well. Biggest mistake ever. The place took well over an hour and 20 minutes to finally arrive. When I called the restaurant after an hour of waiting to inquire about the status of my order, they told me ""Yes they should be there any second"". To me, 'any second' means less than five minutes which this was not. The order finally arrived twenty minutes after I made the call to the restaurant and taking a few bites of the hot dog I must say it is extremely bland.

I don't know, maybe the way I feel about having not received my meal as efficiently as promised contributed to this but the cheese is runny, the onions are extremely potent in their odor, the hot dogs taste rubbery, and the chili tastes like it came out of the can very thick and goopy, really no taste at all.

The mozzarella sticks leave much to be desired; not hot at all and the cheese inside of them, very rubbery and elasticy.

The french fries that they gave me, I didn't realize would come with the meal it almost seems like they were desperately trying to get me to be happy and say ""Here's something that everyone in America loves! French fries! No matter what, everyone loves french fries!

Nope, will not be ordering from this place again. I do not recommend, and again when it came to delivery, they showed up after an hour and 20 minutes. The gentleman at the door said nothing when I opened it. He just held out his arms towards me with the food in one hand and my soda cup in the other. No 'Hello' no 'Here's your order', just simply holding it up for me to take and when I took it, a quick 'So long' and he was gone. Real nice customer service...

Their lunch specials are great (at least the chicken fingers are on-point) but their fries are just so-so and their caesar salad was bad. Bad bad. Water thin dressing, oddly cooked slices of chicken breast with no seasoning, tiny little croutons. Gross.

Order their chicken fingers and enjoy. Stay clear of the rest.",QCoBkB_m0v9smTM9voMZMg,0,0,3,VwcmWlcswzzlPHXXNAkeww

Wings were surprisingly good and priced reasonably.  This is a great place to order from!",Fzk6lQcLZrCQWHDF1uLyJA,1,1,5,7gydMy5UqlyJDHDy4pp7wA

5323448,2016-11-18,0,aidcfUzZLOjWgwlxfv3UlA,Horrible delivery. I ordered a buffalo pizza with jalape√±os and a large fry. The wait time was 45-60 mins it took them an hour and 17 mins (i always time with delivering). Plus on top of it all they didnt have the jalape√±os which cost me 1.50$ extra and the pizza and fries were cold. If i could rate a quarter of a star i would for there delivery. Horrible.

5433746,2017-09-27,2,aidcfUzZLOjWgwlxfv3UlA,"Very very poor food. 

Ordered postmates with this one. I was less than impressed.

Tonight I ordered chicken fingers hot with bleu cheese on the side, as well as an Italian sub with extra vinegar on the side.

Fingers were decent. Pretty straight forward with these.

Italian sub was mediocre at the very best. Soggy bread, quality of the ingredients were lacking and overall flavor of the sub was poorly executed.

I will not be ordering from them nor would I give the shot of going there to dine..

The Philly cheesesteak and chicken parmigiana was flavorful and well worth the price and they gave fresh garlic bread that was actually crispy when it arrived!
I'll openly admit it's not the best I've ever had but to be straightforward it's a quick shop not a 5 star restaurant and you definitely get your money's worth!
Definitely check them out if your looking for a late bite they're open til 2am!",LZ-4UALapPWHPHK3_tvm-g,0,0,3,VwiTlCwPWAF5C87uPP4DXQ

And he demanded a tip when he walked away saying thanks for the tip Rudely.  Second they got the pizza wrong they added pineapple on the pepperoni pizza. Third they did not give us the mac and cheese balls we ordered. They did not give us forks or napkins how would we eat our salad or fettuccine . We are never ordering from this place again.,514fcRn6MNIinm5QUHRYyA,1,0,1,ZhkqlMomlZbovbn697PaqA

When I called, their reasoning was that they had 15 orders, they were busy and that I could take my business elsewhere. I most definitely will!

Not to mention, the pizza that came was cold on delivery. Never again!",U7licBIRdyT0DDSqEWWQIg,0,0,1,cE36gbrvDQf4rKMR8wpBzA

We've only had super slow delivery on one occasion, usually the food is arriving within an hour and most of the food is really good, large portions. Recently though, the quality has dipped and I'm no longer so eager to order from them. The chicken in the chicken parmesan is awful, I think they must be microwaving it to melt the cheese or something because it shows up with a rubbery texture. Mostly recently, they forgot the chili on the bacon dog - super disappointing. Time before that they didn't even bother to wrap the bacon on the bacon hotdog. Their pesto pasta is terrible - dont even bother. If we do decide to order from them again, they are one more bad dish away from being off my list for good.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,1,0,3,mojqgXcGnymU8DzqLvDjBg

I hear nothing for 30 minuets and then she calls me back  and tells me the drivers phone died and couldn't finish my delivery. She asked if I wanted them to re make my food and have it delivered like I have all the time in the world. Very frustrating!
