I should have known better when my Alfredo bowl was served cold even after they placed it in the oven.  Eat here at your own risk!!",UslkpYBKCMsjXbpByB-W7Q,1,0,1,ftfyzFNBFgf914Q5-thwYQ

Then when we showed him the calculation with a calculator he kept on giving us a hard time. Also he charged us $10 each for a little bowl of just plain noodles. Last thing there are not even prices to see how much you will be paying. (3 small bowls of plain noodles, 2 drinks and a slice of pizza he charged us $68.11) the actual charge was $47",TMiSBMtLjv94rHZoJQci3A,0,0,1,88MtPNDGIg70M8TlcorA1A

2270757,2011-08-10,1,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"The breadsticks here are amazing. I stumbled my way through the Venetian and found this spot in the middle of the food court. For $31 you can get four drinks, breadsticks and a large pepperoni pizza! The pepperonies are full of flavor and there is plenty of marinara sauce.... The people who work there are generous. I kept coming back because my friend had a little too much Vegas and needed several plastic bags. The workers were very helpful and even gave me two!! Definitely perfect for when you're looking for a quick meal. The pizza's are even good for feeding - we had to feed my friend as she held the plastic bag for her boyfriend. Good times. :)",iuYUe3DqGbtOzguQ8qcIXQ,0,0,4,nYZHf411hfwGZP-bG7h5AQ
2858086,2013-01-15,1,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"Terrible!!! My friend and I split a pizza meal here and it was horrible.

We had the veggie pizza which came cold and they just popped it in the oven however we needed to go back and have it reheated which was a pain.

The pizza meal came with a slice of pizza and a side which you could chose pasta or salad, we picked a caesar salad for  and the meal come to about 8.69 or something, you could also add on a drink and garlic bread for an additional 1.99 we went this that....

The garlic bread was hard to chew, the only thing we enjoyed was the salad and the portion was so tiny.

What a waste of $12. We ended up tossing out our food and going else where, such a shame as we thought we made a good choice as this place had a long line compared to all the others in the food court...

We made a bad choice...",1UnZiZiuDLYxDmE2uzvB4A,2,2,1,XdbKu9HtwfTCEd0-cMh1kQ
2911604,2012-10-28,4,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"This location is located in the food court inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino on the Strip.

The three of us were at the Venetian to visit Madame Tussand Wax Museum, but decided to grab a bite before going in. After getting ready to order some slices, it ended up being an extra 4 dollars just to get a large pizza, so what the hey?

The staff was very friendly and outgoing and patient with us while we decided what we wanted. We decided just to get a cheese pizza. They made the pie fresh in about 10 minutes! The crust was fairly thick(which I like!) and the sauce pretty good as far as food court pizza goes! We woofed the whole thing down in no time!

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars would have to be the price. I understand that, being in the Venetian, its going to be pricey, but 1 pizza and 3 drinks ran us just under $30. 

The guy working did give us a coupon for 5.00 off on our next visit, so maybe I'll be back one day. 

I really want to say 3.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous, so we'll bump it up to 4.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,6,6,4,ksltgw-XZlURmXDUbdu6lQ
3325859,2010-06-30,0,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"It's LA Italian Kitchen at the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.

This could be a Sbarro's if not for the name, with about the same selections and the priciness to it.  The staff running it on the day (June 24th, 2010) I went were very courteous, which is different from the Sbarro's I've been to though.     A combo (entre, side and a drink) will run you over $10 here.",asoUInYtHoO0ANRKlta9DA,0,0,3,1eOymCh9_zZX9xE88DmVlg
3632064,2013-12-23,0,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"The pizza was alright, a step or two under SBarro's (I like SBarro's tomato sauce). Pasta was normal. Price was a total ripoff. $10 for that pizza slice, not as large as SBarro/Costco, and my pasta side was probably two bites. Couldn't even feed a toddler with that bowl of spaghetti. For the same price I could've had a lot more food at Panda Express with a dollar to spare for a drink.",RiK4W-hS5lnP3PY_BkQJYw,0,0,2,ofMJ9E6MzhDzqNrvay__Yg

I had to take off some of the pepperoni because I didn't like the taste of it after a while. There's not many choices in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes food court - burgers, pizza, Chinese food and more greasy food court offerings.",zPNrEv30Piqoig3YG4en2g,1,0,2,qLjJxu744BQnrwRIpHLrIA
5837955,2012-07-09,3,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"After leaving the LV Chocolate Festival & Pastry Show, I just had to get something in my stomach other than sweet treats to neutralize the immense load of sugar in my system.  A couple of slices of pizza sounded like it would completely fill the bill.  But it was already after 11:00 p.m.  So, the quest for good late eats began.

The Venetian/Palazzo hotel directory showed that Enoteca Otto Pizzeria and Trattoria Reggiano were fairly close by.  Yet, when we arrived at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria on The Venetian's St. Mark's Square, restaurant staffers were already stacking chairs, and we were informed that the restaurant had closed just 15 minutes earlier.  So, off we trekked to the next possibility.

When we arrived at the trattoria, a few diners were seated at tables finishing their meals.  So, things looked promising.  But this was not to be our pizza salvation either.  When I asked for seating for two for pizza, the manager replied that they had just run out of pizza, and the restaurant was closing in 10 minutes anyway.  So, remembering previously seeing some pizza stand in The Venetian's nearby Food Court, we pressed on to our last hope for the night--and soon came face to face with L.A. Italian Kitchen.  The displayed pizza looked pretty good, and we were relieved to find out that the place would stay open until 1:00 a.m.

All I initially wanted were two slices, but after eyeballing the size of the pizza slices here, I figured that one slice of Pepperoni, Mushroom, & Sausage Pizza would suffice nicely to counteract the sugar overload.  And, Diane opted for a single slice of Cheese Pizza.  It had to be made from scratch, because the last slices of remaining Cheese Pizza had just been sold.       

The sausage was a little spicy and juicy; the pepperoni spicier still, as appropriate; and the mushroom slices large, thin, and soothing to offer a nice counterpoint to the meats.  The dough was doughier than usual but good.  And, in my opinion this saucy and cheesy pizza was really good for a food court pizza, and most definitely better than that found at Sbarro's, which I have found generally looks better than it tastes.  While Diane glomped down on half a slice of the fresh Cheese Pizza that had just come out of the oven, we listened to sounds of James Brown and Buddy Holly's ""Peggy Sue"" piped in overhead.  It was a pleasant end to a memorable evening at The Venetian and Palazzo.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,5,4,3cOqu8VzicMdw5YQwDzkEg
5945457,2008-05-28,0,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,this is one of those fast service for pastas like Sbarro's. My bf ordered a spaghetti with meatballs and I ordered the cheese with penne. Both of our pastas came with a side salad of your choice and a breadstick. The total came out to be about $20. It is kind of expensive but it came with other 2 side dishes. They were very filling for us. I didn't eat the breadstick   and i ate a bit of the salad and half the pasta. My bf's pasta was alright. This was just a place for a quick fix for pasta.,Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,2,0,3,H83EMvh_f1-x0C-UjZBKLQ
5962827,2017-08-25,4,df5IJWW0-C4AJDCS9AwtbQ,"Well, I can't say that I am surprised that they closed down.  The pizza is similar to Sbarros except more expensive.  Lots of better options at the Venetian in Vegas than this place was.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,9,7,2,N3bht0wD8fD8GBprUov5kg
