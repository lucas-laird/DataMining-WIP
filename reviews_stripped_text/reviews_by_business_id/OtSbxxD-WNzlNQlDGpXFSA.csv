119744,2016-12-23,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,Well. Mixed reviews for this store.  Love the selection and prices. The restaurant is a nice change from the local dining scene. My only complaint is the checkout process - they must enjoy tainting a wonderful shopping experience by only having a few checkouts open and staffing them with surly cashiers.  Hate the checkout process at this store.,7fg1fuiUxFeWXWhuVo_PpA,0,0,3,8uicMOQ2dMkei5phbIVgTw
173472,2016-05-28,3,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I understand Ikea is a new concept to a lot of people who have never been in one. Do those of us a favor who ARE familiar with Ikea & get out of the way. Stopping in the middle of the walkway with your strollers & trolleys when you know people are behind you, just so you can turn around & crane your neck at what you walked by 50 feet back is rude. Pull over & get outta the way before you get hurt!!

Rant over.....moving on. 

I spent 3 hours here yesterday & was reminded why I love Ikea. I love how they have rooms decorated indicating the square footage for you to see how you can decorate a small area so it's functional & comfortable. I also love the itemized ""room price tag"" 
So you can literally recreate a design in your home. Perfect for apartments and/or budget conscious shoppers. 

Yes, the designs & decor are european & not very American and that may turn some off. But some of those odd designs are quite cool. Who doesn't want a stand out piece in their kitchen or den?

I find Ikea to be quite reasonable & inexpensive. I will gladly put furniture together if that means saving hundreds of dollars!!  I purchased a headboard/footboard 5 years ago & it's held up better than expected....still sturdy & strong after 5 moves, being broken down & reassembled each time. If you own a phillips head screwdriver you're golden. Their pieces are NOT designed or made to be put together using power tools. You can try it, but if you ruin your stuff you have yourself to blame. Also, though it doesn't call for it in the directions, a rubber mallet is handy, especially when putting drawers or shelf dividers together. 

Ikea makes coordination & design simple for me. I love it. 

My only complaint about Ikea is this: get some counter space at your registers & put something up to keep those inline behind you from seeing your card info & receipt on the computer when you're checking out. I had a rude lady invading my personal space, looking into my wallet & transaction refusing to move so I could use the card machine even after I asked her to back up twice. Your cashier stood silent. 

If you're used to shopping at Ikea, the store is the same. It's 2 levels only. Car park & loading area is smaller than what I'm used to, as are the aisles. It's difficult to back into loading when there's not much room to do so from the main aisle.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,6,2,3,NHsi9XTBdFnSmWzlwU3yDg
212744,2016-05-23,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I have been waiting for IKEA to come to Vegas for a very long time!! I went to the one in California and I loved it and wished we had one in Vegas, well we finally do! My visit today was great! The line of cars to even get into the parking lot went around the corner from the street, once I parked I proceeded to make my way into the store and was greeted by the many friendly staff members who made our first visit here easier and enjoyable. My mother and I first got breakfast, they have a lot of options for drinks and healthy meals, also an assortment of pastries and desserts. Sort of buffet style and they have a tray cart for families. The dining area is very spacious and clean, looks modern and trendy. I love the view from this area; the whole wall is glass and you can look out to the mountains and the parking lot, it really is a beautiful view. 
After breakfast we continued on to check out the top floor of the store which is where you get inspiration and you see bedrooms and kitchens and such put together in many different styles, when you see something you like, you write down the item number to later get it from the bottom floor of the store which is where they have the furniture packed and ready to go, or you can grab from the many different items that are there ready to go. The store is set up like a museum, I would say, everything is put together nicely and you see everything as you make your way around the building. I saw a lot of really nice furniture and little trinkets and supplies for the house. 
Another reason I find this place so amazing is because the prices are really good! Prices ranging from a about $1 to a few hundred. 
I am so glad IKEA is finally here and I recommend everyone check this place out! You never know what you may find, whether be an interesting item or great inspiration for your home!",r4sY-L0PSxG5i379gzqCbQ,1,1,5,Xe73vPK0WfFiY3W3DBTpHw
244185,2016-05-25,1,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,I am originally from CA so have shopped at IKEA before. The Las Vegas location is so great to finally have. I bought a motion activated cordless light for my pantry for $11 that is awesome. My only complaint is that they don't have the escalator for the carts like they do in CA. You have to take the elevator if you want to go between floors with the cart which as you can imagine with all the opening craziness was a bit of a pain.,r8ZoYkWJ3IN6HgXBcQLaCA,0,0,4,Rz7gEFO80NFbSkcIjkw9xg

I found someone and just said in dining, obviously, but I was hoping for some more personal help,  like let me take you, so I can make it easier for you. Then I finally found what I was looking for. I asked another if she could help me get the chest. She just told me to look for the aisle and bin number. So I did , then I had to ask another employee to help me load it on the shopping cart. He said I couldn't load it on there, and told me to get a flat bed. I got the flat bed and I had to look for him again! As an employee he could of offered to grab the flat bed. Well, then I paid and asked for assistance loading it onto my truck. Cashier said to look for an employee outside. I walked out and couldn't find one. I finally saw a lady wearing an earpiece, so I thought I'd ask her. She rudely told me to leave my stuff and go get my vehicle. Wow. What a hassle! I needed assistance from 5 different employees in 30 minutes! I wasn't even asked for assistance, I had go look around and ask for it!

When the store opened,  the two registers in the dept were staffed. Then,  a couple of months ago,  the staff disappeared from manning the registers. Now you have to pay at the Cafe.  There's only one register there and on Saturday afternoons,  the line can be 30+ people and stretches out into the main traffic aisle. 

I have been leaving comments about this situation since it changed. I never got any response from management and nothing ever changed. 

Today, I went in and one of the registers has been removed.  There are now pallets of jams in its place. As usual,  the Cafe line was 30+ people long.

I ended up getting a green leaf plant, a white lace container, and a candle lantern all for $10. I found these items on Amazon prior to my visit and that would have costed me $35 with shipping. I'm glad I decided to check this place out. It was clean, the staff were super nice, and the store wasn't as crowded as other IKEAs I've been to.

There is no parking garage which is a bummer.  It's Wednesday I went at 10:30 it wasn't busy at all.  Had lunch the meatballs tasted completely normal.  I read some reviews complaining about them, but this is cafeteria food not a fancy gourmet restaurant.  They had a kids play place where you can leave small children that are potty trained and I think they have to be 37in.  When I came to the check out area they had a freezer with their meatballs and packets of gravy and lingonberry sauce right up front.  There was barely a line I didn't have to wait it was about noon.  After the registers there's a separate food purchase area and place to get hotdogs or a drink.  My only complaint is where they keep the regular shopping carts.

It was so big with lots and lots of selections of both simplistic and intricate pieces of furniture. I loved the way the showrooms were put together; it made it really easy to imagine how certain things might look in a house, or even inspire whole new room ideas. 

Anyways, I'd say if you have some time to kill and you like to window shop, take a look around! The pieces are interesting and well priced. If you already looked online and know exactly what you want, you're ahead of the game so go ahead to the self loading bay and get your stuff already! 

But I'd say if you're not sure what you're looking for, don't aimlessly wander IKEA. You'll be there too long and probably tire yourself out. All in all, stop in and take a look around!",Xf64inF86ar3z8PqNuKbJA,1,0,5,WkfEp1u6r5yj6WyQHLwCXw

And the staff in the 2nd floor food court can be a little bit more friendly and patient. I can't order, if every time i open my mouth she is talking at the same time. And then telling me that she didn't understand my order... ??!

647305,2016-07-13,1,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I'm glad they brought an IKEA to Vegas, I grew up with their furniture. Starting with the exterior, the parking lot is huge! The building and lot are very well laid out in a convenient location--directly off the 215 highway on Durango--so customers have no problem finding the store or a place to park.

Once you walk inside, the main bathrooms are directly in the front of the store (including many others thought the showroom), there is an abundance of carts, as well as an elevator right next to them, for convenience.

As you go upstairs to the showroom, the different areas are laid out as displays. They set up rooms as if it were in a home, showing the different styles of furniture. The showroom itself can get kind of crowded, even on a Wednesday morning, even with only 2 or 3 couples looking at the same displays.

There are arrows on the floor to follow, sort of like a trail, that takes you around the building to every furniture category and plenty of signage to direct customers to the desired areas.

My chief complaint would be the employees, or lack thereof. There seems to be only one employee for every large department and they're usually either helping a customer or need to be found. So, if you have a question, you may be waiting to get an answer.

The IKEA has a good sized food court and snack bar. Seeing as you could spend several hours in this store, they are definitely good additions.

750598,2016-07-24,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,Returns take forever.  I went on a Saturday to return a few items I had changed my mind on.  I was #30 and they were currently serving #22.  I waited 30 minutes for my # to be called.  They had 2 cashiers working and both moved extremely slow and didn't seem like they wanted to be there.  For a brand new store they really need to improve the returns section with the appropriate amount of staff and having staff that smile.  I didn't understand why they need your ID when you have a valid receipt.  I think that slows down the process.

I've visited on a weekday and weekend and thought busier on the weekend its really wasn't too hectic to stop in.  I know Ikea's are known for being a very big place but I was pleasantly surprised at how my mom and I easily got a table to eat breakfast in the food court despite it being a Saturday with a crap ton of people around. 

All in all Las Vegas Ikea is great. But what I wish the city should of done was allowed Ikea to build a shaded parking deck like other locations.

822521,2016-05-20,8,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I made the enormous mistake of visiting the new Las Vegas Ikea store today.

After battling traffic jams and being directed to a parking space a million miles away from the entrance by frightening and rude Ikea employees, I walked into a colossal nightmare.

The two story maze-like space was crammed with shoppers which made navigating the store confusing and browsing unpleasant.  I also found shopping extremely frustrating as price tags were difficult to locate or missing all together. 

I may not have minded the disagreeable experience if there had been any merchandise worth buying, but nearly everything I looked at, was unappealing or of low quality destined to wear out or fall apart quickly.

However, after two hours of looking at what Ikea had to offer, I saw an outdoor umbrella I liked for $99.  I walked to the isle in which it was located but discovered the box was too heavy for me to lift.  As I was unable to find someone to help me, I left the store empty handed.

On my way home, I stopped at Lowes and found a nearly identical outdoor umbrella for $11 less than the one at Ikea.  I was helped promptly by a Lowes employee who even loaded the umbrella in my car for me.

All in all Ikea was a great disappointment. I will not be returning.",YVAJ4Xddij0Y2Nl48fDdFg,6,2,1,TrnJOcYUiQZxSsf0bw1eFA

He was super friendly and willing to help however possible. He was very personable and we were able to joke with him. He made sure we were paying the right price and helped us create the entertainment system exactly how we wanted and ever put it together on the computer for us. He was such an amazing employee. I hope his management sees this. 

The reason for one less star was because out of all the 50+ pieces we needed IKEA was out of one piece and we were told that they wouldn't have it in stock until Monday. I asked if we could get it shipped and they said they didn't do that unless we ordered and paid the shipping for it. I'm kind of pissed off because we live on the complete opposite side of town in Aliante and so were going to have to drive 30 minutes again to come back and get this one piece ....

There are shortcuts to bypass areas if you know where to look.  The biggest gimmick of all is how much time you will spend at home putting their furniture products together. The directions are actually very good considering the lack of written words. The guy who came up with this business model was a GENIUS and decades ahead of the grocery and hardware stores that eventually figured out how to get free labor from their customers with the ""Self-Checkout"" method.

People say they love the food for sale at the end. Hmm, I wonder why? Is it because everything looks so good after they just walked 3 miles to get through the entire store? How could I not compare the store layout to a rat in a maze when you put cheese and meatballs at the end of it?

Overall, not a bad place for moderately priced stuff that will last as long as it's well cared for. The lines at the register will be long in the middle so do yourself a favor and go the the one near the end on both sides. They are much shorter.",fdGKC7Pm77iZnL1Impd74A,2,2,4,MKvf-1slRMD8JE8y8OPkRg

1208962,2016-05-23,3,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"A Scandinavian grown-up interior design version of Disneyland, the 42nd Ikea franchise has debuted! Featuring a plethora of modern style furniture and accessories, Ikea seriously sells absolutely everything -- from storage options, decor products, lighting fixtures, kitchen appliances and even pet care! To top it all off, no more crazy shipping/delivery fees for us Las Vegas residents. Let's celebrate... SWEDISH MEATBALLS FOR EVERYONE! :)

It is quite easy to get separated from the people you came with (again, just like Disneyland!) as you will find yourself drawn to certain things with all the overwhelming interior decorative beauty -- but the place is very organized with a good directional flow of pedestrian traffic, is labeled to remind you what department you are in and how far you are from where you're trying to go. To start, once you walk in, there is a play area for children with staff supervision for up to one hour. Not sure if there is a fee, but I think that is a wonderful accomodation. Although, I don't think an hour is anywhere near long enough to get anything done in this humongous place! 

Next to the play area's entrance, is an escalator that brings you to the second floor. Let the Ikea magic begin! Showrooms of amazing layouts and concepts of various rooms of your house, you will be contemplating your budget and fighting urges to buy everything! Seriously, anything you are looking to buy for your house, they have it... in multiple designs, colors, and sizes! We live in a world of smart phones, so take snapshots of the tags on the furniture items you like (most noteably the name, color, and the red portion) -- and at the end of your adventure, you'll reach the storage section that has all the items boxed up. It will let you know what aisle and row to find your item, and there are places you can scan and search for your item if you need help, as well as many workers there to assist you! Just passed this, there are about 25 check out aisles & wait times did not exceed 15 minutes despite the opening week rush! 

Also found on the second floor, you can find the Ikea restaurant which has extremely cheap food! Whether you're craving breakfast, lunch, or dinner -- they have great deals that will fuel you up for your adventure throughout this massive store without breaking the bank! Most noteable, is you can get 1$ breakfast (scrambled eggs, grilled potatoes & sausage links) or 1$ for their famous Swedish meatballs (4 pieces). Definitely a must try, and for those prices? YOU JUST HAVE TO! :)  The restaurant opens 30 minutes prior to the store and coffee is complimentary until 10:00am. The restaurant itself is very conveniently placed, as it can be the first thing you encounter before you come up the escalator from the entrance... and you run into it at about half way point, incase you need to stop for food & water inbetween all the ikea fun!

FEW TIPS?
- Make sure you sign up for the Ikea Family card to get 15% off certain items marked down in the store (free & fast to join!).
- Keep your receipt (you can return majoirty of purchases within 365 days if you decide you don't like it!)
- Matresses are exchange only.
- Restaurant opens 30 minutes earlier.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,8,4,5,p8HCfvPMCmUI_Qmcs1dBBw

Obviously, I know it's cheap stuff, but still I like it for a lamp or curtains, etc. But I purchased some trash cans that were marked on sale, rang up regular price, was told to go to customers service/returns desk, where I wasted 30 minutes because only 2 people work there on a Saturday and finally got told the sale sign was in the wrong spot.

I remember my parents taking me to my first IKEA in Pittsburgh when I was a little child. From the beginning, I loved the bright colors and big open spaces. As I've gotten older I've gotten to appreciate the sleek modern lines and affordable prices. Yes, you have to put the furniture together yourself, but for the most part it's very straight forward. It's worth it for the price! Overall this IKEA is just as much a bright, happy, organized place as any other IKEA I've been in. I'm so excited they opened one in Vegas!

I spoke to manager Riatana or something of the like and she was quick to give every excuse in the book.

Due to the sheer size of items, a lot of the larger items we could not bring back and their shipping rates back then were OUTRAGEOUS ! 

My friends and I waited a week after their actual Grand Opening to visit this store, on a Tuesday afternoon. We had planned to eat at the cafe but when we were told the wait was an hour or more by a friend who arrived earlier, we had made other plans. According to him, it has been fairly normal for the line to be an hour or longer wait around 5pm until essentially closing. 

Parking was not bad and got a spot fairly close to the front by the entrance/exit. Layout of the parking lot though, i am definitely not a fan of. Traffic was directed towards the store for the closer parking lot but only half was accessible until you drove to the storefront, turned a right, to access the other half of the front parking lot. Kind of weird design and bottleneck in my opinion. 

Overall, the layout and size seems to be fairly the same as the locations i have been to except the cafe is MUCH larger now (maybe thats where all the square footage went that made it one of the largest IKEAs ever - too bad we couldnt experience it this time around) Like all other ikeas, lots of room models and set ups for you to imagine your dream room, and well as all. A lot of ""older items"" have a NEW pricing. Not sure if its location dependant or its throughout all stores. I have noticed they upgraded on material, for example on the couches. Not only the usual fabric i had known IKEA to only have, but now they have a ""leather/plastic"" for a more ""luxurious"" feel (i dont know how luxurious you can get with IKEA though...). But definitely an upgrade. I had never been much of a fan on cloth anything furniture/seats, so seeing this upgrade, it had made me happy. 

Would like to check out this location again after i make some measurements at home to find some things i need ! Horray i can buy some bigger items now !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,4,fFsrFyOcKkvkquKfHZjKJQ

Grab an item and put it in your cart OR write down the item name, color, aisle and bin number and your will have to look for your boxed item at the end right before check out!

There are also a ton of little knick knacks, tools, storage, as well as accessories for whatever you can think of that you may need.

It also helped that we arrived later in the evening.  The selection of merchandise was okay.  I don't know if it's because I'm no longer in the college but their furniture just seems very ""cheap"" and flimsy.  Anything that needs to be secured to the walls just screams ""NOT SAFE!""

Why I never got them before at a different location is beyond me, but after what happened I wish I did.  The first time I passed the cafeteria and saw the long line I decided not to get the meatballs.  After walking around we heard an announcement that the store would be closing in 45 minutes.  A few minutes after we passed the cafeteria again and saw the line had disappeared.  I was excited!  I ran there to get the meatballs but I saw the front of the line was roped off.  I went in through the exit and questioned a worker if they were closed.  He apologized and said that they do close a half hour before the store closes.  I left again disappointed. Once I reached the elevator a fellow customer came up behind me and said ""That's not right.  You  still have time. You have a little over 10 mintues before they close.  I rushed over to the cafeteria again and this time after seeing a few customers walk through another gentleman roped off that entrance and said that they were closed!  I could not believe it.  I did not say anything at the time because my husband who was with me works in a restaurant and I know how he feels about customers coming in before they close.  Once we got down to the first level and started walking around there, I don't know what possessed me to look at my watch but it was only 8:25 pm.  The cafeteria should not have even been closed yet.  That means they closed early!  

I had called customer service regarding my issue the next day but was on hold with them for over 15 minutes.  I asked the customer service person if I could get a reply back.  I still have not heard from them and it's been a month.

You can't miss the huge blue building seen from the 215 & Durango.  The parking lot probably has enough spaces for a football game so you'll be good.

This store doesn't supply the high end furniture that will last you forever.  It does, however, fit into a tight budget of a newlywed or college student.  They have great displays and corresponding tags on where to find the item in the warehouse.

Walking around this store can take some time especially if you follow their directional arrows on the floor.  I feel like a running back trying to make my way through the bunches of people.   Families of 4 making moving road blocks are abundant so beware!

I'm sure the crowds will die down so people can enjoy their shopping experience.  If nothing else you can get breakfast for $1.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,14,12,3,SmYvzSSl1wmjzm_58XyTnw

Other than a cheap table to put an old style tv on years ago, I haven't ever used any furniture.   I will say a five pound weight got dropped on the table And dented it. But some Tupperware, metal bowls and the handheld can opener are life changing and things I use daily and will cry if they stop making them.

IKEA overall is easy to navigate. If you get lost, just look at the ground and it'll point you in the right direction.

You start at the entrance and the floor plan is designed in a way that makes you walk through the entire store before you can exit. This is a good thing for when you want to see everything or have no idea what you're looking for and just window shopping, but it can also be a bad thing when you know exactly what you want and need to walk through the entire store to get to it and then want to just pay and exit. I don't mind it because I end up finding things along the way through the store. I love how they stage the different room set ups because you can easily see what all the furniture options could look like together as a set / room in your house, which in my opinion makes it easier for you to design what you actually want in your own home. Lastly, the cafeteria is awesome. Very cost effective pricing, the food is good and the layout / furniture set up of the space looks like a home living room. I feel like Ikea pretty much sets up the entire store floor plan in a way that allows you to envision owning all of it in your own home, and all the pricing is straight forward and easy to see.",wreclInQD4nxRsnTlaNTiw,1,1,5,SA4VHB9owaY1izsiMiycqQ

I was surprised to see they sold some groceries there, and even organic items. It's disappointing that they sell bad snack food that everyone lines up for- cinnamon buns, ice cream, hot dogs and pizza. I did like how they are eco friendly with the solar panels and the recycling though. 

The kitchen and bedroom displays on the 2nd floor are cool. I like the small sq ft urban living displays. You can remodel your whole kitchen like the displays for decent prices. 

You can easily go here and buy little things. I got pillows, a little lamp and a step stool. 

I don't like how you have to get everything on your own at the end. I feel like someone should grab it for you. But I guess that's how they save money by not hiring so many people. It was really frustrating to find people to ask questions. They should have more people on the floor. But when I did find someone, they knew exactly where stuff was and were nice, so that was good. 

We also didn't write down everything like the IKEA way. We took pics of all the tags. I feel like they should be more updated with an app that I can scan the tags and my shopping cart is all on the app.",w1uEa7272-ZXdiTm0aDM8A,3,1,4,YfC7iMeyhokG4LeHOM-eAw

I have to admit that she was pestered, cajoled, and it was only when I finally convinced here it was totally safe, that we went. 

Sure, this place isn't the cutting edge in design. And you have to look high and low to find anything that resembles true Scandanavian design. But even she was impressed with the simpleness and practicality. And though the products weren't expensive, they weren't cheap in that tacky chinese-plasticky WallyWorld kind of way.

Now, for the meatballs...horrible is the kindest thing I can say. We both tried them. We both despised them. The cafeteria was reasonably priced, but the selection left a lot to be desired.

Las Vegas is the perfect location for an Ikea. It seems like around every corner they are building new homes or apartments and it seems like everyone and their mom is moving to Vegas, so this is a winning combination. 

When I moved from LA, I filled up my SUV with a bed frame, a mattress, a sofa, a dresser, a tv stand, a computer chair, and a desk and drove it all the way to Vegas. Then every few months I would drive back just so I can make a run to Ikea. Now, I can just drive down the street and voila! I can get my Ikea on without driving past state line. 

This Ikea is no different than any other Ikea. The layout is virtually the same. You take a magical escalator to the labyrinth of show rooms. The food court is in there somewhere if you can find it. There is childcare on the bottom floor for your convenience. The self serve area to pick up all of your boxes is on the bottom floor. At the exit of the store, there is also a little market where you can buy all the frozen meatballs your tummy desires, as well as trays of fresh cinnamon rolls. Mmm!

I have heard some people complain that Ikea is cheap and unreliable furniture. Well, I think that is up for debate. Growing up, my family preferred fancy furniture from department stores because of the quality. Let's be honest, all of that department store furniture is clunky and outrageously expensive. My Ikea furniture that I have purchased has survived many years and still looks great! I like my furniture modern and simple, not intricate and overdone. You will not find Game of Thrones-esque furniture here.

On this trip alone, I bought a dresser, some cool light bulbs for decor lighting, and a couple of floating shelves, and a patio set for the balcony. It was all easy to install, even though I forgot to pick up the screws for the shelves, doh! Nothing a quick run to home depot can't fix. 

Oh, and as teacher this place is heaven! There are so many things that I know that I will be back for before the school year starts. There are $5 stools that are perfect for my reading table! Cute decorations that I can use for my library and reading nook. Love their storage ideas and $20 art easels. Ikea, just take all my money now!

For the price and the style, you cannot go wrong with having a few simple pieces from Ikea. Even when you lose a screw or can't find a part, their customer service is friendly and convenient.

I don't want to see the same thing over and over... Also, there was a product I found that had damaged packaging, when I asked for a discount on it they were pretty cold about it. They were sold out of a lot of items that were particularly popular and well priced, we were told they'd have more coming in the next day, which didn't happen. Certain things were reasonably priced, while others were out of this world expensive! They have a lot of greatly impressive merchandise, but nothing to go crazy over.

I am a huuuuge fan of the housewares section! Most of their products are super affordable and many of them can be used in different ways or can be customized! I love getting the cork trivets and using them for small bulletin boards. Their dishes and glassware are super cheap, as well as their flour sack dish towels. So many great bargains and they are easy to DIY if you are into that sort of thing!

I am giving it four stars because going to IKEA isn't like popping into a Target or Homegoods-- it's an event. You can't just walk in and pick up what you need and walk out, you have to go through the entire floor to find what you need and check out. As far as I know (through secondhand accounts), the stores in Europe aren't like this.

This place is huge! You can tell just by looking at the outside of the building and their enormous parking lot.

Call me cheap but their meals (chicken tenders, meatballs, salmon, dessert) are affordable and enough to satisfy! You also don't feel as guilty ordering multiple items because it's not expensive! 

I would say that their pricing is a mixture of ""dang that's expensive"" to ""okay, I can afford that"" ... depends on their deals. They do have quality products then again I'm a little biased because my entire house is furnished by IKEA. 

Needs improvement: The last time I was there was about an 30 mins before closing time and they only had three registers open.

2612776,2016-09-18,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"Long story short: DONT USE THE DELIVERY SERVICE!!!!The deliveries are done by an unprofessional/ incompetent third party company. They tried to charge me even thought they did not successfully deliver my item.

This one star is for the delivery ""service"" experience. I will continue to shop at IKEA but I will be renting a truck to pick my items up next time. I purchased a mattress, ordered the delivery for the next morning. I received a text asking to reply ""YES"" to accept the delivery, I did. I received a call from the delivery man from his cell phone saying he was at my gate. I told him to call the number on my directory so I could buzz him in. He was buzzed into the gate. Then the waiting game began. I did not get a knock at my door. I waited for some time before attempting to reach the delivery man on his cell phone. I called multiple times. The amount of time that passed did not make sense as I am the FIRST UNIT in the complex as you drive in the gate. The man never picked up his phone. I finally walked outside after a while to see if he maybe went to a different unit. No truck (bc he had obviously already left). When I went back into my apartment I saw a missed call from the 888 #. I returned the call. They said I missed my delivery. They told me he waited at my door for fifteen minutes. Mind you I called the driver several times and no response ever. I honestly feel he forgot to knock. Here's where it gets frustrating: I called the service number and they insisted the driver was AT MY DOOR for 15 minutes which he WAS NOT. They sent me an email with a photo of him at my door. This is the most frustrating part bc they consider this photo evidence that he was waiting there. The customer ""service"" was extremely rude and they kept insisting I was lying. Ultimately I ended up going to IKEA bc they made NO ATTEMPT TO REDELIVER. When I got to IKEA, I saw the mattress I ordered; the package had small tears and was covered in dirt. I asked to return it. The customer service agent, ""Jenn"" was a bit snarky and also assumed I was lying about my experience, citing the photo (which I was well aware of). She also kept insisting I exchange it, not return (obviously there is some incentive for her). Her name tag was deliberately covered (I heard another employee refer to her as Jenn). She had a little bit of an attitude (mind you she was actually TRAINING another employee LOL!!). I asked to speak to the manager to get a refund on the delivery bc she was trying to not refund me. The manager came, Jenn spoke with her as if I was not there, not even letting her know what my complaint/ side of the story was. Super awkward. The manager did not even address me until she spoke first with Jenn, then with the guy in the delivery department. The manager did ultimately give me a refund but it was a huge fiasco. My return was in the form of an IKEA gift card. 
Welcome to the Shit List, IKEA. You could improve your delivery service by requiring your providers to actually video record the ""delivery."" They are currently unaccountable for their awful ""service"" which I actually PAID for. Unbelievable. I'm wondering if there is some incentive for the delivery provider to not actually deliver the items (i.e. an extra delivery fee) bc I WAS HOME THE ENTIRE TIME!!!!!!",q0xLBryU4UwFe2gLsNhAaw,1,0,1,0qljVd9Sjl9dB24qTeeEVA

Going into ikea is so much fun. They have something there for everyone. And walking past the displays, really is the best part.

Makes you think that your home can look the same or might even make you feel creative and change things around to make it your own. 

The decor is also awesome! They have so many options for affordable home decor that will make your home look like it came straight out of a magazine. They even have canvas artwork to give your place a nice artistic touch.

I was able to score a year of free Swedish meatballs for my family while a couple of my friends actually camped out for a day and a half for couch and mattress giveaways.

The space itself is humongous.  On the 2nd level, the spacious restaurant serves up great deals on breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   $1 gets you a small breakfast consisting of sausage links, scrambled eggs, and potatoes.  $1 also gets you four of their famous Swedish meatballs.  The meatballs are small but they are delicious.  Coffee is complimentary until 10 AM.

Wandering along the 2nd floor, you'll pass by an entire showroom floor full of innovating ideas on how to spruce up or modernize your home.  From kitchen concepts to living room and bedroom needs, everything you need for the house of your dreams can probably be found here.

The first floor hosts a children's play area where you can leave your young child to play in the ball pits under staff supervision for up to an hour of shopping around.  On this floor there's another long and winding path filled with lighting, kitchen accessories, bathroom decor, and so much more.  Ikea is huge and getting lost is highly probable but you won't mind.

The entire store was quite organized with regards to controlling pedestrian movement and vehicle traffic.  Lines formed around the restaurant but moved at a good pace.  While not yet to the point of triggering someone's claustrophobia,  I would suggest waiting a week or so for the crowds to die down a bit.  Avoiding after 5pm when people get off work is highly suggested as well.

If you've never stepped into an Ikea before than you're in for a nice treat.  Wander the floor and score some tasty Swedish meatballs.  The experience is quite fun and finding that inspiration for your home will be as satisfying as ever.

I must admit the excitement I've had since the day this store was announced, which has built up over the past year as I've watched the land go from dirt to destination.

Some people warned me to stay away from the store on opening day due to the anticipated madness; however, nothing is going to keep me away!  Yes, it was busy, but the store's employees made this a painless process.  I was able to comfortably stroll through the maze that is IKEA and look at everything I wanted.  I sat in chairs, beds, and couches, and I walked in the wrong direction several times without issue.  The store was spacious, yet despite the crowds there was still room to move. 

The only area that things bottlenecked was right as the kids area began.  The aisle here is very small, and due to the nature of the area, the kids area, things move slowly.  The day I went, there was also a line for people to print their IKEA Family cards at a kiosk in this area.  I later learned these kiosks are in other areas (especially near check-out), so there was no reason to wait.

Even though it was opening day and the place was packed, I only had to wait in line ten minutes to check-out.  I can't wait to see how things look a month from now once they've been able to work out the few kinks there may have been.

Everything is ala cartel and that is both beneficial and frustrating.   The staff, anytime I've had a question appears to be irritated by my question about a product.  So I try not to ever ask anyone anything.  The last gripe is you kinda have to wind around the whole place to get to where you wanna go.

Place is always clean and when I visit I tend to go early and mid week. They have a lot of inexpensive housewares and makes it reasonable to add a little color or design to any room. I don't visit on the weekend as it tends to be a zoo and tons of kids. I love the fact that I can take my time and get an idea from their displays and then go and see if I really like it in person.  They have several different choices for window coverings. When we first moved into our new home with no window coverings, I picked up a few of the accordion shared which were very inexpensive (they were quite more costly at LOWES or Home Depot) and they can be cut down to fit smaller windows or connected for larger ones. They servers the temporary purpose until we got window coverings. Tons of parking.

Every single item you have been drooling over in your catalog is now here in your face in Las Vegas!  A full deserving review would be fairly made after the grand spectacle, but, let me share my first impressions today.

Employees were seemingly prepared for today.  The event staff handled the immense crowds and directed parking like it was adult Dizneeland.  Getting in was no sweat and the sections kind of intertwine like a consumerist maze.  On 1st floor the various objects seem to progress from kitchen to bathroom to bedroom to house deco and then onto the furniture.

The second floor consisted of kitchen and various room displays.  After cruising these models you find the cafeteria.  Which by by the way resembled the old school lunch or institutional cafeterias.  The line was too crazy.  Next time.

We had to dump our dear lil bratty-face at Småland.  They give you 45 mins of free daycare in a vunderbar 'err sorry swedish play forest.  You get a buzzer as the wee keeblers rummage a hügantic ball pit and climb play buildings.  Not the best supervision today yet understandable with grand opening circumstances.

They are smart to offer an in-house restaurant upstairs and a separate, less formal dining area downstairs. Shoppers need never leave the premises due to hunger. And you WILL become hungry, walking the miles and miles of warehouse area. At the end of the day, I was quite tuckered out with all the walking. When we finally decided to check out, we had to pick up our item at this other warehouse area where they stock items and OHMYGOD how huge was THAT warehouse! I felt like using a golf cart to get to my item destination. Be sure to wear good walking shoes when you shop at IKEA.

My husband and I easily spent at least 3 hours here trying to make up our minds to go solid or decorative in curtains. Finally, we went for a modern look since we customize our home in a modern type of way. 

Only reason why I deducted a star is because the sheer curtain we liked wasn't available in white color. It came more in an ivory or creamy color. Ask this nice lady who did ask if we needed help says that they have different manufacturers who sends different color....hmmmm...oh well, no biggy. There is always Wal-Mart! 

Tip: when grabbing curtains make sure you grab the right length. I believe they have 3 different lengths. There was a few that i grab that wasn't the right ones. So I'll be exchanging it soon.

I've been spoiled for some years now living in Southern California, but when I moved to Las Vegas, we had to purchase new furniture and while some of it has going smoothly, some of the furniture has taken 3 months to deliver after purchase. We had a few more end tables and miscellaneous items to purchase and I really just wanted a local furniture store where we could just drop end and leave with the product.

I couldn't believe we were in the store for 5 hours. We did stop by the IKEA cafe for lunch and that accounted for an hour of our shopping experience. Lunch is always very affordable and the food for the price is always great. 

We did get a few bar stools, a couple of end tables, few rugs, armoire, potted silk plants and art work. Enough items to finish the house furnishings.

The whole process of shopping of obtaining your products to checking out was easy and painless. I liked out we left and we had the furniture we needed. I don't think you can find any other furniture store in Vegas like that... without scheduling a delivery for a fee.

Overall, I'm glad IKEA is now in town. I'm not be shopping for furniture in the next couple months, but I may be stopping in from time to time to catch a bite to eat.",kf7FpAaxMNjQP8B1HhA1aw,1,1,5,YtiollqVtI4u0d-rPF62Qw

3176220,2016-07-03,6,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"This review is for both the cafeteria and the store.

Cafeteria - Nice and clean. The line moved quickly. Vegetarian-friendly. My cousin had the smoked marinated salmon and couldn't stop raving about how cheap and tasty it was ($4.99). I had the Veggie Balls plate ($4.49), two side orders of Veggie Medallions ($1.99 each); side of mashed potato ($1.99). The coffee was superb! I took advantage of my IKEA Family card and got a free coffee ($0.00).

Store - No covered parking, so don't leave anything that can melt in your car if you shop here. It was in excess of 100+ degrees when we visited. IKEA would have been smarter if they decided to build a solar panel parking-lot; where you park under the solar panel 'roof'. Some businesses in Hawaii have them and it's a win-win for the company - solar power *and* covered parking for their customers.

I've been to another IKEA in Renton, Washington, so I have something to compare this location with: it's a lot smaller than the Renton IKEA because it is two-stories, and not one gigantic warehouse so it felt a little cramped and it was hella busy on a Friday morning. I always attract crazy people in crowded shopping areas: someone put a used tissue in my cart and I'm sure it was that sweet little old lady. Normally, at my local Costco, people either 1) steal my cart with my things in them or 2) put crap in my cart thinking I'll return their unwanted items for them. Crazy idiots. 

Service and check out was quick and friendly. I wish I had purchased more of their 99 cents tarp bags - they are huge and sturdy. I purchased about 50 lbs of stuff and me and the cousin both held each side of the tarp tote and lugged it back from the parking lot to the hotel room.

IKEA seriously needs to come to Hawaii! I've already asked them and they said NO because doing business in Hawaii costs too much, which is probably true, although Bath and Body Works initially refused to come to Oahu and now they have two very-busy stores.",3Z0qWxM8ZCoDLzErwZyaWA,8,5,4,pK-qQnsM0EFh-Gbm0vNM-g

 I went with a group of coworkers to shop for office furniture and it was actually really fun. We went on a weekday so it wasn't as crowded as I often times hear is unbearable.

As you walk in, you can find a nice lounging area and a kids seating area where they can watch a fun movie.

Grabbing our shopping carts and bags, we made our way upstairs. Rule of thumb, follow the arrows, it will guide through the entire store.

I also learned that taking pics of the labels of item(s) I want (there are several stand alone stations with pencils, paper and  a measuring strip) it's helpful in the end process.

Each department has IKEA employees to help answer questions or look up items.

Take your time and stroll, there's much to see, when you've completed the first floor (the upstairs level) you'll end up in the cafe. 

Perfect timing too because our group was hungry from all the walking and shopping.

We ordered almost everything just so was can share and sample the food offerings.

My recommendation: the meatballs (with the jelly!), chicken fingers, and of course the cheesecake. Oh!! And that lingonberry water is amazing! So refreshing that I had several glasses of it. #Addicted.

After the food coma sets in, it's time to hit the lower floor to work off all that good food.

At the end of the bottom floor excursion, you'll end up in a warehouse. This is where your pics come in. The labels have the location of what aisle and row for any items, making it easy to find things.

Then, it's checkout time. Guess what is after checkout? There's a place to buy more food and drinks and even a mini market! 

Whew! This is definitely a place where you will have to expect to spend a couple of hours or more so clear your schedule.

Please if you have kids with you, there is a little play land with attendants to watch your little ones while you concentrate on shopping!

Have fun!

Turns out I found better quality products elsewhere.  Not bagging on IKEA or anything cuz I will still shop here.  

I'll come back for things I want like the plant hanger for the kitchen they had on display and maaaaaybe those cool wide span wicker chairs.  A little expensive, but totally cool - especially for my cats who I see already using the wicker chairs as scratch posts... OK NO! not the wicker chairs :-/

There are many purposes for my visits anyway like chocolate, and chocolate, taking a 'deco idea' walk in air condition, cheap lunchies or dindinz, hangout-cuz-we're-bored spot to meet up with bff Elaine, and chocolate.  Also have yet to try a purchase from the grocery section; and as Michelle G. suggested, their Swedish meatballs.

I have purchased small furniture from IKEA at another location.  This location and others have an AS-IS clearance section generally located on the registers floor.  It's worth a peek.  You may find that chair you just needed and don't necessarily need a set of chairs.  Check for damages though.  Some things are still functional.

On my recent visit I found a couple just right small desks.  These are metal  framed with a glass top.  One piece is a small wooden flat square block.  Manufacturing has failed to pre drill holes into them for the screws.  So guess what?!... out of my frustration, I'm taking a desk building break to write a review.  I'm having to mark pen dots, hammer a nail into the dots, manually attempt the stubborn screw bit to go into that dot.  

My finger tips hurt : (   feeling wimpyyyy.  And I don't wanna have to package everything back up, return them, or order a properly prepared piece for this product - cuz I'm almost done.  Sucks too cuz it wasn't like this piece was on top or in the beginning of the building instructions.  Grrrr

This reminds me, it's not the first time I've purchased partially manufactured products from an IKEA.  We won't go over that story.  What I do want right about now is their toffee chocolate bar.  Not the recalled one - the giant bar : -/

By the way, IKEA used to offer financing with a few banks, even credit cards.  They no longer offer this.  Existing account holders keep their prior financing until it's paid.

So we knew it would be open when returned this year for our vacation in Vegas. I decided to check it out today (02-01-17) and I was very excited to see that it turned out just as I had hoped it would. I spent about an hour walking around and it is a carbon copy of the one I visit in AZ with one noticeable difference. Walking around this store is sooooo easy.....the instructions are seamless.....the signs guide you every step of the way.....and my favorite aspect of the store.....the projection like arrows that are a few feet apart along the route that guides you throughout the entire store. Projection your ask? What do I mean? Well remember the slides we use to watch in school on the projector and the white screen? Well imagine that projector sending an arrow pointing you in the right direction aimed directly at a grey floor instead of a white screen.....it is pretty awesome to say the least.

This particular location has some great ideas for small spaces....it is really scary GOOD....LOL. I mean you walk in and you see these 375ft to around 475ft spaces looking simply awesome and very livable but you know when your actually living in the space it will be really small. IKEA does a great job of making this space look so HUGE you will definitely want to buy everything they suggest to make your space feel the same.....it really is a great marketing ploy. This IKEA includes the other usual suspects.....kids play area.....huge cafeteria where they sell their WORLD FAMOUS meatballs not to mention a great mountain view.....the grocery store area to pick up all things swedish and of course the famous ""AS IS"" isle where you can get some awesome deals on all types of products.

The customer service is top notch as usual.....and since I went on a Wednesday it was very easy to move around. I heard the weekends here can be crazy and  I am not shocked by that because most IKEA stores are that way. So while I know some things can be expensive at IKEA....they do have some great deals and the products are HIGH Quality. Remember people you get what you pay for.

The staff: all were awesome, friendly, energetic, and highly organized.

The store: I've been to IKEAs in the Bay Area, the Twin Cities, and suburban Denver. This one is really no different, in terms of its logical organization and showroom merchandizing. The hard working staff and  management did a magical job of keeping the place non stop tidy and organized on its grand opening. Even the tiny restrooms ( yes, there was a ten minute line at the ladies room) was in clean, working order.

On my wish list of pointless wishes are:

- Covered parking. This was a mild day, and the hike from the outer lot to the store was a good ten minutes (and we are two fit girls walking briskly.) Had it been, say, July...

- More restrooms! Backtracking to get to one, or zooming past stuff I haven't had a chance to explore in order to find one, sucks ( I know, I know, First World Problems, indeed.)

After dinner we walked through the store. I love the vignettes. They provide you with a lot of inspiration and they really focus on what you can do with small spaces.

We plan to go back to buy some indoor plants and they also have candles at a very good price. I will buy more of their candles if they burn slowly. If they burn too quickly, the value does not make up for how often I will have to buy them.",kmXn7iEJWGDGbWUiEmZ_kA,1,2,3,QEAQoGZu87R_c83AOF__OQ

One was actually to check out the furniture, but this was secondary to my missions to procure cheap throw pillow stuffers (success), lingonberry preserves to re-create a classic old Alpine Village dessert (success), and try out the cafe (changed our minds and decided to go to the Fat Greek instead. Also a success but not for Ikea- the food selections looked pretty dreary).

There is such hype around this place that I admit I had unrealistically high expectations, but it's basically a huge warehouse/home furnishings/inexplicable cafeteria location.Like a Costco with less groceries and more furniture that you have to put together yourself (Hello, Walmart). There are a number of display rooms like you'd see at Lowe's,but I don't get what the fuss is about. No one would want any of that stark, modern, uncomfortable (and bland) looking furniture except maybe some twenty -something hipsters on a budget.

 And while there were some nice accent and storage pieces,and the employees were very courteous ad helpful, I would recommend that bargain hunter's try Craigslist first. Unless you really want some meatballs.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,0,0,3,H71LbZ2sAJKrF4h3VuyXaw

3409490,2016-05-24,1,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"Don't believe the hype.  I had a lunch shopping date at IKEA on yesterday.  I'm assuming the large crowd was a result of the most recent opening.  We waited in line for 40 minutes to a cafeteria style eatery.  I couldn't understand why the deserts looked as though it had been in a refrigerator for days uncovered as I know they were moving items quickly due to the large volume of people they were serving.  The meatballs were small and dry in some instances (three different varieties), I can certainly tell you Costco and Sam's Club meatballs have them beat hands down.  The four thinly dried out pieces of chicken fingers were piled on the top of a bunch of fries, I'm assuming to make the plate full.  I promise you they took a half of a chicken breast and butterflied it twice.  The vegetable potatoe cake was different and good in taste.  I have to admit the eating area was clean with a refreshing modern appeal.

Now as for the shopping side, they have an excellent marketing team.  They have created this humongous maze that is very difficult to get out, please do not get sick or have to go to the bathroom there, if so good luck.  Those who have walking restrictions be warned.  I'm a compulsive professional shopper and is known for shopping until everyone around me drops (lol) but this place had me screaming get me out of hear after  two and a half hours.  I found the furniture to be dorm room quality, the kitchen remodeling items could be found at a local Lowe's or Home Depot with easier access and the little other household items at a Bed Bath & Beyond. 

Of course this is just my opinion, there is different strokes for different folks.  IKEA is just not my thing for food or shopping.",ygA15wEVgItwWYnZPUe34g,1,0,2,2ZgBOm3oMCN3-9rD2y6m2g

Fashionably late to the party, but nevertheless embraced by the legion of Las Vegas citizens ready to invade faux living spaces and throw down money like it's a strip club. Who knew a giant blue building could single-handedly answer all your furnishing prayers and Swedish minimalist dreams?

For those uninitiated, it's all good (but for real tho where you been?!) -- IKEA is a giant Swedish furniture retailer centered around contemporary design and affordability. It's like a cult. Ask any eco-friendly hipster or budget-minded first homeowner. This is their sanctuary. Fun fact: The name itself is an acronym of its founder and his hometown. Now go forth and impress your friends for two seconds.

Have fun and go on an adventure! Here's the cliff notes version of a typical visit just in case you need a little preparation:

1.) You simply cannot walk in and out of an IKEA. Genius sales technique! Yes I'm talking hardcore impulse buys.The showrooms have a traffic flow that customers typically follow. You might come in solely for a Hemnes desk, but come out with artificial grass and a broccoli stuffed animal. 

2.) Bring a writing utensil or grab one of their pencils to jot down items you like. You'll need them later for checkout/pickup.

3.) Be like Tom and Summer in the film 500 Days of Summer and pretend everything's yours. Plop on that couch, open the kitchen drawer, test that Star Wars lookin' lamp thing. That's the beauty of IKEA. 

4.) Two words -- Swedish meatballs. Mic drop.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,12,7,5,y43f3quW0pW1AocgsxMvBQ

I also found plenty of stuff to buy for myself -- kitchen utensils, trays, lights, etc.

As for the food, it's mediocre at best located in a cafeteria setting. Their rich, dense Chocolate Conspiracy cake ($2.99) was the best thing we tried. The Swedish meatballs ($4.99) weren't nearly as good as I remember from my childhood. The kids chicken tenders ($1.29) were a step above typical fast food fare. The Swedish apple cake ($2.49) was short on apples heavy on the sugary filling. It was a really cheap meal for me and my kid and the quality matched the price.

Yes, it's pretty busy right now since the grand opening was last week but it's not as busy as I thought it would be. The food here is also really good but my complaint is regarding their IKEA Family ""eat for free"" deal. We noticed their signs throughout the store stating that if you purchase food your cost will be applied to any home furnishing purchase over $100. We thought this was great! Especially considering we spent over $40 on food. Yes, we noticed some dates on the bottom of the flier at the dining tables but we read the fine print and nowhere did it say what those dates represented. We realized that those days fell on weekend days and thought they had to be blackout dates. We re-read the flier and again it didn't say anything. So we went with our first impression. Yep, we get the to the checkout counter and the cashier said she had no idea what we were talking about. First off, an employee should know what kind of promotions their company is running. Well, luckily I took a picture of the flier and showed her and she said quickly ""oh those are for those dates only"". Hmm funny how the flier didn't say ""only on the dates listed below"". I'm sorry maybe it's supposed to just be known but I really didn't get that from the flier itself. They need to work on their advertising.

Overall, if you've got a new home or apartment, this place is a good place to buy your first couch or bedroom set. The couches aren't very comfortable (I know this because my roommate had purchased one in the past) but you get what you pay for. I've mostly only bought home accessories when I've gone to IKEA like a wine rack, bath rugs, vases, etc. The deals for such items are pretty great.

3704038,2016-06-27,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"The pros
1. While the location is typical of the IKEA in my hometown, (we were visiting), the restaurant aspect was actually really pleasing. It's a school lunch line type setting, with an employee directing ""traffic"" when the line became too long. The food was pretty balanced and my palette was pleased. I had the vegetable medallion, a whole wheat veggie/hummus wrap and a marscapone dessert. The portions are substantial enough that I couldn't finish the other half of my wrap.(I had dessert first because...adulting). 
2. 40 band aids with fun prints for .79 cents. Magically, I had a deep cut later that night. If that wasn't a sign that I was meant on that impulse purchase, I don't know what is. 

Now the cons
1. The wait time for the return/exchange area is RIDICULOUS. I've watched employees let another customer cut in line, another employee leave the register and wander around going from coworker to coworker, all other employees have zero sense of urgency and a manager who failed to jump on a register or directly help the line reduce.  I hate confrontation but there was another woman who very vocally expressed her displeasure at the long wait. There was much attitude in her loud and unabashed comments and she reaffirmed my feeling that not all heroes wear capes.
2. There was horrible communication regarding how to obtain a kitchen sink faucet we were interested in. (Heads up, you can get the barcoded form from someone on the floor, you get it pulled for you after you pay for it. The area you pick it up from is by the dun..dun..dun...dreaded return counter) 
Before I left Vegas, I've made sure to tell anyone interested in this location to make sure they really love what they're purchasing, as the return process would require a meal, a book and a meditation for inner peace. 

I just finished an article on Minq.com that IKEA employees are actually trained to NOT offer people help. Not sure how accurate this article is, I'd love an insiders confirmation but everything else rings true such as, no floor walkway is longer than 50' without a turn, so not to have the customer become bored. 
I actually have to laugh at the policy of not offering help. Hell, that seems to be the general attitude of almost every establishment I frequent. Not too progressive there, IKEA. 

In closing, yes it's the only IKEA in all of Nevada currently and IKEA really has some pretty basic, goes-with-everything type of products. And yes, it's really affordable. But I'd save the trip to IKEA only if I have looked through a catalog prior and bookmarked everything I wanted and got it all in one fell swoop.",N51xw6dXX6n1iet9VJ3jyw,0,0,3,Lr62K70Bp0Ga6SZ7lvXPGg

The layout of the IKEA is much different than the one in our hometown of Seattle and is more like the layout of the IKEA in Boston, Massachusetts.
If for some reason you want to take your shopping cart upstairs you'll need to use the elevator. Pro tip for IKEA is don't go on the weekend unless you have to. As always I recommend going to the website and making your shopping list before you go. Some particulars of this IKEA:
-The line for the café- no... I guess it's the  restaurant... is interesting during overflow times. The main food line is on one side but the overflow line is on the other side of the drink machines. If you get in what you perceive is a short line you'll be politely asked to go to the end of the long line or the continuation of the line which is closer to the elevators. There is a worker which actually has you cross the dining room to get into the mainline one space has opened up. The woman helping us was a very nice during that process and even found us a rolling cart-  needed for the amount of food trays our family would require!

- Second even though IKEA's 800 customer service line is horrible  (I was charged for a chair cushion twice) the on-site customer service is excellent. The woman working truly partnered with me solving my issue and was able to give me the full credit return to my card for the cashier error. Check your receipt before you leave and save the headache. She advised me that if you want to not wait a long time for customer service it would be better to not come right when the store opens. She was friendly very helpful and definitely a gem.

I had no idea where I was locationwise and had never been to an IKEA before.  My roommate insisted that we take a look around, and I'm glad she got me to go... it was fabulous!  We wished that our suitcases were larger so we could bring more things home with us! 

At that time, my lunch buddy, Dear Daniel, messaged me, ""Meatballs""... and I didn't know what that meant. I thought IKEA just had furniture because I didn't know about their restaurant! Now I know that IKEA is known for their Swedish meatballs which are served in their cafe!  Haha!

So, when my mom, auntie, and I were in Las Vegas, my sister suggested that we go to IKEA and have some meatballs. I knew exactly what she referred to!

Mom and Auntie Lily were blown away and I was, too!  I showed them how to follow the arrows on the ground so we wouldn't get lost. The nice employee at the entrance greeted us and suggested that we use a shopping bag downstairs because the merchandise upstairs are too big to carry home!  He also pointed out the child care area, the restrooms and free lockers! Wow!

We were amazed during our self tour. We wished that we could organize our living spaces with these products! The displays were so helpful- especially the one demonstrating how to make the most of a small area. Whoa! And those meatballs... 12 per serving and included mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed veggies... yum!!!

Mom was really happy with the catalog that she brought home to study. She made her list and gave me instructions on what to get for her when I'm in Los Angeles again... hahaha!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,34,33,5,wK4IBMOqO8To_ew210ly0A

I can spend hours in this store. 

I came here for some selves for my bedroom and of course I left with a ton of other stuff. The price here is so reasonable. I love it. They sell everything for your home/work office. 

**ADVICE**
-Remember you have to build mostly everything you buy from here.
-Follow the arrows on the floor so you don't miss any sections of the store.
-Bring your own shopping bag or buy one for $1.
-Make sure you the sweetish meatballs (OMG YUMMY) and the chicken strips.
-The chocolate cake is amazing (too bad they don't see it in bulk) 
-Barrow a truck if your buying big furniture. They have a loading and unloading area to park. 
-They have a kids play area. So if you want to shop in peace, drop your kids there. 
-Don't forget to check out the clearance section (facing the registers to the far right)
-Grab an ice cream cone on your way out.

Wandering around, we often found ourselves back where we had already been. We went up & down & around so many times trying to find what we were looking for. The signage & the maps are very cryptic & totally useless. We both were literally dizzy & head achy after a while. We passed the same exit several times & when we were ready to leave we saw that the door had a sign saying ""No Merchandise Beyond This Point"", but no directions to the cashiers which we had yet to see. We found someone to ask & they gave us long, confusing directions. After trying to leave for about 20 minutes we found an area that we had not visited in the last 1.5 hours.

I met some friends here for breakfast at the store and then we did the walk.  There is a lot of stuff here.  Most of the store is filled with things I don't need but was fun to look at and explore nonetheless.

I found the first floor, with its kitchen gadgets and cookware to be the most interesting part of the store and the reason I'd go back.

You can get to other places in the store without following the long path.  Look for the short cut signs above the aisle.

I did find the spaces that had designated room sizes that had appliances and furniture that would fit into that size area to be quite interesting.  Great marketing concept.

IKEA is OK but if I wanted furniture or appliances, I'd go elsewhere.  It's easier.  Maybe not as much fun or as interesting, but it would be easier.

I tell you what, the fam & I should have NEVER approached IKEA on its opening weekend.  O.M.G. - what a monstrous disaster!  Like, no parking anywhere!  Crowds, everywhere!  It was super-duper-pooper packed with just about what seemed like nearly all residents of Las Vegas!  But of course, we all had to check it out in the flesh!  Is IKEA really here?  Really, really here?  Yes, IT IS!

I don't know what it is, but all IKEA's smell the same...must be a combination of warehouse air, Swedish meatballs (we'll get to that in another review) & strategically made wooden furnishings.  It just smells like...IKEA!  Brings me back to when I first moved into the condo and we drove all the way to IKEA in Covina, CA to get brand new furniture.  Back then it was the closest one to Las Vegas!  Not any longer.

Now I can just hop in the SUV, take a 15 minute drive down the 215...and bask in the Blue & Yellow wonder that is IKEA.  It's kinda a joyous site to behold.  

What doesn't fill me with excitement about this?  My love/hate relationship with IKEA's damn D.I.Y. furniture.  What a pain in the @$$ putting some of that stuff together is!  Have you ever put together a queen size MALM bedframe by yourself?  Be careful, the headboard is heavy!  Almost smashed my noggin' holding that up while connecting the sides!  How about one of IKEA's MICKE corner workstations?  Put one of those together by yourself?  That installation of the upper level of that desk is a beeyatch!  Took me nearly 4 hours to finish that thing.  Worse than a jigsaw puzzle!  But the final product?  Actually quite pleasing to look at, not to mention functional.  Love.  Hate.

Basically, IKEA is home furnishings for the masses.  And I have no problem with that.  Complain all you want, you fans of expensive, hand-crafted specialty furniture.  As much as I want a custom piece in my house, I don't feel like paying a custom price.  Looks like IKEA is gonna be here to stay.  Welcome to Las Vegas, baby!

On our first visit we picked out furniture only to discover that they were out of stock. The gentleman that helped us had no clue when the item would be back in stock. He said to check back in a week. We went to checkout and requested a manager. She advised us that there was a recall on the item and they were not stocking it in the store. She advised us that it was still available online. When we went home, we attempted to order the items. We were able to put them into our ""online"" cart. When we went to put in our shipping & payment information we were then notified that the item isn't available. Very frustrating!

On my second visit I needed to exchange a couple of items and purchase a picture/artwork I really liked. After trekking through the whole store, I got to checkout where only 4 lanes were open at 7:30pm. I checked with the cashier to see where to do my exchange. She told me I needed to leave my cart in a ""special area"" so my items wouldn't be put away. I had to go to the return area and claim a number like I'm waiting at the deli counter. There were only two cashiers working and I waited about 25 minutes. The lady that assisted me was so unpleasant. After my return, I walked back across the store to my shopping cart where I stood in line for just about another 20 minutes.

I cannot rave about the quality of there merchandise here at IKEA either. I still have children's dishes that I have used for my twins from ten years ago that we still use today.

Best advice? Make a day of it. You don't just waltz in and out of Ikea. It's hours of your life. We actually got breakfast there before the rush. From the outset, you can see that technology and maximizing effectiveness is what IKEA does. The coffee machines require a token you pay for, when you put in the token, you put in your drink order and it does it all automatically for you. Technology is fantastic. The breakfast is cheap and whatever. It's like 2 bucks for breakfast. 

The showrooms must show off what people in Sweden live like. It's clean, sharp, minimalist and lots of LED backlights apparently. It's great to see the showrooms set up and it's much much easier to just write down where to pick up the stuff than carrying it for miles. Plus, you will walk miles in here. 

Got a nice bed frame here for cheap (total less than $200) and we love it. Plus, it only took 3 1/2 hours to assemble it. Honestly though, I've assembled furniture from other stores (Wal-mart, Target, Big Lots) and this is by far the easiest one I have done. Yes it took time, but I didn't want to mess it up. The other furniture came pre-broken with too many screws. This was perfect, all pieces clean and the right amount of everything. 

We were here so long that we also got lunch. Hot dogs are insanely cheap and pretty good. If we stayed any longer, probably would have slept in the showroom and got dinner later.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,5,4,4,5uYDXtLs7Y2mignAFB-66g

4108005,2016-05-23,1,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I have never been to an IKEA ever before until now. There are places that do cheap furniture bad, but this place does cheap good. Other business need to get with it because a majority of the stuff (knickknacks) that is sold at IKEA has a much higher price tag at stores like Walmart, Kmart and even Ross.
I love that you can go through each room in the showroom, open drawers and sit on all the furniture.
The only downside to it is that I have ran across rude employees. One cashier told me that scanning my loyalty family card is pointless and absolutely refused to scan it. She just wanted to argue with me about the program. I think it's great that it tracks everything you buy, she said it's pointless. How was she offered a job? I really don't know but I would enjoy a job at that place, it's upbeat!",4d14iYYxxaVrlAWVh8sbFQ,1,1,4,L3YEeOliCJrA8sonKCUCaw

OK so it's my first time to Ikea and here I am thinking it's just a furniture and stuff place.  Well I did not expect the buffet of awesomeness!!!  If you've never been I will say to prepare yourself to spend hours here.  Not only are there gadgets and gizmos a plenty they also have whos-its and whats-its galore.  Did I mention the buffet! OK so we started of by grabbing lunch. It's pretty much a buffet line, you grab your tray and pile on the food.  Only downfall, they start with desserts!! Yes desserts!!
So we had an almond dessert dipped in chocolate a chocolate with coconut ball and a marzipan and  frosting filled delight!! I had the salmon with veggies and some pasta on the side. I will say this food is pretty amazing and not something you would expect.  The fish was perfect and not fishy at all.  The side salad was also very fresh and so delicious.  I'm so happy that the food served was very healthy
now this was my first time ever in an Ikea and I will say I absolutely love the fact that they have furniture set up so you can get a feel for the size and how it may look in your home.  I love how they show the kitchens and appliances and how you can basically order an entire kitchen or bedroom from them.
One thing that I really appreciated from this store was the different rooms that were small Sq. footage. I really love how they show you to utilize different items to maximize your space.  As this is one problem that I struggle with I am so grateful to have gotten some really good storage ideas. 
This place is very high on my return to list not only because I e joked the food and the store and the great ideas that I got but also because their prices are amazing!!! it's nice to know if I wanted to re-do an entire kitchen or bedroom it won't cost an arm and a leg to do it with Ikea.",H_4xzadTdn0MpaVD_7zFmA,1,1,5,_zRWOozQKQc-vk6SNNQYQw
4147578,2017-04-27,3,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"What sick, twisted SOB came up with this horror house of a store?  With its massive lay out, a floor plan that makes navigating Disneyland look like a stroll across the street, and irritatingly catchy pop music.  I went in for a nightstand and a dresser.  I spent 20 minutes wandering the showroom upstairs just trying to get to section 7 where the bedroom furniture is.  From there  made note of where the pieces were down stairs and spent the next 15 minutes trying to find down stairs.  Then it was another walk through the displays down stairs just trying to find ailes 24 and 26 where I was going find the boxes I needed.  Another 15 minutes later I had made my way into the self shopping warehouse and found most of what I was looking for.  The nightstand was easy.  One box.  One and done.  The dresser, however, I found only two of the three boxes.  I was getting angry that they would have box 1 and 2, both clearly labeled, but no box 3.  It took me a few minutes to see that 3 was hiding behind 2.  I didn't realize that 2 and 3 are both half the size of 1.  But I found them all and loaded up my cart and headed towards the exit. That was, at last, easy to find.  There were only two lanes open last night but neither had a line to speak of.  Just one person in front of me.  I guess Wednesday at 6:00 PM is a good time to go there.  The cashier was friendly and the only employee I had any interaction with.  She helped me to unload the cart so she could scan my merchandise and helped to load it back again.  That was nice.  She made it quick and easy.  The only quick and easy part of my visit.

I am not a patient person.  And I rather despise shopping.  I try to make shopping trips as quick and painless as possible.  I want to run in to a store, find what I need and get the hell out of Dodge.  Ikea prevents me from doing so.  If this is the European concept of life, they can have it.  I'll keep my instant gratification American way of life.  And they can have that modern styling too.  I am more of a rustic furniture kind of guy.

With all that negativity out of the way, I actually did get a couple of pieces of furniture for a good price.  Less than I would have paid for one piece of finished furniture elsewhere.  What I got is bare wood that I can stain myself to match the rest of my house.  With finishing and assembly, I now have a couple of weekend projects to work on.  That is the best part of it all. I'm not going to say I am a fan of Ikea now but if all goes well with putting this stuff together, I will at least be thankful for the value.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,2,3,S7nXdYg5WNxDTzUWv67RuA

4155749,2017-10-07,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I finally made it to Ikea! Now I understand the hype about this place, it's awesome.  I absolutely love the showroom on the second floor and lost track of time and was up there for a solid 2 hours looking at every single thing. This was my first shopping experience here so let me break it down and provide some helpful tips if you have never been there. 

First off Download the app! I was prepared for my shopping trip and knew exactly what I wanted. So I saved everything in my list and it tells you which Aisle and Bin the product is in so you don't have to write it down. It also tells you how large the box is so you know if it will fit in your vehicle or not. 

When you walk in there is measuring tape, pencil, paper, and a map. Seriously, grab it all and don't forget to get a cart. More than likely you will find odds and ends things you have to have and will have no wear to put it. 

The second floor is the showroom and when you see something you want to buy either use the app or write down where the item is in the self serve warehouse. You will never find it if you don't. There are some decorative items you can throw in your cart on the second floor but it is mainly displays. 

The first floor is a lot of fun because that is where you can really start shopping. They have anything you could possibly need for your home. I found a number of unique decorative items on the first floor that I'm very happy with. 

My main reason for the visit was for bedroom furniture but I honestly left with a bunch of other crap too haha! When you walk into the warehouse it looks a bit overwhelming but like I said use the app or write it down and it makes it very easy. There are signs all over will that direct you where to go. 

I bought 3 Hemnes nightstands that we're on sale , picture frames, kitchen stuff, 3 tire rolling cart, and some snacks and my total bill was just over $300. You honestly can't beat the price of furniture. 

Don't forget you must assemble absolutely everything you purchase. It's honestly not that hard to put stuff together just time consuming. 

Overall I love this store. I can't wait to go back to get the rest of my furniture.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,1,1,5,8LEWXZES42wAbXHASmcevA

4170413,2016-05-19,9,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"We Were Here for the Grand Opening, and I have to say...it wasn't too bad. 

Everything from Finding Parking to Maneuvering around the Store, to Checkout was Smooth Sailing. There was NHP Directing Traffic into the Ikea Parking Lot, then there was Event Staff Workers Directing Cars where to go to park. It was pretty easy finding a parking stall. Then there was the Long Line wait to get into the store. That wasn't too bad either....Seriously, i hate crowds as much as the next person, but this line went really fast, Event Staff offered you water for the wait. It reminded me of the lines at Disneyland, where you have to walk, then you have to walk a little maze to get to the entrance of the ride, lol! 

Once inside, head on up to the Escalators, and that's where the fun starts,lol! BTW: Towards the Right of the Escalators, there is a little play area where you can drop off your little ones while shopping! Not sure how long you can keep them in there, but ask the workers in there =)

I am sure we have all been to an IKEA Store, so you know how it goes... Top floor: I believe was Furniture, Matresses, an area where you can customize your Kitchen, some bedding, the Restaurant, Children's Furniture.
 Ground Floor: Kitchenware, Home Decor, More Bedding, Pillows, The Warehouse where you  pick up your Do it Yourself Furniture! ( don't quote me on the exact areas of these places, just go and see for yourself, haha)

The Checkout lanes had massive lines (as with any grand opening of any store) There was one side where they Accepted Cash, and the other side where they did Credit/Debit Transactions. Total wait time for this? about 20 minutes or so!

After being there for 2 hours, we were still happy & smiling,but starving =)

If you don't like crowds...I say stay away for at least a couple of months. But, you have to see this place at least once!

Originally getting hooked on IKEA in Minnesota, I was happy to see the new Vegas location open. I waiting until after the first week to check out the new location. This is a mid-sized store (around 350,000 sq/ft), so there is some room to get lost in. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. The couple of questions we did have they were more than able to answer. For those that have experienced IKEA before, be patient as the newer staff members practice all their newfound IKEA skills on you. These stores take on a cultish following and you can easily get caught up in the positive energy that abounds within the big blue walls. 

Don't plan on just rushing in and grabbing one item, they aren't geared for that. You are looking at an hour or more of sensory overload. Have fun!",P2ZK_uDduvKbKgmNuyZQ4w,1,0,4,p0tk5tfujXmlHNZRAAkeiQ
4186665,2016-07-07,3,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I am so glad that we finally have an IKEA here in Vegas! Woot woot! Nah, for real though. I am glad, but am looking forward to when the thrill of it has died down for everyone, and I can actually shop here and not get trampled at every turn. I was lucky enough...is lucky the right word?...to be at the grand opening of IKEA in Denver years ago, so I knew what to expect this time around. Make sure to bring a bag, or buy one there at checkout if you have a lot of little things to carry. They do not offer boxes or free shopping bags. 

Apparently we got there pretty early, because when we left an hour later there was chaos in the parking lot. Although not marked, the small lot to the north of the building apparently is employee parking. We parked way out there in the corner to try an avoid crazy people and door dings. As we approached our car, an employee followed us in their car to take our spot. He was polite about it, so it was no problem. We then saw an argument in the same lot between another employee and a customer. The employee pulled in sideways to an end spot, causing the customer to slam on their brakes as they tried to take the same spot. The employee then got out of his truck and proceeded to yell at the customer that he was taking this spot and that the customer needed to find another parking space. We left before it got ugly. 

There was a very long line into the parking lot at this point, and most every space seemed to be full. The line was out to the light, and at this point we were so thankful to have gotten in and out as early in the day as we did. 

We had never tried their meatballs, so we bought a bag of frozen meatballs that were conveniently placed at the checkout lanes. We didn't get any sauce for them, just decided to eat them plain. My husband didn't like them at all and wanted to throw them out. I heated mine at work in a microwave and added soy sauce. They were not too bad, but nothing to write home about. I am sure that they taste much better cooked in a skillet and with sauce though, so I recommend not microwaving them as a first taste.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,4,4,3,5EoRjmQbtj7Vg55uEmYKzg

I did received a phone call on 6th, March 2018 to regrading my delivery on 7th. But I didn't get my order delivery until Friday. So I make my first phone call 18888884532, the person who I talked have to transfer me to the kitchen specialist to find out what time my order will be ship, I been waiting for 45mins no body answer the phone ,I have to go to work so I hang up. I make second phone call on Monday, 12th,March 2018,same thing happened again. So I decided go to the store find out , when I reach the customer service desk told them the issue, unfortunately they said is the Central Customer Delivery order they have no way to see the order status, I need to call the 1(888)8884532 to talk to them. Then I make my third phone call a gentleman answer my call take my order number, then put me on hold he need talk to the loading company, around 5-10 minutes he back on phone to let my know they can delivery my order on coming Wednesday 14th ,March2018, but he have to transfer me to reschedule the delivery, I asked him why my order been delayed but nobody to contact me let me know, he said it didn't show the reason on his computer. I want to just take easy let go so I just let him transfer me to reschedule. Then another 15-20 minutes wait, I got a lady on phone, I give her my order number, name, address,phone number, email address, then she told me my order been cancelled and she not able to told my why, she just told my I have to go to the Las Vegas store to talk to them find out, I told her I already been to the store they not able to check my order, she just keep said I have to talk to store because look like is the store cancelled my order. So I request to talk to the her supervisor regarding my issue, then I wait for another 20-30 minutes get the femal supervisor on the phone. She did able to explain me why my order been cancelled, when I make my order on 2/28/18,is night time my payment won't approve until the system down so the system automatically cancelled the order,I do understand the that part . But when I asked her why I make several phone call to the customer services talk to more then 3 different person nobody told me my order cancelled, also my payment been approved on 1st, March, if my order cancelled why no refund for my payment, and nobody to contact my let me know about my order. She not able to answer all this questions at all, only try to tell my if I still want my order just reschedul new delivery. That's really not a good way do the customer service , she need send to re training how to do her job. If as she said my order been cancelled on 28th,February, why I do received the phone call from delivery company on 6th, March to regard my delivery. Who is lied? If unfortunately I'm dead in an car accident not able to follow up with my order, ikea just will keep my money and never inform me my order been cancelled? Is this another way to make extra money to make the company grow up? It's like steal my money.The company really need figure out your system bugs, training their employees how to do the customer service or at least make sure everyone on the same page, it feel like they not have any contact which each other everyone talk different storied. They won't able to service customer they only confused customer. I'm really not happy for this time my shopping experience at all . As IKEA this kind big company I respect much better customer services, not kick my back and forth to get what I suppose get! After that I send a email to their customer service on 13th,March try find out some answers. Until today is 16th I still didn't receive any reply email or phone call even on their automatic reply email said they will reply me in 24-48 hours. I'm so disjointed.

4260210,2016-11-22,0,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"There is no way anyone can miss this store (signature colors are bright yellow and blue), because it is tremendous, just off the 215 freeway (warm springs?), and has an equally large and extended parking lot (overflow). 

So, when it was my hubby's birthday (June), he thought the hype would be way down a notch, so we went here to check it out (that was our 1st visit). It was amazing, but, still very crowded. We went to through just about the entire store minus the food market. We are in transition, so we didn't make any big purchases. But we did see lots of nice possibilities for us, in the near future. In the past, we would trot on down to San Diego, just for a quick shopping trip to IKEA. Now we don't have to do that. Although, I do miss SD, hmm...on second thought.

Get the list, a pencil, and a measuring tape at the entrance (near the stairs). 

So, we've been here several times now, eaten at the cafe a couple times (get the chicken meatballs, they are so yummy! and the coconut oat ball cookies are to die for! the cafe is huge and at times, the line has been quite long, but when you get the food, it's under $15 for us three to eat, it's worth it!) and our son loves play time at Smaland (members have an extended time period). Otherwise, the boy would want to sit on every chair, I swear, I'm not even lying. (He has a thing for chairs, and it's a funny thing, because I did, too. I still have some vintage chairs that I plan on redoing when we get into a new home.)

The neat thing about the furniture is you can even customize some pieces to fit your needs, but I would recommend that you take some measurements before your visit (we live pretty far away from the store). One of the employees walked us through the planning (use the computer) of some possible pieces; there was a sale at the time, as well. 

Note: So, some of the furniture pieces are not as long-lasting (and maybe frustrating to put together with confusing directions), but I can tell you that we still do have some pieces that we purchased many years ago. It's not all cheap stuff. But this is my short disclaimer. (And we've gotten some crappy furniture from other places, too, BTW. Guess it just depends what your overall budget is...) 

We tried printing out our family card but there was an issue (no biggie). This machine is located near the checkout area. Also, in the area is the food market (closer to the front doors), but I made the purchase all together at the checkout. Yup, we got the chicken meatballs and a packet of gravy. Next time, I'm getting the berry sauce. Also, the clearance area is a hop, skip, and jump away from this part of the store (in between the checkout area and the warehouse part, where you get the boxes of furniture). Since we've been here a few times, we actually know some short cuts and we know where the bathrooms are, as well, as the stairs and elevator.

I'm sure we are coming here again, like I said we will be making a change sometime soon, and we will be needing more things, like always.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,4,mM9xVgHgkTwExtpQvFQ3jw

I was obsessed with Ikea when I lived in California and I'm still obsessed with it after moving to Vegas more than 11 years ago. You can literally find EVERYTHING you need for your home. 

When you first walk in, you can drop off your kiddos in the play area so you can shop in peace, or bring them along, whatever. You go up the escalator or take the elevator up. This is where you will find the cafe with good eats for cheap. I suggest you have a bite and fuel up for your shopping adventure. From there you just follow the arrows on the walk way around the store. The top level is your bigger ticket items and display models. Don't forget to write down what bay your item is in to pick up near the registers. Everything is grouped together and you can get lots of decorating ideas. Once done with the top floor, take the elevator down to the main floor again where you will find your smaller household items like kitchen gadgets, candles, picture frames etc. The bottom level is also where the bays are to get the boxes of furniture to assemble at home. 

Now that I'm finished explaining Ikea 101, I do seriously love this store. I have gotten everything from dressers, to comforters, to pillows, to candles and kitchenware. Everything is very reasonably priced as well. My favorite thing to buy here are definitely the candles. They all smell so good and the large candle is only $5.99. It's an addiction. For people who think it's just dorm room stuff, get over yourself. You can seriously furnish your whole house here.

I decided I would buy it if all fit in my car. I was prepared with my SUV all emptied out, measured all the boxes and it all fit! I also bought one of the mattresses that was rolled up.

4353615,2016-08-22,1,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"We went to Ikea to look into re-doing our kitchen, we selected the cabinets and doors that we wanted, the countertop and the appliances too. Val was great, helped us and she set up a date when Traemand would come to our house and measure everything and put it into the IKEA Kitchen Planner. The cost $199.00, no biggie.  Bob was the man, he measured everything and  put it into the planner exactly how it was going to look, it looked AMAZING. 

This is where the problem starts....the IKEA kitchen planner DOES NOT WORK WITH MACs!!!!! Why???

So we had to go back to the store if we wanted to view it or make changes. Also, Bob gave us an install date in October and told us that we will be without a kitchen for about 3 weeks. You have to sign the agreement within 5 business days or you lose the date (You have to pay half the labor as a down payment and have 3 business days to cancel the whole thing to get that money back). He also gave us the phone number of the demolition guy, who never call us back until we called him twice and told us he was too busy to come out but would try to get to us in a week, if we send him pictures of the kitchen he might be able to give us an estimate. (He called three days later and said he was still working on the estimate).

With estimate for the cabinets we went back to the store to look at our plan, we also wanted an estimate for the countertop. And while speaking with another sales person, who seemed rather clueless, it became apparent things were not going to get easier or be as inexpensive as the claim.   

IKEA only sells the cabinets, countertops, appliances, hardware. You order from them and then either pick it up or for a cost have it delivered. It is up to YOU to get the backsplash from somewhere else. It is also up to YOU to coordinate with the demolition guys, the countertop guys, and the rest of things that need to be installed. Each gives you an estimate of labor and material. If one of them is not available or your materials are not in, it holds everybody else up, 3 weeks without a kitchen can turn in 4, 5, 6 weeks.

The estimate that we got for materials and labor for just the cabinets, appliances (sink and microwave) and countertop made the kitchen cost go from $6,000 to over $12,000 and that did NOT include demolition, cost and labor for countertop or backsplash. 

While IKEA has very nice things for the remodel of a kitchen, the question you must ask yourself is are you willing to be project manager/contractor for this project, do you also have the finances for it. Or are you willing to do this yourself, then maybe this is the fit for you. We, on the other hand have full-time jobs, and need to have a one stop shop where we can select what we want, the date of when it will be done and a budget that won't break our bank.",Aqb1MsOTqbDu4TCeb9CPgg,5,1,2,hM3MN9hLpKaiSsFWmE-sfQ

In the past, I have always went right to the half of the building where the cash registers were. The snack bar there, is close to the door and registers, plus, the price is super low. I was told no one would help me get stuff. I had to walk through the whole warehouse to find anything I wanted to buy. At least, I could lean on a shopping cart. No incentive at all to stay and fill your cart.

The IKEA Showrooms are the most horrible layout that I have ever seen in my whole life. Anything worse could not possibly be imagined. Only one set of elevators at the front and there is no loop around. The stuff we wanted was in area 7. This is half way through the maze and it took over 30-minutes to walk there. THEN, we had to walk all the way back through the same maze. No handicapped awareness, NONE!!!!

Bathrooms are in the center of the huge warehouse along with the ONLY elevators. There was one other bathroom in the middle of the showroom.

On the second floor showroom, there is a really nice big cafeteria. You have to walk from the front entrance all the way to the complete other side of the huge cafeteria to get to the food. I didn't bother (and I was hungry!).

The only thing goofier than their building layout are the names of the products. No clue from the name to what the product is, none. You couldn't make up anything stranger than their product names.",jilXTvjEr30JqjVSNJzBIA,2,0,1,NAD55UPg4LDChVHWCnNriA

That being said...during peak times and weekends this place is a freakin zoo. They have ample parking and it's easy to get in and out of the lot. But step inside and it seems people freak out by having to go up the escalator and walk through the showroom first. The path through the various showrooms is a winding, twisting affair that can be packed with daydreaming shoppers that makes for slow going. And it can be a bit overwhelming at times. After making it through the showroom by following the uncarpeted path you'll end up going downstairs...grab a cart and here's where you can start buying some of that interesting stuff you saw upstairs. 

There are some pieces of furniture I'll buy from Ikea. And we've had good luck with some of their kitchen stuff from cheese graters to very reasonably priced aluminum pots and glassware. Also their towels have held up really well compared to ones purchased elsewhere. But you'll also find a lot of stuff in here that doesn't hold up well once you get it home. I won't be specific but I just encourage people to take a closer look at what ends up in your cart and think if you can get comparable items somewhere else and possibly for a lower price or get better quality. 

If you buy furniture the warehouse makes it easy to find what you want. There are kiosks you can use to find the item you want and it's warehouse rack location. Just be careful as some of the items can be heavy and a pain to load on a cart. If you need help it can take some time to find someone though. The warehouse is designed primarily for self-service so keep that in mind. 

Checkout even during peak times moves fast. Don't forget to grab one of their big bags beside the checkout....those bags are critical gear for trips to the beach, or to hold camping supplies and so much more. IKEA makes it easy to self load your heavy stuff with a cargo loading area in front of the store...if it's busy you usually don't have to wait long to get a space. 

Overall: 3 Stars. Why 3? The crowded showroom, and the lack of help with loading very heavy items in the warehouse are annoyances that can't be overlooked.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,2,2,3,wrlZi7SUOIvqCNsVQ9SNOQ

When you get to the top of the escalator to your left is the famous cafeteria. Yes, it is a cafeteria, but an awesome Swedish one! You can get a smoked salmon salad, turkey meatballs with a side of green beans and mash potatoes, chicken fingers, desserts, coffee, espresso, or capuccino.

Would have been much more convenient and easier to do it that way but oh well. The woman who assisted us at the store first of all seemed annoyed that we had questions as to which pieces were available. Her shift was ending so she passed us along to someone else who didn't seem to know what she was doing on the computer, didn't know how to print our receipt, etc. Most people would have been annoyed with her but I don't blame the staff, it's managements responsibility to train and place staff appropriately. 
The check out process and basically everything else in the store is very self-serve. If you like a piece of furniture, etc. you can go to the shelf, load it on the cart and push it to the delivery pick up area to save yourself the $40 ""picking fee"" that they charge to have their staff do it. However if you're older or don't have someone strong with you this could be difficult. 

ANYWAY..
When the sofa arrived we had it assembled which looked really complicated... even the guys seemed frustrated. The legs on the ottoman were the wrong parts so we had to have those replaced. 
Almost $200 for delivery and assembly which for most people is a lot. After we had it in we decided we wanted to make it larger by adding a single chair in the middle. When we went back to the store we were told this piece is discontinued so we just ordered the chaise with delivery and assembly. 
The delivery service arrived 4 hours late and wasn't allowed in our community so we had to wait another 3 days. 
When they were attaching the chaise they broke off a piece of the existing couch and also told us that it was bowing due to water damage which obviously happened before we purchased it.

SO now we have to have the whole thing replaced. I'm happy with the sofa itself but just seemed like a lot of work. 
Also we looked at curtain rods & hardware and I would highly advise against this as they make it so much more complicated than necessary. Also finding your way around the store is confusing. 

PROS the pizza in the cafe is REALLY good. and they do have other nice accessories, etc. 

I just hope they take reviews into consideration and train their staff properly and fix issues with product and delivery.",igxHnHIvESXO4_NI3vR0UQ,1,0,2,QDi78XmrMqIbaohJB194ow

Ordered a dollar ice cream cone with my card at the downstairs food counter. Employee was uninterested, bored, and quickly asked me if I needed a receipt. I said no. Thought she would just throw it away, but my card ended up being charged over $95 and some change that night.

Came to speak to the manager in person the next morning and she said there's nothing she can do--can't check cameras, can't check transaction history, nada. So she suggested I file an investigation with my bank.

I ended up doing just that. This already took an hour out of my time calling my bank and IKEA corporate. Three months later,  my bank denied my investigation. So I called IKEA corporate again. Another hour on the call and the rude customer service rep repeatedly told me there was nothing he could do since I don't have a receipt. For a dollar ice cream cone from 3 months ago. I was fed up and he ended the call. I ended up calling again out of frustration, hoping the next rep would have better news for me.

Luckily, the next corporate representative was empathetic, apologetic, and helpful. She was just who I needed despite already being on the second hour of being on the phone with IKEA corporate. She contacted the head office of IKEA Vegas and talked to them about my refund and told me she got it all sorted for my refund, and advised to just look out for a phone call from them.

A week later, got a voicemail from the location about my refund receipt coming in the mail which ended up taking another two months.

(10 minutes from the house!! :D) We are an IKEA family, walk thru any room in our house and you'll find furniture, decor, and goods from the Nordic giant. I can also basically speak Swedish now, since I know about 50 words thanks to the naming of their products.

IKEA doesn't just have the most amazing and inexpensive wares, they create a real EXPERIENCE for the shopper. Starting upstairs, you travel with your 4 wheel drive shopping cart thru vignettes of kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, living rooms and see the furniture in action. The children's section is a highlight filled with toys and colorful furniture. When you tire you can stop at the restaurant have their meatballs!!!

Head downstairs and sift thru dishes ($3 glass serving bowls!), bed linens, rugs (I don't even need rugs and I have about 10 IKEA rugs), pots and pans, lighting, and more. Next stop is the warehouse to pick up your items and make your purchases. 

There is a little grocery mart after the check out line along with fast food service. They have hotdogs, pop, and ice cream!

There is a children's play area near the entrance (and a pick up area later), but I haven't been able to send my son in yet. It's always filled. I'm sure we will get a chance soon enough.

When leaving you can move your car into one of the parking bays near the exit, so you don't have to move a lot of heavy furniture very far. There is also family parking off to the side of the entrance which always seems to have open spaces in these early days. I think this IKEA seems smaller to me than the Tempe one, but I can't be sure.

I've been waiting for the day that I would live close to an IKEA and I had an ongoing online wishlist waiting for me to spend my money on.

When I entered IKEA I was already distracted by all of the people leaving with soft serve. We were already on a hunt to find it. We went upstairs to the cafe and didn't see any on the menu, but was side tracked and decided to order some Swedish meatballs (delicious) and chicken tenders (a bit too dry). We were so amazed by the tray carts and then the concept of just placing our trays with leftover food directly on the shelves.

I forgot my IKEA family reward account information, but luckily they had a bunch of kiosks around the store so I was able to print myself out one.

After our small lunch we headed out of my lengthy shopping adventure. Although I knew what I wanted and already had the locations of the items needed, I still decided to grab a pencil and paper to list down new discoveries in the showroom. After I finished going room to room and grabbing stuff along the way, I made my way downstairs to start the bulk of my shopping.

Layout of the store was perfect. Items were all easy to find without assistance. With that being said, there were a lot of employees on the sales floor to assist. They even had items in stock that were out of stock at all of our California locations. The check out was speedy (tons of registers open) and to my surprise for the amount of stuff I purchased my ""damage"" wasn't too bad.

We discovered the snack bar on our way out and got the soft serve we were looking for. They also had icees, but we'll save those for a future trip.

There was a loading zone with a lot of stalls, my husband pulled up our suv and we loaded up & went on our way. Can't wait for another shopping trip.",AaSLAEZDoyYiYJJW10LnzA,0,0,5,9VT-zt_acwthHBvqHvXudw

I never knew I needed all the stuff I bought until I walked through the store. All the little cute things like miniature decorative plants, cool lighting fixtures, stuffed animals, and more.

My favorite parts of the sales floor are the unit displays showing what's possible with very little square footage.  At least I know where to go if I decide to buy a ting home.

I drive by Ikea often since it's on my way home and the parking lot has been full since tge preview. I will be returning to buy more stuff as soon as the crowd dies down a bit.

Thank you to Gregg W. and Mike B. for letting me know that the bistro and store had separate business listings. Hopefully Yelp HQ will separate the bistro from the store one day.

Unfortunately, the bistro service leaves me wanting. We wanted the standard meatball meal but they were out of mashed potatoes. So we decided to get just the meatballs with some gravy the berry sauce. When we were cashing out, the cashier and supervisor appeared to be having a conversation about whether to charge us a full meal price or not.

Here are my thoughts :

Quality - 3 star furniture. I sat on a few sofas and chairs and for the price, I have no idea how the price can be justified for the quality.  These are high priced items. A sofa costing 900.00 but very uncomfortable, unless your a lumber young child. 

Prices - 3 star. I felt that the prices Overall are overly expensive for the quality. Great for apartment dwellers and students and anyone who want a more minimalistic approach with their furniture. 

Service- 5 star. I feel everyone here is top notch. From the traffics staff to the floor staff everyone likes to help. 

Must see-  this is a place that is a must visit. I enjoy walking around and window shopping. I enjoy all the ideas. I will hit things here for my kids for sure. 

Food- I will review this place again when I go back for the food. During this opening time, it was super busy. 


Great place and fun to be part of the overall experience. 

Note that they won't give you bags after your purchase. You can buy a blue reusable bag for $0.99 or bring your own bags.

 They have a good selection of pots for said plants at great prices, too.
 The one star knock off is that if you buy some plants, decorative bottles, sparkling pear juice, and get to the register you will see that they don't supply bags.

I used to buy Ikea items when I lived in CA and ate top ramen, but not so much anymore. I find most of the stuff great for kids or for dorm rooms. It is also good for small kitchen type items or storage. 

This location is off of Durango and 215 or sunset and has a ton of non covered parking. At the entrance they have a kid area where you can drop your kid off for an hour, an elevator and an escalator. There are two stories. The 2nd story is the showroom where you can walk through different rooms and check out the Ikea products in work in real world situations. The kitchen islands look really cool and the lighting is awesome. It is fun to explore all of the drawers to see what is inside.

Upstairs you can also find restrooms which are cute with their small sinks for kids. They also have a medical alarm button in the handicap bathroom stall for a medical emergency which I thought was neat. You can also find the cafe which at this early on in the grand opening is always crowded and takes at least 25 minutes of wait time to get to the front. At the Cafe, you can find the elevator/escalator back down. 

The downstairs has all the small knicknacks you need for your kitchen and a ton of other stuff. Its just crazy how much stuff they have. Follow the lighted arrows on the floor to get you around.

This morning I thought I hit the jackpot when I got my number in the return area & there were just 3 people ahead of me. It took 30 minutes before I was called. Really?

I purchased some frozen desserts that were inedible-& I'll eat just about anything sweet. One called ""Almondy"" had very little almond flavor. A look at the ingredient list showed almonds late in the listing, behind vegetable fat. Eww. Another tasted like bad rumballs but there was no mention of rum-just marzipan of which there was no flavor. What a waste of money!

IKEA to me, is like Lego's for furniture. The fun and fulfillment come from building your furniture yourself that you can't get at any other furniture store. I can stay in the store forever. I enjoy looking at furniture, designs, fabrics and different materials.

Everything is organized. You start on the main floor. Follow the arrows on the floor for proper flow of traffic. At every section, there are information cards, pencils and paper measuring ""tape"" to make your shopping experience better. You can write down the item number and where it's located in the warehouse on the info card. You can measure furniture and see if it fits your room according to your specs.

Best part is nobody follows you around hungry for a commission. You walk around freely. Get ideas...and buy 4 shower curtains like me. I can be bored or sad and come here then, I leave feeling happy again. I helped a friend move and get new furniture from here. I got to assemble furniture...YUSSS!!!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,8,5,qRFxB6fytuhRdX1fejj_kQ

They have good quality material for a portion of the price because mainly the consumer assembles. However you can have them delivery it to your home and have them professionally assemble it as well (for a fee of 79$).

This location opens at 10 am but I believe the cafe inside opens around 9 am. Their cinnamon roll is a 6 pack for 4$ and it's great heated with a cup of tea or coffee in the morning. Lindenberry jam is great on toasted bread or on their famous Swedish meatballs! Cafe has good decent food.

One tip: come in the morning on the weekend and check out their as if section. They have pretty good quality of sofa, chairs, and desk and some don't even have any damage! Can't beat that price too but keep in mind these items are already assembled so you will need to take them as is.",0aGMVKiNqmY1kCc5983UkQ,0,2,4,_M03aH8X2sq8aKLWzdfBWw

I expected all out chaos but was pleased to find more of a ""controlled"" chaos. Parking on a Monday night was very smooth... lots of traffic control and plenty of spaces. The store was packed, and my biggest complaint is that people on the main thoroughfare of the showroom stop right in the middle, without regard to the traffic flow. If they're going to stop, they should move into the show areas and not stop in the middle of the main walkway. 

The merchandise itself it well priced if you look at it for what it is... inexpensive furniture and housewares for all. Nothing custom or special here but if you have a good eye, you can take some of this stuff and really build on it in your own home. 

The main restaurant line was intimidating, and we didn't even stop. We waited approximately 10 minutes in line to purchase merchandise, and 15 minutes at the market. The market line runs slower than expected, considering what they serve. Some of the employees very slowly placed hot dogs in buns with no sense of urgency.

The showrooms and each section of Ikea is exactly how I remember it should be based on other locations. I was more excited for the food, like the Swedish meatballs. The line for the café was long so I passed on that, but definitely had a good look of the prices for their selections. If I'm ever in the area, I will definitely go there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

Overall, Nevada needed an Ikea. The location is on 215 off Durango, a little far from where I reside, but with a lot and store that big, it's better where it is at. The prices and selections for not only furniture, but home essentials is what makes Ikea the best place to shop for those must have items.

I came in to buy an entertainment center. Found what I wanted. First, you have to take the paper from the display which shows all the individual pieces you need. Then you go to the warehouse which is the size of a football field and hunt down individual pieces. That alone took 2 hours. Half the items were not in the right place on the shelves. After loading all the pieces on a dolly head to check out, which takes forever.

Delivery...$60 which is fair. But you have to wait in line again at the delivery desk and they have to re-scan everything. Oh, and they can't use the 'quantity' button so if you have 50 screws and 80 bolts they have to scan EACH one. That took 30 minutes.

I was so exhausted when I left after 4 hours I went home and straight to bed.

My items were delivered in a big pile. Guess what... no direction on how to put it together. What a mess. Never again. A total waste of time and a total hassle. If you need furniture go to a traditional place like Walker, point to what you want, get it delivered next day assembled.

As for the food... yea its cheap a few dollars to eat. Its also nasty and an invitation to Type 2 Diabetese. 300lb kids shoveling that crap in their faces like a famine is about to hit.

I'm a fan, and I have been for many years. I have traveled to California just to get a KALLAX (and stop by Disneyland)... full disclosure I can't say any of the names for the furniture pieces that I own. To address the obvious, it is busy and it will be for quite some time. Think of it as cyber Monday/black Friday event that occurs at one location everyday, all day. The simple fact is that IKEA decided to plop a location in the desert and locals have lost their composure. Jokes aside... business as usual.

The parking was spacious, but I was hoping for a garage. 100 plus degree heat is not going to be kind to those that will likely park outside IKEA for more than 20 minutes. 

The layout of the show rooms, and departments seem to be about the same as other locations I have been too. The cafe layout--- I could not tell you because the crowds filled in all the possible square footage I could see... I'm about 5'0'' so I couldn't see much. 

If you have kids, IKEA has Småland which is a place for kids to hangout and run around with other kids for 45-60 minutes for FREE!!! Granted, after time has elapsed the kids will need to be picked up.

Friendly advice, have a fully charged phone to take pictures of the different items and their correlating tags. There are pencils and paper, but in my experience I will lose them or they got swedish meatballs on them. You will be able to pick up the items down stairs. I loved all the show rooms! There are so many ways to design and create a room with inexpensive items that will hold up very well. Imagination is endless in this place.

Came with a friend who's a seasoned IKEA shopper to show me the ropes and I was hooked right from the start. I found furniture that I will be back to purchase before the year is out. Everything from quality sectionals for my living room to accessories for those blank spaces in my new home. The decor they have here is nice too. I snagged an Audrey Hepburn large piece of wall art for my bedroom for only $40 and a naggingly difficult to assemble $12.99 lamp for my bedroom as well. I had to put my wallet on a leash to stop from buying more. I have time.

Can you imagine how stalker I became when it was announced that IKEA was coming to Vegas?? Food is super cheap here (99cent breakfast, free coffee, and lunch/dinner entries range from $1-6). You get anywhere from desserts, treats, to their infamous meatballs, pasta and salmon and more. The cafeteria is always clean (yes my kids have spilled soda all over the place on more occasions than I am happy to admit, and the associates were all over that spill with mops and signs like ninjas in the night). There is a kids area with tiny tables & chairs, plus a tv console playing movies all day long. Add in a few activity centers, and my kids are entertained always while I sip some coffee with my cheesecake. You are served food on ceramic ware, beverages in glass cups, and there are silverware to dine with. I never see plastic or paper plates unless it is the weekend or something event where dishwashing is just beyond possible for them. Okay enough about my obsession with the cafeteria. Did I mention that the chilcare center downstairs is offered free of charge? You can drop off your potty-trained kids for 1 hour (or up to 1.5 hours if you are a family card member, free to sign up btw). Sometimes there is a waiting list as the area becomes filled beyond capacity, but I've never waited more than 15 minutes for my kid to get in there. There has always been a flatscreen tv playing all the latest kids movies in the lobby, equipped with small chairs for the kids to view, and couch areas for the parents to wait. Lately they started putting coloring paper and markers/crayons out there too! Okay let's move onto the shopping. Upstairs is where you'll find the displays and model rooms to get your inspiration. Although I've seen people use the tiny pencils and charts to write down where to locate their products from the warehouse, I'm more prone to just snap a picture of it on my phone. Downstairs is where you'll find the storage of all your products. Many larger pieces need to be put together by YOU tho, so be prepared for some hands-on work. Our last Billy bookcase came with an instruction manual but nothing in English, so we just followed pictures to put it together. Definitely please please Please check out the Last Chance section before heading to checkout. It is basically attached the pieces that are display items, or have been purchased and then returned, or are slightly damaged. I've found great coffee tables here ($30 or so) that were on display, as well as a couple armchairs for about $90 each. Be sure to inspect the couches for rips as most of them will have some kind of defect that is easy to patch up. I deeply support their mission for keeping as many out of the landfill as possible, and these Last Chance items are a great way to do that, as well as save some cheddar. On your way out the store, is a market & bistro area to purchase some swedish treats & groceries. Great way to pickup some frozen editions of whatever you liked from the cafeteria. I've gotten 3 packs of the swedish meatballs for $19, and also picked up the salmon and veggie medallions here. There is a self-serve candy bar, and somewhat of a concession stand right before the exit. Hotdog & soda combo for $1.50. Soft yogurt cone for $1, and you can tell the kids that it's ice cream. Awesome and delicious way to end our shopping journey! PS - it's okay if you start your IKEA adventure in the wrong direction - we usually go against the flow of traffic since we started from the cafeteria instead of the lobby like others. Just be courteous and stay on the right side. Be mindful of running over tiny humans as you pass thru the kids section.",lIXDiXM-gh1F1L4O-HxkQQ,1,1,5,7wCyHEt6KgJchiW0msLi6A

They also don't have to-go boxes in their restaurant. Should also note that.

The parking is a complete disaster because of the amount of people going to the store. You have to wait in a huge line in your car to even get into the parking lot. Once you park, you have to walk about a mile to get into the store (which isn't the best idea when you buy the entire store, going in expecting just to buy a spoon). 

Inside the store was complete chaos. It was worse than going to a theme park on the busiest day. The amount of people at the store was just crazy and, of course, no one is paying attention to where they are walking and decide to walk and stop in the middle of the aisle. Oh, and there was a HUGE line for...wait for it.....BALLOON ANIMALS....yeah I wish I was kidding. Not that I wanted a balloon animal, but the line was so long it was cutting into the walkways. 

I would recommend waiting at least a month to come here until the hype is over. Trust me, you'll want to wait. Needless to say, I went to the nearest bar after coming here to get myself a drink after surviving.

Anyways, the items in the store, prices, and layout is great. I went in thinking I was going to buy only a coffee table and came out with a rug, sheets, and some kitchen items (not fun to take to my car that I parked ten thousand miles away). The prices are ridiculous (in a good way) for what you are getting, which Ikea is known for. Was it worth the chaos? Maybe. Will I be going again? Absolutely. Will it be soon?

I had to fight my way through the sea of soccer moms and hipsters but I did find some great treasures here when I went.  When you first get there, grab a map and a pencil.  When you find an item you like, jot down the location in the warehouse of the item so you can find it easily when you go to the basement. 

I found an item yesterday that didn't have a warehouse location but it said ""see staff member for assistance"". So I wrote down a description and took it down to the basement and showed it to a staff member and he printed out a sheet and told me to take it to the register, pay for the item, then go right and wait at the ""customer pickup"" area.  

When I got there my item wasn't quite ready yet so I went over and grubbed on some pizza and cinnamon buns.  People rave about the meatballs but IMHO the pizza is where it's at!

They do have a daycare for the kiddos for up to one hour but, alas, they have to be potty trained.  My two year old ain't quite there yet but I scored the LOCKIG training potty at IKEA for $9.99 so he'll soon be there.

I will say by the time we made it through all of the displays upstairs I was almost too tired to shop for anything downstairs. The way it works is when you see the furniture upstairs you take a picture of the tag or write the info down  and then when you get to the bottom levelthere is a warehouse near the checkout where you actually grab the boxed furniture, so you're not carrying it throughout the store.

Damien provided quick, efficient service when I purchased 2 Stuva beds.  He carefully reviewed my order, he was patient and he ensured I had my IKEA Family number for me to receive a $100 savings.

Lester in Returns cheerfully accepted my special $20 coupon, which I was remiss to use during check out. ""The No Problem"" and ""I can help you"" attitude was appreciated. Thank you Lester.

In one of the boxes, a piece for a wardrobe was incorrectly prepared. The holes were not drilled in the accurate places and would not align with the next piece.

Do they have anybody behind the call center? As I know Ikea has great quality sustainable products but surprisingly they have very awful customer service quality. I called 888 with those holding times with only one rude respond that they can not help me but I have to call the store which impossible way to do due to they simply hide the local number from public. Example,I purchased from New York Ikea which show their local number to call. But Las Vegas, I search on the order receipt, none! That guy at the delivery desk told me that he will send the confirmation to my email, I gone nothing! I find that hard to believe that a store does not have any local number.

I have found some really good pieces of furniture at Ikea like an adjustable standing desk, storage and shelving. I'll also sometimes pick up a plant since they are very affordable and easily sustainable. 

I recommend doing all your measurements and have them with you as well as measuring tape so you don't have to guess especially with Ikea's refund policy. Don't pay a reboxing fee if you can plan your project. 

I really like going to walk around and get ideas for home projects. I usually start by entering though the exit door and grabbing a frozen yogurt cone or drink to walk with unless I plan on grabbing a snack upstairs. I like their chicken fingers, Swedish meatballs and salmon dishes in the upstairs dining room and it's affordable for a simple meal.

On this trip, I bought a storage cube set called Kallax for $65 which is really nice and has drawer and door add on accessories.

5908490,2017-02-05,4,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"Ikea is always a hit and a miss. And today was a miss.... I am so upset with the store.  First off the store is huge and a maze, so for an associate to tell you where to go find an item is like telling someone to go find Waldo without your glasses on. 
Today's experience prove to be difficult.  I am exhausted mentally and  physically.  An associate assure me that the item I needed wasn't far away. After giving him the deer lost in headlight look, he graciously agreed to walk me there.(more like had because I couldn't mentally pull up a map in my head) 
So after walking what prove to be far, he couldn't even find the item, and decided we should go back and give the department a call!  Well F&@k that's what I wanted to do in the beginning of the conversation
So let me give you a Lil backstory so you can understand my frustration. I took pictures of the items I wanted and the tag with the Aisle and bin number- no where on the tag did it say I needed to buy bins separately, matter of fact there was no tag indicating it wasn't included in the storage bench!  So now when we're done walking through the maze, I realize the box is too flat to have plastic bins inside!  
So yeah! It literally took me 45 mins and a headache to get what I needed, and the associate never wanted to admit that the department these bins were in, are not as close as he claimed- instead halfway back into the store he told me we can walk back if you don't want to find theses anymore, after I kept complaining that this is definitely far!  I wanted to tell him off, but I choose to continue on my miserable Ikea adventure!
Now fast forwarding I got my bins and my family is waiting in the car, I see two massively long ass lines!  I am like WTF!!!! 45mins is gonna turn into 1 1/2... So I angrily walk to customer store and complain to a manager and she agrees to ring me up as a one time courtesy!  Wow thanks for making my day awesome- said the angry Ikea shopper! Like I wanted to hear that! And she also agreed to give my feedback to the manager in the associates' department. Without even taking any names or description gives me little hope that my complaint and experience even mattered!

5918849,2017-11-15,4,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I took IKEA for granted when I lived in California.  There was a huge one that they opened up near Oakland, next to the super congested freeway if you are on your way into San Francisco or heading south to Silicon Valley.  And there are a bunch of them in SoCal, that I routinely visited when I go to visit family.

So it was a great event to finally have Las Vegas be financially worth the risk for IKEA opening a new store in the SW of Las Vegas.  Certainly the housing and retail construction booms have picked up significantly since the day this IKEA broke ground.

So at least a year have pass since the grand opening festivities.  The parking lot is not nearly as full, at least not when I go and browse for random items for the kitchen or bathroom or just to pick up a few of their chocolate bars sold on pallets.

Customer service, when I needed assistance, have all been good.  The associates know their store well, and the shortcuts to skip right to the exact section I need to go for the specific items I was trying to hunt down.

The food court is kept reasonably clean. I have only ate there once, but the unique soda flavors that they serve there is pretty interesting and I occasionally debate about making a slight detour just to try them again.  Although I can't even recall the flavors I have tried. But the emotional response and memory of it was obviously a positive one.

Most Ikea consumers come here for furniture (which is not exactly high quality, but reasonable for the price).  I consider Ikea furniture quality to be mostly suitable for starter homes, kids bedrooms or college students living off campus. The showroom on the second floor is massive, and I am one of those people that can literally come here in the afternoon, lost track of time and end up walking out when the sun has already gone down. Sometimes without having even purchased a single item.

On my most recent trip, I discovered a room near the check out cashiers, where they have random discounted or discontinued or previously purchased items on clearance.  I was really debating about getting a new sink, but it was just a tad too big.  But I did buy an already assembled Holmö Floor Lamp in ""as-is"" condition for $7, so it was a successful trip.

Main tips for shoppers is to bring your own shopping bags or buy one of IKEA's for a $1.

Assembly Required! That or pay for the delivery and assembly service by professionals.

If you have young kids, there is a kids play area to drop them off so shopping can be done in peace. I am not sure if that is a complimentary service or there is a fee for it.

Have friends with a truck or rent an U-Haul truck if furniture is on the shopping list.

 There is only one way in and out. Strongly suggest picking up a brochure map on your way in, it may help find shortcut passages. 

 Make use of the tools provided such as the measuring tape and pencils and note pads.

 Keep in mind when purchasing lamps and furniture, some of the coolest lamps will take time to put together as a project, let alone unwrap from all the individual packaging. Consider their assembly service.

I, like many other Las Vegas Locals highly anticipated Ikea finally open in Las Vegas, after either driving out to CA or paying shipping fees. Personally I get a bit deterred here after a while, it can feel like shopping during black Friday sales with all the people rummaging through out the store. 

Although there is a designated area for children to play while you shop as you enter, Not sure if it's complimentary. It can be a bit overwhelming as occasionally children run about the narrow display and shelf halls and sets, be weary while walking and or pushing your cart - especially in the kids section. 

I get the excitement of all the sets, I finally got to live out the 500 Days of Summer scene, playing house at Ikea too. The example layouts with the square footage called out is definitely a highlight and allure of the Ikea experience.

I brought my mom to lunch at the Ikea Swedish Market & Bistro. It was like a very clean modern Cafeteria with a minimal yet very effective display of the menu items, and sweet mountain view from the second floor. We tried the meatballs I had heard so much about, which although the side of four meatballs we got wasn't warm, did taste good. We had the chicken cordon bleu, with mashed potatoes deliciously thick gravy, and flavorful well seasoned steamed veggies. We also tried a bit of lentil soup thinking we were hungrier than we were but were full so if you have any left overs you can ask the cashiers for to go boxes however they do not have soup containers or bags. The food was overall very tasty, only wished it were warmer, despite that I shall return.",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,0,1,4,pAeMpIBj2dp2jeiePWhaWw
5995183,2017-04-25,4,OtSbxxD-WNzlNQlDGpXFSA,"I'm trying to find reasons as to why I don't like IKEA but I can't think of any. I mean, what's not to like about it? It's a wonderful place to window shop, dine, and get inspiration.  However, buyer beware! You will find something you won't need and you will buy it because it's cheap! IKEA has a way of telling you that you need a piece of item when you really don't. Next thing you know, you're dropping a whole paycheck on things you didn't even consider buying until you saw it on the showroom! 

Still, if you're a homeowner, you can just imagine why IKEA would be my guilty pleasure. The products are cheap at they're good quality. Sometimes, I think to myself, there's no way something like this could cost so cheap but I'm wrong! I've made several trips to this store and I'm very happy with all my purchases. Now, the only problem I have is that maybe my home is starting to look like a showroom. Maybe that's not a bad thing? 

Customer service here isn't bad at all. I've never really had a hard time with them and many are super friendly. Of course they get high traffic every day so I can see why some of them aren't super enthusiastic about being associates. But I'm not complaining. 

Also, who knew you can combine food and a furniture store together? The cafeteria is super cheap and well-portioned. Sometimes my girlfriend and I come over here just to dine in. Seriously, the food really isn't bad at all. And who can deny cinnamon rolls, hotdogs, ice cream and pizza all at one dollar each? I know I can't. 

I'm forever going to be an IKEA fan and I'm not sure how I'd find myself running to the competition. It's gotten to the point when I go to Target and think, IKEA has better stuff even though sometimes I know they don't. Well, what can I say, I have some hardcore brand loyalty.
