It was my first introduction to Colombian food and now I try to go once a week! Really friendly and helpful staff; they make you feel like family. If you're a first timer, they'll explain the different items and make recommendations, but really, everything is delicious!",f1jVkOXO3fdeUSgT02scjw,1,0,5,pSMn8YoGohqsAQ03i1kEYw

The vegan arepa with the plantain and avocado is worth going to find this truck. Prices are good, the people are nice and we are happy they have such a lovely vegan option.",QFF1f0rttfk2BqDYVhFsAQ,2,0,5,rQOQvTSAL2wxoiJu9rkiqg

Friends and family gather here for a good time. The new cook, a young man in his late 20's early 30's has revamped the place and some how the food taste so much more appetizing. He is very courteous, polite and fast. If he doesnt have too many orders he'll even deliver the food so you won't have to get up. I recommend the patacon con carne desmechada its my favorite its a green plantain smashed n fried with shredded beef on top n they add crumbled chips n sauces.",nf3FECdKi40rqqapJgpgxg,0,0,5,B3wv1n93mAdVRu7-ALrenA

I would strongly recommend #6 Patacon de Carne desmechada! You can't go wrong with it, and comes along with a very humble friendly staff! Enjoy!",BMdGMMVUsPOwz3RinFEfRQ,1,1,5,OZ0DxgXT5rydtAh18I_XnQ

Look for the colorful trailer playing vallenato music in the Shell parking lot at Sahara and Torrey Pines. They are open from 4pm until midnight Wednesday through Sunday, but these hours are subject to change. Menu items include arepas, patacones, salchipapas, hot dogs and longaniza, and nothing costs more than $4. They even offer an arepa burger.

If you've only tried Venezuelan arepas, Colombian style is different. The corn masa is about as thick as three tortillas stacked and the ingredients are layered on top instead of cutting the arepa and filling it. The flavor of the arepa itself is a little bland. There's a variety of sauces used to spice it up, including creamy green cilantro sauce and salsa Golf (mayo with tomato paste and seasonings).

The lady running the truck spoke Spanish, but there's plenty of food pictures if you need to point and order. She didn't understand when my husband requested avocado, so he asked for palta (that's what they say in Peru) and I eventually translated this to aguacate. They don't have aguacate. He ordered salchipapa criolla and a chicken arepa, and I requested a plain cheese arepa. 

The cook actually forgot my arepa, so my husband got his food first. Salchipapas consists of fried hotdog slices mixed with french fries. Order it criolla style, and you will get small yellow potatoes instead of fries. The potatoes are very soft and tasted good with salsa Golf, which is the South American version of fry sauce. The chicken on his arepa didn't look too fresh. It was topped with cheese, chopped cole slaw, and crushed potato chips. I eventually received my arepa with melted cheese and two slices of queso fresco. It was pretty good with the sauces; maybe I should have asked for some cole slaw.

I recommend Arepa Xpress if you're looking to try something different, and I will probably be back to try the patacones, which replace the corn arepa with a fried slice of smashed green plantain. I can't say this will be one of my regular stops, because there's a few South American cuisines that I crave more than Colombian.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,6,3,3,CDWaoPI0MmzZq8JE3c-8KQ

I strongly recommend the Colombian style hot dogs, definitely a must! The best hot dog you've ever tried, I promise! It's colombian fast food at its best. U can even call in or text your orders ahead of time so they can have them ready for u. And now with the cold weather upon us they will bring the orders out to ur car, can't beat that!",hn1K75O82lrPJjczt4IbRw,1,1,5,pyY8TtdhXIaNe-IHWKKN3Q
