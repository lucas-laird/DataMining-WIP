1516379,2015-06-17,1,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,"Avoid. Maybe I've been spoiled by the great Taiwanese hot pot places in L.A.'s San Gabriel Valley, but the hot pot at this restaurant is so old school in a bad way that I will never go back. I had the spicy beef hot pot because the mutton hot pot wasn't available. It was big but mostly cabbage. There were 2 quail eggs, a clam, random assortment of tofu and fish balls, and a few enoki mushrooms in the broth, too, but that's about it. Literally only 3 pieces of raw beef on the side in a small plate to dip into the broth. Broth was completely flavorless, practically water.

If you are hoping for something at the level of Boiling Point, you will be disappointed. Everything in the pictures look better than the food actually tastes. This place reminds me of how good Boiling Point has the formula down, and why they were so successful in bringing hot pot to the mainstream. 

Also had the side of stinky tofu. Completely dry and flavorless plastic, and not stinky at all. Maybe good if u are non-Chinese/Taiwanese and can't stand the smell of the authentic good stuff.

Finally had the mango shaved ice for dessert. Disgusting. Mangoes were mushy and tasted off with the consistency of bad oysters. Shaved ice was literally that--hard and grainy--using an antiquated machine unlike the modern shaved ""snow"" that most places in SoCal now have. I'm hoping the other hot pot place in town is better, otherwise I will never have hot pot again while in Vegas this year. 

All of the good reviews of this restaurant on Yelp are misleading--they must be written by friends of the restaurant or people who have no idea what good hot pot is supposed to taste like. With all the great Chinese/Taiwanese/Japanese food available in this area, I predict this restaurant will go under within the year unless their food drastically improves, because at this time I can't imagine anyone actually eating there wanting to go back as a repeat customer.",YUdYbT0b5wd3swLYK36-ZQ,2,1,2,h8iTh2zs4Q3BA0ymJax1eQ

You don't order one hotpot bowl to share with the table but rather everyone others their own hotpot. In each variation you can choose from there are so many different ingredients in. So it feels you get a bit of everything. Hotpot really tastes so great - even though the portion was big I couldn't stop eating and finished every single bite of it. 

In addition to that the service is very attentive and staff is extremely friendly. They look after you like you are a family member and make you feel like home. That was really an outstanding experience. As a ""goodbye"" desert you get a cup of homemade tea for take away. 

Prices are around 12 Dollar for a hotpot. It's totally worth the money.

The place my friends and I usually went to had gone downhill - they were really good when they first opened, but now its just bad. When looking at the pictures some people had posted of the menu - I instantly thought of boiling point in caifornia, because the menus looked similar and they had stinky tofy pot. I am not a fan of stinky tofu but my friends are..ick. When we went for dinner, everything was 20% off for the grand opening. They only have water, green tea, and black tea for now - they don't charge for the teas yet, because I think they feel bad for the limited selection of drinks. Our table had a varndiety of pots ordered - ""the stinky tofu is actually stinky""...whatever that means but that was the concensus from the people that had ordered it haha The japanese hot pot is good as well.

Overall? I felt like some of the portions of food that go into the pot could have been bigger, the staff is REALLY nice, not as good as boiling point but better than the other hot pot places in Las Vegas, and they give you really sweet oranges all cut up for dessert.",sz6mhYqelucFzEATxsEuGQ,2,1,4,bskoRaXdPwI_Fo6bfbYQ5g

My boyfriend and I both got a hotspot thinking that we were both hungry. Well one pot is definitely more than enough for two people. I got the seafood pot and there was about 80% Napa cabbage to 20% meat. So I got 2 shrimps, 2 clam shells and inedible crab that was more for flavor than edible. My boyfriend got a beef pot in which the meat was brought out carpaccio style after the hot pot. 

It was alright, I am not going to ask for more seafood but a seafood pot was 13.95 and his pot was 12 something but we orders some sides and apps and the meal ended up to be about 45.00 plus tip.

It comes out much like Boiling Point back in SoCal, where they give you most of the food already in the pot.. But everything down from the aesthetics of it, the amount of food you get, and the flavors were only sub-par. 

When we first got our food, both my friend and I had this blank look on our faces because the food had just come out, and the broth wasn't boiling, and the vegetables already looked soggy. The broth was just OK in flavor. It kinda tasted like you could've made it with an instant package or something. It didn't have any special flavor to it, really. I had the spicy beef, and my friend had the seafood, but really the only difference in flavor was that mine was a spicy version of his. 

I think the only I liked about it was that we got a 20% discount because they're still in their grand opening. Actually, they did give us free iced black tea that was pretty good. 

Also mind you, I know it was Monday night, but we came at 7PM and there was only one other table occupied. Food for thought.",Zukq_iyq6bItd9NBiur13g,3,0,2,U7R1lfDrj6-rNFL_vk_bwg

I wanted the mutton hot pot but they told me it's seasonal and also the only one that's not available on the menu. I decided to go with the beef hot pot but it was full of cabbage and fillers. The sliced beef is also too lean for my liking and my mild spicy level is actually quite spicy already.

It's slim pickings for hot pots in Vegas so I cant really complain too much. It'd be nice to have a get your own stuff and cook it at your table style but I think those guys have yet to find the right balance between price and the health dept to make a profit in order to stay open.

New location for Hotpot / Taiwanese food by Chinatown. I've been here before when it was the other restaurant but the food didn't really stand out.  Decided to try out this location for dinner with a friend and tried out the hotpot option on the menu. Originally I was going to try out the Taiwanese dishes but they have 20% off on hotpot items for the spring - summer time so might as well take advantage of a $8.00 something meal.

The food was very filling. Two people could share 1 pot if you are planning to order a few sides. If you have a big appetite or very hungry, recommended to get a pot your self. But the pot comes with a variety of items depending on which Hot Pot you get. 

Stinky Tofu Hot Pot
This was very good. I'm a big fan of Stinky Tofu but never tried Stinky Tofu hotpot. Its basically a standard hotpot with but with stink tofu inside. You can taste the stink in the tofu, so that means it was good. The hotpot came with choice of rice or noodle. It also has quail eggs, fish balls, tempura, slice pork, lettuce and some other ingredients inside. 

The owner stop by and talked with us and let me know that the Satay sauce was homemade. It tasted very good and I was quite surprise that they make their own Satay sauce

Restaurant was very spacious and had a very clean appearance front of house. The presentation of the food was clean and unique. Normally when we think of Taiwanese places the presentation is never something that is concentrated on .

I like the Spicy Fermented Tofu Hot Pot but Boiling Point was not able to adjust it to the spicy level I wanted. The waiter suggested me to get the pot with original broth and put the spicy broth aside so I could adjust the level of spicy accordingly. The hot pot was full of different ingredients ( 2 clams, , 4 fish balls, 2 Quail eggs, thin fish cake slices, Taro, several Pig Blood Cakes,  Fermented Tofu and lots of vegetables). Normally, I don't finish the whole pot ( even in Boiling Point that most people believe the best mini hot pot restaurant)  but I did  finish whole pot this time.  
Service was very friendly and it is 20% off during the Grand Opening and free tea.  
Location is not in a busy plaza so you can park right in front of the restaurant. They did not have their sign on yet so as today, it is still showing A & K Restaurant. 

I truly hope this restaurant can last much much longer since it is hard to find authentic Taiwanese Restaurants in Vegas.

Ordered extra beef slices and the homemade fishcake with the Hotpot, everything was pretty fresh and tasty. I think the pork chop could be improved on with a thicker pork chop, one we had today was too thin and lacked flavor. I believe the owners here are the same owners of Little Kitchen Cafe in Chinatown Plaza and the pork chop rice there was much better. The seafood Hotpot was good but it could have more seafood, one I had today had two shrimps, two clams, some crab, fish balls, Quail eggs, thin fish cake slices, and lots of vegetables. It's a lot more satisfying than the hotspots I had at ""booming spot mini hotpot"". So for those who liked ""Booming Spot mini Hotpot"", this place is much better. Maybe they can make it even better with real soup stock for the hotspots., if they're not already.
It's 20% off hotspots right now if that makes any difference with free iced teas. Service was very friendly and they seemed to want comments from their customers.

Hope they'll last longer and with some improvements, I'm sure they will since there are not many hotpot restaurants around.",G5HJ8ojD6Dx515m-eJYaXQ,0,0,4,00kmxli10Kjsfo0kNTmUEw

If you're coming down from the I-15 spring mountain the restaurant will be on your right hand side, it can be easy to miss if you're not paying attention. The layout of the place is pretty spacious and clean. If you were asian it would feel like that type of place that your mom and dad would always eat at on Sunday afternoons.

The waiters are here are superrrr caring. I accidentally dropped my chopsticks and they immediately replaced it, without me waving someone down. Water was always refilled. Always checked up on. What more could you ask for?

I usually come here with a friend and end up ordering the #5 seafood & tofu, and #6 spicy beef. Personally I'm a bigger fan of the #5. The broth is on point! It has sliced pork, crab, shrimps, fish fillet, clan, cuttlefish, fish ball, fried tofu skin and a whole bunch of other delicious add ons :)). Like I said though it's all very standard, nothing that says OMG THIS IS THE BEST HOTPOT. Prices are pretty cheap too 13.99-15.99.

Anyways this place is a nice place to stop by if youre looking for a random place to eat at chinatown.",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,2,1,4,O04BldBwP9n-N3JrixOr9A
5276133,2015-02-02,0,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,The food is delicious and authentic Taiwan styles.  Black paper Sauteed Beef Steak was amazing and comes with salad and garlic bread. Seafood & Tofu pot is one of my favorite and with 10 choices and selections in hot pots.,6MIlN2zR41j3IZNEJVjhiA,2,1,5,uxAqUXrBS8O0xRvmikLcIg
5307778,2015-03-11,1,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,"The staff here is nice. They are so hospitable, you feel like a guest in their kitchen. Only one person here speaks English, kind of. Everyone else knows a few words. I know a few words in Mandarin. Guess we are even!

The food is not worth coming back for. We tried several appetizers: cold seaweed, cold cucumber, popcorn chicken. Several hot pots: miso, lamb, and a spicy one. A dry noodle with minced pork. 

Everything seems to be of a lower quality. The chicken was very poor quality. It didn't resemble chicken in the least bit. The hot pots are like 90% cabbage, and either forgot the protein entirely or gave very small amounts. The minced pork lacked depth.

This restaurant is somewhat busy during dinner hours, I just don't know why. Maybe it's the yelp hype (friend reviews, perhaps?!) The staff get easily lost with all the people. 

All I can say is, if you think this is good, you haven't had a real, proper hot pot. This is where we are not even, 100C. My first time cooking lu rou mien was light years ahead of their version... And my mom's homemade hot pot is so fresh and full of delicious ingredients. 

100C has the hospitality, but not the skill.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,4,1,2,Ic4kGZKAITzGxBOr7-shFw

5757653,2015-03-12,3,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,"Such a sense of nostalgia coming here and hearing the owners/ workers speak traditional Taiwanese language. :)  Be warned, I only spoke to them in mandarin but I think they speak English too. 

Came here around 4:30, few people in the restaurant, which is good for me since I was eating alone, didn't need to let people see that, got a reputation to uphold!  Very quick and friendly service, they bring you out hot/ice tea. Decently priced items, they have hotpots, they have small appetizers, noodles options or rice options. 

I ordered the first hotpot, the spicy fermented tofu, around $9, for how much food they give you, definitely a good price.  The only downfall was that the tofu wasn't as ""stinky"" as I had hoped, though they do have the fried stinky tofu as an appetizer that you could get..

What I really honestly liked most about this place was how friendly the staff was, it's almost like they're your aunts and uncles, just coming up to you and suggesting what you should add to the food, etc etc.  A very welcoming feeling when you come here which I absolutely loved.  Also the hotpots come with a free tea drink either milk tea or red tea- cold obviously! I got the red tea and damn..that's some good red tea!

Definitely recommend here, easy parking lot, easy ordering, easy food, easy life. bombdiggitydotcom!",FzT-ujff-c11Wa_WdItwig,7,7,5,aqEuDatGLJU8wFyB29sAQg
5774310,2015-03-26,2,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,"Stopped in here after my massage at Bali Foot Spa.

The place is larger than I expected, and I was the only one here at 4:30pm. Its a nice clean place, but lacking some decor to give it some ambiance. Not that it needs any because the food is good.

I had the Japanese Miso hot pot, and it comes loaded with a variety of fish, crab, oysters, vegetables, mushrooms, and much more. So much more that I had no idea what exactly I was eating! I'd never had Chinese hot pot before so this was a different experience compared to Japanese hot pot where you get veggies plus a selected meat. The broth was pretty tasty, just add a little soy sauce to get the salt up a touch and voila! good food!

Free red tea or black tea with your order, and a bowl of rice. 20% off your bill right now as an opening gift. Service was good. As I was finishing up the restaurant had about 5 tables in use so it does get busy as you get closer to the dinner hour. 

Give it a try and lets hear what you think Yelpers!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,4,3,4,fVq9MUN51dP-O6sjl1iZnA
5844915,2015-03-22,1,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,"I am a fan. The mini hot pots are pretty good, it's not the best I've had, but it's decent for Vegas. The good thing is they also have rice, noodle, and hot plate dishes in addition to hot pots, I am happy that I can go to this place with people who don't like mini hot pots. 

They are very new, the service is good, but a little slow. They are still working things out. I will definitely be back for their mini hot pots.",oK1v-yP9ygKWg6M19wWYIQ,1,0,5,Qt8K9ApqCJ2zgeKzs2MBvg

5986591,2015-04-02,0,SbS0cnxFStrlidtwek6b6w,"Tried this place for the first time tonight. We chose seafood hot pot and the spicy beef hot pot. The staff is very attentive and friendly.  The soup base was very flavorful, and was brimming with fresh ingredients--Napa cabbage, shrimp, clams, and various seafood balls. 

The beef had a nice hearty spice, not overwhelming or heavy. The flavors are rich, and there is raw beef served on the side for you to dip.

We chose ramen noodles to add--these are literally package ramen, but it works.

TIP: there's a heating element under your bowl, which will boil your soup after a few minutes.  You can ask to have the element extinguished if you don't like the heat.",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,0,0,5,FH84TPmZYad3pD1PbqL3bQ
