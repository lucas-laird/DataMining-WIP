A little weird but it's okay, I said two please sat down, my friend went to the restroom, as soon as he got back he asked if we were ready, no chance to actually make a decision. But did anyway, once our food arrived, I tried my Tom kha, WORST FOOD IVE EVER TASTED. Mind you I eat Thai food frequently. It tasted like cough syrup my stomach stomach felt weird, went to the bathroom while my friend proceeded to order something else. The food got there, oh here we go, I didn't want to be rude. IT FUCKING SUCKED. I talked it over with my friend and just went up to the register, paid for the food and left. THE WORST PART. I LEFT MY PHONE THERE, a WHEN I CAME BACK TO GET IT, THEY TOLD ME TO LEAVE. I LOOKED OVER THE COUNTER SAW THE PHONE SITTING BEHIND THE COUNTER AND SNATCHED IT. Are you kidding? I could have not paid for the disgusting food and just left but I did and you won't let me get my phone? Worst food and service I've ever encountered.

59904,2016-06-05,0,hT86CbF0p75wKqgAEbWVrA,Came here from a recommendation from another chef. Went around lunch time with my family and it was empty. We got a bunch of dishes family style so we got a good idea of the cooking. We started with papaya salad and beef jerky. Papaya salad is always my fave and this one was one of the best I've ever had. The jerky was just ok. Flavor wasn't the best for me. For entrees we got pad se ew and Thai Thai noodles. The pad se ew was great 4/5 if there was more veggies and meat it would be 5/5. The Thai Thai noodles were amazing as well. There were good amounts of seafood and the noodles were seasoned well. The waitress was also very nice and helped to recommend dishes.

(Their spicy basil fried rice and curries are fantastic. I've often got both the fried rice and curry so I can mix the two for an extra kick.) However, while there is excellent spice levels, the food can be a bit salty on some days.

When they first opened, the lunch specials were awesome! For $6.99, you would get soup, salad, an egg roll, and your entree. They have raised the prices since, but it is still a decent deal. Unfortunately, they're not open consistently and they'd been closed for lunch two out of the three times I've last attempted to go.

Which is plenty for me, but if you have a large appetite there is another option for $9.99 that has a larger portion. 

Previously, this restaurant was Pam Real Thai. I was hooked on their pad kee mao and garlic fried rice. I sulked for weeks when they closed. 

Fortunately, Khun Chai puts out one of the better pad kee mao's around. The veggies are always fresh and crisp, the noodles are tender and sop up the delicious flavor and if you like heat - This is the place! Their scale goes 1-5, I like spicy, but I usually stick with a 2 here because I like the sweetness of the basil to shine through the heat. The Tom Yum soup is excellent. The salads are always fresh and you get your choice of dressing, I'm partial to the honey mustard. The eggrolls are always satisfying as well. It's a great place to grab a quick lunch.

This place takes pride in their music. There was a live singer on stage who did an amazing impression of Bob Dylan's Knocking of Heaven's Door.

First, the person who delivered our food sighed at us when we payed him just because we didn't answer right away, But whatever. We got it cus we understand. No one wants to wait outside at 2am. 
But then we opened our food and we had only gotten one box of white rice filled up half way when each entree comes with one full box (we had 2. We order from here often and we always get two) 
So we called just to see if maybe it was a mistake or if we could go pick it up or something but the people on the phone where really rude??? I asked if
Maybe it was a mistake or something or if maybe it didn't actually always come with rice, but they told me all entrees do
Come with rice and I was even like ""oh maybe it was a mistake it's okay"" And they just started repeating to me my order and eventually just said ""well we can't give you back your rice.........(I said oh.. I just wanted to ask about it) ""ok.. yeah ... bye bye *click*"" It was very rude and passive aggressive and I honestly would've understood or whatever if they hadn't been so rude 
White rice isn't a big deal I can make white rice at home I just don't think I deserved to be spoken to like that and I'd like them to know they where being terrible

They obviously don't care about their costumer service 

And maybe they won't care they lost us because we're just two people but I just want them to know that never in my life had i been treated so terribly from any restaurant employees before and they should really work on that to prevent future loss of costumers",jEWNvHUoeJACjv_eJ2Xu2A,2,0,1,tDYt1LZG_wCI5xMisDgWmw

First off, heads up that their online menu and their in-store charges are different: I find this both dishonest and suspicious, considering they just opened so it's not like the menu actually changed. I ordered the thai thai noodle ($13 online) and was charged $15- I pointed out this discrepancy and the cashier simply said, ""Yeah I know."" Really? Then why was I charged incorrectly? Don't like how this was handled.

THAI THAI NOODLE dish was just okay: ground beef, two shrimp, and some octopus with a ton of bean sprouts and a few rice noodles. PUMPKIN CURRY was tasty but way too spicy- ordered both dishes the same spice level (3) but they were drastically different. Lack of consistency is problematic, what's the point of a scale if you don't adhere to it?

1451378,2016-02-15,4,hT86CbF0p75wKqgAEbWVrA,"The Khun Chai Thai Restaurant has an all you can eat menu and live music in the evenings. 

The all you can eat option is $25.00 not including drinks. It is available between Monday and Friday from 4-10pm. The portions are smaller to allow for more sampling of food options and prevent a lot of waste. This is a great idea - especially since they stipulates to a full price charge for leftovers.

I had several of their appetizers including the Shrimp Tempura and BBQ Pork. I don't recommend the Shrimp Tempura because it was super thin and mostly tempura, but the BBQ pork was a perfect option. 

I enjoyed one of their salads called the Papaya Salad. It has shredded green papaya that is seasoned with lime juice, tomatoes, green beans, and chili. it was mediocre. 

Entrees are served with steamed rice and include items such as garlic pepper and spicy bamboo. They have several noodle options as well. The chicken Pad Thai was very good.

Since it's so late, all the pizza places are closed. My favorite wing place is a cross-town drive. What to do? Go on Yelp and sort by ""open now"" and ""delivery"" of course! 

Man am I glad I found this place. Not only do they deliver until 4am, they're delicious. 

Let me get the most important thing out of the way first: I asked for spicy food and I got spicy food. When I go to Archi's Thai, I get a 20-spicy out of a 1-to-10 scale. This place asked ""1 to 5"" and I went with a 4, being conservative with a new place. Let me tell you: I'm really glad I didn't get the 5. The 4 is legit spicy. I LOVE when I find a place that takes spicy seriously. This place takes spicy seriously. 

They also take flavor seriously. I got the Panang Curry with chicken, and the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Both were incredibly delicious. Great flavor, cooked well, good-sized portions for $10-$11 per dish. The curry is some of the best I've had.

If I had one complaint about what I ordered, it would be that the spiciness of the fried rice dish overpowered its flavor. There's a kind of spicy that just blinds you and numbs your tongue and keeps you from tasting the food you're eating; all you taste and feel is the spiciness. The curry absolutely did not have this problem, it was spicy and delicious. The fried rice started getting into this territory. I could detect that there was a lot of good flavor under that searing spiciness. Next time I'll probably bump the fried rice down to a 3-spicy instead. Giving up the flavor isn't worth the it-hurts-so-good pain of the spiciness. Having that said, I must admit I ate all of that fried rice and I still loved it.

However, the service was beyond absurd. I've been to a lot of Asian and Thai restaurants and I've been accustomed to bad service but I have never been repremanded  and disrespected to a point of not coming back even if the food in my opinion was phenomenal.

I sat down with 2 friends and ordered the duck curry, pumpkin curry and pineapple fried rice.

We wanted the fried rice to not have raisins and for the pumpkin curry to not have bell peppers.

Upon receiving our first dish, the server with the glasses that looks like a cat, serves us crab fried rice which was not our order.

 We all were polite and kindly asked her to change because we specifically said pineapple instead of fried rice. She grabs our plate and rushes off shaking her head. My friends and I look past it but when she returns, she comes with our duck curry and serves it abruptly saying  ""This is right isn't it?!? (With a pissed off face)""

That really just upset all of us because the food is so good but the service is really bringing this business down.

Now once again, we try to look past this service. But when she serves me my Thai tea as well as getting my additional small Thai tea from checking in on yelp, she repremands me making me feel like I'm fat for ordering 2 saying, ""WOW You order 2, that's alot!""

 Who are you to tell me what I can and can't order,  if I ask for 20 Thai teas, you serve me 20 teas and you can make your comments to your Co workers later about how much tea that kid got.

 It is not your place to repremand any customer!!!

4th 5th god knows how many strikes.

When we were served our pumpkin curry and pineapple fried rice, our request for no peppers and raisins were not being accounted for.

I'm not a type of guy to go out of my way to write this type of review. I'm only doing this for the owner of this restaurant to realize that the reason why your business is not succeeding is because of your servers. 

I shook your hand and told you how great your food is and I really loved the food but when servers like her with the glasses, repremands customers the way she did with me and my friends, it really makes us not want to eat there and just order take out so we don't have to deal with that.

Chef, I sincerely love your food, I would have given your restaurant 5 stars but if you do not change your management your business will continue to decline because no matter how good your food is, when service is this bad,  customers will not come back.

I'm going to come back,  but I'm never going to sit down and feel disrespected and repremanded every time that specific server with the glasses comes and serves us.

Really phenomenal food,  phenomenally bad service.

I'm giving a 3 because the food deserved a 5 but the service was mediocre and deserved less than 1.

We ordered plenty of food for lunch including dishes like shrimp and chicken basil entrees, steamed and egg fried rice, and spicy noodles. 

Everything was so tasty. We ordered everything at a ""level 3"" spice heat and we weren't expecting it to be that spicy. But that didn't make it taste any less better. In fact, I think it being so spicy made everything taste better. 

The place is very clean and pretty inside. There are cute decorations hanging from the ceiling. There's also a little stage in the front for people to sing but we went around 3 p.m. so I think the entertainment is a dinner thing. 

The staff is also extremely attentive. I didn't get the name of our waiter but he was so friendly and helpful. We were unsure of what shrimp dish we wanted to get initially and he kind of broke down his opinions and we were really happy that we took his word for the dish. He was so helpful. Literally right as I finished my water, it was filled a minute later. He was so nice!

Our bill totaled to $75 with gratuity included. We ordered 5 items, two sodas, and a Thai tea. Overall, I'm really satisfied with this place.

I am happy to report that out of all of those 3 or 4 Thai restaurants, the current incarnation is my favorite.  Right when I walked in the door I could tell that I was going to like the food here.

Feeling an unexplainable excitement for trying the food here, I ordered the Crab Rangoon ($6.99), the Crab Fried Rice ($14.99), and the green curry with beef, spicy 4/5 ($11.99).  They do have lunch specials by the way, but I ordered entrees. 

The Crab Rangoon, one of my guilty white guy pleasures, was really good.  It wasn't quite the best version of this dish, but it was a lot better than most.  The shells were deeply fried and had a nice almost baked flavor to them.  The cream cheese and imitation crab filling was offset by something, I think maybe onion.   The sauce was light and jammy tasting.  Good start.

By far my favorite dish was the Crab Fried Rice.  This featured penny size chunks of real, very tasty crab meat.  Traditionally this dish is fried with shredded crab, which is mixed into the rice and hard to visually see (you can taste and smell it though).  Thai chefs have often commented to me that Americans sometimes don't understand this, and complain that ""there is no crab"".  Khun Chai has resolved the issue by using these crab chunks instead.  But that's not all, the fried rice itself was light, fluffy, and soft.  Not greasy at all.  It was also served with big chunks of egg.  I asked for Nam Pla (fish sauce with green chili), which was salty and hada little heat from the peppers.  Lightly sprinkled on the rice, it was a perfect balance.

The beef green curry, a dish that is hard to impress, was good, but not great.  It came out with a nice soupy consistency, just like Thai curry should be.  The beef chunks were very tender, and the bamboo wasn't too firm or too soft.  The curry was definitely mostly coconut milk if not all coconut milk, and not cut with too much half and half.  It wasn't too sweet, or too pungent.  The only real flaw was that it wasn't as bold in it's flavors as I prefer my green curries to be.  I would probably skip this dish, and try the yellow or duck curry instead.  

The menu is expansive, and the staff barely speaks English.  Personally, I like that.  The food is pretty good quality, and the chef is above and beyond most of the Thai restaurants in town and definitely in this area.

However, I was pleasantly surprised they dish out great portion sizes with explosive flavors. I was also impressed with the chili tray offering a variety of freshly pickled chili that packs a spicy punch, alongside classic essentials such as powder chili and sugar. Spice levels on the dishes are ranked: 1-5 (we tried spice level 3 and the heat was right on the dot!)
 
Although the presentation & plating could use some pointers, once I took my very first bite, I knew this would be my new go-to Thai restaurant! Everything was seasoned just to our liking!

Drinks always kept full. Food was on point especially when we asked for certain dishes to be less/more spicy. Not as busy as other places which I actually like because you get their undivided attention. I will keep coming back! Thank you!,h5rC5YL85KFwZ4u7cyc-cA,1,0,5,XzmifUSJ6VJC9c4pVKFyLA
2615158,2015-07-29,7,hT86CbF0p75wKqgAEbWVrA,"This is my favorite place for late night Thai cravings and when I'm feeling under thee weather. It's in the same complex as Pool Sharks and Jjanga on S. Decatur Blvd. in between W. Twain Ave. and W. Spring Mountain Rd.

My usual soups for the soul are Tom Yum Seafood and Tom Yum Sukothai Soup. Tom Yum Seafood consists of rice noodle with shrimp, squid, fish ball, ground pork, ground peanut, and lime juice. And Tom Yum Sukothai consists of rice noodle BBQ pork, ground pork, and green bean in spicy broth. Both soups had the balance of sweet and sour, but Sukothai is spicy, unless you request otherwise. I took the leftovers home and heated it up the next day. It was still as good as being in the restaurant or I could even say it's more delicious. The flavor was there and it tastes like home. Tom Yum is known to help cure colds due its potent combination of herbs and spices. If I'm extremely unbalanced, I'll ask for some minced garlic and lemongrass to be added to the soup. So soothing and the deep-seated flavors in this soup makes me regain my appetite even from smelling the aromas! Nummy!!!

One time I broke free from a high fever and regained my appetite, which was around 3:30am! With the help of Yelp, I found this Thai restaurant that.. not only opened late, but delivers as well!!! Yaaaaaaaay! I ordered two soups.. I was starrrrrrrving and actually finished both that night. I felt like a savage person, tearing apart my soup and having the broth drip all over my chin. So sexy, I know! Even my dogs looked worried as I devoured my meal within a few minutes. The delivery was quick and neatly packed. I ordered from EAT24. I apologized for ordering so late, but the delivery man was pleasantly happy to do so and kept a smile on his face the whole time. Nice :) I didn't feel so bad after that. 

All the times I have dined here and ordered for delivery, the service was polite and attentive. The young gentleman with black frame glasses is kind and sweet. When I was leaving the Chef came out and said thank you, good night. 

They have a few specials like E-San Classics where you choose two food items from a list, comes with appetizer, soup, salad, and steamed or sticky rice for $10.99 ;) I'm planning on trying that on my next visit!

This restaurant has free Karaoke after 10pm, free wi-fi, online ordering (last call for delivery is 3:50a.m.) and live music nightly. The host/dj was singing some of my favorite 80's, 90's music. I was swaying my head side to side while eating and enjoying the entertainment. 

I'm a huge fan of this place especially satisfying my late night food calls for Thai ;) Their food that makes me say mmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,10,7,5,inwh2ck-oRHC5gtIWYuG_A

I came here with my boyfriend around 11 pm and there was no one else eating but once we finished our meal there were a good amount of other diners. 

When we walked in, we were seated right away and given our menus. We ordered our waters and received them quickly. We ordered the papaya salad at a level 5 (out of 5) spicy, beef salad at level 5, Pad Kee Mao with seafood combo at level 5, Pad Thai with shrimp (I don't think they have spice level for this, it is just not spicy), and sticky rice. 

The papaya salad was bright, crispy, and fresh. Not very fish saucey, it had lots of lime flavor. It was a good amount of spicy to me. It came with fresh cabbage on the side and is the best with the sticky rice.

I did not like the beef salad at all. It was very sweet... weird. I took two bites (the second one to make sure I didn't like it, of course). 

The Pad Kee Mao was VERY spicy! Yay! But it was overly salty and left that bad flavor in the back of my throat. 

The Pad Thai with shrimp was really tasty. I liked the flavor and the crispy veggies, the shrimp was over cooked and dry though. 

The portions are HUGE. I felt like I ate so much but when I was full I barely made a dent in the Pad Thai. My boyfriend ate so much of his Pad Kee Mao and made JUST a dent, lol. So it is worth the price for how much food you get.

We also got the complimentary shrimp tempura and egg roll for Yelp check in! The tempura was yummy, crispy and not too greasy. The egg roll was ok, it's vegetarian lol and it wasn't very crispy. 

The food came out very quickly after we ordered. Very fast kitchen! Everything came out when it was ready, not in any certain order. That was fine with us! 

They don't have any chicken wings for an appetizer, which kind of sucks because we were looking for chicken wings instead of the beef salad. 

When we asked for a box for our food, the waitress seemed upset with how much food we didn't eat and she carelessly threw the food in the boxes, she tied the bag up and the top was open still on the box and food pouring out the sides. I noticed right away luckily and shut it before it spilled all over my car! 

The food wasn't bad, the service was very attentive and quick but only semi-friendly. The interior is superior to a lot of the other Thai restaurants but nothing else is so... next time I have a craving for Thai food, I know a FEW other places I'd rather go than here.",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,1,1,2,2F9_BXvGAyh8FSYiUOBH9g

Second, i don't understand why a thai food restaurant offers lots of Chinese food in the menu. And the restaurant is just couple minutes from the china town. I came to eat the thai food. Want the Thai food.


Third, the food is good, but couldn't find the feel that was in toronto thai restaurant. Coconut is always my favourite.

First impression was great.  The place is pacious, cozy, clean with no stench of grease or spices that usually present in Thai restaurants. 

Menu selections are extensive with emphasis on noodles and riced dishes.  We opted for Pad Se Ew and Grilled Pork Salad.  When food arrived we were surprised with how generous the portions were and more importantly the looked so freshly prepared.  After the first bite, we got blown away of how wonderful the chef had done with these two simple dishes.  The pork in the salad was grilled to perfection.  The vegetables were fresh and crispy.  The overall taste was nicely balanced.  It was something that each bite was better than the last.  The pad se ew was amazing.  The noodle was fried so it was translucent with a hint of smokiness but not burnt.  The vegetables are done yet still crunchy and sweet.  It had to be one of the best noodle dishes I had had in a long time.

One suggestion to the chef, get rid of that nonsense condiments on the table.  Your customers don't need them!  Your food was very well seasoned out of the kitchen.

We went around noon and it was pretty dead. Honestly I don't mind it because my food is faster and service is better. My server was very sweet. Very respectful. She explained the lunch 7.99 specials after I asked if there were any. I checked in on Yelp and received a free shrimp tempura and a free spring roll. Great check in reward.

I got the lunch special that came with a salad, soup and entree of choice. Drink not included. $7.99 is a great deal and we got more then enough food I took some home even. The salad came out fast. Basic house salad with carrots cucumbers and cucumber dressing. You can also get other dressings like peanut and ranch.

The soup came out fast too. It was a cucumber cilantro soup. I was skeptical at first due to the potent smell of cilantro steaming off the soup. Surprisingly when I tasted it, the taste was a little bit more subtle than the smell. Still a little too much cilantro but the juiciness of the cucumbers were refreshing in a hot soup.

I then had the Pad Thai. I love Pad Thai so I always like seeing how different places make it. I added chicken as my protein. Surprised it came out with out peanuts.......never had that happen once. They quickly brought me some. Also no cilantro on the pad Thai, you would think with that soup they wouldn't be so stingy with it on other dishes.
I didn't want to bother the waitress again for cilantro. Still good tasting pad Thai. The noodles stuck together a little too much. So we know they are pre portioned. It's eaten like spaghetti but I couldn't because the noodles were all lumped together. Again I'm just super picky on pad Thai. It was still great though.

Manager I assume came to clear the table and drop/run the check. Even though my server clearly wasn't busy. A manager introduction would have been more formal. But hey at least she was helping and not just in the back!

I would recommend the Seafood Glass Noodles, Grilled Squid, Pineapple fried rice, Panang chicken curry, Beef Pad See Ew.

Every time I've been there have never been more than one or two other tables occupied, sometimes none, but the food has always been good every time. Also they sometimes have a guy who sings oldies but goodies which is nice.

We ordered the chicken satay, the duck curry, the pumpkin curry, a salad, and a catfish dish. The chicken satay was great. I loved the peanut sauce and how tender the chicken was. The salad was a little bit too salty for my taste, and I expected the duck curry to be a bit bigger and to contain more pieces of duck, but else than that, the entrees were delicious. They came with two bowls of rice.

And there is live music! We got somewhat of a private performance since we were the only guests in the restaurant at that time, and I enjoyed every second of it. When the singer first came out, I assumed he would be singing traditional Thai songs throughout our stay, but he actually sang modern English songs like ""All of Me"" by John Legend, as well. (According to my brother, he also sings Spanish songs. What?)  

This is not the cheapest Thai food in Vegas, but considering how their seats are super comfortable and spacious and how they hire someone to sing live music throughout your stay, the prices aren't unreasonable. The portion sizes aside from the duck curry were fine.

The staff is always friendly and attentive. After certain hours they have a couple guys singing and playing instruments, very mellow and sounds really good! I always end up leaving them a tip!

The Thai tea is probably the best I've had so far in Vegas restaurants. Not too sweet. Still had that bitter tea taste to it. 

We both ordered NS7 which was the combination noodle w beef stew, tendon and beef balls. Not a Thai dish but figured I'd try it since simple enough BUT I did not like it all. It was VERY SWEET. The soup was so sweet and w all the ingredients in the soup, it made even sweeter. I tried to add a lot of hot sauce but it didn't cut down the sweetness. I was quite disappointed.

She got on the phone, I gave her my address and then without addressing me she begins speaking her native language to a man speaking back with her. They spoke for so long, and I could hear them....I new what they were discussing ""Should or shouldn't we deliver there"". Which is fine to discuss, but then she asks me what I would like to order so I give my order and instead of speaking to me she once again started talking to the man in their native language.....just to come back and tell me ""Oh I have to call the driver because your too far"". I informed her that their website advertises up to 8miles and I double checked on the maps I am only 7 miles...and again she speaks to the man, and then rushes back on the phone to say she needs to ask the drivers again. I already new this was a fake answer, and she wasn't going to call anyone because it was obvious how lazy they must be there that a delivery even took that much discussion.

When ordering from a new place, I usually try the basics first to see how they compare. The first time we ordered the pad kee Mao spicy noodles with chicken. I usually avoid this dish as it's generally greasy and lack luster. Hands down the best I've ever tried. We also tried the pepper garlic beef and ginger shrimp, both were also outstanding. 

The vegetables are all cooked to perfection and the sauces are made with extreme care and attention to detail. One of my favorite thai dishes is the nam sod salad (ground pork with chili peanuts, red onion and a tart bright sauce made with fish sauce and other delicious stuff served with cabbage cups). Theirs is good but not the best I've ever had. 

The real winner here, which will keep me ordering from this place at least once a week, is the yellow curry noodle soup. This dish is probably my new favorite thai dish. Period. It's like perfect combination between a thick yellow curry and tom kha soup, served with green onions, bean sprouts, soft boiled egg, fried shallots and a protein. With chicken its epic and generally I'm not a chicken fan. It's served with rice noodles but I substitute thin egg noodles.

4842567,2015-05-10,0,hT86CbF0p75wKqgAEbWVrA,"The one star goes to the pleasant and attentive waitress, she was lovely. 

Your mileage may vary, but on my visit to Khun Chai almost nothing was fresh.

Crab fried rice with real crab sounds delicious. If you love fresh crab this may catch your eye like it did mine. Here it's made from low quality canned crab that tastes fishy and slightly sour instead of sweet. It has a granular, stringy texture from overcooking instead of a soft luscious texture one would expect from fresh crab. The fried rice underneath was marginal, not bad but definitely not good enough to save this dish. The only redeeming factor was a sprinkle of fresh cilantro on top, probably the only fresh ingredient on our table.

Next up, Pad Se Ew noodles. The rice noodles themselves were cooked perfectly. Unfortunately frozen crinkle cut carrots (yes, really) and frozen broccoli are added to the nice noodles. It's all drenched in a sauce that is flavored by very little other than sugar. Edible but just barely.

After trying to swallow a few more bites of the crab fried rice, the sour taste of the crab became overwhelming. It was clear that this canned crab had sat out too long and was on the verge of spoiling. No one at our table could eat it. It was sent back. After our lovely waitress took it away and disappeared into the kitchen, the chef could be heard yelling at the poor girl for several minutes. She emerged still carrying the dish we hoped never to see again, brought it back to our table. Obliged to explain that the crab did not taste fresh because it was canned, she looked at us apologetically and asked if we could try it again. We told her ""no really, we do not want it"". This time the chef yelled at her even louder. I felt bad for her. I made two decisions while the chef carried on yelling. First that I would leave a very generous tip for her troubles and second that I would not be eating at this place again.

The ""chef"" here puts his name and photo on the front of the building as if it means something, then serves sour canned crab and frozen vegetables. Yelling at the poor waitress for his own mistakes within earshot of the customers hardly seems professional.

The prices here are above average, the quality of the food is way below average. Save yourself the trouble and skip this place.

When the dish arrived, it was large enough to feed two and there were at least ten thumb sized shrimp.  It was tasty, and although in my experience, most Thai food is quite spicy this was without any heat.

She was very annoyed and said you ordered dinner, I explained that was ONLY because we didn't know they had lunch and we were sat with the WRONG menu. About 20 minutes later she brought my food, only one when we were only a party of 2. She said it took so long bc they had already made a dinner portion, the curry had great flavor but was cold and no spice when I ordered a 5!  My iced tea was empty at this point. She proceeded to take other people's orders, bring out water, etc. I was halfway done with my meal when we had to ask if the person I was with was even going to get food at all, I don't dare ask for a refill because it is clearly too much for someone that cannot keep up as it is. When she brought her food she said once again it was bc we ordered dinner like it was OUR fault she gave us the wrong menu. We took our food to go and left so we could come home and heat it up.

- I ordered the Appetizer Sampler and Beef Massaman Curry with no rice (I try to avoid carbs but am still pretty bad at adhering to Paleo when eating out).   The waiter brought me Pad Thai Combo and Pork Massaman with a side of rice.  So my order was totally messed up but that actually made me feel like I was back in Thailand (over there messing up a tourist's orders is pretty common at mom & pop joints).  I'm not a picky eater (I did go from craving AYCE sushi to a Thai place) so I went with it.  Their Massaman's wasn't as good as Le Thai's, but still tasty.  Pad Thai seemed authentic and the Thai Tea had the right amount of light sweetness.  Eggrolls were ok.
- With the glasses of water (waiter was good at topping it off), free Thai Tea  and Eggrolls, I could only eat 1/2 of the Pad Thai and Curry.   Also, they had a 3-person band performing Thai songs, a nice touch.
- Will be back, probably during lunch time.  If Khun Chai is reading this I suggest the waiter/servers, instead of just remembering the order, to write down the order and repeat the order to the customer so both parties are on the same page.  Also, ask the customer what level of spiciness s/he wants (my waiter didn't ask me, I forgot to mention it, my dishes turned out to be mild-spicy which was fine).",0nqshyLgABOSyTfJUTthjQ,3,3,5,5NngHdxOC-h96t_if5FwyA

I would definitely come here again but maybe for happy hour because it was a little pricey.

5318610,2015-06-19,4,hT86CbF0p75wKqgAEbWVrA,"It's good but you have to pick the right menu items. Some they execute better than other Thai restaurants and some they don't.

The interior looks bizarre. Like somebody made a trip to the community garage sale to buy some stuff that might make sense separately but together? Not really. Stage for karaoke + Christmas tree lights + sparkly hearts + license plates on the wall + Home Sweet Home wall decor + Bob Marley. If you think about it, it's genius! You don't have to change decors for certain holidays. Christmas, Valentine's Day, 3-11 Day, etc - they celebrate everything everyday.

The place was empty when we came here for dinner. We got free egg rolls and a small Thai iced tea for checking in on Yelp. Their spicy scale is from 1-5 and 3 was pretty spicy. My eyeballs and pretty much my entire head were sweating uncontrollably.

Tom Yum Soup:
Tom Yum with chicken and mushrooms. A little salty, citrusy, sweet then the spiciness punches your taste buds. It's a little sweeter than what I'm used to. 3/5

Nam Tok Beef:
Salad with lettuce, roasted rice powder, grilled beef, mint, chili and lime juice. Great flavors: the acidity intensifies the heat from the chili. Spicy level 3 but felt way spicier than that. 4/5

Combination Pad Thai:
This had the same issue as the Tom Yum soup. It's sweeter than what I'm used to. 3/5

Beef Panang:
Creamy curry and coconut sauce. They're not too generous with the beef but it was still good. 3/5

Sweet Sticky Rice with Mangoes:
Cute presentation. They look like sushi. The rice is perfectly cooked. Soft and it absorbs the coconut milk. The best version I've had. 5/5

Thai Tea Ice Cream:
Generous portion and has sprinkles on top. I hate sprinkles but I love Thai tea ice cream so much. 4/5

We also tried the grilled squid and fried rice. Too much food!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,9,4,_95tMftJnuq80ASrpgU39w

We got to Khun Chai Thai and it wasn't very busy. It was pretty empty actually. The server was really nice but also really timid and awkward. The food looked and tasted really good. My only complaint was that medium spiciness was too hot. I'm from the Caribbean and I love my pepper but the heat was a bit too much for my pad kee mao.

Food was great, we had the Pad Thai with chicken breast, Spicy basil with ground chicken and Garlic Shrimp. but I think when you choose your stars, 1-5 you should choose one lower than normal. We chose a 3 and it was more like a four.

I had looked at many menus to find both a reasonable price and a dish that I would like to try. This restaurant fit the bill. They have lunch specials for $7, which is a fairly good deal considering you get a salad and an egg roll with your meal. I tried their pad Kee Mao , and it was just all right. It took them a very long time to get the food ready for my to-go order, approximately 25 minutes. I had asked for my noodles to be a level 4 in spiciness, but they weren't all that spicy. The egg roll was the best part of the meal,  it was  hot and fresh . The food wasn't bad by any means but it's nothing I would go out of my way to eat again , especially with the vast number of Asian food restaurants in the Vegas area.",d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg,2,1,3,jQspM0rG_cx3uCw4gBqynA

The chef is friendly and will take back the food if it's served too spicy. We got a spice level of a 1 and even that was wayyyyy too spicy for me.

We got-

Tom yum- so good- shrimp is so tasty
Pad Thai with chicken- pretty good
Yellow curry with chicken- not bad but not the best.


The Thai tea is SO SO SO good. I would go back just for that.

All in all good! Only downer is that at Pam real Thai the bill would've been $30 and here it was $50",a_BQ_QBRvVVmwPxrS4tJPA,0,0,4,Yv7TaOvpbZgOJxfn_SVN7w

This place makes really authentic tasting dishes can't go wrong with any of their choices.  The service was so-so.  After bringing out our food the server disappeared in the back.

If you want authentic Thai food, this is the place to come.
I judge Thai food based on how well they make Larb since not all chef make this food delicious.  

I have tried larb with spicy being 3... (they have range 1 to 5 but still 3 is very spicy... I wonder how spicy 5 is..  just don't want to think about it..).  Unlike other Thai restaurant, plenty of food and mixture of basil and mint.. just made it so good.  I ate this for lunch and I love it so much now I am back for dinner.

As for the rest of the meal:  Pad thai, the old stand-by, was not my las vegas favorite and ended up absorbing so much of the sauce as to become somewhat dry-ish near the end.  That being said, the Pad woon sen was AWESOME.  My horizons have been expanded.  The plate was like a stir-fry adventure.  TONS of shrimp (rare for Thai places around here,) amazing noodles, and lots of nicely cooked veg.

Ambiance: weird, karaoke-stadium decor.  whatever.  they're open super late, and give freebies for yelp checkins.

The food itself was amazing, however, they forgot our thai ice tea! This sucks! With all of the savory foods that the two of us ordered, we need a sweet refreshing beverage which they forgot to load from the restaurant. We ended up getting a refund for it. Which was awful.
