As I waited I seen an employee at the meat section hand a customer a small item in a little plastic bag. The customer put it in her left pocket and had 2 cigars sticking out the right pocket. She gave him some money and he pulled out a stack of money from his pocket and put it together.
I was a little confused but so sure I just witnessed a drug transaction at Marios westside market!!
My husband came back just in time to order. I asked what took so long he said there was no bathrooms in there and they had to go to Cvs next door. 
Luckily just as we were going to order the guy behind the counter said he was going to get us some fresh fish! Okkky now 
We got the fish which isn't really catfish just another type of fish he said. They did have a big tail and I told my husband that was the catfish and I was right lol...they also had what he said was fish steak WTH. The wings we got also which he said were mild so our kids loved them. The sides were awesome. Mac and cheese, green beans and the cabbage which is what I was really craving was bland as heck. I was so hungry I ate it without seasoning tho. 
Oh and my husband got the neck bones which are pretty expensive half a bound was 4 dollars. 
Plan on spending at least $20 or more if you have a family to feed. Everything goes by the pound expect the sides. I will be back to the hood market even tho there was a drug transaction right in front of everyone lol. I will just keep my man close and my children closer!",vylODf2LO1xgAT6UjYpOVw,2,1,3,nzVGVRqkt92t6jp_O65gaw

Again it could be I was just there at the wrong time......although I feel a good quality place should have good quality food 24-7?! I also had the mac and cheese which was just an epic fail altogether and extremely bland potato salad. The cornbread muffin was burnt and dry.

573741,2016-08-21,1,mOaHJZYTsgB0G_TIKykFAA,"It was not worth it. First, this side of town is definitely not my favorite. I was clearly stepping out of my comfort zone because everyone has created such a big deal about this catfish. And finding a parking spot was a hassle as there are very few and they are all super tight, so I just parked in front of the CVS. When I get out of my car I'm harassed by Jehovah Witnesses, but that is kind of typical on this side of town. Inside the market it was a little confusing finding the ready to eat food section, as the check stands go right up to the entrance (probably to prevent theft) and the initial smell of the market is gut wrenching. At the counter I order a pound of catfish and two hot links and it comes out to $10 and some change. I chose to take my food home because I was not going to stay in that market any longer. The smell alone made me wonder if my food was even safe. On to the important part, the taste. The catfish was just all right. It was nothing too exciting or special, I can get faster service and better fish at hush puppies and H&H. The hot links though were what really disappointed me. They were not hot. At all. I have never had such weak sauce hot links in my life, Walmart has better ones. All in all going to this side of town into a grimy little hole in the wall was not worth the food, and I'm just not seeing the hype.",-Q2RjGHUw0dDixtL3OV2Ig,1,0,2,8lSyP2ZFuPug7jKRSqcMkw

I was excited to hear of this place as I just recently moved here from Houston and heard they sold many of the items that are not available at your mainstream grocery chains.  Inasmuch as that is the case, the way I was treated was right out of a 1920's movie.  The ""gentleman"" at the hot food service bar refused to serve me, although I ordered the same thing as the person in front of me and the person behind me (catfish po boy).  They were served, but I was told that they didn't have anything for me.  I asked what was available and I was told nothing that I wanted.....WOW.  So I went ahead and gathered the grocery items that I wanted to purchase and headed for the checkout, there were only two.  When I set my items down at the first register, I was told that lane was ""closed"".  The young man in lane two offered to ring up my items (and I appreciate that). I headed for the door only to be blocked by a group of ""patrons"". After saying ""Excuse Me"" several times and trying to leave, I finally had to nudge my way through the group (while still saying ""excuse me"") only to be told ""get your white a$$ in your car before we beat the f*** out of you"".  REALLY?

To say the least, I won't be back.  It is unfortunate, as I could care less about the color of one's skin and I genuinely like their selection, but obviously color of skin is a high priority with this location. It is sad that this is where we are, just sad.",lEj4JoOMzV_klmX8vz02Ig,7,0,1,bWyderpXKQmmSlzcAMe-mw

the location is tucked away in the back of a supermarket would never known it was there but im glad i got a recomendation! ""it changed my life!, in a good way""
I came Saturday  9/17 around 12 or so. rather busy. but the people behind the food cases were working hard an very focused on work. being direct as well as courteous. the line starts by the hot food cases they got lil roping stuff people were standing there its obvious where to stand. an there are 2 gentleman working the line getting mac an cheese the catfish an weighing it out using from what i could see proper sanitation, plastic gloves an changing the gloves. 
I noticed while weighing it out its difficult cuz some of the catfish goes over so like if you want a pound sometimes you gotta get a lil more that or theyll pull random pieces out so you can have exactly a pound. I understand if you are working with a certain budget. I didnt care the cat fish looked so good i knew i was going to eat it all either way might as well throw the extra weight. once you get your stuff weighed out then they put it like on the top of the case an you slide that over to the cashier an they ring you up an take your payment, you can also ask for beverages there too! I noticed they had KoolAid on a tap thats lovely! 
the woman that was behind the cash register was very nice woman easy to talk to asked me what i was about to get into the rest of the day. so it wasn't just like give me the money an leave. good atmosphere i enjoyed it everybody was super nice !

I got a pound of catfish and 16 OZ's of mac an cheese!  
first of all the catfish great seasoning on the crust outside of the fish, the inside warm moist an flakey just the way it should be. good seasoning with the crisp! 
i dont mean to be rude but the real star of the show was the dang mac n cheese. honestly i came for the catfish but in the mean time i fell in love with the mac n cheese. the noodle basic macaronni noodle but the amount of cheese in the mac n cheese, like you scoop a noodle an get mad string of cheese falling the one hand swipe didnt work its like its cheesenoodle friends were tryna pull it off the fork great noodle cheese ratio it was the star for me! i will be coming back , I wanna try the ribs with MAc N CHEESE!",ikT2G70jwxXiBLgPymiBXA,2,1,5,2k1-bO6aykYrEnAsS9dngw

The sides is whats its all about for me. Lets break it down starting with my favorite.

Green beans- The green beans are bangin for real. They are mixed with slices of soft potato (im pretty sure its potato). They are seasoned so well and as many times as I have eaten them I cant guess what they are using. I typically get a medium size and will take them home if I cant finish.

Mac and cheese- Hella cheese with some macaroni mixed in. I mean Hella cheesey! The pasta is usually a little soft but I really like this side. 

Sweet potato- two kinds to choose from. The cubed sweet potato simmered down in the standard briwn sugar and cinnamon is my guess and they are good but the casserole is what I go for. The caserole has a heavy dose of coconut in it and I really like it. They sprinkle some crunchies on top lime candied pecans or something. Very sweet and delicous.

Greens- the greens are good. The greens are not over cooked and have a nice bite to them with that little bitter flavor rolling off the back of the tounge that I enjoy. I really like the greens to clease the pallet before I stuff for more in my face. 

These are the only sides i have tried and I will be hard pressed to break routine. 

I only stop here if its before 1130 because the line starts to build up.

Being from south Texas, it's been hard to find southern-style gulf seafood, but Mario does catfish right. The batter is light and full of flavor, you won't even miss the tartar sauce and the hot sauce is entirely optional. Sides of mac and greens taste like they were made with someone's grandma's recipe, they're that good. 

Location is a bit odd- head in anyway, and hang a left to  the back of the store. If there's a line (and there will be), suck it up and wait. Buy by the pound or purchase a meal, but don't go without getting catfish. They also offer chicken tenders, wings, and a bunch of other sides, but it's probably best to stick to the basics before branching out.

Eat in at their small dine-in area by the coolers of sodas, or grab yours to go- if it's too far from home, you can always take it to the nearby Lorenzi park. You'll need to break a sweat after eating this kind of meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,14,4,OGkA5wWxWeK7nTkrS26DEA

The business reminds me of a Mom and Pop corner grocery, with a meat/butcher department and a take-out counter. Also some tables for those wanting to eat inside.

I usually get the catfish meal, that comes with 2 sides and a drink for $9.99. Sides include mac and cheese, yams, collard greens etc. The meal comes with white bread, and make sure to ask for hot sauce. The market itself is dingy, so I have always gotten my food to go, but you are able to sit down and eat inside if you wish. If you are in the area I suggest you check this place out.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,0,4,RJhpzCkZ1sgGkhcMJFrZ9w

We decided to sneak out during lunch and headed to Mario's.  This is your typical deli type style.

There is a line inside to order food.  Service is quickness is decent and the portion prices are fair.  Paying is quick since everyone has to pay up front.  

The catfish is excellent.  Deep fried and not so much batter.  I do wish that I had gotten some kind of dipping sauce to make it amazing.  We also picked up some pieces of fried pork chops.  It got a little soggy after I got back to my office, but still bomb.  Pork chop seasoning was minimal and doesn't leave you thirsty.  The pork itself does feel a bit over cooked hence the massive chewing I had to do.  

I def come back since I took a look their items and some of them made me curious.  And I'll have to get some of that Kool-Aid.",yobIvoK2taIhooUPSrjuiQ,2,1,5,EZ4nlIF1ROJw03awZfkW_w

The gentleman fixing my order didn't know what kind of beans they were either.  SMH ...  I should have just left after that bad sign. I get my food home and I had three small dried out pieces of fish and the sides were tasteless. I hate to waste food but unfortunately this time I had to. I tossed it in the trash. What a waste of my time, money and gas. 
Also, can you please get a new glass for your steam table. The one you have now is so scratched up that a person can barely see what dishes are being offered behind it. 
Then I get to the counter to pay and the lady is busy talking to another employee and writing something. I stood there for almost 4 mins.

The lady made it fresh for me which I appreciated but I would have loved for it to be at least decent. I took a few bites of everything and threw the entire meal in the trash. I was so disappointed! Zero stars for the food!

The market is why I gave it 3 stars. It has a lot of black staples. They have all the creole seasonings, smoked meats, a big meat counter, and no veggies in sight....exactly how black people cook. There is also check cashing and a actual liquor store inside! I chuckled at how stereotypical this whole set up was. They even serve two types of kool-aid with the food! My mom even saw a syrup they served from her childhood so the market definitely caters to their target market. 

I asked the lady behind the check cashing counter if this was a black owned store and she said it used to be but it was recently sold so not anymore. She made it a point to tell me how even though he's not black he grew up around black people. As if that's supposed to matter or make any difference as to why an all black store is not even ran by black people.

Not only will you find specialty products from the south, an expansive butcher section (check out those BBQ combo deals), but a full service hot food deli counter!  This is where Mario's excels.  And it excels in spades.

Don't wanna shop here?  Then don't.  But do not, I repeat DO NOT deprive yourself of the opportunity to get some quality hot vittles for you to take home.  DO NOT leave Mario's without a box (or 2 or 3) of their signature Fried Catfish!  It really is what I consider the best on this side of town!  And I've eaten a lot of fried catfish.  What the Hell do you do to it, Mario?  It is some of the flakiest, lightest, freshest, most flavorful catfish I've ever had.  The recipe is probably so complicated...that it's actually really simple.  WTF is the secret, Mario??  Well whatever it is please keep making that catfish!

The Fried Catfish is the star here.  Combo it with some of their macaroni & cheese, collard greens, pigs feet (really this is good stuff), or black-eyed peas...and add a few slices of white bread & Mario's own blend of hot sauce?  Soul Food heaven I say!  I don't care about carbs, I don't care about fat, I don't care about salt.  When you come to Mario's you come for down home flavor!  Oh just thinking about that catfish now is making me hangry.

Honestly I couldn't tell you how much the catfish or any of the other items actually cost.  All I do is point at the Fried Catfish and say, ""2 pounds"" or ""3 pounds"".  Then point to a small, medium, or large white styrofoam container and say, ""Greens"" or ""Mac & cheese"".  Then I ask for white bread, hot sauce, and tartar sauce.  And if I'm really feelin' the sweet tooth, I'll get a cup of KOOL-AID!  It's really that simple!  Then they proceed to ring you up and have you on your merry way!  Our average check is between $20 - $30 everytime mostly depending on how much catfish we buy.  But this food will easily feed 3 of us!

Tip?  You be nice to the folks making your Fried Catfish to go!  If you're friendly and ask for a pound of catfish, you might get an extra piece or 2!  If you're a regular?  Sometimes your box will be weighed and priced FIRST, then you will get more than a few extra pieces!  So do the right thing...be nice!  I see more Fried Catfish in your future!

4092833,2012-01-30,4,mOaHJZYTsgB0G_TIKykFAA,"Best catfish in Las Vegas.  hands down.   So good, it'll make your eyes roll into the back of your head... add hot sauce.  Seriously fabulous.

My favorite guide and old school Las Vegan took me here today - and she'd just found it last week - had been dying to get back as soon as possible - with me in tow!   Sides/veggies apparently change daily...today's star:  sweet potatoes -  I actually don't really like them much, but these added a welcomed sweetness.

What makes this place really cool is that it's in the back of a grocery store - up against the meat counter.  Be prepared to stand in line - apparently it gets long - so best to come early.   Once you get your food, you go back up to the front of the store to pay for it,  then if you wan to eat it now (trust me, you do!) go back to the tables back at the meat counter, take a seat (if you're lucky - since there are only 3 tables...) and eat.   Do not wrap it all up and drive -- the steam in the styrofoam will make all that makes this fish perfect die.   Just sit down, shut up and eat.  And don't forget the hot sauce.  

Anybody who thinks this place isn't safe is a fool -- I've never felt safer.   

One other tip:  tip -- and be generous.  If you're like me, you'll want to hug the cook!",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,8,2,5,z01b-Th7E7IRBDNx2kuQQg

Once I made it to the front of the line I ordered the Catfish lunch special with macaroni and cheese and fried cabbage as my too sides.  the food was outstanding and tasted similar to my mother's home cooked meals.

Cutting to the chase, Mario's serves the best catfish in Vegas. It's about $8 per pound and worth every penny. The fish is perfectly flaky inside the breading, while the breading isn't overly crunchy or distracting from the catfish.

I mean it's just delectable! I can probably eat it everyday. I had some yesterday, I've had my share today and I probably go tomorrow too, for the record.

I've also tried the wings. They were cool. I mean I've had better, I've had worse. I wouldn't brag about them but I wouldn't tell anyone not to try them either. I would probably order them again, just to satisfy a quick chicken craving. I wouldn't travel across town to order them specifically though.

The Mac&Cheese is good to me. It was prefect yesterday, but I had to add salt and pepper today. When I added the seasoning, it tasted better than any I've had recently. I enjoy how cheesy it was. I also like that the macaroni isn't over cooked. Oh, let me mention that it did taste like boiled water today. It wasn't an extremely bad taste, but just a little weird. I would definitely order it again though.

The Sweet Potatoes were mouthwatering. They reminded me of an ol Thanksgiving dinner from my childhood, except in my childhood, they were sweeter. They didn't give me enough of them, but from what they did give me, I could tell that I was hooked. I will make sure I get a medium or large when I do go back.

I had initially heard of this place through friends and coworkers and was strongly recommended. All I ever heard about this place is that the catfish was to die for. A friend from work offered some to me on one occasion and though it was a bit cold when I tasted it, the crunchiness and flavor of it was so amazing. I needed to try it fresh, and soon!

I decided to go a couple of weeks later, and though it may not be in the best location it is completely worth going to! The line was a bit long when I arrived but moved fairly quickly. I decided to get 4 catfish filets and a side of hush puppies (an order has 8). I took it home, open it up and inhaled that delicious steam that rose from the box, this alone made my mouth water. The crunch on the filets wad that of fried chicken but not heavy or greasy. Still very delicate and light. A small drizzle of lemon or hot sauce is honestly all you need as you want to taste the freshness of this fish. On to the hush puppies which was the reason I did not give this place 5 stars. When I first bit into one I noticed that it was spongy. A spongy feeling that happens when things have been reheated a few times. Seasoning and flavoring was there but not freshness. 

Marios is a great local gem that everyone is Las Vegas needs to visit at least once. The cooks definitely know what they are doing with their fish.",AQ0NRRasg_FA403S5gKEDA,9,2,4,1H7_mZlRH1JuutrKL6ugoQ

It's too many workers in the back of the store for this store not to be cleaned properly. I didn't bother to try the food because the store isn't very clean. They got to do better. The cashiers job is not to just ring people up but to keep the surrounding areas cleaned and replenished! That means removing outdated and damaged goods! It takes less than five minutes to do this! It should be done whenever customers aren't being rung up! Bleach wipes are key to dusting the areas! On a positive note the guys in the food/butcher area appears to be keeping that area cleaned and the food appears fresh and smelled delicious! But remember first impressions are everything and that starts at the front door!,LdS7cDvOoCml4U_W5ASBkw,2,0,1,OFFw3--lhLTpYrUNqfG4zw
5204605,2013-04-02,3,mOaHJZYTsgB0G_TIKykFAA,"I'm very confused about the glowing reviews for this place. My experience here was terrible. So I come around 7:30pm on a Thursday night to get some southern soul food like I remember from my childhood. After all I grew up all over the south including Louisiana, Georgia, and South Carolina.

So I go to the back where the prepared food is and there are two people in front of me. I figure there should be no problem getting some food and being out of there in time to pick my girlfriend up from yoga at 8pm. The line is moving at a snails pace and 10 minutes in I'm starting to worry. I really want to try this famed fried catfish I've read in these reviews. Around 20 minutes in I finally get to place my order for some catfish and fried okra (it's been forever since I've had some and I love it). I end up waiting a total time of nearly an hour and give up on the okra because somehow that was forgotten from my huge order of... two items. So I figured I'll just grab some macaroni salad that they had pre made and head out since I was supposed to pick my girlfriend up nearly half an hour ago.

So we finally sit down to eat the food I brought back hoping that it makes up for the wait. I figure it might have been an off night, but if the food's tasty I'm willing to give it a pass. No such luck! The catfish is terrible. It's most definitely frozen catfish that they have tried to mask the flavor and texture of with the breading to no avail. The macaroni salad tastes like they thought it was supposed to be a dessert, so they piled on the sugar.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,7,2,1,9SOYB6IJ5B9WOcRRJv0dkA

Never tasted anything like it before to be honest. This past weekend my Mom and I went to get some. We drove 20 miles to get some and it was again delicious. Location isn't the best, parking was not the best either however the fried swai fish was worth it. Staff was pleasant and helpful too.",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,1,0,4,ustas0nqMN9QwWkFzsjW0Q
5367392,2018-05-25,0,mOaHJZYTsgB0G_TIKykFAA,"Mario's is my office's go-to place for a quick lunch. Over the past few years, Mario's has been making improvements to its hot food line, ordering process, and dining area. They have an app and a website where you can pre-order your food items and pick it up instead of waiting in line. I've tried it once with success but have had coworkers tell me it didn't work well for them. The newly expanded dining area is clean and much more spacious than before, with a few more tables and chairs to sit and enjoy your hot meal. 

Speaking of the meals, the food here is always so tasty and very consistent in quality. The fried fish is my favorite item and I always eat it with lots of Mario's own in-house hot sauce. You can order any of the fried meats by the pound or you can get them in a combo meal. They have $6 lunch specials or they have the dinner combos, which offer more food for just a little more moola. The sides are also really delicious and full of flavor. The daily menu may vary but they typically have greens or green beans, Mac and cheese, dirty rice, and, sometimes, candied yams. The greens and green beans are my fave, especially with some of that Mario's hot sauce drizzled on top. 

Lunch time is always super busy and the lines can get long so either come a little early, before lunchtime, or wait for awhile after the lunch rush clears out.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,0,1,4,aiw3txuTztiHZF1fDbjLFA

I have only ever ordered the fried catfish when it comes to the meat but I have tried the sides and the Mac and cheese is definitely one of my favorites. This catfish is sooooo good though!! I have told a few friends about it and now anyone who visits me in Vegas wants to come by here for the catfish!,0GTanD35lGadNgiDp_a8cQ,0,0,5,tIiSMg-zPa3rZsfRGVkkag

The fried catfish by the lb and individual Jolly Ranchers & Lemonheads are all I go here for. The fried catfish is priced right, amazingly yummy, and worth driving across town for.

The sides are average, to be honest. Hush puppies, Mac n cheese, etc, are all average in my opinion.. Then again, their bread and butter here is the fish. 

Pretty friendly staff.

Heads up: Attached liquor store attracts shady people. Parking lot is always full of people staring at you, tryin to peddle their crap or ask for money..",LKe5xYLVQ08rhBRIww-YZQ,0,0,4,tjaObRIiuv7ztMxz9-nIJg

I should NOT be eating the center spine bone and it connecting bones. Second the Coating is too grainy. Did not contain any seasoning I was really disappointed.

That being said the catfish is SUPERB! 10 out of 10. I really haven't tried anything else there except once (yams & macaroni ) (8.5 out of 10) I normally get $5 or $6 bucks worth of catfish and that's it.

Neighborhood rough, but, during daylight you are safe. Only waited about 5 minutes for the line. They ran out of catfish just as I reached the front...Darn, now had to wait 2 minutes for the fresh stuff!! The food was wonderful. We ordered catfish, fried chicken, fried okra, hush puppies, green beans with ham and collards.  Total price to us was $22. Very reasonable. Took the food across town to home. Got home opened it up and what a delight. It was still wonderful, warm, fresh and extremely good. My favorite was the hush puppies. OMG. Next time will need to get a double order. The catfish was the best in Vegas. Service was fast and as soon as we put a couple $$ in the tip jar, they were very friendly and helpful.  Great Job Mario's.

5657272,2015-12-30,0,mOaHJZYTsgB0G_TIKykFAA,"Let's just say my family asks for this crunchy fried catfish all the time now.

Hot & Tasty! But go earlier if you want a big selection. We went in the latter afternoon and they were out of ribs and a couple other things.

The line is in back. You order and pay there. There are a few tables.

Friendly staff.

Reheats pretty well because the coating has cornmeal. Retains a little crunch. But it's still best fresh and hot. We always have leftovers because we get a big container of it.

I've tried the greens, Mac and cheese and.... I was curious about the chitlins. Greens were good. Son liked the Mac and cheese. I liked the chitlins. My husband's family is from the south and we make better Mac and cheese so I'm biased. It's standard. It's a bland sauce style like velvetta. I find it bland but it's a different style than ours. It's the kind kids love though.

Ask for the sauce packets. They are great on everything.

Also a tip. We went in expecting to spend 30 or so. We ended up spending over 40 bucks... And we walked out with more food than we actually wanted.

 Instead of asking them to weigh by lb, order how much $ worth you want. For example...around $15 dollars worth of catfish.. Instead of 2 lbs or whatever. You'll hit closer to your set budget.",Ewkl5dlHM_s_N0Fkb47Rzw,1,0,4,HQS-voEQH8xGslBuVirgIA
