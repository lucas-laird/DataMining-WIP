I used to come here about once a month for the lunch buffet as I work nearby, and I will have to start coming back now.  The lunch buffet is $6.99 for AYCE pizza, salad bar, and cinnamon twists.  Not a bad deal for a quick lunch!  Glad to see you're back Round Table!",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,3,1,5,236szcoqTACFYxZ66jeQEw

Pizzas really tasty & full of toppings, they do get their pizza line well stocked with decent choices! Only if they have more dessert pizzas. For the price it's well worth it, especially Vegas doesn't have a real pizza buffet, we have Cicis! They also have a dinner buffet on Tuesday for the same price! I'd say they need to have more advertisement to get more business 'cause a lot of people doen't seem to know about it.",BZEO4bFp_yG34pxrruaFlA,0,0,4,nMzFrSUR_B9DgzCOgtFOnw

To this day I still think RTP is the BEST pizza you can get - from a pizza chain restaurant anyway. The prices are a little higher for a pie here compared to other chain's - but like anything - you get what you pay for. The toppings are fresh and flavorful, and the bake is just right for my tastes. My favorite pie here is half and half King Arthur's Supreme/Wombo Combo. Ill take an RTP pie ANY DAY over Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Murphy's, Little Caesars, etc!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,3,3,4,gSbFb3j99pgOgjmuM30aMA

I was very disappointed guys! I had been craving the buffet for weeks, since it had been a while since I had been in. FAIL! 

We came in a little before 1 & left close to 2. In that entire time, not another pizza was put out. The same 2 1/2 pizzas that were sitting there when we arrived were there until we left. 

Come on guys, I didn't come here to fill up on salad! Definitely did not get my money's worth this day. Looks like I'm gonna have to try out the Sahara/Fort Apache buffet, seeing as how I am in between both locations. I would hate to have to do that, since my loyalty lies with the Lake Mead location.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,2,0,1,MktmZ7OknmctSYgvpWQBsA

I tried to explain that the last 3 times I got this special I didn't need a coupon it was just a Special...but the IDIOT with the tattoo on his right arm on kept on saying I cant give it to you unless you have a coupon....everything has a code everything has a code...bla bla bla....Instead of arguing I decided to suck it up and pay the 60 bucks fo the special that should have costed me $25 or $30 because I always come to the Lake Mead location and the owner was friendly. 

NOTE to the owner....What ever happen to the customer is always right? It was obvious he knew what I was talking about and you've given it to me the past 3 times with out printing anything Ohhhh but he did give us a discount of .27 cents for Seniors Discount on the XL Special.

Don't post a special if your not going to honor it...business 101

Here's the link see for your self 
http://www.roundtablelasvegas.com/specials.asp 

to the DUDE with the tattoo on the right arm....there is no coupon codes on any of your other coupons that have the dotted lines....and the XL Special is just a special...it doesn't show that you need to cut it out it's just a Special which the owner told me the last 3 times and I came home to look at the link to prove I was right...Get a new job where customer service isn't involved because you suck at it. What a FKN idiot  

Still give the Round Table 5 stars and nothing against the owner I just hate poor customer service. 

Feel free to contact me to give me the money back that I over paid.",qoU4uUNGFp_iKHx3FlVTSA,7,0,5,2rdFJSOV6KfKtbsj0KqbxA

The lunch buffet runs from 11-2 weekdays and is fairly priced at 6.99 pp. It includes ayce salad bar, pizza and garlic parmesan twists which are deelish. We got there around 1130 so everything was hot and fresh the pizza was great and the twists were amazing as always. They even have cinnamon twists now which is an added bonus like a little sweet treat to finish off the meal. All of the employees were friendly and kept checking on us to make sure things were ok.

All in all I had a 5 star experience. However their speciality pizzas are pretty damn expensive so I probably would only go back for the lunch buffet as it seems to be the best deal.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,1,0,5,IGqGAsEZEXFpSF7k4R33zg

Been there several times since they reopened the location to find that the pizza is still the same as I remembered. The customer service at this store is great. The workers are very helpful and will locate coupons laying around to try and lower your price. Even if you didn't ask for one. Very impressed with my experiences here and management should be very proud of their staff. They get the job done,5WIJnQFfP0zbKJd4BYXVGQ,2,0,4,noDJYlUy4uK71Ye1xp48bQ
3044360,2013-05-08,0,khylDqXpc2hTpuEQ154ZNw,"I have been eating Round Table, since I lived in Half Moon Bay, over 30 years ago. I am normally a pepperoni pizza person, but I like linguica a lot. One thing I've always like about Round Table, is that linguica is available as a topping.

This location seems to open and close a lot. Always a Round Table pizza but it has closed and reopened twice since I've lived in the area. As I understand it, it  was franchisee changes. Regardless, I'm glad it's open again.

Enough of the history, back to the Yelp. I went there today for the lunch buffet, AYCE pizza, salad, garlic twists (think garlic knots, but different shape) and cinnamon twist.. With drink it's about $10. 

The salad bar has improved since I was last there, they have three kinds of greens, in separate pans, for the salad base. An iceberg lettuce with bits of cabbage, a Romaine and spinach, I had all three. Over a dozen toppings and probably 10 types of dressing. I don't think they make their own dressing, but the thousand island has always been great there.They also have potato and macaroni salads, I had the potato it was good and I'm picky about potato salad.

I was there at the beginning of the buffet. The first three pizzas they put up were vegetable, pepperoni and a combination (which included linguica). so I was happy. I had pepperoni and combination, both were very good. 

The garlic twists were good. There was enough garlic you could taste it, a little more would have been nice, but I like garlic a lot.  (I didn't see any vampires in the afternoon, so there must have been enough) 8)

I didn't try the cinnamon twists, I ate too much pizza. I had taken it for granted when it was open, then it closed and I missed it, it was the first time since it reopened, so I over ate a little. I will try them next time.

I don't really understand the relationship with pizza and cinnamon rolls, it's seems fairly new, but most of the pizza buffets have cinnamon dessert variations included now. I'm not saying I haven't had the cinnamon rolls at Graziano's or Cici's after eating pizza, I just don't understand the relationship. Maybe pizza dough and cinnamon roll dough are the same, so it's easy to do. I digress.

Anyway, if you haven't tried Round Table give them a try. If you haven't been to one in a while try this one, The lady running the place today was very proactive, making sure everything was okay, do you need anything, any particular type pizza you like so they could cook the closest one of their buffet offerings, etc.,",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,0,4,AGhMZQGHHrU2aLvYaKgr4w
3283228,2011-06-05,1,khylDqXpc2hTpuEQ154ZNw,"We tried this place out because we had a groupon. Honestly, I'm glad we waited because I was not impressed by this place at ALL. 
The place was pretty decent looking, I'll give it that,  but the bathroom smelled REALLY strongly of urine. I understand people are nasty, and that's not the restaurant's fault, but you still have to clean it out. 
Anyways, the counter guys were really, which is the only reason I can give this place two stars. We ordered a ridiculously expensive medium with peperoni and mushrooms.
First off, some women brought their seven screaming kids in for dinner. I swear to god, they must have given these kids donuts and a two liter of mountain dew each before they left for dinner. Screeching, using people's chairs as a jungle gym, beating and kicking the gaming machines, all while the mommy's sat there like fools noshing on their pizza. This isn't at all the restaurant's fault, but as soon as they left more screaming, destructive kids came in, so I think you might want to get carryout if you end up coming here. 
A  girl finally comes out and brings us our pizza and she's actually wandering off when I call her back to get us some plates... Seriously.. Do you think we DON'T need plates? She finally brings that back and I realize we still don't have forks and knives. Whatever, I go hunt that down and bring it back to the table.
The pizza: The bottom of the pan crust actually tastes sort of like a saltine cracker.. Even looked a little like one.. Weird, but otherwise a completely unremarkable crust. The sauce tasted like the cheapo special junk you can get at the grocery store. The cheese was good at least and they used plenty of it. The peperoni and mushrooms however weren't really good. 
Overall, overpriced pizza with mediocre quality. Next please!",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,0,0,2,wIA_V343H91BqbcLEmjcFQ
3371665,2010-01-18,0,khylDqXpc2hTpuEQ154ZNw,"Pizza was not as good as other round tables. Seemed like it was cooked too fast (crust was typically undercooked like many of the fast-food pizzas). I do want to say that the guys working were very friendly and nice. Also, salad bar was pretty good.

UPDATE 5/13/2011: I appreciate the comment from Roy F. This is a sign of good customer service, and I would return and try the restaurant again. The problem is that I live in California. I visited on a trip to Vegas with the family. So, my next review will have to wait until I return again.

The downside is it is more pricey vs other chain's significantly and sometimes you wait on hold a long time when placing your order. I would eat this once a week if it weren't for the price/affordability vs Pizza Hut or Dominos as my kids could care less about the quality difference.,McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,0,4,CqMUCap6N7PXrY1JkAXQyQ

It's not gourmet pizza or New York pizza by any means but for some reason I like to have my RTP fix every once in a while.  There's something special about the Polynesian sauce they use for the Maui Zaui.  It's sweet but tangy and mildly spicy that works well with the ham, pineapple and red onions.

I ordered 7 pizzas (Maui Zaui, Guinevere's Garden Delight, King Arthur's Supreme, Ulti-Meat, and Chicken & Garlic), salads and some Cinnamon Twists a day in advance.  I got a message the next day saying that they couldn't get my pizzas ready by 11:00-11:30am because of ""how big the order was"" - this was second-hand information so I don't know the exact statement made by RTP.  So, I called to figure out what's going on.  Pleasant staff and I got my pizzas and everything else a bit after 11:30, no problemo!
