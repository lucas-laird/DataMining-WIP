and lack of quality employees makes the place mediocre at best. The bread is so heavy, it made me nauseous for a day, and god forbid you ask for any of the freebies you get frowned upon as if you're asking for their bank account information. Not to mention the globs of Mayo they add to these sandwiches and the soggy shredded lettuce and store bought tasting guacamole they put on the Beach Club. Pretty cheap for an expensive sandwich. DISGUST. The owners I believe, a tall guy with green eyes is always touching his nose and his obscenely tan shorter comrade are both very snooty and stuck up. The tan one less so, he seemed a little friendlier. And then the African American kid with braces that claims to be the manager that hates his job? I could literally die. Anywho, after giving that place the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe these were all isolated incidents (which they're not) I have decided to take my business elsewhere.",uIr5K6LzBopL1jArIIOmfQ,1,0,2,NkN3k0c-v8d6SW0KjUiMpw

I got three sandwiches. One was made wrong. The bread was so stale/hard on two of them that we had to throw them away. One was so bad it hurt teeth to try and bite. It should have been obvious to the people making these sandwiches that the bread should have been thrown away. 

I am too far away to return for a refund so I went to the Jimmy John's website and when I submitted the complaint it goes to a 404 error. I rarely give one-star reviews w/o allowing a restaurant a chance to fix things. I gave them their chance. 

They also did not give me a receipt. If someone that owns the place wants to make it right, here is the order to look up: Slim 4 + cheese, Slim 5 and a #5 with peppers (they forgot to put on).

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I owed my coworker lunch and I know Jimmy Johns is one of his favs so I offer it to him and check out the menu for myself: I ended up picking the roast beef sandwich, left the center of the bread in, added avocado, went EZ on the hot peppers and onion, and took off the tomato, kept the cheese and the mayo. It didn't take them too long to get to us.

When I sunk my teeth into this, all my past convictions about JJ were thrown out. This was a good, goooood roast beef sandwich. A plus is that we are in range for them to deliver to us when we are at work.

JJ's had all of the orders correct and labeled with everyone's name. The employees were very friendly and polite, and the restaurant itself was spotless. 

When I bit into my sub... WOW! The first thing I noticed was the delicious bread! I think I could have eaten just the bread and have been perfectly happy. The rest of the sub was just as good. The meat and fixings were fresh and tasty, and it wasn't skimpy at all. True, it might not be a foot long, but I thought it was a good value for the money.

3948021,2014-06-14,0,dk7pJipvk5MNZotQd9suUA,"As a relatively recent transplant from the Midwest, when I heard that a new Jimmy Johns had opened near our neighborhood I was positively thrilled.  

We've dined at this location twice now and both times were pretty disappointing, but for different reasons.

The first time we went into the shop for take out.  Clearly the shop and staff were new, so we gave them a wide birth of forgiveness.  The young guy at the register tried to correct what we were ordering on all of our sandwiches, stating that he was, ""just trying to save"" us money.  That's great!  That's really lovely customer service there, but the sandwiches with his well meaning order changes were not at all what we wanted.  That said, we decided to give them another go...and that was today.

I called in a delivery order and yes, they lived up to their slogan, ""Subs so fast, you'll freak!""  However, when we received our order, it was totally wrong.  Not like we received someone else's order wrong, no, as in the extras that we ordered and paid for were missing from all of the sandwiches.  I immediately called the store, mistakes happen, and when I told the staff what was wrong with our order, I could hear total chaos erupt in the background.  I clarified three times what was missing from our orders and finally I was assured that a new order would be on it's way.  Great!  Problem solved.  
My terminally hangry nine year old told me he could not wait any longer, so I gave him the go ahead to dig in, figuring that he could have the sandwich he ordered for second lunch or an afternoon snack.  Significantly later than our first order, our new sandwiches arrived.  I thanked the driver and then he told me that he needed the original order.  What?  I have never had a restaurant do that before.  If you screw up an order, if you want repeat business, you comp it.  So, I gave the guy the old order, and my kiddo says...""what do you think they're going to do with it?  Ewwwwww.""  Honestly, it made me wonder too.
Oh, and the replacement order...?  It's still wrong.
I highly doubt we will be back, and judging from the rating this franchise currently holds, not a lot of other guests will be either.  Bummer.",sce0NeD4N4BnHGaW7HPRRA,2,0,2,nkD_VqeNmguh_RWfhUADdw

I just visited again and a totally different experience. The guy at the register wasn't engaging or even very friendly. I ordered a large drink and the only straws were extremely short and didn't fit the height of the cup. When I asked if they had longer straws, the staff looked at me as though I was from another planet.

I then asked if I could have a bag. The staff pointed to a stack of bags sitting on the counter. Work ethic and customer service are effectively non- existent today, and this Jimmy John's is no exception. Take the extra 10 seconds to open a bag and place the customer's items in the bag.

This franchise WILL NOT survive in this neighborhood. Their location is horrible -- tucked in a back corner of an L-shaped shopping center. The staff here is going to HAVE to step it up in order to survive!

First of all this is a tiny location! I had my child with me in the stroller and wasn't really able to navigate the shop very easily. You walk right into the registers to order and the drinks and bathroom and sandwich pick up are all in the back corner. I ordered three sandwiches and asked to have a side of avocado and cucumber for my baby to munch on while we enjoyed our lunch. I was told by the manager/ owner(not sure) that he does not buy containers to ""keep his overhead down"". Sure I understand but you should have a side option and charge a little extra (I wouldn't mind paying) for the little cup to appease the customer. Not having the option at all kind of bothered me. I finished ordering and waited for my sandwiches in the back corner. While I was waiting I watched them assemble my sandwiches. Basically they put three slices of meat on and then fill it to the brim with lettuce. I asked for avocado on one of my sandwiches but they put it on all. It wasn't really a problem because the amount of avocado was pretty pathetic! Every time I have been to JJ's I have asked for sauce and then asked for an extra side of sauce because it tastes good. Well since this place doesn't want to have happy customers and just want low overhead I had to eat my sandwich dry.
