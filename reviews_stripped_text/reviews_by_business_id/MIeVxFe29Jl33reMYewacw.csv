The burger bun was cold and hard, onion rings barely warm and overcooked! I didn't  know this place had previously burned down and I wouldn't be sad if it did again.
They Need a whole new staff who understands customer service, cleanliness, and food quality because the staff that I encountered last night doesn't!
I noticed the black girl that made my order put her Nasty unloved hand on top of my onion rings! She definitely Needs a class in food handling. Next time I will share my reviews with State Health department :(",1oBWrKCDvH221hueHla2Rg,0,0,1,mYw5SDtCTpKZIb8u57Qcgw

My friends bacon is waaayyy over cooked. It was like eating tree bark. I don't even trust the burger, but I'm not wasting all the money I spent on food.  I will not ever come back.",OfB0F25QByaFUJypUe3ujA,0,0,1,O5CJTFQC1F8Oc9-IWVwrwA

Nothing makes you feel dumber than paying $17 for a bag of dog food.
Thanks for the RAW fries.... I guess they're too busy fighting off tweaked couples showering in their bathroom to get the food right.",U6tZwpRVjUfx-fwDbMAlPA,0,0,1,NL52vm2NLPNTvibXco8DfA
4124324,2018-02-04,0,MIeVxFe29Jl33reMYewacw,"So I ordered 4 whoppers from this location and the only special thing I asked was for extra pickles and onions on 2 of them. When we ate the whoppers the 2 that were special ONLY had pickles and onions. There weren't any tomatoes, lettuce, or mayo. The 2 that were plain had the smallest portion of lettuce. I know that people don't like lettuce. I don't either but there's too much lettuce and there's just enough. Well, let's just say that there wasn't even enough lettuce for one bite. This place was horrible. It's simple guys. How do you expect to succeed out there if you can't even get a freakin order right.",CRk8jfeGD-d8xh1hL8RiXQ,0,0,1,aqb_3QwWU8lKb7Nj0Bb2qA

4599781,2016-01-08,0,MIeVxFe29Jl33reMYewacw,I'd  give them 0 stars if I can! No service and they saw me standing there and oh no one else was there and only one car in line.  They had about 5 employees working. The lady continued to talk and laugh with her manager while I stood there waiting and she saw me.  I ended up leaving after 5 min.  SMH all I wanted was breakfast before work.,S3MGrskbXiDnwFcU5F9jog,0,0,1,bcPLRcAolhMk12Js6JSEwg
4804112,2016-10-05,0,MIeVxFe29Jl33reMYewacw,Beyond irritated with Fast Food. We came here thinking we would have a better experience than McDonalds. Nope just as bad. Had to go back for my sons ice cream cone and when we got home and checked our bag one of MY SONS 10 piece nuggets were NOT in the bag. Is it that hard to read the screen? No it is not. Now my 6 year old and 9 year sons are sharing ONE 10 piece nuggets. Ridiculous. Thanks Burger King. I guess we will stick with McDonald's.,B9LKbU-nMYb5QggpGblrag,0,0,1,vZ9hV19NmaLw48P4_K4PMw

Cashier was nice, and the manager was helpful. My burger could have been more well done, and less mayo and mustard, other than that the bread kept falling into pieces Really???

5629243,2016-08-20,1,MIeVxFe29Jl33reMYewacw,"I never had a problem with this place until today. The drive thru attendant, Vanessa, was so rude. Aside from asking me what I wanted when I ordered, she didn't say another word. Yes, you're morbidly obese and have a mediocre job, but that's not my fault. The reason I took off 2 stars was for Jabba's piss poor attitude and the fact that my croissanwiches have been poorly prepared on more than one occasion.",EQ5jgcKTn6_ZWdX91Gn0CA,1,0,3,xDrA4HdDsDnTB7vTCLZQNg
