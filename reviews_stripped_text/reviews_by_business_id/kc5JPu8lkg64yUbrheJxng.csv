Place is kind of hidden and run-down, but seems like a nice family owned restaurant. The cashier was friendly and they had an incredibly wide menu selection. I ordered the garden salad with ranch and added avocado. It was delicious and way better than anything the strip had to offer for under $10",2J1HhwWULZASkyx1wUCAJA,0,0,4,4n5uRg3FtlruOhzXvZuPFw

After two minutes of him asking me what building I was in I kept saying the hotel/room number that we were staying in but he was frustrated and I finally said that I had no idea what to make of the question since my answers didn't satisfy him. I asked if I could meet up with him somewhere in the build and to my surprise he hung up on me! Then approximately ten minutes later he arrived at my door pasta in hand; as I signed the receipt and handed it back to him he muttered something as he walked away...I gave the food to my boyfriend so I have no clue if it's actually good, I lost my appetite.

They put in a lot of effort with a beautifully designed menu that has extensive and delicious sounding options.  But the 4-5 times I've ordered from them there has been a problem every time.   First it was the salad, it was literally spring mix and beets on top with NO DRESSING for $10+!!!   The description promised much more.   Other instances have been dry falafels, undercooked meat, disgustingly oily hummus, etc.  The redemption here is that each time only one of my items was the messed up and gross version, all the other food is fine.  In fact, the time when they got all the food right the delivery driver was 30 min late, full of excuses, and rude.  How is a guy older than I am (31) giving me excuses that teens give when they are in trouble? All in all don't bother ordering unless you have absolutely no other choice.

They are not consistent in product or service and we are no longer going to support them. They are inefficient, rude and think they would appreciate the support of a fellow local business. 

(most recently) 

Last week-- I ordered a salad (from the menu) that I often order and its a surprise because sometimes I get the salad I order-- other times I dont. 

Yesterday, we ordered an extra side of avocado and they sent us an avocado that was bad. We called them and they offered a credit.  (no problem-- shit happens) but come on, really? 

Today, most recently we ordered a few things from their menu and not only was the lady on the phone incredibly rude but they jack up the prices for the most random shit and they dont listen to the order. When the (kind) delivery man came today to drop it off he noted on the receipt that the orders were wrong and proceeded to leave the right ones-- take the wrong ones and told us he would return with our full order right. 

The lady from Daddys called us again-- going back over it and proceeded to flip out at us for her mistake. 

The delivery man came back with nothing and we got charged the FULL amount.

Or put forks on the tables ahead of time. Thank you!

575223,2013-11-26,0,kc5JPu8lkg64yUbrheJxng,"A couple days ago i ordered from daddy's and like normal was confusing. ( i order with two other girls i work with usually) we gave the credit cards over the phone, then when the delivery man was got here (who was very nice) with our food he said he had to swipe our card on his machine, and apologized for the confusion. I got my bill and it seemed really high for just a sandwich. my sandwich was supposedly $7.95 and my bill when he got here was $14.53, seems weird right? well.. i asked him about it , he had no idea so i called the restaurant  to ask, the woman on the phone ""maggie"" was rude right off the bat, gave me the impression that she was pissed i was calling to see why my meal was so much, she insisted in telling me that she had charged my bill for deliver which she said was $2.50, Okay so i told her that still seems high to me and i said im doing the math right now and i was really over charged, she said ""okay so your good?"" i said no hold on a sec, she says "" okay whatever bye"" and hangs up on me... so lets break down the math

Sandwich $7.95
tax (8.1%) $0.64
Delivery $2.50 ( mind you we work right across the street) literally
the only reason we get delivery is because she wont take our cards if one person goes to pick it up.

so total come to $11.09

so i was right still don't know why it was $14.53... so I call back the restaurant to talk to the manager and explain the situation. Again ""maggie"" picks up the phone, i asked her if her manager was there and she said no, and says that she can help me, i go on to ask her when is a good time to call back so i can talk to him or her and she continues to insisted on me telling her the problem. First of all, i never said there was a  problem. (guessing she knew who it was) Anyways she is completely and utterly rude to me about not being able to give any kind of information out about him or even what the managers name was. i even asked for an email i can send of some sort. None. so i said thank you i will try calling back another day. about 10 minutes later the delivery man come in with 3 dollars, said that they did over charge me, by $1.50.... uhh ya no  but i was already so tired of this i didn't say anything and he said that he double it for me. I told him thanks and i appreciate it. He continued to apologize for the girl who he said was ""supposedly"" new. i know shes not i order from them all the time. The service is awful there. Point Blank Period. I would hate to ever give them another dime of my money, since now i know she probably over charges me all the time. Good luck to anyone with a complaint ever getting it fixed. Maggie or whoever the women is there (i don't know if she gave me her real name) get an attitude check. otherwise i will never order there again.",7ke0ZvAUlDIwq6hUsPVn5g,1,0,1,6XaOKIECjH1Ywkhs5zVVQw

1391738,2014-01-29,1,kc5JPu8lkg64yUbrheJxng,"Daddy's Delights is... alright.
This review is based soley upon delivery (which costs an additional $3 and is until 3am), although I can't imagine that dining in offers a much different experience.  

On the plus side-- their menu is extensive.  Salads, crepes both savory and sweet, burgers, pizza, pasta, fried chicken, quinoa, smoothies, ""fresh squeezed juices,"" gyros, grilled fish, etc etc etc.  If its 2am and you don't want pizza delivery, Daddys is great because they offer a *huge* selection of both the normal items & healthy alternatives, too.  Grilled veggies and sweet potato are always well done.

On the down side-- everything is mediocre.  Burgers are no frill, pita bread is tough, juices are watery, salmon is dry, quinoa is dry, lettuce is limp... but taking a hit for quality is something you might expect from a family restaurant who's menu is so large.  Don't expect to be excited about your order.  I feel like with a smaller menu they might be able to specialize in items instead of offering a wide variety of bland...

The delivery men and women are always very sweet, and always arrive in a timely manner.  My order has only been wrong once (a peach and papaya smoothie was red.. and watery and pulpy but thats besides the point), but besides that their operation is tight and service is friendly.

All in all, if its late night and my delivery options are slim I would order from Daddys Delights again, but the food is certainly not crave worthy.",4NfIpag40h-YuBz461eGFg,2,0,3,7A05QyBa-4FWTOHMj3YUpw

1729531,2015-04-23,0,kc5JPu8lkg64yUbrheJxng,"Honestly, a little disappointing. I ordered the tofu-portobello platter, and it didn't have portobello mushrooms on it! They substituted criminis, which is no big deal at all, but I would have expected them to mention it to me if they didn't have a primary ingredient in the title of the menu item. And there weren't really that many mushrooms. The tofu was the super soft kind and it seemed like it had been lightly pan-seared, maybe. So it was super mushy and - just not a nice consistency for a salad, in my opinion. Served on mixed greens with some avocado, and a sweet but otherwise kind of bland creamy vinaigrette on the side. I don't recommend that dish at all. 

My friend got the calzone lunch special and she liked it. Creamy chicken, cheese, baked into pizza crust - kinda hard to do that wrong, ha ha. 

The ABC (apple-beet-carrot) juice was fantastic. We'll give this place another try, but maybe I'll just get pasta or a lunch special next time. They have hundreds of things on the menu, but everyone in the place was eating pizza or wings - so I'm not sure the veggie stuff is really their specialty after all... or maybe its just the owner's dream but Vegas eaters actually just wantanother boring pizza place.

The pizza was suppose to have Ricotta-Garlic-Mozzarella-Chicken. There was no Ricotta and it had just a few tiny tiny little pieces of chicken. It looked and tasted like cheese bread. The zucchini could have been good but it was over-cooked. The zucchini inside was fried out. Oh yeah, we also got the Greek salad.

Went with the BF for lunch after a tennis game- shared a custom smoothie, the smoked salmon caprese salad, and Billy's wrap. 
Smoothie came out first, with blueberries, strawberries, peach, and pineapple- it was a large size for a good price ($5.50), and it wasn't very sweet, which goes to show that they are serious about not adding sugar or sweeteners.
Next was the salad- it was large and tasty, with sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese, caprese-style, on a bed of mixed greens with balsamic and smoked salmon. Lots of flavor, fresh ingredients, tasty salad. The caprese and salmon components didn't particularly go together, nor did the flavors complement one another, but somehow it worked as a salad.
The wrap was damn good, too: mahi mahi with spinach, sprouts, organic brown rice, feta, and avocado, served with a tangy orange sauce for dipping. Again, noticeably fresh ingredients and packed with flavor. 

For under $30, BF and I got a huge, healthy lunch.
Hoping this place does well so they can make the location a little nicer or move elsewhere- with this menu, they'd be successful: lots of variety and healthy options put them a head above a lot of other places with better locations and nicer decor.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,1,4,ziJKIbtOFAjIaLbDs-vCtA

It's a little hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere so you might not expect much walking in. I don't  know how many times I have to say this but don't judge a book by its cover. It looks like a family owned and run place --eastern european , russian or something --I don't exactly know but that's not important. What is important is their unique menu and wide variety of choices. I actually found myself a little bit overwhelmed when I looked at all the choices -- many of  them healthy some of them not ( this is a pizza place after all). They do all the  unhealthy stuff that you're used to eating and craving at a pizza place but if you need to check out something a little lighter you'll be right at home. 
They offer a wide variety of platters, salads, wraps quesadillas, and of course pizzas. Many things on their menu are vegetarian, vegan, organic or otherwise health friendly but not all of it of course.

The first time I went here I tried 1 of their signature dishes-- the chicken chop. It was brown rice, chopped chicken and plenty of fresh vegetables served over some field greens and looked kind of like a salad mixed with a chicken rice bowl. Big old portions and quality ingredients. I couldn't complain cuz it tasted pretty good too. I've also had their mini chicken pizza served with mozzarella cheese, pesto and diced tomatoes on wheat dough. A tasty and surprisingly filling treat well complimented by the side of onion rings I tried that day. 

Business seems modest for this place and I don't know if they will survive.

I am delighted as hell to be eating your food right now!

I ordered from here today at work and it was so nice to have such a large, fresh, and inciting menu of options to choose from for once! I am so over pizza, salads, and sandwiches at work its becoming a bit ridiculous.

I went with Hummus and Pita Bread, a BBQ Chicken Wrap, and a Strawberry, Raspberry, Pineapple smoothie.

The Hummus was so delicious and fresh! I had everyone at work fawning over it like it was their last supper.

The Smoothie was fresh and tasty as well. Not one of those overly sugared up smoothies you could tell this was all natural which i loved!

The BBQ Chicken wrap was not a hit for me. It was completely smothered in BBQ sauce and it said it came with ranch but it didn't so the BBQ taste was too overwhelming. I ended up tearing it it apart and just picking out the chicken, wiping off the BBQ sauce and eating it with the hummus.

Besides that I was extremely satisfied and we will definitely be ordering from here again! I honestly cant wait to try more things from their menu!",oG9VFtr_ye8v2tDnS3NOYw,8,10,4,_4SNy2IvnNQagzKiuw9kgw

After receiving my food, which was on time:), I started to eat it and I ordered the soy noodles. It was dripping with olive oil as I tried to eat it and I quickly got disgusted. Being that I was hungry I dabbed the oil and tried to stay happy lol. Then I also ordered the quinoa salmon dish. So I opened that and it was like a soup. I'm not too sure why but I was only able to take about three bites before I was done with that. The last thing I ordered was a salmon wrap. Which was okay. The wrap was very slimy, but it was probably because I had it delivered and I understood that. After this I was going to come straight here because I was mad that it tasted like that after spending $40! But I thought that would be bad if I didn't give them the chance to fix it and make me like the food first you know. So I gave them a call and spoke to Isabel and explained everything that I just typed. After putting me on a 5-6 min hold, she told me that there is nothing they can do because to issue a full refund they need to be able to take the food back. But I threw the wrap and noodles away already. After that I was mad because I am a business owner and if there is something that my client is unhappy about, I will do everything in my power to fix it and make them happy. Even if it means I take a his or loss with their sale. It's not about the sale not but the 24 other sales later that you need to worry about.

I called Daddy's Delight and complained about the shake, the person that answered the phone would only say "" That is the size they are"" in a flat monotone. Literally zero help at all.

Delivery took about an hour which is normal for the Hub but the driver called to say he was here but wouldn't bring the food up.  I know casino hotels are a pain to navigate with hordes of drunk people and a busy delivery schedule but that's why we pre-tipped well.

I wish I was drinking because food always tastes better when your drunk.  I should have trusted my instincts and not ordered from a place with 500 menu items.  My Chicken Parm came with a side salad and garlic bread.  The bread was pretty greasy and the salad was the Family Guy joke about ""salad from every Italian place ever"" anyways I was pretty disappointed.  I opened the box to find large wet spaghetti noodles covered in a ketchup type sauce with a chopped up deep fried chicken patty.  The best part of the meal was the ranch dressing that came with the salad. My BF had a Philly cheesesteak and he's pretty fond of that particular  sandwich.  I noticed he wasn't eating and he said it was so greasy he couldn't do it.  His came with fries tho and they were standard steak fries nothin weird there.

5333487,2017-01-10,1,kc5JPu8lkg64yUbrheJxng,"The food was mostly good but the rest of the dining experience left much to be desired. 

My friend and I were in the mood for vegetarian and we saw a take out menu of this place in the air b&b house we were staying at. It had an amazing selection of what looked like yummy, whole foods vegetarian and vegan food, including whole grain pasta, whole wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa, lots of veggies, etc. This seemed a bit out of place for a pizza joint in a gritty neighborhood in the north Strip, but we were intrigued so we decided to give it a try. 

The storefront looked drab, run down and frankly, unappetizing. When we walked in the interior was just as dreary. The decor looked like the break room at an old fraternity house. There was a flat screen tv on the wall that was on and annoyingly loud. The floor was uneven and cracked in a few spots. Also, we would excuse a little dirt on the floor if it was towards the end of a busy day, but we got there about 10 minutes after they opened. No excuse for that. 

There was not an employee in sight. We walked up to the counter and waited a minute or two for someone to come out of the back but to no avail. Finally, after saying ""Hello!"" a few times, a lady, who sounded like she'd smoked 3 packs of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years, came out from the kitchen and was deeply apologetic that she didn't hear the bell. We asked what bell? She looked around the counter and noticed there was no bell there. Oh well. 

My friend ordered a whole wheat pasta and veggie dish whole I ordered a greek salad, a side of baked yam and a side of grilled tofu. We told her we would be eating there. There was a cash drawer there but no cash register to ring up the order. The lady added up our orders on a calculator, we paid her, and off she went back to the kitchen to prepare our food. 

After about 10 or 15 minutes she came out with our food, served in take out containers. My friend's pasta dish was quite good and so was my greek salad and baked yam. The tofu, however, was the soft variety, had no seasoning whatsoever and did not appear to be grilled. The lady was very friendly and asked us how the food was during our meal. She seemed to appreciate our patronage very much, which was nice.

However, while we were eating, a middle aged man came out from the kitchen area wearing a Daddy's Delight jacket and sat down at a table across the small dining area from us. He appeared to be the owner but did not acknowledge us at all. Given we were the only people in the place, this made us feel a little uncomfortable. 

The next time we're in town, my friend and I would be willing to give this place another try, given there are other items on the menu that look really yummy. But only take out.",9VCwfXoUvaMOJ8VmWJyruQ,0,0,2,mzxt-_qRvRWojgFA4Xybgw

We ordered from there ALL the time. When we first got their menu in our door we all got a great laugh...but after our first experience we all want Daddy.

Now, I haven't been inside the actual location, however, I've ordered delivery at least a dozen times. Their delivery service is fast considering the great quality of food.

Their menu covers ALL bases - healthy, not so healthy, and straight grub. PERFECT option when you work with all the different personalities - there is something on the menu for everyone. I have a crazy obsession for their meatball parm sub. it's awesome. The stromboli is great too but I've also had crepes, and their salmon wrap -- all delish.

If you are lucky to be in their delivery radius, please know that I'm jealous and you'd be silly not to give them a call.... I'm not knocking driving over there and dining in... but... from what I heard from former co-workers - it's scary.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,1,1,4,PtPM6IgQzIKRnwYLeqGUyQ

I love that they have so many options, and it's great for me and my boyfriend because I can order healthy items if I want and he can order the less-healthy options. My absolute favorite and my go-to is the hummus salad with grilled chicken. I also love their pita melts, and the wraps are great too. The gourmet fruit salad is a nice treat. Boyfriend loves the  cheeseburger with fries and the chicken parm sub. I do have to say, their fries are awesome! Both regular and sweet potato are equally delicious. I haven't tried their smoothies or juices yet. This has definitely become our go-to delivery place.",BrKoAfW32omNcaFqW9pKsA,2,1,4,xq4k-fTeWPJUHQJFrMWf0A

I was too tired to go out for something so I saw this place on grubhub and ordered a pepperoni pizza. I was impressed by the menu it had EVERYTHING you could possibly want. Delivery was much quicker than estimated and the pizza tasted amazing. Wood oven baked. They delivered right to my hotel with no problems and they called my hotel room phone to let me know it was ready at the front desk. I will remember this next time I'm in town,rNwGsFV-jUbld4-kNPd9WA,0,0,5,6SAhVXkZTxsEv0MG_ZiP4w

5817410,2015-12-06,1,kc5JPu8lkg64yUbrheJxng,"This place used to be my go to place for quick health conscious food. Unfortunately due to an experience with poor customer service, a 45 minute wait without notice or apology and an incredibly rude hostess,  they have lost my business.  I am a restaurant investor and have a successful business.  If I was the owner of this establishment, I would seriously consider terminating this employee.   I asked her once about the food and was received with hostile reactions.  4 others witnessed her lack of regard for service.  Following that, she then ignored the next customer, blew them off completely. When he asked how long the wait would be for a wrap, he was then rudely quoted 45 min. She stated ""they were busy."" By that point, the room was empty.  To add insult, once I was furiously handed my food, I realized that my favorite dish was packed up without avocado and any seasoning. In order to rush me out they just put whatever they had ready in a to go box, highlighting that the problem with this place is not just with the hostess, but with the entire establishment.",oAZ7fyoWAWDTbXjMVWJpMg,3,0,1,4Xr9oLh1PKHUTJmpWrynug

Marinara sauce sucked. Watery, too sweet, and cold. Chicken fingers were just okay. Very basic. Definitely previously frozen. The only thing I really enjoyed was their tzatziki but too bad the pita bread wasn't that great either!! I also thought it was a bit overpriced. I'm surprised this place has such great reviews because I didn't find anything spetacular about it!",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,0,0,2,QiSku5JcVC4i-SoFnVpjpQ

I got the grilled chicken platter and veggies quesadilla- I highly recommend both, and you don't have to sacrifice your diet.
