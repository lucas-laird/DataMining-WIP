It seems like the filters are changed often enough because ice is clear. Great place. Great Price! Get your bags and bulk ice here!",SxUYJI8yGF-iu-k1xDcZng,0,0,5,LK_2AybiNKLegzNWEC8zkg

4373109,2015-04-19,0,d4Mw96Hb6ZoHEL2AxqGrbg,I have been getting my ice and water from here for what seems like forever. The water is always cruelest and clean and delicious. The ice is even more awesome because it has a cooler dump and will dump 20 pounds of ice straight into your cooler!!!,D9mQfhezStbeNzKAiNr-Rw,0,0,5,P7bD34Pfi46qW7-HBj_T0w
