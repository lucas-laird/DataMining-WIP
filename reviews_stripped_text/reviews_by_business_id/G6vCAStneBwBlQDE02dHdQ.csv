My drink was missing Caramel drizzle and the barista told me ""ummm it's umm there I think"" and my drink was only 3/4  full. When I asked to just remake it they said no its perfect. That's not right, especially if you are spending $6 on a drink that should cost 3 at most. Do not go when a young, small blonde barista w/black glasses is working.

I've never really had a problem ordering, but I get a pretty common and simple drink (tall Carmel macchiato). If you have a complex drink, then don't come to this location. They are super busy and baristas are usually sleep deprived students so don't be surprised if your double shot grande flat white with coconut milk at 140 temp isn't spot on. But, if you're on campus at times that aren't so busy (later classes or summer classes) then this location is just fine. I also think that they are a little heavy handed with the coffee at this location. For some reason, one tall coffee from here keeps me wide awake! At other locations around the valley, the caffeine from one coffee has little effect.",C1ZaCb7v6vxw4D0_2tXDfQ,0,0,3,7YWbwsCuJRK0_8b9SOIaDg

I wish there was an option to give them zero stars because they disregarded my order. I had to personally show them my order after they served 15 people. I ended up showing TWO baristas my order, and somehow, they still got it wrong. These mistakes could have easily been forgiven; however, NOBODY apologized for their mistakes and even laughed at my expense. Please train these baristas to have better customer service for the other unfortunate customers who decide to other through Tapingo at this location.",RXJd573wblCuqjZYd5hZOg,0,0,1,35PEEPHNnUquB2e7JEVaSw

There are generally 4 people working behind the counter and somehow it takes them 25 minutes to make my drink... there were 17 people behind me that got their drinks first and mine was just a Refresher!  How hard is it to put the mix in and add ice?  I watched the lady calling names look at my drink and ignore it whilst calling others drinks... I was getting so annoyed because I was almost late for class!  I have never received my drink from this location in less than 10 minutes and to me, this is embarrassing for Starbucks.

If the lines aren't enough to stop you from coming here, I can give you a few other reasons.

Once your order is placed, they take SO LONG. Waiting twelve minutes for a medium drink that I know can be made in two is just ridiculous.

The staff always comes off rude, sometimes when it isn't busy (Say- 6 p.m. on a Monday) they ignore someone waiting in line for minutes at a time, notice them, and say ""I'll be with you in a sec"" and ignore them for another couple minutes. They also aren't conversational at all and don't know how to answer questions or just be generally nice.

Anyway, don't come here. It's just not worth it. Walk to the other starbucks across the street (4780 S Maryland Pkwy) and get way better service and better quality drinks. They will be happy to serve you.",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,1,1,1,T_kXVzzuHYQl0x9dAUFrXA
3765919,2018-03-06,0,G6vCAStneBwBlQDE02dHdQ,This place is ridiculous. The employees have NO sense of urgency. They are frequently out of products. The manager consistently walks away from the computer right as somone gets up in line.,Uwz8Hv9Dq9vdDnVA4e4LYg,0,0,1,TqzCzIp-Qo093H8LtWI77A
3844071,2017-03-28,0,G6vCAStneBwBlQDE02dHdQ,"Seriously, they deserve 0 stars. There isn't a worse Starbucks in Las Vegas. They routinely mess up my order, have no idea how to work efficiently and fall short of customer service every time. Today's experience was no better. Thought I might get out without a hassle and then I watched the barrister take my food out of the oven and just place it on the back counter as she went about her next thought. She tossed it to me without a fork at my eventual request. Take the time and go across the street. The other Starbucks on Maryland is one of the best.",vYwYi-5hSRvr1evtKwdESQ,0,0,1,MrRmIi6yOc77gxOlsUIPPw

I pulled up to the box and got a Lovely greeting but I said I'm here to pick up a mobile order. I pulled up to the window for the barista named Trent to say it's 9.45$ even though I payed through the app with my Starbucks card. So I repeated my order to him to make sure he got it right and then he proceeded to say it's still 9.45. So I handed him my card and he scanned it then handed me someone else's order. I declined the drink and repeated what my order was again. That's when he handed me my drinks and one of my cake pops but not my chocolate chip cookie. He had such a dumb founded face on this entire time and after he said he put the money back on my card I looked at my account and it was not put back in. This is a horrible Starbucks who can't seem to do the simple task of completing an order that I made. I will definitely not be coming back to this Starbucks or any other one anymore because of this.",Bh-opCY0omOFMS9wqfHCNQ,0,0,1,OzkiV1MT9Kfr7GZ0Kh9HLw

As a student here at campus, I came here this morning and waited in a long line. I believe the person who took my order was a manager here because he is always there. He was impatient and rude, I hope the school read this so they can provided better training for their employees.",q448ePtKZhlma-AqG_Z97g,1,0,1,55wZH2Gx3LNfMfatiU4Uww
4559511,2017-09-20,1,G6vCAStneBwBlQDE02dHdQ,"I just can't even with this place. 

I have debated not writing a review because I am a starbucks Barista, but 1. This place isn't owned by Starbucks, and 2. I don't work here, so in the nicest way I could say this, I don't give a sh** about this location. 

Not only is the training half assed but the baristas couldn't care a nickel about any of their customers. They are rude, lazy, and poorly trained. I have been unfortunate to have to come here in between classes instead of walking across the street to my own location. 

This location does not hold the same values as Starbucks, and I can promise you that every time I have watched them, they do not make your drinks correctly. 

Save the extra money you are spending by supporting Aramark. I am not saying you have to go to Starbucks. There is a coffee bean on campus and across the street that actually care.

5278322,2016-06-07,4,G6vCAStneBwBlQDE02dHdQ,"This Starbucks is located on campus at UNLV inside the Student Union. It's ALWAYS busy with lines often extending outside the store and winding around the corner of the SU. Students and staff need their caffeine fix, right? Seating is hard to come by since many students set up shop here with their laptops and homework. Over the summer term, it's one of the few fast food joints open in the early AM. Clean location and super convenient, hence the busyness.

Others around her completely ignored me.  I had to find someone else to ask and it turns out it was right next to the girl that was grunting at me.
