I'm not a fan of McDs and rarely eat there...since this location has an open kitchen, I watched as they took frozen patties from the freezer and cooked them on their high pressure quick cooking grill press contraption. Same with the McRib. It was very off putting. 

If I read the sign right, all fried items from fries to nuggets to chicken breast are deep fried in the same fryer. If you fries taste like nuggets...you know why. 

At 11pm they were pretty busy. Only 2 people working. Makes no sense: 24/7 Macca's inside a 24/7 Walmart...during the holidays...when we arrived the place was empty so I got my order fairly fast. However my friends waited for a long time for their one item orders. There were just as many people standing around waiting for their order as there was people waiting to order. 

My double cheeseburger wasn't bad...considering the frozen state it started off as. The country buttermilk chicken sandwich looked tasty, but again, it too started off rock hard frozen. Coffee tasted & looked like tar. Won't buy that again...at any hour. 

3 stars bc even though it was clean, it was average. I would have given 2 stars but the cleanliness of the tables surprised me.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,2,3,ie_Q3_MCBc4JxjkOTa3dsQ
612000,2013-03-17,2,PFOPBxMDFZM0vFrI5R8txQ,I was checking out at Walmart and my two 10 year old daughter went here to ask for a small glass of water with no ice for their puppy and the girl told them that the McDonald was out of water and they could buy bottled water... They dug some of their Allowance they are saving for girl scouts to get some water for their puppy.. Poor service and bad form McDonald's!! I was furious when I got outside and heard this happened...,5-6cbxy4BeXGGG8rOjRXAA,1,0,1,5ZgbwdSAgKZRqq0a6oA1hg

The employees are very rude and unprofessional and not knowledgeable. All I ordered was a large unsweetened tea. Not only did they get it wrong, it took them sixteen minutes to get it to me. When I got it, it was an iced coffee... Simple mistake, so you would think. However the team member did not know what  unsweetened tea was and had to ask the manager, the manager ended up getting the tea.
I saw a guest pick up a to go order, opened it up ate a couple of fries, realized it wasn't his food and set it back on the counter. When I brought it to the team members attention they said it would be OK. When I told the correct guest that someone had eaten some  fries out of their bag, she let the team member know that she wanted untampered food and the team member argued with her saying this was her order.
This is not only disgusting, but it is sad that we have as a society learn to except this type of behavior and service.",xB_j3rfYPfYcEHEDY2uqug,0,0,1,u9PlLi9Q0yOK6EjlyW8ubQ

Dirty and disorganized.

They ran out of chicken tenders but cashier did not bother telling me. She just assumed chicken nuggets as a replacement is okay.

Manager refunded my order. I chose a different meal. While paying i checked the bags ai previously received and reminded that the manager they haven't given me the juice box for my child's happy meal and the cup for my drink.

Manager came back annoyed saying my drink was just there (at the counter) duh! It wasn't given to me when they handed 2 bags of my order. I saw the juice box but it was set aside so who am I to know that it is mine. All along i thought the drink was inside the bag. Manager handed me the juice and left. He forgot my drink cup.

I asked for a cup and he said you didn't get jt yet? He was still annoyed.

My goodness! Being disorganized is one thing... But being annoyed to assist customers is another.

They are lucky to be on walmart property that they get foot traffic. Place is soo dirty too! I'm not ordering here ever again!!!",owShUTxaIdgqHaS0p_ZXqw,0,0,1,UF_DGEatXBDZIyltqs2s8A
2544567,2016-02-19,0,PFOPBxMDFZM0vFrI5R8txQ,"This place was disgusting! First of all, it took me 15 minutes to order because the manager (assuming that's the guy that's wearing a black button up) just kept walking back and forth the front counter while there were consumers waiting for him. The only other person working was changing out the trash which then proceeded to put on gloves WITHOUT washing her hands and handling someone's food !!! When the guy finally took my order, he didn't even look at me ... Handed me my receipt while already looking at the guy behind me. He then yelled across the store at these two teenaged girls to come to him because he had forgotten about their orders. How do you forget someone's order when there were only like three other people there?! Bad service, and the place was dirty! Someone needs to close this place down. So gross",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,0,0,1,TRlf6uiYL3vTyFO0qwqY0w
2569065,2017-07-08,0,PFOPBxMDFZM0vFrI5R8txQ,"If I could give a 0 
I would the manager was incredibly rude African American woman 
They were having trouble with their internet as usual in Walmart and she told me to step out of line just a mean person you could tell is miserable if you don't like your job there are other places to work
Their computers were taking forever but that was OK I think not very ghetto rude customer service would not recommend this location to anyone 
I asked another employee her name and he  wouldn't give it to me just trying to add fuel to the fire and was trying to start create more drama very unnecessary 
There are several other bad reviews so all of us can't be WRONG
gross dirty old location ......",9yXpJjlqyQoKt2GjbBWdcA,1,1,1,JHgWX_zVRsuX4BIXcQxqSA
3488900,2016-08-03,0,PFOPBxMDFZM0vFrI5R8txQ,"Horrible, horrible service. First of all, the cashier had no clue what she was doing. We came by to get some quick cheap food and our order took about 10 minutes to take. It was like she didn't know what we were talking about. Next we wait... and wait and wait and wait. It had been about 30 minutes and nothing, so we went to see what was up. None of our food was even started and they had our order wrong too! so we wait an additional 10 minutes, and they still were missing items! But it didn't matter I didn't want to spend any more time in that dump. 40 minutes for 2 combos and a medium fry! I get that it was busy and there was only 2 workers (another complaint, why weren't there any more?) but 30 minutes at Mcdonalds is just not worth it. Just save your time and go to the Burger King across the street.",9epERckYQBcVX-CSBan0KA,0,0,1,VkoprJ7a9XaG-ZsWVqVykA
4338150,2015-05-06,1,PFOPBxMDFZM0vFrI5R8txQ,"By far the very worst McDonald's I have ever been to. This McDonald's is horrible.  Bad customer service. And very slow. It takes them forever to serve you their old, sitting under the warmer for too long food. Bad experience every time. They definitely do NOT take care of the customer.",DZK-uyErVMJ_Vh7JbQ_LkA,1,1,1,Jm_wi7UAJxX6bzCOJ61Ojg
4655090,2011-03-08,2,PFOPBxMDFZM0vFrI5R8txQ,"I work in the immediate area of this McDonald's. I use it regularly.
 This McDonald's is incorporated in a Walmart super center. After 11 a.m., it becomes a mad house. And when the high school lets out in the afternoon, students flood the restaurant. Long lines and waiting on a table are the result. If you do not like crowds that include loud high school students, I recommend avoiding this McDonald's in the late morning to mid afternoon. B.T.W., management has zero tolerance of rowdy behavior.
   This McDonald's leans toward being a McDonald's Express. So if you want an Egg McMuffin-not here.
   With a location in a Walmart Super Center the Eastern Beltway Center, it has a high convenience factor.
   When the restaurant is not congested, it is a comfortable restaurant to eat McDonald's or sip coffee. I never got rushed.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,1,0,3,8trqVTdHQ8tZm6qDFiclpA
