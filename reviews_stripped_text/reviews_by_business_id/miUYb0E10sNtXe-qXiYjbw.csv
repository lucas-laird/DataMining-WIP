I've been 5 or 6 times and I have to admit, I'm blown away by the consistent great food, top-of-the-line service and cleanliness of the place.  The manager, Megan, made a point to remember my first name.  Her crew are the most attentive, polite and active group I have ever seen at a restaurant.  They open the door for you, get you a drink refill, remove your basket away when your finished.  The chicken is fantastic EVERYTIME which is hard to do.

This is a new location off of Tropical and Decatur just south of the north 215.
It's next door to the Winco and just south of nasty Burger King. And across the street from AMPM gas station and the new LVAC.

I like the chicken strips but they need some southern flair added to them. I'm talking country gravy. I'm from Texas and that's who we ate them back home.

3520266,2017-03-27,34,miUYb0E10sNtXe-qXiYjbw,"I know Raising Cane's is very popular. I mean just seeing the long line of cars in the drive-thru, one that can easily rival the long one at In N Out, tells me that RC has a following. I personally don't get the hype. While I do think the chicken tastes good, it's just nothing special to me and reminds me of plain chicken fingers that kids dip in ketchup. I have always wished that they would have the option for your fingers to be tossed in flavored sauces which would make sense to have options like that given this is a place where the main star is chicken fingers. Inside offers a decent amount of seating and tables. They had a good amount of employees on hand and there was someone really taking there time moving stuff to clean tables, chairs, floors etc. which is always nice and it did look very clean inside. The employees that helped me were very friendly and the vibe was good. 

3 Finger Combo ($6.19) - This comes with 3 chicken fingers, 1 cane's sauce, crinkle-cut fries, Texas toast and a 22 oz drink. I added an extra piece of toast for $0.99 cents and an extra Cane's sauce for $.029 cents. The chicken fingers were good, but didn't taste amazing. The chicken at Chick Fil A has far more flavor in my opinion. The crinkle-cut fries were very good as was the Texas toast. For some reason my Cane's sauce was too salty and it's usually not, so maybe they just made an off batch. The sweet tea is pretty good and pairs nicely with the chicken.

3889967,2018-04-26,0,miUYb0E10sNtXe-qXiYjbw,"It's been a while since I've been here getting sidetracked by KFC and other tasty fast food options in the interim.

This is my closest Raising Cane's and the one at which I joined the Caniac Club and subsequently got a free box combo along with my membership card for doing so.

If I have to pay full price for chicken tenders (no coupons or specials available), then Raising Cane's is my preferred choice for overall flavor, portion size and the included side dishes. The chicken tenders are both larger, juicer and cooked to a higher state of perfection than the notably smaller variety being sold at PDQ.

On the other hand, PDQ does has a variety of tasty chicken sandwich options available in addition to its chicken tenders or nuggets while Raising Cane's is pretty much exclusively a chicken tenders establishment.

This is why I usually get most of my chicken tenders at Raising Cane's while my go-to location for truly tastebud-stimulating, deluxe chicken sandwiches is PDQ.

Since PDQ does regularly have 2 for 1 coupons available for their sandwiches and combo meals throughout the year, they do get a fair amount of my business whenever such a 50% off option is available.

Coupons are few and far between at Raising Cane's.

Note that PDQ also will give you a completely free combo meal of your choice (not just a 2 for 1!) on your birthday, while the best that Raising Cane's can do is a free drink.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,5,KUDcRi8VjejWd-o9KpHfJA
