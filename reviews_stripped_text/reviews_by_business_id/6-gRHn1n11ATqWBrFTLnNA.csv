From what my co-workers said, the chicken was extremely good too. Their drinks were also not expensive. The manager was really nice because he let us pick the music that we wanted in our room.

Dale at Henderson is awesome. Very professional! 
Both locations are maybe a $15.00 Uber ride from the Strip. You'll save at least $100.00 on food and drinks, rather than the strip. 
The food is upscale, but at a reasonable price. I highly recommend trying the Lobster Mac and Cheese! It's delicious and fresh! Both locations get fresh alive Lobster daily!

I've been getting gas across the street from this relatively new pub for quite some time before I finally decided to step inside and see what all the shiny lights were all about...
I sure am glad that I did!
Great American Pub has easily become one of my favorite go-to local spots!
Where to begin...?
First and foremost, as a fellow hospitality employee, I notice and appreciate excellent service. Thanks to my work schedule, I am only able to stop in late night...which might be a blessing in disguise! Every time I have come in, Dante has been behind the bar as he is one of the main graveyard bartenders. Not only is he extremely personable, friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, quick, and just all around outstanding, but he remembered me upon my second visit, which is something a return client highly values. If you are unsure about food options, he makes fantastic and honest recommendations.  He also makes amazing drinks and is always willing to offer expertise advice when it comes to any gaming questions customers have.
Food wise, Great American Pub definitely offers a very interesting menu in comparison to your typical Las Vegas bar menu. Highlights from the menu include the lobster mac & cheese, the Philly cheese steak, and the Great American Pub salad. There are also 2 very solid happy hours that cater to both the post 9-5 audience as well as the late night industry crowd. 
Finally, the venue itself is straightforward, clean, and provides plenty of TV's to please sports enthusiasts.",o5RQvOlSjTk5AHqrTRoXNw,2,2,5,0oWvRu_8rja1D24PnX-Tsg

My fiancé sat at a poker machine that was frozen and she said she would call someone about it but never did, not a big deal we found another one open. We had to flag someone down for a second drink... never a smile or any interest in interacting with us as the customer.

We really lack cool bars in the south, and I love this place.

This bar has been with me through gambling wins and losses, and I will always keep coming back. Partially because I'm a dirtbag gambler, but also because this place eases the pain when you lose that $20 in the machine. Or $50, or $100. Their comps are always more than enough to kill that sting when the card gods are not on your side.

You have to be a pretty huge idiot to get kicked out of GAP. I can be a pretty huge idiot sometimes, but I've never gotten to that level. Thank god, because Dale looks like he could beat me up.

The happy hour is nice. Cheap, good food. But really, the reason to go to GAP at the end of the workday is Dale's facial hair. It is truly a breath of fresh air. That guy can really run a shift, and apparently a razor. Great job, everyone!",9auFKOnjngvpgL4h3iwO4Q,0,0,5,oBEMKjoQBKhDqTjgUs0rOQ

The clean look of the pub was what caught my eye and I am glad I decided to give the place a try. I was greeted right away by a bartender named Rocky who was friendly and enthusiastic the whole time. Informed me that Happy Hour started at 11 p.m. so score on late night food and drinks for being a first timer there. Rocky was engaging, made sure drinks were filled, and made sure patrons were taken care of. Really professional.

Ordered the nachos, lobster mac and cheese, and a pepperoni pizza. Domestic beer was like $3 bucks during happy hour. Cool. The nachos were surprisingly good. The tortilla chips were fresh and crispy. It was served in a deep bowl, so the creamy cheese was mostly on the bottom, but it was not a problem to get the chips to the cheese though. Fresh cilantro and sliced jalapeno added a nice kick too. The lobster mac and cheese was very rich and decadent. There was some good chunks of lobster in it so that was a plus. The pepperoni pizza came out piping hot, but for $10 during happy hour the pizza was a good value.

For my second visit, I ordered the pork tacos and the nachos again. Pork tacos come 3 in an order and served with sliced lime and salad on the side. It was pretty good. The pulled pork was not dry at all and I was kind of glad it wasn't doused in some sort of sauce masking the actual pork . I was surprised how much I liked this pub as it seems to have a lot of locals and is very clean. The are different football team banners along the top part of the walls, so it's an equal opportunity NFL fan. All fans welcomed! Different bartender this time around, but she was genuinely nice and accommodating. Her shift was ending, but she still made sure to say bye at the end.

They have a good selection of beer, and a full bar. I went with the house pale American lager and enjoyed it in a nice tall frosty mug. 
The food was well enjoyed by my whole party. I myself had the Cobb salad.The chicken was moist and delicious, obviously very fresh. It was the perfect portion for a salad. Because salads themselves are not great to take home, I tend to prefer a portion that is big enough for a meal without letting much go to waste. 
I also tried the Great American sliders, yum! The bun was great, very fresh. The fries were amazing! Obviously hand cut and similar to a famous fast food place right across he street.(hint in n out) but BETTER! 
The service was good we were greeted promptly and served very soon after.
Our waitress was sweet and very attentive, wish I remembered her name, she was Tall with dark wavy hair.

Do yourself a favor and get the half pound burger. Never knew a hamburger had that kind of taste potential.",xOARkxnnSOkmBrXFDYWqKQ,0,0,5,f3agd0zp4zaVc9NRIQudvQ
5098968,2018-04-22,0,6-gRHn1n11ATqWBrFTLnNA,"I wish I had good things to say about this place, but unfortunately the manager, Dale, makes it impossible.

I enjoy watching sports and playing video poker, and since this place is near my home, I frequented it on a pretty regular basis but will never return again.  The first time I encountered Dale, was when my companion asked what the drink comp policy is at GAP.  We were pleasantly surprised when Dale responded with ""You gamble on us, we gamble on you.""  We thought that was a pretty welcoming attitude and returned fairly frequently to watch the games we follow and to play video poker. 

At some point, Dale's attitude seemed to shift and it didn't seem to matter how much or consistently we gambled.  One evening after playing for several hours while watching a sporting event, we were surprised to be presented with a $65 bar tab.  We went ahead and paid it but thought it was inappropriate that there was no point during our play that we were informed a tab had been started.  If drinks are initially being comped and then at some point they are not it seems inappropriate to not convey that to the customer so they can make appropriate decisions (ie:  stop drinking, stop gambling and just buy drinks, leave etc.) but as long as a customer is gambling it's a reasonable assumption that unless told otherwise they believe their drinks are being comped.

But what really concerns me about Dale is his petty, vindictive, and immature behavior.  This is not the professional behavior you'd expect from a manager.  Over the course of many visits, I observed his increasingly hostile behavior culminating in the last time I will ever take my business to GAP.  I watched him get into a verbal altercation with a customer and rather than behaving professionally and taking the high road, as one would expect from a competent manager, he behaved childishly and goaded and taunted the customer.  It was completely inappropriate behavior and I was embarrassed for him.

Dale seems to have customers he plays favorites with and applies different guidelines and service to them.  With so many wonderful choices in the area providing better service to their customers, there is no reason to take your business to an establishment with bad management because it filters down from there.  Note, the times I visited GAP when Dale wasn't present the rest of the staff was wonderful and the place had a whole different vibe.  I suspect he might treat his staff in the same petty way he chooses to treat some of his customers.  Unfortunate.",0BcfGgPDqhqW_6nOEoOlog,1,0,1,RKkJkKimboCUqUlXpNsfNg

The place was busy but machines were open at the bar which is where we sat.  Played Keno, Poker, and Ultimate X.  Left about even after tipping out and eats and drinks were taken care of and comped because of our play.

As far as food goes they have a pretty nice sized menu.  I always like to try the pizza when checking out somewhere new.  The pizza was above average.  I'm from Chicago so it's tough to like a lot of pizza places around here!  Good sauce, but crust was great.

The service is very very good here.  Met the owner Chris, who really takes pride in his place and wants to give his customers and gamers a great experience.  I signed up for their players club and got $20 in free play for signing up no accruing 50 pts.  Free play is always nice.

For dessert. We went with the donuts!  Amazing!  

All I can say is, the drinks stayed filled, the food was excellent and service was top notch.  Give this place a shot, especially if you're a gamer.  Wide open area, clean new machines, great food and atmosphere.  Not much more you can ask for!",1T-rePv-lLJDO5gVGFyfFQ,4,4,5,HQ07Fa97ut7_7XLjGe26oA
