I had tickets to a concert at House of Blues.  I received an email a few days later that if I made a reservation at the restaurant, there was a 20 percent off discount at the restaurant.  I actually didn't make a reservation because I wanted to check out the rest of Mandalay Bay to see if I'd fancy another place. 

Concert night - doors open for concert 8:00 pm.  It was already 6:20 and still didn't know where to eat, but I knew I was hungry.  Handy Yelp had good reviews, and there was no line outside. After perusing through MB and Delano, finally decided to make an Open Table reservation for 6:45 pm.  Got there 10 minutes early, was seated right away. The hostess and server were very friendly and welcoming.  

I got the Voodoo shrimp, kids had a chicken and a pasta dish (I think... I'll post photos). Our food was delish, good quality, awesome portions. I wasn't expecting or wanting anything sweet in my order, and corn bread made my dish too sweet for my taste, which was probably the only thing I didn't like.

The 1st day I ordered the French Toast Brioche which was a huge portion but cooked to perfection. My gambling partner opted for lunch that day and ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and fries which the only comment I got was ""its decent"" - but during our hotel stay, the menu changed overnight! Our server told us the brand new menu just kicked off and she couldn't wait for us to try it. The new menu is very southern/smokehouse comfort food, which I am not a huge fan....But being on vacation and adventurous I ordered outside my comfort zone for some good' ol comfort food. I ordered the Shrimp n Grits, which the shrimp was lil overcooked, but the chipotle cream sauce bit back with a spiciness that was easily cooled with a beer. I ate the grits cake with that creamy sauce with no problem and it was tasty! My partner in crime that night had the Fried Chicken with Honey Drizzle and homemade mashed potatoes with gravy - wow, talk about a huge meal! The honey added to the crispy coating of the chicken was perfect. I'd say the new menu is a hit!

It was getting late and knowing they would soon close, I asked if they would seat us for dinner. The music was amazing, performed by a Hawaiian band who by themselves are/were deserving of 6 stars - so good, I'd pay to see them again.  And that's pretty much where the good ends.  The service was lacking and two of three items will not be ordered again.

Our first waiter seemed a bit off and after bringing our drinks, told us he was leaving.  Since he had already taken our order we expected our apps shortly.  Nope.  Turns out the first order didn't make it to the kitchen, so we had to start over with a second waiter who didn't appear until our glasses were empty.  

The Carolina Mess was very good.  The gumbo, skip the gumbo.  And try something other than the Smokehouse or don't get ribs if you do.  On second thought, back to my original thought, try something else - none of it was freshly prepared.

I'm not sure what was going on, but servers were conspicuously absent from the dining floor.  They ""seat"" until closing and I could hear grumbling from other patrons wanting to order and needing refills or their checks.  Maybe the servers had to also prepare the food???

Chalking all up to a ""one off"" night, we'll try again when back in town.  The Carolina Mess with a couple of drinks and live band make it worthwhile.",0bmIeL4sji64bX5wZjCe9A,1,2,3,Q3wvGnCNkIi0VdFYD6n7vA

I'm giving them three stars because some of the issues I had won't allow me to comfortably rate it at four stars. 

I had a HOB Hurricane, that was really tasty and had a decent amount of liquor in it. I was just a little turned off because the orange slice on my glass either had been sitting around for a while or the orange that it was cut from was extremely old, because it was almost completely dehydrated.

We also had the Voodoo shrimp and the chicken wing appetizer. They were both awesome, but had potential to be better. The sauce that comes with this dish is delicious and the cornbread was also very well made. Unfortunately, you can taste from the texture of the shrimp that they are far from fresh and are actually a little on the old side. Bummer.

The fried chicken was probably the tastiest fried chicken I've ever gotten at a restaurant (or I guess a bar, because I have never actually ordered fried chicken at a restaurant) - all of the herbs and spices complimented each other well with a hint of heat and splash of lemon. Unfortunately - HOB has decided to serve this dish in a small cast iron skillet with a pool of oil, so your chicken and the dry, cold slices of bread served with the chicken basically sit and soak in oil while you try to eat. Gross. 

I'm not sure if recent events may have effected the quality of food, based on less traffic, but, the appetizers we had would easily be five stars dishes if they can use fresher ingredients. If fresh oranges aren't available, I think customers would probably just prefer to do without the old garnish.  As far as the chicken wing dish is concerned, I would recommend either draining the oil, or placing an oil absorbent pad to seat the chicken on in the skillet, if you would like to maintain the authentic feel of the dish by serving with the skillet. And damnit, serve warm toast - who wants to eat hard, cold bread with their fried chicken?

Overall, would go again and I would definitely tell people to check them out...Definitely go get a Hurricane.",M0XnwuugnvCXL5I2f8sPXQ,1,0,3,yo1Dc_quFDBOQtSdELe7XQ

HOB also wanted a large deposit and we opted out since our total head count was difficult to track.  Upon arriving on June 2nd at 6:30, they realized I had made 3 different reservations on Open Table for parties of 8 and I could only hope they would seat us close by each other.  Instead of separating us, Meg did the most wonderful thing. She put us up in a big private party room that held all 25 of our guest. We had table clothes and our own private TV.  It turned out to be the absolute best thing. Ashley even did separate checks.  She was a great server. Never seemed annoyed or bothered by our large party.  Everyone enjoyed their food very much. I saw lots of plates full of the HOB chicken, ribs, salad, chicken wings, salmon, the collard greens, the famous jalapeno cornbread and the drinks were flowing.

The House if Blues is decorated with so many various displays of art that surround the whole restaurant. Their use of skulls in the decor is really amazing. Who does not like skulls as art! Displayed properly and professional of course! The beautiful benches in the front of the restaurant are amazing too and great for that perfect and unique photo one may be seeking. 

The hostess greeted me and ushered me to the bar where I informed her I would like to be seated. The bar was really busy but the bartender came down and took my order within first five minutes. Having already eaten I did not order any food from the menu here; just wine. I had a glass of Chardonnay while I took in the awesome rock that was playing . I love it when ever song that comes on you can sing along too, but only in my head.

Does the chef/s taste their food? I don't think so cause the Cajun pasta tasted like a whole bottle of liquid smoke (nasty), the HOB burger smelt and taste like feces in a barn and although the mahi mahi was edible it was not special at all. This place may think they are too big for their britches but they need to do some serious quality checks.

HOB tried accommodating, but there weren't any tables big enough to accommodate. The best they could do was a large circular table that was elevated with a bunch of side stools around the large table. Several members of our group stood and walked back and forth to the bar so it worked.

Servers were a little slow going at first, but picked up on the rhythm of the group and drinks. 

There was a guy singing with his guitar onstage and it was good chill music. However, the place was very loud, so it was one of those places you have to shout a bit to chit chat.

Food?
The menu is mostly fried or comfort food. 

Our table had quite a few of the appetizers: Jalapeño-Cheese cornbread, Hot Wings and Carolina Mess. Tried a sliver of the cornbread and it was good, but I avoided the other items.

It was hard to find lighter menu options. The only thing I noted was the blackened salmon with a cucumber/tomato salad and thats what I ordered. Glad I had this option, but it was one of the most expensive items ($24); only item more expensive was the NY Strip.

Me and my husband spent almost seven hours at a nearby car dealership and we were looking forward to a nice meal before watching George Clinton in concert.  My food was truly terrible.  

I ordered the Jalapeño Cheese Cornbread as a starter.  They seem to have forgotten the name of their appetizer because there was no jalapeño or cheese in this concoction that I could taste, smell, or see.  My only that, I ate a small amount and had an itchy throat allergic reaction in a short amount of time (before getting up from our table).  

My entree was the fried chicken that comes with mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  The chicken was crispy.  This was the only thing impressive.  Unfortunately, there was so much salt on the skin and the chicken meat that I couldn't bear eating it.  I tried a giant fork full of potatoes and tiny bites of chicken but the potatoes were equally as salty and heavily peppered.  The gravy is nasty.  The only thing to save the mess was the extremely sweet coleslaw.  That was equally as nasty but cold and calming to a salty tongue.  They attempted to be fancy by adding a piece of shredded basil to the top.  

This was a hot mess of a meal that I pushed to the side and didn't bother trying to satisfy my hunger.  

The waitress came by to clear the plates and she said nothing about the full pan of cornbread or the partially eaten chicken combo.  She had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert.  Why?  Either I am extremely full or I don't like the food.  Take your pick.  

We had a Yelp check-in Offer for 15% off of food that made up for the over priced culinary disaster in a small way.  Chicken and mashed from a casino buffet would have cost a lot less and tasted  considerably better.",IYk2DG_yBByVXxrVTo-BOg,4,0,1,MwVrrrZlulrKZI7aHT8OVQ

My friend and I had breakfast at the House of Blues. It's located in the northern part of Mandalay Bay.

It felt like going to church when we walked in. Stained glass windows greet you at one part of the restaurant and bar. On the main floor, there's a huge tree smack in the middle of everything.

I ordered a breakfast skillet. It was basically everything that you can think of and it was delicious. I loved the sausage with the eggs. Even all the broccoli florets worked well, although I ate more broccoli here than all my other meals in Las Vegas combined. Hey, give me my calcium, protein, and my multivitamin in a vegetable!

Prices are a bit high. You'd expect it to be that way when you in Vegas.

We came in with a group of five to a restaurant maybe a quarter filled for brunch. Our waiter was a train wreck. The dude didn't know what vegan meant and refused to ask if anything could be made vegan on the menu. That's fine, we assumed nothing really could be made vegan based on the menu. My girlfriend and I settled on coffee. 

After everyone got their food, he forgot a side order of toast and never came back to drop some off. Our coffees never got topped off, and he basically decided to abandon ship.. I assume because he made an ass out of himself when he said ""Uh, yeah, flatbread.. probably? Not vegan because.. so many. Ingredients."" and said ""Well there's olive oil too.."" insinuating olive oil wasn't vegan. 

After the meal a manager wound up giving 25% off the total bill, but the waiter didn't bother taking responsibility for his shittiness. Instead, ""I had another big table to take care of."" Thanks bud, there were like 20 people in the whole restaurant and you weren't the only waiter. 

For what it's worth, the pancakes were apparently good asf here, but everything else was ho-hum -- except the service. Lols.. been awhile since I've had a waiter so miserably incompetent.",rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A,1,1,1,FOhgXb2VljWudYrlBJljyg

This would be an awesome place to view a band, we were there too early to take advantage of that. Next time!",QLk3p-zJeEwDTyJDao1YGg,2,0,4,nkYzOWuJaZRm2H4hC7EFWQ

Lost out on at least $200-300 worth of alcohol sales for the 20 adults having drinks. Service was atrocious, billing a nightmare, no ambiance, stuck us in a closed in room, took the ribs off the menu, service disgusting, such a bad experience.  Order the Shrimp Voodoo and it tasted muddy. My husband ordered the hamburger and it was mediocre all the way. Unless you are a party of 6 or less, or you want to get drunk, (Which makes everything better than it is) DON'T GO there.",avigNdCwPm1RHv7HM9TE2g,1,0,1,XVQ3H1FEmStnlBYdGewFMg

My food was so fresh, just cooked & so satisfying. So happy that I chose that option. It was like an omelette, with hashbrowns. Definitely something for everyone to try out at this place. 

Our server looked like Denzel Washington, and I told him that. Apparently, he gets it all the time. LOL he was really cool, and very helpful.

Will come back.",Ve6Yq7F9Chf8N0JuJ7cQ2g,2,0,5,mZM_XsWiTd1BTT2LJbZwag

Both were AMAZING. The shrimp was extra crispy and the bread was toasted and never got soggy. The brisket was shredded, slightly spicy and yummy. I definitely recommend ordering a side of remoulade to eat with their perfectly crispy fries. We also ordered the Bumble Bee drink and were highly impressed. We ordered two at two different times and they all tasted the exact same, so their bartenders are consistent. We also got them in the souvenir cups, which are very cute mason jars with the House of Blues logo on them. Our waiter was lovely and refilled our waters as needed without us having to ask. The live music was enjoyable as well! The prices are definitely on point for the quality of the food and drinks!",xxeHJ6dcrWf0pgugdQdKQw,0,0,5,6m5-rXTW5W-Og2LVk1t1Sg
5902341,2017-09-11,1,rkH_CkTZBKOv2q0kAq5M_A,"We were here to see a show, which was supposed to start at 8 pm.  But when it didn't start until 9:15, we realized that we were going to have to leave before the end, since we hadn't eaten.  Because of proximity, we chose to have dinner at House of Blues.  

Tip #1:  Bring an Alaskan seal fur parka, because you're gonna freeze.  There's nothing they can do about it, since it's controlled by Mandalay Bay.  Our waitress brought me some linen napkins to throw over my shoulders, which did nothing.  But then, without being asked, the wonderful manager, Melody, came over with a t-shirt that she gave to me (no backsies!) to help warm me up.  Now that is service!  We had an enjoyable time talking with her after our dinner, and it's so gratifying to feel like a valued customer.

We didn't feel like ordering a ton of food, so after ordering my customary Riesling, we started by sharing a veggie flatbread.  It was different and delicious, with pesto, mozzarella, artichoke hearts, broccolini, and a few more items.  We also shared the Angus beef meatloaf, which had a mushroom and bell pepper sauce, but happily, it wasn't drowning the meatloaf; it was also topped with fried onion strings and served with veggies and smashed potatoes.  The meatloaf tasted very good, but I'm not a fan of soft meatloaf, which this was.  My husband thought it was great.

Even though House of Blues has terrific ratings on Yelp, I never expected to be as pleased as I was.  I'd love to be able to give it 5 stars, but shivering even with the t-shirt, and fabulous live music that was simply ear-shattering, is enough for me to have to take it down a notch.  The food, the service, and above all, the manager, made up for it in spades.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,3,4,iSlpcjTmaB9ZKAr5WyuaWg
