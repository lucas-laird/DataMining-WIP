1110187,2017-08-12,0,pidpBdWsOFfe7pWypBIoiQ,"I'm always continuing my search for good Korean food as you'll see in my other reviews. I saw this new restaurant pop up on my Yelp and wanted to give it a try. 
Being a new restaurant the place wasn't packed which was nice. My boyfriend and I walked in and we were given a stapled paper menu and also advised that there was a menu on the board. I'm not sure why the menu was separated.  The service was a bit odd as when we were ready to order we had to flag down the waitress as she was busy eating lunch but was the only waitress there. I get it, we all need to eat but it was unusual, but she was very nice. 
We ordered the 2 item combo which comes with 3 choices of banchan. There wasn't a huge selection of choice banchan so I stuck with mainly kimchee items. The banchan can be chosen similar to a buffet style which I prefer. 
My boyfriend had the chicken and kalbi which both were good and decent. We both had the sauce on the side which I always think is the way to go because sometimes sauces can kill a dish. He had the Mac salad as a banchan but it was very bland. The kimchee I had was good. I really liked the radish kimchee. It's your typical well fermented kimchee. 
I had the boneless beef with the chicken as well and it was good/decent.  The marinade for the beef was not overwhelmingly sweet which I like and the sauce for the chicken wasn't too sweet at all but the chicken doesn't really need the sauce. 
This is definitely a go to for fast Korean food if you're hungry and don't want to wait or want a formal sit down. The price is pretty good considering the portion you get as well as the banchan. I think it averages around $13-15. When I want quick Korean food at not a crowded place this will be my go to.",PN4U68T2TPhfATDxiISdKA,0,0,3,xGCZWyCIpOc7uw8Rj9mzTg

I love a place that knows how to prepare traditional dishes from appetizers - kim chee, mac salad, jap chae, bean sprouts, fish cake, and marinated jalepenos- to the main entrees, down to the hot tea/water. 

Our group ordered the Miga Special 1 & 2, Meat Jun plate, and Bulgogi Bi Bim Bap. With the Miga Specials, the rice is separated from the meats that are atop of a bed of lettuce. The chicken and kalbi were cooked perfectly and the sauce gave us the just the right flavors that weren't too sweet or too savory. As for the Bi Bim Bap, I was completely satisfied with eating only half of that enormously portioned bowl. I also tasted a the meat jun and highly recommend that plate as well. The dishes were all pretty much the best compared to previous korean restaraunts I've been too.

The ambience is truly relaxing; lights are dimmed slightly and the music is not too loud or harsh. They have 4 televisions showcasing each of their dishes and 2 beautifully framed photos of South Korea's landscape. The restaraunt is also clean and organized, even their spoons are covered with sanitary sleeves. This is also a smoke free environment with free wi-fi! Not to mention they also deliver via Uber Eats and you can find them on social media (yelp obviously, facebook, instagram and twitter). 

The workers are very sweet and accomodating. They catered to whenever we ran out of side dishes, rice, or beverage. Honestly this place is a tough one to pass by, you should definitely try it out!",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,7,6,5,ZwZCdptcEegQ9aL4WzKZ-Q

I don't think I've ever had hwe dup bab that had the mixture it did... seaweed salad and I think pear slices? Was a little atypical. Seemed more like a Hawaiian styled poke bowl so was a bit disappointed. The sauce was a little too thick too, so it was hard to get a good mix going.

People at the restaurant are super cool and nice, but this 3 star is mostly due to the food. I know this place had really good monk fish stew(?) or agu jjim in Korean. I may have to try it now since ownership seems to be different.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,3,uXbsI16Bvy00kPITcQ4PZw

The place is nice and clean. We got water immediately, order was taken quickly and food came out quick too. They have some interesting dishes but I wanted to try the basic items first to see how those are before trying other items. I got the kalbi with seafood tofu soup (or beef soup), the kalbi came with 3 pieces and soup was a decent portion for one person. I was definitely full after finishing the combo. My sister got beef and tripe bone soup, she said it had a strange sour taste to it (not sure if that is how it is supposed to taste or something was wrong). We usually eat the bone soup at E-jo so this was different. The only complaint is that they only gave us 4 sides..another 1 or 2 sides would be nice.

For the side dishes you get kimchi, macaroni salad, bean sprouts, and etc.
It didn't take long for us to receive our food.

Seafood tofu soup (soondubu) - For my taste, the soup was not spicy at all.  Could have used a little more spice, but it was probably my fault for not requesting for extra spicy.  The soup was tasty, there was a mix of calamari, shrimp, and a mussel.  

Pork katsu - This is a large pork katsu that is served here.  The outside was friend to panko perfection while the meat inside was moist and delicious.  The katsu sauce is good without being overpowering.

Spicy bbq pork - I like this dish the most.  The pork had a good level of spice and had a lot of flavor.  I especially love the onions that sit on the hot plate when they get caramelized.

The tofu soup took forever to come out, but it's ok because the service was great and the soup itself was tasty. Not the usual thick soondubu I'm used to, but I'm comparing it to the best of the best (located in Santa Clara, CA). I really liked all the banchan here. They serve soy sauce egg (one of my faves) and pretty decent kim chee.

Less than 3 miles from the strip and only 2 miles from where I stay near the Rio. This is probably our go-to Korean restaurant out of convenience. It helps that everything here is tasty too :)",uNuPyXHbbtHnhWhPLamESQ,0,0,5,WnUaf2mdYUKQ1O3eUSn5pA
3822756,2018-02-03,0,pidpBdWsOFfe7pWypBIoiQ,"We use to love this place.  It was one of our favorite Korean restaurants in Vegas.  We often visit this establishment.  We have not had any issues previously and the food quality and taste have always remained consistent.  However, I can tell you after this one experience you've forever lost a loyal customer. 

It was extremely clear that they cater specifically to certain people/groups.  Even though there were only two parties including ours it was blatantly clear we were an after thought. 

Part of our order arrived shortly after we ordered.  20 mins passed we still haven't received the last entree.  Another 15 mins passed we finally waived the server down as the entire time she was catering to the other party and never took notice of our needs.  She confirmed that our order was complete which was quite confusing as we are still waiting for the order.  We explained to her what was missing and became quite shocked that she blamed us for ordering the wrong thing!! We thought we were quite clear when she took our order, not only we told her what we wanted, we even pointed to the item on the menu to ensure she knows exactly the one we wanted.  It was incredibly offensive and embarrassing to bring our friends to this restaurant raving about the food and service when the server treated us like second class citizen all while waits hand and foot on the other party. 

What really pushed the experience over the edge was even though we never got what we ordered she charged us for the item and tried to justify that it's because she wanted to give us a discount because the tiny portion of the spicy pork she ordered for us would cost $17.99! WTF?!?!? The owner was also there, he could care less if his customers were treated poorly and didn't bother to care even after the server commented on this mistake.  

Dining out should be an enjoyment.  All while the food can be amazing but being treated the way we did it's unforgivable.  I rather go elsewhere in town in the future to avoid this negative experience.  As much as I would like to give them a second chance i find it hard to justify it in this case.",LBRBfsMpbLZguVJptTUCzg,3,0,1,Gv2IdPw2RqRmQ_3uv4hutA

The restaurant was literally empty and I sat down and asked for a beer and a menu, minutes later a Korean lady walked in and everyone surrounded her and brought her food and tea while I sat wondering if the waitress thought I was invisible!
Such piss poor service that after 15 minutes I got up and left.
This place had a different name a few months ago and most likely will have a different one sooner than later.
By far the worst service I have experienced lately.
There were 3 employees during the time I was there, yet no one acknowledged the fact that a paying customer left and will never return.
After having dined there before I know that their food quality is mediocre but ok for a late night cheap meal.
There are obviously better Korean restaurants by higher service skills.",F9JI-Ehmbo9tae2xghqJMw,1,1,1,bcUxZS2HtOJX5k450H4NHA

It was kalbi and seafood tofu soup combo. My server was a sweet Korean girl. She was nice and did a good job. Their menu they hand out at the table was just on paper, but they also have a menu in the front where you can see as well. It's a clean small cute restaurant. Decorations was nice up front by the cashier. They even have soju :-) . The side dishes were perfect for me. I loved all the side dishes that I got. I love the broccoli with the red sauce because other places just give you broccoli and no sauce. My favorite side dish was their egg! The best! My seafood soup was really good and plenty of seafood in it. It was delicious. My kalbi was good but they give you little meat for the lunch combo. My kalbi only came in 3 pieces of meat, but I'm glad they did because it was just enough for me. I am glad I didn't waste food.

I actually ordered 2 dishes... The kalbi short ribs with the 3 sides, and the bimbop. I love Korean sides. So I only wish I had more. Usually when I eat at a Korean BBQ, I usually ask for extra. Their fried rice is better than any Chinese restaurants could ever be..... suuuupppper good. I'd get a entree sized portion of that (if possible)
The bimbop was good, however, the egg was a bit runnierand still clear in some areas, which is not how I would want my fried egg it to be. My food wasn't hot just warm when I got it so I did have to microwave it, and I did ask for extra chile sauce, and only got 2 containers. I absolutely love Korean chile paste (if anyone has a recipe... let me know).
 I would definitely be interested in dining here and trying different things.

I asked the waitress if that's normal, she asked the guy in the kitchen and he said that's how it's suppose to be. I wish they cared enough to ask if i wanted something else.  But sadly, they didn't.

I was really, really disappointed in the portion of the kalbi beef especially paying $13.99 for it. The flavor was good but it was so small and didn't fill up my bf and I doubt it would have filled me up either. Maybe if we dined in the portions might have been bigger, since everyone else says they've gotten pretty big portions. But then again they're probably just cheap with kalbi beef. I won't order from here again and I won't bother trying to dine in either. The seafood tofu soup was mediocre, definitely had better elsewhere. They only gave me 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 small clams, & 1 oyster. Definitely not enough meat, if I knew they'd be so cheap with the seafood I would of ordered beef or pork. I mean c'mon it was $10.99 for the soup, should have gotten more for my money. The sides we got were kimchi, jap chae, & the mac salad. The kim chi wasn't fermented long enough, it was just thrown and mixed up in the sauce, the jap-chae and mac salad was mehhhh.

2 stars because the waitress is really friendly. Some of the sides are good. Like the kimchi the broccoli with horseradish sauce and the bean sprouts. 

I ordered the spicy garlic chicken. It was blah. The spice was nowhere to be found and the breaded chicken was soggy. I chose fried rice and that just tasted like cooking oil and rice. Not really a good plate. 

My wife had Chicken Katsu Curry. It was good. Chicken was moist and the breading was good. The curry tasted really good too. No spice in the curry which we could've did with some kind of spice. 

Also ordered Spicy Pork. My kid didnt like it. Most of her meat was fat. But she's picky about that..she also said it wasnt spicy enough and she's 9yrs old.
