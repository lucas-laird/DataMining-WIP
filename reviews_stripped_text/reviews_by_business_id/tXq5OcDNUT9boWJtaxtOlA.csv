86036,2014-04-06,2,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"Been a regular at Sierra gold for 3-4 years, a valued guest I had felt for years especially when Homer was the bartender, if Manager Steve as well was present. But a few months ago Homer left and I felt that service at Sierra gold would not be the same. That you're not felt welcomed nor treated with respect. A couple months past after Homer left that I had not visited Sierra gold, one night in September 2013 decided to give this place a chance & we did, but as a to go order! Sat at the bar and was greeted by Mike. Two of us sat at the bar, he gave us 1 menu and didnt offer us drinks. Rude and not appropriate. 
Gave him multiple chances and service at all times with Mike was so bad. He doesn't offer new drinks when your first glass is empty, does not provide silverware when you order food, doesn't check up on you when food is dropped off and you eat. Drops your check off and stands there on his call phone texting for 15-20 minutes until you call him to get his attention. 
He's over all rude. Is extremely selective with his guests and who he choses to take care of and respect. Discriminates and is  prejudice!!! You go out to a bar to drink and eat but simply Hoping to enjoy a simple night unfortunately, this place especially with Mike as your bartender can ruin everything for you. 
Please let him go. It's not worth keeping him. Customer service is not his priority!!
Really ZERO stars for Mike 
5 stars for the cooks especially on graveyard shift , exactly the great workers we forget their names, the ones that matter most, the ones that provides excellent customer service!!! He the cook cares more about me in those few minutes of interaction, than with Mike!!
Never going back to Sierra gold times literally 100 and more guests!! Finding a new local spot!!!",OwpqDtbQqjcSDjVrvctfWQ,3,2,1,A4txWyZiVOaW9nsahu_e1A

Then we received the pizza, was not tasty at all and hardly had any vegetables on it at all and was tasteless, not the mention $2 more than it used to be.

Like any football fan of a favorite team, I prefer to watch my team at a bar designated as a Raider bar. Haven't found one yet to my liking, so I figured I'd just stop in at a place close to my house.

Nice local bar. Very clean and kept up--this is no dive bar. Good place for sports watching--lots of TVs, and a decent amount spread out away from the bar. Food has been tasty so far...they have a decent selection of cheap eats. Beer menu is good--lots of micro brews as well as the usual macro stuff.

Service is excellent--shout out to Lita who's a server there!

Only 1 complaint--they could use a few more drinks specials geared towards the football crowd--but other than that, great spot to watch a game, or to just hang out.",jvmKUjbMarAMRFoxousQAQ,1,0,4,QMSp1quuFm1G6rtOYCZAsQ

975032,2013-04-18,1,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"I have been here several times and have always been happy with what I've ordered.  Sierra Gold is like an upper scale version of PTS so its better than the average fried up bar food.  This time we were strictly going for the happy hour.  What is better than 1/2 off drinks and 1/2 off pizza aaand $2 Dos Equis??  When we came in we were immediately greeted by the bartender.  Off to a good start.  We were seated in the dining area.  The dining area wasnt totally full but had a handful of tables.  The bar area was full though.  Apparantly those are the best seats in the house. ;)

We ordered our Dos Equis-a solid drink and one of us got a specialty drink.  For appetizers we got the Pretzel Bites with honey mustard and cheese sauce.  I love them and get them everytime we come here!  Our friends got the Jalepeno Poppers which they said were pretty good too.  And then there was the 1/2 price pizzas-we ordered 2 (one buffalo chicken and one bbq chicken).  Seem too good to be true?  Yes Yes.  These werent pizzas they were gigantic crackers with over cooked melted cheese on them.  These pizzas were so thin that if you stacked them on top of each other they would still be thinner than my cell phone (Galaxy S2 mind you). LOL  They weren't awful but no one really was ready for the no crust crunchy cracker pizza unfortunately.  

The service was ok. The only time we saw our waitress was when she brought us the food.  We actually went to the bar to order another set of drinks instead of waiting for her. The bartender chicks were very nice and took our order right away as soon as we walked up.  BTW the girls outfits are totally cute. ;)

Now I would have given them one more star because their food has always been pretty consistent from what I remember.  I just thought for the pizza ""happy hour special"" that brings people in would be a little more than we expected.....You get what you pay for I guess....a 1/2 price pizza cracker. LOL  I'm not mad at it, I just will get something else next time....and some people might like a crunch to thier pizza.

Random:  the pretzel bites are the bomb. I love them.  The seared ahi tuna with the wasabi sause is amazing, the wings are yummy and their sandwiches have always been good. We will for sure be back.  Half price drinks are always a reason to go we will just skip the pizza and order what we know. :)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,1,3,9lo6Qg5QlamuVTTDCBU5hg

2361227,2011-01-19,0,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"The first time I came here with my boyfriend, it was really late at night (midnight), so it was pretty quiet.  We ordered the stuffed jalapeños.  If I recall correctly, we only got a few and it was sort of pricey; I don't think we're going to order them again.  The bartender that was working that night was really awesome; he was really friendly and talkative.  He was always checking if we wanted another drink just as we were finishing our current ones.  I'm not a huge drinker, but I decided to give the soju lemon drop a try (I do like soju).  When I downed that, he asked if I wanted another one or if I wanted to try something else.  I didn't know what I wanted, but was open to anything, so the bartender said he'd mix up another soju drink for me.  He said he could make anything.  When he came back with it, it was different, but I liked it.  I forgot if it had a name, but it had some ginger and maybe basil in it.  I forget what else.  He said my second drink was free because I'd been gambling the whole time I was there (didn't lose much. :D).  I don't suppose they do that for everyone, so I thought that was really nice.  I didn't get his name, but he was a stocky guy and I think he had spiked hair. 

01/22/11 Edit: After a recent trip there, my bf said that he's not liking this place so much anymore cuz the last couple of times we were playing video poker and stuff, none of our drinks got comped, but we get them comped at another bar we go to (read further into my review).  Guess it's a more common practice than I previously thought.

Anyway, for our second visit, the female bartender wasn't so friendly.  She wasn't rude or anything, but she just gave us our drinks, the menus, and came back occasionally to check if we needed refills.  It was also a slow night.  I thought she'd be more attentive then, but nope.

The last time we were there, about a week ago, we'd gone on the weekend and it was so busy.  The first two times we were able to sit at the bar, but we had to find a table this time since it was so packed and we even had trouble finding one of those.

I can understand people being short with others if they're stressed or busy, but I've been working in customer service since I started working back in high school and I've never treated anyone like that before, no matter what kind of mood I was in.

The waitress we had seemed like that when she asked for my boyfriend's ID after he ordered a drink.  We dismissed it at first because of the high volume of customers, but I started getting pissed when we waited half an hour for the check.  She just didn't come to our section of the restaurant.  When she did, she spent those five minutes chatting it up with some people in the corner table -- people she knows, I'm guessing.  We probably could've asked one of the bussers or gone up to the bartender or something, but we weren't in a rush and we were very involved in a conversation anyway.  Still, though, we were keeping track of where she WASN'T coming and for how long.  I think she's the same waitress that Tony H. mentioned in his review.  The good thing about this visit was the Cheeto's onion rings.  If you like hot stuff, I recommend you try them cuz they're breaded with Flaming Hot Cheeto's.  Make sure you dip them in the sriracha for the additional heat (it's the thicker sauce; they'll give you a sweet one, too, which is watery, but also good).

The next time (next three times actually) we went out for drinks and food, we went to Five Star Tavern a few blocks south on Aliante and had a much better experience.  (See my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/five-star-tavern-north-las-vegas-2#hrid:Yr1UAjXPkb0HJ3tyz4m-Xw)

Someone else mentioned the architecture in a review (looks like it wasn't here; forgot where I saw it).  I thought it did look pretty neat, but at the same time I thought, WHY would you have the beams that go from the floor to the ceiling also go through the tables (see the picture that someone shared here to see what I mean)?  That's wasted seating right there; they take up enough table space for a person to sit at.  I thought it the first time I went, but since it was so busy during my last visit and there weren't many spots available, I was really wondering why they decided to do that.

An okay experience overall (except that one waitress who hates her life).  The food's pretty good.  On top of the onion rings, we've had the tuna melt panini, caesar chicken wrap, bratwurst, cheeseburger, and chicken fajita -- not all at one time, of course. :P  It was all good.",Ylnzp7o02wCziyMdHmN8Tw,1,1,4,6S60J2RBXdMb9t1s87FBrA

We were just minding our own business when the group of people came up out of no where and just started harassing us. Then when we went to pay to get away from these crazy people, it took FOREVER for them to bring us back our card.

The first time the waitress didn't even greet us she just said ""are you drinking anything"". Luckily it was busy and another waitress with an actual personality ended up serving us. She was awesome. Then we went last night with a large group and we had called ahead letting them know. They had a nice area blocked off for us. But...  We got the rude waitress from the week before. She refused to leave menus after we ordered. She literally took a napkin out of my hand to clean up and told me to get another one. Maybe she was obsessive compulsive but she was so rude about it. Not a single person in our party of 10 had a decent experience with her. The saving grace was the gentleman who helped her out delivering the food. He was pleasant and accommodating. For such a nice spot, Sierra Gold should really reconsider allowing the woman server to be around their patrons. They just lost 10 because of her.

My coworker and I went to this place and he ordered BBQ chicken pizza. He recommended it because apparently when he had it the last time (about a week or so ago), he said it was BOMB!  The pizza came and my first thought was, ""wow, that smells like BBQ"".. and as it got closer, the BBQ smell was just fumigating. Well, the pizza was a thin crust flat pizza and had red onion and pieces o white chicken meat and had mozzarella cheese on it. It was simple enough, but they over did it on the BBQ sauce. 

Would I go back? Yea, I went here before and had their chicken pesto panini and that was BOMB!

Perhaps the next time i try that BBQ pizza I'll make sure they go easy on the BBQ sauce =P..

3072139,2018-03-29,3,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"Wow. The place is pretty, but don't expect ""high end"" as they tout on their website.  It's basically Timbers with much better atmosphere. 
We joked from the start that our waitress hated us but it became clear that it wasn't a joke, she actually did hate us, or maybe just her job. We're pretty happy go-lucky so we can handle a hard attitude; she reminded me of my BFF, I actually texted my BFF and said she should never be a server Lol We laughed it off, we weren't here for her company anyway. 
To bad the food was terrible. We had the potstickers (which were the best dish despite being a bit on the spicy side), artichoke dip (excited to see it come w crostini but surprisingly the chips were way better than the bread. The dip itself was so-so), and I had the fish and chips which were very bland (but the fish was better the next day in the toaster), I hardly touched the tastless fries which was a big part of why I ordered fish n chips to begin with. 
Then we made the huge mistake of ordering dessert.  We wanted it to-go but were told we couldn't get 2 (out of 3) desserts to-go due to the fact they are served in Mason jars. This is crazy to me. I get it, it's hipster cool, but I've had other restaurants that do it that way know how to send their creations to-go. I asked if they could just pour it into a to-go container and that I wouldn't hold it against the chef (I mean, it couldn't be worse than dinner, right?) So we ordered the chocolate cream pie and chocolate chip cookies.  We had already paid our bill and were just waiting on desserts. After 10 minutes our server walked by and said ""Have a good night"", we reminded her we were waiting on dessert, ""Oh right, let me go check on that"". She came back and told us the cookies are baked to order so they take a bit (anyone whos ever baked cookies knows they take 12 mins tops. And anyone whos ever worked in a restaurant that had a made-to-order dessert also knows to mention the wait time to the customer at some point!)
After 20 minutes SO tried to get her attention to ask about dessert to which she snapped back (across the section) ""Sir, the.cookies.are.made.to.order!""
After 30 minutes we got our desserts. 
The chocolate ""cream"" pie is pudding (with whipped cream and crumbled grahams). Although, the kitchen did know how to make it to go, very nicely packaged in a soup container. The chocolate chip cookies were good, 4 thin cookies fresh from the oven (probably take about 7 minutes to bake).

$80 for 2 beers, 3 apps, 1 main, 2 desserts.
Unreal.
Better off throwing another $30 to that and going to The Melting Pot for a fine dining experience where the staff treat you well and the Chef aims to please.",QKfZqCzMdAz9CTYrhC5DjQ,4,2,1,KDtwVqZmtmUj7hMmzQ-m2Q

3304212,2012-07-26,0,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"The happy hour at Sierra Gold is what makes this place worth the outting.

Sierra Gold can best be describes as a high-end PT's and it really is. PT's own all of the Sierra Golds (I think there are a total of 3 of 4 in Las Vegas) and really positions SG as the chains more fancy or nicer bars. 

This particular location is located right off the 215 on the SW side of town. Its easily 5 times the size of a traditional neighborhood bar complete with an upstairs private room which can be rented for special occasions. 

The main reason that I and really any of my friends come by is for the cheap drinks and pizza during happy hour. The late night happy hour which starts at 12am every night takes half off all the drinks and the pizza at SG. This makes SG the perfect place for a late-night excursion or cheap eat after a night of going out. Like most bars, the regular price drinks fun anywhere from 6-10 bucks, which turns into $3-5 during HH! Thats awesome! On top of that they are a pretty good selection of beers on tap along with some great specialty drinks.

What brings in a lot of people of course is the food. The pizzas are also 50% off during happy hour and they are worth it. The thin crispy pizzas pair pretty well with any late night munchies you get. They have enough combinations of toppings and sauces to satisfy even the pickiest of pizza eaters. I wish they had other foods on the happy hour because pizza is not really up everyone's alley.

The only downside I have noticed to SG is their abysmal service when the place gets busy. Come in on a weekend night and it you have to go search for a server to bring you drink and food. I understand that because of the discounts, the servers don't make as much and probably don't want to work as hard, but that is still no excuse for poor service.

All in all its a great place to check our if your looking for cheap drinks and food.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,3,1,4,nRtALfUSuixjN9PHJSFarQ

Pretzel bites
Turkey Panini (add bacon and tomato)
Steak and eggs
Cajun (dry rub) chicken wings
CooCoo chips
Caesar Salad (w/med rare steak)

Basically it is a fancier version. We got to enjoy Happy Hour from 5-8pm on a Sunday with 50% off Pizzas and drinks . The food was actually really decent for the price and the Service was EXCELLENT. My biggest issue was the fact the bartender never took a card for a tab so basically my friend and  I ended up getting toasted and having a huge bill that we had to try to allocate fees. It would of been a lot easier seeing as we were two females for him to ask if we wanted separate checks or together. We were sitting at the bar with a large group. The one thing to his credit was if you don't have their rewards card you get $5 off your bill so it brought my total down to like 80$ so that was exciting. Don't forget to ask about that if you go in!! Honestly it is a Glorified PTS but the vibe is really nice and the staff is super friendly... I give it four stars because I would go back again...and probably spend the same if not more money and still have a good time. To me if a Bartender is friendly it makes the world of difference but if the whole staff is HAPPY it proves they love their job and want to work for their tips so definitely had a good time!!!",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,1,1,4,WCWRcxwz7acysPACzXeOGw

The inside of this place was pleasing to the eye, and it was very clean. We received good service, and the customer base was relaxed and laid back. 

Everyone there was just kicking back and having a good meal.

Which brings me to the food itself. I had some fish and chips and I have to say they were amongst the best I have ever had. They were delicious and it was a very reasonable serving.

4963894,2014-11-29,1,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"It has been a few years since I have been to Sierra Gold and decided to give it a try since it is around the corner. It is a great place if you want to have drinks, watch sports and smoke cigarettes and enjoy some bar food.

I have asthma so I am limited to restaurants that allow smoking. I asked the server if there was a non smoking area and was directed to the designated area. The filtration is ok but two hours later I began to cough and my clothes smelled of smoke when I arrived home. I realize that taverns want to cater to the smoking crowd so I will not return to this establishment due to the air quality.

The food was ok, we ordered the wing bucket that included fries and they were good, however the fries were over salted and I attempted to rub some off on the plate. I am not sure if the sauce on the wings were salty or the salting of the fries landed on the wings. My friend wanted to order a beer and apparently there is no list and the server had to recite the selection. A beer list is nice so one can peruse the choices instead of being put on the spot to order. The majority of people would not be able to recite the selection if they decided to order a second.

While my friend was in the restroom I requested the check and paid for the meal and included the tip, the server was great and made this happen without my friends knowledge. When I went to the bathroom she asked my friend if we wanted another drink as she was ending her shift and another server would be taking care of our table. My friend decided to tip her, she did not mention I had already paid and tipped her. She was tipped $13 for a $24 dollar meal. There was no excuse, so unprofessional. 

The Happy Hour is not worth it unless you like pizza, that is the only food item offered, drinks are 50% off. I am gluten intolerant and they do not have a gluten free pizza which I understand, but there are no Happy Hour options for me.

I will personally not return, but if a neighbor asked me where they could have a drink, smoke and play pool I will refer them to Sierra Gold. It is a great place to watch sports with their large screen TV's",LgiBFHIsRWIduc7HTq2rkA,2,0,2,hzqTXk9JEjOLyb887wbH0g

5278342,2015-05-18,1,tXq5OcDNUT9boWJtaxtOlA,"Sierra Gold's is owned by the vast enterprise that is PT's. Compared to your standard PT's or Sean Patrick's bars, Sierra Gold's is more upscale. It's just down the street from Aliante Casino and largely caters to the male military crowds. What I like about Sierra Gold's is that 90s rock music videos are streamed alongside your usual sports events. Heck yes to Nirvana!

The exact same famous PT's Happy Hour is offered at Sierra Gold. 12AM - 2PM and 5PM - 7PM will get you 50% off drinks and pizza with select $5 apps. From 6AM - 10PM, you can also get half off breakfast items. 

I ate at Sierra Gold's for breakfast for the first time recently, and won't come back for my morning meals. The breakfast was definitely easy on the wallet, with 4 of us dining for about $32. The quality of the food was disappointing though...

THICK SLICED FRENCH TOAST ($6.99): Zero flavor. Three slices of french toast but any hint of the powdered sugar, maple syrup, and cinnamon was just not detectable. 2/5

MINER""S BREAKFAST ($7.99): This was supposed to be their 'specialty'. A skillet with eggs, potatoes, sausage, ham, peppers and onions. Poor presentation and a VERY small portion of food. 2/5

SIERRA GOLD PLATTER ($7.99): 3 eggs with choice of bacon, sausage, or ham. The meat items come with 3 pieces. For some reason, they refused to do half orders?? So if you ask for bacon and sausage they'll say nope, you can only pick one. :/ Comes with a side of toast. 3/5

Worth a Return Visit?
Skip breakfast here but come for drinks during Happy Hour! The service is better than most PT owned bars and the bathrooms are clean and way fancier. Sierra Gold's is a solid local's bar to chill at.
