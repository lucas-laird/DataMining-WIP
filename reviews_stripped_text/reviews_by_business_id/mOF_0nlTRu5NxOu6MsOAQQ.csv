Service: people are very nice and helpful in trying to help you make a decision 

Order: dry noodle beef: less traditional than what I am used too and heavy sauce 

Xlb: peanut taste is different than what I am used to but good.

1935620,2017-06-12,1,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"I know Ding's Garden well as I lived in S. California for many years and have eaten their food many times. 

This is their first venture to the Vegas area.

This restaurant is in a large strip mall with ample parking. The place is easy to spot.
The decor gives you a clean impression -- metallic tables help. Servers try hard, but they still have to learn a lot about the menus and their specific job functions, e.g.:
1. Ordered Braised Duck Shanghai Style -- wait staff brought us Salted Duck. When we rejected the Salted Duck, the wait staff insisted that it is the Braised Duck.( Braised duck is with a red color glaze, salted duck is plain ). Finally, it was resolved. But the wait staff should be able to distinguish the difference right away.
2. Inaccurate ordering -- we ordered a Rice cake Shanghai style and a Spicy Wonton. When the order receipt was brought to our table, it shows two orders of rice cake but no wonton. Although it was resolved easily, it really should not have happened.

The wait staff errors can be improved but some guidance and teaching will be necessary.

Since their opening, I have been to this restaurant four times. There are some dishes that are wonderful, just like what my mother used to cook -- the Shanghainese way. Unfortunately, there are dishes that were not as good:

Braised Beef Tendon - Excellent, the best in Vegas.
Gluten Puff Shanghainese style - ordered three times, all great.
Marinated Cucumbers -- twice were good, third time was tasteless. 
Xiao Long Bao, Onion Pancakes, -- always good.
Spicy Wonton -delicious in taste but the wonton skin is too thick. Try pan fried Wonton instead.
Pan fried Wonton -- great. 
Halogen Spiced peanuts - twice were very good, third time was dry and tasteless.
Fried Stinky Tofu - stinky alright. Do not order this unless you are used to the taste.
Grandmother Drunken Fish - again, not to be ordered unless you are used to the taste.
Braised Duck Shanghai Style; Salted Duck - both are too greasy. Taste is ok. But not appetizing due to the fat.
Salted Chicken SHanghai style - I will avoid that. Not my favorite. 
Beef noodle soup and other rice and noodle dishes are all decent. 

Service and consistency of food quality is an issue. They are experiencing some growing pains. I sincerely hope that all the issues can be rectified.

A 4 star rating is about right for me.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,0,0,4,7ZnbMUUmB99npQ0HH4qjsg
1956668,2017-05-25,0,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"So I found this little place on my way to work and saw the ""Grand Opening"" sign and naturally I had to try it. 

I walk in and immediately like the look. There's about 15 tables (vary in size) that have that steel look to it with two flat screen tvs displaying the different dishes behind the cash register. A more modern clean look. 

The menu has a TON of items, average price is about $10 and the servings are rather healthy size. I ordered the Beef Brown Sauce Dry Noodle (N5). I was impressed by the portion size of the beef and how tender it was, served with the large bowl of noodle. Good thick chunks and the onion was very fresh! It's hard to screw up noodles and thankfully they didn't! I think I'll be coming back to try more of their menu!",jn8cZzUX35ceMbdZ583jjg,0,0,5,N9FRnnB2GQuwq6AIo-MfVQ
1981807,2017-06-10,0,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"Was very impressed with place. The location being where it is I did not expect this place to be so nicely and modernly decorated. Very clean and quite spacious, lots of lights and tables and chairs were clean, does not look like a typical Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. 

We got the cold plate which was really good, nice portion, a little spicy and was a good start to the meal. My sister wanted to try the stinky tofu...it smelled bad but not terrible. Came with chili sauce on the side and a sweet black sauce, tofu is nice and crispy. Tasted just like regular fried tofu, nothing special. 

The dandan noodles...sooo good! Noodle tasted fresh, chewy and soft, the bowl has a strong peanut smell but did not taste overly buttery if that makes sense. It was creamy and sweet but not to where you get sick of it easily. I'm usually not a fan of dry noodles like this but this was so good. I could easily eat the whole bowl myself and be satisfied. 

The soup dumplings were delicious. Not as soupy as I would have liked, the soup didn't come pouring out like the ones at Din Tai Fung, but the meat inside the dumplings were very juicy. Great flavors, sweet and smelled delicious. 

Fried dumplings, we thought these were pot stickers but they were little baos fried at the bottom. I have had these at so many places and although they have always been good, I was very impressed with these ones. At other places the bottoms were lightly fried, its a little brown and thats it. These were legitimately fried at the bottom, so crispy and crunchy, while the top part is soft and fluffy and the stuffing is also delicious. Everything you would want in a fried dumpling, a little crispness, softness and amazing flavors. 

Overall, very impressed with this place. The decor surprised me, the services was good enough, food was really good. Can't wait to come back and try other items.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,2,4,OmPlVHFN91AJXyeoUhqA6w

2967227,2017-07-04,0,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"I don't know why a previous review said this place was expensive because even my Asian mom said this place is cheaper than the other places and that's always good if you're not eating your wallet empty. 

First thing that came is the gluten puff in shanghai style. It showed a picture in the menu and it came a lot smaller in real life. It tastes very good, tons of flavor coming through, especially the star anise. Just a tad bit on the salty side. Dish comes cold. This dish also comes with PEANUTS. 

The second dish that came is the shanghai style braised duck. Also very tasty. It comes cold which results in firmer meat but it's fine. 

Third dish that came was the pickled green mustard and pork pan fried rice cake which was extremely salty. Server also forgot to give us a spoon with this dish. It also came with a few pieces of pork. You have to balance the greens and the rice cake or else it's really a mouth full of salt.

The last thing we ordered I am still waiting for 30 minutes after the last dish came  - the shanghai dumplings also with peanuts. I think they forgot our order. We finished all of our previous dishes and it still had not come out. These dumplings are a little bit more doughy than I am used to.

The duck and the chicken came out in less than a minute (Wow!). They were ice cold but the lady owner said that's how they eat in Shanghai. It was A LOT of meat for the price. Good source of protein but was way too salty to my taste.
Soup dumplings were OK. I think I had better soup dumplings at Wendy's Noodle Café (same shopping center). 
The service was very attentive. They spoke good enough English so no problem ordering stuff.

3942269,2017-06-18,1,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"Wow.. Good service, good food,  what else could you all for?  Oh yeah... How about cheaper prices?

For a casual restaurant this is a place that you won't be afraid to take your caucasion friends to.  There are no hanging meats or animal heads anywhere. 

We ordered the cold tossed seaweed, Dan Dan  noodles and the Shanghai braised duck.

Seaweed. $5.95.  Compared to the price it was quite pricey.  The dish itself was a little too strong in DC weed flavor. Yep I know that sounds stupid to say that a seaweed dish that you order is too strong in seaweed flavor. However for those that have had this dish you know that it's almost too strong of an ocean flavor. A little too strong in seaweed flavor. Yep I know that sounds stupid to say that a seaweed dish that you order is too strong in seaweed flavor. However for those that have had this dish you would know that sometimes there can be an ocean/seaweed flavor that is too strong. The vinegar dressing is alright but there did not appear to be any garlic or green onion in it.

Dan Dan noodles $8.25. These noodles also came in a small portion.  There was no meat. The sauce was spicey, peanutty and delicious.   Surprisingly not too oily.   Guessing instead of chili oil, they put some type of green chili.  The noodles themselves were thin and actually al dente.  

Shanghai Braised Duck. $11.95.  For the price and portion very fair.  I'm guessing the duck was boiled and then chilled to minimize the fat and tighten the skin. (Warning to readers.. this is not a weight loss technique.  Please do. not boil then chill your bodies... you won't be able to find a refrigerator big enough. ).  Three duck is then drapped with a thick braised soy sauce.  It's sweet, savory and delicious.  For you Chinese yelpers, if you were lucky enough to have a good cook for a mom,  she probably made a braised chicken dish like this for you.  (Sauce had star anise).

4331534,2017-10-01,0,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"Oh Ding's, where have you been all my life? Lol. I was the one to put this location on the Yelp map and haven't been able to stay away from it since they opened. We usually come here at least once a week and order the same great dishes. The fried pork chop (lightly breaded with a tempura like batter, super tender and lightly seasoned), the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) as well as the cold dishes - spicy beef tendon and beef tripe (they are topped with cilantro and chili oil) are our absolute favorites. Steamed stinky tofu is good here also if you are into that. Most places in town that even have stinky tofu seem to only have arrows option so it's a little different.  Any of their fried rice dishes are good too - I think it's all in the wok and how screaming hot they get it - but yet it doesn't have that burnt dirty wok taste.

I could go on and on about this place but you should probably just try it for yourself. It's not your typical Chinese fare - it's a shanghai style restaurant from what I've been told, so some of the other lower rated reviews from other yelpers that may have been expecting your typical Chinese fare may not be entirely accurate for this place. For example - the cold chicken dish as well as the duck - are supposed to be served cold in this instance.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,2,1,5,BJwXoE1pwYJI1fFiqX5xPg
4843219,2017-06-09,0,mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,"I never know when a new Asian restaurant is opened unless my Asian friends tell me about them. Ding's is one of them. We decided to come here to try it out after the first week of grand opening and I'm so excited to report that it's definitely worth giving a visit. 

Located in the shopping plaza as 168 supermarket, it's not too difficult to find. You are given menus and an ordering sheet with a pen, then you get to work! 

We had the appetizer #2, I believe. It's the one with the bean curd, pig ears and tripe. It was perfectly seasoned with chili oil, sesame oil and cilantro garnish. Even my white friend couldn't stop eating it. 

The Dan Dan noodle is a little different than the Dan Dan noodle I'm used to. Ding's is more peanut based but it was still really flavorful and enjoyable. 

The Shanghai rice cake was good, not spectacular but then again I think it's hard to find spectacular Shanghai rice cake in the States. 

We also had the pork chop and pickled greens with fried rice. I thought the pork chop was a little dried and the dish can be avoided the next time around. 

The braised beef in the beef noodle was very tender and juicy. I usually don't like braised beef noodle because the beef is usually very chewy and get stuck in your teeth but that didn't happen with Ding's. 

The xiao long bao, steamed dumplings, were juicy and flavorful. But the dumpling dough was on the thicker side, which can be a turn off to some. I didn't mind it. 

The service was relatively good. You have a couple really hard working employees and then you have a handful that kind of daydream around, which I think is typical for a new restaurant.

Out of all of those, we only liked the cold meats and the pan fried buns. The stinky tofu was just stinky without any flavor behind it and the xiao long bao didn't even have liquid in it (also cost over a dollar per individual bun).
