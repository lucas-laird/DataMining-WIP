Yes its a dive, Yes its in a corner hidden away.  SO ARE DIAMONDS.  This place rocks.  Drink specials are great The TVs are positioned the right way and people are friendly.  I'm not saying its the best but it is a cool place.",36zFGA3MaUGspiN8WhHJgQ,2,1,4,KiS7zbOSwosjW36zobkrfw

I should have known that the relationship was doomed from the start.  Pitchers of swill and bad bar food just didn't cut it for this Yelper, neither did watching sports or hanging out here.",8zp4gAptFQbmJTHszbntLQ,4,4,1,KEnbzid2jcl-gDb1Mm1izw

A definite must if you are in the north Las Vegas area. Owner is very generous as well, good chance you will meet him if you come in.",gr5gqzio4yk1UhPuktYrYQ,0,1,5,tFLqdgUozvSNEtJwm0mHXA

Monday/Wednesday/Saturday nights you will find myself and my family there playing with the free poker league. It is a great place because the bartenders are good people, fun to chat with and always there to keep you smiling and with fresh drinks in hand.  They have pool tables, dart boards (electric), Mind Teezers, and even though they are a Chicago Bear bar I don't mind watching my Boston teams play while I play poker. 
If your looking for a local pub to sling back some good drinks/drafts and play/watch some games I would recommend Smoke Ranch Junction.",5WfQRase7TmG7wyDyAvxCw,1,0,3,Vq0Lf1LuBu4q80SyvJsQVQ
