I've gone here a total of three times in the past month for a quick fix with my siblings and he's gotten our order wrong each of those times. He must be new, but he does seem genuinely sorry after he adds or subtracts something from our order.

Regardless, he's not why I give this McDonalds 1 star.

This place is usually jam packed with teens by 1pm during the school year and during the summer, just can't catch a break.

Frankly, it tastes like a bigger Big Mac. Sadly, it carried on with the burgers that tasted microwaved from a precooked batch. The fries were fresh and very good. 

Also, they make you order from a new Kiosk. I didn't care for that and needed help twice. They need to keep a worker ready to help those of us who appreciate old fashioned counter service.

The drive-thru can be PACKED, and with the layout of the shopping center, this location won't be getting the two-lane drive thru makeover even though it really needs it. When the drive-thru is busy during peak breakfast/lunch/dinner times, I usually go inside and it's never been very busy inside. The staff inside usually isn't as nice as the drive thru staff, but they're still pretty great!

Anyway, ended up going inside this time because the drive thru line was long. It wasn't too busy inside. They were quick to take my order. When I went to fill up my drink with sweet tea, the dispenser was empty. One of the employees saw it was empty and immediately came to refill it! AWESOME service.

The inside is always clean and the lids/straws are always fully stocked. The flowers on the tables create a nice ambiance. The decor is a little outdated, but I am a fan of those late 90s/early 2000s fast food interiors.

There are a few people I can think of who are not morning people and should not be working the drive through, but I can't really choose who's working the window. The wait time depends on when you actually order. It's a little longer in the morning when everyone is off to work and when people are getting off work.

Have you lost your mind, do you have a death wish.
Since the product was available I have always ordered it at various McDonald's locations and never knew that it wasn't actually a menu item. Until I visited this location and I was told no. They did not seem to be bothered by the fact that I was upset by this and I left empty-handed. I later find out it is something they could do they chose not to. Way to take care of a customer. I find it strange that they would not make this coffee for me when in fact they alter my other coffee request all the time. Which is a mocha frappe caramel top instead of chocolate.

3577003,2018-01-22,0,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,"This McDonald's is practically across the street from my house and I've been going probably 2-3 times a week for 3 years now.  Honestly, all my prior experiences have been good, which is the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one.

They've upgraded the interior and drive thru, and installed the kiosks for ordering.  The kiosks have been around for a week or two, so any kinks in the system should have been worked out by now but unfortunately they have not.

I walked in and was not at the counter or a kiosk, but on my phone looking through the McDonald's app at the deals.  Within 5 seconds of entering I was accosted by an employee directing me to go to a kiosk to place my order as she started the order process for me.  That alone was enough to make me want to walk out, but I did not.

I spent a minute or so figuring out which deal from the app I was going to use and then went to the kiosk.  Using the kiosks is easy enough, but quite slow.  I have a Ph.D. in computer science and am all for using technology to lower customer wait time and increase the company's bottom line, but it was not a good experience.  In any case, at the end I said I wanted to pay at the kiosk and instead it printed out a ticket and told me to pay at the counter.  

I go pay and then I wait... and wait... and wait.

It was not that busy and I repeatedly heard staff telling people to use the kiosk to order because it goes directly to the kitchen.  All I ordered was one sandwich, one order of fries, and chicken tenders.  After nearly 20 minutes I finally get fed up and go to get a refund and even that took several minutes as the manager couldn't figure out how to refund me minus the deal.  Apparently I'm going to get an extra $1 back because of that.

From the time I entered until the time I left was 25 minutes.  I left without food, with an extra dollar (allegedly), and to top it off literally as I'm walking out the door they announce that my order is ready.  I'll note that I was not the only one who was still waiting for food when I left either.  There were others there the entire time who had placed orders right before me who were still waiting when I left.

McDonald's, or at least this location, is shooting themselves in the foot.  Increasing the wait time by 3-4x the usual, costing themselves money because they don't know how to issue the right refund amount, throwing away food because people are getting refunds since it is taking so long, and, perhaps the most important thing, angering long-time customers such that they won't return.

I'm sure McDonald's as a giant company will be fine.  I'm sure this location will be fine as well.  However there's a lot that's gone wrong here and needs to be fixed tout suite.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,wC80VATX3R3ciZdOLslOeA

I've been to a lot of these drive thrus in my day and it always seems like this one late at night is always off. They are always doing something else other than paying attention to the window. And if always seems that the food has been sitting for quite some time. Oh well I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.,SP0Kz0EtEMPcYhIscukXTg,0,0,2,zdD-fg-JbeuwtyO90W-4jw
4989617,2012-08-30,2,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,I was just there a few days ago.  I ordered my daughter a kids meal thru the drive thru.  The women at the first window was very nice and professional.  When we drove to the next window to pick up our food the women just handed us the juice then handed up our kids meal.  The whole time talking to fellow coworkers.  We saw only the back of her the whole time.  No hello no thank you or anything.  It was the weirdest thing.  My husband and I were shocked that happen.  Sorry Mcdonalds we were bothering you.  The funny thing I think she was the manager because she was wearing a different color than everyone else.,TzsT2aAH5o0nxidz00NiYg,3,0,1,nMhR9uQ3HuHGChDTeblLMQ

5214215,2016-04-06,0,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,I went here this morning and the service by one guy(youngish black guy working the order window) was absolutely terrible. He took my order so rudely and I had ordered an iced vanilla latte. I got to the pick up window and they gave me a hot drink so I asked him if I could have it iced and he was very nice and let me know that they didn't make iced lattes so I asked if there was a way I could just have an iced coffee then since the guy I ordered from didn't tell me there was no iced lattes. As the nice guy went back to get me an iced coffee I hear the first guy in the back talking so much crap about me saying how he read my order back(which he didn't) and that I ordered a hot coffee and that I was a liar and he was right and I was wrong. Which I get it I work in customer service and we're always annoyed by customers but he's literally saying this all two feet away from me. Thankfully the guy made my coffee fast and was very apologetic about the mix up other wise I would have gone right in there and talked to the manger. 100% not going back here.,_SqBu5GLWKCqTQ5AYVsUaA,0,0,1,-sP9zOL_QaINuon42W2gxg

5393538,2018-01-30,0,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,"I came in on Sunday Jan 28.2018
It was a wonderful experience.
There were mangers on the employees asses to get stuff done quickly and correctly. It was great to see them actually working. In the 15 years leaving in the Las Vegas area I have always been disappointed with all fast food chains.
It's normal to wait a full 2 minuets to just get greeted.
I have walked out of plenty of fast food chains because of it.
I my self have worked in fast food so I know that greeting the costumer is done as soon as possible, and only make sense.
Hope this McDonald's stays on track and shows other branches how to get work done.

P.S. just want to add that I love the new drive through and I wish all of them had an intercom system. The face to face thing is just so they can be lazy and not work hard to get the orders off the screen in a timely manner",1plJ91VIwUaaT8yRzGfPBA,0,0,5,oaLs55UFvlYNh6fEpwXWnw
5492160,2013-08-08,7,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,"Make sure they put everything, you've ordered, in the bag before leaving! We went through the drive-tru and ordered six burgers (we were both hungry).  We get to the second window, and the guy handing my boyfriend the bag repeated the order, but he said five burgers instead of six, so my boyfriend said, ""How many? Five?"" And the guy said, ""No, six."" So, we drive off without checking how many were actually in the bag, and when we got home, we find out there were only five. Ugh!!! And we did check the receipt, and under QTY - 6!

5535812,2015-04-28,1,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,"Something needs to be done about this location. .. never go here for breakfast!  It's so crowed. Drive through and inside. Its so bad that cars on are the main road trying to get into the drive thru.  Its also attached to a gas station so that makes it even more crowed. 

I asked for my breakfast burrito without cheese.  The cashier said ""no prob"" turns out, the burritos come frozen and they just heat em up... yuck.

THAT Will teach me to not eat fast food.

5940947,2016-07-06,0,XBIgiDL_sXYOroaX4ULaUw,"I was not happy with this McDonalds at all. One of my biggest things is customer service and they lacked this. They refused to serve breakfast when the clocks at 10:32. Now I understand that when they have a cut off time they have to abide by it however this was on a Saturday when they are supposed to serve breakfast until 11 a.m. when I questioned why they would not serve it at 10:32 she insisted that they stop at 10:30 and that every single breakfast had been wrapped up thrown away and they had a ready moved on to lunch. Even if this had been a weekday and breakfast ended at 10:30, I highly doubt that 2 minutes after the time they had completely closed up everything for breakfast. They were not even willing to apologize or offer some sort of explanation. I blame the management for not properly training there crew. The food however was decent.",WcmMeT_3fnjJniILAg7jHA,0,0,2,cPH3v_tYxSkpz_W_Wa-A4g

I would rather drive 5 more miles then eat here ever again.   Several of us will not be returning.  Service is terrible. Order is always wrong and clerks are rude.
