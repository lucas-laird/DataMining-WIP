Unfortunately I was disappointed.  I got some fried mushrooms, and the catfish and chicken combo.  The food was of good quality, but it was bland. Really bland.  Because of that I will not be going back.",3pavDkxevZEENdJ9jvl08w,2,0,2,5iyl78XpvZkmWUoVCrEcjA
1882765,2011-01-17,1,nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ,"Im glad we mentioned Yelp to the nice lady working here. I asked do you know what Yelp is? She goes no, whats that? And so me and the gf explained... long story short, we mention Yelp and we get a free shimp and fries basket along with our order and free drinks! OK, on to the next one...

As soon we walked in, its super clean! Really spacious with couches and tables spread throughout the open floor.  and 2 big screen TV's to watch while waiting for the food.  They had alot to choose from the menu.  But when i go to  a new southern cooking style restaurant... AHEM, excuse me, chicago style cooking, i gotta try the wings, and so i did.  they came out really hot! It was good, but it wasnt that good.  Maybe its just me, but the wings were just a LITTLE TOO moist, maybe if they kept the wings in the fryer a little longer they wouldve been perfect.  I noticed all the orders had 2 pieces of wheat bread beneath all the food.  Gotta have something healthy with it, right? 

Portions are really big here.  If you eat here for lunch, you'll have enough leftovers for dinner. The hot sauce is bomb, not spicy but with a little kick.  

It's ALL FRIED EVERYTHING but sometimes you just wanna eat some good crunchy greasy goodness!  This is definitely a good alternative to the spot i go to in the bay area.",wLc6l8v7O9hXjrDi3Q7tyw,3,2,4,gHr-ATujuQAu4BR553BtFA
2052679,2010-12-27,5,nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ,"""If there's such a thing as ""food for thought"" then it's close cousin must be the ""food for the soul""."" - Aljamin Santos (c)

We dress our Sunday's best every Sunday to Church because we want to be presentable to a Higher Power. Whether or not you believe in such as a Higher Power aka God, we will find common grounds in Harold's Chicken and Fish. Tracy at HC&F's beliefs are parallel and very evident that she believes in dressing the great food served here in it's best and highly presentable in her very new location on West Cheyenne. Barely a Las Vegas local, Tracy came here about a month and half ago from Southside Chicago taking along with her the deep and fresh tastes from Chicago with her version of Chicago's soul food! Don't be fooled-- the other Harold's are owned by different folks!

A few of my friends and I planned to get sandwiches, but when we were waiting to turn into the plaza, my gf mentioned that HC&F has a sign saying ""NOW OPEN"". I honked at my brother and with all my knowledge of sign language, I frantically tried to signal him to look at HC&F's sign! Little did Tracy know, that the reputation of HC&F precedes them and we've been waiting for them to open for quite a bit of time already. We walked in and started to take in the place. The entire restaurant is likened to a very large dining room with 2 flat screen televisions, sofas, chairs, plenty of tables, and jazz decor. The menu is self-explanatory but if you have questions, Tracy would be very happy to answer them. When we walked up, I asked what ""perch"" was. I've never heard of it and Tracy was so kind and generous to give me an explanation and offer a sample for me to try it! That's hospitality! :)

After we ordered, we sat for no more than 7 minutes until our food arrived. We were the only customers, but 7 minutes for all the food we ordered came out to us brought by Tracy herself in pretty good time! We ordered the catfish and dark meat chicken combo. The combo came with 3 catfish filets, 1 leg, 1 drumstick and some fries. It didn't come with a drink though. That'd be nice if it did :) The catfish was fried in a corn meal kind of crust and had just the right amount of that fish-y taste and flakiness. Tasty, indeed! The fried chicken wasn't very different, but reminiscent of Popeye's. Popeye's is one of my favorite chicken places, so for me to say it's like Popeye's is a good thing. Fries are fries so there isn't much to mention about that. However, the perch, is something I'm new to and am probably going to replace catfish with it! Tracy's description of the perch was spot on: more meaty and a little bit saltier. Prepared the same as the catfish, the perch's flavor really broke through and collided with my taste buds!

Tracy was very hospitable to let us try some of the perch already, but just when you though that was it, she came through with some freshly cooked shrimp that were te size of prawns! She told us to give them a try and let her know how they were. So, this goes out to Tracy: ""The shrimp and perch was the BOMB!"" :D This particular HC&F has potential to become something exceptional and definitely a local favorite! The space inside is large enough to host a live band on Friday or Satirday nights! Just a few ideas! :) Not only did the food have soul, but Tracy and her crew straight from Chicago had the spirit in them today too! I look forward to out next trip. Next time, we're bringing the whole crew down!",bTTZzC8RvTxTOeGMvJ5icQ,11,7,4,24LJj4KD8HfLc85TdynOvw
2667020,2013-05-15,0,nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ,we ordered chicken combo and small catfish dinner for 2 of us. were shocked with how much food we got. fish fillets huge. took home food will have another meal out of. people that wrote bland or nothing to write home about are nuts! catfish was best we ever ate. way better than hush puppies and chicken also some of best fried chicken ever ate. portions are huge. people you gotta try this place it's fantastic!,meNwwy5rQlGFl6oD3qpZBA,1,0,5,qMvvO1JXATslPv80cMMiaw
2887044,2011-02-21,3,nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ,"Did they go to Chicago to get our chicken & fish because it took friggin' forever to get our food! About 35 to 40 minutes to be exact which would not have been that bad had it been good - it wasn't. The chicken was bland and the only thing that made it OK was the crispy skin and the mild hot sauce which was way too sweet.  The fried catfish on the other hand was fairly tasty and the meal itself was huge. I would come back for the fish, but as far as the chicken goes, Popeye's is much tastier & quicker too. Way too expensive ($13.99) for a forgettable meal. Go back to Chicago, Harold & take your bland chicken with you.",11gxVnIOvxL5PI4Ur9qa2g,1,0,2,NE-ARqzcaIcXzKsZDOWuJg
3829459,2011-01-10,10,nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ,"A couple of weeks ago, I passed by this shopping center in my neighborhood and saw the sign ""Harold's Chicken, Now Open!"".  I thought to myself ""That place sounds familiar, where do I know it from?""......a couple of weeks go by and I forgot about it.  

Then, the other day I was starving and looking for a new joint to check out.  I looked on my Droid Yelp App and started doing a search for places....that's when I saw a review from Aljamin S on this place.  As soon as I read it, I remembered where I saw Harold's Chicken before.....in Southeast Chicago a couple of years ago.  I get really excited and call my friend in Vegas that's from Chicago who took me there.....he got excited and told me to get over there ASAP to check it out.

When I pulled up, I saw a sign that mentioned they were from Chicago...I got excited.  I asked the cook who was standing next to the cashier if they were the same Harold's Chicken from Chicago...he said yes....JACKPOT!

I eagerly ordered the 1/4 Chicken Dinner w/White Meat & Hot Sauce (2 Wings, 1 Breast, Fries, on top of a slice of White Bread, $5.99) and a Pizza Puff ($3.15).  After a short wait, they brought out my meal.....I opened up the bag with the Chicken and the smell of the Hot Sauce burned my sinuses....yes!  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Chicken and Fries drenched in Hot Sauce with the White Bread on the bottom to soak in the flavors was just as I remembered it in Chicago.  The Chicken was delicious and full of flavor.....my Hot Sauce tolerance has elevated since the last time I ate at Harold's, so the Hot Sauce tasted more mild to me than I remember....but it was good!  The Fries were soggy with the Hot Sauce....I forgot they did that and would have preferred them dry, my bad  I should have asked them to do that.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!

Next was the Pizza Puff....if you've been reading my reviews for a while, you'll know I love Pizza Puffs and will order one any time I can find it.  They serve the Il Taco brand Pizza Puffs here....which is what I'm familiar with from Chicago.  mmmm......Pizza Puff goodness, yes!  If you are unfamiliar with a Pizza Puff, imagine a wallet sized pocket of Pizza Dough, with Pizza Sauce, Cheese, and Sausage in the middle.....it's not a Calzone because the crust is much thinner and it has a distinctive taste and flavor to it.  It's also deep fried....although you can bake it as well.  Anyway, I suggest you try one if given the opportunity.

Overall, it was an exciting day.  I called all of my Chicagoland friends who are transplants in Vegas to tell them about this place.

Will I return?  Oh yeah!",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,15,17,5,JBApBm-f-Zz_gs84HGq0rw

She asked for my order ""what you need"", from the back side far behind the wall of the cooking area. It took 15 minutes to get luke warm food. I DO NOT like cold french fries...YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The setting of the restaurant was nice. the seating area is huge. This place has lots of potential but you have to step it up a noch because Harolds in the CHI is bomb... and they are the namesake..",xnUxSVqRn9cBnOPhtkDxyQ,1,0,3,0xu92uXVr7cb76aAyz_Hhw

Sounds kinda funny, but I've been sick and the antibiotics made me even more crappy and the first thing I could think about was I want some fried chicken. It did hit the spot.

The BF and I shared:

A combo of white meat fried chicken & fried perch which was 3 big filets of fish, a breast and wing, 2 slices of white bread, and a handful of fries- plenty big portion. I was happy to find perch since I don't really see it often. It was pretty noms- fresh tasting and was juicy. Fried chicken was tasty with a good crisp and seasoned batter. Fries are pretty standard. 

We were curious of the pizza puff so we got also a pizza puff w/ fries. I've heard of it and finally got to try one.... it's like having a meat lasagna baked into a puff pastry crust. I'm not necessarily the pizza pocket type, but pretty decent stuff and I get why people like it. 

Drinks aren't from a fountain, but are bottled sodas. They do have a decent selection though. 

I saw they have fried livers and I kinda have a weak spot (probably literally- a nice and clogged spot) in my heart for that. I do wish they have gravy to dip em in, but that's just a personal preference I can't hold against them too much. Maybe I'll bring my own. 

Will be back for more fried fare!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,5,4,tkhkWk0Oj6HMq4XjPlmOwA
5361325,2011-05-31,0,nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ,"**Summary**
       - Breading - For their catfish, they use cornbread breading, but it isn't as flavorful as catfish alley. With that said, it's still a very good catfish.
       - Portions - The portions are humongus. The Lg. Catfish Fillets comes with five gigantic catfish. They're twice the size of other places.
**Price**
       - $20 fed four of us and we couldn't finish.
**Ordered**
       - Large order of Catfish Filets (5) - Five delicious, gigantic fish fillets with cornbread breading with french fries and a piece of toast.
       - Side of Okra - The okra is good. My favorite place for okra is still church's (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ?select=4_Ru-8uSrii9KihGoVSxgw).
       - Large order of gizzards - A bit too little seasoning, but it was still good. This also came with french fries and a piece of toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nupAsas-_hc8225O_5APMQ?select=DkSR9q6z7Kmp-oOjwEjqCQ).
**Recommendations**
       - Compared to the other catfish places around town, I have to rank this second for flavor, but definitely first for value. I still prefer catfish alley's catfish for their incredible spices in their breading. As for value though, the filets here are twice as large and the prices are alot lower.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,1,4,R0BJOZuG8tVy4vdnjbUO5g
