5773,2015-08-24,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Very nice classic style steakhouse. A great view of the strip at night when seated by the window which we asked to be moved to as another group finished before ours was served. They had to inquire first and then were happy to oblige. Very Friendly service. 
As for the meal two of the four dishes had to be sent back, one was an overdone Pork Chop Porterhouse which they replaced and was spot on. 
The Rib eye ordered med-rare was blue, they took a second stab at it, put it in the oven, and brought it back on a clean plate. I guess that's ok ?
The other plates were a hit, a NY Strip and a Cajun chicken, which were nearly finished by the time ours returned. 
Not a disaster but there are too many steakhouses in Vegas to be coming up short like that, hope it doesn't happen often.",vQ0fqKaoq9yU5N1jluwHjg,0,0,4,6I_kY0R9solwFHYsVuJ1OQ

77043,2017-01-15,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,Literally the best filet mignon I have EVER had. Medium rare PERFECTION! The vegetable de jour was tri colored carrots and they were cooked and seasoned exactly to my liking. The rice pilaf and garlic mashed potatoes were average but who cares when the rest of the meal  (including the salmon) was fabulous. Bonus: went on my birthday and our server  (Kevin - who was very friendly and helpful) brought out a raspberry mousse dessert that I thought I was too full to eat but fought my table mates for because it was amazing.

91800,2011-04-23,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"The view is really, really fantastic. I went in the early evening so there was still light outside so the restaurant wasn't dim and you could see the mountains and all. You can go up to the restaurant in a glass sided elevator, which is kind of cool and makes you feel like you're exiting the chocolate factory. The wines aren't overly marked up (I usually stick to the same few cabarnets... kind of shocking when there is a $30-$40 difference on the same bottle of wine in the same city), and they can actually cook seafood. I ordered the tuna with the wasabi sauce and it wasn't seared on the edges and missed patches like most places, but actually cooked. While not a cheap meal... with the view and the quality, you can do a lot worse in Vegas. Next time... chicken fried lobster!",NyOgb7sM_sdkhQqlpPj5bA,1,0,4,di4qMOcPedxn2cvN_zS34w
106654,2010-08-24,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Yeah, it was okay. Probably won't go out of my way to get back here though. 

The goods: The view was great. Our party was seated in a corner so the two views were even better. The decor is great, a real old school throw back feel. Hmm, what else, that's about it. The lobster bisque was fabulous. 

The not so goods: The service was just weird. One minute there are three staff huddled around the table, 20 minutes later they're completely disappeared. I had the Chicken Fried Lobster. Obviously this sounds really good...but it just tasted like chicken. It resembled one very large chicken nugget but without the hot mustard. I could have saved an awful lot of money by going to McDonald's instead. Girlfriend had a steak and forgot to order any sort of sauce on it. It really didn't taste like much. I was pretty glad that it didn't show up on my plate. 

Not really sure why I'm giving the 3 stars. I guess we had a good time and that's really what it's all about. 

Overall I'd say save your money if you're on Fremont Street and go to Mermaid's for a fried Twinkie and a hot dog. Oh and don't park in the Binion's garage, what a fiasco!",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,0,0,3,qq3Ef7ouYRgCNaQ4CR_7vg

130079,2013-09-04,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I really wanted to like this place. The service is good and the ambiance was great, but the food was lacking. After reading about it, me and the boys decided we had to try the Chicken Fried Lobster. What's the worse that could happen? Well to answer that, no seasoning. This was a nice piece of 8 ounce lobster pan fried in bread crumbs, no salt, no pepper, no garlic, no basil, nothing (at least you can't taste any seasoning). They serve it with warm drawn butter and a horrible orange colored sauce. When you think Chicken Fried you think of big flavor and this missed the mark. This could be a great dish, but it just isn't here. I sprinkled salt and pepper on it, but it only helped a little. The sauce they serve with it is bad. I did get an awesome loaded baked potato, but that's not what I came for. Lobster bisques (decent, but needed more lobster), salads, and the entr√©es, were about $250 before tip (no wine). We should have hopped a cab to DelFrisco's, Kraftsteak, Gallagher's, or just walked and tried Vic & Anthony's. I tried to give the old steakhouse a run, but I will not return unless it's to take the elevator ride, have a drink and get a great view of the city with someone who has never been to Vegas.",1V-nbABbKNQMyaSRKSGhBQ,0,0,2,5FFEzXAad4PsTx01Pz8Q_w

We had been very happy customers who enjoyed many wonderful meals there.  Tonight we were in town, and went back to Binion's  only to have a very different experience.  I ordered a porterhouse steak along wtih their mixed greens salad.  I have to agree wtih a previous reviewer, who found their raspberry dressing more resembling a cloyingly sweet, dessert offering than a salad dressing.  After which came my steak, served cold.  (no sizzle here)  My impression is that the quality of the meat was of a very different caliber than the excellent product previously served.  It seems that gone, were the ""prime"" or apparently even the ""choice"" cuts of yesteryear.  Our waiter while very pleasant, was typically ""lost in action"". He was absent for very long stretches, save for the times when he wanted to clear our plates prior to us finishing our food.  This was really a very disappointing dining experience at a restaurant that was former favorite.  I do not think that I will venture back here.

We showed up on a whim and the gentleman said it would be a 45 minute wait.  Then he asked if we wanted a booth (doesn't have the table view but I think a booth is more comfortable anyway--and we could still see the city).  When we said yes, he took us right away to our seat.  The service was fantastic and the food was great.

I ordered the filet mignon well done and it was cooked perfectly!  The garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful as well.  The asparagus was a little salty for my liking but this was hardly a setback.

246793,2009-05-19,2,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Visit: 5/13/09 - Dinner.  Ate the Prime rib, porterhouse and onion soup.

Onion Soup was watery.  No onion taste at all.  The cheese on top was good.  The soup came cold.

House Salad had rasberry dressing that was too sweet.  Tasted like frosting instead of dressing.

Prime rib was good.  The portion was big, but the meat tasted old.  I am not a beef expert, but maybe oldness came from aging the prime rib longer than most places for better taste.

Porterhouse was good.  Pretty dry for a medium rare piece.

Service was bad.  They put a bottle of water down on the table and expect you to pour it out by yourself.  We also asked them to have a seat next to the window and they said that the tables were all reserved.  There were only 3 other couples in the whole restaurant.  They were just being lazy donkeys.

Prices were very high.  For the taste of the food, not worth $40 for prime rib.

535233,2013-11-14,1,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"So disappointed. This was supposed to be THE steak dinner of our trip to Vegas. I am not really a big steak eater but my husband is so I really wanted to take him somewhere delicious and perfect. This was not that.Yes, there is steak and it tastes good. That is about it. 

To start, we ordered two glasses of cava - Freixenet so nothing even sort of fancy which came in twist off splits which the waiter proceeded to open, pour, place the bottles on the tables and the caps. Now, I know when you order a bottle of wine you are supposed to leave the cork so the diner can inspect it to ensure the wine wasn't compromised in the bottle however I am pretty sure there is not a lot of value in inspecting the caps of cheap cava so to start our meal, we were sitting in trash. 

We we started with the escargot and a wedge salad which were good. We ordered the fillet and the new york strip. They came with a veg and a choice of baked potato or mashed potatoes. I opted for baked while my husband got mashed. The veg was a pile of greasy green beans and the potatoes were potatoes. The steaks were well cooked. 

The real issues were the service, ambiance and the steak accompaniments. It is dark, there are booths and there is a great view (sort of and from some seats) but it isn't warm or cozy or anywhere that I would like to linger. The service is efficient and that is it and the sides are pedestrian at best. 

I would probably have rated it a 3 if it wasn't so expensive. The price for what you get is horrible. The cost is comparable to all of the other steak houses on and off the strip and I would definitely recommend going to one of them.",hcnL04OtvkDQvBVXFYw25g,1,0,2,rJw-SdELP7LL2hHB5A5z2w

For starters, they serve so much bread throughout the meal, one could fill up just on that. We ordered the artichoke dip: tasty but, a bit salty. My husband had the onion soup, again tasty but, too salty. I ordered the lobster bisque that came out with what appeared as and tasted like Yorkshire pudding, big chunks of lobster but, again, too much floured filler. My husband ordered the filet mignon medium rare and I ordered the smaller sized prime rib also medium rare. His steak came out still mooing. We told our waiter and he apologized and had it ""re-fired"". It came back looking exactly the same. The waiter checked in on us again but, we weren't going to have them try for a third time to get a $50 steak correct; too much man handling and frankly a steakhouse should know how to cook a steak in the first place. The waiter again apologized and told us the chef was sorry and would like to offer a complimentary dessert. Their desserts consist of various pastries (aka more baked goods).

615355,2012-01-27,6,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"One of Las Vegas's best kept secrets!

This place is NOT for everyone, so Donkey tourists and jack ass belligerent people that have no class or self respect please......STAY AWAY!  This is the BEST prime rib you will ever have, it gives ""Lawry's"" a run for the money.

Located at the top of historic Binion's Horseshoe Casino, this place is truly old school and is literally the LAST of the old Vegas restaurants.  When this place finally goes, I am through with Sin City forever (Vegas was only good when the mob ran it) 

Those that have no fear of heights should take the old, creaky, wooden elevator surrounded by glass up to the steakhouse, it is a great view of Las Vegas and has room for only 4 people.  During the beautiful but scary ride, one will only be thinking, ""God I hope I don't get stuck in the elevator or that I don't plummet to my death"".

Once inside, the restaurant is darkly light, supplies a beautiful panoramic view of Las Vegas and is decorated with classic red booths.  One will feel as if they are in a mobster film and are about to be ""whacked"".  

On to the food, the dish to get is by far the prime rib!  Their prime rib is out of this world delicious and is consistently amazing!  There are 2 cuts of prime rib to choose from: The ""Benny's Cut"" (Named after owner Benny Binion) is a GIGANTIC cut of meat the size of a toilet seat.  The other cut is smaller but still a dinosaur chop!  Your prime rib will come with a choice of sides, I highly recommend the garlic mashed potatoes.  

For those who are not ham hockers and want to eat a civilized size meal, I recommend the lobster tail.  This tail is one of the best I have ever had and I usually will add it to my prime rib to complete my meal.  They claim the tails are only about 8 oz. but they are always wrong, they are so large they are a meal on their own.  

They have a good wine list and full bar so no need to worry about finding the right drink to compliment your dining experience.

The staff are all old school and have probably been there since the beginning but this is a GOOD thing.  Being an avid Poker player I always like to hear the stories of the greatest Poker players of our time, as they have all dined here at one time or another.  Players that include Stu (The Kid) Unger, Doyle Brunson, and Johnny Moss.  When Binions owned the WSOP, it was a tradition that the winner each year was comped his meal here in the steakhouse after the week long tournament finally ended. 

The bottom line is this place not only has a lot of history, but also still delivers an amazing meal every night.

622665,2011-05-13,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I agree with most of the reviews that Binion's is old school vegas steakhouse atmosphere. Great view, dark and classic.  Waiters were accommodating and professional.  
Food was okay, good not great.  We had the ribeye and new york.  Both were cooked to what we ordered but was tough and the new york was on the thin side.  The crab cakes had a lot of bread crumbs and was ok.  The ahi tuna appetizer was sent back because the tuna was cooked all the way.  They did replace it with tuna that was pink in the middle.  Not impressed.  The french onion soup was the done well but the lobster bisque was on the watery side but had large chunks of lobster in the soup.  A little pricey for the quality of food, must be paying for the view.",Ql0LPk8wwgP3Hc7hJR4q4w,0,0,3,jbKpucYzDLwSOo-z4vIX9Q
645917,2016-08-02,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Great place to eat and catch an amazing view.  We made reservations for a party of 17 about two weeks in advance and these guys were great.  I dealt with Donny on the phone and ""Team Kevin"" (waiter and assistant were both named Kevin). Everything that was put in front of us was amazing...apps, soups, salad, mains and dessert.  Everything was perfectly cooked, flavorful and well presented.  It's not easy to accommodate a large party, but these guys did it.  If you spent all your time reading reviews on where you should or shouldn't go, you'd never do anything.  This place was ""Old School Vegas"" all the way, I loved it.  I'd give 5 Stars in a second, but there was a problem with the A/C so it was a little warm, (we had a few pre-menopausal women in the party...they don't like a warm room).  The only other critique that I'd make, was the lack of music. I like a little ""background music"" for dinner ambiance.  Kevin said they usually have it on, but didn't that night for some reason.  Anyway, go check this place out, take the waiters recommendations (a good waiter won't steer you wrong), feel the rich history, enjoy the incredible view and taste wonderful food in an atmosphere of a different time in this cool Vegas Steakhouse.    

One last thing I forgot to mention...since we had a large party, the tip was already included in the bill.  I didn't see it, (a few glasses of wine, and 46 year old eyes), I tipped on top of the tip, (by a lot of money),  Kevin caught it before we left and he refused to ""keep it"".

708958,2010-11-30,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"This is a quintessential old school Vegas steakhouse. They've renovated the interior but the charm is the same.

I decided to try this place out because I was curious about the Chicken Fried Lobster on the menu. How can you not try that once? I've been back several times since, taking friends and dates and never had a bad experience with the restaurant.

The Lobster is definitely a must try, I've never had an instance of it overcooked or over breaded.  If you're looking for a good appetizer, the crab assortment is quite good too.  Desserts vary, last time I was there we had a cobbler with an Irish Cream Creme Anglaise - so good.

You have a main server and an assistant who is attentive without being intrusive. 

I've also had dinner here on Fourth of July. You could see the fireworks down the strip and around the valley.  Great place to watch them for sure.",n_UPZoewzbnOUU8TfDPYyQ,1,1,4,znbfYo7d9A4Zt2y-WURbRg

763920,2009-06-06,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"My friend spoke of only one thing over and over again in Vegas, and that was this restaurant.  We finally get around to it on our last night there, and it was worth it.

The first thing that stands out is the genuine service.  No force pleasantries or idle chatter.  When they come up to your table to check on you, you get a quick question and a nod and then they're on their way to leave you alone.  They've been there a long time and they know what they're doing.

The second thing that stands out is the great food.  For starters I had the shrimp scampi - jumbo shrimp in a garlicy wine sauce that mopped up with my bread.  The rest of the table each got the lobster bisque, which was pretty much devoured after a few minutes.

I ordered the rack of lamb, which was tender and flavorful.  The ribeyes my friends got looked and tasted fantastic.  There was really nothing on our plates that didn't get eaten - including the mystery vegetable that everyone asks about.

For the miscellaneous, the view from the top floor is great at night, being at one of the highest spots in downtown Las Vegas.  The value is decent - you'll get full for your money.  

I really didn't think this place would match up with Hugu's Cellar (which I really enjoyed), but it surpassed my expectations.",ypnF_lhgwLAamrE7AN7gDg,1,0,4,7QN-5IXdk8fwmsWV2zq2jg

The $45 New York Strip I had was tough, fatty, chewey, and without seasoning. I make much better steaks at home. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes from a box. They were runny and tasted old. Terrible. The host and hostess were in the middle of a heated disagreement. Could not have been more unhappy with a meal that cost $150+. I will never go back.

Now, on to the food.  I'm from an area where they know how to prepare a steak.  These steaks are outstanding, at least as good as anything I can get back home.  I had the Blue Cheese Steak, which was a NY Strip Steak with some melted cheese on top.  Very good.

1131790,2011-07-21,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I'm sure Bininos Steak House was a great place back in the '80s but this establishment is way past its prime. Granted Binions has become that place to go at least once if you're in downtown Vegas, mainly because of what it used to be and not so much of what it is now. 

Of course the glass elevator taking you up is nice way to start the evening. Then the view is very cool at night. The restaurant it self is very dark and your typical old school steak house...dark woods, deep read banquets and carpet, and white table cloth. 

The standard steak house starter, lobster bisque, had a decent flavor, but was gritty and the lobster meat was tough. This bisque definitely missed the sieve. The medium rare rib eye was perfectly cooked and I wish I could say the same for the flavor. The steak had zero seasoning. Although a juicy cut of meat, it lacked complete flavor. To top it off it had zero char. It appeared as if the steak was cooked on a backyard grill you bought at the grocery store. The Cabernet sauce was an attempt to add flavor, but the artificial taste from the sauce did not help much. As for the sides, it did not get much better. The beans were obviously frozen and not fresh, and the roasted potatoes were mushy. There was not much that could save this sad plate of food. 

Desert was a last chance to have a decent bite in the restaurant but the creme brulee, although cooked very well, tasted more like eggs than sweet vanilla. 

Service was awkward and inconsistent.

The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic with the spectacular views but the food and service left much to be desired. I work in the service industry so tend to be a little less critical but I was incredibly disappointed in Binions. 

While our group was sitting down, one member (who happened to be visiting from another country) stood next to the window to take pictures and our server hovered over our table trying to take drink orders. He was clearly annoyed because she wasn't paying attention and he had to wait. We were there around 8:30 and there were maybe 3 other couples in the restaurant so it's not like he was that busy...I don't quite understand why he didn't step away and give us a few minutes to settle in before taking drink orders.

Now on to the food...I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for the steak but the seafood was awful. I'm from Seattle so have a taste for good, fresh fish and this restaurant did not have it. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and when the plate was set down in front of me, the first thing I saw was two slabs of gray meat. I kid you not, it looked like liver. Unfortunately for me it tasted as bad as it looked: dry and bland. And the sauce they chose? Yeah...it did not compliment it at all. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but didn't hold a candle to The Keg's. 

Maybe it was an off night for Binion's but this was my first impression and with that being said, I'll never go back. The way I see it, they should treat every customer's experience like it's their first and ""wow"" them so they'll come back.

1218649,2010-04-05,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Everything was absolutely fantastic. We happened to be in Vegas for business and had plenty of time to fit in some fun as well. While looking for dining options I stumbled across this place on the Fremont Street website. Out of curiousity I was checking out room prices @ Binions and noticed they were no longer accepting reservations. After reading Yelp reviews of this restaurant and other review sites I knew we just couldn't miss our (maybe only) chance to dine here before it (may be) gone forever. 

We made reservations a month in advance because we really hoped for a table with the fantastic view we'd read about. We didn't anticipate how long it would take to get our car from the valet at our hotel or factor in getting slightly off track on our way causing us to be late. We called the restaurant to inform them of our delay and we were told ""no Problem"" When we arrived about 20 minutes later we were told by the hostess that we would need to wait now as our table was given away and there was nothing in the computer regarding our courtesy call that we were running later than expected. She wasn't rude exactly just very blunt and unsympathetic. No problem from us - we are late and have no issue with waiting. Just as we decided to head to the bar for a cocktail while wait ing, she whispered to us that she will go ahead and seat us even though there are walk-ins now waiting. We greatly appreciated this and it made up for her slight indifference upon arriving.

We did not get a window table, but our view was outstanding anyway. We were nearly in the middle of the room with panoramic views on 2 sides. It really was gorgeous The atmosphere here is has an old vegas feel almost with the low light and the table linens and set up, the deep booths. It just has a great feel to it. It's not just fine dining it is Classic dining that isn't necessarily seen in Vegas as often with most restaurants having a gimic of some kind. 

I do agree with other reviewers that have mentioned the darkness. I could use maybe a second wick on the table candle for a little more brightness. But you do get used to it and I found it enjoyable and liked the sense of an intimate dinner for 2 even when surrounded by people. My only real complaint was that a table adjacent to us had several people visiting them that weren't dining there and they were very loud and intrusive and distracting and in the way of other diners getting to their seats. I felt that the party should have been asked to take the conversation to the bar or hallway just a few short steps away So not to disturb the rest of us.

But let me get to the good stuff. Service was fantabulous. I never needed a single thing as every need was taken care of nearly before I asked without ever feeling like the waiter was hovering. I like the bottled water served, although it should be kept on ice as I like my water very cold. The wine menu was very extensive and not extremely overpriced. 

The onion soup was wonderful. Perfectly oniony. Perfectly cheesy. Perfectly salty. the shrimp cocktail was also wonderful. It was served old school style. Very large shrimp perfectly chilled and not wet served on a bed of cabbage (or lettuce - too dark in there to tell) And on a separate platter you get saltines, a huge portion of horseradish, lemon, cocktail and remoulade sauce as well that I didn't try, I was too excited over the horseradish.

We both had NY steaks with the cabernet sauce. the steaks were exceptional. I don't feel like I am exaggerating when I say it may be the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked just the way we asked with just the right amount of char on the outside. The cabernet sauce was nothing special, but a very tasty thick brown gravy with a bit more depth. The baked potato was good and the the roasted red potatoes were tasty but not exceptional. the same with the veggies. But I must say this over and over again. The steaks were perfect and exceptional. If you are looking to forget the sides and just be wowed by the cut of meat and amazing grill master in the back then this is the place for you.",JhSogvx8BZdClHkLe0_ReA,1,0,4,vrFR-fbf4Wrj-PQH8Q7d0A

We had a couple shrimp cocktails for the table.....great size, but not the best quality.

Tablemates had the Wedge Salad, and pronounced it excellent.

I had the ribeye medium(was more like medium rare), fully loaded baked potato and sauteed carrots., price was around $50,00, and completely worth it  I ordered the peppercorn sauce and that was a yawn, but am looking forward to trying some bernaise next time.

I got exactly what  I signed up for, an old school steak house experience. Honestly, our waiter said he has worked their for 30 years and said countless others have been there as long or longer. All the staff there was very friendly, professional and efficient in their work. The old school vibe was spot on for us, everything we were hoping for. Just had the feel that the Rat Pack was going to roll into the corner booth any minute. We started our meal with Oyster Rockafeller. Holy spongebob was that some good seafood. Can't go wrong starting with this. We also split a Ceasar salad. I'm not one to get to high or low on a ceasar salad but I've got to say this is probably the best i've ever had. That ceasar mix was very unique and tasty and there was a lingering good aftertaste that just kept me longing for more well after the salad was gone. For my entr√©e I had the 16 oz prime rib seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. My wife had the fillet mignon with equally impressive results and taste. I am so glad we went do dinner here. I sincerely hope old school joints like this retain their charm, elegance and great food for many years to come.

Anyway, I ordered a steak and lobster, market price of $72 dollars. You'd expect a steak house to know how to cook steak right? Steak was very hard, almost like a very bad cut and over cooked.

Probably at the end of our meal, manager comes around asks how things are doing? Steak is over cooked I say, and he asks if he could make up by a dessert? I say no, he asked for another steak I say no, we had a show to attend so we didn't have time to sit around any longer. 

Long story short they should've taken the steak off the bill as it wasn't cooked correctly, but they didn't. 

I was weary of going here to dine in, and I should've trusted my gut instinct.

As I sat and enjoyed my cocktail it was clear that many of the customers were here for the first time as was I and it was also clear that some were here because this is their go to steak house whether that's because of the reasonable prices, the atmosphere or the steaks cooked up on the well seasoned grill that has satisfied generations of gamblers, entertainers, or just the locals that never ventured far from the strip.

Decision time I wanted to keep it simple a wedge salad, baked potato with butter and a giant juicy medium rare rib eye steak no fancy sauce or grilled veggies just rub a little salt and black pepper on both sided and let the flame lick it done throw it on a plate and bring it to me hot and juicy.

Came with green beans and potato (garlic mashed were delicious). Everything was fantastic. Bill, with tip, was just at $100.00. Desserts looked wonderful, but we were too full to partake.

The restaurant is top floor of Binion's casino. So after dinner, we went downstairs to the casino which opens up directly onto the Freemond Street experience. Great place to walk around and take in some eye candy after dinner.

The main elevator on the casino floor was out of order, so we had to use the regular hotel elevator. Once we got upstairs, I realized that the elevator that was out of order is the one that goes up the side of the hotel. The out of order sign that was on the door inside the restaurant looked more permanent so I wondered if it was ever going to be working again. While we were waiting for our table, I was looking at pictures hanging on the wall and saw a picture of that old elevator from outside...it looked pretty cool. The restaurant has the old Vegas feel to it and usually I'm a huge fan of that...but I felt the bathroom could be updated a little. It looked dirty but I couldn't tell if it was just because it's old or if it wasn't cleaned that often. 

Our waiter was extremely friendly and gave us suggestions on what to order. I ordered the filet and a huge loaded potato. It was the biggest potato I have ever seen! People walking by our table even commented on how good it looked. Luckily, the potato was filling because the steak was horrible. I took maybe two bites. (that's very unlike me!)

1502413,2014-03-16,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Our reservation was for 6 and the ma√Ætre d showed us to our table and acknowledged our anniversary. We didn't bring our own bottle and decided against getting wine. I got a Stella and my wife requested a Mojito but our waiter was quick to let her know that the bartender ""sucked"" at making Mojitos and talked her out of it.

We each ordered a Caesar Salad to start and they came in these bowls that were oddly shaped in that they were very wide on top and narrow on the bottom (contacting the table) that it was nearly impossible to cut the wedges of lettuce into edible portions without the bowl tipping over into your lap. Also there was WAY TOO MUCH Caesar dressing.

My wife went with a 16oz Prime Rib that was served with bone in and a Baked Potato ""with everything"". Fair warning to all that ""everything"" included bacon and cheese which she was not expecting. It was well prepared ""Medium"" and was very good. The crust was super good.

I ordered the 16oz Rib-Eye (Medium) along with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Well first off, it was no where near 16oz and second it just didn't look appetizing at all. It was charred on the outside and when I cut it in half straight down the middle there was no pink what so ever. In fact it was so over cooked that it wasn't even brown in the center, more of a grey.

Now I never send food back to a kitchen. I have seen too many news specials about what goes on back there. But this was not edible IMO so I broke that rule and sent it back requesting a new one. Oddly though I had 2 different people come and ask what was wrong and if I wanted it well done or something, as if they thought I was complaining that it was undercooked. So 3 different people were informed that I wanted it medium.

The waiter returned a short time later and let me know that if I wanted a new one that it would be 15-20 minutes and asked if I would like to change my order to something that would come quicker since my wife was already enjoying her meal. The first thing that crossed my mind was ""if you are spending 15-20 minutes cooking a steak to medium, you are doing something terribly wrong. I then agreed to change my order to the Prime Rib since I had a few bites off my wife's plate and it was very good.

Mine though came out a smaller/thinner cut than hers and without the bone. It was also much more of a center cut so I got very little of the awesome crust that was all around hers. It was tough and just not good. I suffered through it though and ate the thing. The Garlic Mash on the side was OK but not anything better than I have had at Sizzler.

They did bring us a complimentary dessert and again acknowledge our anniversary.

Bottom line is next year we will be back at Texas de Brazil. Why mess with something that works. We will never go back to Binions Steakhouse. I would have been much happier at the Buffet in The Fremont across the street.",HvjtIvQJOqklbpHzz_Tc3A,5,1,2,iLAK534JxYWx-jEZhfsndQ

 Lucky for us nobody else seems to know about the place- we practically had a wing to ourselves. 

 I started with the escargot- WOW!!! Never thought a crawly thing could be such a butterlicious thing of delight! Could have eaten 'em all night. Unlike the previous poster I thought that the french onion soup was amazing- not to salty, thick with onions and the crispy cheese was PERFECTO.

My tour of the vintage steakhouses continue. For those that don't know this is one of the oldest steakhouses in the town and has been kind of the crown jewel of the Horseshoe for years.  As an aside, we here on Valentine's Day so it was probably much busier than a normal night.

Ambiance 5 Stars -- This is the reason you come here.  The room is cozy, with amazing views all around no matter where you are seated.  Dark (not too dark), wood panelling,  

Drink -- There is actually a bar in here where you can wait or I presume get appetizers but we didn't go so I can't comment.  The wine list was nice, not extensive, but you can get pretty much all you need.  Surprisingly, the prices were very reasonable compared to other restaurants of this quality.  I was a bit surprised there wasn't a sommelier here, but there could be had we not been on a busy night.  As an aside, I believe you can bring your wine with a Corkage fee, but I forgot so didn't get to test the theory.

Service -- Five Stars -- the staff is excellent, there when you need them but not always there.  The waiter and busser seemed to work quite well in tandem.  Considering we were here on Valentine's i didn't notice any slowdown or lack in service for what was surely a busy night.

Food -- The food if very good.  Compared to the top tier steaks, you'll probaby find a little better but they are also not as fancy as some of the big time ones.  It is nice to receive a side that is included and not a la carte. (Kind of a peeve of mine). Food is going to be fairly expensive, but not to an offensive level.  We had the New York Strip, a Rib-Eye, Oysters Rockefeller and Crab Legs.  Steak was cooked as we asked, Oysters Rockefeller were buttery and bacony, and crab, while not an overly complex thing to serve was done as should be expected.

Conclusion: Definitely a classic, I think you can find slightly better from Hugo's for the downtown classics, but nothing wrong with this.  An extremely relaxing, comfortable evening that I would feel comfortable celebrating any special occasion.",jcThqp8nGqJNsyxUcl4_kg,5,2,4,ncHVYSKdnC9m_J2-1KkTMg

On top of great food and huge portions, they have a share a plate option for those of us that just can't eat 20 ounces of meat and all the trimmings any more. The second person gets a full pate of fixings of their own and you split the meat. IF I remember right the second plate was about $20. To be honest,we could have probably just split the one plate there is so much food. Average steak runs 40 to 50 bucks, which is a heck of a great deal.

Last year our steaks were over cooked and when we addressed this with our waiter, Jeffrey ,he wanted to bring out another steak...too late.  Who wants to wait for a steak when your group in already eating?  Next to us was a group of drunk loud and obnoxious men.  When this was addressed to our waiter we received a passive oh well type response.  Only the cost of the steak was deducted from the bill.  This year we gave Binions another try.  We had a different waiter, and the food was good (not great).  Unfortunately, as we were dining, two men were seated at the table next to us and were waited on by Jeffrey.  The men were drunk loud and obnoxious.  The loud exchanges between the two men included frequent profanity and the F word. Really ?  Not again !  To make things worse, Jeffrey participated in the very loud conversations.   We were unable to converse in normal tones at our own table.  What a shame.  This trip we were celebrating a 50th Birthday.  This was relayed in the reservation and the Birthday girl wore a birthday tiara.  The host wished her a happy birthday .  Our waiter did not recognize her Birthday as is the usual custom.  Next year...we won't be going to Binions.

1976744,2016-02-17,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"This place was an old favorite...until recently.  This steakhouse used to be a good spot on Fremont. But as with most things on Fremont, it has seen better days. 

I'm struggling with my choice of stars: on one hand the restaurant deserves 3, maybe 4 stars (on a good day). But the casino experience drags this down to a 2 star review. I decided in the middle with a 3 star rating... you can decide. This experience is based on a Saturday night visit with a 630 dinner reservation. 

Casino: 1/5 stars. We entered the casino through the rear entrance (not under the canopy). This doorway used to be the valet, which the casino has since shut down. This area used to also be bustling with poker activity. Overall ambience: there were hardly any people, very little table games going, and the smell of smoke was distinct. Just past the former valet doorway were racks of tee shirts for sale. It was odd and out of place, and gave the feeling of a swap meet. Truly not a high end experience. When we left, we went out the main doors that exit to the canopy area. There was a table set up with someone selling cigars for $7-$20. Another cheap feel for a formerly decent joint. 

To get to the steakhouse, there is a dedicated elevator which takes you to straight to the restaurant. This was out of order, apparently permanently. So we took the guest elevator. Not a deal breaker, but another sign that this place is going downhill fast. 

Steakhouse: the prices were approx $50 for a steak with a side. The beers were surprisingly cheap ($6 for bottles coors light). The view is awesome. And likely what you are paying for. 

Food: I ordered the ribeye with baked potato. The potato was loaded & delicious. The steak was okay, not superb, but not bad either. For the price point you can get a better quality steak elsewhere. For an app, I order the escargot- which was great. This would be the only reason I come back. 

Service: the service was good. I went with a group of younger people and they weren't judgmental considering. I respect that, as you never know who your patrons are.  The staff was attentive and brought complimentary desert to our guest of honor. 


Bottom line: There's better steakhouses for the price point, but the food is okay nonetheless, particularly if you're already downtown.  The casino is in pretty poor shape, so if you're looking for that experience with your steak, look elsewhere.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,4,1,3,EOduFs084tBW3oz70rtLYQ

We received a breadbasket and butter to get us started. We ordered an appetizer to start to share (Caprese) and it was absolutely delicious. We each ordered a drink from the bar or wine and each was smooth and tasty and paired well with dinner. 

Two of the group ordered filet mingion and one ordered the ribeye steak. The Filets and steak were each cooked perfect and came with fresh veg and potato of your choice. The loaded baked potatoes were delicious and very big. The garlic mash was perfectly creamy and garlicky but not overwhelmingly so.

The service and staff were great. Very attentive and professional.

The environment was lovely- large windows all around, so every seat had a view of downtown. It was dimly lit and really felt as though you'd been transported back to Old Vegas.

Food was good- and very fairly priced. Nothing particularly ""wow-ed"" me, but everything was solid. Entrees include a choice of potato (baked, garlic mashed, roasted, or risotto), as well as a vegetable. Bottled water and warm rolls were also included. I had the chicken fried lobster ($57), which was more interesting on paper than in taste. The lobster was good, but having it fried really didn't add anything to it. I had to add hot sauce and horseradish to add some flavor.
My husband had the 16oz prime rib ($38) and thought that it was great! (I did as well). The 24oz would have been WAY too big.

2166864,2011-11-26,4,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Let me preface this review by saying I have been to Binion's before a few years ago.  The food was great, the service excellent and the ambiance was awesome.

I decided to return there with my parents (whom have never been to Vegas before) AND on Thanksgiving night for the same experience and it was AWFUL!!!!!

Our server (Michael) was devoid of any emotion and seemed like he was incredibly unhappy to be working there (or Thanksgiving night perhaps).  When taking our order, he appeared to be less than enthused that we were there (of which not many people were).  When our food came, he served my mother (the only lady at the table) last.  Having worked as a server myself (and having genuine respect/manners), I know that lady should be served first.  I was kind of surprised - especially for being a high-priced restaurant.

I ordered the 10oz filet mignon  - medium rare (which is what I had last time). When I got it, the first inch and a half were incredibly well done - some pink in the middle.  It was soooooooooo dry!  I couldn't believe it!  $41 for this?   Now I'm not one to usually complain about my food and I can't tell you the last time I sent something back (15 yrs ago maybe?).  I sent it back and the next one they brought out was pink so I thought it was fine.  Towards the middle it was red/purple.  It went from dry to practically still alive!  I don't get it!!!!  This place was incredible when I was there last and for a steakhouse (and at their price point) you would think they could handle a medium rare filet.

My partner had the prime rib which was  an incredibly thick piece of meat, but really fatty.

I was given a complimentary slice of pumpkin cheesecake for my ""wait"" for my second steak which was ok.

The only redeeming quality was Jorge the bus guy who worked his ass off and did considerably more work and was more engaging than our server.

The hubbster had been here before and always had a great dining experience. This was my first time, and I felt there was something lacking.. lets dish why..

As far as the ambiance of the place, its very romantic, stylish and vintage Vegas. I can picture the Rat Pack having drinks in a corner booth, or maybe Wayne Newton having some Filet Mignon at the next table. The view of the Fremont area below and the Vegas Strip in the distance is beautiful and a great scene while dining. 

The staff is friendly and attentive, and the service was great since they knew we were kind of a ""wedding"" party, given our attire, but the food on the other hand seemed bland and not too tasty as I expected. I had ordered a wedge salad which was fine, and then the filet mignon at medium, which it was medium pink, but still had well done bits close to the end. The veggies had no salt, which I added some, and so the wine seemed to be the best selection of the night. It wasn't unpleasant enough to complain, since the food was hot and smelled great, but for the $$$ for what we paid, I feel it was not worth it. 

Perks: Gorgeous views of the city. Good wine selection. Steaks and seafood on the menu. Nice spot for a date night.

Downsides: Pricey for hit or miss entrees. 

OverALL:  A-OK. Might have to take a gamble at this. Not bad, but not amazing either. Its worth a try if you are a steak lover.",a3PFZgQX9jjT8bJSF0wCdw,2,0,3,a2whkVucx47zQH-UsjF2Qg

2308380,2012-12-13,1,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Awwww...review 100!

For the 16th anniversary celebrating our first kiss - we opted to try yet another classic vintage Vegas steakhouse.  Kind of ironic when you consider that neither of us eat steak - but we both appreciate old school fare and flair.  Our anniversary fell on 12-12-12 and the National Finals Rodeo was in town so Binion's was PACKED with an interesting mix of stetson and jean wearing dung kickers and newly married husbands and wives in their finest whites.  

Although we had reservations and arrived on time, we still had to wait 15 or so minutes for our table to be ready.  The atmosphere is dark and clubby, with tin ceiling panels, dark woods and red and gold faux-flocked wallpaper.  While waiting, we took a walk through the restaurant and marveled at the 24th-floor views. Our table was well worth waiting for as we got a window seat!

Navigating steakhouse menus are always an interesting challenge for the non-red meat eater - I always opt for a seafood entree these days.  Although the Chicken Fried Lobster sounded like a curious abomination that I really wanted to tackle - the term ""market price"" scared me off.  In the end, I ordered a rather tame Iceberg Wedge Salad and the Shrimp Scampi for an entree.  We split a celebratory bottle of Moet.

I specifically ordered the Iceberg Wedge as it was described as not having bacon on it - it came with bacon. A little annoying, but I just pushed the bacon aside and ate the rest.  The Italian dressing was tasty!  The wait was quite lengthy between courses but with stellar company, the sparkling and the view - I didn't mind so much.  My Scampi came with 5 very nice plump tail on shrimp with a side of buttery green beans and a baked potato.  The sauce that they serve with the scampi was dense and unbelievably decadent!  It seemed to be made of much more than just the butter, garlic, white wine and fresh herbs described on the menu (possibly some dairy in there?)  A solid classic entree for a solid classic place.

NOTE: The name of this restaurant has officially been changed to ""Top Of Binion's Steakhouse"".  Is there anyway to change this on Yelp?",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,7,2,5,f5Urz4RECDIMKxdsx9fXcA

My uncle was in town last week and suggested we go there for prime rib. My dad wanted to go to the Cortez Room at the Gold Coast as he was worried that Binion's wouldn't be good anymore and he likes the Cortez Room. I wanted to go to Binion's 'cause I hadn't been there in ages and we go fairly often to the Cortez Room. So I looked it up on Yelp to see what the reviews said. I told my family that Binion's had better reviews than the Cortez Room. So we decided to give it a try.

I'm glad we did. It was the best prime rib I had had in a very long time. The prime rib definitely earned 5 stars.

However, the ambiance left a little to be desired. The tables were too close together and my uncle had a hard time getting to his chair because  it was so close to the next table. Also, my mom had a beam of sunlight in her eye and it took the waiter awhile to figure out how to move the blinds to block that ray of sun. The service in general was so-so.

My wife had the seared ahi tuna. It had been seared a little longer than I would have liked, but she really liked it. It also came with a very good hoisin sauce. My dad got the tuna as well, and really liked it.

I guess most people pay a high price and need to rationalize that they got a great meal.  Then the price is higher than most quality steak places.

On our trip today my wife and I ordered the shrimp cocktail which was delicious. For our entr√©es we both ordered the prime rib, medium. The meat seemed high quality and seasoned well, but neither was cooked correctly. Mine was overdone and hers was under cooked. Why would they send out the same meat with one bleeding and one charred?

I'm also very disappointed in the wine and whiskey selections. You would think they would have a great selection but it was below standard.

2808013,2011-07-17,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I absolutely loved Binions. My friend was having a major jonsing for a good steak and we were looking for a place that was a little more reasonable then some of the Ruth Chris type places that are located all over the strip. Decided to try Fremont since we planned on hanging there later that night. I thought back to ""The Hungry Detective"" on the Food Network and remembered him going here. Binions was a place I was also wanting to try for a long time. We arrived and there was no wait. We were seated right by a window with a fabulous view of the strip and Fremont. You can't get that view at too many places. The atmosphere was kinda cool, like an old school steak house where Frank SInatra and all the old schoolers would have hanged back in the day. Our waiter was terrific also, very attentive and friendly.
Now on to the food, the only complaint is that there were no appetizers that didn't have seafood in them it seemed. My friend is not a fan of seafood and so she was kinda bummed. We both ordered the petite filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Since the menu said you could choose sauces, we figured why not and I chose the Bearnaise and she chose the peppercorn. I was actually very pleased that I could add on a sauce because I honestly don't like to have a steak without some kinda sauce. I love Bearnaise on steak but when I really don't feel like making it, I will just use BBQ sauce. Weird I know, but I have been eating it this way since I was a little girl. I guess when it boils down to it, I am not a huge steak person. I do like a good cut of meat but I never get super excited about it. Anyways, the filet was actually significantly larger than I expected. Honestly, it was the best steak I have ever had in my life! Like I said, not usually a huge steak person so I normally will only eat about half of a filet. However, I ate the entire steak presented to me along with the potatoes which were silky smooth and very flavorful/ well seasoned and the entire bunch of perfectly cooked green beans. My friend hates veggies but she continued to eat the green beans saying that she liked them alot. Did I mention that I ordered my steak medium and this was the first place I have ever been too that cooked it exactly medium? Every other place I have been doesn't know how to cook a steak but this is the exception. The Bernaise was delicious and my friend loved the peppercorn sauce, but honestly, the steaks didn't need the sauces. The meat could hold up on its own (Gosh, never thought I would be saying that!). 
Everything from the bread to the meal to the bottle of white zin we ordered was so fabulous that we felt that dessert needed to be ordered, no option, it had to be done! So we ordered the tiramisu to split. Its hard to find a good tiramisu where you can really taste the coffee. This was not only a good tiramisu, it was a great tiramisu. Perfectly moist and had very much the coffee flavor you expect. 
Needless to say, we walked away not only feeling satisfied but extremely giddy about the meal we had just devoured. 
Binions is terrific in every aspect of the word: Great value for Vegas (how many other upscale steakhouses in Vegas give you fresh hot bread, bottled water, steak, potato and veggie for an affordable price?), great ambiance, and absolutely amazing food! The next trip to Vegas will definitely include a dinner at Binions!

PS: When looking for parking, there is a parking garage where Binions will Validate for up to 3 hours I believe and it is under the hotel if I remember right. When entering the hotel, I would recommend going onto Fremont Street and entering from there. Otherwise, you will walk into a nearly empty poker room that is just depressing and pathetic. That happened to us. It was literally one of those moments where you open the door and everyone stairs at you. Kinda Freaky. I remember thinking that Binions must have really lost its appeal and had hardly any clientele, however, I realized that the other side closest to Fremont street is actually the jumpin part.    ;)
One final thing, someone was celebrating a birfday in the next room, and a group was singing Happy Birthday to them. It was the most depressing Happy Birthday I have ever heard. Everyone singing sounded like they wanted to die. Now I am not sure if that was the waitstaff or just the group at the table but it was the most pathetic rendition of Happy Birthday I have ever heard. if that was the waitstaff, they should be ashamed of themselves and step up their games. It was so bad that all the other tables around us including us were all making wisecracks about it. Haha",F10QJk-i3IrUxKcJI9CF-g,1,0,5,t5oq3u-vou03kY-t_TBaHQ

2853176,2013-03-09,3,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Binion's Ranch Steak House delivered a truly outstanding high-end Vegas dinner with 28th-floor views of nearby neon and the distant Strip's shimmer.

Propped atop the old Mint casino, Binion's Ranch is a step back in time. The bartender tells us the place is unchanged in 40 years (except Benny Binion punched that hole in the wall over there). The exterior glass elevator is the oldest in Vegas and should definitely be used for your trip back down to street level.

My table enjoyed virtually everything from surf to turf and then some. Everything received unanimous praise from a group of three notoriously bitchy guys.

The atmosphere is definitely old school steak house with huge booths facing the glass walls, red velvet wall paper, and a ma√Ætre d' who has been doing his job so long, he may not have noticed that The Mint casino no longer exists beneath him.

I gotta back out one point because I felt that our waiter disappeared after taking our order. A post-meal request for coffee seemed to generate a bit of a huff. One of my companions disagreed. The third, easily distracted by sparkly things, was hypnotized by the street below.

The waiter said he had been there for 30 years...must be a good gig.  I met my friend and his wife here for dinner on Saturday night.  I arrived a bit early so I had a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey on the rocks.  The bartender was prompt, courteous and knew the art of a good long pour.  Upon getting up to leave for the table he topped off my nearly empty glass, gratis...very cool!

The ambience is old school, dimly lit, great views since it is up on the top floor and very, very mellow.  It's definitely an older crowd here mixed with some riff raff tourists.  What's shocking to me is they seem to have no dress code...there were guys wearing shorts, t-shirts and a couple wearing baseball hats; at 8 PM on a Saturday night!?!?!? Come on guys, what's wrong with you!

The service was decent albeit there seemed to be some confusion between the kitchen, food runners and servers...food items being delivered to the wrong tables.

Now on to the food: I started with the lobster bisque (which I always do if it's on the menu).  It was OK but I've had far better.  It seemed like they took the bisque with whatever small amount of lobster and whipped it up in a blender; the consistency was weird.  I then had the 8oz filet cooked medium and it came out perfect.  The seasoning was a little on the weak side but overall the steak was fine.  The plate came with steamed green beans which were OK but a little dried out.  My friends wife ordered the crab cakes for her appetizer.  I suggest you do not order these; they were nearly all filler and batter.  For desert we shared a molten lava cake (my friends favorite) and he claims it was one of the better ones he's had.  I thought it was good as well just not a lot of experience with that desert to compare.

I think if they can increase the quality of their food and preparation AND enforce somewhat of a dress code this could easily be a 4 out of 5.  Until then I'm giving it a very generous 3 out of 5.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,1,2,3,BRmmvtCZ-eUlszY3psWPTA

3083314,2009-09-20,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Binion's Ranch is a genuine time capsule--a classic American steakhouse seemingly untouched since about 1986. The interior is dark and leathery, with Kenny G playing softly in the background. Bowtie-clad waiters circulate swiftly around the booths, carrying ponderous trays of beef and crab. The regulars, rolling in from the casino, gobble down plates of porterhouse and New York steak, accented by an occasional ""forget about it!""

I agree with previous reviewers that there's no ""forced pleasantries"" here. In fact, the service was remarkably East Coast: alert, efficient and perhaps even a tad brusque for porcine suburbanites who like their egos stroked. But that suits me just fine. The Binion's Ranch ""experience"" is meat+view+butter. Not too shabby. 

On a recent visit here, I shared an appetizer of Oysters Rockefeller, king crab legs with petit filet and a chicken fried lobster tail. All the dishes were about as good as the environs suggest...not an epic meal, but certainly quality ingredients and reliable preparation. In terms of price, its definitely not cheap, topping out at nearly $80 a head, but I think its probably worth it.

Ordered escargot, Caesar salad (which isn't table side), steak and lobster which I ordered medium rare both came out overlooked, added a side of crab legs which was the best thing I tasted. The mixed veggies were just different colored carrots and they weren't as soft as carrots should be served. Garlic mashed potatoes and rice were delicious. Melted butter was salted, which i couldn't believe. Great ambiance and service. A bottle of Vueve Clicot was only 85$!!!! So I will come back for crab legs and champagne. No fresh desserts, they actually still rock the tray. Supposed to be the best value in Vegas, but there are better.

This is old style Las Vegas, just what I go for! I took my family to this restaurant the last time I was in Las Vegas and we all really loved it. We all pretty much ordered the same thing too so I can only comment on that. It was the Steak Diane and it was absolutely perfect. I will definitely visit this place again on  my next visit. 

The restaurant is a bit dark but has spectacular views of the city and I really liked it along with my wife. This place was pricey but I'll give you a great tip - I highly recommend getting the American Casino Guide as they have a very good coupon in this book for a % off of your meal. You can find the American Casino Guide on ebay and they'll save you a bunch of money on a variety of things in Vegas.

Highly recommend as a great Steak House in Vegas.",-X8saOIinN36j-Z5_s767Q,2,0,4,mhdcEphavsoGYZFi8nFung

Germany our excellent waiter served some petite size fresh loaf of warm bread with creamed butter -(bread  was made with yeast , was moist and tasted like most of the French / Italian country bread - Yummy )
We ordered Crab Cakes ( I would use less seasoning to keep the essence of the crab taste )
 But it was nice and moist. 
French Onion Soup ( beef stock was a bit (restauran) salty . Then we ordered Filet Mignon / medium rare with mashed potatoes/sour cream . Mashed Potato was a little thick and heavy for a heavy slice meat but taste wise and flavor was very nice . ( Maybe whipping it up)
Filet Mignon was OUTSTANDING and just damn delicious. 
Also we ordered Ribeye Steak / Medium and it was just NICE as my Filet Mignon ...
I had a glass of Malbec from Argentina  ( my second glass somehow ended up as a Cabernet Savingon - it was beautiful as well )

3298526,2009-03-27,4,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I'm giving this place a VERY generous 3 stars b/c of the view....it was really nice! =) And the music was great! They are lucky they had that going for them b/c the rest of it...not so good. 

My husband and I checked out the menu online before our trip and basically decided on what we were going to get. We also checked the dress code, which stated ""business casual"". I wore a dress (I NEVER wear dresses) and my husband wore a suit jacket and a nice button up shirt with nice slacks. We walked over to Binion's and finally found the correct elevator after asking a few employees, and made our way up to the top. No glass elevator. =(  Everything was going good thus far- the maitre d (this guy was wearing a ring on every finger, he looked like an old school mafia boss or pimp lol) seemed a little smug, but we were expecting that since this was supposed to be a nice place. 

In our reservations I stated that this was a special occasion and asked for a table by the windows if available. They accommodated us with this great table right next to the windows, kind of off by ourselves. Great view, great music, no one directly next to us, everything was perfect so far. Our waiter started off great, but we didn't actually see him for the rest of our meal until he brought the check - more on that in a second. I ordered the petite filet and my husband ordered the chicken fried lobster, since they are supposed to be famous for it. Remember me saying we had looked at the menu beforehand? Well they need to update their menu prices online. Everything was like $10 to $20 more on their actual menu than they had quoted online. I know inflation happens, but come on...update your website! Money wasn't an object, but still, UPDATE.

A few minutes after ordering, a loud table of 4 was seated right next to us....there were a ton of open tables a few feet away, why couldn't they have gone over there?! They were not busy so I don't think it would have been an issue for our section's waiter to walk an extra 4 feet. Anyway, the loud table was sat next to us and they were all dressed in motorcycle tshirts and old jeans, with baseball hats. I noticed a few more tables coming in with ratty looking tshirts and holey jeans. I think we were the only table dressed up! I am not a snob, people can wear whatever they want, but I put on a dress and heels b/c it was supposed to be business casual, so I think they could have come in with a freaking polo shirt on or something! And the snobby maitre d didn't say anything....maybe they tipped him, who knows. Ok, so the loud table next to us all ordered water, and they managed to get better service from the wait staff than we did - we ordered drinks. I heard what they ordered (how could I not) and our 2 person check was going to be more than their 4 person check, and our waiter was kissing their asses. As I said before, we only saw our waiter when he took our order and when he dropped off the check. We didn't get a refill until my husband tried to refill his water himself (they had giant bottles of water sitting off to the side) and out of the 3 waiters / workers we saw walking around, no one asked how our meal was. They sure as hell asked the table next to us how everything was, multiple times. 

On the the food: the filet was burnt...charred severely. I asked for medium, not black. It didn't even taste like a filet, I think they gave me the  scraps from someone else's steak. The potatoes were the best thing on my plate sadly. The house salad was drenched in dressing, which would normally we fine, but there was so much that I couldn't finish it. My husband got the caesar and he seemed to enjoy it. His chicken fried lobster was gross. We've both had better fried seafood from Long John Silvers or Red Lobster. The lobster itself was just not good. My husband will usually push through something he doesn't like, b/c he's paying for it, but he wouldn't even finish this dish.  I told him to send it back, but we would have had to see a waiter for that to have even happened. 20 or so minutes went by with us sitting there waiting for a waiter to come back to ask how our meal was. Neither of us had touched very much on our plates, that should have been a sign to the wait staff that something was wrong. Clue number 2 would have been us looking around for someone that worked there. I'm serious, if the mafia looking maitre d had not been outside we would have dined and dashed, it was that bad. 

We stayed and paid, and gave a fair tip (even though we shouldn't have given our waiter anything b/c he didn't DO anything) and on our way out we passed 2 employees and the maitre d....no one said 'thanks for coming in', 'enjoy your night', 'kiss my ass'....nothing. We will not be back. I am big on service and this place SUCKED big time.",WjitTYyu1ab10jKi9b-fIA,4,3,3,1i0nRwXlMujoJWzLRVR9cg

Unfortunately the food at the steak house continues to be a disappointment.  A few years back, you could always count on Binions to have a fantastic Ribeye, but the last few times dining there, the quality of the meat seems to be lacking.  I will admit, my standards for a steak will vary based on the price (ie. my standards are higher for a $40 steak vs. my standards for a $20 steak), but the quality of the meat just is not up to snuff.  Basically it is the quality of a Longhorn of Outback...which is not bad for $20, but at $40 it is disappointing.  I can only hope they will return to using a better quality meat.  On a positive note, one of the people dining with me said the lamb chops were fantastic.

3355692,2012-06-26,1,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"OLD SCHOOL! and I mean that in a very good way.  This is the kind of place that has crushed velvet everywhere and is very dark and probably hasn't had a renovation since it was created which was, I'm going to guess, about 50 years ago.  I say all this with love and affection.  We wanted to go somewhere to eat a steak and as we were looking around it seemed like the average for vegas was $40-$50 for a steak with no sides.  We saw that it was $37 for a ribeye with sides, we decided this was the place.  

We had cocktails downstairs and played some poker and were waited on by a server with hair that was at least 4 inches taller than her and had been serving there for 25 years.  We knew we were in the right place.  We went upstairs and had martinis and old fashions, the only way to start a steak dinner.  I had the chopped salad and the boy had the french onion soup.  Both were very good and just what you would expect.  We then shared a ribeye which came with fresh green beans  and a baked potato.  Everything was good, the steak was flavorful and the green beans were great.  We had cheesecake for desserts and some coffee.  

The only reason we took off a star is that the service was a little weird.  The server would ignore us for other tables for quite awhile, and then just disappear in the back for 20 minutes.  Also we wanted a sauce with our steak and he disappeared before we could order it.  Luckily the steak was cooked perfectly and the it was juicy enough, but it was still a little weird that he didn't ask us about a sauce.  Also the bathroom was very out of date and there is no dress code.  So if you are having dreams of going up there and being kind of fancy, which we did, you are probably going to be interrupted by a group of girls in work out clothes or guys dressed in baggy jeans and white t shirts.  

The view is great as well and its worth a trip.  I definitely will recommend this to out of town visitors as the place to go for a steak.",WEXkES4QG-INtrBMtdFyBQ,2,1,4,LlcxrGXrEhZfEVajJ_EoHA

I ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, French Onion soup and the 24 oz Prime Rib.  My fiance ordered the Lobster Bisque and the 10 oz Filet.  I love raw oysters and I love them Rockefeller.  These oysters had way too much sand so they didn't taste very good.  The onion soup was bland, the lobster bisque had too much pepper, the prime rib was so chewy it took forever to eat just one bite and the filet had no flavor to it at all.  If I'm spending $47 on prime rib and $45 on filet, I expect nothing but perfection and melt in your mouth flavor.  A good filet should not make you want to ask for A1 steak sauce to put on it.  We sent back the prime rib (did not want another one), the filet had to go back as well because it was ordered medium rare and arrived medium well.  When we got the medium rare, it was so bland I couldn't eat it.  One of our guests had to send her filet back because it was too well done also and had to send the crab legs back to be warmed because they were ice cold.

So, I'm going to chalk this up to an off night but I won't be going here again.

However, our waiter Lawrence was absolutely fabulous, courteous and did his best to please us.  He was very nice in providing 4 different desserts for the table at his expense.  Hopefully Lawrence can tell management regarding this really bad meal (as he said he would) and improvements will be made.

3577033,2018-01-10,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I used to come here about six times a year prior to their menu redesign in early 2017.  I got busy and hadn't been able to go but finally did have the occasion to go with some friends at the start of 2018.

First off, a few comments about the menu.  Their old menu was OK, but the new one is spectacular with a lot more variety.  I have been looking forward to trying the new menu out for a year.  One very important thing to note is their menu online is NOT THE SAME as the menu in the restaurant.  It visually looks the same but it is not and this is a big problem.  The meatballs appetizer is online but not on the actual menu.  There's a pork kabob on the actual menu that's not online.  The filet mignon prices and are higher on the actual menu than online.  Truffle fries, potatoes au gratin, and crispy onion straws are online but not on the actual menu.  Instead, on the actual menu you can pay a small amount to upgrade your entree side to potatoes au gratin, and they have onion rings and steak fries instead.  A dish called chicken ogden is on the online menu but on the actual menu it's been replaced with cajun chicken.

Anyway, after being seated you get a small loaf of sourdough bread and some butter, plus bottled water.  I'm not a huge fan of sourdough but it was pretty good.  The butter has this slight honey/orange flavor which is odd.  I'd have either preferred regular butter, salted butter, or cinnamon butter if you want to go the sweet route.

As for the actual dishes, I ordered the filet medium-well and butterflied with cajun blackening and my wife ordered the cajun chicken, her favorite from the old menu.  For sides we got mushrooms, steak fries, onion rings, macaroni & cheese without lobster, and I upgraded my potatoes to the au gratin potatoes.  In general the sides were good but the entrees were not.  

They have changed the cajun chicken and doused it in this sauce.  I thought it was OK but my wife thought it was awful.  As for my steak, it was woefully undercooked.  My medium-well was somewhere between rare and medium-rare.  In probably 100 steakhouse dinners I've only sent an entree or side back once, but I had to send this one back as well.  After it was cooked some more it was now somewhere between medium-rare and medium.  I was with other people and didn't want to seem like an ass so I just sat there without eating it, took it home and heated it up myself (it was OK).  Keep in mind, the steak was butterflied, so it should not be difficult to cook -- I try to make it easier because I know cooking a thick filet to be more done is difficult and time consuming.

As for the sides, my wife said the mushrooms were good, as were the green beans she got with her entree.  The onion rings were fairly normal.  The macaroni and cheese was actually penne and was nothing special.  The steak fries were probably the best I've ever had.  Lastly the au gratin potato upgrade is worth it.

In general the service was pretty attentive, although I'm slightly miffed that they did not offer to remove the steak from the bill or take half off or some such.  I am not one to create a big scene or ask for a manager, but both the server and the server's assistant knew it was wrong, saw me the entire time with it in front of me and not eating it.  They offered to send it back to get cooked some more a third time but I figured why bother if they messed it up twice already and my wife & friends are halfway done with their meal.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,9QNJDbXIa2-5J9djk8akmQ

I have never tried it before and with the decent reviews and the ad stating it had the best view in Las Vegas, I thought what the heck.  I called and made reservations and told them It was our anniversary and asked for a table with a nice view.  We arrived up the elevator with another couple.  They asked if we had reservation and I said yes, the other couple said no.  We were taken to a table only one spot away from the desk and right across from the kitchen.  The couple without the reservations were taken down the way a bit and placed in a booth.  I guess when I asked for a nice view the kitchen help was what they considered nice.  They had a view of northwest Vegas, we had a view of building tops and other hotels.  We saw the waiter three times the entire time we were there.  Once to take our drink order, once to take our food order and to give us the bill.  If not for the bus boy we would have felt alone.  I wanted to order a beer with dinner but I never had that opportunity.  The food was better than average but not worth the price.  Outback, half the price and almost as good, with better service.  Outback is louder but not busier since we were next to the kitchen, but the server comes and checks in on you now and again at Outback.  Would I go back there?  Absolutely not!

First of all, the place is a little worn with age and the decor is need of updating.  The view is OK, but not as spectacular as the Stratosphere.  The service was OK, but oh my, the food was terrible.  The dinner rolls were so hard that it took booth hands to break them apart and then they crumbled all over the table.  I ordered French Onion Soup and it was the worst I've ever had (my favorite is at Outback)--I sipped a couple of spoons and turned it away.  My wife and I both ordered the 16 oz Prime Rib, their specialty.  It was very fatty and full of gristle, so we spent most of our time trimming away the fat.  The green beans were rubbery and cold.  My wife couldn't eat more than a few bites and we hastily got the check (for $122) and left, never to return again.  On the way down the elevator, we met a crowd of 6-8 folks waiting to go up and they asked us if it was worth it.  We told them about our experience and recommended they go to Oscars, just down the street and they quickly left Binion's and headed for Oscars (which we love).",m6zgw_Me9DI9tKvIE-cx3w,0,0,2,RmAU5-rom564D_6eEtzEXA

The service was impeccable, and we never wanted for anything.  Maybe that's because the Restaurant was mostly empty, but hey, it was on a Tuesday evening. We went with the prime rib, and gladly paid the $15 split plate charge which got me my own salad, baked potato au jus and horseradish.  We shared a 24oz cut of meat, and it really was well seasoned and delicious, and even after trimming the fat away there was more than enough.  (Because a little fat is inevitable with prime).

If you are looking for old vegas charm with an okay meal, I think the nostalgia and view of this place will win you over.  For me, the meal and service was far lacking to make up for the setting to make it an enjoyable experience.

The Binon's Horseshoe casino has definitely changed since the 90s when I remember being here last.  No more dark and smoky rooms (and I mean thick layers of smoke visible in the lower atmosphere).  There's much more color and updated lighting.  But once you step into that glass elevator to the 24th floor it's like your own private time machine.  Especially since there is no AC, your on the outside of the building facing south, and you age whole 10 years by the time you reach the top...

Your greeted by ""Vinny"" and the first thing you noticed that every one working was male (at least that night), definitely old school ""Mob supper club"" feel.

The view is not to shabby, little bit of downtown drab but you can see clear to the strip.

The service wasn't that exciting and I cautiously opted for the Chicken Fried Lobster.  I figured you can't go wrong with Lobster and frying it just seemed right.  I think if they fried it in butter it might have been better but this dish just didn't do it for me, the breading just seemed to mask the flavor too much and they even served it along side a dipping sauce, which was too over powering on it's own.

Others in our group went for the Steak which was ok,  The quality of the cut was better than what you get at Outback and you could definitely tell it was grilled over a good quality fire but it was lacking something.

Mimi's French onion soup is far superior to the soup served here, and we've all had that. The baked potatoes were comparable to a potato served at Denny's, yet they were the same price as those served at Vic & Anthony's , (which was the best baked potato I've ever eaten.)

Last night, we had a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre and I had some comp dollars from Binion's, so we finally made it here.  I hadn't been in the restaurant since it was known as Top of the Mint many years ago.

As others have said, it's a classic steakhouse and you have a great view.  We were there early and enjoyed our time looking out the window and picking out things we didn't know were around the area.

For the meal, we each started with onion soup.  It was good with a hearty beef broth and tasty cheese.  I ordered the 10 ounce NY steak and my wife ordered the 8 ounce filet.  It came with choice of starch--we each chose the garlic mashed potatoes--and seasonal vegetable which last night was yellow and green squash.  Both steaks were tasty.  Mine was done a bit to much.  It should have been rarer but it wasn't egregious enough to send it back.  

For dessert, we took a look at the dessert tray brought by our waiter, Jeff, and we opted for the same dessert, a chocolate volcano--a small bundt cake made of chocolate and filled with heated chocolate.  It was very good.

A couple of things to note.  Service was very good.  Jeff has been at the steakhouse for a number of years and he's a good server.  I never wanted for a refill of my iced tea and the bus people were there to remove dirty plates when a course was finished.  The view is as good as everyone points out.  I enjoyed being there while it was light because I could pick out more places.  We were long enough that we could see the lights of Fremont Street start to glow after sundown.

As several people have mentioned, the atmosphere is fantastic.  The view from the 24th floor is great and the restaurant has an old fashioned elegance to it.  As some other people have also mentioned, much of the wait staff has been there forever, and they're all very professional.  

The service is great - attentive but not overbearing, and the food is great as well.  We've tried all the appetizers but our favorite are the Oysters Rockefeller.  Absolutely delicious!  The steaks are always perfectly cooked.  I usually go for the porterhouse and my wife the filet mignon (she also loves the chicken fried lobster).

I disagree with people who say the place is expensive.  We eat there all the time and our bill typically comes out to around $150, which includes a couple of appetizers, entrees, desserts and coffee (neither of us drinks, so I can't attest to the price or quality of the cocktails).  I think this is pretty reasonable for a high end steakhouse.  It's certainly much less than some of the other high end steak joints in Vegas, like say Del Frisco's or Craftsteak, or any of the celebrity chef places.  

Also, a lot of these other places price their menus ala carte, which can add up quick, whereas at Binion's, your steak comes with generous portions of potato and veggies included in the price.  You will definitely not leave here hungry!

One other tip for people who aren't Vegas regulars.  The casino at Binions, while it is , as people have mentioned, kind of dingy, it is also one of the more generous places I've gambled as far as giving out comps.  My wife and I will play some there during the week and by the time Saturday night rolls around we've often got $50 or $60 in comps between us to use towards dinner.",qwlsMuXSDuORY9Ep0K-fGQ,2,1,5,WKVdZm6f0-B9idEeoIGkWQ

First impression shows an elegant and fancy place to eat, but damn is this place loud. It's hard to hold a conversation without yelling and leaning in very close to your company in order to hear what they're saying. Is this is really a fancy steak joint or just someplace pretending to be such?

Most of the staff seem upset or in a bad mood, as a whole. Our waiter, in whatever rush he was doing, poured water so fast and furious into my glass that a great majority spilled onto the table, soaking all the way down and onto my attire for the night. He walked away, which left me in slightly stunned silence and didn't see him return to fix this issue until around 5 minutes later. The fix? Tossing a cloth napkin down and apologizing. I must have pissed somebody in this place in under 5 minutes to be subjected to such.

But anyways, onto the rest.

The service was a little sketchy, but food was good. Great portion size for the price. $37 for a 16oz rib eye is actually not that bad when you compared it to your places back home or have been to.

I'm going to chalk this experience up as a bad first impression but will return to see if the experience is different the next time around or not.

Despite the bad situation with the water and the volume of talking being close to that of being in a nightclub, I'm giving this place 3 stars for the food and the price of such. I would still recommend people to visit and try it.",59WyVbDKkaWftg3u8DnjBQ,0,0,3,mLdB_ERxZn63A7Q4FYFK1A

The shells were almost too hot to hold onto, but they were tasty. I ordered the NY strip with a baked potato as my side. I ordered medium well and it came out very medium. My friend's steak at first appeared more medium well so we switched it up and I still ended with a medium steak. It had a lot of flavor, but I am always disappointed when they don't cook it to order. I'm sure they aren't use to people ever ordering the steaks above medium. They had a great deal on some bottles of wines, so we split a bottle and I was happy with our choice.

They were small and cooked well, with a little crust so to speak. Which was a nice difference from the ways I have had them before. I had a filet and king crab legs. The steak was cooked to order and the crab was split open nicely and tasted perfect. The sides were just fine. The wine list was affordable and ample.

4241023,2011-12-04,10,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"This steakhouse is like one of those hoary old ex-burlesque stars you see tarting around Vegas. Just like Dixie Evans and Blaze Starr, Binion's Steakhouse remains willfully oblivious to things like age, fashion and gravity -- what worked in 1960 is still fiiiiiiiiine up here. And what that means for you, steakhouse researcher, is a chance at having dinner in a fabulous time capsule!
 
I'm not a huge meat eater; to me, steak is steak. Horse, cow, whatever. I've eaten at Binion's a handful of times, most recently last night; the food quality is fine, but nothing exciting -- old-timey steakhouse fare at reasonably reasonable prices ($35 for an 8oz filet). 

But the atmosphere is faaaaaaan-tastic! To get here, you have to take an old-timey elevator that looks like it's from the set of Kenny Rogers's ""The Gambler"" to the tippy-top floor. Then you emerge into a dark, clubby room with dingy red velvet wallpaper and floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over Vegas. Very cool!

But the best part is the maitre'd, who can best be described as Larry Flynt meets Liberace! No fewer than 3 gold rings on EACH FINGER, mock turtleneck under vintage 1990 sportcoat, blonde pompadour, and a manner that is somehow both cloyingly obsequious and totally disinterested, all at once. I don't know his name, but this guy is without question one of the baddest-ass relics of Vegas! 

As mentioned, I'm not a big meat eater. But I *AM* a big boozer, and I was shocked and appalled to discover that they do not serve Campari up here. WTF! For that, they only get 4 stars.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,6,7,4,3JXHrP875i0zWHjmDi8X3Q

We started with the shrimp cocktail and the escargot appetizers.  They were both very tasty.  The horseradish for the cocktail sauce had a great kick to it.  My BF sopped up the escargot juice with all of his bread, it was so buttery.

I had the chicken fried lobster and he had the Binion's cut prime rib.  They were both huge!!  The lobster tail they used for this dish must have been ginormous!  The prime rib was supposed to be 24ozs, but we swore it was at least 30ozs!

Probably not what to order at a steakhouse, but I wasn't in the mood for steak or seafood.  The basket of warm rolls were good though. The sauce was a bit too salty for me, by my friend liked it alot.  He seemed to enjoy his steak too. With drinks and expresso, the bill came out to $107.

Two manhattans apiece and all the nostalgia and cow we could handle in one night was a true bargain. The setting, overlooking the strip from atop Binion's downtown, is fantastic - use the glass elevator to get there! The restaurant, with dark wood paneling and lots of burgundy accents, conjures up a steakhouse atmosphere that I didn't think existed anymore. But this is no working theme park; the kitchen knows what it's doing for the most part. Service is friendly, efficient and professional. The food exceeded (admittedly low) expectations. My husband got the escargot to start, and they were well made in a very traditional garlic-herb butter. The salads were nice. Of course, being a steakhouse, beef is the star here, and Binion's delivered. My extra-rare filet was perfectly cooked and richly flavorful while my husband's rare ribeye was nicely seared and very tasty. It wasn't the very best steaks we've had, but it was very good indeed. The beef had that nice depth that Western beef seems to have. The only quibble with the meat is that it was underseasoned - we needed both the salt and pepper shakers on the table. The sides were a bit pedestrian; my husband's loaded baked potato was particularly clumsy but the vegetables were cooked properly.

Too much history to even begin to get into, but suffice to say, this is ""old Vegas."" People that gamble, drink and eat downtown are treated to a more friendly side of the town where it is not all about being looked at as walking revenue. Here, you are treated with respect and appreciation as soon as you enter. Make no mistake, there is nothing real fancy about Binions. It was never intended to be plush and opulent. It's ambiance is for those of us that enjoy an atmosphere of days gone past. It's a saloon, gambling hall, and features a terrific steakhouse and coffee shop. Note: back in the 70's, steaks with all the trimmings were $2.00 after midnight ! Ahhh, the good old days...

The menu is very straightforward and offers (predictably) a larger selection of steaks and chops than other restaurants owned or managed by name recognized chefs. The food is good, the service is good, and the views of the strip or downtown only add to the experience. Should you ever have a problem, mention the issue to your server, or the manager, and I am positive that they will correct the problem. Having dined there many times over the last 26-years, I have never encountered a single issue with food or service. Not once.

This is not an award winning restaurant. So, if you are looking to dress to the absolute nines, and spend $500 on dinner with your date, you can find a lot of those places on the strip that will accommodate you. At Binion's Steakhouse, you are going to get a good meal, and not over pay either. Visit the bar too. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly enough to chat with you. They pour some good whiskey too! And, by the way, Binion's has a respectable wine menu that is also priced fair.

In Las Vegas, there are a lot of steakhouses.  Binion's offers good food, fairly priced, in an adult atmosphere. If you are a steak lover, give Binion's a try.",b_NsOzPGuVetm_y_KIZgMw,1,0,4,hZPO_pnaYsVdW-8BNwpBog

The garlic mashed potatoes were good, but a little paste-like. Beans were over-steamed. My friend ordered their wedge salad and I have safely never seen that much dressing on a cup and a half of salad in my life. She actually had to ask the waiter what it was when he handed it to her.

While I definitely fell in love with downtown Vegas, I don't think I'm going to go out of my way to go back to this place, though the chicken-fried lobster does sound interesting.

Oh, and ladies, watch your stilettos getting off the elevator! I caught mine in the gap and had the doors close on me twice before I got it free. And this was before the evening's wine. Hazard!!",xQCqe0Oj1S3_VuqIrCZzbQ,1,0,2,AlzEeTOFjp_s8QaHJfz8Cw

I've also had many steaks on every visit, but this steakhouse ranks highest of my experiences. It's old school & dimly lit which has two bonuses: the views would be affected by bright interior lighting; and, in my humble opinion, I look better in dim lighting. If you know me, you'll likely agree.

My 10 oz. Prime filet mignon was very tender & tasty and cooked a flawless medium rare. My Belvedere martinis were dry and ice cold. Remember, it's important to hydrate when in Las Vegas.

The seafood appetizer was also fantastic, especially the lobster medallions with drawn butter. The horseradish that accompanied the large shrimp was blow-your-brains-out fresh, so I recommend small nibbles of it to avoid sinus pain.

The prices can be found on their menu, but I'd say that Binion's offers quite a value compared to others (such as Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere).",BlKCEQcc03mNdLA1pVG-XQ,25,21,5,yjgNtM7VevlotLHswQC4cw
5087164,2014-04-03,4,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"I cannot even begin to explain how amazing this place is. Located on the 23rd floor of a hotel in old Vegas lies the hidden gem that is Binions Steak House. The word ""ranch"" is hilly inaccurate for what you get when you arrive. 

Also, this place makes a great Caesar, which is kind of a gem in its own right as most places in Vegas don't even know what a Caesar is. 

We arrived as a party of 5 and were seated in a booth facing a window which stretches through the entire room and overlooks the entire city. Vegas was at my feet that evening in all it's twinkling glory. 

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and immaculately kept. If it's old, it aged like wine and does not show it's years at all. The fabric of the booths is all red, with tablecloths, linen napkins, and polished flatware. All of the servers I saw were male and extremely well versed in polite conversation as well as when to get lost if the guests are actively engaged in conversation. 

This place reminds me of a mob movie. I felt like a mobsters girlfriend and I absolutely loved it, especially the part where Mr. I ordered for me (I had asked him too just for the experience). 

He ordered: rib eye with asparagus and baked potato. I was served an 8oz fillet with all the same trimmings. The food was incredible. Perfect rare steak, perfect presentation, large portions but not overwhelmingly so. The wine list was extensive but not so much that we couldn't pick something amazing (a napa gem Mr j took a photo of because of the loveliness of it.) 

I would absolutely return. This is the kind of place you take people you love, or someone you plan to have killed in the next scene. ;)",IRMfXiIplQQDgEtljxYCEw,8,2,5,9X_0WdhzeukrpsKtd4k-cQ
5094778,2017-07-09,16,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"A nostalgic steakhouse of yesteryear. Other than the prices, sigh, nothing has changed.

Story time: 2002, The WSOP was played at Binion's.  The first year with the stones to pony up the $10k buy-in, and receive the golden ticket to rub elbows and shoot the $hit with the legends of the game.  THE place to eat, Binion's Steakhouse.

The decor is old school, cozy booths, papered walls, wood accents, you know the look, the views of old Vegas lit to its former glory impress.

The food itself, good if you remember this is the classic steakhouse.  Grass fed, grass finished, Australian or Japanese wagyu, dry aged for 11 months in a Himalayan sea salt line room, this is not the place for you. A big hunk of juicy, slow cooked prime rib your thing, now we're talking.

For starters, the standout, the chicken fried lobster. Basically a whole lobster tail, removed from the shell, lightly pounded, coated in breadcrumbs, then deep-fried golden brown.  Slightly overcooked and a bit rubbery but good eats. The chilled jumbo shrimp cocktail with horseradish cocktail sauce and the oysters Rockefeller, both classic and proper.  Finally, the onion soup, very flavorful.  Lots of sweet caramelized onions in a beefy broth imbued with the unmistakable flavor of brandy.  A dusting of parm atop the cheese covered crouton gives it that salty, nostalgic taste.

Steaks, USDA prime, decently trimmed (there is some residual fat but that is a good thing), seared evenly, cooked to temp. Zero complaints about the 16 ounce ribeye or 24 ounce porterhouse.  Very good prime rib. The 24 ounce bone in, very tender, classic prime rib flavor of long slow roasting.

Sides, meant to be shared are classically prepared. The creamed spinach, cream corn, and potatoes au gratin all rich with heavy cream, and exactly as they should be.

Seafood and poultry, yeah right. This is a steakhouse.

Friendly steakhouse proper service.

OK wine list, but weak by steakhouse standards. All good, just drink martinis all night long.

While it does not share the greatness or glory of the Golden Steer, it has stood the test of time, and definitely makes the list of classic Vegas eateries.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,31,25,3,yPfR_oTAqaSkjNQvNZsuhw

The service was non existent to slow at best.  Each course took forever and alot of the food was cold by the time it arrived at the table.  I had to send my steak back as I ordered it rare and it was cooked to medium.

I sent it back and the second steak came 25 minutes later.  Complaining to the manager resulted in him buying us a round of drinks and that was all he said he would do.  He acted like he could care less.  We were there for over two hours due to waiting for food and nobody from the manager on down seemed to care that we were there.

5205486,2013-09-23,4,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"Binion's is a classic steakhouse from a bygone era in Las Vegas, located at the top of the old Binion's Hotel and Casino.  

I'd be inclined to rate the restaurant as perhaps 4+, were I to base the review solely on the ambience, quality of food, and service, all of which are quite good.  

The Good:
As I was not overly hungry this evening, I ordered the french onion soup and the crab cakes horsdervs.  Both were quite good; and I will single out the crab cakes as especially great.  Wonderful flavor, plenty of crab meat, and perfectly pan-fried.  The soup was fine, as was the warm, soft bread.

I also sampled my date's prime rib, which was pretty much perfect.  Quality meat, cooked attentively and seasoned well.

The ambience is great; it harkens back to a slightly more civilized era...an era when high end restaurants were quiet, dimly lit, intimate affairs.  Today's more modern places seem to instead aim at making diners feel like pseudo-rock-stars, with loud music, high ceilings, and a general emphasis on trendy bling.  It struck me how nice it was at Binion's to simply be spared pulsing techno music and patrons that have to be shout to be heard over the dull roar of the modern dining environment.  As others have mentioned, the view is also great, and the service is attentive, professional and unobtrusive.  

The Bad:
The unfortunate fact is that Binion's Steak House is a high-quality restaurant sadly shoe-horned into a not terribly attractive casino and hotel that has not been updated or remodeled in the last 25 years.

The elevator feels creaky; lights on the buttons often don't work.  

But perhaps worst of all was the shockingly awful bathroom.  It's quite jarring to have a wonderful meal one moment, and then the next moment to find oneself in the sort of bathroom you'd be more likely to find in a Greyhound bus depot.

Faucets are semi-functional and leaking, water is on the counter and the floor, and the toilet paper dispenser is the sort you'd expect to find in a rural gas station someplace, complete with a flopped-open case-cover which cannot be closed.  The bathroom was in need of good cleaning, smelled pretty foul, and basically created the sort of gut-level revulsion you can usually only find on remote interstate rest-stop toilets that have neither been cleaned nor properly remodeled since the Carter Administration.  

Why in the world such relatively minor details and minor expenses would be overlooked by a restaurant that is otherwise creating a fine-dining experience is beyond me.   

The Conclusion:
This is a great restaurant, and a refreshing step back in time.  One can easily imagine Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin or Elvis Presley relaxing with friends over great food here as they look out over the Las Vegas skyline of 1968.

And for the quality of the food and service, it's also reasonably priced.  While not remotely inexpensive, the truth is one would quite literally pay double the price for this quality of food were one to eat at one of the trendier steakhouses located on the Strip.

So really, it's a great place.  Just don't go to the bathroom, and try to close your eyes on your walk thru the casino and your ride up the elevator.",OTTnuvnipelUPUdIenBMDw,8,2,4,tU990HotyudX05aT4MZBqw

However, you definitely get what you pay for at Top of Binions.  Not only was the prime rib so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, the ribeye (dry aged to perfection) was so well marbled, tender and flavorful not to mention cooked perfectly to order.   We also tried the lobster bisque which initially tastes rich, but with the chunks of lobster and perfect blend of cream  it went down so easily without feeling full afterward.  

The service was top notch! Our server and busser team (Oscar and Octavio) were amazing.  We never had a dirty dish on your table for any extended period of time, nor were our glasses ever empty.  They answered all of our questions about the menu with thoughtful knowledge and a smile.  My niece wanted to try the caesar salad but knew she couldn't eat it all, so Octavio even went the extra step of portioning it out for all three of us to enjoy.  Additionally, my sister and niece decided on the shared plate option but one likes their meat medium rare and the other well.  Oscar, without missing a beat said he would take my sister's half and grill it.  So it came back cooked to order with a beautiful and tasteful char on it.  

As we were leaving we asked Don Winn, the manager, about the glass elevator.  He mentioned that it was working the weekend prior to our visit.  We were a little disappointed, so he called it to the top floor, and while we couldn't use it, allowed us to step inside and experience some awesome Vegas history.  

All in all, it was an amazing food, dining and sensory experience. Dining on amazing steaks above downtown you could just feel vibe of classic Vegas. The excellent service was just icing on the cake.",oa4c7YbKOuwdK61Y4Q35LQ,4,1,5,fEjDVdj4oCfWLFDRt8jtOQ

You have to take a glass elevator up the the restaurant located on the 24th floor, the panoramic view of downtown vegas is amazing! That is the only reason why I give this place an extra star.

Food was blah. The Oysters Rockerfeller was a sad plate of food: tiny, overcooked pieces of oysters were thrown onto oyster shells that were two/three times bigger than the oyster meat itself. We even had a couple of empty shells, no oysters just bacon and hollandaise. 

Audree's Filet Mignon was overcooked but she did enjoy the garlic mashed potato that came with it. Their ""famous"" peppercorn sauce added for an additional $3 or $4 was mediocre, just a basic cream sauce cooked with peppercorns.

My Chicken-Fried Lobster was also a letdown. I figured there was no way  this dish would disappoint since 1) I LOVE anything lobster and 2) anything fried (and in clarified butter, no less!) is a sure winner in my book. Wrong! 

My Austrailian Lobster tail was over-pressed and fried in a thick breading.

We started the night with lots of excitement walking in and were having a blast, but before we left the whole table was almost silent... probably out of sheer underwhelment (is that even a word...LOL)

The scallops I ordered had a mushy and stringy texture with no sear on the outside.  I did not expect this kind of quality for a $50 entree.  Initially I was very excited to pay this money and was excited to see what magical creation I would get for this kind of an investment.  I love coming to Vegas for the memorable creations that each chef prepares, but this was not what I expected coming to a gorgeous restaurant like this.  

The waiter made some good recommendations for sides, and we definitely all enjoyed the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  

When we split the bill, it came out to close to $100 per person which I never mind spending the money for a truly exceptional meal.  My three favorite meals of all time ended up costing me well over $250 and each time they were one of the most incredible dining experiences of my life.

Maybe my hopes were too high.  Maybe my buzz wore off too early.  Maybe I am just being whiny tonight.  But this was not one of my favorite meals of all time.  I hope that I just came in on an off night.",P5F6tfuzk9HgwC5ZqfbjQg,2,1,3,64Oez2Y0idsPQof61MyTWw
5654878,2016-02-16,0,41Kbugm-qmIQTt7unkALYQ,"My wife and I came here for Valentine's Day dinner. The glass elevator was out of order, so I was a little bummed since I thought it would add to the experience. 

We walked in about 4:55 and our reservations were for 5:00. It was a little awkward at first since it was just the beginning of dinner service. No other guests were there which was fine. But there were about 3 employees just staring at us and we walked up and it was dead silent. The silence made it even stranger. But we were shown to the bar, had a couple of drinks and brought over to our table. 

Yes, what this place has over most other steakhouses is the amazing view. Being there while the sun was setting was absolutely perfect. We finished our drinks while whispering to each other as it was so quiet it seemed as if others would be able to hear us. 

After a drink and finally deciding what we wanted we ordered the escargot, filet mignon and 16oz prime rib. Music came on, other guests came in and the restaurant finally started to have a bit of a buzz. 

We plowed through the escargot which was delicious and received our entrees. They were both cooked an excellent medium rare. My only complaint would be that the prime rib was a little cooler than it should be. But other than that, the food was fantastic. 

Service, food, atmosphere were all great. 
Will probably return in the future. Would recommend to local friends or those visiting.",71aL3mJcLYG9rQFPA15WQA,1,0,4,LOb_GjYSA2SzNMuy1D6WLg

We came to this place dressed like dirtbags, tired from walking and not looking like we had money.. but you know what?  The first thing that happened was we were greeted like we owned the place.  

Right from the minute we got there, the staff was courteous, respectful and very helpful.  The place is as classy as it gets, definitely every bit the luxurous joint it puts itself out to be.  Awesome view of the city, great lighting and the staff were dressed very nice.

The food..... What can I say?  This food was very spendy.. But worth every single dollar.  The meal was absolutely delicious.. Definitely something I will not forget. 

My wife and I spent quite a bit of time there even after we ate, talking with the waiter and getting our picture taken.

If you come to Las Vegas, screw the slot machines, spend your money here and absolutely positively assure you that you will NOT be sorry.

Top of Binions is where its at for fine dining.  The wife and I are coming back to Vegas this July and this is definitely one of the places we will come back to.",G7HhYzITBfVSRyi6DX6G-Q,8,4,5,Cp8jOt0JRhIQrkMXEdoMYQ

Vegas was packed...with the strip looking like the perfect-feeding/multiplication-ground for a zombiepocalyse that emergency measures were immediately taken to get both the lady and I out...QUICK...before disaster strikes. So zipping away from the strip, she immediately asked where we were headed. GOOD OLD VEGAS was my immediate reply. Pulling her trusty iPhone out, she started looking at destinations to check out. Five minutes later, we were keen on Binion's Ranch Steakhouse as it promised ""great service with a great view over good food"".

The parking lot was unsurprisingly empty and the old-Vegas almost-prehistoric feel permeated the air. Fine...fine...it wasn't exactly PREHISTORIC but definitely a drop (not a leap) back in time. It was a feeling similar to staring at a much-beloved-386 computer (if you're even old enough to know this) after using and getting accustomed to a spiffy-oh-so-hot-and-bank-breaking Alienware or MacBook Pro for several years. Yet, seeing a 386 computer once again doesn't mean I would back away. Rather, just like I used to grab my little box of 5"" floppy disks in anticipation to stuff it into the floppy drives to begin playing DotT (Day of the Tentacle - and if you remember and have played this game...you immediately get an additional Yelp fan who will read and UFC your freaking reviews), I held the lady's hand and eagerly made our way through stale-tobacco-scented corridors to the elevator that would port us up and back in time.

We reached and entered the elevator without seeing a single soul. As the ascent began, the zombiepocalypse image returned. Crap, did they attack old Vegas first and we just stupidly volunteered to become fresh ingredients in their gruesome-human-buffet? GREAT...@#*&^$*&@^#!!!!!! 

Elevator door opens and we walk right out to see...a cool-demeanor-well-dressed-gentleman with a smile on his face that immediately implied no such harm has descended upon this area - yet. Of course, that reassuring welcome and asking if we had reservations and such immediately removed all the zombie crap in my mind and refocused my attention to this...nostalgic feeling. Where are we? I almost thought I had grey hair with a backed so hunched that complimented a croaking voice. (Ok, just kidding, I should describe something like Elvis instead...).

Our table overlooked the city in the evening lights. Although, I can't say it was mesmerizing or romantic in the least, we did somewhat enjoy the difference and spent some time pointing and figuring out the area while discussing what it probably was like 30 years ago.

Service was spectacular...and very accommodating. My lady has certain refined preferences with her vegetables and meat (unlike the recycling/food-processing plant that I am that eats everything up and then complains after as necessary) and our server made sure every single part of it was met.

The food wasn't as spectacular as their service and fell in the ""decent"" category. Both the New York and Rib-eye steaks came out done exactly the way we wanted them cooked...the former being medium well and the latter completely alive for the blood craving diner. Steaks were under-salted but that is not an issue in my books as a little toying with the salt dispenser on the table immediately got it exactly to the requirements of our differing palettes. 

The overall experience was decent and I would recommend a visit if you (a) want to get away from the overwhelming crowds on the strip; (b) crave a decent steak; (c) want to view old Vegas from atop a building without getting a room; or (d) want to port back to a different era.",4DN9WS2gf7Y2SYh0LaqDqA,12,11,3,bgBij-OEf0jN514Dhq-LNg

My husband and I had just gotten married and we were in Vegas for a work convention for his business. We were also celebrating my 31st birthday! A year before we were married we visited Binions after reading many reviews about a nice place to go. 

The prices here are on the higher end but there is something about old town Vegas that can't be beat. There is so much history within the walls of this place.

Both times we went we had fantastic servers. Both older gentleman who had been around for awhile. They were both full of tips and secrets about Vegas. The last visit we had the gentleman actually shared our wedding anniversary--he was very friendly!

My husband and I both got delicious steaks, baked potatoes and green beans. They brought these miniature bowls with sour cream, bacon bits and butter. The baked potato was cooked to perfection and the steak was so good that we both finished every bite!

If you have transportation to old town and looking for a place full of memories and a place to make new ones...Binions is it!

On nearly the top floor of the Binion's Casino and Hotel you can find a wonderful steak house in the heart of downtown Vegas.  Sure, you can go to another steak house du jour along the strip and be treated like a piece of meat or you can come here and enjoy one.

When the elevator door opens on floor SH (Steak House), prepare to step into a time machine whisking you back to the early days of Vegas.  A maitre d', classic dark dimly lit decor and red vinyl booths will welcome you.  

The Prime Rib was delicious and the Caesar salad was yummy.  My only suggestion for improvement was the dinner rolls were a bit dry.  Other then that, the Binion's Steakhouse was simply a classic experience and a nice way to escape the crowds.",iRfjtjSp3Bfo-KFSbiupmw,7,9,4,4eBuDk4Tn4fkwbo-gEWHUA

Its old Vegas at its best!!!

We have been here a few times over the years and I think what keeps us coming back is because it still has that nice feel to it of a romantic, classy dinner place,

Sitting near the window is really nice at night to see the view. We really enjoy the ambiance here.
I have always ordered the Lobster Bisque soup when I have been here. It has a really nice flavor with chunks of lobster in it and topped with cream always very good.
We always get one of the Rib eye steaks.. Always a great flavor and so big! They are like a 1lb each!  I never finish mine and always have a doggie bag to take home.
The garlic mashed are very good we always choose them. You can pick from a baked potatoe or roasted or you can get risotto,
The bread is always so good too my husband always wants more,

We have never had a problem with service from the moment walking in to being seated to leaving. Everyone is usually always friendly and accommodating. 

Have never had dessert because we are always so full, or maybe in his case full of bread lol

We recommend if your looking for a nice place to go down on Fremont street head here inside of Binions... It is a older casino and restaurant but that is what I like!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,4,6,4,mI8Ld9_g0iXDKaywQ7ttIA

It began with warm Sourdough Rolls: some with poppy seeds and some with sesame seeds.  Next up were yummy and salty Oysters Rockefeller.  Lobster Bisque was thick and tasty, with good lobster flavor.  And, French Onion Soup was hot and very tasty, with Mozzarella Cheese.  

My entr√©e of Filet Mignon was buttery and perfectly medium rare as ordered, accompanied by a very good Spinach Salad that contained egg and Hot Bacon Dressing.  Lobster was slightly sweet, and Roasted Red Potatoes were excellent.  So were a creamy B√©arnaise Sauce and Cabernet Sauce.  Carrots were prepared al dente.  Rounding out what was consumed by my party of four, Grilled Salmon and a medium-well Butterflied Filet were both pronounced good by friends at my table, but unwelcome spinach juice from Sauteed Spinach ran across one diner's plate.

Service was generally excellent, but ordered Garlic Mashed Potatoes were initially left off a fellow diner's plate.  One oddity was that Coke and Diet Coke were served in diminutive bottles.  

As a distinct bonus to fine food, from our table we enjoyed an excellent rooftop view of downtown and the valley floor below.  Because we had a play to attend at the Smith Center, there was little time to order dessert, and we were all too full anyway.
