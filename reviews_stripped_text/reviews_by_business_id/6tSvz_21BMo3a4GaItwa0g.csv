15052,2014-09-29,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,This is my new go to place for ayce sushi in vegas. Portions are small so that you can try a variety of different things. Quality of the fish is good...not what I would expect from an ayce place.  Service was top notch. Kid friendly....came here with kids and they were charged half price and a small trinket from the treasure chest to boot. I will be back.,VwdlWjBJ1pzqHJwRgra9_g,0,0,5,DEgOXVdSaUML-fnhevFuGg

The chefs are fast, and take care of you, especially if you sit at the bar. Very good off the strip sushi option; not too far so a split fare by cab from the strip is cheap (admittedly probably hard to get one coming back on the weekends though).

63562,2015-09-15,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"One year later and jjanga still doesnt disappoint! The quality of every piece of sushi is super fresh, and the rice underneath is small so in comparison you get so much more of your fav raw fish on top. For those who dont like raw foods theres also a huge collection of baked rolls and other cooked foods for you. The servers are very very polite and energetic, and all the orders came super fast, about one minute after i place the order. They do charge for left overs, but since each order has a small serving size you dont have to worry about ordering too much. I definitely recommend the garlic tuna, salmon belly(this isnt on the menu so ask them for it), poki salad, uni, flying fish egg, beef tataki, and the freshman roll. Also the choo choo special which is also not on the menu is amazingggg. I was worried that jjanga wouldnt live up to my impression of it last year, but it has most certainly surpassed it, and made me fall in love with jjanga once again. Thank you jjanga for this amazing experience! Hope I get to come back again next year!",N0Jq-qzJwBHEfAp57sm5bA,0,0,5,oVZJZkQRAp8PIy9Hj4Mn3g

Be sure to ask the staff about a ""stem"" card if you do the AYCE option. It is a loyalty card and after you buy 10 AYCE sushi you get the 11th one free.

Not only did they treat me and my party differently when they welcomed us in, in comparison to other guests, but they were rude and not attentive.  The deep fried food was terrible. I was so sick all night after having the crazy ass deep fried roll and the Japanese lasagna. I only tried those based on the reviews I read.  Makes me wonder if these reviewers were paid to rave about them.  I left my scarf behind accidently and I called them to confirm and put it aside. They didn't even look for it and told me they did not find it.  Such disrespect and disregard is unfathomable. This is no way to treat people who give you business.

The atmosphere was energetic and fun and everyone was welcoming right when we walked in.  The sushi was simply amazing.  We did the AYCE and the food just kept coming.  The wait staff were all very attentive to our needs, our plates and glasses were always full.  The yellowtail sashimi was a favorite, along with spicy tuna and salmon, but pretty much everything we tasted was fabulous.  I don't particularity like grapefruit or sake, but the grapefruit sake was like nectar of the Gods!  After sake, and tons of sushi, we had mochi for dessert, along with a glass of red.  Even the wine glasses were fun!  They were painted with fun sayings on them.  Mine had a dog on it and it said ""fetch me my wine"" haha!  Loved it.

But I was most excited about AYCE uni sushi. i LOVE LOVE LOVE uni. Unfortunately, the uni here was disgusting. It was dry, chewy, and dark brown. The flavor was really fishy, slightly sour, and very bitter. We told the server the issue and asked for a replacement order and they gave me another sushi with the dry chewy dark brown uni. I was really disappointed and asked if i can get a fresh one that's not dry and nasty.... and he brushed it off and said ""all uni is from the same box"". But if you know that box of uni is bad, WHY ARE YOU STILL SERVING IT?? After getting bad uni for the third time, I gave up.

We came with a group of 7, and although the restaurant was slow with less than 7 other guests aside from our group, the food came out slow, and 5 minutes apart from eachother. So when the final entree came out, most were finished. And no daicon available either. Food was pretty good but not 5 Star quality.",vGvB9vwhqpY_jKeWOkJKEg,0,0,3,E4MzUS0j-EhcUVz1bbQfBA

We decided to do the all you can eat. Aside from the nigiri, all of the rolls use the cheapest imitation crab mixed with lots of mayo. Most of the items use really poor ingredients. The Hawaiian Roll had veggies in it!? Who does that?! For example, in the sashimi salad there was iceberg lettuce, like the kind from a salad mix at the grocery store. The best items was the mochi which was probably store bought too. Definitely not a real sushi restaurant.

AYCE is definitely a rip off.  Even with the ""Happy Hour"" for late night ($20 lunch price instead of the $25 dinner price after 9 pm or something like that) the place is still on my shit list.

First, the rolls were small and the portions of the appetizers were TINY.  An order of agedashi tofu literally means one cube of tofu.  An order of seaweed salad is about 2 inches in diameter.  An order of the garlic gingko is 3 gingko nuts plus a ton of garlic (which, if I may add, we were asked about why we did not finish. Yes, they expected us to finish all slices of the garlic that were used to stir-fry the darn nuts -- don't even get me started there).

That brings me to my second point.  The waiters stand over you and won't clear the table unless you've finished literally every freaking bit of the meal.  We ordered the udon noodles and they didn't clear our bowl because there was still some soup at the bottom.  No kidding.  I get that they don't want to waste food, but it felt more like eating in prison.

And most importantly, the food just didn't taste right - period. I started getting a stomachache in the middle of the meal.  Never again.",MF8zBfvc9Ns8MsNeZq6y7g,0,0,1,WulXAsFSKCdi6nG1NA9Qyg

I guess each server thought the other was checking on them, but it wasn't happening. We waited almost 45 minutes before flagging someone down to keep ordering sushi and to get a roll we head ordered what seemed like ages ago. Everyone was super friendly it's just inefficient. After all this flagging down we had to do, they of course tacked on a 20% gratuity and told us we could only split the check 3 ways, causing us to have to work out with each other who will be paying for who.

You can guess their food and service to be nice just because they just opened but, ever since my first visit, i've been going there every week now and their service is getting better and better each week! they are getting busier every week too which is a positive thing. I guess that everyone feels the same way as I do about this place. 
Foods are great, comes out fast and sometimes special sashimi orders come out to from the sushi chef which is unusual compare to any other restaurant that does AYCE.

The quality of fish are amazing! so does the kitchen orders. When I usually dine in for AYCE place, I do not bother ordering any of the kitchen foods but JJANGA is different. On top of all the nice sushi and rolls, there are delicious kitchen foods. It's as if I have to come back the next day to just to AYCE kitchen foods. lol 

This is the only place I dine in now for sushi.",Pimk8Cl8lmgBntV_uC4v2Q,1,0,5,8HaPcxcBZSQH-uQZApPd-A

Good considering Friday is a busy night for most restaurants. The atmosphere is cool, clean, and modern. The service was fast and friendly. 

Now on to the good stuff: the food. Their menu is extensive and a little overwhelming. We filled up in nigiri which in my opinion had the perfect fish to rice ratio unlike most places where you get a tiny slice if fish over a huge portion of rice. The yuzu yellowtail was awesome .. The citrusy brightness of the yuzu paired well with the fresh hamachi. Other tasty nigiri we had was the garlic and Cajun albacore. Another thing I liked about the menu is they have some rice-less rolls which the wifey really appreciated. The Fresh-men roll was good and wrapped in rice paper and we had another rice-less
roll wrapped in cucumber. They have great appetizers too. The sashimi salads (there are 4-5 on the menu) are limit one per customer but are so good! Dessert is included in AYCE price and you can get 1 scoop of ice cream and 1 mochi. Wish they had better desserts but the quality of the fish makes up for it.",QOK_Wgx1hP2cy7E7_ZJs1g,1,1,4,1tR-zDmMLnGW5jEifgvw8Q

Our family goes to AYCE sushi quite often and typically appetizers are barely 1/4 cup of food and twice the price.

Restaurant was clean, and the staff was very attentive and sweet. Our server, Alex, had a lot of suggestions for us to try and was SO knowledgeable about the menu, that he could list ingredients in some rolls right off the top of his head. He was also very personable and was patient with all our questions about the menu.

I've been here twice now and I've had a so so experience. I do like the oysters.  The most recent time I went, they changed their serving size to one because of the season. I'm not sure when oyster season is so I'm not sure if that's accurate information. The salmon nigiri wasn't that great, nor was it terrible. I really like the beef tataki. It was pretty tasty. It's a seared beef over rice. I was surprised that the golden scallop was deep fried. I should have read the reviews. I really enjoyed the baby octopus the first time that I had it, but the second time wasn't that great. 


Apparently you can order salmon belly, but that's only if it's available. I did try the spring mountain roll which has no rice. There was a lot of sauce on top. It was a pretty good roll except for the abundance sauce.

When I asked what is included in the sashimi, the waiter asked the sushi chef (I believe he was the owner).  The sushi chef asked what I liked and catered the sashimi order to my preference and threw in two extra pieces!  He was awesome!  What was even more awesome was the fact that the sashimi was excellent, good quality product.  I was eating as slow as possible to savor the flavors.  The sashimi was so good I got an order of the yuzu yellowtail.  The sushi rice had the right amount of moisture, the yuzu sauce was addictive and green on top added a nice crunch.

The tempura portion of the lunch was fine.  The breading was done well and it was not greasy, but I wish there was eggplant tempura.  
 
The house salad was also fine.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp but the salad dressing was just okay.  I believe it was a mix of shredded carrots, mayo/salad cream and ginger.  

After all that, the chef spontaneously offered me orange slices for dessert.  It was a nice way to end my meal.  

As for service: overall, the sushi chef mentioned earlier is the star of this experience.  The other two servers on the floor were polite and friendly, but one did forget my water for about five minutes.  

The part that was most surprising though was the price of my experience.  For five pieces of sashimi, two pieces of hamachi nigiri, bowl of rice, salad and six pieces of tempura:  under $12!

805473,2017-03-03,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Very inconsistent!

I've been here several times and you never know if it will be a good experience or bad. It's always a hit and miss. Sometimes the food is really good and sometimes very poor quality. And sometimes, within the same meal, you can have inconsistent quality of food.

But when it's good, it's really good, though. Perfect rice to fish proportion, fresh ingredients, food comes out fast, very fast, efficient and friendly service, seasoning on point! But when it's bad...too much rice, too little fish, the same kind of sushi on the same plate can be made different shapes and sizes - some will have more rice, the fish will be different thickness, different size and different shape, the seasoning will be different. Once I ordered the grilled mackerel and not only was it overcooked, it smelled so bad. When the server came to take it away after our meal, I pointed out that it wasn't fresh, she took one look at it and said, ""Oh yeah, it's not fresh."" So why serve it?

But the one thing that they've managed to be consistent in - rude chefs. The customers see how rude they are to the servers. When they make a mistake, they're pissed off and blame the servers. Under the old management, the chefs were rude when the owner was not around. But under the new management, they're rude all the time. Once, one of the chefs asked a man sitting at the bar to give us our order (I'm assuming that the man owns the restaurant or he is the manager because he walks in and out of the kitchen), the man turned to us and rudely said, ""Hey, is this your order?"" and made us get up and get the plate from him! We could also hear him yelling at the workers. Fantastic management style!

808449,2014-09-06,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"I used to like Jjanga a lot better and not saying the quality has gone that far downhill but I think I finally come to a realization that quality should surpass quantity, especially sushi... .

For AYCE place, Jjanga is pretty good I guess.  Most AYCE are run by Koreans, no exception here, not like I have  a problem with it.  The fish/rice ratio is great, some places definitely pack lots of rice on you, but Jjanga is pretty good on smaller nigiri with decent size fish and little rice.  

Service is always great.  Everyone's happy to help and always come check on you.  All the sushi chefs, Jjanga, koo koo, choo chop, Ricky.. all friendly and try to be buddy buddy with you when you sit at the bar.

Not the cleanest place, the table/bar often feel greasy.  They do wipe down after each use of course, but don't wipe down enough or just same greasy towel over and over again, especially the edge of the table where your elbow touches... ok enough of that.  It's only $22 lunch and $26 dinner for sushi, what do you expect.

Food:  for the most part, sushi taste ok.  Your typical pre frozen, thaw out pieces of fish from typical AYCE places.  The thing I have a problem with is how all the fishes are laying right next to each other, which you'd notice in not AYCE sushi restaurants, that's a NO NO.  Each type of fish should have their own space, not necessary cross contamination on fishes but it's just not right.  And the bad part is that they service seared beef as nigiri and on some rolls too.  When the whole loin of seared beef sits right on top of a filet of salmon sashimi, that's JUST WRONG.  I was very tempting to take a picture of it and send it to the health department.  You don't mix poultry with fish, especially they are both raw!  Beef right on top of fish, and you serve that?  How are you kidding me.  And it's not just a one time mishap accident type, It's often that.  All the different type of fish are laying next to or on top of each other, along with beef, come on?  Even though i didn't get food poisoning after dining there, it sure leaves a bad taste in my mouth and in my mind.  

And oyster lovers.. if you think they freshly crack open fresh oysters to serve you, then you are SO WRONG.  They recycle the oyster shell (they have a bucket for that) and they use pre packaging oysters (no shell on, like the ones you see in a glass jar at your grocery store) from a box to fill the oyster shells and put garnish on it.  Definitely NOT fresh and frankly so gross.   If you sit at the bar next time, you can watch they make it.  How clean can those oyster shells be, especially they've been recycled from other patrons, do they clean and wipe each shell good before they put another oyster meat on top?  Think twice before you order it next time.  When I went the first time, I had no idea, ordered it, tasted gross, then saw how they make it.. go figure.

Jjanga is probably still my go to place for AYCE when I feel really cheap and have a moment weakness of spending less on sushi. But honestly, I wouldn't want to go often as knowing how much germ I've consumed by trying to be cheap....",bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,4,0,2,6Hvpj-scp4GbkyJu1wGZbw

Jjanga is a sushi oasis in the middle of the desert!!!

We saddled up to the bar, b/c the place was packed, only to be served by JJANGA himself!!!!  Vegas luck baybee!

After selecting all you can eat, we were stumped by choice and items titled ""Slap your momma"" and ""slap your mother in law"". 

No matter. Jjanga asked us if we had any allergies (NO!) and liked spicy food (YES!)  and swept us right up into sashimi heaven. 

Between bites and murmurs of pleasure, we watched dish after dish appear... and disappear. Most were works of art and ultimately the subject of a snapchat portfolio of images. All looked too good to eat. ALMOST...

So... here's where I pull the ""my-partner's-Asian, we're foodies-from-NY, have-lived-in-Cali, eaten-our-way across-Asia-yadda-yadda"" card and say how much we were BOTH IMPRESSED  by the flavors, and freshness of the plates JJ served that night. 

So hyped that we tried to get him to open a spot in DC. Lucky for y'all in Las Vegas he declined. 

JJ: if your reading this, the offer still stands! Reverse manifest destiny and find your fortune!!!

Fellow gourmands and friends in the feast: get your butts off the strip and head to Jjang for Unforgettable, melt in your mouth sushi and an experience that whet's all five senses!

Sushi was simply excellent and just the right small amount of rice combined with super fresh ingredients. In addition they have Uni which is a must for me. Their rice-less rolls were interesting but did not have wow factor. Poke and sashimi salad was great. Stay away from the sushi burritos, too much rice and fake crab.

We waited to get service the whole night while they focused on one table. There was much attitude from the server when asking just for a sauce on the side. In the end he wouldn't take our punch card which was full and he said they were under new management and don't take them any more. They just need to change the name of the restaurant!

Some of the dishes I highly recommend are: baked mussel, poki salad, boom boom, and coconut flake ice cream (chocolate flavor).

Other menus that are worth trying/regular are tempura, Screaming O, Bunny & Bonny, and nigiri. 

I wouldn't order Touch Down, Mountain, and Green Tea Ice cream & Mochi.

1.) We came at 8:30pm on a Saturday & the hostess warned us that if we ate there, they would be closing in half an hour. I asked if that was a normal since Yelp & their doors say they close at 2:00am, and she said, ""No, just tonight. We are closing early at 9 tonight for a special occasion."" Being our first time & planning to do all you can eat, we didn't want to be rushed & opted to eat somewhere else. Strike one. 

2.) We attempted to come again at 5:00pm on a Sunday. Yelp showed they were open so we headed over... only to find the doors locked & a handwritten schedule on the door with whiteout over Sunday that read, ""CLOSED ON SUNDAYS."" This had to be new because the same information was on Yelp and on maps. Strike two. 

3.) And lastly... we drove over just now at 6:00pm on a Saturday. Checked Yelp and verified they are open until 2:00am... only to find the venue filled with construction and a note on the front door that says they are renovating until October 8th. Seriously? Seriously?!

However, I have one big overall gripe with the restaurant. I'm not sure if it was just the time we came in, or just a bad night, but the service got progressively worse throughout the evening. The service was fine towards the beginning of our meal, but after the second round of plates it would be a good 20 minutes before we saw our waiter again. 

Another more minor problem was the proximity to other customers. The tables are spaced very close together, which can lead to an uncomfortable dining experience for some. In fact, the lady next to me practically sneezed on me and made me very uncomfortable throughout the rest of the night, as her child was also climbing around our table. Not necessarily fault of the restaurant, just bad patrons, however I think this is something that can be fixed very easily.",7RPRnLI2aWbc4LKd_E9AHA,0,0,4,Cln5UHuE_Qilk6yzN44Icg

According to their own thermostat the temp in the restaurant was 89 degrees!  One of our party is 89 years old and we felt it unwise to sit and swelter. I admit to being disturbed by the attitude of one of the servers who was chiding me for leaving after all the trouble he went through to setup a table for 5.  Really? No compassion for the senior with us.  One wonders how good an idea it is to serve sushi in such a warm room.  Scott the manager was not there but probably would have handled things better.  Hopefully they will fix the a/c better and not complain if people choose not to stay.  Actual sushi is good but again the quality seems to be slipping.  Service is ok.

1352461,2014-05-07,10,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"After seeing so many people go to this place and mention how good it is, decided to go try it out with my family.

Korean owned japanese restaurant, located in an EH area of town. Not the nicest area lol... 

Decor, gotta give it to them. Overall i think it looks pretty nice. Lots of wooden fencing accents and along the walls. 

AYCE (All-you-can-eat) sushi is $20.95 for lunch (1130A - 300P) and $25.95 for dinner (300P - 200A). Also mentions about having an ""ordering time limited to 45 minutes for lunch, and 1 hour for dinner. dining time is not limited"". This doesn't really make sense to me but its never really enforced anyway. 

As always, order a sample of nigiri to test, and order more if good ! so this is what i ordered XD (not at the same time, over course of dinner) 

A mention of the rice. I'm not the pickiest but im not the kind of person that will say everything and anything is good. I do have a favorite place in terms for rice used in sushi. Rice is a compliment to the fish that it is paired with. Both have to be good in quality for a good experience. One can not be good without the other. 

This rice. Not much flavored. Breaks apart. Mushy. If i had to rate just the rice? 1 out of 5. 

Tuna (Maguro) - dark red. mushy. little to no flavor. doesn't seem really fresh either. cant sense any metallic taste to the fish either 

Yellowtail (Hamachi) - nice pinkish color. sweet. 

Red Snapper (Izumidai) - nice color. good texture. 

Halibut (Hirame) - not really fresh. no ""bite"" 

Salmon (sake) - probably one of the better items of the nigiri list. tastes fatty and fresh. too bad rice was bad. otherwise would have been good. 

Smoked Salmon - the most awkward one (ordered by cousin). not like any of the usual smoked salmon i've had before. Thick slice. slightly lighter and firmer than a normal salmon piece. you can smell the smoked aroma fairly quickly. taste was a bit salty but expected for a smoked salmon. 

Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) - not bad. the eel was a little cold. not sure if it's because of sitting on table or what. eel texture was mid mushy mid firm. sauce was normal. sweet. 

Salmon Egg (Ikura) - ""fishy popping boba"" as what my cousin called it. had its usual salty flavor but may not be fresh either. had a ""fishy"" taste. 

Egg (Tamago) - surprisingly, this was nicely made. Thick cut piece. presentation was a bit non-traditional. imagine the size of a fish nigiri cut. folded in half. and cut mid way to make a pyramid over a small ball of rice. not only did it not hold the rice, it was a bit weird (presentation wise). taste wise, it was good. nice and sweet. 

Sweet Shrimp (Amaebi) - Not really sweet. Small shrimp as well. Not exactly sure if its even real amaebi. A tip had mentioned it is not real amaebi. more like regular shrimp marinated in a sweet sauce. 

Beef Tataki - worst one of all. Not saying the way it is done is bad. but the quality of the beef was bad. almost all the beef had a fairly big chewy piece that made it seem like you just ate a piece of beef chewing gum. beef wasnt seasoned either. so quite plain in taste overall. 

Kake Udon - small bowl of udon in a kake (light broth made with laver, bonito flakes, soy sauce). udon was cooked pretty good. still a good ""bite"". not overcooked. Good way to stuff yourself cuz there wasnt much other items that caught my attention 

Appetizers ! 

Baked Green Mussel - not sure what sauce they used. some sweet sauce mixed with the japanese mayo.... mussel was warm at best. mussel was in whole pieces. not cut in half. 

Shrimp Tempura - also one of the better items of the meal. nicely breaded and fried. nice light golden color. crispy and hot. 

Golden Scallop - deep fried to a light brown color. overcooked (for my preference) in terms of scallop. even the center was fully cooked. at least its a real scallop. 

Grilled Mackerel (Rec' by Michael K) - overgrilled. meat was a bit dry. as expected from mackerel, lots of small bones. not skilled to eat it fast XD 

Salmon Skin Handroll w/ Fresh Salmon (Rec' by Michael K) - also one of the better items of the meal. Fairly stuffed hand roll with crispy fried salmon skin, but also cuts of fresh salmon pieces as well. Good recommendation ! 

Spider (soft shell crab, crab, avocado, cucumber, gobo w/ eel sauce) - Soft shell crab was a bit cold. Not sure if the crab was fried before hand or what not. Didn't notice the gobo in the roll. 

Burning Your Ass (spicy soft shell crab, tuna, cucumber, crab, spicy tuna, spicy kiss sauce, mustard sauce, jalapeno, sriracha on top) - to be honest, i did NOT notice there was soft shell crab in this. yeah there was sriracha and jalepeno on it. and spicy tuna, but eh... its no where near burning MY ass XD 

Overall experience, eh. Service was good. Tea is $1. Food was not up to what people have said. Most likely won't come back again.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,14,9,2,zS2Dyk2QGGN5yJYYbEXHDA

The uni wasn't fishy or an overpowering taste of iodine either, it was a great sea urchin roe, also the oyster was a decent size and was paired with a nice neutralizing sauce. I really loved the no rice rolls, it was a fresh change from the usual heavy, but fluffy and still besutiful, Japanese Sushi rice. 

There were also a few things that my family and the only thing that we would've liked to see was a little more contrast in the creamy sauces. It was a bit much for some of the rolls. Perhaps a squeeze of lemon would change that?

1393443,2015-03-12,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Went here earlier this evening and my overall experience was so-so.  I had the All You Can Eat dinner for about 26 dollars per person not including tax and tip. 

I really liked the food. Overall, it was very fresh and a lot of really good flavours and variety. Many different types of rolls including baked, deep fried, vegetarian, basic, no rice, etc. Also a BUNCH of appetizers. 

The only complaint I had about the food would be the size of the nigiri. They were about half the size of nigiri you would get elsewhere. Obviously, this wasn't a problem since I got the All You Can Eat but I would have been VERY upset if this was A La Cart. 

As far as the environment of the place went, some of the tables can be a little close to other customers. Also, the booths are large compared to the table. Both my partner and I were sitting at the edge of our seats in order to reach the table, and at the edge of our seats neither of us were very comfortable. 

Finally, my biggest complaint about this place was the service. We were getting served and checked up on a decent amount at the beginning of our meal, but after the first round of rolls came around the service just started getting slower, and slower, and slooooower. After our second round of sushi came, it was at least 20 minutes after we finished until we were asked if we wanted anymore. After that, it took another 30 minutes until they brought our check around. They didn't even ask us if we wanted more, they just brought the check. I would have given this place five stars had it not been for this terrible service. I hope tonight was just a fluke.

First and definitely last time in my life I tried AYCE!
 Looking at all 5 star reviews for JJANGA, husband and I decided to give it a try. What a horrible mistake. 
Tiny pieces of not so fresh fish. The smallest appetizers I ever seen. 
Should mention ikura and uni. I am from Russia, so I know a thing or two about caviar. Black caviar and and red caviar (salmon roe). My guess is that salmon roe served to us in JJANGA, was stored in a refrigerator (not in a freezer, which is fine) for minimum 2-3 weeks. It was bitter and smelly!  
I've eaten a lot of uni. A couple of times we even drove to CA just to get fresh uni. However, I must don't know enough about sea urchin, because I cannot imagine, how spoiled uni must be to turn BLACK? 
 I am not even going to talk about rolls. Will just mention that 99% of rolls are made form spicy imitation crab meat and cream cheese. I cannot call ""sushi"" cream cheese wrapped in rice.

Menu has a lot to explore, and I love that the rolls aren't just your standard ""special"" rolls on everyone else's menu in town. The cowboy roll with seared beef on top especially caught my attention. Mega bonus points for having SIX RICELESS ROLLS! SAY WHAT!? Unheard of, and they're almost all delicious. Freshmen Roll, Spring Mountain Roll, and Tuna Naruto are my favorites in this category. The handrolls and ""burritos"" are huge and delicious- pick from the Monkey Roll or go classic with salmon skin. 

Side and appetizer dishes here are also pretty unique (ask for several of the mushroom ball), and the nigiri is thick-cut and delicious- appreciate how they use a proportionate amount of rice rather than gigantic mounds, as found elsewhere in town. 

AYCE lunch price (til 3PM) is a super-reasonable $21, dinner is open til 2AM and goes up to $27- adds extra dishes like uni and amaebi nigiri, grilled mackerel, sashimi or poke salad, and mochi for dessert. Bummed that the mochi isn't available at lunch price, wish they'd add some desserts as they are a bit lacking in this area.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,9,4,SdRs8OV-d2kTYpbnLaswsA

I don't know my servers name probably because he failed to pay attention to us, and give us a proper greeting. I heard this place gets pretty packed so the fact it was dead made me extra excited to eat! The first few orders come out, the salmon nigiri had this weird like blueish/whitish circle on all every piece and I was kinda freaked out about eating it, it resembled mold. The first roll came out and it look super good, the crumbs, the sauces, and the cuts were all equal. And for each roll after that it was down hill. For one there was only four tables max but three sushi chefs behind the bar with no one seating there. I tried to make eye contact with ANYONE and they all failed to pay attention. The chefs were more focused on themselves, they seemed to be able ot have conversations with everyone the host, servers, and some guy not wearing the uniform, not sure if he was a shift manager or what.. The didn't really want to make the sushi and that is for sure. The effort all around just sadly lacked, some rolls didn't have sauces on them at ALL. Some fish was left out, and my biggest pet peeve of all time is when the rolls are not cut the same size! And some were large some were tiny, and ontop of everything the food wasn't even rolled tight. The server wasn't taking plates from our tables, and was kind of just going around us the whole time. We didn't get our water refilled, and I am surprised we even stayed for as long as we did. I also have heard this location isn't as great as the other one. But I will NOT be checking this brand out again. Fish quality and service took a big 0/5 for me. 
Also when my man had asked about substitutions for fish he just blurted out no, and anyone who works in the service industry (I DO) knows you never say no! Just word it differently and be polite about it!

To be expected at AYCE sushi, the quality of the fish wasnt great but not bad... the nigiri was good, but most of the rolls fell apart before we can dip it in the soy sauce.  The ""no rice rolls"" seemed like a great option, but unfortunately, they were tasteless and covered in so much of the spicy mayo sauce. 

Menu is also inconsistent and not intuitive. While 1 order of agedashi tofu is a single cube of fried tofu or 1 piece of gyoza, you get 2 pieces of shrimp tempura or 2 pueces of nigiri sushi.  While one side provides an explanation of each of the specialty rolls, the back side is confusing with so many ""rules"" - some items are available for dinner only while other items are available both meal period but only 1 order per person.  The server was nice; however being so new, she didnt know the ingredients in the big menu nor the Japanese equivalent.

Summary:
We waited 4 hours for our food
Not all our food came
We left AYCE sushi hungry
They had the nerve to charge us and even include 18% tip!

I came with a group of 7 and they were busy and understaffed so they sat us in a private room because they didn't have seating in the main room available. This was fine with us except they seemed to forget about us. After 30 minutes some girl came in and asked us for our order without giving us menus. We asked for some things then asked for menus to order additional items. 1 hour since we got there... another girl walks in brings us one menu for the 7 of us and then takes our order again because apparently the first girl who took our order was a busser. So we order again. After another 40 minutes they bring out some food but not all of it. And some of the rolls they brought us we didn't even order. We wait another hour and at this point have been there for 2.5 hours. No more food. One of the guys in our group goes to ask them where our food is and they say they lost the order. So we order again (this is our third time ordering) and we wait... and then after another 30 or so minutes they bring us one or two rolls out of the eight rolls we ordered. So we asked where the other rolls were and we were told they were having a problem in the kitchen but they would come. So we keep waiting and they don't bring out the rolls. At this point we're fed up so we ask to speak with a manager. We've been there 4 hours and just want to leave. The manager offered us 15% off but that wasn't enough so after complaining more they gave us 50% off. None of us even wanted to pay because we were still hungry and you shouldn't leave AYCE sushi hungry. They also never bussed our table and left a bunch of trash, dirty plates and leftover food. It was disgusting. 

Overall this place sucks and it's the worst sushi experience I've ever had. Unfortunately their food is good but the terrible experience and awful service means I will never be going back.",frLwvItjWWJDYwU_MX3CyA,1,0,1,tAZzooZCv36HtIRRLqY3IA

They had prompt service, and were fairly friendly but nothing to stands out at this place, even the large monitors playing non-stop K-pop is no longer the hip thing.

A+ all around! Was very impressed with the service, food and kid-friendly environment!

Dinner AYCE price - $25.95, pretty normal compared to other places.

Menu includes tons of items from nigiri, soup and salads, appetizers, special handrolls, spicy rolls, no rice rolls, baked rolls, fried rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls!

Loved that they don't believe in smothering everything in the rice.. Or sauce..

Fiancé had tons of their nigiri from the looks of it, the rice to fish ratio was good --not too much rice!
I started off with the salmon skin handroll, had chunks of the actual salmon meat with the crispy skin! My fave at any sushi restaurant!

Then proceeded with a couple rolls :
* Riceless Fresh Men Roll - had tuna, crab, shrimp and avocado wrapped in rice paper, side of the ginger, mustard sauce. It was a bit too gingery for me, regardless it was still a good, fresh roll.
* Monkey Burrito Roll - this was SOO good! An actual sushi burrito with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and crab wrapped in soy paper came with spicy mayo on the side, decent size, and wasn't too filling!
* Something Wrong #69 - shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, tuna and salmon with their spicy garlic ponzu! I love anything garlic ponzu! This roll was not that spicy, just had a lil kick to it! 
* Brown Rice Mountain Roll - my least favorite roll only because there was nothing mind blowing about it -- cream cheese, avocado and salmon all baked together. The brown rice was overcooked, in my opinion. 
And I couldn't handle the cheesiness of the roll.

We also had a couple appetizers or sides : 
Chicken Wings - really good (I mean you really can't mess this up)! Not too much breading just like how my son likes it!
Fries - natural cut, real potatoes!
Bulgogi - delicious grilled, marinated beef! 

Service was quick! There were too much bodies, making it a bit confusing on who's waiter is who's. But waters were always filled, dishes were taken as soon as they were empty, and food came out within minutes!

Can't reiterate enough how much I love that they're kid friendly! They even have a treasure chest filled with toys for the kids to take before they leave! So awesome! 

Must try and definitely recommended to families and everyone else!

The service was good however they kept bringing us other people's food. They would just quickly sit the plates down without saying what we were getting & eventually we noticed that none of us had ordered what kept coming over. This was pretty annoying as we must have received 4-5 wrong items.

We used to frequent most of the popular sushi spots on the entire west side of Vegas but from now on we have no reason to go anywhere but Jjanga.  The chefs are amazing and have great personalities (take good care of them and they'll get creative for you) and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The grapefruit sake is awesome on its own or in a sake-bomb and the menu is refreshingly different from other places around town.  We like the fun, upbeat atmosphere and have enjoyed the sushi bar, small groups in the main dining area as well as large parties in their private room.

When we were in town visitng they thought they would give this restaurant another chance.  However, both our experience and the food were not great.  The sashami did not all seem fresh.  It was  served at room temperature rather than cold and when it's fresh it's floppy on your chopstick.  Some of them were stiff.  They were also sliced really thin. The nigiri was below average.  Udon soup was ok.  When my husband ate one of the mussels from the soup he said he could tell immediately that it wasn't fresh and didn't taste right.  Sure enough, he later got sicker than a dog.  Service wasn't great at all.  Our party was missing three sushi plates and several soy dishes.  When I asked for three soy dishes the waiter brought back two.  When I asked for one more he said, ""Can't you just share?""  It was so insulting!  The waitress did not come by to offer us more beverages.  Music was also too lout.

We were seated promptly as the restaurant was nearly empty and waited on right away. We chose to do the a la Carter menu as opposed to the all you can eat because we weren't that hungry.

The main reason I gave 3 stars is because the menu options here are very limited. The choices are raw fish, sushi, raw fish, and well, sushi. For a name that includes ""Japanese restaurant"" my boyfriend was hoping for some steak or shrimp skewer options like most places have. 

As far as the all you can eat sushi goes (which I had on my first visit) it is really nothing special. The sushi is good and fresh, but nothing to write home about. I can name about three other places that have a better all you can eat options for a better price and with more variety.

The food we did order, edamame, two carpaccios, and two rolls, were very good and tasted fresh. The server was also very generous with the ginger which I love.

Overall, I may return to this restaurant at some point, but I'd recommend checking out other all you can eat options in Vegas as they are plentiful.",Dto0VDsSLg0ycVKwFylh2Q,1,0,3,5IHI9G-JDotu7cK9FMe6UQ

It is a type of restaurant you would visit for quantity not quality. The ingredients were not as fresh as you would wanted....don't order anything with Unagi, it is disgusting.  However, some of the tofu dish was not bad and sushi was ok. They have one of those rule of not leaving food behind but this could be a touture when some dish doesn't taste good. If you have dinner buffet, they have sashimi salads in various way. Some of them with no mayo tasted much better than one with. Some of the appetizers were better tasting such as tofu, skewers and calamari. They do have various rolls and Maki for almost everyone's liking. Please note, if you are a hard core Japanese food person, this is not the place, but if you occasionally have Japanese food with your friends and family, you might like this place more than I do as they do have karaoke etc. I also saw lots of families dine here as well.

1781570,2014-12-12,1,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"I had heard many good things about this new sushi place called jjanga. I knew that it had replaced the old restaurant Shobu that was there - for this reason, I was not really sure if I wanted to go eat at this sushi place, because I thought it would just be the same as Shobu but just a new name. But when nurses and doctors of all races were raving about how fresh the sushi was and how good everything was on the menu, I knew I had to check it out. 

When I first arrived, I was seated immediately, but then the seat was taken from me haha The waiter did not know there was a waitlist and apologized like 10x for the mistake. It wasnt a big deal, because we were seated within 10 minutes anyways. The decor of the place is exactly the same as the restuarant that used to be there, except there are pictures of all the sushi chefs on the walls - really huge pictures of them as if youre in an episode of iron chef! 

My friends and I chose the AYCE option - dinner is 24.95 and I think lunch was only 21.95. There were lots of choices to choose from, especially in the appetizer section. I have never seen an appetizer menu that big and full of different things. I probably tried about half the things on it! They come out in very small portions so its perfect in that you can try a little bit of everything without getting too stuffed! When our sushi started to come out, I noticed that the rice to fish ratio was great! More fish than rice is always a good thing. Also, the fish was very fresh and so dericious. They don't do half orders though. oh well. 

If you have trouble picking something, the waiters are more than willing to help you pick something. Just tell them what youre feeling or what types of fish you want with what type of style and BAM! they tell you what you should get haha

I thought they were good in the last place but it is nothing compared to what they make now. We will stay loyal to these chefs because they have always taken care of us and make our experiences special! I recommend the fresh men roll and the sexy time roll. We all shared and everything I tried was amazing but these 2 were my favorite because they were new on their menu.

All the rolls were creative and delicious. Pretty much every combination you can think of was on there which is awesome. For instance, I hate cucumbers in my rolls, but instead of having to ask them to hold the cucumber, they have a whole selection of rolls without it already.  Also they don't overload their rolls with rice like other AYCE places do. 

The nigiri was thick and fresh. Appetizers were all pretty good. The only thing I didn't enjoy, was the house salad, but whatever. Who besides me goes to AYCE and gets salad anyways?!?

Service was fairly attentive. We had a part of 10, so I understand it can get overwhelming with all the orders and reorders coming at you constantly, but they had 2 girls waiting on us and a busboy as well and they just weren't refilling or clearing the empties as well as they could.

The first time we ever stepped foot into JJANGA, they were seating us at one table, and I asked if they could please sit us at another table. It may not seem like much, but the second time we went, the gentleman remembered us and promptly took us to the same table and said, here's your table again. He then went over the menu with us, which is pretty extensive and suggested some of the items on there that we hadn't tried before. 

Moreover, he also then surprised us with a special roll just for us and some free sake on the house. The gesture was awesome, but too bad we don't drink alcohol. As I started to place my order, which by the way, I always order the same thing at any Sushi Restaurant, Salmon (Sake), Yellowtail (Hamachi), Fresh Water Eel (Unagi), Crunch Rolls, Caterpillar Rolls, and Seaweed Salad. The waiter also remembered this from our first visit, and noticing that I am probably a creature of habit when it comes to Sushi, the gentleman also suggested that we try the JJANGA Burrito, which is Shrimp, Broccoli Tempura, Crab, Masago, Green Onion, Furikake, and Layu with Soy Paper. May I say that it was pretty darn delicious and we are now addicted to it. If you haven't tried it yet, well then you should. The fact that he remembered that was pretty impressive! On a side not, I also like the fact that they use a proportionate amount of rice and not like most other places where they put an enormous amount of rice.

FYI: AYCE (All-You-Can-Eat) is $20.95 for Lunch (11:30am-3:00pm) and $25.95 for dinner (3pm-2am).

All-in-all, all of my experiences here have been awesome to say the least. They captured me with their service and this is my go-to spot for Sushi in Vegas.

My last visit was one of my most enjoyable AYCE experiences at a reasonable price. All of the rolls were unique and creative. Not one of the rolls was left unfinished. Their nigiri was fresh tasting except for the uni.. Which was a shame! But at least the fish to rice ratio was just right.. Only a little bit of rice with a nice cut of fish. My group came in around 7-8pm and it was pretty busy! It's my second time here so we'll see how today's Dinner AYCE compares to last time's experience!

1/8/2015:

Came in around 3:30pm.. With a group of 4. Kind of empty.. And seemed like a few sushi chefs in the back were working at a steady pace. The first thing I noticed was that our food came out at a much slower pace.. Practically one plate/roll at a time with pauses in between. Me being an AYCE type of guy, this ""portion control"" kind of bothers me. Didn't experience that last time. Although it's not too much of an issue because everything that came out was delicious! 

The favorites for nigiri were the yuzu yellowtail, Cajun albacore, beef tataki and the garlic tuna. Even the uni had a much fresher taste. Each roll was pretty good, too. Don't remember the names, although I did prefer the special rolls over and of their baked/fried rolls. Also, the baked mussels and the oysters were pretty basic but tasty nonetheless. Other dishes/appetizers that stood out were the mini pork steak?? the baby octopus and the baked dynamite.

Also beware!! They sometimes either miss an item or forget your order.. This probably doesn't happen to everyone, but just a little reminder to the waiter/waitress is a simple solution.

All in all this place does it for me! Although, I keep this place in rotation when it comes to AYCE. There are too many sushi joints in this town to keep count.. This place deserves a solid 4.5 for the food and ambience. Plus, they have stamp cards for AYCE",EW5Og_701TjmUAe696EJMQ,1,0,5,_HiQL0J9P6BLA_0Dcbc08g

This was my third visit here. I liked my first visit years ago when they had Korean entrées like bibimbap and budaejigae more than their conversion to a sushi place. The only items that are remotely Korean are the bulgogi app, sweet rice cakes and pumpkin soup

I ordered three nigiri, super white tuna, yuzu yellowtail and salmon as well as two rolls, the salmon and Alaskan roll. Yuzu and Alaskan roll were my faves

Although the sushi al a carte is more cheap compared to most places, (which is one reason we came here) you get what you pay for here.. Nigiri sushi was tinyyy! Lol salmon was lean, no fatty white lines that give it an almost buttery flavor and texture. Cuts of fish were also thin. Maybe they gave us the less appetizing parts idk. Rolls were just as small, but I appreciate that they didn't try to stuff the sushi with rice to make up for size. 

You're probably better off getting AYCE here but I would honestly go to another place with the better quality fish,  not for what we were served here.

The moment we walked in (no reservations) we were immediately greeted and saw the place packed that we waited less than 5 minutes.  The host apologized for the wait then finally sat us at a booth. 

What I love about this place is how every server is on top of it!  I would forget the water was instantly refilled or how a finished plate disappeared from sight. 

My favorite sushi rolls are the no-rice rolls like 'fresh men' or 'Johnny roll'! It's fresh and refreshing, and makes you feel like you didn't overdo it. A different spin to sushi! 

Boyfriend's review (his two cents): it's live,  it's festive,  it's fun! Most sushi places are quiet and this place is always lively.  The food is great and service is great, bruh! (He insisted I added the word ""bruh"" on his behalf)",4tVcD5mDy63PfbKrnOOJrA,2,2,5,RiKtKe4t6DnJc1jU7eBXTw

All of the sushi looks good on paper but 3 out of 5 of the rolls we ordered tasted and looked exactly the same.

We asked about ordering something else on top of what we had been waiting for and the waitress didn't even listen to us and again stated the same excuse of why we had to wait for the sushi.. We said we knew that and were just trying to put in another order.. When your order finally came, it was thrown on your table. It took an hour for smoked salmon nigiri to come to our table. 

When we got our bill we ended up finding out the waiter had calculated it wrong and instead of just bringing us the wrong calculated bill.. he voided it and charged us twice.

The food here is about 3.5 stars. The AYCE deal is pretty great; tons of special rolls and sushi, appetizers, and desserts to choose from and everything gets made pretty quickly and to your table so you don't run out of time. (You get 1 hour of ordering time for dinner, which really is quite enough if you're ordering a couple to several things at a time). I have had many items here that were delicious, almost every single roll and cut of fish has been excellent. The only roll I didn't like was the Red Rock--it has some sort of sweet-ish sauce that just didn't work for me. Unfortunately, I had to finish it or pay a la carte price for it due to AYCE rules.

It's the service here that really rocks. There are several servers roaming at all times, taking orders from everyone (which makes sense, since they don't have to keep track of prices for each table). That means it never takes more than a few seconds for an empty plate to get picked up, an empty glass to be filled, or an order for more food to be taken. Everyone is super friendly, efficient, and really obviously trying to make sure you have a good experience. That accounts for much of the high rating for me.",EkIIFm2zmqloYWXRHbwwqw,7,2,4,TUzAIy-nkFrzG3SoyByMKA

I had a whole booth and pretty much whole corner of the restaurant to myself. I was then given water and a menu. I opted for AYCE lunch @ $20.95. AYCE includes most apps, rolls and dessert, but all of the items listed in RED are for dinner only.  I chose the following items: 

Gyoza 
Kiss Me roll
Japanese Lasagna roll
Double D roll
Joe's Special Roll

The rolls are broken down on the menu by type. So for example all the spicy rolls are listed together, as well as the baked rolls and shrimp tempura rolls etc. My server recommended to me two rolls;  the kiss me and double d. And I chose the lasagna roll and Joe's special roll myself. Turns out 3/4 rolls I ordered had shrimp tempura in them. 

The gyoza were tasty, they came fresh and hot to the table. There was 2 per order. There was no dipping sauce that accompanied them, but instead the sauce was drizzled over the top. I would order these again. 3/5.

Next came the kiss me roll. Inside it had shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, and on the top was avocado, spicy tuna and screaming orgasm sauce. I really liked this roll and would order again 4/5.

Double D roll had shrimp tempura and cucumber on the inside, and spicy crab, tuna, salmon and orgasm sauce. This roll was similar to the kiss me and I liked it. The orgasm sauce is different than most sauces, it's not very heavy and it's quite tasty. 4/5

Joe's special roll had shrimp tempura and cucumber inside, and tuna, avocado and spicy garlic ponzu sauce on top. I enjoyed this roll the best. The spicy ponzu sauce was a good complement to the fish. 4/5

Japanese lasagna roll is my go to roll whenever I eat sushi. It's a california roll baked with cream cheese and eel sauce on top. It's really yummy but super rich.I chose to eat this last because of the richness, and actually It turned out to be my least favorite too. 3/5

All in all, I would come back here for lunch. My waitress was sweet, the rolls came out quickly and the price can't be beat for AYCE. Also they have karaoke rooms so I think I will bring some friends and we will have sushi and sake and do some singing.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,10,5,3,6VG3t7o8WeJ6-HF1VGNMag

Price here is much cheaper than other sushi. Roll for $3 Baked salmon and avocado. Naruto is the best. The sauce is coconut or cream. Taste pretty good. Miso taste like bleach water. I don't know why. I have tasted many miso but I have never taste anything like so. After coming here tasting bleach miso I decided to try the pumpkin soup. The pumpkin soup taste like American pumpkin soup with no cream or pumpkin spice. Just pumpkin! I thought it will have something Japanese or Korean flare. No sesame. No nori or seaweed. Nothing.

Atmosphere is dimmy and pretty cook. Had a few Iron Chef pictures. Services is pretty good compare to the JJANGA on Fort Apache x Russell. That's a very confusing place.

The tempura on the fried sushi tasted soggy and greasy and the sushi had so much cream cheese in it was just overpowering any fish that was in the roll. Some rolls was soo fishy I couldn't take it.

2130859,2014-12-11,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"WOW what an EPIC meal!  Hubs and I came here for AYCE sushi dinner and had to be rolled out.  Speaking of rolls, my only regret is not being able to try ALL of them.  The rolls all sounded so good and they were so creative with naming them!  Menu items like Burning Your Ass and the Playboy Special..FUN!  We only tried 2 rolls out of maybe 100 varieties because there were only 2 of us and the rolls were about 8 pieces each.  We ordered the Cowboy Special (since there was a cowboy convention this weekend in Vegas) and the Big Easy.  I really really wish I had my AYCE sushi buffet loving family of piggies back home in Toronto with me for this so we'd be able to try EVERYTHING!  

This was definitely the BEST AYCE sushi dinner I've ever had.  Mind you I have no basis of comparison for the other AYCE sushi places in Nevada but I've probably eaten almost all of them back home in the Greater Toronto Area (there are a LOT of them there) and this one is no comparison.  The quality of the fish was excellent for an AYCE and they even had premium items on the menu like Tobiko, Uni, Amaebi, Beef Tataki, and Oysters.  Sure you were limited to 1 order (2 pieces) per person of these premium offerings but kudos for putting them on the menu in the first place.  We ate mostly off the Nigiri and Appetizer sections of the menu because of the small sizes and wanting more variety to try different things.  We also tried all of the special sashimi - all yummy!  I loved that even their simple sushi was not simple.  It wasn't simply a piece of fish slapped on top of rice.  Oh no, the fish was first perfectly seasoned, then placed on the rice (i.e. garlic tuna sushi - soooo good).  Also liked that their 1 serving portions were small so you were able to try different things.  I'm sure it wasn't easy making a dish with only 3 little baby octopuses on it.  They could have piled more on in one serving forcing you to be full on less items making it easier for the chefs.  And each item came out fresh and piping hot too.  

Almost forgot to mention they have ICE CREAM MOCHI in the dinner dessert menu!  I LOVE ice cream mochi!  Drool!  Only downside was only 1 per person :(  We tried the green tea and mango.  Both were excellent.  

Might have to drop in one more time before I leave sin city.  

Ever consider opening up one north of the border?  Please?  :)

Omg how did I finish the review without praising the amazing hospitality from the servers?!?!  A server came by every few minutes to ensure everything was OK, drinks were topped up and see if we wanted more food!  Also everything that we ordered came out exactly as ordered and fast.  This might seem like a weird comment but in AYCE sushi places in Toronto its quite common that you put in an order and it doesn't come out so you order again and all of a sudden you get double your order.  OK, this time I am done :).",niF7QWkPJgfM9AxLqSigyw,2,0,5,UCkGU796jtkjKBn--3kyEA

I dined at 8pm and even though it was a 30 min wait for our table, our server began serving us within ten minutes after we ordered. Our food came out plate by plate, so we had time to indulge in each inividual order. We were never sitting waiting for more food, and our server continually took our order. 

The all you can eat menu offers a lot of variety. The appetizers are unique-- grilled mackerel with dipping sauce; shrimp, pork and beef skewers, fresh oysters, and fried rice. The staples of baked mussels and shrimp tempura are also perfection! The nigiri is fresh, it has a good rice to fish ratio, and you can order pretty much any fish (I like uni, salmon belly and garlic tuna).

The servers are very knowledgeable of their menu. They offer great suggestions on which of their many rolls to order. They serve no rice rolls which are my favorite to prepare my belly for more food! I LOVE the Fresh Men Roll. 

The last thing that makes Jjanga stand out is their poke. Not many AYCE joints serve poke yet this place has four different poke/sashimi dishes! That alone makes it worth the dinner price.

It's not in the nicest part of town but that's not a big deal. On to the sushi...it was GREAT! Everything I tried was amazing with the exception of the yum yum sauce which tasted like straight up mayo egh! The reason I gave 4 stars is because the service was horrible. They would forget to bring items we ordered or they wouldn't come check on us to see if we wanted to order more. That was very frustrating, but luckily they weren't strict on the 45 minute lunch time limit. Overall great sushi with horrible service.",0xEXe8ybAy__7NNVzWqM3w,0,0,4,8ydKzsIbzGRdD6Yk4fk0CA

First off, customer service is a huge deal to me (isn't it to everyone?) I called to make a reservation 3 days before the actual dinner, and the hostess put me down no problem, asked if I have ever been there and if I knew how to get there, I said thank goodness for Mapquest and we were excited to try it out!

I made the group reservation for 9, and we were seated immediately, given menus, and asked for our drink order. Sake bomb time! Beer was served in a fancier cup, and the sake in the typical shot glass. 

Time to order! Unfortunately the bill was only allowed to be split four ways, (not sure why that's a rule of theres) Only complaint.
but the menu was extensive, there was SO much to choose from! I went strictly Nigiri, Salmon, Tuna and Shrimp....I ended up eating 38 pieces all together and it was delicious, fresh, and quick. The pieces are a little smaller which is a given being its AYCE, the rolls I did get to taste were just as amazing. One of the rules is you cannot share with someone who is doing Ala Carte, but we didn't mind.

My friend and I both got two rolls to ourselves (playboy special, kiss me roll, double d, and the Washington roll) one to split (tuna naruto) two special things the chefs made us, an order of the baby octopus, and two orders of mango mochi. 
Everything was delish. I left very full, but not gross full of like some other sushi places leave you feeling. They don't overload and swim their stuff in sauce and overload with rice, it's all just perfection.

There was also a very amusing manager or owner walking around yelling funny comments throughout the night. He definitely livened up the atmosphere. Their decor was nice too. They have these giant banners of pictures of the sushi chefs behind the bar. They're hilarious! Oh! And they also had a female sushi chef. I don't think I've ever seen one before so that was interesting. 

The sushi itself was really good. I think this is one of my new favorite spots for AYCE sushi. Amazing rice to fish proportion! Each piece of nigiri had a very small ball of loosely packed rice. I loved it!  Their special rolls were alright. I don't remember being super impressed on any of them. The appetizers were decent as well. They ran out of oyster so we couldn't try any :( 

I'm definitely coming here again. Huge fan of their nigiri! The only reason why I didn't give the full 5 stars is because we had a pretty large group of people... 2 tables... And each time they brought out a big order, they'd put it all on one plate. Most places would separate the servings into two plates so that it's easier to share amongst ourselves. We ended up taking the plates and passing it down all throughout the night. Not a big deal.. Just an inconvenience. Oh, and another thing... They completely missed our entire second round of orders.

Salmon Skin Handroll and Something Wrong #69 Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA 
Ever since Blue Fin Sushi turned me into a Salmon Skin Handrolls junkie I gotta have it every time I do AYCE sushi, if it's offered. It wasn't that bad; it was missing the crunchiness, but did the spot. The Something Wrong #69 was probably one of my favorite rolls. It's a shrimp tempura roll, which I usually a fan of, topped with spicy soft shell crab, tuna, salmon, white fish, and a spicy garlic ponzu. I devoured everything in that picture on my own. Sorry for not that great of a pic but the real stuff looked and tasted delicious.

Oysters - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#2sMNzctANegqVqvPkGG0lQ 
It was one of the items you could only order one of.  Honestly I love oysters but because I was only limited to 2 I don't think I had enough to like it too much. I inhaled them and don't remember the flavors.

Who's Your Ex-wife and Shrimp Tempura -  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#wyCtws-hZWHCkw_c3C1EUw 
Now the Who's Your Ex-wife is my kind of eats. I don't remember what exactly it was but I think it was a stuffed fried jalapeno with fish. I kind of wished I went back for seconds so I could've remember more but I liked it a lot cause it was spicy and delicious. The Shrimp Tempura was not bad just know that 1 order is just 2 pieces not your usual handful else where.

Spicy Garlic Edamame - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#cwzi6JqmNpr2L7IMg3KDlw
No one usually make um like this but I enjoyed them, though I didn't fill myself up on them because I was eating sushi. I'd order um.

Now for the other items:

Screaming O Sashimi - Why not!? I'm always a fan of the sauce as long as it's not too sweet. It was made right to my liking.

Nigiri - Not a great selection but I liked the garlic tuna, hamachi, cajun albacore, and sweet shrimp. Didn't care for the tamago or uni. A lot of the pieces were smaller than I'm use to but it's AYCE so ordering more is fine.

Apps - I liked the Golden Scallops and whatever I already mentioned. I ordered and really wanted the baked green mussels, agedashi tofu, and calamari rings but never got them.

Rolls - Well there's too many I liked so I'll say that there's an awesome selection of spicy, baked, deep fried, and shrimp tempura rolls. Should there ever be anything else!? Some honorable mentions Burning Your Ass roll, Fat Ass roll, Taste Like My X Girlfriend roll, Stacy Mom roll, Sexy Time roll, never mind I just started being immature.   For those try to cut back on rice there are a few no rice rolls.

The customer service was very friendly and brought food out in quickly but struggled keeping track of everyone's order. Jjanga is funny and loud great for kids. Anyways I'm still a fan for mostly everything so I'll be back.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,19,18,4,HIfrRsqpQnU7aY2oJOYGaw

I did the  AYCE and it was a lot of food. I definitely got my money worth. However since I was there for lunch, I think my experience suffered. 

When I was dining the first sushi cooks didn't seem like the cared. After a few items, the cooks changed and so did my experience. I'll say that after the cooks changed, you'll see an uptick in my dining review. 

Amaebi: Beautiful but very bitter
Uni: Very cold and fishy tasting. Could have probably been frozen before and definitely has been out for a day or two. 
Beef Skewer: overcooked and not flavorful
Oyster: delicious. I would eat 5 more if I could but they only allow one. 
Garlic Tuna: pretty good. 
Raw Beef: cut too thick. It felt chewy but not because of the quality. 
Yuzu Albacore: Perfect. I'd eat this all day. Allow the Yuzu to cook your albacore for like a minute or two. Then dig in. Acidic, firm outer flesh but very tender with the plump rice. Seriously great. 
Salmon Nigiri: fresh and tender. Nothing special but it was a good couple bites. 
Mackerel Grilled: the ponzu sauce wasn't good to me and I think if it was just seasoned more with salt, it would be delicious. 

Overall, I'd want to eat here again if i was in town. But I'll be pigging out on nigiri the whole time.",INBz36eUgvMUMPltfX_iDA,0,0,4,rjL1q7SHUhBM5JBBIxUM7w

On the AYCE, everything's categorized so that's great too. Just wish that the appetizer portions were bigger (i.e. that Agedashi tofu is delicious but I gotta order like 3 at a time for myself).

Other favorites include fresh oysters, yuzu yellowtail, dynamite, & fat sweet shrimp. I pigged out mostly on nigiri and the appetizers. I was full so I didn't get to the sashimi and poke section. I rarely do rolls so I can't comment on that.

Service was very attentive. I think we ordered too much in the beginning because the waiter stopped us and said why don't you start with that? Haha. It wasn't even that much! We had another guy helping us toward the end who was a lot friendlier.

Our food kept on coming and our waters were constantly refilled. I was constantly eating. No breaks! The minor thing that was missing from my usual AYCE sushi favorites - I didn't see white tuna on their menu. Maybe they had it but I didn't ask for it. I was full at that point so it wasn't a priority. The monkey burrito was not memorable. I didn't care for their beef tataki. Their dessert is not much of a selection but I'm not one to come to an AYCE sushi joint for dessert so no big deal. Just mochi and ice cream.

2422066,2014-12-17,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Thanks fellow Yelpers for seeking this place out (it's located in a strip mall that we usually avoid).

This review is for the A La Carte menu and not the ""All You Can Eat"" option. We were apprehensive about the restrictions of the AYCE. Number 2 on the Restriction List states: ""You will be charged A La Carte prices for Leftovers, including sushi rice"". We decided not to go down that road. Plus when we do the math the A La Carte is always a better deal for the amount we are able to eat. 

If I was to compare the sushi here to another in LV, I would say the quality is at the same level as other Korean/American sushi bars like Kabuki or Sushi Samba. The interior is cute and comfortable. The Classic Cut Sushi menu options were all tasty. The Monkey Burritos was made out of Soy sushi wrappers (same stuff I buy at Whole Foods).

Pro: Crab balls, Baked Salmon Roll, fried rice, Gyoza, Cali Roll, ginkgo garlic

Cons: Bulgogi was awful ( too many onions and too much stringy fat). I had to spit out almost every bite. Kind of ironic, a Korean run sushi bar where they can't make a decent Bulgogi (one of the only Korean dishes). Sometimes the Mayo sauce they put on the baked Salmon roll is too sweet. Lastly, I hate the smell of Lysol or PineSol they use when cleaning the tables. I wish they wouldn't spray that stuff while I'm eating. The smell on chemicals ruins the dining experience. 

The guys who work here are all so very nice so that's what keeps us coming back. It's comfortable here.",4IZxXA8XxeUXEjNf6yZamw,4,3,4,2QtEgh7Ykj9-k7umgHCtNw

As I am from out of the area and didn't have any idea of places to eat, my friend recommended that we go there. The experience was definitely solid. No complaints there. The biggest surprise was the items on the menu and what they were priced at. Generally speaking, sushi rolls were $8. There was also an All You Can Eat Option for $21 (lunch) and $27 (dinner). I opted to not go this route as I wasn't super hungry, and ordered items a la carte.

The sushi seemed perfectly fine. The first thing I said when I first looked at the menu was that there had to be something wrong with the food or the price. I've never seen fancy sushi rolls for $8.

Anyways, it is a few hours later, and none of us have gotten sick. I would tell you to give this place a try!

We were staying at Mandalay bay and wanted sushi but not looking at spending a lot of money.  We rented a car and I was a little nervous we would not use it but wow I was wrong.  We've used it everyday to find awesome restaurants like this one.  I was craving sushi but did not want to spend over $100 and I knew if we stayed on the strip we would.  So I found this place on yelp, I was skeptical because it was all you can eat,  it's way off the strip, in a strip mall and it appears to be in shady area of town (I'm from Chicago, what do I know).  But let me tell you this place was a lot fun!  The food, the environment, everything was great.  First, the environment was very welcoming.  My wife and I sat at the sushi bar and Choo Choo (sushi chef) was awesome! He was a ball of energy, entertaining, funny, he made the experience great!  Now the food was surprisingly super good.  The fish was super fresh, soft, the tuna melted in my mouth.  I was super impressed how fresh the fish was.  I have many food allergies and they were very accompanying, made changes to the rolls for me and gave me suggestions.  The wait service was just okay, hard to track down for the bill but the sushi chefs made up for them with there energy, enthusiasm and entertaining factor.  Lastly the price, cheapest meal of the trip, so crazy!  We opted out of the all you can eat and just ordered.  Our bill was only $38 after taxes and we had sake.  If I'm ever back in Las Vegas I will absolutely eat there and I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know.  If your looking to have fun, eat great food, and not pay a lot, then I highly suggest.

The quality of the fish was really good and this is being compared to an sushi I have had in Hawaii and California. I came here with group of 7, all of us AYCE, and Gia our server was very attentive, to our table and provided phenomenal customer service! She is one of the best servers I have ever had! It was real honor to have her as our server.

Unfortunately, the reason for the 3-stars is because the customer service in the last half of my group's time here was terrible. From my understanding Gia went on break, and Victoria was covering for her. With Victoria I had requested more ginger near the beginning of our time here, I never received it. We had also put in 3rd order for some muscles with Victoria, and unfortunately we waited close to 30-45 minutes to hear anything about them, when our previous first 2 orders came fast.. When we brought it up to her, we just asked her to cancel those muscles. She was polite to let us know she'll check up on those muscles, and if they were started then she'll bring them out, but if the chefs didn't start them then she would tell not to make them. I am not trying to pin everything Victoria, there was a clear misunderstanding going around. I am assuming Gia was the manager based on how smoothly things went when she was on the restaurant floor. When she left, things did not go as smoothly.

We came here on a Wednesday night, restaurant was nearly empty. If the customer service was consistently as smooth as it was when Gia was helping my group, I would have given this place 5 stars.",mXjPVbjZ1vVvIBtt1ON2YQ,0,0,3,bmZQBbBmCSyfTjFGirAGSw

Hello, every other restaurant is able to do this. You're not the type of restaurant to be able to pull this.

To his benefit, he eventually did provide a time frame, and they did come in well under.

We came on around the beginning of their dinner time (4pm). We were the only two customers for a while so we were seated right away and served our drinks. The front hostess is a little awkward. I felt like she was talking too slow and lingered around our table even after I said we needed more time to look over the menu. 

We automatically connected with this petite blonde server who served us the rest of the time we were there. She was pleasant and even made little conversation with us. She constantly checked on us  and even recommended some things for us to try. She kept forgetting our some of our orders though. I'm not sure if it's her or whoever is making them in the back that kept making the mistake. That's mainly the reason for the one star deduction. 

I would personally recommend their no rice rolls so you can save some room for other things. Rice can be overwhelming when eating AYCE so my best tip is to avoid them unless you're eating it with the Nigiri, which we got a lot of. The fishes were fresh and delicious. Ordered the salmon, yellowtail, Cajun albacore, garlic tuna Nigiri. My friend ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and a side of spicy mayo sauce and basically ate multiple of those all night. 

Overall good service. The chefs could be a little faster with our orders though considering there was no one else there. 

Also, they were fixing their lights during business hours. The lights kept going on and off which bothered me.

What really caught us off guard was the sushi chefs and how welcoming and adaptable they were to each patron. Now we are people who like to have fun and make people laugh and it was very warming to see the chefs react to us so well and not be stiff. The servers are always attentive and quick. Super sweet staff and they seem to coordinate well! Now the food is one of the reasons why we refuse to go to any other place. My fiancé loves all their rolls that have to do with cream cheese, especially their Baked Lobster Roll and their Popcorn Lobster Roll. I'm a sucker for their Cowboy Roll, which I usually start off with because the flavor is so intense so its a good starter roll rather than finisher. Then I usually follow with a Tuna Naruto because I love the mild sweetness of the crab paired with the cool cucumber wrapping, super refreshing! My favorite meal finisher would be the green tea mochi, I can't get enough of that little ball of cold deliciousness. My favorite appetizer would have to be the Udon Noodles and Miso Soup, always hot and fresh. The Udon Noodles have such a tantalizing flavor that always leaves me wanting more, they are so awesome. The Miso Soup feels like its preparing my stomach for the awesome rolls to come, it really puts me into a good mood haha.

Get the heck out of here with all of that rice you try to stuff wherever you can. 

I can no longer recommend Jjanga as a solid spot for AYCE sushi. Their quality and credibility has gone down. Waaay down. They used to be decent but, man, I was utterly disgusted on our recent visit. 

- Their AYCE (all rice) nigiri are soaked in an offensive chemical tasting ""yuzu"" flavor
- Their (rice) rolls are literally all rice and a dot of imitation crab with a paper thin sliver of dried out salmon
- Watery-bland-miso-soup
- Sinewy, dried out, paper thin fish
- Skimpier than a mofo ""special sashimi"" poke salads, that all have questionable, stringy, bad cuts of fish
- Oh, they also don't do half sized rolls so be prepared to Tetris the shit out of your food

No can do. This is not the spot for AYCE sushi or value. They are drastically inconsistent, which is why I am confidant in awarding them with a 1 star review and never plan on returning.

Pro tip: Try Sakana on Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas - they don't skimp on their rolls or their nigiri (plus their yuzu actually tastes good)",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,18,6,1,iyJH2lZdf__Tzb0QA0SyfQ

This grown up joint definitely caters to the little one's needs, complete with a panda face bento box and st. Patrick's day green utensils.  The service is also very accommodating and friendly.

The food was great, but we did experience a discrepancy between sushi orders.  Some were cut beautifully and some were kinda butchered (I didn't take photos of our salmon nigiri and the follow up orders because they looked bad).  There were 2 sushi chefs at the counter that day and I'm not sure if the bad ones all came from 1 guy, but I do hope when you eat here you don't experience this.  We were bummed that super white tuna sushi isn't available on a regular basis but their fish cuts were substantial in ratio to the rice and quite fresh.  The rolls are large and you cannot order half rolls, but the rice doesn't drown out the other ingredients.  Their bbq chiken appetizer was very tender and tasty and the other item that we thoroughly enjoyed was the Freshmen no rice roll.  It had tuna, salmon, avocado and crab wrapped in rice paper and drizzled with a ginger sauce.  It was very light and refreshing!  Even my husband really loved this!  This is something I haven't seen anywhere yet and it was lovely.  

It is a tall order to be pitched against Goyemon, Sushi Koma, Blue Fin and the many AYCE sushi options in vegas and I'm not quite sure if their nigiri necessarily equals in quality, but the vibe of the place, the friendly service and the inventiveness of their menu definitely warrants a visit.

The plates came out one at a time every 15 to 20 minutes. Omg! They must be manipulating the reviews Yelpers! My wife and I are sushi snobs and we figured we would check it out because of the reviews on yelp, boy were we disappointed! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

For $25.95, it's totally worth it. After trying a bunch of items, I'd have to say that their nigiri is better than their rolls. The unagi was the highlight of the meal for me. With its crispy charred edges giving way to a mildly sweet tender and meaty body, this fresh water eel was the best I've had at any AYCE spot. Other solid options were the tuna, halibut, yellowtail and red snapper. On the flip side, I wasn't crazy about the beef tataki nigiri because it was too rare and fatty than I would have liked.

My favorite roll was the tuna naruto (tuna, salmon, white fish, and crab wrapped in cucumber). I also tried the Hawaiian roll and Joe's special roll but both had too much sauce, either masking the taste of the fish or rendering the rice mushy and causing the roll to fall apart.

Other items tried were the gyoza and chicken katsu. Both were satisfying.

Food came out unusually fast, so I'll have to request them to pace it out more next time. Service was exceptional as they stopped by often to take additional orders, refilled water glasses, and inquired about our food.

The ambiance at JJANGA is probably the best I've seen with the sushi joints I've been to. The wooden walls and cute couches were a nice touch. The decor made me feel like I wasn't in Vegas anymore. 

Before I get into the food. I highly highly highly recommend everyone get the grapefruit sake ($10 for the large). It is the best thing I've ever had in my life! Our server, Scott (might've been the manager), recommended it. He even took a shot with us. After I told him we were there for my birthday, he brought out another large grapefruit sake.. On the house! Thank You Scott!! 

The items that really made me want to try this place were the ""riceless"" rolls and the burritos. Started with the Johnny Riceless roll! Oh my goodness it was so delicious. Then the Monkey burrito came out and I almost died and went to sushi heaven. Besides the Grapefruit Sake, that's another ""you must try"".

Everything else was really good. I honestly can't go through all the different rolls we ordered. There were to many. & to be quite honest it was all a blur, once the food came out I didn't think about anything but how I'm  going to fit everything in my belly. What is pictured isn't even half of what we had ordered. 

This place is very kid friendly. They even have a ""treasure chest"" in the front for the little kids to choose a toy. Probably was put there to shut the crying kids up so the adults can eat. ¯\_(?)_/¯

Went here for AYCE and tried their yummy beef steak side dish and the grilled pike mackerel. I don't usually bother with a lot of side dishes when getting AYCE sushi but I couldn't resist and they were worth it. On the other hand, the nigiri sushi could've had better fish to rice ratio. I thought the fish seemed pretty tasty after you get past all the rice but I had serious doubts about the uni quality. The uni I'm used to is golden and sweet. The uni I had at JJANGA was kinda gray and on the bitter side.

They weren't really disappointed but we all were drinking and enjoying each other company so the food really wasn't a focus. They were on a budget so the happy hour AYCE for $20 was a saving grace :-) only 2 out of the 6 people did AYCE. The ones that didn't did get a kick out of the low price of the rolls, but with those low prices corners will be cut. 

The sushi was little rice and paper thin cut fish. I wasn't hungry so I just had a Joe's Special roll which sounded better than it actually was. The garlic sauce tasted like burnt garlic. The tuna was low quality and very thin. I also had a Philadelphia roll, not sure why I ordered it but I did. There is a reason the cost was $3, don't expect much more than a couple grains of rice and a sliver of salmon, with a nice chunk of cream cheese :-/ yuck! My two rolls plus tax and gratuity came out to $14. I'm not breaking the bank at all with that meal but I can still think of others places I rather eat for that amount. 

The services was hit and miss, the new guy was very nice and helpful. He had zero clue what was going on but he ran to find out. I like that :-) I don't expect people to have all the answers but I do expect them to make a effort to find out. The seasoned pro that came to answer of question was lacking in the personality department. My cousin was placing her order with him and asked to keep out cucumber from her roll. He snapped back with a, well then you want a ""blah blah roll then!"" Sir, I don't know your damn menu! Don't snap at a customer and make us feel like we need to be better versed with your menu! At least the newbie dude chipper go get 'em personality won us all over.  

I'm tempted to put this place at a 2 star but the prices reflect the quality so I'm keeping the 3 stars. I'm cool with never returning to this place.

2973024,2014-09-10,1,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Simply put, best AYCE sushi in Vegas.

This place is so good, I'm not too sure where to start this review, but this is yelp, and it's always about the food itself.

Food here is just awesome. The fish is so fresh tasting, I would argue that it comes fairly close in quality to Noshi Sushi in Hollywood. Unlike Yama which precuts their fish (a decision I completely understand due to how busy they get), all the fish at Jjanga is sliced only when you order it. The fish to rice ratio in both their hand and cut rolls is spot on. They don't pile on the rice to fill you up faster, and the chefs are extremely generous with their portions. My favorite sushi here are the Yellowtail and Alaska hand rolls, which are just heavenly. The fish is so smooth, without any of the fishy smell and taste so common with cheaper sushi. Another amazing plus are their appetizers. I know it sounds strange, but try their plain chicken wings and the french fries. Hell, I'd come back just for those two. For their desserts, the red bean icecream is so fragrant and full of red beans, you'll with that you saved room for more than 1 cup. My only dislikes of the food would be some of the sauces they put on the sushi, but everything can be ordered without sauce. Additionally, their salads (Poke, shashimi, etc) are a bit weak when compared to their sushi lineup. If they made their salad like how Yama makes its shashimi salad, I would rate them 6 stars. As it stands, I would rate the food 5/5.

Service is also great. You aren't required to order with the same waiter who took your first one, if you want more food, just flag down any passing waiter. They don't mind the least and actually encourage it. Food is brought out at a constant pace instead of a giant glut common at other AYCE places, which helps keep the food at its correct temperatures. The servers are so friendly and I've never gotten the smallest hint of judgement for the sheer armount of food I consume. My only qualm is that once in a long while a small mixup will happen and an order might be forgotten, but since it's an AYCE, just order it again. Who cares if they forget? 5/5

Price/Ambiance/Cleanliness - Price is inline will most other places, ~21 for lunch, ~26 for dinner. Ambiance is casual but not too loud. Restrooms and entire restaurant kept pretty clean. No complaints in this one. 5/5

TLDR: Everything here is great, but also try the plain (must specify this) chicken wings and french fries. You'll thank me later.",qLVFRRpqKoPwmqWSdUVImg,0,0,5,Bu0qhLZe2WsQLwlzHKRNAA

AYCE rules: 
- $20.95 for lunch (45 min only)
- $25.95 for dinner (no time limit)
- Extra charge on unfinished items. No sharing between AYCE and a la carte people of course.

3014175,2014-02-16,2,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"In an unseeming corner of an old business complex next to a small grocery store sits a new restaurant with a fresh facade--Jjanga Japanese Restaurant.  I came across their Yelp listing under New Businesses and decided to take my husband there for some lunch.  From the moment we walked in to the place, the service was positive, efficient, and ever-present.  I was surprised to find that this restaurant has a sushi bar, the main cuisine for their all-you-can-eat (AYCE) menu.  There are hundreds of AYCE sushi bars in Vegas, but this one is run by a very loved sushi chef from another very popular sushi bar, and his name is Jjanga.  Obviously, he owns the place, thus the self-titled restaurant.  He comes packed with three other sushi chefs at the helm: Koo Koo, Choo Choo, and Hickey.  You will remember their names because their Iron Chef photos with names on them sit high and mighty behind the sushi counter.  I fell in love with the place before trying the food just for that Iron Chef whimsy.  The other thing that caught my attention were the place settings at the bar.

Choo was our first sushi chef experience at Jjanga and is and forever will be dubbed the ""sushi hero"", because he rescued my negative ideas of certain pieces of fish and their delivery from the bowels of my personal food hell pit and resurrected them into favorites and desires.  To get to this point with Choo, we started off with a few familiar options for AYCE--saba and red snapper.I will be honest--from all my other sushi bar experiences in Vegas, I detest the sight and smell of saba.  I really, truly do.  When my husband orders it, I shove the plate his way to avoid that strong odor of saba in my nostrils.  This, however, was different.  I was puzzled by this plate; there was no fishy smell (despite it being fish), nor was there a dull gray tint to the saba.

It is clean, well cut, and topped with this crazy ginger cream sauce that is to die for.  I decided to check out this enigma for myself, closed my eyes, took one by the chopsticks and popped it in my mouth.  I chewed, waiting for that tangy taste to hit my palate, but lo!--no such thing occurred.  A nice, cured flavor of saba hit my taste buds with a hint of the sauce and well balanced sushi rice.  I actually fell in love with saba at that moment, ordering another round.  The snapper was clean tasting, just the right cut and was perfect without wasabi, soy sauce, or ginger.  I was excited to move on, and decided to tell Choo just to take the wheel.  We switched on omakase ((???, o-makase meaning ""I leave it to you"").

Choo made his first creation--a beautifully wrapped roll that was rice-free, included salmon and tuna, avocado, radish, and topped with two sauces that, when intermingled on the tongue, just exploded with a bit of spice, sweetness, and citrus.  This experience was the most unique out of all the other sushi places we fare for one reason--the flavors are clean, the fish is beautifully cut and great quality, and those sauces are uber-umami powerhouses.  I was excited to see what would arrive next.

Unagi, or eel is what my husband ordered.  Another nigiri that I truly detest, one that has plagued my palate with nothing but oily fish residue and the smell of fish death topped with what I assumed was metallic, salty eel sauce.  Disgusting, right?  I was dead wrong.  Taking a chance based on my saba experience, I went mouth-first with the unagi, and I was completely shocked.  First, the eel sauce isn't really eel sauce in terms of flavors we are used to at other sushi restaurants.  It isn't gritty, metallic, soy gel.  This stuff is complex, umami, and gentle with whatever it compliments.  As I took one, the first thing that made it pleasurable was the unagi's temperature--warm.  It is reminiscent, to me, of foie gras, and in the best way possible.  The fat is delicious, the meat flakes and melts in the mouth, and with the eel sauce it's a double hitter of flavor, from a symphony of sweet to a hint of salty, and dissipating with that beautiful fatty flavor that eel should always provide.  I ordered six more of these babies in one sitting.

At Jjanga, they are doing things right by curing their saba in house, cooking the tako until tender, making their sauces, and getting their sushi rice to the right flavor.  By presenting each piece of sushi at different temperatures to enhance the experience, the fish tasted the way it should; I truly admire and appreciate that.

All whimsy aside, Jjango is fun and fresh, just like their offerings of sashimi, nigiri, and rolls.  It's about creating the right experience, presenting the fish in a way that creates a sumptuous moment. I sum it all up in three words: engrossing, thoughtful, and balanced.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,4,4,5,JPhBz_fPh2qnLOaN58iZvQ

Having been a chef at a sushi bar I can guarantee you NONE of the fish was fresh. In fact not a single piece of food I ate was fresh. Everything from the crab mix to the baked mussels reeked of fishiness. Even the Mochi ice cream was so old, the soft outer shell had become hard and disintegrated into a rough powder in my mouth. They recently fired most of the chefs/staff and you can definitely tell. The service was slow but it's really not the servers fault because the new chefs don't have proper training or ingredients. I'm honestly not one to write bad reviews but I feel their food is a legitimate safety concern, I myself had stomach pain the entire day after.

The cucumber salad was cut sloppily and did not taste fresh. We decided to pass on the rest of the food.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,1,1,1,Akt8zSZyIM3EmIieVXuCiQ

The food is good. I found the sushi to be warmer than I would prefer. I don't think they cool down the rice enough.  Their spicy tuna mix was pasty.  I don't think it's freshly chopped per order.  Nigiri fish to rice ratio was really good.  Big pieces of fresh fish.

The first time with my cousin was kinda ""eh"" in terms of the customer service. I felt that they were kinda trying to get us out of there (even though we stopped ordering food and were just talking because we were catching up). I also found it funny that they would not add jalapeño slices to one of the rolls we had ordered because it was ""too busy, and they only add it if you are buying a la carte"". To be honest, I really don't understand the point of that because regardless of how busy other locations are, they'll do whatever you want to the sushi (at least to the places I have been). Regardless, the sushi was awesome so I decided to come back a second time with my girlfriend.

The second time I came here, we sat at the bar, and it was completely different than the first visit. I felt that the waiters and waitresses were more attentive, and things came out faster. It was just as busy as the original time I went...maybe it was an off night for them the first time around. 

Overall, both times, the sushi was great. The fish tasted super fresh, and the quality was on point. I highly recommend the ""freshmen roll"" and the ""monkey burrito"" among other things that I forget the names of.

3332501,2016-07-11,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"I don't usually go to AYCE sushi restaurants because of the stigma of low quality.  I always get the feeling that quality is diminished when the restaurant is just churning out sushi for all of their hungry customers.  So I came to JJanga wanting to try the food, but not for the AYCE deal.  

I ended up ordering a la carte, which actually offers some solid prices at $3 for appetizers (small portions but wide variety and tasty), $3 normal sushi (california, tuna, etc.), $5 rolls/burritos, and then $8 for specialties.  AYCE was $25 so considering I stuck with a few minor rolls and appetizers it wouldn't have made sense anyways.  I got the mushroom ball and agedashi tofu appetizers to begin, and then the spicy tuna roll, yummy vegetarian roll, and Jjanga burrito.  The appetizers were of high quality but for $3 were very small.  The spicy tuna came with 8 pieces, so although it wasn't the best roll I've ever eaten, and not the cleanest prepared, the price was too cheap to say anything negative.  It was solid. The vegetarian Yummy roll was very good.  Tempura and a nice spicy sauce for a good kick.  The burrito was an interesting concept but nothing to shout about.

I do have some comments about the restaurant.  To start, wasabi was a $1 extra charge.  This is a sushi restaurant so that was very weird, although they brought out like a full ice cream scoop when ordered so that makes up for the surcharge.  They also have no liquor license, yet advertise sake and beer both in their menu and on their wall in the restaurant.  Next, the waitstaff had no idea what they were doing and we had 3 different waiters take our order so we never really had that server experience or have a personalized waiter to request stuff from.  And finally they messed up our receipt.  The price was the same as what we ordered so we didn't bother complaining, but they replaced two different sushi items on the receipt that we did not order.  So either they ned to update their cashier system or take better order noted to cite the price correctly.  

I'm not a fan of AYCE, as I said, so I probably won't be back.  But they have a huge variety of sushi (albeit most consist of the same crab, tuna, avocado, etc. ingredients) so if AYCE is your thing, then $25 isn't horrible and the quality is fine for the experience.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,TEL6Cq5kxQkLaiD-iB3Sog

What made this excellent sushi were a few unique ""dishes"": the screaming orgasm (appetizer of seared tuna on a bed of radish), the spring mountain roll, and the monkey burrito (we ordered a 2nd). 

The first few rolls were delivered within 5 minutes after we ordered and the rest not all at once but in a nice progression. Freshness, great taste, and spicy sauces.

THE MOOD:
Jjanga is located a little further down from Chinatown in a small plaza.  It seems like the only happening place in this plaza is Jjanga - all the other stores are in dire need of customers.  Imagine the $$ they could be making if they were located right in Chinatown!  The decor inside looks modern/Asian.  There is a bar where you can sit with the enthusiastic sushi chefs.  Patrons who come and sit at the bar are warmly greeted by the chefs.  If you opt for sitting in the dining area, you will have plenty of space between your table and the one next to you.

THE FOOD:
Andrew D. and I decided to go for the dinner AYCE for the $25.95 per person.  I especially loved the appetizer dishes since each one that was brought out was unique and each was packed with flavor!

What we ordered:
- Garlic Tuna (Delicious and packed with strong garlic flavor! I loved!)
- Salmon Egg 
- Sea Urchin (This was melt in your mouth goodness)
- Sweet Shrimp (Big pieces of tasty succulent shrimp)
- Seaweed salad (I'm a lover of seaweed salad and this was so delicious I had to order 2)
- Baby Octopus (They come in 3 and are crispy, tasty!)
- Golden scallop (These also came in 3.  These are marked off on the menu in red to show that you are only allowed 1 order of these per person - and for good reason! They were delicious!)
- Mini Beef Steak (These came in 4 pieces - the beef was super tender and dripping with lovely juices)
- Jjanga Burrito (This is not really a burrito, but rather a handroll - the tempura was a nice crunchy complement to the rice, crab, and shrimp)
- Salmon Skin Roll
- Washington Roll
- Jjanga Special Roll (This was a surprisingly refreshing dish.  I loved the crisp of the chopped tomato with the special chef sauce - they were so fun to eat and this is perfect for the hot weather!)
- Spider Roll (The soft shell crab was absolutely delicious - the roll was made to perfection!)
- Q Roll (Jjanga have sushi rolls without rice - good for those who are counting those carbs/calories - very refreshing!)
- Green Tea Ice Cream (I want to say that this is probably the best green tea ice cream I've tasted! I loved how each bite was delicious, milky, green tea goodness).
- Strawberry Ice Cream (You are only allowed to order 1 per customer and it was delicious! Get at least one to try!)

THE 'TUDE:
If you thought the list above was a lot of food, you are right!! lol.  Andrew D. and I eat like champs and we love good sushi!  The waiters did not miss a beat in stopping by our table to refill our drinks and pick up our empty plates as we efficiently chomped through each dish.  Our waitress also kept checking in on us to see if we wanted to order more or needed anything else.

Food:

Jjanga burrito - boring. So boring. Didn't finish.

Smoked salmon nigiri - smoked salmon on sushi rice. Nothing more.

Beef nigiri - bland.
Screaming orgasm - yummy, laughable portion.
Half rolls - non-existent.

Everything seemed fresh. I wasn't sick the next day or anything. Overall the food was okay. Not bad, not good.


Drinks:

$12 for a little bit of cheap house sake. The staff didn't even want to tell us what brand it was.

We were charged for our hot green tea even though it was Brown. It tasted very watered down like they have been using the same ol' tea leaves all day. The tea came in very small cups and needed to be refilled often. The staff would sometimes show that they were annoyed to do so.

Service:

We weren't greeted when we came in. No one acknowledged or existence when we left. The whole time we just felt unwanted. They just started at us simultaneously avoiding us. The busser was pretty good though. He was nice and attentive.

It's enjoyable to watch the rolls being prepared. We had a few sake bombs and our friends tried the grapefruit sake, it was amazing! 

I became obsessed with a few of the riceless rolls. They were rolled in cucumber, which made them so light and fresh. The next time we come here I honestly will stick to those. The Johnny Roll was my absolute favorite. Shrimp tempura and crab wrapped in cucumber then topped with a light fruit sauce... I'll take 5! The Q Roll and the Vegas Roll were great as well!

Over six months ago a friend and I tried this new sushi place called JJANGA Japanese Restaurant.  Everything we tried was good but I honestly couldn't remember what we ordered.  All I know is that we ordered so much food that we couldn't finish.  Just a few days ago, we returned with a few other people.  I never thought that I'd ever return here because I have this thing with places not doing half order sushi rolls.  I like doing half orders so that I can taste a variety of rolls.  This place served chicken wings and so a member of our group who loves chicken wings, well, we ended up here again.  

My friend ordered the Jjanga Burrito for the first time and she told me that I should try it because it was really good.  So I decided to give it a try.  The moment I took a bite I said, ""Oh my god this is good.""  Then after every few bites I'm saying how amazing and how amazing balls it was and how I was going to order another one.  So inside of this roll, there is shrimp, broccoli tempura, crab, masago, green onion, furikake, and layu all wrapped in soy paper.  I think layu is some kind of chili oil.  

It's so hard to describe the taste, and all I can say that it's AMAZING.  The rice inside of it is almost like fried rice, but not fried rice (may not make sense but you just have to try it).  The broccoli tempura gives it a crunch with every bite and the flavor with everything else mixed with it is just BOMB!  By far my favorite on the menu.",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,2,2,4,S6-roYVLNGtP38esVxWfmg

Felt like AYCE sushi and decided to check out a new place. I had Jjanga bookmarked so I decided to check it out. It's located in a small strip mall.

The interior is quite nice, much nicer that the exterior. Service was attentive, and I opted to sit at the sushi bar since I was dining alone. Servers came by regularly to refill my water and ask if I wanted to place any kitchen orders (i.e. appetizers, desserts). Sushi orders I placed directly with the sushi chefs sitting behind the bar.

I ended up eating quite a bit of food, definitely got my money's worth. I am pretty sure that I ordered over $60 worth of food for the AYCE dinner price of $25.99.

The quality of the food was okay for AYCE. The uni was mediocre, and the agedashi tofu not impressive (a bit cold, not that crispy). Some of the nigiri weren't the freshest either. I noticed that a lot of the fish was pre-cut, which makes for faster assembly, but not up to higher standards. The sushi chef also forgot one of my orders, though he apologized profusely when I reminded him and made it immediately.

The menu was large, but the variety just so-so (a lot of the rolls were similar). 

Like many other Japanese restaurants across the country, this is a Korean-owned establishment, and the servers and sushi chefs were all speaking Korean to each other. This is not a problem for me, but just don't expect super authentic Japanese fare.

Overall, I had a pleasant meal, though I have had better experiences at other AYCE sushi places in town.

P.S. The menu says there is a 45-minute time limit for placing order for lunch AYCE, and 60-minute time limit for ordering dinner AYCE, but no time limit for overall dining time.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,1,4,mcGN2burTZnn_jHvbb0YCA

My family loves coming here for the riceless rolls (fresh men and Chinatown are our favorites) as well as the chicken wings.  Ending the meal with a little scoop of green tea ice cream never hurt anyone!  

But in terms of quality of fish and freshness, this is great.  Some rolls are a little heavy on sauce or on the fusion side, but the nigiri negates all of that.  The garlic tuna is by far my favorite, a smoky garlic taste.  The hand rolls are fun and there's a great variety on the menu overall.

3592431,2014-10-03,12,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Yesterday I would have told you I have given up on AYCE sushi in Las Vegas.

Not that I have given up eating AYCE sushi (I would rather give up sunshine), but that I have given up expecting anything better than marginally fresh, questionably acceptable slices of fish on a ball of tasteless rice. This is what we have come to expect from the AYCE joints in town - from joints that pre-cut the individual sashimi slices, letting oxygen start to kill the taste and texture, to places that serve a thin slice of lemon on top to mask the tell-tale signs of fish that is about to go bad.

Today I am singing a new tune - watch me do my little happy dance (clap along if you feel that sushi is right for you).

JJANGA has restored my faith in AYCE sushi and brightened up my whole year. I have once again found an AYCE joint that serves fresh fish (Rod my friend - if you're reading this, I watched them pull the fresh filets of Salmon out of the ice myself, so maybe they got your message).

But the star of the day wasn't the salmon, or the yellowtail (which were both amazing BTW), it wasn't even watching Choo Choo perform with graceful precision - the star of the day was the tuna. Absolutely gorgeous to behold and a joy to devour, the tuna was just about as perfect as perfect can be. The same delicate quality of fish you can only find in some of the better pay-per piece sushi joints, with the added glory of a never-ending supply. (Oh, this has gotta be the good life, this has gotta be the good life.)

When was the last time you remember an AYCE sushi joint serving eel that is still warm and fresh from the toaster oven and not cold because they precooked it to save time? When was the last time you remember Cajun albacore tasting like Cajun at all (has it ever)? When's the last time the garlic sauce on the garlic tuna made you go ""Ooooo""? When was the last time they served you REAL wasabi at an AYCE? Huh? Go ahead, try to think of a time!

Simply an amazing lunchtime AYCE, better than expected by far, and they managed to top off great sushi and great service with an AYCE price a couple of dollars lower than most everywhere else in town - money! (I gotta feeling, that tonight's gonna be a good night!)

Came here for a lunch buffet at the recommendation of some local family. Probably the best meal we had during our Vegas trip!

Lunch AYCE is $21 (I think dinner is $26). Some of the more expensive items aren't included in the lunch meal, but that was fine. Kids are half priced and you can opt for the AYCE option for them, or order the kids meal separately.

I love how they give you small portions of everything, so you don't get full from eating just one or two things, but can try everything. They don't give you big balls of rice with your nigiri or in the rolls either. The fish was super fresh, and even their hot food items were good (garlic chicken wings!). They even have a small bowl of udon and a bunch of other appetizer dishes... all are small portions so you can try a lot of them.

Service was alright. They came to take our order, but you can tell they slowed down by the time the 3rd or 4th round came along. We love to eat!

The only thing to watch out for is they charge a 20% tip for large parties. I've heard of 15% or 18%, but 20% seemed a bit high, especially since the service wasn't all that great. It's the only thing keeping my review at 4-4.5 instead of 5.

Oh yeah, AYCE includes dessert!!! Green tea and red bean ice cream is so good!

And although they have a location that's only 5 min drive away, I'd rather do the 10-15 min drive to visit this location instead. Two words: SPEEDY SERVICE.

|| SERVICE ||
For awhile I stopped visiting here just because it was more convenient for me to dine at their new location, but service was always a struggle. Since we were in the area, myself and 10 others decided to go for some AYCE sushi and chose JJANGA. TEN PEOPLE. You know you're asking for some long wait times for anything. We were seated within 10 minutes in their private room. I only hang with sushi pros, so we were ready to order immediately. Pages and pages of orders for our poor server, but I kid you not, as soon as the last person finished ordering, the first dish came out. WHAAAAAT?? I know, doesn't that sound so wonderful!? We were so shocked, and 3 min after that, the plates just started rolling in and filling are table. 

|| FOOD ||
I love the fact that they have a good handful of options for no rice rolls and they don't limit you. Probably my favorite thing about this place really, because I hate filling up with rice. I'm not going to say that the quality is absolutely impeccable like its fresh fish that's being flown in twice a week, but for an AYCE, I am definitely quite happy with the quality. As for the rolls, I'm not a roll person, but they do have quite a bit of variety so you roll lovers have lots of options! No half roll orders though!

A causal spot that's great for dates. If you're flying solo, definitely grab a seat at the sushi bar. Sushi chefs are friendly and great company!

3806512,2014-03-21,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Went here yesterday to get our sushi fix after a nice day of hiking icebox canyon.  Our party of 6 was famished and was quickly seated for lunch.  It wasn't very busy as it was a weekday and we were having a late lunch.  ""The sooner I can sit down, the sooner I can get started on stuffing my face!"" is what I say.

I know it's difficult to have a large party go for AYCE, but when the staff forgets about what you ordered and constantly have to be reminded of it, you know there's some organization issues in the back.  There were a couple of dishes that didn't even make it to the table before our check did.  Regardless, it was a good start, but the staff couldn't handle our giant appetites towards the end.

Some notable dishes we had involved fresh fish and good flavor combinations.  Their maguro (red tuna) was excellent that day!  I'm normally a fan of salmon, but the nigiri to order was the maguro.  The redder, the better!  I also really enjoyed their Spider Roll (a classic) and their Double D Roll.  The Double D Roll was listed under their shrimp tempura special rolls and had great intermingling of flavors along with a little kick at the end.  It was one of our favorites!  Another plus was that they do not pack on the rice!

Now on to the not-so-great dishes.  The shiro maguro (albacore) that we ordered came seared when we were under the impression that it would have been raw.  Upon eating it, you could definitely taste a distinct fishiness, which shouldn't be the case if it were fresh.  They also topped it with what tasted like the garlic sauce they usually put on top of garlic tuna.  Since this was my first time here, I wasn't sure if this was their norm to sear the shiro maguro.  I honestly think this fish was on its way to going bad, so they needed to serve it but mask the extra fishy flavor.  Another one that wasn't so appetizing was their super white tuna, which isn't listed on their menu but somehow had it when we asked for it.  It was a little disappointing because the freshness wasn't there.  There were a couple of other nigiri that just didn't cut it to my expectation of freshness, but these two were the most distinct.

I would like to see this business succeed because the ambiance, decor and cleanliness of the restaurant is excellent.  The staff really has potential to excel!  Our server was very accommodating and attentive, but unfortunately the lunch staff in the back couldn't accommodate our large orders. I probably won't be back unless they make some changes to their organization and quality.

P.S. If you're in a bind for choosing your dessert, get the green tea mochi.  It appears to me that it is homemade and you really taste the yummy green tea flavor!  You won't regret it!",M7viqO453qdfE68UWI4uYg,2,0,3,dSIwP4Cb_vlhJRgqD6zY1Q

Based on the Yelp reviews, decided to give Jjanga a try.  The other reviewers were right about the wait, but it was well worth it.  We also grabbed another couple (we had no idea whom they were) and table shared, which I think startled the staff but made wait times shorter since a lot of us were just tables for two.  As a result, we got amazing service.
The Red Bull roll is amazing--just the right amount of hot with a touch of sour/bitter.  Also great was the garlic tuna nigiri, the poki salad, and the cowboy special.  I was not impressed with the Arizona Roll, and that was the only downer of the night--without the ginger sauce it's very bland.

The manager greeted us and would walk around to make sure everything was running smoothly. We did have a dedicated waitress but everyone pitched in to make sure our drinks were filled and our table was never bare. Great service!

+ Monkey Burrito
+ Jackpot Special
+ Nigiri!! 

I can't believe they had uni on their AYCE! Wow~ My only issue for it not being 5 star is that when we asked them to recommend stuff they recommended stuff we ended up not liking. They recommended the Jjanga Special, and the Something Wrong #69. When my hubs tried the first piece he was like ""something's wrong"" and almost spit out his food.

garlic tuna
Yozu Yellowtails (refreshing, lemon-y yellowtail)
XXX
Taste like your ex GF
Monkey Burrito
Jjanga burrito
Pink lady
tuna naruto (sauce on the side, if you like it less messy)

I have been following Jjanga since his days at Sumo on Warms springs! I'm glad him and his crew went on their own, so they fully explore what they can do with sushi.

Honestly you cannot go wrong with anything, depending on your taste. Also had the Bulgogi on the menu, sometimes it can be very onion-rich, but it's still good.

The limit for the AYCE was 1 hour, but I don't know how strictly that was enforced. Dinner was $25.95, which is comparable to most AYCE sushi joints.

Some of the highlights of the menu include the sashimi (choice of one item per person), hamachi kama, bulgogi, tobiko, sweet shrimp, oyster, and uni. Despite the lack of salmon belly here, the regular salmon nigiri was perfect as well as the version with the apple mayo sauce. I also really enjoyed the yuzu yellowtail. We skilled most of the rolls, but did try the hand's job. As one might expect, it was drenched in ""yum yum"" cream sauce and quite messy.

I was pleasantly surprised by how great all the nigiri was. The dessert included a delicious coconut flake ice cream, with flavors including green tea, which was quite creamy. The downsides of this AYCE menu are the lack of any specials, a much smaller nigiri menu, and less variety with the desserts.

The only reason why this review is getting 2 stars is because I enjoyed the food. But honestly the best tasting food can make you change your mind when it takes 30 minutes for you to get your first roll. 

Upon entry the lady (guessing she was new because she DID NOT know how to serve at all and I'm a server so I was giving her the benefit of the doubt for the first 20 minutes) took our drink orders, which you think wouldn't take so long since all I ordered was water but no I had to flag down another server after 15 minutes of just sitting and waiting before I got my glass of water. 

Placed our order and I did not get my first roll until we were sitting there for 30 minutes. Not to mention that all I ordered was nigiri! Later I asked for them to put a dash of Masago on top of my baked green muscles and our server proceeded to charge me EXTRA for a dash of Masago.

Extremely disappointed and will definitely not be coming back to Jjanga. Definitely letting my friends know not to come to Jjanga unless they want to be charged extra, get horrible service and wait 30 minutes for the first roll to come out.",qsF4rL6wEBY7eHg4VD5zcA,1,0,2,ydfMTGbnWLVhFn4sqW7T0A

I definitely wasn't a fan of how they handled the check, which bumped them down to 3* instead of 4*.

I get that we were there for a long time and they were effectively cutting us off, but there were more tactful ways of doing it. Not sure if our server asked the manager to handle it or he took it upon himself, but again, there are more polite ways to bring us the check and give us time to sort it out.

3951599,2015-11-09,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Jjanga has two locations, which both are good. I would say the newest one that opened on Ft. Apache has better customer service. 

They have an excellent AYCE - All You Can Eat - selection and they are not stingy with it. You can order as much as you want. They say the Salmon Belly nigiri is limited, but you can easily order three pieces per person without them saying anything. The best part about this place is their epic hand rolls. The Lisa Hand Roll and the Jjanga burrito is very unique. 

The Lisa Hand roll comes with fried tempura, spicy tuna, crab, and avocado. Add a hint of soy sauce and wasabi and you have yourself one of the best hand rolls ever made in town! The Jjanga burrito is wrapped with soy paper, crab meat, green onion, and shrimp fried rice inside. This can be eaten with soy sauce or alone. it is all based on your preference. 

The nigiri pieces are decent. The rice to sushi ratio is reasonable. They are not too strict, but will encourage you to take it slowly. However, they can keep up with you if you decide to order a lot. I recommend coming here not during rush hour because this place gets pretty packed on the weekends, during lunch, and dinner time! It is an awesome place to Karaoke as well. There are limited rooms, but you can request it, eat sushi, drink, and sing your heart out with your friends! Also, get an order of the chicken wings. They are really good. They take awhile to make so order it early and let it cool down when it gets to your table. You don't want to burn your tongue! 

The seating is okay. Sometimes it is a bit uncomfortable when you have to sit in a booth and the table is too far away from the booth seat. So I recommend getting seated somewhere you can have control of the table and actually move it closer to you. I recommend coming here on an empty stomach since it is all you can eat. You want to make sure you get your money's worth. 

Remember, the service is not the best. The Ft. Apache location I experienced better service at. Sometimes these people have a language barrier and it gets super busy so they can become overwhelmed quickly. You will need to be patient and enjoy the company of great people as you wait for your server to come. There is always Japenese pop music playing in the background, which is always fun to listen to while you eat.

That being said, I was glad to come to a birthday lunch at Jjanga with some friends.  And yes, I did overeat!

Sushi restaurants seem to try to outdo each other with names for rolls and for fillings as a hook for customers.  Dancing eel, Burning your ass, and Jackpot just to name three--all of which I fully ate or shared with others at the table.

The burning your ass is an example.  It has soft shell crab and spicy tuna but you couldn't taste the seafood because it had to live up to its name.  The tuna was spicy tuna but it was overwhelmed by the spiciness of the roll, the sriracha on top, and then slices of jalapeño on top of that.  But, that's what I wanted and it was good.  It was very hotly spiced rice.

The Jackpot roll and Mel's roll were good.  The crispy things they put on the rolls are interesting and add texture.  It was the first time I'd had them.

For the finale, I had both red bean and green tea ice cream.  It was a nice way to end this food orgy.

Service was first rate!  With a group of 14 people calling out orders to the server things sounded hectic.  She kept right up with us and things were served in a timely manner.

We went to JJANGA at the tail end of our wedding weekend, hours before our return flight home.  We wanted something off-strip, affordable and AYCE.  We wanted to be able to drive there, park without a valet, and then return our rental car in time.  Yelp led us to JJANGA and I can't wait to go back.  I love the vibe of the restaurant.  It's heavy in dark woods with booths that sort of resemble pagodas.  There's a nice long sushi bar tucked in the back.  The sushi bar was popular but we were lucky to score two seats right in the middle of the sushi-making action.

I can't remember everything we tried but the rolls were innovative and plentiful.  The sushi chef handed us small bites and tastes along the way.  I think JJANGA's special hook is their ""burritos,"" which are small bundles of fish or rice noodles and fish or other fixings wrapped in soy paper.  We ordered one that was wrapped in pink soy paper and drizzled with a pink sauce.  

Fish was premium and veggies were fresh.  I didn't feel like I was eating AYCE.  Most AYCE sushi restaurants shove you full of rice, mostly, and make you want to calculate the price of each roll so you can ensure you've gotten your $30 worth of food.  This sushi restaurant makes you want to take a minute to appreciate the cuts of fish and their garnishes.  

I'm not sure how long JJANGA has been open but I hope they don't make too many changes to their menu, philosophy or prices before we can get back to Las Vegas.

No offense, but I am somewhat skeptical to try any korean-run Japanese restaurant. As stated by another yelper Philip T., ""Calling this Japanese is very misleading"". This restaurant is not your typical traditional Japanese restaurant. A lot of fusion style/unique, rather unnecessary touch added to sushi. 

SERVICE
Nothing bad to say about the service here. Fast and friendly service. All the food came out quickly and place was clean.

FOOD
I love sushi, but not a fan of fusion/innovative rolls. I don't know if it is because I am still traumatized from my first fusion roll experience where I ate a sushi with cream cheese and mango (it just doesn't go together...just no). I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried one of their deep-fried sushi called Touch Down. $8 for 5-7 small pieces and it was nothing special.

I also tried their Alaska roll. Very simple roll with just avocado and thick slice of salmon inside. Decent portion for the price and I enjoyed the thick cut of salmon in it. I would order this again if I ever come back. 

I also tried Unagi bowl which was another mediocre dish. Thinly-sliced Unagi on rice. Nothing special.

Jjanga is new and not busy
Jjanga has excellent service
Jjanga is a good pick if you're looking for some Yum Yum Rolls. 

I'm not a sushi snob, but I do prefer Sashimi's and Nigiri over rolls.  It's been forever since I've had a Yum Yum Roll.  For some reason, I was craving these California Rolls drenched in mayo. It's been awhile. It's been a very long time.  So, when the gf suggested sushi for our Valentine's Day dinner instead of our usual steak dinner, I couldn't help be get a little excited about it.  

From the time we walked in to the time we left, we had nothing but excellent service.  The team at Jjanga can sure teach a few other sushi restuarants out there about customer service.  They know what's up and they knew how to treat me and my special lady.  Good Job, Jjanga!

My Items:
Mells Roll:  This was my first roll of the evening. How could I not get this roll, right?  Inside was crab and shrimp.  This roll has a spectacular name, but was just okay when it came to taste.  
 
Jjanga Burrito:  This is a hand roll with shrimp, broccoli tempura, and crab wrapped in soy paper.  This was actually pretty good and great light option if you're looking for something that isn't going to weigh you down. 

Jackpot Special:  Jackpot!  I think I found the king of all Yum Yum Rolls.  This one had shrimp tempura on the inside with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and of course a ton of mayo sauce on the outside.  If you're going to eat bad, might as well get this. I probably could have gotten two of these rolls. 

Freshman Roll:  This had everything...tuna, salmon, and crab.  Wrapped in rice paper, my taste buds were a little confused on what it was tasting because there was so much going on.  But I still thought that this was good.  

Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  What was I thinking?  The brown rice wasn't the best and the chicken was a little bland even with Teriyaki sauce. My bad...I shouldn't be going to a sushi restuarant expecting great chicken. 

Regarding their food, I only had 4 full rolls, their Jjanga burrito, Teriyaki chicken, and Green Tea Mochi.  Needless to say, I was stuffed.  I thought that the sushi was fresh, the rolls were tight, and all were packed with taste.  Bottomline, the food is fresh.  On my next visit, I will probably go back to Sashimi's and Nigiri's because that's what I prefer.  But from someone that doesn't frequent a Yum Yum Roll, I recommend this place. I

PS:  They got the same rolls as Sumo. So if you're a fan of Sumo, then you'll be a fan of Jjanga.

Both of my visits have been for lunch, right at opening (11:30 am), and I sat at the bar. 
On both visits, waitress service was on point. No orders were forgotten, and drinks always refilled. 

On my first visit, Choo-Choo was the sushi chef. He was great, tons of personality, and he hooked us up with his special off-menu creation which was delicious.
On my second visit, I overheard the person seated next to me ask the chef to just make him his favorite, off-menu creations. The chef told him he would only do that if the customer paid the higher AYCE dinner price, which I thought was pretty lame. 

For nigiri, I find JJANGA's offerings to be ok.. decent enough fish quality and fish/rice ratio.  For rolls, some of the speciality rolls sound like they could be interesting, but sadly most of the ones I have tried have fallen flat flavor-wise. And I can't get past that weird pink sauce that is on some of them...  I did like the rice-less Tuna Naruto a lot though!

Overall, I suppose JJANGA would do in a pinch, if other spots were too busy. Personally, I prefer to do my ACYE sushi eating up the street at another spot though...",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,6,5,3,wp80kdu014FchVsLp1Si2A

They separate their rolls in categories such as shrimp tempura based rolls and no rice rolls.  There are a few items where they limit one order per person, such as Uni, sweet shrimp, and a handful of other items.   The rice to fish ratio is just OK here.

4106821,2015-06-19,2,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Yeah, I'm not so sure about this place anymore.

I wanted to eat elsewhere tonight but, long story short, it's a place with long wait times and they gave away the table when my out-of-town friends were late to arrive. I chose JJANGA as the backup AYCE sushi restaurant because I'd enjoyed it in the past and because it was just a couple of miles from plan A.

Most of the food wasn't too bad. I had a lot of the same things as in my first review, so I'll make comparisons as I can.

Screaming orgasm and golden scallop were still pretty good, and I can hardly ever complain about any baked green mussels. Hotate ebi skewer was alright, but I did feel that the lone bay scallop (a tiny cylindrical piece) didn't represent the ""hotate"" very well. Pike mackerel was annoying because I kept having to dig out pieces of bone, and I thought the accompanying sauce was too vinegar-y.

My nigiri favorites from last time all held up: beef tataki (the best of the bunch), super white, salmon, yuzu yellowtail, and unagi. I do feel that I would have enjoyed the salmon and super white more at other places though.

The monkey burrito was still tasty. Screaming honey seemed to have less of the sauce than last time, and the presentation inside a bowl instead of on a plate struck me as odd.

Now for the escalating series of bad news. First, I learned from the server that the hotate nigiri would definitely also have been bay scallop, which is unfortunate when I can get fresh scallop at my favorite place just a couple of miles down Decatur. Another mystery that was taken away was the amaebi, which I found out was too mushy. The worst part, however, was the uni. After I ordered it, I saw that another person had received uni that appeared too dark-orange, even brownish. I tried to wave a server down to cancel my order, but by the time I managed to do so, somebody had already brought my uni out. This order appeared pale and even gray. Obviously, I refused to eat it.

I might still consider this location as a plan B, but only for desperate situations such as tonight. However, it's no longer a top tier AYCE sushi restaurant in my book. I can see why Michael K. would have lost interest in AYCE if he been eating here.

Well... it's not absolutely horrid, it's just not good with terrible service.  As I write this first paragraph I am torn between two and one stars.  It's been settled one star.  Let me tell you how I got there.

Food:  The food... is not good.  I didn't get sick, I didn't think the fish tasted terrible, it was all just so very bland and off.  We started off with one of the ""burritos"" which was fish, krab, cucumber, and avocado, wrapped in rice and a rice paper wrap.  This was the best thing we ate.  We actually said to each other, ""If this is what all their food is like, we're totally sold on this place!""  That is, however, where things started to get worse.  

We ordered about 2 dozen orders of nigiri with various fish on top.  Salmon, yellow tail, tuna, squid, and scallops.  My usual thought is that the rice should have sushi rice taste and the fish should be a decent thickness with a good texture and a little chilly.  This place basically gave us plain rice (little to no vinegar taste) with fish that I didn't know you could cut it that thin.  The most confusing part to me was that the fish was warm.  Not room temp, but warm warm.  Like, it's been sitting on top of an oven that was turned on and it didn't cook but got warm.  This made my stomach question its freshness.  

I also ordered a couple of cut rolls, rice-less rolls, and a hand roll.  The alaska hand roll to be specific.  Or as I like to call it, salmon slurry shoved into seaweed that looks like a dog just puked up a piece of salmon gristle.  I couldn't finish it to say the least.  

Food being mediocre, ok that's a 2-3 star score so why the 1?  Service.

After 45 minutes of being seated.  We had ordered twice and eaten once.  Funny how that is since their menu says, ""Ordering time limit is 45 minutes"".  I mean seriously, 45 minutes to cut fish in a restaurant that is NOT busy on a Friday afternoon.  When i say not busy, I mean there are 3 tables that have people at it and 6 people at the sushi bar.  45 minutes!!! The waitress responsible for our table kept on walking past us and avoided eye contact and to add salt to the wound, in the end, she charged us for dinner prices instead of lunch.  

Will i come back?  NO.  Do I think it's worth suggesting to others?  NO.

Super friendly staff that can't do enough for you, even making sure you don't want just one more order of nigiri and don't forget your dessert!

Yes, the nigiri and sashimi portions are smaller, but the quality of fish was excellent, we had various kinds including salmon (including roe, hamachi, octopus. Hand rolls are generous, and they don't mind some customization. There's a nice selection of specialty rolls, and they are all normal sized. 

I'd skip the shumai, it was fried for some reason. , and the soft shell crab roll was mostly surimi mix. Chocolate mochi for dessert was a nice finish. We'll definitely hit this place up when we return to Vegas.",LwG2tT8NogcnoEKYn6IaJg,2,0,4,dw9z2L8yhkHuHkZl9csnfQ

5STARS, this place is tucked away on the side of Grn Valley Grocery on Decatur/Twain.  Please do not be frightened by the surrounding location, ok so it's a little hood but if you are driving along that area of town you already know this.

We went in w/ a game plan (don't drink a lot of water, don't over do it on the appetizers, and no need to rush and stuff you face 'despite how good it may be' PACE OURSELVES)

EPIC FAIL: it was so GOOD, that I could not stop. We started off w/ spicy garlic endamame, shrimp tempura and seaweed salad.

SEAWEED SALAD: fresh, nice crunch, it is not soggy and oversaturated w/ dressing.  You have the pleasure of enjoying both the crunchy-ness of the seaweed and the sweet/tangy-ness of the dressing.

I'm not big on cream cheese and sushi rolls but the FAT ASS: a mixture of tuna, salmon, tuna w/ cream cheese and a mayo sauce. oh yea, and its DEEP FRIED.  The cream cheese is not the STAR of the roll, I find that rolls w/ cream cheese tend to be heavy w/ cream cheese.  This was not, the variety of fish that this roll is made of is the STAR.

Other rolls we tried:
Crazy ASS
Joe Special
Tiger Roll
Crunch Roll
I Love My ASS
XXX

ok, so I'm fascinated w/ A$$, these rolls are so good though, ijs.  I want to say that they have almost close to 100 rolls on the menu, the even have SUSHI BURRITOS (which I will try on my next visit)

All in All I'm hooked on this place, no not because it's walking distance from the house (it's a (+) that is walking distance) but it is AWESOME quality fish being served.

Very nice atmosphere, the restaurant is lighted and clean. (you're not sitting in the dim lighted room, trying to make out what placed in front of you.

They only have one AYCE sushi place near where they live and they said most of the rolls are basically cream cheese and rice rolls with a sneeze of fake crab or tuna. Those poor kids. 

So I went on a mission to take them to fun and decent places for AYCE sushi while in Vegas. This place has such a large menu and I also liked that they had ""normal"" food for my Dad who has an aversion to sushi. He was happy as a clam to order an a la carte teriyaki dinner and he loved all of it. His only complaint was that he asked for french fries but he got mashed potatoes instead.

The other 4 adults in the party did AYCE and we went pretty hard on the rolls and nigiri. The variety was pretty cool although some seemed to be a lot of repeats with maybe a small variation in an ingredient. But I do I like that they had a variety of no-rice rolls, Tuna Naruto being my favorite. My second favorite was the Big Easy roll with their garlic ponzu sauce. The poke salad was a little off and did not taste very fresh to me. 

Sometimes they were a little slow in coming back around to get our orders again and it was not busy just yet because we had started eating dinner at 5:30pm. The waitress was sweet but seemed very inexperienced. She brought us the wrong roll a couple of times and did not know the menu very well. Even just trying to get them to give us the check took a while. By that time, people were lining up waiting for a seat, so we wanted to get out of there so the table to could be turned over.

My favorite specialty rolls (not a huge sauce fan):
-Arizona Roll
-Spring Mountain Roll

Beware of the wait. Wait time seems to vary due to the AYCE option, but the staff is pretty efficient and friendly. Also, they have karaoke rooms on the other end of the dining area.

The service is even worse. I would have to get up to look for some service. The waitress would look at our empty cup of water still no food on the table ( in which the food takes 45 mins) ask if everything is okay then walks away assuming we are okay. Helllllloooo?

When we placed an order in which each of us got 3-4 rolls she goes ""you guys can finish this? You will be charged"". Excuse me, if we couldn't finish it we would never order.

There are many roll options including those with rice and those without rice. You can get hand rolls or regular rolls.

I like that everything on the menu comes in small portions and/or they offer a lot of items not too heavy on the rice so that we get to try a variety of things without getting full too quickly.

Why?

My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas over the past weekend. We decided to steer away from the pricey and potentially over-hyped restaurants along the strip and try the local restaurants in the city. We looked on Yelp and this new AYCE place was rated 5 stars - was a given that we should give it a try!

We came here just after lunch time so it wasn't too much. The first thing that struck us was the welcoming decor and matching cool restaurant t-shirts of the servers! It's so refreshing to go to an AYCE sushi restaurant with the ambience and feel of a a la carte sushi place. 

The menu offered a wide selection of nigiri and rolls. They even had Hamachi yellowtail included in the AYCE pricing (this is very rare in Toronto where we're from). 

Service: friendly staff, server was somewhat helpful with the wide selection of menu, orders came quickly, the pace of the orders that arrived at our table was perfect to our eating pace, plates cleared off of table promptly.

Food: the ratio of fish to rice was perfect (not too much rice), sushi tasted very fresh, rolls were very creative with many types of combinations of ingredients and extremely tasty (it's obvious that they had spend a lot of time in finding the right combinations that complement each other). 
Favourite nigiri: hamachi
Favourite rolls: candy cane, playboy special

Price: very reasonable for the quality of the food

The first round of hamachi looked incredible and tasted great. The 2nd round of hamachi were poor looking and was warm temperature! 

The only fish that tasted fresh were hamachi and salmon, the rest of the fish, i can pass. 

I just cannot stand sashimi to be warm -- just not sanitary! 
and these fish weren't thick cut either.. they're quite thinly sliced.

some of the rolls were okay; spider roll was fine. I wish they would serve us faster so I can try different items.

Been here a couple times with friends and once on a date. The atmosphere is set for you to relax and enjoy time with your friends while you have no choice but to listen to Asian (mostly Korean) music play throughout the restaurant. 

Come hungry since they do offer AYCE for a great lunch price of $20.95. The variety of rolls are good, and the seafood quality is good, but I always look forward to their Chef Specials. Just let them know what fish you enjoy the most and they will prep something up for ya. What I could not get tired of was their Oysters! They are prepared perfectly with a kick  Unfortunately they have a one time order (3 per person). 
Another favorite of mine to look forward to is the Grapefruit Sake! There will be a party the day I No worries on paying extra for it since it comes with your AYCE. Personally I am not a fan of grapefruit, although it really compliments the sake itself.

Big thanks to Hickey for getting me a hickey that one night.. nahh, those days are over. He sure can make one hell of a salmon special though.
To Jjanga himself, you are appreciated for hosting me and my Yelp buddies, as well as preparing us a birthday ice cream dish. 

I would have to say that the biggest problem is usually making contact with the servers. Like many other places that I have been to (which is why I cant complain much), they seem to act def at times.

4447876,2015-07-30,5,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"I had JJANGA bookmarked for a while due to its high Yelp rating. I went with three of my foodie friends who were all excited to try a new AYCE sushi restaurant. 

JJANGA is pretty small yet very inviting in decor. When you walk in, the sushi bar is to the left and long wooden booths and tables for seating straight ahead. It's dimly lit with colored light up lanterns hanging from the ceiling which totally sets the mood for a sushi restaurant. They also have huge blown up posters of their sushi chefs on the walls which I thought was kind of hilarious and enjoyed!

We of course did AYCE and for drinks had some Mango Soju (which was absolutely delicious, tastes like juice but the alcohol creeps up on you) and cold sake. The house sake is cheap here, $3 for a small and $6 for a large! 

For AYCE entrees, we tried a little bit of everything. Salmon, hamachi, garlic tuna, tuna, and super white tuna to name a few nigiri. We also got seaweed salad, poke salad, hotate ebi skewer (grilled shrimp), dynamite, Shu Mai, grilled mackerel (comes out whole), baby squid, fresh oysters, and a few of the rolls. 

Pros: 
- Nigiri comes in small portions but the raw fish tastes fresh and delicious. The super white tuna is incredible!
- Very tasty rolls. At one point we asked one of the servers to surprise us with her favorite roll and it was to die for. Shrimp tempura wrapped in tuna, topped with crab salad and drizzled in a creamy sauce. No rice and no seaweed! SO good!
- Grilled mackerel was bomb. Came with a tangy ponzu sauce. Had to be careful picking around the bones since they bring you out the entire fish
- Seaweed salad was great but the portion is tiny. My advice would be to order two 
- Shu Mai was very good! Not a dish you would usually see on an AYCE sushi menu but all of us thoroughly enjoyed it 
- My friends tried the uni (sea urchin) and really liked it. Said it was less saltier than other sushi restaurants and had a nice flavor to it. I thought it looked disturbing. Still haven't built up the courage to personally try uni...

Cons: 
- Oysters tasted a little too much like the sea. It had a light ponzu sauce on it but the fishiness was overpowering 
- The dynamite was really odd. Didn't look nor taste like your typical dynamite. When I order dynamite I expect like a baked concoction of seafood smothered in a creamy light orange sauce. There wasn't much creaminess about this dynamite. It was brown in color and had an abundance of sliced mushrooms (?)
- Whatever the poke salad was marinated in tasted sour 

I would definitely say the pros outweighed the cons and the service was pleasant. I enjoyed my experience here and will be coming back for some AYCE!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,8,7,4,iz3M1qU2nlYAhIMJaKxCZw

My friends and I came to Jjanga to celebrate the birthday twins and it was probably the BEST all you can eat sushi experience I've ever had....

1)  Without going into specifics, I will tell you that Jjanga's service is EXTRAORDINARY.  Warm, hospitable, fast, and adaptive - they'll make you feel like royalty.  These servers move so fast that if you order sake, sake will appear almost instantly.  At one point, we lost who our main server was because there were so many people handing us food and clearing plates all at once!

2)  The rolls...were delicately crafted and really creative!  I was really impressed with the variety.  If you see some of my other AYCE reviews, you'll note the various strategies that AYCE restaurants use to devalue your experience (too much rice, too much sauce, too many rolls per order, etc).  Not the case here.  Everything was delicious and contributed to a great eating experience.

3)  Uni.  All the uni you could ever want!  So yum!

4)  My list of favorites:
- Who's your daddy
- Baby octopus
- Chicken wing
- Grand canyon roll
- Big easy roll (garlic + ponzu sauce mmMm)

5)  AYCE menu includes soup, salad, sides/apps, and even dessert!  For those craving a lighter fare, this menu offers a variety.

Don't bother rubbing your belly too long, be sure to check out the karaoke rooms!  An hour of karaoke was a great transition from dinner to dancing later.  Food + libations + friends = good times at Jjanga.  Will definitely be back!",lNxRaIO2wNqMkCcQ8hhtyQ,1,1,5,oodwqxM2nZSZzVtBvEq5eA

We weren't expecting much especially considering most ayce sushi places use poor quality fish and pack in the rice so hard that its like you are eating a rock, but Jjanga ended up pleasantly surprising us.

We ended up trying a lot of the nigiri and rolls and there were definitely some ups and downs, but I would mainly say ups. One thing to note when coming here, don't expect something more traditional like what you get at Kabuto, but that's one thing I do like about Jjanga that they have some fun rolls and the iron chef banners of the chefs on the back :)

Garlic Tuna - I liked this one because it had garlic, some spice, and a decent fish on top.

Cajun Albacore - I wasn't a fan of this particular dish, I didn't feel that the flavors went well together.

Salmon - The fish was decent, but definitely not as good as the salmon I get in Seattle.

Three Some - This was by far our favorite, really enjoyed the flavors and how can you go wrong with deep fried cream cheese :p

Gyoza - Its a standard gyoza lol.

Bulgogi - I was surprised I liked the bulgogi here since I am very very picky and typically only like my home made bulgogi.

Chicken Wings - These were tempura fried chicken wings, they were surprisingly good but very hot when you first get them, like burn your mouth and continue burning your face as the oil drips down as you're screaming and trying to get a napkin to wipe it -_-

We got plenty more, but I don't remember the exact names of the other rolls. Another thing I really appreciated was that they put a normal amount of rice for the nigiri, unlike other ayce I have been to where they progressively put more and more rice as you order. For an ayce we felt that the quality was very good and even better then some of the a la carte sushi restaurants we have been to. And to top it off the service was also good.

We went here because they have an all you can eat option for $26. Which is a really good deal, you can choose anything on the menu. 
I'm not an all you can eat kind of girl, so they also had an ala carte option. I ordered the spicy scallop and crab roll, eight pieces for only $3! And the roll was spicy, normally things aren't when they say they are, so I was very happy that they weren't lying. I normally use sriracha like ketchup, which is about a 2 for me. This roll would have been a 7. I also ordered their kabocha soup. This was surprisingly sweet, but not overly sweet. I liked the consistency as well, loose with a little grit. 
The service as interesting. I believe that everyone is pooling, so everyone helps everyone. But at times this seemed like it causes confusion because they didn't communicate with each other. Everyone was friendly which is good. At times I felt like they didn't understand what we wanted, but I'm not sure why.

As someone who comes from a customer service professional background, Jjanga left a very bad impression on my family and myself after tonight's dine in experience. 

Jjanga is extremely unorganized and super slow when it comes down to their service. From missing orders from our appetizers and sushi and providing extra food of any appetizer or sushi we didn't order. They took over 15 minutes to give our octopus nigiri roll. Seriously? We had to constantly keep asking and checking on the order, but the waitresses showed no concern and if we hadn't checked on it so much we probably wouldn't receive our octopus nigiri just like the other items we ordered that was never obtained.

Also the waitresses would just place our orders on the table and run along immediately afterwards. They never once initiated and asked if everything was okay, or if we would want to order more food, but we were the ones always having to try to catch them to place another order. I assumed that since we were in a big party that they would be more attentive but I was wrong. I was trying to order ice cream from this waitress, but she literally looked at me and ignored me. That definitely did not sit right with me once she did that, so I did get a little loud and told her what's up.

4570971,2014-03-03,6,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"I was intrigued by the enormous number of high reviews in a short time, but was never sure when I would make it here.  Saturday night was double date night with our friends who are getting married at the end of the month.  We both had Hachi coupons for Red Rock and carpooled from Henderson to eat there, only to find it mysteriously closed without notice.  We all wanted sushi (well, Steven S. doesn't eat sushi but will eat cooked stuff) so I angled for Jjanga and Nicole B. begged for Oyshi.  I won since we drove, and off we went :)

Upon arriving at Jjanga, we walked into a really nice, spacious and well-decorated atmosphere.  The guy greeting us was so full of energy!  We had no wait thankfully and were immediately seated at a booth that had an impressive structure to it.  The booths are very spacious and sort of private, which was cool.  The service was truly outstanding throughout the night!  Our primary server was Jane, but everyone on the team including Mr. Energy were checking on us.  The food orders came out so fast that we were never waiting too long, except for the cooked meal.

We started off with iced green tea for me and Steven S.  Eric R. got hot green tea.  Our gripe was that the tea was basically water with a dash of green color.  No flavor - Eric R. asked for a pot was told there is only one for the whole restaurant.  We got refills but these items are not worth the cost in the future.

Steven S. went with the salmon teriyaki and subbed brown rice - this took quite awhile for him to get and initially the rice came out white - instead of leaving his hot plate and bringing him new rice, it was taken away for awhile but did come back steaming hot...except his side dish of ""mashed potatoes"" was a cold pink potato salad which freaked him out.  I tasted it and it was fine, but I do not think Americans like cold mashed potatoes.

The 3 of us did AYCE, and there were many items to try.  My first round included yuzu yellowtail, a salmon skin handroll, scallop sushi, and mackerel.  The salmon skin handroll came out surprisingly fast and it was quite excellent, crisp, non-greasy, with gobo, avocado and cucumber.  The yuzu yellowtail was pretty good.  The mackerel was covered in this ginger dressing that I found odd for pairing, but the scallop was great - nice hunks of scallop mixed with masago and green onion.  Eric R. got the Washington roll (salmon and avocado but with that ginger dressing again, which he did not like and Steven S. did not like on his salad - it was kind of creamy) and a few other pieces (tuna, halibut).  For apps, for grins I got who's your ex wife (jalapeno stuffed with fish) and agedashi tofu (teeny tofu square, tasty but more room temperature).  Eric R. got the ebi hotate skewer which he said was covered in some sort of mustard sauce.  We also tried the bulgogi app which was actually really good - with onions on a hot sizzling plate.

Nicole B. got James Bond, California, and Spider Rolls and seemed happy with them - they were able to make rolls with brown rice too.  Eric R. then got the sashimi salad (he said it was okay) but was happy with the poki salad.  Our next round of nigiri was ikura and beef tataki for Eric R. and tako, ika, and amaebi for me.  The amaebi was really good.  I asked the energetic guy up front for the fried heads which is happily offered to get for me upon request.  I ordered 2 but since they took awhile he brought me 4.  Next Eric R. and I got negihama handrolls, and I had jalapeno slices added and he got surf clam.  My final order was another round of scallop nigiri and uni.  The uni was all excellent except for one piece which was darker and when I bit into it I hit a huge piece of shell.  I showed it to a server and it was no big deal - but she did apologize.

Eric R. got mochi and ice cream and Nicole B. got mochi to finish.  The highlights of the experience are the ambiance, the great service, and the very fast delivery of food.  Nothing was ever forgotten, food came as soon as it was ready, and many servers stopped by to check on us and take more orders.  No one ever seemed rushed or trying to time us.  What I recommend from my experience are the salmon skin handroll, scallop sushi, bulgogi, and the amaebi.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,7,8,4,fzHpSjlP3AWm7VWtQu-rGA

We were a group of 14 at 11pm at night and the restaurant was almost empty on a Friday night; that shouldn't been our first indication but we had kids with us and everyone was hungry. 

We were seated promptly and about 5 of us decided on AYCE. The AYCE menu is so limited, most of what you can order are rolls and nagiri. The rolls are huge portions and they don't offer half orders. Most AYCE sushi places offer half orders and include more choices (meat options, soup options, etc) 

The flavor of their rolls were mostly sour. My husband ordered the 4 rolls that people can order only once and all 4 of them had some sort of sour component either lemon infused or powdered with something tasting like tajin- which in Japanese is not something one expects. 

For the price and the limited options, people are better off looking at other places on spring mountain. 

The upside- the service was great (I mean 3 chefs and 4 waiters for 18 ppl ratio)and  the fish was fresh.

Was it because there was 2 big Hawaiian and you counted us as 1 1/2 each?  Or was you hoping for us not to see that charge on the bill  and tip you on top of that?

I've tried Island Sushi & Grill and Umiya in the past.  This time, a girl friend and I were curious about the 4.5-star rated Jjanga.

We came in for a super late dinner, around 10:00 pm, on a Friday evening.  The place was probably half full so we didn't need to wait for a table.  The staff happily greeted us with a smile and explained hot the AYCE deal works.  We dove right in and ordered the favorites, which turned out to be the ones that can only be ordered once -- the uni, poke salad, sweet shrimp, golden scallop, and beef tataki -- all of which were delicious!  I remember ordering the unagi more than once too.  What I especially liked was this off-menu item, the pork steak with miso?  I don't remember what it was called but our server suggested it in place of one the items I pointed out on the menu.  It was divine...like melt in your mouth, gimme-my-rice, sort of divine.  

What I also liked about Jjanga is the candidness of our server.  I forget her name now, but I truly appreciated her honest opinions on the various menu items.  I was going to order the fried rice and she basically vetoed it because it wasn't worth the tummy space.  She also steered us away from the special rolls because she wanted to get the most of our money by indulging in the nigiri and classic rolls.  Some say she's a buttinski, but truthfully, I appreciated her two cents!

I tried JJANGA in west of 215 a while back because some iPhone repair guys said JJ was way better than Sushimon. Since I live close by the west location off I went to that one.

No, it wasn't better than sushimon by any imagination, save for the bigger space and fancier decor and benches for my derrière. But then again I came to eat sushi not sit on sushi. At the west locale, I did not like their sauce all over the sushi and was not fond of the service there. I swore I would never go back again. A friend said the original place was better and wanted to meet there and try it out. Well, guess what? This place is worse. 

The tuna fish is weird. They don't look fresh. The tuna is not firm but almost like its been lightly ground thru a grinder. But it's very red probably due to food coloring. It looked like the tuna and salmon but had liberal amounts of color added in. The salmon looked rubbery so I did not even bother to try them. I don't like sauce drizzled on my sushi either. We aren't eating salads here. The eel came out big but it got leathery when cold. The salmon roe did not look or taste that fresh. They looked like they were starting to gel together.

The rice less rolls were good but I don't like sauce on top of them. The nude rolls and octopus were 2 good items here. The rice rolls are either wrapped in rice noodle sheets like spring rolls or they are in cucumber sheets. These rice less rolls seem to be their signature. The miso soup is an experience into the bland devoid of tofu or seaweed. It tastes like they diluted the bottom of the pot with more water to serve more people.

The service was good and bad. While they cleared the plates away quick, no one bothered to refill your water. Until the check came out that is. I'm guessing they want you alive to pay the bill. As it was a 2pm lunch, there weren't that many tables eating to begin with. On the menu it says there is happy hour from 11pm-1am. I am guessing you can get the lunch pricing and menu at that time. Well I am not impressed when I am sober so I don't think I will be impressed when I am drunk eating at that time either. Pass. Believe the 3 star Elite reviewers, just go to somewhere closer like the one near Tea Planet.

Sadly, this establishment changed ownership and starkly changed their menu. It no longer features the things that made this sushi spot unique. Instead it's now just another general sushi restaurant. The veggie options have been reduced to the basics. There is no longer the wonderful creativity in the veggie options. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for veg heads anymore. 


This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it's clean and extremely friendly. It is extremely pleasant every time I've eaten here. While I've never had there all you can eat special every roll I've had has been fantastic. 

Some people may not like this, but it adds authenticity and excitement for me, but the rolls can be inconsistent based on the chief that prepares it. The basic flavors are the same, but they have a slightly different personality. This shows the talents of the chiefs along with their ability to add their own artistic flavors to the food. 

They also have a good range of vegetarian options, which is always refreshing for veg heads like me. If you are in the area, give it a try.

We had the great pleasure of being served by the Sushi Hero Captain Choo at the bar. At some point it just became an Omakase situation. I was unable to find a fault with any aspect of Jjanga. 

We pretty much ran the gauntlet on the Nigiri section and not one piece disappointed. So if you want my opinion as to what you should order, close your eyes and point because its all good. I have a few friends who usually do not like things like Saba, Unagi or Tako. I would take them here because Jjanga could change their minds. I personally think they have the best cure on Saba in town. 

I am not a big sushi roll person but there are a lot of selections on the menu that excited my taste buds. I am still riding a food high right now so I will have to get back to you with a list of what rolls we tried. I have never had a riceless roll before, but Sushi Hero Captain Choo has introduced me to some great dishes. He also made a couple of special dishes for us which I am still smiling about three hours later. It pays to let him have creative license on your sushi. After a few orders he seemed to have nailed our preferences. He's a great chef. Also met Jjanga himself and I can't wait to eat his food. They were all super cool and fun.

So the sushi is excellent. No questions about that. The appetizers are equally as great. If I was a fish, you would catch me by using Fried Chicken as bait. Jjanga is now my favorite chicken wing place. I do not suggest things often, but I would not hesitate to recommend the Chicken Wings. Jjanga could sell that alone and I would still be a regular. The Bulgogi is also perfectly executed. The memory of the Bulgogi has me salivating as I write about it. The meat and the marinade are perfect IMO. Try that too. If Jjanga sold Galbi it would be my favorite Korean restaurant as well lol.

Well this review is already too long. You get the picture. I really like this place. High quality food and service with great prices. Easy 5 Stars.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,6,4,5,9mayq5KQEKmrj4szd71zRQ

I used to work down the street and we'd come to Jjanga since it was a mere 5mins drive.  The rolls here are huge!  It takes almost 2 bites to eat 1 piece, so be conservative when you're ordering AYCE and ask for 1/2 rolls instead.

Fish is fresh but rolls are very drenched in sweet eel sauce or mayo sauce.  I am a fan of nigiri so heavily sauced rolls is not for me.  Coworkers are always happy to come here.  Plenty of rolls and appetizers offering on the menu.

We've never had to make a reservation or wait long for a table here during weekdays lunches.  Not a bad spot to visit if you're near the Strip",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,0,0,4,skj3bRep--qwVZwYjapKqA

Overall good quality of fish, but not necessarily superb. On one instance had a plate of Uni that was unpalatable.

Salmon nigiri - so amazing, melted in my mouth. 
Garlic tuna nigiri - well seasoned and juicy. 
Monkey burrito - *Drool* so orgasmic.
Fresh Oysters - already comes with hot sauce & the goods, I'm so glad they have it.
Unagi - I'm usually not fond of unagi but the eel sauce is da bomb
Sweet shrimp - soo fresh and so yummy!
Crab balls - perfectly fried goodness topped off with delicious sauce 
Poki salad - I love when it's not actual salad. Just seaweed & tuna drenched in sauce. Other places the poki salad is served in a big bowl with a lot of salad and hardly any fish. They hook it up here! 

So, to sum it all up, I had a very satisfying experience. I've never had our food served so fast and we ordered so much.

adding also that our orders came pretty quickly! 
We ate so much that our last roll had 2-3 pieces left and we had it sitting on the table for a bit worrying about being charged extra because we were way too full to finish it all haha, and she was kind enough to take it away and ask if we wanted any dessert before receiving the bill.

4928678,2016-04-04,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"I had a decent experience at Jjanga. I read that is was one of the top AYCE around, so I decided to give it a shot. As a starter, I had a reservation for 6 tonight (heads up, 20% included gratuity of 6+ parties). We were welcomed by the hostess and staff members, which is common in many Japanese restaurants. 

It took us a while to decide who was doing AYCE, but we got it settled (1hr time limit on ordering, no time limit on dining. I'll get to this in a moment). 

My personal orders: our first round of sushi came out rather quicker than expected, which gave them some pretty good kudos. 

Dancing Dragon: dragon roll with some shrimp tempura through out. Roll slightly smaller than I've seen in other establishments. Rice to topping ratio was good. Pretty fresh. 4 out of 5. 

Spider Roll: soft shell crab and California roll combo. Again, smaller roll than other places. Personally, could have topped with a little more eel sauce. 3.5 out of 5. 

Beef tataki: 2 quick seared beef nigiri for you rare meat enthusiasts. Standard nigiri size, rice was seasoned in a unique way which complimented the beef. And a dish not found in many other places. 1 order limit per person 5 out of 5 (I like my beef rare). 

Cowboy roll: crab and cucumber filling with seared beef on top. Again, rice seasoned uniquely which was new and a fan of rare beef. What threw it off for me was the crab meat, but never know until you try. 4 out of 5. 

Sunset Special: shrimp tempura and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, salmon, spicy mayonnaise, and eel sauce. Had a bigger kick than expected, especially with the spicy mayonnaise. Freshness of the roll was decent. 4 out of 5

Golden Scallop: deep fried scallops, cut in half, topped with spicy mayonnaise. Fried beautifully. As a whole scallop, is a medium size. 2pieces (1 whole scallop), limit 1 order per person. 3out of 5

Now, as I mentioned earlier, the orders came rather quick and was pretty nice to get an early start. As we made our way to round two, the orders started to come a little slower. At the same time, they brought us rolls we did not order and they had forgotten a few. Towards the end of the 1hr ordering time, servers began to make themselves slightly scarce, other than to clear off plates and refilled water. Now here's what got to me. Granted we did order a few passed the 1hr mark, but there was a steady turn over so we did not over stay ourselves, but it's hard to order when the servers are not around. The manager then came over to our table with the check in hand (more or less telling us time to go) while a few in the party were still waiting on a few rolls. We asked for the desserts (ice cream or mochi ice cream) and were given some sideways glances for staying even longer. 

Big points deduction for customer service (not worth the 20%). Kudos on a variety of rolls and unique items. The freshness was great (for our party, pretty picky group) and roll were well seasoned/topped. Go for the food not the service.

There is plenty of variety to pick from the menu. I was debating on here or another location as I prefer to not order off a menu but again well worth it. We ordered a variety of nigiri, rolls, and salads. I like the fact that they have a number of rolls that have no rice but the bummer is a bunch of those rolls have tempura in them which I dont like. HOwever, everything else was fresh. They are FAST too. Only downside is the portions are very small in comparison to a regular sushi roll but that's how they portion control i guess.

After a little wait we sat at the bar. They have such a large menu it was seriously hard to choose. I over heard the guy next to us ask the chef to just make him whatever he liked. I thought it was kinda crappy that they said they'd do it, but at the cost of dinner. 
I didn't really enjoy all the rolls that we ordered. I did enjoy the Fat Ass roll. How could it be bad it was fried! The Philly roll had to much cream cheese. I really loved the fried baby octopus from the appetizer menu. The XXX roll was supposed to be super spicy, but lacked the spice I had expected. The worst roll of them all came off of the rolls with no rice, but used rice paper instead and was called the Fresh Men roll. It was covered in some pink sauce that literally made me gag. 

The service was great and our water glasses were kept filled. It seemed clean, but the backs of my calves from sitting in the chair felt itchy the whole time we sat there. Really odd!

I was hoping for another tasty sushi spot, but this place just missed the mark. I'll for sure stick to other places I know are yummy in the future. I felt very disappointed with the flavor. Meh.",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,2,1,3,Drna34sw_Po3yjW3xAxMmg

The food is consistently good. Fish is fresh. They have the high quality stuff. 
I always sit at the bar, and the sushi chefs are a lot of fun. They drink and joke around with guests. Sometimes they send special creations our way. The four chefs are Kookoo, Choochoo, Hickey, and Sponge and they have epic portrait banners behind them. It's a unique place. 

The one time I did sit at a table, the service was lacking a bit. The server seemed to avoid us.

I would say in all the times I've gone here, there's never been a wait, except for once it was 10 minutes (weird because the host didn't tell us how long to wait), and an hour and a half one super busy night (very unexpected).",90Go9OZhKs-5jpagYY8N3Q,1,2,4,af5_gowfNAb9N46w0V5MDA

It's a AYCE place, but if you want to go a la carte, I was surprised at how reasonable the prices are. It's cheaper than the average, but the quality is better than the average too! 

We decided on the AYCE though to be able to try a bunch of stuff. 

NIGIRI 

Yellowtail/Yuzu Yellowtail - this was my favorite of the items as the yellowtail was super fresh. The yuzu yellowtail has tomato and onion salsa on top which was pretty good texture. 
Mackerel - had a solid brine on it and not too salty. They put a dab of cream on it which is different from other places but I liked it. 
Garlic Tuna - the seasoning was what usually is on cajun albacore/salmon preparations and garlic ponzu. 
Scallop - these were small scallops mixed with masago. I prefer larger scallop nigiri but this good. 
Albacore/Cajun Albacore - also very fresh. 

There really wasn't any bad fish today that I tried. 

ROLLS 

I love that they have riceless rolls! They don't do half rolls here so thats the only ""bad"" thing I can think about. I tried a few pieces of my friends rolls and they were good. 

Q Roll - wasnt quite a roll but more fish tartare on a slice of cucumber, but the wasabi cream sauce on this was good. 
Tuna Naruto - Im a sucker for cucumber wrapped rolls as they are refreshing and this was no different. 

I love my ass- this was my only with rice roll order and the rice ratio was good. 

APPETIZERS 

Whos Your X Wife - this is a spicy tuna and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno. Standard, but good.

Service was friendly, but there were times that we had long waits. We sat in a booth and while we appreciated the booth dividers for privacy and so her kids wont bother the people next to us , it made it difficult to wave for a waiter since they can't see you. Im going to try to see if dinner and sitting at the sushi bar is a better experience next time.

Let's see, FANTASTIC prices on regular rolls for to go. $3 for rolls such as spicy scallop, spicy tuna, california roll, yellowtail roll etc. These rolls are normally $5.50 everywhere else.  So when I'm not up to paying for all you can eat, I load up on 4 or 5 rolls to go and only pay $15 vs $25+ for the same amnt. 

AYCE - I love that they have several rolls that don't include rice and are wrapped in cucumber. I have always enjoyed these and it's rare to find and Sushi Koma has 1 available but it's very small and you're only allowed to order 1. Here you can order it as many times as you like. 

Reverse Happy Hour after 11 pm (you only pay the lunch price of all you can eat) HELL YEA!!!  

My ONLY... complaint is their spicy tuna is made a bit differently than other places.  It's definitely not bad, I've never been sick from here or anything like that, but it does definitely taste a bit different and I'd almost say a bit more fishy tasting.  

Otherwise..

GREAT prices, menu, food/quality, and wonderful service!

I have been here several times already and I will continue to come back. 

The location is a bit tough to get to, parking is very very minimal and the restaurant is in a small plaza. but it's definitely worth it, and once you're inside, it's beautiful.

- We enjoyed everything we ordered including the stuff from the kitchen/grill.

- Place is walking distance from my home so it's my top choice for AYCE Japanese.  The same plaza contains ""Japanese Cuisine by Omae"" and has a new Thai restaurant opening.  I hope the area becomes the next Seoul Plaza.

Typical AYCE quality; previously frozen, gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality, sticky, seasoned, over compacted short grain rice.  

The nigiri rundown:  Maguro, hamachi, and salmon previously frozen, tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking), the amaebi previously frozen, sticky, ammoniated taste, beef tataki tough, tamago over cooked.

Appetizers are in line with other AYCE joints.  Bought in gyoza and shumai, mayo coated baked mussels, overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers, OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce, chewy steak, overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel, and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise, heavily coated and fried crisp).

Vegas style rolls are a disaster.  The ""dragon roll"" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet, sticky, soy concoction) and the ""Jack Pot Special"" (Oily shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab, shrimp avocado, tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more.

Fun ambiance.  Fast service at the sushi bar.  $20.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner.  There is a time limit for ordering.  It was not enforced on two visits.

But the last 3 times I've gone the owner I like is never there when I go and I end up getting below average service. I feel that I always need to get someone's attention whenever we wanted to order or needed our drinks filled. I also feel that the nigiri is now much thinner slices with a whole lot more rice.

They also have this yuzu yellowtail, which has just the perfect amount of tang. The service here is not the reason why I come back. The servers are not very interactive and they become negligent as the night goes on. They tend to forget to refill drinks or take new orders when you have already made your first order of AYCE. Also, the a la carte menu is actually very decently priced for the sushi. I went in one day and I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a la carte and I was full and satisfied. However, for future note, you cannot upgrade from a la carte to AYCE. The oysters served here are odd-tasting compared to other locations because they put the fish eggs on them (and I personally hate fish eggs LOL). Overall, the restaurant has a great selection of rolls and nigiri. This place does not offer a lot for dessert though. You can only order one mochi per person. But the ice cream here is literally the best thing here! It is so rich, creamy and buttery. One time I went with my boyfriend and friend and we had a pretty large meal of nigiri, appetizers, soups, and salads. We also ordered three mochi (green tea and mango), and my friend started out with one red bean ice cream and one vanilla ice cream. And the ice cream was so good, we ended up order a total of 2 red bean ice creams, 2 vanilla ice creams, 1 green tea ice green, and 1 chocolate ice cream (this is for three people LOL). The chocolate ice cream had little oreo bits in it and it was so delicious. Overall, great place to dine. I used to go to Goyemon and Sushi on Tropicana but this place trumps all the others by a long shot. PS. If you're going to try the wings, do NOT get the spicy or the lemon pepper one. The only good one is the garlic wings. The lemon pepper wing was too overpowering and the ""spicy"" wing had a weird ketchup sauce on it that tasted like the ""sweet n sour"" sauce for pork ribs or chicken.

Bye-bye ( _______ ).

Enter JJANGA...

The Good:

Quality of Fish! You'd think you were eating at a hip a la carte sushi joint the way the fish was so fresh.

The variety of rolls on the menu were outstanding. I'd say they have 80 different rolls in all. I recommend going with the ""non-rice rolls""...it's not filling and each comes with an awesome sauce. I think I tried 4 of them and couldn't even take a picture they were gone so fast. They are on a separate section of the menu.

Appetizers were pretty standard, the fried shrimp with crab meat I think they call it ""who's your daddy"" was good.

I told the chef named ""Koo-koo"" that I loved yellow tail nigiri with sliced jalapeno and lemon and he hooked me up with a fat plate. Perfect.

I'm usually needing extra wasabi and ginger at some point in the middle of the meal, but one thing I noticed is that I hardly used any wasabi/soy sauce and ginger throughout the entire meal...it's a credit to how good these rolls are and how well the sauce compliments them. 

They also have a Caucasian guy helping to serve the tables and help expedite along with the Asian servers which I thought was smart.

Water was always refilled and ESPN played muted behind the bar. I really can't find anything to dislike about this place. Even the Iron chef style giant posters of each chef working behind the bar were in good taste.

When they said, ""Thanks, see you tomorrow""...I actually kind of thought about it.

My boyfriend and I chose to sit at the bar. There are huge banners with pictures of each chef along with their names, which I found really charming. The head chef, who goes by ""Captain Choo Choo"", is really funny and charismatic. He went out of his way frequently during our visit to make sure we were having a great time.

The food was absolutely delicious. It was decently priced - the most expensive food items were only $8. The chefs really make sure that the food they make is up to par before they hand it to the customers. I highly recommend the Volcano roll and the Threesome special most of all!

I usually start with an order of Sake, Hamachi, and Ahi to test the waters on how fresh/enjoyable my experience will be.  Happy to say that they were offering one of the better cuts in town during my visit.  They are on par with some of the best choices around here IMO!

They also offered a couple different options to separate themselves from the competition:

I really enjoyed their Yuzu Hamachi.  The hamachi was fresh, and the yuzu was a nice compliment to the fish! Not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.

Hotategai. The scallops were delicious, and the masago was a nice consistency combination. 

Hotate Ebi Skewer. The scallop and shrimp were cooked well, and doused in a mayo like sauce. Not bad!

Calamari Ring. Good! Fairly tender, with a very soft and flavorful breading with a mellow sauce drizzled on top.

My food came out extremely quickly...because I was taking pictures of the food once it arrived, it felt a little overwhelming how fast they were coming out.  Order in SMALLER batches than you are used to when eating sushi!!

Actually, we came here twice during our short visit to Las Vegas for sushi based off a raving recommendation from a local who I trust and I have to agree that this is the top dog sushi establishment in Las Vegas and a must visit in my book from now on whenever I come to Vegas.  Excellent quality, fantastic value, and a dining experience that will leave you with wonderful memories.  *Visualize homer drooling.

Parking is plentiful, and this restaurant is easy to find.  The dinner menu and lunch menu are similarly priced so I would suggest you go with the dinner menu since it comes with some premium items that are oppa gangnam style quality and delicious and will most likely make you a fan.

Located a few minutes away from the strip (I don't recommend trying to walk here from the strip though), i will repeat my sentiment that this is THE place to come for delicious all you can eat sushi.  Their hot tea was also nice and their dessert ice cream were good as well
 Most of the waiters were cool with exception to one that my  wife didn't like very much.  They all speak English here so don't feel intimidated.  Only down side I can think of for this place is (thinking long and hard for a negative)... Well, I heard they can get really busy so this can lead to a wait for food and seats.  Otherwise a-ok USA!

4.000000000001777 stars rounded down make this one a super saiyan solid 4 glowing Yelp stars in my book.  Thank you Jjanga and keep up the good work. Have a positive day.",G6DsO7ViO-XX7_xQF4Y3OA,28,29,4,fA7s6n4rujVxXH9E0lytEw

Went in at 7pm on a Friday night, and it was slammed with a wait at the door. About 30 minutes, not bad.

Our table was really close to the table next to us, but this didn't bother me in the least. The atmosphere is really loud and fast-paced, with music going and conversation filling the whole place. People from the karaoke room even danced by in the dining area at one point. 

My 3 favorites were I love my ass, Taste like my x girlfriend, and Screaming Honey which I think is a must-try. The salmon was perfect as far as temp and texture go for a fried item. I almost didn't order it, so glad I did, because it was my favorite!

I had hot green tea and my cup was never empty :) They walked around with the teapot with perfect attention. And it was only $1! For being as busy as they were, they were well staffed, attentive, and fast. The host, waitress, food runner, and busser, and maybe another server or 2 stopped by without being intrusive to check our table and clear and refill. Very good!

Maybe we just came on an off day. The place was almost empty during prime lunch hour. It's located in a weird unsuspecting strip mall, which has a billiards place we used to visit in our dating days. Oh, the memories of our young love! Anyway...

Le sigh. Our rolls, even the hand rolls, were falling apart. The fish tasted a bit off- the salmon wasn't rich and buttery. I asked for a veggie roll, even clarified twice after he asked, and still got a veggie tempura. Everything was covered in sauce, especially eel sauce, even though there was no mention of it in the description. Normally, sushi spots are very good about listing everything in and on the roll. All of the rolls we ordered tasted the same, oddly enough. The Naruto roll was filled with so much imitation crab and so little of the other fillings that were supposed to be in it that I had to force myself to eat it. And right after that is when we left. 

The hostess and waitresses were so sweet though. And our ice teas were also delicious.

Quality:
1.) Fish Meats on Nigiris are not fresh at all. You can tell it is kept for days.
2.) Rice is not compiled correctly, loose af.
3.) Disproportion amount of rice vs. meat. It's like they are stuffing you with rice.

Customer Service:
1.) I've asked one of the employee (presuming it is the manager or owner) what is the reason for the qualities of the sushi, and in response he told me ""Idk, what do you want me to do, you want me to ask the chef out and talk to you?""
2.) The waiters and waitresses were polite, except for one of the employee's bazaar behavior.

First time I came here, I saw all of the crew, even some of the servers. Felt like home lol
Ive been back here so many times after that.

Today, I was craving for some fried rice cake but I was told they were currently out of it. Bummer! But we had the regular sushi, sashimi and rolls. Awesome as always. 

We always order fried baby squid(extra crispy). Yum-O! Sorry squidward. 

I was happy they included the age dashi tofu to their AYCE menu. Its a must for me. This and the rice cake. 

And this is the only place that caters to my extra strong ice green tea. Thank you guys. 

I tried the threesome special. It has spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab but it had me with deep fried cream cheese. Come on! Cream cheese?? And its deep fried?? Me likey! 

Now for the staffs... everyone was great as always. Nothing new there. All were attentive, nice and fast. Too bad choo choo wasn't there. He's a riot!

We were seated right away and the ambiance of the restaurant was lovely with nice decor and it was very spacious. The food itself was pretty good. I love the creative combinations of different ingredients in many of the rolls that were very flavorful. I also definitely liked the garlic tuna nigiri and highly recommend it. However, the service was awful. Our server was nice, but the first strike was when she told us we couldn't order anymore surf clam because apparently 4 orders was the limit, but that seemed like an arbitrary decision because no where on the menu did it say there were limits on certain items. The second strike is the lack of service throughout because it took so long for her to come back to us to take our orders and the wait became longer after every order, and we didn't even order frequently. The final strike was when we ordered a single item (I forgot what it was), and had been waiting for it for probably 10 minutes to be informed that they had it, but it was going to take a long time to cook it and we politely understood. Another 10 minutes later, we started to become skeptical of why it took that long, then another server informs us that it's actually ""MIA"" and that they actually don't have the ingredients for it, so they pretty much lied to us about it and were bold enough to think we'd believe them. So considering all the strikes, that's when we were pretty sure that they didn't want to serve us anymore because they probably thought we ordered too much or maybe because they thought we were sharing with some of my family members who had a la carte. It was just an awful experience of feeling like they wanted us to stop ordering and just leave because we ""exceeded"" the cost and they were probably losing money so they felt as if they had to solve it by trying to avoid us.",GzFwOScz1yTkoQWxlxI2hw,0,0,1,KfB-VnTfEW9ZqiOAVpNu6A

I can't say that service is perfect all the time, as I've had Goldilocks variations all three times (one time was so-so, one time was bad, the most recent time was great). 

I feel like it's quite affordable for what you get, considering the rolls aren't ever extra small or oddly sized.

Sometimes you'll get complimentary rolls and soju. I was very fond of the grapefruit soju, I think it was sparkling as well. It was highly unlikely I would have ordered it, but now that I've tried it, I would consider it again sometime. 

Our favorite rolls are the spicy ones: mexican roll and BYA. My favorite nigiri is garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail. We weren't a fan of the no-rice rolls, which sound like a great idea at first, but the flavors weren't outstanding.

Their nigiri is always so fresh and their rolls are really unique. (My favorite is the threesome special and the choo choo special--off the menu!) The servers are always friendly, and even when I don't finish all my food, they NEVER charge me lol. 

There was actually one time my cousin and I had to tap out with probably a good 2 and a half rolls left. We were expecting to be charged for the leftovers, which we were fine with, but we decided to still order our dessert anyway lol. So we stopped our waiter to try and order some ice cream but he saw our leftovers and was like ""Sorry guys, there's just so many leftover pieces, we aren't allowed to give ice cream."" But we totally understood, considering how much food was still on the table. But 5 minutes later he came back with bowls of ice cream for everyone and said, ""I felt really bad telling you guys no, so I just brought you guys ice cream anyway."" AND we weren't charged for the leftovers lol. So coming from a personal experience, I can definitely say that the service is impeccable lol.

I'm giving them a 4 not a 5 though because I feel like they could add more to their dessert menu lol but that's just me. I'd give them a 4 1/2 if I could, but I can't. Sorry Jjanga lol.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,3,3,4,dw7a1_FT0wCka0r-mS6nPw

Nigiri:
We tried a bunch of nigiri: salmon, garlic tuna, amaebi, surf clam, Cajun albacore, super white and hamachi. Fresh fish and properly-cooked rice. Beef tataki was awesome! 5/5

Salmon Skin Roll:
Crispy salmon skin, right amount of eel sauce. 5/5

Screaming Orgasm and Sashimi Salad:
These items are only offered during dinner. The sauce is not a lot and is just enough to coat the fish. 4/5

Beef Steak and Pork Steak:
The beef steak is served on a sizzling plate but the flavor is lacking. There's nothing special about it. The pork steak was fatty and pretty tasty. 3/5

Shrimp Tempura:
Comes in 3 pieces per order. The sauce was ok but the shrimp didn't seem fresh and the batter was a but saltier than normal. 3/5

Agedashi Tofu:
The tofu is served lightly battered and fried and the sauce is good. 4/5

Uni:
They originally told us they were out of uni. But a few minutes later, we got a small bowl of uni. It is quite fresh. 4/5

French Fries:
I love fries so I got excited when I saw this on the menu. I had to have it. Their fries were just alright. It lacks flavor and seems hollow inside. 3/5

What's nice is they offer brown rice. Their lunch AYCE is $21 and dinner is $26 so, it's not bad. The service is good. They gave our food to the next table and vice versa but it's no biggie.

This place is rather new so I'm not surprised their sushi is fresh and they have a good rice to fish ratio. It would be interesting to come back here after a few months to see if they'd be consistent since most sushi places in Vegas start out good but as months go by, quality and service declines.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,6,4,N1TzYltcfvqYruelabh2Vw
5320616,2016-01-13,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Now I don't normally deduct stars from a restaurant based solely on horrible service because lets face it--- it's usually a hit or miss when it comes to getting a good/bad server. I don't believe good service necessarily reflects on the overall quality of food in a restaurant, which is ultimately what truly matters. However, my experience at JJanga this past weekend was SO horrible that I had to deduct a star from its otherwise 4 star rating...

TO JJANGA MANAGEMENT: FIND YOURSELF BETTER SERVERS THAT KNOW HOW TO BE POLITE TO GUESTS, NOT RUDE! 

It was my birthday and I went with my boyfriend around 4:30PM to celebrate.The restaurant wasn't busy at this time but because there was only one sushi chef working, our food took about 15-20 minutes to come out PER DISH, ITEM BY ITEM. Since the AYCE portions were very small, we finished each dish within a few minutes and had to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next dish. It was very annoying to have such a long wait time in between dishes, especially since everything was bite size. The girl that served us had a serious staring problem. I'm not the type of person to make assumptions about someone I don't know, but I swear the way she full on stared/glared at me while taking my order made me feel like she was inspecting every pore and blemish on my face. It was beyond uncomfortable and made me feel like she was judging me on a personal level, instead of being a professional server. Never once did she smile or speak a full sentence to me. She was so unwelcoming that I actually felt awkward and hesitant to order from her. To make matters worse, she only made direct eye contact with my boyfriend. At one point, my normally unobservant boyfriend even made a comment to me about her staring issues. When she did speak, I noticed that she wasn't fluent in English, which is completely fine. But seriously? As a server you should at least have some type of communication skill. Being shy and non-responsive is NOT the right attitude for the hospitality industry. How hard was it to just happily take an order? It wasn't like we were complaining about her service then and there. We walked in and immediately she eyed me up and down like I was some B*** she wanted to cat fight at the club -_-. I've had bad service before but never downright rude service like this.

That aside, when the food did mange to come out most items were decent. The quality of fish was fresh albeit the portion was extremely small, even for AYCE sizes. We're talking about 1 piece of agedashi tofu, 2 pieces of gyoza, 2 pieces of fried scallops, etc.. all of that equate to literally 2 bites for each portion. As employees of Japanese restaurants on and off the strip, we were very annoyed with the way the sushi chef made the nigiris. The rice kept falling apart when we tried to pick it up. It was so poorly made that the rice would crumble into the soy sauce dish, causing us to eat the fish separate from the rice that was drench inside of soy sauce. Anyone that is a sushi chef or works in an upscale Japanese restaurant can tell you, crumbling rice is a big no no. 

Overall, this was my second time dining at JJanga. The first time was during their grand opening. I remember service being poor back then as well, but I figured it was because they had just opened and were training their servers. Sadly, the second time around after this establishment has expanded to two locations, I realize that nothing has improved. 

Most likely I won't be going back any time soon.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,0,0,3,uYzLZhivl7ZyOz6jx-eHZw

Everything else is ruined mostly by the short-tempered chef.  He raised his voice, gestured, and gave dirty looks to all the servers.  When you treat the people who work for you like garbage - it's a clear reflection of how you think of yourself, how you treat your food and business.  These poor servers walked away from this idiot with tears in their eyes several times.  Not only the turn over will be high, but their dedication to the boss, the chef, the business, and the clients will be destroyed.  Shame on this chef for having no control on his emotions. Shame on him for embarrassing his staff in front of customers.  I'm never coming back because people like this rarely change at that age.  It may be a cultural thing and I get that.  I'm a foreigner too. But we are in America now. Grow the hell up and learn the rules and how to control your temper.  Sexist too. Mostly was rude to female servers and not the male.  So old-world.  Such a bad vibe.  Terrible.  I thank all the servers from the bottom of my heart for their hard work.  And remember - ITS NOT YOU.  ITS HIM!
About food.....  The Uni was old and bad.  Most pieces of raw fish were tiny.  Cooked meats were overlooked.  Rolls represent Japanese cuisine and culture in a horrible light.

My friends and I came to this location for dinner one night a while back. We usually go to Goyemon for dinner but we decided to try this place cause it was my co-worker's favorite place to eat sushi at. Jjanga seems to be quite popular since there were a lot of people waiting to get seated. We waited for a bit before we got our table. 

Four of us opted in for their AYCE (all you can eat) option while my boyfriend decided to go a la carte. When my friends and I go into an AYCE sushi joint, we just go all out and start off with 10 orders of salmon, cajun albacore, yellowtail...and then 5 orders of everything else we like to eat. HOWEVER, the server told us that it would be smarter to reduce our orders so it'll come out faster. HUH? Large orders apparently slow them down. It made absolute zero sense to us seeing as if you're cutting a piece of fish for five orders then it wouldn't take that much longer to be cutting the same piece of fish for ten orders. Well, whatever. We did as the server suggested. 

The food took forever to get out to the table. 

They also lost half of our orders. Half of our orders never came. Half of the orders that we already reduced to the server's liking. 

As for the fish itself ... it was quite lacking. The flavors seem very very mild compared to what I'm used to. I might as well be eating rice. 

We also had 2-3 orders of uni (sea urchin) to give it a try and well, it was possibly the worse uni I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was mighty bitter. I was a little worried. I told our server that it was bitter and she just looked confused. She left saying that she was going to tell the chefs but never took the uni away. I had to get someone else to take it away. 

It also took ages for them to bring us the check. They also didn't give us a stamp card (loyalty card - every 10 ayce, you get 1 free I think.) Therefore, at the end of it all, I don't think I'll come back ever again. I don't like the service, I don't like the bitter seafood, and I don't appreciate flavorless fish.

I had the opportunity to celebrate a friend's birthday here, and truly had a blast. As it turns out, they have separate, private karaoke rooms were groups of 6 or more can have their private gatherings and enjoy some bomb food. Best part? They had no issues charging us separately for our convenience. A BIG plus there.

So why 5 starts? Here is why:

* Service: GREAT! The servers were incredibly efficient and were constantly checking up on us. Despite being almost 30 of us, the two servers were calm, collected, and ALWAYS had a smile on their face. I felt welcomed and catered to, the entire evening.

* Food- Delicious and fresh. The rolls for the AYCE are a bit small, but I actually like that because I was able to try a variety of different rolls and flavors. Every single dish I tried was yummy and had a distinct flavor profile

* Speed- I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the food arriving within minutes of everyone ordering. The food arrived beautifully presented, so despite the large amount of orders, the kitchen did NOT get sloppy. Kudos to the entire team.

* Accuracy- This is where the miss the mark a little bit. A few of us were missing some of the dishes we ordered, and some of the food that was supposed to be hot (like my shrimp tempura) was more on the warm side. However, given the size of the party, this was NOT the end of the world. Despite missing a couple of items I ordered, the awesome food and service more than made up for it. I was originally going to take away one star for this, but that would be too harsh.

Very impressed with the freshness, the speed of service, and the variety offered for the AYCE.  Tried a couple of the no rice rolls, the cucumber wrap made it difficult for the roll to hold together, but the freshness and crisp nature really went well with the other flavors in the rolls.

Though I saw 4 sushi chefs at the bar when I came in, Sponge was doing almost all the preparation, that might slow things down a bit on a real busy day, but for the most part I was getting plates before the prior plate was finished

Naturally you're probably too lazy or disinterested to do it but hopefully my point will get across either way.   Do a search for ""Sushi"" on Yelp and look at the results.   Go pages deep.  Nearly all of them garnering 3.5-5 stars.  Wow, Vegas sure does have a lot of AMAZING Sushi restaurants doesn't it?   Either that or there are a lot of people who love Sushi no matter where they get it and generally have a very pleasant experience each and every time they have it.  Having talked to several friends and co-workers in which I believe this is the case, I've decided to implement a rule by which I will no longer go by high Yelp ratings for Sushi restaurants.   I get it, Sushi is delicious, but when I see a 4 and a half star average on a place I expect it to be unique in some sense and not simply another standard AYCE Sushi option, which is exactly how I found JJANGA to be.

This is by no means my way of saying JJANGA was bad.  Far from it   I went here for a co-worker's ""going away"" party, and we sat at the Sushi Bar.   Ricky was our sushi chef, and even though he was admittedly slow to start (it took a while before our sushi orders started landing in front of us), he was very pleasant and made our dining experience a fun one.   I wasn't extremely impressed with the Sushi, but I also wasn't disappointed.   JJANGA's AYCE menu reminded me most of ""I Love Sushi""'s, with several sharing the same name.   Ricky confirmed that either some of the chefs or the owners came from ""I Love Sushi"".   Now I can go either way on Sushi:  on the one hand I like eating Nigiri where the freshness of the fish is going to really stand out, and on the other I also don't mind eating insane concoctions that are the specialty at places like this where fish plays second fiddle the the other components and sauces.   So we had our share of Nigiri and on the other side, rolls like ""Sexy Time"" and ""I love my ass"",   Everything was fine, but nothing really stood out to me as a reason to choose JJANGA over any other Sushi restaurant in town.   Okay I take that back, I decided I simply had to try to ""Bacon Roll"" because curiosity got the best of me.   I actually found it to be delicious as it tasted exactly as you or I would expect it to.  

I do love saying the name of the restaurant though, which almost had me bump it up to a 4.   But then the entire point from the first paragraph would sort of be moot.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,2,3,e8b4VkqHKMJL7350mRbhmA

We were referred to another ayce sushi place, but after reading reviews that place and food poisoning, we opted for something else. I yelped it and found this place. Food was dished/staged really well, servers were really nice and everything tasted great. They have an extensive ayce menu which can be overwhelming when you first see it, but who can complain about having choices right? We probably could have saved a few bucks and a few calories by opting for a la carte, but it's hard to make that decision when you're super hungry.

My advice? If you're not that hungry and usually get full off one roll or even two, go for a la carte. If you can put it down, opt for the ayce. My only gripe is that the kids ayce price is half the price of the adults meal, even though they don't even eat that much! I know it's standard fare, but I say reduce prices for kids!",L8UG1hRtsVZ62cYBzwJDFw,0,0,5,b-XpTG-KvTK3TsIR1EiVSA

5432728,2014-12-24,0,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"Jjanga is a fantastic discovery. Wonderful food and more importantly, excellent service. For comparison, my father and I were in the mood for sushi, so we made a reservation at Jjanga in Chinatown, and a certain pan-Asian bistro, at a Forbes Five Star property, on Las Vegas Boulevard. Both reservations were made online and both noted my father's nut allergy. The following morning, Jjanga sent us a personal email, thanking us for the reservation, expressing their pleasure in our choosing to dine with them, and what items on the menu contained nuts. I replied to this email, a short thank you of sorts, and even received a personal confirmation for this. The restaurant on the Forbes Five Star property made no such connection, genuine sense of interest, or anticipatory service. At that point, we completely cancelled our reservation with the bistro on Las Vegas Boulevard and committed to Jjanga. Once your inside, such attentive service continues. Our waitress essentially greeted us at our table, immediately took our drink orders, and visited us several times. We were not a special party though, we could see her and the rest of the wait staff constantly running about the venue, never once stopping. 

Regarding the cuisine, some may say that the sushi menu lacks diversity. I guess that is true in regards to the specific kinds of fish served, but the combinations and pairings of ingredients create a hearty and fruitful selection. Jjanga even seems to acknowledge this limitation, for it does not offer specifically sashimi options on the menu, instead dedicating space to rolls, non-rice rolls, and unique creations. A true mark of culinary skill is working around a boundary with apparent ease. Before reading the other reviews, I had forgotten the lack of strictly sashimi options. Who cares? For a traditional Japanese sushi joint in - let's remember - the God damn desert, my palate was excellently entertained.

As my father said in regards to the atmosphere, Jjanga ""lacks pretension."" Jjanga is dedicated to the food and service, without being too serious for sushi novices and out-of-state visitors. Everyone is welcome and appreciated, and the decor reflects that in a playful yet tasteful following of Vegas's themed design, which offers several seating options that can feel more private and intimate. It says, ""We know you're here to have fun, so here's something just a taste kitsch, but properly cozy too.""

Jjanga is a place for locals as well as vistors, so casual attire is most appropriate. That said, if you're travelling from the Boulevard, to taste something authentic and a little warmer, maybe show the respect to put on a jacket and some nice shoes like you would have at a comparable place at a hotel-casino. Jjanga maybe be more casual than some of those options, but it's still a class act that can compete with any Boulevard venue.",PpsmH1XAjxcLkTRPD9GqBw,0,0,5,wmMmcoNURoJkdvfa__oaIA

But lo and behold, this places deserves all five stars.

It's a really new place. It opened on February 1st. We went there literally 2 weeks after its opening. The place was completely empty during lunch. Because they were pretty empty, we got to talk to the server and the sushi chef the entire time. According to them, the night before (February 14), it was packed and there was a full 1 and 1/2 hour wait. That's great for a new restaurant!

The sushi chef, Captain Choo Choo, was really nice and friendly. The staff seems very laid back and fun. They made some recommendations on the fish and rolls to try, one of which was the saba (mackarel), which can really be super fishy at some places. Fortunately, it was actually really delicious here. It was flavorful without having that extremely fishy after taste. I was definitely impressed with that choice.

All of the nigiri that we ordered had fresh, delicious fish. None of them left a bad taste in my mouth. Some memorable ones were the halibut and the yuzu yellowtail. Both of them had light sauce, which didn't overpower the light flavors of the fish.

They also have sushi burritos, which have gained popularity since it popped up in norcal. I ordered the monkey burrito, These sushi burrito options usually come with tempura shrimp, some sort of raw fish, rice, and a soy paper wrap. It was definitely a big portion, but it was delicious!

Unfortunately at lunch, they don't offer the full menu, so we couldn't try the steak, uni (sea urchin), ebi (sweet shrimp), sashimi options, and the mochi ice cream. 

All in all, it's one of my favorite ayce sushi places. I think it tops Goyemon, at least for their lunch. They were nice enough to give us stamp cards even though we're from out of town, so we'll definitely be back soon!",qJgae_Bqpwx1qm8-bXA_cA,5,5,5,15pQm32XAWpJYBs4sbdXrw

We have been here many times and I have yet to have a bum meal.  Service can differ from lunch to dinner but, that is the added human factor with eating out.  But, I would say that service has been pretty solid at night.  Scott, Janga and the rest of the night crew make it, not only a feast, but a good time.  I have never been to a place where the owner comes out and celebrates with his customers.  They treat the young ones incredibly as well.  They bring out a huge treasure chest for them to choose little toys from, a separate menu for those who are picky, and cute little plates to eat from.

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

""Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side.""

As you can see, they used the whole ""I Love Sushi"" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

Just the variations and range of selection alone makes it a top choice. Everything was SO tasty except for maybe one tuna roll that was a little more fishy than I prefer. It didn't have a sauce with it so either the tuna wasn't as fresh as it should be or I'm used to rolls being covered with sauce to mask any fishiness. I always try a roll without dipping in soy or wasabi to taste it as it should be. I can say that all except for that one needed nothing additional, flavorful in their own right. However, their wasabi is fresh and legit. A little goes a long way, not like that genetic weak wasabi crap. Ambiance is comfortable and zen-ish. Service is good, fun, and friendly.

As AYCE places go, this is one of the better ones I have sampled. FIrst off, if you don't want AYCE their prices are pretty reasonable and you can have three special rolls for the same price as AYCE.  If you like simpler sushi/sashimi you can have up to 5 rolls.  

The fish is very fresh and they have a lot of creative rolls.  The crab ball appetizer is excellent.  I was able to try the jackpot, grand canyon, golden scallop, crab roll, volcano, cowboy, and more.  Many of their special rolls are soft shell crab based which is not my favorite.  The menu, although with plenty of choices, seems to lean heavily in the tuna, salmon and crab arenas.  We received a sample of the salmon belly which was good.

The staff is very friendly and even has a box of toys for the kids so my daughter had a good time. She really enjoyed the Mel's roll, having three of them, and the crab balls.  There are several kids options on the menu yet surprisingly, none of them include sushi which was a bit disappointing.

The special rolls are named with risque themes so be prepared to answer questions from your child if you bring him or her.

Another amazing feature of Jjanga is the service. Waiters are constantly moving around, checking on drinks, taking away empty plates, and the energy here is so fun! Its one of the best services I've experienced in awhile.

The cool part is that the entire group does not have to order all you can eat, but the person eating a la cart cannot eat share food from people doing all you can eat. The menu is very extensive..I wish I had more people with me when I visited this place. I stuck to the nigiri especially the salmon, albacore, and yellowtail. There was also baked mussels which were pretty good and tried out the seaweed. You can also order dessert from the all you can eat menu and I got the green tea ice cream (yum).

Overall not bad for the price you pay at an all you can eat sushi. The service though was painfully slow. I felt like I had to order in big batches to makes sure I got everything in time. I would suggest that if you come to visit that you're not rushing because then you can't enjoy the food as much!

Looking over the menu, I was so happy to see that they offered my favorite, the Lion Roll, which I've only found at one other sushi place in Henderson.  It turns out that the chefs at Jjanga (not that game Jenga) used to work at that Hendo joint, so now I don't have to go all that way to get my fix.  This place is new and was not that busy, which was just fine with us on this Hallmark holiday-no waiting for a table.  Very nice modern decor with wood accenting and quite roomy, this place doesn't feel like your traditional sushi restaurant.  Jung, our waiter du jour, was very friendly and attentive, making sure he answered any questions we had and kept the food and drinks coming.
In addition to the Lion Roll, I liked the pumpkin soup, the Johnny Roll, and dessert, of course. Jjanga had a  Valentine's Day special: fried banana with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce, a sweet ending to a great V Day meal. Jung even took our  picture with some new-fangled Polaroid type camera so they could hang our photo on one of the walls, posted with those of other customers. We got one to keep, as well.

We had Hamachi, that was the ugliest color and tasted so HORRIBLE!  It did not look like your typical Buttery Hamachi.  The other Nigiri was just All Right! Nothing special and tasted a bit dated but not too much. 

We had AYCE and the Side Items they serve.... #1 the Mussels... Good Quality but FLAVOR FREE.  They had absolutely no flavor what so ever despite their desperate attempt to put some sort of Teriyaki Mayo combination on them.  Just give me steamed Mussels then. 

Golden Scallop... This title suggested a Seared Scallop , cooked to perfection. Not some Frozen Food, Deep Fried Scallop that was so dry it was Laughable. 

The Crab Balls,  DISGUSTING.. All this is , is the inside mixture of a California roll, Minus the Avocado and Minus the Cucumber Deep Fried in a Tempura Batter topped with a Yum Yum Sauce.

Did I mention they use Korean Seaweed Paper in lieu of the traditional Japanese Nori which tastes horrid with sushi. 

I am Korean and appreciate all things asian however this place sucks. Service is wack, they are all cute and nice with their greetings like any other thrown together Sushi fad but that is the extent of it.

The Dinner AYCE is $25.95, I'm pretty impressed with the quality of fish here. I primarily do all nigiri nowadays and avoid the rolls but the roll selection is pretty vast. The nigiri I got mostly was the salmon, I love salmon nigiri and it has become my favorite the quality of Salmon here was great.. the fat content made it seem more like a salmon belly cut, I loved it (got about 10 orders of it). I also had the garlic tuna which seemed super fresh as well and had a nice subtle citrus flavor which was light and flavorful.. also got some Cajun albacore which I am a big fan of as well, the Cajun Alb here had just a little too much citrus flavor in it, it wasn't bad but for a true Cajun Alb fan it didn't match up to my previous euphoric Cajun albacore experiences.. my girlfriend got a couple rolls, all of which were good and like I said the selection is vast!

I've had good service here every time I came here so I can't complain about that. The servers are usually good at recommendations when it's your first time here. 

I'm a nigiri type of person. I'm very picky when it comes to quality and the amount of rice in each one. The garlic tuna and super white is a must have when it comes to nigiri here. It completely melts in your mouth. 

You know how some sushi places put a crap load of rice in their rolls? Well, the rolls here are just right. Perfect amount of rice in each roll and the quality of the fish is simply amazing. I usually order the something wrong #69 and let me tell you, it's completely out of this world. For all you Japanese lasagna fans, you must go here. Cream cheese inside and out. Enough said. 

Last but not least, don't forget to request the choo choo special! It's not on the menu, but it's an absolute favorite.

1 star off because at the time of our visit, they weren't serving any alcohols :(. You can't have sushi without sake??? Or at least BEER?!!! ... We ate our sushi with water :( (already had enough soda for the time being) plus it's VEGAS, that's like alchy central.. It's ok I guess next time ..? Maybe..

2nd star off because.. well, I'm sure our waitress ment well.. Maybe she was new?.. But we felt pressured to order off the menu on her time.. Soo RUSHED, literally not even 5 mins to sit and look over the menu and she came back more than twice to ask if we were ready to order lol. Ok, girly.. Calm down LOL.

Wow, what a great experience we had, the restaurant was busy and lively, however we were sat immediately. It is a cute restaurant that is super comfortable and cozy, I enjoyed the atmosphere. 

We did AYCE, and were super pleased with our selection of rolls. We took two suggestions on rolls from our server and she did us proud because those sushi rolls were Amazing!

I am so excited, I have a fantastic sushi restaurant so close to my house, I will be back for sure!

The two of us ordered 11 rolls and some appetizers we just split everything it was so delicious. 

I highly recommend AYCE, here because the menu is quite impressive, if you are into sushi you will love it here. I liked how the rolls were less rice and more fresh product so we could try several rolls without being stuffed from rice overkill. Their sauces are delicious, the ginger sauce, screaming orgasm sauce, yum yum sauce etc, were on point depending on the roll selection.

They were on point with clearing empty dishes and keeping our drink glasses full of iced tea and water!

When I say that I mean that the sushi comes out perfectly seasoned and there is no  need to ad soy or wasabi, unless it is a matter of preference.
This restaurant came very close to being my first five star restaurant but the kitchen items were only mediocre.  The tempura was a little greasy and undercooked, but I was really there for the sushi and it was EXCELLENT.

Getting to the place seems pretty sketch and a little hard to find, but trust me that the find is definitely worth it !!!! The restaurant is so modern looking and really nice. I like how they have the paper lanterns placed around the restaurant. I guess you could say the ambiance is really nice (:

Went there for the dinner AYCE and I was definitely not disappointed ! Everything was super super super yummy ! I really enjoyed the Spicy Garlic Edamame ! It's a must try bcs it's something different than the usual plain salted ones. Also for appetizers, their seaweed salad is very fresh and yummy (: and I'm so happy they have FRIES ! Bcs I'm a fry addict, although I did not have the chance to taste theirs. & definitely try out their meat appetizer selection bcs it's very tender and juicy ! I love MEAT ! 

Going into the rolls ! BACON BACON BACON ! It definitely stood out, their bacon roll. I was a little skeptical bcs it said ""fruit sauce"" but don't be hesitant !!!!! ORDER IT ! It's very light sauce and soooo delicious ! Everything just compliments each other ! It's so perfect, especially for those adventurous people out there. My favorites included the Tuna Naruto ! It's really refreshing ! And does not have that over powering cucumber taste that I know may throw off some guests. And it's also cool how they have sushi burritos !!!! They are very unique to the menu, but it was just like a normal roll. I did enjoy the sauce though.

The best part of the night was the EXCELLENT SERVICE ! Definitely top-notch Grade AAAAA++++ service in any sushi restaurant I have ever been to (and I have been to plenty) ! JayJay (or JJ) was the best host there & he even sang to us, which was pretty great and random. Everyone is really friendly and fun ! & most important, well attentive and available when needed ! 

The only reason for not having 5 stars would be that there are ZERO pics of how their sushi would look like before you order ): it's like a surprise in a box & I had to refer to trusty ol' yelp to give me a sneak preview. And also, I had one roll that the fish was not as fresh as could be & also in my poke salad, one fish piece was not that super fresh either. 

But I WILL DEFINITELY RETURN ! They have stamp cards & this is probably my top favorite sushi place in Vegas at the moment (: even above the beloved Goyemon and my other fav Yama sushi.

5993741,2016-03-25,2,6tSvz_21BMo3a4GaItwa0g,"We took a visiting family member out tonight and opted for AYCE sushi which landed us an Jjanga. We opted for the AYCE dinner, which was $25.95 per person. There was also a happy hour option that was a few bucks cheaper, but excluded most of the specialty items. For me, when it comes to sushi it's all about the rice. Call me picky, but when rice isn't the right amount of sticky and falling out of my rolls...well, it kinda drives me crazy. This wasn't the case here, so that was definitely a plus. We ordered a few rolls to start out, and none of them were special. I won't even begin to talk about their names. All in all, they were all just bland, even though they were drenched in sauce. 

We figured some saki and beer could make things more enjoyable, and while looking around for our server noticed a sign in the center of the restaurant stating that alcohol was not being served. That was a huge disappointment because we were unaware, uninformed, and at that point it was already too late to leave. We attempted to question our server about it, but she just brushed it off, and so did we. At that point, we really had no choice. Moving along, we decided to make the best of it and ordered a variety of other items. Our favorites being the tofu, garlic edamame, crab balls, and golden scallops. Everything else was again, just okay. 

Not long after we requested our check, and requested ice cream and mochi for our desert as we waited. The check came in 2 seconds, and fifteen minutes later there was still no ice cream. So, we flagged a server down and told her not to worry about our desert, and got up to leave. Overall, this was not the best AYCE experience we have had, but it also wasn't the worst. We were hoping for a more enjoyable, alcoholic version of AYCE sushi dinner for our guest and unfortunately things just didn't work in our favor. Perhaps better luck next time...well, if we ever decide to make the drive across town again and give it a go.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,4,2,3,YI8fN985aVk1SZXOVN1HTQ
