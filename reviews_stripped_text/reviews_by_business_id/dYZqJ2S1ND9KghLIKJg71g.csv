My food is always piping hot and fresher than I would expect for this type of joint.  Their green chile pork and carnitas (plate, burrito, taco, whatever) are the best items here.  The carne asada is okay, and the pozole is passable.

All in all I wouldn't make a special trip but if you live in the neighborhood and want some good, fast, drive thru Mexican food there is NO reason to go to Roberto's.",5v-aMWCpiJ-nroqk88J_qA,1,0,4,b07GFH8-it33N4Qi2DCy7Q

I would recommend take out though, it's small and warm inside. Chile verde and camarones empanizados are the best menu items for lunch and breakfast is all great. It's really good fast food!",-8ihQmzN_Pg_EpPl6B0VEA,0,0,4,MU5fOGpCeyFit6l8Xn4vkg

LV natives know the difference between authentic and 'americanized' Mexican food. Every time I eat here I thank the good lord that our neighbors to the south have brought there awesome cuisine to our region. I like to get nachos with chile verde or pastor. The carne asada is muy bueno. The service is great if you yourself are friendly.  Brink your own beer if you like. If you don't have a sophisticated pallet or think Mexican food is only about tacos, there are other places. For those who live in Central Las Vegas, we know the best kept secret for Mexican food.Tacos El Burrito Loco

The burritos are reasonably priced and incredibly filling and the combination plates are fine. DO make sure you ask for sauces or salsa on take-out orders as they don't have a salsa bar.

The TV is always turned to a Mexican station (understandable) and the clientele is mostly Mexican (something good to see in a Mexican restaurant).",-p-Qe_jobupkuNX61Mx5sg,0,0,4,HjXOrADExTXLUHnKXs8Bbg

2318516,2016-11-10,2,dYZqJ2S1ND9KghLIKJg71g,"Small place I always pass but always forget to try. 

I ordered the Al Pastor burrito. No one in front of me and time of service was fast. I love when places wrap a burrito in aluminum foil because that keeps it warm while you are bringing it home. Couple of good things off the bat. 

But...I couldn't wait to try. 

It was a good sized burrito. Not too big and not too small. Full of meat. It was just a tad bit on the bland side but they automatically give two salsas so not really a big deal. I used to run a taco shop in La Jolla and I know that recipes can often times change the need of spices and seasoning. Although, I do like a more rich flavor than most which might be more than other people's taste. But, like I said, there's salsas automatically added so it's not like you have to feel cheap for asking for more. And, it's always better to have a dish that you can add the amount of flavor you want rather than having too much. So, not exactly a bad thing that it was a little bland. I actually like that better thinking about it. Price was justified. It was 6 bucks so pretty good actually. 

Overall was really impressed. Tasty. Fast. Fair Value. And a couple little things that make me definitely want to try other items on the menu. I will be back.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,2,2,5,4S6sUQ7Dof82kApg6eqz2A

The changes all of a sudden included raised prices on all their items, no more chips and salsa, no more free refills on soda, smaller portions, lower quality and a entirely new staff.

You used to have to fight to get a table at this tiny place for lunch, and on this day, my friend and I were the only people in the entire place from 12-1pm on a Friday. Not a good sign.

I hope things turn around, as I've really enjoyed this establishment for many years, but  don't think they're going to make it at this rate.",M3LtMsujUkpZF8U8p130sA,1,0,1,-4BbBigqAKNOJFITXPW2mg

4764568,2015-12-12,2,dYZqJ2S1ND9KghLIKJg71g,"I didn't enjoy my experience at all. I just left and I feel disgusted. I'm still hungry and I feel sick to my stomach. For the record, the food was less than average and the atmosphere was uninviting. I was so excited to try this place, but now I'm regretting it 1000%.

I ordered 2 Large Shrimp Tacos, 2 Small Chicken Tacos, 2 Small Steak Tacos, 1 WET Steak Burrito, 1 Chicken Nacho and 1 Chimichangas, which came with rice and beans.

Let me mention, I had a voucher that took $15 off my total. I asked the cashier if we would get chips and salsa while waiting for our food. The lady told me, ""Chips and Salsa are only for customers who eat there."" I told her that we were eating there. She then said, ""No, customers who order, maybe a Cnchiladas Combo and they're waiting for their food."" She then said, ""you're already getting a good deal."" I told her that I had to pay for the voucher, so it's not like i'm getting over. She said, ""oh, I know, but it's still a good deal."" I have to admit, I was upset, she wasn't treating us like an equal, just because I was getting a discount.

Either way, it took like 15 minutes for us to get our food. They bagged it all To-Go as if we couldn't eat there. We politely, picked a seat and sat down. We un-bagged all of our food and started taking pictures and eating. Let me mention, no one ever came over and asked if we needed anything or offered water or anything.

I started on the chicken nachos. I noticed that the chicken meat was in a food warmer, and I guess the warmer wasn't doing its job, because the chicken wasn't warm, at all. The chicken was really cold and the nachos were dry. They didn't have enough cheese or anything. I ate a lot of them, simply because I didn't want to waste food or money.

The Shrimp Tacos were average. Nothing special there. The Chicken and Steak Tacos were all below average. The chicken, again, was cold. The steak was warmer but it just did't taste like Steak. The shells were also disgusting.

The WET Steak burrito was probably the best thing we ordered. I ate half of it before I got sick. I believe the sauce massed the flavor of the actually burrito. I really just tasted sauce, but the sauce tasted better than everything else.

I didn't get a chance to taste the Chimichanga Combo, because I was already sick to my stomach. I'm not sure if the cold food that caused it or the fact that nothing tasted like real food. It may have been when I thought about the fact that the cook doesn't wear gloves and he also has full conversations over food. Either way, I was sick and we left.

My friend and I both agreed that we will not be going back.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,1,1,sv3g6bXmGkhoeoyfWVX5Hw
