This location is unsanitary, I arrived at 11am not open, two employees were sitting on the steps waiting for someone with a key. All the sudden 6 total employees show up to start work. I walk in they are taking down chairs & setting up the food station. None of them wash their hands. Nobody greets me or says it'll be a bit of a wait to get set up. At 11:15 I finally ask when are they going to be open. The girl says we're open now...again I had to ask. Then she throws on a glove & I comment that she needs  to wash her hands she said "" I'm wearing a glove"". Basically both girls used their filthy hands to set up all the food & & fill the new containers with yesterday's food & then wanted to make my bowl with filthy unsanitary hands, that hadn't been washed since they arrived. Finally she washes her hands & gets me a new bowl to start. Being already 11:20am I'd been waiting 20 mins, I'd have to wait even longer for avocado. I was done. I'm never going to this location again even though it's 5 mins from my house. Plenty of poke places to choose from.

1340230,2017-11-22,0,LWgaRojEN8a-V6yxORo7yQ,"First time trying Poke Poku and they make it relatively simple to place an order by guiding you through the process. Now I do have a seafood raw meat allergy but I really want to try a poke bowl. So I ask if they offer any vegetarian options. And they do! The way it's setup is to first select the size of your order. I went for a small bowl ($9.50) and chose brown rice. On top of brown rice, I ask for seaweed salad, mashed avocado and leafy greens. Then I skip ahead, pass the seafood protein and went straight for the veggie toppings. 

This next step is where they use a separate bowl to mix in a selection of toppings of your choice with a savory sauce. In my bowl I have sliced cucumbers, red onions, diced tomatoes, daikon (yellow pickled radish), tofu and cilantro. There are 12 different Mix-in Sauce. I chose the Maui Style which has yuzu ponzu, sesame sauce and shichimi (a seven flavor Japanese spice mixture). 

Next are the unlimited toppings: crispy fried onion, fried garlic, seaweed, bonito flakes (which is a slightly salty, wood-like dried shavings of smoked skipjack tuna), tamago (rolled sweet egg omelet), ginger, wasabi and scallion. I got most of everything except for corn, jalapenos and salmon roe. 

When you dine in, the meal comes with a small miso soup and a complimentary drink. They have three different teas you can choose from: Roasted Corn, Barley and Jasmine. I prefer Jasmine Tea, mainly because its wonderful floral scent gives off a more calm and soothing taste to one's palate. Oh, and don't forget dessert. They have 5 different flavors of Macaron Ice Cream ($3.95): green tea, mango, vanilla, coffee and strawberry. I chose Coffee and Green Tea. 

Overall, the quality flavor of every single toppings in my veggie poke bowl taste delicious! And I love their Macaron Ice Cream. It has a light, crispy cookie texture with a smooth and creamy filling. It's just one of those desserts that makes a person feel like a kid again. And it's so worth it!",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,2,5,DWiJAYfIT3VUtTdhCnLEPw

We got to the counter and said it was our first time and the guys walked us through while explaining how to order and what each option was! This spot is basically like a subway for poke bowls! U start with a base (rice or salad) then u move on to the next steps which are sides, proteins, mix-ins, and toppings. I opted for half & half (brown and white rice) with frurikake on top. For sides I chose crab meat and avocado. For proteins I chose salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. And just based off the proteins scoops to rice ratio, I was already impressed! Next I chose masago and cucumber as a mix-in and for toppings, they have a whole list of sauce combinations to choose from! I chose the ""LA style"" which was sesame oil, spicy mayo, eel sauce, Sriracha, and aloha! All this came to a total of about 12 bucks which is def not a bad price for all the proteins I got! Most definitely coming back here especially since it's right next to my gym! *BONUS* Im not a innocent angel / nor do I live my life like a saint by any means, but my faith in Jesus is def strong within me and I loved the Bible scripture on the corner of the paper on my tray: ""I love you, Lord, my strength"" - Psalm 18-1",5R8SuEzBjcitbPj4RYNi-g,0,0,5,RwLzNqPBRDGtFWUMo6MV2A

I always tend to get their salmon and soft shell crab either in a poke bowl or salad. They have a good amount of sauce options available but I think I always just get their sesame oil and ponzu. They give you miso soup when you dine-in w/ your order. I would get tofu on the side when you get your poke and put it in soup instead. They have barley tea available self-serve if you like the roasted grainy tea flavor. Also love how both locations (Eastern & 215 and Rainbow & 215) are close to the Brew Tea Bar locations as well.

They have a great lunch deal going on: I think it's about 7$ for poke and appetizer.

2355777,2017-03-27,1,LWgaRojEN8a-V6yxORo7yQ,"Another new poke place near my hood... but how does it fare? Apparently fairly well considering this is the second location to open up within six months of their first shop, and another two popping up within the next six months! They must be doing something right (well, a LOT of things right)! 

I tried Poke Poku during their grand opening weekend and loved this experience. Of course the 50% promo was wonderful incentive, but I'll be coming back because of the food and service. This ""fast casual"" restaurant is located in the Desert Sands Plaza in the same complex as other awesome eats such as Monta Chaya, Japan Creek Market, Great American Pub, QQ Boba, and right next to EOS Fitness. I walked in totally feeling the vibe of the subtle tropical decor, K-pop music, the lights, and charming little picnic tables for kids, this place is an overall fun atmosphere for a quick dining experience. 

Your entree is made in front of you while you choose your step-to-step items. I opted for the Poke Bowl and then chose my base, sides, proteins, mix-ins, sauces, then toppings. The employees were very helpful and made the process easy. I ordered a large so that I could try 4 different proteins which included tuna, salmon, soft shell crab, and shrimp. I basically got all the ""toppings"" and ""mix-ins"" because they were included, which is really cool because other restaurants only let you choose a few and ask that you pay for extras. You can't go wrong here.. everything tasted delicious and high quality. While I haven't had the chance to try the sushi burrito, small appetizers, or dessert options, I'll be back soon and will update this review!

Some other cool things:
 - Complimentary self-service tea: roasted corn, barley, and jasmine (there's also a description of the benefits for each tea)
 - When you dine-in you get a bowl of miso soup
 - Lunch specials for poke bowls and sushi burritos
 - Stamp card for poke bowls (buy 10, get 1 free)

You can create your perfect bowl without all the extra fees. Other places are going to die because of this but not this one. You start by picking a size, then choosing a base, then a side, main protein, sauces, toppings and more toppings. My mouth is watering just by writing this review!

I went to their opening a week ago and was able to take advantage of their 50% off. Now they offer little perks if you check in on Yelp, or if you write them a review, if it's lunch time, if you dine-in, etc. They have all sorts of gimmicks, and I love it! 

The place has free wifi, lots of seats to dine on, clean bathrooms, well stocked fridges ... but oddly enough no water option on their soda machine yet. No worries though, a worker assured me it was on their list of things to do and kindly offered me a drink from the back.

Service is the first thing that comes to mind. The staff are always helpful and friendly when making your food. They're patient with new customers and have a good attitude.

The food is good as well. There are 5 steps when making your poke bowl. 1) is your base (rice or greens) 2) sides, 3) protein, 4) mix-ins, and 5) toppings. Lastly, there are a variety of sauces to choose from! One of the employees told me, ""as much as you want,"" for things like mix-ins and toppings, so take advantage of that if you're really hungry!

The hardest part was deciding on what I wanted. I ordered a small bowl for me and a medium for my ever growing teenager. He has a ton of allergies, so we are always cautious ordering food. It was nice to see that they list ingredients in their sauces, and you can even opt to have it on the side or none at all. 

When I walked in, the restaurant was well lit, busy and clean. All of the employees are super friendly.

I love spicy food, but if you're sensitive, you might want to stick with their non spicy items. I definitely noticed that their spicy tuna is much more spicy than the norm. It was perfect for me and usually nothing is spicy enough.. yum!

There are so many poke spots going up around Vegas claiming to serve Hawaiian style poke and this place is the only place I found that actually tastes like poke. Their servings are good and enough to fill you up. The quality is great as well. The fish tastes fresh and the pieces are well cut (none of that tendon crap that you can't chew). Love the complimentary ""healthy"" water that they provide, as well as the miso soup (dine-in only). The only thing that I really dislike about this place, and it's enough for me not to return.. is the lack of urgency. The place is set up like Chiptole, but doesn't run as efficiently as Chiptole does. I had 4 people in front of me and I stood in like for 18 minutes before I decided to walk out. I was on my lunch break and didn't have enough time to place an order, let alone eat my food before having to return to work. The next day, I attempted to call an order in because I didn't want the same thing to happen again. The guy insisted I come  in and order and that it would be fast. He was wrong:( 20 minutes before my order was taken. Just 5 people in front of me. I appreciate the care and quality they put into their products but if its considered to be some form of fast food, I would hope that the food would be fast. I'm not sure if it's because they may be short-staffed or they lack of sense of urgency (I'm pretty sure its the latter). Either way, I hope they can figure it out. I'll try again in the far future, in hopes things change. I definitely recommend going, if you have a lot of time to spare or not in a hurry.

This place follows the subway/chipotle style of things...  Basically get a base starch and protein and customize the rest of your food.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I really have no gripes about the quality or quantity of food.

The miso soup and the various teas offered (free) were excellent.  Love the barley and roasted corn teas!

The slushy cooler was a little bit of a let down though.  Supposedly it keeps the beverages in there at a temperature that would cause the liquids to be slushy... NOT!  Or at least the one juice that we got was just cold... No slush to be found.

To me this place is a little haole-fied.  Great selection of add-ins, but no limu to be found in the joint!  I also wish the sauces were available to add on your own instead of asking them to apply it.

4106820,2017-04-15,7,LWgaRojEN8a-V6yxORo7yQ,"It's not technically in Henderson, but I'm so happy that we now have an outpost of the best poke bowls in town.

Poke Poku is still the star of the poke bowl trend that's been taking Las Vegas (and several other big cities) by storm. I've held them in such high esteem since I tried them four months back. To be fair, I've only tried one other place since (also a very good option), but there's at least one important predictor that I can observe from just reviews/photos.

Poke Poku ""#2"" (if you will) is next to EoS Fitness at the southeast corner of Eastern and Serene, and it's a bit smaller inside than #1. Otherwise, it's all the same. The menu has various appetizers and other options to consider (sushi burrito, poke by weight), but its centerpiece is the customizable poke bowl ($9.50 small size for 2 protein scoops, $11.50 medium for 3 scoops, $13.50 large for 4 scoops). You'll start with a base (carbs or salads), move on to sides (seaweed salad, edamame, mild or spicy crab meat, avocado, or shrimp tempura), and pick your proteins from various types of raw fish and other seafood, all of which have been delicious so far.

The key point of separation is the sauce step, where you can pick from preset combinations of sauces or customize your own. The multitude of flavors will then get hand-mixed along with the ""mix-in"" toppings into the proteins, providing even flavor distribution. This is objectively  different than most competitors, who just pile on all the toppings and squeeze one sauce on top, and it's subjectively superior. A final set of toppings can be added unmixed at this point before you pay for the meal.

Regarding the sauce options, the namesake Poke Poku Style - sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, Aloha soy sauce - still stands out to me. I tried a different combo on my first visit to this location - I think it was Hawaiian Style (similar combo, minus the mayo and chili, plus ponzu) - but I didn't quite like the resulting bowl (although, to be fair, maybe I was a bit stressed by having to order for my parents when I made my first visit here a couple of weeks ago - but I digress).

Today's bowl was brown rice (more flavorful and chewy than white rice), ""crab"" meat (aka surimi, aka the mayonnaise-y center of a California roll), shrimp tempura, Poke Poku Style sauces, ahi tuna, salmon, yellowtail, soft shell crab (more or less just crab meat, not a tempura), and perhaps too many mix-ins and toppings to note. Delicious from start to finish because of the variety of flavors and textures, and because of the even hand-mixing. Just as good as my favorite experiences from the original spot, and worth the premium over the other poke bowl restaurants.

My friend also got me the roasted corn drink (one of three ""healthy"" water-type, complimentary drinks available here along with jasmine tea and burdock root), and there was apparently a promo for free 3-piece gyoza. Loved the corn drink as usual, with the naturally sweet flavor in every sip. The gyoza was a bit room temp by the time I got to it, and it was still pretty good, although not something I'd pay for unless I somehow had a craving for it. For dine-in orders, they offer miso soup (which I had the first time, but not on today's to-go order), which is about the same as any typical appetizer miso soup on any Japanese menu.

Poke Poku is still absolutely my top recommendation for this specific genre. Don't conflate poke bowls with truly authentic Hawaiian preparations (the sauced raw fish that usually can be bought wholesale at certain businesses or prepackaged at others), but definitely choose them as an affordable alternative to sushi lunch that has good-for-this-price-range quality.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,11,5,VpEBouFlcf3Fr7Kg6NM1xA

So about the entree I got. I got the medium bowl and you'll see how big/small it is for $11.50 You can either have brown/white rice or salad. Then come the sides which I got crab meat, seaweed, tamago and avocado. Mix-ins which I got masago, cucumber and mango. Then come the protein, I got Salmon, Tuna and Octopus. Lastly comes the sauce. I got the Hawaiian Style!! The flavoring was really good and tasty! I felt like I could've gotten more stuff to flavor it even more, but the lady that helped me wasn't too helpful which is why I only gave the 3 stars. 

So being the fact that this was my first time trying Poke at this place and I always wanna know their specials or what their best sellers are and the lady who helped me didn't even bother telling me those. She wasn't really too into her job. She didn't tell me what else was supposed to go into my bowl and then the guy took over and said you can have all these of you wanted with no extra cost! 

At this point, since she wasn't being helpful at all I wanted to just pay and get out. Not sure if I want to go back to this place again because of the service I got.

First, their $5 lunch deal for a sushi burrito is TOOOOO GOOOD to last. You can add as many mix ins as you want.. which in turn will leave you with a 1 lb burrito that might as well be a bowl. You get 3 pieces of fried gyoza and all the tea water stuff you can drink!

Plus if you check in on YELP you get 10% off!

I got 2 burritos (one filled to the core) for $9.74 (and tipped them a couple of bucks because it's so worth it). It's also worth the 30-45 minute wait (which I attribute to only 2 people working the line and cash register.. but I'm sure it'll change once kinks are worked out). Their staff are very nice -- he forgot to charge me for a drink and gave it complimentary (which I'll repay in more tips later on).  

My recommendation is for the Las Vegas style which has their Gucci Sauce (secret recipe they say), spicy mayo, and ponzu. For a spicy chicken like me, it gives you a nice warmth without pain on your tongue.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,1,0,5,K5q8QmdG_fFJVVp2R9S3qQ

Seriously, though. This establishment is a godsend among a lot of other poke bowl places in town. The environment is clean and welcoming, there's practically an unlimited access to a tea bar, free miso soup for every time you dine in, and the poke bowls are delicious heaps of ingredients filled to the brim. 

My girlfriend and I are regulars here, and we go at least once a week.  It's pretty much safe to say that they are generous with their servings. And it's so refreshing to hear a manager tell their employees to make sure the customers get more than enough servings for their bowls instead of the other way around. 

We usually get a small bowl each with white rice. I personally order a combination of salmon and yellowtail, with a side of crab meat and avocado (with no added cost!). Mixed in with masago, red onions, with Japanese style sauce drizzled in. And topped with green onions and kizami nori to finish it all off. I don't really venture outside of this combination, but you're free to choose all the toppings and mix-ins you want!

With so many poke places opening up, I think Poke Poku will be the few that will stand the test of time. They're planning to open up several shops around the valley, so check to see if are opening up in your neck of the woods. In the meantime, I can vouch for this particular location.

Most of the poke places are kinda more of the same but it's the little things here that sets it apart. I went here needing a quick meal but didn't expect to be all about this place. 

The fish quality has been consistently better than most. You get more options of what to put into your bowl and it's not a bunch of upcharges. Outside of your scoops of fish, you get a choice of ""sides"" (crab, tempura, avocado, etc) and a large array of toppings including premium stuff like masago/tobiko and tamago egg slices. They don't skimp on portions here to make up for giving you options either! 

Then if it can't get any better they offer several ice teas and miso soup with your meal- for FREE! If you don't know me, fresh brewed tea is like how catnip is to cats. Their Jasmine tea is so yummy! Like I would pay for this tea bar but the fact it's included makes me even happier. 

They also can do more traditional poke styles by the pound, sushi burritos and various snacks to accompany your bowl like gyoza and takoyaki.

The best part is that the fish is fresh and tailored to taste exactly how you want it. They have so many sauce options and combinations you can do. They have some ideas listed for you as a guideline (Hawaiian Style, Vegas Style, New York, LA, etc...). In addition to the sauce you get mix ins like onions, cucumbers, tofu, and more. There is so much flavor that way compared to other poke places. 

Lastly, the toppings are unlimited! A select few are additional cost though. Love that they offer tamago, crispy onion, and roasted garlic. 

For drinks there are complimentary waters/tea: corn, barley, and jasmine. Kind of an earthy taste, but refreshing. Of course they offer soft drinks and juices.

I needed quality AND quantity to make me a happy camper at a poke place and this is the first store that has done that in Vegas for me. There are a lot of poke stores opening up but without quality and quantity that it makes the poke spot seem worthless. I came in for their 50% off grand opening weekend and they were moderately busy during lunch time at 2pm. It's assembly line style where they ask you what you want and they go down the line where you pick what item you want in your bowl. 

It depends on your size. I ordered a large bowl because it was 50% off anyway. You start off with your base - white rice, then your sides (2 choices) - Edamame & Seaweed salad, protein (4 choices) - 2 scoops of spicy tuna & 2 scoops of shrimp, toppings (4 choices) - 2 servings of red onions and 2 servings of cucumbers, and lastly finishing toppings (unlimited) - green onions & corn. Their sauces are located on the wall, they don't do individual sauces they prefer to do their house made sauce mixes they have named on the wall already. I just wanted something similar to ponzu sauce but the guy who made my mix had to follow the procedures with the mixes. They put your poke bowl on a tray and make miso soup for you on the side. I ordered a drink and paid with my fianc√®, with the half off it was about $17. Regular price would have been about $34. It is pricey but you do get more quantity wise out of all the poke shops around the area. Their fountain drink is free refills and they have barley tea available! 

Employee's are nice and they wear gloves and a clear mask on the line to prevent spit/ hair contamination onto your food, which is something I appreciate!!! Not all Poke places carry out such a careful and sanitary procedure. Upon entering you'll see a section reserved for children to your right, which is cute! It's little benches and tables.

What stood out first when we walked in is the free teas on the side if your a dine in customer.  When we ordered we were greeted with a smile and told us how to order.   The ordering system is really easy.   Not like other poke places.  And the toppings are all included.  On a side note I really love that their appreciation for germs.  They wear mouth and nose guards when they serve the food.  5 stars in my book.  

We ordered a sushi burrito with salmon and shrimp tempura, with the spicy sauce.  And a soy paper burrito with ahi tuna and shrimp tempura.   

Both were super fresh and tasty.  Wish they gave just a bit more fish.  But I'll take cleanliness over more fish.",zsJLk34mTDMyuVS_EaBLxw,1,0,5,Kcyg3TLs7xnFtCT_J4VQjQ

One day, I saw that my friend had checked in on Facebook and that it was opened on Eastern so we strayed away from our usual Henderson poke spot to give it a try! 

I eat poke so much that I'm probably on the verge of getting Mercury poisoning but this is by far the best poke bowl I've had in Vegas! First off, you get the option of four sizes for the bowl in addition to two toppings (edamame, seaweed salad, spicy crab, ect.). There's a good selection of protein and it's all super fresh. Sometimes tuna and yellowtail can be chewy but not this one! The menu here goes beyond poke bowls too. They serve ramen and appetizers like takoyaki. In addition, if you dine in, you get free miso soup. There are a number of combination of sauces and if you like spicy things, I would highly recommend the Poke Poku sauce. 

The service has always been really good and fast.  The decor is really nice and there's so many options unlike other poke places throughout town. There's even desserts and a variety of drinks. 

10/10 would recommend!",52FeOAXrqwKuwZXmH5q_fw,1,0,5,9DX3ZzGg34Al6BOllZEr0A

Real clean and vibrant atmosphere. Love the tall long community table for those days when you want to meet someone new! 

The location is in a busy parking lot, so be prepared for that as there is a gym and other restaurants that keep this square packed for lunch and dinner. 

The portions were generous, the fish seemed a bit fresher than that of some surrounding competitors and they give you a small cup of miso for free!

Choose either a bowl or sushi-rito, pick your protein, and add your mix-ins. I ordered a small poke bowl with white rice, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, corn, cucumbers, crispy onions, radish, and LA sauce (as recommended by the young lady taking my order). 

First things first, they are definitely not stingy here! She only put about a scoop of white rice in the bottom of my bowl, unlike other places that pretty much fill the entire bowl with rice just so the bowl looks full. Then she packed on the protein! She put on a generous scoop of both the surimi crab and the spicy tuna. I like that the surimi crab is a side and not a protein choice so you don't end up paying extra for 2 proteins. The spicy tuna had a nice little kick to it, too. The LA sauce was described to me as a sweet and spicy sauce and that's exactly what it was. Perfect for those who can handle a little extra heat. The veggies were fresh and crisp, too. 

The price for a small was just under $11. But the amount of food packed into that tiny bowl was worth it.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,0,0,4,7PwYixuXEThLDDR-K001Rg

Their fish is fresh and delicious, the sauces they offer are bomb, so many good toppings, and free miso soup if you dine in. 

It's your typical poke bar / Chipotle concept. You go down the line, choosing your base, sides, protein, sauces, and toppings. You can go poke bowl style, or do it sushi burrito style. They also noticed they have takoyaki & calamari, which I'll have to try next time! 

We came during their grand opening and their  bowls & burritos were 50% off (what a freaking steal, I'm telling you). A small, medium, AND large bowl with a drink only came out to $20.

 For me I get white rice as a base, then for my sides I get seaweed and avocado. Next you choose your add ins ( I have them smash everything into mine that is plant based)which gets mixed with your choice of sauce. I chose the OG Gangster sauce, which is a sriracha,red pepper, and sesame oil based sauce. It's definitely spicy deliciousness if you get down like that. Prepare to love your feast. 
  Now check this fabulous deal out.....when you dine in you get a free Miso soup with your order. Did I mention when you dine in you also get to enjoy fresh brewed ice tea on the house? The choices of tea are very unique and herbal/medicinal varieties. How cool is that? Right? Today they had a Jasmine tea, Barley tea and A roasted corn tea. Each tea has a placard describing its ingredients and health benefits.

The food quality was super and there was a ton of offerings for free with each selection!

I had a salad with tuna and octopus and crab along with nori and other toppings. There was a ton of sauces to choose from, so I stuck to the dairy-free option for myself. My husband had his own special salad and went for a spicier sauce. 

If you dine in you can also sample their roasted corn, barley, and jasmine 'health waters' and are usually treated to free miso soup!

You got the base to either choose rice or salad, along with least 7 different proteins to choose from. Ranging from imitation crab meat-no judgement, cubed ahi, salmon, smoked albacore, cooked octopus, tiny scallops. 
There are unlimited toppings and mix-ins that you can add with no extra cost.  If you know me, I'm all about the awesome ingredients.  Tofu, garlic, masago both orange and black, tamago, nori strips, radish just to name a few of my favorites.  
The servers all wear a chin guard that really serves as a spit protector as they walk the customers through the assembly process.  The prices are more than fair for the amount of food they offer.  Their rewards program is an old school stamp card, and it's a pretty sweet deal.
