We brought some food from 8 Noodle Bar and our waitress didn't mind which was thoughtful of her. I just got their virgin strawberry mojito. It was good, it was just hard to drink, the big clumps of strawberries would block off the straw. They need the mince the strawberries smaller. I also tried some of the quesadilla that my Aunt ordered. It was really rich, heavy and kinda oily. So overall just an ok place.",H_KCkMeFblrh_owAYU9GmQ,4,4,3,lCydzFz1VKfjQsK8Cr3tbQ

Great for meeting up with friends, people watching or just working on your tan with a ice cold beverage. Chill vibe, which I like. Always a fun experience here.

It was probably the worst ahi tuna I've ever had.  I could see how they tried making it exciting with the flavors they chose but everything felt like a war zone in my mouth... not a good blend at all!  The ceviche was typical, nothing to rave about.

The second time I had the fish tacos and a few pineapple express drinks.  This time around the food tasted MUCH better and the drinks were pretty tasty also.

Yes, the cost is pretty damn high, which is really frustrating since this is your only option to eat around the pool.  If they changed their policy to allow outside food, I would have bumped this to 3 stars.  Instead, I'm taking a star off purely because of GREED.",gUkDo8pakDh_iebYNugEdg,2,0,2,OC3sYQ2pdMGX5naWtz-38Q

Both were delicious, and although didn't seem that strong, they hit the spot on a hot day spent in the pool. The only downside was that the  bartenders were a bit slow to take my order both times. They were busy that day but it was just surprising because there were about 4 of them behind the counter. I'm not sure why it took so long for someone to even acknowledge me but it wasn't that big of a deal. All in all, very cool place to get a drink and chill by the pool.

3923497,2012-12-28,2,9eUBRR7WWOqXErZ7omYLNA,"Like everyone else (so far), I am leaving a review for a concert I attended here, not because I stayed at Red Rock Casino and went to the pool for food/drinks. 

I actually did not eat or drink anything while at my show (Lauryn Hill, formerly of The Fugees, formerly a sane human being), but I was offered marijuana by a fellow concert-goer. 

It is a relatively strange concert venue. As it's been noted, the assigned seating chairs are closest to the stage, and the rest of the remaining venue is GA/SRO/FLOOR. Would it be better use of the facility to have it all GA? Of course. Could they set up some risers for those 'special' people that cannot handle GA? Definitely. 

In other words, is it unnecessarily cramped, especially considering the prices that they charge for tickets, and the fact that other poolside venues do it with tons of clear lines-of-sight? That's for you to decide if you go to a show here. It is just an 'A-OK' venue even though the L-Boogie set was tremendous, although I cannot recall if this was the one where she fell onstage or not. Too many Hill stage mishaps to keep track of without a dedicated chart. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,3,3,3,0_Q3nOJwHrvPKuHd1LriNg

Gorgeous setting, sounds is good and it has an intimate concert feel unlike a large venue. 

I expected the weather to be hot but it has been perfect every night. The light breeze and surrounding pools drop the temp down to just right for a summer night in Vegas. 

Dress comfortable and you can even dip your feet in the water if you want to.

4014337,2015-07-24,3,9eUBRR7WWOqXErZ7omYLNA,"Went to the Sandbar grill at Red Rock Hotel & Casino since we had a $30 food credit there during our stay.  This place was not that great for a takeout meal!  But at least the servers were in bikinis.

The grill is short on customer service.  I sat at an empty table near the bar and had the menu in my hand ready to place a to go order for back in our room.  Waited 10 minutes with no response from anyone working!  Had to move to the actual Sandbar 'bar' to get someone to help me.  Placed my order for a Pool Burger and a Turkey Club.  Then proceeded to wait even LONGER.  I was at the bar for another good 30 minutes!  They were so unorganized with food tickets!  Luckily one of the ladies working politely asked me if I was still waiting for food.  Literally less than two minutes later my order arrived.  Packed, ready to go, I just had to sign the order to my room.  The bill?  $39!!  Holy schnikes!  Turns out a Pool Burger is $16, a damn Turkey Club is $15, then you add tax, and an AUTOMATIC 18% gratuity!  Ridiculous!  Poof went the food credit and then some.

I thought this food better be good.  Got back up to the room and did the unboxing.  Food looked pretty MEH to me.  Like a burger.  And a club sandwich.  My damn turkey club wasn't even cut in four triangles with a toothpick in each one like it should be!  My damn turkey club didn't even come with fries!  Argh!  Silly.  Even worse, the turkey club was bone dry!  No mayo!  And no packets of it in my bag.  My kid liked the pool burger with cheese, but again dry!  No mayo or mustard or ketchup on top.  If you guys are gonna do this, why not include some condiments in my bag?  Being on the 16th floor I sure didn't feel like going back down to get some.  But at least her burger came with FRIES.  But I mean, who doesn't include some damn ketchup if there's fries??  Total pisser.

Mediocre overall, and I still had to foot $9 after the food credit!  Shame, shame.  I could have cooked this stuff myself better at home.

The +1 star is for the pretty girls in their teeny bikinis, they workout!  But I don't think many of them can even really swim.  They must also be used as a distraction by the pool for fooling customers into thinking that their Sandbar grill food is the best thing since suntan lotion.

Total: $50 with tax and tip.

 Kiddos ended up eating all of the hummus, few bites of quesadilla and hardly any of the chicken nuggets...go figure. Adults enjoyed the meal and cleaned it off. Overall surprisingly better than what I imagined.",AnSIhCirCP4RIP2JDTQe2Q,0,0,4,N1mwooHILfxl7gSD05eAOg

4813741,2007-03-29,0,9eUBRR7WWOqXErZ7omYLNA,Ok Sand Bar I'm kinda boycotting. When there's a concert going on - getting drinks is like pulling teeth. There's so many people and some of the bartenders there do not know what the hell they're doing. So if you go get a drink.....be prepared to wait in line for a while. Unless they've gotten their shit together. Personally I don't think the setup is that smart. The bar is off to the side - so while you're waiting in line there's obstructions of trees and stuff in your way so you can hear a concert and not see it. At least put some video screens of the dude singing right?,UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,1,1,2,3JiQ0mJa99zsPQIFOhJxyQ
4818603,2011-09-17,4,9eUBRR7WWOqXErZ7omYLNA,"09/16/11 TEARS FOR FEARS CONCERT.

After attending thousands of concerts, this has to be one of the most miserable venues I've ever encountered for a show. If I could give it a zero, I would.

First off, WHERE did the advertisements state that there were SEATED vs STANDING tickets available? They cordoned off a section directly in front of the stage, and then surrounded it with security goons. The light board was literally where it shouldn't be, in the middle directly across from the stage, but COMPLETELY BEHIND the SEATED section, so that the poor folks who couldn't get into the SEATED section (which, BTW, was ONLY HALF FULL the entire evening) were stuck trying to negotiate ANY remaining sight lines.

And then, when it comes to getting ANYTHING to drink, forget about it. There were bars, but it was virtually impossible to walk around, due to all the pools in the way. I'm very surprised no one fell in, considering how DRUNK and OBNOXIOUS the crowd was, and the little amount of room to wander. I did not drink a thing the entire show, from 9pm until just after 11.

And about that crowd. OMFG, WHY DO YOU GO TO CONCERTS AND THEN SCREAM AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS TO FRIENDS WHILE THE SHOW IS HAPPENING? WHY THE F**K ARE YOU EVEN THERE? Now, as I said at the beginning, I've literally been to thousands of shows, and have experienced this many times. But THIS CROWD takes the cake for obnoxiousness. I nearly encountered a fist fight between a group of drunks directly next to me, caused by an a**hole couple who shoved in front of 2 nice folks who had been standing next to me for the first 45 mintues, which, if it had not been diffused, would've ended up, in a domino effect, getting my spouse thrown into a pool, and then, believe me, DEATH BY SPOUSE would have occurred!

And then there were the actual people WORKING the venue. NONE of them seemed to want to be there. (DO YOU BLAME THEM?) And there were ""thugs"" literally shoving people out of the way to escort ""special"" people to the SEATED section. Again, I'm surprised no one ended up in one of the pools. (I overheard someone say, in fact, ""Gee, NO ONE ended up in a pool this time!"")

So my advice is: If there is a show advertised for this venue, DO NOT GO unless you can get those SEATED tickets. It just isn't fun enough to deal with. And even THEN, expect overcrowding, chaos and a**holes, both w/ mgmt and patrons.

I moved to Vegas last December. I've enjoyed EVERYWHERE tremendously. I am a Strip patron and a non-Strip patron. The free concerts at the Cosmopolitan, the shows at the punk venues like Double Down and Beauty Bar, even the shows at the Railhead inside the Boulder Station, have all been pleasant, well-staffed and easy to have fun. This was the first time in 9 months of being a local where I started thinking maybe I made a mistake moving here.

Next show: Joy Formidable @ the Cosmopolitan Pool. Can't wait. Saw them Thursday night there. And I've been there already for a bunch of shows.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,3,2,1,iEu22O_Vz-RyHCBuPjqemw
4973788,2006-09-11,0,9eUBRR7WWOqXErZ7omYLNA,"One of Las Vegas's newest hot spots - the Red Rock Casino Resort Spa.  This review is based on their Sand Bar and the entertainment events they host by the pool.

Arriving into the desert was ""A Tribe Called Quest.""  The setting, a huge outdoor pool with giant beds for outdoor lounging.  If you hope to score one of these beds to enjoy your concert experience, expect to get there early.  They are definitely hard to come by.  

With alcohol sold poolside, you can still bring your previously purchased drinks into the concert area.  (They'll pour your drink into a plastic cup, that's all.)

A stage is put up for the performing artists and with its general admission, feel free to get up close and personal by making your way to the front.  If you arrive too late, plan on spending time in the way back.  With the pool being right in the middle of the venue, your only options are the front, sides or way back.  

With it being September and with the headliners hitting the stage at 9 pm, it wasn't too hot outside.  

Overall, Red Rock Casino Resort Spa is a pretty cool place.  Locals and tourists frequent the place as it's off the strip and not readily accessible to those who don't know about it.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,1,4,sTKrtcmmQX6YaGyPPLYeHA

Very convenient when you don't feel like leaving your spot poolside. Prices are high but to be expected from a casino eatery. The food was surprising pretty good. We got the turkey club and the jerk Chicken sandwich. Both came with a choice of French fries, sweet potato fries or fruit. Sweet potato fries were definitely a great choice.  Turkey club was big enough for 2! The jerk chicken had pretty good flavor as well. Pitcher of pineapple mojito was refreshing. They also had an off menu desert of dole whip!

However,  my biggest hang up here is the customer service. I have a keen sense and I could feel the tension, drama and chaos between the bartenders and even the servers.  They even complained about another bartender who they thought was faking an illness just to go home earlier. No one behind the bar made eye contact with the customers and I was there a good three hours people watching with my girlfriend.  Note-not all pool customers are creepers who want to get your digits and hang out with you later!! We were appalled by the immaturity.

We got there early and got a prime spot by the stage.  We suggest getting there on the early side as you do not want to get trapped by the pools and accidentally fall in. There were plenty of drink specials but I could not believe they charged $3 for an 12oz bottle of their own water!  Also be careful of beer bottles that people drop.  They are aluminum, but they are hard and you could roll an ankle on them.

I do, however, often fill up on the free water available to all at the bar. There have been plenty of tables available the last few times and even seats at the bar. Those patrons at the bar seemed to having a good time. The draft beer selection is decent.
