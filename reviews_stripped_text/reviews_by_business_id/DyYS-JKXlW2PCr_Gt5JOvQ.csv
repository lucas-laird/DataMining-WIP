Strolled in here solo because my other plans for the day got changed, and being a 49er faithful seeing the gigantic ""This is 49ers Country"" sign outside, I figured I would see how it was...

Low and behold I should have slapped myself for not coming in here before because all the other sports bars I've been to in the area pale in comparison to the sea of Red & Gold that I became engulfed in when I stepped inside. And let me tell you on game day, the place is PACKED! (And so is the parking lot, so get here a little early) Great atmosphere and decor, great fans and friendly people who all love the Niners. (except for the occasional fan from the opposing team, who walked into the wall when he came out of the bathroom! LMAO) You can tell that a lot of the people watching the game have actually gone to Candlestick Park because there was the trademark cry ""WOOO, WOOO, WOOO!!!"" whenever we got a 1st down, and the ""Let's go Niners, LET'S GO!!"" chants! It almost felt like I was at a bar in SF! Loved it! It was so packed that the group of fans that I befriended were using a pool table as our hangout. And it eventually became our table spread with all the food and drinks we ordered.

And speaking about the drinks and food, let me say that this is A BAR first, that happens to serve food. They have game day specials for beer and grub that are priced very well. The quality of the food on the other hand was average (for a bar) and after sampling the pizza, french fries, onion rings, chicken fingers & chicken wings I would have to say I could only recommend the pizza. The crust was nice an doughy on top but crispy on the bottom and the toppings and cheese were pretty good. The weirdest thing I ate were the chicken wings that I had ordered with buffalo sauce. The wings were tossed in COLD SAUCE from the refrigerator. Who does that?!! As for the service we received, it was pretty good compared to the food. The waitresses in our area were very attentive and friendly, checking in on us throughout the game, and our orders came out in a fairly timely manner considering how busy it was.

With all the foodies in Vegas, if they put in an actual chef and came up with a better menu like some other sports bars around here, this place would get better reviews and more business on non game days. But hey, there are plenty of great places to eat just up the road on Rainbow. What you come here for is to have drinks and hang out with like minded fans to cheer on the San Francisco 49ers!!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,4,3,4,z2ydRigOc21_a3eQeb5oGA

I got the drink that I ordered, but it was like pulling teeth to get anything else.  My fiance and myself had to beg for refills.  There was no emotion out of the bartender, Angel.  Then when they were doing shift change she asked if we would close out with her, which is fine, but when we looked at the bill, we were charged full price for our drinks when we were both gambling max bet on two machines.  She looked at the bill and tore it up and yelled whatever.  The graveyard bartender walked by our empty glasses about eight times before my fiance asked if we could get a new drink.  He looked over and rudely stated that he had a whole bar to take care of and he will be right with us.  There may have been six to eight other people at the time.  If I said that to a guest at my work I would have been fired.  The wings were decent and Nicole the server was nice, but as Angel was stocking beers, she would look over at us and shake her head like we did something wrong.  This happened multiple times before we left.  I was excited to try a new bar and it seemed nice with a comedy show going on and a nice atmosphere, but unfortunately I will never go back. I am also going to tell anyone who asks about my awful experience and the lack of courtesy that I received.

1822297,2014-12-17,0,DyYS-JKXlW2PCr_Gt5JOvQ,"My roommate and I have been eyeing this place since we moved in down the street.     Last night we decided to give it a go.    We arrived at 7:05 and sat at the bar with no gaming machines.   The bartender took our drink orders (Jameson and ginger and a Coke) and was prompt in handing them to us.   Unfortunately she did not follow up to see if we wanted a menu or let us know any specials that they may have had.      

 After 10 minutes of not being contacted by the bartender or any other employee we grew impatient.  My roommate said he came to try to the food so he would wait it out.     at 7:30 I told him I was done and I wanted to leave.   Being in the lounge for now 25 minutes with only being contacted once was uncalled for.  My roommate said he would wait until the beginning of the 4th quarter of the MNF game and then would leave.     7:47 came around when the 3rd quarter ended and I got up and walked across the bar to tell the bartender we are done and to close out my tab.     

When she handed me my bill she said thank you for coming in.      I was livid as why she would thank me when she didn't pay any attention to me or my roommate for 42 minutes.    She was too busy flirting with the other guys at the bar.   When we found another place to eat we both felt she was purposely avoiding us during our visit there.  

I went in with high expectations as the bar is two blocks away and from my experience at their location in the Northwest on Farm.  I WILL NEVER step foot into this establishment again for the way we were treated.      We both felt that we interrupted her night by ordering a drink and then closing out the tab.     

I hope for the sake of future visitors that our experience is a fluke, but after reading some of these reviews I feel it is not.

It's always the same bartender that this happens with. And it doesn't matter if the place is empty or if it's busy she is always not paying attention to her customers. The last straw was when I went in a couple of weeks ago and  it was empty on a Monday night football day. She was chatting with her co workers and then on a personal call and would not ask my gf and I if we wanted a more drinks.Finally I waved her over and asked for the check & I was going to let it go but she asked why we haven't been staying as long as we used to.

Honestly it's hard to review this place when it came to food because over the past year I've been here a handful of times and almost every time they've had a different menu and a different cook/chef.   This does happen in Vegas I know of some businesses but not so often.  So far I've always enjoyed their food every time.

They have a separate bar area with a lot of TVs and alcohol with food and drink specials during football games. And a large separate dining area with a pretty good game area. They have a big Colin Kaepernick picture hanging above the door, I'm sure it was Alex Smith a couple years ago and Jeff Garcia a few before haha jk. No I actually think that's cool.

I had their Running Rebel pizza I really enjoyed it and it was only like $10.  It was a large pizza with pepperoni, Canadian bacon, mushroom, onion, green peppers, olives, and ground beef. Basically the ingredients you'd get in a supreme pizza from other pizza spots. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/luckys-lounge-las-vegas-2?select=TPtPbotymZOjM1W5T5qL5Q#TPtPbotymZOjM1W5T5qL5Q

She didnt say hi,just a ""what can i get you"" ,she brought menus and went back to the row, we ordered our food from a pleasant enough person- a pizza and an italian beef-both were pretty good, but we couldnt get past the bartenders attitude (i think her name was Trish,but she never introduced herself- decent looking blonde with big fake boobs)and her complaing about how hard she works,all the driving she does,how early she wakes up ...whatever,i guess we all have bad days- i played the jukebox to drown out her complaining- pretty good jukebox....anyway- i will order delivery next time and avoid the complaining bartender....things got better with the nightime bartender- slender guy with alot of tattoos, he was nice enough and seemed pleasant,even though the other bartender was kinda short with him telling him what he needed to do that night ,what a bitch.....",V1-8f3Iz5txmQURcjUsP4Q,1,1,1,_OAyLz_lFvSCEVWkSvviYw

The bar area is to the left and the restaurant seating is to the right. When we walked in, no one greeted is at all, and we had no idea if we were just supposed to wait or seat ourselves or what. We ended up just seating ourselves.

We weren't particularly hungry so we just split an order of steak nachos. They weren't good at all. The meat was super dry and tasteless, and you could just tell everything was really low quality...bagged cheese, canned beans, jarred salsa, etc. I make better nachos in 5 minutes at home.

I, also, ordered a Bees Knees cocktail which had gin, honey, and I think lemonade served on ice. It tasted OK, but it was a pretty weak drink.

The Music Bingo was pretty fun. Basically, they play clips of songs, and once you know the artist/title, you look for that on your card. From there, it is just like normal bingo. The music was good, too...pretty much all genres represented. I feel like the people running it could have been more upbeat, but there were only 3 tables occupied in the whole place, so that might have been a little wasted. The other tables seemed like they were either friends of the people running the Bingo or really regulars because they all knew each other by name. Also, they brought their little kids, which felt weird in a bar setting at night.

Music Bingo was free to play, and happens Saturdays at 7p. You mostly have the opportunity to win beer and food from Lucky's, but they were, also, giving away shirts and movie tickets.

Despite all of this, I do plan to go back and try the pizza, which other Yelpers say is good. Plus, I think this would be a pretty fun thing in a larger group.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,1,1,3,VkkeDikaWWX-1ifKoM5-_g

Found this place just in time for the Super Bowl.

Basically a warning for the haters to stay away haha. This place gets hyped and loud during a game and holds special events such as raffle tickets and free Jell-O shots when a Niner scores a touchdown! The beer is fairly priced. Awkward that the wings here only come in two flavors (hot and barbecue). Popcorn shrimp and fries was ok but I still devoured it like a sumo eating sushi. Ok I'll be honest about the food just being mediocre but I'm not here reviewing this for the food.
