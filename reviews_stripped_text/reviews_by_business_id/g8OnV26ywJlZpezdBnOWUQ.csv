Something that caught  my attention was the decor, as it matches the theme of the restaurant. The staff is friendly, but should try accommodating guest better. They have these fans on at all times plus the AC, so even in Vegas weather, it is really cold in the dining area. We asked if we could change tables and it was like if we asked if we could leave without paying. So we just decided to stay were we were, and even though our food got cold due to this we enjoy our meal and took the leftovers.  Overall, make sure to come hungry and ready to take a bag with you.",e3s1x4LLqfSkRTWDy_-Urg,1,1,4,3cYhVDEA4TZOiCEqzoJaEg

The one on Sahara is the only one I like.  They had a pork roast scramble special once that I still fantasize about, but for me, it's mostly about the breakfast and the PANCAKES.  The blueberry pancakes are good but the banana brown sugar are AMAZING.  If you like pancakes, they are the best and worth every penny.  The vanilla waffle is pretty blah.  The mashed potatoes are crazy good.",INbqkFXtHeCdEP_wPp2dUA,0,0,4,aako0tVOA0kGN2-96s2KWA

5319,2013-03-12,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"You have to ask yourself sometimes, how crappy do I want to feel after I eat this? If the answer is - not at all, do NOT eat here. While in Vegas I wanted to sample some non-strip fair and drunkenly asked a bouncer where he liked to go eat - he said Hash House A Go Go. Given that he was about 6'5"" and weighed 250 pounds, it all makes sense now. My girlfriends and I arrived around 11:00am on Sunday morning and were told it was about to be about a 40 minute wait. That wasn't too bad - the line seemed to be moving quickly and there were some benches outside where you can sit and take a look at the menu. We were called inside to eat and the overall ambiance is pretty neat. Like a tin shed that is crossed with a barn? I decided to really go for full sickness feeling and order the fried chicken benedict (with their famous sage fried chicken). I have to say that I don't eat fried chicken often - in fact it has probably been about 10 years since I last had some, but sometimes you have to make your stomach beg for mercy. The portion that I received could have easily fed me for 2 weeks and I am not a light eater. It probably weighed 20 pounds. It has fried chicken, mashed potatoes, eggs, bacon, hollandaise and who knows what else since you could not see the bottom of the plate. Despite the gargantuan portion, the taste was excellent. Truly just tasty, greasy, cheesy diner food that does not apologize for using 3 pounds of butter in each dish. The service was fast and the coffee was great! Really, what else can you really ask for from a diner? The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars is that the portions are really (embarrassingly if not annoyingly) large. There is no reason anyone should need to eat that much food (now if you want to eat it, that's another story). But if you're looking to lay around for the remainder of the day in a food coma while wearing stretchy pants - then make sure you eat at Hash House!",DBkfQhR64fqkCYeHJx9Pkg,0,0,4,PJoRkxLx1I6R-QwT_gtrNw

8648,2014-07-31,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This review is mostly for the poor customer service at this location. The front of the house almost seems proud that they don't give a crap. While we've gone here before and experienced broken drink glasses and extremely slow responses, tonight was the last straw. The hostess greeted us and we requested a booth. The restaurant was maybe 30% full, plenty of open booths, but she did not offer to seat us there. I assumed they didn't want to use certain sections. Keep in mind, the place was 70% empty. She didn't offer a drink of water or to look at a menu while we waited. No one working there did.  Other employees, another server and a bartender,  walked by where we were waiting. They actually seemed annoyed by our request.  It just seems like with all the competition for restaurants in Vegas,  somebody there would want to take our money. Or at least be happy someone walked in on a slow midweek evening.  

This was the last thing we needed after the broken glass incident. We thought ""Let's give them one more chance. "" So while tonight wasn't the worst ever,  it pissed us off more because the attitudes were so bad.",SmuqmcoBmy2sYJmQF5yCZw,0,0,2,M6MqSSBbizEfvgqbMbm3Ow

But after staring at the gigantic portions for long enough, it just become downright nauseating.. BUT there aren't that many good breakfast spots in Vegas, so the fact that the food is solid sort of makes up for anything else..

another downside, though- the music is so loud! it's not really good music either, but it plays loudly enough to burst an ear drum.

Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit, if only for the novelty of it. But save yourself from a very uncomfortable stomach by not going too too often.",EUbeL-dRlmOFyYHPVm1kbw,0,0,3,saLlmtP9eoJrNCgkDgX-Lw

40714,2010-09-29,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Maybe my expectations were too high but Hash House A Go Go kind of disappointed me on every level. 

After months of lusting over the Chicken Benedict after seeing it on Food Network I could hardly wait, Too bad I had to. We got there around 11am on a Thursday and the place was pretty packed inside. The hostess was friendly and quoted the wait around 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. Being hung-over and starved we chose the patio and thats where the experience became unpleasant.

 Our waitress was cool but it took her 10-15 minutes to bring us our drinks and being that we hit the sheets around 5 that morning we needed that coffee and water badly. I ended up ordering the Boston Hash because at the time it sounded amazing, and my bro got the Fried Chicken Benedict so I was just gonna steal bites from him. Our friend just got some scrambled eggs and we ordered one of those giant pancakes to split.

After we ordered we got to talking about the night before and kind of lost track of time before I realized our food was taking wayyy too long. I was able to estimate exactly how long from a text my bro sent as we were ordering and it was going on 36 minutes and we still hadn't seen a plate. After I caught up to the waitress she assured me the food was coming and after another 5 minutes it did.

The plates looked delicious! Everything was piled high, too bad the quality didn't match the quantity! My crab cakes just weren't good at all, they had a good amount of crab but just weren't that tasty, and the horseradish cream that came with it didn't help. Plus my potatoes were soggy and burnt tasting! I tasted my bros Benedict and while it was better than my breakfast it wasn't stellar, the pancake was kinda dry and seemed like it was cooked way before it was brought out. The best thing about the meal was the watermelon kiwi lemonade I ordered and to add insult to injury it took us another 20 minutes to catch a cab out of there. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",J1XfWtKz0kd7w38Bx8czRg,0,0,2,CEGPOxFcawSJRZRNxJg8Yg

I had heard that the portions were huge and they didn't disappoint. It's never a problem getting a to go box but how about having a not so big of a serving and drop the price. I would be much happier with that. 
I once had a Chicken fried in Texas and it was available in 2 serving sizes, large and Texas large. 

At the HHAGG I went for the Eggs Benedict and they were absolutely delicious. My friend Mark Napolitano had the Corn Beef Hash. I tasted the CBH and it was rather good, needless to say that there was far too much. 

Overall the HHAGG is a great sensory overload on a Sunday morning. Don't expect a quiet Sunday brunch reading the newspapers and relaxing, it's not going to happen. 

Food: Clean, fresh and very tasty. 

Decor: Rustic farmhouse full of hanging yard sale items. Lots of wood. 

Parking: No problem. 

Location: So easy to find. 

Cost: Reasonable, good value, I left with breakfast for the following morning.

We are from out of state and yelped this place which had relatively good reviews. We went before noon and it got busy after we came. Very sticky menus and smelly table (assuming from a dirty rag) made it difficult to completely enjoy my meal. We had 5 children and 4 adults. The chicken tender kid's meal was not popular. The kids did not like the breading and it came with no sauce. The butter penne pasta was more popular with a generous portion. I didn't try any of the breakfast items that were ordered. Nothing spectacular. My chicken and waffle was actually better than expected. I'm not a chicken breast sort of person but I finished my shared portion of the chicken (waffles had baked in bacon) and my sister also liked it. As you can tell from the photo, portions are huge. The pancake was at least 6 to 7 inches in diameter (bigger than a basketball). I think this is the main draw to this place. I don't think I would go again.

Great presentation and oversized portion...to make up for the lack of taste. It's served on a biscuit with gravy on top of mashed potatoes. The biscuit was undercooked (or just extra mushy) to a point that I didn't know where the biscuit ended and the mash potatoes began. I think the chicken started out with a nice crisp finish that was ruined with too much gravy. The tomato slices in the middle next to the sage should have been a nice touch, but were utterly flavorless.  Our server ask once if we'd like more coffee.  I said ""maybe in a few minutes"".

64560,2013-06-10,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Brenda's daughter took us here for breakfast one Saturday morning instead of going to the local Denny's or IHOP. She insisted that it had some good food and the overall reviews said it was pretty good. When we got there, there were quite a few people ahead of us so hopefully that spoke to the quality of the food--unfortunately it didn't. After a long wait in line we finally were seated and greeted by a waitress who didn't seem like she really wanted to be there either (she probably already tasted the food).

We ordered our coffee and juice and stared at the menu. Brenda and I both have an adventurous palate and are willing to try anything at least once. However, there is a difference between adventurous and just plain crazy. When you read the menu, nothing jumps out and says ""Hey! Pick me! I'm really tasty."" Quite the opposite--the food and flavor combinations of everything except the pancakes don't even begin to sound like they'll work together. However, to be polite, we placed our orders and waited for the food. I had the only thing that sounded somewhat normal to me; the corned beef has with red onions and Swiss cheese. By the way, they have a no substitutions policy and they do enforce it.

The service here isn't any better than the food. Wait staff is slow and you may or may not have everyone's meal served at the same time.As we waited for the food to arrive, we saw that the portions they brought out were huge--even bigger than what we get at Black Bear. Unsurprisingly, with the amount of people here, the wait for the food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long for breakfast. Apparently because the food is all ""homemade"", it prevents the kitchen staff from having any type of timing system to ensure everyone at the table is served at the same time. When my food was placed in front of me, I just kind of stared at it. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered corned beef hash. Instead of a neat presentation, I faced a huge pile of potatoes and the hash topped with a slice of cheese and two overcooked eggs. Sticking out of the top of this monstrosity was a rosemary tree. Normally, I would expect something like this to have the hash grilled and then have the cheese placed on top and remixed once it the cheese melted before putting it on the plate. I also expected the ""crispy"" potatoes to be on the side. Since they were thrown in with the hash, they were soggy from all the grease.

The food itself lacked any real flavor and no amount of salt and pepper really did anything to improve it. Sure, the portions were huge, but that just meant more wasted food at the end of the meal. Quality is a bit more important that quantity.

Their motto is ""Twisted Farm Food."" I'm not sure what farms they're visiting, but it doesn't conjure up any memories of food I ate growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country.

If you are on the strip side of town and you want gargantuan meal portions than HHAGG is your place. I tried a few of their meal options like, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower, which was pretty delicious but it is so huge that the same taste can get a little boring on the taste buds. I've tried the Famous Meatloaf I was not that impressed, I guess you just have to love meatloaf. Indiana Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin, this half a pig steak is a delicious, many flavors that work together defiantly a must try. I also tried a dish with duck breast I don't recall the name of it but I was disappointed the flavors did not work for me. The best and ultimate favorite of mine(and Adam Richman Man v Food) is Andy's sage fried chicken benedict. The perfect juicy crispy fried chicken and is covered by this ""chipotle crack cream"" that I can eat a bucket of. Also all the other food groups are present like spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella and scrambled eggs, and a biscuit, all you need after this meal is a bed.

The presentation of the food is ridiculous.  I believe the goal is to stack the food as high as possible and add a very large rosemary tree (not sprig, but tree) to the top for maximum height.  I saw many dishes being served to others.  If the entree didn't have a rosemary tree sticking out of the top, then it had a steak knife standing straight up from whatever it was stabbing.  Each entree measures about 8""-11"" high.  I can't even begin to imagine what the calorie count is per dish.  Restaurants like this help me understand why we have an obesity problem in this country.

We ordered the salmon and chicken penne entrees.  The food was completely flavorless.  My salmon was served over a massive glob of potatoes (and adorned with a rosemary tree).  My husband's chicken was stacked on a skewer sticking into a half apple (and topped with a rosemary tree).  Our sodas had no bubbles.  They were like watery syrup.  We switched to water, which we have never done before.  The sodas were really that bad.

The music selection was odd and quite annoying - a slow, sad song, followed by a few head-banger tunes, back to slow, sad, then punk, and then a latin rhythm.  Just weird.

Service was fast but unfriendly.

$66 for two disgusting dinners.

This is what we had:

Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. I took a picture of this sexy beast so look at it! This is shown as a Man V Food recommendation and Adam Richmond was spot on with this one! Really good fried chicken just covered with egg, cheese, bacon, and chipotle cream. On the side of the plate they have like a chipotle puree as decoration and garnish. OMG! Really subtle, smoky chipotle cream just made the dish for me. It was really good. The chicken itself was a nice big piece of fried chicken that I really liked. There was a split biscuit underneath all of this and honestly, that by itself was really good. I ended up removing one of the halves of the biscuit and putting the house jelly on it.. Such a good milky and fluffy biscuit.. A really hearty/delicious dish!

Can't find it on the online menu , but also had a chorizo hash with fresh jalapenos, house potatos, and eggs. I think there was more to it than that, but I can't remember. Really fresh chorizo with a nice kick to it. Unlike other chorizos, this wasn't too salty which was greatly appreciated! The potatoes were really good being nice and brown. No complaints about that dish either!

Of course had coffee and juice as well. Fresh juice and always refilled coffee. Can't beat it. 

As far as service goes, it was good. I could of used more water when I wasn't sipping my coffee, but other than that not bad at all.

Pricing is fair for the amount you get!

I just left hash house a go go and I will never go back. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken had no flavor except for the maple syrup poured all over it. Sweet sticky meat with beading that tasted like fried white flour. The waffles had bacon inside, again dessert meat. I ordered a side of sausage gravy to try to salvage the chicken, I ate about a teaspoon, it was the consistency of thick pudding. Again thick flour taste with a bit of sausage mixed in. So needless to say I wasn't crazy about the food. However my real problem was the service. Kelly was my waitress, and while not exactly rude, not very helpful when she realized I had a problem. I told her I needed the gravy because I wasn't crazy about the syrupy chicken, she said "" yeah, some people don't like the sweet meat, I guess you learned!"". When I didn't eat much even after she brought the gravy she said, ""is it making you sick?, I'll get it out of your way"". I didn't ask for a free meal, and I was not comfortable saying more because of her comments. But the thing is, that she offered no options to rectify the situation, she did not send a manager over to talk to us, and charged us for everything.

The pork tenderloin was to die for. First, the plate was the size of a man hole cover. We are not talking small portions here. The sauce is an amazing mix of tomatoes,cream, and love. It is magical. I could eat a shoe covered in that sauce. The pork was so tender I could cut it with a spoon. (Not that I did, mind you, but I could've.)

I chose this place randomly and completely forgot I had seen it on Man v. Food, but saw the fried chicken Benedict advertised as such on the menus, which jogged my memory. We ordered that plus the chorizo hash and both were gigantic and delicious.

The fried chicken was juicy, the gravy was tasty, and the veggies were fresh. 

I actually liked that chorizo even more, though, as the spicy sausage was perfectly prepared and cooked with the right amount of heat. That mixed with over easy eggs and the jalapenos, cheese, and potatoes ... just ridiculous!

The way Adam on Man vs Food made this place definitely a need to go in my book. There were not enough oh my's or yums coming out of my mouth as I watched the episode. So a few weeks before my trip to Vegas, I bookmarked it on Yelp because it was a must go. I told everyone about it and showed pics from my bro in laws experience. I felt like it was going to be a magical moment. 

Michelle L. and I got there at 2:25P.. and we had to wait for our other 2 friends. We were told we couldn't be seated until they arrived AND they were closing the door in 5 minutes. My friends got a few calls asking where they were and I felt like I was going to miss out on my magical eating moment. But luckily they showed up with a minute to spare. 

As we scanned the menu, there were many things that made me go oooh. But this is what I went with...

Smores Mocha - Not usually a warm mocha person but it was just ok. If they crumbled up some graham crackers on top it might have made it more memorable. 

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit - Tasty but the fried Chicken was a bit dry. I drizzled some of my friends maple syrup on it to give it a little more character. 

We didn't wait long for our food as many others said. We were told that their food prep area is as big as their tables that are in the restaurant and after the Man vs Food episode, the restaurant became extremly popular.  Hence the reason for the slow service at the peak hours. I'm just saying what our waiter told us (he was really friendly).

A few tips: 
- Don't over hype your expectations before coming 
- Our waiter told us that they are opening a location at the Imperial Palace 
- Come a little closer to 2:30 in the afternoon - Hey your in Vegas, the town that never sleeps :)

Other than that I have no complaints, just happy that I got to experience it. I really cant be mad with that much food on my plate.  End of story.",-VjzA52BiwSM_wG6gCI9FQ,2,1,3,9GXtZsCF7B4Mty6-SIP9xA

This Hash House A Go Go is not what I was expecting!
I've been hearing about a blue collar breakfast greasy spoon country trash diner that serves Budweiser in a paper bag along with a deliciously greasy bacon and omelet hangover cure. 
This is the Hash House A Go Go, and yet it isn't. 
The modern decor, ultra clean lines, and stainless steel lend a silence and swankiness to a place that should have plastic red and white checkered tableclothes and lots of decorative pigs. 

I had the Man vs. Food favorite, the fried chicken benedict with eggs and biscuits and three chicken breasts, some bacon, layers of fried cheese, little baby rosemary trees, 2 inches of mashed potatoes, a lake of delicious sauce, and a watermelon wedge. Really. 

All the jazzy stuff stuff was great, but the chicken itself was dryer than Stephen Wright's comedy. And the portions? Yeah, they're huge, but this is America, and it fits right in with our SUV, megashopping, megaconsuming culture. 

So twisted farm food that costs 25$ an entree? Meh, take me to a diner, where I can wear my Daisy Dukes and sing along to Hee Haw.

Now that is out of the way... 

There were three of us. I ordered what I saw on TV, the fried chicken benedict. Friend #1 had the french toast. Friend #2 had the chicken salad sandwich. 

Fried Chicken Benedict: It was big as my head, without exaggeration. This will server 3 people. I barely ate 1/3rd.. but I am not a huge portion eater anyways. I saw a biker kind of guy next to us eat 3/4 of it, which I though was super impressive. Flavours? A little too much on the plate. You get a mixture of spicy, creamy, zesty, etc.. it's really hard to describe. If you don't know it by now, I'll call it out from bottom up; mashed potatoes, biscuit, tomato slice, spinach, bacon, griddled cheese, fried chicken breast.. and all drizzled with chipole cream sauce. It is definitely a brunch item, not breakfast. I have to say, I saw a someone else order it, but with the sauce on the side. Smart! 

French Toast: More like, french loaf. Again, massive insane portions. Only half was eaten. But I sampled this, and it was quite delicious. Probably one of the best french toast that I had. 

Chicken Salad Sandwich: By far the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever tried. Nice dill flavour, and moist chicken meat. The multigrain bread was excellent too. Fries were super hot and fresh. They had a bit of coating on them (very very lightly), and helped stay crispy until the end. 

You must try the waltermelon-kiwi lemonade. Very delicious, and thirst quenching. 

Price-wise, it can be considered as a good value, just because of the portions. I would say, SHARE dish. Do not attempt at it alone.

I started out with the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade.  The drink looks awesome as the bottom half of the drink is green and the top half pink.  The drink had the perfect mix of sweetness and tartness and made a perfect compliment to the heavy food.

I decided to go with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The fried chicken was tasty and not dry.  You got 2 large chicken breasts along with 3-4 waffles which came pre-syruped and with bacon stuffed in the middle.  The waffles went well with the fried chicken but I wasn't too impressed with them.  Overall I was satisfied and the portions were beyond huge.

Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of Bloody Mary's. I think the idea of vodka mixed with tomato juice is down right nasty, but after watching Mary after Mary being whipped up behind the bar, I decided that I needed to try one of these amazing looking concoctions. Only problem was, it seriously took us about 15 minutes to grab the attention of a bartender. Not cool. I understand you're extremely busy, but 15 minutes? Absurdly long wait aside, it's served in a huge class and adorned with a variety of pickled veggies and it was hands down, the best Bloody Mary I'd ever had.

We did have a pretty long wait for a table (which I was ready for), because we came late Sunday morning and all the marathoners were slowly gathering in to pig out after their race. My bf ordered the fried chicken benedict that he had been craving since the airing of Man V Food, and I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles that were recommended by the NY Times. Now, I've never had chicken and waffles so I really had no idea what I was in for, and man was I surprised! Two strips of bacon were cooked inside of each waffle! And the fried chicken? Probably one of the best pieces of fried poultry I've ever consumed. The bf reported back that his benedict was everything he had been hoping for and more.

Ordered a ""Fresh Mushroom with Swiss Cheese Burger"" at the Sahara Ave Las Vegas store today and it arrived with enormous mounds of meat, over a pound of burger meat, which turned out to be of very poor taste and low quality. If I had to guess the meat, it would has guessed road kill, as it even smelled bad. I took one bite and (almost vomited) immediately ejected the bite from my mouth. I ate half the fries with some ketchup and was done.  $15 down the drain.

Wait time:  Great...10 mins

Decor/Atmosphere:  hip/fun/great

Food:  ""HH Original Farm Benedict was visually pleasing presentation-wise, portion size was large, but tasted very plain and average.  Roasted Red Pepper cream sauce wasn't a plus to this dish.  Unimpressive (according to my friend who ordered this dish).

""Tractor Driver Combo"" (2 eggs w/ bacon and vanilla waffle version ordered) was nothing special/plain and over-priced for what you get ($12.95).  No garnish on the plate whatsoever with the exception of one strawberry on top of the waffle.  Two of us ordered this dish (we each had our own) and felt exactly the same way about it.

Small orange juice ordered tasted like the kind that comes out of a machine and was way over-priced ($3.75).

We all ordered coffee. One person in our group took the first sip and immediately noticed a glob of old caked-on red lipstick on the rim of her cup.  Disgusting!  She asked for a new cup of coffee.  Server did not apologize nor seem to care...just brought a replacement cup. In my opinion, one cup of coffee should have been comped on our bill at the end of the meal, no questions asked, but that was not the case.

Service:  Very poor.  Server was not friendly whatsoever.  This was so unexpected, especially given the ""notoriety"" of the restaurant.  t's not like you work at Denny's!  I asked if it was possible to get fruit/strawberries to go with my waffle when I ordered, and the server's response was ""there's one strawberry that comes on top of the waffle"".  Any other communication out of the server's mouth consisted of what seemed like ""grunts"" with an attitude of ""I really could care less whether any of you enjoy your breakfast"". Took at least 20 mins before our food arrived at the table after having placed our order.

This place is IT and will provide you the absolute best brunch in town. 
Their proportions are ginormous no matter what you order so if you come with a friend, plan to split the plate or you'll be walking around the casinos with a handful of doggy bags.
I ordered the HH Original Benedict which was one of MANY styles of benedict they offered on their menu. The red pepper cream sauce was a sensational twist to a brunch time classic while underneath was a heavenly pile of country style biscuits, fresh spinach, tomato, and crispy bacon. They definitely did not skimp out on anything. 
The service was friendly and attentive and overall a great experience. 
And though I mainly rate restaurants based on service and quality of food,  if you are going for the environment, you will most certainly be puzzled. This place is definitely confused on whether it wants to be a diner or a mod/urban themed restaurant. The music was laughable, jumping from 80's synth pop to 90's rock ballads to early techno and somewhat distracting.

I truly would have given this place 4 stars but there was one minor detail about the menu that left me a little bit disappointed... While they had an extensive brunch menu that was served through lunch, if you do not make it to sit down before they change their breakfast menu, all of their breakfast items are served with scrambled eggs only and the chefs WILL NOT cater to your preference of any other style eggs. That's right, if you are drooling over all those eggs benedict specialties, you will be served your biscuits with SCRAMBLED instead of poached how it's supposed to be. Bad move, HH, but great creativity with the other items on your menu.",WR3eZ4tuyXaRWC2epO7EhA,0,0,3,YTSwQQhdE4sixV9CaZpulA

221702,2011-08-17,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Listen, I love to eat.  Especially breakfast.  Its my favorite meal of the day.  Yes, even better than dinner.  Pancakes, bacon, omlettes, hash browns, crepes, the whole breakfast menu I love.  And I'm here to tell you this place served me the single best breakfast I've had in my life so far.

I didn't even want to go here.  We were in Vegas checking out the new ""M"" casino and my wife said her old boss recommended this place for breakfast.  I heard the name of it, and just thought ok another hip diner joint trying to make a buck off their decor and loud music rather than the food itself.  Boy was I wrong.  I think I got the Country Hash Breakfast (?), and my wife got the Eggs Benedict something or other.  The meal names are long and not typical.  To drink they give you option of fresh squeezed orange juice and tangerine juice.  Never saw Tangerine juice on a menu before, so I got that.  Our food was so damn good I was so suprised.  My wife's eggs benedict were piled high on delicious mashed potatoes.  They give you a ton of coffee related drink options (lattes, cappicinos, etc.).  Please do yourself a favor and go to this place if you like breakfast like I do.  5-star hands down, best breakfast I ever had (so far).

Its kinda far down the strip at the beginning, like 2 miles before you get to Mandalay Bay, but the M casino is upscale and cool to check out.  Just a warning, there was a 45 minute wait on Sunday morning at like 11 am.  But they give you a beeper and you can cruise the casino while waiting.",SFGg2-ZfPVvHUeI0fhdFsQ,0,0,5,Cm1leYk-Bc8QOfoWhPKC1Q

I have been to both this location as well as the one in Imperial Palace and would definitely recommend this one by far. (Imperial Palace had equally good food, but MUCH lower quality service). The decor is a bit different for both locations, with the Sahara location being much bigger, livelier, and more attentive service. 

As soon as we got there, we ordered. My boyfriend got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and I got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles....sorry, my mouth started watering just thinking about it.... The wait for our food was unbearable, mostly because waiters were walking by with pancake platters  with pancakes that took up the entire plate (about a foot in diameter)! I ordered a mimosa to ease my nerve. It was okay - too much champagne. 

Finally, our food came. Two plates of enormous proportions - my chicken and waffles were the size of my head! It looked really good, though: four bacon waffles, topped with perfectly fried chicken topped with a not-too-sweet maple glaze. (They had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). The chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well. 

Looking at his benedict, though, I had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. It was amazing! A perfect biscuit, topped with sage fried chicken, two eggs, bacon mashed potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. (Oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). The flavors came together so well! 

We ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. It was worth it, though. It's been a week, and I'm having withdrawals. 

If you're looking for a GOOD meal or want to be filled for days, or both, then go to Hash House - you won't regret it.",ktdpBjBYIhjDiC0Iv_XhuA,1,1,5,xgoJv9Cxn0h2AMs_FHKBsQ

I have heard so much about the SD location and always see photos of the food in my FB news feed, so I guess I had higher expectations - or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Intimidated by the reviews of the portions, I decided to go with the house smoked salmon scramble (slightly healthier fare) instead of the infamous sage fried chicken/waffle combo.  Friends had the roasted chicken hash and the basic combo.  Each meal was served in a large skillet accompanied by a large, airy biscuit with a couple pieces of fruit.  Even though I wanted healthy, I couldn't help but wish for a saltier salmon scramble, a more buttery biscuit and mashed potatoes, a slice of pineapple that wasn't so sour...  The only thing that saved us all in the end were 2 pots of sausage gravy, strawberry jam, and Tabasco sauce.  Prices are expected -- $13-16 range -- very reasonable for the portions you get.  Next time, stick with the famous items.  And get extra gravy.

Service was great, no issues.  The lines for the hostess should be clearly marked, though -- people were lining up on 2 sides trying to put their reservations down, creating a bit of a mess in the small lobby.

Also - very little to no cell reception throughout the restaurant and much of the casino, so don't let your buddies wander off.",FFTX63pqjbhbBhdw-ZTXow,0,0,3,A1t0wZm8dSkOKWGa0YaD6Q

First we were told that the wait for 4 was no more than 20 minutes.  1 hour later I had to check on our reservation and was told three more people ahead of us.  FINALLY we were seated and ordered.  This is where the disaster started to get worse.  

My friend ordered the Waffles and Chicken and a pumpkin pancake and the rest of us ordered the Tractor.  The waffles and chicken arrive with a LONG BLACK HAIR in the food.  We sent it back and by this time lost our appetites.  One person who told us was the manager came over and apologized and did not offer to do anything.  We proceed through our meal and I have to say the pancakes were heavy dough and no taste.  When the bill arrived guess what the waffles and chicken and pumpkin pancake still on the bill.  We call over the ""so called Manager"" who told us she would have to get the Manager.  Lailani came over and said they just forgot to take it off the bill and would fix it.  Then we see the pumpkin pancake is still on there.  We asked why we were not compensated for that since it was part of the meal with the hair in it.  She said they do not give any compensation for food sent back and had a very arrogant attitude. She said corporate does not allow them to even offer a complimentary dessert or drink for any errors.  I don't think a HAIR in the food any just an ""error.""  

 We said that the staff did not have their hair covered in the kitchen and she was arguing with us and we had full view of the cooks behind the counter.  We then asked how we could reach the corporate office and who was the owner and ""she didn't know""  she was argumentative, rude and condescending.  I am in the food and beverage industry and if I treated my customers with the disrespect that Lailani did I am sure I would not have a job.  

Two of the three people with me were from out of town and we wanted to have a nice relaxing brunch which turned into a nightmare of an experience.  On the way out we asked who owned the restaurant and how to reach them and the hostess seemed to have full knowledge on how we could reach the person to file a complaint.  A complaint was filed on Monday with corporate but to date nothing received.  This restaurant needs to train their managers in customer server and respect for the customer.

290199,2015-07-13,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,Ate there for my birthday on July 4th. I was very very disappointed! Had the fried chicken & waffles with a side of eggs over medium. This dish was good when I had it last year but this time it was awful. The fried chicken was not crispy. The coating was soft & the chicken tasted undercooked. The waffles were just ok & the eggs were over easy & so runny they did not even seem cooked. Had to send them back. There was some kind of onion on top of the chicken that was so hard it did not even taste like real food. Had to take it all off & there was so much of it. My daughter had the same dish & also hated it. The waiter kept forgetting parts of our order had to wait a long time to get served even though the place was not busy. My husband had to send his eggs back as well & said his French toast was not good. His sausage was also undercooked. All in all it was an expensive meal that was just bad.

They actually have a ""late breakfast"" menu.  Eggs are only served scrambled for late breakfast, but that was fine with us.  They're served a little soft -- ""custard style"" I've heard it called before -- so if you want them firmer, you should probably order them that way.  But they're great as they serve 'em.

Portions are just as huge as you've heard they are.  And the prices are so reasonable it doesn't matter if you don't eat it all and have no refrigerator in your hotel room.  You won't feel like you've spent tons of money on food you couldn't finish.  They charge a split charge ($2.50) and if you're eating with someone who wants the same thing, it's probably worth splitting it.

We ordered a corned beef hash (served on halved potatoes with a biscuit the size of a large orange) and french toast combo (served with eggs, 2 pieces of bacon and a banana sliced in half and roasted, served in the skin), and both were great.  And the service was so friendly and quick!

The other wait staff on duty failed to come to our table for over 10 minutes even after we tried to get someones attention multiple times.

In particular, I strongly disliked my server.  I'm trying not to be overly critical out of spite, but sometimes it's difficult to disassociate a restaurant from the people they employ.  For starters, I get it they are going for a particular ""vibe"" with their front of the house staff, hiring people with an edgy look - but my guy gave me pause to wonder if he even cared about his hygiene.  

He struck me as snooty, which strikes me as ironic given the identity of the restaurant.  One thing that stuck out for me is two out of our four received our food, then a third came a couple minutes later, then the fourth in our party received his food seven minutes after the original drop off.  I actually looked at my watch and timed it. 

When questioned why the food didn't arrive all at the same time, our server let us know with a huff that they don't use heat lamps.  Like, how stupid am I?  I should be grateful that our food is coming out like this because they are way too clever to use a fundamental kitchen appliance that almost every other restaurant utilizes to ensure even service.  

So, while it might be nice that my food didn't get a bit dried out under the heat lamp, it wasn't so great that it got cold because I didn't want to be rude and eat while a member of my party had not received his food yet.  

As for the food, everyone did enjoy what they received.  Portions are generous, presentation is nice, and the prices are reasonable given the quantity you receive.",7jFoW90fQ4zR_3Dkz2W4nw,0,0,2,5TC3wO_nZWB6wWxEF48NPA

338723,2009-08-11,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Call me a food-snob if you must, but when I dine at a 'family-style' restaurant like Hash House A Go-Go, I generally do so with an open mind and without much expectation.  Having dined their before without incident, I would describe my previous experiences as 'benign', and would have gone back without a thought.

However, after my most recent 'late' breakfast there, I will never be back.  A guest's food allergy or dietary restriction should not be considered 'an inconvenience' to any restaurant, especially a family-oriented chain-style restaurant. (I just learned from a friend that HHAGG is NOT a chain.)

My friend and I planned to order 'The Original' Benedict, which features a biscuit, spinach, mashed potatoes, scrambled egg (which is the only kind of egg they offer for 'late' breakfast, which makes me wonder if the eggs are already pre-cooked), bacon, and a red pepper cream sauce. We asked for a simple substitution, and were met with a perplexed look on the face of our server  - we asked to have the bacon on the side (my friend cannot eat pork), and a substitution of the red pepper cream (I am allergic to red peppers) with the chile cream offered on another Benedict dish.

The waitress stopped writing the order down at one point and said she didn't think the 'chef' would accommodate our request, because it was ""changing the integrity of the dish!""  

Ok, granted, every restaurant should have a signature dish, but for goodness' sake - the service staff is using verbiage like 'chef' and 'integrity of a dish' in a scrambled-egg only, dry biscuit, ridiculously-gargantuan portioned,  family joint?  I politely asked the server to go ask the chef what he recommended for two guests with our dietary restrictions.

All said and done, they ended up 'allowing' our request of bacon on the side and a different sauce, only after we agreed to pay an additional fee for the substituted sauce.  Made me wonder if I would have ordered the dish which contained the sauce I had wanted, and substituted with the red pepper cream, would they have given me a discount?

Our bill for 2 coffees, 1 Original Benedict, 'a side of chile cream sauce', and a side of smoked salmon was $29.00 - oh, I almost forgot the 'token rosemary spring' stuck smack-dab in the middle of the food (I have been pondering how a rosemary sprig helps the 'integrity' of the dish)! 

Considering I had to wash the dry, brittle biscuit down with two glasses of water, the scrambled eggs were cold and brown, and even the rosemary sprig was wilting (what is the purpose of an inedible garnish anyway - have you ever eaten the raw sprig of parsley or kale obtrusively arranged on the side of your plate?), I would have to say that value was non-existent in this restaurant.

It has always been my belief that even the most rudimentary of restaurants understand that accommodating reasonable guest requests is a basic tenet of 'hospitality', especially in a troubled economic climate.",iZT3J9v_mFHPLw9PgaT9Iw,3,2,1,V9B4OD47KD-H2PHLjeZ4LA

Hash House has the potential to be a rock star place for brunch.  It is definitely attracting loads of people (waited about an hour).  I loved the fun drinks and all the menu choices.  It was hard for me to decide what to order as I saw the waiters delivering all the food around me.  I decided to order the vegetarian hash and couldn't wait for it to be delivered.  However, I was disappointed when the food showed up lukewarm.  The biscuit was cold (biscuits aren't good cold - they should be served HOT).  When I tasted some of my brother's pancake, it was also cold (although he said it was hot when it arrived -- I have a hard time believing that it cooled off that quickly).  

I would definitely try Hash House again.  The portions are huge and the is something for everyone to eat here.  But I hope the management will fix the operational issues -- make sure that food is being served HOT, please, (at the very least, heat up the plates/skillets in the oven so food doesn't cool off so quickly).",MI089mrfttCbB7CBTwn8FQ,0,0,4,j5nyWbrDXxlkJh79fAlyvw

I went with the Corned Beef which had, obviously, some deliciously prepared corned beef (like, not chopped up pre-packaged frozen stuff - it was as if it had been slow-prepared that day), swiss cheese, red onions (but not too much). The kicker is that it was served over a large amount of delicious oven-fried potato chunks rather than standard hash browns, all in a large square skillet (see picture).  Oh, and it also came with 2 eggs any style, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple fruit garnishes.  That all was around $13 I think, which might seem like a lot but as I said, it was outrageously proportioned. I didn't even touch the biscuit or the fruit, and it was still very filling.  The taste was great, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",YJUZ5yCTPywuKuHjbF5PtQ,1,0,5,KJz4lxLYfupil8aM_eFoYg

It was pack on Saturday and we waited for about 45 Min's and we were starving so we couldn't wait to eat. The drinks are good My OJ was fresh u can taste that they just made it and my cousin had the watermelon kiwi it was sweet but good. 

The food took about 25 Min's but they tell u that on the menu because they cook everything fresh so a Lil wait won't hurt. I got the MVF special which is the Andy sage chicken and omg that bad boy was da bomb. I thought the chipotle sauce may ruined it but no it made it better and the griddle mash on the bottom so freaking delicious they kept picking at it. It is a big portion but if u love to eat then get it. My cousin got the Chicken and waffles and since I live in L.A we have Roscoe's and they known for the waffles and chicken. My cousin said wtf is that bacon inside my waffle F***ing hell ya. The plate looks like a freaking sky scrapper when it comes out he said it was the best chicken and waffles he ever had but I still like Roscoe's but the best fried chicken is at HHGG IMO. 

My cousin In law got the tractor farm with the banana Cinnamon french toast and holy cow that toast had to be 3 inches thick it was ridiculously but I had a bite and it sent me to the moon it was that good.

If you just want heaps of food, go to Denny's and order two Grand Slams. You'll be better off. 

It shouldn't take 45 minutes to bring out a breakfast. The scrambled eggs should be edible. It shouldn't take an act of Congress to get a refill of a cup of coffee. Or some cream. Or some syrup. 

And the final straw was the argument with the waiter. I don't eat fruit. It's my quirk. My cross to bear. I get that. That's why I read the menu and order accordingly. So when I order the basic because it is the only thing that doesn't come with fruit, and then it comes out with pineapple on my bacon and biscuit. I'm not happy.

I didn't give them a 5 because of the managers lack of skill to handle situations. My family and I are staying in Vegas for the weekend and our hotel gave us vouchers for the hash house at the linq, we figured that one would have a long wait time so we decided to call the one on Sahara and ask them if they accepted them too. The hostess said she would ask the manger, we explained to the hostess that the vouchers were from the Hilton hotels but they included the hash house at the linq. They said they would take them... We got there and sat in separate tables because we were a big party and didn't want to wait long. Service and food were good but when it was time to pay we gave the voucher to the waitress and told her the story. The manager which had said we were fine to use them then came to the table and said they didn't accept them but would only take one from us so I said ok that's fine. Afterwards when our other half of the party was gonna pay the manger got upset because they were trying to use the same vouchers we had received from the hotel. I understood that there was a miscommunication over the phone and they couldn't use them. But the manager ( little manly looking lady) came over with an attitude and treating us like we are trying to play a trick on her and eat without paying. To the manager, first off you probably don't own the place so don't get your panties in a bunch over something that doesn't affect your life. Secondly, a good manager has better communication skills. No one in either party was giving her an attitude or being rude for her to take an aggressive and defensive tone. She told us that she wasn't going to take their voucher and that she was just gonna take ours and that's it! And we told her that's fine. At no time did we give her a hard time or resist to pay. She treated us like we didn't want to pay. My suggestion for this manager is that she should go take some communication classes at a school and to learn how to control her emotions when dealing with customers. She might cause the restaurant to lose more customers.

Yesterday was my Birthday,  so friends of ours suggested we do brunch there. After 45 minutes of waiting for a table. We sat down to the madness. The service staff all looked like they came out of punk rock band or belong in West Hollyweird. Guess the freakier you are, the better, for this place. The food made us so sick that both my husband and I suffered from the worse case of heartburn that we had to cancel my romantic Birthday dinner that night. I ordered the eggs scrambled and I asked if they sautéed the onions and our server said they could not for us. I was shock that she could not accommodate my needs. So I had order it without the onion. The Biscuit was dry and tasted like chalk; the garnish honey dew melon was not ripe and should not have been on the plate. The potatoes were liked twice deep fried and they were not hot, my eggs were not so hot either. I got the feeling that my food sat for a while. My husband ordered the Chicken and waffles. Ok people but sticking a spring of Rosemary in everything does not classy things up. The service was lousy. Out server did not anticipate any of our needs. For example filling up our beverages and all the things that should have come with our meal like syrup, butter, and more napkins. We had to ask her for everything.

532841,2012-01-03,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I want to start out my restaurant reviews - with my #1 pick to eat at in the Las Vegas Valley. The would be the Hash House a Go Go. The Hash House is located at four locations in the Las Vegas Valley. The first is at 6800 West Sahara Blvd. just East of Rainbow Blvd. The second is in the Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino located at 3535 Las Vegas Blvd S. The third location is in the M Resort and Casino located at 12300 Las Vegas Blvd. S in Henderson. And the newest is at the Plaza Hotel and Casino at the end of Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. They have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Come dine for breakfast on a 'Roasted Chicken, garlic, onion, asparagus and Rosemary' Hash for only $12.95.

Or dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'Apple Smoked Bacon and Mashed Potato' burger also for only $12.95. No need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (Prices are subject to change) How about for dinner you try one of their 'Sage Fried Chicken Linguine'. All of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.

They say that they serve ""Twisted Farm Food"". I'm not sure if I would call it twisted, but it is some of the best I have had. Not only is the food some of the best, I have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. My beverage was never empty and when they asked if I needed something more I never felt as if I were being pressured. They truly wanted to help me. Even if they were just pretending, I could not see it. So, if you are looking for something unique and great tasting, get on down to one of the three locations of the Hash House a Go Go.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,5,c35QO5EvzwQpM2Cr-plp_A

I had the chicken and bacon waffles. It's a beautiful presentation with the two fried breasts piled on top of three bacon stuffed waffles, all topped with fried green onions on a very large plate.

This order usually comes with the syrup poured over the order. I asked them not to do that so my waffles don't get too mushy. 

Even though it came out as ordered, the waffles were horribly mushy. It seemed like they were made way before my order was taken and sat around in the kitchen for a long time. Then they were just thrown on my plate. 

So the waffles were not edible, in fact they were YUKKY! And this is from a food that will eat anything .

The fried chicken was OK. Again, the bottom of the chicken that was touching the waffles were very moist. It did not seem like the chicken was freshly cooked, rather, it sits on top of those very un-crisp waffles for a while before it comes out of the kitchen.

Unfortunately they also forgot my biscuit until I mentioned it. They then brought it out and it was reallly dry. Again, seemed like it could have been better if it had been quicker.

598605,2011-11-10,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"The Hash House A Go Go has an interesting menu and has been on a travel channel show, but in my opinion, it is more fluff than substance and your typical example of ""sounds better on paper.""  You get large portions at a premium price for your typical diner (aka Denny's style) food dressed up with a sprig of sage - it's not bad but you might feel a bit disappointed if you were expecting something awesome.  Stay away from some of the gimmicky items, and you will have an experience similar to an IHOP.

As a person who usually orders waffles, I have to say this: order the pancakes.  The waffles have a slight baking soda taste, and when you get the bacon cooked in the waffle, it makes the flavor more pronounced.  Most people are too hung-over or impressed by the serving size to care.  It took me 2 visits to come to the conclusion that decent pancakes trump weird waffles, and trust me, you don't want to order the bacon waffle unless you really like grease.  Despite the yummy sounding menu, the best items to get are their ""regular"" dishes like an omelet or eggs and bacon.  Their food tends to be bland, as if adding salt or ketchup is a requirement.  The chicken is ok for the first couple of bites, but it's actually a bit too dry and bland to enjoy without dipping it in something.  The omelets and pancakes were never bad during my visits.

The service is efficient and professional, though not particularly friendly.  If this place is on your ""Vegas to do List"" then you should try to come during non-peak meal hours to avoid lines and a busy waitress.  

I know The Hash House A Go Go tries to create a nice breakfast/diner experience but the inconsistent flavors makes it difficult to really like.  If you're here to experience Vegas, then stick with some basic breakfast or menu items and you should be fine.  It's not a bad place, but I think it is more hype than taste.  There are cheaper and tastier places to have breakfast, but then again, Hash A Go Go does provide some very interesting menu options.  You should go just to see how big some of these dishes are.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,0,2,0U9xzcLwLjGbuec-oE4G4g

Awesome drink list and my favorite was the bud heavy in a bag. Get the sage chicken even though you might think it's too heavy (it's not). My personal tip is do not order the bloody mary with stone ale. My girlfriend made the mistake of thinking it was topped with stone ale and it's exactly how the bartender explained it to her just in case, beer with non alcoholic bmary mix and she still ordered it and he still offered to get her another drink! Other big tip is that this is not on the strip and it's about 20 bucks just one way on the cab.

612147,2014-02-12,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Short: Sub-par food in large proportions dressed up for no reason with a loud atmosphere. 

Visited this place with a friend after we've been curious of it after a long time. Disappointed, big time. Food was decent, service was decent, place the decent, atmosphere was loud. 
I ordered some chorizo hash, and my friend had french toast. The hash had deep-friend potatoes (probably from frozen), with some sauce and cheese on top. The chorizo was the soft type that just turned into liquid after it was cooked so there was only a few chunks left. It was alright, not mind blowing.
My friend's french toast was worse. It was made of thick slabs of bread (good, right?) that had barely touched egg before they were fried--it was pretty much bread with a egg coating on the outside. If you didn't know: French toast is bread SOAKED in egg, and fried. But this was barely touched, so it was like eating hot bread rather than eggy goodness. The toppings were a bit bland as well.

Bottom line: If you want to go to a place that puts more priority on decorating, than actually making your food taste good, go here. Big proportions that don't need to be that big, dressed up for no reason, decent food.

Next time, we're probably going to head to Ihop or Denny's. Same food quality, better service, cheaper, and they don't play with our food.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,3,niMbqz249l0P2u4ARVefdA

Now that the back story is out of the way onto the review.

Let me tell you what trying this place is definitely not something we regret. 

I'll start off with the staff, we got there around 10:30 a.m. it was packed, so it was a few minutes before we were greeted ( which is understandable). The hostess greeted us and told us it would be about 15 minutes. Which wasn't a problem, we waited a few minutes and then asked if we could just sit at the bar, and were told that was fine. The bartended was a fun upbeat guy, he asked us where we were from what we were doing in Vegas and even congratulated us on our wedding, in not so short the staff was awesome..

Now the food. If your going to eat here either bring your appetite or a large friend with you because the portion size is massive.. The coffees they offer are absolutely delicious.. I don't remember the name of the dish we ordered ( yes just one cause damn) but it had chicken, asparagus, potatoes, two eggs and a  biscuit the size of a baby's face.. It was a pretty tasty meal.

Pros:  Great food.  Huge, huge portions.  I have never gotten anything here that I haven't liked.  Their chicken and waffles and stuffed meatloaf are to die for.  Tasty, tasty biscuits served with honey before your dinner.  Also, they have a constantly changing specials menu.  Sometimes they have great soups and some great dishes.

-Their breakfast is also great.  Again, huge portions.  They also have fresh jam, which I personally appreciate.  

-Their dessert is also to die for (try the Snickers bread pudding, the impending diabetic coma will be worth it, I promise).  

Cons:
-Sometimes, the wait can be a little long.  Beware if you attempt to have breakfast on Sunday.  If you choose to do so, either arrive early or be prepared to wait.  

-The service can be a bit inattentive sometimes due to the size of the restaurant.  Our servers have always been friendly, but it can sometimes be hard to get their attention.  I overlook this because the food is so damned good.

After a couple of all nighters out and about it wasn't until the last day of our trip that we decided to go to Hash House a go-go. Walking in and being mesmorized by the vast amount of pictures staring back at us, we made our way to the table.

As we sat, we noticed a gigantic edible sombrero looking dish that had some kind of delicious food in it. Then and there I knew that this was going to be a place that would get our alcohol drenched insides back to a legal state.

As we got our menu, we closely examined what each meal consisted of. Even though it was late afternoon, our drenched insides were burning yearning for breakfast, with a salad on the side.

A few words to describe that god damn delicious salad. ""Oh my, yum yum then some!"" The CROUTONS, tasted like they came down from the heavens on a lovely white cloud with trumpets blaring announcing that they have made it to the party, also known as the house salad. Word to the wise though, Do not eat, however tempting it might be, do not eat the sticks that accompany that heavenly salad.

Not even halfway through eating the heavenly salad, Ferb's tractor breakfast combo, with the biggest pancake known to man, along with eggs, potato and a scrumptious strawberry, came to the table first.  A couple of minutes later, Phineas's mountain of eggs, biscuit and potato joined in. After stealing a couple of Phineas's food, I knew it was the start of a food coma.

One delicious bite after another, I came to the realization that this was the cure of the alcohol and other unmentionable things that we needed. Bang for the buck, this is the place, and we needed this after a crazy night at the penny slots. That's a whole different story.

45 minutes of nonstop eating ended up in laying down on the benches outside the restaurant. With the strip in our sights we knew it was time for more alcohol and penny slots.

The portions are huge. I had the Corn Beef Hash with eggs over easy. It was really big and really good. I didn't eat the biscuit because I was really full. Maybe I nibbled on it...not sure really...One of the guys ordered a Chorizo Hash that looked really good. 

The server we had was ok. She was nice but she did miss a few things. She forgot the tangerine juice and my brother got potato wedges instead of the grilled mash potatoes. When we mentioned about the potatoes she admitted quickly that it was already wrong. Makes me feel that she knew already the order was wrong when she took it out but didn't make an attempt to correct it with the kitchen.

After eating the food, you will also a-go-go (to the restroom). 

All three of us had some problems in the restroom after eating the food, but let me tell you, it was worth it! The portions are big and it is considered cheap for that price! There were three of us and we are quite petite, so we could have just ate ONE plate. Talk about deal steal.

It was at about 1:00pm on Labor Day that we reached to the restaurant. They still handed us the breakfast menu. (I didn't know they had other menus until looking at their website- Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner). So, we heard that this place  had HUGE portions. They are not kidding. 

We ordered two plates: The oh so famous Sage Fried Chicken with Waffles. They stab the chicken pieces onto to the waffles. Since I am Chinese it wasn't very pleasing to the eye that there is a knife stabbed right into the chicken (signifying death) but the flavors compensated for that! We also ordered the Roasted Chicken. The Roasted Chicken came with a watermelon, two eggs, hash browns, and asparagus. 

Both chicken tasted basically the same except for the skin textures. I must say the fried chicken was the best even though it is a bit dry. The waffles were really good and it does not compare to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles back in Los Angeles! It's also quite cheap since it is $15.00 per plate on average! 

This restaurant is one of the best OUTSIDE (and probably the BEST priced) in Las Vegas. Definitely a must try. 

One note: The wait time is ridiculously LONG. If you go, you should go at around 3pm-4pm. That's when there is not that many people. We waited for about 40 minutes for our seat (and we ended up sitting at the bar area).  The food wait was about 30 minutes so expect at least an hour wait time of ... doing nothing.",Pe-2bYsHk8b52UVfYtbFZw,0,0,4,cSjHf-3ndv9BF326pJW5wA

I got the tractor driver with waffles and potatoes, playing it safe, just in case.

- Potatoes tasted fresh and didn't have any extra nonsense added to it. 
- Eggs, they were nothing special, so plus for not messing it up, I guess. 
- Waffles, one word, thick. 

There is just so much to choose from. I do recommend the watermelon kiwi lemonade. Not only is it really really pretty when they first serve it, but it's also really good and quenches your thirst! Fresh watermelon too.

I also went here with my group on this weekend trip to Vegas.  We came here for brunch, was around noon and the place was hopping.  Fortunately my friend's friend had arrived earlier to put our name on the wait list for a party of 8. I definitely recommend getting here early, or making a plan to wait for a table.  They close at 2:30 on Sundays and the place was still full when we left here close to 2.

Had been told the portions here were ginormous and that you should share..but when it comes to breakfast, I get serious.  When it comes to anything eggs benedict?  I get even seriouser...lol.  I had every intention of finishing this.  When the plate arrived, I was scared.  If you just look at the pictures you will see what I mean.  I ordered the original HH Benedict which was served on their homemade biscuit with spinach, bacon, griddled mashed potatoes (I opted for the crispy thinking I was going to get something more along the lines of hash browns,  but they were just red potatoes.  Were still good though) and covered in this chili cream sauce.  The presentation was beautiful.  And did I mention huge?  Oh yeah, I did.  Their specialty here seems to be the fried chicken benedict, which, by the way, comes with scrambled eggs also.  I just couldn't fathom eating all that but my tablemates who ordered it definitely enjoyed!  I also tasted someone's pancake.  So fluffy and yummy.  And huge.  The guy at the table behind us ordered some kind of burger and as soon as I saw it I knew...I have GOT to bring my husband here when we come to Vegas next time..not to mention anyone else I may be travelling with.

They had a large variety on their menu, was very hard to choose.  Lots of different fun coffee drinks and oh..the tangerine juice is so sweet and delicious.

Sure it was HUGE and it was filling, but as far as the tastebuds go, they weren't dancing...more like bobbing to the beat..no, not even that.  Sorry!
I ordered the veggie house hash (was that my mistake?) and dude ordered the bacon waffle and eggs.  It was okay, but, again, we've both had much better breakfasts.

The biscuits and gravy were great.  My corned-beef hash dish came out a tad cold.  But the Hash House is really about quantity over quality, with portions ranging from large to HUGE.

Unfortunately, our entire experience was ruined by a group of douchebags sitting at a nearby table.  It was 10am, and they were clearly drunk, probably having gotten started the night before (It IS Vegas, after all).  They were incredibly loud and disruptive, dropping F-bombs, N-bombs (they were NOT African American, by the way), and other ethnic slurs just to make sure every race was covered.

All the while, the restaurant management did nothing.  We know for a fact that the manager on duty heard all the noise, because serving station was nearby and he actually brought us much of our food.  The wait staff, many of whom must have been insulted by the cussing and racist comments, said nothing.  Despite the fact that families with children, couples, and tables of mixed ethnicity were all sitting nearby, no one from the restaurant staff made any effort to ask these jerks to keep it down or to at least tone down their language.  Was it really up to us to confront these obnoxious people if we wanted to eat in peace?  Was the management going to just stand by and say nothing until someone made a stink about it?  I guess so...

They guys left before anyone confronted them, but the damage was done.  I think a restaurant owner or manager who truly cares about his/her customers would have done something about it rather than let 4 or 5 losers completely ruin a meal for the 20+ people around them.",Skf3Ov_0jGKCeIl1-IIyjQ,1,0,2,v8LRHaAOgdIFXBJOjt0EUw

As you sit and wait for your order of food, nothing is more refreshing on a hot summer day is the kiwi watermelon lemonade. Just the look of the drink make you want to dive into it immediately. Easy to make recipe with such great combination. Bottom layer filled with 10 percent kiwi juice (POM carries their own kiwi juice), middle layer with 50 percent lemonade, and top layer with 50 percent watermelon juices (appears to be smash watermelon). Another tempting drink on their menu is the Bloody Mary, and it's not for the fainted heart or airline bloody Mary. For $8, you get a large glass of alcohol goodness.
The Sage Chicken and waffles is number one choice for New York time with its reasons, it's layered with 4 bacon waffle. The waffle is perfectly made with its crisp on the outside and still piping hot in the middle with a few crunchy savory bites of bacon insides. These are not bacon bits; it's a large piece of crispy bacon that almost filed the whole waffle. Then we have 2 pieces of crispy chicken breast. From man vs. Food, they first seasoned the breast with garlic, sage, and some secret spice, and then soaked in an egg wash; they then breaded the chicken with corn flakes and flour, and then fry the chicken. My only disappointment is that the breast was a bit dried. But I'm never a fan of chicken breast, I want my dark meat. The chicken is the drizzle with some maple syrup which gives it's sweet and savory combination, and I am a lover for sweet and savory meal. The plate is garnish with a handful of fried leeks, which my husband love very much and hope to incorporates it in his dish someday. I also enjoy their little side dish of biscuit and gravy. This restaurant if definitely worth a return for me to try every dish on their menu. My next must try dish will be the stack fried green tomatoes. I will definitely give their original restaurant in San Diego a try. I've also tried the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict as mention on man vs. Food, but since the order was a take out, it wasn't memorable. What I enjoy from the take out was the French toast with banana and walnut inside. Their portion is enough to feed two, do expect to walk out with a doggy bag.

We got to the restaurant at 3:30, in between lunch and dinner and we were forced to order from the brunch menu. My sister does not eat eggs and asked if she could have the dinner chicken and biscuits. She was told no and that the closest thing was a Benedict dish. She said can I get it without the eggs. The waitress said that their dishes were works of art and nothing could be removed or substituted. My brother in law wanted a biscuit, since we were outside of dinner, he was denied an order of biscuits, even after we offered to pay for them since it was his birthday. Overall, this experience made his birthday one we will always remember due to the unprofessional behavior of its servers, its inflexibility of its chef and the poor times of its menu window. It's such a shame that Hash House has been brought to this level since by the pictures in the lobby, they were amazing!",S_RNkwrDryJVdxKW1nD2Cw,0,0,2,sAzAq6HH138V-WmgD-w0gw

I ordered a glas of OJ (about a pint arrived) An apple/ cinnamon Pancake (the size of a single Duvet) and a Corned beef hash Breakfast (a mountain of Hash, 3 Eggs 3 Sausages).


 I was getting full after the pancake and I would not have ordered so much if I had known how much food they give you.

It wasn't cozy and I don't remember the service if it was good or bad, so I'm just going to say it wasn't remarkable (being that I can't remember)

I chose to go here a second time only because my friend LOVES this place and wanted to meet up for breakfast.  I agreed because I'm not one to argue.  I don't remember what she ordered but it looked okay.  I think it was a massive omelet with avocado.  I ordered a pancake :) Yes just a pancake because after my first experience I didn't trust any of the other weird creations on the menu.  To my surprise the massive pancake tasted just fine, but honestly how do you screw up a pancake.  I was pleasantly surprised my second time so I may consider going again IF it's not my choice.

For breakfast, I like their scrambles better than the hash. But my favorite for breakfast is the sage fried chicken benedict. It's a huge piece of boneless chicken on top of a buttermilk biscuit, topped with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, bacon and mozzarella cheese. It comes with a side of griddled (mashed) potatoes. It is all drizzled in a chipotle cream sauce, which is a little spicy. IT IS HUGE!! You will be eating leftovers! 

For lunch I like the one pound stuffed hamburgers with a side of au gratin potatoes. The ham and egg stuffed hamburger is very good. 

Is any of this stuff good FOR you? Probably not. They do have some salads with vinaigrette dressings for the more healthy diets, but most of the menu is heavy meals and outrageous portions.

Finally tried out Hash House a go go for lunch yesterday. Had read great reviews and many a celebrity have endorsed it. 
The interior is great and the service is pretty good too. That is why I gave Hash 3 stars, but the food did not appeal that much to me and I consider it forgetable.
I tried the mushroom and goat cheese sandwich and have no complaints about my dish, The potatoes au gratin looked very cheesy, but tasted good as the cheese wasn't not all overpowering as I had expected. My wife tried the chicken and waffles and we both agreed: nothing special! The all white meat chicken and waffles were both too dry and bland and we prefer Roscoe's for sure.  
For the average 'white' person, this food probably tastes great, the presentation looked above par, but for those among us who consider themselves foodies, the wide gamut of Asian food offered in this city is soo much more appealing.

He had the Mushroom, Sundried Tomato, Artichoke, & spinach Hash  with scrambled eggs, biscuit that had a peach jam (with actual cut peaches in it). It was delicious & ended up taking half to go, then ate some of mine.

I had the meatloaf sandwich.  OMG. The bread was a milk bread (huge thick slices toasted) with the meatloaf, cooked cheddar cheese, & tomato sauce.  The side of mac & cheese was delicious, but I suggest unless your hungry don't order it.  The sandwich was enough for 3 servings. 

We sat at the bar since it was full around1:30p.m..

We noticed how they make an ice coffee while sitting at the bar, and let me say it looked yummy.  

The menu is moderate, but I can say this, I will be back for something else from that menu.

Portions are humongous and that's an understatement. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles. It could easily feed 2+ people - comes with 2 pieces of chicken and 4 bacon waffles. I could only finish one waffle and chicken. 

They have mimosas. That's always a plus.

Hot sauce isn't automatically a condiment that comes with the meal which is a boo but they had sriracha when I asked. So all good. 

Had to ask for extra maple syrup. I'm not a syrup whore but for the amount of food, I had to ask for more syrup.

I've been coming here for 11 years now and have not only received the best service each and every time, but I have had the most delicious, exceptionally prepared food for breakfast I've ever been exposed to. This place has the best, THE BEST, food, of any place I've ever been willing to drop $50 bucks on. I'm not joking. I'm assuming that if the menu is the same at the Strip locations, it's the same, but I've been coming here without fail to spend about $600 bucks a year on the most delicious breakfast yummies I've ever had the chance to experience. When I come here, it's to basically nut in my pants while eating the best breakfast food ever created.

Biscuits are hand made daily. The jam is made by hand based on the fruits that are in season. The chicken is, no joke, the best you'll have, ever. Presentation is magnifico, towers of food, uncooked pasta and herbs garnished, ginormous plates. I've never had a *meh* or middle of the road entree here, and while the servers aren't looking to stalk me on FB as some people would prefer, they are professional and courteous.

I come still after 4 years of the same thing, bad ""we don't get it service"".
The hostess are the snobbiest girls ever and are ridiculous. They are rude and kind of single people out to sit first and they make up policy as they go.
I came with my friend we both come a lot this is just one example (the most recent), so she put in the name and when it was time to sit the girl said no because I wasn't here, said you can't sit until your entire party is present, so this is a party of 1 versus a party of 2, it's the same table.  That rule is so that one person cannot reserve a huge table for like 7 people when other people are waiting it is irrelevant in this situation.
My friend complained while I was on my way and they sat her, but why did that have to be so hard?
I've had hostess answer the phone and refuse to take carry out but they take phone carry out orders regularly.  I've called to ask what time can I come in on Sunday before they close and they said by 2:30 and get there at 2:15 and they are at the door saying they aren't letting anyone else in, and I say I just called a half hour ago to ask, it doesn't make sense? The hostess make policy as they go.
And the music sucks always.
This place is 5 capable though.
Funny thing is I told the manager again about the problem and she was sorry, didn't do anything but said they are aware that they have bad hostesses and continue to tell them to give better service but that they are hard to find, she actually said this.  I was shocked that there wasn't a solution apparent to her, but okay.  Hence my review.",96a9vXOEz-5BjRsydkd6Ew,3,0,2,ETW3-ClgQFmUFW6NXTP30A

852523,2006-12-19,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  
i was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, Worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.
i ended up choosing the HH Famous Meatloaf with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the Farmer's Daughter House Hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  Both came on a huge skillet (which they called their ""smaller"" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  My other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with smoked salmon and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!
this ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted pork tenderloin, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,2,2,5,i1i0BIeK-2K8HZqc0rp9aQ

My wife and I shared the Sage fried chicken and waffles, because I read on yelp how huge the order is.  My kids pancakes where huge.  My 6 year old some how managed to finish his pancake, and he's a skinny boy.  Even the waitress was impressed he was able to finish such a large pancake.  I had a taste of the two different pancakes and they were good, were they the best I've ever had, no, but they aren't bad.  As for the Sage fried chicken and waffles, yelpers were not kidding, this is a huge order,  it's definitely perfect for 2 people to eat.  The Sage fried chicken was extremely tasty and the waffles were like heaven, especially with the bacon made into the waffles.  The combination of the Sage friend chicken, waffles, bacon and syrup was delicatable.  I have been to Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles several times, and I have to admit, this place blows away Roscoes for the fried chicken and waffles dish.

A friend and I went for ""linner,"" late lunch/early dinner. I wasn't famished, so had the ""tractor driver's breakfast:"" 2 eggs, 2 sausages and a waffle. No biscuit, no hasbrowns, just eggs, sausage and waffle. $12.99. The sausages were delicious. The waffle was large, but nothing special. The eggs were tiny. Two of them equaled one regular sized egg. Maybe they were pigeon eggs or something.

My friend wanted a hamburger, but all their burgers are ""double"""" 2 meat patties with stuff in between -- mushrooms, onion, cheese... Again, if you want to eat so much that you are uncomfortable for the next 8 hours, this is your place. She ordered the one single burger -- I think the ""baby burger"". $11.99. She said it was alright -- nothing special.

We both had coffee ($3). So the bill came to nearly $33 for a very ordinary meal. With tip, nearly $40. Coulda got the same thing at Denny's for half that and would've been happy. 

IF you go, order one of their signature plates (sage chicken, etc.) and be prepared to take 1/2 home. If you go on a weekend, you will wait a long time to be seated; it will be LOUD. Music blares. Conversation is not possible. This is my third and last visit. (Just say I believe in second and third chances. Or maybe I'm just a slow learner.)

The initial sticker shock was quickly eased ( about 15 bucks a plate) with the mountain of food that the waiters brought us. I had the sausage gravy pot pie which had many golf ball size sausage balls in a delicious country gravy, a pile of scrambled eggs, and not one, but 2 giant scoops of roughly mashed potatoes. This was so big that I ate my left overs the next day and STILL have another meal. My only complaint on that was that the pot pie crust was pretty hard and cooked separate so not really a compliment to the meal. 
The wife got a stuffed quesadilla that hung over the giant plate. it was covered in a delicious queso sauce with just the right amount of kick. My favorite part was that they put fresh jalapeno chunks in the quesadilla. 
My mother in law got the salmon scramble which was more salmon than eggs I think. But really delicious.  
We all had left overs which were still awesome the next day. Definitely a must do in Vegas.

909946,2013-03-27,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,Wow. Now me and my wife went to las vegas in the summer of 2012 and we made a special trip to hash house a go go becuse of the man vs food tv program. We spent 7 days in vegas and it was the only restaurant that we attended twice in a week. I must admit the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. I mean people have said to me American portions are big; but I have never been over faced too much. Hash house blew the size competition out of the water.  What about the food? I hear you ask. Well my Sarah had the blue cheese salad with extra fried chicken on top and we both agreed that it was the best salad we both had ever tasted.  Yes the best combinations ever. The salad was heavenly. 10 out of 10. Now to my dish; the famous fried sage chicken with waffles and bacon. It was good but not the best because the saltiness of the bacon just doesn't gel with the sweet pancakes. Dont get me wrong but I still highly recommend it to anyone. The fried chicken itself was very good but not the best in the world. Service was friendly but felt like it was all about the tip. Also the waiting on staff told us that food will just arrive on our table not together cause the chefs doesnt like leaving food hanging around on the hot pass. More like the chefs cant get their timing right!!!!. Conclusion: very good food. Huge portions and let your hair down and stuff your face. Will go back.,vyovc_5w8j1otKnfQqGsTA,0,0,4,yVGcgWcXIzvU7U_K3Xz3lw

I've been to Hash House a Go Go previously for a business dinner, but it was my husband's first time(and last, unfortunately).  I had the Blue Crab Cakes(which were very good) and my husband ordered the swordfish.  His swordfish was horribly undercooked, it was so rubbery it could not be cut with a knife, so he sent it back.  The second  piece was still undercooked in the center, but by this point, we really just wanted to get our check and go.  Our server let us know the chef would be buying our dessert for the problem with the swordfish.  My husband ordered the cheesecake.  Ten minutes later, we were told they were out of cheesecake.  I don't know if it was an off night in the kitchen or what, so we ordered the cobbler and then 10 minutes later, told it was going to be another 10 minutes while it was heated in the oven. The cobbler was fine, but we felt our dinner out was a huge let down.

That's the best advice I can give to anyone that wants to visit Hash House a Go Go.  You will have more food on your plate than you can comprehend in a glance.  Galaxies have been known to be smaller.  The gravitational pull of the chicken and waffles may trap you in its orbit, forcing you to consume the chicken just to have a chance to escape intact... not that you'll mind doing so.

We've been to HHaGG multiple times for both breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and have never run into a meal we didn't like.  Their reliance on potatoes as a filler sometimes borders on the crazy however.  I'm tempted to ask for my next meal without any potatoes, if it's listed as an ingredient.

The meals we've experienced are the stuffed burgers, fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles (with strips of bacon through the waffles), the chicken pot pie, the home-made corn beef hash, and some of the specials.  The chicken soup was also very flavorful.

I can't think of anything I'd improve on when it comes to the food.  Just remember that your eyes are larger than your stomach.  No one's going to think less of you if you suggest splitting an entree here!",GYXEHceoLVJ00e5YuV-TAw,0,0,4,6D5DYgHcUmLi8m7Adjw6LQ

Everything about this joint is mediocre, the decor, the food, the service.

This thing was huge, it was like three pounds of elephant dung. Are you kidding me? Who does't salt and pepper a burger? It tasted like nothing! Not only that but they had the nerve to put a pickle on it, Wanna know what goes on a Mushroom and Swiss Hamburger????? Hamburger, a bun, and MUSHROOM AND FREAKING SWISS!! Not a pickle! And to boot, you pay 10 dollars for a hamburger, then you have to pay an extra almost 4$ for lame lame lame french fries, or whatever whack side they have available! She wanted ranch for her fries but all they had was this lame cucumber ranch...WHO MAKES CUCUMBER RANCH!!!! No one but them thats who! Want to know how easy ranch is? Mayo, buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, maybe some chopped up fennel fronds, bit of pepper, hey you have ranch! Easy, no cucumber needed, have some on deck for those that may want some freaking ranch, Their head chef needs to be fired, or whatever crackpot conned his way into being the corporate chef that makes all of the decisions for the restaurant. I got the chicken and waffles, the only saving grace was the sage fried chicken, it was delicious. The parts that I hated were....1. The mount Vesuvius portion of super soggy bacon waffles, which the bacon did nothing to help because it was equally as soggy. 2. The over fried leeks that I had to cough up several times. 3.  The ridiculously small amount of syrup they want to throw your way to soak up the mountain of gluten they expect you to choke down. 4. The unfiltered swamp water Las Vegas likes to claim as its own for their water choice. 5. The stupid stupid stupid, unnecessary grape tomatoes that grace the plate on the left and right side for no reason what so ever. 5. The eight inch sprig of insanely ridiculously, unnecessary rosemary that was jammed into my waffles....WHY????????????????????????? What was the point???????????????? Get it off of there, away from there. Its fresh rosemary, not cooked in anything, its just there. I took it out and threw it to the side. This place is awful.

SO FREAKING GOOD!
My friend SusanL and I decided we would hit up Hash House a Go Go. I have never been but have seen all the hype on the food network, so ... we went.
We already know that the portions are ridiculously huge... so what else can I tell you?
The food is amazing !
I got the pork loin- It came with mashed potatoes- spinach- carmelized onions- roasted pepper- and some kind of cheese and a horseradishy sauce. 
I was a little worried that I would not like it... 
I was wrong . 
Now mind you I could only eat about a 1/4 of it. But what I ate was delicious. Perfectly mixed flavors to create a unique but amazing dining experience. My friend got the roasted butternut squash stuffed with risotto.  We shared a little with each other.  
I couldn't decide which one I liked better, but I was not sorry with what I got. 
I got an ice tea to drink, but was not impressed as it had a smokey flavor and I really would like my tea to taste like tea.
I also was NOT impressed with our server, It could be that she was having a bad day? Or she does not like being a server- she was kind of non existant.  I told her I needed to place an order to go, and she looked surprised that I needed a menu...  um ok? 
Then she waited til the end of our meal to put in the order - which we had to wait longer to leave. 
That was the only bad part.  Our bus-boy was great and it was fun to watch him lift our heavy plates.

My friends and I arrived around 12:00pm or so and the place was super busy. There was a 30 minute wait which gave me more than enough time to look over the menu so that I could be ready to order once we sat down.

For drinks we ordered the Watermelon Kiwi Limeade and the Smores Espresso. Both drinks were amazing and I would highly recommend both. However, just know that there are no refills on specialty limeades.

For food we ordered the Trucker Combo with the Snickers Flapjack and the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The snickers flapjack was enormous! It was probably larger than my face, it was larger than the plate it was served on. It came with 2 eggs and sausage. Very filling combo with a nice sweet touch added from the snickers. I had a few bites of the Fried Chicken meal. This combo was an enormous serving of fried chicken, bacon, biscuits and mashed potatoes. The meal as a whole tasted pretty good but I would have to say that on an individual level, I was a bit disappointed in the chicken. The chicken was supposed to be the highlight of the dish but it unfortunately tasted the most bland. 

All in all, I wouldn't mind going back to Hash House A Go Go but it probably won't always be at the top of my list of choices simply because the type of food served is something that can be found at other establishments and I am just not over my disappointment in the fried chicken.

We all have worked in the restaurant industry and never look for a free meal but how bout a little discount or something. NOTHING!  Had to ask for the manager again to come over.  Lets sum this up, none of us will ever come back and we will take our business down the road to a much better breakfast joint on West Flamingo.  If you want a crappy strip experience with huge portions of so so food then this is definetely your place.  We gladly will give this restaurant back to the strip folk.

968666,2012-06-16,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Having seen the restaurant on MVF, I knew I had to make it a stop if I ever got to Vegas.  I spent the last week there for a family gathering, and kept trying to find some time to break away to get there.  I told my wife that we WOULD be going on our way out of town.  We got there at about 10 am on a Thursday.  We walked right in and there was no wait to be seated.  The ambiance is cool, and everything seems like it was well thought out.  It was clean, and the staff was very friendly.

I ordered the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.  All I can really say is, do it.  Eat this magnificent blend of flavors and textures.  Come hungry, it's a beast... but you will leave with a smile.  The fried chicken is juicy, firm, and the breading is light and subtle.  The hint of sage really adds a lot.  It might be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten... but that's a tough call.  The griddle mashed potatoes are excellent.  They get the texture perfect, and they are just the right amount of salt.  The chipotle sauce on the top is great also.

My wife had the meatloaf and eggs breakfast.  The meatloaf was delicious.  It was not mushy or runny or falling apart.  It was a firm patty, neatly grilled to a delicious brown crust.  Served with the griddle mashed potatoes, she really enjoyed it.  (And I enjoyed the leftovers.)

What really speaks to the level of service at this place is the experience my mother in law had.  She has celiac, and cannot eat any gluten.  She made her allergy known to our waiter, who took the time to double-check with the chef about what dishes had flour.  She settled on a scramble that had asparagus, pot roast, cheese, tomato, and obviously, egg.  She remarked that the vegetables were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.

Other recommendation:  Get a S'Mores Mocha.  Wow.

Overall - it was worth the wait.  And given that I paid with my craps winnings, it was the right price.  Stop by if you're in Vegas, San Diego, Chicago, or anywhere else they open one of these.  It's worth the time.",7OXcPFjPW6-vIflrUptHvA,1,1,4,nvLTXe6mZ-CILUlkB-i7Cg

She came up to the table and didn't even introduce herself and briefly asked what we want for drinks.  After waiting 15 min she finally came with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  Yes we are!! We finally ordered and she finally gave me some suggestion on how big of a portion I would get which was nice. When we got our food it was very plain it didn't have any flavor I order the number 5 burger the guacamole was old and black. The waitress never came back to check on us. I had to Hunt her down. I finally got the bill and she charged me for an extra meal.  It took her another 15 min to adjust it. I would have to say the portions are huge but I'd rather get best tasting food for what I paid.

997090,2009-02-05,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"If you've never been to Hash House a Go Go, you have to go.  It will flabbergast you and fits in with excessiveness in keeping with the Vegas tradition.  

I've been to the San Diego location many times, and on a recent group trip to Vegas, knew my LA friends would get a kick out of coming.  This location differs in from their SD location in that there is way more parking available and the restaurant is much bigger offering more seating.  Other than that, everything else is the same.  Humongous portions, special entree and drinks menu, cool bar area to sit and enjoy some drinks, friendly servers, etc.  Everyone in our party was extremely satisfied with their experience hear and I heard a few of them returned back the next day.  You would do very well to share one meal for two people, especially if you're visiting Vegas and don't have a fridge for leftovers.  If you don't share, things can turn south if you're like me and hate to leave uneaten food on your plate.  Of course I overate, but it's Vegas!  The standout seemed to be the pork sandwich, although I thought my sage fried chicken was really enjoyable.  Their ""special"" mocha was really really good, but only if you're a sweet tooth person and prefer your mocha to be more hot chocolate with a dash of coffee.  If you're a person that upholds the standard of coffee, it would be best to stay away from that mocha.  Service was friendly and fairly fast for the most part.

The wait is the worst part and unfortunately it's no better than the SD location.  They don't take reservations and if you have a large party, you better be ok with sitting at separate tables if you want to have any chance of eating.  They broke us up into 2 tables for a party of 16 and we still had to wait about 45 minutes.  We got here around 11AM, but come at 10AM I think they didn't have a wait at all.  So if you can manage to drag you butt out of bed early, it'd save you some time.  The food is usually very good, but in my experience can sometimes be hit or miss.  Sometimes meat is overcooked and if I want to get picky, the amount of carbs they give you is just plain ridiculous.  

Overall I was very pleased with the meal and the fact that everyone in my party enjoyed themselves really confirms that Hash House a Go Go is a place we'll probably stop on by every Vegas trip.

I had to ask different waiters for things that we needed such as napkins.  When we asked for a refill for the kids milk, he charged us $4 more and did not even fill up the kids cup, I was just so pissed off by that point I just wanted to leave.  I asked for a comment card and they wanted me to write on scrap paper, which is bull*#@.

I got the Chicken and Waffles, and it was pretty dry. I guess I was expecting too much? 

My cousin tried the Milfried Chicken Sandwich... meh. the bread was so thick and it actually hurt his jaw to chew it. 

My other cousin got the salmon... big mistake. This was the one thing that they skimped out on..

My uncle got the Chicken Benedict, and this was honestly my favorite dish. I was almost gonna get it, but i always try to get different dishes from others (that way I could try theirs... :D)

Oh, and Idk what i was thinking getting a caramel mocha. I must've been tired? but it was hot, and I didn't read the menu right.. so my cousin who ordered the salmon took it along with several bites of all our meals.

Don't get the salmon. The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is your best bet, everything else is just ok.

I keep looking for a way to vary my gluten free meals so I ordered the steel cut oatmeal and a side of bacon.  It was sort of a healthy and not-healthy combination I guess.  The oatmeal came with a ""fruit garnish"" which I thought would be a small dish of grapes and melon.  But the presentation was fantastic.  There was a full split banana, four large strawberries, two melon slices, two orange slices, a dash of blueberries and (I think) blackberries on the oatmeal.  The fruit was fresh and tasty and the oatmeal was very good, especially after pouring on the syrup and brown sugar. More of the not so healthy.  Two out of three of the bacon strips were delicious, but one was somewhat overdone.  My wife ate one of the done-right strips and found it good enough to order her own, repaying me with one of them.  Her main order was a sun dried tomato farm scramble.  She liked it a lot and had more than enough to eat.

The flapjack was bland, except for the chunks of mango which were nice, the coconut was also bland- should have been toasted and more of it.  The pecan maple syrup was tasty

I mean, ew.

It's adorable, in a prefab sort of way. And the servers are cute, sassy, and sharp. And the stuff on the menu sounds good. But damn, the ugly pile of slop they served me was nauseating. 

I mean, the individual parts tasted good enough, but it was so unappetizing and enormous, it really did put me off my food. (And trust me, I have no problem with over the top food... but this was just gross.) 

Supposedly a ""benedict"", my brunch included a giant pile of mashed potatoes, two enormous biscuits, 4 slices of bacon, at least 3 scrambled eggs, a melted-crisp slice of mozzerella, and chipotle hollandaise. Oh, and a couple pieces of fruit, so you could eat healthy. When the waiter saw the look on my face, he said ""Isn't it great?"" Uh, no. No, actually. And, no.

My mom's brunch was a little less jumbo: meatloaf hash, fried eggs, and a biscuit, served in a full-size cast-iron skillet. It could have fed us both, amply, with leftovers. It was huge, but not disgustingly so.

I ordered the chicken and waffles-- the chicken (with the requisite sprig of rosemary) was crisp and moist, but rather bland. The belgian waffles had large pieces of bacon mixed into the batter and thus cooked into the waffle. Sadly, all I could taste was bacon. The 'maple reduction' drizzled around the waffle reminded me of a balsamic reduction and didn't really help. A side of syrup perked it up, but overall, hard to say it is worth ~$14. 

My cousin had the corned beef hash- big pieces of corned beef but otherwise just as bland as my food. He say the (pizza-sized) flapjacks are better, so I may give it a try.  

Overall, I think HH would be great if they can improve upon their flavors. Once over the novelty of big food, they need flavors to back them up.",zPofP4KU6kHDxY7cpBulSg,0,0,2,5JQ3jyYl_Wjt01tXeussBA

I ordered the Apple cinnamon pancake (huge! The photos are legit). However, there was barely any flavor. Even the apples didn't hold a lot of oomph behind them.

The owner/designer/chef were geniuses at creating an experience for the senses.  There is a Mid-West/Italian fusion thing going on in the menu which works on different levels. A rosemary springs impales a stack of potatoes and egg gallettes, chicken in olive oil is incorporated into a hash...well you get the idea.  

Another interesting element is that each dish is conceived architecturally, a feature that would normally be reserved for  a top Michelin-rated Parisian restaurant.  Food items such as toasted raw pasta straws, herbs in their natural states, etc., give delight to the eye, if not to the palate.  

Form then moves on to function as the familiar flavors are juxtaposed in unusual combinations which subvert our expectations in a way that would make Andrew Zimmer wax all the more eloquently about the dish being""over the top""!  Lest you think you will push yourself from the table still unsatisfied, let me assure you that each dish would easily feed two or three light eaters.

Yet, I read the reviews ahead of time and was persuaded by many yelpers that anything here tastes great. Wrong. 

I ordered the Benedict, and to be completely honest, I felt like Ihop tasted way better. Ouch, it hurt me to even type that knowing that this place has such high ratings. 

I sat all the way back in the secluded room- in the corner. Uhm, there was SO MUCH MORE room in the main dining room. I felt banished from eating with society. 

Flagging down the waiter was the worst part. Since I sat where the kitchen was, or where I believed the kitchen was, waiters would only care about their own table. My waiter was no where to be found when I needed a KNIFE to eat my Benedict. 

My waiter also recommended their house drink: something Watermelon. Honestly people, it is not worth your money. 

My mindset to seeing the prices was: Hey I'm in Vegas. It's EDC weekend. I just want to live my youth. Money is less of my worries right now. But seriously, 5-6 bucks for a glass of watermelon juice... just no.

Okay, here is the straight scoop; the food is okay.  The draw is that the Hash House was once featured on a TV show and the servings are large enough to feed a small nation.  Is that what we really want? (Well, I suppose in a nation where we set aside a Thursday each November to promote gluttony, that is what we want.)

My advice: If you go, begin a regimen of low dose aspirin a few days in advance to thin the blood and prepare your body for what it is about to ingest. Even better advice: Share.

Wanted to take my daughter out for breakfast and not just a typical IHOP joint. I've been to Hash House in San Diego and had such a great experience that I wanted to finally check it out here in Vegas. 

What a disappointment :( I don't want to be the mean reviewer but my experience needs to be addressed. As we arrived, I was told its going to be a 30 min wait. OK fine. I understand given the fact that its Saturday morning and its a busy time for them. Got our table and order taken 15 mins later. Then, it seriously was over 30 mins and our food hasn't arrived yet?! Keep in mind, my daughter and I only ordered a a tractor combo (2 eggs, bacon, and a butterscotch almond pancake) & french toast for us to share! Given the patient and understanding person I am...I held my tongue. So what got me was when the people who sat around me started getting there food already! BUT we got there waaaaay before they did!!! what the?! I finally asked the server if our food was coming too?! He said yes, its coming out soon. *slaps forehead* If only he would of kept me updated if it was going to be awhile or not, instead of ignoring me. 

The sad part was... after 15 mins into eating... the server handed us the bill!  WOW. REALLY!!? It took forever to wait to get seated, for the food to come out, and SO QUICKLY to rush us out!?

My sis was worried about the high winds at the pool might make her girls sick - not sure how exactly ; but the bottom line, first on the list is immediately checked off. I know my niece, Lizzie, Loves a good pancake or a good waffle - so ok, back to HHAGG ... please no wait...please good service ... please hot food ... well i'll be damned - 3 for 3 . 

Since we've seen a million reviews - i'll keep it short - the highlights: 

Bacon Waffles ( pic added ) - i kept staring at Lizzie's plate - 4 large waffles ... please don't eat them all - 1st went down fast , 2nd one almost as quick ...oh-oh ...3rd ...she's starting to slow down ...she's gotta be full after that huge hot chocolate with all those marshmallow's ...whew ...she's done . 

But wait, my sis had her eyes on them too ( she had a so-so stuffed burger, i had a so-so hash special - but the biscuit was awesome ! ) 

we agree to share the last of the bacon waffles - fluffy, nice pieces of bacon in the mix, some whipped butter and syrup - exceptional !! 

Highlight #2 - Hamms Beer ( pic added ) - with my special i saw at the bottom of the description - add a Hamm's beer for $1.25 - really ? Hamm's, my beloved college beer of choice ?!? Oh yeah - i'll take that ! 

Overall, decent service, got seated quickly, and the food - above average - when they say twisted farm food, for me , this place gets me twisted - it's really getting to be a love-hate relationship, today, it was love.",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,4,4,4,pC6Qsr6B9loxspwnFCPH-w

I like how it is located away from the Vegas strip and separated from all the madness.  I came here for lunch on a Sunday.  There was a wait time of around 15-20 minutes, but well worth the wait.  I wanted to order everything off the menu because it all looked good on paper. 

I ordered the fried chicken served on top of bacon waffles, fried leeks to dress the dish, and maple syrup drizzled on top of this giant tower of goodness.  The tower of food was held together with a large steak knife stuck right in the middle of the piled up food.  I felt like I was pulling out the Excalibur sword from the stone when I took out that steak knife and was ready for action!  I demolished the dish with no mercy.  Was a fair fight, but I think the dish won because I was knocked out when I got back to my hotel room.

The food was great.  Chicken was tender.  Perfect amount of seasoning.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The bacon waffles was good too.  Didn't know putting bacon in waffles would go so well together.  Also the watermelon lemonade is a refreshing drink.  The servers were very nice and friendly.  Lively atmosphere environment. Staff outfits were pretty cool too because they were dressed in team sports apparel.

1180751,2012-06-23,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I concede Hash House ONE star because my husband loves their bloody marias and they do a pretty good lime margarita. That's where the good portion of the evening ended for us.

We have been to three of their LV locations. Each time we've gone to the M location, the service has been spot-on, our food has come out at the same time and of course, the food is ginormous and good.

The Sahara location is the pits. We went on a Saturday night and they seemed to be understaffed so we waited about 30 minutes for a table in spite of the dining room being only about half full.

We waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. As we were waiting, we glanced around at what some of the other diners were enjoying. When the waitress came back with our drinks, I asked her a couple of (I thought) fairly simple questions about the menu. My husband also wanted to know what the people next to us ordered because it looked and smelled delicious.

The waitress walked over to the other table and asked them what it was. We were slightly more than a little embarrassed. The waitress didn't know the answers to the questions I asked, either.

Negative five points for menu knowledge.

Then, when our meals came out, my husband got his first. Being the gentleman he is, he waited for our son and me to get ours. And we waited. And we waited. After about 10 minutes, mine came out. We asked the server, very politely, if the kitchen knew anything about the proper firing of meals because we had never experienced this at another location. The server, while holding my plate in his hand the whole time, proceeds to argue with my husband and tell us that since the kitchen doesn't use any heat lamps, they brought out food whenever it was ready. 

Which is all fine except that just the week prior at the M location, I went to lunch with a group of 15 people and our meals all came out within a couple of minutes of each other.

But back to the Sahara location. The server continues to argue with us and finally just stops talking. Standing there. Glaring at us. After a few seconds of this I looked at him and asked, ""May I please have my dinner plate or are you going to continue to hold it hostage?"" At which point, he thumped it down on the table in front of me.

Did I mention that the restaurant manager walked by at least twice during this and didn't say a word? Did I also mention that our son STILL did not have his dinner?

And at this point, both my husband's food and my food are cold. Then comes my son's hamburger. 

All told, three meals over the course of about 20 minutes. Without a word from our waitress, drink refills or the manager stopping by.

I will concede that my husband's bloody marys are always good. My grilled cheese sandwich, though cold, was still tasty. And my son said his hamburger was okay but nothing special.

We would much rather take the extra 30-40 minutes out of our lives and go to the one inside M, where they actually appreciate their customers and have common sense when it comes to firing food in the kitchen.",xDGHlxXxXg7GZI048lmo0Q,1,0,1,zxhnj4vRVIMjeqVIqpA02A

1232516,2011-10-16,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This place is sick.

That said, it's sick in the most delicious way possible.

Okay, y'all know me, constantly griping about how many new things I want to try but it's all too far, it's such a chore to get around this city without a car, yada yada, well this is something which I haven't tried yet which isn't all that far out of the way from where I live. I was having Yelp withdrawls, instead of hitting up a usual suspect for the weekend like I have for the past several months, this time I needed to try
something new so I had reason to post a new review. I am an aspiring writer you know. 

I've heard horror stories about the waits to get seated, but when we came in there was no wait at all. I'm guessing that must be during the breakfast rush, since we came in for dinner. 

The ambiance is not what I was expecting based on what I've heard. Outside, it does indeed look ""farm-like"", but the inside is a different story. The front half of the room was very ~hip~, the back half had a more intimate feel. I always thought the interior would match the exterior with the farm theme, but, like the tagline says, this is TWISTED farm food so that could be part of the point for all I know. 

And now, I will tell you all why this place is so ""sick.""

As we were reading over our menus, we were given these gargantuan biscuits smothered in honey. They looked delish, but they were a tad disappointing. They were crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside....until you get closer to the middle. At that point the biscuit gets quite dry, thank god for the whipped butter they give you on the side and all that honey residue on the plate. 

My mom ordered the Bacon Garlic-Mashed Potato burger with bacon cheddar mashed potatoes. Although she couldn't finish it, the burger wasn't too insane. The bacon mashed potatoes were AMAZING. They didn't give us any gravy though, but that was good enough by itself, I definitely know what I'm getting next time I go there. The burger was an unusual taste sensation, having mashed potatoes on it. It is quite tasty once you get used to it however. 

I ordered brinner: Eggs, smothered in cheese with sausage and crispy potatoes, on top of the Flapjack. Now THIS was sick. So sick. The pancake was the size of a SKILLET, and the waitress even had to hold my plate with two hands. Like I said earlier though, the pancake was sick in the most delicious way possible. I had about 3 bites of it before cutting it up into seven pieces to take it to go for the next day (which would be today. And I still haven't finished it). I was shocked about the potatoes. I figured they would be like hash browns, but they were hefty wedges sprinkled with onions and peppers. Salt and pepper did the trick to make them less bland, but they didn't work all that well as I tried to mix them up with the eggs and sausage. It still made for a tasty meal, and I was almost full after finishing up that. 

We were in and out of there in a little over an hour. Talk about swift service. The portion sizes may scare me a little bit, but they are a steal at these prices, and it's always nice to be able to make another meal out of restaurant leftovers.

We couldn't believe the size of everything they served. But being the little pigs that we are, we still managed to order three full meals for the two of us. 

We started off with the banana brown sugar pancake(enormous) with caramelized sugar on top. What a pancake , it was the size of a throw pillow filled with banana's. Delicious to look at and taste. Next meal for a family of four was the fried chicken benedict. This dish was layered with the following: potatoes home fried, buttermilk biscuits(two),raw spinach and tomatoes,four slices of bacon, giant boneless fried chicken breast (what a breast),three scrambled eggs, deep fried spears of spaghetti, fried cheese, chipolte sauce smothering it all. The plate of food was stacked so high it was a tower. 

The third dish was the chicken and waffles, six waffles with the bacon cooked inside the waffle, then two enormous fried and boneless chicken breasts, topped with maple syrup, another towering inferno of calories. Everything was really delicious. 

Service was actually pretty good since there were customers all over the place. It took 45 minutes to get a seat, then we ordered and the waitress said the food would be out in another 45 minutes.

The pictures however are making me rethink my stance.  A couple years ago I was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that I brought along with me.  It clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time.  However, when we sat down and I tried to order the picture, I was told they don't prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day.  That I could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all.  Due to my prior excitement over the picture, and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen, but they would not use them the way they advertised, I was very deflated.  It ruined my appetite, we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since.

1260634,2013-09-10,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Okay, so I guess I should start by saying that we came for breakfast, first time trying their breakfast menu. They had tons of yummy sounding options, but I settled on a blueberry pecan pancake, over medium eggs, and bacon. My boyfriend got the french toast.

His french toast sounded soo good on the menu description, and when it was served, it looked fantastic, except for the griddled bananas (served in the peel, which was black and mushy, tasted good but very unappealing looking) his french toast tasted like nothing, and was mushy and in general, just kind of blah.

My pancake was HUGE, and yummy, but my over medium eggs were basically raw, I mean the yolks were super runny (which is fine, I never, ever send food back) I was going to eat them until I noticed that the whites werent even cooked, I mean, runny whites on an over medium egg? Yuck! I asked the waitress for new ones and she obliged saying, ""oh sure, you might want more of an over medium."" Um, yeah cause that's what I ordered. She brings the eggs back out and clearly the cook was annoyed that they got sent back, because he cooked the crap out of these eggs, I mean, they were beyond well done. Whatever, I mean the pancake was so huge I didn't even need the eggs at that point.

Fast forward to them picking up the bill, I was paying by credit, they took the card, and then a different person came back and asked for Id, which I accidentally left at home. (If its your policy to get Id for credit cards, that's fine, but maybe ask for the identification before you run the card?) I explained I didn't have it and instead of offering another option he glared at me and asked if it was really my card. I mean, come on. I said that yes it is my card and he just mumbled something under his breath and walked off! We had cash, and would have paid in cash! To top it off we had to wait another few minutes for them to bring me a pen so I could sign the receipt.  Really? I wanted to love this place, again the menu for breakfast is really enticing. But our general experience was way off.

All in all, I've eaten here a few times (other times for dinner) and in general, they definitely wow you with portion sizes but they lack actual flavor. They describe their food as midwestern farm food with a twist. After eating here a handful of times I'm convinced the twist is the portion size and the giant sprig of rosemary they serve with everything.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,1,0,2,9PQLU-rMVGVjpglt3fQCFw

I have driven by numerous times and have seen all the cars in the parking lot. 

And now, I have experienced it first hand.

This place is not for anyone who cares about their health.

We went there today as I had a hangover and heard this was a place to go to sooth my aching body.
Well,we got there and were greeted with LOUD music blaring and some not too friendly barstaff that seemed to behave as thought they were doing me a favor getting me a drink.(to bite the dog that bit me)

We were told the wait would be thirty minutes (which the hostess said was not too bad, often you had to wait for an hour or more for a table), so we sat down after I got my drink. My husband was surfing all of the reviews on Yelp. He asked me two or three times if this is what I wanted because most of the reviews mention the huge portions and the ""Man Vs. Food"" show that this was on. By the way, the wait was not that long.

Well, for those of you who are not acquainted with the show, it is a scourge on America, IMHO. The idea it seems, and I have watched it more than once, is for the host of the show to eat enormous portions of challenging food. I wonder why his liver has not enlarged the way Morgan Spurlock's (of the movie ""SuperSize Me"") did. Probably because he must wait and detoxify between shows. I recommend watching it sometime, it is truly disgusting and an example of Gluttony in the worst way.
Well, my husband kept giving me hints that the experience may not be what I wanted, since I am interested in quality not quantity, but I was hungover and needed to eat.

We sat down at a table and noticed that almost every fourth person eating at the tables around us was HUGE. Not just a bit overweight, but hearattack just around the corner fat. I mean people approaching or in fact morbidly obese.

And what were they eating? GIANT PILES of DEEP FRIED saucy slop.

My husband stated once again, that this resturant was on the show ""Man Versus Food"". That is it's claim to fame folks. The show that is suggesting that people should try and eat this HUGE portion of food, when really your stomach is only about the size of your fist.
Well, onto the meal. 
First, I have to say the waitperson was very nice, and that is about all I liked about this place.
The food came. We ordered the fried chicken breast benedict and a spinach salad. The spinach salad must have had a half a pound of well cooked, rather tasty bacon on it, but wow, toooo much bacon. And I LOVE bacon. I must say that the salad was tasty.

The other order was also tasty, but it was ENORMOUS and a giant pile of sadness.

Mashed Potatoes, with bacon on top, covered by three deep fried breaded chicken breasts with scrambled eggs and fried cheese on top covered in what must have been a pint of, once again, tasty sauce. Oh, and there were some biscuits strewn about the plate that were the size of two stacked hockey pucks. They were also good.
But what they have done, is taken this to an extreme that is just awful. Tone it down a bit, smaller portions, like maybe 10-20% of the size would be fine.
The experience was very disheartening, and pretty disgusting. I will only go there as a goof, if I ever go again.
Lose weight America. We have an OBESITY and DIABETES EPIDEMIC.

You want QUANTITY. Eat here with all the other Fatties.

Oh and if you want to just order one thing and share it, they charge you $2.50 for the plate. Sheesh.

1. Its my favorite go to place when im in vegas i perfer this location as its away from the busy LV strip traffic like the one inside Imperial palace. 
2. Seating is always pretty fast 
3. Food always taste great my fav is the chicken and waffles
4. My fav drink is always a hit and now it comes spiked if you like it. Watermelon,  Kiwi, lemonade (bomb.com)
5. The food is normally brought out pretty fast as well
6. Large portions to where 2 can share a plate (maybe 3 ppl)
7. Our waiter for the day was nice and serviced us as well as he could as he had 7 tables himself to wait on.
Here's why i gave it a 4 star.

 Now this situation nevered happened to me before as this was my 2nd time at this location in the past few years, but it was strange how the hostess sat all the black families/couples toward the back of the restaurant near the restroom. At 1st i was like why is she taking us all the way to the back when it was plenty of open tables right behind where she was standing when we arrived so when another couple came in after we were seating they said the same thing out loud which confirmed what i was thinking. As we sat there with eatung our meal more guest arrived a couple a blk male and white woman was sat near the back but since he was a larger guy a booth was not going to work so they were seating in the table area near the back. There was an older white couple with there grandkids who were mixed raced (blk and white) and they were placed at the table in the middle section not all the way to the back but close.. then the few white or non black customers who walked in was near the bar or the front of the resturant we noticed as we were leaving mind you there was plenty of seats in the area where the tables. It could have read the restaurant setup that day but then again i dont think i was wrong on this situation. Management needs to review this process as to how they seat guest as it could make an situation go bad for this location. This occurred on Friday the 15th around 4-5p.. check your video for that day..",FpZ4YYPMM2834EUinxXSIQ,1,0,4,bDKAPxdhBiiMo4fC4oaGsg

We ordered a fried chicken eggs benedict and a banana cinnamon french toast.  My friend had seen a Man vs. Food episode here so we were expecting the dishes to be on the large side.  We revised those portion estimates upward when we saw a flap jack the size of a small pizza go by our table.

The fried chicken eggs benedict was massive and interesting to say the least.  They've taken a lot of liberties in calling this an eggs benedict.  The eggs are scrambled instead of poached.  The hollandaise sauce is replaced with a delicious chipotle cream sauce.  The English muffin is replaced with a massive (and fairly tasteless) biscuit.  

The fried chicken (perhaps 2-3 pieces worth) under this heap of toppings was delicious.  Also loved the garlic potatoes and apple-smoked bacon that was in there.  The eggs were just so-so but at least they made it feel like brunch instead of some gluttonous hangover binge.

The french toast was just so-so.  It's huge but size doesn't help when you order something that sweet.  I wouldn't recommend it.

The wait on a Saturday morning was 45 minutes.  Pretty impressive (and annoying) given that it's not on the strip.

For the holiday visit, my family indulged my curiosity about this innocuous brown building on our Sahara Avenue drive from house to Strip.  

Walking in and seeing the stainless steel furniture, dark clad young staff and roadhouse ambiance, I had a Hard Rock experience that faded when I saw the dishes being brought to their diners.  Wasting no time, my brother ordered the Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict and my much less buff Mom and I split the Indiana favorite with Fried Chicken, Eggs, Biscuit and Bacon Mashed Potatoes with a side of ham.  Our waiter was pretty friendly / helpful and at one point gave us someone's extra strawberry lemonade.  

I uploaded pics of what we ordered to further my point that this place clearly prospers on Presentation.  (Why else would this joint warrant over 1000 photos?)  The immense breaded pork tenderloin slathered with BBQ cream and scrambled eggs defies description.  Never mind that there is an entire serving of bacon mashed potatoes, spinach and a biscuit under that thing which effectively hides the plate.  Just looking at this dish makes your heart skip a beat.  Our chicken was much less impressive (but featured a jaunty rosemary sprig stuck in the center of the biscuit whose big brother accompanies the pork tenderloin) with some sliced tomatoes, a slice of watermelon and orange to counter the salty / sweet flavors of the chicken breast and spud-shaped mound of mashed potatoes / maple reduction.  As a side note, my brother nearly finished that pork platter.  I'm so proud!

Awe aside, the taste of all this food was good, but nothing as mind-mending as its appearance.  However, I can see this fare being a great sponge for an equally impressive hangover.  It's the ultimate greasy (sort of gourmet) spoon.",Yf0JwS-Zr2DQlk73TDzVLA,0,0,3,5ZAAUR4v1irPM0MxiCAzFg

Hash House is five star all the way. The food, the ambiance, the servers, the drama! And you guys are reviewing it like it's just some other diner! It's been a few months since my visit, and I am really craving this place. 

This location is off the strip, and caters to the locals. I am sure they also see their share of tourists, that like us, rent cars. If you are vacationing without a car, I am sure there are more convienent locations. 

My advice if you are eating here? Come very hungry! Bringing a large group will also come in handy so you can try a bunch of stuff. We were a group of 6. This is the kind of place where you end up ordering more from seeing what's coming to other tables, than from the actual menu. First thing to catch my eye was a HUGE mug of hot chocolate! Gotta have it! But will it be good, or is it just razzle dazzle? It was amazing! Next I served myself from a couple of the skillets that arrived at the table. These are one of their specialties, and they were really good. We're talking potatoes, eggs, and then a bunch of different items you could choose to go in there. Honestly, I don't even remember what was in there, because the pancakes came! Once the pancakes came, everything else was history! 

These were not your ordinary pancakes. These were OMG, eyes rolling to the back of your head, I'll have what she's having, died and gone to heaven pancakes. Hands-down, the best pancakes anywhere, ever in my life. There were sliced bananas and brown sugar cooked into them. The brown sugar was melted and carmelized with the bananas, and it all came together in one ooey gooey heavenly dish.

Hash house has been our brunch go to spot in SD so we didn't think this location would be this bad. We ordered two dishes, salmon benedict and corn beef.

Mashed potatoes at the bottom was cold. I couldn't even finish a quarter of the portion because it was really not enjoyable. Corn beef was cheesy as well. The browned potatoes were good though. English muffin was way too dense. This location did not fully display the farm to table culture and was definitely not on par with the original location in SD. If I had taken the warning from the SD peeps that this location was a franchise and different from the SD one I wouldn't have to have two brunches in a day.

First, it's way overpriced. A single breakfast for one with a coffee and side of gravy should never be over $20. It was, and I think that's mostly why I'm not pleased with this place. If I paid $10 for what I received and this place didn't have such a high yelp score I wouldn't feel so compelled to write a review. Second, my breakfast had poorly cooked eggs, over medium doesn't mean burnt on one side and runny white in the middle. The chicken was super dry and the whole thing was sitting in some watery like substance. Pretty disgusting. The best thing was the biscuit, it was quite good, but didn't come with gravy. I order a side of gravy, which btw is basically sausage with a light coating of gravy around it, so if you're looking for something for your biscuit, just forget about it and eat it as is.

One of my initial positives was the fact that you can order breakfast, lunch, or dinner no matter what time of the day. As I am NOT a morning gal and was craving breakfast... this turned out to be a perfect option. 

As we approached the building, there is outdoor seating available including the misting machines to cool you down, which I find funny in contrast since I am from CA where outdoor patio seating has heaters, hehe. 

Upon entering, we were greeted by the front desk girl who was very prompt in not only welcoming but finding us a seat. I am quite picky on customer service... so far, so good...

Menus and water were brought out promptly. After a brief moment to look over food options, Jackson introduced himself and was very welcoming. He offered awesome recommendations, his personal faves, and any dietary limitations. 

For my order, I went with
Vanilla waffle
""over hard"" eggs
Crispy potatoes

All made delicious! the eggs were just made perfectly fluffy, and crisp enough just delicious. I don't usually like left overs but ate the waffle like a day or so later and it still tasted like perfection. and the potatoes were made deliciously crispy right down to the last bite. It was one of the last things we both nom nom'd on. For anyone wanting to be creative there's even a bacon waffle available. 

You also can't go wrong when both the guys from Man vs. Food & Guy from Diner, drive ins, and dives have both eaten here.

My husband is a fan of fried chicken and waffles, but said these were the worst he's had.  The waffle was dense and rubbery, not crisp and fluffy.

I think I had some type of skillet scramble that came with a crab cake on top.  The crab cake was probably 4-5"" in diameter with no crab flavor or visible crab chunks.  It tasted of all bread crumb.  I would prefer a small crab cake with actual crab meat it in.  There was a salsa underneath the crab cake which made the country potatoes soggy.

We had time to have a champagne mint cocktail - the Champagne Supernova - for him, and a bloody mary for her.  

I've got to mention the music here - this was better club music than Tao nightclub the night before, I'm not even joking.  What better way to wake up in Vegas than to get some coffee then head on out here and let the generous portions and great dance music give you energy for the day.

And generous portions they were, although I had the sundried tomato, feta, spinach, and basil scramble with crispy fried potatoes, buttermilk biscuit, and watermelon, which was one of their smallest dishes.  The scramble was done just right, just an amazing blend of flavors.  Potatoes were done just right, and the rosemary sprig in the biscuit gave it just the right hint of rosemary without it being overwhelming in every bite.

They have a mister and a fan for the outdoor seating so you can either cool off or have your own wet t-shirt contest outside, depending on your particular level of inhibition at the time . . . .

It went like this: I walked in with my boyfriend to escape the god-awful summer heat and I wandered into this gem with pictures hung up of all the celebrities who have visited. I'm interested.
We sat down, and our server gave us a plethora of menus. It didn't bother me. I like variety.
I quickly scanned for any sign of beverages, because you know how some places take your drink order before your bottom hits the seat? They actually gave us time to decide. I noticed the S'mores mocha and I had to try it. It was so gooey and messy looking, it looked outrageous. I fell in love. It had a thick coating of toasted marshmallow, graham cracker crumbles, and chocolate sauce drizzled all over the cup and saucer. There was a little graham cracker peeking out, and I just died it was that good.
By then, I knew what I wanted to eat. I got the Chicken Pot Pie. It's time for a little rant.

Why not serve excellent food in reasonable portions.  Even sharing an entree, my husband and I couldn't get through the amazing pork tenderloin.  I'm not sure I will go back. 

That, and the next charge on the credit card I used there was fraudulent. Perhaps not related, but hard to ignore the timing.

It is definitely an experience, especially with the kiwi, watermelon lemonade enhanced with a shot of Don Eduardo reposado to hone down the sweet edge.  

But if ridiculous food waste is an issue for you, plan to share or be able to take it home.

(note:  I used a credit card here and immediately after had several fraudulent transactions in Las Vegas.  Probably not a coincidence.)",Lh5cOrtYyu_K2I2Tykp1Mw,3,0,3,GjM55AljXpbv6jJjzjx9Og

I guess I do, cause that's what we got after having breakfast here today. 

I came here today for breakfast with the Yelp-izzles. Thanks Elnino F. for organizing this breakfast and for letting us take advantage of your gift certificate! The other major players at the table were Jieun L., Sun M., and Oliver M. There was only one lucky player who walked away without the Bubble Guts. 

I ordered a Farm Benedicts with the Sage Fried Chicken cause I wanted to do it Man v. Food style. There was not enough chicken to go with the amount of eggs, biscuit, and mashed potatoes on the plate. The biscuit was dry. The chicken and spinach was good. The slice of pineapple and orange was probably the best thing on the plate. I had a Fresh Lemonade Mimosa to drink. It was ok.

1409474,2016-10-13,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Came here for lunch prior to going to the 2016 RiSe Lantern Festival this year. Thought to maybe stuff myself a bit more since I heard this place had huge portions. We arrived around 130P on a Saturday afternoon and was told we had to wait about 10 minutes. Honestly I was surprised at the wait time considering it was a weekend ! With a party of 5, we were sat a booth table fairly quick. 

I had been wanting to try their Sage Fried Chicken so that's what I got. Fried chicken is stacked with bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. It sounded really good if it was made well. The chicken was a bit dry despite drenching with the maple caramel reduction but was nicely flavored. The leeks looked like fried old green onions than leeks (yes I know how leeks look like, no im not stupid lol) The waffle was the most disappointing part. Yeah its a ""great"" idea to stick a piece of bacon in it but man the waffle is soft. As my friend had said, probably used the same batter as pancake and didn't cook it enough. It was soft and heavy. Not light and crispy like what I think a waffle should be. So sad ! 

HH Famous Roasted Chicken Pot Pie upside down crust stuffed with house roasted chicken, red potatoes, veggies, and pan gravy served with mashed potatoes. My friend had gotten this. There was a huge ""sombrero"" like crust topped with the insides of a chicken pot pie. Overall it tasted nice, like a chicken pot pie but the crust definitely throws it off. Not the same flaky kind of crust I love to eat with a pot pie. 

The Tractor Driver Combo
Two Eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. Make it a waffle or french toast for a buck. OH MAN ! this ""flapjack"" was huge ! it was larger than my friend's face who ordered it. It dwarfed the two eggs so easily. LOL 

I tried the biscuit from my friend's hash. It was really good. Crispy outside. soft inside. It was served by their house strawberry jam. Pretty good. Wish the biscuit was more buttery or given some butter too. XD 

Overall, like my friend said, ""no one needs to eat this much food"" LOL. But that's not the problem. After all these years of people speaking highly of this place, my order was really disappointing. I love a good waffle and that's the one they screwed up the most :( so sad...",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,0,2,5J2BmcHzDfx1DS1Ip0EltA

Party of 4 on a Saturday (late) morning.  We waited less than 30 minutes for a seat.  The patio area was refreshing and sunny.  Our waitress was helpful with recommendations and any questions that we had.  

Our drinks came first.  I had the mint latte, which had a splash of mint.  It tasted really good with the actual mint leaf. 

When the actual food came out, our table went absolutely silent.  GIGANTIC PORTIONS.  And so pretty (I'll post pictures).  I tried to put a fork or knife in the pictures for porportion, but the flatware is on the large-side, too!  I had the smoked salmon benedict.  The dish was a little overwhelmingly salmon-y, but I liked the combination of the other ingredients.  My bf had the Banana Walnut French Toast.  The toast was a least an inch thick and surprisingly filling for how fluffy the texture was.  The other couple with us had the quesadilla and the bacon burger.  I had a bite of the burger and it was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.  The quesadilla was mild.

The prices are on the high side for a breakfast place, but I don't think you can even compare, since the servings are so big.  

I did try to use a restaurant.com coupon, but I didn't read that the stupid thing said ""dinner only"".  Waitress wouldn't take it, but it sounds like if it wasn't a weekend morning, she might have.  

Either way, I enjoyed myself and I will be back.",n9gITMi9ddlUQ_Bqb3dBwg,1,0,4,8AMAcY4XqwFq38-Kfpf1Kw

The wait for a table was about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad.  Our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  I started with a blood mary (YUM!) and my hubby had the mocha latte - both drinks were very good! The bloody mary was spicy and adorned with jalapeno stuffed green olives.  I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict and my hubby ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  

To say the portions were obscene is an understatement.  The portions were ridunculous!!!!  Mine was less ridunculous than my hubby's - the pork tenderloin was three times the size of the bun!  Why add the bun?  Seriously.  There was no way in hell that anyone could have picked that thing up and ate it.  At any rate, the chicken breast on mine was delicious, tender and juicy.  It was a mountain of food, to put it mildly.  I ate the chicken breast, cheese, eggs and bacon - I had no room at all for the biscuits, spinach and mashed potatoes underneath it all.  I believe mine came with a side of shame and guilt because I felt like crap the rest of the day.

While our food was very tasty and worth the wait (they do make everything to order, so be patient), it was too much food for 4 people, let alone 2.  For the love of God, if you go, order one meal and share it!! Yes, they charge you $2.50 for a split plate, but who cares?!

When we arrived around 11am, there was a 30 minute line, which was fine for me since I assume a line means good food. After being seated, I ordered the bacon and mashed potato burger. First off, mashed potato in a burger? Hell yeah America! Secondly, this thing was huge! Weighing in over a pound, I thought it was going to take a bite out of me at one point.

I also ordered their classic Bloody Mary. Now I'm a bit persnickety when it comes to my bloody mary's, but this one was perfect and had the right blend of spicy and salty without being too strong.

Maybe my hungover taste buds hadn't woken up just yet, or were too sensitive from all the drinking the night before (what? It's Vegas!), or it was just too darn spicy, but I just couldn't finish it.

1473828,2014-07-29,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Did a brunch with my boyfriend there, we shared 2 popular items: Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I had the Banana Latte to drink and he had the Caramel Mocha coffee.  Service was friendly and the waiter was personable.

The food is great and the portions are plentiful; really pretty large, as seen in pictures.  

I can't comment on lunch/dinner type foods since both entrees we ordered were breakfast items.  The sage fried chicken was good but dry in some parts.  The bacon waffles under the chicken had a hint of vanilla in them but were overall pretty bland actually.  With syrup and other food items on the plate, the dryness of the waffles is not unbearable.  The maple syrup is heated and served in a small steel cup.  Fried leeks top the chicken and waffles as well as some diced peppers for garnish and the signature stick of rosemary.

The Sage Fried Chicken [eggs] benedict has an awesome chipotle sauce, not too spicy, just right.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good.  The egg is almost forgotten in this dish, but it is there, with a layer of cheese too.

Our espresso drinks were excellent...I definitely recommend the Banana Latte.  If I went again I would order only one Sage Fried Chicken dish and try something new.",Qso6ZvMd0S_iqLL4BpwCBw,0,0,4,tbBHE3rcmWEsjtgZhLROIw

It's mostly a breakfast spot but the lunch is worth it as well. Whenever I have people in town this place is on the to-do list. Be ready to share or for leftovers because the portions are Gi-normous. It's comfort food at it's best. They serve my absolute fav dish in this town, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Not your typical breakfast selection I know.  It's a piece of fried chicken on top of scrambled eggs and spinach on top of mashed potatoes and bacon on top of a huge biscuit cover with a chipotle cream sauce that is nothing short of heaven. The flapjack is the next on my list. Yeah that's singular. That's because it's pretty much the size of a medium pizza. The coffee is very strong which I like but I know I'm in the minority on that one.  

The staff is very nice but you have to remember that great food takes time so if you are in a hurry you might want to try somewhere else. Expect about a 10 - 30 minute wait here on the weekends but you golden on the weekdays. For the weekend warriors why not try the Beer-In-a-Bag special they have while you wait.

During a mere 5 minute wait at 9ish am,  I checked out the celeb wall of fame. Man vs. Food's been here.  Impressive but more so, I loved the friendly attitude and commitment to customer service here.  Of course, the food was kickass and doled out in manly man sized servings.
There must be a prereq to working here.  You must be fun and ubercool. There was no shortage of interesting tats and off the chart hair color.  Regardless, the hostess and the servers were really nice.  
There was a literally a slight ""mixup"" in my oatmeal order but no biggie.  The server and the kitchen manager (?) were very considerate.   Yes, I actually ordered oatmeal despite being surrounded by foodie heavenly delights which were beckoning my name.  However, I resisted.  Well, no, actually, I did succumb to temptation and took a taste or two of hub's Fried Chicken eggs benedict.  Woman vs. food and food won.
Now, this is no ordinary or traditional eggs benedict.  This was the kitchen sink gourmet version over yummy biscuits.  Each presented with a nice sharp knife on top of a huge pile of food.  How fitting. 
My oatmeal was very satisfying with a pile of beautifully presented fruit on top. Think oatmeal... Carmen Miranda style. 
Kiddo's pancake was the size of a Frisbee.  He ate a hole in the middle equivalent to 2 ordinary sized pancakes.  
I know it's not ""manly"" to share dishes, but if you come in a group, it's too hard to not want to try someone else's entrée, so I would recommend family style ordering. 
The ambiance is laid back, modern and all walks of life come here.  Cool....

On Sunday, my BF and I went to Hash House a Go Go for brunch. We arrived a little after 10 AM and were told that there was a 15 minute wait. The wait ended up being more like 25 minutes and BF does not wait well. 

Our server was great. Our coffee and water arrived within a couple minutes. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash. I figure that if this is a hash house they should be able to do this right. This was without a doubt the best corned beef hash I've ever eaten.  It came out on a platter. When people say that the portions are generous, that's an understatement. The corned beef was shredded, mixed with swiss cheese and put it over these amazing potatoes. It was served with a real biscuit and eggs. I like my eggs over hard. I hate runny yolks. I've sent eggs back at many a fine establishment. THIS PLACE GOT MY EGGS RIGHT!!!

BF got a pumpkin cranberry waffle. It was huge. Served with butter and whipped cream. Yummy! There was so much food that we ended up switching place, he finished my hash and I finished his waffle.  The next time I go to Vegas, this is going to be a regular stop. Even BF admitted that the food was worth the wait.

Sage fried chicken and bacon waffles with maple reduction... 2 stars. Roscoe's serves WAAAAAY better chicken and waffles. The chicken was dry and the waffles were too doughy. Where's the sage? The maple reduction was the best part about the plate but it stuck like hot glue so I couldn't get much from it. You absolutely need to ask for more syrup. The fried leeks were bitter.

Fried chicken eggs benedict... 4 stars. Sooo heavy but sinfully good. Very filling. The chipotle cream sauce really makes it. Good thing for the tomato bc it really cuts through the heaviness a bit.

Meatloaf hash... 5 stars! The meatloaf was sooo moist and tender. The biscuit is delicious with the homemade strawberry jam. Even though this place is known for their fried chicken benedict... I HIGHLY recommend the meatloaf hash.

One breakfast entree is MORE than enough for two people, yet if you want to share they charge you an additional fee. I find this a little ridiculous, but whatever. 

The food is generally okay (I love a good biscuit, and that they can offer) but on this past visit I was not happy with my entree which was a smoked salmon benedict. It was basically a MOUNTAIN of heavy and dry components which did not mesh together well at all but most importantly, the salmon tasted really fishy. I'm a pescetarian so I know fish pretty well and there was something just not quite right with this salmon. So I take about two bites and stop. I had my husband taste it too just to be sure it wasn't in my head and he agreed. We are not complainers, but we felt they needed to know about the funky fish. Our server finally came by and noticed that I hadn't eaten much and asked if something was wrong, so we told her. She did ask if I wanted something else but I said I was okay. 

A few minutes later a manager stopped by to find out what the issue was, so we explained it to her as well. So, here's where this establishment went ALL WRONG...this manager proceeds to explain to us the entire process of how they ""smoke"" their salmon. She said their method is a little unique and ""not for everyone"" and that she didn't really care for it either. Um, really? That's how you're going to handle this? She didn't offer anything to make it right. We weren't demanding a free meal, or even a refund. We didnt ask for anything different and just wanted to explain that there could have been a problem with old fish. The response was basically, our salmon is not for everyone, and sorry you didnt like it. Arrogant, and not the way to keep loyal clientele. In short, Poor management response has blacklisted this restaurant for me.",ROw0ECwZ3BmzdMSznmyl1A,2,1,2,XDpJ0EVk5_9CQ7FZjLIFLA

Good down home breakfast food and huge portions! 
The service was... not so much, but..... 
We were a large group of 14 about 11-11:30 on a Sunday with no reservation. LOL 
Yeah.... just happened that way. (if my mom organized it, it wouldn't have!) 
Well our server totally couldn't handle it! 
Now we are not the complaining type and we certainly knew that we had thrown them off on an already busy Sunday Morning and we were having a good time with our Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's and I am sure there were some other drinks in there but anyway.... 
My feeling on this is If they made room to accommodate us then they probably should have known to give us a server or two that could manage it and have the other servers pick up additional tables. (I have worked in restaurants and this should be a no brainer) especially with the amount of staff that was present! 
She was so frazzled that when several of us had requested tortillas instead of muffins or toast and our breakfasts came out with rolls; we reminded her that we had requested tortillas she asked for all of our rolls back! Really?!?!?!? For What?!??! Is she gonna drop them off at another table????? 
Not that we wanted the rolls but really, you want it back?!?!?!? 
She did either rethink this or was told no because when she came back to the table she didn't want it anymore. 
THANK GOODNESS! 
Of course we have and will continue to go back. But never as a large party on a Sunday Morning without a reservation! Unless of course we have a few Bloody Marys or Mimosa's before hand!

The plate was taken immediately. Before I could blink, the manager was at my table apologizing. They'd take it off the bill and get us anything? we'd like. We opted for the French toast, which turned out amazing. The other three meals were excellent. Huge portions, well-cooked chicken, great presentation and great flavors. These folks handled the undercooked chicken so professionally, it made us forget about the entire situation so we were able to enjoy our food.

Went to sin city this weekend, and had to try this spot after seeing it on Man vs Food.
I love a good breakfast... hell, I love a good ANY MEAL, and this place WON like a muthafukka!!!! I hate to say it, but the griddle better watch their back.

I had the caramelized banana vanilla cinnamon french toast with a pistachio mocha. Yeah. Don't look at me like that... complete with chicken sausage and 2 eggs over hard. And mama did some damage.
My friend ordered the snickers pancakes... (-----READ IT AGAIN.

The service was impeccable. It literally took us 8 min to get seated (with a party of 5) and our waiter was cooooool cool. (and cute to boot!)

In my opinion, there is only 1 place on the planet (I've persoanally tried) that is an equal. SHOPSINS.... in essex street market in New York. (see review)

Hash House a go go is a really fun breakfast brunch kind of joint.  They dont just have your basic continental breakfast.   They'll make you 1 pancake. and that pancake will be HUGE.  I'm 6'9 and i couldnt even fathom trying to eat more than half of my pancake.  Not to mentino the eggs and sausage along with it.

Personally i had the tractor driver combo which was like some eggs served to your liking, sausage/taters/bacon/ and a pancake.  But they're pancakes are lush and big. mine was  brown sugar and banana pancake.  

Grandmother had french toast (more like french loaf) with pecan maple syrup.

Everything was delicious.  But beware it's probably a diabetic coma waiting to happen.  A lot of the things they have here are filled with sugar.  

The surroundings are kinda Farmhouse meets modern life?   I'm horrible at describing interior designs but the entrance was filled with celebrity headshots with signatures saying how great hash house was.

I saw the Hash House a Go-Go featured on one of the Vegas morning shows during a recent business trip and decided we would check it out on our next trip to Vegas... boy we certainly weren't disappointed. This is probably one of my top three places to go for breakfast now.

They describe the menu as 'twisted farm food', which is a good way of describing it. Everything is made fresh and it is all good. You can get a traditional bacon & eggs if you like, but if you want to be more adventurous, you can try something like the Salmon & Brie Scramble with a side of grilled mashed potatoes (yes... MASHED POTATOES FOR BREAKFAST!!! How can you not love that?!) 

The various hashes are a specialty. I particularly was taken with the french toast with pecans and grilled banana. YUM! Also, the don't pass up one of their biscuits with homemade jam (they come with most meals). 

All the portions were HUGEMONGUS so make sure you're hungry and don't plan on eating for the rest of the day! We barely made a dent in our breakfasts when we went there. This would be a good place to go as a group and get a bunch of different things and eat it all family style. 

The service was friendly and attentive which made the experience all the more enjoyable. 

This place is quite a bit off the strip on W. SAHARA, so a cab ride would probably cost a bit. Its best if you have your own transportation. I do believe the Deuce Bus goes out there also. 

If you're looking for a great place where the locals go, check this place out.We enjoyed it so much we decided to go back one more time before we left town and I'm sure we'll be back again.

1627691,2009-07-17,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I wanted to love Hash House a Go Go. It just didn't work out.

I've heard a lot of good things about Hash House, especially from people whose opinions are always right on.

I bought a coupon from restaurant.com while I was at work, and for the rest of the day my mouth was watering - the anxiety!

I drove to the other side of the valley to eat here with 3 friends.
For some reason, it was almost dead when we entered. I decided this was a good thing, because you usually get better service.

They bring out biscuits that look like they were baked in a cake pan. Whipped butter, honey. The biscuits are amazing, but very filling.

The menu is overwhelming. I was told to order the Sage Chicken and waffles with maple reduction. I decided against it. I ordered the Boston Hash, which was severely disappointing. I love potatoes in any form. I didn't remember seeing ""scrambled eggs"" on the description, but they were on my plate. There was some asparagus, too. The fresh fruit was nowhere near ripe. 

My friends ordered the ribs, a huge chicken salad with bacon, and the salmon. They were HUGE (But I felt that the plates used for the ribs and the salad should be switched)! Mine seemed more reasonable, which is what I was going for.

The crab cake was no good. They need to use less bread crumbs and more crab. The potatoes should be cut into smaller pieces. The mixture of the potatoes/tomatoes did not work for me, possibly due to the fact that the potatoes were covered in seasoning and the tomatoes were just plain and unnecessary.

They are famous for their huge portions and odd pairings. One thing I did not understand was the branch of rosemary stuck somewhere on every plate they brought out.

The service was horrible. I was eating with 3 people that have worked in the restaurant/service industry before. One of them for 10 years. We all agree that it was horrible service. He was a jerk. It's called HASH House, you'd think it wouldn't be a problem to substitute one sort of chicken for the other on a SALAD. The waiter was an asshole about it. Very abrupt and never checked on us. I gave him the worst tip I've ever given and didn't feel bad. In addition, I couldn't use my coupon because I was like $3 short of $50. Instead of telling me to order a side to go or put a dessert on the bill in order to use the $25 coupon, he ran my card anyway. A good server would've suggested that.

I'm not sure if I want to come back. I think I'll give the gift certificate to my brother, and he can enjoy it.

3 stars because apparently I ordered the worst thing on the menu and everyone else was happy. Just my luck! 
Also, the portions and excellent music. Otherwise, 2 stars.",iyhqoE49PTX2VNITzpDw6w,0,0,2,JTUFwEqImcY3n1yGs6gkYA

My typical order is the #4 hash, pancakes, whole wheat toast.

We ordered: 
- brown sugar banana flapjack
- mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach house hash
- Andy's sage fried chicken benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit (appeared on Man vs. Food)

Everything was so savory and delicious! If this place was in the bay area, I would be here every Saturday morning, or more! I can't wait to eat at this place again the next time I'm in Vegas.

I found that not only is steroids being found in baseball, cycling, Olympics, etc.  the world of food is on steroids as well.  Hash House is as blatant as Barry Bonds.   The words I think of when thinking about the meals found here...bountiful, steroids, grazing, hearty, heart-attack, eccentric, eye-opening, scary, etc.

The fried chicken is plump and juicy.  The eggs are plump and juicy.  The sausage is plump and juicy.  The waffles are plump and juicy.  The French toast is plump and juicy. 

I prefer the French toast over the waffles because they were more fluffy.  I didn't try the flapjacks because they freaked me out.  Pancakes the size of a medium pizza is no joke.  Maybe next time though.  Still want to try the watermelon kiwi lemonade as well.

They have a full bar and feature some Midwestern kitsch - such as Milwaukees Best in a brown bag as one of the menu items.  Love the attitude on the menu.

What's not to love about mashed potatoes, biscuits, gravy, fried chicken and cheese all rolled into one huge portion of amazingness? Nothing. That's what. And I had leftovers which is always a plus.

The restaurant was clean, not too bright for my hungover self and the service was totally fine. My friends all had Bloody Marys and which the sight of them made me want to yack, I guess those guys enjoyed theirs.

If you like American comfort food you will absolutely adore this place. The decor, ambience and service are great! I had a great time meeting a buddy of my BF here and tried some of his pasta dish. The pasta was very, very good. The fried chicken on top of it I avoided. They like to put branches of rosemary on top of their dishes here. We jokingly referred to them as trees. My BF and I shared some BBQ ribs which had a BBQ sauce that tasted more like teriyaki than anything. It would have been good if the meat was not so fall off the bones tender. Plus the meat didn't have a smoky flavor. They call their food ""Twisted Farm Food"" and indeed it is. There are many things you will notice about your plate that will give you that idea. Their biscuits are not bad. They have a sweet sauce drizzled on them but they are a bit too big for your mouth and a little too hard. I had a mango tea. Be warned - refills are $1.

Ordered two appetizers, and two dishes for main course and got a few of their specialty drinks.  Wow, the food came out all together and let me tell you the PORTIONS ARE HUGE. Split dishes, don't bother doing it all by yourself or plan on taking home food with you.

I have seen a few reviews that say you may wait in line before you can get a table at this place, but my husband and I did not have that issue.  We went during the late afternoon/early evening and got right in.

The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  After placing your order you receive a complimentary order of home made biscuits....did you catch that?  Let me say that again...

After placing your order you receive a COMPLIMENTARY ORDER of HOME MADE BISCUITS!!  I was like Whaaat?!?!  :D

Trust me, they melt in your mouth!

I highly recommend ordering the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  That was literally the best fried chicken, and the best waffles I have ever eaten.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The chicken is just the right texture of brown and crispy.  The waffles were cooked long enough to where you had that ever so slight ""crunch"" when you bit into them, but the insides were warm and soft.  

I should also mention that the waffles had ribbons of crispy bacon baked right into them!  I am not talking about the semi-cooked soggy bacon that most places sling on your plate in a lazy stupor.  (You know what I am talking about...the kind where you KNOW it's not cooked all the way).  That bacon CRUNCHES when you bite into your waffle!

Hands down this place is wonderful.  I literally dragged my husband through the sick, sad casino to get a load of this place.  It was well worth it.  This place is likely rocking around 2am-6am when people are just leaving the bars, so if you go late at night, be prepared to wait.  If you go during the daytime, you will likely have better luck.  Regardless of what time you decide to go, make sure you stop by this place, you will NOT regret it!

The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5?  You guessed it.  It's in the Imperial Palace.",FglfuBIiAjNrBIJU-qH9EA,0,0,4,0JoZUL3qB45YcnBpqQNhAA

Note #2: there are 3 or 4 of these in Vegas, I ate at the new Linq casino and hotel, nice atmosphere!

Winner winner! A totally unique restaurant concept with oversized, high quality food and drinks, plus an energetic wait staff. I was told it was a 40-minute wait but it turned out to be only 20 minutes tops (930 AM weekday). 

The food is exquisitely prepared, menu is highly creative blue collar Americana cuisine, and they use plenty of herbs and spices to make the presentations and tastes go way north of blue collar food. 

The portions are about 1.5-2 times what you would expect from any restaurant serving similar American food.  A bit pricey yes, but not ridiculously so (breakfasts are about $13.00-18.00, and considering you're in Vegas where steaks routinely go for $55.00-60.00, this is a small premium for a great American, creative, and gargantuan breakfast.  
Fresh squeezed OJ, any kind of side you want, and it appears from the menu that the owners are from Indiana, cuz they serve up that pork tenderloin and fried chicken like total Hoosiers! (This is a smallish chain with about 8 locations, mostly in Vegas, but also Chicago, Orlando, San Diego, and Mohegan Sun Casino, CT).

Ok, I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. It was amazing and I didn't regret not getting the famous waffles and Fried Chicken, which looked so large and beautiful that I wanted the dish after I saw a few of them come out of the kitchen.

It was really bland and just a pile of mashed potatoes with a dry biscuit split on top and a fried chicken breast on top of that.

So we told Omar and while we took the plate to replace the food, he wasn't empathetic in the least bit. In fact, approximately 5 minutes after bringing the replacement plate of food he just assumed that we wanted nothing else and brought our bill to the table. So I put my payment card in the bill and tip folder and I handed it to him. When he returned it for my signature he oddly placed the folder on the opposite side of the table at the furthest edge from me.

I get home and google pictures of my duck dish and there it was, the chef forgot the cashews and spice. my duck was so bland, I didn't even taste salt, and it was suppose to be spicy. Plus it was over cooked. 3 major issues! What!?!?

Also at 830 the staff mopped the bar area, started prepping the table for I'm sure tomorrow's breakfast, ketchup, hot sauce and sugar.

I love many things about this place. The decor, the huge menu, the portions. Yes, the portions are big enough for you to share, take home, and have for maybe another meal. Or two. But it's good yumy food.

I've had many items off their menu. French Toast, waffles, corned beef, their amazing variety of flapjacks, scrambles... Today's choice was Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with Bacon Waffles. Fried Chicken isn't traditional, but still good. Belgian-style waffles with slices of bacon in-between. I don't really need to say much about that. Isn't everything better with bacon?? Just kidding...

The other highlight was the Blueberry Pecan flapjacks. Nutty and fruity fluffy soft pancakes drizzled with warm maple syrup. Nom nom nom... My son even gobbled it up.

Their service is great, the only thing that takes awhile is your food to arrive. It wasn't unreasonable, and you kind of forget about it once your ginormous plate of food arrives. The manager always comes around when plates are cleared to inquire how our meal were.

The prices are pretty hefty for breakfast, but you do get a lot for what you paid. I have two take-out boxes in my fridge right now...

The seasoning was perfect but if you don't like sweet then I wouldn't order it. The waffles were also cooked well and tastes like they are homemade. I will definitely go back is there were a lot of options on menu. Location was busy but expected on a Saturday Morning around 11-Noon. I sat at bar as I was solo.

Or just fried potatoes with a crab-flavored bread patty on top.  When you figure what you spent on a too-huge portion of carbs it doesn't add up.  One person can't eat it all, but too often you discover you don't want to eat most of it.  I'd love to have good diner hash....or good diner anything...instead of these supposedly updated versions.

The server didn't seem to know what beer they had and they didn't have anything on tap.  And then he tried to convince me that the Sierra Nevada was a Hefeweizen while it was actually a Pale Ale.  And I wouldn't have minded normally, but I really dislike Sierra Nevada... :( 
We ordered the tiger prawns with chili mayo appetizer. The presentation was pretty creative.  They skewered 3 deep fried prawns and stuck it on a large watermelon wedge.  The flavour was actually just okay... I've had better.. and only 3 prawns???? :-S

The Chicken and Waffles though were quite filling and tasty.  I prefer more maple syrup, but they were happy to bring it. And the portions are huge.  Definitely share a dish! 

When the bill came, there were several discrepancies between the menu prices for the beers and the bill prices.  So what could have and should have been a 3 or 4 star, is now actually 2 stars.

Update:

Management has replied to this review by stating this is company policy and that they were undoubtedly preparing for a ""busier time.""  I understand company policies and procedures but to tie your employees hands by not letting them make simple decisions (restaurant is not busy, this customer wants to sit here, he won't be more than 1/2 hour, what the heck let's make him happy) is a policy that will keep this potential customer from ever stepping one foot in the doors of this establishment.

We placed our order with the waiter and my meal came out within 5 minutes with my husband's order no where in sight. My order was not only wrong but also cold. 
We let the waiter know. During this he interrupted me multiple times and whisked my plate away.
Round two of bad food and service: my husband's meal shows up. It's fine. Mine comes back. Cold again. Let the waiter know, again. More interrupting, more whisking away. The third time is the charm as my food comes out piping hot. But that was mostly because the kitchen staff put the plate in oven so it was too hot to touch. By the way, this is a kitchen trick to teach the customer a lesson. ""You want it hot? You'll get it hot!!""
The manager did comp both meals (not necessary as my husband's was fine). She handled the situation very well.

The biscuit was so buttery and fresh and warm, and like everything here HUGE. I usually love me some carbs, but I could not finish the biscuit or the rest of the meal. The food was great the prices matched the huge portions, not overprices but accordingly to the amount of food you get. My entree was one of the simpler ones and it was 9 bucks, everything else was above that. Only bad experience was someone straight threw up in there. Was walking aND ""bleeaaaaacgh!"" *splaash*. I was confused as to what happened when I heard it and saw a guy running out, until I saw the horrified look on a puke-splattered woman.

This place is FREAKIN' awesome!!

We arrived at the right time (between 11:30a-12:00p on a Monday) because we were seated almost immediately. Shortly, a crowd of customers were gathering in the waiting area. We ordered our drinks then preceded to take a closer look at the menu.

I was COMPLETELY overwhelmed by the menu because EVERYTHING looked so good! There were four of us total and I didn't want to order the same thing as someone else, so that we could all have a taste of something different, I ordered the House smoked salmon benedict with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs. The rest of the table ordered: Andy's Sage Chicken with waffles, Corned Beef hash with red onions and swiss cheese, and Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. 

I totally surprised myself in ordering the salmon benedict. I'm not much of a fish person and the idea of having it for breakfast sort of disturbs me. But I was glad that I ordered it, I really enjoyed the chili cream because it gave the dish a nice kick. We were kind of disappointed in Andy's fried chicken because it didn't have as much flavor as we had expected. It was  TOTALLY under seasoned! Another dish that surprised me was the corned beef hash. I was sort of expecting a pile of hash that looked like something that came out of the can, but it was actual strips of corned beef. They were nicely seasoned and quite tasty! I would have eaten more, but it wasn't the dish that I ordered. 

The price for a single dish ranges from $11-15 bucks, which is SUPER reasonable for the amount of food you're served. A single order of food can easily feed two people. 

I will definitely visit Hash House A Go Go on my next trip to Vegas because you just don't find that kind of breakfast food anywhere else!!",Q9NS4wBAJLm2qIMeIUWmxg,1,1,4,FSGY34UPl9UQCP9-UkLn5w

From the Hash section Miles went with the roasted chicken Hash

and brein went with the Meatloaf Hash (Shocker?) Bill went for the Indiana Favorites section and got Sage Fried Chicken with eggs.

Kerie and I thought eggs Benedict sounded good (and possibly a smaller choice...just by looking at the plates being delivered to other tables...we were very wrong). She got the Crispy Hammered Pork Benedict

And I the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Starting from the bottom mine had 2 huge home made biscuits, about 2 cups of mashed potatoes (Crisped on the griddle), fresh spinach and tomato slices, 2 slices of crispy bacon, about 8 oz of melted mozzarella cheese, scrambled eggs (looked like 2 or 3), and then the largest fried chicken breast I've ever seen with chipotle Creme poured on top.

1855281,2010-04-02,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This place is like the white guy in ""The Great White Hope"" all hype but it can't deliver.

The girl who seated us was friendly and the tables were a good size, but it pretty much went downhill from there.

Our waitress was abrupt and they have a lot of hidden policies.  When I asked if I could make substitute the side on the dish I wanted from one potato product to another I was told ""no substitutions.""  This is crazy.  I know what the kitchen looks like, it has a bunch of containers full of potato products next to each other.  I was just asking them to scoop the potato from the container next to it, not rework the main part of the dish.  If no substitutions are allowed, you should put that on your  menu.

So, instead of the mix grill, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  One friend ordered their signature dish, the Fried Chicken Benedict, and another also got the Chicken and Waffles to split with his wife.  Then we were told that there is a $2.50 extra plate charge, unless we wanted to order another side for a few bucks, which just so happens to come with an extra plate.  Which would be fine, except they don't have this policy listed anywhere on the menu.  

So we wait and she plops some biscuits on the table, which were pretty good, but still just biscuits.  Then our main dishes arrive.

Disgusting is the only word I can use to describe this meal.  Everything is coated in syrup, but not enough to taste any syrup, just enough to make everything sticky and they don't give you more syrup so you can add more if you wish.  The breading on the chicken is thick and completely flavourless (it took me quite a while to find even a hint of sage in the breading).  The waffles were alright, but tasted like they come from a box mix.  The worst part is not a single one of us got a dish that had any seasoning.  Out of three dishes and a side, not a single one had a speck of salt or pepper on it that we did not add ourselves with the shakers.  Not the chicken, not the potatoes, not the egg on the benedict.  

Food NEEDS seasoning.  To completely leave it out of everything you make is an insult not only to your customers but the food itself.

Word of advice, save your money and go to any one of the other, cheaper, breakfast places.  You'll be much happier.",6aJ_WRWa3C3o0A3EXYyEmw,2,1,1,wHtwZfUxhj6GwMRWyQaQBg

Meatloaf to die for. And the fried chicken...whoa. In fact, the best bite of food I've ever eaten may have been the following: at the end of trying (and failing) to finish my chicken and waffles, I scraped up from the plate bits of the sage buttermilk breading from the chicken, waffle scraps, and bacon shreds - all of which were sitting in a pool of maple syrup.

Service was a bit slow as the server was never to be found. It took about 10 mins for her to take our order. Heard of this place from a couple of friends and Man Vs. Food, so we wanted to check it out.

We ordered the Mango Ice Tea: For the price and no refills, I was expecting something great but it was plain old ice tea you can get anywhere. 

Fried Chicken Benedict: Man Vs. Food favorite, The Fried Chicken was lightly breaded and very dry.Didnt taste like fried chicken to me. I could barely taste any egg, but the cream sauce was good though.

I had never heard of it, so I decided to do some research and check out their website online prior to going.  My mouth was watering even before ever going there!

We got there right as soon as the place opened.  We opted to not go to the one on the strip because we figured it would be much busier.  There were people waiting outside, and soon after we were seated, the rush began and didn't stop when we left.

Our waitress was cute and dorky.  Actually, most of the staff seemed to be right up that alley, but it all had a very smooth way of working out in the best interest of the business and created a nice atmosphere.

I decided to try the corned beef hash (obviously I am a huge fan) and my fiance had the sage fried chicken benedict.  HOLY CRAP.  I knew the pictures online made the food look big, but I never imagined that the portions would be like this.  YOU CAN EASILY SPLIT A MEAL WITH SOMEONE IF YOU WANTED TO AND STILL BE STUFFED.  My hash came out with CHUNKS of corned beef, not the crap from the can.  It seemed fresh like they just got it out of the crock pot and was piled with a mound of crispy potatoes and swiss cheese.  My fiance's food was AMAZING too!  I cannot even begin to describe the abundance of flavor in the sage chicken!

I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone who likes good food and a lot of it.  I would have taken my leftovers with us, but we were in a hotel that didn't have a mini-fridge or microwave for reheating.

I had the sage fried chicken with bacon mashed potatoes and a biscuit. The chicken surprised me because I was expecting the more traditional salty crispy fried chicken (I'm sure that what I got is the same as what they  serve with their famous chicken and waffles). But instead of salty, it had a nice sweetness from a maple reduction. As good as it was, I missed the saltiness. But that's just me. It was crispy and tender and just fine. The mashed potatoes were great, eggs were just ordinary eggs, and I thought the biscuit was a bit heavy but their homemade strawberry jam was yummy.

20 minute wait for lunch on a Saturday around 11AM, pretty standard.
We were seated at a cocktail table in the bar area and I really liked our server- Kelli?, lady with spiky hair and friendly, casual demeanor like a female Guy Fieri.

BF ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, and highly suggested that I order the Kokomo meatloaf sandwich- so I did, with the house salad for the side instead of fries.  Portions for both are enormous and we could have easily shared just one dish, but wanted to try more than one dish. And now my guy has dinner to take with him to work tonight, so it all works out. $30 and change before tip.

Fried chicken and waffles- chicken is actually pretty moist and flavorful, waffles weren't bad but also weren't my thing. Accents of fried leeks and some roasted peppers made this better than I expected. Didn't go overboard with the maple syrup.
Meatloaf sandwich is hefty- ate about a third of it and had my fill of the flavors. Liked the tomato sauce, felt the mozzarella taste was masked by stronger flavors but the texture broke up the meat and bread a bit. Heavy and rich, even if you're hungry, split it.

Ultimately, my careful picking at each dish and my hungry guy eating what he wanted (damn his metabolism!) only made half of each meal disappear. While many reviews here indicate that the kitchen is more focused on quantity than quality, the flavors weren't bad but given the gigantic portions, easily get redundant.

I know that part of the schtick is to be over the top...with the portions, with the bacon, everything over the top...I get it. But at a certain point, it's just kind of wasteful. I can't believe this is me saying that, but Hash House took me there. 

The Sage Fried Chicken was delicious. I wish it weren't just breasts, though...moist, juicy thighs are where its at. I know what you're thinking, and cut it out. The tower of bacon waffles? Delicious, but why a tower? Who's gonna eat all these waffles? And don't get pissy when we need more syrup! 

The Grilled Meatloaf Hash was pretty good. Lots of meatloaf, fried potatoes, and red and yellow peppers. Huge amount of this hash next to a little mound of two scrambled eggs. I really like my eggs, and I felt bad that they were so outnumbered. Three eggs and half as much hash would suit me fine. 

The Bacon Bloody Mary. For the love of all that does not suck....I wanted to love it. I had so been looking forward to it. I don't know what the frig is going on in this world, but it seems to be a recent trend that everyone feels the need to make their Bloody Mary spicy as all hell. Hash House isn't just along for that ride, they bought the damned airline. IMO, Tabasco should *accent* the flavors in a Bloody, waking the whole thing up, leaving behind a slight spicy flavor that pleasantly lingers....it should not be a dominant, overwhelming aftertaste without the drink being ordered that way. Kind of like everything else here, it's just too over the top without needing to be so. 

Service was just fine, although I didn't quite dig the practice of going ahead and adding 18 percent gratuity under the line ""large party"". Since it was just two of us, they were either insulting us by calling us large, or insulting us because we're cheapskates that used their gift certificate offer on restaurants dot com. Either way, unappreciated. I'm in the industry, and you have to really suck to not get 20 percent and have that rounded up to the next dollar....even more if you don't suck. You were great, but you're saying 18 percent. So 18 percent it is, then. Oh well.",pMUP-gcUBPyy51MzapFuoQ,0,0,3,YjIJ01fvK3DK9Kbi9hsl0Q

Hubby and I shared the sage fried chicken.  It was OK.  The portions are outlandishly large.  The biscuit was too dry and no where as good as the biscuits at the Pork Store  restaurant in SF.  I liked the mashed potatoes. 
Many diners left 1/3 to 1/2 of the food on their plates which would've been more than welcomed by the homeless folks hanging out on the Strip.
Service was good and as we were sitting by the kitchen, you'd hear the staff yell as they go in and out to warn others they were on the move. 
The place is crowded with a wait of 20 mins for us in the AM.  Hubby says he'd go back to try other things when we return to LV again. The menu is extensive.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,2,1,3,KfI17C1HEEBIgTArkWTYzg

1939060,2014-09-09,9,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I recently moved just down the street from what will certainly kill me, Hash House a Go Go. I say kill me because it is very likely I will eat here 2-3 times a day until I literally explode. It's really good. But if I could Tarantino this review and skip backwards in time...

Chapter 1: The terrible Advice
When I first moved to Vegas in a discussion about food two people who's opinions I value warned me against going to Hash House. Its overrated they said, the food is really bad they said, chicken and waffles is gross they said. Like an IDIOT I listened to them and didnt go to Hash House until my 4th year living here.

Chapter 2: The house that hash built

Once I moved to Sahara I thought to myself, ""Self, what if they are wrong? What if Hash House is as good as yelpers say? I mean, my friends are idiots, I don't know why I listen to them about anything..."". So I decided to try it on a Saturday afternoon. When I walked in the place was packed and I was told at least a 20 minute wait. We were seated in about 5 minutes which is good because after a mere 5 minutes I was ready to murder several customers to eat the food I had seen recently delivered to them. 

Chapter 3: That's a big flapjack
A lot of the reviews discuss portion size, and I'll admit the portions are bonkers- I am a warm blooded American who doesn't quit anything from war to to tee ball games where I'm down 20 runs, but even I had to tap out after eating only 5lbs of my 10lb flapjack. The side of potatoes went largely untouched. All in all I felt a great deal of post eating shame at how much food I had left over, maybe that's just cause I was raised Catholic.  I will say I found it a bit preposterous that when they delivered this 20 inch in diameter flapjack that they gave me approx 1/2 a tea spoon of butter and like 4 ml of syrup. After explaining to the waitress that I was a human man and would be requiring more they brought 2 more little cups... Come on Hash House get it together- the only people who eat pancakes without drowning them in syrup are masochists and the criminally insane. A pancake isn't even really a food- its just a utensil designed to ferry butter and syrup from the plate into my gullet. 

Chapter 4: The Menu

This was tough. There were at least 10 things i wanted to immediately order but having seen the size of the portions I knew getting 10 entrees would be a tad excessive. This will require future visits to try everything and answer some philosophical questions like what is the difference between a hash and a scramble? How much can I eat before I die like that guy in Seven? How drunk can I get at 10AM on a Tuesday?",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,7,6,5,JlbIOEMFqYU13jUd2CGsRA

I have to say that despite it being a busy holiday weekend, the service at the bar was impeccable.  They were engaging, friendly, and clearly working their tails off.  

That's where the good stuff ended though.  The menu looked great at first glance, and we had a difficult time deciding what to order... so we asked for help from the bartender.  She recommended the fried chicken, biscuit, potato breakfast dish.  It seemed like a good choice, but when it arrived, it was honestly just too much.  Too many components... too large of portions... you honestly couldn't tell where one thing started and another thing ended.  It was just a huge bunch of slop on a plate.  We shared it, and there was still plenty leftover.  I think if they had a more restrained concept of the dish, it would've worked so much better.  The mimosas (tangerine and pineapple) were okay.  I wish we would've tried one of the delicious looking iced coffee drinks we saw headed to other tables.

Buddy and I both ordered Stellas at the bar. Took a good 15+ min to deliver the order because something was a bit weird with the machine. The bartender told us drinks were on him for the inconvenience. So that was cool. 

I ordered the Mashed Potatoes & Bacon Burger. 
First impression was....eh it isnt that big. After eating half the burger i determined that the size itself wasnt the issue it was the lack of depth. 

The beef patties arent seasoned so they have a very generic taste. The mashed potatoes were too light in flavor and contributed very little to the overall burger cept for filler and the bacon was just bacon. There was no stable meat to condiment ratio. Each bite was like getting punched in the face with flavorless beef.

The fries were good and the meal was good for how much we paid for them. If i ever go back i'm going to order something other then the burgers.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,1,3,oDb-cUqZHit4Y_ztvFntug

I was intrigued with how cool the place seemed overall but a bit apprehensive since she has steered me down the wrong path once.  At this place, they offered a bunch of typical breakfast fare with a sort of a modern fusion twist.  That is the best that I can describe it.  Be prepared, the portions are HUGE!  I like to think that I have a hearty appetite, but this is enough to share for two--at least for breakfast.  Dinner or lunch might be a bit different.

SERVICE
We showed up on a Monday morning and the place was hopping at 10:30.  We didn't have to wait too long before our table became readily available.  Overall, the service was great and friendly.  We were checked upon often and coffee cups were always refilled.

FOOD
The food was really good and impressed with how fresh things tasted.  No Krusteaz Costco pancake mix here!  Here is a breakdown of what we ordered.
- Banana Brown Sugar Pancake: Holy moly!  They serve up a whopping huge pancake that is almost served up on a serving platter.  I would say that the pancake is about 1.5 feet in diameter.  My husband could only tear through about half of it.  The brown sugar was a nice touch as it was added to the top of the pancake and then browned to almost caramel.  OH!  They also have different flavors of pancakes, different fruits, coconut mango, snickers and more!
- Bacon Waffle: If you are a fan of the salty sweet.  This is a must try.  When I ordered it, I thought that there would be sprinkles of bacon throughout the waffle.  Instead, there were actual strips which crisscrossed throughout the waffle.  Fancy.

TIP #1: Come hungry.  Do not order any sides since all portions are literally super sized.

TIP #2: If you can, come on a weekday vs. a weekend.  This place gets ridiculously crazy busy.",DJAiPhpkitdhn7REAyfZww,1,0,5,y4NNlEBCpjIK6MHnh_35yg

The four of us ordered 3 dishes, but really, we should have ordered two because the waiter tricked us when he said the chorizo hash was for one person. Really? One person who wants a heart attack! It was ginormous. I knew we had made a mistake the moment I got up to go to the restroom and started eyeballing everyone's plates. 

Sage fried chicken and waffles - They do their chicken right here! While I'm not a big fan of sage, I do appreciate a good piece of fried chicken that is moist, fried well and not oily. The chicken here was delicious. The waffles had a piece of bacon baked right into it. It tasted ok though, too soggy. I like my waffles crispy.

Chorizo hash - This was yummy, but there was more potato (freaking huge pieces) then chorizo. I wanted to taste more meat. Had a nice spicy kick to it. Wanted to really eat the more of the biscuit on the side, but held off because it was way too much carbs. But overall, a good solid dish. 

Snickers pancakes - It was good and of course huge, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Nothing unique about have pieces of snickers embedded into pancake. I really want to try a fruity pancake next time. 

I also got to try a watermelon/apple slush drink (good...tasted like a jolly rancher) and a  bloody mary (strong!). Hash house definitely leaves your taste buds with an impression. =P

I've tried a few different dishes here, for breakfast and dinner.  For the dinner dishes we've had the pot pie, which is an interesting twist on the norm. It can best be described as a soup poured over mashed potatoes with the crust on top. 
The meatloaf with pasta is served with linguine pasta.

Throw a different style of noodle in the boiling water and make your customer happy, it's not difficult. As for the flavor, I didn't care for it.

1980487,2010-04-01,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I have mixed emotions about this place. First of all, good grief the lines! I must have passed by the restaurant several times during my vacation before I found the place without a line out the door. (Mid-week, 6pm-ish).

The look of the place is cool. I like the rustic, shabby-chic thing they have going on. The staff were great. The hostess was busy seating someone when I came in, but the very nice lady at the bar informed me she'd be right back. I was seated within 5-minutes of walking in the door. A fantastic start.

My server was Tiffany, same woman from the bar when I entered. She was so nice and friendly and has a great sense of humor (as I asked her if she was stalking me). She took my drink order and let me look at the biiig menu. I had gone in to the restaurant craving BBQ, but saw the Chicken and Waffles on the menu and had to have them. 

As I waited for my meal to arrive, someone brought me the HHAGG (horrible acronym) version of pre-meal bread. A Big-Ass-Biscuit (no, they didn't call it that). Buttermilk biscuit with honey glaze on it served with whipped honey butter and honey on the side. I only took a couple of bites because I saw the dishes coming out for other diners and I knew I'd better not eat the whole thing. Flavor of the biscuit was good. It was, however, a bit on the dry side.

My meal showed up and I had to bust out laughing. Seriously? That is one giant tower of food. All held together with a giant skewer and a knife stabbed through it. Tiffany said they 'don't mess around'. clearly!

And here's where the mixed emotions come in. The chicken was definitely missing something. I wish I knew what, but it was just so bland. I thought perhaps I was missing some nuance of flavor, so I took a moment to drink some water and pulled a piece of just chicken. The meat was just slightly dry and completely void of flavor. Huh? I tore off some of the fried skin/coating and tired that, which was also bordering on flavorless. How could this be? I can see flecks of .. well .. something in the coating. I don't get it. Bummer.

The Waffles, however, were heaven. Waffles with bacon cooked right inside, covered in syrup. Mmmmm. Sweet and salty heaven. If I could have had just a plate of those waffles, I'd have been a happy soul. Tiffany mentioned that they sometimes have a pancake with bacon AND chocolate chips in it. Holy Cow! I'd love to try that.

I would definitely come here again, preferably with several hungry friends that all order something different and are willing to share tastes. And I'd probably ask to sit in Tiffany's area because she was a real superstar, fun and friendly.",pIgPxKMoAhRqZboAAi1_iA,1,0,3,u1mMnGs8QiufF84anIzVZw

The cab ride was a bit pricey because the restaurant was far from the airport but a friend wanted to try this place so we gave it a Go Go... Hehe ok that wasn't funny.  It probably sounded more funny when I was typing it out.

We came to Hash House at about 11:00AM on a Saturday and had to wait for about 30 minutes.  The place was busy and did not take reservations on weekends.  I'm not sure if they take it on weekdays.

I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The portions were huge and the chicken was decent.  The dish included four waffles, each with a strip of bacon inside the waffle.  When my dish came out, I looked at it and said, ""Hell no I'm eating this thing..."" but to my surprise, it was actually pretty good.  I never thought  fried chicken, bacon, waffles, and syrup would taste good together.  Service is average so expect to wait a little.

All in all, a good place to have breakfast.  One portion is more than enough for two people.  The price is really good at about 13 bucks for the chicken and waffle, which could feed a family of four without a big appetite.  I finished all of my chicken but only ate one of the waffles.

2008611,2010-07-06,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Vegas gets a lot of international visitors, many of whom are in the U.S. for the first time.  So as a public service, let me explain a vital aspect of American culture: we like things to be big (note the casino-resorts on the Strip, the Grand Canyon and monster trucks).

This goes for food as well--we want it tasty and in massive portions (if it tastes great on the first bite, it'll be excellent on the 2,456th bite).  So, foreign tourists, if you haven't fed at the American food trough, you should, but make sure it's a tasty place.  

Enter Hash House A Go Go (""HHAGG"").  The pancakes come bigger than your head (and in a stack of three).  Prefer eggs?  The omelettes coming out of the kitchen are the size of a chicken.  And, unlike the generic buffets being offered at the casino-resorts, the food at HHAGG has flair.  The plating is creative and the food is simple, but imaginative--picture the classic steak and eggs just back from a European vacation and testing out French fashion on American soil.   

So why only four stars?  Well, for all the food's glitz and gigantic size, the taste is relatively straightforward.  HHAGG advertises that it serves ""farm food"" and while they do a good job with the classic tastes, there just isn't anything unique or amazing.  

That said, after a rough night on the town, there are few dishes that satisfy as well as the O'Hare of the Dog (24 oz beer in a paper bag and 7 strips of bacon).  Final take: the food is solid and the place offers a great experience.  One of the better breakfast places in Vegas.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,3,4,4GGxFmSKCyREa18t4Iw5dw

I am a MVF regular, and somehow I missed this episode.  I found this gem with my fabulous Yelp app.  We love to hit up a delicious place on the drive back to Phoenix and the Hash House did not disappoint.

Before we pulled up, I was expecting to see a hole-in-the-wall type of dive-y place (with a name like ""hash house"" that is what I pictured),  man was I off!  Nice prominent outside and an inside atmosphere that feels modern/industrial and yet cozy/family environment at the same time.  

The walk from the door to the hostess stand was a little icy . . . the two girls didn't smile at all, however they did quickly seat us, which was nice.  Our server was great, I forget her name (sorry). She explained that they don't use microwaves or heat lamps; as soon as your food is ready, you get it.  Very cool! She had a nice positive energy, like someone who enjoyed her job.  

Like all of the other reviews say, the food is phenomenal!  And the portions are HUGE!!!  Some of the most unique and creative menu items, yet all sound like the most delicious dish ever.  My BF got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, eggs, and bacon.  I am not a huge fan of fried chicken, but this might have turned me.  Melt in your mouth, moist chicken and a perfect, well-seasoned, light, crispy breading. Yum!

And my breakfast was one of my favorite breakfasts of all time.  A vegetable hash with artichokes, mushrooms, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes . . . you know all the good stuff . . . not the silly filler veggies of normal breakfast places.  Served with potatoes and two eggs (over-medium) so I can spread the runny yolk all over my vegetable goodness.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about you.  Your's will too . . . just check out my pics of this stuff!

Oh, and how could I forget the homemade biscuits and homemade jam (""strawberry today"" the server told us).  Again, I've never been a huge biscuit fan, but these were by far the best I've ever had.  Huge, softball size, light, flaky, buttery.  And that jam . . . oh, my goodness, I HAVE to go back!!

I almost shed a tear when I couldn't take home my leftovers, there was no where to stash them for the 5 hour drive home.  Whaw, whaw, whaaaaawn.

Next time . . . I will not wait until the last morning of my trip to go back!  As a matter of fact, we may just have to hit Hash House a Go Go on the way into Vegas next time!!",4DaYRzOMGcn2zoWkHLNBjA,2,3,5,DUYVRLu0KCOqaPvzx8ionw

2039071,2013-11-10,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Seating: This place has an uppity, progressive/hipster environment with a good build-out and a decent seating arrangement. 

Environment: This place attempts to create an oxymoron by juxtaposing two seemingly unrelated things: farm food and cool,young,progressive/hipsters. This kinda seems like they are making a stab at country food and county people by making it into a novelty. 

Service: The service (after 3 visits) is hit-or-miss. The environment is that of a hipster, ""cool person"" hang out. A lot of the servers have an alternative look with tattoos and piercings and less than everyday hairdos. So, sometimes the servers act cool and laid-back. This leads to them being slow and unattentive at times because they are too busy being laid back and cool. We ordered coffee three times. Refills were slow every time. If you're a morning coffee person and you're paying $2.25+ for coffee, you expect refills. Although I will say, the coffee here is excellent.

Food: Food is pretty good. Good presentation. Large Portions. Cooked well. 
Like I said, it seems like they are attempting to create a menu of  totally exaggerated, larger than life dishes. Fattening, full of butter, oil, and starchy carbohydrates, just like you would eat on a farm (so they think.) However, true country people that grew up on a farm needed all the extra calories because they were working their butts off all day outside. This restaurant plays on the idea of being a country, farmer ""hick"" by hyperbolizing and exaggerating the consumption of high fat, high sugar, ""corn fed"" food. 

Overall: I would recommend anyone try this at least once. I'm not all about the cool person, tatted-up, slow service environment. But, if you are, you may enjoy it.",a28y5uZ_J1Ge_rvA2xoyqQ,0,0,3,3FMVKA-5QWo0fu5ZGJ81-A

Service is amazing and servers are super friendly. The line was  long but surprisingly the wait was not too bad. They have a nice little area for you to chill in while you wait. The menu is great /w tons of breakfast options (although they do have lunch as well). I ordered the benedicts which came w/ a chipotle hollandaise AMAZING! The eggs were placed over a freshly baked biscuit which in its self was bomb. They make their own jam and to tell u the truth, i could have just ordered the biscuit and jam and i would have still given them 5 stars! Try the watermelon kiwi lemon aid  which is a tri colored fruity drink with a big watermelon wedge. They do have an outdoor dining patio which looked really nice .

2046883,2011-08-11,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Well, I broke my own rule and tried this place again. I am so angry at myself for doing it. I could have gone to The Peppermill and really enjoyed the fantastic food and the whole Vegas feel of the place. But I didn't. I went here instead and got the same thing I got last time I was here. Pre-made warmed over tasteless mush. 
         It shocks me that they tell me i can't substitute anything because it will compromise there dishes. Now, how the hell do you tell someone that and then refuse to allow eggs over easy after 11am? Completely ruins some of the dishes that need the yoke to make the taste and keep it moist. Scrambled eggs in the salmon Benedict turns it to dried out crap. Just floors me every time i think about it.
         I ordered what used to be my favorite, the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs Benedict. This is a rather complicated dish to make and it took them less than 5 minutes to bring it to my table. Can you say pre-made? No way are they cooking this to order. The chicken is a full breast of chicken with Corn flakes and a few other things on the outside then deep fried. This takes much longer to fully cook than about 3 minutes. 
         When I took the first bite it was just how I remembered it the last time I was there. Luke warm, mushy, rather tasteless crap. This place has literally dropped right off the scale as far as I'm concerned. It used to be absolutely fantastic and now I would rather microwave a frozen low cal dinner than to eat here. 
           I was with my mother and she ordered the biscuits and gravy. What the hell happened here? This used to be excellent and now it actually tastes synthetic and rubbery. My mom only finished about half of it and could not stand anymore. This WILL be my last time eating at Hash House. The Peppermill is absolutely fantastic every single time and they don't skimp on anything. That is where you will find me at breakfast time from now on.

After a morning of driving from L.A. and doing some shopping, I was more than ready for some food. So we hit up the yelp and this place hit our radar. 

For a Friday lunch they were kinda slow, but even so the hostess said there'd be a 10-15 minute wait? Odd seeing as we could see empty tables. We opted to do the manly thing and sit in the bar area. Service was great from the bartender.  Ordered was the Ham/Egg Burger $11.95, Spinach salad $8.95 (for some roughage) and the Mac & Cheez $2.95. 

The best thing of the lunch was expelling it from my body the next morning. Sorry, but true. Okay, the fries were good. But this place is such a facade. Facade in that the dishes look appealing and are huge portions, but below the service sits mediocre food. 

The Spinach Salad was over dressed with the raspberry vinegrette to the point that it was sickening sweet. The burger was just a mess. The ham added nothing to the taste and just added to create an even larger mess amongst all the ingredients. The mac-n-cheese was penne pasta with what seemed like a cheap cheese smothering everything. 

So I'm guessing that a lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from hungover breakfast patrons who get blinded by the large portions and appealing plating and just are hungry to the point that they really aren't out for flavor and quality.",CyW_PQkBQ6Wxz71goEICsg,1,1,2,abs4D2d0ovo8OhxP9dGHwQ

For this particular visit, my husband and I arrived around 10 a.m. on a Saturday. It wasn't too crazy, and we were sat right away. My one small compliant for this place was it was rather noisy - I think this mainly had to do with being close to the entrance and the kitchen, but it wasn't unbearable. Our intentions for this visit were to enjoy some delicious breakfast foods paired with coffee and of course mimosas. We received our coffee and mimosas quickly (less than 5 minutes after placing our order). The mimosa was an excellent one with plenty of champagne and not drowning in OJ. It even came with a fresh orange slice on the glass. Fresh brewed coffee was also decent (side note here that they also have Nitro Cold Brew and other very fun choices for hot coffee!). 

Next came the food. My husband had the Chicken Fried Benedict while I enjoyed their famous Chicken and Waffles. The amount of food that came out was astonishing. We could have easily split a single plate. The cream sauce on the Benedict was absolutely perfect. The chicken and waffles got better as I enjoyed the bacon baked right INTO the waffle! They also provided a small pitcher of warm syrup which always makes waffles better. It also went perfectly with the two very large chicken breasts perched on top.

They're located about 5 miles west of the strip on Sahara Ave. Although the place was fairly busy for a Monday morning, we only waited about 10 minutes for our seat. 

There rustic and casual take on traditional breakfast and comfort food is insanely good. We ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, smoked salmon scramble and blueberry pecan flapjacks. We were visually wowed when our food arrived.

The sage fried chicken and waffles was massively huge, piled high and beautifully presented. It must have been stacked 8-10 inches high and artistically decorated with huge sprigs of rosemary and sage leaves. I didn't know whether to eat it or pray to the food gods. It was truly amazing and the quality was downright excellent and delicious.The chicken was well seasoned, tender, light crisp on the outside and scrumptious. Inside the waffles were infused with bits and pieces of bacon which caught me off guard and happily surprised. Gratifyingly savory while still sweet, they're definitely better than any chicken and waffles I've tasted before. It makes Rosco's chicken and waffles in LA more like a kid's meal. 

For you pancake lovers, their flapjacks are incredibly huge and almost the size of a pizza. Most importantly, it was delicious. They don't skimp on toppings either. Each flapjack was packed and full of blueberries and pecans. Every bite had something in it. 

On a more civilized level, the smoked salmon scramble portions were smaller and regular size compared to the other dishes. Both the brie and pesto provided scrumptious fusion of flavor and texture. Accompanied with potato hash and toast, it was tasty and hearty breakfast.

The food here is crazy good and prices are very reasonable (entree $10-$15). Our server was friendly, attentive and refilled our coffee and water promptly. While their over the top presentation and massive portions can be a bit overwhelming and mammoth, they make sure that taste and quality take center stage as well.

2131264,2012-07-26,11,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Better known as ""the establishment responsible for robbing me of half a day's worth of tourist time.""  

How, you ask? Well...

(Cue dream harp flashback sequence music.)

We started the day off with every intention of being productive. Woke up at a decent enough time (especially considering that we were on vacation mode), and headed to brunch at the Hash House. 

Loved the décor (sleek and modern), and was tickled by their slogan - ""Twisted Farm Food"" (farm fresh food with a 'twist').  After perusing the menu, I knew immediately that I wanted the Fried Chicken & Waffles Tower. How could I not?! I mean, a TOWER of fried goodness! I shot down my hubby's attempt to share an order, determined to take down the tower (and save the princess?) on my own. 

My dish arrived, and I was in foodie heaven. Laced with crispy bacon pieces, these waffles were no ordinary Eggos. And the fried chicken. Oh. My. Goodness. Infused with sage and fried to absolute perfection -- I would have no qualms with eating THESE chicken pieces out of a red and white bucket with my bare hands! Thankfully, we were provided with silverware so this was not necessary. I used my knife and fork to tackle my fried food tower like a civilized person thankyouverymuch.

As could have been predicted, I was defeated by the tower of gluttony. Though undoubtedly delicious - I couldn't eat another bite. In hindsight, I probably should have agreed to split an order. Alas, I had once again become a victim of 'eyes bigger than tummy' syndrome. 

Here's where the details get sketchy. We headed home (or did we go for Boba first?), and somehow made it to one of the bedrooms. We each felt the need to (falsely) assure one another that we were not going to fall asleep. I wanna say we put in a DVD. I wanna say my sister and I were even munching on some Swedish Fish as an attempt to further perpetrate our 'we're totally normal' act. 

I wanna say we succumbed to food coma pretty instantaneously. 

It must have been a pretty sad sight when my mom walked in to find all of us completely unconscious -- my sister and I laid out on the bed (with an, ahem, EMPTY Swedish Fish bag between us), and our respective men sprawled out on the floor (one of them with his belt and pants button undone to accommodate his fullness). 

Oh, and I should mention - this was FIVE hours later. We had taken a FIVE HOUR midday siesta, thanks to our Hash House feast. We were forced to throw in the towel on any plans we originally had for the day, and made a pact to one another that we would not let this happen again.

(Music screeches to a halt.)

Until, that is, we met the 30-inch pizza. Alas, a story for another day...",9cvf2L90hvmzeO2ZzmuXcQ,4,3,5,eVXkHxqyfx7aZQqqduWoSg

Located away from the hordes of the visitors milling about the strip, this place is so popular that there is usually a 45 minute to 60 minute wait just to get seated.   Thankfully there were several of us so many dishes were sampled.  I ended up with the chicken and waffles which were excellent.   The chicken was perfectly fried up, not soggy or greasy.  The waffles were stuffed with bacon of all things!  Genius!  I also got to sample the hand hammered pork cutlet covered in some type of sage cream gravy which was pretty fantastic.  The portions are ludicrous.  I felt like we were in an episode of the Flintstones.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  Most entrees ran about $15 but the quality and portion size made it pretty reasonable.  Not to mention that most buffets on the strip are much pricier with hit or miss quality.

Since I like to take the red eye from Honolulu, I am often on the hunt for a nice breakfast when I land in Vegas. My usual stop is Bouchon, but I thought I would try something different on my most recent trip.

I'm an Eggs Benedict kind of gal, but when I go to a restaurant, I like to try what they're known for, so I opted for the Sage Fried Chicken on the Bacon Waffles. My mom ordered a Crab Cake Benedict, which was a special, so I figured I could steal some bites from her plate.

The presentation of the chicken and waffles is impressive. However, it looks a lot better than it tastes. The chicken was quite bland. And although I tend to like my pancakes and waffles on the dry side,  the syrup container seemed really tiny to me. I considered asking for more, but I felt a little ashamed. :p The idea of bacon in waffles is a good one, but the execution was lacking. I think maybe the waffles were not crispy enough.

My mom's dish was a lot better, and I sort of kicked myself for straying from my usual. The portion sizes for both dishes were gigantic, so if you have a big appetite, this is a great place for you. Service was friendly and efficient. Overall, I'm glad I went once to cross it off my list, but I am not eager to go again.",t0P78kiKPvSQefAOCSF5Ag,6,7,3,medVeS_LGn5wMH6e6Ltr9Q

We told her that we'd heard of ""Hash House"" and the claim to fame for big portions which was not our thing - we'd rather have a little of something really good than a lot of something mediocre.  ""Ah"", she said, ""the food there IS really good.  But be SURE you split an order..""

Since she, like my husband, was from Brooklyn and even grew up in the same neighborhood, he was inclined to take her advice.  (""A girl from the neighborhood can't be wrong"" he said.)  We're' so glad we did because she was right on all counts.   Hash House a Go Go is a great place, the food is really good, and it's wise to split an order!

We stopped for breakfast at about 10:30 on a Wednesday morning.  The place was jumping and  we  had to wait ten minutes for a table. (A good sign at mid week in down economy, we think.)  A few minutes of wait gave us time to look around and we noted how inviting and sparkling clean everything was.  Also from ""meet and seat"" through ""order and eat"" the service was friendly and top notch.  

The breakfast menu had lots of options, both more familiar and highly unique.  We opted for more familiar and split a bacon, avocado, cheese and egg scramble that came with delectable pan fried mashed potatoes, there's a novelty for breakfast, and a perfect buttermilk biscuit. Honest to goodness homemade strawberry jam was on the table...none of that ""individual serving container"" corn syrup laden stuff here!. 

Breakfast was only about $12.00 and fed us both with more than we could eat.  (Well, OK, I probably could have finished off those great mashed potatoes but...)

If Hash House a Go Go were in our town we'd be regular customers for breakfast and lunch and dinner!  In our opinion, although very different experiences for sure, Hash House is tied with Bouchon at the Ventian for the best breakfast in Las Vegas!",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,1,2,4,d6v0eGGq7FB1V1gN_Q-0ZQ

THE GOOD: they were able to accommodate our large party and of course the food.

THE BAD: Our first server Lupe was not only awwwwfullllll, but not welcoming at all!!! Kind of made for an awkward lunch. She had an attitude like no other and made it apparent that she did not want to wait on our party. She made comments and had a tone that really should have been up to the managers attention, it was that bad. However, the members in our large party chose other wise. 

OH, OH!!! LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE NASTY HAIR found IN OUR FOOD!!! Nasty, gross, and unpleasant!!!Our server had the audacity to try to charge us for it!!! 

THE (LUPE) ATTITUDE: 
    We ordered three coffees, four were brought out, we told her there were only three ordered and her response was,  ""there were two orders of one decaf and one regular,"" so we apologized any way and said we only needed three, at which she repeated that we had ordered two and two. Oh my gosh was she adamant until she realized we were NOT going to take the extra coffee so she threw in 
""There were two orders, but I'll take it back.""
    When we tried to double check our order to make sure we didn't have a coffee incident again she replied, ( in a tone a teenager would use with their parents) ""Yeah. I got it.""
    She finally brought out our food and we hadn't even started to eat before she had brought out the tabs! Not ONCE did she bother to come and check on us. Coffee cups went empty without a fill and so did our water cups.

    After all was said and done, we noticed there was a name Jess on our bill. It turns out that the unpleasant LUPE was helping out Jess, but no one seemed to inform us before hand. It was unfortunate that LUPE could altar our dining experience because my family and I were hoping to add this place as a dining spot to our yearly Vegas family trip.

MY ADVICE...DON'T GO IF YOU'RE IN A LARGE PARTY & if LUPE is your server, request some one else!!! It might make a difference in your dining experience!!!",lO9HjUVGeWaWYBJ02q7Svw,0,0,2,I5Sy4Qiz1AmndvVrk_vucg

Best Bloody Marys on the strip! Seriously. They're a drunken meal in itself. The BLT bloody mary was incredible.

The Sage Fried chicken was amazing.

We got one of the Farm Benedict entrees. The individual items on the plate were really good, but the way they poured/drenched the plate with hollandaise sauce was a bit nauseating. We'll def order the sauce on the side next time.

Our server was one of the best we'd  had all weekend! She was on top of it like no other and seriously made our morning.


CONS
The hostess had her head up her a**. She was rude and lazy. The restaurant was mostly empty and yet somehow she couldn't bother to find us a table. She just glanced behind her into the dining area and made us wait for another 15 minutes. 
Eventually what looked to be the the manager offered to seat us. But then on his way over he literally stopped to chit chat & shoot the sh*t with another staff member right in front of us. THEN he moseyed on over to come seat us.

All in all...

The Imperial Palace isn't the prettiest hotel to walk through to get to breakfast & the hostess sucks, but if you love a good bloody mary it might be well worth it. 

Extra tip: Consider sharing a plate if you're not a giant eater. lol It's really tempting to want to try as much as you can, but it might be worth it to split one good plate & save a few bucks.",Yhi7Qqm8zSR_nxN6OXJ79A,0,0,3,vJhoTKkjkbruebQJNV11Wg

2156044,2011-02-16,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I didn't realize this restaurant had been featured on tv when I first visited; a friend from San Diego suggested I try one of the LV locations of his favorite SD hangout when I said I'd be here for a trade show. I'm sure glad I followed through on that suggestion! I had a wonderful dining experience. Excellent service, excellent food, excellent prices. I will definitely go back to any HH location, and recommend any of them without hesitation, just as my friend did.

The morning I visited, the restaurant was quite busy, but the amazing hostess quickly got us seated in a nice booth, and our coffee was brought out promptly. I instantly fell in love with the fun and funky ambiance and the quirky, tatted waitstaff. Our waitress was as fantastic as her tattoos. She was fun, friendly, and so on top of it that we were the ones that had to ask her to wait - we needed some extra time to absorb the incredible menu. 

I had a very difficult time deciding, so since my friend had suggested the Sage Fried Chicken Egg Benedict ($15), that's what ended up ordering. I had been warned the portions were big, but until you see it with your own eyes, you cannot believe how gargantuan they truly are. A massive tower of sage fried chicken with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, grilled mozzarella, chipotle cream and eggs was deposited in front of me, and I actually gasped out loud, to the amusement of my waitress. Though I instantly realized there was no way I was going to be able to consume all of this feast and still have a functioning heartbeat, I happily gave it a try. 

It was an incredible breakfast. Every delicious ingredient tasted farm fresh, hand-prepared, and it was all perfectly cooked and seasoned. And it all tasted ... original! And different! And good! You can tell they make everything from scratch, because it tastes like it. Heck they even have house-made jam on the table... how awesome is that..??

My dining companion had the Meatloaf Hash, which was a huge portion of amazing hash adorned with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, smoked mozzarella, and 2 perfectly cooked eggs. Rounding out this monster breakfast was a side of crispy potatoes, fruit and biscuit ($13).  Everything on this plate was also exceptionally flavorful and cooked very well.

I've been to other restaurants famous for large portions, but their food always tastes like ""chain"" food, and you can never count on the service because of how busy the restaurant is. Not so with Hash House. These breakfasts are obviously individually prepared with great care and attention to detail, freshness and flavor, and they're served with pride and panache by a very well-trained staff. Every aspect of my breakfast, from the first cup of coffee to the last bite of fruit, was wonderful. I cannot think of one single aspect I would change about this restaurant, the staff, or the food. It was absolutely perfect.

While a person couldn't (and shouldn't) eat a big breakfast or lunch like this all the time, occasionally enjoying one this tasty is a nice treat, especially if you're from out of town. So just like my friend urged me, I urge you to visit any Hash House location and give it a try. I'm sure you'll find, as I did, that you'll be very happy with the service, the prices, and most importantly, the wonderful food.

sage fried chicken benedict. i was eyeing so many items on the menu, but this was my final decision since it said man v food favorite next to it. it was delicious, and i definitely took at least half of it home. the chicken was crispy and delicious. the sauce on top is really good. i don't know what it was. the mashed potatoes are really good, and the biscuit is very fluffy. as soon as the waitress plopped it in front of me, i knew i couldn't possibly finish it. i had the leftovers later, and it was still good!

bacon waffles. i actually really really really enjoyed this. maybe more than the sage fried chicken benedict. only because it's simple: savory and sweet.

YIKES

Our group of 8 decided to stop by for an early b'fast before hitting the road and driving back to LA where we were to catch an evening flight. I mean, really, we left an 8 hour buffer for a typically 4 hour drive...but alas, it took us 8.5 hours to get to LAX and we missed our flight.

Because we got there at 8.50a, there was barely a line. In fact, the restaurant was only half filled. Phew. 

I was excited to be here since Hash House  has been ALL Over Food Network and my foodie friend liked the Fried Chicken and Waffles (which was kinda a theme for me this weekend)

So i ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles
- Fried Chicken- Breast meat only. I was 'assured' by my friend that it was brined and so it should be juicy. 
NOT. 
The chicken was dry and the skin was tasteless and soggy. It was hard to compare it with Roscoe's, which I happened to have just tasted the day before. 
- Waffles- The waffle was WAY too cakey and doughy. It Looked like a waffle but tasted like a fruitcake stuffed with bacon and drenched with some sweet nastiness and bits of fruits. Seriously. Each Large  'quarter' of waffle was stuffed with a strip of bacon, which i normally would have loved...but it didn't add anything to the waffle/ fruitcake.

It was only after I made a formal complaint to the manager that they took off this charge.  The manager, Lupe, was a nice lady but give me a break.

There is a very vast and creative drink selection for coffees and non-alcoholic thirst quenchers. I was slightly disappointed with the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Even though 95% of society loves bacon and are under the impression it makes everything better, I thought having the bacon INSIDE the waffles was superfluous and totally took away some key factors that makes bacon so great. The waffle iron must be what made the bacon rubbery and tasteless, which in turn, kinda ruined the waffle, which was chewy and meh. Other dishes I have had were filling and hit the spot, but weren't really anything to write home about.

Two plump, juicy, flavorful chicken breast fried golden brown were served over 4 Belgian waffles and topped with fried leeks with a maple reduction and spicy chili oil with diced bell peppers. Simply amazing. All of the flavors worked really well together and the portion was more than enough for 2 adults (we could have actually shared the waffles with our 3 year old. We got him a kids lil tractor breakfast: One giant pancake, scrambled eggs, and a slice of bacon. He ate 1/2 of the pancake and the bacon. So the only thing that we didn't love was the price. They kind of gauge you on the drinks and the kids meal prices -- which aren't exactly comparable to  other restaurants. I totally understand, ""you get what you pay for,"" and don't get me wrong, the food was great. But a $40+ bill after tip for one adult meal, one kid meal, and 2 coffees is kind of a bit much. It cheapened the experience. Oh, and even though it doesn't state it on the menu, the waitress said there was a $3 split charge. She  tells us if we order something else that they can count it as a meal and waive the split -- I know, it didn't make sense to me either. So we order a side of scrambled eggs al a carte -- which we didn't eat -- and never got the plate split. I kind of felt tricked into spending a whole $3 more.

I had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. All of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. Okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.

I was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. The original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the andy's sage fried chicken benedict and a chorizo hash. Mind you, two very gargantuan orders. What a good sport, I almost kind of felt bad. Almost. 

Everyone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. We really enjoyed the sage fried chicken and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food. 

Side note, the fried chicken in and of itself was a bit dry. Luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. LOL. 

My friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. No one else bothered with drinks.

2206247,2010-09-09,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This is a review for breakfast.

The Skinny: extreme portion sizes but hit-or-miss execution (3) service: not bad however we usually get there when it opens to beat the rush (3) value: pricing is a little pricy however you will for sure have leftovers unless you order 1 entree/2 people (3).

We come here for breakfast whenever we feel like a) we can get here early enough to beat the rush, b) we have to take the car in for service, c) we feel like pigging out in the morning.

By far, the best dish here is Andy's Fried Chicken Eggs Benny. It sounds kinda gross - fried chicken, bacon, mashed potatoes, biscuit and gravy - but it's kind of a guilty pleasure. It's a total heart attack on a plate but very flavourful - sweet, crunchy, buttery goodness.

Their biscuits are great with their homemade strawberry jam. Delish.

Now for the bad news.

The pancakes here aren't bad either however their batter lacks the mild crispiness likely due to their size. Blueberry pecan is better than Blackberry granola in IMHO. 

French toast is okay but a little too sweet.

Their chicken 'n waffles were not that good - the waffles were too saturated in syrup and were soggy. The chicken was fine though.

You need to bring a crew with you when you come here to eat because of the large portion sizes. I would suggest ordering maybe 1 entree per 2 people and then order the minimum amount for the second (such as a biscuit with butter). Seriously - one entree will keep you nibbling for at least 2 days.

Didn't happen. 

I went there for breakfast with a colleague. We were seated side-by-side facing a giant TV set playing Food TV scenes I had seen already. I ordered a ham-spinach-and-cheese scramble with crispy fried potatoes.

The scramble was mediocre, the ""crispy"" potatoes had a hard shell, and the biscuit was dry and had some kind of herb sprig incongruously shoved in it.

It wasn't bad, really, it just wasn't very good. The biggest disappointment was the next day, when I was short on time and grabbed myself a McDonald's biscuit sandwich. The McDonald's biscuit was moist, fluffy and tasty -- more so than the one I had had for a higher price the day before.

The prices look high until you see the portions. Seriously, my plate was at least two feet across! If you can eat so much that you can't make two good meals out of your leftovers, I'm impressed. So realistically, as long as you aren't too haughty to hungrily dive into yesterday's remainders, you're getting a good value.  

The service was good though the atmosphere was mediocre. I admit, it felt a little Cheesecake Factory to me, but I'm willing to overlook it.

4 of us went and each got something different. Someone got the pancakes which was the size of a large hubcap. I got the chicken and waffles which featured two chicken breast on top of FOUR bacon stuffed waffles (I know, crazy!). We also had a skillet dish that used a real skillet not a mini or skinny skillet. And finally meatloaf which could have a fed a family of four for days.

As far as taste this place had quality to go with the quantity. The drinks were equally good and generous.

Service was great and very friendly.

We were given menus to look over, after 10minutes I asked a waiter walking by if she could send someone to take our drink orders. She apologized and said someone would be right over. So then the waiter came and we placed our drink and food order. Both came out promptly. I ordered the chicken and waffle dish which if you like bacon is pretty good.

Immediately, my expectations were high thanks to Man v. Perhaps too high. After arriving with a party of 7, me and the crew realized that we should have sat separately as it took nearly 15 minutes for someone to happen by and take our drink order. One of the members of our group was unsure of his order so we asked the server to take the rest of them and put them in. She took the orders and never placed them instead she waited another 15 minutes and finally took my friends order and placed it with ours. After the third trip to the table it was impossible to find he again. We confronted the manager and he said he would take care of it. Which apparently meant she was going to complain to us about our issues with her services. She finally came back to the table and said ""So, you told my manager your not happy with my services?"" awkward...and yes that is what she said. No apology, no attempt to make it better, no refills and the service got worse. Service is a BIG part of going out for me. The food can be terrible but if the service is great I just may go back.

The initial service when we went to put our name with the hostess was barely worth 2 stars. They were pretty busy so granted the girl may have been stressed but nonetheless she was rude, short & frankly put a sour taste in my mouth. Not a very good first impression. We were told it would be 45 min because we were a larger party bit we only ended up waiting around 25 so we were quite pleased. 

Our server introduced himself to us fairly quickly and took our drink order.  As for the service overall, he did a good job in flipping our annoyance into a good time. He was attentive, informative and friendly. 

Our food came out quickly as well. All I can say is once we saw the food, we understood the meaning of ""huge"" portions. The food looked like artistic work, we didn't even know where to start on some dishes. 

The Benedics are overly large, but we found that it was all really just a bunch of carbs layering the whole bottom. Most of the good stuff was on the top And the sauce didn't even go to the bottom so needless to say we didn't really eat it.

It's huge portion for the average price restaurant with food that will surely get you on the obese side fairly quickly.  My family and I went here because of the Yelp review, but I guess some reviews are not really helpful.  We ordered two dishes to share to see how good it is, but it was terrible.  The ""scramble eggs"" are pre-made; yellow and dry and on the cold side for scramble eggs.  The scramble eggs with salmon was scramble, but they added the cold salmon and didn't really cook it anymore serving it on the cold side.  Also the salmon smells really ""fresh"".  You can smell the fish smell and it was really bad; cold salmon.  Not to mentioned their ""abundant mix fruits"" came only with 3 small slices of pineapple and 2 tiny pieces of oranges.  Serious now.  Most of the dishes you can tell are pre-made, hence you will get your dishes fairly quick.  I did mentioned to the waitress about the disappointment and she did offer to make a new one, but I just wanted to finish and move on.  One thing I don't trust is complaining to your server and mechanic and have the same people who originally jacked up their service to try and redo the same service.  You might get a surprise flavor in your scramble eggs or a loose bolt in your engine.  I rather just Yelp about it and eat somewhere else.  If you think about eating here, just go to a Dennys, unless you're weight challenge, you can get full here.",0D4BFNsySx-R9fwK_QuNVA,0,0,1,aigAw58UYDfkr1NgEH0hYw

I was tested. The food sweats were real. This dish was the worst best thing that has ever happened to me. Did I feel like a quitter? Maybe.

I was surprised by the portion because their hella huge. Its like a meal for two. I am a big fan of chicken and waffle breakfast but I was not impressed with theirs. First the waffle was soggy so I asked for the waffle to be crispy. When it came back to me, it still wasn't crispy but the server said that's their crispy. I asked for it to be almost burned. I waited patience and started eating my chicken. It was actually good. But reminded me of southern style chicken. I don't care much for it. When the waffle came back, it still was not crispy. So I just gave up on it. 

I think my husband had the andy's sage fried chicken. It a bunch of stuff on a place. I don't even know where to explain. For me it was ALRIGHT. I would eat it but it was just too much to finish. On the other hand, my husband (who is a chef) did not care for it at all. So that was a total fail.

Wasn't very hungry so I knew eating here would be difficult. Decided to go with something light, like a house salad. 

The cucumber dressing is a little weird, and I still prefer ranch. Way too large of a salad, I could only eat half. Delicious salad though. Second, don't you think its a little weird that the salad comes with a biscuit? Well, luckily I asked for a side of gravy and made myself biscuit and gravy. Did not like the gravy what so ever. Way to thick and too salty for my liking, I'm not a huge sausage lover, I just like the flavor in huge sauce not big, two inch pieces. I guess I'm a biscuit and gravy snob.

Tried a few bites if my husband stuffed burger and holy burger was it tasty. Double patty filled with cheddar cheese,avacado and bacon. Perfect combo.

We started off with humongous biscuits. They were the size of my fist! The biscuit was pretty good; it wasn't dry. The honey and butter gave it some better flavor. We also asked if there were any fruit jams available from breakfast. There was strawberry jam in the fridge and it was very fresh tasting. Yum!

Everyone practically ordered from the breakfast menu. Who wouldn't want breakfast for dinner? We had the following dishes:

+ Pacers Hash ($12.95) - The potatoes were crispy and the pork as moist. Fresh corn, green beans, asparagus, scrambled eggs, and fruit also came with the dish. One small gripe was the cheese that covered the dish was a bit too heavy for me. Otherwise, great flavors!

+ Boston Hash ($14.95) - The crab cake was pretty good, and the horseradish cream was not overpowering. The tomatoes in the hash made the potatoes a little soggy though. Dish came with asparagus, fruit, and scrambled eggs. 

+ Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict ($14.95) - Wow! This dish was awesome! The pork was so moist. I couldn't believe the size of the pork. The creamy sauce was yummy too. Also comes with a biscuit at the bottom.

+ Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich ($12.95) - I didn't get to try the sandwich, but I heard that it wasn't bad. 

Split charge is $2.50 per person. 

I would definitely come back again and try breakfast during the morning/lunch time. The food is very fresh since the restaurant doesn't own any freezers. 

You can also visit the Hash House in San Diego. Our waiter told us that there would be another Hash House on the strip in the near future. Yay!

HUGE portions.  HUGE.  Two people can split a meal and be full, trust me.  I literally touched half of my meal (Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with bacon, eggs, and a biscuit) and was full beyond belief.

This place is spot on with their presentation.  Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade garnished with a slice of watermelon.  Burgers topped off with a stick of tarragon to keep the burger together instead of a toothpick.  Lots of fancy food decor.  The meals here look so appealing and appetizing.

Pancakes are HUGE.  Burgers are HUGE.  Everything is in super large portions so make sure to come hungry and leave full.  You really get your money's worth.

Hash House is located about 20-30mins away from the strip.  You have ample parking.  I recommend going early because it gets busy but do not fear cause the lines go down pretty fast.  The ambience of the restaurant is very breathtaking.  Once you head inside the atmosphere changes to a farm like feel.  Many famous people walked through those doors as pictures of them bombard you at the front of the door.

I recommend getting anything on the menu.  Don't hesitate to choose because everything of the menu is to die for.

Her soup was served in a very small bowl that looked about the size of a small measuring cup. It was packed with mushrooms and no visable other vegetables. She didn't enjoy it and didn't finish it. I had the double meat mashed potato burger with bacon. The bun was huge and looked great but was too hard to even bite into. I had to take the meat off the bun and use a fork. The meat and potatoes worked week and tasted good but all in all I was let down because when you want a burger u want the whole thing and not without the bun.

I appreciated the gesture and accepted, but he failed to tell me it would cost $4.50 to add on the gravy. When we went to pay I was annoyed to see I had been charged for the gravy when the server didn't mention it was an additional charge at the time he offered it to me. I spoke to the manager on the way out to say that while our service good, I would have appreciated if the server had told me I would have to pay more for the gravy.

Giant portions. Crazy food presentation (I dare you check out the pot pie!). Fairly reasonable cost considering the gigantic portions. They make one helluva strong Bloody Mary too! 

The one thing of note for me was the fact that the ingredients were SUPER fresh, and rivaled anything fresh I could get here in California. You could tell the eggs were farm fresh. The meats were tasty and not full of preservatives, and the veggies were full of flavor.

Must I warn you that this dish can fill up two people? Even then, we couldn't finish it, yet we were STUFFED till maybe for another week or so!

The dish was very very similar to the one in SD, but not quite! I like it but I could tell there was something different about it. Instead of bacon bitz, they placed the whole bacon with it, which didn't taste so good. The grilled mozzarella and fried chicken were both delicious! I'm not sure what else to it but overall, it was good! With that said, it was nice to have Hash House again though! Great place for breakfast when you're in Vegas!

If you are a big eater, this place is for you. The meals are big enough for two people to share -if you can both decide on just one dish. That is where my wife and I have trouble, since I like spicy food and she doesn't. 

I opted for the chorizo house hash with over-medium eggs. The food arrived in a large skillet filled with potatoes, chorizo, cheese, tomatoes, and onions. It also came with fruit on the side and a huge biscuit. I did my best to try and finish it, but failed. My coworker ordered the pork sandwich with fries (18 ounces of meat) - and barely put a dent in it. 

The menu has a lot of different options that sound really good. I also got a chance to see their chicken and waffles dish--that looked amazing. Next time! 
Our service was good. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, and kept our drinks filled.

 Inside, it kind of has a warehouse feel to it. Therefore, it was pretty loud in the restaurant during lunch time. I am a fan of this place, and look forward to trying something different next time.",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,0,0,4,keuLlMEnQq-QyuQBC_EtkA

Today was my first trip. I ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit. The biscuit was decent, the eggs were pretty standard, the potatoes were ok, and the chicken was absolutely mind-blowing. If you like fried chicken, your only complaint might be that it was a boneless breast, but otherwise it was amazing. There was also a lot of fluff on the plate - a big watermelon wedge, an unripe strawberry, and some thin crunchy straw-like things that really did nothing but get in the way.

2477793,2012-09-11,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"So, consider this My Big Fat First Official Las Vegas Yelp Review since moving here to Sin City.  My partner, Bear, strongly recommended this place after having lunch here with his cousin, who's a 'local'.  And I can see why...HHAGG takes their ""twisted farm-fresh"" sensibility really seriously, all the way down to the rust-covered ""Green Acres""-era tractor perched out front near the parking lot. 

But all else you could notice about the place - even the Wall of Fame at the entrance, that contains the autographed photos of dozens of celebrity past-diners - falls away once the food takes front-and-center stage.  It is no surprise that MAN VS. FOOD's Adam Richman considers this one of his all-time favorite places to eat.  The portions are HUGE.  And I mean so big, even ravenous farmhands just in from a full day in the fields might have to step off a bit. 

Our friendly, animated waiter warned us away from having individual side orders of fries with our sandwiches, having us opt instead to share just one order between us. WISE call.  The Stuffed One-Pound Burger that I had (with the incredible applewood- smoked bacon and melted cheddar), was cooked to perfection, but more like a TWO-pounder than just a single.  And I was HUNGRY.  If you are gorge-a-phobic, I would strongly suggest that you bring a friend, order one entree and split it.  Uhh, actually, you might even want to make it a couple of friends....

The amazing thing here, though, is that the food doesn't sacrifice the quality for the quantity, which is nothing short of amazing. I do plan on coming back and trying more of the scrumptious-looking items on the menu...just probably not until Thanksgiving!",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,4,2,5,csnYDC9z0lewRN4arr1cBg

We got seated and ordered their specials. I had the Michigan special which was chicken sausage with mixed vegetables and 2 eggs. My friend got the pumpkin-peanut butter flapjack. I also ordered their special cherry lime soda. 

I got my soda and it was just okay...it was refreshing, but not worth the money as it just felt like syrup added to it. I thought it be made with bits of lime or cherry or something. 

The food finally arrived and it was just ok. My Michigan special was healthy looking, but there was nothing special about it. It was like a fajita with a 2 egg on the side. The flapjack tasted more like pumpkin and not much peanut butter. It was flapjack that covered the whole plate. 

The best thing was their home made peach marmilade on the table with their homemade biscuit.  The marmilade was just so great with chucks of peach in it.  I wished they sold it because it was that good.

This is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. The others are within hotels/casinos.  The wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. Our waitress, Erin, had a very flat affect straight from the start. She wasn't very friendly nor helpful.  I asked her if the couples could split the bill and she said it would be fine. We ordered our entrees, which consisted of the sun dried tomatoes, basil and goat cheese farm scrambles, buttermilk flapjacks and the French toast. All were very tasty and had good portions. One of the downfalls to the food was the amount of syrup they gave with the French toast and flapjacks. They gave a tiny shot glass worth of syrup for each dish. We had to ask for extra syrup about 3 times because these dishes needed the syrup. So when the bill comes, it had not been split, so I quickly reminded her to split the bill. I was going to mention which dishes on the credit cards but she replied ""I know what dishes you guys got"" in a very rude tone. Yeeesh. She looked at my boyfriend and asked which card was his. He told her his name. The other couple's card had his picture on it. So when she returns with the split bills, she still managed to screw everything up and mix up the items with the cards. At this point, I was quite frustrated so I went back to look for her and just told her what had happened. She apologized but it honestly didn't seem like she cared.  We wanted to leave so we just signed the bills without changing them and left. 

This experience left a sour taste in my mouth. The service at the other hash houses are pretty good. Not sure if I want to go to this location again.",SXHSpz3DsAteY0zI8MJnyQ,0,0,2,xz3LnAFUKPIEkGSqa-yq3g

If you're dumbfounded why the average cud chewing American women weighs 160lb (men probably put this number to shame), you can thank Hash House a Go Go because this place is all about SIZE. So if you're a size queen, then you'll want to get your big ole' booty down to the Hash House.... oh, and don't expect a Vegas style lounge with ""go go dancers"". It's just a breakfast joint with feed sack sized portions.

I prematurely ordered the chicken and eggs, and I should have read ""Karen Y's"" freak'n review cuz she got it right about the chicken being dry which brought out my ""O"" face! ""Ooooh, wtf! Why did I order the chicken because I can't stand dry overcooked chicken! The chicken was so dry I would have gladly taken some supermarket fried chicken over it any day. Even the side of chipotle sauce couldn't save this overcooked bird.

My other biggest pet peeve is to plate food with huge chunks of herbs if it's not intended to be eaten. Hash House is one of these perverse offenders because they serve up their dishes with a big ole' sprig of sage. Isn't that classy.

This place isn't just a total hog farm cuz even though the interior is awkwardly designed with angled steel/diamond plated elements blended with antique looking wood pieces, they do have some decent mashed potatoes and the bacon was decent.

Moderate prices but you get awesome presentation, quality, and portions.

I got the fabled Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles.  I really enjoyed this dish on every level.  The maple reduction was nice in that you got some sweetness in the dish but the waffles were still able to stay crispy by not being drenched in it.  In addition, the waffles are stuffed with bacon, how can you go wrong with that?!?!  The sage fried chicken had a crispy crust but was moist and tender inside and had very little fat and the fried leeks rounded out the dish nicely.

My wife had one of the scrambles with egg whites avocado and bacon and it was nice to see that a place that is known for unique dishes can execute something simple just as well.  The avocado was fresh and the bacon seemed to be at that perfect in-between state in that it was crispy yet had some chewy texture; not overly well-done that it looks burnt or under cooked and gummy.  The biscuit had a nice crumbly outer texture and the inside was fluffy and moist.

My wife wanted to order hash, which is why we went to HASH House a Go-Go, as hash is traditionally served with poached eggs, and they only serve it with scrambled eggs with dinner. WHAAAA? So it's okay to have poached eggs for breakfast but not for dinner.  Hmmph. 

I had the chicken and biscuits. The gravy was schmeh. Yep, just schmeh. The chicken was tougher than a boiled owl. The asparegus was so tough that I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. The only good thing about the meal were the biscuits. They were very good.

They get rave reviews and tons of publicity on TV, newspapers and weeklies.  I don't have a probelm with a place that tries hard and sucks.  What I do have is a problem with places who act entitled and that long waits for seating, ambivalent service, longer waits for food, and bland meals are ok, because HEY, we're on Man vs. Food.  We were picked best of Las Vegas.  Well, news flash.  You guys have gone down hill.  Your food has become Meh, your customer service (remember us?  your customers?  The reason you have a restaurant?)  sucks.  I went in on Sunday to take my mom and girlfriend to brunch.  We were told an hour wait.  No biggie.  We'll go elsewhere.  Went back Mon at noon with my girl and an old friend.  Our waiter could have given two craps, which is fine, it'll just reflect in the tip.  We then sat and sat and sat waiting on our food.  My girlfriend asked the waiter what the deal was and he lamely stated my pancake was the problem.  As in it took an hour to cook a pancake.  I asked him what the deal was and he meekly stated it will be out soon.  Awesome.  I got the hostess to get a manager who came out and although very nice told me he had a shortage in the kitchen and was doing all he could including helping prep the food himself.  I sympathize bud, but when you've made people wait 1 hour and 17 minutes (no lie ) for lunch, the least you can do is take drinks off the tab or apologize.  This place is now part of Vegas.  In the bad way.  It has picked up the pretentious attitude of so many counterparts and almost says, ""hey you need us more than we need you.""  I for one will resume going to the Original Pancake House and the ever awesome Bagel Cafe, who have not let success get to their head.  Oh, and I almost forgot about the food, you know why WE went there.  My girlfriend would rather have gone to Capriottis and my buddy In N Out.

My friends and I came here for breakfast after a long drive from the Bay Area. We knew we needed a big breakfast to give us some energy for the day and for EDC.

We arrived around 9:45am or so and was promptly seated. The place was already super packed. As we walked by the tables, I took a peek at what other people were eating and wow. I don't know how people can finish an entire portion. (Maybe this is why America is so fat...although...the food was bomb).

My girlfriend and I shared the signature sage chicken and waffles ($18). If you look at the pictures, you can see that the plate comes with two large pieces of fried chicken, 4-6 pieces of bacon infused waffles and a lot of onions and sage. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted really good. The chicken was soft and tender on the inside and the Bacon/Waffle combination was amazing. Forreal though, it was more than enough food for 2 people. One of my friends, did however, finished his entire meal...

Our server was amazing. He kept coming back to check up on us and made sure we were good. He encouraged me to eat my greens as well!!

Also my brother had a small complaint about his cocktail not being strong enough and she immediately grabbed it and had the bar tender make it a little bit stronger with no questions asked! it was great how easily she took care of it. Thanks Merisa! 
So on to the food, I got a hash with mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and artichokes. To be honest it was a bit bland until I poured the yolk from my eggs on it. Then it was perfect! the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. My brother got French toast which came with caramelized bananas on top. He absolutely loved them!

The portions are ginormous and the presentation is pretty extraordinary too. I don't generally like for my food items to be all loved up to each other like they serve it up here but at Hash House, it works. Everything on the plate is served as though it is one item, if that makes any sense. All I know is, this is some delicious grub. 

Andy's sage fried chicken is so warm, juicy and sage-y. So good. But it's hard to make a decision because the smoked salmon benedict is incredible as well. They offer quesadillas with a sriracha garnish that is a favorite of mine too. I have tried most of the menu items at one time or another and the only thing I would not order again is the pot pie. I didn't like the cracker crust. Just a personal preference. Hash House is not a one trick pony either. The lunch and dinner menus have some great dishes. I haven't sampled as many items as I have on the breakfast menu but I definitely recommend the crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich. The wheat bun and chili mayo really make this sandwich sing. Love it. 

Besides the pot pie, I also don't like the split plate charge. IMHO it is inappropriate to charge more money for the exact same amount of food just because more people are going to be eating it. I rolled in with a group of four that selected three entrees to share, which would have been more than enough food to feed five people, only to be told that there was something like a $3.00 split plate charge. I'm not sure of the exact amount. And while three bucks isn't that big of deal it still seems unnecessary.

Little did we know the entire city of Vegas had the same idea. We went on Sunday at noon. There was an hour wait for a table of five. I was fine with the wait since that probably meant the place was good. 

We put our names on the list and went next door to Vamp'd for a drink while we waited. I recommend doing this if the wait is more than an hour. Vamp'd is a rocker bar. Lots of rock memorabilia on the walls, guitars, chopper behind the bar, and a coffin telephone booth (kind of cool, but creepy when you get in it). Very cool place to check out. And it made our wait go by fast. Hash House tells you their pagers sometimes don't work next door, but we didn't have a problem. Our table was ready, but they wouldn't seat us without our entire party. Two of us stayed at Vamp'd to pay our bill, which took 5 minutes. Good thing it didn't take longer because they were ready to give up our table.  Just be ready when your pager goes off!!! 

We sat down and it took a few minutes for our waiter to come over. Once he did, he was very helpful. I thought the ambiance was great. Everything that passed our table looked delicious! It was a tough decision on what to get. I ordered the roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary House Hash. Our food took about a half hour. When my food came out barely warm, slightly cold I was a little disappointed. The Manager on duty came over and gladly had the cook make me a new dish. Mine was good, the chicken was a little dry. Could have used some sauce. There is A LOT OF FOOD for one person to eat. I highly recommend sharing a meal if your not a big eater. Or get a to-go box and give it to a bum. 

I would definitely go back. I think they have a lot of creative dishes. I will order something different next time. Everyone else liked their meal.

It might have saved us a bit more time.  After we ordered their popular dishes (chicken and waffles, sage fried chicken), the waitress told us that it'll take another 30-40 mins for our food to arrive, since everything is made from scratch. Not really sure if this applies to all guests or just larger groups. We were getting hungrier by the minute waiting and watching all the dishes pass by. 

The service was spot on, our waitress was delightful, and the food we ordered surpassed my taste buds/appetites expectations. 

The dishes are big enough to be shared, but they'll charge a small fee for sharing, unless you order a side with that meal. It's been a few months since I ate there, so double check the menu or ask about that. I thought this place was a lot tastier than Bouchon at Palazzo.

Portions are so huge, it's ridiculous. There's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. Even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. I was drawn here because of Man V. Food, and ended up ordering the dish that Adam made famous: it's advertised as a ""farm benedict,"" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of mashed potatoes? In addition to sage fried chicken, fresh spinach, smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? This thing isn't a benedict, it's a HOUSE! A very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. I have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. My wife ordered the riddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. Like I said, this place thrives on excess! The french toast was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. It all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. Again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. Because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later. 

You've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called O'Hare Of The Dog: a 24 oz Budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.

Classy? Nope. But fun? Absolutely. 

No matter how hungry you are, you will leave Hash House A Go Go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life.

Everyone at the restaurant was courteous and friendly however the food would have to be rated as just your average run of the mill breakfast.

My crab cakes were good, eggs poached to just the right consistency however the spicy sauce and potatoes were lackluster.  

The same goes for the corned beef hash, it's unique in that they use pulled beef. However we were a little disappointed with the flavors of the dish as a whole.

The star were the kids waffles and pancakes, although they were the simplest dishes our kids loved them.  Can't beat simplicity for breakfast when dining with kids.

We waited 20 minutes to be sat, as it was busy. No problem, I don't mind a wait. We were sat pleasantly enoughh, but that's it as far as the positives. 

Our server was overwhelmed, and we weren't even acknowledged for quite some time. When we were finally acknowledged, the server looked completely frazled.

One or two small items, no problem, but everything going poorly? Not good.

I ordered the chicken and asparagus hash with eggs, and my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles. We didn't receive our food for at least 30 minutes, and when it came out, only mine came. The server said: ""We're going to start you with the chicken and asparagus hash,"" like it was an appetizer or something. Funny.

After at least five minutes and my girlfriend's food having not arrived, I tried to find our waiter, but he was nowhere to be found. I flagged down another waiter and asked to see a manager. He arrived a couple minutes later and I asked him where my girlfriend's order might be, and he assured me it would be right out. Several minutes later, my girlfriend's fried chicken and waffles arrived.

The food: The coating was delicious, as was the maple syrup reduction. The chicken was very, very dry, however, and the waffles were soggy. My dish lacked seasoning and was actually quite bland. I also asked for it to come with mozarella, and they forgot that.

Since then, I've returned at least 2x a month.  Not greasy or gross at ALL!  The food is ""farm fusion"" which basically means they take midwest type food and put a spin on it.

Perfection I tell you!  Complicated dishes that melt in your mouth.

I have tried many of their items, but my favorite is their Sage Chicken and Waffles. We also love their Biscuits and Gravy dish, served on the most wonderful mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life.  We also love the pancakes and the Banana French Toast.

The hostess didn't come off as very friendly when they greeted us.  I didn't get a sense of friendly welcome.  We were told it would be about 10 minutes, and the entire front section were all empty tables (10 tables).  

I figured out after we were sitted that that section just opened up during the time we were dining, so that's why we had to wait.

and their waiters were very nice, friendly and they were always filling our water up.  It was one of the best ice cold water we had.  The coffee was very good too, and they were always refilling that too.

Everything is made to order and served when it's done.  I ordered the corn beef with crispy potates and sunny side up eggs.  It was a large portion and served with fresh slice cantaloup and pineapple which was very good.  The corn beef were shreded and mixed with cheese over crispy potatoes.  It was A+, the only thing I would have liked was that the potatoes could be cut a little smaller, otherwise it would be perfect for me.  The biscuit was large and flaky and I spread their fresh homemade strawberry jam on it.  

My dining partner ordered the vanilla waffle...................it was about 12"" x 12"" and was very good.  I make waffles at home and I thought mine were the best, but this is right there too.

The portions are large and everything is freshly made to order and it's one of the best breakfasts to go to.     

We went on a weekday around 9am, so it was too crowded, but the place was full by 10am.

I would recommend this restaurant.",-c6MDvObtCSXBaWP9vO4DA,0,0,4,aQ-BWNZBkc8lbPEEejU4PA

However, I recently had mouth surgery and asked the hostess if it was okay if I ordered from the kid's menu since I couldn't really eat much and didn't want to waste food. 

She said no problem and gave me the menu. I ordered my food from the waiter and again, no problem. Then, moments later, I was told I could not order from the kid's menu and that I need to pay full price. It was as if I was trying to cheat the system - clearly not - I've never ordered from a kid's menu in my life... not even when I was a kid! 

I felt like I was going through an interrogation as I was pushing the issue from ordering from the kid's menu. (""Who told you it was okay?"" ""What did they look like?"" ""Can you point them out?"") 

I could have easily said 'fine' and just ordered from the normal menu, but it was the principle. A few minutes later the hostess came over and profusely apologized as if she got reprimanded and told me that ""just this one time it was okay."" I said the as fine as I don't plan to have routine mouth surgery and them dine out - but it was Easter so I met my family on my lunch from work.

I have to tell you that I am NOT a fan a breakfast. I do eat it though and it's ok. I have never been wowed by breakfast. Let me just tell you that since visiting the Hash House, I have eaten those words. I have never been to a breakfast place where EVERYTHING (and I do mean everything) was delicious.

First let start off with the decor. This is a very nice place. Got a kinda old country/modern type feel. They have an outside patio in the front and also in the rear. The bathrooms are clean and quaint. 

Enough of that, on to the grub. I ordered the pancake tractor breakfast with a rudy red mimosa. My hubby ordered the corned beef hask skillet with coffee. I have pictures of the food but the mimosa was so damn good, I finished it before remembering to take pics. (sorry)

My breakfast came with 2 eggs, potatoes and a pancake. Like I mentioned, I'm not a big breakfast eater, so I didn't want any meat. When my platter came (that's right, I said PLATTER), I couldn't do anything but buck my eyes. How big is this pancake, I asked the waitress. And I quote"" 18 inches"". When I tasted the food all I could say was ummm. They eggs tasted like they plucked them from up under a chicken they had out back. (don't know if they have a chicken house out back, but they were just that fresh!) The potatoes were awesome and the pancake tasted like buttermilk.

My hubby food came but before that he couldn't stop talking about the coffee. Now let me tell you, my husband drinks coffee, I don't. All he could talk about before his food came was how good the coffee was. I'm serious, he would not shut up about this coffee. He made me try the coffee. It was ok but like I said, I'm not a coffee drinker.

To quote my hubby, ""This is some damn good hash. The best I ever had"". My plate had so  much food on it 3 people could have ate with me. Even my husband had food left on his plate (and that's a surprise cause he usually don't leave anything!) 

The bill came out to $40 but it was well worth it. You will not be sorry. I say go to Hash House on Sahara.",HkhZ0IovT3dAOnhfh10CkQ,3,2,5,B-xq1ZK_kq2q3Pk5DQyJQQ

Not everyone liked the sweet sauce on it. I think all of the chicken dishes were ok, but not FABU. I still stand by that the garlic mashed potatoes are THE best potatoes I have ever had.

It was pretty full. Which was a good sign, at first. After a brief wait, we sat down and looked at our menus. When the waitress first came over we ordered speciality coffee drinks. In the meantime we continued to look at the menu. Once we were ready we put the menus to the side and started talking. I noticed that people next to us had ordered and just gotten their food while we were sitting there and we had still to order and get our drinks. 15 minutes goes by and our waitress finally takes our orders. Meantime the other couple is finishing up their meal we have still to receive either part of our meal. Another 10 minutes, our waitress comes over to tell us the coffee bar is backed up. 25 minutes? of not receiving our drinks? How hard is it to make a coffee drink and add a little flare on the side? Anyhow, my drink comes first, by itself. Then our food, then 5 minutes into our food, his drink.  Seriously? Maybe you could let us know before we order them that we won't get them for 30 minutes.

No matter how good the food was the service was awful. I don't think we will ever go back. Mid-meal we asked for waters and that took 10 minutes alone, I eventually had to stand up and ask another waitress. No thank you.

There is this obsession with quantity in our culture, and Hash House is the epitome of this obsession.  I was awe struck by the mountains of cooked flesh and grease that was being served all around me.  People were taking pictures of their food (no doubt to post on Yelp).  As I waited for my french toast, I wondered how much of this stuff people cram into their bodies every day.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a health nut.  I could care less really, but even I have my limits.  My french toast with bananas on it tasted awesome for the first few bites.  However, after chewing on this thing for a while, I got bored.  That's right... as big and overblown as the food in this place is, I got bored of eating it.

This past weekend we were in Vegas for a friend's wedding and were pleasantly surprised to find out the owners opened location in the City of Sin. 

After taking a Zantac 75 pill, we headed over to the area to settle in and wait a good 45 minutes for a table for 2. Patience is key here friends; this location apparently has been on Man Vs Food (which I'm not familiar with) and some other food network shows. 

I had the Watermelon Kiwi Cooler which was beautiful to behold and deliciously refreshing to drink! 
I have a sensitive stomach so I decided to go easy and order the Blueberry Pecan Flapjacks with two bacon strips and eggs over easy. The pancake, as M put it, was bigger than his head! hehe... 

Damn was that pancake good although I only finished about 20% of it. M had the Basic or Original Breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon or ham and potatoes. Still GIGANTIC for a mere $8.95 price tag. 

Our server was great if not a bit harried due to the overwhelming crowds due to a biker convention in town! I took my dear Flapjack to go and tore a few pieces off later to munch on before sending the remaining bits into the ye olde hotel room trashcan. 

I would recommend going at least ONCE to check this place out. The decor is fun, the servers wearing great outfits and the food spot on. Yes, it is crowded and a bit crazy inside but the experience is worth it to see GIANT food. 

This place also reminds me of a now defunct restaurant in New York called Royal Canadian Pancake House that I used to go to in the early early 90's... anyone remember or been there? 

Anyways, go check it out!",0LH1mll4w-uG-u44bRJV0g,2,0,4,pQb2QIVvDW6EUgLRM9lFXg

The portions are huge, even by Claim Jumper standards, but I just don't get why so many people love this place considering that every single time I've gone there (because someone else wanted to go), I have never had a very good tasting meal. It's like they are afraid of using salt or actually flavoring the food. Bland doesn't begin to cover it. 

Once you are seated, the service is good, fast, and generally friendly, though some of the staff members seem a little stressed or annoyed at times. My largest issue with this place is the food. Massive quantities with a rosemary sprig only go so far when it's not followed up with delicious flavor. 

I have had their skillets, pancakes, and even a burger. None of them stood out as being something I would have again.  Yet every time I'm hosting a friend from out if town, I am dragged there because of the hype and publicity.

We did not have to wait for seating although this place was full of people.  The portions are HUGE.  This is not an exaggeration.  The service we received was rather slow, but maybe because they are very busy, however, our waiter seemed to ignore us.  I had the French Toast, which I never order for breakfast anywhere, but the description, ""griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup"", made me want to order it.  How could I resist anything dipped in banana cinnamon cream?  My taste buds had such high expectation, but sadly, they were let down.  Where was the creamy taste of banana cinnamon cream?  The french toast was fine, but truly nothing exceptional - in fact, it tasted just like the french toast I've made for myself at home, which is not saying much.  However, if you are in Vegas, I still suggest you visit, especially if big portions are calling your name.  Just order something other than the french toast, in fact, if I ever go back there, I think I would check the place out for lunch or dinner because I've discovered at other eateries that I've visited, that a place can have awesome food, but breakfast tends to be a weak link.

The waffles however are always terrible. Being as how they have bacon inside them, you would think they would be great. We always end up pulling the bacon out and eating that alone.  They have good strong coffee and the Jam Du jour is tasty. My favorite dish is the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, but sometimes the potatoes come out cold.

The first time I went was for breakfast and I had the corned beef hash. It was pretty really good because it was ""real"" corned beef hash. (You will see what I mean.)

My most recent visit was for dinner. I had the sage chicken with the penne pasta. I did not like the pasta, but the chicken was pretty good. My boyfriend got the sage fried chicken and waffles. He thought it was amazing and so did I! 

As far as food presentation goes, they do that very well. The food (during breakfast) is served on these large, heavy skillets. Dinner is served on large (and I mean large) plates.

 Our server Jessica has to be one of the best servers I've had. Ever. She was fast with getting to us, getting out drinks, and she knew the menu like the back of her hand! She knew prices and what drinks were really good. She helped recommend popular dishes and checked up on us through out the meal. She was just great. Fun and outgoing! We'll ask for her next time we go in! She's perfect if you've never been there before! Amazing customer service. 

Now for the actual food/drinks. The kiwi watermelon lemonade is worth every penny! It comes in a beautiful three layer setting with a watermelon slice on top! Just mix it and it's so good. Not too sour and not too sweet. I got the chicken fried steak, of course. Typical! It's my favorite breakfast meal. It came with some string beans which aren't my favorite but they were cooked and seasoned perfectly! I actually enjoyed it! The mashed potatoes had bacon bits in it. How much better could it get? Oh yeah! The chicken fried steak! It was so big! At least 9 inches big. The breading was coming off every time I cut into it because of how crispy it was. That's a good thing. Just mix it with the gravy and you're good! The gravy was perfectly seasoned as well. I don't know about you, but the gravy can either make it or break it! The man got Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. It's a little spicy which is amazing! The sauce made the dish.The chicken was so crispy and juicy. It also came with the same mashed potatoes with bacon, scrambled eggs, cantelope, a slice of watermelon, and a biscuit. The biscuits here are huge! The portions here are so big, so don't let the prices scare you. You will have leftovers! Nothing a microwave can't fix though. $16.99 for my country fried steak was beyond reasonable for how good it was and how huge the dish was. At the end, our amazing server Jessica kindly brought out a slice of watermelon and cantelope since Chris wanted more!

2709191,2011-05-09,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"If you care about value, then this is the place to eat breakfast/brunch when you are in Vegas, at the Imperial Palace.  After hearing about this place on Man vs. Food, my buddy and I came with the intention of eating our one meal of the day here.  We were met with a half-hour long wait, plenty of time to let our appetites work themselves into a tizzy as we decided on what to order.  As the 2 of us sat down, the group of 5 ladies next to us suggested that we split a single dish.  We scoffed at their suggestion and proceeded to order 3 entrees, intent on guaranteeing a heart attack before the age of 50.

The first dish to come out was the biscuits and gravy.  Now, I love biscuits and gravy in a way that is completely unnatural and unhealthy, some might say unholy, and I'm normally left wanting from weakly seasoned gravy with piddling amounts of sausage.  Not here!  There are meaty chunks of pork sausage in a nicely peppered gravy base over a couple hearty and moist biscuits, covered by scrambled eggs and sitting over a mound of mashed potatoes.  Hot damn, this was definitely one of the best breakfast items I've ever had and I will be back for this and only this when I come back to Vegas.

The item that had been featured on Man vs. Food and found its way into my dreams was the fried chicken benedict.  Overall, it was pretty satisfying but here's my beef with the dish. #1, you should call it a benedict if you don't poach the eggs, the yolks need to run all over the place and threaten you with delicious Salmonella, scrambled eggs is simply weak sauce.  #2, the benedict was served on biscuits, which was awesome cuz they were delish, but everything was then surrounded by a wall of mashed potatoes that turned the base into a gloppy mess.  #3, the fried chicken sounded fantastic as described by Adam Richman, but overall the seasoning left me wanting.  #4, I know bacon makes just about everything better, but this was a bit much.  And what's this about tomato slices?  Is this becoming a salad?!  The flavors together would've been better off in some God-forsaken breakfast sandwich but this was just too unwieldy.  Overall, I felt like less would've been more.

Finally, the 3rd item ordered was the Kokomo, aka the meatloaf sandwich.  Whoever their baker is, they deserve a prize, because the milk bread that they grill for this sandwich is simply fantastic, just as good as their biscuits.  The meatloaf was well-seasoned and extremely satisfying with good quality beef.  The only problems were the overload of roasted tomatoes, which gave me immediate heartburn with a single whiff, and the side of mac and cheese that, contrary to what our nice waitress said, was the most pedestrian mac and cheese I have ever eaten (you're better off eating Kraft Easy Mac), unsalted and watery penne in a strange mish-mash of oddly flavored cheeses.  The best part of all of the meal (other than the biscuits and gravy) was that we housed 3 plates of food with people staring at us in awe/fear/shame, and I felt I channeled my inner Adam Richman to successfully defeat our challenge.

For the prices, I'm not sure if any place in Vegas will give you as good a deal as the Hash House.  If you're a sane person, you could probably split a dish or order one and take the remnants home.  If you are looking for a gourmet breakfast, however, you may need to move on.",pNDsq4v56zTT2xhyYvUMQQ,1,0,3,CYhNaxBgwgGK-CYi8dP_iA

A quick drive from the strip and we arrive to a packed house (outdoors was crowded as well and this was late December)

After an amazing bloody mary at the bar we were seated maybe 15-20 minute wait not bad and all the people working were extremely nice and helpful.

I shared the chorizo hash with someone; this was due to the fact that we saw the portion sizes and i will say they are generous..

The food was beyond amazing, tasty, cooked just right and damn Im sorry I shared.

Someone else ordered the pancakes and I must say ""there as big as your head spider"" Goodfellas quote...and again taste really amazing..

On my most recent visit to Vegas to see my Vegas Favs, the four of us came on a Saturday and the wait was only about 25-35minutes. Not too bad at all!! 

We were helped by Nick!! He was awesome!! I could tell that he was very busy with many other tables but he was still positive, cheerful, upbeat and attentive to our table. 

We ordered 2 Andy Sage Fried Chicken ($13.50/each) a Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, bacon, crispy potatoes and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) a Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack and another Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, sausage and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) an Apple Cinnamon Flapjack. For drinks we ordered 3 Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade ($5.50 each) and a Banana Latte ($5.99).

My Andy Sage Fried Chicken was AMAZING!!!!!! The portions here are huge and I was able to each this for
multiple meals :D It is served with a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then two biscuits, tomatoes, bacon, the huge fried chicken, 2 scrambled eggs on top. And all of that loveliness and covered in their tasty special sauce. I highly recommend this item!! I think Man vs Food even featured this item of one of their episodes!!! 

My friends really enjoyed their Tractor Driver Combos but it was too HUGE!! They were only able to stuff down half  of their order, but the flapjacks aren't ideal to togo. I would recommend sharing this item if you order it :) 

You can't come here without trying their award winning Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade!!!!!!! It is refreshing, well balanced AND pretty for the camera. I think you can pay more and get a souvenir cup from Hash House if you order this beverage :)

When I see the words 'chicken' and 'waffles' on a menu I really don't need to look any further. What arrived was a jaw-dropping, head-turning architectural digest-worthy tower of juicy fried chicken and waffles.

2748064,2013-03-04,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"We recently took a family road trip from San Jose all the fricken way to Las Vegas and it was one of the best road trips I have ever taken.  The desolate scenery was exactly what I needed to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city.  Because we came in right before the New Year, everything was packed, and the hotels no longer sold those Buffet of Buffet passes.  But surprisingly, the Imperial Palace, now known as the Quad, was our jewel on the strip.  Because the dining at Hash House is way up at the top of the Quad, it was not swamped with people.  After escaping the mad crowds and taking several escalators to something like the fifth floor, we got to Hash House.  The service is prompt, they seated us quick, and were oh so kind to talk about the menu to let us know what we were getting into.  Hash House's theme is ""freaky farm food"" and it is so true to its nature.  Everything on the menu is some traditional classic like waffles, fried chicken, steak, pork chops, all twisted into some freakish concoction either through sheer size of portion or some twist in the cooking methodology.

We were looking for a dinner for three, and know that because we're small and Asian, we don't eat that much.  A McDonald's chicken patty can be dinner for 2 of us with rice.  We went for the most highly recommended item based on conversations with buddies - FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.  Holy !$%^.  The stupid thing is gi-normous.  My good buddy who recommended said not to order more than 1 because it would make us feel guilty.  Once you see the thing, you realize you're in trouble.  3 fried chicken breasts over 3 bacon-stuffed waffles, fried herbs on top, and some kind of mash hash thing under it all.  Maple syrups is provided to glaze over the whole mess.  At the top, there is an 8"" jagged blade stuck down the entire stack to keep it in one piece.  We ordered a house garden salad, entree style, to help offset the protein rich platter.  

It took 3 of us to down the entire thing.  The way it was fried was beautiful.  Something in the batter just made it all the better.  The waffles were crisp, wholesome, and the bacon was just a nice added bonus.  If any one single person were to finish this on their own, I would congratulate them for setting themselves up for their first heart attach.  I don't even want to know the calorie count on that bad boy.  

One of the things I love about the place is that they sell gift cups for their blended drinks.  The hostess was so kind to recommend it.  We ordered a couple drinks, enjoyed them, and they washed, dried, and boxed our cups to go - a great gift.  

Bottom line: if you are vegetarian, don't go here.  For everyone else, this is as good as a Vegas buffet at HALF the price.  Because of its separation from the casino part of the hotel, it was a glad reprieve from the madness and second hand smoke.  Nice and tucked away, on a very late evening, it's a great place to eat in peace.  Lunch and dinner rush time though ... I'm sooo soooo sorry for you all...!

Oh yeah, expect to have ZERO cellular signal in this part of the hotel... I love being disconnected from work calls and emails.  Damn you blackberry, damn you!",XUV0MeZewKrsU6N7oBJN0Q,0,0,5,_1aGXYtvLfgtnhMHIXH8lQ

Did I mention the portions are astronomically huge? I ordered the ""appetizer"" beef tenderloin over crispy polenta and explicitly asked the waitress if it was especially large. She replied that it was ""appetizer size."" Was it an appetizer for a giant?!? This thing was a full-on steak on a hearty slice-of-cake size piece of crispy polenta. And it was covered in cheese! I was so full! But dumbly, I had ordered a sandwich on top of that! The sandwich was a ""griddled"" cheese sandwich which was described as cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato and prosciutto. Each slice of bread was an inch thick! I ate a quarter of it and thought I was going to pass out. 
The extreme positive out of all this was that the food was actually good. I marvel at the ability to prepare food that good in such massive quantities.

This time for me...I came very hungry.  Ordered the chicken and waffles, since I had it before and loved it. The waffles have bacon in them..bacon.  The syrup is sweet enough to offset the saltiness of the chicken.  Perfect pair.  The sage they put on the chicken, gives it such a unique flavor that I just love!

The steak knife holding the dish together is needed.  I cut that thing up methodically and devoured it.  Even got a compliment from one of the waitresses who was impressed with how I took down the plate.  I didn't know if I should be completely proud of myself...or run to the gym since I now feel like the fattest person in our universe. All-in all...I didn't have doggy bag.  Mission accomplished.

All the food here is great.  Can't go wrong with anything.  If you want to be prissy and complain about portion size? Go somewhere else.

We had specialty drinks all around, including the Oreo mocha (so good my non-coffee fan husband sucked the whole thing down), banana latte (delish!), and a blueberry lemonade that my dad loved.

The food portions are epic.  The selections are creative and oh-so-tasty that it'll kill you to not be able to finish.  Most of the breakfast items strike me as superb hangover/post mass alcohol consumption delights (fitting for any LV breakfast haunt), but are still well-suited for a non-inebriated experience as well.

The scramble with the salmon and brie was amazing.  The crispy potatoes are quite good, but the griddled mash puts up a darn good fight.  The chicken and waffles are more of a visual novelty, but are still pretty good.

My recommendation: Share your entree with a friend and order one side dish to waive the dish splitting fee. My friend and I shared the chicken and waffles and got a side of fruit (just to be a little healthy). 

The Chicken and waffles were SO GOOD! The waffles were very dense and thick and they had strips of bacon baked INSIDE. Wow!! That's a genius idea!! The chicken was so crispy and tender; just perfect. They drizzled syrup over the entire plate which I thought was weird at first since I never thought that syrup and fried chicken would go together, but the pairing of the sweetness of the syprup and the salty chicken was just HEAVEN!

Arrived: 8:09pm
Reservation: 8:30pm
Seated: 8:58pm
Server: Anna

Well, we made a reservation for 7 people for 8:30pm. We were celebrating a birthday. Arrived at 8:09pm and were told that our reservation was at 7;30pm and we had been marked as no shows. Luckily my husband who made the reservation, records all his calls so he played the recording for the host and they realized they had made a mistake. My husband approached the manager (actually the DM, Theron) at 8:36pm and was told we'd be seated in 2 minutes. He was very unapologetic and seemed to not care at all that there were 9 people including a wheelchair taking up all the space in the entryway as the inside waiting area was full. As we were waiting, another couple who had arrived prior to us were sitting, also waiting in the tiny now claustrophobic entry, but they got up and walked out. Now mind you there was an entire section of the restaurant that was  unoccupied but I guess it's possible they could've had a good reason for that. Like not enough servers maybe. 
Sean, the host was very friendly and kept coming over to let us know that no tables were available yet. He also mentioned that they have a 20 minute policy, meaning that they have 20 minutes post reservation time to seat guests. We were finally seated at 8:58pm. 28 minutes past our reservation time.
Our waitress was Anna and she was friendly, spunky, funny and fast. Definitely put us in a much better mood. Our food arrives pretty quick. We were all served by 9:30pm.
I had been here once before and had the chicken and waffles but was not impressed by the flavor  so I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict this time and it was quite tasty. I really enjoyed it and only was able to finish 1/4 of it. The portion was HUGE! Baby girl had the vanilla waffle. She too only finished less than 1/4 of it but said she didn't really like it. Hubs got the portabella burger. The bun was way bigger than the mushroom so he felt like it was mostly bread. He was not impressed with that dish. My son is vegan and there wasn't anything on or off the menu for him other than a side of fruit per the server so he did not order anything but I kinda expected that so I wasn't swayed. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals though they didn't comment one way or the other. My FIL didn't finish his chicken and waffles which is so weird because he always finishes his meals and everyone else's lol. But I think it's because of the huge portions! 
Our server did apologize for the long wait to be seated when she brought the check and pointed out that she didn't charge us for the drinks. (2 hot teas, 1 Pepsi & 1 iced tea.) 
I'm giving them 2 stars. 1 for the friendliness of the host and server (Sean and Anna) and 1 for my meal.",WC1QjEVkGosEW1dmX3ZGrA,5,2,2,WRv0o35FmRmgDvmL_MiotQ

While the food portions are definitely huge, I just felt the food wasn't anything to make you want to write home about. I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, which was tasty and extremely filling. My wife ordered the chicken pot pie and was not very impressed with the breading.

     Another issue to beware of is that they ""decorate"" the plates with a ring of hot sauce for no apparent reason. I personally like spicy food, but we had family members with us who don't and were not particularly happy about this. Please note that nowhere on the menu does it state that your entree will be served with a hot sauce garnish. They need to be more aware that some guests may be have pepper allergies or turned off by this. Kind of an odd twist anyway, in my opinion.
 
     On the whole, the food and service were decent enough. I was just not impressed to the point where I would go out of my way to recommend this restaurant over some others. The ""A Go-Go"" is just ""a so-so""",U-05lj3UvME4JQ6mQ1rREA,2,1,3,tD4tno2i2_0pNxgm0rgLvw

2786735,2012-08-26,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Was kinda disappointed, but will give it another try. The wife and I went late on a Saturday for dinner. We walked in and the place was empty at 915pm. Okay it was closing in 45 minutes, but was very surprised. We were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. We were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. She showed us to the table and made some recommendations since I had announced it was our first time there.
 I knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. We looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. I ordered the chicken and bacon waffle tower, the wife had the chik pot pie. Both were huge. The potpie comes in what looks like a crust hat. The chikn waffles is built like a tower. The presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. The fried chicken was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. The waffles on the other hnd were the best part... The bacon inside were crisp. I really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. I think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. I mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and fried chicken, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... Very off putting. 
The potpie was different than usual which is fine. I can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies and potatoes. The wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p. 
Bad news... The dessert. We had a Restaurant.com coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. We ordered a snickers bread pudding. It comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. It was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... Okay. Then we get into the bread pudding... It wasn't bread pudding at all. It was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and I don't know...cooked somehow... I think it was microwaved because I hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. I asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. She then looked at me blankly... I looked at her blankly. My wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.

I will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the Benedict. Again just to be clear... I believe it is way overhyped so if u go, use a restaurant.com coupon, and don't expect great food.

I never go wrong with the Sage Chicken and Waffles... But you sure need a big appetite because it is a huge heaping plate of food.  I have only managed to eat 1/2 at most and that was a struggle.

What I do now is go with a friend and we split an order of the sage chicken and waffles and add a side of sausage.  That is enough for 2 normal adults.

The sage chicken is wonderful with great flavor that is not overpowering or greasy.  it is lightly fried with tender and flavorful meat.  The sage flavor is there but not too heavy so it compliments the fried chicken well.

The waffles are great and it has bacon slices inside so when you bite it, you get both bacon and waffle in the same bite.  Put some maple syrup on it and I am in heaven.

It also comes with the home made mashed potatoes which is great but who has space for that with the chicken and waffles?  The sausages are also very juicy and I order it just to round out the breakfast feel, but it's optional for you if you don't want any more food.

I would say go to this one on Charleston though and skip the one in the M Resort.  My friends who have gone to both say the one in M Resort is not as good as the original restaurant.",j7W6t1Bjb3H1vCTtk3wiCA,0,1,5,OSmp_X6SsQPfWXDfp2QTqw

2807797,2014-12-21,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Size matters.  But does it matter enough?  The first thing that strikes you about Hash House, even as your hostess walks you to your table, is the size of the breakfasts on the tables you walk past.  Ranging from ample to massive, the breakfasts seem to dare you to finish them.  Eggs Benedicts piled so high you have to peak around them to find your Bloody Mary.  Pancakes the size of a small trampoline.  You're going to need a bigger fork.

But this is Vegas, and there are at least a couple of dozen hotels offering massive breakfast buffets.  Here, eating your fill is not enough to knock your socks off.  So, Hash House, what else you got?

Well, as it turns out, they got pretty good food and a lot of attitude.  By ""attitude,"" I mean a mildly ""holier-than-thou"" approach to their menu, reminiscent of Prius owners' approach to their cars.  Hash House makes it a point of pride that nothing on the menu is quite what you expect.  They offer a variety of Benedicts, but none of them with the traditional hollandaise sauce because that would be so, you know, traditional.  (I know that's the reason, because I asked the waiter.)  Breakfast potatoes are mashed or crispy-roasted, but not hash browns.  ""Favorite"" scrambles (according to the menu) are salmon, chuck roast, and smoked chicken.  And if you're really curious, you can order the ""Old School Fried Mush.""  (Don't ask me; I didn't order it.)

The service was friendly, but a little slow.  One of our party ordered hash with a poached egg on top.  The hash arrived, without the poached egg.  We asked for the egg.  Five minutes later, the server came over and told us that the chef had broken the egg and would have to cook another one.  Another five minutes, and the egg arrived.  Five minutes?  What, were they waiting on the chicken?

Anyway, the one thing you have to say about Hash House is that if popularity is a metric, they must be doing something right.  Our wait to be seated was only about 15 minutes on a Saturday morning, but judging from the size of the outdoor waiting area there must be times when the line outside is longer than the dining room inside.

The waitress seemed a bit stressed (due to possible understaffing) and barely got a moment of her time. I had ordered the BLT bloody Mary, nothing too special and a bit spicy for my taste. The slice of bread that comes with it - awesome idea...but the toast was rock hard and if there were a few more slices of bacon to go with it, it'd have been perfect! I'd have even dunked it into my bloody Mary to make the perfect app. I know how crazy certain places can get with a good bloody mary. 

I ordered the fried chicken Benedict, my friend ordered the salmon scramble(I think). She had feared, after ordering, that what she'd ordered wouldn't be what's expected. As soon as the food came(ca. 15mins later), it wasn't what she'd expected and sent it back. Around 5mins. Later, her replacement meal was served. The kitchen was definitely on top of their game that day! We were both impressed by the timing at that point. 

I'll definitely be ordering something different next time - my benedict had WAY too much chipotle. The portions are gigantic, which is great if you actually pike your dish - you'll have plenty leftover. 

I might add that I seriously loathe their fried spaghetti garnish.",KhD6ip17SPOusQp_jQOPiA,0,0,3,vmlb66ZI63b0WtzKeNivlQ

A weekend in Vegas with fellow Yelpers K-Fed and Teem, my good friend who just moved to LV, Cheska took us here. She raved about this place since we got into town late Friday night and we were here for Sunday lunch. I can honestly say, why in the world didn't we come here sooner?!?! 

This place is modern, with a little country thrown in. I mean, they even serve beer out of a bag!! The music they play is an interesting mix as well. One second you'll hear No Doubt, another, you're hear some hiphop. I'm liking the mixture!

On to the food, I ordered a apple smoked bacon & mashed potato one pound stuffed burger. They basically sandwich the bacon and mashed potatoes in-between two patties!! This thing was so thick, they had a steak knife stuck in the middle of it with the entire blade unseen!

The burger was surprisingly moist and the bacon and mashed potatoes just put me into an instant (but heavenly) food coma. 

I even had some string like fries?, which were OK, but the burger, damn, was a really good burger. My only semi-""complaint"", how to keep that sucker together. Once I pulled the knife out and took many bites (can't fit it all in my mouth, shut up), the thing fell apart like a stack of dominoes. 

My other foodies in tow, decided on breakfast (which looked just as good). The servings are VERY generous and the pricing just right for what you get. Quality AND quantity. The service was right on as well. I can't wait, maybe next time we'll come for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",EE9txZm_zUFqWeYGVGaFNg,6,6,5,zX2N5HxNbtMbsQinlpY4ng

Pancake I swear was size of hubcap; chicken and waffles had to be about a foot high on the plate.  Hubby had the BBBLT sandwich which had almost half a head of lettuce, almost a whole tomato, about 8 slices of bacon, and milk bread that was about 2 inches thick. It came with a steak knife stabbed in the middle holding it together.  I had the cob salad platter - errrrr I mean plate.  Big chunks of everything in it including a whole avocado and a biscuit about the size of a softball.

A lot of people were gawking at other tables food orders cause they were all huge.  One guy at a table behind us just stared at his plate for awhile before he figured out how to attack it.  The prices aren't too bad, but you get food enough and then some for what you pay.

Pros:
  *  Generous portions for the hungry
  *  Really good customer service (this is important to me)
  *  Quality food and decently priced
  *  They quoted me a 30 minute wait, but it was actually quicker than that.

Cons:
  *  If you like embarrassing a birthday celebrant, don't bring them here.  No singing.
  *  busy busy busy so expect a wait.
  
Overall:
  Okay so there was a wait (there is always a wait), but I guess that's a good sign right?  One thing is for sure, they have some enormous portions.  So big in fact that Man Vs. Food's Vegas episode actually came to this location to feast.  Don't mistake quality for quantity here.  The portions are grand ,but the taste is just as amazing.  

Tips:
  *  If you share, make sure to order an extra side, otherwise they automatically charge you an extra $2 dollars.  Might as well get something extra since you're going to pay for it either way right?  

 *  Try some of their specialty drinks.  I forgot the exact name of my favorite, but it comes with a watermelon wedge dangling off the edge of the glass.  Spectacular!

We went to the Las Vegas restaurant, and needless to say we were very  disappointed.

My food was cold
My mother asked for coffee, she was delivered coffee and creamer, no spoon
I asked for butter for my wife and I, as the ran by she  waitress dropped a cup of butter that was almost empty, barely enough for a  1/2  of a biscuit.

Then to top it off I had bought a coupon from Resraurant.com,  I failed to notice that that coupon said ""Dinner"" on it, the waitress said that she could not accept it.  She said that there was a different coupon for Breakfast and that I should have used that one.  I asked to talk to the manager, I explained the situation to the manager, she said sorry she could not honor the coupon that ""we lose money on those anyway""  I found her response to be disturbing, you do not issue coupons to make money, you do it to draw new customers to your establishment.  Although the coupon error was my fault, I thought that maybe she would see fit to offer me some sort of discount, offer me the discount of the ""Breakfast"" coupon or something, you know the old ""the customer is always right"" adage, I have been to dozens of restaurants where they have taken expired coupons, etc, because they want to make the customer happy.  Apparently this manager did not see the need to make the customer feel better, just to make a buck.    I know that this customer will not be back and I will not recommend this place to anyone else either.",2mjiBAubKhBhOLRLrl4pXg,0,0,2,311iE9tuqzCD7UIFY4jh-Q

I was on vacation and my family suggested to go here. I'm not a big fan of chicken and waffles but this place definitely changed my mind! 
Oh my gosh... their servings are HUGE but definitely worth it. One plate can definitely be shared and I highly recommend sharing one! 

I ended up order the crab cake Benedict I believe and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. Both plates were amazing but sadly they were both too big for us to each finish our own. This waffles were lightly crisp and the chicken was very juicy and wet and not dry at all! My crab cakes Benedict was amazing, the eggs were poached perfectly where the yolk would still be runny. 

Only downfall was that our sever took awhile to do refills on our drinks and check up on us if we were okay.

Other than that, I'm actually really glad that we tried this place out because next time we head to Vegas for vacation again, we're most likely going to come back here for their chicken and waffles again.

Out of four people we had the corned beef hash, the basic breakfast, and two different scrambles.. I had the basic breakfast with a side of gravy and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes and biscuits and gravy were exceptional. I was loving that gravy all over my biscuit, but sadly my eggs were undercooked and not satisfying. My friends corned beef hash seemed a bit too cheesy due to the overwhelming chunks that smothered his meat. My friends said their scrambles were good, but one said they didn't like how they didn't allow her to customize it to her liking.

The spices just a tad more than the tastebuds are comfortable with. It was weird.

The Baby Back Ribs was slathered with BBQ sauce and tasted like it was slow-roasted the entire day. The delicate meat fell of the bone when disturbed. It's very lovely. Garlic Mashed Potatoes has a chunky texture and is garlicky, and that's not a bad thing. It's a shame, we didn't have stomachs like Bunyan to have room for dessert.

The food is incredibly good, and you get an incredible amount of it. This is not an exaggeration. The portions make Claim Jumper look anemic.

I ordered a pork tenderloin eggs benedict and it was 9"" high! The pork tenderloin was hammered thin and tender, and it was 12"" across! Plus, it has a grapefruit sized portion of mashed potatoes on the side along with some fruit. At it's not just lumped on there. The presentation is fantastic.

I was sitting at the bar and when they delievered my food the people waiting for their tables started gathering around me to take pictures of my plate. It was seriously that impressive.

It's not just the portions that impress either. Instead of a traditional hollandaise sauce for the eggs benedict, they have specific sauces for each style you order. Since mine was the pork, they had an amazing creamy teriyaki sauce that had some caramel flavors in it. Absolutely fantastic! You could cook a shoe in that stuff and it would taste great!

The drink menu is also amazing. I had a kiwi watermelon lemonade, and it was served in a tall class with all three layers seperated. Red on top, white in the middle, and green at the bottom. It looked like the Italian flag.

The only drawback to this place is that it is so freaking popular, that you will almost always have a long wait. But it's hard to rate them down for that. They can't help it if 100 people show up at the same time for lunch.",Br8LOacyANG7nI9r0DRqLQ,1,1,5,n2uKnopy2Tt5pd0tWS2Zsw

I used to live in Vegas and never got out there mainly because I was always working during the week and my friend (who worked there) said that it was a VERY long wait on the weekends so don't bother. I was visiting Vegas and went to the restaurant during the week and it was perfect. We only waited 5 minutes and were seated.

The food is GREAT. I'm not sure why, but the server would take a long time taking orders so could not check back on us.  Why does this surprise me? They don't take special orders so you have to order as it is on the menu. Anyhow, the food makes up for this. The portions are humongous. We took our leftovers back to our condo and were able to enjoy them later.

Giving this restaurant anything more than a two is insane!

Had the fried chicken waffle thing. Fried chicken was juicy and crispy but it tasted like NOTHING. It was bizarre how it had no flavor. The bacon in the waffles is an interesting idea but the doughy, undercooked, flavorless waffles didn't seal the deal.

The portion was HUGE but who cares if the food is garbage? It has been a long time since I felt this disgusting after eating. The rather large couple next to us were boxing their leftovers... LEFTOVERS... and it was still enough to feed someone for three days. Looked so gross.

Also got the filet appetizer that is served on polenta with some sort of pesto on it. Again - FLAVORLESS... Unreal!

Unlike some of other reviews, our service was pretty good. The waiter was friendly, our drinks well looked out for. The place is clean and looks nice on the inside.

We went to HH for breakfast around 10:30 on Sunday morning and sat down immediately.  Lucky timing -- because when we left about an hour later the line was huge.  Much like the huge portions of food we were served.  My husband had one of the Sunday Specials -- a giant skillet with pork tenderloin, home fried potatoes, green beans, corn, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella, 2 fried eggs and a huge biscuit.  I had a scramble that consisted of salmon, pesto and brie that was also served with home fries and huge biscuit.  We switched plates half way through and still brought home a (you guessed it) HUGE box of leftovers.

My husband liked the very strong coffee that was refilled often.  I liked the homemade blackberry jam atop the biscuits.  The food was good, but needed a bit more salt then we're used to adding.  The service was top notch, especially considering how busy the place was the entire time.

Sure we had a rocky start, we had a big group and had to wait 40 minutes for a table. When we were ready, we got a booth while we wanted a table, I take the blame for not being more clear but that was an extra 15 minute wait. We ended up being seated outside.

It's Vegas, its friggen hot. With that in mind, I don't know why you had to go back and forth with us with the Misters and Fan when we were the only group outside. When you told us the manager asked you to turn the misters off and we asked to talk to the manager, he never showed up and we ended up leaving the misters on.

There was a very tense and awkward moment with your establishment and us, but once the GIGANTIC (I love you for that) portions came out everyone was gleeful and happy. When my friend ordered a entree and a flapjack (he didn't believe me they were big) he was totally overwhelmed by the food and we had the flapjack served like pizza to the whole table.

Your food is DELICIOUS, I know that for sure. I could eat your fresh made Jelly all day (strawberry peach was what we had that day) on top of the thick moist biscuits we get with our meals.

Suffice to say, we all had take home food which we enjoyed thoroughly. I'll definitely come back to either of your locations, and realistically you're a 4/5 star in my mind, just the sour experience ruined it a bit but not enough for me to stop eating your food.

Also sorry for stealing all the jelly on the table...

The chicken was moist, but the breading had absolutely no taste. Salt & pepper was missing. The waffle was creative, but very chewy. The dried grass (leeks) didn't belong.  As for the hash, they hid literally black potatoes underneath the meat. The eggs arrived slightly cold, and bland.

3024298,2010-06-17,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"When people write of the downfall of America, Hash House A Go Go must be included.  I say that because if we all go here, it will makes us fat, happy and complacent.  I ate there five days ago and I think Im still full.  Giant portions are but a small (Large?) measure of Hash's greatness.  

Working under the moniker ""Twisted Farm Food,"" Hash has the decor of an industrial style barn.  While being seated, you notice every table gawking at other tables in sheer awe of what is being delivered to other tables.  Imagine being at a Hospital nursery and all the babies are 25 lbs, and the fathers are just looking at each other and smiling.  That's whats going on here.  

First thing I noticed was the prices...they're really cheap for the amount of food I saw coming out.  I dont think anything was more than $15.  The waitress explained that the restaurant makes everything from scratch and that there are no heat lamps meaning food can be brought out at different times.  Working under that guise, I contemplated what would I like to try in giant form and made of scratch that Ive probably never had before.  I settled on the Pounded Pork Tenderloin sandwich with crispy french fries.

When my sandwich came out, I desperately asked my waitress for tactical help on how to eat it.  The sandwich was so large I had no idea where to begin.  She laughed no doubt having heard that 100's of times before.  I finally dove in and found the pork cutlet to be tender and tasty.  Not the absolute best I ever had, but for the price and the portions I felt it was more than acceptable.  The fries were excellent and actually crispy...rare is it when a restaurant advertises crispy these days and actually delivers a crispy product.  My party also really enjoyed their oversized sandwiches of various ilk.  

As we descended into dreams of wearing elastic pants for our expanded waistlines, we became part of the peanut gallery looking at other peoples tables and what they had ordered.  The burgers are ginormous and the breakfasts really steal the show.  Pancakes the size of pizzas, hash brown servings that must be made of two full potatoes and toast truly of the ""Texas"" variety.  There are so many things I need to go back and try but these trips must be rationed for health's sake.

Service was very friendly and accommodating and there was relatively little wait to be seated although I do know on weekends at brunch time you will wait awhile (I see it whenever I drive by).  Another great added benefit was that with my $13 sandwich I was able to get a full 3 meals out of it.  Three!!!

3032424,2010-07-22,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Hash House definitely didn't disappoint me with the amount of food they served on each plate. Unfortunately, HH wowed me with quantity and not with quality. Don't get me wrong, everything was edible, but I felt the combination of the Sage Fried Chicken w/ Waffles could have been executed better.

I think the Maple flavored bacon inside the Waffle was a great idea. Trying to achieve that Sweet and Salty flavor some people crave, but this could have been accomplished with smaller bits of bacon within the Waffle. Instead you have large pieces of bacon stuck in between each waffle, I ended up avoiding the bacon all together.

The caramel for this dish actually ruined my Fried Chicken. I prefer my Fried Chicken, untouched with any condiments, this is just a personal preference, but it may apply to those who are considering this dish.  The Fried Chicken itself was crispy, tender, but lacked some unique flavors. I didn't taste any spice or herbs that may have been used in this dish.

FYI: Because their portions are fairly large, there is ~$2.50 surcharge for splitting a dish. The server recommended I order french fries on the side, instead of paying for the surcharge.",Hb6LUSM-JH5JV5jV3GqVoQ,1,1,3,3J-nigRRrMor1Oxp-AGfJQ

We waited an hour+ to be seated but it was so worth the wait!!!  It was the best breakfast ever and not to mention huge!!! We first heard about this place on the tv show ""Man vs. Food."" I hear it's a pretty famous place they have lots of pictures of celebrities even Martha Stuart not that's a big deal but it was impressive to see her sign that she enjoyed the food.

After waiting for an hour we were seated and it took a while to decide what to eat there was just so much to choose from and it all looked soo good. On the bottom of the menu it says, ""None of their food is pre-prepared so you wouldn't rush your mom to cook, would you?"" So after ordering it takes another 20 minutes til we got our food, once again it was well worth the wait!! I ordered the mango coconut pancake it was enormous!! It was the size of a large dinner plate and it came w/ potatoes and sausage. My bf ordered the breakfast plate also but w/ a plain pancake, my cousin ordered the skillet hash and my other cousin ordered a stuffed hamburger. All the plates were huge we were in a normal booth and it was covered with food there was hardly any room for our drinks. We could have eaten all this food for breakfast lunch and dinner!! The mango coconut pancake was so delicious they didn't skimp on the mango or coconut and the pancake mix was light and delicious. My cousin's stuffed hamburger looked amazing it was speared with a rosemary twig it looked just those burgers in those gourmet magazines and I hear it was really good also. I had too much on my plate to want more from my cousins. My cousin loved his skillet thing also. 

We LOVED this place and will be going back when we're back in Vegas. I highly recommend going just don't go when it's obviously a busy time like we did. When we left around 1:30pm there was still a few people waiting it was that good!! The prices were decent also I think each breakfast place was around $12-15 a person not bad for the quality of the ingredients and the quantity of the food.

Are usually go to the one that is inside of the link, but today went to one off the strip since it was closer to me.
The food was amazing as always and the service was great. But...
I ordered the meatloaf hash and the tractor combo with giant brown sugar banana pancake.  Both were amazing. But I couldn't help to notice that the pancake was literally 1/3 the size that it used to be a couple years ago. 
I don't know if it gradually got smaller over time or it happened in one step because people were wasting and throwing it away so often because it was so big.
It used to be so big and almost an inch thick. It took two people to finish it and even that was a huge struggle.  
Today I ate my whole tractor combo, as a dessert plate after I finished the hash house meatloaf which was much smaller than it previously was as well.
The food is great and the portions are still decent size so I will continue to come here regardless. But I can't be the only one that has noticed the portion size change all across the board.

(how does a place that is suppose to be farmers food not know what a country scramble is?!) she also never came by to check back up on us or refill our waters which we downed pretty fast. about 20-25 minutes pass and we finally get our food complete with no refill on our waters. the food was basic and lacked a lot of flavor. the potatoes did not leave me or my boyfriend wanting more. the eggs had no taste to them. the best part of this plate was the biscuit and fruit, or should i say lack there of fruit. the bacon waffle was not that impressive either. i could have made better. in fact i think i have. i shouldn't complain about it though because it did have more flavor than the eggs and potatoes. yes, the food here may be pretty to look at, but they need to work on flavors and making my taste buds yearn for more. i hardly ate any. our waitress was awful. never checked on us and when i asked for a box she brought me back a wet box and plastic bag along with the wrong check. sorry lady, but you are not getting more than you should.

3042992,2011-12-12,4,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Super fatty, ginormous, American breakfast feast platters. How can you go wrong? You're already at the city of Sin, just add gluttony to the list of vices.

I've seen Hash House A Go Go on the FoodNetwork and have heard great things from friends, so I made it a point to check this place out, and of all days, the morning of my Las Vegas Marathon. I made sure I had enough protein, carbs, and starches in my system to keep me going for the long haul. Boy, did that plan come to fruition.

My family and I showed up around 10am and were seated shortly. We ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken on top of the Spinach Scramble which also had Biscuits and Gravy. Somewhere in there were slabs of bacon and a whole bunch of country potatoes. zOMG! 

I loved how, although the fried chicken was so large, it was juicy and tender and not at all dried out. The eggs were kind of overwhelming, but I love eggs. The biscuits were a little dense and dry, but the fatty and gluttonous gravy helped solve that issue. Every part of that platter was enjoyable. Three adults split that one entree and we barely cleaned it off.

Service was somewhat slow, as our server was conveniently missing in action, while we saw all the other servers zipping by constantly. The line to get a table was pretty long by the time we left. One grip [hence the 4 stars and not 5], was the fact that there was a $2.50 splitting fee. In encouraging each person to perform their own personal episode of Man vs Food, they've enforced a fee on top of splitting the food.

The one way you can waive that splitting fee is by ordering a side: a side of fruit, some bacon, biscuits, or even, yes you guessed it, a bowl of country gravy. We chose that ;D

Even the kids' meal sizes are large. Everything food related here is large! And tasty. 

I will likely make this place a tradition - really like the food and can't wait to try all the other tasty items.

I generally frequent the Sahara location (as I did this time) but have been to the other locations inside the Plaza Hotel, Imperial Palace and the M Resort.  The Sahara location has by far the best service of all of the locations - the M Resort the WORST.

I think for the cost of the food and what you get that you can't beat it.  This morning - I opted for an Apples and Cinnamon pancake with a Cinnamon Roll Coffee.  The pancake was $7.95 and the coffee $5.25.  I'll admit - the coffee was a bit pricey but it tasted DAMN good, however, if you're not careful - you might end up doing a You Tube cinnamon challenge by mistake because they shake a LOT of cinnamon on top of the whipped cream :)  -- (note to self for the next time).
The pancake was great.  It wasn't too heavy and it was filled with slices of fresh apples.  I brought half of it home.

My dining partners ordered the Tractor Combo - with a mango coconut pancake, eggs and .. $11.95 while the other ordered a Big Easy breakfast, eggs, potatoes, sausage and bread.  I'm not sure the price.

Went here once with my girlfriend awhile back.  We both mistakenly ordered two of the scrambles that were on the specials menu.  We were not impressed at all..  I'm glad we gave it a second chance..

We ordered two items and split them.  

The first was the French Toast.  It was delicious!  There was nothing simple about this dish.  It is dipped in a banana cream batter.  And topped with fried bananas.  If you don't like bananas, avoid this.  They put the maple syrup on prior to serving, which is fine because it would just make the french toast soggy.  The banana batter helps to keep the french toast from being dry.  

We also ordered the fried chicken benedict.  This was great as well.  It's a little messy, but every ingredient was good.  I did not see anything spectacular about the fried part of the chicken.  Not much seasoning in the batter.  But the chicken itself was moist and flavorful.  I would prefer other egg options than just scrambled in this dish.

Overall, the food we ordered was great!  And surprisingly, we ate most of these large portions.  The service was also good for us.

This was one of a few restaurants that I would see featured on food shows and bookmark on Yelp to try whenever I'm in the area. 

I wish I heeded fellow yelpers advice about the ginormous portions at Hash House. My bf and I were hungry so we decided to get the sage infused chicken & waffles AND the hot granola with fruit to share. Our jaws dropped at the enormity of the dishes when it came to the table. It was enough to fees 2 more people.

The sage infused chicken and waffles was amazing. The chicken is so crisp, light and tasty. The waffles were a plenty and had strips of bacon baked inside them. My fave part of the dish was the deep fried green onion shavings. Ingenious touch - complimenting taste and excellent texture. My only (minor) issue with the dish is that I prefer my waffles a darker golden brown and crispy but it was still damn good.

The hot granola with fruit was nothing close to what I had expected. I ordered it thinking it would be a nice healthy compliment to the chicken and waffle dish but i was wrong. I can best describe it as sweet, gooey goodness with berries and sliced peaches mixed into it. It was also topped with big sliced of bananas, strawberries, watermelon, etc. It was really good but so bad for you. I felt like eating the whole bowl would give me enough energy to run a full marathon. I LOVED it but it's definitely something that needs to be shared with 2-3 people.

When looking at the picture this place for me seem like ""comfort food"" with a twist. When we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. The hostess quickly seated us. The menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. Our server according to our receipt was Jay. He quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. Our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. For Hash House A Go Go ""big portions"" is a complete and total understatement. WARNING this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! This is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. 

Now, let's move onto the food quality. We had a total of four dishes the first  is the Hash House Meat Loaf Pasta. It had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. This pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since I went to Italy. Pasta in the United States is unable to compete with it. The Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs was amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The ribs are braised with a house soy BBQ sauce and served with mashed potatoes. The ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.The potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. The Kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. Reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. It took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. The last dish was the Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger. We had the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. The prices were a little higher than I usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. The presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).

Highly Recommend the Kokokmo and Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs. So if you are planning to eat here Get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!",9quoE4bUcVKbnqTLCaZNzg,36,31,4,jzMx1r3X2s8qXg4LKknuGw

Most things that are over hyped usually suck like the Crapple iphone and Verizon's I CAN'T hear you now network. Also, In-N-Out... It's good, but not crack like most people say it is.. (I don't endorse or use crack). Even though, I tried to come here without the high expectations, it was unavoidable. I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. First off I am not a idiot! A lot of the bad reviews I read were from people that waited 2 hours and didn't like their food. I'm sorry, but if you waited 2 hours to eat anywhere I would be bitter too! I only waited 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes max, so suck on that! Haha. I went on a weekday around 9am. Brilliant!!!!

I know the portions are big, but how's the quality? Did you finish dish by yourself? I don't like pigging out should I still go?

The key is bring a friend and share. The quality is good! Don't expect a 5 star restaurant or a new cuisine from a top chef. This is simple breakfast food on steroids. I highly recommend having 2 stomachs and consulting with a doctor before coming here. To my surprise the customer base was a lot smaller than I expected. The restaurant was packed shortly after I arrived, but there were no Plus sized models here. I saw some normal sized patrons and a few gorgeous model types. I really was set on trying the Sage Chicken Benedict, but since my friend was not a fan of hollandaise sauce I went with the Chicken and Waffles of course! Let's just say Roscoe's has nothing on Hash House! I thought Roscoe's clogged arteries, but Hash made Roscoe's look like a Diet Soda verses a Milk Shake. The Chicken was very juicy and extremely crispy! I really like the corn flake batter, although the spices were a bit lacking, but nothing hot sauce can't fix. The chicken cannot beat Roscoe's, but that's not a fair comparison. You definitely get 4 times the food of Roscoe's for the same price. I am very picky Fried Chicken eater, so I wish they would find some Grandma's secret recipe for Chicken so this dish could become 10 instead of a 7. The waffles with bacon inside.... Wow. A tear came to my eyes... you had me at bacon. I thought that waffles couldn't be any better, but you took my fork away! If I was lucky enough to have the genetics of Brad Pitt or LL Cool J, I would eat these waffles everyday.

Should you try Hash House a Go Go? YES! Unfortunately, I only have one stomach and I could not finish half of a dish by myself. If you are a picky eater, you may want to take your snobby as$ else where. If you are a huge breakfast fan, like me, give Hash a try. Bring a huge appetite and go early. Note to self, don't order the large Orange Juice next time, it was so large I did not finish it. Fresh OJ with out much water, it was like trying to drink a huge carton of concentrate. I will go for a tasty small next time. Stop staring at the pictures and go try it already!!! COME Onnnnnn. :)",tHjAg9Fy3TUB564rKBn0bw,6,3,4,Ei61fdON367iiG11v5Fq_w

We ordered the specials and I thought maybe the portions would be smaller than the regular orders but they were still filling, fit for 2-3 people! Omelettes are ultra tasty and so are the potatoes!

The IP was really under construction at the time... it made me pretty nervous walking through.  & it took me a while to find this place... but wow.  When we did find it, diamond in the rough.

We dropped in for a breakfast/brunch after a crazy night.  Lots of kids and families.  Loud.  Luckily, there wasn't too much of a wait.  We were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting.

Great service, the waiter was super attentive.  I love a bloody mary & this was one of the best that I've had.  Just the right amount of spice to clear up the massive hangover.  Their juices are great... freshly made, or so I was told.

I had the sage chicken... it was insane.  Huge dish.  Perfectly crispy & the sage was intense but surprisingly good.

In my true fashion, I typed in ""awesome brunch"" into the Yelp search bar and ""Hash House"" popped up. To be perfectly honest with you all, we choose this place based on the silly name. Any place with ""a Go Go"" at the end of it's title is right up my alley. 

Not only was i impressed with the menu itself, but the portions are friggen huge! I tried the salmon hash, which was delicious and the corned beef hash. I prefer the corned beef and the GIANT slice of watermelon that comes out with your meal is pretty awesome too. So if you're in the mood for huge pile of awesome breakfast food, head to Hash House

The restaurant has a classic vibe to it, and the service was nice okay, they didn't refill our drinks, until we flagged the waitress down and asked for refills.

The food here is good, unhealthy... But very tasty lol. The start you off with honey biscuits that are really good, but in my opinion too big.

For the entree I got the corned beef hash and my girlfriend got the fried chicken Benedict. The corned beef hash was good! But be prepared for a mountain of potatoes on the side. I liked the fried chicken Benedict more, it was soooo good.

Now as you probably already know..the food portions are not for the weak or sorta hungry people...you better be friggin starving cause you have no business being in a place like this! If you share a meal they will charge you about $3 or $4 to split. A tip..if you're gonna order a side salad (btw anything ""side"" here is a full order of fatness) or a side of mashed potatoes or even just the biscuits, then they won't charge you the split fee. When we had breakfast, the nice waitress recommended I get the biscuits which were only $2.95 so that I didn't get charged that dumb fee. By the way, the biscuits are yummy and the fresh made jam of the day (we had peach but I got to try strawberry at dinner) just complimented that goodness. Ok on to breakfast...my boo ordered a spicy bloody maria to start..their version of a bloody mary but with an extra kick and I had a mojito...both were liquid delights and both gave us that nice buzz to prepare us for the Behemoth of Behemoths Chicken and Waffles!! It's a monster RRAAAAAHHHH!!...2 pieces of a breaded then fried chicken along side a stack of not 1, not 2, but 4 bacon stuffed (yep bacon stuffed) waffles. A steak knife is stabbed literally thru the middle of this Mount Fiji of wonder. The syrup is a sweet and yummy and the waffles are dee-lish. The chicken could be a tad less dry and they were a little bland but everything else on the plate was fatty already so I overlooked this. I guess we felt like we didn't get enough cholesterol running thru our arteries, so we headed back for dinner! Yay!  This time we shared the pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes. No need for sides so we just took the split charge fee. My daughter ordered the ""kids"" burger. Ok...the plate that held this Shamu of  a pork tenderloin  was literally about 2 feet wide! No jokes..this plate probably weighed almost 10 pounds!  The pork tenderloin was pounded thin, breaded and fried to a crispy goodness and laid atop a mound of bacon cheese mashed potatoes. There was some cool fried thin spaghetti pasta decorating on top of this that was actually edible......yeah go big or go home I say! My daughter's burger was definitely not kid size..no surprise here..and it was juicy and lovely. AHHHHHHHHHHH.....Hash house...my food memories of you will always haunt my dreams..I don't know if I consider you a good dream or a great nightmare.

3122609,2010-07-18,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Was on another Vegas adventure and wanted to meet up with some friends for lunch.  They said, ""Let's go to Hash House."" Of course, I am not one to say no to a place I've never heard of, so we went. :] 

When we arrived during the lunch hours on that hot July Saturday, they said it would take up to 45 minutes for four people to be seated. RIDICULOUS! But, I was told it was worth the wait.  About a half hour later, we were seated and the menu was... insane.  I honestly had no idea what to select because everything sounded so...heavy.  I decided to go with one of their Saturday lunch specials - the Fisherman's Lunch.  It was a calamari steak sandwich and seafood sounded much lighter than double patties or chicken wrapped in eggs wrapped in only they know what!

When the food arrived, I was in shock.  The servings are HUGEEEE.  I would recommend that people who are faint of heart to try and split something with another person.  Not a single person at my table cleaned off their entire plate; there was just too much!

The calamari steak was DELICIOUS.  I've never had anything like it before and it tasted WONDERFUL! The only problem was that the sandwich was so huge I had to take it apart just to eat it...which ended up being messy and leaving me with a calamari steak salad with very fresh croutons. :] As good as it tasted, I could not finish the entire plate! I even came in quite hungry! 

Additionally, I had a taste of Andy N.'s chicken and I must admit... that was some pretty damn good chicken.

Our server was a bit...eh. Nothing too exciting there.  He wasn't terrible, but he wasn't spectacular either.

Overall, GREAT FOOD with HUGE PORTIONS! They have so many twists to classic favorites, and it's an adventure for you mouth! (Who wouldn't love that?) It's definitely a place to try out, and I'll definitely be heading back another time to tackle (try to tackle) something else! :]

The ingredients they choose for each dish comes together very nicely and the flavors meld into each other in the final dish they present at your table.  They use fresh ingredients and you can definitely taste it in their dishes.  

The wait is at least 30 min, so be ready to feed them meters with your  quarters you collected this past week to do your laundry.  The consolation is that they have freshly brewed coffee for you to drink while you wait.

The menu is out of this world and the presentation just blows your mind...it's the quantity that makes one miserable because you feel that you must clean your plate (and because you don't want to waste anything).  

I grabbed the crispy salmon with BBQ drizzle on a bed or garlic mashed...it wad incredible.

Good thing the entire table shared a single dessert of banana, peanut butter cheese cake!  Remnants would also end up in the trash bin once we left....LARGE portions!

Come hungry and don't bother with selecting an appetizer.... By the time you finish one home-made biscuit and maybe half of your appetizer, there is no room for a main course....seriously.",EWQil1sWe23p9uoEU5AZlg,1,1,4,66C1oN20EKq0DTbSFYclBw

Rather than drive all the way across town we opted to visit the one a little closer to us.

My girlfriends review is right below mine. Her name is Karen. Although it is very detailed and accurate. I'll add a few things. 

She gave it four stars so apparently she was a little more impressed than I was.

We each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu. Both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty. I do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool.

I felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed. Strange as this is the same complaint I had about the one I visited yesterday.


I ordered the blackened chicken and she ordered the pot pie. As usual the portions are humongous. 

Both items arrived piping hot. All of this is good but again I found the food to be only satisfactory. It'll definitely fill you up and it was tasty enough. The presentation is terrific. ....... but again I just don't fell the urge to have to visit this place again.

I'd recommend other places before recommending this place.

The check was around $60.00..

Again we had a overall satisfactory experience. Good and hot food. Friendly staff. Clean environment.

Something just keeps me from giving this place more than 3 stars.",tL2pS5UOmN6aAOi3Z-qFGg,2,0,3,SyvB9pp9Na0sQevs26Dq3Q

When you order here, keep in mind most dishes can feed two people. On the other hand, our dish came ""served with fresh fruit"", which turned out to be only two pieces of fruit. The rest of our food was plentiful, though. And all of it was so fresh and so delicious! I loved that my side of fresh fruit ( I ordered extra because I wanted more than the two pieces) wasn't the ordinary grapes, etc. you'll find at most places. No, here you get fresh pineapple, huge orange slices, strawberries and such that have all been ripened to perfection. :D

3168536,2015-09-12,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This was my third time visiting Hash House and the 3rd location I've seen. This particular location was off the strip and the outside looks similar to the one I went to near San Diego. Since there is one directly on the strip in a casino, this location appears to be frequented by more locals instead and less obnoxiously crowded. No need to wait over an hour or so for a table which means we were in and out of there before trekking back to Phoenix in 40 minutes total!

The service was awesome and quick! We especially loved our waitress Izzy! The waiters and waitresses were on top of ""question and answer"" sessions with newcomers. Although there was only my hubs and I at our table, there was a group of 8 next to us with one cranky customer. Despite the customer being unreasonable, their waiter handled the situation with such finesse and ease that it really wasn't such a problem anymore. Whew! Mini crisis averted!

Our food was predictably good. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken with bacon stuffed waffles while Bry ordered the corned beef hash skillet. From the pictures I uploaded, one could tell that these dishes were mighty and grand in stature and had the flavor to match! Anyone who's ""hangry"" can appreciate how this food can quickly cure and almost overwhelm what you thought would be an insatiable hunger.

The chicken itself is good but the batter could actually use more seasoning or some form of Louisiana/Crystal hot sauce to complement it. The crispy leeks are amazing though and I would definitely ask for extra because they are so flavorful. 

Portions are ridiculous, in a good way. Could easily share a plate of chicken and waffles with someone else. Though I did see a guy down the entire plate like a champ one table over.

How I sooooo wanted to like this place, but alas... it was not meant to be. The portions are huge, everything LOOKS delicious, but the TASTE of the food itself?? Soooo bland. I ordered the house smoked salmon hash with cream cheese and scallions. My hubby ordered the sage fried chicken with bacon waffles. Everything looked amazing when it came out. Then we tasted the food, then we salted and peppered... and salted and peppered again... then salted again... and salted a little more. Then the food became alright... just alright. Darn! My son ordered the french toast and ate it all, so maybe that's a hopeful sign... although he is into pretty bland foods so I'm not sure. The one highlight was the caramel mocha. That was delicious - thick with whipped cream and heavy with mocha flavor! Yummy!

3190446,2010-11-11,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"One of my favorite places to breakfast on the weekends in my hometown of San Diego is Hash House a Go-Go (or just plain Hash House to locals). Being in Las Vegas and knowing that Sin City has its very own Hash House (three in fact), there was no way I was going to miss a taste of home.

Arriving at a time that would cause a 45 to 90 minute wait at the San Diego location, I was surprised to be told that I would be seated in between 15 and 20 minutes. Happily taking my pager, I shuffled off to wait and in due course was buzzed.

Setting my sights on a ""Campfire s'mores"" mocha ($7) which arrived in an over-sized cup (visibly cracked as seen in the picture) topped with gooey, charred marshmallows, chocolate syrup and Graham crackers.

The first spoonful was thick with marshmallowy goodness and its smokey, crunchy crust brought me immediately back to childhood outings in the woods by the campfire, roasting s'mores with family and friends. If the coffee itself had been better, this mocha would have been perfect but it falls just short of the mark.

Having had many of the offerings on the standard menu over the years, I decided I'd order one of the brunch specials. The Nappanee hash ($14.95) with fresh tomatoes, green beans, marinated steak, smoked mozzarella and crispy potatoes was ordered and anticipated.

Things began going pear shaped when I asked my server If I could add fresh roasted corn (available in the other brunch offering), to my hash and was told ""the Chef can't guarantee the flavor profile if changes are made so we don't allow substitutions or additions."" FAIL!

In due course my server arrived clutching a medium sized cast iron skillet in a heavy oven mitt. What a great idea, the cast iron would keep my food hot and steamy while I enjoyed it...WRONG! The skillet seems to have been used solely for presentation and not preparation, it was stone cold and after a bite, I realized temperature of my meal was not far off. FAIL!

The ""marinated steak"" was a perfectly cooked medium but lacked flavor. The green beans, which I felt were a strange choice for a breakfast dish, were a bit too al dente and the whole skillet lacked seasoning. 

Curiously, the server pointed out the days freshly made strawberry citrus jam and asked if I would like butter to go with it and my buttermilk biscuit to which I replied ""yes,"" but somehow said butter never materialized. FAIL!

In all the meal was mediocre, there were several opportunities to meet or exceed expectations but none were taken advantage of.   The server could have noticed the large, clearly visible crack in my coffee mug,  If cast iron was to be used for presentation only, there's no reason it couldn't have been warmed so as to keep its contents at the desired temperature and  finally, when asked to add roasted corn to the dish, the server could have suggested i have it on the side instead of basically telling me the Chef understands my palate better than I do.

I have a warm place in my heart for Hash House a Go Go and have recommended breakfast/brunch there to many friends and acquaintances alike, I can only hope that this particular meal was an aberration.",lEMMAksnmSoMKvb6oY7N8w,0,0,2,hgf_PDHODzvFgtrldHAkHw

Food so I expected it to be absolutely fantastic. But it wasn't, it was just...ordinary. Which makes me sad. Maybe I shouldn't have got the scramble, it was just boring and plain, there was no kick to it or anything that made it special. I tried a friends 'Andy's Fried Chicken and Eggs Benedict' and it was also just boring tasting to me. 

The portions are huge though, if you are staying at a hotel I would recommend sharing a plate, because you won't have anywhere to put your leftovers. I MAYBE finished half of my food. They do charge a split-plate charge, which is just absolutely ridiculous to me. They should offer lower portions sizes at lower prices, but that's just my opinion. 

Also our server was kind of rude. We went with a group of 8 and she brought out one bill. When we told her we needed the bills seperated she got all pissy. Why would you just expect a group of young adults to pay one bill? Give me a break lady.",-hqKOOH-v6CeKIEOdgjK-g,1,2,3,MIbycqSpf2Mcik7PA9m6sA

We had to speed there from our friend's house since they stop serving on Sundays at 2:30pm, but thankfully we made it in time.  They serve ""twisted farm food"" and plenty of it.  Their menu is filled with plenty of heavy meat, eggs and potato dishes.  The kind of food you want to eat a lot of and then take a nap.  They have various brunch food including hash dishes, scrambles, flapjacks, French toast, waffles, stuffed burgers, sandwiches, salads and benedicts, as well as a section titled ""Indiana Favorites"".  Being from Indiana, I knew I'd love this place once I saw that.

I decided on the ""Tractors Driver Combo"", which includes 2 eggs with bacon, sausage or potatoes and flapjacks, waffle or griddled French toast.  Since half the items on the menu feature bacon, I decided to get that as the side.  I had to get the griddled French toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The eggs and bacon were good, but the star of the dish was definitely the French toast.  2 pieces of fluffy French toast with pecan maple syrup, whole pecans and a cooked banana sliced in half lengthwise.  Amazing.  Possibly the best French toast I've had.  Maybe not the best thing to eat before having to drive 5 hours since I just wanted to sleep afterwards, but worth it nonetheless.  

A couple of interesting dishes on the brunch menu are the ""O'Hare of the dog"", which is a 24 ounce Budweiser with a side of bacon and the chicken and waffles, which unfortunately didn't look as good as chicken and waffles from Roscoe's in LA, but did include a full piece of bacon cooked into each waffle.

The atmosphere was very cool, kind of hip and kind of country, and the service was adequate.  The prices were reasonable, given that you get big plates of food.  I think our bill for 4 people came out to around $80 or so.  In addition to the great food, they were playing a very interesting mix of music.  From REM to Notorious B.I.G. to Sting to the Beatles to Gwen Stefani to Justin Timberlake to Elvis Costello.

It's a more corporate take on a fun place like Jacque-imo's in New Orleans.... in that... it's a local joint with lots of leeway for the waitstaff to be themselves. Good music and a great vibe. It was so refreshing to see men and women of unconventional beauty having fun with their clothes for work. One server looked just like Frieda Kahlo (on purpose) and our server looked straight out of a 50s car hop. The restaurant as a whole, is a feast for the eyes.

And a feast for the stomach too. The portions here are HUGE. I mean... it's like circus freak show huge. I think it's a gimmick and I'm horrified at how much waste must be created each day here.... but the WOW factor when the dish arrives at your table is undeniable.

Quality of the food is very good. It's a cut above your average breakfast restaurant and the menu items are creative and fun. A little hung over from last night's party? No problem. Order the menu item that is basically a very large beer and a side of bacon.

My first breakfast here was bread pudding (Snicker flavor) with ice cream and a cup of coffee. I'll post a pic on Yelp.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,0,0,4,YOYK__H0H5AOVd_LRdRYEg

We saw maybe 4 front of house employees total. We ordered our drinks, mine a tangerine mimosa and someone else ordered a Bloody Mary. No bartender, so our server, who was very nice, went behind the bar to make our drinks. After looking at the menu I was so excited! So many delicious sounding items. It took me forever to decide. I went with the skillet chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Other plates ordered were the meatloaf sandwich and a sausage pot pie of some sort that was running as a special. We also ordered a cheeseburger from the kids menu. Our food arrived and everything looked phenomenal. Absolutely mouth watering to look at. The flavor, not so much. My chicken was doused in maple syrup, which wasn't listed on the menu description, the pot pie was terrible and the cheese in the meatloaf sandwich was burnt. The only tasty things were the kids burger and biscuits. That's it. I've never dined somewhere and had to send all 3 plates back. And when the manager came over, he didn't even know that the menu didn't list maple syrup under the description of the chicken!! He's a manager and doesn't know the menu?!?! That's scary. The whole experience was a huge disappointment and I have no plans to ever go back. 2 stars because the staff were all pretty attentive and nice. The manager needs a bit more product knowledge, but he was helpful and understanding. Maybe breakfast items might be better. Good luck!",kI4CXqRmDLD06dG2xD5Vuw,0,0,2,yf1IPUddoA-Qtkc5OkprOQ

What I do know this HH is style over substance. Huge massive portions that are impressive in looks but lame on flavor. I mean the food doesn't really taste that good. So why do I keep coming back  if I don't like the place? Easy, out of town visitors. They've all heard about the place with food bigger than you're head. I can't say I don't warn them that it's not very good but hey, what do I know? 

What annoys me most about HH, the fried spaghetti and rosemary they stab and litter every plate with. I know its their signature but having to remove all the inedible bits from my plate is pretty lame. If it's not edible don't put it on the plate. 

A few highlights from our last visit.

Traditional Buttermilk Flapjack - bigger than your head, thick, fluffy pancake. Nothing particularly special aside from the sheer size. We had this as a brunch appetizer and had a hard time finishing it. 

The Kokomo - huge meatloaf sandwich that was on the dry side. To be fair I grew up on moms meatloaf and trust me seldom any live up to her sweet juicy meat slab. I think the chief problem with the Kokomo is that the bread to meat ratio is way off. To much bread. 

Andy's sage fried chicken - very disappointing. The chicken while under seasoned was covered in a thick glaze of maple syrup reduction which just tasted weird to us. Unfortunately the reduction was also on the eggs and the bacon. I think if I were to order this again it would be with plain maple syrup on the side. That way I can control the sweet to savory ratio.

With all of that said of course Ill be coming back with out-of-towners. The look on their faces when the food comes out is so worth it.",p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,5,3,3,VyAWLVNOSBOdWnoKkJxzYA

The Pork Tenderloin Sandwich was as large as a 1956 Oldsmobile hubcap. The outside was crispy and inside very tender and juicy. Unless you want a second meal, I suggest that 2 people share one order. 
The Meatloaf meal consists of a large layer of mashed potatoes topped by 2 country biscuits followed by a slab of meatloaf and finely covered with crispy onion straws. Way far too much starch for me. The meatloaf was a little on the dry side and could have used some gravy.

My coworker and I ordered a glass of prosecco and a water. It took at least ten minutes just to get our water, and over a half hour to get our glass of prosecco.
When we got our waters we did not have any straws, so when we asked one of the buss boys for a straw he quickly replied ""that's not my job, I'll get your server"" and ran off. Of course, our server did not come back and we ended up forgoing the straws.
The menu is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (I did not pick this place, someone in our organization did). I ended up ordering a portobello sandwich (without the bread) hoping that it would be palatable. I assumed wrong.
The portobello was greasy and oily. It tasted almost like someone tried to fry it. My coworker ordered the chicken and waffles with sugar free syrup. The dish she got had the syrup on it, and it was not sugar free. She's diabetic so she could not eat the dish. When she finally got ahold of our very inattentive server to ask her for a new plate with sugar free syrup the server snapped back at her ""it's already being fixed!"" grabbed her plate and walked away briskly. She was hands down the rudest server I have ever encountered, she should not be working front of house anywhere. She clearly is not a people person.

However, the portion sizes, visually impressive as they are, are pretty much the sum total of what is wrong with us in America.  They're like an all-you-can-eat buffet in one dish. The problem with that is: A) you don't have a choice of how much to take and I guarantee you can't reasonably eat much more than half of it, and B) you don't really want to take it home because it's just not that awesome tasting.

The flavors are surprisingly blah, considering the descriptions. It's easy to understand why, when you see the sizes and you realize that not all that much care could possibly go into a dish of that size.

But, I still really liked the place.  Kind of like everything else in Vegas, it's a fun place to visit but you don't want to stay too long!",EausF6jhqnliWRtd0N6UPw,1,1,3,MOCN-xKjGwp-pahEyCEQsw

We arrived on a Sunday after a few friends had run in the Las Vegas marathon.  I didn't run, but had been up early to cheer on friends after a long night at the clubs, therefore, arriving tired and hung over.  We were all hungry, and it was getting too cold to wait outside, but as the place is filled with people waiting for food, they put tables throughout the bar, making almost no indoor waiting area, which is odd as Las Vegas weather is too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter to comfortably wait outside.  But, since we were there we waited....and waited.  Managing to finally maneuver to the bar, my friend got herself a Bloody Mary, which was impressive and looked more like a meal. When we did actually get a table, three different staff members asked if our whole party was there....kind of annoying to have to tell them three times that they were taking care of the bar tab and would be right over.  I really did enjoy the food...but such a long wait does work up an appetite.  I had the Salmon Benedict.  The portion was huge and it was colorful.  Really, I would have like a bit smaller portions, as I'm not sure whoever could finish these, as those who ran the marathon could not.  My friend had hot cocoa with marshmallows which was really cute.

I tried the vaunted sage fried chicken with maple syrup reduction. I asked the waiter to serve the syrup separately and am I glad I did. The chicken itself was too crusted and greasy. Juicy enough, but otherwise flavorless. I tried a forkful of meat dipped into the syrup and it turned out cloyingly sweet. So I ate the rest of the meat with a little pepper and ketchup. 

I did have some leftovers for a small, late lunch while I traipsed around the rest of Vegas, so I guess that is a positive as well.

Although it wasn't the best Hash House experience we have had. Food and service-wise it doesn't really live up to the San Diego Location. Generally thought the food was a little more bland (although still good and still giant portions) iced coffee tastes suuuppper watered down (like it was hot coffee over ice, although I can't say that is actually what it was. Just what it reminded me of). Waitress seemed annoyed generally by us and wasn't afraid to say so (although we tried to be polite and friendly as most of us have worked in restaurants before). Also, no soap in the men's bathroom which is pretty gross (since ya know, employees most likely use it as well).

All-in-all is was totally fine. We left not being hungry anymore and got to have a decent breakfast together.",O-fas1ZYR_e2lmsCKKFd8A,0,0,3,XwLE6p9tPN8twAUgKtY0kA

The food was Hash which are skillet fried potatoes and you pick what topping you want. I had the HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella not bad the meatloaf was not my favorite. The plates also came with 2 eggs, and a big biscuit. Very large portions did not eat it all. 

My partner had Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese that was very good the corned beef was great. Also very large serving.

The first time I tried to line up here, they said it would be a 1.5 hour long wait.  Good thing we decided to go elsewhere because if I waited 1.5 hours to eat Hash House, I would have been even more upset.

The second time I came back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Outside, you see pictures of celebrities that have eaten at Hash House.  The main reason I decided to visit Hash House was because of the raving reviews Adam Richman gave on Man vs. Food.  Adam, your credibility is seriously on thin ice with me after my experience here.

Hash House is located inside the Imperial Palace hotel along the strip.  Is it just me or does this place feel cold and unclean?  

Service here was also iffy.  It took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full.  She also disappeared at the end of our meal after she dropped off our check.  Then, she charged us an extra $2.50 for a split plate!  Ridiculous.  If I could give a negative star on service, I would.

Hash House is all presentation.  Their dishes come out looking massive!  Andrew D. and I ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I was SERIOUSLY disappointed.  Eggs benedict is my FAVORITE breakfast meal, but the dish SERIOUSLY lacked flavor and kick.  I was waiting for my taste buds to be stimulated, but alas, it was bland.  I ended up having to season the thing to the best of my ability with the tabasco sauce, ketchup and black peppers we had at the table.

Our whole group left feeling unsatisfied and a little bitter for having to waste our money on this place.  IIII felt bad also for making the group come back not ONCE, but TWICE to give it a try.

Our server was most helpful, she described how they did things around there: fresh and quality ingredients, super large portions served on platters, and the trick to avoiding the ""share charge."" The food is too much for one person, so if you share without the other person ordering at least a side, they charge an extra $2.50. Still worth it despite that stipulation.

The flapjcks can be split between a family of four and cut like a pizza, its ridiculous. The smoked salmon hash is the way to go, its an overwhelming first bite. Their house made strawberry jam is delicious on their biscuits.

Its larger than the San Diego location, so luckily on a Friday morning my party of five did not have to wait at all.

They call it ""Twisted Farm Food.""  I call it ""Mutant Meals.""  Everything is so out of proportion that you would swear it was injected with steroids.  My son ordered the fried chicken and waffle combo.  My wife and I had the Banana-Cinnamon waffle with grilled mash potatoes (our ten year old daughter opted for a bowl of Frosted Flakes--oh well). We really enjoyed our fare.  The pancake was outstanding and the grilled mashed very good.  Needless to say, we couldn't finish it (just barely half).  My son ate most of his chicken and waffle duo but said the chicken was dry.

The service is very friendly but not very swift (they make everything to order and it is quite likely that the size of the portions restricts what they can cook at one time.)  We liked the atmosphere and would definitely go back.

Right off the bat, I knew we were going to experience something special when I saw the huge portions the servers were carrying out.  Think of the silver trays at Chipotle and imagine that it was turned into an oval shape and made of china instead of aluminum.  That's how big these were.  Our lunch companions were smart and decided to share betweens the couples but wanting to try different things, my husband and I decided to order separately.  I had the sage fried chicken eggs benedict which was the size of my entire head and my husband ordered their famous chicken and waffles.  

Although the portions were huge, my eggs were cooked perfectly so I was assured that quality was not overlooked for quantity.  My husband's bacon waffles were amazing.  And when I say bacon waffles, I mean bacon that is inside the waffles which has got to win some sort of award for just existing!

I'm allergic to watermelon so I wasn't able to try the watermelon lemonades but everyone raved about theirs!

That's about it.  Andy's Sage Chicken with Waffles was bland (3 stars, at least it fed 2 people!).  The Boston Hash (crabcakes with hash) rated 4 stars because the salsa was divine and the lump crab did taste fresh.

Busy even on a Monday morning.  The servers were very helpful and steered us towards ordering any of their benedict plates (what HHAGG is known for).  Excellent coffee service, my cup was always topped off.

The fresh strawberry preserve that is available on all tables is worth a taste (3 stars).  The apple juice was fresh and unsweetened (tasted yummy!) but their milk container had a piece of splenda wrapper floating in it.  Ewww ... that alone should give them a rating of 1 star.  Plus, there are no teaspoons or stirrers so how the heck do I mix my coffee?

Rather than doing our usual brunch buffet at the Wynn or other casinos, we opted to get Hash House. I wanted to go to this location off the strip because the wait isn't as long (I get very angry when I'm hungry. The snickers bar commercials where ppl turn into crazy angry hungry monsters definitely applies to me haha). ALSO after we left, we met BJ PENN & GOT A PHOTO W/ HIM!!! :D Being a girl that's into MMA, I was so happy.

There's patio seating outside for those that want to get your tan on in the nevada sun, but we opted for indoor seating. The service was very friendly, no complaints there

FOOD:

Mushroom, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke scrambled egg white hash & ordered extra side of ham steak - What can I say? I'm a petite girl w/ a big appetite. I devoured this whole cast iron plated meal except for a few pieces of potatoes. You seriously get enough potato wedges to last for days here. Everything was cooked perfectly. Eggs weren't overcooked. There were plenty of mushroom, spinach, etc. The biscuit was warm and flaky, I doused it in butter and honey. I was in heaven! The ham steak was huge, but good and not super salty

Chicken Pot Pie - My friend ordered this dish & I helped him out a little 'cause I was still hungry after eating my dish LOL. I loved how this wasn't just ordinary chicken pot pie. It's served in a cute giant hat w/ gravy oozing everywhere. Dish came out piping hot and fresh! There were plenty of chicken breast pieces throughout each bite and yes...loads of potato wedges. I really like the gravy here, everything tasted so home made. I'd recommend this dish over the fried chicken biscuit benedict

Andy's Fried Chicken Biscuit Benedict - 2 of our friends ordered this and it was just ok to me. I know it's a popular item, but it really did just taste like fried chicken w/ biscuits...nothing too special. At least the fried chicken wasn't too greasy

Watermelon lemonade - IT LOOKED SO AWESOME!! check out my pic http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0Eh9jlsKXJIN8N9CuLnIsQ/ms.jpg
Tasted really refreshing and not super sweet. The watermelon wasn't overpowering either.

Caramel Coffee w/ scoop of vanilla ice cream - So my friend ordered this cause we had serendipity the night before. This basically tasted like any other frappe, but great palate cleanser for all that food!

I love the big portions at hash house and the pricing is just right for what you get!! I know they have one back home in CA,but it's all the way in SD :( They're expanding like crazy in vegas, how about building one in Orange County?!",u6Rb0yrjDvYpAFOgXL8WXQ,10,7,5,4O446IYdmVK6DBv_OAfxqA

After hearing all the great reviews, I was dying to try it on my Las Vegas trip. Definately, the place to go when you are famished.  We were so impressed, that we were taking pictures of the food. 

So go try it.   Open 7 days a week, breakfast thru dinner.  And I can't wait until next trip to try breakfast.  They have a Tractor Driver Combo if that tells you anything. I think it's two of everything.

Just so you know, Hash House A Go Go, is casual, loud and super busy, but, a large restaurant.  It was no problem for us and were still seated right away.  Great bar.  I ordered a martini, which I seemed to spill immediately.  One waiter brought another right away, as the poor bus boy cleaned my mess. What a way to start the evening!

Another kudos to the manager.  She didn't like the way my entree looked, so she sent it back to be redone, and brought me a comp salad, big enough for two to share.  They were sure on top of things and I didn't mind the wait.

3400242,2013-05-09,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I actually like it here, but I'm not going crazy on the stars because I agree with the gist of some other reviews: the food is big, and the menu is interesting, but the food just doesn't taste as good as it sounds. There is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry mashed potatoes, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. There are dishes I enjoy- the sage fried chicken is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. What the hell? Same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). And how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? I'm a fan, but they went from supplying one Barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. For a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? Maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. You spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate.  The meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and Baby girl loves the salmon. The side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. I've never tried dessert, because I can't fathom ever getting that far, and I've been tempted to try  one of those giant burgers, but never do because I know I can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. Strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. Who can explain it? But the HH brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. Yes, I'll keep coming here to dine, but I will never again make the mistake of ordering the Thanksgiving dinner to go. The fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the Snickers bread pudding dessert wound up in the trash. Unprecedented. Oh, and the number one reason I will keep coming back? You can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon.

everyone at the table ordered a grab bag of dishes so everyone can share. portions were HUGE! pizza-sized pancakes, towering chicken n waffles, boulder-sized benedicts. 

i ordered the smoked salmon benedict... mehhhh. i guess i was expecting a traditional eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce, with some salmon. instead, i got a mashed potato-biscuit-salmon-eggs concoction served with a sriracha-esque sauce. i enjoyied my friends chicken n waffles much more.

We came here on a long road trip to Sundance/Slamdance film festival and piled into the booth with a caravan full of hungry crew members. Not a single meal was finished, and no that wasn't a lack of valiant effort. I actually shared my plate of food with 6 people and there were still left overs. The potatoes were creamy, the fried chicken was crisp, the sauce was decadent, the biscuit may have been the lightest part. 

Was it an experience everyone should have? Absolutely.  Will I order it again?? Probably not in this lifetime.

Fried chicken.. with bacon waffles.. drenched with syrup.  I get the same look from everyone when I describe this to them.  It's a cross between absolute revulsion and incredulity - that I LIKED it?!  Yeah, we don't have fried chicken and waffles up here - that's a new combo.  But damn, it was good. It's I'm-on-vacation-and-what-happens-in-Vegas-stays-in-Vegas good.

The green fried tomato is stacked up in a tower, layered with goat cheese.  I have no idea what this is supposed to taste like, but it was just like very firm warm tomatoes, with goat cheese & balsamic.  Not bad, but nothing exciting beyond its portion size.

The crab cakes are more like crab patties.  They are burger sized, the biggest crab cakes I've ever seen.  Taste-wise, nothing to write home about, but not bad in the traditional sense either.  There were decent amounts of real crab meat in there, not just filler.

The hammered pork tenderloin comes served in a plate that is the size of the table-width.  No joke.  It made for a great late night snack.

I really enjoyed the complimentary biscuits - big, buff and buttered with honey.  Just the way I (now) like them.  I had to exercise considerable restrain in eating just one.  

Arriving early enough on a Friday night at 6:30, we were able to get  a table right away.  The place was pretty packed by the time we left at 8:30.",N4_3LzKYZcLIBBjg2-0SAw,1,1,4,tjhpe56ri-Q9L047xfpeHg

It's been a long time since I've been to this spot (well before we moved to Vegas) but man, the difference between then and now was night and day.  I'll start by saying the bulk of this one star review is for the service, which was abominable.  Right after our food was dropped off, our waiter buzzed by  to see if we needed anything and that was it.  We didn't need anything at the time, but half way through our meal my wife and I would have both liked a drink refill and my wife wanted some butter or jam for her biscuit, which the restaurant offered up dry.  Despite several efforts to flag this guy (or anyone else) down, we were ignored.  He finally popped over once we were well done and had been waiting for the check for about 10 minutes, and asked ""do you need anything."" I said ""just the check at this point"" and, seeing I was pissed, he didn't even bother to ask how everything was. 

So how WAS the food? Well my wife had a salmon scramble, which was just ok.  It was supposed to have brie cheese in it, but she was given one extremely tiny blob of brie and that was it.  The rest was eggs and fish.  It came with the aforementioned dry biscuit (seriously who serves a dry biscuit when there is no gravy or sauce and provides no butter or jam) and some terrible home fry style potatoes (our waiter's recommendation for the best potatoes on offer).  I had the pounded pork sandwich with salad.  The salad was middling, with just about past its prime veggies and an overly sweet cucumber dressing.  The pork sandwich was good though, I've liked it in the past and liked it here. I also had the Hash House Bloody Mary, which was disgusting. Easily the worst bloody mary I've ever had. The bloody mary you get on an airplane, with the from-a-can spicy tomato juice and little bottle of booze is far superior. 

Overall, this was a terrible experience.  I doubt we'll ever be back.  I'm not sure what happened here - we liked this place a lot on our first few visits - but ugh.",76xS0Vin4uT25XKaxbsvmQ,9,2,1,22zNq1pZvc1fHsiw91h_0A

Location~ just a couple of miles off the strip in the Asian Market area.  The restaurant is very clean and inviting and easy to find.  It has a great ambiance that is family friendly. 

Food~ it's hard to choose from one of their many hash skillets if you're dining for breakfast or just feel like eating breakfast for dinner.

My friend had the bacon waffles which she said were okay. Not enough bacon - just two slices over four waffles - she said she had better elsewhere. I didn't even try them. I was too busy digging out the few pieces of sausage in the gravy! I don't even think I got through a third of it.

My friend's girlfriend said that this location is much bigger than the San Diego location.  The portions are huge, go hungry or be prepared to share.  If you do share, order a side because you'll be charged a plate splitting fee - this was suggested by our server - if I remember correctly, the splitting fee cost more than ordering a side.  He was one of the best servers I have experienced.  People are not kidding when they say the portions are huge.  I saw the pork tenderloin being served to someone, it seriously looked like the size of my head.

We went with the chicken and waffles with a side of bacon.  I guess we totally missed reading the description because inside the waffles there are whole slices of bacon!  The chicken was fried perfectly, but the maple sauce was just too sweet for my taste with the chicken, it's nice with the waffle though.  My friend and his girlfriend got this scramble (don't know the name) but it had avocado, bacon, and other stuff, it looked really good, I think that's what I'll order next time I go.

This I would understand if it was busy, or a weekend, or whatever - not a Wednesday morning when more than half the place is empty. So after waiting for our friends we go BACK up and get seated. I was getting the shakes by then bc I needed food so bad and just ordered and waited. Really couldn't care less about the place until I got my food. Ordered an Apple Juice for my drink and it was really good. It tasted like it was freshly pressed. The order came and yes, it was huge, but stop looking at the size people and realize that they put almost 2in high of mashed potatoes under EVERYTHING. Oh, and one thing I wasn't happy about, they don't list what is actually on/in the dish. They didn't mention that it had a type of salsa on top, or that it was on top of mashed potatoes.

I'm not a pig, but I get frustrated when you pay good money at a restaurant and you leave hungry. This will never happen to you here.

One thing I particularly enjoy about HHAGG is the excellent micro-brew choices they have. It's not a massive list, but it's an excellent, rotating list, and it complements a lot of the meals really well.

Anyway, I had a scramble the first time I was there. Their breakfast potatoes (crispy) are great. The eggs are the usual and I had sausage and spinach in my scramble. While I was eating I noticed this monstrosity of goodness going by me twice. I decided the next time I go here, I will eat this. 

It turns out, it was the dish that was featured on the Man Vs. Food show. It's the Andy's sage fried chicken benedict with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs This thing is monstrous. I, being a big dude, was able to finish it all because my friend challenged me to do so (prick). I was also hungover and wanted something to soak up all the booze from the night before. 

This thing was tasty and took quite a bit to eat. The only thing I would change, and which I will ask of next time I get this, is to have it with the crispy potatoes. I love mashed potatoes, but for breakfast I prefer the crunchy hash potato browns.

The service was great. The bartender was very attentive. She got everything out quick, made a damn good iced coffee, and I didn't have to worry about going empty. 

Another cool thing, I saw Dee Snider, lead singer of Twisted Sister, at the restaurant. Nice guy. Didn't bother him for a picture, but I did shake his hand.

3517642,2010-11-10,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"With all of their hype from their appearance on ""Man vs. Food"", Hash House A Go Go is always busy during peak dining hours, especially breakfast. Because of that I've always tried to avoid eating there. I finally gave in the other day and stopped by for dinner, even though they're not know for their post-breakfast foods.

We got there early and were seated right away, unfortunately at the crappiest table they had -- the table closest to the entrance and in a high-traffic area. We even asked the hostess if we could have a booth but she said she had to seat us at a table. Continuing with the bad service, our waiter decided not to show up at our table for a good ten minutes. Another fifteen minutes later we finally got some water, which prompted my wife to pull the hostess aside and politely ask her to move us or give us better service.

After that, the service wasn't bad. Too bad we couldn't say the same about the food. Sure, the huge biscuits coated in honey were good, but the other two items we tried needed a lot of work. The crab cake chowder had a decent crab cake placed in the soup bowl -- not jumbo lump crab, just the shredded meat parts. The chowder was devoid of potatoes, had very little corn and was so thick that it was more pudding than soup.

The roasted butternut squash with mushroom risotto was some of the most bland, unappealing risotto I've ever had and the flavor of the dish was completely over-powered by a heaping mound of sundried tomatoes. The lightly battered shrimp that was in the dish was decent and the asparagus may have been the best tasting thing on the plate.

The presentation of the food is much more impressive than the taste. Clearly, in the case of the items I tried, it was quantity over quality. The amount of food is absurd and one appetizer and one entree could have been enough to feed four.

Despite mediocre service and subpar food, the worst thing about HHAGG was the bathroom. It was about as dirty as a frat house on a Sunday morning -- trash and toilet paper all over the floor, floors that looked flooded from a backed-uped toilet, and the parts of the floor that weren't flooded were sticky like a movie theater floor.

Hash House might be worth the wait for breakfast, but I would pass on dinner.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,2,2,_a_jMXuIq6bu5PwqJV4x_Q

My family really enjoyed their potatoes, both the mashed and breakfast style. My daughter LOVED her biscuit and took mine to go!  The portions large and the presentation were on point.  
The service was basic, not good not bad.  Our server appeared pretty busy, but didn't seem slammed.  I guess she just didn't care to go out of her way to provide quality service.  She stopped at the table twice after we received our food, once immediately after, but upon receiving a head nod from only one of our four she quickly darted away before anyone else could respond; when there was actually a need.

I have been to the Henderson location once and my experience over there was okay. I figure I'd give this place another chance, but the food was just okay once again. 

I ordered the fried chicken penne pasta since I had already tried the fried chicken and waffles. Highlight of the dish was definitely the chicken. They got the batter, seasoning, and juicy chicken down. The downside was how the pasta was overcooked and you don't get much of it. It turns out that they placed half an apple in my dish since it was the base to hold up the chicken. So at first it looked like a good amount of food for $18.99, but that illusion quickly gets dispelled once you dig into your dish. The sauce of the dish was okay, nothing too special about it. 

If I ever go back to a Hash House, I'll probably try another dish with the fried chicken. So far the waffles and pasta has been a miss in my book.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,3,3,3,R604el6_e7se4EGXAbwe7g

forrest y and i were in vegas for less than 24 hours so we were bummed when we had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table and another 30-45 minutes for our order to arrive. advice for you: prime time is noon so arrive early to beat the crowds or swing by around 1:30PM or thereafter.
as recommended, we ordered the fried chicken with 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes, biscuit, and fruit. food was overall tasty and the portions were big (plates are larger than steering wheels!) but i thought the fried chicken wasn't terribly exciting - you get mostly white meat that isn't well-marinated and tastes more shake-and-bake chicken than fried chicken southern style. next time i think i'll try one of the benedicts or sample the burgers.
 
a great tip from our waitress: it costs $2.50 to split an order but orders are way too big to reasonably polish it off by yourself... so go with a friend and order one dish on the menu and a side dish (ex - crunchy potatoes).",5p7fIgmWgP6yWdqJbSrlig,0,0,4,qzi2_i7AQjthzMJ5V4-S_w

It's got ample parking. A wait in line to be seated. Not a large restaurant but it has a small bar and dining room with silver metal decor. Relaxed atmosphere. Service is attentive. A second visit was with Mom again with friends and some other friends on an occasion during a Happy Hour for my birthday celebration followed by dinner. Plenty of hors d'ouevres passed around. Mom loved the shrimp in a stick because they were large shrimps, they were Prawns! Well of course, I couldn't be any happier but just munching on the many finger foods which to my delight had just the right amount of tastiness. Afraid to fill myself up in so much of the appetizers I had to stop from sampling any more to make room for dinner since I have heard from friends was to make room in tummy-tum-tum for the main meals. I heeded, for when our dinner was set on the table, we couldn't help but admire the presentation and the generous portions. One meal can be shared by two or three people. Not disappointing at all was the taste. Breakfast favorites are: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict with maple reduction served with 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit which the smell of sage gives it the extra invitation to deliciousness, and the Griddled French Toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup was just the right amount of moistness and sweetness. By the way, the bread is Amish bread, oh goood. Anything that's Southern cooking to me is a favorite and those two are my breakfast favorites. Wouldn't say no to Chocolate Chip Flapjack with banana and pecans which the chef specially made. He specifically made it and personally served it to us. The chef was personable. The flapjack were thick, soft and goooey with melting chocolate just like ooheey-goooey cheese in a pizza. I like their lemonade and the sweetened iced tea beverages. Dinner favorites: Andy's Stuffed Burger is roasted Mid-West beef patties topped with smoked mozzarella & charred tomato, stacked high in large buns served with criss-cross fries. The right amount of ""seaside"" taste in the Manila Clams drenched in white wine garlic broth mixed with caramelized onions and sprinkling of crushed red pepper. Say, yummy clams. Never to say no but say yes to Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower which was served with fried leeks drizzled with hot maple reduction. The waffles were just the right crispiness, and the chicken moist. The Black Skillet Pork Ribs served pipin' hot in a black skillet pipin' hot were in its rib-y juiciness to the bites.

3583503,2014-11-30,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"VERDICT: Impressive LOOKING food...that is all.

Greg and I got so excited to see Hash House a Go Go on the Travel Channel or Food Network or whatever channel they got onto.  Finally, a really fun restaurant in Las Vegas that isn't on the strip.

I've been to Hash House a Go Go several times and I have to say, I'm not a fan.  Here's the deal, the food is impressive looking.  Just do an Google image search for Hash House a Go Go to see some of the creations.  The visual wowness of the food is really the only best part about it.  The biscuits are dry, crumbly and tasteless.  The ""homemade"" strawberry preserves tastes just like Smuckers.  The breakfast potatoes are bland and often undercooked.  The food that people rave about is basically food that is pretty hard to mess up, like pancakes, waffles and fried chicken.

Basically, the presentation can be summed up as this:  Stack a bunch of large portions of food on top of each other, throw some fried grass of some kind on top of it or uncooked spaghetti, and shove a large twig of rosemary down the middle to make it look fancy

I can throw food on my plate with some weeds at home.  Thanks.",pd5ouypeFcAlLEZ25o2uBg,0,0,2,Uea-CVCaWlo_gUMEoJ465g

3592597,2012-04-17,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"People love this place - I just don't get it.

Maybe they used to be great, back in the days before they became a globally recognized hipster breakfast joint. 

Today, Hash House a Go Go is nothing more than a bad joke, where the punch line is actual line you have to stand to wait for a seat.

The first and most glaring problem is the staff - both front of the house and back.

The wait staff is clearly more interested in their tips than anything else. This happens quite a lot when a restaurant gets popular - it tends to draw the kind of servers who know that your crappy little tip will have no effect on their daily take, so they focus on turnover instead of quality. They don't care if you are unhappy with anything, just eat and get out so they can get someone else at your table. Management loves these kinds of servers, because they increase the bottom line. 

The kitchen staff is even worse. My HH Original Benedict was drowning in red pepper sauce - I mean DROWNING. Just touching it with a fork caused a tsunami that almost crashed over the edge of the plate. I liked the sauce, but it became the only thing you could taste. The biscuit was just terrible, it was so heavy it was indistinguishable from the potatoes it rested on and together they tasted like paste. Now if this is on purpose (some sort of take on their 'going to extremes' theme) then the chef who created this monstrosity is an idiot. If it was an accident and they let it leave the kitchen looking like this, then it's obvious that no one cares about quality anymore.

The second problem has to be management - it's apparent that profit is the only thing that matters.

Congratulations on your short-lived success Hash House - it's a shame you let it go to your head. It won't be long before your greed will eat you alive.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,6,3,2,hQUh6gEqzvPoxSc7nZ-RmA

3605238,2010-12-02,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I recently saw a cable show where a limousine company turned a Ferrari into a limo.  It had never been done before. Frankly, it was preposterous. One of the guys interviewed said their biggest challenge was finding a way to make the supercar a stretch limo while maintaining the driving characteristics of a Ferrari. And somehow, they did it.  Although a bit less of an engineering challenge, the folks at Hash House A-Go-Go construct entrees that ride this fine line between quality and mega size.

Featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, Hash House specializes in their self-proclaimed ""twisted farm food,"" basically jumbo-sized offerings and off-beat interpretations of traditional American favorites.  While their ""twisted"" fare is available at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they're probably best known for their breakfast.  We visited the day after Thanksgiving around 10:30a and had a predictably long wait (45-50 mins). Consistent with the rebel streak they're going for, walls at their Sahara Ave. location are adorned with diamond plate textured metal and large nuts and bolts. The industrial look suggests that guys into bikes and hot rods would feel right at home.

We ordered their signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Tractor Driver Special with Mango Coconut Pancakes (and for the record, it was my petite wife who chose to order the benedict). There's no denying the benedict was a monstrosity: a layer of biscuits, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, and spinach TOPPED with fried chicken and generous amounts of their chipotle cream (gravy). And because anything this big merits a tree-topper, they plant a long sprig of fresh sage right on top.  Good grief.  I have to say my initial impression was genuine awe with undertones of mild disgust. This was clearly a dream for anyone who derives regular enjoyment from KFC's ""famous bowls."" Pushing past our bizarre feelings of hunger laced with nausea, Dorothy and I started picking at the gravy-laden structure. And to our surprise, there were some nice flavor combinations depending on where you chose to bury your fork. The fried chicken itself was done well--crispy with nice chunks of moist white meat. Combined with a bite of potato and gravy, the chicken evoked a holiday meal more than it did breakfast. The chipotle cream had a nice hint of smokiness, but as it cooled down, the self-hatred to taste ratio definitely increased.  

Only lacking tomato sauce and the fact it wasn't tossed into the air at any point during its life cycle, my pancake was basically a medium to large-sized pizza. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the lack of any ""doughiness,"" or uncooked batter. The pancake itself wasn't the best I've had, but it was adequately fluffy and a solid effort, bolstered by generous chunks of fresh juicy mango and shredded coconut. Not bland, but not too sweet, some pieces of cake could be eaten without syrup. My eggs were soft scrambled just right, and the sausage links plump and tasty (I've found that a decent test of a cook's competency with eggs is to order them soft scrambled; not having them overcooked or gushing of yolk requires just a bit of care and timing). The Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade was a nice way to top things off--tasty and refreshing, but lacking any heavily-syruped sweetness.               

It goes without saying that visits to these kinds of restaurants require a pre-meal regimen of a week-long fast, meditation, and a check-up with your doctor.  I think a regular visit would risk a gross-out burn-out.  Although, glancing at the scrambles and other egg dishes of our fellow patrons, it seems that slightly more modest meals are possible.  I've noticed a number of folks complaining about the price, which is perplexing. While the benedict cost $15.95 and the pancacke combo $14.95 (both at the top of their breakfast price scale), I'd point out that you're actually getting about $15.95 and $14.95 worth of food when ordering these dishes.  Each dish could easily feed two hungry human beings.  Sure, maybe they could drop a buck or so off the price, but if you're ever in L.A., go somewhere other than Denny's for breakfast. Double-digit fru-fru breakfasts are everywhere here, some with decent quality, but typically with a quarter of Hash House's portion size.  We have ample experience being ripped off at breakfast places, and Hash House isn't one of them.    

A lunch at Hash House is probably in store for our next visit to Vegas.  I'll probably try the ""Kokomo,"" the benign moniker for what looks to be another guilt-ridden meal in the form of a meatloaf sandwich. It's probably a good thing we don't get out to Vegas too often these days. Like the city itself, Hash House is a spectacle incompatible with daily living.",Kixq2O_eqU86zuhaRN_BGw,2,2,4,dgNJqa-ykAbX9TI4o_3RHA

3613795,2012-10-19,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Food was fine. Service was passable. I just have a problem with their policies. Maybe just one policy, actually. Prior to my trip to Las Vegas, I was excited to plan a meal at HH-a-GG. I was more excited to find a restaurant.com deal available. At our first opportunity, we made our way to the Hash House. Mid-afternoon, easy parking, no crowd...perfect! We went in and placed our orders, presenting the gift certificate at that time. Beverages were delivered and we were expecting our food when the waitress announced that they wouldn't honor our gift certificate because it was a holiday. Raise your hand if you have Columbus Day off. Thank you, Postal Workers! Now, it was a little late to mention this, but I let it pass. We were hungry! 

The coupon thing riled me a bit, but later in the vacation, we made our way back HH-a-GG thinking to redeem that sucker after all. It seems our timing was off once again. In Las Vegas, there are no designated times for anything. Except maybe at this place. We'd just missed what they considered the lunch portion of the day, so we were only presented with the dinner menu. At least they were quick to point out that the fine print on the coupon said ""breakfast or lunch."" I asked about the ""Late Breakfast"" section on the dinner menu. No Dice!

As I mentioned, the food was fine, so they get one of their two stars for that. The other is for having Arrogant Bastard Ale. I could easily have had a five-star experience here if not for their steadfast refusal to honor a freakin' ten dollar discount. Was it going to kill them? Is Columbus Day even a holiday in Nevada? It is not. School is in, state offices are open and Hash House a Go-Go is not that stinkin' busy.

3617411,2016-11-21,5,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Ehhhh...I think my expecations were a bit too high.

My first time here after hearing and seeing so much about this place online and on the tube.  From Martha Stewart, Rachel Ray, to Adam Richmond, who all basically went cuckoo for cocoa puffs over this place.  For me, I think the appeal is more about the food shock when this enormous plate of food arrives at your table than it is about spectacular food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good but I would truly want a smaller portion of excellent food than an over-the-top portion of O.K. food.

I ordered the Sage fried chicken benedict and Mark H ordered the Crab cake benedict.  Both came with the same sauce over the top which is a chipotle cream instead of a hollandaise.  It was pretty spicy (which our server mentioned) and went O.K. with the chicken but Mark H said it obliterated whatever subtle seafood flavors there were in the crab cake.  The proteins came atop a split country biscuit which was on top of a mound of griddled mashed potatoes.  Carb overkill and definitely why the plate is huger than it should be.  The plate also came with a small orange slice and a slice of melon.  I guess this small addition of fresh fruit is meant to counter-balance the super-rich carbo-loading dish?  Another thing I didn't understand was what seemed like uncooked (or maybe flash fried?) angel hair pasta sticking out the sides of the dish, almost like kitty or catfish whiskers, possibly added for texture but it was more like raw pasta chew that got stuck between the teeth. Very odd addition.

With all this being said, the plates could probably feed two seasoned eaters or a light eating family of four - including a small puppy. The majority of diners (including myself who has been referred to as a bottomless pit before) will take home food for later munching.  Two meals for the price of one is sort of a deal I guess but not really since my dish was $18.99 and was pretty much 2/3 biscuit and mashed potato.

One last thing I guess I'll mention was Mark H, who has been to the original one in San Diego, was a bit disappointed with this one because he said it now has that ""chain"" restaurant vibe, he said he felt like he was in a Chilis but with darker wood but better music...oh well.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,5,5,3,iFmyUXBeZtGiMRK1tjrPDg

I seriously had food coma after four bites so I recommend sharing if you're not a fat-ass. 

I also got the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade $4.50, a very cute and tasty multi-colored drink with a huge piece of watermelon off to the side of the glass.

I wanted to taste it more but the smokiness just wasn't all there.  The potatoes were amazing though!  They were nice and crunchy and perfectly fried and tender throughout.  I didn't really eat the biscuit.  I was too much filling for me.

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict: It was not bad but too overwhelming for me.  I can share this with a few people but will never order this by myself.  This chicken was fried really nicely but I found it to be a bit dry.

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict Indiana Favorites: I'm not sure why we ordered two fried chicken benedicts!  This one was just as overwhelming as the other and the chicken was also a bit dry.  However, I really really liked the maple syrup on this one.  It goes so well with the chicken.

The biscuits (a specialty) were big but they were served cold and without any butter or honey (is that a non-Southerner thing???).  Worst of all, the morning I was there (after 9am), there were 2 servers who couldn't handle a nearly empty room of 6 tables.

IF you love bold, strong coffee, the coffee ROCKS! (My dad loved it)
This location is not on the strip, so it's nice to get away from all the hustle and bustle.
They have the very best biscuits and sausage gravy!
You must try their homemade jam! 
Their vanilla waffles are outstanding and they serve them with warmed syrup, which is really nice.
Excellent service!!!!

Cons:
IF you prefer mild, medium coffee, the coffee SUCKS!!! (My take on it)
Thought that the bacon and eggs breakfast should come with more than two wimpy pieces of bacon.
Thought it was outrageous that our breakfast came with a biscuit but to add a side of gravy was almost 3 dollars! I mean it's good gravy but is it made of gold?
The woman's bathroom was not nicely maintained and the handicapped stall would not lock.

Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas). 

Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU. 

It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that. 

Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.",4Y81J2Tdq5XAnkeYmCZ2ow,17,13,4,Jns2oqqdL9D5EId6sX7GKw

Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict ($14.95) - (the one from Man vs. Food) Must share. It's HUGE and oh so good. Everything just went together so well.

Snickers Flapjack ($7.95) - It's your basic flapjack/pancake with Snickers mixed in. It's served with butter and maple syrup. The size of this flapjack is huge. It's larger than the average sized dinner plate. Maybe just as big as a table charger.

large orange juice ($5.50)

Smores Mocha($6.25) - It looked so tempting in the picture, but it kinda fell short for me. After sipping/spooning/eating the top of the drink that had the marshmallows floating with drizzles of chocolate syrup and the graham crackers on the side, and all was left was the actual mocha drink, the joy of this drink died out for me.

While waiting for our laundry to wash at the local laundromat we ate here for a late breakfast. 

Hubby and I split the Sage Chicken & Waffles. Seasoning and taste of the chicken was good--breaded and fried well, moist chicken breast. ***My only CON is I wish the waffles were a cooked longer/made a little crispier. I'll have to ask for that if there's a next time. 

O had the kid's Bacon Waffle which was bigger than her head--they use a 4-square waffle iron!  She only finished one square which is probably a typical kid size serving. She started ""digging for gold""=bacon when I stopped her. Hahaha!  

H had the kid's Griddled Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes. The meatloaf obviously was precooked and just fried up on the grill to get it warm on the inside and crisp on the outside. It was very dense and average tasting, she claims my meatloaf tastes better.  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and had good flavor. Not just a starchy scoop of potatoes.

One finally went to see if they could find one.  After 10 minutes I asked if we could just get some crackers or something.  They said they had none, but we could order fruit or a biscuit.

As I am writing this, the manager came over.  When we complained she snickered and asked us if this was our first time here.  She claimed that the food is fresh, so that's why it is taking so long.

I do have one issue with drink prices. We were told we could purchase drinks at a discounted price at the bar in the waiting area, which we did, but discounted they were not.

Two very small mimosas cost $22 dollars! This was especially upsetting when after being seated we realized the menu price for a mimosa was only $8.

3721790,2011-12-06,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I came to Las Vegas with my grandmother, father, and my two children to watch the December 4th Rock and Roll Marathon. We asked someone who lives in Los Vegas about restaurants they would recommend and this was the first place they mentioned. In fact, they were emphatic that we had to go there, if only to experience the HUGE portions they serve.

When we arrived, we were told to expect about a half hour wait, and that's about how long we waited. While waiting, we took in our surroundings: it's a warm and inviting restaurant with exposed beam ceilings, which suggest down-home country building. It's December, so they'd decorated for the season, with a HUGE tree in the middle of the room decorated with lights and large ornaments. Stockings were hung here and there, and what looked to be fake poinsettia plants were arranged on dividers between the sections of the restaurant. Normally, I don't like to see phony flowers in a restaurant, but in the case of seasonal ones that are sure to be removed before dust settles, that's fine with me, especially when it's as well-kept a restaurant as this one is.

We were told to arrive HUNGRY, so we did, and we're glad we did! Our friends were not exaggerating when they said the portions were humungous. My children both ordered from the kids menu, both opting for chocolate chip buttermilk pancakes. I promise to swear on a stack of bibles that their eyes were as huge as saucers when their pancakes were brought out to them! The pancakes from the kids menu are nearly as big around as basketballs! WOW! My 8 year old couldn't finish, and the 9 year old finished but didn't want a thing to eat all day after that!

I ordered the Tractor Driver Combo, which is two eggs, made to order, your choice of bacon, sausage or potatoes, with a buttermilk pancake. My eggs were ordered over medium, which should be a firm white with a creamy yet runny yolk, there should be no uncooked egg white at all with over medium eggs, yet that's what I got, and the yolk was watery instead of creamy in texture. If you order over medium or over hard, be certain to specify to the wait staff that you do not want runny whites. I wasn't overly concerned about it, though, because the flavor wasn't bad and the sausage had a really nice flavor. And, besides that, the pancake was clearly the star of the show! The plate all of this was on was an oval shaped one, longer than a football (american) and as wide as a soccer ball. The pancake itself was also wider than a soccer ball! And it was GOOD!!

We all agreed that this was a restaurant to return to. I would have given it 5 stars, but for our eggs (all three adults ordered over medium and they all came out with runny whites and watery yolks) and the fact that the corned beef hash dish my father ordered came out in a skillet that had not been prewarmed, so in the process of transporting it from the kitchen to the table, his eggs were stone cold. I'm hoping this was an oversight, though, so that next time we go and receive it in a warm skillet, we can post a new review with all 5 stars (HINT HINT To any Hash House a Go Go staff that see this review: Warm Your Skillets Before Plating!! LOL)

Secondly, the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade is a pure stroke of genius.  You have given me an idea for a new party drink creation - KiwiWaterLemon Soju.

Next, let's go on to A_____, your very defensive waiter.  I asked him to describe a ""Scramble"" and he told me what it was.  My response was ""Oh.  Okay,  So it's kinda like a Denny's breakfast skillet.""  He then got pretty irritated and told me that it's not anything like that.  ""And unlike Denny's, we use fresh ingredients that probably came in from California this morning.""  Geez.  Okay.  Relax.  So I was fucking wrong.  Excuse me.  Just correct me, don't treat me like an idiot.  I should have walked out at that point.

Lastly, do NOT eat the ""HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella"" (House Hash) served with eggs on a bed of crispy potatoes.  The meatloaf is tasteless, dry and gray.  There's a great biscuit, but no country gravy.  I ate the eggs and a little bit of the meatloaf, then let the rest of it rot.  This is a poorly designed dish and it should be removed from the menu.

This restaurant belongs to a more hip casino, not the Imperial Palace! Its contemporary decor is no match for the Imperial Palace's notorious 60s ""Enter the Dragon"" appeal. I think we've passed Bruce Lee's era on Mr. Han's island. 

It was a maze trying to find this place. Had to ask around, walk up and down the casino floor to find the escalator to take you to the restaurant. *whew* A workout it was. We were greeted by a friendly host and then given the menu.

If you've read any previous reviews, you'll know that we tried to go to hhagg at the linq and never got to eat because of the atrocious service. I personally would have never tried it again but my brother in law suggested going here while we were in town and we obliged.  So, there was that experience as the underlay of this visit.

I upgraded the rating for this location because the service was very good this time. We were seated promptly, drinks were refilled, orders were correct, wait staff were very good. And, I'm pretty sure that the kitchen also prepared the food according to hhagg recipes.  

My problem is, now that I actually tried the food, this type of food just isn't for me. It's too much bread and potato (I know, farm food...). The food is just rich and starchy with nothing there to cut through.

We ordered the chorizo scramble which was probably the best thing on the table. Potatoes (of course) covered in chorizo and jalapenos with a side od scrambled eggs and biscuit with a very hood strawberry jam. We also ordered the fried chicken Benedict- NOTE: no runny egg on the benedict???? It consisted of mashed potatoes topped with biscuits (why????) topped with one raw tomato round and some raw spinach, topped with scrambled eggse, then fried chicken the some kind of gravy and chipotle cream sauce. We also ordered the chicken fried steak which was unfortunately tasteless and served with more potatoes and biscuits (seeing a theme here?). Also, the chicken and waffles. Waffles are not crisp, at all, totally floppy waffles, then the chicken which was just there, nothing special, less seasoning then say a Popeyes restaurant.  

Again, it's not for me. If biscuits topped with mashed potatoes sounds good to you, then I highly recommend this restaurant. I won't return.",tRIHlMbHe4Hsg-ubVLg8Ow,0,0,2,jyYmt0iyBIptauBDyZO8gA

I made my first trip here 3 years ago after seeing the man vs food episode and now it is an absolute must on every Vegas trip.  I was there for the week of the 4th and hit it up on the 4th...and the 6th.  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is my go to when I have to split with my wife.  When the shackles come off and I can order whatever I want, there's no telling what I'll get.  I'll list a few that I've had:

Chicken and Waffles: SHARE THIS.  It's two big pieces of chicken paired with waffles that have bacon baked into them.  I've never come close to finishing but wished I could.

Blackberry Granola Pancake: I was embracing my inner tree hugger and it was delicious.  The berries explode all over the pancake with patches of granola baked right in.  If you like those flavors, get this into your mouth asap.

Corned Beef Hash: Order this if you like actual corned beef and not the dog food that comes in the Hormel can.  It's served in strips, almost shredded, in a skillet with eggs and potatoes and a buscuit.  Coulda been something I'm missing, but it's all about the corned beef.  

Banana Pecan French Toas: Take a big ass banana, split it down the middle and cook that bad boy up.  Now pair it with some of the best french toast you've had with pecans also invited to the party in your mouth.  If you want some serious sweet for breffas, do this.

DRINKS- I've been wanting to order drinks for a while now.  I always fixate on the food and skip the exotic drink menu. NOT THIS LAST TIME THOUGH.

Smores Mocha: Are you F'n kidding me?  First it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). It's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker.  It's very sweet, so I'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation I could give to make this any better.

Caramel Mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate.  Like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet.  I like my coffee STRONG, so I'd add an extra shot next time if possible.

I believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, The M, The Plaza, The Imperial Palace and this one.  I like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so I avoid a little of the Vegas madness.  It gets packed pretty early.  If you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken.  You need to COMMIT TO BREAKFAST, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.

My wife and her sister each had the ""Kokomo"" , griddled HH famous meatloaf made with a blend of fresh ground beef, sausage & bacon all trimmed with roasted tomato & griddled smoked mozzarella cheese on milk bread, which they found to be a tad on the dry side. 

I had The Tractor Driver Combo which included two eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. This was my second time ordering this meal. The first time I ate the entire pancake, it was breakfast time. This time, I took a good half of the pancake home. Dinner time shows I was not able to complete my meal.

The kids, ages 8 and 6 each had a hamburger. They could have split one burger between them it was so large.

I got the sage chicken with the eggs Benedict. The chipotle sauce is flavorful and has a bit of spicy. You can ask them for more sauce and drench the mash potatoes and the biscuit in the sauce. The sage chicken is juicy but I got to try the pork loin eggs benedict and the pork loin tastes better. The pork loin was juicer and pairs better with the sauce.

3770426,2012-04-02,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I kept hearing about this establishment as a great breakfast spot, and didn't want to go to a watered down version of it with locations located throughout various casinos on the strip. So, we opted for the one about 6 miles off the strip. Don't let the drive to it scare ya, as it's lined with a lot of vacant businesses. You will reach the location as it's across a CarMax and it's next to some Vampire themed club (no, I'm not joking).

We got here around 8:30am Saturday and the place was pretty vacant. We took the tip from others stating to get here before 10am. Loved the mellow ambiance of the place and the staff was super friendly and got seated with our menus asap. 

Their menu was no joke and goes way beyond the standard breakfast options. Some things made myself and the hubby go ooo and ahhh, but since we didn't want to try anything too crazy as we were heading to Utah for an long day of being outdoors, we opted for something that would sustain us for a long day ahead. I opted for the original HH benedicts while the hubby got the Tractor Driver combo. We looked around the other tables with the huge portions, so we knew what to expect. 
Here's the breakdown:

Original HH benedict- Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs, --oh, and this in top of a huge biscuit and mashed potatoes!!!! Holy moly, when they brought it out, it was like a diorama of the Red Rock canyon, with a sprig of rosemary as a miniature tree on top of the mountains! I swear, cutting into it was cutting through 5-6 layers of food! One bite and man oh man...so gooooooood!!!! The BBQ cream gave it a different flavor because I'm a hollandaise type of gal, but it worked for this dish! Seriously, 2 people could have split this entree, but I got through about 75% on my own (hey, needed the carbs for the hiking!). Definite try if you're an eggs benedict person like me. 

As for the Tractor Driver combo, it was a borderline pothole sized pancake with eggs and bacon. The hubby can eat pancakes, but even he only ate about 1/2 of the pancake in order to eat the eggs and bacon as well. Goodness! 

So yea...the portions here flat out represents why people think people in America are fatties. And if an episode of ""Man vs. Food"" had to prove how ginormous their portions are...yea, come here with an appetite.

I won't lie...I secretly would like to return to try to chicken and waffles breakfast I saw others eating at the place, but again, will have to share that monstrocity with someone because I may get a heart attack if I ate it myself.

Hash House features American Farmhouse Food with a twist! Portions are huge and the combinations are creative. This place will get you eating outside of your comfort zone, and you'll be okay with it!

SAGE FRIED CHICKEN and BACON WAFFLES
We had heard so much about the chicken and waffles, so the bf HAD to get it: Sage Fried Chicken stacked up high atop Hash House's famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction, and fried leeks. Remember that thing I mentioned about the portion sizes being huge?! Yeah, this is the perfect example. One look, and the bf knew he wouldn't be able to finish it by himself. Hah. Good thing I'm always available to pick up the slack. ;) BTW, it was phenomenal. I loved the bacon waffles!

BENEDICT
Of course once I saw the word ""Benedict,"" I was already drawn in. But um... be warned, they don't serve ""traditional"" anything at Hash House a Go Go, so don't go in expecting ""traditional"" American Fare. I love to try new things, so I was real excited about their gourmet-sounding Benedict. I chose the HH original w/ smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream, and two basted eggs. Like all Benedicts at HH, it was served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mash. It was excellent. I'm a huge fan of spinach and roasted red peppers, so this was totally right up my alley. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and all the flavors melded together very nicely. And even though I am the biggest fan of Hollandaise, this red pepper cream sauce was a nice complement. 

BIG O'CRISPY HAND HAMMERED PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICH
This sandwich is almost as big as it's name! It's like a HUGE pork cutlet served in a whole wheat bun, with onion, pickles, and ketchup. It comes with a choice of side.
Hungry people, search no further! This thing is HUGE. This is taking ""huge portion sizes"" to another level. You'll have to see it to believe it. As for the taste, it was good. Almost like any other good, tasty, crispy pork cutlet I've ever had. Just 10x bigger..

VERDICT
Overall, if you order the ""right"" things, you won't be disappointed. And of the things I've eaten at Hash House a Go Go, I have yet to be dissatisfied. Try, try, try this place! Especially if you are a big eater, like me. ;)

The atmosphere is so neat- I love the whole farm to table thing and it has this whole hee haw meets hipster vibe which I dig. 
Our waitress didn't have a name tag on. She was attentive, my one complaint being the level of food education she has had. Example: I asked that the eggs be dairy free.

Kids loved their pancakes. Given. Their favorite pancakes are from IHOP. But no complaints. They were huge! We could have had them split.

Of course we also had to try the Chicken and Waffles and the fried chicken Benedict. The waffles literally had bacon cooked inside them. The fried chicken is like one of the best I've ever tasted. It is crispy, flavorful and moist inside. IF YOU GO THERE, YOU MUST TRY IT.

The service was awesome. Very friendly, helpful and quick. Will probably come by here whenever we're in Vegas.",3-26zw4Eaz4h4aAZv3IKlw,3,3,5,YMrIWGQLG6bigw7E8X7G8w

3809021,2011-02-22,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I'll be honest. While the rest of my party who went here may not have liked what they ordered, I loved the food. 

We went here because the driver of the other car, who was the organizer of the trip, saw it on tv on Drivers, Dine-Ins, and Dives, and said it looked good. 

We arrived in Vegas and set about finding this restaurant based on general directions from the other driver. Honestly, if you're not paying attention to the signs on the right side of the road (heading eastbound on Sahara) you can easily miss this location. The location opens at 730, and we arrived here at about 6am. We pretty much spent an hour and a half sleeping in the car. 

The menu is simple, however it would do good to have photos of all that you would be ordering. What you may not realize when you first come to this restaurant is that the portions are very generous. 

What I mean by this is that two of our people ordered a pancake combination. When you order pancakes, you think that they'd be like IHOP pancakes or like McDonald's hotcakes, but this thing, according to the server, was about the size of a medium pizza. He sure as hell wasn't kidding! I mean, that thing was the size of a newborn! Two people shared one of the pancake platters, and the other person gave up on eating the pancake without eating it. (I wolfed the whole thing down in about two minutes for him) 

Two other people ordered a Hash House combination plate, which I believe was hashed potatoes and some green pepper and sausage pieces. One ate most of it, the other person finished only a small portion of it, and shared with the rest of the people on our side of the booth.

My coworker ordered a waffle platter, and finished only one corner of a waffle and part of his hashed potatoes. He saved the rest in case we were hungry later on in the day. 

The driver of the other car ordered what I believe was Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. When it came out, it looked about the size of a small child's head. The chicken portion that I cut through (to get a bite) was boneless and covered in a delicious sauce. With my help and the help of some of the other people on the table, we finished a little under half of the platter. 

The item that I ordered was the One Pound Hash House Mushroom and Swiss Stuffed Burger with a side of Fries. When the burger came out, It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The hamburger patties had the swiss/mushroom mixture oozing out of the middle, and it pretty much dwarfed the hamburger bun. It came with the fries, about four fried spaghetti sticks, and around the plate, there was this caramel type texture sauce. Even with the help of three other people, we only managed to eat under half of the burgers. 

The restaurant began to get much more busier by the time we left, as more persons were beginning to come in to eat the food. The server was very pleasant and came by pretty often to check up on us. 

The next time i go up there, i'm definitely going to stop by here and put myself into another food coma. De Licious!!",uEXWSpl3qHIjDdjhCwe7KQ,2,0,5,uep8TKxC8ruuUEmi4wUexQ

Our server, Izzy, was great.  We all started with waters and drinks: screwdriver and chardonnays for the drinkers, iced tea and soda for us non-drinkers.  The cups are huge so you shouldn't run out of drinks the first go around, unless you are really thirsty.

Ok, so the meals. We walked by a plate with the tractor driver combo (2 eggs, bacon, flapjack)l, and that pancake was HUGE. The burgers were so big, the bun looks like it was minaturized.  Since we didn't want to be big blobs while driving, we all chose the smallest menu items available. I chose to have the basic which was 2 eggs (overhard for me), crispy potatoes, a biscuit and bacon.  My fiance had the baby burger as it was the smallest burger on the menu and he loved it.

I ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.

After a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.

My strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.

TBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.

Overall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.

Our server did not bring butter, jam or honey and did not ask if we would like any.  My brain usually kicks in about the time a server has just left, but on this occasion I asked after not being offered anything.  Butter and jam where brought back to the table.  No choice of what kind of jam I would prefer.  No mention of honey maybe being available.

Service (food runners, hostess, etc): 2
Ambience: 3
Overall Satisfaction: 4/10

Saturday, 2 in the afternoon, came here based on glowing recommendations. Kinda cold, music waay too loud, but in their defense I was pretty hangry (hungry+angry).

On the menu it says to allow them time to make the food like your mom does it. Don't rush them, everything is from scratch. Okay, I'm cool with that. So we order; he got the French Toast and I did the Corned Beef Hash with sunny side eggs. 

We wait. 

Finally the food comes. The food runner brings it out using towels because (I assume) the plate and cast iron skillet are just too hot to handle....Psych! I'm wrong and the food is cold. Not room temperature...cold. It's been sitting for so long that the meat and the eggs feel cold in my mouth. Nasty.

Our server, Summer, was super amazing and understanding. She explained that they don't have microwaves or food lamps (which means the food must've been sitting there forever). If it wasn't for her being so cool and nice about the situation I would've been inclined to rate this place a big, fat, 1 star. 

But she (sorta) saved the day. The new food was brought out very, very quickly (which makes me wonder what the BOH staff was doing the whole time. This place was probably 1/4 full). Food was slightly better but still not overwhelmingly delicious. It wouldn't break my heart if we never ate here again.

Thought I could tackle this thing, but only ate half. You'd probably have to share this meal with someone or you'll end up with leftovers (which isn't always a bad thing!) 

The mango coconut pancake is something that I probably will have every time I eat here. When I told our server that I was ordering it for my three year-old, she said, ""It's pretty huge."" I replied, ""Yup, we're sharing it!"" Even though it was a shared piece, we still went home with half of it. 

I failed to mention that perhaps the main reason why I couldn't eat all of my food was because I had a Blood Mary. It's definitely a meal in itself. It was sinfully good and perfectly balanced. Wished I could've taken my leftover drink with me:D

By the way John the waiter is the best, he is so helpful and friendly, I recommend him as a waiter if he's available. So why four stars? They had no vegetarian options. Luckily I was able to order the crab eggs Benedict, just without the crab and with mushrooms instead. It would be great if they could expand there menu with some vegetarian options to choose from. By the way the eggs Benedict is not your typical kind, it's more of a country eggs Benedict. They lose the English muffin and replace it with a biscuit, and this is all on top of mashed potatoes. The sauce for the eggs Benedict is phenomenal. Oh and the portions are HUGE, they are shareable plates for sure. I had so much left overs.

My wife and I ordered one pancake, which is basically the size of a manhole cover.  I really wish we hadn't ordered it because there was no way we were going to finish the dish that came next, the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  When the waitress brought the dish, we had people looking and even asking what the heck this thing was.  It was HUGE!  Fortunately, the actual size matched the size of its taste!

Drinks: of their best seller is the Johnny's Famous BLT Mary. To keep the souvenir glass it's $17.99. I got the Deep Eddy Mimosa $6.99. This thing is good; it has a bit of cranberry vodka, tangerine juice and champagne. Imagine that a mimosa with a shot of vodka! Only in Vegas right.

I had my usual: chicken and waffles. It was definitely not your ""Roscoe's"" variety, but very tasty. Hickory smoked bacon was baked right into waffle, with breaded chicken piled high, stabbed with a steak knife to hold the mountain together,  topped and their signature rosemary leaf. 

My husband had the chicken pot-pie; talk about another awe-inspired creation on a plate. It tasted as good as it looked! My brother had their burger. He ate about 1/2 of it, before giving up - it was gigantic! 

We all took leftovers home and had them for dinner the next night!

The sage chicken penne was excellent but you have to like the flavor of sage. It's powerful! The chicken was moist and the batter was golden in color and crisp.

It's a mound of fries and by the time you eat some they are cold. We also had the pepper jack burger and the chicken biscuits and gravy. The burger is a double patty party and you can't finish it!

3920268,2014-03-22,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"So my husband and I remembered seeing this joint on Man v. Food ages ago.  We decided to come here not only because of that fact, but there were also multiple locations around the city and the reviews convinced us that we should try it out.  

There was no wait for us, but we went around noon on St. Patrick's Day, so it wasn't really that busy.

It took a while to slog through the menu - there were an awful lot of choices and I didn't know what to select.  From watching MvF (or, really, anything Adam Richman does), we knew that the portions were going to be insane - and the server even warned us ahead of time that it would happen.  So, yeah.  Come here hungry if you don't want a takeout box, because nearly everyone had them.

I really wanted the chicken and waffles dish that I'd seen, but I KNEW that was going to be too much.  And in light of what I actually ordered, I'm grateful for that decision.

My husband and I ordered the Tractor Driver special - carby item plus eggs plus potatoes.  I ordered a vanilla waffle, he ordered a Snickers pancake.  (Both items incur a slight upcharge.)  And coffee.  Lots of coffee.

When it came.... the look of shock on both of our faces.  We'd been warned, all right, but neither of us actually knew what we were bargaining for.  The attached pictures show the look on my husband's face as he hefts up the SIDE of this gargantuan pancake.  I mean, really.  It was hanging off the edge of the plate.  

My vanilla waffle was not much smaller, either.  It came with a small container of sweet syrup and a fresh strawberry.  Nice touch.

The food was pretty good, I will say.  I didn't notice any difference between a waffle and a vanilla waffle, though - unless my palate is so jaded that I can't tell.  The coffee was pretty good.  It was all just so MUCH.  Obscenely so, really.  It's a good thing that I decided I wasn't going to count calories on vacation....

So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Price was a bit steep, though you do get your money's worth.  And the server was a little on the ""cool"" side for me.  I don't mind people not hovering (in fact, I prefer it), but she was a little TOO standoffish, which can be just as much a turnoff.

I've actually been avoiding this place just because I am not a fan of the places that sell the large portion gimmic (Claim Jumper, Big Salad, Macho Sized Fries).  If you know me you're probably saying to yourself ""Are you kidding me, your the Big Daddy of going big with food"".  If I'm cooking I go big because I want left overs, If I'm paying for it I'd like to feel satisfied without gorging myself.

But this place gets it, I couldn't imagine you doing a Fried Chicken Hash with a wing and tenderloin, it wouldn't work.  I love how there were layers to my breakfast and everything worked together, there wasn't something out of place.  I love the presentation, shows the commitment to quality.

For an off strip location this place just became one of my favorite breakfast spots, can't wait to try it for dinner--Chix and Waffles I hear you calling my name...",AXToqRIfh_TF8PkZkQkw1g,0,0,4,TW_vfkOuhfu2Bt-b07XTfw

We arrived at the place at 130pm and waited for close to half an hour which was fine since there was a lot people waiting. The problem came when we had to wait for the food. We waited close to an hour and half for the chicken benidict and scamble egg. I really felt bad for the waiter who kept saying sorry but the wait really made the food less favorable.

This place is a grosser version of Claim Jumper.  I fell victim to the hype of the chicken and waffles.  Yes, it was huge. And yes, it had a tree branch sticking out of the top of it. But the most memorable thing about it was the taste.  The chicken tasted like dirty old grease.

On my return trip I wanted to come back to the original location in Vegas. I've seriously dreamed about this place. I have raved to friends that Hash House will ruin breakfast at all other places. The husband and I ordered enough for 4, but I really wanted him to try everything.

Pumpkin Latte - perfect balance of pumpkin flavor.

Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles - still the absolute best Chicken and Waffles! Chicken breast was perfectly fried and moist. Waffles had bacon strips in them!

Snickers Pancakes - love that they are the size of a pizza pie! A little disappointed since I love the mango coconut pancake I had 4 years ago. The husband loves snickers and isn't a fan of coconut, so he picked this one. Good, but a little drier. Pancakes with fruit are the way to go.

Sausage Hash - tasty with peppers, sausage and goat cheese. Potatoes were yummy too! 

We finished most of the food as this was our pre-trip home lunch stop before heading to the airport for a 6 hour flight. Staff was friendly. I look forward to coming back the next time we are in town.

During busy times, the line to get a seat can be VERY long. Plan ahead of time or prepare to wait (sometimes outside).

The best parts of my Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict were the crispy fried mashed potatoes, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce. Mixed together, they were better than bacon!

Atmosphere is always crowded & loud! Very loud! They pump up the music so loud that the hostess had to yell at the top of her lungs for parties and if you're seated near her it's all you hear throughout your meal. It ridiculous! Turn the music down a little and people will be able to hear the host and have a nice conversation without yelling over the music!
Food, hubby ordered his usual corned beef hash and let me tell u, don't order it if you're a corned beef hash lover! With the name hash house you'd expect their hash to be awesome. But it was just pieces of shredded fresh corned beef on top of seasoned potatoes, topped w/ shredded cheese & green onions. It's not even ""hashed"" together! They serve it with a lame dry biscuit and a piece of watermelon & strawberry. I ordered their popular menu item, banana French toast. Now this dish was good and had 3 big thick slices topped with cooked banana. This is the only reason they get 1star.

I devoured it in a matter of minutes. I thought it was pretty good but not all that great. All my friends love my dish especialy the egg because supposedly they could taste the butter in it. I couldnt taste the butter in the egg and didnt know what they were talking about but maybe that was just me being drunk. The other dishes I tried was the waffle and fried chicken from my friend's plate. I thought the chicken with the syrup was too sweet for me but I like the crunch on the chicken. I also remember eating the grilled potato bits or wedges and it was really crispy and good. The tangerine mimosa that got me even more drunk was a little too tangy for me.

Meatloaf Hash - very good, moist, tasty and full of flavor...potatoes that it came with were a bit bland and nothing special, biscuit was good once you added some butter and jam, but dry by itself

Brown Sugar Banana Pancake - the best thing we ordered...brown sugar carmelizes the outside for a nice sweet and crispy texture

Blueberry Pecan Pancake - nothing special, just a giant blueberry pancake

Banana French Toast - another excellent item...just like the pancakes, the brown sugar coating makes it nice and crisp...you dont even really need syrup for it...

Quesadilla - humungous!...probably about an inch and a half thick and full of eggs and potatoes...could have used some meat in it to make it better...this is something the table should share, rather than one person eating it for sure...

And surprisingly, with 2 girls and me, we ate it ALL.  The waitress said, she ""had never seen anything like it before.""  haha  My friends and I can eat and when you see us, you would never expect it. 

Overall, this place is excellent and I would return.  Next try, the fried chicken benedict, which was gigantic and looked delicious.",PkWAYvkhhn03NBB_6i2TkQ,0,0,4,kxXe-twVf7dq9H0bfNhsqQ

If you're on a diet, you better order a plate to share with 3 other people.  The plates here can definitely feed 2, if not 3 or 4 people.  

My favorite thing to order here is the Griddled French toast.  They are 4 huge slices on this dish and it comes with fried Plantin bananas.  They already add the syrup for you and they actually put a good amount.  Of course they offer extra syrup and butter for your taste.  My cousins ordered the Chicken Eggs Benedict, and the BBBLT (bacon bacon bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwhich).  Again, portions huge!  

We were actually able to order all different things and share family style.  I think that's cool.  All the food was yummy! The benedict biscuit bread was a tad bit thick so it kind of took away flavor from all the other stacks on top of it.  I hate when I can't taste the egg!  This is definitely the place to take someone who loves to eat breakfast or brunch.  Entertain them with the huge plates!

SERVICE
Impeccable service by a friendly and knowledgeable server. Forgot his name but he was very polite. 

FOOD
My server briefly went over the menu and said their scrambles are popular so I went with their Farm Scrambles. There are three options of different ingredients and I went with #3 which came with sun-dried tomato, basil and goat cheese. 

It is $11.99 and is a generous portion. Served with griddled mashed, crispy potato, fresh fruits with a choice of toast or homemade biscuit. Their homemade biscuit was extremely dry, similar to the one from Popeye's chicken. Crispy potato was overdone and was way past crispy. Scramble itself wasn't anything special. Made with tomato and basil with goat cheese sprinkled on top. Meh. 

Another thing. I'm sorry to say this but I HATE the rosemary sprig they use for toasts and biscuits. First of all, it looks like a grass growing out from toast/biscuit and second of all, I hate the strong scent that comes out of it. The smell made me sick and I immediately lost my appetite when I accidentally brushed against it.  

CONCLUSION
Great service, mediocre food. I don't see myself coming back here again unless they stop using the rosemary sprig.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,10,8,3,Ladhg2uJyr4IjnCI-BT1Dg

The hubby had been talking about how wonderful this place was so we finally came in for lunch.  We were seated right away, but had the worse table facing the kitchen and a garbage can:( So that doesn't not exactly wet your appetite. I could have waited for a booth, but it's crunch time at lunch time.  Strike 1

We had a very friendly waiter.  He brought out drinks quickly but my Ice-tea was yucky-strike 2-how do you screw up ice-tea.  I asked for a soda in exchange and he promptly exchanged the drink with no problems.  Our waiter was super friendly. So five stars for the service.

Kiddo had a grilled cheese, but the cheese was not melted-(strike 3), we took it back, got it back melted. We split the crab cake salad and it was okay, by that I mean it was edible.  Not digging the decoration on the plate (dried spaghetti sticks?) I didn't get it.  Also on the plate was a hard biscuit that was flavorless-a piece of paper would have tasted better.  Very disappointing.

The stand out was the cup of cream corn chowder-this gets five stars, honestly it was sooooo delish!!

I have to agree with other yelpers, the servings are disgustingly huge and so are many of the customers-there were plenty of linebackers at every table.  So if you've got a big appetite com here.

Another 5-Star was the jamming tunes-the place had awesome music!   Lots of pics on the wall of celebrity guests like Rachel Ray, Martha Stewart, etc. that was cool!

I think I may still come back and give it another try-maybe a new chef is in order.",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,6,3,3,7HURbVDOESvbZwu8S2pbaQ

Service was fast and attentive, nothing to complain about there. It's the kind of breakfast that makes the world seem right again. If you're in Vegas you need to try this place.

The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it's SO hard to find.

I'm sure Hash House A Go Go got a nice surge after being featured on Man vs. Food and the gratuitous plug from Adam Richman (who has one of the coolest jobs in the world by the way).  But me?  I dunno, I'm not overly impressed.  It's kind of middle of the road for myself.

I'm a good eater...and at Hash House A Go Go they do serve BIG FOOD!  Portions are ginormous and meals often come out on platters the size of a small hubcap.  You will almost always leave with a little doggie bag of leftovers!  Alas, for me the flavors of the food doesn't particularly sing to my palette.  It just seems like you're going to a chain restaurant with lots of chain restaurant food, and it all just kinda tastes the same.  Not bad, but not standout great.  When you combine the muted flavors with the high prices I have no choice but to knock you down a star or two.

But perhaps this is my fault.  People rave that this place is a great deal for breakfast, when they showcase the best things to have at Hash House.  I ended up going for dinner so maybe my review is somewhat off-kilter.  But I gotta go off of what we ate, and it pains me to say it but it was all average.

We shared Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower ($18).  I saw pics of this platter online and thought we gotta have that.  In all?  It was ok.  The fried chicken was hot and juicy, but I couldn't get into the batter they dip it in.  It was a tad on the thick side and got in the way of the chicken.  Also, the flavor was just bland, bland, bland.  Not spicy, savory, or sweet like a decent fried chicken.  It was very plain.  The waffles stuffed with whole strips of bacon?  Impressive, but again off in it's flavors.  The smoked bacon was delicious on its own, but the waffle needed some seasoning that the hot maple reduction couldn't offer.  The waffle was nice and crisp and chewy on the inside though like a waffle should be.

We also shared one of Andy's Twisted Stuffed Burgers ($15).  The one we got had roasted beef, smoked mozzarella, and charred tomato in it.  It came out in a HUGE stack which of course made it near impossible to eat.  I had to cut it into tinier portions just to pick it up!  Doing this made my stuffed burger very uneven in the tasting.  I had a hard time getting to meld a bite that included all the fixings in the burger.  And by the time I finally got to eat my burger the juices from the patty made my bottom bun extra SOGGY.  I hate that.  And again, the flavors just seemed subdued somehow.  No zip, no zing, no tang, no mas!  It really just struck me as an average burger.  I've honestly had a better one for less money.  Will this be the first place I suggest use a dash of MSG in their food?  However, the fries were crisp and delicious. 

Speaking of sharing...there will be none of it had unless you like being charged for it!  Seriously, you get charged a $4-5 fee if you are sharing one plate.  It seems a bit highway robbery if you ask me...serve me a too large portion of so-so food then punish me if I want to share?  I can see why obesity rates are high in the US.  So your best bet here is to order two plates of food (or an entree and a large side) if you're a couple and avoid that dumb fee altogether.  You will just have more leftovers to take home.  

Speaking of leftovers...we left Hash House with 3 (yes 3) containers of food for the ride home!  I indeed ate all I could and left full, but not satisfied.  A few hours later I decided on some of the leftovers for a midnight snack but again was met with the mediocre.  My leftovers didn't hold up well at all!  Fried chicken was soggy (and still bland), and the burger had gone on the rubbery side.  I was too disappointed thinking about throwing away all this food so I ended up eating it anyway.  Not one of my finer moments.

The main reason why I still give a 3 1/2 star here was because of the service.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant, and kept our drinks filled without much fuss.  She had some mad strong forearms too, defined!  Must be from all the heavy duty platter lifting going on there.

Hate to say it Hash House A Go Go, but I think if I ever try this place again it will be for breakfast or brunch.  Please work on seasoning your food!  Thanks, k bye!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,kixt9xJrWi7powDsIlhyAg

The food: First of all I was very happy to see we were given a full menu. We could order anything even breakfast. The biscuits with honey butter (free appetizer) shouldn't even be served. They were hard and crumbled hardly warm and definitely not worth eating. Just really pretty to look at. My crab cake sandwich was delicious! His stuffed burger want really what we expected. It's not really a stuffed patty as we were thinking it just a burger with a lot of add-ons. He wasn't that impressed with it. My plate had a small amount of fries where his plate had a good amount. The prices are very reasonable! Definitely a plus.

The service: we were seated right away. Then giving this while run down on filling out a card and getting a free meal and a free meal for birthdays. The server was nice but either had too much going on or just not very good at multi tasking. He told us he was bringing out biscuits for an appetizer. We got kinda upset waiting for that. Finally he walks by and says the biscuits are coming out soon they are being made hot and fresh. They ended up bringing out the biscuits with the meal. So a fail there. Then it turned out to be a lie. They were far from fresh. When we finished our meal we waited quite a while before seeing our server again and when we did he just brought us our check. We were going to order dessert to go but got over it as soon as he did that.

4054667,2012-11-24,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This review update is not for the actual restaurant, but for their Thanksgiving Dinner To-Go.

Thanksgiving was held at my house this year.  Instead of spending X amount of hours preparing, cooking, and stressing, I chose to order my turkey from Hash House.  The food here is good so picking the Hash House was a no brainer. 

Hash House Thanksgiving Dinner (To-Go):  Cost $98.99.  
-Deep Fried Turkey (8-10 lb):  My first deep fried turkey.  Initially thought it was small since I'm use to a 15+ pounder for Thanksgiving.  When it came down to it, it was enough to feed 9.  Turkey was good and surprisingly juicy.  Only issue, no leftovers.

-Garlic Mashed Potatoes (32 oz):  Real stuff, non of that powder Idaho Spuds that you get in the box.  

-Pumpkin Mashed Potatoes (32 oz):  Tested by most of us, but we didn't enjoy it as much as the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. My opinion, pumpkin dosen't mix well with traditional mashed potatoes. 

-Cornmeal Stuffing (40 oz):  My favorite during Thanksgiving has always been the stuffing.  Throw some gravy on it and it's perfect.  Huge servings. 

-Fresh Creamed Corn (16 oz):  So good and wish this was bigger.  Family killed it on the first round. 

-Buttermilk Biscuits:  6 huge pcs and I mean huge.  Biscuits on Steroids!!  

-Snickers or Pumpkin Pie (6 pcs):  I chose the Snickers, which was a mistake.  Don't get me wrong, it was sweet and delish.  But pumpkin pie shouldn't be replaced during Thanksgiving.  My bad and ended up going to Smiths to get one.  

Other trimmings that I didn't include was their baby carrots, cranberry sauce, strawberry jam, and gravy.  

Obviously, there's some prep and cook time needed on Thanksgiving day.  Along with the meal comes detailed instructions.  When I say detailed, I mean detailed to the time it takes and what you should cook in order.  If I can follow the instructions, anybody can. 

Nothing beats a home cooked meal and I know this.  This year I wanted a stress free Thanksgiving.  You get a lot for $98.99, but most importantly you will be able to spend more time relaxing with family over cooking all night. 

Overall, I give Hash House 4 stars for making me look like the Master Chef this Thanksgiving Day.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,5,2,4,AHMk7I2k4sWghKlPKN8cKA

4063472,2012-08-06,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This review is for the restaurant as a whole and not specifically this location. My friends and I were in town for a birthday and on the way back to California, we decided to stop by at the Hash House A GoGo that was at the M Resort. I've always wanted to try this place due to the fact that i'm an avid Man vs. Food watcher. 

THE FOOD: the portions are fairly big so i would recommend sharing unless you've got a big appetite and know you are able to consume that much food. I sure wish i had shared my dish with some else. 
what we ordered (all very good dishes btw cause we tried each others dish): 
 - Farm Benedict: House smoked salmon w/ fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs
 - The Basic: Two egg breakfast any style, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham)
 - French Toast: Griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup
 - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit 
 - Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger: Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar

I thought that the food was pretty rich in the sauces and quite heavy. I'm not much of a breakfast eater but i did enjoy my meal here. Although i did have to take a good amount of it to go. 

PRICES: each dish is about 15 dollars ( unless you get the basic breakfast/brunch dishes, which are about 9 dollars) It isn't too bad as compared to the rest of the prices from restaurants on the strip in Vegas.  

SERVICE: I have to rate the service at the M Resort location to be a 2.5. Our server/waiter was one of those who you could just tell hated his job and as a result it showed in his performance and the service that was provide to my party of 8 was not that great. He even dropped a fork on my friend as he was clearing the table and said ""shit man i'm sorry"" in my opinion, that is very unprofessional. from my work experience i know the importance of excellent customer service and i definitely did not feel it here. BUT the food was pretty good and I was in good company so i was willing to over look that slight annoyance 

OVERALL. i recommend you all to try it at least once. :) Check out the photos i posted too to see the dishes that my table ordered!",lWJWzPZnM7arQ03QuMXPnw,2,1,3,rHpewcRhm5eW3kpDn6kkeg

However, I was disappointed because of their dim lighting, their $2 charge sharing fee, their slow service, their thick and heavy pancakes, the dry chicken, and the subpar chicken salad sandwich.  Plus, I really wanted to order a dessert drink but they were all around $10!!!

I've heard so much about this place from T.V. and family. And it really lives up to it's name. Even the drinks are amazing. The watermelon kiwi lemonade (just the name alone makes my mouth water) was so good I had to have two of them. The food is not only huge it's actually good. I had the sage fried chicken and waffles and could only eat half. The table where we sat I could see all the dishes that came from the kitchen and they all looked and smelled so good.

4074713,2014-05-11,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This place has great food. I took my two girls for breakfast on Mother's Day. We got there right when they opened, so we didn't have to wait long...but it was quite busy by the time we left. 

I ordered the chicken and asparagus hash. It was well seasoned and the potatoes and asparagus were perfectly tender. It comes with two eggs, made to order, a large biscuit and some fresh fruit. My oldest daughter ordered the grilled cheese, and my younger wanted the bacon waffles. Both were pleased, and I was happy that their prices were reasonable. No more than $5 for a kids meal (which were also generously portioned). 

A few things threw me off a little. First, I ordered my kids a bowl of fresh berries and whipped cream (it was an extra $1 to have the cream whipped...). There were two strawberries but mostly melon and orange slices. If I had known it was fruit and not berries, I probably wouldn't have ordered since I know my kids don't like cantaloupe. Also, I saw a bunch of fun looking drinks getting served to all of the tables around us. No one ever offered us a drink menu and I had no idea that they had so many fun drink options. It would have been nice to enjoy the juice I ended up ordering BEFORE my meal. I also wouldn't have wasted money on an iced tea (which wasn't great. I'm a bit of a tea snob though). So if you're not offered a drink menu, be sure to ask for one. The fresh kiwi watermelon lemonade was delicious! It came served with a big slice of watermelon on the glass. 

With the exception of my server, who wasn't rude but wasn't excited to be working, everyone was warm and pleasant. My girls had a good time tasting all of the fun food, and we will be back.",GmzwysGSE-gh0-RgG1_QNA,0,0,4,1dAF6ugqz9uu0zbObbE_vg

As mentioned by almost everyone else, Hash House has HUGE portions.  I can't say that this is pro in my book but at the same time it isn't con.  I've had some very good meals there which would be worthy of 4 stars, but I've also had more than a few 2 star meals and it isn't always consistent with each dish.

A big part of why my friend likes it is likely because he orders the Cobb Salad every time, which is in fact very good.  For those who crave variety, the rest of the menu can be a real shot in the dark on quality and I've had some of almost everything.

The inconsistency makes it tough to form an opinion on specific dishes, and were I allowed I'd give this a 3.5 star rating, but 4 seems too forgiving.

Worth a try in my book, especially if you like Cobb Salads.",QXk9phQ0wgGuSqla-CHlqQ,0,0,2,Y7XciOZppqeYz-TmVSs2fg

Correct - the portions are unnecessarily huge. 
I think the flavor is unique in a lot of the dishes. I like their famous Benedict and the chicken and waffles with the maple sage reduction was also really good. The french toast is really great too - but I'm a sucker for fried bananas - so I feel those make that dish. 

The staff is nice - the food came out quickly - the wait wasn't too crazy (and I'm usually there on weekends) - and the prices are more than fair. 
This may seem weird but the stainless steel tables are freezing - like 'uncomfortable to put your hands' on freezing. And the decor is okay but I don't know if it's that ""trendy"". The decor reminds me of a barnyard version of Chipotle. But who cares - its about THE FOOD - and the food is really good.

FAVORITE: Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. I could have easily spent my entire life not knowing that chicken & waffles were SUPPOSED TO BE THAT DAMN GOOD! (Sorry Mom!) The mashed potatoes are STUPID GOOD too. My son ordered a pancake (either blueberry or cranberry & walnut) that was as big as a Domino's medium-sized pizza. JUST WAY BETTER! The look on his face when it was brought to the table said it all.

YES IT'S CROWDED PEOPLE!!! When something is this GOOD, people tend to show up in large numbers and then they want to stick around to enjoy all that buttery goodness. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. SOME THINGS WILL NEVER CHANGE. When the food stops being good and the service turns for the worse, there won't be as many people in front of you. Then there won't be as many good reviews because bad service & good food rarely coexist anwyere in the world.

Thanks Bin Laden! :-P

I've never had any issues. Probably because I'm a fan of the food. If I know we're going there, I'm prepared to wait because it's well worth it.

I ordered the 16 oz bone in rib eye steak from my waitress and requested cheddar bacon mashed instead of the sweet potato mashed. After she left I realized she didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked ,so I got up and advised her by the kitchen. When my waitress returned she advised me they weren't going to charge me extra for the change order this time, but in the future it will be $4.95 extra. Overall the food was yummy - steak was cooked medium rare as requested, sides of carrots and asparagus were included and even slices of prosciutto were a added touch. The cheddar covered bacon mashed was delish and included two full size strips of bacon! 

After completing my meal my waitress dropped the bill and and I reviewed it but she charged me the $4.95 extra charge for the Cheddar mashed - WTH? What was also disturbing was she didn't ask me if I wanted dessert. I advised her I wanted the banana cheesecake - It was huge but flat tasting. After a few bites I left the balance and advised the waitress. She said she would advise the chef but when she returned with my bill I was charged $2.75 for coffee which I didn't order.  I pointed this out to my waitress and she took the bill and readjusted the tab again.

Yes, you get huge servings and will almost always have leftovers to bring home, which is a plus, but not enough to make me a diehard HH fan.  My complaint would be that the food doesn't have a ton of flavor.  I have had a lot of different items that always sound good, look beautiful, and have great presentation, but almost always the food is lacking flavor.  Everything is bland to me.  I always have to add a ton of salt, pepper, hot sauce, syrup, or something to add some flavor.  I love chicken and waffles in general, but the chicken here is always lacking seasoning. I do think the Kokomo sandwich is quite tasty though!

4142887,2015-09-22,4,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I live in Southern California and have been meaning to try the Hash House in San Diego, but I never had the opportunity.  When I arrived in Vegas, I realized that there are a handful of these around, so I had to try it.  I of course got the chicken and waffles.  When my food came out, I was wowed by the presentation.  Looks totally amazing and over the top.

First bites of fried chicken and fried leeks were very tasty.  The first quadrant of the waffle was also pretty good.  But then, it just got overwhelming.  The chicken is unevenly cut, so certain parts of the chicken were overcooked, the center was good, but obviously not as crispy.  The waffles were on the soggier side - I like my waffles crunchy.  The batter was a little too chewy for my taste as well.  And the syrup was just decent.  A nice pat of butter would have helped.  Personally, my favorite part of the dish was the fried leeks.

Coming from Southern California, of course I have had some great chicken and waffles - Roscoe's, hello!  Roscoe's blows Hash House out of the water in terms of the chicken and waffles as separate entities and as an entire well constructed dish as a whole.  I only ate one piece of fried chicken and two squares of the waffle, not because I was full, but because it was just so overwhelming.  The chicken and waffle both sogged up a little too fast and I decided that it would taste pretty similarly if re-heated in the microwave the next day (I was right).  I actually went home and ate a second dinner because this meal left much to be desired.

There was something about it when I walked in, where it overwhelmingly smelled of heavily delicious breakfast foods. I'm usually a big fan of chicken and waffles back at home so I found it fitting to order the Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles.

I definitely hate to compare to Roscoe's but HH takes a different approach. I was given 4 pieces of fluffy waffles and two chicken breast pieces for a really decent price too for what it was. I did enjoy my meal, but something about it made me really want the waffles to be thinner and just the use of heavy butter and grease for flavor. (oh yeah, and portions where huge!)

I understand that it was a NY Times favorite and that it was featured on Man vs. Food. It was probably a hit or miss deal ordering the chicken and waffles, but the rest of the items on the menu had looked really good as well. 

Something really wants me to give this place a chance.

So after checking out the reviews here on Yelp, we decided to give Hash House a try.
And we are very glad we did, it was fantastic!  I love the inside of the place and the vibe: very diner-y and upbeat.  We were seated immediately even tho it was noon on a weekday.  The service was good, we had about 3 different people taking care of us.  I appreciate that when servers are busy and their fellow servers help them out instead of just leaving the patrons hanging.  
Anyway, we both ordered the Tractor Driver combo with the Griddled French Toast, eggs, sausage and bacon.  Plus coffee of course.  We both ate almost everything on our huge plates.  So we had lunch there about 12:30 today, it's now almost 6:30 p.m. and neither of us is hungry yet.  Well worth the $13 or so per plate (which I think is perfectly reasonable).  The French Toast was the perfect consistency and I loved it.  Everything else was just as good!
I was so-so on the coffee but I prefer my coffee to be weak.  My husband, who likes his coffee to be as strong as possible (when I think it tastes like dirt on the bottom of a used ash-tray, he's happy :)) enjoyed it very much, even asked what the brand is.  Also, other minor points deducted for having to ask (and then wait briefly) for more silverware and napkins, then extra syrup.  Would give a 4.5 stars if Yelp! would let me!

Service was friendly and portions are large. Not sure if the deejay is there all the time, but he was there Saturday, and boy was it annoying. There didn't seem to be a place in the restaurant where the music was quieter. We could not have a conversation for the entire meal. If this is a technique to insure quick turnover of tables they succeeded on our table. I think we were in and out in less than 30 minutes. 

We ordered a scramble with sundried tomatoes (me) and the grilled cheese sandwich for my friend. Both seemed more manageable than the massive portions of the waffles and chicken, or the wheel-sized pancakes. My scramble was OK, the grilled potatoes got cold halfway through the meal. Best part of the meal was the biscuit. My friend appreciated the grilled cheese sandwich but could only eat half and took the rest home in a box. 

With tip this meal was about $40. I guess you got to go here at least once to see if all of the hubbub from TV is worth it for you. Perhaps without the loud music I may have enjoyed it more. For me, the deejay and heavy base ruined the experience. I like to enjoy my food not having to feel the base of the music in my chest.

It tasted so fresh and the chicken was moist and full of flavor. The biscuit was no afterthought either. Each table had what I think was a fresh strawberry rhubarb preserve to top your biscuit with.

They serve big portions so don't come here unless you plan on eating - a lot. Otherwise, it's a terrible waste of food. I hope they are part of a food composting program.

The Boston Hash special, which had potatoes and peppers topped with a big Maryland blue crab cake and a spicy remoulade sauce, was a different combination. The crab flavor came through, but was a bit mushy. The scrambled eggs were good and not rubbery. It also came with a very good biscuit. The corned beef hash was simpler than the Boston hash with long strings of beef mixed with cheese on top of potatoes. It also came with the same scrambled eggs and big biscuit.

This is not an old school diner, but an updated version. For example, I had a very nice tangerine juice. Divey diners don't serve fresh juice - let alone tangerines. But let's be clear, it's still diner food. I think customers are overly fascinated with the portion size and ignoring the quality of the food. Take the Boston Hash I had. It had a soft crab cake, soft potatoes, soft peppers, soft eggs, and a soft biscuit. If a texturally-challenged dish like this was served at a Michelin-starred restaurant, it would get ripped apart by unhappy customers as being mushy baby food.

I was tempted to order their 1-pound burger. But hey, it's ONE POUND! That's ridiculous. And this is coming from a guy who, the night before, weighed 148.4 pounds before going to dinner, ate and drank at four places, and then weighed 152.4 pounds after dinner.

After a short wait of approximately 25 minutes, my wife and I were seated in the bar area. This location is HUGE with lots of space, and every inch is needed since it gets really busy. The bar area was fine for dining, but the music was a bit too loud for a Saturday morning; I'm usually not one to complain about loud music, but I honestly couldn't hear my wife who was sitting two feet away from me over the blaring music. 

The service was pretty decent and our waitress was prompt and attentive considering how busy she was. The folks at Hash House A Go Go definitely have character (and dress up as various characters like Wonder Woman and Superman), but also do their jobs well. 

The service gets 4 stars, but I cannot justify giving this place a thumbs up because their food is underwhelming. The food runner needed both arms and a lot of strength to deliver our meatloaf hash. The meatloaf hash along with the chicken and waffles were enough to feed to a family of four...but we both gave it the old college try and dug right in. The chicken and waffles were big, but only in quantity; they certainly were not big in either flavor or taste. Putting two whole chicken breasts and mixing bacon into the waffles sounds nice in theory, but the execution here is poor. The meatloaf hash didn't fare much better, as it tasted like what I would imagine soylent green to taste like; just a blob of flavorless food once you put together all the components.

I ordered one of the hashes which was brought promptly in a ten inch cast iron skillet.

It was our second trip to Vegas that sealed it for me.  I ordered the scrambles with sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese.  This is one of my all time favorites, I will eat sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese on anything, but it felt special mixed into my egg plate that was complete with a biscuit and home fried potatoes.  As a side I had to have their bacon.  The word straight from the owner's mouth was that it comes from a company that has been in business at least a hundred years and was chosen on its merit of being some of the nicest honey cured bacon in the land.  I'm sold.  

Did I mention you could wear one of their flapjacks as a helmet and tie it under your chin?  Yep, they are as big as your fat head.  

Hash House a Go Go has hundreds of reviews but I'm fairly certain I am the first to suggest wearing their food as protective gear.

So, there were 4 of us and we decided to get 2 dishes and split it. Thank goodness we did because those plates were GINORMOUS! We got the Griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup ($12.95) and Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit ($15.95). Both were really good. 

The french toast was surprisingly light and not too sweet, which I liked. it was topped a banana what was sliced in half and grilled. It looked really pretty when we opened up the box. The sage chicken was amazing too. Fried well and really flavorful. It was a very heavy breakfast, but it didn't feel that heavy. I would totally go there again to try other things on the menu.",sbQCjAGags-IFKZEwlNWWQ,0,0,4,WW0i1X1fy58kAzulDOCYJw

My second favorite dish is the grilled cheese with avocado, each slice of bread is close to 2 inches thick, and that's amazing in my book.

The second best thing is the drink menu, which has all sorts of amazing drinks that are basically desserts in their own right- hot chocolate, flavored coffee and cappucinos, etc.  I don't drink alcohol, so it's always nice to see a drink menu with special items that I can actually enjoy.",eD2YmdHwXmns0fI9NEOByQ,0,0,5,jKjMt_rROcYFxsrNt6bjLQ

But I was in Vegas and a friend had suggested we go there for brunch. It was a weekday and it was pretty crowded but we only had to wait ~15 minutes for a table for three. Hash house a go go is a really fun place to eat, the portions here are ridiculously huge. 

I've had their slapjacks and smoked salmon benedict before but was feeling a little adventurous and wanted to try something new. Staying in the smoked salmon realm, we got the smokes salmon scramble (with no cheese) and it was really good. I love smoked salmon for brunch. I was sharing with my boyfriend and we decided to get another plate, so he picked the roasted chicken house hash. The chicken in the hash was kind of dry, which made it really difficult to finish. Our friend who was eating with us had the meatloaf hash, I had a few bite of that and wished we ordered that instead... 

The drinks here were really good, we had the whole of the moon which is basically an espresso affogato and the kiwi watermelon lemonade. Definitely recommend getting!!",dh_2BNnKPlvp3OW3TLTDNQ,0,2,4,IVGuUO-6UIs5gAHU4cOuKQ
4200075,2015-02-28,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"First off, let me tell you, I have been coming  to Hash House a Go Go for years. 
I think their policy on ""no substitutions"" is ridiculous. They will take something out, but will not put anything in, it has to be on the side, with a huge up charge. Supposedly they want to protect their precious recipes. Like adding something the customer wants will make the meal worse?
Their portions have gotten smaller, while the prices have gotten bigger. 
Our server, Derek L, was the worst server I have ever seen. He was in a rush to get people's orders, and get them out. It's all about turn over for him I guess. Every time we asked for something, it seemed like it was a burden for him to do his job. His personality sucked, he needs better communication and people skills if he wants to make good tips in this business. My water  cup was filled with all ice and never refilled. My mother's endless coffee was also never refilled and when she asked for a to go cup, he responded ""I suppose I can get that for you"" brought it to the table and said ""I am supposed to charge you for that, but since I already dropped off the check..."" 
How can you charge again for coffee if it's endless?
I hope those that read this realize there are much better restaurants out there that will be more than happy to substitute and give friendly serve with out the high cost.",KIWOGq0i_LrLLIVGgcDUWQ,2,0,1,j2XOc_qilK5tbPwKGQEFVg

I'm pretty much a traditional boring person when it comes to food. I like the simpler flavor versus the crazy unique flavors. Whenever I am here I order the corned beef hash which is definitely one if my favorites. Tender corned beef with skillet potatoes and Swiss cheese on top. I'm a cheesy girl and that cheese as weird as it may sound actually pairs well with it. I actually have ordered something off the special menu as well.  The crab cake Benedict on Mother's Day was pretty dang tasty. There was real crab and the crab vs. batter/filling ratio was about 2:1. It came with spinach and a spicy sauce (spicy to me) which was delicious. 

I've ordered drinks from HHAGG before and although good it's just too much. Their famous hot chocolate is huge! It's awesome but when I eat salty foods I like to drink the plain old H20.

All in all, we were all disappointed in our dishes. The food had little to no flavor to them. They looked amazing, but tasted terrible for what you paid for. The salad was pretty much a simple salad with a piece of bland fried chicken thrown on top of it. The burger had no flavor to it at all. The fried chicken on my waffles were also flavorless.

We had a table of people across from us walk out after complaining to the waiter about how bad the food was. I didn't think the food was THAT bad, but I don't think I ever want to come back here.

4261792,2015-02-09,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I have a theory that people believe that a place is good because the portion sizes are huge. I have found that to be true in a lot of cases where people rave about a place and then I see the gigantic dishes pouring out the kitchen and realize I have been duped by excessism. I much prefer to have my taste buds wowed than to have my stomach full of simple mush. 

I found this place to fit exactly under that theory. I have been meaning to try this place out for a while and many people have recommended it to me. When some friends came to town that wanted to try it out, we hopped over there for a Saturday brunch. 

The wait to get a table was not long but we waited at the actual table for a good 10 minutes before getting acknowledged. There were even bills on the table with cash in them from the previous guests that the hostess said she was not allowed to handle which was mind-boggling. That policy makes it ok to allow perfect strangers that may be dishonest sit with the  waiter's tip on the table. Well, alright. 

It was fairly busy with people rushing around. We had one waiter greet us in passing and say he would be right with us. We never saw him again. Did his shift end?  We will never know. We then had a woman come by and ask us for our drinks and she took our drink orders. She looked like more of a manager than a waitress due to her difference in uniform. She was able to take the money-filled bill folders off the table as well. I ordered a Bloody Mary which took a very long time to get (even after everyone else received their drinks). 

Finally, our waiter came by to ask us what we wanted to drink. When we told him that we had already placed our drink orders, he stalked off looking mad while we sat there feebly saying ""but we are ready to place the food order"" which fell on deaf ears. When some of our drinks were deposited, we again feebly mentioned that we wanted to order food. She seemed sort of surprised and walked away but then took our order. Our regular waiter served our food but we never got straws and we were never really checked on during our meal. I understand that it was a fairly busy place but it had more of an air of disorganization than them not being able to handle it being busy.

Once we received our food, it was just overall--standard. Huge, yes. But the actual taste was on par with any sort of breakfast place. I had the chicken and waffles (stacked about 8 inches high). I liked the bacon in the waffles and I enjoyed the fried leeks in the dish as it added an extra flavor competent. Everyone else at the table felt their meal was standard/ and or adequate. 

A fun little thing happened when we were eating though. Dee Snider of Twisted Sister fame came in to the restaurant to eat. It gave me a little laugh that this restaurant is billed as ""twisted farm food"" as well. Twisted sister, twisted farm food. Heh. 

But overall, my rating is so low because I had much higher expectations for this place. I am not a fan of large portions of standard food (especially at that price point as you can get large portions at Denny's for a fraction of the price of this place). . But I am also not a huge fan of disorganized service. Luckily I was with some great people and we didn't have anywhere to go after so we could afford the time, but it still left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,1,1,2,v_cAuzOxKSSg4Qj75z-tfw

4270786,2011-06-27,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This is one of my ""miss"" food adventure. Too bad because it was a belated Father's Day brunch for my dad. We still enjoyed it in good spirit, as nothing is direly bad - like fly in the food or we came down with food poisoning - none of that.  What we did though, me and my dad, for a good part of the time spent waiting for our orders was discussing how the decor of the restaurant missed the theme by a ten foot pole. My dad is a professional interior consultant for large scale resorts and casinos with experience more than my age. Anyway, that's probably only for the picky eyes.  I mean, the restaurant is clean, well lighted, good circulation and definitely meet the standard for an ""A"" restaurant. 

The Food: I will summarize it in 3 letters abbreviation: T.M.E {Too Much of Everything!!!!!}.  If it is to feed a farm worker who tills the field, rolls the hays, stacks pavements stones and whatever hard-manual-calorie-burning labors a farm worker does, then yes the portion is sufficient. But for a paper pusher, computer staring, sitting on your butt all day, going everywhere with cars folks for whom a distance between 1 parking space closer to the storefront is like a matter of life and death, the portion is a little bit much. I'm being sarcastic. Honestly, the portion is waaaaaaaay too much! Hello, people??? Is the coffee they served not thick enough to wake you up that you can see the mound of food in front of you?? Literally the food was stacked up and jabbed through with a big knife. Cool to see, cringe to think that the plate is for one person... ... I can only roll my eyes as people shovel at least half of the plates into their mouths.  Hey, I like to eat and indulge here and there. Regardless of my size. But this is off the chart.

The taste: Double word: ""so-so""  (is it considered one word?) Nothing special here, folks, Move along! To quote the description of the stars rating ""Meh. I've experienced better."" And I have. Plenty times different other places. Does it taste bad? To be fair, not really. Was it excellent? I really won't go that far! 

My suggestion if you want to eat here:
Treat this place like a family style dining, where you share the food. The more people you have in the party the better. 

For example: The specialty flapjacks can serve 4-6 easy. The hash can serve 2 if you don't order anything else, and 4 if you order the pancakes or waffles. 

We brought home the flapjack that morning, with the toasts, and we were full all the way until 7:30pm (that was a 10 hour filling breakfast!). Perhaps I should add 1 star for it's economical value? .. Nah :p",dYUsY1q6VISy46Q1hxQeBA,1,0,2,c5rWVoFktC1c9tDDFOGFAQ

There was a few people who got there 20mins after us and were seated the same time as we were... that kind of annoyed me especially since our ""party"" was 2 adults and 1 child compared to others who were 4 or more. At the beginning I was asked if my son who is 5 wanted a high chair or booster I said no he could sit in a normal seat... he's not a baby and is old enough and tall enough to sit in a regular chair. Well low and behold when our thing rang the host tells us she though I wanted a high chair and if I didn't there would be more of a wait. WTF?! After waiting 50mins (which was only supposed to be 30) you want me to wait longer because the host doesn't listen?

We just went with the highchair which my son DOES NOT fit in... but do you think they offered a normal chair? NO. Ugh. So the server comes and takes our order and we see the bigger parties get seated 2mins after we were... now I'm like super irritated... but I'm still super nice and what not.

I understand there is a wait for food, but ONCE AGAIN the parties who ordered AFTER we did got their food first... ours came 10 mins later. Wait, my friends got here then 10mins after that I got mine. Seriously? Who wants to sit there and eat after everyone on your table get their food?

He ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich. His food looked good, and finally after my food came I was wayyyy too irritated to even try it. Instead I pulled out my phone and typed this long rant/review.
The chicken and waffles were ok, nothing orgasmic and the sandwich was horrible and tasteless. I had to add hella salt and cut the piece of pork into 4's. Some people like the ""huge"" portions, but I dont. Why are you going to give me a huge oily breaded piece of pork and a standard sized bun? What am I supposed to eat the rest of the sandwich with? Ugh.

The waitress was wayy nicer to my guy friend than she was to me, even though I was the nice one. Beesh!

Showed up at exactly 730am (when it opened) to beat the rush, since it's off the strip and somewhat off the beaten path (especially for a Saturday morning). 

Ordered a nitro coffee and the tractor combo (2 eggs, sausage/bacon/potatoes and choice of flap jack, waffle, or French toast), with poached eggs, sausage, and French toast. From the initial conversation, they don't have many things with peanuts, but do have some menu items with pecans and cashews (which is fine for me, but those with severe nut allergies should bring this up ASAP so the staff can best help you). I was somewhat torn between the Chicken and waffles (at $18.99 it's pricey, but apparently a New York Times favourite) and the Tractor combo (cheaper, at $13.99, but also, customizability is king), but ultimately customizing my experience won out. If I come here tomorrow morning I'll definitely order the Chicken & Waffles. 

Decor is quite nice; quite homely feel with plenty of variable-sized booths (2 sized, 4 sized, and 6 sized at a quick glance). 

Nitro coffee and water arrived after only 5 minutes (ordered at the same time as food); the coffee was great tasting - not too bitter, but a good amount of flavour - a welcome wake-up coffee to start the day. Food arrived after 18 minutes.

Some quick ratings, based on my usual template:

1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 9/10. Lots of selection, but the menu was all over the place in terms of what went where. It was difficult to follow the process of what you received with what item, since all of the sections were different font sizes, in different shapes, with different prices. 

2) FRESHNESS: 9/10. The poached eggs and French toast were fine; sausage seemed reheated, banana peel was too chewy for me (either too ripe or stale, unsure which at this point). 

3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10/10. Portion sizes are extremely generous; I didn't end up finishing all of the French toast but I was able to eat everything else. 

4) SERVICE: 10/10. Fast, attentive service. Drink and food came within 20 minutes and all questions were answered promptly. 

5) PRICE: 9/10. It's a little on the higher side, but given what you get, I'm not necessarily complaining.",qs5lmdygjQGACmO9DbullA,2,0,5,xQ3Oj1WzVLfFgtIZ_-GFyQ

The atmosphere is nice.  The music is a little loud and clubbish.  It seriously sounded like house music.  My 3 year old nephew kept ""fist-pumping"" to it.  It didn't bother me, but it did bother others in our group.

Waitress was okay.  I ordered a basic breakfast and wanted my scrambled eggs ""country scramble"".  Most waitresses/waitors know what this means- she didn't.  I told her I wanted fresh eggs cracked then scrambled.  None of that egg from the carton stuff for me.  She said ""oh, we can't do that"".  Fine, but I just kept wondering why?  They don't have fresh eggs?  They'd have to if you wanted a fried egg, right?

Food came- eggs were good, while they were luke-warm(they got cold very fast so I don't think they were too hot to begin with).  They were also runny, which I do not like, so I only ate a few bites.  They were a little runny for all of us.   Pancakes were yummy and so were the potatoes.  Everyone liked their food.  It was good.  Was it worth $100 for 5 people.......not so sure about that.  I'm pretty sure we will not return for breakfast.  My husband would like to try their dinner though, so maybe we'd go back for that.

From arrival to consumption of said chicken benedict, we were only there for about an hour, which was great considering I was expecting to be waiting for at least one.

Being a die hard Man Vs. Food fan...I knew that Adam would not let me down. And boy oh boy.....

There were some moments where this place disappointed. For example, we tried to order their FAMOUS kiwi/watermelon lemonade?
They were out of kiwi. Then we moved on to the pistachio drink. Once again..out of pistachio. This wasn't even like late at night. This was at 12pm.

Portions here are out of this world. 5 girls shared 3 dishes and we still couldn't finish it all.
We even saw a table of all boys struggling with their individual dishes. YEAH! They are that big!

This place may be known for their fried chicken & bacon stuffed waffles...but aside from looks failed to wow me.
I found the chicken meat too dry and the skin too sweet. But that's just me.

What I do recommend is the chorizo hash. SOOO delicious and spicy!

I started writing yelp reviews because I love breakfast. Now that I have been to Hash House A Go Go I might weep like Alexander the Great because there are no more worthy breakfast places to conquer.

We arrived to a packed house on a thursday mid morning to a packed house. It is always busy. We sat at the bar and introduced ourselves to Randy the bartender, who was cool as hell. While he was super busy, he didn't give a hurry up vibe. 

My buddy Bear, (who has eaten Sayler's 72oz steak and fixings, making him my personal hero) stated he was hungry and order the fried chix eggs benedict and an additional waffle. Randy asked him if he was sure because that was going to be a lot of food.

Bear said 'I'm hungry"".

Randy said ""If you finish it all I will buy the waffle""

Line in the sand drawn, challenge accepted. 

The fried chick benny is awesome. Fried cheese. Biscuits. Mashed taters. Eggs. Something green. Heaven. I couldn't finish mine. 
One of the guys, Steve, had the most delecious smelling and looking plates of french toast I have ever witnessed complete with fried bananas on top. Indeed it was the Best French Toast Ever because we went back the next morning and I had it. 

Back to the Challenge. Bear gave it it a mighty attempt, eventually mixing all the waffle and benedict together and shoveling it in. In the end the waffle got the better of him. Randy said it is the farthest he has seen someone get. He asked Bear who should take the ticket for the Waffle. Like a trooper Bear said ""Right here. I couldn't do it""  I think Randy appreciated Bear's stand and bought the waffle anyway. It was awesome.

I asked the server what the popular items were and he mentioned the chicken and waffles and fried chicken benedict (I believe). He pointed the items out on nearby patrons plates and the portions were SO astronomically big that unfortunately they just didn't look appealing to me. I also notice the restaurant wastes a lot of food as the tables were being cleaned because the portions appear to be impossible to finish. Big portions = big waste. 

I ordered a simple breakfast platter with country potatoes, scrambled eggs, chicken sausage, and biscuit. Everything was just okay for my taste buds. The biscuit was too dense/heavy for my liking. However, the homemade strawberry preserves was amazing and may have been the best part of my meal. The service was just okay as well.

Upon first sight of this tower, I was reminded of Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters of the Third Kind when he built that mountain out of mashed potatoes.  The base was four huge waffles with bacon cooked into them.  Then came the fried chicken with a knife and spruce of something on top to hold the mountain together.  The maple reduction was drizzled all over the plate, and the fried leeks were surrounding the mountain.

This dish was really tasty.  It was a perfect balance between the sweet and savory.  The waffles were well prepared, and the bacon was tasty.  The chicken was crisp yet lightly fried and juicy.  And, as if the sweetness of the maple reduction and waffles and the savoriness of the fried chicken weren't enough, the crunchy leeks added another layer of texture and taste that caught me by surprise.

The first thing you notice about hash house are the gigantic portions. Often associated with vegas, big food is kind of a staple in the city but it is not always of the highest quality. I think I ate a hot dog for a buck that is still wreaking havoc in me. However, hash house offers dishes with flavor even bigger than the portions. Their waffles are a God send as they are light and fluffy and stuffed with bacon. The fried chicken is moist and succulent on the inside and popping with crunch and flavor on the outside. Their meat loaf is better than any granny will make (just don't tell them that). And their pancakes can be mistaken for blankets they're so big! 

Now with all that said, you'd think you would have to drop some serious coin on a breakfast or lunch this epic. That's where you're wrong! The food is so reasonably priced you almost feel guilty! Almost! For a massive meal that will keep you warm for days, you're probably looking at around 12-15 bucks. That's a bargain considering the quality and quantity of food you're getting.

And no....it's not a strip club with go-go dancers that serve you breakfast! (Even though I know it's Vegas and all).

So I've been to the San Diego location and really enjoyed the place.  When I found out there was one out in Vegas, I figured we must check it out. I was not disappointed!

As usual, the portions were humongo-licious! Pictures just can't describe the astonishment you feel when that plate arrives at your table.  I still feel this place is more about ""quantity"" than ""quality"" though.  But even so, HH is really good and a must place to visit. You do get your money's worth with the amount of food you get!

We had a large party and ordered a number of different dishes. There were lots of food, so we shared to try everything. The Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict was awesome and the blueberry pancake was so big it almost fell off the plate. I had the Andy's Chicken and Waffles which I totally enjoyed but what I really liked (and will probably order next time) is the French Toast.  It was topped with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup.  Aww man, that was bomb-diggy-diggy.

It's not just the size of the food, but the presentation was great too.  Some of the dishes looked so good, you weren't sure if you should eat it or just admire it for a bit. We ended up taking a few pics with our grub.

Props to our server who was awesome and very attentive. Took care of us well and was quick to refill our drinks.  Only thing I found weird was that there's no hash browns on the menu.  With a name like ""Hash"" House you'd think they'd have it.  My bro ordered the crispy potatoes thinking that was the same, but unfortunately it's not. Just crispified blocks of potatoes, which were still good anyway.  I may have the ask our server about the hash brown thing next time(and there will be a next time!)

Overall, I totally recommend coming here if you are in Vegas.  Prices are affordable and its so much better than many of the breakfast buffets in town.

Things are great when the twists are not too wicked (like the fairly straightforward chicken and waffles). However, some of their dishes are just a sin (salmon fried with a cornmeal crust was just a gross way to treat a fish). Service can be spotty - sometimes you feel they just fawn over you, other times it can like pulling teeth to get a glass of water. And is no one else annoyed by the odd fried vermicelli and sprigs of rosemary? 

As far as portions go, you'd be hard pressed to find larger portions in Vegas. But, I'd rather have a normal amount of great food over a huge amount of passable fare. There are so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I don't think I'll be venturing here again anytime soon.",d2tKNPeOUUYHWI2XbNyKMg,3,2,3,03ptLMawF8TVNwc1YXvUcA
4384507,2010-09-07,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"If size mattered, Hash House A Go Go would score stars off the charts.  If service mattered, it would get three stars.  If flavor mattered... well, there would be a slight dilemma. 

Let's start with first impressions.  Forget ""line was out the door,"" it was more like MOB surrounding the front patio.  Once inside, you're greeted with such a busy atmosphere (on a weekend, at least) - all the tables were seated, families and friends getting together for a breakfast-version of Thanksgiving.  If you haven't worked out those forearm muscles, not sure if this place would be for you.  Their plates are ginormous (yes, this word has been officially quantified due to the portion sizes at Hash House).  

I would like to invest in whatever machinery they use to squeeze the orange juice.  ""Fresh"" is an understatement.  That cup of orange juice is so amazing - it's as if someone took an orange, magically stirred up the juices inside an orange (without disturbing the peel), gave me a straw and offered me heavenly orange juice.  I was mesmerized by the juice, as I watched the pulp inside the glass, sway back and forth, taunting me with its citrusy-goodness, waiting for me to finish the entire cup, and ask for seconds or thirds.  I resisted - for I waited patiently for the food.  

It's hard to not turn heads every time a server came by with a plate.  Every plate looked like a mountain of food, with a twiggy-herb sticking up, followed by ""Holy gamoly, that plate is HUGE!""  Pancakes looked like they were used as blankets to keep the plates from getting cold.  If it's true that you eat with your eyes first, you better close your eyes before the plates arrive at your table - you'd be full just by watching the plates make their way to the tables! 

When the sage fried chicken and waffles showed up, I was amazed the table didn't tip over to one side.  The waffles piled against one another like mattresses, lending support the pieceS of fried chicken that sat so gallantly on top.  Once you cut into the waffles, bits of bacon are nestled inside the waffles, playing peek-a-boo, and tickles you with savory flavors to off-set the maple syrup, while making you yearn for the juicy fried chicken.  I'm telling you, it was all very well thought out.  Four out of five stars is fair. 

Second attempt - featured menu item: Nappanee Hash.  Potatoes, tomatoes, strips of beef, eggs, (and other ingredients that I cannot remember) all glued together by Smoked Mozarella.  The potatoes were nicely crisped around the edges, eggs were made to order, and tomatoes danced around the combination, teasing with freshness.  Among the different flavor combinations came the strips of beef.  Problem - they were just that: BEEF.  If we did role call, the character ""flavor"" would be followed by silence, because it was completely absent.  ""Tenderness?""  -- nice try.  That too, was absent.  Two out of five.  

As busy as I've seen this place, I would think that they would want more servers/waiters to make sure that the tables are flipped as quickly as possible.  Service is a little bit on the slow side - and this is not just applied to the busy days.  On a day where there were no more than 6-tables, it took two or three attempts before we could get the waiter's attention to place an order.  Three out of five.  

If you don't have much patience for long lines (on the weekends) or slower service, steer clear.  If you've got a big group of (hung-over) people looking for some not-so-fancy foods at big quantities and little price, you're in good hands at the Hash House.  If you're just tired of really watered down orange juices from the Poker tables at the Rio, just follow that holy-looking-glowing light to the Hash House A Go Go.",FgwrgJhwtzLOFy4lsfHsqw,0,0,3,-VFYbOCxvRVTr04PojN4UQ

4385260,2017-03-22,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Let me start by saying the food was delicious.  Unfortunately the service was not anywhere close to the level of the food.  It appeared there were 2 servers working this Tuesday night.  While my wife was in the bathroom I let our server know we were celebrating her birthday.  He assured me it wouldn't be a problem-the birthday waffle they provide would come out seamlessly after the meal. He said he would order it when we were nearing completion of our meals so it would come out right after dinner.  Well, after our server took our order I really didn't see him.  The other server brought our meals out, and the host cleared the plates.  After our plates were cleared it was 10 minutes before we saw our server (I'm guessing this is when the actual order for the birthday waffle was put in).  I told him we would have to forgo the birthday waffle because it was too long and the 7 year old was getting restless. He told me it was coming right out.  It was another 5 minutes before it arrived.  He dropped it on the table with the check without saying happy birthday or any thanks for coming in tonight.  He did say the waffle was on the house for the birthday celebration but he didn't seem very sincere.  I got the feeling he was a little perturbed that I questioned the length of time it took.
And I'm not positive but I thought every table was getting complimentary biscuits except for us.
Once again it, as well as the meal, was delicious but the lack of customer service definitely took away from the experience.  I'll still give it 4 stars because that's how good the food is.",y_BOmatu8v4AYjEwGx8QOA,0,0,4,N9Hih9Wu0yPRvLoSm01QQQ

Well I got the food and it was mostly breast but there were quite a few pieces of thigh in there.

$5 for a kiwi watermelon lemonade. Pricey but it was well worth it. You get a nice wedge of watermelon with it. Perfect if you're a little parched from the previous crazy night.

Warning! The portions here are massive. It's funny because when I first got seated, I walked by this huge table that were waiting for their tab. Two things I noticed was that everyone had a togo box in front of them. Second, everyone looked like they were sitting in that post-food coma stage mode (waiting to knock the f out!).

I had the fried chicken and waffles of course. I barely put a dent in this plate. Had to box up at least half of it. I don't know if it beats Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles but the amount of food sure was over whelming. Actually, everyone on my table did not finish their food, not even close. I felt like we were wasting so much food and that some poor kid in Mogadishu could've been feasting on our leftovers.

Unless you can chow down like no other, you might want to share a plate with someone rather than all order something individually. BTW, the flapjacks here are a size of an oldskool 99' Acura Integra GS-R stock rim.

First off, the pricing:  While none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.  

Second of all, portions:  Portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  They are gigantic.  Trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.

Quality:  Everything we've had here is top notch.  I'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  The drinks are creative and tasty.  It's hard to go wrong with this place.  That being said, here's what I've tasted thus far:

Mango Coconut Pancake:  This is bigger than your head.  Heck, it's bigger than the plate.  I think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  The thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  Soft, moist, and tender pancake.  

Roasted Chicken Hash:  Not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  The chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  This may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  I was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.

Crispy Pork Tenderloin Farm Benedict:  Here's the winner for me.  A gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of biscuits, mashed potatoes, with a benedict sauce over the top.  Spinach, scrambled eggs... I was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  Get this.  If you like fried pork tenderloin, you will LOVE this.

Smores Espresso:  Gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  Pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  Smores fan?  You'll be in love.

Hash House Bloody Mary:  I don't like bloody mary's.  But I order this one every time I'm here.  Great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (I'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  Definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.

Verdict:  While off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  Great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... I've added this to my list of places to go to whenever I visit Vegas.  Followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.

Protips - From the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  It sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  Also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees...",_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng,0,0,5,1CrnomRfmVyLdnk2o84PXg

4447350,2016-05-21,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"We are raving fans of Hash House a Go Go for their epic sized, flavorful food and always recommend it to visitors.  We like this location because of easy parking and it's mainly filled with locals.  Timing is everything.  Sometimes there is a long wait to be seated.

The last couple of times we've been here they have botched up part of my meal which has been disappointing.  Today, I ordered a scrambled dish and I found raw egg in my food (it looked like snot) which I brought to the Manager's attention.  She offered to replace the meal which was declined but did not give us the option to take a couple of dollars off the meal.

Unfortunately, we will not be back to this location.  We are going to have to suck it up on the Strip with the long walk from the parking station through a smoky casino and line of tourists to get consistent, well cooked meals.

Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade: pretty & tasty


FOOD:

SERVICE:

The wait was not as long as i thought it would be, maybe because it was too early to be awake in Vegas? :/ 

The wait staff was nice, friendly, and very helpful.  When your waiter tells you, YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT TO SHARE, listen to them!!!

4448042,2014-01-14,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Ohhh Hash House, this place is a must-stop every time I'm in Vegas. I wish they had locations closer to me, I would go ALL THE TIME! They have a good variety of food and HUGE portions. Seriously, do not underestimate their portion sizes! One of my friends and I shared one of the meals here and not only were we both stuffed, but we also had enough leftovers to eat as another meal later on! 

Things my group got:
- Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict
This thing is delicious and has a little bit of everything, mashed potatoes, chicken, eggs, tomatoes, spinach, bacon, mozzarella, biscuits, and chipotle cream sauce all over it. YUM!

- Chicken & Waffles
My friends got this and liked it a LOT. I tried a bite and since I'm not a chicken & waffles fan, I wasn't too into it. I think that's just me though. Everyone else at my table disagreed and said it was really good!

- Mushroom & Swiss Burger
My friend who got this was a little disappointed that it wasn't a 1 lb patty, but instead divided into 2 patties. He said it was good/okay, and I tried the fries which were seasoned well and tasty. He wishes he had gotten something that Hash House is more known for (like the two dishes above).

- Watermelon kiwi lemonade
Wow this drink was BOMB! Apparently, our server told us that it was voted ""best drink in Vegas,"" at which point, my friends and I all turned to each other and were like, isn't that the Fat Tuesday??? Anyways, he totally sold us on the drink and we got three of them. Wow, he was not kidding, it was soooo good. The drink comes in a glass which has the flavors layered, with the red watermelon on the top, yellow lemonade in the middle, and green kiwi on the bottom. It's also garnished with a slice of watermelon on the rim of the glass. Definitely looked really pretty and Instagram-worthy, if you want to take pictures. ;) When you're ready to drink, make sure to mix it up first. It tasted really refreshing and everyone in my group really liked it!

This place is not the best for large groups. We had a group of 19 and they said their largest table held 15. We agreed to be split up into different tables then, but somehow, they still saw it as being fit to charge us gratuity??? I was at a table of 5, seated so far away from the rest of my group that there were several tables in between us and I could barely see them. Not sure where they got off justifying that but whatever. That's the only reason I'm docking a star, but everything else was great.

TL; DR:
- Portion sizes are huge, split with a friend. Trust me, you'll still be stuffed.
- Try what Hash House is known for: fried chicken benedict, chicken & waffles, & the watermelon kiwi lemonade.
- Not good for large groups (15+) and even if you split into different tables, they'll still tack on gratuity. 
- DELICIOUS food, and if you've never been here before, you must try it!",v6uXl0u2pGovNNJLoP67qg,6,1,4,WFxQq7I-440bQhz8nHSD9Q
4448175,2010-08-03,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"When you are in Vegas, you want to do things BIG.  Drink hard.  Play hard.  and of course, eat hard... but who really wants to eat hard 'everytime' that they need to spend $40+ on a Vegas buffet?  Fear not- the locals know the best, and thank goodness for my awesome Vegas friends for taking Jaymie Lynn S. and I out for some good eats, because Hash House A Go Go is definitely a spot to remember.

First of, this place was packed when we arrived during lunch hours on a Saturday.  Our wait was about half an hour, which is honestly not that bad if there is a delicious meal at the end of the rainbow.  So be prepared to wait a little.  In the meantime, I highly recommend looking over their menu because it is LONG and full of many options that are going to tease your every cravings.  From breakfast foods to a calamari steak, use your time wisely to choose.

Ambience?  This joint was blasting remixes of Top 40 hits- I LIKE!  It made me wish I had that iPhone application that helps identify tunes you may be unfamiliar with.  We were seated on the right side of the restaurant which made for more room, but less air conditioning because the fans weren't blowing our way.

Onto the menu!  I had a really hard time deciding what I actually wanted to eat here because there were so many.  I was looking favorably at the Chicken & Waffles options, when my friends recommended I try the ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken"" because it had my name on it.  I figured- why not, and selected that for my lunch date.  I also ordered a lemonade, and was pleased to hear that drinks were bottomless here.  However, the lemonade proved to be a bit too sour, so maybe an iced tea would have been more appropriate.

After waiting for what seemed forever (around thirty minutes... quite a bit of a wait IMO), our food came out.  Mine came out last, but what I saw on my friends' plates was shocking.

PORTIONS DO NOT LIE.  THEY ARE HUGE.

My Fried Chicken meal came with mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, medley of tomatoes and a side of fresh fruit.  It was big eats here.  The presentation of it was wonderful as well, and upon first glance, I knew I was going to have trouble finishing all of this food.  The chicken breast piece was juicy, and did not feel overwhelming being fried.  Everything on my plate was honestly very tasty... but to nobody's surprise, I could not finish this giant meal.  Check out the size of this plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?action_user_photos=1

If you are a light eater, sharing one dish can be your life saver!

Jaymie Lynn S. let me have a taste of her calamari steak, and it was hella good!  It was an interesting take on the traditional calamari style meats, but I very much enjoyed it along with the condiments that came with it.

This was such a great eating experience, and I highly recommend it for any Vegas local or traveler wanting a great meal that is guaranteed to get you full.  Parking is available in a small lot outside of the restaurant, with more on the street once it gets packed.

There's not a dietitian alive who'd condone a dinner of mounds of deep-fried chicken piled atop FOUR, count 'em four Belgian waffles, garnished with more than a few strands of fried leeks, unless you count the sprig of fresh rosemary as a green vegetable.  That's hubby's favorite dish at this spot, which bills itself as ""Twisted Farm Food.""

The best I can do in my Perpetual Diet World is the Stuffed Meatloaf, and I love it. Two slabs of meatloaf, with cheese, fresh spinach, and tomato stuffed inside, atop a mound of mashed potatoes.  The bonus is fresh green beans, which have the cooked-but-crisp quality I love at Chinese restaurants, and carrots.  I can continue to be delusional as I dig in!  I always order this dish without the marsala cream sauce, but whichever server I have always brings it on the side anyway.  The dish doesn't need it, and I sure don't need the calories.  My cousin dipped a pinkie in the sauce and pronounced it bland, so I'm sure I'm not missing anything.  And the double bonus is that I have enough of the meat loaf left over for a substantial dinner the next night!

We usually come to Hash House when we have out-of-town guests, because it something our [East Coast] visitors can't get at home.  This time was no exception, and it's a hoot to watch their reactions when the food is brought out, either to our table or surrounding ones.  Even we gaped at a foot-high dish at a nearby table, and couldn't figure out what that pile on top of a slab of watermelon was.  We found out later that it's the Fried Green Tomato appetizer, and we marveled at that couple's ability to polish that off and continue on to main courses.  It looked fabulous, but I don't think we'll ever be ordering it.

One thing I take exception to here is the wine list.  They've crossed the $7 line as their least expensive glass of wine, and at $10 and $12 a glass for my coveted Rieslings, I vote with my wallet.  As non-Strip eaters, we're not used to paying these prices, and I missed my customary wine with dinner.

We couldn't find anybody to ask if we could somehow get our meal fixed, so we ate it glumly.  It's a huge portion, two of us couldn't finish it.  And it had such potential to be good, there are good flavors and creativity, but the crappy service made it just another lukewarm meal at a crowded place.  However, the coffee is good, I asked what kind it was, and the waitress said she would find out and get back to me.  Given the service issues, is it surprising she never came back?  I may give this place another go-go, but only if I can sit where the real diners are allowed.",ybJkYYEBvFGVb-or4i9_oA,0,0,2,N235ZnDGyiKbJhp4ULlASA

4495195,2011-04-10,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I agree with the reviews that think this place is totally overrated. Having seen the San Diego version on the Food Network and hearing rave reviews from friends, I decided to finally give Hash House A-Go-Go on Sahara a try to have breakfast with my sister and her two little boys. If you are looking for a brunch place on Saturday where you can actually hear the person sitting next to you, not the place to go. 

First, being 10:30am on a Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait for first available (inside or outside). There's minimal spots to sit inside so we had to wait out in the chill. When finally seated inside, a DJ was blasting Lady Gaga so loud, I couldn't hear what my five year old nephew sitting right next to me wanted to order. This ""club-esque"" music lasted most of the breakfast and was a very irritating. Maybe I missed the ""Saturday Brunch Party"" memo.

I split a decent $8.50 Bloody Mary with my sister that came with a green bean, stuffed olive, and sweet pickle. I ordered what I thought was the ""Warsaw Hash"" which was a Brunch special they had for $10.95. After waiting 25 minutes for our food, the portion was pretty sizeable and I ended up taking half of it home. The quality, however, was a little bland. There were big chunks of ground Turkey and pieces of bacon and melted cheese on potatoes. Nothing amazing. I did try my nephew's cinnamon french toast and that was pretty yummy.

Overall I found the place a mix of hipsters, hipster wannabes, and trendy yuppies looking for a place ""cool"" to eat at. The wait was long to sit, get our food, and get boxes and have the check paid. It took us an hour and fifty minutes to eat and get out. Definitely not a place for a relaxing breakfast.",6oYSZsRlbd2Mr1Sc2UF_ew,0,0,2,G9szuoyo-x4zIhqVHrWKiw

I caught this on the TV a few days before I went to Vegas but only a few highlights - about how it's a must visit when in Vegas.

i got the fried chicken benedict since if fried chicken is on the menu, i am almost sure to get it.  it was a biscuit sitting on a mound of mash potatoes with egg, a well spiced fried chicken breast, bacon, tomato, spinach and a red pepper cream sauce.  it was a ridiculous amount of food and i'm suprised i didn't go into cardiac arrest just looking at it. 

i understand what another reviewer said about their food looking too messy because when my benedict came out, i was overwhelmed thinking about how i was going to eat it.  usually, when i get a giant plate of something, it makes me kind of sick but because it was so delicious, i got over it.  i couldn't even finish half. 

my beverage of choice was the bloody mary.  it was tangy and spicy with a lot of stuff in it, just how i like it.  i didn't think it had much alcohol but as i got progressively more giggly during the meal, i realized i was wrong.

my friends got the  blueberry pancake (it seriously is the size of a big pizza), the meatloaf hash and the veggie hash and they all really liked their food but the best thing we had may have been the strawberry jam.  none of us are into big chunks of bread and had not touched our biscuits but once we decided to try some of the jam, we basically empied the container onto them and had to have them for later.   it was not too sweet and had a really good consistency. 

now, i'm sad i didn't end up eating the leftovers because we were too busy drinking and gambling.  i would definitely recommend it if you want good, non-buffet food.",XkLK2iBsgqF6mWwDfRgqqQ,1,2,5,18UXe-5QK47Zr8r-NZapYg

These are some of the sights you will see and experience when dining at Hash House a Go Go.

Wait till you see the food when brought to other patrons... you WILL be intimidated.... I guarantee it! The farm people from Indiana must be related to Paul Bunyan in some respects.... serving sizes are double, no... triple that of other restaurants. I exaggerate NOT!

On the menu today....

Buttermilk Biscuits (*** 1/2) with a shiny Honey-Glaze on the outside are a complimentary precursor to your meal. Do not, I repeat DO NOT consume these Biscuits! The restaurant will try to tempt you with small Stainless Steel cups of Butter and Honey... but don't do it! The second problem is that you can't take 'em home... they'll be hard as a rock the next day. They're about three inches across by another three inches high. They'll just ruin your dinner. I've warned you...

Boston Hash (*** $14.95) Crispy Potatoes in two inch chunks, mixed onions, fresh tomatoes crowned with Hash House a Go Go's famous all blue Crab Cake drizzled with Horseradish Cream and served with probably a four-egg mixture of Scrambled Eggs with stalks of Asparagus and strings of Fried Pasta as Garnish. And all served on a three inch deep by eight inch square Iron Skillet. Opinion - I like the humongous serving sizes... but did anyone from the restaurant perform taste testing? The Crab would have been better served within the Egg Scramble mixture. The Country Potato concoction was barely surviving bland in flavor.... Add some Green or Red Peppers, FGS. Despite the presence of Horseradish... could not provide enough flavor contrast to save the entree.

Chicken & Waffles (****-Kathy's rating... she's pretty easy. $12.95) On Friday Nights - the Chicken and Waffles are ONLY $12.95! This is an unbelievable BARGAIN! Huge, and I mean HUGE pieces of Chicken... white Chicken pieces resting on top of four Bacon-infused Waffle Squares topped with some fancy-schmancy Onion Rings with some fried Green Onions thrown in which gave it an Oriental flavor. I'm not kidding... the Waffles are embedded with BACON! Looked like Mt Everest when brought to the table. Kathy, my daughter, let me try some of the Sage rubbed herb Chicken... super, super tender pieces of meat. My own opinion... dump the Sage herbs when frying the pieces of Chicken. Maybe I'm just used to plain ol' Fried Chicken with just Salt & Pepper when consuming with Waffles.

Lemonade (****) 
Iced Tea

Total: $35.99

Service (****) Server was on top of everything, always topped our drinks on time. Very talkative.... despite not knowing very much about the restaurant management. In fact, she admitted, before working at Hash House, she NEVER heard of or tasted Chicken & Waffles or even had Meat Loaf. Now, that's a different kind of virgin that I've heard of!

Dessert - You've got to be kidding! If you finish the Biscuits and whatever you ordered for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.... there will be NO room for Dessert!

Virtually everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, had their leftovers bagged in plain brown Grocery Bags to be taken home. Does the presence of leftovers translate into a 5-star rating? No, I don't think so.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,1,1,4,ilMqWQCNzAT7kfZfm-HqwA

I went in with high hopes as I like places with big portions and creative food. We were seated right away on a Friday night, but then sat for the next 20 minutes watching servers walk by when someone finally noticed us. I could tell the server knew we had been waiting a while when she noticed that we didn't even have water. She asked if we wanted to just order as no one had bothered to see if we wanted drinks. I ordered a coke and the chicken and waffles. After another 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. Another 5 minutes later they brought us biscuits which were big and looked good, but ended up being dry and kind of tasteless. They did bring the equivalent of about 1 pat of butter and a tiny bit of honey (imagine a McDonald's honey ""spread"" container). It just wasn't enough for four adults. Then after another pretty decent wait (our server came and reassured us twice that our food was coming up), the food came. I have to say that everyone's entree looked awesome. After we took photos, something I have never done at a restaurant, we dug in.....

My first bite made me gag a little bit. Imagine as a kid experimenting with the food in the door of the refrigerator: maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, green onion? No matter how you combine these things they are not going to mesh well on a waffle with bacon. Ok, I understand the spin on chicken and waffles, but when this is your signature dish and it tastes like shit-something is wrong. The waffles were inedible-thick and doughy. The bacon was limp. The chicken was cold and dry. I basically just picked at the deep fried green onions and spaghetti noodles and took the 1/4"" thick breading off of the chicken and had some protein. 

The other diners in our party didn't like their dish either; the pork cutlets. The bastards at HH even charged them $2.50 for splitting a meal that could have fed eight people. Needless to say, we didn't take any leftovers home.

One last warning for good measure: if you are sensitive to MSG, don't order the waffles. The soy sauce in the dish contains MSG. I get a huge headache when I have even little bit and this must have had lots. 

I was totally disappointed with the whole experience. I would like to go back and try breakfast, but it was so bad I just can't stomach it.",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,1,1,1,wh0GHgkw3SJWUfcvNCfNnw

Facility:  The Hash House restaurants have a cool, country vibe with a modern twist. That is the theme of their food too. The place is always clean and has a spacious feel. They have both tables and chairs and some booth seating. It was only about 30% full since it was a tad late. I like this location, because it's pretty much all locals and not heavy with tourists. 

Service:  Shane was our waiter.  He was super nice and very helpful, as it took is entirely too long to decide what we wanted. We probably asked him about 50% of the menu and he never once showed irritation or impatience. Then when I got a bit picky and REALLY wanted corn with my meal, he coordinated a special substitution with the cook. 

Food: They switched from Coke products to Pepsi!  Yuck!!!!  
Other than that, I really enjoyed the food. They serve hot biscuits with butter and a fantastic house made peach jam. 
CHICKEN FRIED STEAK: 4/5 This was on one of their special side flyers. The steak was big, thick, and had a delicious crispy batter. I got the gravy on the side, because I like the crispness of the batter to last. The gravy was good, but a tad bland. I prefer a heavier sausage flavor to my country gravy. 
It normally comes with green beans and mashed potatoes, but I asked the sweet corn mashed potatoes that has corn in it instead. I really love corn with my chicken fried steak...this wasn't exactly the same, but it was a nice gesture anyway. The green beans were very good too. They were fresh with a nice seasonings.

The atmosphere was very boisterous with a full bar , people gathered both inside and outside the door waiting to be seated, as waiters/waitresses zipped through serving patrons.

My wait wasn't that long considering how busy the restaurant was.  I was seated in the bar area at one of the ""high-tops"".  It was fine because I had a great view of the bar, the patio and the front door area.  There wasn't really anything special to see but I still enjoy people watching.

Ok, so I had to order the chicken and waffles everyone raves about.  Must I say, it truly did deliver.  I have to admit that I was a bit awe-struck on just how I was going to attack the towering monstrosity that lay before me.  Needless to say, I had to request a to-go after on eating about 1/3 of my breakfast.  

Specifics:  
The crunch on the chicken was to die for.  The waffles were very good and I think they would be good with or without being laced with strips of bacon.  The dish comes with a drizzle of syrup which was not enough for me so I requested a side of syrup.

Service was quick and efficient.  Like when asked for a clean fork instead of the one with left over stuck on food that was waiting at the table for me as I sat down.    My order came out way too fast which is always  an eyebrow lifter.  I mean just long was my food sitting under a warming light before it was plated?

Hash House has it's one flaw but everything else is right on.  Very HEALTHY portions, customer service is always right on.  Sometimes you gotta wait but it's never more than 5 to 10 minutes.  I always seem to pick a great time to come as I've only had to wait once and it was a 7 minute wait.

My boyfriend and I were so excited to go here because of the great reviews they had. Sorry to say that I do not feel like the reviews lived up to my expectations.

The line was extremely long and we waited a good 20 minutes for a table. Not a problem at all. We weren't in any rush. We were seated and the waiter came about 5 minutes after which was also fine. It gave us time to look over the menu which I wasn't impressed with. The menu was large, didn't offer anything to me that appealed to me. I ordered a vegetarian option since everything had with meat included pork which I do not eat. I must say, it would be nice to have turkey sausage or turkey bacon on the menu for those of us who doesn't eat pork. However, having a vegetarian breakfast wasn't a problem. 

I order an egg scrambled with veggies and cheese added. It came with fresh fruit, potatoes and a humongous biscuit. This biscuit was bigger than my palm! Sadly, that was the highlight of the meal. The potatoes had no flavor and were kinda cold. You can tell that they were cooked in large quantity earlier in the day and served out of pot. The fruit was sweet so I didn't have any issue. My eggs and veggies again lacked flavor. I had to add a nice amount of salt and pepper to give it some kinda ""umph"". The food was just OK. 

I was very disappointed with the food considering all of the hype including chefs like Rachel Ray. I have experienced MUCH better brunch/breakfast food.",dxjehLpGgh08vby2BksV6g,1,0,2,x3WBjxuVH3SXzgqin-5sjg

Once seated our waitress didn't come by for about 15 mins to take our drink order. Really during the whole meal she was super inattentive and had her runners doing most of the work. She wasn't very friendly or inviting either.

I thought maybe the food would make up for the shotty service but nope. I had the smoked salmon hash which was just alright. I felt like it needed some type of sauce or more spice to it since it seemed super bland to me. The only good thing was the pineapple mimosa which was almost more champagne then pineapple but that's always aright.

Yes, the servings are generous. Yes, there are a lot of people here. And, yes, SOME people love it here. But I don't. 

First of all, we had to wait forever for a table. I get that it's a bust Sunday morning and everyone wants a tasty breakfast, but this place was near that point where you'd rather eat anything than wait in line much longer. Then, when we finally got seated and our orders taken, we had to wait forever for the food, too. Then we finally get our food, which is all very presentable, but not at all very tasty. The quality of the food was somewhere around Denny's, but a lot more expensive. And even though it was a lot of food, it wasn't enough that I could disregard the low quality of it. Fail.

My friends and I drove over to this joint on a recent trip, excited about the prospect of a delicious breakfast. We should have saved ourselves the time and stayed at the casino buffet!

First off, the lunch items we saw being delivered did look good. And by good, I mean tall. They stack all of the food really high here, with a big sprig of rosemary inexplicably stuck in the top of everything. It's so impressive that my friend asked a neighboring table if she could photograph their burger. Anyway, we didn't order lunch, but maybe we should have. Maybe that's their specialty. Because it sure ain't breakfast!

My friend and I each got a different kind of Eggs Benedict. Hers came doused in marinara sauce for some reason. Wtf? I ordered the smoked salmon florentine and they chose to smother this one in something that looked and tasted like Thousand Island dressing. The salmon was not like any kind of ""smoked salmon"" you are imagining. It was dry and clumpy, with a texture like it had been served three days prior as an entree and then nuked and reconstituted for this dish. There were also long twigs in the potatoes - what? I am not making this up. Look at some of the photos on this page! They put twigs in it on purpose! And the whole thing was topped off with that giant rosemary sprig, sticking out of the top like a g*d*amn Christmas tree.

I love breakfast. Fancy breakfasts, greasy diner breakfasts, you name it. But this...this was disgusting. It is rare that I can't find something on my plate to eat, but this was simply inedible garbage food. I don't think I've ever given a 1 star before, not even in Edinburgh!

To cap it all off, we had to wait about a half hour to get our check, even though we were all prairie-doggin it hard.

On the plus side, they played great 80s and 90s music, and my friend liked her mocha, hence the 1 star.

It's the sort of place that I would probably try again if I lived in Vegas. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing or perhaps takeout is not as good as in-restaurant dining.  But based on our meal I don't think it's a destination place.",Wxd-EKF2Z4RHZUmwQ6Eeew,3,1,3,6a-JhUW2qfHx4SFbdehvFA

We got seated immediately since we went to this location before it was on the TV show Man vs Food and the Imperial Palace location.

Fresh juice:  lemonade, watermelon, and OJ.  All juices were freshly made, without any additives.

The portions are large, so order 1 entree of each type of food you want to try and share!  

Food:  Sage fried chicken benedict massive strips of chicken strips on top of eggs that had a chipotle cream sauce rather than the typical hollandaise sauce.  A side of yellow watermelon was served with this as well.  I guess fruit can be seasonal so who knows what you will get when.

Chicken and waffles:  3-4 pieces of waffles with additional 3-4 pieces of sage chicken strips, that is topped off with syrup, and fried scallions

Banana pancake:  the size of this pancake is as twice as big as your head.  Pretty fluffy, but nothing too different about this dish.  I would have preferred ordering something else that was more unique to the place.",4tLJgCAc4G5LU7BiJm54Hg,1,0,4,pvS1qcBshKLtuVIlZiX4hw

Were told that they only take reservations with 24 hours notice. Got there around 9:45 and was told there would be a 40 min wait. No biggie, I thought. I noticed as we were standing outside, patiently waiting our 40 minutes, there was a large, empty table that was set for 12 out on the patio. I went in and asked the hostess if we could sit at this table outside and was told that there were 2 other large groups ahead of us. Again, not a big deal. At the 30 min mark, we were surprised when we were told our table was ready!  YEA! 10 minutes early.  My excitement faded when we were lead straight to the empty table outside we had been staring at for the past 30 minutes!  ARGH!  How frustrating!!  This was our second visit this year to this place and a similar situation happened on our first visit..they had half the place empty but a long wait time?  I don't think they know how to manage their staff very well.  
We waited for about 10 min before our waiter (who turned out to be the bartender from inside) came to get out order. He said he was there to take our drink order and I told him we were all ready to order food as well.  I was told ""lets get the drinks out of the way and I will be back for the food orders after""  We all ordered our drink and I was impressed he didn't write a THING down! Needless to say, our drink order was screwed up. When he came back to take our food order, he wrote it all down this time, but was almost rude as he did so. After about 15 minutes our food arrived. One, plate,  and one person,at, a, time. First the bacon, then the eggs..etc.  it was painful to experience.  We of course waited until the last person was served to start eating and by then the first couple of people's food was cold. No one came to check on us during our breakfast and we had to hunt down our waiter to get the check which took another 10 minutes.

Not because of it's sudden celebrity status, but because of the amazing menu that serves my favorite meal of the day- breakfast all day long...more like Breakfast, Brunch, and Brinner :-) 

I know there are 2 locations in Vegas. I was told the original building is small, dark, and not so glamorous, but honestly it's all about the food with me. Since I didn't have a car, the location on the strip at Imperial Palace, that I believe opened in January, was perfect! The casino itself was not very admirable, but Hash House upstairs was bright and clean. We went on a Sunday around noon, so I was afraid that we would have to wait a while, but I don't think we waited longer than 15 minutes. 

This place is not for the faint of heart, so let me start off by first saying that we were warned about the portions. Usually, I have no problems with that, but DAMN! There were four of us- the two, more experienced Hash House a Go-Goers were smart and shared the Man vs. Food favorite: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. My friend ordered the same thing, and I, of course, known to be a whore for chicken and waffles ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles- NY Times favorite. Starting with the Benedict dish, it actually had a lot of my favorite things all thrown together on a plate, but in my opinion, it was a bit overwhelming with all the different flavors. The fried chicken was amazing, it had a nutty taste and texture that I enjoyed. My were waffles w/cooked bacon in between was a delightful surprise. My only gripe with that dish was they did not supply enough syrup! However, it was quite a sight to see a tower of waffles and chicken placed before me. Needless to say, none of us hardly finished. The couple with us nearly did and my friend and I each walked away stuffed with leftovers for the rest of the day!

Service was decent for being extremely busy. I had to ask twice for extra syrup, but I'm not really into the whole making a scene or letting some insignificant thing ruin my meal, so whatever, I'm patient and can wait. The prices are excellent for the portions you receive, both a good and a bad thing. The mimosas were so-so, I've had better. This is definitely a place I'd GO-GO to again to try other dishes, but thankfully they don't have any Hash Houses out here yet, otherwise I'd bust my belt!",CSPvBBYffjsgCxJ1cDV3xg,0,0,4,XrlFgH2i-2suQiuLp31-7g

I just can't seem to finish any of their plates here! I've come close, but with a drink and everything. It's still a goal awaiting to be accomplished.

My friend always gets the fried chicken- which I PERSONALLY think it's a little on the dry side. But then I was never really a fried chicken fan. I only like really super juicy fatty fried chicken (i.e-Church's) ; my friend loves it though- and apparently most people on yelp do, too.

I have tried their flapjacks-delicious!
Most recently tried their Corned-beef hash. Also delish. SO JUICY. Came with a biscuit, two eggs and a slice of cantaloupe and orange. Everything was cooked to perfection, and the presentation of the food itself just makes you wanna .. ah, EAT.

I also tried the banana mocha? It was okay. The top part with all the whipped cream and stuff was great. But as you proceed, the drink just starts to taste pretty much like a ""standard"" mocha.


Ok, I simple HAVE to put this here, we found a piece of plastic in our food. 
;x Which really disappointed me as I've been a big fan of this place. We told them about it and they quickly apologized. Their manager (?) also came over to say sorry. They took that off our bill, but honestly- if i owned this place and that happened to my customers, I would've waived their entire bill. I'm just sayin'.

And I gotta be honest, it kinda worries me, how the hell did that get in my food? Where was it from anyway?


Well- will probably come back but if there's a strike two, it's gonna be out forever.

Food:
I had the Chicken Sage with waffles. All style, no substance. Chicken was dry and flavorless. Waffles was mushy. I rather get the 99cents Popeyes Tuesday special and slap it on a double Waffle Cafe waffle and it would taste much better and be cheaper. Crabcake, salmon, swordfish, burger seems to be satisfactory. Both my chicken and salmon had maple syrup on it. Maple syrup has a really strong taste, so it absolutely overshadows other food. I guess its suppose to help season the chicken. But maple syrup on salmon? WTF. Maple syrup on the side next time please. Another person in our group had swordfish which was good, but it was cold. He had to mix it with the mash potatoes to warm it up. This is supposed to be twisted farm food, not twisted sushi bar. Despite all of this, 2 people in our group seem to really enjoy the meal. Looks like the dice rolled in the favor.

Service:
This is probably unnecessary ripping, but since I'm on a roll anyways, might as well. Two things the waiter said stuck to me, we make everything ""home made"" so it'll take longer and because of this everything won't come out at once. Like really? I came to a restaurant to get ""home made"" dinner and expect it to take longer, otherwise I would have just went to my local Walmart and get a frozen dinner and blast it in the microwave and enjoy my meal in about 3 minutes. Secondly, just because it takes longer to make, does not excuse not timing the kitchen to get EVERYONE'S food out at the SAME time. It sucks being the last person waiting for food, watching everyone else eat. Food did come out separately as expected, but timing wasn't too bad. Maybe 1 or 2 minutes between each person. It's amazing they filled up everyone drinks in a timely manner, but couldn't get the 2 people in our group their placemats in a timely manner. 

Price:
Food ranges around $10-$12 for your burgers, $15-$20 for their gluttony creation. $25+ for some other meats. Price seems to be about right for what you're SUPPOSE to be getting. Don't forget this place takes Restaurant.com GC for dinner, so bring a friend or two to help you, it's a lot of food after all.

yes, after watching MVF, i just had to try it, it did indeed look delicious but looks can be deceiving...just like a woman ;)

the wait wasnt super long and its pretty spacious inside, service was nice and i give them all a high five since they have to carry those heavy ass dishes everyday O_O

I ordered the meat loaf hash because i cant eat the fried chicken sage thingy...and i was disapointed with it =(.  My dish came in a skillet which was cool but my eggs looked funny and my food was actually lukewarm...my meatloaf wasnt flavorful at all and there was WAY too many veggies going on and cheese.  Even though it was healthy hearty ingredients, i couldnt enjoy the meal since it was so bland!  I didnt even bother finishing anything, and the biscuit was alright, kinda dry too.

I'm giving it three stars is because i did try the fried chicken sage and the sauce was really good, teh chiptole sauce, you can DEFINITELY taste the chipolte and it was very smooth and creamy and the chicken was juicy....but thats it!

I will not come back here...its too out of the way from teh trip.  It cost me 23ish from Palazzo to here....too far =T",CPhfMdoSeGYjwW71k3utZw,1,0,3,jmTFWVbGHuoLxErWLc_giw

The mashed potatoes were good but they made a weird combination with the quesadilla (possibly what made the plate so heavy). The garnish was weird too... they decorated my mashed potatoes with what looked like burnt raw spaghetti noodles (didn't make sense) and a stalk of rosemary stabbed into the quesadilla (??) , the dish was also garnished with a piece of watermelon and a slice of orange ... it was weird but whatever I dig in and managed to finish half the quesadilla , it was too much.

It's not that far of a drive, and probably a little less crowded and a little tastier.  We got there around 11am on a Thursday & was seated right away.  Without looking at the menu I knew that I was going to share with her the chicken & waffles.  How can you make this dish even more appealing?!  By adding bacon into the waffles, which they did!  There are full strips in and coming out of the waffles!  The chicken breasts were perfectly fried and moist.  The Belgian waffles were crisp on the edges and soft and moist in the middle.  And the crispy bacon strips were a delicious and unusual twist.   Bf got the fried chicken Benedict which was just as huge, creative and tasty as well.  I still enjoyed my dish a lot more but I like how they used a chipotle cream sauce vs. typical hollandaise sauce (this is why I usually don't care for Benedicts).

4731157,2015-02-15,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Everything about Vegas is over the top.  One of the most over the top breakfasts can be had at Hash House a Go Go.  They are known for their crazy concoctions of burgers stacked high, pancakes larger than pizzas, and breakfast plates big enough for three, four maybe. I have been to the one in San Diego, and the long wait was rewarded with plates of impossible to finish food.  Delicious at that.  Going to Vegas, knowing there was a Hash House off the strip and on the strip, my breakfast was set.

We ordered the iced pistachio mocha to start things off.  It was milky and ice cold.  The pistachio taste was subtle, but there.  It was similar to the Nutella shake at Burger Bar. The chocolate was a nice background flavor.  Imagine chocolate hazelnut (nutella) but then replace the hazelnut with pistachio. It worked!  Tasty!

The craziest dish I have ever seen was the sausage gravy pot pie.  It had scrambled egg and mashed potatoes which was normal.  This was I guess their version of sausage and biscuits, but mutated to a giant monster.  The bottom was a bowl formed by an upside down hat made of a biscuit type bread.  Inside the bowl was massive amounts of mashed potatoes which kind of sucked. There was even a bunch underneath the makeshift bowl.    I was looking for more sausage pieces, though there were some.  After a few bites of this dish, it was a bit tiring.  I don't see how anyone can finish this dish.  Carb overload is an understatement.

My chorizo hash was sensible, but still came in a skillet.  It had jalapeno, red onion, cheddar cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  The kick from the jalapeno was a wake up call, especially compared to the monotone of the pot pie.  Chorizo is spicy as well, so this dish had a lot of flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked over easy.  Though there was nothing special about this one, it at least kept me interested.

Hash House a Go Go is a place to go eat.  They make sure you are full, and you leave with a doggy bag every time. This is the opposite of tapas small plates.  You get one big plate, and a lot of it.  The food isn't boring for sure.  They try to keep it interesting with interesting combinations and portions that are too big to make sense. I guess that is the fun of it all.  Vegas is all about buffets, but with Hash House, you will get enough -- don't worry.",m33gSTi0Fyo3W2Qw6WVdtA,0,0,4,vPRqQJc0nYLzJyDPEL98Cg

Finally decided on the Chicken and Waffles, and was so glad I did! The Fried chicken was perfectly fried with a nice buttery breading, and the waffles - stack on top of them - were light and fluffy. A perfect match. They also sprinkled some toasted coconut on the top of the waffles that just tied in everything nicely.

1.) chicken salad sandwich with house salad/mango dressing.  Tasted very fresh, just the way BF likes it.
2.) corned beef sandwich with house salad/cucumber dressing. Tested great, according to friend.
3.) First I wanted to eat some blueberry pancakes, but smelling good smells from kitchen, I changed my mind. Asked for Classic Eggs Benedicts, but they were out of Hollandise sauce. Well, okay ... then I ordered Corned Beef sandwich with sweet potato fries. 
My sweet potato fries were so greasy, I couldn't touch them. Waitress offered to bring me a SURE GOOD  macaroni and cheese side dish. 
I really appreciate that she was trying to makeup for the greasy sweet potato fries. 
Honestly, I didn't like the macaroni and cheese either. It was not a usual dish. Big penne pasta with so much cheese ... And the cheese kept sticking to my teeth!

Been here a few times before and the family has always enjoyed it but this time my daughter ordered the BBBlt (I think that's how they describe it on the menu), & I couldn't have been more disappointed for her. Unlike the description, there were only 6 pieces of bacon which didn't come close to comparing to the size of the bread or the huge amounts of lettuce & tomato they used. And if you're still thinking it sounds good, the bacon was not the bacon we eat everyday. I'm not sure if it was from a different animal, that or very bad grease/gasoline flavoring, but I didn't want to eat it let alone have my 15 yr old finish the sandwich. 3 day old bacon would have been better!Anyway...

4765261,2010-05-31,9,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Rewriting this, since someone asked me why I didn't like it. We went for my friend's birthday because he claims he's enjoyed this place before.

First off, I can't understand how this place has high ratings at all. The food is shitty, and the service is horrendous. When we walked in, the first place we were seated was right near the entrance where people can walk past you on two sides. I politely told the hostess that the table was unacceptable, and that we wanted to sit in a booth. She tries moving us two tables over so that we're right next to the busing station, and all the servers would be walking past us and guests on their way to the toilet. Apparently ""please seat us in a booth, we don't want people walking behind us while we're eating"" is something that's not understandable. 

We had to then wait 10 minutes for them to clean an empty booth.

We sat down and hadn't even had a chance to look at the menus, when our obnoxious waiter came up and asked if we were ready to order. We told him we'd like some time to look at the menu, and would let him know when we were ready. Less than two minutes passed, and he returned and asked again for our order. We had to repeat this three times.

We were served cold biscuits with honey and butter. The biscuits were not light and fluffy, nor were they very tasty. We also had an ant in our bowl, which we found after we had been eating. When we told a passing server about it, she responded with ""Did you find it before or after you ate the biscuits?"" ... What? We found a LIVE INSECT IN OUR FOOD. What does it matter if it was ""before or after""? 

Everyone's plates came on obnoxiously sized serving dishes. My husband and I had ordered a kokomo sandwich, which came on dry assed texas toast, despite being called ""milk bread"". There were no sauces or anything to add flavor to it. The meatloaf, while tasty, is nothing I couldn't make better at home, and the sandwich was definitely NOT worth $13. My mashed potatoes came with, what looked like a sheet of cheese colored plastic on top of them. I couldn't even puncture it with a fork... The bacon was kinda glued to the cheese as well. My sandwich also came with a steak knife jammed into the middle of it, and a tree of rosemary. Not good presentation at all.

I ordered an arnold palmer to drink. I told a passing waitress (the ant woman) that it tasted off and was watered down. I honestly think the fresh brewed tea they had, was just a cup of water that had sat next to a teabag at some point. Very poor quality.

Our original server had gone from being hovering to neglectful. We didn't see him until after it was time to drop the check. We had told him at least four times that it was our friend's birthday, without any acknowledgment at all. Finally I said ""What kind of restaurant is this? Even fancy restaurants in vegas offer to do something for a guest's birthday."". He told me that HHAGG doesn't, and offered to ""bring us a dessert"" but assured us that it would not be complimentary. We decided to just cut our losses and leave. 

I will not ever return to this horrible restaurant. Seriously. Train your damned chefs. Teach them how to make proper food, and not just slop whatever they think is edible on a plate. Train your waitstaff and teach them to walk the fine line between being a hovering nuisance and neglectful... And do something for your damned guest's birthdays.

The Chicken & Waffles were also delicous. The waffles had bacon inside; and the fried onions were excellent! I'm an onion lover, so the onions were the most delish item for me.

I understand that there are some hotel versions of this closer to the Strip, but we trekked out to the original on Sahara Blvd. and it was well worth the drive.  We were seated within 30 mins. on a Saturday, we expected to wait longer, as this place is a magnet for locals and visitors alike - perhaps the Casino versions of the restaurant keep it down to a decent wait if you drive out to the original HHAGG.  Service - probably the only thing that wasn't stellar here.  I won't take a star off for that, but it could have just been when we were there - the servers seemed a little green and the hostess had about as much class as what you might see in a local trailer park, but I digress.  
Now, on to the reason to eat at Hash House A Go Go - the food - OMG - some of the biggest portions I've ever seen and not just big but good big food.  I had the Indiana Favorites - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit.  And I ate every single thing on that plate - come hungry.  It was magnificent!  The chicken was tender and crunchy, drizzled with just enough maple reduction (i.e. syrup) to give it such a nice sweet taste to the the coating on the chicken.  More potatoes than you probably eat for a Thanksgiving dinner including 2nds and 3rds but I kept that fork moving through everything, savoring each bite and not wanting this food to end.  The biscuit - oh man- the biscuit - you have to have a biscuit - take an order of those to go...they're that good.  And the whole thing was around $15.  This is now a must visit spot on any trip to Vegas.  We may try the Casino version to compare, but if you are in town and hungry - give the gaming tables and Cicque shows a rest and grab a fork and napkin and dig in - you will  NOT be disappointed.

Ever since introducing my friend to this spot a year ago, we've made it a mission to trek over to this side of Las Vegas, off the strip where the auto dealerships are. The service is extremely friendly and attentive each of the two times we've gone here. We even took friends (who lived in this town!) to try this place out. I'm well aware of the new location inside the Imperial Palace, but for some reason, we didn't mind driving a little while (when we had access to a vehicle that is) to the original Las Vegas location.

The food is incredible and it'll satisfy every craving you have for rich, hearty, stick to your ribs, pimped out diner fare. Great for curing hangovers, especially after partying for two days straight between Club XS and Surrender. Sure, it's easy to just cook up a bunch of food, pour gravy or top it with cheese on a gigantic plate, and pass it off as ""value"". These folks make it an effort to have neck-breaking presentation with their plating. I typically order the fried chicken eggs benedict. I don't even know why I bothered ordering my eggs as egg whites as if it'll lessen the damage from the hollandaise sauce, mutant sized piece of fried chicken breast, and griddle fried cheese on top. Needless to say, the portions here are hilariously huge. Either bring a friend or come with a monster appetite. It's not exactly a place for petite eaters.

Last time I went was back in August, so this is a long overdue review for this place. I remembered getting a free specialty beverage of the day if I gave them my Twitter account and showed them on my phone that I tweeted about this place.

YES the portions are out of control!!! We wanted a good sampling to gage wether we would be back or not... The Salad was good, not great maybe it was because we didn't have them mix the Blu cheese dressing into the salad like normal or maybe it was because they didn't really have a salad dressing we liked....Personal preference right? right!...(Thats where we lost the 5th star)...

Moving on to the Benedict...it was huge!!! it was tasty! The combination of the flavors in the guts of the meal were great!! cheese, eggs, bacon, spinach, tomatoes etc topped with a hot chipotle sauce....mildly spicy...I was all over this thing!!! Yes i was hoping that there was more of a punch in flavor, meaning the flavor of the parts were good but subtle. I was hoping the sum of the parts would be greater than the whole but that wasn't the case. The Chipotle sauce pretty much made the dish. So much so that I ordered more the smother the mountain of breakfast goodies in. the presentation was great! The food was very good.

My husband and I went here to try something different from our normal breakfast/brunch haunts like The Coffee Cup in Boulder City or one of the champagne brunches at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay. 

With that said, the place was ok. There was a bit of a wait and for some reason the chef either really likes rosemary or his supplier gave him an excess that was unreasonable that he had to get rid of it somehow. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the meatloaf hash. For drinks I had the bloody mary and he had the orange juice since he had to go into work in a few hours. You can't really complain about orange juice and the bloody mary was just ok, the whole time I was drinking it I just kept thinking about the bloody mary I had at Rosemary's, which was AWESOME!, and I guess nothing could really compare to that so I can't really complain. 

As for the food, the meatloaf hash....well I think they got the order wrong because it actually looked like it was a sausage hash or something like that. My husband gave me a bite and I just couldn't believe that that bite contained anything that would resemble meatloaf. One it was pale, and it was somewhat rounded like it was a chicken sausage. He said that it was meatloaf but honestly, unless it was a chicken or turkey meatloaf I just couldn't understand why the ""meat"" was pale like that. As for my chicken and waffles, it was ok. Maybe i'm used to Roscoe's in LA, but the chicken was dry and the waffles was just too soft for me. The only saving grace was the fried leeks. The long piece of rosemary running through it was just ridiculous! With every bite all I smelled and tasted was the rosemary, I thought it was supposed to be ""sage"" fried chicken? Why not have fresh sage on the dish? The dish was bearable after my husband took that branch of rosemary off my dish and onto his side of the table. I felt bad cause he also had a branch of rosemary on his plate however it would have been considered a ""mini"" compared to the HUGE branch I got on my plate. New York Times Favorite or whatever they claim on their menu?!?...Either I got screwed on the chicken and the extra rosemary order the day before or maybe the New York Times critic was high when he/she decided to make it a favorite. Sorry I'm just not a fan of inedible garnishes that just don't make any sense on a plate. 

The ambiance and building itself was pretty cool, the staff was dressed as greasers, you could see their ""real"" hair under thier wigs. haha. For the same price of breakfast for the both of us we could have gotten champagne brunch at either Mandalay Bay or Bellagio and that is with just one of us getting a drink, just one drink!

I had a Salmon Scramble and the girlfriend had Roast Chicken Hash. There was a lot of it, including giant sprigs of sage. Like, novelty giant sprigs of sage. I found a couple small bones in the salmon which didn't totally put me off, just a little bit. I think it was the lack of flavor that did it, really. Everything tasted bland. The GF wasn't a big fan of her hash. I've seen it mentioned on here a few times, and she agrees, the chicken was very dry. 

All in all, we're not fans and I doubt we'll be going back. I know it's supposed to be an institution of Las Vegas, but I can't see how.",LJPlDsqBS-TvR4LKnhRvLg,4,3,2,Pzp3MNsquhMetkSGAcxLVA
4812468,2015-08-13,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"We get it. It's the ""best"" place to get food in Vegas. After so many great reviews I feel as if they don't try twice as hard. 

Came on Monday for breakfast and it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated right away and gave us water within seconds. We ordered the basic, the fried chicken and waffle and I was going for the chicken pot pie dish (because I saw it on yelp) and the lady said they don't have it for breakfast.. ok fine. I scanned the menu quick and realize I can't decide quick enough and it'd be better if she came back so I told her kindly to just come back and we'll order when I make my mind and she wasn't so happy about that. 

We let her know I was ready and waited for her to come back to take our order which took about 10-15 minutes. I get it, you got tables to wait I respect that but she was not doing her job. By the time she put the order in for the chicken benedict our friend's food was out already. 

The water tasted very funky for a highly raved restaurant so we asked for lemon slices and the lemon slices they gave us had oil all over them...? (at this point I'm thinking this lady hates us)

In short:
Proportions are huge, as said in other reviews.
- I would share dishes if you really want to come here.
Food is interesting & different take on breakfast
- order the fried chicken benedict, it's a different take on a benedict with good mashed potatoes on the bottom and it has a spicy creamy chipotle sauce
- order the chicken pot pie... and let me know how it tastes! but come after 1pm",S-3VkmAgF8OnxxdWArEQjA,0,0,3,05YspKE0zfB77ryj0fkdcw

The biscuits can feed an etheopian kid for a week. Their farm food with a twist is more like farm food is twisted. Ever go to a pancake house and order a stack or even a short stack. Uncle buck would be impressed by their one pancake. Mmmm I had the Pineapple and coconut one. Yum....I've had the corned beef hash there, the chicken and waffles. Ok it's not Roscoe's, but when waffles have bacon sticking out of them....FUN.  I defnitely like the presentation. It's the size of a sushi boat.  I've also had the the Chicken pot pie. Technically I like chicken pot pie as a pie. Not as an upside down pie crust hat with ladles of chicken pot pie innards and a mound of mashed potatoes. 
I definitely liked the Flattened piece of fried pork goodness. Hmmm I wish they had rice....You can't give a filipino pork without rice....
Overall the food is good. Just insultingly large. It makes buffets look like 1 trip. 
Cocktails inventive.....Bloody Mary with pickled green beans?  NICE!
Coffee drinks....just order the coffee with the smore's goodness on there.....
Budgetwise - it's reasonable for the amount of food you get. Ok does Idaho have potato shortages from this place.

Before I went to this place I kept hearing the same thing over and over again. The portions are HUGE! Well, yes, they are. And if that is all you care about you will have a great time at the Hash House A Go Go, but if you're someone who actually likes to eat a meal that tastes good, I'd -a- GO- GO somewhere else. The place does look nice, and the staff are helpful. They made quite a bit of the fact that Man Vs. Food was there filming during their run across Vegas. They serve very unique dishes, which is something I usually respect, but I think about restaurants, and cooking in general, the way i think about comedy. Some people say they don't like comedians who curse, other say they do, I say, as long as you're funny.. it doesn't matter. Same thing with food. You can be unique with your recipes, you can be traditional... so LONG AS THE FOOD TASTES GOOD! I had the corned beef hash with eggs. The eggs were bland, under cooked, and horrible. The corned beef was shredded in long thick strips and seasoned with something that smelled like foot powder. The potatoes were the worst part of the breakfast. Hard, unseasoned, and cold. It looked, and tasted, like they boiled a potato in water, hit it with a hammer, and put it on your plate.
Not to judge harshly because of one dish, I went back a 2nd time as I always do before deciding on a place. This time I had the strawberry pancakes. Same story. They were the size of Texas, but they just weren't very good. Boiled cardboard. Sorry folks, this one is a NO GO!

We went on a Wednesday at 8:45 AM and there was no crowd, no wait. I hear it gets pretty busy though.

We had oatmeal and the chicken and waffles. The oatmeal was a huge bowl, buried in fresh, yummy fruit. I was nervous to try the chicken and waffles because, well, those aren't supposed to go together. I was further put off by the fact that they make them with sage and leeks here (like wtf? How does that go with maple?!). But it did. It was soooo did. 

Sage chicken and waffles with leeks and bacon: A+++

In sum:
1. If you're in Vegas, come here for breakfast.
2. Share. This is far too much food. Seriously.

Hands down, one of the best meals I have ever had. The goat cheese complemented the sweetness of the sun dried tomatoes perfectly in the scrambler. The biscuits were thick and doughy and extremely fresh. The waffles, probably accidental, had some bacon cooked into it and i don't care if it was a mistake or not it was bomb.com.

He's the only person I've ever seen casually finish a meal at HH. Just back from a early morning hike at Red Rocks and ready to eat a bear? Eat here.
- The food's delicious. I've had the Chicken and Waffles a few times, the Chicken Pot Pie, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. The Chicken and Waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. Yum.
- Mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. You feel welcomed. I reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour. 
- Great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway. 
- Price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. A bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at Egg Works; which means I'm not getting a fun surprise on my bill. That Chicken and Waffles is usually Lunch, Dinner, and lunch the next day for me. As long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, Hash House is a great deal. 

Cons:
- You will never leave hungry. Holy balls there's a lot of food. If your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from Europe and have never heard of the Doggy Bag this place will give you pangs. 
- You can definitely eat yourself sick. Be aware of your tummyfeelings.
- Both locations are Popular, and they can get busy. And I mean really busy. Saturday morning around brunch time? Call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. This is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. Settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. If you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake.
- I can't imagine this place would be good for very large groups. Anything more than maybe 6-8 people, and I feel like you'd be waiting a while for food to come out and be fresh and hot, but I've honestly never tried it.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,4,tJIFA7dHHNhzsp39GHpa_Q
4871498,2013-02-16,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. Their choices are so fun and flavorful. I like their chicken and waffles! The waffle they have with this meal has bacon in it. Everybody knows that waffles and bacon has got to be the most amazing combination ever haha! The waffles were fluffy and moist. Their chicken was fried but not greasy. It was tender on the inside and it goes great with the whole meal. Definitely a sweet & savory meal for sure!

They don't take reservations during the weekends so there is typically a 10-20 min wait around breakfast time which is not bad at all. It's definitely worth the short wait. The servers get pretty busy so you might not get your drink refill instantaneously. Parking is also a pain sometimes. I suggest one person to get out of the car and put your name on the list while somebody finds parking ;)

Oh their watermelon lemonade is pretty good but I don't think it's worth the $5 honestly. It's not refillable and there's more lemonade taste than watermelon so just a heads up.",QXHvKbbcgb39hx0Ur-bqGw,0,0,4,bx0ppLrLidFJtujOHIarzQ

so today was my 4th visit here and i can confidently say that the service is always slow. you may get seated right away and may have your order put it promptly.. but after that it seems like they forget about you. 

the pook and i came here for breakfast this morning. i can safely say that our food took at least 30 minutes to get to us.. and when you ask about it.. i would hope that the server would actually check the kitchen before replying that it's almost done. 

i ordered the sage fried chicken benedict and the pook had the cinnamon banana flapjack. a server came over with a plate with eggs and ham and possibly bacon and was ready to put it on our table. but neither of us had ordered that dish so i let her know that we did not order that dish. she continued to repeat the other and told us yes we did order this. another server came by and said ""no.. that's for table 12.. you need to get your table numbers in order"" and then the server with that plate rolled her eyes without even trying to hide her frustration. umm... no sorry for telling me instead of asking me what i ordered? and it wasn't even our fault? she walked by a moment later and i politely smiled and i didnt get one ounce of friendly from her.. i was so bothered... 

our food came out and it was soooo good. but i dont think this will be my first choice when im in town anymore. they were out of the watermelon kiwi lemonade and the cheesecake latte which was on the specials menu.... then i had to ask 3 different times for syrup to go. the table behind us had such horrible service they complained to the manager. it wasnt that bad in our case but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. :(",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,2,1,2,WAbkqcNC0UhNJ2FPD3jJ9w

The other chicken thing I had was tasty also..

And the monster burger we shared was cooked perfectly. I loved the texture of the meat, not ground and smashed to taste like an over processed patty, it was just right.

(1)  First tried to order their salmon dish for lunch... come to find out that they didn't have any salmon in?  Ummm.... so why's it on the menu exactly?  Dissapointment #1.
(2) Quantity here does not equal quality.  Ordered the Bacon Bacon Bacon Lettuce and Tomato.  The sandwich was definitely big, but also very dry.  No mayonnaise whatsoever and they stack so much lettuce into sandwich that it dominates the bacon.  Additionally, the toast was way to big and I felt like I was eating Toast and Lettuce.  Not good at all. and for $11.95???? Definitely not worth it.
(3) To top it all off, the wait staff took 10 minutes between giving us water and taking our order.  I saw 3 different tables get their orders in before our waitress even came back to us... that just made the wait that much longer.
(4) Manager that day had no idea what he was serving. Sure it's nice enough that you come out and deliver the food to the table.  The order didn't look right and he was absolutely unsure of what he had in his hands when we questioned what it was... yeesh, study your menu yeah?

We went around 4:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. Upon arriving we were seated promptly by the hostess. The layout of the restaurant is very open with a bar, many tables and a few booths. Looking around you can see that their theme of ""twisted farm food"" runs consistent throughout the restaurant decor & its menu items. Our server was pretty slow and forgot about several things, granted she was new though. 

We ordered a couple Bloody Marys to start out with which were deliciously refreshing. They had the perfect blend of spiciness and tanginess and were garnished with a dill pickle, jalepeño stuffed olive, lemon and a pickled green bean. If you prefer tequila over vodka opt for the Bloody Maria instead. 

As entrés we got the HashHouse Meatloaf Pasta and the HashHouse Chicken & Waffles. Which are two of their most popular dishes. Oh yea don't forget to ask for some complimentary honey drizzled buttermilk biscuits! The Meatloaf Pasta was in a light pesto sauce with one slice of meatloaf on top and garnished with some sort of cheese basket looking thing. The Chicken and Waffles come with 4 waffles with a slice of bacon cooked right into each one stacked high up with two pieces of fried chicken. It is garnished with fried onion shreds, drizzled with syrup and conveniently has a knife stuck right into the middle of all of it. The waffles were too soft for my liking yet the chicken was nicely fried. But to be honest with you there was nothing too special about both of these dishes.. Because at the end of the day, it's simply just meatloaf, waffles & fried chicken.. So easy to make & hard to mess up. 

Yes, the portions are huge but the prices aren't cheap either. So basically what you are paying for is the presentation of the dishes. I'm sure I will be back again to try some other things but not any time soon.",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,1,1,3,mUYqyrQBAn9dBY9-ZXNphQ

4938650,2011-07-28,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I have been told to go to Hash House a Go Go since I moved out to Vegas 7 years ago.  I was excited when my boyfriend finally set a date for us to go.  We went last Sunday morning, and after reading the reviews I was prepared for the wait.  If you aren't expecting to be waiting for 45 minutes, then I can understand being upset, but expecting the wait made it ok.  The place is a complete zoo!!  They honestly need to expand the restaurant or at least the waiting area.  We waited in the car because almost everywhere you stand is in somebody's way!  The restaurant is also pretty loud due to the amount of people in there.  I really like the decor as well, it's kind of country meets modern?  And the music was awesome, very original and fit the restaurant perfectly. 

There is a reason for the busyness here -- the food here is great and extremely reasonable considering the portions are HUGE!! I'm talking 2 meals... I took mine home and had it for dinner! I ordered The Tractor Driver Combo.  It was delicious!! The pancake that they delivered was insane... I would say it took as much batter as 6 regular sized pancakes to make that thing!  I was a little upset with myself for going with such a basic breakfast menu item at a restaurant like that, but I don't care... that pancake was amazing.  Plus I got to share with my boyfriend who ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I honestly don't like chicken for breakfast, I think it's odd, but it was good... There were so many different flavors in every single bite.  It's almost impossible to get them all in 1 bite because the plate is SO big! 

DRINKS  : MUST TRY THE BLOODY MARY!!! I am NOT a huge bloody mary fan, I normally have a few sips and then give it away because I don't like tomato juice... but a friend of mine told me i HAD to try it!! So I did and DID NOT regret it one bit.  I wanted 5 more when I was done for the flavor alone.  It was really spicy and the garnishes are deliciouss. I have been craving it ever since.  My boyfriend ordered the watermelon kiwi lemonade (I think that's what it was called) and WOW that thing is delicious and so pretty!!  All the drinks they were making at the bar (alcoholic and non alcoholic) looked wonderful. I am really looking forward to going back and trying different things!! I have to try the banana latte next time I'm there... It sounds unreal!

But that's all good because the food I had was delicious. The highlight was definitely the fried chicken eggs Benedict. You have to like chipotle because the entire giant plate is covered with a chipotle cream sauce, luckily I thought it was perfectly spicy and very tasty. Like some ofthe other reviewers have said, the chicken is a bit dry but my piece was not bad at all and nothing that compromised the dish. The grilled mozzarella on the chicken was a perfect addition to the chicken flavor profile. The dish is perfect to split with someone. 

The best part for our group was that they have seasonal fresh made jams for the biscuits. Peach was the flavor of the day and it was fantastic. My friend doesn't like jams or jellies but likes peaches so he wanted to give it a try. He loved it and wanted to buy a jar but they didn't sell any. Our waitor saw that my friend was bummed about not getting to bring any jam home, so when he came out with check he brought a huge container half full of the jam. He gave us as much as was on the table for use. Great service. Thank you very much sir it outlasted our trip of 3 days.",wWTvWFRW013Q7B6dNvS--A,0,0,5,a1g9onQ4foioUpIlsVY_1A

First off the waiter gave us a song and dance about the food being fresh and the wait might be longer.  I expect fresh food and don't try and give me an excuse why you are slow.  We waited 50 minutes for our food.  The waiter mixed up all our drinks giving my wife pepsi when she asked for diet three seperate times.  If I wasn't looking so forward to this meal I would have walked out.  My wife ordered the chicken and brie sandwich which was bland and had hardly any brie on it.  Don't bill your sandwich as a chicken and brie and then hold the brie.  I got a meatloaf sandwich and the meatloaf was delicious but the amount of fried cheese on it was absolutely disgusting.  The best choice was my friend who got the Sage chicken and waffles.  Obviously this place has one or two tricks up it's sleeve and it is wise to stick with them.  I should have got the chicken and waffles too.  To top it all off we used a $50 coupon from halfoff.com and it seem like they had never seen one before.

Came in with 4 people and shared the chicken and waffle, corned beef hash, and the smoked salmon Benedict. Without a doubt everything is very hearty and filling. 

The corn beef hash was very moist and flavorful. The chicken was a bit dry but still good none the less. Smoked salmon was good but I don't think I'd get it again. 

Service was horrible. We sat for 10 mins before a server came to us and asked for drink. It was a gentleman with black gauges in his ear. He repeatedly asked if we needed anything but would never bring it.  It wasn't until a very kind lady with short blonde hair took our order and actually took our order. She took our drink and food order very quickly and it came out in a timely fashion although, no one came over to us to ask how our food was.  I asked the gentleman with the gauges for an extra plate and he never brought it along with the waters we ordered through him.

The meals seem pricey but you get portions made for Amazon people, no joke! I had the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was perfect and the waffle was slightly above average and that is because it had bacon in it. Why didn't I think of that? Bacon in waffles.... genius! The sage in the chicken tasted great, some bites had more sage than others but that's how it goes. I also had a Smores mocha or latte and it was good. A little too big for one person to drink, I had to share it. So I really liked this drink because the marshmallows were toasted to perfection and the bitterness of the espresso mixed with the sweetness of the marsh mellows and chocolate syrup made my palate happy.

We decided on the Blueberry & Pecan flapjack ($7.95 for one 12"" fluffy, flapjack) and the eggs, bacon, biscuit, potatoes, & fruit combo ($8.95) to share.

The flapjack was excellent and one of the best pancakes I've ever had.  It was large, fluffy, light and tasty with all the blueberries.  The server brought me extra syrup when I requested it fairly quickly.

The plates are massive here.  But, it'd be more appropriate to serve it in troughs and have the tables raised up so you don't have to move your arms or head as much.

I had the tractor breakfast.  2 eggs?  Maybe ostrich eggs.  And ""a"" flapjack, which was the size of a pizza.  I have 2 stars simply because I was impressed that they managed to cook the whole thing, and because it did actually taste alright.

* Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato & fresh spinach Hash ($11.25) - The hashes ""are tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs, served with fresh fruit and biscuit."" Two sunny side up eggs sat in the corner of my skillet along with a large biscuit and a generous portion of potatoes and other good stuff.  I ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  And yes, I am still full from my breakfast.  It's a hearty portion alright! I even managed a couple of nibbles of the biscuit with the jam provided on the table.

* Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict ""w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream & scrambled eggs"" ($14.95) - The Husband was looking for the item that was featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, and the waitress said it was this one.  All of their benedicts are ""served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes.""  It was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  I took a bite, and in retrospect, I don't think I tasted anything beyond the fried chicken and cream sauce!  I did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  The Husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.  

* Andy's famous Bread pudding topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - The waitress said the only bread pudding they offered was the Snickers one.  I don't recall a Snickers bread pudding on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any Snickers in it.  No cup of coffee arrived with it either.  It was good though.

Service was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.  But I think that's when it was busy in the kitchen, so that could explain the lag time.  Overall, Hash House A Go Go is the place to be at for big breakfasts.

Given between hubby and I, we usually order only one dish per trip.  At the bar counter, they didn't charge a splitting fee ($2), but when we were seated there was either a fee, or it was waived if we ordered a side item (we got the $2 biscuit). The waiters were all friendly and tried to be attentive.

Sage Chicken Benedict - awesome presentation!  maybe cuz i love biscuits and gravy... it was one yummy mess.

Blueberry Pecan Pancake - huge, flavorful.  Thing is that the blueberries are only on top of the batter when they cooked it, instead of integrated throughout the pancake.  They didn't skimp on the pecans.

Chicken Pot Pie - once again amazing.  By open-faced, they creatively form this bowl from usual pie crust, and have the chicken & sauce overflowing out.  And it's huge!

One pound burger - Don't waste your $$ on this one.  They do 2 of these thin 1/2 pound patties that are dry and tasteless.  I barely touched this dish and helped eat my husband's pot pie.

Chicken & waffles - good quantity... comes with 3 waffles and huge piece of chicken.

Smores mocha - huge and really sweet.  It's creative, but share w/ one or two other ppl.

However, this is not a place I ever seem to crave. It's super busy most of the time and I hate waiting to eat at a restaurant that I'm not crazy about. Perhaps I haven't ordered the right item to make me feel this way yet, and that's why I'm not on the same page as everyone else. 

The few times I had eaten here, the food was not horrible, just nothing really memorable (other than the size of the colossal dishes) to make me crave it. If portion over taste was what I was into, this place would be top of my list. But it's not. 

The last time we ate here, I ordered the chicken and waffles which was very unimpressive. It was completely dry. I should've tried something else because I don't think anywhere in town beats DW Bistro's Jerk Chicken and Waffles, so maybe that was my mistake. The portion was of course too large, and it seemed like everything was just thrown on the plate. I didn't feel like the flavors complimented each other well at all. My Bloody Mary with the Bacon strip was ok. I don't know. This place just didn't do it for me during my last visit.

I don't know how many eggs were used but suffice to say it was a lot, the ham steak was a very thick cut and of great quality, the mashed potatoes and roasted potatoes were plentiful.  All I can say is you won't be disappointed.

I've said the mantra ""I don't mind paying for quality, just don't skimp on the food"" many times.  That said, you'll find the prices ""a bit up there""  compared to average breakfast, but Hash House is anything but average.  The quality and quantity is great.

The pork is just bursting with flavor and the creamy benedict sauce really complements it really well :)  

I requested Jam for the huge biscuits that usually come with the entrees, and although they don't have any in the evening, the server was able to find some that was saved from the morning (Thank you!!).

We arrived at 7 pm and there  was only a few people in the restaurant.  We were immediately sat down and a nice waitress came over to help.   

I ordered one of those kiwi watermelon lemonades spiked.   Very good but not enough liquor!!  

Got a chicken sandwich with the recommendation of the bacon cheese mashed potatoes by the waitress.  I asked for the mayonnaise on the side since I wasn't sure how much they would slather on.   Husband ordered the chicken pot pie which the waitress warned came with a cracker style crust.   

Food came out very quick and had a dramatic presentation.   

Thought the sage fried chicken on the sandwich was soggy and rather bland.   Also the cheese on top of the potatoes was microwaved to the point of being hard.  Peeled it off and the potatoes underneath were fine.  I ate a better part of it and the waitress said I did a great job! 

Husband thought the chicken pot pie was different but good.  

I think I will try this place for breakfast next time I go and see if the food is any better.

5054219,2015-03-05,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"AMBIANCE: 3 - The restaurant is huge with lots of seating. It is very well organized with a lot of space around every table. Also, there is usually a good amount of tourists inside. The decor is kinda hardcore-the metal and bolts on the wall make it look rock n' roll, always a nice touch.

SERVICE: 2 - Our server was funny and sweet. He was quick and attentive and got us what we wanted when we asked. There was only one problem, and it was a big pet peeve: the restaurant was not busy at all, and it really felt like he was rushing us. 

First, he came with the bill before we asked for it--which I thought was fine at first. Maybe he was being considerate. But way, way before we were even done eating, he asked us if we needed boxes, and that really irritated me. 

Look, not everyone stuffs food down their throats and licks the plates clean like savages *cough* really hungry men *cough*. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes for a huge meal that we weren't even done eating! 

FOOD: 3 - I have been here a total of 3 times in the past six years, and I can say with certainty that the drinks are definitely a lot better than the food. That being said, the food also used to be a lot better than it is now. 

Unfortunately for the food, when it WAS better, the drinks were STILL better! My favorite is the Kiwi Watermelon drink. And don't miss out on your twisted glass, it's a pretty nice glass! 

I have had both Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Both were in huge portions. I mean huge. But the taste was skating a little above average. The flavors didn't mesh as well as they used to..let's just say it's not my favorite brunch place.

Not to mention my food was like warm when it arrived at our table. My husband's pork ribs were 75% bone and fat so with a $21.99 price tag you can bet he was pretty pissed about that.

I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and it was freakin HUGE. I mean it looked big on the show, but it also looked GOOD... and it was. Definitely no disappointment, but bring your appetite. It was a little overwhelming, and maybe a tad bit too much chipotle cream sauce, 

My boyfriend got their pancake breakfast, and that was huge was well. The thing that knocked off their star was that it was raw in the middle. Don't get me wrong, there was still PLENTY to eat even after he picked around the raw part, and they were really nice about it, asking if he wanted another one (like I said, still plenty to eat), so they just took off $7 from the bill. The thing that gets me is that if your going to make gigantic pancakes, make them right, or make them smaller.

I don't think we would go back together, but I'd probably bring my family or friends here when they come into town, cause the service was great, and friendly, and it is kind of a novelty since it's been on national TV.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,1,0,3,ce7eRfJ-LynWKgZ9kMnn1Q

5061492,2011-06-23,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Had to make a stop at thee famous Hash House A Go Go, as a Man Vs. Food fanatic, I made it a MUST for this trip to Sin City. Stopped by in the late morning, early afternoon and was able to get a seat right away, definitely made me happy because I expected a long wait, and the cherry on top was the cute little hostess that took us to our table, I don't remember her name, but I was madly in love (maybe foreshadowing the love I was soon to encounter with the food? possibly).

The menu does not do the culinary artwork of their entrees any justice. When the waiter came around to deliver our food, I felt like I was in a Dr. Seuss book, or was having a ""bad acid"" trip (and by ""bad"", I mean good). The artistic expression that they display in their food is something that you don't see everyday, or at least in a meal in which the bill won't total over $300 for two people. The food here, is breakfast food, or ""twisted farm food"" as they call it, and believe me, it will live up to the name. You will find stuff on their menu that isn't available at just any breakfast joint, some of which includes snickers flapjacks/pancakes (yes, you read that right! Snickers pancakes!!!) and something called the ""O'hare of the Dog"" a 24oz. tall can of Budweiser in a brown paper bag!!!, with a side of bacon. 

I couldn't come to Hash House and not order the Man Vs. Food special, It was the fried chicken benedict. It came towered upon mashed potatoes, topped with a biscuit, fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, scrambled egg, and the chipotle sauce. And yes, it was as tasty and delicious as it sounds. One bite and the culmination of all the flavors will both blow your mind, as well as bewilder your taste buds, but in the best way possible. All the elements of the benedict are on point and good quality, the portions of their food are huge, it was ($14.95) for my benedict, and that could easily feed two people. As I watched the waiter frantically walk back and forth from table to table, I couldn't help but become hypnotized by the aroma and the visual creativity of the other dishes served here. Fried chicken and waffles looked and smelt really delicious, that will have to be for next time however. 

Needless to say, Food won this battle. Food:1, Man:0, until we meet again Hash House A Go Go, UNTIL WE MEET AGAINNNN!!!!!!! (Shakes fist)",9tcmF1c4XJuS4zlXXd1zKg,3,3,4,rs9k3m2zkWg48NgvIAmUUw

5075990,2009-12-25,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Just visited Hash House for the fourth time this past Tuesday. Has become one of my favorite restaurants to visit on a regular basis. However, this is my first review. Right away you would think, wow 4 visits must mean that I am going to give it 5 stars. Nope. Sorry to let you down there. So here it goes.

1. Food - Love, love, love the menu! They have a great selection of ""twisted"" farm foods that will have your mouth watering. The presentation of the food, although sometimes a bit over the top, is crazy and interesting and has not heard anything short of ""Wow"" from the people I have gone with. I have tried a few different items from the menu, my favorite so far being the Hash House Meatlof with Pasta. On this most recent visit I had their version of Chicken Pot Pie and it was big on the WOW factor but a bit short on the flavor and taste. The first meal from here I can honestly say I was a bit disappointed in. The veggies needed some seasoning and the weird hat pie crust thing (don't know how else to describe it) was almost a bit stale and really difficult to eat.

2. Service - have had no problems here. Nothing to rave about or complain about.

3. Atmosphere - pretty relaxed and calm nothing too exciting. I did enjoy eating outside on the patio when the weather was nice.

4. Drinks - had to use this just to mention how amazing the Strawberry Lemonade is. I haven't tried anything else because I can't stop drinking this stuff. MMMmmm... I might have to stop in and get a to-go cup now.

To be quite honest, I'm not sure why I keep going back so much. There are places cheaper with just as good quality food. But the portions are HUGE, the prices are fair for a good restaurant and I always am finding coupons to go.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,2,4,kRKVrE7bR6TlFdq21WDzNg

You can't get a breakfast experience like this in LA, period. Ginormous portions, doting service, and a price tag that doesn't leave you wondering why you didn't just make eggs for yourself. Hash House eats places like Square One Diner for snackies. 

The fried chicken dish here is BETTER than Bouchon's. There I said it! *dodges tomatoes* It has obviously been brined and dredged twice for a super crispy  crust and  moist and juicy interior. It's stacked on top of 3 waffles that are stuffed with bacon. I love that they drive a knife and stick of rosemary right through this tower of power... it says screw daintiness, I am some SERIOUS breakfast up in your grill. And the maple reduction and caramelized leeks on the side added more complexity of flavor that made this dish a journey for the taste buds. 

The single flapjack was like the size of my entire torso. Jam packed with blueberries and bits of pecan and more than enough to share for 4. Also for good measure, I ordered a classic breakfast plate - 2 eggs over easy, toast, fruit, and potatoes. Thought I was disappointed by the size of the 2 eggs, this can be overlooked by the awesome crispiness of the potatoes. We also got a scrambled egg dish (with lox, brie, and green onion) that I did not like at all... but I tend to hate everyone else's scrambled eggs besides my mumsies'.

This place fits me like a glove.
It's the only non-all-you-can-eat restaurant that satisfies my appetite.
The food is also very appealing to the eye.
I had their roast chicken, and it had these very thin, crunchy garnishes on top of it. Even after I ate them I had no idea what they were so I asked the waiter.
Turns out that they were deep-fried linguini strands. I never would have guessed that.
I smile when I picture the look on first-timers' faces when they get their meals served to them on these humongous plates. I can only assume that they are happily surprised.
I don't think I've ever seen meals that large on one plate.
No one who has joined me for breakfast, lunch or dinner, has been able to finish their meal (and once I'm done with my plate, I cannot eat the remainder of any other plate).
I've had most of their menu, but I'm most impressed with their chicken pot pie.
The pastry easily reaches 6 inches above the plate.
They're breakfast skillets are great, I've tasted their desserts and they're simply decadent. 
The service is good.
We've never had to wait to be seated, but they have a bar/waiting room which looks very bright and comfortable.
The pictures that I've seen, show the pretty plating, but you really have to go there to fully appreciate the portion size.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,1,0,5,_l1zWEBppoplnzWzehvT8g

We got there around 12pm and people were waiting everywhere (good sign!!). We waited around 20 minutes before we got called. My friend and I shared the Fried Chicken & Waffles and ordered a side of crispy potatoes. When it came out, we sat there in shock...it was HUGE! We didn't know where to start. The description said tower of bacon waffles, and sure enough, there were 4 waffles on top of one another and 2 fried chicken breasts on top of that. The fried chicken was a little dry, but nothing a little dunk in ketchup or syrup can't fix. I could see the pieces of bacon in the waffles, which was a little overwhelming. The waffles were crunchy and pretty good; the crispy potatoes were nicely seasoned too. 

One of my other friends ordered a breakfast combo and the other one ordered just the fried chicken. Both of them had mashed potatoes w/bacon, some of the heaviest mashed potatoes ever, but it was really creamy, buttery and good. The total wasn't bad either; I can't remember the exact number but I remember thinking it wasn't so bad. My friend and I who shared the chicken/waffles paid around $12 including tax and tip.

It was as the rating states, A-OK. I got the blueberry flapjack. IT. WAS. A. MONSTER. You don't get to pick a size so I assumed it would be a few pancakes covered in blueberries and gooey goodness. Nope. It was as big as a large pan pizza and the texture of the flapjack wasn't what I was accustomed to - somewhat dry and crumbled under my fork. The flapjack was so dry, no matter how much darn syrup I poured over it, it would suck it all up like the syrup behemoth it was! FYI: they don't give you enough syrup to choke it all down. I finished about 1/4 of it. Boo.
My boyfriend and his friend got the famous corned beef hash. They seemed to thoroughly enjoy it; I didn't like the sight of that hash (TMI: looked like skinned earthworms) and they did comment that the crispy potatoes that came with it weren't that tasty.

My only regret is I am not actually a cow, with the four compartment stomach and the ability to ingest 2.5% of my own body weight, which for me would be 4.2 pounds. If you do the math, you can figure out how much I weigh!

I couldn't finish my brunch here.  I was defeated by a loaf of meat and mashed potatoes.  I'm actually somewhat glad I didn't attempt the chicken and waffles, because my wife did, and she ate exactly half, so we decided the next time we come here, we would just split one, that way we can both feel accomplished in our eating endeavors.

Gargantuan proportions...Just look at those pictures!  The food doesn't come on plates; here, they come on PLATTERS.  Seriously consider whether you should donate a portion of your meal to charity.

Sage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower.  It wasn't that architecturally sound, but at least it looked and tasted great.  Bacon baked into the waffles, 2 pieces of crispy and NOT greasy chicken breasts on top of the waffles, with delicate fried leeks strewn about the plate, and a giant sprig of rosemary holding it all together.  Usually comes drizzled with syrup, but we asked for it on the side and they were happy to do that. 

HH meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Pretty much like normal meatloaf, but crispier and meatier(not meteor).  You know how meatloaf usually comes with either gravy or ketchup on top?  Hash house does it with BBQ sauce!  They are seriously changing the meatloaf game...The dish also came with the biggest biscuit I have ever seen in my life.  It was about 4 and a half fingerbreadths tall and about 7 inches around, and perfectly ""biscuit-y"".  You know what I mean?  A good balance of flakiness with fluffiness cut with a pinch of butteriness and saltiness, all in equal proportions.  I kind of love biscuits.

I had a bloody mary to accompany my mini smorgasborg of a healthy brunch.  It was well made, as far as bloody marys go, and came with a garnish of a petite dill pickle and 2 jalapeno stuffed olives.

Props - Great food, tip-top service, good bloody mary

Negative props - SERIOUS FOOD COMA.

We'd planned to partake in all manner of adventure after brunch, but Hash House decided to ruin our plans by knocking us out with the force of a cast iron pan a la Tom & Jerry for about 4 hours.

A friend told me about wanting to go to Hash House and only being here once which was in San Diego, I was not familiar with their menu. She told me about their Chicken and Waffles and suddenly a craving for it I just couldn't resist finally made me try out this place again.

I was not disappointed! Chicken was tender and the flavor was slighty better than Roscoes. The only thing better at roscoes is that they drown their waffles in butter, haha but not so better health wise. Now just thinking about it, I forgot to order mash potatoes and gravy on the side.  Roscoes is cheaper too, so even if I remembered, hash house might have charged me another $10 just for those sides.  The 4 fat waffles it comes with also has bacon it.  I was only able to finish 2 which was beyond filling.

I also tried their snickers pancake. Snickers in a pancake huh? Why didn't I think of that!? Damn that genius!  Felt so bad stacking up those calories.

First the good news...Food was excellent. Huge portions, so be prepared to doggy bag it, waste it, or share it.  Our party of 6 girls split the chicken and waffles, blackberry granola pancake, and chorizo hash.  The chicken was flavorful and crispy, and made up for the terrible fried chicken I had at the Wicked Spoon buffet the day before. The chorizo hash was cheesy, spicy, and yummy.  The granola pancakes were great as well. 

Now the bad news...it took us about an hour just to get our food, and our waiter was a little too pushy on trying to make us order more food. We were fully prepared to just split two entrees, but he claimed we really needed three. When we asked if we could put in the order for the two entrees and think about the third, he flat out refused and said he'd come back. He asserted that because of the crowded restaurant, our order would throw off the course of the meal since everything is made to order (like every other damn restaurant).  We were considering getting a salad, which I highly doubt would throw off the delicate timing of the food. At any rate we wouldn't eat for a long while anyway. We did let ourselves be guilt-tripped into buying the pancakes, as we were hungry. It also took about 10 minutes to pay the bill.

Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I ventured towards Hash House a Go Go after seeing a Man v. Food episode.  This place does not disappoint!  3 people + 2 meals = full stomachs AND leftovers!!  

We came in at 8:30 on a Friday morning .  We were promptly seated and attended to.  The menu is extensive, but we finally settled on two dishes and ordered.  We mentioned to the waitress that we had a tight schedule (a 10:00 spa appointment... I know, you're jealous...), and she noted that the service was quick!  

Food came to the table and all of our eyes went big.  Yowzah.  

Corned Beef House Hash - Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit :: The corned beef itself was just okay; I appreciated that they used strips of real corned beef, but the flavor and texture didn't really wow me.  On its own, nothing special, but combined with the other items on the dish and it was a winner.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked, and the biscuit was flaky and moist.  There was fresh jam on the table (score!); the flavor of the day was peach-mango.  Peach-mango jam on a biscuit... mmm... YUM.  

The Tractor Driver Combo -  Two Eggs w/ bacon, sausage or potatoes with griddled french toast, which is dipped in banana cinnamon cream and served w/ pecan maple syrup :: Texas-style toast, moist and packed with flavor.  The syrup just brings the whole dish over the top!  

The portions were HUGE.  We all ended up sharing our leftovers for breakfast the next morning and it was still more than enough. I'm interested in seeing the atmosphere in the evening and trying other dishes.  I already know that I want to try: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit, Flapjacks (flavors include Blueberry Pecan, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted Flake, to name a few!), and the Chicken and Waffles.

I love the giant springs of rosemary that get unceremoniously shoved into the potatoes. Do not come here if you aren't fairly hungry.

I am a fan of the corned beef hash, which wonderfully enough does not taste, nor look like dog food here. I really appreciate that attention to detail.

Thank you Hash House for coming to Las Vegas, thus saving me a 5-6hr drive to Hillcrest on Sunday for brunch.

All the rave reviews, all the media coverage, it just didn't live up to the hype for me.

The portions are HUGE, but it is also on the pricey side.  The presentation is great, but those alone didn't do it for me and actually worked against it. 

The huge portions are overwhelming and you really don't want to eat more.  I had the fried chicken benedict.  It was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The chicken was good, but the rest (aside from the bacon), really didn't work well for me.  I didn't like the chipotle cream sauce they used either, country gravy would have been awesome.

Weeknight dinners are considerably less crowded, with a short offering of their more popular breakfast items. Portions are maddeningly huge. I ordered the chicken porcini pasta, but because of the creamy richness,  I couldn't taste the signature flavor these mushrooms normally impart. 

Brunch is so popular, but worth a try if you can wait about 1 hour or so.  My blueberry pecan pancake was delicious, albeit too loaded with filling. The potatoes are yummy and crispy, eggs and bacon/sausage are standard. The waffles in the chicken and waffles dish were a little dry, bready, and soggy--I prefer waffles on the side so they stay crisp.

They also put weird garnishes (like fried dry spaghetti strands) that don't really anything to the dish.

I will probably come back at some point since there are many good looking items on the menu and the servers have great attitudes despite the chaos on busy weekends.",QAteXiFPrLbJiyxHbHgfow,0,0,3,b7coeR29d8nZp3g4c_yrmA

They have pretty stellar drinks. I got the kiwi watermelon lemonade. OMG so good. It comes out pretty at first but then you mix it and it looks like sewer water. SOOO good though...

Huckleberry Sin: not super sweet, can't taste the alcohol much but I definitely felt it!

Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles: Looks really impressive but the taste didn't live up to the hype. The chicken was alright but the skin kept falling off and wasn't very flavorful. The waffles had bacon inside and those were yummy! Shared between 2 people and still had leftovers.

Griddled Portabello Mushroom: the top bun was too hard so I ended up eating it open faced w/a fork & knife. The mushroom acted as a patty and came w/roasted red peppers, spinach, basil pesto & goat cheese. A great vegetarian option but not as satisfying as an actual burger.

For breakfast my bf and I had a local coupon that was $10 a $25 purchase for breakfast, so first off that was a really good deal. We showed up on an early Monday afternoon and there were some people but it wasn't packed (thank God). Our server was great, checking up on us often and in a friendly manner. I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Hash (again) which was wonderful (again), and my bf ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The entire time he was eating he had the greatest look of pleasure on his face, very much a foodgasm.

For dinner our group of 4 showed up on a Monday night and the place was almost empty, perfect for us. I was very excited to try dinner at Hash House and was not disappointed. My bf had the Chicken and Waffles again as well as his sister, her bf had some sort of bowtie pasta (I can't remember the name but it looked good), and I had the Farmer's Pasta. HH certainly knows how to make innovative and delicious dishes. My dish had chicken over angel hair pasta with corn on the cob, potatoes, barley, and spinach, with all of this sitting in vegetable stock, and griddled parmesan cheese on top. The stock really made everything stay moist and it was delicious. I got full and had some leftovers.

Only negative about our dinner experience is that our server was in training and it showed. I asked for a Root Beer and got Dr. Pepper instead... kind of hard to fudge something like that up, isn't it? He also poured a can of Guinness into a glass as if he were pouring water, so it was all fizz for quite a while. IMO, all food servers should be required to know how to pour beers properly. Third strike was how inattentive he was; he did not check up on us and we had to flag him down to replace the incorrect soda as well as take a simple request for some pepper. I am glad these were minor infractions and did not ruin our meal nor experience. We did leave him a tip though that implied ""you need to work on some things.""

Everyone loved their food and had leftovers to take. We also had a coupon that was $25 off a $50 dinner order.

The chicken and waffles was .... OK. I liked that the waffles were stuffed with bacon (husband didn't), but the fried chicken part was... just OK. They use chicken breast (versus thigh) and the breading didn't have much flavor. 

I don't know about the chicken fried steak, because my husband loved it and ate it all (in 2 sittings, as we brought it back home). I tried the biscuit and gravy it came with and it was very very good.  Bacon-y gravy, by the way. Not that anything is wrong with that.

The chicken pot pie, in my view, was a fail. It has.. broccoli and spinach. And the sauce was just downright runny and weird. Nothing about it tasted like chicken pot pie. Cute ""presentation"" but that was the best part. 

We'll give it another chance and some other stuff, hoping our first visit was an off day.",FLZVbNL6gLji3ghze303Fg,0,0,3,XVeIuseNeWlxz9hJyTfnQg

We walked in and were seated right away (we went at about 5PM so it wasn't crowded). The waitress was very nice took the order for our drinks. Mark and I have a fun thing we do..we each pick a drink for the other, not telling each other what the other will be drinking (generally an alcoholic beverage).  It just makes it fun!  Anyway, we also each had a biscuit with a honey butter glaze on it w/ sides of home made butter and strawberry jam. Very good.  

We then ordered our dinner.  Mark ordered the Blackened Chicken and I had the Chicken Pot Pie.  When the food came...OMG!! talk about a BIG portion!! My Chicken Pot Pie...it was enough to where it could feed me for 3-4 days...lol.  Marks dinner came and it was a good portion as well.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the crust was bland, had no real taste (otherwise it was great!!).  I tasted Mark's food and it was very good.  I ended up having the waitress box my left overs up (it took 2 box's)and Marks as well. 

The check was about $63.00..(Oh and we also bought the glass's we drank out of that have the logo on them) not bad for the portions as I rather leave full and with doggy bags then still be hungry. All in all Id give it 4 stars. The service was great, the place was clean and everyone was nice and courteous which is always a plus!!

It confirms that my experience was probably on the whole similar to everyone else's, and shows that despite how much I am constantly given anecdotal evidence to the contrary the world has people who are not morons devoid of sophistication and good taste.

I have been to HH for breakfast and dinner, and let me just say save your time and money and only come here for breakfast. Dinner is the exact same things with none of the breakfast meals and an extra two buck minimum sell-up on your items.

Aside from that I must say HH is great. It's not super amazing food. But for how much of it you get and how much you pay for how much you get it's a great value. The best values by far are the hamburgers which are huge and only $8!

But the big thing to get is the Chicken and Waffles. EXCELLENT! Also they make their own jam fresh! But ask if they have the strawberry it's delicious!

So here we are with 4 stars. I'll come here over and over, and yes the food is ok, but not great, but the service is good, and the prices are right, and it's a fun and trendy place. So do your best to avoid weekends it's a night-mare!",gESYd9f7ZqERmL1rFxYFsQ,0,0,4,a3gqphTWXLCAGNYTHU8g0w

It doesn't live up the hype (ok portion sizes do!). Service blows, but overall the food is decent and if you're a quantity over quality type person this should be right up your alley (sadly I'm not!)

Let's start with what they do right - the DRINKS! The coffee drinks. The mimosas, the bloody mary's, OMG. Divine. We had a sickenly sweet smores coffee drink with flipping marshmallows melted on the cup.. bonus points for creativity. I have yet to try a drink here that isn't scrumptious!!

We ordered one of the egg platters. It was decent. Nothing memorable, but nothing wrong with it. 

The chicken and waffles is where this place goes incredibly downhill. For those that say the chicken is flavorful, I think you don't have tastebuds. The chicken is so bland, dry, and awful. The waffle was somehow also bad. I love bacon waffles, it's not like this place is the first place to have them (get them all the time at Original Pancake House), but the execution here was WAY off. The bacon wasn't small enough so you have major texture issues giong on. The waffle overall lacked that yummy sweetness you get from most waffles. It wasn't soft, it wasn't sweet, it basically tasted like dry white bread with huge pieces of extremely thick flavorless bacon in it. HUGE disappointment. We kept covering the plate with more and more syrup but there was no rescuing this pitiful excuse for chicken and waffles. 

My hubbie is from Georgia, I'm from TX. We eat chicken and waffles in the south all the time. We're familiar with how they should taste. Roscoe's in LA does an excellent freaking job. This my friends was the worst chicken and waffle execution I've ever encountered.. Crappy chicken and a crappy waffle?? WTF Hash House.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,2,1,3,5hNVgv8zptyU9ezebNYp0Q

What I've had:
Andy's sage fried chicken benedict-I've had it several times and I could only eat 1/4 of the dish. It was certainly delicious. The chipotle cream made the dish even more special. 
Fried chicken and waffles-it's a tower of chicken on top of a bed of waffles. 
chicken pot pie-ginormous like all the other plates. It's a deconstructed pot pie. 
corned beef hash (my bf's favorite!!) 
caramelized banana pancakes-this is heaven!!! It's the size of a large pizza so be prepare to share with 3 other ppl.

Also, will you people stop this bullsh*t of putting bacon into everything?! Bacon mixed into the waffle. Bacon in the mashed potatoes. I don't eat the stuff, but even if I did, bacon is not a cheap substitute for knowing how to season your food. 

On the positive side, service was really nice and attentive, and we didn't have to wait too long before being seated.

5277426,2011-09-12,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I must say, with all the hype about this place, I was really expecting more, to say the least!

We came here on a Wednesday morning around 11:30, and growing up in the center of PA around farms, I was looking for a good old fashion, mans breakfast. What I found was over sized, over priced and overly hyped food that cost a lot more than it was worth (unless you can eat a pancake the size of a basketball in one sitting).

I had The Tractor Driver Combo with sausage and a water and my lovely girlfriend had the Red Leaf Salad with a water. When our waters came out, her's tasted like the last occupations of the glass was milk and it had no been properly washed, but mine was OK. The food came relatively quick, but the portion sizes were just ridiculous! 

Now, I know this is america and we have to super size everything just to stuff our faces with it, but I mean come on, who REALLY needs a pancake that size, with a side of eggs the size of small fist and two little sausage links? The eggs and sausage were VERY good, I would have easily sacrificed my flying saucer sized pancake for more of the other 2! Plus, the pancake itself was kind of stiff... Almost like it had been pre-made and sat under a heating lamp.

On the bright side, my girlfriend said her salad was delicious, but again, she could only eat about half of it because, well, she is 5'4 - 100 lbs... Not a 300 lb. grazing cow in the middle of a pasture!

For these two meals, waters, with tip, the total was29$, which isn't really a BAD price per say, but 1/2 of all our food was throw out because of the size portions. Why don't we cut the sizes in half, and charge me, lets say 20$ total with tip... Makes sense to me!!

All-in-all, A Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast which has 2 regular sized pancakes, double the meat and more eggs for about 8$ is MUCH better than this meal for $14...

Having visited the Linq location during its Imperial Palace days and also partaking in early morning breakfast at The Rio during last year's Winter Olympics a visit to West Sahara's Hash House A Go-Go was mostly for the amusement of a well traveled guest from out of town, and with absurd portions the rule and smiling service entirely amused by my old friend's antics one would be hard pressed to name a more appropriate experience to show what the San Diego import is all about.

Undoubtedly more ""Vegasy"" than its Midwestern roots or So. Cal. origins would suggest, it was just after 8:15 that we entered the sizable spot and opting to switch to a four-top after originally being seated at a two-seater it would not be long before coffee was filled for the first of several times, an enormous menu next navigated with the resultant order entailing four items - one a daily special, and the rest restaurant signatures all arriving at once to quickly flood the table.

Ever bubbly in service, with subtle pop tunes and country floating overhead, it was with great amusement that my pal bantered the server about her Energizer Bunny personality as I began to tuck in and although the oatmeal was nothing particularly special the fresh fruit and berry-streaked plate details did not go unnoticed, a little extra effort elevating an old standard while the buttermilk biscuit with housemade peach preserves remains one of the best in the city - a soft and savory center beneath a top baked golden brown.

Moving on to things more interesting, it was next in the Man vs. Food favorite of Sage Fried Chicken beneath smoky pepper cream that the meal progressed and although the heap of griddled mashed potatoes was far too much to be enjoyed in its entirety every bit of the juicy chicken, fluffy scrambled eggs, and crisp bacon was devoured by the time the meal came to an end.

Finishing the morning with a hubcap-sized pancake, equally soaked in buttermilk as the biscuit but receiving a substantial upgrade from toasted pecans and butterscotch chips, it was beneath a lacquer of butter, light whip, and brought-from-home maple syrup that a first bite was taken, and although the edges proved a bit dull when lacking all the accoutrements, the center of the flapjack was as good as any griddled novelty in Sin City, particularly at a mere $10.

Chastised by some for portions felt to be irresponsible, and reportedly varying in quality depending on kitchen staff and time of day, all three of my visits to HHaGG as well as San Diego's Tractor Room spin-off have been memorable for not only the food but the service - a Midwestern vibe for a Midwesterner at heart, no matter what state the drivers license says.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,6,4,_K-tdPYzEjga07vGwAnHYA

5290026,2007-01-25,1,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This is my first 3 star review.  I feel all dirty inside.  So, let  me toss the pro and cons right at ya!!!

I've dined at Hash House many time's.  Mostly because I have lot's of friends who come to town for short visits and don't wanna go to a casino. It does have a nice atmosphere. ( for being a converted Chevy's....yes, it's a converted Chevy's)  One of the most consistent things is the cocktail's. I love me the gin and tonic!!! WHOOO!!!  Especially Bombay Sapphire and Tonic.  Every time I order one at the Hash House, it's perfect. So, Pro 1 is that they have a great bartender.
Pro 2 it's got ATMOS.

Now for the crap fest.....at first appearance their giant plate with a branch of Rosemary ( I'm pretty sure it's Rosemary ) sticking right out of the top is AWESOME, however, for the most part a plate of bland potatoes.  Any restaurant that has a beautiful steak on the menu, then covers it in tasteless gravy and buries it in mushed potatoes....needs to go back to the drawing board.   I'm not sure where i read it, but a true test of an great restaurant is how they serve a steak.  Sad part is the beef was fantastic, cooked just the way i wanted it....but, covered in crap and under seasoned.  Booo!

In closing....they got personality.  And most people say a great breakfast menu too.  (GIANT PANCAKES, cute)  I've had breakfast there.....packed with people, had a salmon scramble....dry and way fishy, ick!  It was accompanied by a swell mimosa.....so they got the liquor part in spades.  Take a chance and feel their vibe, but when you choose what to eat, be really friggin picky!!!!",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,1,0,3,nHwlie2eWjnTB79UuJgsMg

Chicken Benedict

Bloody Mary was ok 3/5. Chicken Benedict was ok as well--chicken was dry as all hell, mashed potatoes were really good, but overall the plate was just decent.
My wife had the same issue with her chicken being dry. 

The worst part of this experience was getting the bill--WAY OVERPRICED!  Save a ton of money and just go to an Egg Works. Way better food and you'll save money. 

2/5 because the food and service were just ok. However, the price was insane for what you get (Hyperbole intended). 

Bali Hai Golf Course bar has the earths best Bloody Mary--FYI.

Hash Hash has since responded to my original post--very classy. Because this joint give's a sh*% about their client experience, I added a star.

Since I consider myself more of a connoisseur of ""weird"" foods as well as ethnic cuisines, I am not often excited by American concept foods. I do like uniqueness and thus upon buying a gift certificate to this place wanted to give ""Twisted Farm Food"" a try....and I'm VERY glad I did!!!

First, I am a big atmosphere junkie and Hash House Delivered 5 stars in this category. I liked the contemporary, slightly country decor. I dined here around holiday time, so there was Xmas tree decorated and placed smack in the middle--which added more to the whimsical atmosphere and the modern touches to the place. I liked the huge, modern and slightly utility-like looking tables/chairs and silver metal touches. A++ for decor!

Our appetizers were also rather delicious. Polenta and sirloin dish was extremely appetizing and flavorful! I'm craving it right now! Salad, however, was a bit overpriced and was the only item that was not large in size. I felt that lettuce was a bit wilted and flavors were not as full as they should have been. Very average at best for the salad.

Of course we tried waffles and chicken for dinner!!! This dish was more fun then super delicious, however with the humongous portion sizes and many stalks of sage, I got to love this dish' homey flavors and how can you not like the ""baked in bacon"" in the huge waffle? 

Aroma around the place was delicious! Think bacon mixed with sage. Yum. (I liked how all dishes had a similar sage decoration, it was very weird, but in a good, unique way).

Service was superb! Probably the best I've ever had. Not hovering over the table and interrupting, but being sweet and always quick with refills, recommendations and plate service.

I'm not sure what her prejudice was, maybe because we're from Hawaii or maybe because we're lesbians, but there was a straight Caucasian couple next to us that the server talked up a storm to.  We couldn't even get her attention to order another round of drinks.

Got seated in about 20 minutes, which was pretty good considering how crowded they were and the fact that it was Black Friday. Our food came out pretty quickly and everything was good, though I will say that the location in San Diego was better. While the portions were really large for most places, they were much smaller than the SD location, though that's not a bad thing since there was no place to take leftovers for us and it feels a bit weird to eat a burger with a knife and fork because it's literally impossible to pick it up.

We have been to hash house a dozen times at least over the last 6 or so years. It never disappoints. That isn't to say everything is perfect. Some menu items are definitely better than others. 
On our most recent trip out. We noticed the new menus. Most of the same stuff but there were some new additions. One of which was the crab cake Benedict which my wife got. We have always loved the tried and true fried chicken benedict, but I must say this one may be better. I love them both. But if you like crabcakes, give it a try. Very good.
I also got the French toast. See? We can't share one thing. While it was very good. It didn't have enough syrup. Not even close to enough. All they gave was what was already poured on the plate. I had to ask for more after half a piece. Also, I gotta say this is a perfect example of better things to get. The French Toast is good. But that's it, just good. If I had a sweet tooth that day I would recommend the brown sugar banana pancake over this. My sister in law got the pumpkin pancake, big disappointment. Could barely tell it was pumpkin. Mainly by the color, not the flavor.

Like a lot of folks, i saw Hash House on Man V Food. I had the place logged in the back of my head so when i was at a conference in Vegas for a week and the boss says ""where we eatin'?"" i was ready with a home run.

Ive eaten once at the original off strip location and once at the new location inside the IP. For the original, we were seated quickly on a weeknight and service was prompt, but that's not wat you want to hear about, is it?

The food is fucking MASSIVE. That night we had 2 appetizers, the fried green tomatoes and something else that escapes me. Both were good but i was focused on getting what i had been waiting weeks to try; the sage fried chicken and waffles.

Alright, so, 2 MASSIVE fried chicken breasts stacked on top of 4 bacon waffles roughly the dimensions of 2 hotel room Gidions bibles cut in half and stacked, all held in place with a huge steak knife. The chicken was crisp and delicious with sage running throughout. The bacon in the waffles was amazing and was topped off with a maple reduction. By the time i was done forcing as much into my body as humanly possible, i still had a meal left over for the next day.

Thank you Vegas foodies for rating this spot so high and posting so many foodgasm shots of their popular Fried Chicken & Waffles plate. You guys led us here. And surprisingly, this place was packed on a random weekday during the daytime. We sat at the bar since there was no wait for the seating there. 

I ordered myself a monstrous hot chocolate to start. I seriously probably took about 3 sips of that thing. I felt so bad wasting all that warm, chocolatey goodness in that huge mug.

For grub I ordered one of their farm benedicts, hoping it wouldn't come out as huge as the the fried chicken and waffles plate. Boy was I wrong! My benedict came with smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, this roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. What makes these benedicts so special is that they serve it on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. Talk about CARB overload! Since I don't have a binge-eating disorder anymore, I barely made a dent even into this plate. Boo!

The bf ordered an actual plate that didn't come out monstrous. I believe it was just a simple breakfast plate with eggs, meat and some potatoes. If he ordered a flapjack (which are the size of a Thanksgiving turkey serving tray) he would have been screwed for sure.

It took 10 minutes for a server to stop by the table.  When he finally showed up, I showed him the restaurants.com certificate I had and he took the orders. I don't know if the certificate had anything to do with it, but we didn't see him again until the food arrived 25 minutes later.  This was slightly alarming since I realized in the interim he never asked me how I wanted the meat in my entree done.  

Disinterested service aside, when the food arrived, it looked and smelled delicious.  I had the special, which was a mixed grill with duck breast, lamb chops and a boneless ribeye.  I soon realized however, why he didnt ask how I wanted it done.  The lamb chops were just medium, well prepared and tasted good.  However, the ribeye was only about a centimeter thick, and I'm thinking they could have cooked it for a minute on each side and it still would have turned out how I got it, which was well done, dry and flavorless.  Very disappointing for a cut of meat that is pretty easy to get right in my own experience.  

The duck had the skin left on which I was excited to see at first, until I realized they made no effort to crisp it at all.  It was so chewy I had to peel it off just to be able to eat the meat, which was now devoid of seasoning. 

The best thing about the entree was the mashed potatoes.

Before we ordered our waitress had warned us that the portions are HUGE and she was not exaggerating. Everything that came to our table was beyond gigantic. 

I split my order with my coworker and we ordered the Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict. I have never really had Eggs Benedict so I don't have much to compare it to. It came out on the most giant plate and even splitting it, we could not finish the whole thing. The bottom was their famous mashed potatoes which were to die for, layered on top was a row of biscuits, on top of that was a mix of fried chicken, bacon, tomatoes, and some greens, all ok top of that was scrambled eggs and their amazingly delicious holindase sauce. The sauce had a spicy kick to it making it the best sauce on a breakfast concoction I have ever had. The rest of the menu didn't seem too adventurous for me, but I am in no way a breakfast person, so I might not be the one to trust on this one.

This dish is massive and it looks like everything but the kitchen sink was thrown into this dish, but for all the ingredients that are combine here, it works. The flavors compliment each other very well. It was recommended by Adam Richman, who host Man vs Food on the Travel Channel. A very good recommendation.

After we got seated we waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over. She seemed bothered by simple menu questions we had about the special items. Then wanted to rush us into ordering and we had yet to be asked what we would like to drink. We then asked for a Diet Pepsi and a Mountain Dew. Well she retuned with 2 Pepsis and we kindly asked for what we ordered and she seem disturbed by this. She brings us the drinks and then vanishes to other tables and stops servicing our table. We sit with empty glasses and no service. After a few minutes a different server tops off our drinks and then my food comes out 10 minutes before my wife's. So my food is getting cold.

The banana pancakes were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The edges were kind of crispy (probably because it had been soaked and fried in butter... mmm).

If you are visiting Vegas, I would recommend sharing a dish since you WILL have plenty of leftovers... and as much as I try to avoid wasting food, it's hard to eat leftovers when traveling (no fridge, no microwave, etc.).

I can see why the servings are big because when you work on the farm, you're gonna need a lot of energy to burn. However, when in Vegas, you'll need the food to feed that hangover! 

Came here on our last day in Vegas (and no, we were not hung over) to experience all the buzz everyone is talking about. Ladies and gentlemen, you were all right! We got here a few minutes right when it opened so we didn't wait long and were seated immediately. They don't take reservations, but it seems that on Sundays at 8am, there is no line! Anyway, the hostess was friendly and the place looked clean. Our server was friendly and gave great recommendations. She was honest about how much food there was and she also informed us about plate serving and local faves. Great customer service!

I got the HH Original Benedict and loved it! It's Eggs Benedict on top of mashed potatoes filled with bacon! It's a dream come true (fluffy potatoes with bacon)!

We came here on a Wednesday morning for breakfast. The wait wasn't too bad. It took about ten minutes for them to give us a table for two. 

We enter the restaurant. Hrm, it was a bit loud. My girlfriend and I could not take our eyes off the plates being served as we walked in. Patrons around us were gorging on gargantuan plates, while a few packed lots of leftovers into to-go boxes. We decided to share a plate.

We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. We got the option with a biscuit, two pieces of chicken, two eggs, two slices of bacon, and mashed potatoes. The food didn't take too long to come out. But it would have been worth the wait. The dish looked divine!

There was a huge rosemary stem sticking out of the mashed potatoes. The scent was deliciously fragrant. The chicken was seasoned very well. It was a bit sweet! My stomach is craving for more as I write this :[ ahh. The biscuit was good, and the mashed potatoes.. oh myy, there was just so much. Even though we shared the dish, we could not finish it. We were too full. Oi.

Be warned that it's no joke when people say that the plates are huge. Be mindful of your order and don't let your eyes deceive you. Your stomach will hate you for it when you're wolfing down the rest of your meal.

If this would've been taken care of in a decent time frame I wouldn't be giving them 2 stars but our waiter didn't check on us until the time for the frickin' check!

All right, enough of that. I thought this place was supposed to be good. The building, chairs, and staff seemed a little run down. It was sad.
The dinner menu is limited and doesn't have scrambles or omelets. I ordered the Meatloaf Pasta because it sounded interesting but I ended up getting the spaghetti and meatballs.

I don't know what my wife bought but it looked like a pile of random crap in a skillet.  
 My waitress put in less than the bare minimum effort. She seemed to be hiding the whole time and had some kinda hearing problem.

Our wait was about 35 minutes but totally worth it.  Food portions are GIGANTIC! In order to really enjoy your food, you need a appetite.  The slogan does not lie in terms of a twist on farm food. The inside as well is very well set up in terms of feeling like you are in a upscale diner with farm twist to it.  This may have been the best breakfast experiance I have ever had, especially for the right price.

My girlfriend for starters got a S'Mores mocha that looked like a Frankenstein creation of a drink. Marshmallow was melted on top with chocolate and graham cracker mixed in it. The drink was huge and we did not want to touch it since it looked too good to drink. We started to actually sip it with a spoon like soup because of the sheer size and an inch deep layer of marshmallow on top. I highly, highly recommend the drink.

In terms of what I ate, I got the french toast which came with 3 giant slices of french toast, scrambled eggs, half a fried banana and two big strawberries. I could not finish my meal because I was so full.  No exaggerations here on size of food. 

Whenever a server walked by with someones food, people at other tables would be staring at the mere size and display of the food.

While waiting patiently I started to wonder if we would get service... When server approach he asked for the Drink order. I ordered a Miller lite and after ordering drinks I went to restroom and came back to table and started a timer... having sensed that this could be a lengthy visit...not intentional but good grief here we go!!! Our server - he may have had tooooo many tables to serve. In my opinion/perspective some people can handle 4-5 table sections....others can't. Maybe it was scheduling or something...but I tooknote of at least 5 tables he was trying to service and 3 of the 5 had 5 or more at the tables. So I now know THAT my table is on the back burner... It took 12 minutes from time of order to inquire about the Miller Lite. He said it would be dropped off by bar staff. I said just cancel it. I was now dissatisfied... After finally getting the server to stop by again the order was placed. Everything was delivered by some person not our server...after food arrived our server waited until we were done to check on us and bring ticket. I guess that's how it goes. Potatoes on the plate were cold but by this time I was over the visit and didn't let the server know as I could only imagine how long a fresh order would have taken. The price was higher than most brunch places and I guess I just expected better than that.

I ate as much as I could and took about half of it home. The way they plate and decorate their food is unique, the knife stabbed into it is a real eye catcher. 

This isn't a place I would go back to too often because of how heavy the food can be, but I would definitely recommend it if you haven't been here before!",IPGCGImT5tsLWWpLbvmLZQ,1,1,5,1IBWXVS3QdIAlh-JPF96Jg

That's the best way to describe the amount of food that you get at Hash House.  A comparable visual would be that scene in the ""Flintstones"" intro where Fred orders the bronto ribs, gets said food, and the car tips over.  That's the experience here.  For that reason, I'm convinced they have steel reinforced tables.

Yesterday was the five year anniversary of this branch.  5 cent beers and free appetizers for their happy hour.  Not thinking, I failed to carry cash with me, and upon realizing this, there was no way I could have purchased a dollar's worth of beer via credit card.  My liver would have exploded.

So in going back to my car, I managed to scrounge about 30 cents out, which either makes me resourceful or a desperate drinker.  Between the five cent beers and tasty appetizers (their fried green tomatoes are wonderful), I was ""good"" for the my visit.

Normal, non-anniversary dining has always been excellent.  The food is good, the portions are stupidly huge, and the atmosphere is fun.  This is more than a ""you get what you pay for"" sort of place.  Their burgers are the size of small throw pillows, and their breakfast fare is tasty (and again, stupidly huge).

Get here early, as the place fills up fast, and they're only open for a few hours at a pop.  Who knows what will happen in ""Year 10"", but I imaging I'll have five years of various dining experiences throughout to figure out what they'll do by then.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,1,1,5,EcQOZBcrPESCOqfaqJcE1g
5467901,2011-06-22,4,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I made the mistake of ordering my food without looking at other peoples' plates. I didn't notice the cyclopean heaps of steaming food on every table - I guess I was too wrapped up in conversation or something. But I doubt that as I rarely have much to say.

I decided on the mashed potato and bacon stuffed hamburger while my girlfriend went with the salmon and a large glass of tangerine juice - a particular favorite of hers and hard to find on many menus. Then a neighboring table received their order - pork chops. Looking past the gargantuan pile featured on the plate I saw that one side dish was an entire ear of corn. I began to panic.

Considering the amount of food served up, our orders came quickly and cheerfully from our server. Regret over my choice immediately consumed me and yet, I was excited by the prospect of attempting to consume approximately fourteen pounds of food in one sitting. The stack of my hamburger stood seven inches off the table's surface. I concluded right away that the fluffy bun on top could not be more than decoration, not intended to be consumed, like a garnish, and so it was discarded.

The menu stated crispy fries came with the burger. I was expecting thin, hard sticks of fried potato, but these fries were among the best I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside, perfectly chewy on the inside with just enough grease to qualify as a french fry. It's too bad I couldn't finish them since the rest of the meal consisted of a two quarter-acre hamburger patties sandwiching a full liter of mashed potatoes.

It was easily the biggest hamburger I've ever seen that wasn't on TV trying to break a record. Knowing all too well that no human any smaller than Andre the Giant could pick this monstrosity up and take a bite out of it with their mere mortal mouth, Hash House supplied a huge steak knife stuck through the top of the so-called ""sandwich."" I am more likely to call it what it is - a gastrointestinal assassin, a destroyer of mens' spirits. The taste of the thing should not be in question. I will leave flowery descriptions of its taste and color and texture and the subtle hints of.... whatever to the real foodie types of Yelp. I am here to relate the experience, that is all.

About 1/3 of the way into my behemoth of beef and bacon and mashed potatoes, the waitress asked how we were doing. Words escaped me at first, so I nodded too enthusiastically, trusting her not to think I was choking. Perhaps I was chewing. Maybe I was catching my breath mid-forkful. But then I had to ask, ""Are these supposed to be shared between two people? Have I misunderstood the whole CONCEPT of the restaurant?"" She assured me no, these are meant for individual consumption. It's sort of like Man vs. Food with every item on the menu. I threw my napkin down in defeat. My white flag draped across the seat.

Somehow I kept eating for a long time, as did my date. We both managed to finish about 2/3 of our plates. I'm no competitive eater, but I feel that I can put food away. More than one person has told me I eat like I'm in the Army. Don't think, just keep shoveling it in. But the food won. During my stay at the Hash House, I didn't see anyone clean their plate. The pork chop lady needed more than one box to bring her leftovers home. I would have taken mine back if only my hotel room included a microwave oven in the same drawer as the Gideon Bible.

I left the restaurant broken and slightly limping, but happy, sated. I didn't need breakfast the next day. Though I would have liked to see what kind of flapjacks this joint would turn out.",MgNh2vnO9Ien6sKEaTCCzg,0,0,5,cUSTpS_djuZqfAfzFx4_6g

Got the Hash House Quesadilla stuffed w/potatoes, jalapenos, eggs & tomato w/chili cream with a side of mashed potatoes.  Service was efficient, friendly, warm and simply amazing.

When the food arrived at the table, wow!  Really big portions, got a sprig of rosemary.  Just a wonderful presentation.  The aroma was awesome!  I've been overwhelmed before with presentation (oh, it looks too wonderful to eat!) but never the presentation and the aroma!  I mean, it was so fresh, so vivid, the jalapeños were bright green, the potatoes so wonderfully mixed, the egg just done to perfection, the chili cream just right....mmmmmm....gotta tell ya I had my first foodgasm ever eating this very breakfast brunch at this very Hash House A Go Go.

My wife, who hates melon and citrus, couldn't believe how wonderful the melon slice was that came with our breakfasts.  Ate the whole thing.  The orange slice too!

Got so addicted we went back every other day while on vacation, trying other places then going back to Hash House A Go Go for some real food.

The freshness, the variety, the aroma, the taste, it was fantastic.

Gotta warn you, though, after coming back from vacation we've been dining out from time to time here, and it's just awful.  Even places we liked back home don't compare.  Too salty, no flavor, no aroma, not fresh enough, etc. etc.  We keep yearning for Hash House, I guess our next vacation will be planned near one of their restaurants.

i don't care how many good reviews this place got on yelp, after trying this place for myself, i can't help but give this place low ratings

we came here relatively early on a saturday, and there was no wait time, so my experience here was off to a good start

it seemed like the item to order on the menu was the chicken and waffles, so that was what i ordered

sure, the plate looked big, and the portions looked big, but when you really think about it, the food here is NOT worth the price

$16 for two pieces of fried chicken, and three bacon-stuffed waffles, REALLY?!?!?!  for a restaurant like hash-house, they have absolutely no reason to be charging such an exorbitant amount for such pedestrian food, i'm not paying for ambiance, there is none, i'm not paying for service, service was mediocre, i'm just paying for food

now, onto the food itself... yes, the fried chicken was good, the meat was juicy, the breading wasn't too greasy, and maple was a nice touch... the waffles on the other hand, was a completely different story, it's an interesting concept to cook the waffles with bacon inside, but the waffles were bland, and the bacon was nothing to rave about

i finished the chicken, but i couldn't get myself to finish the waffles, it just wasn't good, instead i just tore the waffles apart so i could get to the bacon, bacon is bacon after all, hehe

the best part of my meal was the apple juice, unlike most places, hash house actually has freshly squeezed apple juice, it's the apple juice you make at home, not the concentrated cr*p, so kudos to hash house for their apple juice

The main problem is that Man vs. Food hyped the place as being excellent with humongous portions. We wanted to experience it just for the novelty.  Amongst the three of us we had the pancakes with hash browns, eggs over easy and chicken sausage; the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, and the Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger with the same fries. We also tried the barbecued ribs appetizer.

First, the lemonade, which was tasty, was $5.00, no refills. That's way overpriced for lemonade that isn't spectacular, but it was attractive looking. Next, we specifically asked for the appetizer to be brought out before the meal (sort of the definition of the term ""appetizer,"" right? We shouldn't have had to say anything) but it came AFTER the meal was brought out. How ridiculous is that? So two disappointments.

When the pancake came out it was large, but it was underwhelming compared to the hype it got on TV.  Yes it was really big- bigger than one outstretched medium sized female hand. It filled up maybe 2/3 of the oval plate it was served on, leaving room for maybe one cup of cubed potatoes (hashbrowns) and 2 eggs over easy. But check out this photo from Man vs. Food: http://yhoo.it/18O6aVt - this was CLEARLY nothing close to what we got, hence the disappointment.   The seasoned potatoes had no flavor, and the pancake tasted like flour.  No flavor at all.  We asked for chicken sausage and one link arrived, splayed open on a small dish. It was basically a hot dog, not sausage.

On to the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger. The teenager enjoyed it greatly, however, the teenager likes just about anything. The burger has one pound of meat divided into two pre-made, pre-seasoned patties that are cooked in a press of some kind so that both sides are cooked simultaneously. This means no way to request medium rare.  Sigh...

The Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger was tasty, although the meat flavor seemed to come from the grill without additional seasoning. Well, let's just say the seasoning was mild. I won't complain too much about the burger- it was satisfying.  The fries serving size was average. I think they were seasoned, and had a nice crunch. 

The ribs came in what appeared to be an Asian-inspired sauce, which I liked. One of the  four ribs was perfect, with tender meat falling off the bone. The others were chewy and tough. Hate to speculate on the disparity- I'll leave that to you. They were artfully leaned against a pile of cold, nasty-tasting potatoes.  What a waste of potato. We got the impression that much of the food is pre-packaged, pre-seasoned, so not much creativity happens in the preparation.

The atmosphere was different from what I expected- the dark lighting made a nice ambience even though the food is Denny's quality.  I liked the distressed wood everywhere and the (very) heavy metal chairs.

So, we will chalk this up to experience and probably not come back as a family, although I'd bring the teen here if he wanted the burger again. for $13 it wasn't so awful in my opinion.

Bacon IN the waffles AND fried chicken ON TOP of the waffles.

It's like heaven. But more like heaven wrapped in bacon, and everything is better when wrapped in bacon.

The yummy Bloody Mary's really made my mid-morning! And I can genuinely say that the Bloody Mary's were quality, since I tried like 3 or 4 of them out.

I hate to do it, but I have to ding this place one star, bacon chicken waffles or not, for the horribly lazy table service. Boo bad service. Everybody else had to help us since we saw our waitress exactly twice: she took our order and dropped off our food.

But, damn...those chicken and waffles were fantastic!",0jQDOstEQECkL9ylX4bwDA,3,4,4,4rFb8G7NcOmRNa6l39WWxQ

For all the criticisms, some deserved, others, well I guess we all have our bad days that we take out on undeserving others:  The corned beef hash doesn't come from a dog food can.  It's real corned beef shredded with potatoes.  My one complaint is they could dice up everything a little finer, it's hardly bite size like hash should be.  I mean with the portions and plate size you get a real Land of the Giants feel.

The food was okay (even though they didn't get our order right), and the service was okay too. I just can't get over the portion sizes, it is such a waste! I didn't see a single person around me finishing their plate. And what are we teaching our children? What message are we sending to adults? I would much rather pay 1/2 the price and receive half the food. Heck, I'd pay the same price for half the food if it were really tasty!

We went on a Saturday morning and early enough to beat the huge rush (we got there about 9:30 or 10am). Our wait was about 20 minutes, while the wait was an hr. plus when we left. We sat inside and while we waited we watched huge platters of food being brought out of the kitchen and instantly determined we'd be sharing a meal.

We ordered the Tractor Driver Combo: 2 eggs over medium, bacon and a blueberry pecan pancake ($13.95). We added a side of Biscuits and Gravy. The meal came out and they'd given us potatoes instead of bacon, but brought us bacon when we complained - so hey free potatoes (although I didn't care for the rosemary seasoning, I didn't think it went with the sweetness of the pancake). Also as we cut into our eggs it was obvious that they were not cooked to medium, even the egg whites were runny.. the eggs ran into the pancake which is a big pet peeve of mine. The pancake was HUGE! Together we didn't even eat 1/3 of it! It was good but came with a very small side of syrup, I imagine people are constantly asking for more syrup. I would have if I'd eaten more of my gigantic pancake.

The food didn't wow us. I didn't try the biscuits and gravy, but the bf didn't finish them so that says a lot, generally he would. Our conversation the entire meal was about how unhealthy the portion sizes were, how it was almost to the point of making us lose our appetites, and how we watched person after person send away their plates with tons of food still on them *thankfully*. It's unfortunate that other countries are starving and we rave about places with portion sizes that should feed multiple people.

I almost want to say that even if you don't have a car in Vegas, it's worth getting a taxi out here even though it might be like $30 to get here. Since I had a car on my last trip, I dropped by here. I'm pretty sure this place gets a lot more attention and fame since Man Vs. Food came here.

I ordered the ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit"" and the ""Kiwi Watermelon drink.""

5545956,2010-12-29,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Came here as the last great meal to be had in Vegas. Also because my sister saw it on Man Vs. Food.

Came around 1PM, had to wait for 20-30 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, took about thirty to forty minutes to order our food and have it served; needless to say I was starving by the time the food actually arrived at our table. Shared the HH Meatloaf Hash with my sister while our friend got the famous Chicken & Waffles. They make every single dish completely aesthetically pleasing, but as for the taste, it was lacking.

The meatloaf chunks were a tad spongey, I was disappointed that it didn't have a thicker, tastier gravy. The potatoes were a bit dry but the cheese & spinach they used was really tasty. I only tried a bit of the chicken & waffles. The chicken was good, but again, a bit dry. Same sad story with the waffles. Also found it odd that you had to ask for butter and syrup for the waffles.

I want to try this place again because I believe it could be/is amazing, maybe I just need to order something different. I definitely wanna try their pancakes next time.

Overall, this place is a bit on the expensive side (our friend ordered a large OJ & it was $6) but it's good for splitting something with a friend. Your best bet would probably be to go for a sweeter dish rather than a savory one.

Tips:
- If you're splitting a dish with someone, order a side & they won't charge you the extra $2.50 split fee.
- They give you a free daily house drink if you tweet ""I'm eating breakfast/lunch/dinner at Hash House""",Eep2NNQ9ULNX9J_SaxfIxw,2,0,3,aUGYlLUdWYhp9obcTb6oiA
5550601,2011-07-06,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"The food itself is very good if you enjoy the all american southern type of food. I cannot complain about the food because it was large portions, well made, and very unique in itself. I got the corn beef hash and was barely able to finish it. It gives the complete satisfaction of being full. 
The service however was absolutely awful. My friends and I came into Las Vegas hoping to visit this place for their breakfast. When we arrived we were seated and ordered from the menu. Right after our food was brought out the checks were brought with them. This is always troubling because when the checks are brought out right away then everyone is concerned about the cost of the meal and not enjoying themselves. It also means we can't order anything else if we want to since it's already been printed. 
The next problem was how difficult it is to get water there. I'm not sure if it's a delicacy in the Hash House A Go Go, but the first time we asked the waiter was like ""I'll get that right away."" He then comes out and starts taking orders from other tables. We then give him a second chance and ask again and he replies ""sorry, ill get that in a second."" He comes out again without any water and is ready to collect the bill. We then beg him to please get water after all our meals are finished and he finally decides to to come out with the response ""the long awaited water."" When I go to a restaurant I base my tip solely on how quick they are at refilling my water, how pleasant they are, and if they are checking on our table or not. If these are done I'll give 20-25% tip. It was hard to give a tip at this place because of how poor the service was.",FOmszbX7Io3fFQfDPDz8lg,0,0,2,IreGMI_DBdO2-ZxNIAcRgg

I also couldn't decide how to tackle it. It was a really tall stack of waffles and chicken. I ordered a child sized pancake for my toddler, and it was the size of a small table. The portions are huge and I feel like its a waste of food. Also, I hated the atmosphere. The music was so loud that I couldn't talk to my family members that I had gone out to breakfast with unless I was yelling, and then they had to yell back.

5560467,2016-08-16,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Bookmarked the Strip location for ages, but every time we attempted at it it was always crowded as shit when we found out they had other locations outside the Strip. AWESOME. LEGGO. It was our final day at Vegas and we wanted to hit up one more joint that's not accessible back home. We decided on this place to end our trip.

We got here and it wasn't too crowded yet, empty tables here and there so I thought the wait time wouldn't be too bad. They offer indoor and outdoor seating and inquired whether I had a preference. Told them whatever was free first (assumed inside since it was open) and jotted my name down and told me 30 minutes, W H A T. Your patio is clearly empty and so is the back of the restaurant. After waiting 30-40 minutes, the hostess and another wait staff placed together two tables in the patio (took you guys 40 minutes to place two tables together outside?) which was confusing seeing as there were tables inside. Mind you, it's 110+ degrees outside.

We walked out and assumed they were going to turn on the misters at least, NOPE. With no misters, the heat got pretty unbearable HELLA fast. We ended up asking if we can sit inside, was told by the hostess it'll be a longer wait (we didn't mind), but deeeng, no need for that exasperated sigh, attitude and look of irritation on your face. We get it, it's THAT MUCH of a hassle to add our name back to the wait list.

Thankfully, we were seated 10 minutes later and got our order taken down. Our waiter was really friendly and VERY efficient. Took our large order like a champ very methodically so that we were served in the fastest way they could. I ordered their ""Healthy Selection"" which was a egg white scramble with choice of two toppings (additional add-ons $1.95) with a side of ""A TON OF"" fruits as advertised on their menu. I got tomatoes, mushrooms and added spinach. The scramble was bland and watery, no flavor whatsoever- It was like eating water. The ""TON OF"" fruits they so wholeheartedly described was just a few thin slices of oranges and 3 pieces of thin apples. The boyfriend got their famous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and will admit their chicken meat was very delicious, juicy and tender to the taste. Their fresh made red skin mashed potato was a huge hit. Not to mention the portion was INSANEEE. One dish could easily feed 2-3 people.

That being said, 8-10 minutes after we were served, for some godforsaken reason our check was served to us. Our waiter was asking how we would like to pay, we just all stared. Um, W H A T. We barely started eating and you're already rushing us out? We had to double check the front door to see if there was some kind of huge wait, nope. No one at the front. What's with the rush, yo?

I don't know, we wanted to love this place, but taking so long to seat us when there were clearly tables open inside (then placing us outside in the 100+ degree weather), the attitude of the hostess, and the sudden need to rush us out just left a bad taste in our mouth.",6nvUppVogRTTwZCgaYCPjw,4,3,2,EEM6sLup-OV6KLUrwxMjuw

When we come to Vegas, we usually just taxi it everywhere, but since we were staying almost a week in Vegas, I decided to rent a car so we can get around without paying those ridiculous taxi fares that will probably amount to more anyway. We came around lunch time, and since we were waiting on my other friends, me and Jennifer went to the bar to order a bloody mary. The bloody mary is delicious and was just perfect! Loved the green bean that was in it, and the olives were also yummy as well! It all blended well into THE perfect bloody mary, EVER!

The food portions here are ginormous! My friend's daughter ordered a kid's size chocolate chip pancake, and it was definitely not a kid's portion. That pancake is the business! I'm still thinking about it today! And yes, I ate off the kid's plate, only b/c her cute self was sharing it! I ordered the chicken and waffles, and man, the waffles had bacon in it, so I was already super happy! The chicken was also really flavorful. Of course I didn't even finish the plate, and we even shared it! My Vegas friend had to take it home to eat as leftovers since I didn't want to bring it back to the hotel room! There's also a queso dip there that is spicy and off the chain! We tried my guy friend's omelet or whatever and dipped it in there. Whoa, I was blown away by how tasty it was!

our main waitress was very nice, answered or questions, suggested what to get, checked in on us, etc.

We oredered the Sage's Fried Chicken Benedict, as seen on Man vs. Food, and one order of flapjakcs to split between three people.
the flapjack was warm, fluffy, moist, soft, and absolutely delicious, it was made how a pancake should be made. 
the benedict was also absolutely dilcious, and HUGE!!
theres bacon  mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, spinach, scrambled eggs, fried chicken, cheese literally grilled on the flat top, and all stacked and topped with Chipotle Cream sauce.
it is warm, juicy, tender, spicy(not too spicy has a kick kinda spice) ooey gooey positively delicious!

the one bad thing we did not appreciate was some punk kid who brought us extra plates, and when we asked for bigger plates (he had brought us small bread plate things) he came back with bowls....which did not resolve the situation and he jsut dropped them on the table and said ""here"" and walked away.

Hash House A-Go-Go is a ways away from the strip so I recommend taking a car there. The wait time was considerably long. Two hours to get an inside table, or we had the option to gamble for a table outside or at the bar for less wait time. We ended up getting seated after a 45 minute wait outside in the sweltering heat, though it was manageable under a partial umbrella. 
I ordered Andy's sage-fried chicken benedict which was the dish featured on MVF. After a bit the waitress finally brought out two flying saucers on a plate with a massive heap of lava flowing over it and a sage pine tree sticking out of the top with a sword (reminiscent of the Sword and the Stone). 
There were two huge succulent pieces of spiced fried chicken atop a mountain of scrambled egg, potatoes, Smokey bacon, fresh spinach, mozzarella, on a split biscuit all swimming in a pool of chipotle cream.  This is a meal for 4. It was soooooooooo delicious. I will have to come back and try some more of Andy's food, because that was one of the tastiest breakfasts I've ever had.",-VtIPsp0TgYyO4bg9vyG9A,1,1,5,gIBagz_9ENomWo5ZedfmcA

Unfortunately my recent experience did not live up to the hype.  The meatloaf was very dry and difficult to eat. The fried chicken salad was very good but again, the chicken was dry.  Service was not great and I had to send the waiter back 3 times just to get small bills for the tip.  The waiters seemed overwhelmed even though the place was only 1/2 full (ever the optimist).

We ordered:

1) Fried Chicken Benedict: Imagine a yummy biscuit drizzled with chipotle cream, eggs, mashed potatoes, smoked bacon, tomatoes and that yummy fried chicken! It's literally a savory mountain that you and your stomach need to climb over to reach that euphoria (aka food coma). I highly recommend this one. It's definitely fit for 2-3 people (5/5)

2) Smoked Salmon Scramble: If you're looking for a slightly healthier option, the smoked salmon is delicious with the basil pesto, tomato, and melted brie cheese that is served with crispy potatoes. But honestly, I preferred the Fried Chicken Benedict (4/5)

3) Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: Definitely get this drink! It's not only perfect for Instagram but the drink is really yummy! If you don't finish it, you can ask for a plastic cup to go and take it on the ride home! (5/5)

Being buffeted out, we wanted to grab breakfast somewhere different, the mister and I decided to try Hash House A Go Go.  They have several locations in Vegas, but we decided on the one on Sahara since it got the better reviews.  

This location is a few miles away from the strip, but the place was packed on Sunday at 9:30A with both locals and Californians.  Must be a good sign.  

Our party was 4 + a baby, so 5 in total.  They said that it would take about 20-25 minutes and I was prepared to wait, but the mister was antsy and wasn't really feeling the wait.  He was set to leave, when low and behold, they called our name.  That was only about 10 minutes.  It was our lucky day!  The food gods wanted us to try the joint.  

We were seated at the booth, which fit the carseat w/ my baby, me, and the mister on one side and the in-laws on the other side.  

Looking over the menu, there were some very interesting selections.  Although I knew I should try the hash since it is part of their name, I went with the Snickers Flapjacks...I've never seen that as a pancake choice before.  The mister ended up getting the chicken hash w/ asparagus and the in-laws shared the salmon hash.  I order my mister the watermelon kiwi lemonade.  According to the waitress, it was the most popular non-alcoholic drink.  

Our food arrived pretty quickly and our waitress was friendly and checked on us frequently.  My flapjack was HUGE!  It was very yummy.  The Snickers were melted throughout the pancake, it was better than a chocolate chip pancake and it wasn't too sweet either.  My mister's chicken hash tasted very fresh....much better tasting than the hash at Hash at the Hotel Erwin in Venice.  The salmon hash was pretty good too.  Even the watermelon kiwi lemonade was awesome.  The drink is in three layers...top layer is the kiwi, middle is the lemonade, and the bottom is the watermelon.  Very creative and so refreshing!

I had the fried chicken and waffles.  For some reason the food was to greasy.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  I wonder if the chicken is fried beforehand and then re-fried at order.  I like my waffles crunchy on the outside and tender moist in the middle.  The waffles were soggy and pliable.  My buddy tried the waffle and agreed.  I didn't even finish the dinner, which shocked my friends.    It was not the amount of food that stopped me.  It was the grease.  I have been known to power down 2 entrees at restaurants, including soup/salad.

My buddies had chicken pot pie and the meat loaf pasta.  I got to try both of them which were very good.  I would order either of those next time.  The biscuits are very good

I really liked it then so for Mother's Day we decided to give it another try now that we live in Las Vegas. I was not impressed in the slightest. Neither the hostess nor the server seem very interested in doing their jobs and no one was smiling. The server even decided to stop listening to me and would walk away while I was talking like mid-sentence. I ordered the Boston Hash, which is a dry over-salted crab mush atop a bed of burned potatoes. I had ordered it for the fruit side so that I could feed that to my son, but ended up with soggy carrots and green beans. Toddlers don't enjoy that as much. I'm cool if you run out of something and let me know but the server, in her continuing vow of silence, didn't say anything. 

The general look of the place was run down. They seated us in the middle of the room on very wobbly chairs. For a place with fat people portions, they sure don't have fat people furniture. I was certain that I was going to break that chair like in the movie Shallow Hal. It would be fitting because that character's name is Rosemary and this restaurant likes to garnish everything a giant branch of rosemary.

This is a favorite of our out of town relatives and I love taking people there. It's always busy, so don't go when you are at the point of hunger. The service is always good. The servers all seem to work together as a team and they seem to have a really well organized system. The food comes out fairly quickly once you order and people are always checking up on your drinks or whether or not you need something. I have been here more than a handful of times and even though it's not my thing to try different menu items at places I go to, I almost always do here because you almost can't go wrong. 
Our favorites are
Sage chicken and waffles
Bacon waffle-personal favorite
Skillets and scrambles-you can't go wrong!
And don't forget to get a bite of someone's biscuit and fresh jam if yours doesn't come with one! 
One thing to be said, while I see their pancakes are popular, I personally do not care for the very thick style pancakes. These pancakes are almost 3 times as thick as a regular pancake and about 4 times as large area wise.

5650980,2010-08-11,2,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Hash House A GoGo is a must go to when coming to Vegas for food.  It is a refreshing alternative to the glut of cheap buffets and overly priced epicurean restaurants.  The portion sizes are humongous as well as having a different twist on homestyle foods.  

The sage fried chicken with waffles is always a sure winner.  Fried chkn is always fresh and crisp and the waffles have bacon right int them.  Pour syrup over the whole thing and you come out a winner, unlike the casinos.

Their meatloaf is your standard classic meatloaf, but without any of the cheap meat taste.  The only thing that I didn't care for much in their meatloaf sandwich was the use of canned tomatoes on top.  It gave a very unrefined feel to the whole thing and clashed with the butter toasted milk bread and smoky cheese.

The banana brown sugar pancakes are worth waking up for even if it means you are still hung over.  The pancakes have nice amount of banana in it and are cooked with brown sugar so you get the marvelous crunchy texture with the well-rounded sweetness.  

The eggs benedict dishes and hash dishes are piled on high and probably enough for two to share or have another meal out of later.  The kiwi-watermelon lemonade is also a feast for the eyes as it layers into 3 different colors and was the star attraction of our table.  

Of course, no one is perfect and we had experienced what many of the other Yelpers had brought up.  Service was really mediocre, and they really did not seem to care.  Our food took over 45 min from the time we ordered and our server said she would get us refills, but would charge us for them.  Great way to comp your customers!  When the food did finally come out, it was one dish at a time at 5 min intervals.  They also messed up our orders.

I think that if you anticipate mediocre service, you should be ok.  Go for the food!",4q1GOTm23q-qG3o5Kpz81Q,2,3,4,gcoTWl-OaEzANqolNUnAQg

By the time we were seated we were ravenous. Everything on the menu looked good. 

When we walked in we eyed the other patron's dishes, unless you're competing in Man vs. Food, those portions are not for regular human consumption. We opted to order 3 dishes to share. Instead of paying the $2 per plate surcharge you're allowed to add on a side to waive the fee - might as well get something if you have to pay anyway! We opted for sides of fruit, scrambled eggs, and bacon. 

We wanted to diversify our selections so we ordered: the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese Farm Scramble which is served with potatoes and a biscuit (this was the vegetarian selection for me which included all of my favorite ingredients!), some bacon stuffed waffle thing topped with sage fried chicken, and finally, a farmed benedict.

I can only speak to the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese farm scramble since the others had meat in them - the scramble was delicious!!  The portion size was smaller than the other dishes we ordered but still plenty to share. The service here was good, we were inhaling the food just 15 minutes after we ordered it and had our waters refilled frequently. 

Bottom line, Hash House A Go Go is definitely worth the trip from the strip, just be sure to bring a big appetite along with you and be prepared for at least a 30 minute wait at all times of the day!",VdUjcjZeSF7sH8Z-OZfIag,6,2,5,cj6104XO92n9pt5Nv_FtDQ

A friend took me to the Hash House a Go Go in Vegas on a trip a couple years ago and I have been adicted ever since. The portions are huge and are served on plates so large the waiters and waitresses can only carry one at a time. The cooks actually put a lot of effort in the presentation as well and when you get this huge plate of food sat in front or you it actually looks like the food you would get in a gourmet restaurant, only bigger, MUCH BIGGER.

Then you taste the food and it is just as good as it looks! I have recommended HHAGG to 3 different friends when they were visiting Vegas, and all of them came back full and raving about how much they loved it.

The only negative to this place is everytime I have gone we have had to wait a long time for a table. That one inconvenience aside, this is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. It's is pretty far off the strip, so if you are visiting Vegas and don't have a car, just know that a cab ride will cost you a quite a bit. I can't say how much cause I always have a car in Vegas, but considering the distance, it will be a lot.

5658848,2010-03-13,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"This was absolutely the worst meal I've had since I can remember.  What an ill-conceived and poorly executed restaurant.

We were seated pretty quickly.  It was busy.  I looked around at the plates on the tables that people had in front of them and I couldn't believe it.  Big mountains of food all of them, crowned with foot long branches of rosemary and handfuls of dried pasta.  Blechhhhhh!

So we sat down and the server was very nice.  It took almost an hour for us to get our food, however.  ""We don't use heat lamps or microwaves!"" was her explanation for the wait.  What does that mean?    You don't cook your pancakes and eggs in the microwave?  I should hope not.  Judging by the wait, they were cooking with a magnifying glass and a sunbeam.

Anyways, I ordered a ""Benedict"".  What came out was cold and awful and not anything close to a benedict.  A pound of gluey, cold mashed potatoes (why?), 2 cold and unappetizing bricks of biscuits topped with cold, unseasoned scrambled eggs!  I thought I got the wrong dish.  Nope, said young waitron.  That's our benedict!  I don't care what you call it, if it's supposed to be eggs benedict it's got to at least have poached eggs or even fried, not scrambled.

The worst part of it (besides the prices) was the mashed potato monstrosity!  Literally 2 pounds of cold, congealed potatoes that had already set up like a concrete foundation underneath all of the awful food.

I was angry leaving this restaurant I was so upset.  Waited an hour for a $15 plate of something I didn't order.  It tasted awful and made me sick to look at it it was so gross.  The pancake was just as bad, like 2 feet wide on top of a huge plate.  Disgusting.  And almost 50 bucks for breakfast? 

Wow the portions are huge!  But the food sucks and it's super expensive.  You're really paying for two meals and who wants to bring eggs and pancake leftovers home?

We barely touched the food once it finally arrived and were obviously perturbed, but the waitress didn't notice or was used to it.  I couldn't wait to purge on yelp when I got home still starving in spite of the mound of mash.  I'm surprised this place gets such good yelps.  I really hated every inch of this strange place.",xymN6nkSGPL4A2D3C2DuaQ,3,3,1,DdK-RmxTyXAayY9f8z53DA
5659627,2012-11-27,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"A friend and I decided to try out Hash House A Go Go for the first time because of rave reviews others have given. Upon receiving the food, I noticed that the presentation was aesthetically pleasing and the portions were (far too) generous. I'm the type of person who would opt out from paying a little more money for a lot more food I don't want to finish.

I had the Big 'Ol Chicken Pot Pie solely because I was craving chicken pot pie while my friend had...the pork tenderloin? I'm not quite sure and never got to try it so I'll skip that in the review. All I remember was that the blue cheese mash it came with was delish.

The pot pie wasn't in the traditional form of a pie but came in a giant hat-shaped bread-crust with chicken pot pie filling piled into a plate. I appreciate the fried garnishes on top and the noticeable amount of rosemary in the crust as well. The filling was hot and soft and well-rounded. 

However, the crust was just okay to me and half the reason I get any kind of pie is for a good flaky crust. The crust in this pie was a bit too hard and cold. Maybe I missed some kind of memo that warned customers of the deviation from the norm.

If I were to judge this place on just their Big 'Ol Chicken Pot Pie, I would have rated it a 4/5 but I also had the opportunity to taste their (nonalcoholic) Kiwi-Watermelon Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade. And for the price, I was definitely unimpressed. They just tasted so ordinary when people had hyped me up beforehand into thinking they would be amazing.

The eggs were cooked as I ordered, the potatoes were over cooked and tasteless. The pancake was huge and cooked well, but average in taste.  All in all my meal was average.  Hubby got chicken and waffles.  The onions and sage and thyme all combines with the waffles and syrup and it was interesting and good.  The fried chicken was good too.  Although he enjoyed his meal, at the end his option was still ""meh"".  Izzy at the car helped us and she was nice and fun and gave good service.  There was a male manager (I forgot his name) he was really nice too.  Other employees- not so impressive, like the young complaining about Melissa or Marisa who no longer worked there.

Each entree is easily enough for two or maybe three hungry people. The food is not only abundant but really very tasty. This is the epitome of good old American comfort food. Anything on the menu could be the Wikipedia picture for comfort food.  In fact, if you have a moment can you please update the Wiki, the pictures there are boring and this menu is truly exciting and imaginative. 

The biscuits and gravy are a must. Wow I loved these. I'd come back just for this plate alone but if I'm going why not get more than just a side.

We had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and the Biscuits and Gravy. This was our breakfast and lunch.

Amazing food, great prices and a very nice restaurant. Just short of five stars but a must try. They will never get a Michelin Star and that's good. This isn't pertinacious French food, this is American!  

I love this place. I truly hope the owners have seriously considered opening a second location in San Francisco, we really need it. There is a huge niche that needs to be filled in the foggy city. I know what your thinking, ""You've already got 4,000+ restaurants and don't need another."" We have nothing like this. Please come.

Im not one for straying off the strip, but honestly this place was amazing. Less than 5 minutes off the strip, I found Hash House A Go Go. Dipped in for lunch with a restaurant.com gift certificate and the food was AMAZING.

I have been dreaming of their biscuits since I had them. Fresh made with a from scratch strawberry jam that is to die for!

The portions are ridiculously huge for such a small price, you really cant beat it. You get Farm Fresh Organic Food and don't have to blow a budget like most vegas eateries.

I got the chorizzo scramble and the jalapenos and tomato in it were so fresh. Eggs were cooked perfectly and it was served in a big black skillet with a biscuit and two pieces of very fresh fruit including a juicy slice of watermelon. My boyfriend ordered the basic, and although he would have liked a little more bacon he was very happy with his meal.

We ordered the blueberry pecan pancake to share and it was HUGE and sooooo good that I didn't want to stop eating it. The pancake was super large but not heavy...still light and fluffy.

I could go on for days about this place, but all you have to know is that its not that far off the strip, with a restaurant.com gift certificate you will pay so little for the amount of food you get and the quality of food.

Sounds fun and tasty, but this isn't some regular breakfast type diner. It's a full scale restaurant with clean decor and a wonderful vibe inside. However, be careful what you order because the servings are HUGE!

Then you will start to feel ashamed for how much yummy you just indulged. So good you might as well just show up with a funnel to manage shoving the food into your face faster kinda good. Now, I can't go there too often because there are enough calories in any dish that I have to chain myself outside a city bus and just keep running for the next month.

5711045,2014-10-13,10,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"The food itself was great. It was a late minute decision to come here due to the fact that my favorite restaurant was close on Sunday's. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and ate 2/3 of it. The chicken was very moist to my surprise! And the waffles with bacon went well with the chicken. My friend ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict. She was nowhere close to finishing! 

Reasons for the two star deduction is basically customer service:
A) When we entered the young female in the front took a long time to figure out that there were customers waiting on her. And when we asked for an outside seating she said it will take 10 minutes. But her co-worker behind her says a table was ready for us. She seemed confused as we followed the guy to our outdoor seating. So communication on their part needs to be fixed. 

B) Our food came out in an orderly time (around 10 minutes) which wasn't bad for the humongous portions we were given. HOWEVER, the servers were sloppy when they handed us our plates. The First Lady brought in my friends plate first and clumsily lays it in front of her. As the plate dropped and the server turned, an orange slice slipped off the plate and landed on my friends lap. I've never seen anyone so careless in putting a plate down a table. 

Another different lady came in with my plate minutes after that and the presentation was just not pretty. The fried sage was literally hanging off the plate when I saw it coming. That's my biggest pet peeve because either they don't care about the way it looks (I doubt it since all of their food looks spectacular) or they are just overall clumsy. 

C) Lastly, the lack of customer interaction was just not there. I guess that's it's perks of being outside? After I got my check it took them a good 10 minutes to finally come back and check up on us. 

Even though my first experience here was rocky, I know I'll be back soon to hopefully redeem this great restaurant. Till next time.",Bhc91b8DfAYeceqhHRnqHA,10,10,3,VApstlJdh5G21UtQ5znQwA

Hash House is the place for people who just can't seem to get enough for breakfast, lunch, or any meal for that matter.  Monstrous portions is the name of the game.  The watermelon-kiwi drink seems to be the most popular, but I prefer the iced coffee drinks.  

Prices at this joint are a little steep, but the portions more than make up for that!

Just take, for example, what I ordered from their selection of benedicts: ""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken"" ($16.99 a bit pricey, but it's pretty much two meals). I ordered it not knowing what would arrive in front of me would be a well-thought out mound of food shaped in the form of an artful sculpture - I must've sat there for a good minute taking pictures as I attempted to figure out where to start chowing down.  It did not disappoint, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had a nice kick with that chipotle cream. YUM.

An extra bonus point for it coming out of the kitchen in rather quick timing (especially considering the busyness of Christmas Day that it was).

The environment is better than expected. I've been in Vegas for more than a few years and noticed every damn weekend driving by this place, HH has a crowd of people out in front.  This always discouraged me from trying, but crowds/waiting can be avoided if you travel alone or up to four by just heading to the bar area; they have the counter as well as bar tables.  If waiting can't be avoided, kill some time by checking out the celebrities that've stopped in - there are headshots all over the entrance.

If I come back for a huge party, it's gotta be pre-planned, reserved, or whatever because waiting for a table when you're hungry sucks.  But more likely is that I'll come back for the bar or happy hour (everyday, 3p-6p).",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,3,3,4,A0jeauNcmCFLUyL8onuiMA

The fried chicken was pretty good.  Had good texture & flavor.  The waffles on the other hand sucked.  They were kind of soft/soggy.  I prefer my waffles to be hard/crispy.  Dipping sauce is OK.  Huge portions as well.

Chicken Pot Pie - $15 - Decent/average 3/5
The chicken pot pie was massive.  It's pretty much a bucket of chicken pot pie; the serving size is easily big enough for 4-5 people to share this thing.  Its served on a ""bread bowl"", which is very reminiscent of a bread hat;  this bread had wasn't that good and tasted like a graham cracker (which does not go well w/ the soup).

The 1st time I tried the sage chicken. Absolutely no flavor. Their plating is just cute & large portions. Someone w/ a hangout or smoked a to of weed may enjoy it but someone looking for a great flavorful breakfast would be disappointed. 

I thought I would give them a 2nd chance I tried something a little simpler. I mean who could screw up breakfast (Eggs w/ cheese scrambled easy, chicken sausage, potatoes, fruit, & their signature drink w/ a shot of vodka). OMG was I wrooooooong!!! My eggs were fried too hard and cold, my sausage taste like it was cooked in the microwave, potatoes hand no seasoning & I didn't get my fruit. What was really gross I saw one of the staff picking food of a customers plate in the window.


What really made me decide to never return was the disgusting black crap in my shot of vodka! Not once but 3 times they brought me a dirty glass. I was so sick to my stomach b/c I poured the shot in my drink & was sipping on it till my friend noticed the black filth along the bottom of the shot glass. After the 2nd dirty shot glass I asked to speak to the manager Ryan he acted like he didn't see it. Dumb $$$ saw exactly what was in the glass he's a horrible actor. Finally he admitted to seeing the black crap. When he came back with the 3rd shot glass he said 3rd time is a charm & giggled. WTF!!! There was black crap along the rim of the glass again. No apology just some dumb ass remark. To add insult to injury this douche bag charges me for 3 shots I didn't even drink!! When the waitress brought the bill I asked to speak to him again. I told him I thought his comment was very inappropriate & why the f$&k am I being charged for sh*t I didn't drink due to their filthy establishment. I asked him did he even tell his staff to check the glasses. Did he see what was in the glasses what if I get sick. He said no he didn't check to see what it was but the douche bag had nerve to say uhhhh ohhh I'm pretty sure you won't get sick. How the heck do you know you jack @$$!! You don't even know what was in the glass. I called the health dept & will never return the 2 hour wait is defiantly not worth getting sick over nor is the food & service!

My husband had the sage fried chicken and waffles. He said they were amazing. They were HUGE, however, and he could only eat about 1/3 to 1/2 of it. Being in Vegas, it's not really feasible to take a to-go box with you. So, half his meal was left behind. I hate seeing all that food go to waste, so I wasn't thrilled about this.

I had the chicken and biscuits. It's served over country style mashed potatoes with delicious gravy. The potatoes, biscuits and gravy were all delicious, however my chicken was super dry. I could have used a LOT more gravy to help out with the chicken. Still, I finished most of it. The portion size was a lot better than the chicken and waffles. 

Price was average based on the amount of food we received.

It's off the beaten path from the bright lights of the Strip, but if you're tired of the same cookie-cutter and overhyped food there, you may want to check this place out.

After the drive into Vegas, we were all starving and we ended up eating here for a late dinner. Plus, we had a $50 gift cert from Restaurant.com that's only good for dinner, so that helped influence things. At first glance, the menu is mightily expansive. Everyone ordered all types of food, including chicken pot pie, salads, crab cakes and swordfish. The pot pie was especially a sight to behold. The crust resembled a UFO that had just crash landed on a planet full of chopped-up chicken and veggies. 

I settled on the sage fried chicken, which was accompanied with a waffle tower that has smoked bacon incorporated inside, drizzled with hot maple caramel syrup. There's something about eating a dish with a huge knife smack dab in the middle, standing upright, holding all of the bits and pieces of your food together. 

The dish was flanked by two huge fried chicken breasts, and when I took my first bite, it was nothing I had ever tasted before. Immediately, I tasted the hint of the sage herb throughout the meat, then the sweetness of the maple syrup on the fried outer crust from the skin. I must admit, although the white meat was juicy and tender, I wished I had a dark meat thigh or leg to gnaw on too.

The bacon-infused waffle was delicious, crispy on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. After eating two chicken breasts, I could only finish off a couple pieces of the waffle. I was more than stuffed. Plus, my taste buds were getting numb from the sweetness of the dish. It's a good thing I'm in Vegas, there was plenty of night left to burn it off. And if this were a Man vs. Food challenge, I would obviously sigh and agonize in defeat.

But no matter, I know for a fact that I would want a rematch in the near future. A different dish, perhaps one of their signature house hashes or farm scrambles.

They made up for it by giving us a side of bacon but it was not the same.
At least they wanted to make us happy, so I cannot complain, but it does get very busy in there and it seems the staff gets a little spread thin.

The service every time I've been here has been excellent. They have always strived to make the dining experience shine. Their knowledge of their products and their friendly yet professional demeanor are very high pluses. Edmund, our waiter, was great at explaining everything and keeping us happy.

Okay- the dinner menu isn't the shining star of the restaurant. I feel as they go for quantity but in doing so the quality of the food is shot, not greatly but still noticeably. 

Bad- there want anything I found bad. If I had to find something to be picky about its the prices of the drinks. A bit steep.",SlCXIWAYwL_itoM_gHuzQw,1,0,4,PBERontExSvxFxseE9_dYQ

5778888,2015-06-27,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Many restaurants have very poor presentation with their various food dishes. This is not the case with Hash House. Hash House has great presentation and their portions are gigantic. You can really get TOO full if you eat your whole meal in one sitting. This being said, the flavor of their various dishes is surprisingly not that great, which truly surprises me. One would think that with their eye for detail they would also take a closer look at their food preparation. But, that's just my opinion...

In terms of location and seating: there can be no doubt, this restaurant is a Las Vegas hot spot. On the central portion of Sahara Ave., close to everything, a lot of people come here. Their parking lot is easy to access but it can get crowded. 

Hash House A Go Go is a large restaurant with a nice atmosphere, that has a lot of seating. For the most part the seating is well spaced giving you plenty of room to enjoy your food, drink, and conversation. I recommend asking for a booth where you will have more privacy instead of one of the free standing tables in their central dining area. They also have outdoor seating. The weather permitting, you can sit outside if you desire. 

As Hash House is a LV hot spot, expect a wait if you come during peak hours. The one thing I will say is that even if there is a wait they seat you quickly and the time they tell you your wait will be is the time you wait. They are not like one of those restaurants where their standard answer is ten minutes and you wait thirty.

Overall, Hash House is a place to eat but not a great place to eat.",KGXWpnGr-KS9HAfV0YUDgg,1,0,3,nz3u_C_fwRRUwBmJzwtjwQ

5781055,2011-01-04,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Yes, yes, the portions sizes are outrageous (the chicken salad sandwich was pushing 12 inches high) and the food excessive (a bacon bloody mary aka the BLT Mary), both of which are fine. But let's be honest here - the real highlight of going to Hash House A Go Go is the utterly amazing buttermilk biscuits and fresh fruit preserves! 

The service here is really good too - super friendly and attentive. But back to the biscuits. They were massive in size, like everything else here, but baked perfectly that they had a crust to support the weight of the peach and pear preserves when spooned on yet still soft and chewy in the middle. Delicious. Shame on all of you other diners in the restaurant who didn't touch their biscuits. Don't you know there are starving people in the corner booth (aka me) who would love to have it for their own? No, really, you don't know what you missed out on.

As for the rest of the food, it's decent. Other than the massive portions garnished with a twig of rosemary, I don't know that the dishes are exceptionally unique. And the drinks, it's kind of the like the food. Everything done in excess and for show. Granted, the Bud in a Bag is funny enough that you should get it just for the photo op. And the BLT Mary, well why not?, you're already taking a year off your life with the plate of food you're consuming in front of you. But honestly, come here for the biscuits and preserves. It's worth the hour plus wait you're guaranteed to experience when you come here for breakfast/brunch/lunch.",4zoP_fSKKYa75YY4ua5h-A,1,1,4,qAwJP65fmKw_Jxv5i1cPdA

They actually have really interesting stuff on the menu that sound really appetizing.  I wish I could've just ordered everything I wanted, but there was no way no how i'd be able to do that.  My BF and I decided to split a plate since it was our first meal of the day.  We had the rosemary fried chicken with bacon waffle and leeks- $14.95.  It's definitely not chicken and roscoes!!!!  The chicken was extremely dry, hard and almost inedible.  Waffle was too thick and not moist and fluffy; it was also dry.  The only saving grace on that plate were the leeks, and I would say it was there more for decorative purpose.  I'd pass on this dish.  We also had two eggs, sunny side up, for an additional $2.95.  This excluded the $2.50 fee they add on for those who split a plate.  The rest of my party enjoyed pancakes and the basics!.  Everything is just ginormous!!!  The pictures posted give a rime example of the sizes/portions.  Even the kids pancake is huge, and definitely not bad for 4.95?  It was cheap!  

The restaurant is pretty spacious and I appreciate the big booths they have.  I can't really say the decoration stood out to me though.  I can't pinpoint anything specific about it.

Service was slow and rushed at the same time, if that even makes sense.  She took really long to greet us, but when she finally did she was eager to take our orders.  No ""good morning"", or ""welcome to hash house"".  It was my first time there so it would've been nice to have been greeted with a welcoming hello.  After she took our orders, it was a realllllllly long time before we saw her, or our food.  I flagged someone down inquiring about our food and then they finally came out, cold.  Blah.

Overall, I think I want to give this place another shot, but it will probably be a while before I venture out again.  In the mean time i'll stick to the more ""normal"" breakfast spots out there....

Even when drunk this was way too much food for me. The chicken was flavorful, a bit over cooked though. Bacon in the waffles were a hit but the main theme for the meal was quite salty. The B.L.T.

Prices were also reasonable to the portion sizes, but I find that to be a draw-back, as I really don't want THAT much food, especially for breakfast/brunch!  Also, now that I am thinking of it, the food was actually somewhat bland  - most notably, the gravy and the potatoes.  I had a scramble which was pretty good though, its just that all the sides went to a waste.

Drinks were good - I had the champagne supernova, which is like a mojito made with prosecco rather than rum, which was good!  

Service was friendly when it was there, but the server wasn't at our table very often and we couldn't really figure out WHO was our server - perhaps this is because we were seating in the bar area (about a 20 min F/A wait), I'm not sure.

We were also charged the wrong price for an entree, and decided to speak with the manager - who, sadly, argued with us rather than just talking care of the problem.  Disappointing.

When it came out, it was taller than me (sitting down, of course). I was very surprised that the chicken were 2 thick pieces of huge breast meat.

I ordered the Mahi Mahi with blue crab cake ($27). The presentation looked like I was at a fancy 5 stars restaurant; it was gorgeous. The taste was different but good enough for me to almost finished the entire entree. The dish started out with a bed of two mounds of mashed potatoes, then layered with with two pieces of Mahi Mahi and then the blue crab cake which was covered with the pesto sauce.

morning 1 - got here a little before 8am. didnt have to wait, got seated right away.  our waitress was cindy, super pleasant and nice.  i ordered one of the house favorite scrambles with roasted chicken, corn, roasted peppers, and mozzarella cheese. it also came with a biscuit, fruit (which was melon and pineapple), and your choice of griddled mashed potatoes or crispy potatoes (i got the griddled mashed potatoes).  my wife ordered the tractor driver combo with 2 eggs, bacon (extra crispy), and the vanilla waffle.  we both enjoyed our meals and really wanted to try other dishes which is why we came back for.....

....morning 2 - got here a little later today. around 830.  and boy what a difference that made. it was a lot more crowded and we had to wait 10 minutes to get seated.  altho nothing compared to the hours that some other yelpers had to wait!  today i ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles.  this thing was HUGE.  my wife ordered 2 breakfasts today because she could not make up her mind and it was our last day in vegas so we were not gonna be back here for a while.  she got the farm scramble with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, and onions (it came with swiss cheese but she ordered it without).  AND she also ordered the granola waffle.  that did not stop her from eating part of my breakfast.  she was gonna order the bacon waffle but since she saw my breakfast came with it, she decided to do the granola waffle and just help herself to my bacon waffle.  fed wife = happy wife.

We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken stacked with bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks ($16.95).

The bacon waffles, however, were somethin' else!  They were seriously out of this world!  I'm typically not a waffle fan, but the fact that the bacon was fried within the waffle was simply amazing!  :)  The presentation of the dish was pretty cool too (waffles and chicken stacked on top of each other with a knife sticking right in the middle).

* Peculiar meat loaf
* Stale coffee
* Watery hot chocolate for $4.50
* Gargantuan portions

This gimmick of this place is comically heaping portions served on platters the size of toilet seats. That makes up for the mediocre food.  The oversized cutlery is another source of amusement. It's like they got a good deal on all this jumbo dinnerware and decided to build a theme around it. Throw in a dorky slogan (""Twisted Farm Food"") and you have a sure-fire formula.

The popularity of this establishment demonstrates how easily manipulated people are. It was featured on a TV show. It MUST be good, right? I was suckered into having a meal here but I wasn't captivated by the herd instinct that keeps the throngs flocking in.

I had a meat loaf hash. My culinary experience has not encompassed many types and varieties of meat loaf, so for all I know this was a special gourmet meat loaf that I have not been properly schooled to appreciate. To me it was just peculiar. The waitress informed me that it's a combination of pork and beef. The meat seemed overly ripe. It was compressed like salami, not flaky like typical meatloaf. The hash had big hunks of salami-like meat loaf, home fries, spinach and peppers.

The hash is served in a heavy cast iron skillet. The rock-hard biscuit had a sprig of Rosemary poking out of it like a Christmas tree.  There was also a dry Paul Bunyan-sized flapjack accompanied by tiny beaker of syrup not nearly enough to sweeten the flapjack. With the oversized theme, why wouldn't they provide a quart jar of syrup?

The hot chocolate came in a bowl-sized mug with chocolate syrup drizzled on the saucer and sprinkles of cinnamon and syrup on top.  Marshmallows floated in the chocolate. I suppose that makes it worth $4.50 even though it was just an envelope of Nestles mixed with too much lukewarm water.

The music is way too loud. They were out of wheat bread, so we had to take rye toast that was just thick slices of stale bread. The coffee had that acrid, overly cooked, bottom-of-the-pot taste.

The room has a strange industrial decor with panels of diamond-tread aluminum and semi-gloss stainless steel. Pointless steel cables sort of lace the whole place together. I would rather eat in a place that emphasizes good food over an oddball decor.

On top of that we weren't served water.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,6,5,1,J9Eq3T5AouxkJ-NB11I2Cw

The wait time was pretty long considering we came in for lunch. The food finally arrived, and was as we expected enormous, but very delicious. Our server was very nice, but the service was definitely lacking.  All in all, the service was mediocre. At one point two of the servers had a small chit chat right in front of our table (and I mean practically standing over us) while they were holding dirty plates from a table they just cleared. Pretty awkward. The whole meal took about an hour and a half, kind of long if you came on your lunch hour, but the quality/quantity of food makes up for the wait.",Bu-Ig31R1amjBZLyq0FICA,1,0,3,dI4BpqbcTllO3HhkfMyNXg

No need to dress up in your leotards, a tutu, and/or your dance shoes (not that I did that or anything, because I always wear my Capezio's when going for breakfast).  I just thought with the name, I'd go all out.  While dancing is not discouraged, it's also not a dance club (like I MAY have thought).  Instead, I partook of what they do offer here: GROSSLY HUGE food.  

BREAKFAST -- You have to try their famous breakfast items: fried chicken & waffles (comes stacked high practically to the ceiling), the pancake (size of a Fiat), and lots of good egg/omelet choices (I like the chicken hash & eggs), and warm buttermilk biscuits with freshly-made jam.  Good Lord!

LUNCH/DINNER -- Meatloaf (be civil, it's a massive portion.  Eat half and be sure not make a spectacle of yourself.  Then, drive 2 blocks away to an empty parking lot and eat the other half in the car), the BBBLT (mmmmm lots of bacon, a whole pig worth), and their stuffed hamburger (1 pounder, impossible to eat the whole thing...again, head for the parking lot 2 blocks away).

SALADS/HEALTHY -- Huh?  Whatever. 

SERVICE -- My favorite is Melina - whenever she was working, I'd always ask for her.  She's fun, and shows great customer service. Always terrific.  The hostesses are super sweet, and keep the waiting hungry customers moving as quick as possible.  The only way they could be nicer is if they offered small pieces of fried chicken to customers while waiting to be seated. 

WAITING -- No reservations, so my recommendation is to be there early before 930am.  If you get there at 10am or later, be prepared to wait 20-45 mins.  Again, no fried chicken served while you wait.   Pffff!

PARKING -- Ample private lot, and since it is way off strip by a few miles -- you have elbow room on the streets, so no need to play bumper cars.

CONCLUSION -- It's AWESOME.  I love, I love, I love  I've returned many times, and you will, too.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,3,3,5,0wQ7zI41JCHBEouOackhYg

My husband and I came here on a Saturday morning for brunch. The wait time was about 20 minutes, which I did not mind and was expecting anyway, seeing how crowded the restaurant was. The waiting area was pretty small, but it was fun looking at the autographed pictures of celebrities that they had on their wall, such as Penn and Teller, Ne-Yo, and Neil Patrick Harris. 

Melissa was our server. She was alright, but not the greatest. It took a while for her to greet us and take our orders, but I understand that they were extremely busy. After we got our food, she did check up on us twice, but did not refill our drinks once. The thing that annoyed me was that she seemed extra friendly to the party who sat in back of us. I heard her asking them if this was their first time at the restaurant, and they responded that it was. She gave them a friendly welcome and explained the menu to them. That's funny, it was our first visit here as well and she never bothered to ask us that!

My husband and I decided to share the chicken and waffles. We also ordered two sides - bacon and the biscuits and gravy to avoid the $2.50 split plate charge. 
Just an FYI: yes, they charge $2.50 if you are splitting plates, but you can avoid it if you order a side dish.
I have to say, the presentation of our food and everyone else's around us was nice and pretty! But, I wasn't impressed. The chicken was dry, and even though the waffles looked awesome because they had strips of bacon cooked into them, it didn't taste that great. Our order got screwed up as well. Apparently our biscuits and gravy = a side of sausage. 

I'm willing to give Hash House A Go Go another try in the future. Maybe we just ordered the wrong dish. But it's definitely not somewhere that I am dying to come back to again.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,2,3,C7IA256K2NNPCLo6RNFUVQ

Orange juice: definitely fresh and quite delicious!

Chicken and waffles: soft waffle, delicious chicken. Definite recommend along with a side of chipotle cream sauce. 

Farm scramble with sun dried tomato and goat cheese: yum, but sun dried tomato was a bit overpowering. Biscuit is nice and buttery. Mashed potatoes were amazing! Very buttery, just the right consistency of chunky to smooth...get this over the bland crispy potatoes. 

Cobb salad: gigantic and yum! chicken was dry and oddly sweet, but they sure didn't skimp on the blue cheese and bacon!

Tamara C was our waitress, she took a very long time to get to our table to take our order. We had 2 other waitresses help us and ask If we needed anything before she ever got there.

I ordered the 2 egg basic breakfast with turkey sausage which end really chicken sausage but the waitress didn't even tell me that. I asked for it to be well done, well...... the sausage came out not well done and the eggs were very wet still and were not fully cooked. When the waitress came back to the table I asked if she could please take it back and have it cooked well done. Her answer was well I told them to make it well done and then she rolled her eyes and took off to get some plates to transfer my undercooked, underwhelming food back. She should have never rolled her eyes, this was extremely unprofessional and she should have just said no problem let me have that fixed for you.

When I was a waitress we never made it the customers fault although sometimes it could have been. We never put blame on our cooks or anything of the sort. We just pleasantly said let me have that corrected for you!

So the moral of the Story is she gas overwhelmed by how many tables she had which was very obvious, and she should choose a new line of work since she is not cut out for that one.

I will never be back and that was not worth $40 without the tip. Oh and did I mention after all that crappy service my boyfriend decided she should still get a tip even though I complained about giving her one.

Everyone seems to love to come here. My first encounter with HHAGG was in San Diego, about 5 or 6 years ago. I was impressed by the portions, decor and service, but not the flavors. I hate to say it, but that trend has continued since going to the one here in Vegas as well. 

I understand the appeal and I don't hate the fact that everyone I know likes to frequent this place for special occasions or lunch. There are definitely some appetizing things on the menu, I'm just not a devotee. Although I won't put up a fight if my friends want to go. Most of the food is just ok. I think the problem I have with most of their dishes is that there are just too many flavors going on. You can't taste the actual food. Also, a lot of their proteins (chicken, pork, beef) are overcooked and dry.  It's all concept and no execution as far as most of the dishes go. The food is just very regular, despite the enormous portions and spectacular presentation. 

One thing I enjoy at HHAGG is the breakfasts. I enjoy the hashes and scrambles quite a bit, so if you're going to come, come for breakfast or brunch. There drinks are quite good and pretty as well.

Our waitress came promptly and we were checked on just frequently enough to get any refills or to-go boxes (trust me, you'll need them).

5972686,2012-08-03,3,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Hung over and tired of all the buffets and expensive overrated eateries on The Strip? Well...Hash House a Go Go might just be what you're looking for! It's located off The Strip, but it's a great place for breakfast and brunch.

I came here with a fairly large party and we were seated almost immediately. With a table full of foodies, we decided to order several dishes to share. This allowed us to try a little bit of everything, which was fantastic! Some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: HH Famous Meatloaf, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Corned Beef House Hash, Griddled French Toast, Roasted Pork Tenderloin, and Chicken and Waffles. My favorite was the Griddled French Toast; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. It included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. The combination was absolutely orgasmic and I highly recommend it! Another dish that stood out was the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that I am used to. It was different, but delicious. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.

The portions were humungous and very nicely presented. Their drinks are also a hit too--especially their kiwi watermelon lemonade and various mimosas! Our waitress was patient and courteous too, so don't forget to visit this place the next time you're in town!",bm2DqfP4P454FjEtCbZdkQ,5,4,5,QgtViHiJOP6BgDJYzV9xfA

Besides, just order a delicious Blood Mary and you'll be perfectly satiated until the food comes.  

We ordered a couple dishes to share, and our friend was skeptical that it would be enough food.  I wish I took a picture of his expression when the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict was set on the table. I had been raving about this dish, and once again, it did not disappoint.  Three of us polished off this plate easily.  You just can't go wrong with this item. 

We also shared the Brown Sugar Banana Flap Jacks which bigger than the actual plate is was served on.  And upon first bite- I was in heaven.  It is sooo delicious.

5982770,2011-07-05,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I've wanted to go here for several years after searching for 'unique food in Vegas' and 'best breakfast in Vegas'.  I finally convinced my family to go during a trip to Vegas for a quick fireworks loaded weekend.

Food is presented as 'twisted farm food' and it's no lie.  The food is hardcore, unique, and massively portioned.  If you get one of their benedicts, or even a pancake or two, I recommend to share amongst at least 2 people.

I had their snickers pancake and their kiwi watermelon lemonade to drink.   The pancake was massive and scattered with half melted nougaty peanuty chocolaty mini snickers.  It was extremely filling and quite good.  It was just what you would think it would taste like, and I could barely finish the entire thing.  The lemonade was quite good... sort of a tangy drink with the mellow aftertaste of watermelon.  My mother had the blackberry granola pancake and it was quite tangy, but very good.

I was with my family so nothing too interesting was had... but many people in the place were getting the various benedicts they offer, and they looked amazing.

The place is a tad expensive, but for its unique take on some dishes, and the massive portions they offer, I highly recommend it.  If you want an awesome breakfast, I do recommend skipping the cheap Vegas cafe and coming here for something quite nice.",bDga4MH5qZ7syPWI-FVeBg,1,0,5,O66aJDFDB9DmrfD2gz0mLw

The place gets busy, we went on a Sunday so it was packed. The bar (section attached to bar) is first come first serve. Bar tables are not, which is a bummer but it probably because they get so busy. They also won't seat you unless you have your entire party. Go early otherwise wait can be 45-hour. Service is good, they get really busy so everyone is just working and working.

5986588,2012-06-11,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"Wife and I went to the Sahara location this past weekend 6/9/12; I had been to this location several times, this was her first time at any HHaGG.  I have learned to stick with the chicken and waffles, as I always tend to regret ordering other things on the menu.  Not that the other items aren't good, it's just that the sandwiches, skillets, etc. are on par with other breakfast places.  The chicken and waffles here are IMO the best item on the menu, and the best I've had in town (compared to M&M, Gritz).  

As previously stated by everyone else, the portions are HUGE. We knew this, and decided to share this dish, and ordered a side of biscuits and gravy (actually, only 1 biscuit). The menu suggests a $2.50 split plate charge, but the waitress just brought us an empty plate, and we did it ourselves for free!  Good times.

The biscuits and gravy are VERY good, but VERY rich, with chunks of meat and creamy goodness that fills the little bowl.  The biscuit is soft, flaky, and resists soaking from the gravy well, giving you a nice consistent texture, without mushiness.  I dare say the FLAVOR of the biscuit and gravy is now my favorite thing at HHaGG. The problem is it so rich, I would find it hard to make a full meal out of it.  Sharing a side is the way to go for this gutbomb!  Even splitting, we still left a waffle (sans bacon, of course) behind.",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,2,1,4,U5Xe0mGeZCiBslNFhBMMnA
5987388,2013-02-22,0,g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,"I have to confess I was skeptical about coming here because I thought it might be one of those places that's really famous because it was featured on Man v. Food but doesn't live up to the hype. I am pleased to report that this place definitely lives up to expectations.

First, if you're looking at this review I'm guessing it probably won't be news to you that the portions are HUGE. Seriously, HUGE. The plates are more like dinner platters that you'd see in a buffet. Lots of people seem to order the MvF featured item: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I did not indulge, but my buddies did. Let me tell you, this thing was impressive. It's a sky high platter filled with mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. They bury a knife in it for scale.

I opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. Flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits. 

If you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. Spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be. The double double lattes are also really great.

This place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (go here and NOT to the one on the Strip). Next time I'm planning to try one of the burgers, they looked incredible.",HMXi4ySve0_SNvLxwz1Vfg,0,0,5,QewkSnmMfVtoBlZNraqX7w

Now, don't get me wrong...the food is pretty good.....I wouldn't call it a gourmet breakfast or anything, it's just not the best place I've been for breakfast food. The portions are HUGE, of course, that's what they are famous for.....you can more than likely share your entree with someone. 

Service wasn't so great on the day we went......one of the people at our  table ordered fries, but they came back much later to tell him they had run out (how do you run out of fries?) anyways, they brought him an alternative and said they wouldn't charge anything, but low and behold, the imaginary fries were on the bill. Just kind of annoying, that's all.
