1230041,2015-03-08,1,YPTR9EI2w75WeuCnS_JJXw,"While visiting Vegas for a short weekend getaway, I came by the new Grand Bazaar Shops, which is right in front of Bally's. I am surprised to find out from some of the stores that this place barely opened up last week (Vegas truly changes from month to month).

I think it is great that this little shopping area opened up, as there really wasn't anything here before, except for the long walkway leading to Bally's Hotel front entrance. 

But I would say that about 40-50% of the stores are still ""coming soon"", but I am sure the next time I come visit here (which I am sure will be in the distant future... it's Vegas, how can I stay away?) It will be busy and booming. Anyways, with a ton of stores right next to each other, it reminded me of the Pacific mall in Canada. Most of the stores are of a very little space and most of the stores has an employee just waiting by the front door trying to get some business. There are a few stores that are 2 or even 3 times the size as the other stores, but this place for now is pretty much dead at the moment. 

And the stores that are here are pretty expensive. Like one of the stores I walked into was a sock store. This store has some really fun socks (like the Superman & Batman socks have caps on the back of each pair) but the prices were pretty expensive ($10-18 for most). 

There is a waffle place, The Lionesse Beauty Bar, Havaianas sandal store and such. Towards the back of one of the aisles, there is a guy who is selling his artfully talented art work made with the use of spray paints, ripped pages of the phone book, napkins and other scraps of paper (each painting is going for $43, includes tax). 

Give this place some more time for more stores to open up, this place will be a nice place to browse around (would be nice for there to be more shade in this area though).",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,3,1,3,bq-5VMc2HwM_LyHaJqUByw

Lots of variety, but currently about a third of the storefronts are still listed as ""coming soon""- among them a gelato shop, a new location of Bronze Cafe, and a Ramen-ya. 

Available businesses include Hawaii Cookie Co, a waffle shop, and Turkish Ice Cream, along with several boutique-type stores (Swarovski, Alex & Ani, Lush, a kids luggage store?) and even one that sells photos of fake Vegas marriages to fool your friends, family, and social media following. 

TIP: It's a bit confusing to get to these shops because there's no signage from Bally's-  from that casino, if you just head toward the valet area and walk across the street.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,6,3,-HktRaA1Yz_Q7e8sk2N4EQ

Let me tell you a little something about the Grand Bazaar.

Now there is nothing wrong with the selection of shops and eateries here: they've got a ton of random little stores that 1) make for some real good window shopping and 2) actually house something you may want or need.
I'm most thankful to find a Honolulu Cookie Company so comfortably tucked away in the corner . . . cause I love me those cookies.

What I really couldn't get over was the trek getting there . . . that was truly bizarre.

When has the Strip been littered with so many people relentlessly selling timeshares and stuff?  Dude, it's hella crazy.

Without getting into too much graphic detail, I had to make sure to averted my little ones eyes from the more adult themed stuff they were peddling on more than one occasion.  It was really quite disturbing and gross and goes against the notion of Vegas as a more family oriented destination.  Moreover, how effective is that kind of advertising in this day and age anyways?  I mean everyone knows the best place to find adult entertainment is through yelp.  duh.  search strippers.  enter.  boom.  and then uber yourself over to one of these very fine establishments.

Truth to be told, I rarely go the Strip anymore and after this recent visit, I'm definitely restricting my outings to a couple choice casinos and the Honolulu Cookie Company.
Oh the perils I go through for those cookies.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,37,29,3,4-NY-A2JrVNp3S6yZ72nQA

There are still a lot of empty shop spaces at the Grand Bazaar Shops. And the shops that are there aren't really shops where I would purchase anything. None are really destination shops (as in someone would make a trip here to go to that store). And none really struck me as necessity shops either (as in a tourist might go there because they need or forgot to pack X, Y, or Z). It was rather uncrowded when I came here on a Saturday afternoon. And I didn't really see anyone walking around with shopping bags. So is anyone actually spending money here? I enjoyed myself window shopping, but I didn't purchase anything. There were some food places that looked good, though. Those would probably the thing that would draw me back. It's a fine enough place to walk around and kill time. And maybe even get a bite to eat.

Other than the more open space that leads up to Bally's entrance, the other narrow claustrophobic aisles of the outer shops feel more like walking down a cell block than a outdoor market.  Most of the shops down these back aisles have gone out of business since our last visit, leaving just a few weary faced vendors peering out of their tiny cubicles.  As we walked through there recently there was nary a single other person in sight. The future of this section of the shops is dire at best.  Even our one favorite shop, The Honolulu Cookie Company, has moved on to greener pastures at The Palazzo.

Could this be why I never even knew about the Grand Bazaar Shops? I ended up down here exploring the shops by default because there was an Elite Yelp Event that was taking place. Located right outside of the Bally's Hotel And Casino you will find this place. Restaurants, Shopping, Dining and sometimes live entertainment is what you can expect. Don't get yourself too thrilled about it though because it's not as big as you may think.

I could have easily given a 2 star review back when there was a lot of empty businesses and terrible food options. Now they have a good variety of food options and most of the spaces are filled with tenants. You can enter the Grand Bazaar Shops from the Strip, but I usually enter through Bally's. Swarovski has a ""Midnight Celebration"" light and sound show every night at 9 pm. You'll want to have your camera ready when you see the Swarovski Starburst lit up it's so beautiful! The Swarovski Starburst is a 14 foot in diameter custom designed LED light fixture and you can't miss it. For food I absolutely do not recommend Pisa Pizza, instead definitely go to Giordano's for some amazingly delicious deep-dish pizza instead. Ramen-Ya, Redneck Riviera and Wahlburgers are notable mentions and once Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken opens you'll want to try their Mac and Cheese.
