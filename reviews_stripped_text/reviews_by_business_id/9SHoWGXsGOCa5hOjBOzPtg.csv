No fresh onion, bean sprouts. etc.  This was certainly NOT made from scratch although the girl assured me it was.   It tasted like a pre-made, pre-pressed patty of .... not sure.... salty paste?

I had the orange chicken lunch special, which comes with orange chicken, fried rice, noodles and an egg roll.  The chicken was really low quality, all dark meat.  The orange sauce didn't really taste like much of anything, the rice was hard and the noodles had an odd sour taste to them like they had gone bad.  The egg roll was fine.

I've only ever tried their lunch specials, which are a ridiculously good value. $6 will get you a couple pounds of food, including an entree, two sides (fried rice and chow mein), an egg roll, and a soup. I couldn't come close to finishing, and even with a 10 minute drive back to work my food was still roughly the temperature of the sun. Food quality itself was average, there were clumps of white rice mixed in with the fried rice and some of the vegetables were a touch undercooked.

It had a funky flavor, different than what I'm used to ordering from other chinese takeout I have gotten in the past.

I left explicit instructions in the order to send me a text message when they were here so I could come to security to pick up the food. 20 minutes after the food was supposed to have been delivered, I chatted into GrubHub support who, after 15 minutes of trying to call them because they didn't answer the phone, said they dropped it off and tried to call. Because I'm at work, my phone is off, and I've got email alerts set for my text messages, which is why I clearly said send me a text message. 

So I finally go to security to be greeted with a dripping bag of food. The cheap and flimsy styrofoam containers they used had completely fallen apart, probably because they took hot as food and put it in styrofoam, which then melted. So, not only can they not follow simple instructions, they also use shoddy delivery materials that resulted in me not even being able to eat.

I was greeted when I walked in but then was ignored for almost 10 minutes even though I was at the counter and ready. The cashier even answered a phone call before even asking me what I would like to eat. 10 minutes isn't usually a big deal, but usually in that amount of time I am asked right away if I'd like a few minutes or not before ordering.

After ordering, I waited in a booth. It didn't take very long but I did notice that the place needed cleaning, but since it was my first time there, I don't know if it always looks like it needs to be cleaned (walls, divider, floors, everything). 

The cashier let me know it was ready, and seemed to be kind at that moment, so I tipped them a dollar and took my food to go. 

I ordered the chicken and broccoli, which came with fried rice, chow mein, and egg drop soup. Overall the meal was okay, I probably won't visit again unless I want to just stay near home for Chinese food.",dYXkcwz6Xs8cFCtGfihE7A,3,1,2,x1_3oVqGO0PpuZvhMLjhFA

There was so much breading on it that you basically ate mushy sweet and sour bread. The generals chicken was also the same. Hardly any meat and overly breaded. It also made us sick.

4048664,2015-06-22,0,9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg,"Somewhere between lackluster and bad is a spot called China Joe's. 

Got the lunch special with teriyaki chicken. Didn't ask if it was here or to-go so they assumed to-go and chose the egg roll for me instead of the soup. Whatever. Judging by the other reviews they were doing me a favor.  

The chicken was overdone and almost chewy like when you microwave leftover fried chicken too long. The sauce tasted OK but was too runny and most of it was in a pool at the bottom of the chicken. 

Fried rice was uneventful. Not bad, just meh. 

The egg roll was disappointing. Just a paste inside of a crispy roll. Refused to soak any soy dripped in. The flavor was lacking. Was like a fried gruel roll. 

The lo mein was a disgrace. Overcooked noodles with no seasoning. So bland I could actually pick up the subtle notes of the tap water it was cooked in. In fact, it just tasted like solidified tap water. I used some of the sauce left over from the chicken with a bit of soy to add something to it but all it was like was diluting sauce with water.

4558284,2013-02-09,4,9SHoWGXsGOCa5hOjBOzPtg,"I have really, really mixed feelings about this place. I mean, you can't deny that feeding a large family with Chinese food for like $40 is a pretty good deal. Plus they seem to make the food when you order it, so that's cool, too. But here's the rub: the food isn't the best!

I've come here on a few occasions where I've got family coming over to my house and I need to produce food on the quick. Since some people in my family are not cool with pizza, I usually run to a place like this to load up. So when I come here, it's not because I'm hungry or I want to eat here -- it's more like ""I need to feed five humans!"" To that end, this place is cool! Like I said before, I've been able to feed everyone, and have leftovers, with about $40. That's a good deal in my book when you consider the amount of feed they/we eat, plus the leftovers. I usually have enough for dinner later that night, and maybe even breakfast/lunch the next day. See, the food there is inexpensive. Plus they have these coupons they give you where you get free rangoons or rice or whatever after you spend a certain amount (I think it was $25 and $30, respectively). 

The downside is that the food sometimes takes longer than I'd like. I guess that's what happens when you get your food made to order, but still. Also, the food there isn't really as Chinese as I'd like it to be. By that I mean that a few of the items I've had (strawberry chicken, orange chicken and sweet-and-sour pork) seem to be really the same dish with a different protein. With the chicken, they use this fried-up chicken balls and throw some sauce on the top. Seriously. I can do that at home for like 1/3 the price. Really you get the same chicken with a different sauce. Not the business. I guess a lot of other restaurants do the same thing, but come on, guys. Step it up. I'll pay an extra few bucks for better chicken. 

All in all, will I return here? Yes. My mom loves this place, it's cheap, and it's close to home. I cannot beat the convenience afforded by this place.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,7,1,3,WgDb3JtvlRD_GcOzHcCiDw

The prices are pretty cheap and right up there with a meal from McDonalds. I don't know, they probably cook better than Panda Express if you ask me. Consistency wise, Panda has it.

If you like shrimp this would probably be a pleasant surprise...Unfortunately for me, I am allergic. As my wife finished off the leftovers there were several pieces of shrimp mixed into our pork fried rice. 

This is basically an unacceptable mistake in my mind. Good thing I was prepared with my allergy meds.
