Best part is that it's also a 7/11 so i can grab a cold one before my walk home.",28FjBd4OW2neMCP7kLTPbg,0,0,5,6wKnedBjTgBWs3q4elFuaA
1622346,2017-11-12,1,bU4pwOlhicUKtPfefTGMQA,"Now keep in mind my review is for late night stops while getting gas and coming home from Cali/leaving vegas.  So, it might be time sensitive, however, this is my honest opinion none the less.

I've gone here several times and each time I go the food is usually a bit over cooked and stale.  Not to mention that Jack in the box tends to have greasy food anyways but greasy, over done and stale is not always a pleasant combination ;)  I do return because it's often the only place that's open (and it's still better than gas station food at 3 am) on the exit and i'm trying to get back onto I-15 quickly.  It's not the most terrible thing out there, but it's far from the best.

Plus almost every time I go they're quite slow for fast food.",LuQAXoyyFec6JvtBH3IHCQ,1,0,2,jXCF6vp828zGaZYea3xR2A

This place made me late for work that's how long the food took. I'm allergic to tomatoes and I said that. The woman replies ""ok so no tomatoes"".
Low and behold mine had ketchup on it....glad I let them know my allergy. Thanks for almost having my throats close up.

Ordered one onion ring and one nugget and got two orders of nuggets. The only thing right about our order was my friends drink and she got it herself ""/",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,0,0,1,50N8tviqNQUr-1Rzek9XlQ

Why is it every time I visit any Jack in the Box location my Kaspersky virus scanner software bombards me with popups to block certain domains? While I thank Jack in the Box for providing wifi its not a good service if your computer downloads spyware, adware, and installs a bunch of cookies. Jack in the Box needs to get their act together with the intrusive wifi they use.",dnvV2OOzOPeyadHaW7gopw,0,0,1,EEVi1x6ix_JhMbtHJkd3_w

The coupon was not expired. The staff spoke to be in a demeaning tone.,6NK3jFV7T0oOIt2lRaSBUA,0,0,1,rtHEszDyoL_-OhpTE-0MBQ
