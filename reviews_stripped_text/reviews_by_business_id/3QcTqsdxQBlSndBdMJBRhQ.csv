52534,2017-03-19,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"Let me first start off by saying.. don't waste your time. This place had 4 occupied tables, (ours included).Once we were seated I asked for 3 waters. After waiting 15 minutes a server finally came over without water, and let us know she wasn't sure if she would be out server or if it would be someone else but she wanted to go ahead a get our order started. I again asked for waters and our beverages. After 10 more minutes we finally were brought our drinks. 

20 minutes later, our food finally came out. What a disappointment. Advertising a ""piled high"" Pastrami, what was on the plate was 4 small compressed slices of pastrami with little to no flavor (I added a picture of what we got). There were 2 choices of soup. The Rock soup (described in the menu an a daily collection of fresh vegetables by the chef) and a beer cheese soup. We ordered the Rock soup and it was broccoli and cheese. We were told after the fact that the Rock soup is the soup of the day. 2 soup choices. Both cheese soups. Try renaming Rock soup to ""soup of the day"".
We also ordered a wedge salad which comes with Blue Cheese dressing, or so the menu says. Needless to say, there was none. After tracking down the server, I asked for 2 sides of Blue cheese. When the waiter brought it to me they only brought 1 side. I then found my server asked for the 2nd side of dressing as requested and never saw him the rest of our stay. I finally after 5 minutes or so asked another server for it and she brought it to me. 

The staff is not knowledgeable about the menu, lacks listening skills and quite frankly acted as if they didn't want to bothered to do the job they were hired for. 

The point is, if you're going to have a restaurant or any business for that matter, maybe you should make sure you train and hire people that make the customer experience a pleasant one.  

The only good experience was having our parking validated by the bartender in the restaurant because the wait staff didn't want to be bothered.",90XKldx4ym6KVLw0AH5NgQ,4,0,1,cPriBObit25iVJhAYYJsVQ

We sat at the bar and there was only one other party sitting next to us. the gentleman taking our order seemed nice enough until our food came out. I asked him for a side of ranch and he then proceeded to lecture me for the next 3 minutes on how I should have asked him for the side of ranch when I placed my order because now he was going to have to go to the back to personally get me my side of ranch! As a paying customer, I don't need a lecture from a waiter while I'm trying to eat my food. I'm sure he considered this part of his gimmicky personality for people who come from out of town and probably think he's funny. But for someone who visits vegas often enough, i just found it insulting. So 1 star for the shitty service, even though the food was good. The waiter completely ruined my experience.

The atmosphere is nice. When there's a band playing it's a great place to hangout. 

Food is mediocre at best. I've had just about the whole breakfast menu and I can't say anything is really good. Today I had the crab cakes eggs benedict and the crab cake was about the size of a silver dollar on top of a huge english muffin.

We had the fried chicken, pot roast, and a burger and all were delicious. But the horrendous live music absolutely killed the experience. Entirely too loud and at one point we had to listen to about a full minute of high pitch feedback at full volume. My ears are still ringing. And your band sounds like a bunch of guys jamming in their garage. It's a restaurant, not a practice space. Service was not good either. After the horrendous music debacle, not a word from the manager. In fact, the only thing I saw the manager do was to socialize with the hostess (who was really sweet and the only good part of the service). Our waiter was slow, disorganized, and generally unfriendly. 

Strongly suggest killing the live music. The room is just too small and it's unnecessary. Step up the service and provide an experience that does the food justice. Great food, but you guys are ruining it with the music/service.",yCJpjjQ2bhK39rJvCpW_Vw,5,1,3,zmqlgBA5Jwkrvp02K__jiw

480922,2017-05-13,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"I enjoyed the service when we came in just to grab dessert our first night we arrived to Vegas. We ordered and the men there still gave superior service even though we weren't spending much for them to have their percentage of tip. Most places seem annoyed that you aren't eating a meal so they treat you like dirt. Great ice cream. 

So the next day we decide to get dinner here. Their food was great. My boyfriend ordered their New York strip steak. Thinking the price wasn't bad and the cut of steak it was that it would be a basic taste. It came out huge and delicious. My boyfriend was very pleased. You would have though you were eating at a 5 star steakhouse. I had the pot roast and it was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the gravy was so good because it had just enough flavor and wasn't salty. 

I gave 4 stars only because of us eating there this morning for breakfast. The food was great. But the morning service was horrible. Had to ask for coffee a few times and she didn't bring my water out for a while after my boyfriend got his coffee. Between the coffee and water was her asking if he wanted sugar and he said yes so she went to get it and brought my water.....but no sugar. It's okay to be forgetful, but to have no smile while doing it is just rude to me. Then another woman took over somewhat and she had attitude. I tried to crack a smile, but I failed. I just feel like everyone should be like the servers the other two nights and it sucks that you can't get good service because it really ruins your mood when you are trying to enjoy your meal.

I got an offer for a free meal for 2 ($100 value) that I could not pass up. Went around 3:30 on Saturday. No live music was playing at the time so it was pretty quiet. They  do have a separate room for when it's playing you can go into closed off with doors & about 7 tables inside if you don't want to hear it. We chose to sit at the bar. Our service was wonderful from start to finish. 

Started off with the tater tots & oysters. Both were absolutely delicious! I got the IPA burger and my husband had the pastrami. The pastrami was great. I didn't like the burger at all. The fried pickles made it extremely salty even after picking them off and there was hardly any cheese sauce on it. What was there kinda soaked into the meat & I really couldn't taste it at all. Both meals came with hand cut French fries that were pretty good. Found myself eating those instead of the burger.

What I remember most was the hostess.  She seemed to be bound and determined to avoid the front desk as much as humanly possible.  This might have been OK during a slow period, but on a Sunday around lunch time you've got to be there to greet folks as they show up.  As we waited to be seated, three different couples arrived and asked us if there was a list or whether they should seat themselves.  We say that there was a hostess to take their names and that we assumed she'd return shortly.  When she didn't, they'd eventually drift away.

OK, sometimes people get busy, especially during the afternoon crush.  But after we sat down to eat we kept ourselves amused by watching her.  She'd walk around the restaurant without apparent purpose, pick up a single empty glass, walk all the way to the back, drop off the glass, then walk back towards the desk. If she encountered another employee, she'd stop and have a serious discussion about something, then she'd walk back towards the kitchen, spot a menu, pick up the menu, and then go file it.  Then and only then would she swing by the desk.  By that time a number of potential guests would have come and gone.  In fact, the moment we were done and were leaving the front, two different groups were standing there with perplexed looks and they asked us if we knew where the hostess was.  We could only laugh.

The fault lies not with the lady, but her manager.  It is up to him or her to make sure that the hostess knows what to do and that the restaurant isn't losing business because the hostess was tasked with jobs that someone else could have done more efficiently or because she hasn't been instructed how to distingush between periods when she absolutely had to be physically present at the front desk and periods where she can walk around the interior and help the wait staff if need be.

3 stars for food.  The home made tots are actually mashed potato bites and the homemade ranch is water.  We ordered the bloody Mary for the beef jerky and it came out with out it.  We let the server know and at the end of our meal, after we requested the check, he said oh yeah for got to tell you we don't do that anymore.  Why didn't you tell us that when we ordered it? And why did you come back jsut to say that and with no check?  Anyways, chicken fried chicken, gravy had no salt or flavor.  Ordered a side of sausage and it was too salty.  The brisket biscuit came out without the fried onions (fav thing) and biscuit was dry.

  Wasn't reinventing the wheel here.  Would have loved to try dessert but probably would have added another hour and I just didn't have the patience anymore.",WGuGgpPqZfkgKIgDeY339Q,3,0,2,si1_8XbSAL3_RZXmHYBXIw
1862153,2016-10-13,1,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"I ate at this place twice in one day. It was clean and the wait staff in the casino told me that they had just revamped the placed so I thought I would give it a go. 
First, breakfast was pretty good. The potatoes were really good. Still sizzling in their own little skillet. The eggs were under cooked but doable. But the service was a bit slow for a place that had little to nobody in it. I spoke to one of the managers regarding their place. He told me that they play soft live music at night so I thought I would come back and see what it does for the place.
I came back later in the evening for dinner. The place was still not filled up so I was a bit concerned that someone knew something I didn't. I was seated but nobody came to see if I wanted a drink for about 10 minutes. The menu was not bad, but you could tell they were trying to upscale the food menu. I ordered a pan seared steak and some of their wings as an appetizer. While I was waiting they had a guy playing a guitar softly and singing. He was pretty good, but unfortunately, he finished and HERE IT CAME. Up came a wanna-be band that started to set up. They decided this would be a great place to do their mic checks and instrument checks as loud as possible. I was trying to eat an expensive meal (in Vegas terms) and here is this guy hitting his drums as hard as he could to tune them??? The wings were good but the steak was way over cooked, dry and hard. I normally would have sent it back, but I had to get out of this place. I have never been driven out of a restaurant by music before, but the band was terrible. I work in the music industry and I wouldn't sign these guys to play in my garage. Even better, then groupies that followed the band pretty much took over the restaurant. They filled in booths and were loud and obnoxious. Word of advice people. When you have groupies or other bands waiting to go on, don't seat them in the restaurant where people are paying to eat. 
Overall, dinner was a nightmare and service for that dinner was even worse. They need to pay more attention to their patrons, and less to the music side of this place. Trust me, this may be the reason the restaurant is not packed.",InF01qA_xxT2AfO1tHKwUQ,6,1,2,U699SvVrZocJo0WnhejPrg

1956122,2018-03-23,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"Turned up on Sunday night after reading good things about this place. Thought it might be a seat yourself time as there were no staff around. waited a few minutes and eventually the manager came out. He sat us at a table and I mentioned that I thought it might have been a seat yourself job as nobody was there. He replied that he'd been there the whole time (Lie - we waited five minutes with no sign of anyone around). 
Not awesome but we decided to try it anyway.
short story. we ordered 4 meals. after 10 minutes they came out and said that one of them wasn't going to be ready for 20 minutes.
a few minutes later they said 10 minutes but the rest of our food was ready now and did we want to wait. (what- so the rest of the food goes cold? or sits under a heat lamp. What sort of kitchen can't get the food out at the same time.). We had them bring out the food that was ready.
2 burgers were just fine. a pastrami sandwich advertised on their site as ""house made pastrami, pickled onions, brown mustard & seeded rye"" was a couple of slices of very dry pastrami on rye. no mustard, onion or anything else. the bread was dryer than the pastrami.
We cancelled the 4th meal and I told the manager how bad the sandwich was. whilst he did take it off the bill he showed no interest or concern at all. 
If you set high standards for your place you need to be invested in maintaining them. Of course they could be shortstaffed but thats not my problem. If you can't serve the food you are supposed to then don't serve it. The manager is responsible for the food that comes out of the kitchen and it was crap.
To round out the evening I paid cash for the meal and after a nice long wait the server came back with my change. Only the bills though - the coins weren't there. That, my yelp friends, is theft.

You think I'll be back? Or even recommend it?

yeah - be a cold day in hell.

1962892,2018-05-07,9,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"The $20 AYCE small plate brunch sounded like a pretty sweet deal, so I rounded up some friends for a Cinco de Mayo recovery brunch. We tried most of the dishes while listening to live music and a good time was had. Some dishes were better than others, but it's one of the better deals to be had downtown with a variety of fresh-made dishes to suit a group without resorting to a buffet. Drinkers can add on a bottomless option for $10 more.

The GOOD: Monkey Bread we were served upon seating was syrupy and sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Shrimp & Grits was surprisingly creamy and cheesy. Both the Crab Cake and Classic Benedicts were pretty good, with perfectly cooked, yolky eggs. Silver-Dollar Pancakes were better than expected, topped with a brown sugar topping. Eggs & potatoes were a surprise hit, with well-seasoned potatoes with a heavy hand of rosemary and a bit of chorizo mixed in for kick. 

The rest: Texas French Toast was not received despite multiple requests. Chicken & Waffles had a dry protein. Biscuit & Gravy was flavorless in both components with an unpleasant, soggy texture. Jambalaya was bland and the chilaquiles were phoned in with a handful of stale chips and a scoop of salsa. Pastrami Skillet Hash was poorly received by others, so I didn't try it. Fish & Chips was overly breaded and not crispy. ""Pigs"" in a blanket was comically served with one tiny wrapped sausage dwarfed by the mini-skillet it was served in, and overly sweet with a maple sausage wrapped in a pancake and then further drizzled with maple syrup. 

 Our server was nice and fairly attentive. There were no issues splitting the bill (always a risk with group dining) and server was okay with one in our party ordering from the a la carte menu. It wasn't til I actually wrote out this review that I realized how many more misses than hits there were regarding the food- having the right company clearly makes a difference with your experience.

2128030,2017-07-03,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"Been here a few times now. Meh. 

Its kinda hard for me to like honestly. I normally sit at the bar and was waiting till I had table service to review. The prices are ok ,not impressed with the menu or service. Menu is diffrent then most things in area. Much appricated but it doesnt flow. The idea of rock soup is a turn off. Chefs offering with no chalk board description , or staff description seems like we are being sold scraps. 

Few immediate turn offs. You killed some guitars and put them on the wall. Every musician ive brought here is disturbed by it. Its like looking at headless animals  for music folk.  ( its a thing seriously ) The water glasses, coffee cups and  everything else on your table set ups are not inviting. It honestly took me a min to realize that these where not dirty tables or unpolished glasses. This is how they are set up. Too much crap on the table. Makes me question how many people  have touched it and how clean it is. 

The food so far has been hit and miss. Crab cakes where great. Loaded fries we prob would not have gotten. Not sure if we read the menu wrong or it just said smoked meats. When I asked the bartender what comes on the fries he had to go back and ask the chef. I couldnt check my menu even though we where at the bar for happy hour specials , bartender took my menu. Loaded fries come with pork. Meat was ok sweet I personally am just not a fan of pulled pork. Sauce on fries was great. Fries where huge but lacking. For being loaded it seems like they just tossed well done fries in cheese threw chives and pork on top. Loaded to me implies a lot of topping like nachos or a potato. Other visits we have had the hash bites, wings, steak and fried pickels.  Hash bites where good, ranch taste like its made in house or higher quality then most. B.c. though with the wings tasted old so did the crumbles. Wing sauce was great ,crispy and good for sharing. Can not comment of fried pickels as you where out of them. The steak my friend had I would have sent back. Plate and eggs looked fine, ordered  med rare came out no pink no blood and grey well done. He was drunk so he just ate it. 

The service is just meh. I do not expect fine dining by any means. Its lacking though at freedombeat. I noticed when I come in the bar during happy hour if your a single top the bartender does not advertise happy hour. Its not on the menus either. The fact that you have to ask about it is cheap. Every couple or party that came in a group was offered happy hour. Maybe just that bartenders startegy. Did not find the beer selection to be that great. No cider , did not see great IPA selection. The selection seems picked by the  beer rep. Bartender was also unable to explain goose island beer to patron next to me. Bartender never checked on me after I got my food. He in fact left, closed his drawer and didnt switch me over. After hearing employees  complain about union crap for 30 mins during shift change. I was over needing a box and just paid & left my food. Now to our table service. For some reason our waitresses seemed super nervous and unsure. No big deal it eventually made us uncomfortable  though. She could not seem to understand we are trying to try all your happy hour stuff. Asked her several times to put everything in at once. We finally had to just pick one to be served first because she did not get we want apps as an entree. Super timid interuptive water refills, did not describe hash bites right at all. Was not aware of your 86'd items. Then the cake topper for me with her was when she gave me a Female the check. If im unsure or to be neutral I set it in the middle and say thank you no rush. He had to ask her for then check then she gives to me. ????????? No eye conatct like afraid to just talk to us. She was nice and kept making rounds. Her lack of comfort in her job did not add anything to the experiance. If her co workers are going to complain and ignore me for need to discuss their lack of compensation. Sorry for what service I was provided they are over paid. Id expect her to kinda have to basics down. She was super nervous , and unknowlable. It made us feel awkward. It really was bad , it was my friend I was with. I cant imagine if it had been a date.

Friendly  suggestions,  cider or fruit beer, having more live music. We tried to play trivia  ( love this idea ) cards where all the same though and we couldnt talk to each other over freedom beats speaker competing with casino floor music. Food ok , service needs improvement. Nice reasonably  priced menu. Hotel is nice , pool is wonderful.

I suggest coming here at night when the bartenders and cooks in the back are quick and attentive. I love this place but the top part of the afternoon staff is lackadaisical.

Night time during dinner the music is WAYYYY TOOOO LOUD.  They need to learn proper etiquette about live music in a restaurant.  Before 9pm the music should be tapered so that guests can enjoy conversation during their meal. After 9pm music can be turned up a bit to entice customers to stop in for the club atmosphere.

The food presentation was so much better than how it tasted.  We ordered:

Chicken fried bacon-we got the concept but the batter tasted overly fried and the bacon was super thin

Flame he illed oysters - very salty and the oysters just weren't tasty (in all fairness our server did let us know the oysters were not in season)

Burgers - these were probably the best items ordered; cooked to our liking and juicy

Thigh high fried chicken our way - pretty good

Let me begin with the fact that I've stayed at this hotel many many times and eaten here many times. After my experience with working in bars and restaurants for over a decade, I have come to the conclusion that not only this restaurant but also hotel are not run well. 

Let's begin with the fact that this restaurant is very unorganized. I sat down Sunday night at the bar to get food before I went out. The bartender ignored me for a few minutes and finally came over and took my food order. Maybe 2 minutes later he clocked out and a new bartender started their shift. The first bartender didn't communicate with the second bartender at all, nor did he mention to me he was leaving. More people sit down and order food from bartender 2. Bartender 2 was so slammed and overwhelmed he couldn't do all the orders, gourmet cocktails and the waitress's drink orders. The couple next to me at the bar had no drinks even after they got their food order. I finally said something to the manager who was playing with the computer but not helping bartender 2 at all. The manager got the couple their drinks and walked in the back. The chef came out and apologized to the person next to us because they had taken their order to someone else and they never got their food. 

I returned Monday evening not because I was impressed with the service but because I wanted a dessert and I am still staying at the hotel. I sat down, reviewed the menu and ordered what I wanted. The bartender put my order in the computer, I paid, tipped and then she came back several minutes later saying they had been out of the dessert I ordered for 2 weeks. The kitchen never told her what they were out of. Again, unorganized. I am on a limited dietary restrictions so I told her I wanted to cancel my order and get a refund since I couldn't eat the other items. She said okay. She didn't know how to cancel my item in the computer and give me my receipt to prove a refund. This is where I am now very frustrated with this place and borderline mad. The same manager from the previous night comes out of the kitchen and cancels my order in the computer. He said it could be 4 days before I get my money back. 

Let me say that this place is in ""Old Vegas"" but this is a newly renovated hotel. I feel safe here traveling by myself. The hotel is clean and has lots of security. I just don't understand why this restaurant is like this!!!",ABOlagI4iG9k8_mZ-VC0ig,3,0,2,jFQy1eBhQItXHqAuV8ZF8Q

We waited about 35 mins to be seated, which was ok being that they were busy, however, it took about 15 minutes until a waitress stopped by to take our bottomless orders (which was encouraged by effort to flag down an employee). Once we placed our orders, it didn't get better. We all got the bottomless mimosas, but we didn't get refills in a timely manner - about 10-15 minutes in between empty glasses to get a refill. Staff was not attentive at all. During our meal, the place started thining out, so it was not busy. Not a place to go for bottomless mimosas, as you'll only get a few glasses served to you in a few hours. 

The food was ok. Not as good as anticipated. Red velvet waffles were cold and stale tasting, as if it was made in bulk and sitting out until someone ordered it. Chicken biscuit wasn't good, dry and not tasty (in addition to not knowing what type of chicken it was?). Pastrami hash was ok. Sliders and fries were good. 

Overall, not good. AM not going back. Too bad; had higher expectations.",O7SYjeHcnKQcGlpKuM8I1Q,0,0,2,qlE27ihpj78NrBtYReNrGA

They had a good selection of happy hour craft beer on tap and I tried the $8.95 prime rib special! A+ on the prime rib super tasty was tender and a large cut def good quality for the price. The veggies were also amazing little bit of blackened but juicy-crunchy at the same time perfect if you ask me then the mash potatoes to finally nail it down. The whole deal here for the prime rib and beer came out to less then $20 you can't beat it! Customer service was super friendly and the location has plenty of seating available and bar top which I sat down at.

My phone was on that lingering life clinching 1% with just enough juice to get the Yelp check-in LOL. I might not have any pictures to show but I can definitely describe the meal. Time to use your imaginations. 

I ordered the prime rib that comes with a nice thick cut, garlic mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, and au jus. I had it prepared medium rare and it melts in the mouth. The outer rims of the prime rib were well seasoned and its seasoning could be tasted within center portions of the cut. It tasted so good I almost forgot about the au jus for dipping.

I also tried some of my friends chicken & waffles and it was enjoyable as well. I liked the small kick the spicy ale maple sauce gave and it's mixture with the melted maple butter.

Only in Vegas can you find a hefty prime rib like this close to 3am under $20. I also loved the gastropub feel of the place.

Not sure whether to call this dinner or breakfast given the time we visited so I'll let you decide. You better believe I'll be back for more late night eats.

I ordered the American beat breakfast (two eggs any way, bacon or sausage and their ""famous"" potatoes).
Eggs were ok. Kinda hard to mess up eggs. Bacon was VERY greasy and soggy. I like mine crispy. Sausage was also VERY oily with an odd taste to it. 
Not sure why their potatoes are ""famous"" because the flavor of them tasted as though they scraped the very bottom of a burnt pan. 
The worst part of the meal, though, was the fact that nothing was hot...just lukewarm at best when it came out of the kitchen.

Two of us went for Sunday brunch at noon, decided on the all-you-can eat small plates menu. The all-you-can-drink Bloody Mary's are $10. The trick is they bring you a Mason jar with ice & vodka, then you have to go to the bar to make your own Bloody Mary. Seriously. They have a bartender but you have to make your own drink. They brought a small, cold cast iron skillet with monkey bread which was hard on the top & a small plate with a few pieces of sliced melon and a couple of blueberries. The monkey bread was cold & obviously not freshly baked but warmed up by dousing it with sauce.  Finally, the waiter came back and sat down in the booth next to me. Don't do that. It's rude. I will tip you well for good service but I didn't invite you to join us at our table. After taking our order for two small plate items each he disappeared for 20 minutes. We finally flagged down someone else to refill our waters. After another 10 minutes he came by & we asked him to check on our food. Didn't see him for another 10 minutes until he came to our table & asked if we were ready to order more food. We still didn't have the first food we ordered. He disappeared off the floor & we never saw him again. We finally went to find the manager who was practically non-responsive. We asked for the bill for our drinks and cold monkey bread & he said no, we could just go.... so we did. So did the two people at the table across from us who were getting the same level of service. The only good thing I can say is the single on guitar was pretty good the but the mix was terrible. Too loud to have a conversation & his vocals were buried behind the acoustic guitar.

We have dined here with a friend from Rhode Island.  We were watching TV on the Travel channel and we saw Freedom Beat!  Well it was my friend's birthday that night and she saw that on TV and was bummed she's never been.

Sara our server was taking care of another couple when a young man asked what we would like to drink.  Later she came over to let us know she'd be our server since the other gentlemen was off the clock.  I must war. You if you have a small stomach, these appetizers here are large!  Even my boyfriend was not able to finish his loaded pork fries.  I had the same exact thing because it's my favorite cheat day item.

However, I have a friend who is a local and she has been here dozens of times. She always enjoys it and usually brings out of town guests here. Well I was visiting with two other girlfriends (4 of us total) and we decided to give this place a try for brunch... and I am so glad we did!

We came on a Saturday late morning, without reservations. While we did have to wait, it was not very long and we were promptly seated at one of the booths. Each of us debated the $20 all you can eat option vs getting one of the brunch entrees. We all decided to just order from the regular menu but then added on the $10 all you can drink mimosa option. We started with an order of monkey bread for the table (it is the same one you get with the all you can eat option, just bigger. it isn't listed on the menu, but I asked for it and they obliged). This was delicious! I kept going back for more, but knew my meal was coming. I ended up getting the avocado toast with a poached egg. It comes with a little salad on the side and some tomatoes. And it was so good - it really exceeded my expectations. And even thought it was avocado toast, it was so filling with the poached egg and tomatoes. I was very pleased with my dish. 2 of the girls got the breakfast sandwich, and another friend got a chicken sandwich I think? Everyone was happy with their meals and totally stuffed at the end. There was a bit of a mistake with one of the orders. There was bacon missing from one of the breakfast sandwiches, but our server quickly got bacon to add into her sandwich so it was not a problem at all. 

Overall the service was very good. Our server (I wish I remember her name - b/c she was great!) was quite attentive. She checked on us frequently for water and mimosa refills and I never felt like I was looking to track her down. The live music is such a great part of the experience and the guy singing that day was damn good!

PLACE AN OPENTABLE RESERVATION. We made the reservation for 12:15 and arrived at 12. When we got there the wait time for anyone who came up to the front had to wait over an hour without a reservation already placed. Since we had a reservation at 12:15, we had to wait only 15 minutes, we played slots in the meantime. 

Downfall, we went up to the person at the front and said we are here now after already getting there at 12 and she did not really do to much to get us a table. After another 5 minutes, we went back up and somehow managed to get a table. Our table was located right by the stage and in a booth, so it was very comfortable.

We came for the unlimited $10 mimosas and a meal (not the $20 all you can eat meal.) My group first ordered mimosas before ordering our started and later main dish. When we got our mimosas, they were extremely warm and did not taste well at all. This happened for about 3 refills or better each with a change of glasses. Each time we were unpleased with the mimosas. Later in our stay, the mimosas were cold again and all was good. 

For food, we ordered a starter, the fried pickle dish, and those were really good. 3 of the 4 people in my group (that's including me) ordered the breakfast sandwich. Upon arrival, we waited about 15 minutes for the food, which isn't abnormal. We received it, and were instantly unpleased. The sandwich was on a biscuit and right when I took it out of the wrapping, the bottom crumbled all over the place. I was so hungry, that that didn't matter and I continued to eat it along with the potatoes it came with. The potatoes were really cold and greasy as heck. I took 3 bites and stopped. For my breakfast sandwich, I barely got through half of it. It was so salty and greasy as well that it was unpleasing to eat. None of us finished. Our other friend ordered a scrambled egg and also came with the potatoes. She didn't touch her food as well because it was gross. 

We kindly talked to our waiter about it and he quickly got the manager for us. We explained our situation to him and he was completely kind about our poor experience. We did explain the mimosas being warm to him and he was completely shocked because they had used warm champagne for that batch of drinks handed out. He ended up comping our entire meal and drinks, which we were really happy with! 

Our waiter and the manager were very nice, so our experience wasn't ruined from their awesome customer service but just the food itself. I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon, but if I do, I will definitely order something safe.",FPZC-EcO6iconLVvnR1wPg,2,0,2,AJX6EYr_3DDTLAF0S3CVVw

Saw positive reviews on Yelp! so I figured why not?We are in the area. 

Let's start with the host stand. Exactly that....there isn't one. So finding the host was confusing when there wasn't one standing there. An iPad on a shelf isn't a ""host STAND.""

When the host arrived she was very sweet. Nicest one out of all the staff there. She had braces and worked Tuesday night.

We were sat at an unwiped table. It's not the hosts fault that the busser/server didn't wipe down the table well enough. Starting the meal that way was a tad discouraging. My server came by and just filled waters and said, ""I'll be back."" He arrived more then 8 minutes later asking, ""You Ready?""

^Is that for real? No introducing yourself, no telling us about the food, no recommendations, no upselling?  My server Viado seemed very flustered. I noticed all he had was an 8 top and two 2 tops. If he can't give good service and multitask more then cut his section because his service was one of the worst I had here in vegas as a local. 

I started with the fried pickles. Viado (whose name I got from the check not by introducing himself) had my dinner come out while I only took about 6 bites of my app. I was kinda pissed because I felt rushed. So my fried pickles sat there most of the meal and got cold.

I had no choice but to start my entree before it got cold too. I had the chicken sandwich. It was really juicy delicious chicken on a some what dry biscuit. Some cheese and coleslaw on it too. It didn't taste good together but when you ate everything by itself it was delicious. Chicken was my favorite part of the meal.

During my meal I had my water glass on the edge of the table for a long time. I was sipping on melted ice for so long. I finally had to stare at our waiter for him to sprint over to the water pitcher. My partner and I are restaurant managers and we notice a lot while out to eat. Our server was so busy talking with other servers and the bartender that he forgot us. We caught the manager breaking them up talking by the bar.

After that the manager came over to check on us. She could have introduced herself and made it more personable. Instead all I got was a ""how is everything"" and a walk away. But hey it's better than no manager table touch. 

When we were wrapping up our meal, the server came by to ask if we were finished and didn't give us enough time to tell him that we wanted to box up our pickles that we never got a chance to eat before he scooped them up and bussed our table. 

I got dessert to go (fried Twinkie) because I couldn't think about being there longer and it's a shame because this place has potential but it's discouraging when you have a dead restaurant with horrible service. Usually you can blame it being really busy but I can't even do that.

Viado must have just gotten cut because he didn't wait even until we had our jackets on to come grab our signed check from our table.

I did however really dig the live music Tuesday night. Not too loud of music and really modern songs with a country flair. Defiantly keep the live music up!",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,9,4,3,PRUNrG2zY-tZduOkMQP6ww

We went in for breakfast - starving after day 3 of Anniversary Trip to Las Vegas we ordered a couple things to share. We ordered the Avocado Toast and added shrimp for $5.00. The presentation was OK but I was very disappointed in the execution. It was NOT Avocado TOAST - rather sliced baguette bread not toasted with processed avocado -  I'm sure out of a bag.  Topped with flavorless tomatoes and bland greens and even unseasoned shrimp. I was so disappointed - didn't finish obviously. 
The 2nd dish was an omelet with toast and bacon - The bacon was perfectly cooked and fantastic, toast was really good sourdough bread! Omelet was tasty but was really small - the 2 slices of bacon was larger than the omelet. Last but certainly not least I decided to order the Tot's - thank goodness I did! They were amazing - not really a TOT but more a deep fried mashed potato but non the less the flavor was amazing and saved our meal.

4108224,2018-05-06,4,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"The current Yelp rating here is 3.5. Sounds about right to me.

Freedom Beat is an American restaurant inside Downtown Grand. Our group of eight came here on a Sunday morning to try their brunch. This is an all you can eat brunch for $20 per person, and they bring out orders to your table so it's not a ""buffet.""

The wait was about 15-20 minutes to get seated. I wish that they'd had more consistently tolerable lighting, but our high tops were dimly light, whereas the rest of the place was brighter. It was hard to hold a conversation while resident musician Mahi Crabbe (yes, that's his stage name) was strumming and singing, but at least the music was surprisingly enjoyable.

The food, however, wasn't so good all-around. I'll list the dishes in order of the menu and describe them.

- Monkey Bread: served at the start with all AYCE brunches. Soft bread and good cinnamon and syrup flavor.
- Fruit Plate: didn't really have much of this, but also came with all AYCE brunches.
- Texas French Toast: we skipped this
- Silver Dollar Pancakes: unevenly buttered/syruped. Good when you did get those toppings, boring and merely OK when you didn't. I wouldn't get it again.
- Shrimp & Grits: surprise favorite. Deliciously sauced shrimp and flavorful, soft grits.
- Chicken & Waffles: pretty good overall, but I've had better chicken and better waffles.
- Biscuits & Gravy: half a biscuit? What gives? And it was smothered in gravy to the point where I couldn't say whether the texture had been damaged, but it wasn't great. The gravy wasn't outright bad but it wasn't as rich as you'd hope.
- Eggs & Potatoes: decent scrambled eggs, but the potatoes here and everywhere else didn't have enough salt. They were soft enough but I wished that they'd cut the potatoes into smaller pieces for more browning.
- Classic Benedict: perhaps my second favorite. Decent muffin, nice poaching of eggs, and good ham.
- Crab Cake Benedict: generic, overly salty crab cake.
- Pastrami Skillet Hash: no pastrami. Otherwise, it's a fried egg version of the Eggs & Potatoes, meaning that it was underseasoned.
- Jambalaya: didn't try this on our side of the table.
- Pot Roast Sliders: pretty good beef, but the fries were limp and underseasoned.
- Crispy Chicken Biscuit: didn't try after the poor chicken and biscuit experiences in other dishes.
- Chilaquiles: I've probably had better in a buffet. Scrambled eggs were Ok, but simply throwing those on top of tortilla chips and adding a medium spicy sauce screams lazy and uninspired. 
- Fish & Chips: mushy, not flaky fish, not very crispy batter, and the same lackluster fries as above.
- Pigs in a Blanket: okay. Maybe even better than half of the dishes.

I don't see myself coming back to Freedom Beat any time soon. I'd rather have marginally inferior food at local casino breakfast buffets or significantly superior breakfast entrees at any number of restaurants than work my way downtown (even though they do validate for the Downtown Grand parking garage across the street) for maybe 3 or 4 worthwhile dishes.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,3,3ilVQcowkzeyNsHs2RfVig

Ok so the food is solid. Well prepared and really tasty. We've been twice, in two days. 

I'm saddened by how lack luster the service is and just the execution of the service in general. It really makes the experience maddening and non consolidation of the moves by the severs - turns a 30 minute meal into an hour of mostly waiting for everything. 12 minutes for a Bloody Mary that I watched sitting in the service well for at least 5 minutes. 28 minutes from the time we ordered the food to the delivery. I considered that we ordered food that took time to make.. but a cup of yogurt takes 20+ minutes? Literally a soup cup btw - $8. 

Had to ask for a new water glass because mine was filthy, had to ask for new silver because it was covered In what appeared to be residue from the hard water - polish the silver please! 

The restaurant is a mess already man. Music is annoyingly loud - the cloth booths were stained with food already - it's just so many things that a new restaurant should not be. 

I stress that the food has been really good. I'm not just trying to break it down harshly. But... 

The service was terrible on both visits - the first day the server kept putting ice tea in my water. A salad took 15 minutes to deliver and then another 20 for main course. 

I know y'all are new - I get it - but tighten up please. I work, and play downtown and want to support this place because I truly liked the food. 

On another note - the hostesses were very sweet. Nice to talk to but we waited more than 10 minutes to get a seat, because even as the restaurant was half empty -  there were visibly 5 tables dirty. We were set up for ours then the other 4 stayed dirty for half of our meal. 

The managers need to get more involved. If tables need to be serviced, and drinks need to be run - please do that. Touch tables and talk to the guests. This place could be somewhere I'd eat regularly - because again, it's delicious. Service ? What service- provide service please - it's not rocket science.

Go for the food - sit at the bar ? 

Anyway - Happy Eating !",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,5,1,3,N3uMNHiyVOjYqqhb6cICEQ

The restaurant has plenty of red, white, and blue with live music. In between the live music the restaurant played music so it was always lively. At times the music was a bit loud for conversation, but that's to be expected. For the most part the music added to the ambiance of vibe of brunch.

The all you can eat brunch offered a nice variety of foods, all served as small plates. The small plates were perfect for being able to try several items. The brunch starts with fruit and monkey bread for the table to share. Small plates offered include items like benedicts, biscuits & gravy, pancakes, fish & chips, French toast, and jambalaya. 

Our waitress was great. Since we were in a group she offered to bring a variety of items for us to share. To avoid overloading the table she brought half of the menu at a time. There was plenty of everything for us to try. She was consistently at our table refilling drinks, taking away dirty plates, and seeing if we needed anything. We were constantly supplied extra plates and silverware since we were sharing everything. At the end of the meal getting separate checks wasn't an issue at all.

Overall, the food was good for a $20 all you can eat brunch. I wouldn't say any of the items were the best I've ever had. My favorite dishes were the chicken & waffles, classic benedict, jambalaya, and monkey bread. The monkey bread was a nice texture and had plenty of delicious caramel. I liked the taste of the waffle and the chicken for the chicken and waffles. A little more syrup would have made it even better. The benedict had a nice tasting hollandaise and the eggs were perfectly prepared. A couple of dishes that could have been better were the fish & chips and pastrami skillet hash. The fish in the fish and chips was on the soggy side, but the seasoning on the fries was good. The pastrami hash was oddly lacking much pastrami.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,1,3,aB5Dn6wByNY9pePci22zog

Off on the edge of Downtown near the Container Park and Pizza Rock, tucked in the surprisingly cool Downtown Grand hotel is this gem.

I made an easy reservation through Yelp just in case it was busy and this way no crowd would keep me from my meal.

The $20 turkey special was terrific - see my crappy photo! Two big slices of tender breast meat along with other tasty scraps. The less pretty random pieces of the bird showed that the turkey had been rubbed in a spice blend and had this a great crust from being in the oven. Also on the plate?  A big slice of freshly cooked sweet potato, sauteed green beans,  buttery mashed potatoes, fresh stuffing with (passable, but also unneeded) gravy and a bright gingery cranberry compote on the side. The food was fresh and scratchmade. AND it came with a delicious individual pumpkin pie - which they packed nearly for me to go!

The rest of the menu looked terrific too. This place is so much more than it seems. Even with all of the hundreds of options around here, I can't wait to go back again.

In classic Vegas fashion, Freedom Beat offers huge portions and great options to get drunk while eating more than you should. A friend had a free voucher for a stay at the Downtown Grand so as soon as we saw the ads for the mimosas, we knew where we'd be spending our morning. 

BEAT BREAKFAST: 
Honestly, it's a shockingly decent price for the amount of food that comes with this order! You get eggs anyway you want them, a giant biscuit with cinnamon butter, breakfast potatoes, and a choice of meat. I chose sausage! I thought everything was delicious and simple. The potatoes were really flavorful and hearty. 

The service was impeccable. As soon as they saw that our mimosa glasses were almost empty, they had new ones prepared to replace them.

Cooked nicely with a good crispy sourdough bread.  Opted for the baked beans instead of the fries.  The beans were a disappointment, nothing to remember.  

The beer selection is good, not extraordinary, but sufficient.  The service was very good, except for one time.  As a former bartender and restaurant owner, I have high expectations when I dine out.  I had finished my first beer and had barely touched my food so I wanted to order another beer.  I sat there for a little while, a shorter period than I probably thought so while sitting there.

Alyssa, my bartender, had become busy doing other tasks.  When the other bartender on duty asked me if I wanted a glass of water, I was not a friendly patron.  Alyssa said she was sorry for what happened and immediately calmed me down.  Instead of becoming a ""customer from hell"", I became a regular.  She handled a potentially bad situation very well, a job very well done!

Unfortunately, it pains me to tell you that not only my friend and I, but also most of the people around us were not remotely happy with anything that was happening. Here are a few a things I would like to bring to your attention as management because I do believe the concept is good and the place has a lot of potential.
- Servers need to be assigned to specific sections to facilitate speedy service.
- When serving ""bottomless"" mimosas use pitchers to proceed quicker service to the tables.
- The ""all you can eat"" needs to change format. As much I as I appreciate the presentation, it doesn't look like it's really working when people are ordering at the rate they were today. Maybe a buffet style to avoid long wait times.

In addition, I would like to let you know that I was deeply disappointed as a local that when others complained they were given better service. However, my friend and I decided to not complain in hopes that the services would get better as you became less busy. This simply did not happen and those around us that did complain received the service we were hoping to get.

Again, as locals, we would like to come back and enjoy the place as we do believe the concept has potential and the food was good. We already love spending time on property.

When we got in there, I got an immediate headache. The band is so loud and the place is so small so it was even louder. 
Our server was literally a ghost. She came around to give us our drinks, and then our food, and that was it. It wasn't even busy while we were there so there was no reason for her to not have appeared more often. We ended up having to get refills from other people because she couldn't do her job right.
The food was absolutely gross. One of the things I ordered was the macaroni and cheese. It never said in the list of ingredients that they had that there was going to be onions, but that's what I got, I feel like there were more onions in the bowl than macaroni and cheese. I also got the fried chicken sandwich and it was completely disgusting because they use dark meat. It made me want to puke. 
The table was so small that we could barely fit in there. Plates were clanging everywhere because there was not enough room.
The manager that ended up being on duty was so condescending. Every time you would ask her a question, she'd make it seem like it was your fault that HER servers weren't doing their job and that she had to actually do something.
Ugh, it was just such a terrible experience, I'd give it 1 star if I could.

0 Stars for service 10 stars for the food!

We get there for breakfast and it's not that busy. they do have a rugby team there with two table of about 12-15 people but they are already eating.

We start off with a coffee and orange juice. My wifes orange juice is half the size of other orange juices that we saw on the tables. it would of been nice if they asked her if she wanted a small or large orange juice.
Upsell! Management likes that! But nothing was said so she got a small OJ :(

I asked about one of the dishes and the waitress replied (I don't know what you want me to say?) I was asking about the Pastrami Hash and how it was prepared.

My wife had the New Mexico Hatch Chili Chilaquiles and I went with the Pastrami hash. Both dishes were absolutely amazing! The biscuit with the maple syrup butter was to die for. The pastrami was diced and was cooked just right. The eggs and potatoes were great too. The chiliqulies had a great flavor to them and were not soft.

Again the food was great and had a New England style to it. I was told the head chef is from Boston. This is why I wanted to try it.

We asked our waitress 3 times for the check. We waited close to 30 mins for it. I was ready to go to the computer and look for my tab to check out myself. 

She finally gave us the check and we paid and left. Probably the worst service I have ever had. This is one of my worst Yelp reviews to date.
Note to Management - Please fix the service, the food was so good why keep waitresses that seem unhappy with their jobs?

5266023,2016-12-15,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"I was definitely excited to try this place based off of some of the reviews that I read.  The menu looked really good, too.  I think we just showed up on an off night last night...

The hostess was very pleasant and helpful.  Too bad we couldn't tell where the host stand was, or really the entrance to the restaurant.  We nearly tried entering from the side of the place.  She sat us at a set table, which looked good from a distance.  My partner noticed that the table hadn't been wiped down before it was sat.  There was sticky substances all over the table.  

Our server popped in at one point to fill our water glasses, and told us he'd be back to take our order.  He didn't introduce himself once.  He did return, nearly ten minutes later, and simply asked, ""Are you ready to order?"", or something equally standoffish.  We were baffled because it was a very quiet night in the restaurant.  We made the mistake of telling him our entire order at once.

Our fried pickles hit the table a few minutes later.  I was a fan of the light, crispy batter, and the pickles were tasty in themselves.  Too bad we could only enjoy a few bites before our entrees showed up shortly thereafter.  The pickles sat there, practically untouched for the remainder of the meal.  We decided to have them boxed and take them home to enjoy later.

My pot roast sandwich was quite good.  The roast, both tender and flavorful, paired well with the toast it was served on.  I only wish the cheese had been given enough time to fully melt.  The cheese was cold in some spots, and warm and gooey in others. I'm not a fan of the cut of fries that they serve, so it wouldn't be fair for me to critique them.  I'm sure many people enjoy their fries.  

By the way, our server never refilled my partner's water until he was finished with his sandwich. He asked how our food was at the end of the meal.  For the majority of the experience, he was standing by the bar talking to another server and the bartender the whole time - up until the manager came out from the back and made them all get back to work.  She then dropped by the table quickly, asked how everything was tasting, and then walked off.  She didn't introduce herself, either, although it was obvious that she was in charge.  It was a quick, awkward interaction, and neither of us felt like we could voice our opinion.  Yay for yelp!

We finished our entrees, and the server came by and pre-bussed our table, taking the pickles before we had a chance to tell him that we wanted to take it to go.  He did ask if we wanted dessert, so we ordered the fried twinkies to go.  He dropped the check with the dessert, allowed us to pay, and then came by and scooped up the check presenter before we even had our jackets on.  I am a restaurant manager, and was a server for many years.  I never rushed a payment like that, regardless if I had been cut or not.  I was able to get his name from the check - Viado.

I did enjoy that they did have a live performer on a Tuesday night, and the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing.  I could tell that they had good food, even if it was an off night for the kitchen.  I would think about going back for a second chance, as long as we get a different server, and show up on a busier night where the staff might not be so lazy.",yPFB_NuRX4W_nAkxnTKxhQ,3,0,2,RjgDIoSj686grV4Ps8mCKA
5279804,2017-11-30,1,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"Now open for about fourteen months at the Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino, a format change from Stewart & Ogden to S&O to Freedom Beat seeing the 24/7 spot decked out in Red, White and Blue plus a stage frequently featuring live music, there were several factors prompting a visit on the final Sunday of November, not the least of which being a ""Freedom 2 Gobble Leftover Menu"" offered during the three days following Thanksgiving.

Overseen by Scott Commings and finally beginning to gain traction thanks to the diversity of is menu plus monthly ""Theme"" Dinners including Chef Commings' take on the Food of New Orleans and other culinary destinations, it was just minutes till Noon that three diners checked in at the hostess stand prior to being seated at a sizable booth with soft leather seats directly in front of a man playing the Blues with NFL Football playing in the background.  

Switching over from the 24/7 Menu to an all-you-can-eat Small Plates Brunch in August, the weekend-only $20 option with $10 all-you-can-drink Bloody Marys or Bottomless Mimosas featuring over a dozen items including complimentary Monkey Bread and Fruit, it was after requesting one of the Televisions be switched to Bills vs. Chiefs that the first piping hot Skillet arrived along with Coffee, Scott's Monkey Bread bubbled up high and loaded with Walnuts plus thick and gooey Caramel topping.

Adding on some a la carte items throughout the course of a two hour visit, an $8 order of Avocado Toast perhaps Sin City's best price for the now-ubiquitous Brunch staple, it was with all four slices plus a fresh Salad being enjoyed by adults that the 10 year old was treated to a four Silver Dollar Pancakes topped with Pure Maple Syrup brought from home, his willingness to share much appreciated as the Stack was fluffy and delicious with a larger version also available for those who lament the loss of DuPar's downtown.

Next ordering a round of Eggs, two Bennies plus some convincingly spicy housemade Pastrami Hash featuring runny Yolks all around, it was only the slightly cool temperature of shredded Beef that held this round back from being as good as the rest as Freedom Beat's Hollandaise is far better than anything from a bag or box with medium-thickness and mild of Citrus.

Presumably not making Toast, Buns or English Muffins in-house, but undoubtedly doing so for Liege Waffles soon-to-debut beneath boneless fried Chicken topped in Crystal-spiked Honey, suffice it to say that as good as Waffle Love was at Last Friday Just Add Water Street two days prior the Waffles at Freedom Beat were even better with a light crunch and supple body while the brand new Jambalaya joining the Freedom 2 Brunch Menu is also very good with Dirty Rice resting amidst plump Shrimp and spicy Andouille Sausage.

Rounding out the AYCE savories with three Sliders topped in IPA-caramelized Onions and Frickles, the Meat much improved from a Burger ordered at Freedom Beat one year prior, it was here that four items from Sin City's only ""Leftover"" Menu arrived, the Pot Pie a relatively standard affair beneath buttery Pastry in cast iron while the Sandwich with Stuffing and Pumpkin Pie were also everything one might want from such, though the Smoked Turkey Leg raised the bar several notches with intense smokiness in a heaping portion for just $12 alongside Pan Gravy and creamy whipped Potaotes.
 
Not quite ready to throw in the towel without a few more sweets, Coffee freely flowing throughout the morning and never empty for more than a moment, it was with three French Toast Sticks and an equal number of Red Velvet Waffle segments that the meal came to a close, the former achieving a nearly Bread Pudding texture with similar accoutrements to the Monkey Bread while the latter was soft and fluffy with light Cocoa notes playing off the tangy Cream Cheese Icing.  

**** Largely the same concept as one year prior, though the Freedom 2 Brunch Menu, $10 Bottomless Adult Beverages and even more live music have certainly added to the spot's early-hours appeal, Freedom Beat has been part of the conversation regarding Las Vegas' top 24/7 dining options ever since opening and although still sort of hidden at Downtown Grand it shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,3,4,FHGG0RXnLW4EsmFIUHUf9Q

5385538,2017-08-08,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"Went for the all you can eat Freedom2Brunch on Sunday and it wasn't anything I'd go back to.  First, way too long to get served.  The place was understaffed to the point where two different people told us they'd be ""right back"" to help us and a third person eventually showed up.  Over 10 minutes sitting there before we were offered water.  Since this servers bring the all you can eat food, they are constantly on the run and there just aren't enough of them.  I'm guessing that if they had to hire more, they'd have to raise the price and it's already pushing what it's worth.
The food is unspectacular.  It does open with the best piece though, fresh cinnamon monkey bread, but the thinly sliced and meager fruit platter that accompanies it kind of brings it down. A few different varieties of Eggs Benedict, slider (yes, singular), waffles, fish & chips, biscuits & gravy, etc.  The gravy on my biscuits tasted like ground beef gravy instead of sausage on top of a hard (as opposed to fluffy) biscuit.  Everything was heavy on the starch components.  Lousy, greasy fries too.  
The one guy on a stool playing guitar was pretty good, but he was so loud the waitress couldn't hear us.  Entertainment during the meal is nice, but turn it down a notch and everyone can still appreciate it. 
All in all, Vegas just has better options.  It's a decent atmosphere, but slow service and meh food make it a pass for me.",wFdvn2LuVHmyJgBvssqssw,0,0,2,2O_W8KjahoCn9pq4H3lWGQ

This was such a fun & uniquely offered dinner.  There was about 26 people that attended - several of which we had the pleasure of meeting during the pre-dinner meet & greet.  The tickets sold out fast for this.  The price was $35 plus tax, which included being served a three course meal with beer pairing.  I must say for not being a beer drinker, the beers they chose were all amazing and I'd drink again!!!  Also the hurricanes flowed a plenty.  The meal started with 'Antoine's Oysters Rockefeller, Sausage & Chicken Gumbo with tasso & Andouille.  My husband said, hands down, best Oysters he's EVER had ANYWHERE.  The Entree was Classic crawfish Boil, Sweet corn, potatoes & Spiced sausage with Shrimp & Grits - JUMBO SHRIMP and Cheesy Grits.  This was served family style by tossing it all out on the table covered in newspaper for everyone to dig in.  The finale was Bananas Foster done table side by Scott Commings himself & fresh Beignets as good as Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  
I cannot say enough good things about this meal, the Chefs involved in this & all the staff of Freedom Beat.  
They really outdid themselves this first go around.
I also have to admit that I felt like a YELP queen there without having to be an ""Elite.""  Everyone right down to the bartender & cocktail servers made us feel super Elite!!!  
Upon exiting the group dining room, they surprised everyone with gift bags.

I was looking for somewhere unique, which would offer bottomless beverages and great food. I came across Freedom Beat and it sounded fantastic. Since we were a larger party (7), we made a reservation, and I am glad we did.

Freedom Beat is the 24 hour restaurant located on the casino floor of the Downtown Grand Hotel. When we arrived, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated. Luckily, we didn't have to wait because we had made a reservation!

They offer AYCE brunch, which is small plates, as well as bottomless mimosas. I had really high hopes for this place, but was overall disappointed. Here's why:

- They would only allow us to order 2 items per person. That wouldn't be a big deal, but it took FOREVER for the food to come out. It was small plates and our server didn't take another order in time for us to get more food quickly enough. I suggest they follow what Border Grill does: offer to send out a bunch of plates for the table to share, and just keep them coming. 
- The service was sloooooooow. I understand that it was busy and that the kitchen may have been backed up, but I don't think our server could handle it. I ended up feeling disappointed because I don't think I got my money's worth, and I ended up hungry again a short time later. 

The music was great and we loved it! So there's that. They also validated our parking, so it was nice to not have to pay. Overall, the concept is a good one, it's just poorly executed and needs some work.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,0,0,3,VGU6-sbFVFKgW8XDyHV1MQ

5815730,2017-04-10,0,3QcTqsdxQBlSndBdMJBRhQ,"Absolute worst service of my entire life. We were seated fairly quickly seeing as how there were only 4 tables in total when we got there. There were seven of us. Our orders were also taken pretty quickly but that was the only thing quick about this place. We were also told by our waiter that they only serve American beers so no corona. No big deal except for the fact that they do serve coronas. Only found that out because after 20 mins of waiting for our drinks a couple people in our party finally just went up to the bar and ordered their drinks which they got right away. Two of us ordered the Bloody Mary bar and I ordered the bottomless mimosas but I didn't receive my first one until about 25mins in after we got the attention of another server. After 30 mins our server finally comes over I let him know that although I ordered the all you can eat brunch I never put an order in with him. So I put my order in and also added another mimosa. Two of my party ordered the chicken sandwich while the rest of us ordered the all you can eat. They got their sandwiches about 35 mins in and he comes over with an unopened bottle of champagne and a big glass of orange juice. He slides the bottle of champagne to one of the guys at our table and says ""open this for me"". He then says that I can just pour them myself. It was super annoying but at least I didn't have to wait 20mins in between each mimosa. We finally get our food 45mins after getting there and so we order some more so they can get the next batch started. The meals are like the size of your fist and really tasty. We then wait about 20 more mins after that. At this point we're all pretty pissed. We've been there for over an hour and paid $20 to get one small portion of food. At any point in time if he would have just said hey I apologize were really short staffed today I'm doing the best I can and just basically pointed out that he knew there was an issue and that he was trying to fix it we all would have been completely fine but nope never did. When we finally just gave up and asked to see a manager he just said okay great and left. We're now waiting 15 more mins for the manager and in that time we get another round of food that is all wrong. Our server finally comes back over with no manager and asks us what is wrong. We tell him everything and then he tries to defend himself. Basically he doesn't want us talking to the manager. He leaves after we say that we're done talking to him about it and that we'd just like to talk to the manager. 15 mins later we're still waiting for the manager. We're all just ready to leave and forget about paying, but a lot of our party works in the service industry and we understand it's not just him that gets no money if we don't pay. Anyways we finally get the manager she seems pleasant enough but kind of seems like she doesn't care and just wants us out of there. We wind up paying for the two sandwiches and one all you can eat brunch. It was a complete nightmare. Also we're not that crazy demanding table. As we were leaving two other tables we're asking for a manager. Still not really sure what the issue was if they were short staffed and this guy just couldn't handle it or if he was just the worst server ever.

My Cast Iron Chicken Pot Pie with peas and carrots that was prepared in a shallow skillet was good but not very creamy, and while no salt was noted on one side of the small pie, excessive salt was detected on the other.

Our server said the Stone Soup of the day that changes daily was Beef & Barley, when it actually turned out to be Cream of Mushroom.  I liked the flavor but it was served in a small bowl, and only bits of mushroom were included in the dish.  Service was very good otherwise, and I preferred Cream of Mushroom Soup over Beef Barley anyway.

The ambiance is very casual here, with several tables and booths situated around a stage where live music is sometimes played.

I'm in Nevada at least two weeks every month so the downtown grand is a convent place to stay while waiting on an air bnb but this restaurant is pretty lame. They handle room service and I've gotten the saddest Cesar salad known to man delivered. They're always out of the first 3 things I want to order.

Yesterday I stopped in for breakfast and got a great portion of food for $12 but they waiter told me there was a full bar and when I ordered a Bloody Mary, they don't carry the bloody mix but I could walk the 30 feet to the casino bar and order one??

I guess there's no huge need to impress inside their hotel since there is plenty of great food right across third street but a little bit of service and consistency would go a loooong way.

They also have some great live entertainment.",ipK-fapxKAHekGfRLeP41Q,0,0,5,5z7rf9YhaDiNyYqjIgZs_A

Very clean and excellent service, the atmosphere and the dress is casual. There is live music which makes it very entertaining for the happy public. 

Some dishes are better than others but it is one of the best places with offers that are offered in the center of the city with a variety of fresh dishes to satisfy a group without resorting to the buffet. 

Drinkers can add a bottomless option for $ 10!!!",lqrfzgZUKl0dXt6HAim2kQ,0,0,4,yIyRhY0Sd2k_iw_I9ilhgg
