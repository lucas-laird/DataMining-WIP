We come here for cookies or pies after we eat at one of the restaurants in Sam's or after the movies. Sometimes just for a drink, which we never have to wait too long for. :) There's not usually too long of a line and it's right by an entrance/exit to Sam's.",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,0,0,3,q3OnwMqxStJzWowo3Y_zvg

And then wipe it on their uniforms. Their uniforms look like they haven't been washed in months. I think the manager should really watch who's she's hiring and for what position, as in, not long hair all over while their making your food. They should have hair nets at least. Never coming back here even if it was the last place on earth to get something to eat. Avoid this place, go to panda right next door. They look a lot cleaner.",HBe9fodpxpxMpi4vck6VHw,2,2,1,xK3gTDK9QM4_Dhu5IYZMnw

Yelp wants me to write the review and I am tired of seeing this when I go on the welcome screen. So, I will write a review on the McDonald's in Sam's Town.

  When I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald's unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam's Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don't know of any McDonald's where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion.

  The Sam's Town McDonald's is one of a few food choices in Sam's Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald's is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. 

The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald's of Sam's Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald's in the D casino, the employees are friendly.

 This summarizes my experiences for the Sam's Town McDonald's. Yelp should be happy that I wrote the review, and I should be happy to see a new picture on my welcome screen.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,4,4,3,pxbR6PR6yTq9vF4FSZe-KQ

5418414,2018-06-14,0,Ysgtu1olgNPFLXYS0yl9hg,"if im yelping McD's... its bad
Server (poss mngr) doesn't wear gloves, coughed all over food (after picked nose wipe forehead in clear sight), when called out on it, Mngr put food back to get re-served.  I told her she could make a new round of food or give me my money back, at that point she said she had used tongs, like somehow assuming I was temporarily blind and didn't see what occurred 3 feet away,

When I told her I saw she did not use tongs she said ""If you're going to be an as.h..e I wont give u a refund"" she then proceeded to let me wait as she served (corrected) other peoples orders,

Refunded my order and As handed me receipt she said ""f..k y.u"". 

100% totally Unsanitary & looked like worked there on a work release program,

Just read the other reviews,",SqbN13XGwOJp-CTDAkoFyw,0,0,1,zkz9XYc-gcbB4tcRxwsJ8A

Took our order incorrectly, blamed us for it, overcharged us, wouldn't fix it, and was rolling his eyes the whole time, tried to hide his name from us and only gave it to us when we insisted. Then didn't even apologize for any of it!",7BFzXVH0YppEq6SbcvaABQ,0,0,1,g0gpw8uePUGmdZeAY584EA

When I walked up to the counter and was not greeted, and when the girl handed me my sweet tea she did it like she had an attitude.
