It's an a heavily Hispanic populated area, so the choices are endless for Mexican food. The question I always have is do I venture away from the mainstream. Of course. 
I had the lunch special that came with three small carne asada tacos, rice and beans. It wasn't bad. The price was cheap $4.50. 
The carne asada was overcooked a tad, the beans were the worst. It looked like poo-poo. 
The salsa was nice and spicy though just the way I like it. 
Not a bad place to come to if you need a quick filler upper and you're on this side of town.",xU4silHWZGOWz92hPIdFpQ,3,0,3,xQ5qbtgntLwB3yWKpVZxVw

We were the only two people in there, there were 3 servers and who I would guess was the cook sitting at a booth. The waitress came and took our order, we both ordered ice tea to drink, when the ice tea arrived at our table the lime was dry and shriveled up (obviously old) I ordered the Cameron empanizados (Breaded Shrimp) He ordered the seafood cocktail. When the shrimp arrived it was an obviously frozen prepared food that I could have bought at my local market and cooked at home. His seafood cocktail had imitation crab, 2 pieces of octopus, 1 shrimp and assorted cucumbers and a couple of unidentified pieces of veggies, our bill was $43.00. We left leaving full plates of food, what a disappointment. Very Bad Food!",QLwn2nZBPeENK1L9GMSOfw,2,0,1,922SpY1-o3Cc17hmI0TrSQ
