I decided to go in one morning....bad idea. They have machine that you place your own order on. They are confusing and caused many patrons to have issues. Even with that, it wouldn't take my card so I still had to wait in line. So basically I waited in two lines with my 5 month old. On the automated ordering kiosk you can't specify take out and they gave me my items on a tray....with a baby in my hand. Another customer offered me help, no one in the store did. I finally flagged someone down who could put it in a bag for me. Hoping this new store works out their kinks.

We ordered nuggets to go and had to wait more than 15min and they were people waiting to order food and they were never greeted or anything. All employees were in the back chitchatting and laughing out loud while people waiting. If I can give a 0 start I would. They don't deserve this one star.

This McDonald's has all the modern technology! Double drive-thru, order kiosks, touch screen soda fountains, and advanced kitchen appliances. I highly recommend going inside this McDonald's and using the Kiosk to order your food. It's pretty cool! Their interior design is unique. I've never been to a McDonald's that looks anything like this one.

The food is consistent to the fast food chain. It is always a quick and convenient option for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night cravings. In my opinion the food tastes better here as a result of the new kitchen appliances.

Their service is honestly what irritates me the most. This McDonald's has never been able to get my order right. If I ask for things like ""no cheese,"" they ignore my request. I made the habit to ask the worker if there is sauce in the bag or if they gave me napkins. Their response is always ""yeah it's in the bag."" Disappointingly, every time I open the bag they always forget the napkins and sauces. It's annoying!!!",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,3,1,4,jBpgC_5aMzmbBp1vg3j3Zw

I'm surprised by all the negative reviews of this McDonald's. I absolutely LOVE this location...and the customer service inside the store is GREAT.
I have never used the Drive-Thru for ordering...so I can't say anything about that situation....Nor have I ever came here at any other times other than the 6-7 A.M. time slot M-F.

The employees in the early morning are Great. Mostly all females it seems when I come in at that time.
Personable, Friendly and Efficient employees. 8))

Store is Very CLEAN, and every single table has fresh lovely flowers on them....What a nice touch....It Looks so nice. They also have 2 do it your self ordering Kiosks if you don't want to wait in the line...Just do it your self...Take a #...and SIT DOWN.

The ordering was simple and can even pay at the order machine.

And the positivity stops there. I ordered my nearly $5 medium smoothie (I've always thought they were overpriced but I like them enough that I'll pay the extra dollars) and my 10- piece nuggets. The smoothie is handed to me in a cup that is typically a small size, by all traditional standards. But for McD's smoothies, it's their designated ""medium."" I already knew this. My issue was that the cup wasn't full. Since I already have agreed to pay more money for a smaller smoothie, I think I at least deserve a completely full cup. When I asked them to fill it up, the original smoothie was thrown away by an employee. I didn't think that was necessary. I was fine with them just making up the difference. A couple minutes later I was informed that they were out of my smoothie flavor. As for my nuggets 2 were soggy and visibly undercooked, and 1 was bruised with brown/ red discoloration. I walked out with a new batch of nuggets and no smoothie. 

I'm giving the location 2 stars because the staff was nice, apologetic, and I was fully refunded my money.

They have one of the double order drive-thrus, but they don't seem to know how to use it. The double order drive-thrus are meant to take two orders at one time, but they only seem to go back and forth between the two sides and it creates a bottleneck. I've never had a problem with the food being cold or in my orders being incorrect though. I've only been inside once. They do have the new self order kiosks, which are pretty cool. I really only keep coming to this location because it's just down the road from me.",Yy0CAv2eIy-X1BDbtzXykQ,0,0,3,nkcQTqHeB6nfBAD9TwD0Zw

Descent customer service, people that work in the kitchen need to wear gloves often when grabbing the food from the freezer, I did see couple of them with no gloves on grabbing chicken from the freezer! They need more people since this new location is always busy! They need to smile more! I waited 20 minutes to get my iced coffee and it wasn't that busy and I had to go to work so I was late to work. there just too slow and short on staff so they need to hire more people! I'd give it a 1 star.I don't know if I'd go there again.",FaWxEXjzSfLvhGabNy71fQ,0,0,1,AfGYBNIOz6-8OUrQc6zchg

I ordered through drive thru, so it seems they have the dual order system. Which is very unimpressive, if it makes you wait until the other Persian is done ordering, I just literally sat there and heard their complete order.  I am hoping they were just understaff and this is not how the system is developed.  After I finally completed my order, I continues to wait as they're was quite a few cars ahead of me. Finally I hit the next service window that took my form of payment, a young lady who looked most uninterested in being there. I definitely avoided making further eye contact with her as I was parked next to her window waiting to move. Geez talk about awkward!  Anyhow I definitely do not plan on coming back here for awhile, the wait was unbelievable, by the time I got my food- the fries were warm, the chicken nuggets were warm and had a very strange smell! Which I did not go back because, I didn't want to waste anymore time here. Plus the lady that gave me my food, kindly informed me that they ran out of water bottles, and if I wanted a large beverage, I politely declined and said I don't drink that stuff and thats why I ordered water, and she told me she would be happy to give me a big cup of water, as tempting as toilet water sounds, I reminded her I am not interested in paying for free water!  Wow!  Is all I have to say!  I am definitely not pleased with my visit here today! Nor am I impressed that this is a new location, they need to reevaluate how they manage this place",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,3,1,3,QrB-6VQQOrQfvA-njHidDw

If it was not for the McDonald's app or Yelp, I would have drove past this recently opened location (they opened just 6 days ago) across from the South Point Casino.

When I arrived, I saw that they have touchscreen ordering kiosks just off to the left as you walk in, across from that section is their traditional cashier station. Since I was using a promo code, I heard straight for the counter instead of the kiosk, but the young lady said I have to place my order there.

So I was a bit more lost when dealing with the kiosk, trying to figure out how or when you would input the promo code for my order.  Luckily, a friendly and very helpful manager stepped up (she did this with all the customers that came in after me as well) and asked if I needed any assistance. And after letting her know about what I was attempting to do, she put in the order for two Egg McMuffins and I paid at the cashier counter after she promo me of my Egg McMuffins.

My order is to go, since I still have a lot of packing and cleaning to do, but I will be back in the near future. But while waiting for my order to be prepared, I glanced around this new McDonald's and really like the modern looking dining area and decor.

Well, that's it for now. 

Positive vibes.

----2nd visit update----
I came back to get some breakfast and dine-in. The ordering process was a lot smoother this second visit. In fact, my order was ready to be handed to me at my table even before I got back with two packets of ketchup.

Also on the way out, I tried to use the mobile app's Buy One Get One Caramel Macchiato at the kiosk, but there was some error. And after trying to resolve it at the cashier station, the order ended up getting completely comped. So now I feel even more obligated to come back for one of their premium sandwiches for lunch.

I am loving it!!!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,5,34klAjiolYlBAPTZzwB1PQ
