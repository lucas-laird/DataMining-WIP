If you're reading this whole review, I want to recommend some recipe tips. 
Just like any wok style food, size and type matter for cooking time.  Picking larger vegetables will yield crunchier results, why smaller cut vegetables yields softer, more sauce absorbed food.  Cooking time is dependent on the meat.  Large pieces of meat can act as a wall and tofu as a base. Pile the vegetables in the middle to make a higher tower of food.  
My sauce recommendation is 1 scoop pineapple, 1 scoop hot, 3 scoops garlic (get the bottom to have garlic pieces) and 1 scoop house.   
Add some pineapple and sesame seeds.  
There aren't many restaurants like this in the area so I am thrilled about it.",UGzG7JupCO6GRsxNNJBjIQ,0,0,5,sPKay3CiZHJ2C3GCSrW5Kg

2052517,2018-06-11,0,hs6q3UzhivmNg_ZVxJMNoQ,"When we went the place smelled like propane, so we took ours to go. The bowls were kind of small and the set up to load your bowl up is not ideal. There is a large overhang to keep the food sanitary that makes it hard to pick up the food. As a result, there is a lot of food toppling into where it doesn't belong. Everyone working there was super nice and eager to help us out, though. And everything tasted great. It's also the only mongolian BBQ place (that I know of, at least) within walking distance to UNLV so kudos for giving the UNLV students a unique option.",QLPFK1F0pZaFTrbg1Km-TQ,0,0,3,RJ8wU-7d67zhQQGgFsVHHA

There are ""recommended"" noodle pairing for every taste bud, just in case you don't feel like doing your own things. 

Less than 2 weeks since they've opened but this place shows a lot of promise, the owners are super friendly and love to come say hi!

Happy Eating!",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,0,0,5,g64D-llL6_BEr6HwRYtrDg

Then hand your plate to the chef and he cooks it up for you in no time. The process is so fast that you can almost call this a fast food joint. But no, my Yelp universe, it is not a fast food place. Far from it. Stir Krazy food and the people working there make you feel like right at home. I highly recommend them, you won't be disappointed!",Q8tUuOcVrlPXiwhV5SLUjw,0,0,5,S-vFkBAkrHYd4CLnW8LhLg
