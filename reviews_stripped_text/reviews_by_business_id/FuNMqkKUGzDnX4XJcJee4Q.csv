We where looking at the menu for a long time cause it was our first time and the cashier wasn't very helpful. They didn't have thick crust because they where out of it. And the whole time the cashiers where just so annoyed! It didn't bother me until the girl brought me my garlic roll things and I said thank you and the girl didn't even smile or say you're welcome . There's just something unprofessional about this place. Ya feel me? 

The pizza was okay. The ranch was okay. We're very picky about our ranch. The garlic things where okay. Maybe We'll come back. Probably not.",lvMi0T_XG4FBg1Bm_Z6I-w,3,0,3,fn1nFRHqQQ7120IE6rBOAQ

303431,2012-08-03,2,FuNMqkKUGzDnX4XJcJee4Q,"An east-coast pizza joint is finally up here in Utah!  Hooray!

While not the best pizza I've ever had, it is certainly a much better option than the chain restaurants that flood this area of town.  It's a thinner crust pizza, slightly greasy (think NY style), and topped with fresh ingredients. 

My problem is that I had two completely different experiences here ordering the same exact thing.  Both times we ordered the Tomato Basil pizza.  The first time the crust was cooked perfectly- not soggy and not burnt- and they were generous with the toppings.  This included tons of garlic which I was very happy about.  

The next week, we ordered the same thing since our previous experience was so good.  But this time they were stingy with ingredients (no garlic boo) and the crust was soggy in the middle.  If this would have been my first go at the place, I wouldn't have been impressed and I probably would have never bothered going back.  Luckily for them I know Cugino's has potential.

I've also ordered a slice of Sicilian style (thicker, doughier crust- good) and the garlic knots (fluffy dough with lots of garlic- yum).

I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and rate them four stars based off our first experience and hoping that our second time was a fluke.  

Oh, and a suggestion: please put the basil on the pizza after it comes out of the oven so that it keeps its flavor.  Thanks!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,4,4,blQ067ywp9hef1JHhIFxTg

I tried Cuginos Pizza last week and liked it a lot.  I called today at 2:30P and was told that they will not be delivering until 4P. Decided to order Rosatti's 294-1212... The pizza is just as good (if not better) and the delivery is always on time and consistent. 
Would like to give this place 4/5stars however they need to get their act together and shell out for a daytime delivery driver.  Not a good idea to get between a fat man and his pizza.",mCz4AYDBzpXs8wEIEcoa0A,4,1,2,O0MwAdoI1xIEIL8iuHF6GA

I expect pizza, especially with pepperoni to be greasy, but this was dripping grease. I sopped up as much as good with napkins but it was still really greasy! Good, but GREASY.

So I called them for the first time and ordered 2 garden salads and the Cugino special with added basil.  I LOVED this pizza.  It tasted like all fresh ingredients. Like another reviewer, I thought it was a little pricey. Until I tasted it. Then I realized that there was something wrong with all of the other pizzas I have tried. I am guessing inferior ingredients.  SO you get what you pay for. It was also more filling than other pizzas I have tried, so we had some left over and are eating it for breakfast this morning. DELICIOUS!
 Also, I ordered small garden salads and when I have ordered from other places they WERE small.  One of those little Styrofoam boxes.  But at Cugino's, they put it in the large Styrofoam container and it was filled up.  And they gave me TWO containers of salad dressing. 
If they keep doing it the way they are doing it, I will never go anywhere else for pizza.

I double checked my online receipt and it clearly stated ham so I called the store.

Many times I couldn't figure out the bill, I tried to figure out how they would come up with the amount I was being charged.  Finally last Friday night I called in an order and we picked it up.

It was late so the next day I went in and spoke with the owner, he basically called me a liar and said there was nothing he could do about it.  I said you're willing to lose a customer over this and he said yes.

My husband had the veal parm. So good and large that we had to take half of it home. They make their own mozzarella cheese and sauce( gravy) as well. Great experience and run by a nice family.

We ordered a medium half White Special and half Cugino's Special, paid and sat down.  Then another worker comes out to tell us they can't make a half white and half red sauce pizza.  When I asked why... she shrugged her shoulders and pointed to the man at the pizza oven.  So I went over for an explanation and he said because the sauce would run unto the white side.  I assured him it was fine as neither of us were allergic to sauce we just wanted to try two different styles on one pie. OMG how difficult are we huh.   He made a gesture like okay have your way and continued.  

We received our pie and the White Special was good with just the right garlic seasoning and chunks of ricotta, while the Cugino's Special which consisted of pre-cooked green bell peppers and pepperoni was not that great but the crust itself was delicious.  We also shared an Antipasto Salad with their house vinaigrette which was delicious and big enough for two. 

Overall I've experienced better pizza and service.    Although they closed at 9pm and it was only 8pm the staff was more preoccupied with getting the place closed down than anything else.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,6,3,3,Tq1p_ik5eZmJp-XLl8lg4g
1606553,2014-10-19,7,FuNMqkKUGzDnX4XJcJee4Q,The pizza here is good. Thin or Sicilian it's good. Specials don't run from certain times during lunch it's actually all day which I like. Sicilian pizza is thick and the size of the slices are big enough to not leave you hungry at all. One thing I wasn't that crazy about it the garlic knots. The knots were kind of tough and appeared to have a lot of seasoning on them yet I really didn't taste any garlic at all. The meat sauce that came with the knots though tasted very good. I have stopped by on my lunch break and seen different types of pizza out so even though they have a daily special board it doesn't mean you can actually get any of that. If it's the younger guy he will only sell you what's out but if it's the older guy he will make any pizza or sandwich you want if you are willing to wait for it.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,11,10,4,v49YQeN-2l--Adf-8xCFpQ

I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. They only had some regular slices available on this last visit. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, since i was hoping for some of their delicious Sicilian, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it.

Don't know if this is the same peeps as the location on Maryland but we decided to check it out. We got a medium pizza, but I wanted a White Pizza, and Wifey wanted a combination style pizza, so  we ordered half white, and half Cugino's Special, their version of a combination. To start, we also shared an Antipasto Salad which was decent.

Upon delivering our salad, our waitress returns to tell us that the pizza maker cannot make the pizza. We already knew that the red and white sauces may mix and run into each other (it really didn't though), and we didn't mind, so our waitress relayed that message to the pizza maker , and sure enough, the pizza came out how we wanted.

I liked the white Pizza half, but the combination side was not my favorite due to the onions and peppers being pre-cooked and put on after the pizza came out.. not bad for our first visit, and it's conveniently in our neck of the woods.  ALOHA!!!

We ordered a pizza, salad, and a sausage sandwich.  

We tried to order their Sicilian pizza but they said they were out. So we had to eat a regular pizza. 

The pizza and sandwich were ok, the sauce was very lacking, like a plain tomato Sauce. I will admit I am picky with pizza sauce. 

The sandwich had the same sauce I believe as the pizza, which kinda made it not so enjoyable. But it was pretty good size and filling. 

The salad was actually pretty decent, we just got the regular house salad and added cheese. The ingredients were all fresh and crisp. I would consider ordering just a salad from here in the future if they were still open at the time we wanted to eat.

My iron armored gut was destroyed by the flaming trebuchet entree at this place. First of all, for a pizza place, as in their main purpose is making pizza, you'd think they'd make a better pizza. The reason the food is so cheap is quite clear; it tastes like the quality of a piece of cardboard lathered with crappy ketchup (not even Heinz) and then dipped in egregious amounts of secondhand grease. However, being the food trooper that I am I charged on and plowed through my two slice pepperoni special, and washed it down with a double dose of carbonated lemon-lime refreshment. 

Away I went, dissatisfied and underwhelmed, but not as perturbed as to write a bad Yelp review. I believe in second chances, unless hours later the first chance gives me the most bowel shattering bubble guts I've ever had in my adult life. I'm quite literally in moderate pain as I write this, and will be shortly on my way to pick up a bottle of chalky pink goop to aid me in my agony. 

If I were you I would bypass this establishment, for you'd have a better dining experience at Robertos or Dicky's BBQ next door, even if you are if off the floor. You would also save yourself of hours of despair, and frequent worship to the porcelain God (from both ends). 

The most disappointing thing about this entire event is that my iron core has been shattered. Broken is the belief that I could eat anything without fear. The only silver lining is that they do not stock and hot sauces, and for that I am grateful.

Whenever I see a WHITE pizza available,it's almost a guarantee I'll order it!  

So of course, I ordered the Large White Pizza ($17.99): Ricotta, Romano & Mozzarella Cheese, Pepperoni and Italian Sausage. They have an excellent white pizza here! Although I enjoyed both toppings, the Pepperoni was winner today.  I felt like the portion size, toppings, and taste were all worth the entry price.

And there was just the RIGHT amount of cheese, grease and fat on this bad boy.   If your pizza isn't oily, greasy and fatty...I don't wanna eat it!

Also ordered the Garlic Knots ($2.99). These were VERY good...a bit more crispy than most, but very tender breading on the inside and LOTS of garlic flavor!  Yum :)

If a pizza place can't make a good garlic knot, chances are they can't make a good pie either!  Rest assured, Cugino's can do both well...in my book :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,3,0,4,iEowS5366GLSleECFi-OqA

5280731,2015-03-30,0,FuNMqkKUGzDnX4XJcJee4Q,"The pizza here is pretty darn good. Sauce is excellent and the crust is even better. The pizza is cooked in a brick oven and gives the crust a real Italian taste to it. Had just the right amount of cheese and meats. I ordered over the phone and was told about 15-20 minutes. Got there and the pizzas were sitting there ready to go. I love things to be on time and they were nice and hot. I ordered a pepperoni and a meat lovers. The meat lovers was loaded and the meats were very very tasteful. They definitely didn't skimp on either pizza.

The only thing I could even complain even a little bit about was the price. The pizza's I got were 2 medium's and the price came out to just over $28 but that is the only thing I could complain about even just a little bit. I feel 2 medium pizza's shouldn't be more than $25 at the most.

Other than that, if you are looking for great tasting pizza and a friendly staff then I would definitely give Cugino's Pizzeria a whirl.",r9yGXzFLQ7A55Ac-Lu436g,1,1,4,nLTY38UxYi6BC3ElN_sX0A

Sadly, every time we arrive 15-20 minutes after ordering, the pizza is never ready to be picked up. we always end up waiting another 5 minutes. The dough has great flavor and their crust rises nicely. The amount of crunch is good and it's not too floppy or soft like other pizza places.

So the rude man who was cooking came up to take our order. My daughter really wanted pasta. They refused and said no more pasta for the night since they were closing in 20 minutes...  Apparently their clock is fast and at the end of the night service becomes crappy. My husband decided that we should order anyway and get her a side of meatballs instead. I ordered a drink with my food. I didn't get it. When my husband asked to get a drink the guy at the back came up again and acted like this was our fault. I left to sit in the car.

We walked into an empty restaurant, but that didn't stop us form trying it out. The brick oven was blazing and my stomach was needing food. We ordered the everything pizza and a dozen garlic knots.

The chef went right away to warming up our knots and then creating out pizza. Nothing like watching them make your pizza on the spot. Our garlic knots arrived at our table soon after we finished filling our drinks. I have had better garlic knots, but these were not drenched in butter or oil like most places so i was happy with that. The sauce was cold, sorry but I'm a warm marinara guy.

Our pizza came straight out of the oven, Thank goodness we still had knots to nibble on or else i would of burnt my mouth, it looked that fantastic! The dough reminded me of a boston style, and i love my boston crust. The topping were fresh and delicious, not to much cheese and the proper amount of everything. Just all around a perfect pizza.

On our way out we did see a sign about $5 specials for a coke and 2 slices. I'm sure they get more business during lunch time based on that sign.",bvr5-SZikO9DexmFmCn_4g,1,1,4,d82V5Cyh4fiVWFYHyLvZfw
