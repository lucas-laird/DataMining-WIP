I ordered the #3, which is the crispy honey chicken. We had to wait over 15 minutes for our food, the chicken was definitely not made in house, it was some something like Tyson any'tizers chicken, with honey sauce poured over it. It had a weird taste and I was left feeling a bit sick afterwords. The dish says it comes with a vegetable, but what it really comes with is cabbage slaw that I found to distasteful, it also came with a salad that had an unpleasant dressing over it. The atmosphere is not something special. Also, their rice cooker was dirty and looked like it needed a good cleaning. The employees there lacked personality and seemed to not enjoy what they are doing. Also the cook was on his phone while he was cooking which I find to be rude.

I ate the salmon teriyaki and it was cooked just right - still juicy and tender! They give you bottles of their teriyaki sauce and you can slather on as much as desired to fit your taste buds.

This is the best teryaki house in town. 
Everything is cooked right then, all meat is prepared on the grill and the rice steamed same day. 
Everything tastes delicious. 

My favotites are the Chicken Teryaki (#1) and Beef Teryaki. The cabbage is another great add on. They use a special vinegar light dressing, it is so good. 
I usually ask fot double cabbage instead of one portion of cabbage and one portion of the other green salad. 

And the Teryaki sauce itself is the best in town. I tried  some other Teryaki places recently, and the main ingredient - the Teryaki sauce was bad there, either too sweet or they add an extra unuasual slice ot ingredient to it. But at Teryaki House, it's the right taste and is just perfect. 

I also love the fact that it's locally owned. The owner himself is working in the restaurant most of the time and is always very friendly and helpful.

I've been coming to Teriyaki House since I first moved to the Valley in 2003. Same management still to this day. And the quality of food has never changed over the years. 

Because of the location (business plaza next to subway and coffee bean on south end of Rainbow before you get to 215 and arroyo plaza) this plaza is packed during the office lunch hours... They do lots of to go orders and have lots of people in and out during lunch breaks, so their quick and speedy service is definitely a best plus and a great quality they have. 

The place is small, not restaurant size at all. But the quality of food and service is so constant I have a hard time not wanting to come back. 

I always go for the tempura combination bento box which includes 2shrimp tempuras onion ring potato sweet potato and broccoli tempura. Along with that is a salad with light soy sauce dressing, pickled shredded cabbage, bowl of rice and your choice of #1-7 meat choices. All comes out to $9.39 with tax. Can't beat the prices and I leave stuffed every time! I always either go with Katsu chicken or Thai chicken as my meat option. Food is not too salty and I love how it's fried when ordered. But it's nothing mind blowing. Similar to chicken or Chinese food at the mall. 

They offer lunch specials of the day for a little over $7 with tax, they have huge serving of noodle bowls and they cook to order which I find good quality in. 

So why only 3stars? Well, it's not mind blowing food first of all, it's great lunch option or even quick dinner option, but that's what it is... Good quick eats. Nothing date worthy unless it's casual business or hanging out quick eats option. #2 I've watched them clean up after people leave and not saying they don't clean up... Coz they do, but not matter how many times I come... The tables are always sticky. Its a pet peeve of mine sticky tables. #3 the decor of the place is plain jane. It's like it makes me wanna eat alone and like I been saying just grab a quick great quality meal by myself. But if someone asked me hey let's grab food... Teriyaki House would NOT come to mind coz it's just so simple, wouldn't want to waste time grubbing with a friend there. Does that make sense... 

But hey I'm still a fan and I will always be back for my tempura combo bento box but probably only by myself",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,4,5,3,VqmaIsd0ADBpxaqzVOOOLw

The line was LONG but it did move quick.  I got there right at the peak of their lunch rush.  Needless to say I did have to wait a bit for my food but it was well worth the wait.  :) 

The chicken was hot and the gyoza was crispy.  :) Rice with teriyaki sauce was delicious.  The lunch special came with 2 salads.  One normal iceberg salad with a soy sauce based dressing.  The other was a cabbage salad in a vinegar based dressing. Iceberg was iceberg.  :) But the cabbage was surprisingly refreshing even though the cabbage
 was crunchy.

You could totally tell this was a mom and pop place.  So cute.  There was this little old lady wiping tables and the owner taking the orders was great at staggering you so that u didn't wait as long for your food.  He would jump from taking orders to helping out his cooks by flipping the chicken on the grill.  Good timing on his part. :)

And if u like to see the action in the kitchen, you'll love this place since it's an open kitchen design.

I will admit never been too Teriyaki Madness. Sure there are other ones out there. The thing I like about this place is like the flavor of the teriyaki sauce reminds me of chicken teriyaki bowl or box back home Hawaii style. I have had the teriyaki but on this visit decided too go with the thai chicken, Any of the spicy ones nothing too worry about it being spicy spicy but add depth flavor too the sauce. The menu is pretty straight forward nothing too big and all the choices box style with rice, salad, and cabbage salad. Also have some appetizers and the kim chee is usually good although this visit never had it. 

Thai chicken grilled just right nice moist and ample sauce not piece in the bunch! The salad I REALLY enjoy with the house dressing its like sesame base type dressing. I could take bottle home if they bottled it. The salad greens nice fresh not bruises on the leaves. The shredded cabbage not really big fan of but still nice compliment with everything else. 

The service is pretty fast got my food quick, they have fountain station so endless refills for soda, and they have television inside for entertainment.

2759579,2014-08-02,5,OHXnDV01gLokiX1ELaQufA,"Looks like I found another solid Teriyaki joint!

Located off of Rainbow with Patrick as the nearest cross street, you can easily pass these guys if you are not looking hard enough. Once yo make your way in, you will see that there is about 8 tables with each having four chairs. 

I came in for lunch on a friday and man were they busy! As I am in line waiting to order I can understand why a lot of people come here to pick up their phone orders because most if not all of the tables were taken! Im glad somebody just got done eating as soon as I placed my order.

Looking at the menu, you can tell that it is easily understandable. As for any teriyaki place, especially one that I am trying for the first time, I always get some kind of Beef and Chicken Combo. Its always a bonus if you can get brown rice instead of white. Here you can do that but they charge you 85 cents for that substitution while some other places dont charge you at all.

So I order the #10 Beef and Chicken Combo Plate ($8.29). All their plates come with rice, garden salad, and vegetable. I gotta say that the chicken and beef was very good. It had a nice chargrilled taste about it and was tender. The salad had some kind of rice vinegar on it and I thought it could of used a bit more because halfway through I was just eating straight lettuce. The vegetable was some kind of cut up cabbage and I think it was pickled with a hint of ginger.

Service was friendly and as soon as your order is done cooking, they make sure to get your attention.

Some random info. Yes they take cards. You can always phone your order in, especially during those peak hours at lunch and dinner. If you're on a budget I suggest you try their different monday through friday lunch specials ($6.49) from 11 am to 2:30 pm. Hours are Monday through Saturday 11 am to 9 pm. Closed Sundays. Lastly, they have all the teriyaki and sriracha sauce you need on every table. Love the convenience.

Will definitley come back to try their other items for the plate I good was pretty good.

Fast and easy Japanese food option; their salad is really basic though and I wish they had a few more meat/tempura options.Their prices are low enough thought that buying an extra tempura plate doesn't make me protest. They say they charge for extra teriyaki sauce, but I think you can easily get more sauce here for free if you just pour it yourself after picking up a to-go order. This place is super casual and a good option if you are scrambling for time in the area. Yogi's and Volcano Grille are a bit more filling, but this place does salmon a lot better (while Yogi's doesn't do it at all).",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,1,1,3,itj5CWvOvsyu-hmaVCnraw

I'm just bummed that this side of the city has three very good local style places, and I have to choose between them..    I hate choices when I'm hungry, but this little hole in the wall is priced lower than Rice Trax, and Island Flavors;  also it's much easier to find than the other two places.

I really like Teriyaki house, but  they don't serve Mac salad as a standard item.   Please make it as upgrade item if you have too.    

Most of their meats are very good, and waiting time is no longer than 8 minutes.   So if you're on the run, this place can be as good going to McDonald during lunch rush if you want something now.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,1,1,4,Qc2XX7hKGWTeDEFLqR8FpA

Service- really friendly. It seemed as if it was the owner and he greeted us like he knew us. 

The food was good. I got the deluxe combo (#11) and it was really filling. I was able to split it and eat some the next day. 
I got the crispy chicken, teriyaki beef, and crispy calamari.  The crispy chicken was good. It is a rolled up ball of chicken, battered, and deep fried. Even though it was deep fried it tasted pretty healthy. The teriyaki beef was very tasty. Wasn't too sweet, and soft, not chewy. The crispy calamari is a must. Basically calamari fried to perfection. Comes with a side of sauce, I think sweet and sour sauce. My friend ended up finishing it before I could box it up.

I've never really tried other places that are more ""on the go"" rather than a sit down restaurant. I always thought their salmon teriyaki may not be as good. 

But, boy was I wrong! Teriyaki House is amazing. When I have a favorite, I typically only order it every time for the rest of eternity. I could eat their salmon teriyaki everyday if I could. But, that's not even the best part. The best part: their teriyaki sauce. Oh my... You might as well call my salmon teriyaki ""salmon teriyaki soup"" because of how much sauce I put in it. Their salmon comes perfectly and does not need any flavoring, but the sauce is just so dang good, I can't help myself.

We ordered the crispy chicken, Thai chicken, tempura, and deluxe combo plate with honey chicken beef teriyaki and calamari. 
The crispy chicken was a bit big and kind of hard to eat especially for our 6 year old you can't really but into them easily so you just kind of stuff a whole want and your mouth and hope you don't die.  Flavor was okay nothing really special here. 
The tempura was really good and tasted fresh and just right. 
The Thai chicken was really good as my partner said but I wasn't too impressed with it or the honey chicken I had in my order. 
The teriyaki beef was kind of disappointing and really chewy I wouldn't get it again and a very similiar experience with the calamari. Just not really a fan of the food here but the service was quick and friendly. If you go get the shrimp tempura.

I came across this new restaurant on a weekday for lunch.  It's more fast food than full service, which is great if you're on a lunch run from work.  Opting for their Tempura Plate ($6.99), which included two pieces each of shrimp, potato, onion, broccoli, and carrot. It also comes with rice, side salad and pickled cabbage.  It was a decent amount of tempura, but being the dipper that I am, I could have used a bit more sauce.

The BF arrived before me and ordered the Spicy Chicken ($5.79), which is deep fried chicken in a spicy sauce.  He told me not to order it and after tasting it, I could see why.  The batter was a bit too thick for these chicken pieces.

Another friend ordered the Calamari with Sauce Plate, which was deep fried calamari pieces with a spicy sauce similar to the one the Spicy Chicken came with.  It, too, was just okay.  

They also serve up pan fried noodle dishes from $5.50 to $6.95 that comes with mixed vegetables and a side of rice.  Side orders include gyozas, spring rolls, miso soup, and kim chee.  You can take advantage of their Daily Lunch Special from Mondays through Fridays (11 am to 2:30 pm) that are $5.95 and could be Chicken Teriyaki and Gyozas (Mondays) or Chicken Teriyaki and Chicken Katsu (Wednesdays).

As I got to the cashier, he didn't seem to be very eager to take my order.  I think when I asked questions, he seemed more annoyed than anything.  After I told him I would eat there, I quickly changed my mind and said to go.  He let a big sigh out as if to make it know how annoyed he was.  I decided to order the 3 combo with squid, thai chicken, and beef teriyaki.  it comes with rice, cabbage salad, and just your regular house salad with lettuce and carrots.  They don't deliver your food to your table, they call it out to you and you have to go back to the front to get the food.
