I was looking for an above average steakhouse to dine with family and upon consulting Yelp, The Steakhouse checked all the right boxes:

Good food
Good service
Good value
plus the added ""old school""/ ""hidden gem"" allure.

I arranged to visit The Steakhouse early, just when it opened up for the evening. As soon as you enter you can see the room where they age the steaks. The overall lighting is low, with the appropriate amount of light on each table. The overall decor  might seem ""old school"" as others have pointed out but I found it to be very appropriate for the type of the restaurant. The music also seemed to compliment the ""old school"" atmosphere with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin lightly playing in the background. While this looks like a somewhat ""dressy"" place the atmosphere is quite relaxed and unpretentious. 

All dishes at The Steakhouse include a big bread basket with quite a variety to choose from. All of them were fresh and delicious.

We tried the Porterhouse, Ribeye and Filet Mignon; all were cooked to perfection. Unseasoned of course so you can better enjoy the taste and quality of the meat and also so you may add one of the sauces The Steakhouse offers. The green peppercorn sauce stood out, crisp and flavorful. 

Each steak costs about $50 which I think is very reasonable:
Meat quality and cooking is splendid and the price includes the big bread basket as well as your choice of a salad or soup AND (that is, in addition to) your choice of baked potato, mashed potato or wild rice blend.

Since it was my first time at The Steakhouse, when I asked for the dessert menu, I was surprised to see that our server actually brought a whole dessert cart which showcased all the desserts. I assure you, this is much better than looking at a menu but it might also make your choice even more difficult as all the offerings looked delicious.
We sampled the creme brulee and the tiramisu and, as expected, they were splendid!

Service was exquisite: polite and attentive just when you needed them without annoying and pretentious interference. I can't stress enough how impressed I was.

If you want to enjoy a good steak dinner in a more than casual atmosphere then The Steakhouse is the place. Not only is the food excellent but the service as well. Couple these with not so unreasonable prices and you have quite possibly one of the best value for money steak houses on the Strip.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,10,3,5,4_xNL-1lHJ_HRNeU53BMxg

I can remember when you could walk from one end of the strip to the Tropicana in no time. I can remember my parents going to Cesar's palace to be entertained by Diana Ross. At the age of 3 my mom married my stepdad and He relocated us to Los Angeles,CA. They have transitioned. In October of 1968 my mom brought me to Circus Circus for their grand opening. I'm a professional. With my profession being law enforcement. I'm considered upper middle class. I'm a frequent flier and avid traveler. I visit Vegas yearly alone or with family and friends. But in October I come to Vegas alone to celebrate my birthday. It's sentimental for me. I come alone and think about all the beautiful memories I have of Las Vegas as a child. 
CIrcus Circus isn't really my cup of tea. However I stay here because of the memories. So my vacation started with 2-nights stay in Sedona ,AZ and then Las Vegas. Another tradition in our family is to go out to dinner for lobster. My parents didn't care what it cost we ate lobster for dinner. 
I've seen THE STEAK HOUSE several times but elected to eat at Palms or other restautants but on the 27th I decided to try it out??! Big mistake. I'm sure the staff are Donald Trump supporters. I have never in my life experienced the racism that I experienced in my life.  The waiter was so confused because I ordered the most expensive lobster platter on the menu. He couldn't answer simple questions I asked him. Mind you he was Asian and had the nerve to be racist...??African American people stay away from this place. The greeter wasn't any better. This place isn't all that trust me! Your just a cut above the Red Lobster. By the way I refuse to eat their also. I divorce them when they changed from the seafood broiler. I will never come here again. As a matter of fact I will never come back to Circus Circus again. The Steak House I just want to thank you for ruling my family tradition. Do not eat here if your AFRICAN AMERICAN",DZQjUnrtgO3Kn2q9-vgdTQ,1,0,1,a3yZai9xi1cmb4Wz1CJsnA

Came with 2 friends on Tuesday night at 5:30.  Drinks specials before 6pm!  

First course was house salad with honey mustard.  The dressing was a little heavily poured but good nonetheless.  For dinner, I ordered the petite filet (medium) with garlic mashed potatoes and chef's choice of vegetable (carrots)....paired with house Cab.  Meat was cooked perfectly along with the carrots.  The garlic potatoes were excellent.  

Dessert was sampler of creme brulee, basically 4 small squares:  plain, strawberry, raspberry and chocolate.

140779,2009-08-08,1,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"This place has its act together.  As you enter, you can see the mesquite-grilled steaks aged 21 days in the first ring.  In the center ring, you can see the chefs prepare your meal through a kitchen enclosed in glass.

The food is delicious and the portions performing plentifully.  The king crab legs were plump and expertly cut in half.  The house salad has a superb variety, with carrots carefully cross-cut for visual appeal.  The bread basket includes performances by a variety of breads, including pretzel dough.  The main performance, the filet mignon, was tasty and flavorful.  Even our cocktails--stoli on the rocks--were tremendous (the glass was filled almost to the brim--a triple instead of a single shot).

My one complaint is that the server did not properly serve the wine, which is odd in a restaurant of this caliber.  Perhaps the server underestimated a group of guys in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties in t-shirts and flip flops (the sign at the front assures guests that ""resort casual"" is OK) and thought we were young tourists not familiar with the wine service ritual.  It's fun to be an undercover foodie sometimes.  In any event, I did miss this part of the performance and this was the only bit of clowning around the whole meal.

This place deserves the spotlight.  After a standing ovation, I'm ready for an encore on my next trip back.",_6lM6tIdwGipXDApJldZyQ,0,0,5,n478XfqzNIFBIW0hcjfzAA
172230,2013-08-26,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"The Steakhouse at Circus Circus was a surprisingly good time! I typically do not like that casino but when I went to Vegas alone in May, 2013 I decided that the reviews for this place were good enough for me to give it a try. It was definitely a good decision.

Service: The service was great and I had a very attentive waiter. Not much else I can say there. I decided to hit the bar for another drink before I left and we wound up talking about the Midwest area where he and I both grew up. Nice guy!

Food: The food was awesome! I got the Prime Rib and mushrooms. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. I finished the Prime Rib but couldn't finish everything else by myself. I ordered it medium and it came medium and everything was just as I ordered.

Ambiance: This was really the only small flaw in the whole experience. The place was very dark and moody. Usually, that isn't a bad thing (like, on a date) but even then I would feel that some more natural light in the place would make it better. It was still a very comfortable experience, though, I do also wish that eating at the bar was an option. At a different steakhouse in Vegas the ambiance was awesome with leather seats, nice lighting, good balance of sound, and great food.

I would overall recommend eating here if you are in Vegas! One of the best food places I've had in a while.",uWHKUnKfjWLpRKWrKaXqfw,1,0,4,s5mOzIrTO53W6U97oKEIwA

With his nerves shattered, the ice-cold perfectly constructed martini we were served once seated was much appreciated.  As were the perfectly cooked, humongoid steaks.  I preferred his ribeye to my porterhouse - his steak was thicker and had a much better sear on it.  Both cost about $50 with salad/soup and potato included.

244531,2009-09-22,3,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"It's become tradition for me to take my assistant out to dinner on the last day of the POOL tradeshow in Las Vegas. Well, I feed and house him the entire time, but dammit, the last day is the day for a GOOD STEAK DINNER. In February we had gone to Morton's, and while it was good, the service and martini were better than the steak. 

He had mentioned in February that Circus Circus is alleged to have the best steakhouse in Vegas, which I dismissed at least 5 separate times as total hooey. How could that be? We didn't make it during that trip. So this time, being in the mood for something a little more mellow and perhaps a bit silly, I suggested Circus Circus for our end-of-show dinner. i didn't change out of my grungy breaking-down-the-booth-packing-the-fixtures clothing at all, and off we went. 

The Steak House is a class act. My helper friend took a look at the dark wood entrance and stepped to the side to tuck in his shirt and spit-shine his hair. We didn't have reservations as recommended, but they were able to seat us right away. 

As soon as you walk in you're face to face with their curing room, an awe-inspiring enclosure with entire sides of meat just dry-aging away. Gorrrgeous! The decor in general is pretty great- dark, lots of wood and taxidermy, and just what you might expect of a steakhouse in a murder mystery. 

Service was attentive and not smothering, but a little on the clueless side. He didn't know where the oysters came from, and since my friend the microbiologist recommended that I never eat oysters from the Gulf (apparently they're more likely to carry a particular strain of flesh-eating bacteria than our good old West Coast oysters) we passed. Also, when I asked him to please explain the differences between the cuts (I know what a Porterhouse and filet mignon are, but the difference between a New York strip and a regular ole strip?) he instead launched into a spiel that went like this:

""Well, for the ladies [he looked pointedly at me] I recommend the filet mignon. It's a tender cut that's low in fat. We also have a petit filet if you don't want too much. And for the gentlemen [eyes over to my companion] we recommend the New York strip. It's a flavorful cut that's very popular with the gentlemen.""

Thanks, sir. Thank you for being SO TOTALLY WRONG about how to explain cuts of steak. Annnnnyway, the New York strip sounded great to me so that's what I ordered. And apparently the filet mignon sounded great to my companion, so that's what he ordered. Well, at first he ordered the petit filet, but I reminded him that he has a wooden leg and would not be satisfied with the lighter lady's meal. 

My steak was EXCELLENT. Rare, flavorful, perfect. The martini was pretty stellar as well. My companion's steak was initially a disappointment to him because it wasn't as flavorful as mine (and this is at the heart of why I only like filet mignon at home when you get to marinate it to your exact specifications. It's a tender bitch, but not as flavorful since it doesn't have the same fat content. FAT IS FLAVOR.) but he grew to kind of love it. And, I have to say, it was miles ahead of the Morton's filet mignon because it was delicously dry-aged. Companion thought it was a little gamey, but I thought it was kind of excellent. 

All the other little details about the dinner were excellent as well, right down to their bread and butter. How great is that?

The steak was on the fatty side and was too charred for my taste but still rare on the inside -- very good but not as great as expected for $58.

This really is a diamond in the rough (the rough being Circus Circus). 

The inside of this place was very rustic, almost as if i was in an upscale steakhouse of the 20's. The place was very clean and simplistic. I appreciate this because so many places now are crammed with crap. 

The wait staff was very soft spoken and attentive, i like the calm approach rather then then crazy loud ""fun"" approach at some chain restaurants. 

Steak was perfect, no complaints about the food. It had real flavor and didn't need any extras which in my opinion is a sign of quality.

Went here for dinner tonight with my boyfriend because he's been wanting to come back here after eating ""the best steak in Vegas"" several years ago. Its still on point! 
Loved the warm breads that were served immediately after seating and taking drink orders. Steaks come with chef's vegetable which was asparagus, soup or salad, and mashed garlic or baked potato. I got the special of the evening which was the 8oz filet for $30 and accompaniments of grilled garlic shrimp and sauteed mushrooms. 
My boyfriend got the bone in ribeye with added lobster tail. 
Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly! I also liked how the garlic butter for my grilled shrimp had bits of roasted garlic in clarified butter and was kept warm by a candle underneath. My shrimp were huge! More like prawns than shrimp...the lobster tail was also a very nice size. 
After the main course we were too full to order dessert, but the dessert cart looked very tempting.
The only con I would have to add is that I wish they had more appetizer selections and more vegetable sides a la carte besides the chef vegetable.

614683,2014-12-25,1,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Wow... where to begin.  The seafood sampler appetizer was truly horrible.   I have no idea what breed of oysters they use but what little flavor they had was odd... not off, just odd.  Don't let them tell you there are 4 crab legs... there are 2 single sections cut in half (for 4 pieces) and they are old and meal-y.  The shrimp were large but also pretty flavorles and obviously not Black Tigers.

I will say on the plus side, their house made blue cheese dressing was passable and the lettuce wedge was crisp and freshly cut.

The negative comments regarding unseasoned meat are correct, but I prefer that personally.  Proper aging gives all the flavor you would need but sadly (regardless of the aging room prominently displayed as you walk in), this meat is barely aged.  I would suggest they clean their grills, though, as the char marks had a bad flavor to them that detracted from the overall flavor instead of enhancing it.

Service was good (the only reason they got 2 stars instead if 1) although no one inquired as to why we allowed the seafood to be cleared having barely been touched.  At $61 and the highest priced single item on the menu I would have thought there would have been at least a little curiosity... unless they know in advance that it is sub-par and just count on the lack of sophistication of most guests to get them by, of course.

I don't care what kind of awards they've won, this is a place to avoid.   If you want a GOOD traditional steakhouse experience in Las Vegas go to the Golden Steer.",j9RaXGUB6umHgqHfcQubrw,3,0,2,JjdIM5tIWZTyIlO03jhmMQ

We had reservations for five people and were promptly seated at a table that should have been used by four even though there were empty tables around the place.  The service was fine and I cannot fault the wait staff in any way.  

We started with drinks of course, Makers on the rocks. For twelve dollars in a town that throws alcohol at you, you would expect a decent pour.  The drinks were heavy on the ice and very light on the Makers Mark.  I have had more generous pours while playing nickel slots. 

The big disappointment was the steak. Four of the five had us had steak, mine was a bone in rib eye which while cooked correctly, medium rare, was dry and tough.  All of the steak eaters at the table had similar experiences and two were served cold mashed potatoes. 

As a group, we didn't discuss our impressions of the meal until after leaving the table.  We all thought that our experiences and concerns were unique and did not want to ruin anyone else's dinner by complaining, but after leaving we compared notes. At that point, one member of the party returned to speak to the management.  To be honest they did not seem that concerned.

It was busy that night and we're lucky to get last minute reservation especially during new years eve.  The person making reservation was friendly, courteous and accomodating.  
Food portion is good. Me and my wife ordered Rib Eye and Porterhouse steak, and it was enough for us and our 2 kids. 
The warm bread and butter they serve was good, even the water they served tasted really good, its funny cause both kids commented how good the water was :)   It cost about 40-45 bucks per entree and includes salad and a side order, which I think is reasonable for the size and quality of their steak.  The steak is good and the side order is so-so. Ruth-Chris is better, but of course it cost more and you would have to pony up 10-15 bucks more per side order.",6NTtivZxU8WfK7A90pMJPg,0,0,4,PvdTn4B5_-nETW9gFQp1_g

My advice would be to spend a couple bucks on cabfare and go to Golden Steer.  Their ribeye is the best I've had in Vegas.",NmygL6zSMEvDM3Y9dS5cyw,0,0,2,YjPoIKp4n_SPu2lzEcieAA

Because we had about 8 of us the service was horrendous since they knew the tip would have been automatically applied.

The garlic mashed potatoes and desserts were still pretty good, but seeing that I hate Circus Circus already, this gives us another reason why we would never set food in this place again.",H1fcbC-WKsbiEo8BBVkHwA,1,1,1,QxbhdTGfZSPDBVZaHisHkg

I was able to sneak in around 7 pm with a 15 minute wait.  Service was very attentive.  They serve bottled Arrowhead water as your drinking water.  I ordered the Oysters on the Half-shell, Rib-eye steak, and had my soup that came with the steak upgraded to the French Onion Soup.

Oysters on the Half-Shell - Terrible.  The presentation was fine, and oysters were separated from the shell and cleaned well.  I tasted no grit, but they were very bitter.  I'm not an oyster connoisseur, but I've never had bitter oysters before and I certainly didn't enjoy them.

French Onion Soup - Tasty.  The cheese stayed melted throughout the entire time I was eating the soup which surprised me because a lot of the times, the cheese just congeals.  I enjoyed the soup thoroughly.  It wasn't too salty and was full-flavored.  I would probably get this again if I had to come back.

Rib-eye Steak - This was way under-seasoned and there was a lot of char on the steak to the point where all I tasted was burnt crust in some of the bites.  The parts that weren't burnt, I had to add a lot of salt for some flavor.  I find it really sad that a steakhouse charging these prices cannot cook a proper steak.  I was incredibly disappointed because I wasn't able to go here the last time I was in Vegas and made it a point to make an outside trip to come here this time around.  I was sorry I did.  The sides weren't too bad.  I had the garlic mashed potatoes, which were actually pretty good and the best thing on the entree plate.  The veggies were nothing to write home about.

Service is very helpful and attentive, but food-wise, this failed miserably.  Overall, I would not come back, and if anyone in my group suggested it, I'd probably nix the idea right away.",jNoaiG2OYsGaOvT7dPanTw,0,0,1,_W62gOjL-J1ktatXitGsmQ

We had them split the Filet and New York Strip and had no issues when it was brought to the table. We ordered both steaks medium rare. The Filet was the 12oz thick cut and slightly on the rare side. The New York was slightly on the medium side and was not consistent as they left it on one side a little longer in the cooking process. We did not complain to our server as we tried both cuts and they were enjoyable, I do have to say they could use some extra seasoning (had to add salt which I had never done to a steak after it was cooked). If it was just for the way the steaks were cooked it was a border line 3 stars. Three things made me give this place 4 stars. 1) I love black been soup and I was served the best black been soup I have ever tasted. 2) The bake potato was on point, the skin was cooked (and seasoned perfect). 3) The price point, even though the steaks were not cooked perfectly they were tasty enough that we did not have to send back.

So all things aside let's get to the food. We ordered the salad .famous bean soup ribeye dinner and  filet mignon dinner. Salad hardly had lettuce but the  blue cheese and vinaigrette dressing was good. Your famous bean soup just tasted like ordinary black beans in a can... The steaks were nothing special I don't see how it so post to be award winning the steaks were very bland  steaks were not season what so ever before cooking on the grill no salt no black pepper no garlic etc. As soon as I took a bite out of the stake I knew something was wrong to my amusement it was not season so I grabbed a salt shaker on the table and they filled it so it not want to come out .so I did not want to go to the hassle of opening it and all that stuff when the stake should of been season from the beginning. Steaks were a decent size but they were tasteless. On to the service our waiter was not professional at all seemed like he kept rushing us . He did not refill our drinks we had to ask for a refill at the very end of our dinner. I don't think that's right that we have to ask for a refill  at a fancy steak restaurant.

The oysters weren't shuxked and had a lot of broken shell. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much by ordering seafood at a steakhouse. I thought well, this is a nicer establishment and they should have good quality stuff. Oops.

I have to admit, was a bit skeptical when I heard it was at Circus Circus, but hey, I'm game and it's won best steakhouse for 2 decades. Two decades. That's quite some time, yeah?

Word of advice. Don't get all dolled up when you go to this place as you will feel very awkward. I was all decked out in a mini black dress and high heels because we were going to head over to Prive afterwards. Wished that I had on flip flops and some casual attire. So out of place. 

With that aside, I ordered the rib eye {bone in} with baked potato, house salad with ranch dressing and the cheesecake + banana foster for dessert. Later on why I ordered two desserts. 

The bread basket was good. It was filled with an assortment of breads and they were warm! Hence, the added star. Seriously. 

Salad was eh. Thought some of the lettuce was a bit wilted. Nothing really to talk about. The steak felt charred and there was really no taste whatsoever. It wasn't even that tender, either. The cheesecake tasted as though it's been in the refrigerator for AGES. However, the banana foster quickly made up for it as it was muy deliciso. I highly recommend this dessert! 

 I was secretly hoping that this place was going to win me over and take the place of Ruthchris's or Morton's. Sadly, it didn't and it was a huge disappointment. The prices are really reasonable {for a steakhouse}. My rib eye was $44 and it included a salad, and a baked potato. No a la carte menu here. 

Probably wouldn't want to return here, unfortunately. Although, if you are a big prime rib eater, my eating companions  say that they prime rib tasted much better than the steak.",a8J7bEA14JWPQ7KFjEEvYA,0,1,3,HfPmW2R6gvxgnh1pU2nogQ

(However, it's probably no more nasty than the rest of Circus Circus which you are forced to walk through to get to this place).  Second, the service is slow and, when they do show up at your table, often rude.  Third, the steaks are third rate at best.  If you are wondering what select grade meat tastes like go here.  Their ribeyes range from bland to so full of hard gristle that they are practically inedible.  I don't even want to get into their disgusting side dishes and salads. Finally, to top off this great experience you will pay top dollar for a steak that Outback would be too ashamed to serve.

HOWEVER. Nestled in a dark corner past the dirty casino, dollar blackjack, and screaming kids is a doorway that leads back through time. THE Steak House at Circus Circus is a local legend, a true hidden gem known only to Vegas insiders and locals. When I say the restaurant is a time machine, I mean it. The Rat Pack could easily have haunted it at one point; indeed, it's the sort of place Don Draper and Roger Sterling would frequent. If you're a Mad Men fan, I don't think I need to say any more. But I will. 

The waitstaff are seasoned professionals that will attend to your every need. They are happy to make a recommendation from the extensive wine list, and never need any further guidance upon hearing the words, ""rye old fashioned."" I wasn't even able to finish half my glass of water before it was refilled. 

The menu is simple, as it should be. Traditional steakhouse fare. For around $50 (give or take), you'll get a superb cut of aged midwestern beef, cooked to perfection, served with a salad or soup, potato, and vegetable. I'm picky when it comes to steak, and every meal I've had at THE Steak House has been fantastic. My personal favorite is the ribeye, but they make a great filet as well. A friend of mine enjoys the lobster. I've never had dessert, although I have ordered coffee after the meal and it is very good.

The steak was very tender and prepared wonderfully and I think this was the best jumbo grilled shrimp that I have had.  We have been coming here for over 17 years and they never disappoint.

And the menu was excellent.  The bread basket had a nice variety of breads.  I had king crab legs on ice for an appetizer.  They were by far the best crab legs that I've ever had.

I'm not the biggest fan of Circus Circus and I generally avoid going there, so when I read that one of the best Steakhouses in Las Vegas was located inside, I was skeptical to say the least.

They absolutely defied my expectations.  The service was excellent and we were seated promptly for our 5PM reservation (after a brief tour, which was basically telling us what things were as we passed them)

The better half and I enjoyed the Pretzel Rolls that came with the bread, but admittedly, I think we are both Pretzel Roll addicts. 

I had the Spinach Salad (With Bacon Dressing) and was not disappointed. 

For the Entree it was the Fillet Oscar with a Baked Potato.  I don't know what the deal with this Baked Potato was, but it was one of the best I'd ever had.  The Steak was prepared perfectly to my tastes and was also delicious with the Crab Meat and Bearnaise. I never wanted it to end, but my stomach had other plans.

For dessert the Raspberry Cake, which might have ended up being a bit much for my belt, but it sure was good!

The price was undoubtedly on the high side, especially considering it is INSIDE Circus Circus, but it is Vegas, and I knew what I was getting into.

I guess my only real complaint was that it felt like it was a bit on the dark side.  I'm all for Ambiance, but I really felt like I needed to start using my phone as a flashlight!

- Steaks

BUZZ
- Prime Rib

I TRIED
- French Onion Soup (7/10)
- Bone In Rib Eye (2/10)
- Sauteed Mushrooms (5/10)

I was once on a flight and saw that someone had left a Robb Report magazine in seat back pocket. I flipped through it and saw it had listed the 7 best steakhouses in Vegas, and I was astonished when it even mentioned Circus Circus. I mean, what is actually redeemable from that decrepit place? I read on to find out it actually won some kind of award saying it's the best steakhouse in all of Vegas. Wait... WHAT? Come again? Circus Circus...THE Circus Circus? The Circus Circus that's way off the strip, and has thousands of smelly kids (and adults) swarming and mobbing all over the lobby, the taxi lines, and hallways? THAT Circus Circus has the best steak? No F-ing Way! For a few years, I've been wanting to go, but probably in the 5 times I've been to Vegas since reading that article, nobody wanted to go. This time, I finally got the chance!

The menu is very simple. They have quite a few seafood options like crab legs, oysters, lobster tail, etc., but at a place called ""The Steakhouse,"" I feel like those are sort of obligatory menu items. No idea how they taste. Pretty much the menu is STEAK, and very few appetizer and side offerings. Asparagus? No. Creamed spinach or corn? Nope. Mac & Cheese? Psh! As if! They got seafood accompaniments and sauteed mushrooms. Period. So...pretty limited choices.

All the steaks I've had in Vegas have been decent, but not all that great. I'd prefer Morton's to SW, Carenvino, Delmonico, Cut, GR Steak, and I'm sure I'm missing a couple others. I was actually hoping Circus Circus wasn't good, because if it was good, that means we may need to make trips out this way to have steak from now on. Well..

FRENCH ONION SOUP
Not my normal appetizer, but considering the limited choices, the only one that made sense. It was pretty decent. Presentation was kinda cool, bowl served on a plate with some extra croutons and cheese shreds in cute little heaps. Seasoned well, onions were cooked well. It was probably what I'd call textbook French Onion Soup. It was good, but nothing really made it unique or special. It was just good French Onion Soup.

RIBEYE
Here goes. It's presented ok. The cost of the steak comes with your choice of potato. The steak looked healthy - decent spots of char all over. I start cutting a piece, and ended up finding that about 30% of my piece was fat. The fat is the most seasoned part of the steak, and also pretty delicious. Normally I cut it off, but hey, Vegas! It's the most seasoned part of the steak, so this bite should have been stellar...but...no. In fact, there was hardly any seasoning at all!

You couldn't even fathom my disappointment! If there was any kind of special mesquite flavoring, I didn't find it. The meat was decently tender, and I can't really complain about any of its technical aspects (i.e. medium rare was just as I asked), but the taste was just so BORING! Nothing inspiring, nothing savory, nothing...good! It was bad! I mean, there was nothing going on with this! It's not like ""no news is good news."" With steak, ""no news is the worst possible news!"" I had to restrain myself from asking for A1, but I did end up sprinkling some salt on it. It did make it taste better but anytime you add salt after the fact, it doesn't taste right. I was so disappointed I probably left 1/3 of it. I was taking scoops of mashed potatoes with each steak bite, to try to add seasoning somehow. I tried everything. Nothing worked. It just gave up!

It was a pretty bad steak...not the worst I've ever had, but definitely the worst $50 steak I've ever had. 

MUSHROOMS
Well, certainly better than the steak, and while tasting halfway decent, it wasn't anything special. If I went to TGI Friday's or Outback or Chili's and got this batch of sauteed mushrooms, I'd have found it fitting, but if I paid $7 for them (and it was a pretty small batch), I'd like something with a little more creativity! 

INDIANA JONES & THE STEAKHOUSE OF DOOM
I was really, really upset! I mean, even though it was free (company paid), which should make it taste even better, I couldn't believe what a waste of money this place was. Considering the $20-$30 roundtrip cab ride and having to swim through a roaring (and smelly) sea of children and parents for about a mile (exaggerating), there's more at ""steak"" here (see what I did there?). 

Either A) the reviewers were all full of sh*t, or B) We got the C- cooks, because I can't imagine how an establishment like this could have gotten high marks anywhere. 

Thankfully, I now know, I don't EVER have to go to Circus Circus again! If you're a curious person like me, then you probably do need to go here, just to say that you've tried it and conquered it. Otherwise, if you're solely on a mission to try actually good food. Skip this place!",4dk6ki0f4GKpgzAqdupOvw,4,0,2,WxwWEN30tJU_fpCFhhwItA

In addition, there is no way that steak was a prime cut and I question if it was even a choice. No tenderness and lacked flavor telling me that there was a lack of fat throughout the steak.

We just left The Steakhouse and I would like to say that it far exceeded my expectations.
It is dimly lit but very elegant. From the moment you walk in, you can tell you will be in for a treat.
First we were served a basket filled with different types of bread and butter. My favorite were the raisin bread but they were all delicious.

The first course was black bean soup however, you can choose a salad if you don't want the soup. It was absolutely delicious.
I ordered the chicken breast..it comes perfectly grilled, well seasoned and very tender. It came with grilled asparagus and a baked potato. You can get mashed potatoes too.
I read a review below stating the meat was under seasoned, I disagree with that review. Why would the chef ruin a fine cut of meat by over salting it and ruining the natural flavor? I think the meat tasted delicious and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper.

My daughter got the rib eye steak..I wish I had taken a photo of it, it was spectacular.

The server was very polite and and took care of us good. Service is exceptional.
A tray of delicious deserts were offered to us after our meal however, we were stuffed.
The options were chocolate covered strawberries, cheesecake and a whole tray full of delicious options.

Baked potato could use some improvement. The bacon tasted stale like it was taken off the buffet the day before.  They offered a few toppings but cheese was definitely missing.

The only thing that saved the evening was the excellent service.  It was like we had two waiters and we were treated very well.  Oh, and also the bread saved the day.  That was some good bread.  The steakhouse would do better selling bread rather than steaks.

We had a filet mignon and two porterhouse steaks.

The filet was serviceable but nothing special.

The porterhouse steaks looked impressive, but also had an odd butterfly look, and were quite thin on the strip side. We had ordered medium rare for both, but the filet side showed up as medium or more, and the strip side was medium/well-done.

Both steaks had a lot of hard internal fat, and seemed entirely without flavor. Overall they seemed like the kind of random steaks you might pick up at a supermarket you haven't been to before. Not even close to Prime quality. This was Select at best.

Service was slow, disinterested, but polite. We asked for some sauces, thinking they must have some nice sauces to help the steaks. The waiter said sure and returned with steak sauce and hot sauce bottles. I see now after the visit that they have pepper corn and cheddar cheese (?) sauces ""available upon request"". Well, we did in fact request sauces for the steaks. Had I known this at the time, I would have called the manager for an explanation. I mean, why are we paying north of $200 for bad steaks and industrial steak sauce, like we were in some dingy dinner?

I have only once in my life returned a food order. I prefer to just not come back, and avoid making a fuss. However, this time, literally feeling unwell after ingesting overdone subpar meat mixed with hard gelatinous fatty stuff, I did severely regret not sending it all back to the kitchen.

Not sure what happened here. Perhaps our waiter took an immediate dislike to our small party, which included a young child, and sent us the worst steaks he could find in inventory.

However, other reviews mention flavorless steaks.

In short, the Steak House needs to seriously rethink their approach to being a steak house. In the meantime, I would avoid at all cost.",tWJf3CSIUXu5gga-Bjpapg,0,0,1,V4UOJlbrsAEnpNWH2pq4kA

When my husband wanted to try the ""Circus Circus Steakhouse"", I told him he must be crazy. I'm way too prissy to eat at Circus-Circus. But, I took one for the team, and I sure was glad! Now, we eat here almost every time we go to Vegas!
Yes, you will pay $50 for your meal. But, unlike other expensive steakhouses, your dish will come with a salad, a vegetable and a starch--I suggest the baked potato with all the fixin's. Most other steakhouses are a la carte, and once you add in the salad and sides, your $50 dish has become a $75 dish. So the value is there.

I will say that if you like a broiled steak, you may not enjoy the ""charred"" flavor on their steaks. It's not a burnt flavor, it's just different than a broiled steak. I actually prefer their crab legs over the steaks. You get a HUGE plate of King crab legs, and they come completely split in half length-wise, so the meat is ready for you.
A variety of breads are brought to your table and they are all amazing! The waiters are all super-friendly and my water glass never got more than half-empty.

I ordered the steak and lobster.  The steak was fine but as I said not amazing.  

Now lobster is even more important.  Lobster is pricey, and I understand and accept that.  It's expensive because every bite you take is like an orgasm in your mouth, or should be.  

The lobster here was overcooked and on the chewy side.  In retrospect I should have sent it back, but I have a rule. Never, send food back.  Life's too short... and I know too many people in the food industry.",91ECzjsMpfl7-40m7AcDFw,0,0,2,lG65b-7BKOJ3LmDd-LsPBg
1491547,2007-04-04,1,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Wow, like anyone and everyone should/would/could agree...who would think that such a great steakhouse would be in Circus Circus of all places.  Yes like sleepy t. wrote, don't let the location deceive you...this is definitely a 5 star steak house right up there with the top of all Prime steakhouses yet it is in Circus Circus.  This works to your adv. and disadv. Adv - It's kind've like that secret gold mine no one knows about, not full of really annoying people, and much easier to get reservations and better prices. DIsadv - Hard to convince a group to come there and/or tell people about the place without getting weird looks. 
  But if you've been to the circus circus steakhouse..you'll know straight up it's no joke. The 21 day aged PRIME steak is delicious, and priced very fair. In fact a bargain compared to places like SW steakhouse at the Wynn. When it comes to PRIME steak not many places differ, they all grill to perfection, and add salt and pepper. Really the only way they differ is...atmosphere, price, service, wine list, and sides.  The atmosphere at The Steakhouse is very comfortable, elegant and ritzy (unlike the family-oriented casino), the price is top-notch for a PRIME steak house (but of course not dirt cheap by any means), the service was great, and the sides...well they weren't the best i've had, but they had all the basics down to accompany a steak properly. ANd lastly the Wine List what of an appropriate size and price to accompany great PRIME steaks as well.
  I am sad to hear that Circus Circus may be torn down in the future, I mean there needs to be some aspect of family left in Vegas. But mostly because the hidden jewel that is THE STEAKHOUSE at circus circus would go down with  it. In regards to overall value for what you get regarding Steakhouse in Vegas...you can't beat the Steakhouse at Circus Circus...otherwise you're just another goon..who believes the only way to get a good steak is paying $100 for a 12 ounce steak...and in that case you're not a real meat eater and do not deserve to eat PRIME.

First, don't let the fact that they are inside Circus Circus discourage you from going. You have to think, they have been in business for so many years that Circus Circus was probably different at the time they opened. Now it is rundown and doesn't have a great reputation but the restaurant isn't too far into the casino. I actually enjoy stopping at the little gift shops on the way!

When you walk in, it's dark and kind of a time warp, which I love. Vintage Vegas! You can see into a meat cooler (I think that is what you would call it) when you're walking to your seat, which could be cool to some. Depending on where you sit, you might even pass a part where you can see chefs cooking.

Both times I ate here, it was very good. One thing that stands out is the french onion soup. They give you all the toppings on the side, so you can add more as you eat it. I love that! I usually only eat French onion soup until the cheese is gone, so this way you can keep eating. It was delicious! The shrimp I got with my steak was also very good. They are big too!

The service has always been great here. Even when you're greeted at the front, they are super attentive. The second time I was there, we were waiting for a minute (no one was at the front) and when the host came back, he apologized and said we should not have been kept waiting. We really didn't mind, it was only a minute. The fact that he apologized was very nice though.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,33,25,5,NfRWH4V9_TU0HAMSXw0Bow

1547563,2016-01-15,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"After reading the great reviews and hearing about it from others, I booked reservations here instead of the newer, trendier steak houses in Vegas for 7pm on a slow Monday night.  I was looking forward to one of the best steaks I've ever had, maybe I got my expectations up too high?  

First off, upon walking in I read on the podium the dress code was ""smart casual"", Yelp says casual...I was definitely casual and worried we were under-dressed.  After glancing at the others around the restaurant, I definitely was dressed smarter-casual than many others.  Maybe it was smart casual in the 1980's?

Next, the wine list.  I like drinking Pinot Noir with my steak.  A quick glance showed around eight choices of red by the glass, I believe it was all California wines and not a single Pinot Noir.  I settled for a Cab Sav and she had a Merlot, they were both fine and both were the cheapest wine by the glass at $8.

I ordered the Rib-Eye medium rare and she had the NY Strip medium.  I had the mashed potatoes and salad and she had the wild rice and salad.  Both came with asparagus (though the menu didn't mention any vegetable).  The salads came and both were excellent.  Steaks came out 6-8 minutes after we finished salads which was great as I knew they would be hot off the grill.  Mine was cooked medium rare but seemed overly charred on the outside, but it may have been just the large fat trimmings.  Hers was more medium rare than mine but she didn't send it back.

The problem with both steaks was the dryness and total lack of flavor.  A good steak cooked to perfection you should be able to cut with a butter knife, these two $60 steaks, not a chance.  I was very disappointed.  I didn't want to insult the chef and ask for steak sauce, so we added a little salt and pepper, it didn't help.  Maybe it was an off night for us?  

The side items were fine and service was excellent to be expected, water was recharged often.  Though sometimes the server filling the water glasses would get too carried away pulling the water bottle up and down as if doing a magic trick and water would bounce onto the salad or dinner plate...stop the gimmicks and just pour my water please?  

Dessert was tiramisu which was outstanding.  The check was $155 with tip, $185.  I've had much better two steak dinners well under $100.  Sorry Circus Circus, I won't be back.",EJGlI1w2zghaBXjyk29iUw,0,0,3,YAl8Po_4B7SxKA6qAegbww

Is the food as good as what you would get at a top tier steakhouse? No. But it's good enough that you probably won't mind. The prices for steak are basically the same as the prices at a top tier steakhouse, but they come with potato and vegetable which can easily add about $20 your meal at the other places. So it's a fantastic value and it's a darned good steak!

Very friendly and attentive service. Good menu selections. I had the New York Strip and my wife ordered the Porterhouse, my steak was excellent but as soon as I tasted her Porterhouse I had buyer's remorse. Just stick with the Porterhouse! It was so tender that it was hard to tell the difference between the sirloin and the tenderloin! I appreciate that they serve NORMAL sized veggies instead of the steroid-grown veggies they serve at the fancier steakhouses, they have a lot more flavor.

We really enjoyed the open kitchen/grill area in the middle of the restaurant where we could watch the steaks being cooked. Just be aware that when you leave, you're going to smell like you've been standing over a charcoal grill in your backyard.

The steak wasn't horrible but it didn't do much for me, no flavor really. They need to season it differently or maybe start seasoning them if they don't at all.

I found this place reading reviews on some other restaurants on the strip, I assumed the first couple were just people who got paid to make positive reviews, but I read on. Everyone is right, this is where all the locals go, and for good reason.
I made reservations with my wife on a Thursday evening and I would definitely recommend the reservations. The first thing you get is the bread. I think they give you 6 different kinds of breads all in one basket, so good. We started out with the sauteed mushrooms, a great choice. At $9, it's the cheapest thing on the menu and boy is it worth it. They split it up for us without us even asking and the mushrooms filled 2 bowls. Honestly, they could've been a meal in itself. I ordered the bone-in rib eye medium rare and my wife ordered the filet the same. At the time, they were running an anniversary special and the filet was only $39 instead of the usual $51. The sides that come with the steaks were huge. In fact, the next time I go I'll be sharing the rib eye with my wife and paying the $10 shared plate fee to get the extra sides. 
Their wine selection is great as well.
The only downside is it's in circus circus, so that means you have to park and walk through a terrible hotel, I'm sure there's a valet you could use in the front, I just didn't use it. Either way, it wouldn't be fair to detract from the restaurant's rating.

Location: Inside Circus Circus Casino. Getting here is something else. After you get past having to go through the parking garage from hell and avoid getting rundown by rugrats heading to Adventuredome, you'll step through the doors of ""The Steak House"" and breathe a sigh of relief.

Your hostess will take you past the area where they dry age the steaks. Here's it's 21 days we were told.  You'll go past the exhibition area also where they grill the steaks. Smells so good!
 
Menu is simple.http://circuscircus.com/images/PDF/SteakhouseMenu.pdf

We all ordered different cuts of steak and our dinners included fresh baked bread, Chef choice of vegetable (asparagus) black bean soup or salad, garlic mash,baked potato or rice.

Very enjoyable dinner. We ordered desserts though and had coffee and drinks afterwards. We probably stuck around longer than we should. Bff & I are notorious for it. We were never rushed  and our servers kept checking up on us even after we were finished with dinner.

I gave thought so many times should I or should I not go for a visit...and well, I read so many reviews on Yelp, and decided what the heck--it won't hurt to take my friends out for dinner there. 

So this was our third day in Vegas, and we had just completed an adventurous part of the day earlier that afternoon--found a fedora hat for our friend's wedding ceremony, went to the Gun Store to go shoot some machine guns, and now, it was time to get back to the hotel to savor some great food, as I was highly expecting of.

Got dressed up to the dinner, even though yes, it is at the Circus Circus.  It's one of those occasions you just don't want to dress down, and even though Vegas is quite acceptable with any type of attire, clubbing and formal dinners should be dressed to the nines, in my opinion.

We got dressed quickly, and drove out to Circus Circus.  Quite honestly, it used to be a dump, and it hasn't changed much~!  Well, parking wasn't so bad; easier than what I was expecting of.  As we walked into the casino area, the hotel really shows its age, however at the same time, it bought back a lot of memories from when I was a child, when my parents brought me there to play in the arcade, and watch the circus show.

The Steakhouse is hidden in this little area in the middle of the shopping galley, and as soon as you walk into the restaurant, the vibe is very classy Vegas-style.

We were welcomed by the restaurant's manager, Ron, who was very cordial, and friendly.  Because the manager and my client from work are great friends, we received even greater, and exceptional service.  Sat down at the booth, and the bread came.  Wow~!! It's ridiculously delicious.  We were offered bottle of wine, though we opted because we didn't want to get hammered.  Instead, we proceeded to order from the menu.  

My two friends ordered the Porterhouse steak, while I ordered the prime rib.  Talk about portions--wow--it's huge!  My meal came with rice pilaf, and vegetables.  Trust me--I was barely able to finish my dinner.  The prime rib meat was so tender--and the light sauce was just right--not too rich, nor too salty.  It was beyond delicious, and for this dinner, I wasn't looking to dine out all big and fancy on the strip.  I really wanted something genuinely delicious, and this place hit the spot.  Besides the food, the service is just phenomenal.  I'd have to say the service is quite etiquette to the nines.  

I left this restaurant thinking that it was by far the best meal I've ever had in Vegas.  You definitely get for what you paid, and because it was my friend's bachelor party, I picked up the tab, but no dollar amount should be compared to the food that's served here--it was just so well worth it.  Trust me--I've been to Vegas more than you can count, and yes, by far, this place is now on the top of my list!

1789923,2015-02-20,1,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"I first learned about this place in this old ""Little Black Book"" by David de Montmollin.  Basically an amusing read on a Vegas insider's recommendation for the ultimate Vegas weekend.  Circus Circus is not a casino one would think of going to these days, given the rise of the upscale Wynn, City Center, and Bellagio.  However, it has two nice features - a half-price ticket booth that's not super busy and a phenomenal steakhouse.

The steakhouse has an aging room where you see various cuts of meat and a central kitchen open area where they cook meats on a charcoal grill.  The inside is dark, intimate and classy - but you can wear business casual.  Waiters were super friendly.  The red leather booths we had were really comfortable as well.

Our dinner was excellent - everything cooked well and full of flavor.  Portions were truly massive so I would recommend sharing an entree. The wife and I both got bone-in ribeyes which had a nice smoky crust followed by a tender interior.  Their peppercorn sauce is like a spicy gravy that made the dish even better.  We also got black bean soup which had sides of diced red onions and sherry - very unique flavor but I really liked it.  For dessert, we shared the banana foster which came in a nice martini glass - not a whole lot of alcohol, but real fresh bananas and the ice cream had good layering of caramel.

I do recommend this restaurant - pretty good value.  Even though its $59 for a huge bone-in ribeye, it comes with your choice of starch (rice pilaf, garlic mash, baked potato), asparagus, and choice of salad or black bean soup.  Be sure to ask for peppercorn sauce on the aide and save room for dessert!",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,7,1,4,NiNCvnqeSsMdaE7671NWjQ
1793869,2015-11-10,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"I deducted one star because the breads in the bread basket were old and cold. I don't mean not hot, I mean COLD as in just came out of the fridge/defrosted from the freezer. Such a bummer, because that is the first impression of a steakhouse. The bread sticks were good though. Mark up on wine was quite high, but our server Chae was wonderful.

I deducted another star because I was shocked to learn that a restaurant located in Circus Circus does not have non glass cups, or at least a lid to put on the glass cup for kids. The lack of a kids' menu (while strange for a restaurant located feet away from juggling clowns) we were okay with--I get it, you don't want this turning into a Rainforest Cafe.

But come on folks, this is just a plain safety and liability issue. A kid could hurt himself if the glass shatters (which will happen if it's dropped). Not to mention, the pain of dealing with a dumped drink over the kids clothes (glad did not happen to us) especially since you'll no doubt get a bunch of diners who are tourists and are limited to what they can pack in a diaper bag for a dinner. You have to expect kids will dine there because your are located in CIRCUS CIRCUS. Know your audience and provide parents with a more pleasant experience. I would not even take my kids to the steakhouses at fancy hotels.

We split a chicken entree for our kids. Thankfully, we were not charged the $17 split fee (I would have lost my mind if they had done that for a 2 and 5 year old). 

Look, this restaurant is free to have any rule it wants. What made this hard to swallow is the fact that they don't seem to enforce other rules. Their sign clearly says ""no tank tops"". Yet, a man at the table next to us was wearing a tank top. 

So someone dining at your steakhouse in a wife beater in violation of your rules is okay, but a kids' cup is beneath you?????!!!!! 

Interesting that another Yelper made a comment about people dining there in tank tops, and in violation of the restaurant's rules.

Normally I would deduct another star because the beef is not prime, but they charge prime prices. Here, they dry age non-prime beef. However, I did not deduct the other star because the food was good, and our server was great.",Wbjfjb0H6lptfWVYfax8tg,0,0,3,pNW3S2f9Ig-RNdsBNdV3eg

They taste, or lack there of, frozen. The steaks however, petite filet and NY Strip, were cooked a perfect medium rare. Full of bloody flavor, and the mashed potatoes werent too bad either. We ended the night with the raspberry chocolate cake which wasnt all that great.

This is old school Vegas and I love it.  It's dark and looks like a mob hit can breakout at any table... I love it.  

I told my old man there on Father's Day where this place turned 32 years old so they had some great specials.  I got a $32 birthday special; a petite filet mignon (8oz) with sides included.  My dad got the Father's Day special for $53 which included a Ribeye, salad, dessert.

This wasn't just an 8oz filet I had.  8oz always concerns me, usually places say 10oz or 12oz and it looks smaller.  There's no way this was 8oz... and that's a good thing.  It looked a lot bigger.  Tasted amazing - perfectly cooked medium-rare.

Also, when it's not a special, their prices include sides and that's key.  You might think, ""Well, their steaks are in the mid $40-range, why would I go here and no somewhere else?""  Those places then offer sides starting around $12 each... two sides, tack on an extra $24.  Not here.  

The service was spot-on, which I always appreciate.

Top notch place.  Yes, the Circus Circus thing is a huge deterrent, especially if it's for a date, walking through the lobster-tanned zombies crawling through the casino but once you get through that... it's great.",vXSw50X6SurDHp8MpOSvjw,5,3,5,Gcd045N0CPVfw4ZNGPMyAw

Or, at least, it's supposed to be good.

The menu is short, the ambiance reminds me of The Golden Steer on Sahara and the Strip:  old-school, dimly lit, very retro and stodgy/classy.

The food is really very average, but with well above-average prices.  The biggest issues I had with my food were, A) dry steak with little flavor, and B) the sides and appetizers were incredibly average.

Normal salad, normal baked potato, normal to below-average seafood.  It's decidely average, or 3 stars, but with the prices the way they are, it becomes a 2.  It's just fiercely skippable.

1919064,2012-10-18,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"What's there to like about Circus Circus? THE Steak House, of course. Atmosphere and food! If you're searching for the true feel of an old school Las Vegas steak house, look no further. Yeah, the BigTop could use a lot more than just some fresh paint (think wrecking ball) but its old and does not try to hide the fact when compared to the plethora of fancier addresses on the Strip.Think of it as a history field trip and enjoy it while its still around!

If you like the social scene of a loud, trendy, expensive, restaurant that will remind you of your favorite campout in LA or NYC, this is not for you! If you're a social climber, who needs to hang out in hopes of seeing stars, then head South on Las Vegas Blvd.

But if you're willing to travel to this part of town (and by the way, its not as unsafe as you might think), look past the faded paint, chipped concrete, and are willing to have the driver wait for you outside the Circus, you will find a real diamond in the rough here! Cabs are cheaper than car services (bus even cheaper), and walking can be a real cultural experience! Weave thru the older casino, past the circus acts to the dimly lit entrance where you'll be greeted by a view of the dry aging room. Pass the hostess, bar, and open kitchen on the way to your table, which might just be one of the genuine studded naugahyde booths. Very much what I always pictured be an old school Vegas steak house to be like!

Nice servers like Michael Champeaux who has been there for 26 years will often remember you from a past visit. Consider that these guys were doing this before they had those cards you have to put in the slot machines to track your play. They still have it. If you're old enough to remember, back then it was all about taking care of customer. Anyone could be a high roller.

Okay, the food. The bone in ribeye is a true Fred Flinstone cut; and, one of the best I've had. The lamb chops are awesome too. Reviewers give it mixed marks on the vegetable sides, and I liked the duck fat fried potato wedges (last year) better than the regular fries cooked in duck fat this year. But everything else more than makes up for it. Great big cocktails. Nice, fresh bread selection. For the a la carte price at most fancier addresses on the strip, you get soup or salad, as well as vegetable and potato too. A very good value for the high quality atmosphere, service and excellent food!

Once you get over the fact that you came to Circus Circus for dinner and step inside THE Steak House, you step into yesteryear and the Mecca of wood-fired steaks--seriously! 

Our party of 10 was crammed tight into the tiny bar (seating capacity: 8) while our table was being prepared. The crusty old bar tender poured stingy, meticulously measured cocktails, squeezing every dime out of each liquor bottle while we were tantalized by the aroma of grilled steak creeping around the corner. 

Not the best start to the evening, but fortunately, not an indicator of what would follow. After a short wait, we were led to the dining room via a narrow, dimly lit passage way that meandered by the dry aging room and then the meat tender who was man handling the nicest cuts of beef I've ever seen, slinging them around the wood-fired grill like nobody's business. 

The service was super attentive and the kitchen is efficient. The steaks were as good or better than--and as generously portioned as any on the strip--or anywhere for that matter, including NYC.  The meat was as flavorful and flame crusted as your imagination allows. The clubby man-friendly atmosphere is somewhat reminiscent of the original Mortons in Chicago or Sparks in NYC--Dark wood, dim lighting, burgundy colored upholstery. I used to think Hugo's Cellar in the 4 Queens downtown was the best old-school steak house example remaining in Vegas, but The Steak House at Circus Circus has Hugo's Cellar beat by miles. 

If you're too young to remember what great steakhouses used to be like (and should still be like) before they all became mechanized look-alike and feel-alike big chains (think Ruths Chris, Flemmings, Morton's, and Del Frisco's and more recent entrants like Eddie V's, Perry's, etc.) you must try The Steak House and compare. It's not as old as Taditch Grill (SF) or St. Elmo's (Indy) or even Keen's (NYC), but it is better, less costly and every bit as old-school.  THE Steakhouse is a destination unto itself even if you're not into the whole ""Circus Circus thing"". I took a cab from the Wynn and am glad I did.

Well, I am the idiot for thinking that. The Steakhouse is bar far the best steakhouse I have ever been to, better than Smith and Wollensky up the strip and right up there with Mortons in Beverly Hills. 

The decor is awesome, it feels like you are stepping into a speakeasy in the roaring 20's. It is all dark wood, a brass fixtures. The have a glass aging room where you can see the meat being aged to what really is perfection. They also have their kitchen in the middle of the dining room so you can see the chefs work, and they do work hard, 

The food is amazing, from the basket of warm bread to the Caesar salad to the entree itself. I got a filet and couldn't finish it, it was that big. Unlike many of their competitors, they include the soup or salad and sides with the steak so you get a huge portion at a good price. Dessert was also huge and spectacular. Try the chocolate or cheesecake, you won't be sorry. 

Service was also stellar. There is always someone refilling your glass with bottled water (no charge) and we had a very nice and knowledgeable waiter. The best part of all was that while they were attentive, they did not hover. 

The person at the valet mentioned that the owner of Boyd casinos eats here. I can see why.

 I loved the selection of breads, I think 4 or 5 different types, the pretzel bread was amazing!  

Another thing I enjoyed is the steak isn't a la carte, you actually get sides along with your meal.  Now you won't find any duck fat fries or anything type of foie gras, nope, this is a traditional steakhouse!  I ordered the New York Strip.  

The steak was good, could have used a bit more flavor,  I know a lot of folks do not like or think a good, properly aged steak needs to be seasoned however it can add to the flavor of great steaks and save ordinary steaks.

We then saw the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant -- a good sign.  This place doesn't have anything to hide!  

The meal: we started with the complimentary bread basket.  All were fresh and warm.  I particularly liked the raisin bread.  Hubby chose the caesar salad and I elected to opt out of choosing a salad.  :)  (N.B. This place is not à la carte!  Sides are included.)  My salmon filet was perfectly cooked and my accompanying mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery.  Hubby's porterhouse was tender and VERY GOOD.  I almost wished I ordered that myself.  The only less-than-stellar component of our dinners was the veg (that night, carrots).  No flavour.  Dessert was the chocolate mousse cake.  It's the only dessert not housemade, but it was still decadent and delicious.  Coffee was meh, happy hour wine was yay.

The menu is simple - filet, porterhouse, rib eye, new york strip, lamb and seafood,  Really, going to a place called THE Steakhouse, how could one not get some beef?  No lamb or seafood for me.

The filet was not as tender as a filet should be.  Even though it was overcooked, the cut was still decent.  The ribeye cut however, was prepared much better.  The cut was cooked just as requested and the juicy fatty flavors really shined through.

Service: Always top notch. These waiters are old school and professional. They know how to give you your space while at the same time remain attentive. Always kept our water full (with their own branded water! Free of charge, no need to pay for some fancy pants Euro piss). 

Drinks:
Solid. They know how to make a solid Martini and other various old school drinks. They didnt know how to make my wifes French Martini, but gladly comped us a free drink for having to ask whats in it (and they did make it right). 

Food:
I loved every portion and the food was presented nicely and on-time and perfectly paced.

Salad: The house made dressing and all the fixings were yummy. 

Bread: Pretzel bread. Cow shaped butter. Enough said. 

Steaks: I have had their ribeye. Cooked perfectly. Both amazing in cut and flavor. Is this some USDA Prime dry aged marbled beast? Not sure. But that wood grilled mesquite makes these steaks mighty darn tasty.

Dessert:

If you want incredible ambiance & don't mind paying double what you'd pay @ Circus Circus, go to SW Steakhouse @ Wynn. BUT; if you want a reliably FANTASTIC steak with delicious  sides... Go to Circus Circus!!! It's without question, the locals best kept secret. The prices are reasonable, quality excels all the great steakhouses in Vegas AND.... every steak COMES WITH decent bread, black bean soup (to die for) or a COLD crisp salad AND seasonal veggies (usually asparagus) AND a potato.  French onion is the best I've ever had. One warning; the walk to the restaurant is always entertaining. Watch your feet, I've almost stepped on crawling babies in the hall.

It's their profession and they obviously take pride in what they do. I had to send my filet back because it was q bit over cooked and our waiter, Ray, whisked it away and was back in minutes with a brilliantly medium rare ( more rare than medium) filet, another whole baked potato and carrots. Besides a delicious chocolate raspberry birthday cake for our friend's birthday, he brought me 3 large chocolate covered strawberries just because I sent back my dinner.

I ordered a filet and out of all the filets I have had in my life I have never seen a filet that looked like this (looked like a very small tri tip) it was like a small triangle. I ordered my ($60.00) filet medium rare and it was medium to well done very chard on the outside with no flavor (all you could taste was the char). I have to tell you that I have never paid $350.00 dollars for four steak dinners where not one person at our table could finish close to half of their steaks. Dried out and no flavor!

The dark ambiance was great, it felt like I was having a meal in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. The rib eye was simply ridiculous....it felt like I was cutting through butter. Magnificent!!! The flavor was awesome. The shrimp were the biggest I have ever seen and the baked potato was all that!

2586332,2011-11-07,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"This is a very different restaurant from the type we normally select in Las Vegas. Everything screams out ""old school,"" from the waiters to the red vinyl booths. You are not going to find any molecular gastronomy on the menu, nor can you expect to pay those types of prices. But if you are looking for a great value for a simple steak cooked to your liking, it is hard to beat what The Steak House has to offer.

For starters, both my wife and I chose the house salad with an Italian vinegar être. The salad was quite large, and full of fresh, crispy vegetables. The dressing was tangy but not overly sweet. For the main course, my wife chose the lobster tail, while I opted for the ""petite"" cut of prime rib. This was my first mistake of the evening. Actually, two mistakes: one was that I ordered the prime rib cooked medium well, which as everyone knows is just a rookie move. The second was that I assumed ""petite"" meant...well, small. The huge slab of beef that was set on my plate threatened to topple over the table. Since I'm not someone who can eat a huge amount of cow at one sitting, I barely made a dent in my plate. This leads me to suggest that sharing a meal at The Steak House might be a viable option, assuming you can agree on what to order and how you like it cooked.

We finished up our meal with quite possibly the best coffee I've had at a restaurant. A perfect ending to what was a good (not great) meal. I can definitely see the appeal of The Steak House, but I think the Zagat score of 28 is awfully high.",mTcP_4sV434OoVWwUv_Z6A,1,0,4,cyIJ2EvopwSA5HG9mpo3FA

I had to literally tell him once more that I would prefer if the kitchen chefs cut it. He looked irritated. I mean WTF, why would you try to cut my damn prime rib for me? He brought the meat back and it was cut in a way that it should've never been cut. Directly down the middle.  When I've ordered this before on different occasions it has never came to my table looking so rock bottom. It always comes actually cut in a way that looks like an excellent cut of meat. I'm so angry that this waiter literally took my cutting knife and proceeded my cut my 27 OUNCE PRIME RIB STEAK AT MY TABLE. And then we only had 1 AU JUS Sauce to share.

I ordered the rib eye which looked good when it came out but had almost no taste.  Having eaten steak the whole week before in death valley i was expecting this steak to be the best of the lot.  I was incorrect.  Everyone in my party was asking for the salt shaker to add some taste to the meat.  A few shakes was not enough. I think they forgot to add any salt.  My side of a bake potato was good...but it is hard to get that wrong.,yAqKYZ-PsvEevVNKn9rBpw,0,0,2,5jKcK0N83uhQZVRpgDzsQA

OK I'll me more constructive: Don't put spices on crab meat, it ruins it. Don't put bacon in everything, many people cannot eat. The wild rice was overcooked and extremely salty. Everything was salty. The fish was not cooked correctly. The sautéd mushrooms tasted weird. Canned perhaps? The asparagus was OK, but simply cooked. Microwaved?

It was the first time for my husband and he only agreed to dine here because he loves me.  He wasn't excited walking through this ultra cheesy hotel.  But, he absolutely LOVED this place.  

To start off, they give you an assortment of delicous bread.  Yum.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and it was seriously the largest shrimp we've ever had.  Very tasty.  I had my salad with blue cheese dressing.  Nice chunks of fresh blue cheese and good veggie toppings on the salad.

We both had the filet mignon.  Melted in your mouth.  In addition, it had such a nice flavor (think they put mesquite in the grill).

Service was great too.  Our glasses were always filled with water, we had minimal time where we were sitting without food and they cleared our plates immediately after we were done eating (my husband hates sitting at a table when finished plates are left on the table).

Yes prices in comparison to other steakhouses are good but the steaks weren't all that wonderful. I recently took two doctors who work for me out for a meeting and saw that this would be a great place with a great ambience. The ambience was great but the steak was not to be much desired for. I got the prime rib, the big giant bone in cut , and it was literally 95% fat. The asparagus was bland and the bread that they initially served wasn't that hot. The salad was decent but nothing compared to the Cortez room for other places I've been. My two Dr. Friends got the porterhouse which they seems to enjoy all the one said it was a little too Blackened.

Honestly I would never go back. Not because of any other reason except for the quality compared to what they really pretrade themselves to be. The flavor profiles weren't there. Yes the ambience was great staff was extremely friendly as well. But it did not leave me longing for more.

Michael is a great bartender. He's friendly, professional and has good knowledge of the town. The mesquite grill is in the middle of the restaurant, so you can see them grilling your steak. I started with the shrimp cocktail. Giant shrimp that were fresh and great tasting. For my meal, I had the porterhouse steak with salad, garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. One of the many great things about this place is that your great steak comes with soup or salad, baked or mashed potatoes and veggies. At most other high end steak houses, the steak is a la carte and doesn't come with anything. Other places make you pay like $15 for each side. Anyway, the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and very tender. They season the meat enough so it has flavor, but you can taste the beef. No need for steak sauce, but I would imagine with just a touch, it can be great as well. The service was excellent and I have nothing bad to say about this place.

My prime rib was very flavorful. Not the very best I've ever had (House of Prime Rib, San Francisco), but it was pretty close.

My dining companions' entrees were equally good (grilled shrimp, salmon, and rib-eye steak).

Desserts were very good as well - my creme brulee was fantastic. The creme brulee sampler was apparently ok, but the plain vanilla flavored was the best of the 4 samples.

We were so excited because we heard good things and the smell that constantly lingered in your nose after walking by was amazing! 
We entered the place to hopefully be seated right away. The mananger was standing at the hostess post and asked how he could help us. We went on to say we wanted a table for two. He then followed it up with ""well you need to make a reservation "". The place was not busy AT ALL but we agreed to it and made one. He told us the wait would be 45mins. Mind you, we walked in straight from gambling all day so we were not dressed up- far from it actually and we really didn't want to leave to change, so we sat down and waited. The manager kept looking at us as if he wanted us to change and about 15mins later he came up (after realizing we weren't going anywhere) to say he could seat us... this is when the horrible experience begins.
We go around the corner to be seated and noticed only 2-3 tables were active. We sit down and giggled cuz we felt so out of place. The table arrangement was nice, as you can see in one of the photos. There were 2 waiters so we expected everything to run smoothly- we were wrong. Our waiter saw us and continued to service his other table. We sat for a good 30mins just waiting for drinks. I'm thinking this was done puposely to see if we would leave because of our appearance but we stayed cuz we wanted steak. We put our drink order in finally along with our order so we didn't have to wait longer. We got soup, another one of the pics, it looked better than it tasted. Totally not worth it to be honest. When our steaks came, the other pic, we got so excited cuz they looked phenomenal- far from it. We took a bite and looked at each other surprised cuz there was no...flavor...at all! And the potatoes were cold! We took a couple more bites and said screw it. Our waiter didn't check on us until another good 30mins and when he did we voiced our disappointment. He gave us attitude and got the manager. When he cane over we explained to him as well our disappointment and he was shocked that both of us had the same problem and proceeded to ask us to try another bite and we said we did (it was obvious) and then explained that we didn't want anything else. He then was trying to be nice after being kind of a jerk and offered another meal- we got crab legs and rice, they were OK, better than the steak for sure. Either way, this place IS NOT worth the money out of pocket and we will NEVER go back, even with points. The whole experience seemed stereotypical towards us because we were young, in our 30s, have tattoos, and were completely dressed down. They had no idea that we had money, which we did. It was like something out of the movie Selena... don't judge a book by its cover!!
To this day I believe our experience and customer service (or extreme lack of) was the reason behind this.

(OK, I just flashed back to the Yelp! South Park episode where Kyle's dad goes into these long winded and terrifically verbose reviews. My bad.)

Anyways, back to this incredible experience! 

Having to navigate through Circus Circus and the hordes of kids was pretty annoying, but once you step through that archway it almost feels like you are being transported to a different time. They definitely kick up the a/c in there and you could feel it instantly!

The room is a throwback to classic, old school Vegas. I LOVE IT! Lots of dark oaks, dim lighting, and romantic music are some of the first things that hit my senses. The other thing....

...the incredible aroma of steak being perfectly cooked and marinated! Wow! It smelled so good in there! 

Nancy was our server this evening and she was outstanding! Very friendly and attentive service, without being at all intrusive. When we return(which is about a 100% guarantee at this point), we will certainly request her! 

We were seated promptly and within 2 minutes were brought a bread bowl with butter and served our drinks. Service was done in a very timely fashion very little lull between items. The bread was warm and soft, so the butter just melted perfectly inside. I didn't want to fill up on bread so I just had a couple of pieces.

As for the main course, we both opted for the New York Strip Steak ($56), which came with a choice of house salad or  black bean soup (I had the house salad) and garlic mashed potatoes or a baked potato. 

The garlic mashed potatoes were so good! Compared to the puny and bland portion we recieved at another strip restaurant the previous week, this really hit the spot!

But the steak! Oh, that NY Strip steak was so delectable! It was so tender and juicy, the knife just fell to the plate with ease with each cut. We were both wildly impressed with how flavorful it was! Without a doubt, one of the best steaks i've ever had in my life!

Service was beyond outstanding! Our glasses were never empty the entire meal! It really made the difference between having a good meal and an experience!

Nancy asked if we would like to have desert, but we were totally stuffed and had to throw in the towel at that point! But, rest assured, we will be back! Oh, we will be back!

The other people in my party were also not able to finish their steaks as they were over cooked and chewy.   Much to my amazement the server did not offer to take these steaks off when he came to the table and nobody had touched their food.

Stepping foot into The Steakhouse is like taking a step back into time. The stark contrast between the casino and the restaurant is as night and day.

The restaurant is like its steak, aged and vintage. You are greeted by a display case of their aged cuts of meat, that will either A) Make carnivorous folk drool in anticipation or B) Make you wonder why are you staring at old aged raw meat and totally turns you off... I am the former so I was already ready to dig into a nice porterhouse.

I got a nice juicy, flavorful cut, and the service was great. Price is a bit steep, but you pay that much for a decent cut. My only complaint is it's location... This steak place is the only reason I'd want to go to the Circus Circus, and that more often then not is not enough reason for me to go there compared to all these other great casinos and restaurants.

3038079,2010-01-23,2,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Yes, compared to the rest of the hellhole that is Circus Circus this is a rather upscale and classey establishment!  Of course, compared to the rest of the hotel your neighborhood Applebee's is a rather upscale and classey place...

But on to the restaurant itself - interior is dark wood, kind of with a British hunt club feel. You know, classic steakhouse? 

The food - well, ehh.  The steaks themselves were good cuts and cooked as ordered but, and I jest not, no flavor whatsoever.  I had to put salt and pepper on my ribeye.  That's really not acceptable at a high end steakhouse.   Also, the house Cab  ( I just had a glass as the person with was not a wine drinker) was rather cheap tasting. Basically a glass of Two Buck Chuck for about $8 or something like that.

On the plus side it's not as expensive as most of the town's other higher end steakhouses - the steaks do come with a side dish -  however, this really isn't a top notch steakhouse.  It's more or less middle of the road. For that it's sort of pricey.

I understand that this place was, for a number of years, (note the past tense) voted one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  Sorry my friend, thise days are long gone.",LbtFyFzsdt-d2XDlIGVsaQ,3,1,2,hrmRWOFP4mkeLjJBidrCpg

The interior. The layout. The staff. The service. The steak. Everything was 5 star. Amazing. Quiet, Classic. Total high class upper 1% of steakhouses in the world. It's authentic, classic, and everything is original. I felt like I was taken back to a different era. 

It's dark. Dim. Perfect lighting. Exactly how a classic steakhouse should be. The steaks are cooked over two huge charcoal grills in the middle of the steakhouse. You can see your steak being cooked. They have a suction vent sucking all the smoke from the middle but the coals crackle and pop and the air is permeated with the amazing smell of large salt and pepper seasoning on grilled steak. 

The steaks are also dry aged in the steakhouse for days or months under perfect climate controlled conditions. You can see the steaks behind the glass. Their wine list, while not extensive, is almost perfectly selected. I would only ask they add Shiraz or some more expensive wines by the glass to the menu. 

I have been to many steakhouses in Vegas and this is the #1 Steakhouse in my opinion. They are probably refusing to pay publicists or journalists in the media which is why you rarely see media raving about them expect in Zagat magazine which they have been ranked #1 for 30 years and I can see why.

3075714,2010-05-27,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Seems like a deal but read on please.

Well I have eaten here a few times now and I have to say I don't really like it.  First off its 47 bucks for a bone in rib eye now and even though it comes with sides they are lousy.  In one word to describe the whole meal, bland.  First off the steak is dry aged but only 21 days and they have really no aged flavor.  Second they do not season the meat at all, I mean not a bit, it was completely bland and flavorless, you can add salt at the table but by then it's too late.  My last steak I got was cooked ok, actually a little rare, but it had a strong burnt charcoal taste, a few others at the table said the same and some did not.  

   The few asparagus spears that comes with are very plain too and were very bland.  You can't pick your veggie, it's just whatever they give you.  Also the dinner salad is fine I guess but if you want caesar it's 5 bucks more.  There are only 2 potatoes to choose from baked or mashed, boring.  In the end this place isn't much cheaper and even more expensive than some, treat yourself and go somewhere else and share one or two real good sides with a group.  As long as you don't go overboard It will only cost a few bucks more a person and it is worth it.  A better steak I found that wasn't terribly pricey was the range at harrahs, way better.

As long as you don't compare this place to the expensive premium steakhouses like CUT or Carnevino this place isn't really a deal at all.  4 steaks at 44 (reasonable price for joe's, fleming's, range, envy, delfrisco...) and you all split 3 sides that you get to pick (more than enough) at 8 each would be 50 a person, only 3 dollars more a person than 47 rib eyes at circus circus.  I can't think of a legit steakhouse that I had a worse meal at so I don't see how you could go wrong elsewhere if you are considering this place.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,4,0,1,-B11wQApGCqJ6suoGvcPfg

Waiters are true professionals and run the business efficiently.
Now the bad part.  The food.  The bread basket was inedible except for the bread sticks. Ceaser Salad came out of the fridge cold and pre-made.  The parmesan seemed like it came from Costco, and there were no anchovies on the salad.  It really shouldn't be that difficult for a great steak house to make a decent Caesar.
Next the New York Strip came out.  It was literally shoe leather.  It was also not only under seasoned, it was unseasoned. The waiter like at any great steak house took it back and replaced it with an extra petit filet.  The cut was great, but again unseasoned.  Finally, the side of mushrooms had a canned quality too them.

Many times I have had sub-par food but everyone has an off night and service, location etc have led me to return for a better night. Having always wanted to try this steakhouse but unable to convince myself that a client dinner or romantic evening would be perfect inside Circus Circus, finally last night I had my chance. Fright Dome tickets with a steak prior.

Here's the deal:

1) Great Service
2) Incredible black bean soup
3) Nice salad
4) Great shrimp app
5) NY steak very juicy

So how do I find fault?

Cooking area that is out in the open is decades old and you see all the sides, mushroom, asparagus, sauces in pots that may be clean but just plain old looking. Electrical cords every where, the round ones like my parents used to have! Anyone who says this is best steak ever, needs to get around a little, sorry but that is the truth. Overall not a bad experience but if they are looking for my $200+ dinner for 2 they need to do a lot more. After all when it comes down to it do you really want to go through a cheap, old, smokey, Circus Circus for a romantic meal or business dinner...I don't think so!

You might see me for next years Halloween and Fright Dome but other than that your on your own.

A friend and I dined here; I had the porterhouse, he the main filet, both medium rare.  The ingredient quality was good and the temperature was right, but generally the steaks were not flavorful and had no crust.  Clearly there are many styles of preparation and not all will be seasoned or have a crust, but that is my expectation for an American-style steakhouse, which the Steak House is clearly trying to achieve.

My wife's filet was really tender but the flavor was non existent. The asparagus were thin and still not cooked to tender at the bottom of the stalk. In other words, the bottom part of an already thin and short asparagus was inedible. The crudest salad was drenched in dressing and the romaine lettuce was soggy. And to top it all off, the prices of the food are 5-star prices but this is clearly a 3-star steakhouse.

It's also completely empty since everyone at Circus Circus can't do math, likely can't order off of a menu in English, and can't win at the games.  The idea of a serious streakhouse doesn't really fit with the ghetto vibe.

It is dark and cozy, and we sat in a red vinyl booth.  I love how you can see the aging room and the kitchen as you walk in.  The menu is simple, and we enjoyed the porterhouse, a mashed potato, the spinach salad, and the onion soup.  The breadbasket hit the spot.  Alongside the potato came a number of toppings, including so much delicious bacon it was comical!  The spinach salad was just okay, as we would have expected the dressing on it so you get that slightly wilted effect.  The rest of the meal was outstanding, and we especially enjoyed the steak.

 The Spinach Salad with hot bacon dressing - this was nothing special definitely more deserving to be highlighted at a mid market family restaurant.

The Chopped Salad- decent but again nothing special.

Petite Filet w garlic mashed and green beans- Sorry can't use the words great to describe it . The green beans were the standout.

Porterhouse- Not cooked correctly filet Ok but other side tough and overcooked which in my mind is completely ridiculous for a steak house where you are paying 50 plus for a steak.

Desserts- looked good but frankly after being underwhelmed by  dinner didn't take the plunge.

We arrived to The Steakhouse after walking through The Circus Circus to find a surprising setting and ambiance. We were greeted by the manager and immediately walked to our booth after giving our reservation info. The manager actually turned the table sideways so I could slide in and moved it back after we sat! Being 6 months pregnant I found it unexpected and greatly appreciated. 


The menu was old school, straight forward and genuine. We both ordered the bone-in prime rib. It was a Flintstones sized cut! Delicious. For dessert we got 2 orders of the chocolate covered strawberries because the first was so sweet.

But, the kicker, the icing on the cake, what really made the entire evening special, unique and tailored to us was Javier's top notch attention and service!! He was friendly, pleasant and engaging. He spoke to us about our soon to be baby girl being that it was our first child and told us about his family and related. He was absolutely amazing and definitely made the evening memorable.

We were shown to a booth directly facing the area where they cook the steaks, the smell of the mesquite smoke was delightful.
Server came and introduced himself, they only had a wine menu, no cocktail menu or beer menu.  We ordered drinks and they were delivered within a few minutes along with a selection of bread, rolls and breadsticks.  I'm not sure about bread and rolls with raisins, I prefer savory bread and rolls.
Me and Johan ordered the Rib Eye steaks, our friends the Filet Mignon and petite prime rib.  Noticed prices were about $10 to $15 more than a menu I'd seen online, meals came with choice of potato, vegetables and with a salad or bean soup to start with.  We ordered 3 salads and I upgraded my bean soup for a French onion soup for $6 more.  Salads were nicely presented and no complaints there, my French onion soup was served with a whole spring onion for some reason.  I'm a French onion soup fanatic, this version was watery and lacked any depth in flavor, not worth ordering or finishing.
Meals arrived, both rib eyes were cooked well, my medium well was a tad undercooked, but ok.  Garlic mashed potatoes were bland, creamy but just bland.  Broccolini was just steamed and so so.  Our friends said the Filet Mignon was dry.  Fresh cracked pepper offered with the salad but not with the entrees?
Server came to check on meals way too early, nobody had touched their steaks yet, didn't see him again till end of meal.  Friends had not been offered drink refills.  He cleared our table and asked if we wanted desserts or coffees, we asked for a menu and again told they don't have one, he rattled off a list of desserts and coffees and gave us a few minutes to consider.  I personally don't like ordering without knowing prices, was already surprised by more expensive menu to start with.  We declined desserts and just got our check.  For 2 of us, rib eyes, 2 beers and $6 soup upgrade was $167 excl tip.  Did not live up to the hype at all, if I spend that much I expect perfection with food and service and was let down on both points.

Maybe it just wasn't what I expected after reading all the Yelpers raving about this place. Had reservations for 7 and was seated immediately on arrival. 

The place is dark and the decor is oldish looking. Maybe they were going for the antique look? it just looked old to me. Upon walking in past the reception desk we were taken past a raised cooking area where the chefs cooked the steaks. We were seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant. Seat in the booth was comfy. 

The service was good. Wait staff kept our waters filled with bottle water and checked on us often. Bread basket was good. The butter was cold and hard as rock when it first got to the table. :/ As for the salad well. It was a salad. That was fine. From my meal, the things I liked most was the French onion soup and garlic mashed potatoes. Those were very yummy. The steak fell very short of what I expect from a great steak. I hold Ruth Chris as my absolute favorite place for steak. I have also been to Morton's (in Hawaii) and Gallager's (in the NYNY hotel). I would rank Gallager's as my close second. But all of these are a better choice than The Steak House at Circus Circus. And to be honest I find even Stuart Anderson's/The Cattle Company to have better steak than this place. When presented with my entree it looked good. But after my first bite of my steak I was greatly disappointed. It lack any seasoning. No salt, pepper. Nothin'. It also had charred grill marks that made the steak taste burnt. Even after attempting to make the steak more palatable by cutting off the char and adding some salt and pepper I still couldn't get myself to eat more than half of it. And I'm a girl that LOVES meat. I can eat a whole cowboy ribeye at Ruth Chris myself.  I will stab your hand with my fork if you try to take it from me when I didn't offer you any. And I will eat all of my yummy ribeye like the merry piggy I am when I am eating steak. But with this steak, I couldn't. The more I tried to make myself eat it because it was quite a costly ribeye ($54), the more I didn't want it. The char flavor had permeated the meat and cutting off the top and bottom didn't take away that burnt taste. It was sad that I had to waste it because I absolutely could not get myself to eat it. 

I highly doubt I will try this place again.",i7058savoJRN5RBeixLl0Q,2,0,2,sV0zhLlhUq4vgVsn3wi7qA
3249134,2013-05-11,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Great steakhouse. Awesome service. The only reason I'm not giving this restaurant 5 stars is because the dessert wasn't five star quality and I'm very frugal about handing out fivers. 

I came here with my roommate and a couple of our friends from Michigan. We got a ridiculous deal because my roommate is buddies with one of the managers, Felix. Definitely say hi to him if you visit because he will make you feel right at home. We started off with red wine and the seafood sensation appetizer. Both were fantastic. Nothing too complicated--just top notch seafood. 

I got the petite filet which was amazing. Great flavor, perfectly done, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The sides matched the quality of the steak which I can't say about the sides at Binion's Steakhouse. 

Desserts were OK. We ordered tiramisu, chocolate cake, and cheesecake between the four of us. We were pretty full at that point so we didn't finish everything. Best out of those three was probably the cheesecake because that's the one I remember the most. I've had better tiramisu and chocolate cake elsewhere. 

Overall we had a great experience and I definitely recommend it. Ambiance is old-school classy and very welcoming. Our waiter was warm, helpful, and friendly but professional at the same time.

I've been to a seafood buffet, which was very good, Italian restaurants, cheap eats, etc. and I must say this was the best place I went to. A large Portehouse steak, just enough marbling, luscious and juicy. No frills meal; great sides, included. Hostess was an attractive slim woman with a Central European accent; my guess is Czech. She was very nice and fast with the service. Wait staff also equally professional, kind, and alert. Prices were honest and not just to pay for a fancy place or to fatten a celebrity chefs wallet. I have a beef with these celeb. chefs. What do they do? They cook. They claim it is art. BS. Art survives the test of time; their ""art"" won't survive anyone's bite. So I really am not nor will not make any Gordon Ramsay, Collichio, Battali, whatever whatever any richer for their overpriced meat and preparations. I also hate it when they put down people on their shows, that's why. Any person can cook, maybe not be a chef, but anyone can cook. But not everyone can fly a plane. Or perform surgery. Or design a skyscraper. So you high priced Vegas chefs you can stuff it, this place will kick your behinds any day as far as taste, presentation, value, and overall experience.",9LX0aIyVbmhfEjqJEbt4ZA,4,2,5,3ijbDBZ6vVbVbOmjTCQLvw

Service excellent.  Our waiter Richard, and  assistant Ernesto, were top of the line fabulous.... efficient, friendly, just terrific.  Made the dinner so special.

Our rib eye steaks were cooked to perfection-- char on outside, pink inside.  Garlic mashed potatoes, and asparagus were also sooooo good.  Paired our steaks with glasses of Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon, which went so well.  After gorging ourselves silly, we had a complementary Tiramisu (for our anniversary) which was a perfect ending to the dinner.  A wonderful experience, great food and service.

3326213,2008-10-07,5,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Here's a question for you: where is the WORST steakhouse in Vegas?  

Every damn steakhouse in this beautiful city claims to be ""the best in Las Vegas.""  Yep, Pipefitters and Drain Uncloggers Union Local 133 proclaimed, and Retired Shop Teachers Society of Pahrump, NV agreed, that So-and-So Steakhouse is the ""Best in Las Vegas.""  Think for yourself and know your sources.

Well, it was Friday night in Vegas and we found ourselves hungry and reservation-less.  All dressed up and nowhere to go, if you will.  I took the elevator to the main level and walked from the bright light of the casino to the pleasant darkness of The Steakhouse.  I basically talked the hostess into seating us at 7:45, which was less than an hour from that point.

The ambiance was that of a traditional steakhouse.  Quiet and dark, the restaurant looked like a classy, old-school, old-money parody of itself.  The Steakhouse has it all: dark leather booths, cow paintings, giant slabs of beef . . .

The prices here are pretty reasonable: $44 buys you a salad, a decent size steak with some vegetables and a potato side of your choosing.  Places like Morton's charge you about $50 for the steak itself, with the rest served a la carte.  However, comparing The Steakhouse to Morton's is like comparing the fence in your back yard to the Great Wall of China: both are made of bricks and both protect you from intruders, but only one is worth traveling thousands of miles to see it .

My New York strip from The Steakhouse tasted very bland.  While perfectly prepared, the meat simply lacked flavor.  It was a cheap USDA prime New York strip which could have been purchased at a local Safeway and cooked at home.  You can season the meat and charbroil it to death, but you just can't add flavor to it.  I guess you get what you pay for.  However, in the city of $7.99 prime rib dinners, The Steakhouse should really think about distancing itself from the competition.

A word about our waiter, if you don't mind.  Richard, who was pretty nice to the three of us in the beginning, was a bit confused about his target audience.  For the first few minutes, he was being extremely professional and helpful.  Shortly thereafter, he somehow mistook me and my two female dinner companions for 3 douchebags.  He went from ""Sir, will you be having wine this evening?"" to ""Dude, look at this steak!  Thick, juicy, full of fat - beautiful!"" and from ""Would you care for a shrimp cocktail?"" to ""Man, that stuff [horseradish] is HOT.  Owww!"" in less than 15 minutes.  We all looked at each other in disbelief.  There was a time when I could pass for a college freshman recovering from a tough fraternity pledge week, but not now.  I treat you with respect, and I expect you to do the same.  If I wanted to be your friend, I'd bring a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon and some pork rinds to your double-wide, OK?

Overall, an OK place for dinner if you find yourself on the North end of the Strip.  It's definitely NOT one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, but at least it's not outrageously pricey.  Meh.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,5,4,3,NdyiN-3OM8FV3rDiUeUsLg

The rib eye, also huge, is to die for. The steaks had that perfect char taste. The don't season their steaks, which I saw some yelpers complain about, but I guess they dont get that The Steak House wants you to get the flavor of the meat, not the salt or a marinade. The salad is your run of the mill cripy veggies. The black bean soup was very tasty, served with a side of onions and dry sherry. The potato and veggies come with your meal as well, not ala carte like most steak houses. The veggies is always the chefs choice. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cake which was decadent.

We decided to do our super sexy date night at the famed Steak House at Circus Circus. Unfortunately, you must go through a good chunk of the casino before you get there (see my review on Circus Circus itself). 

We were a couple of minutes late for our 9pm reservation so the Maitre d asked us if we wouldn't mind chilling at the bar for a bit. No problem whatsoever. It was a good time to get to check out the ambiance (very cool old school decor...much like where the Rat Pack or my grandfather would have hung out). Our bartender looked grouchy and didn't have much personality at all so I made it my mission before we were seated to make him at least crack a smile. We ordered a couple of drinks and the tab came out to $18...very reasonable by Vegas Strip standards....still no smile. Whatever...you can't win them all but I was still friendly (I try to remember that maybe they had a bad day...we've all been there done that...so maybe a friendly customer could be uplifting...you never know how far a smile goes). My man and I are chit chatting and we hear loud conversation behind us that can only be described as a person with Tourettes (lots of mo' fo's and b*tches being thrown around)...or just a really obnoxious dude parading his ho's around (cheap and tawdry girls with too much makeup and vajay-jay level dresses). Needless to say my man and I got a chuckle out of this (man o man do I love people watching). Finally...the Maitre d comes to seat us.

He took us to a lovely and romantic booth (it was awesome with the exception of this creepy little kid that looked like Justin Beiber who just kept staring at us from the table across the way). We looked over our menus and decided on a petite filet and a porterhouse. Both came with soup or salad, choice of starch and a chef inspired veggie. Our server was nice but nothing to write home about. She seemed bummed that we only ordered one round of drinks and no appetizers (we were not that hungry). The black bean soup was wonderful with a side of chopped onions and a shot of sherry....delicious and filling. The salad was just your typical salad with blue cheese. Our main course came out and was lovely. The steak cooked just right (med-rare...is there any other way?). I opted for the baked potato and he got the garlic mashed potatoes. Both were tasty...but I think I would have to say the mashed potatoes were better. I couldn't eat much of my meal because the soup filled me up...so my man got an amazing doggy bag. 

We decided on no dessert because my dress was starting to cut off my circulation. Overall it was an A-Ok experience. We will probably be back for the value but I cringe at the thought of having to walk through Circus Circus to get there.",COjPTDD-tFr73Gly2xL3gw,2,1,3,6Gb04-RMESnlXCOB54gJEg

No clownin' around here (ha ha). Circus Circus'  THE Steak House has won me over.

First Course - Appetizer - House Salad: I don't even know why I'm writing about the salad because you don't make friends with salad, as Homer J. Simpson once said. Let me be real: the salad was basic. Red onion slices, carrots, mushrooms, and greens. I ordered a vinaigrette dressing on the side, which had the perfect tanginess.

Second Course - Entree - Filet Oscar: If you're expecting several carnivorous offerings, sorry, but the Filet Oscar is the only slab of meat that they're offering for Restaurant Week, which to me is fine. The thick 8oz filet was topped with chunks of king crab with a generous serving of creamy hollandaise poured all over. For my side, I selected wild rice over the mashed potatoes; asparagus was the Chef's Choice veggie of the evening. 

Third Course - Dessert - Chocolate Covered Strawberries and Creme Brulee: ""These strawberries are wearing Armani tuxedos, not tuxes from JC Penny,"" my server said to me - gotta love the humor. The chocolate covered strawberries were created to look as though they're ""wearing"" tuxedos. Cute and sweet. My mom and I shared creme brulee, which was fantastic.

Service: Excellent. 

Overall: THE Steak House is so good that I would make the drive to Circus Circus -- that's saying a lot. Whether it's during Restaurant Week or any other week of the year, I still recommend that tourists and locals give this steakhouse a shot.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,10,8,5,3wMi8B-0pVQQOzz5FmUCwg

The meat is on displace aging in temperature controlled glass lockers for your viewing pleasure.  The red booths are what give it the throwback look with the kitchen grill on full display in the middle.  The meat is aged 21 days without spices...

That being said, this place is very good if you like your meat rare to medium rare as the flavors really come out.  Anything above medium and you will have a burnt tasteless piece of meat on your plate.  This place is old school and everything is ala cart and should be shared, the bone in Rib Eye is very good.

I am a purist when it comes to meat so butter, excess salt, or marinade on my steak...I will pass.  In other words Ruth Chris' type places are awful to me.  I'd say this place is on par with Morton's of Chicago, Flemming's, etc.  price-wise too.

We were skeptical at first since it's in Circus Circus and the atmosphere there we try to avoid.  But this place is a slice of heaven!  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with an amazing aroma of food.  The meat locker in the front behind the hostess desk has a beautiful array of cuts of meat, and if you look close enough the slabs have dates on them showing how fresh they are.  We were ushered by a very nice man from NY past the grilling island were you could see them preparing your food and we were promptly seated. The atmosphere is pretty upper class with rich woods, a fireplace, darkened room and pretty quiet aside from the restraunt music and the chattering of other diners. This is definitely NOT a place for small children. Our waiter (who kind of liked like Drew Carey) was attentive but not too the point of being annoying. When I described what kind of wine I wanted he suggested one that was spot on perfect.  Our water glasses were never empty and our meals were beyond good.  I had the petite filet mignon and it was the best I have ever tasted. The cheesecake which was recommended by both the NY gentleman and our waiter was also phenomenal.

But after many years and many many recommendations I finally made the schlep over and now I am kicking myself for eating anywhere else in vegas for a steak. 

First off you can see how they cook the steaks when you walk in and they are char cooked so if you don't realize that your an idiot and are wrong sorry.

Next the hospitality was bar none might have been the greatest experience in a restaurant in my life. Our waiter was amazing! I was going to order a caprese salad and he told me dont worry about it cause you get a salad with your steak I was still going to do it cause I wanted mozzerella and he brought some out for free without asking so I could have my meal the way i wanted it.

For app we had the shrimp cocktail. Beautifully plated baby arm sized shrimp and he knew we were sharing so he brought them out on seperate plates already for us with our own lemons and cocktail sauce. 

Afterwards he came back and chatted with us about NY and the history of the restaurant among other things. Extremely knowledgeable and all around great guy.

Our steaks were cooked perfectly and he even went and found me some fresh ground horseradish for my steak to top it with. I can't wait to get to vegas to come back here worth a trip by itself and this time I am definitely getting the prime rib!

3696260,2015-11-23,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"I was in Vegas about a year ago and did some research into which steakhouse to patronize. I chose one that was well reviewed and that had made more than a few top ten lists. It had a famous guy's name attached and held a prominent position in the ranks of the city's swanky meat joints. I could not have been more disappointed and upon leaving the place, felt a little swindled. 
     This time I decided to go old school-y, narrowing it down to The Steakhouse, Hugo's or Golden Steer. I was more than happy with my choice of The Steakhouse at Circus Circus. 
     The worst part of the visit was the actual walk through CC. it's not nearly the worst place I've ever walked through, but it's a bit of a dump. The ceiling felt a little lower and the cig smoke smelled a little thicker than the Vegas average. I breathed through my mouth and moved quickly.  
     Once in the restaurant, you walk past an glass enclosed aging ""closet"" and a glass enclosed kitchen where you can see them grilling the most gorgeous slabs of beef and pristine shellfish, all on the way to really beautiful red leather booths and white tablecloths. The lighting is low, the room warm and dark and in the background you hear the hum of Sinatra or Tony Bennett. It's all like some welcoming Martin Scorsese cliche  is playing out just for you and it's awesome. Fantastic vibe in this room! 
        You get bottled water and a less than stellar bread basket after ordering. The pre-meal  salad was decent with generous amounts of crumbled bleu cheese. My companion thought the black bean soup was on the bland side, but liked the addition of sherry and onions on the side. 
       I had a bone-in ribeye that was around the size of a hubcap and my companion had a porterhouse that was a bit bigger than that. These things were huge. I didn't finish mine, which is rare. And speaking of that, both steaks were cooked a goddamned perfect medium rare with a nice criss-cross mesquite char covering tender and flavorful goodness inside. I had not had a steak this good in a very long time, in this city or any other. I added sauteed mushrooms and peppercorn sauce on the side, but they were unnecessary. The other sides were fine. Garlic potatoes, wild rice, asparagus, yadda yadda....The meat is the show here, and worth the trip.

It is dimly lit and very upscale and traditional...not what you would expect for being inside Circus Circus. On both visits the service has been excellent. Our waiter on the last visit said he had been serving here for over 20 years. 

We started off with dirty martinis which were really good. We skipped on ordering an appetizer as the entrees all come with a salad and a side and the portions are pretty large. This is a nice change from your standard upscale steak house where everything is a la carte. I ordered the NY Strip and my wife ordered the Filet. I recommend getting the Waldorf Wedge to start and the Garlic Mashed Potatoes as your side. Both are excellent. The wine selection here is nice and very reasonably priced. 

The steaks are aged for 21 days in house. I am not sure if it is Prime beef or not, but it tastes great. Both of our steaks were perfectly cooked. I have been to better steak houses around the country, but for the price this place can't be beat. I haven't been to the elite steakhouses in Vegas so I am not sure how it compares to those, but then again they are in completely different price points so I don't see how you could compare them.

From the beginning, hostess had a line 5 deep to be seated and was chatting away with the guy at the front. Restaurant was half empty, there should not have been a line at all. We were sat in a table next to the grill. Again, the place is half empty why put us next to the smoky grill instead of a booth.

We made a reservation online with no problem. Upon arriving at our scheduled time, we were immediately taken to our table. So that was nice.

The decor is pretty old-fashioned, I'm not sure if that's ""in a good way."" But it was comfortable and clean. The meats are being grilled right in the middle of the restaurant so that was kind of cool.

Our server was nice and polite, if a little stuffy. We got a bread basket right away. It wasn't impressive and the butter was frozen, but you know, whatever. It's bread. 

First we ordered the French onion soup and the grilled shrimp. Both really, really good. I love French onion soup, so I was very happy to have a good bowl.

On to the entrees. My husband had the ribeye and I had the petite cut prime rib. According to the menu, you are supposed to have a choice of soup or salad with that, but we were not offered this choice. I don't know why. But that was pretty annoying.

The food was delicious. I mean the garlic mash and asparagus were kind of bland and ""meh."" But the meats were perfectly cooked, juicy and came in large portions.

For dessert we shared the creme brulee, which I have to say was horrible. It was totally grainy and so unpleasant. I was soo disappointed because I love creme brulee.

So...basically a star lost for the snobbish server, blah-ish bread with frozen butter, lack of side salad (or soup) with our entree, and the worst creme brulee I've had since I tried to make one myself with no blender in a slow cooker.",3-26zw4Eaz4h4aAZv3IKlw,3,3,4,eSi-efBQ1DTocwZQ44BQdQ

When was the last time you ate at a higher end steak house (not Outback folks) that included soup or salad and choice of potato? Enough said! If you're like me, then you've dined at many of the Vegas steak houses: N9NE, Strip House, Morton's, Delmonico's, etc. One thing is consistent among all of them - sides are sold ala carte. Not at The Steak House. Here, your $60 dollar steak includes choice of black bean soup (french onion for an extra charge) or salad and choice of potato. 

The black bean soup was accompanied by sherry wine and red onions. The explosion of flavors after adding the sherry and onions was fabulous! Their black bean soup definitely gives Georges ""famous black bean soup"" in La Jolla, CA a run for its money. I ordered the 12 oz filet butterflied. I regretted not ordering the 9 oz after eating one too many bites of the black bean soup. That said, the filet was delicious. I also got to taste the bone in ribeye. My oh my was that fantastic! 

The service was wonderful. They wait on you hand & foot and your glass will never be empty. The best part - the food comes out fast. 

Why only 4 stars? My garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely divine, however, they were served cold. I like my food piping hot. Not a problem, they quickly resolved the problem. Also, the restaurant was way too dark, making it difficult to read the menu let alone try to eat your food. It could also stand to be updated, but, then again, it is in Circus Circus.

I didn't have a reason to come back, except to try The Steakhouse, which had been bookmarked for awhile, but since I'm not a steak aficionado, it had been put on the back burner. 

We were seated at the bar for a glass of wine before dinner, our bartender was as old as the building, and I loved it. The decor was straight out of the 80's complete with floral walls, silk flowers and old wood paneling. We were seated in a corner booth, and to continue with the 80's theme, the booth was a lovely maroon color, contrast with the bookshelves above us. This is old school Vegas....not too cheesy. 

Bread basket was amazing, full of pretzel rolls (my favorite) and several different types of crackers and dinner rolls. I ordered the Petit Filet medium well, it was delicious. Perfect cut and temperature. What was amazing about this is, your dinner comes with vegetables AND choice of soup or salad, garlic mashed potatoes, rice or baked potato. All of this for $47. This isn't your typical a la carte steak house where your sides will run $10 each. 

Our server was great, what I noticed was, they leave you alone! Thank you! I don't need you to ask me every 2 minutes when I have a mouthful of food, if I'm ok. They deliver your food, and let you be.

3873115,2009-08-10,1,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"First of all, let's clarify the rumors....
Not all the MEAT is aged 21 days, only the Prime Rib is aged in the glass aging room.  The rest is pre-aged and pre-packaged, if you are close enough to the grill, you can watch them cut it open.  The meat is USDA Choice, not Prime cuts.  Those who know, will know the difference.  I ordered the bone in Ribeye medium rare, which was a bit more rare, bloody than normal. The texture was a bit tough and tasteless, just a chunk o meat.  They could at least sprinkle some salt or seasoning on it.  For $44, it was disappointing...I've had $6.99 steak specials that were just as good (bad)?  same? 

The black bean soup?  Pass... I'v made better bean soup myself.  The server saw that I barely touched it and asked how it was and if I wanted something else instead, like a salad.  So I tried the Ceasar salad which was good.  

The garlic mashed potatoes were gritty, like cream o wheat, weird taste to it.  The creamy horseradish was different, but good.  It had chives n paprika? sprinkled on top....

Also rumored was some kind of special coffee service, NOPE.... just cream n sugar....

Service was good, as to be expected, so they came through there.....

I have to assume that those who say this is a great steak restaurant haven't eaten anywhere better than the Sizzler, because compared to that, it IS a great steak restaurant.

But if you've ever eaten at any of the great steak restaurants around the country like Peter Lugar's or Mastro's or Joe's or Cut or Prime, then The Steakhouse at Circus Circus is barely okay, and perfectly situated for what it is: an ordinary, verging-on-gaudy place to eat beef.

But you know what? There's some perverse continuity here....because the rave reviews will continue...and it'll continue to remain a mystery as to why.

This was our very first time here, but we had heard great things about this place. The old school décor is great, I loved the dark room, the burgundy booths and the green walls. 
Our waiter took quite a while to take our order, but we weren't too upset since they did us a favor by taking us at 8 pm anyway. My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing, rib eye steak cooked medium rare, baked potato & salad, plus a bottle of wine. We received our salads promptly and they were great! We received our steaks about 30 minutes later and we were in awe at how beautiful the steak looked on the outside, but we were so disappointed on what it looked like on the inside. My steak was served to me well done. It was tough, hard to cut with a knife, and simply too over done. My boyfriend received a better cooked steak, but even his was more on the medium side than medium rare. Our waiter came back to check on us and asked about our steaks and at that time we let him know they were overcooked. He did ask if we wanted to send it back (which I don't know why you would ask that really. I ordered something I technically didn't receive, most places would just take it, apologize and get you a new one). 
We let him know that the wait time was just too much at that point to get another one anyway, we didn't want to wait another half hour or so. Honestly at this point I was so sad and disappointed. I wanted a romantic date night with my boyfriend, you know, steak dinner, wine, candlelight, but when you don't get it all, and it comes at a price, it really sucks. $66 dollar steak and I could have gotten a better one elsewhere for less. I really had high hopes! The place is so cool looking, it's surprising it's in such a lackluster casino. 
Once we gave up on our meals, our waiter offered a dessert on the house, but unfortunately at that point, no $10-$15 dessert is going to make up for our $132 we spent on 2 overcooked steaks. We just wanted to leave. Our tab for 2 rib eyes, a bottle of wine was $182.00! We would hope we would have at least received a discount, but no dice.
It was unfortunate, and I would think this is just a fluke, but I doubt I will return to this restaurant.",CllikgE-wYMk978LmKtYYw,0,0,1,8k890UxNsw146SrxozKlqg

From being rewarded to their pretty good rating I'm led to believe that we descended upon this restaurant on a really really bad night. I'll explain why in a moment...

The first thing I'll highlight is how reminded you will be that you're in a steakhouse... from all the Cow Decor, to the smell of the cooking beef wafting through the air, to the kitchen being smack dab in the middle of the dining room, to the various cuts of beef being hung on display. Honestly not one bit of this impressed me, but I was still optimistic because of their reputation. The place looks very dated and although it may have been really classy at one point... it just hasn't been long enough to give off a classic or vintage vibe.

Other than maybe the deserts you'll see that the presentation is pretty consistent with most other steakhouses...absent if you know what I mean. I feel like one should be able to dine with their eyes as well... you know... involve all of one's senses.

We all started off by sharing their complimentary bread: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#hnwoRKQPYrn_Sk1XKgOo3w which wasn't bad and served as a pretty good precursor to our impending meal.

I then had a bowl of their famous Bean Soup: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#8udUmTWVy5eHpBH03i56Eg I freaking love soup and this one was a very good example of a more rare soup that is available. I really enjoyed this and now really looked forward to my main entree in the form of...

Their Bone-In Ribeye: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#Y94ctMW52aSx_LHDxA2Z8g Now I'm fully aware they are more known for their Prime Rib, but not only am I not as big a fan of PR, but I just prefer the cut of a BIR and its wonderful marbling and flavor it normally possesses. I say normally because this place managed to deliver a steak that was devoid of flavor and just straight up tedious. I did appreciate the fact that my steak was cooked to my requested temperature of ""Medium-Rare."" It had some pretty nice grill marks on the outside and was fairly tender. The sides of green beans and baked potato were ""ok"" at best... again nothing fancy. Normally I would never crave Steak Sauce at a Steakhouse or Chophouse, but found myself wishing I had brought some in an attempt to wake this poor excuse for a piece of meat up! They managed to kill this poor cow twice!

To finish off this meal I felt like I needed something with flavor to make up for what I just consumed so I ordered their Tiramisu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#6DxGHudL6bhm0iwmePOzaQ which thank goodness was yet another spike up in the graph so to speak. This nice piece of Italian Cake was perfect in every way. it seriously had a nice balance of flavors, textures, colors, that were all rounded out to a beautiful presentation.

Service while kind was pretty forgettable. Our server did a really good job of conveying the fact that this was a job and any cordiality was more out of obligation.

There is plenty of parking at Circus Circus.

On this night we had received an experience that was totally reflective of the hotel it so comfortably sits in (also affectionately referred to as the ""Shits Carlton.)

I'm not ready to completely write this place off just yet... I just won't be rushing back with all of the great options in Lost Wages.",a7s-iv5ttk6jyHBVXt5ejA,3,1,2,iJvFNtJd_QlsuCTotaHuYQ
3971678,2012-03-02,3,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:

I have often read about how good this place is and I wanted to try it.  What better way than Restaurant Week.  

The bread basket had a very tasty piece of lavash, a seeded roll of some kind, a pretzel roll,  and two slices of raisin bread.  The raisin bread was also good and the basket came with the bread warmed.

Course 1:  I chose the black bean soup which was served with a small dish of chopped red onion and a tiny pitcher of sherry.  The onion added to the somewhat bland soup.  Since I don't do alcohol, I guess the sherry would kick it up a notch.  I depended on some salt.  It was a good starter.

Course 2:  I had to do the Filet Oscar and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a 12 ounce monster so go hungry!  I asked for it cooked black and blue and it was--nicely charred on the outside and blue from shivering on the inside.  These steak chefs know how to cook a steak the right way.  If you look at my photos, you can see the flaming grill.  My steak was in the middle of the flame for a short while.  The cook took some beef skin from a rib roast a put it on the grill.  When the fat dripping onto the mesquite flared up, he placed my steak in the middle.  With the steak came some nice king crab meat, two asparagus spears, and some excellent Bernaise.  I opted for the bake potato and the vegetable for the evening was baby carrots.  Before the entrée was brought, a server had delivered to the table a plate with 4 small dishes with chives, butter, sour cream, and bacon bits.  You could load up your baked potato, or not, any way you wanted.  I like the do it yourself style.

Course 3:  For dessert, they bring the dessert cart to your table.  There was a chocolate mousse cake, their take on Bananas Foster with the ingredients in a martini glass, cheesecake, some others I can't remember and the raspberry chocolate cake I ordered.  It was great!

My server was Mitch and he was an attentive and pleasant fellow.  I would have given this 5 stars but for a few things that caused my downgrade.  There was some crab shell in my king crab.  The carrots were very crisp--undone crisp--and were only lukewarm.  I was there at 5 when they opened so they weren't done enough yet.  Later as I watched the chefs place carrots on dishes, I could see the steam coming from them.  Finally, I had a long wait for an iced tea refill the first time I requested it.  Otherwise, service was good.

Note:  They do not take the M-Life card if you're using the purchase for tier credits.  For some reason (well we know why), Circus Circus is the poor stepchild of the MGM Resorts.  Your check will say use your M-Life card, but you can't.

I'll be back.  This is a gem of a place.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,4,4,_ELIkZYS4HwWfm9D_eT4-g

Going in this time, yup, still not my thing. Even this restaurant really looked awful - was very much questioning the decision of my foodie friend leading this group.

Sat down and they didn't get me a napkin. The waiter had never heard of Hendrick's gin. He screwed up the martini order. They misplaced every single one of our dishes (we weren't moving around or anything). The wine selection was not  that great.

And I absolutely don't care about any of that - the filet that I had was incredible. Cooked perfectly, and easily one of the best steaks I'd ever had - and the price wasn't bad (although, to be fair, we had eaten at Picasso the night before).

Arriving for our reservation, valet was kinda backed up, so my husband dropped me off while he went to park in the garage. The maitre'd greeted me promptly, seated me, and asked my husband's name so he could seat him when he arrived. On the way to our table, I was shown the meat room, which has all types of beef, including halves of cows, hanging up and aging. Cool. Service was friendly and efficient, from the bread basket to a bottle of champagne, to our meals, to the dessert cart. We had the petite filet and the ribeye and both steaks were excellent - seared on the outside and pink to red inside. The sides were good, and we really enjoyed the seafood platter appetizer. 

Even better than the 'classic-ness' of the Steak House is the value. We ate steaks with salads and sides (no a la carte here), a seafood appetizer, bottle of Moet, and cheesecake for $240 with tip.

I'm torn on 4 vs 5 stars because of the Circus Circus locale. That place is old and pretty gross, but in a way, that makes me want to give the restaurant its extra star. It remains at 4 for now, until I make an equally excellent return visit.

We took a cab down from our hotel on the Strip down to Circus Circus.  Let's just say I was apprehensive when we entered the rambunctious casino that was flooded with people - adults and kids alike.  I felt like I was truly at a circus, and I will admit I was seriously doubting any restaurant that would chose this place for its location.

Once we finally found The Steakhouse, when we entered, it was like we were transported to another world. I kid you not.  No noise, no craziness.  Just Frank Sinatra out of the speakers and fabulous light in the classically styled dining room.  We had a reservation (which we were a tad late for after wandering around the casino - but it was not an issue) and immediately were whisked past the beautiful dry-aging steaks and seated in a huge, cozy booth.  Perfect atmosphere! And, just like that, I was at ease and ready to celebrate my 32nd birthday with a feast!

Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive, but not overbearing.  We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir and chose the King Crab Legs on Ice to share.  Huge portions of crab and ample cocktail and tartar sauces.  The perfect starter; just enough not to fill you up.  Having already decided that we'd share a Porterhouse, we ordered it medium.  The portions are huge and there was no way we'd finish two entrees. One might consider this, especially since you are likely on vacation and a hotel room may not be the best place to enjoy steak leftovers!  I have heard, though, that if you ask them to slice it up before they box it, they absolutely will.  We each got our choice of sides - I chose a salad and a baked potato and my fiancé had their garlic mashed.  Everything was great.  Again, they served very big portions and you could tell they'd used quality ingredients.  It goes without saying that the steak was cooked to perfection.  We skipped dessert - a rarity - but nothing was beckoning on this particular night. 

Worth the price! Quite the experience! A hidden gem in Circus Circus!",eLFNqGIzWDX-97b4PBBgZg,0,0,5,APwtUPBCu51zEC-O-A5Etg

My girlfriend Jacinda and I went here on my birthday this past Monday, Mar. 7 and I must say that this place truly impressed us both. Honestly, from the bread, to our steaks, to our incredibly attentive and friendly waiter Mitch, it was high class through and through. We had ordered a French onion soup in addition to my petite filet mignon and my girlfriend's NY strip and everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The soup even came with an accompaniment of shredded cheese along with green onions and delicious garlic croutons. And speaking of that soup, our server had forgot to serve it to us after our salad and our steaks had arrived without any sign of the soup. Mitch was quick to apologize on the server's behalf and insisted to comp the soup and serve it to us along with our steaks. Of course, having a soup with the steak is a perfect combination and so I didn't mind enjoying this dish with our main meals. The m'aitre d also knew it was my birthday and so he also comped our deserts. I had the apple torte and Jacinda had a chocolate mouse pie. Both were a fine ending to a very classy and memorable 30th birthday! Only small knock would be the abbreviated wine list. While it is more than enough with some decent choices, I assume there are quite a few steakhouses around Vegas with much larger selections. I am no wine snob, but I do know that Gallo wines is quite basic and it was one of the reds on the wine list. However, the Clou Du Bois we enjoyed with our steaks was perfect, but don't go there expecting to be exposed to anything special.",wLrFItkS7vzrD0uEgF1BOw,1,1,5,xcIZdwr6WwLDm-QdJobjhg

Upon our arrival, we received a complimentary bottle of house wine, but that wasn't the best part. The steak, aged 21 days, was excellent. I'm impressed. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. The crab, oysters and shrimp appetizers were great too, but we were nearly full when the steak came. The service was excellent. The waiter checked in on us just the right amount of times and was very friendly.

Of course it's not the best location. Circus Circus was an old casino hotel. i used to come here so many times with my family when i was a young kid. it did bring back memories and seeing how much our lives have changed. Growing up poor and working our asses off and now we realized how much that hard working pays off and we are all living comfortably and happily.

I walked into the restaurant and you can smell the steaks. Smelled really good which got my stomach growling. I liked the old school vegas feel to the restaurant with the dim lights and mahogany colors. There was a grill in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the chef prepare the steaks which i liked a lot.

My dad ordered the NY steak, mom the filet, Mark the rib eye, and myself the king crab legs (since i knew i was going to have some of their steaks). all the steaks were cooked perfectly to our likings. I would NOT order the crab legs. they came out not too warm and for the price of $62.00 definitely not worth it! Staff was very friendly and nice. Our waiter reminded me of Drew Carry ehehee.

It's hard to really love this place since i've been to the best steakhouses like SW and Prime to name a few. BUT if you're looking for something good yet casual with an old school vegas this place is it.  The price is just the same as any other fine dining steakhouses though. so if you don't want to pay up to something like a fine dining steakhouse this place is not for you.",jIRgbpHbalnlcHMLEFQ9fg,3,2,3,Bm_qo_Cj0vhFrKPkuO1a3w

We were skeptical, but if you are going to find a great steakhouse in a peculiar place it will be in Vegas. 

We both ordered Filet Mignon, medium rare, and it was perfect. They offer a filet in two different sizes, and we ordered one of each. They both came out perfectly cooked and with a side of sauce, which was delicious but not necessary.  The side salad was delicious and the garlic mashed potatoes that came with our meals were creamy and flavorful. It was awesome. You should go!",ghurM6Pq0JVxqMIkQwE3eQ,0,0,5,ZVvfhR6AZMz70HndroS4YA

The food- steak is not dry aged for long. It is not terrible, but since I am from NY I am use to real steak from Peter Lugers. Perhaps if I did not compare this place to Lugers, I would think it was ok at best. The crembrule was not freshly made, no attention to detail.

Wedge salad was best part of dinner. 

I am not saying don't go here I am saying if you like the outback, you will love this place. If you are a steak person and know what a real dry aged steak is- you will be dissatisfied.",5q6ZCau0W_DnQPnlK9axgg,3,0,2,ZOrxLUGg_DhyiPHgEcJgvQ

It was actually one of the best steakhouses I have been to, and I am not a steakhouse girl. The bread was great. We skipped the appetizer, good thing because the dinner was huge. His steak has 1.5 lbs cooked! I had the salmon and it was delicious. The garlic mashed potatoes were amazing.

Surprisingly a really great place for an old school Vegas romantic dinner.

The drink... double Woodford Reserve on the rocks... a very generous pour and nothing but kiddos there..

The bread... they bring you out a variety basket of some truly different breads... problem is the bread was cold and so was the butter... sux eating medallion butters cold and not spreadable... one of these needs warmed up....

The salad... if I get a salad at a high end steak house I don't spect the salad to set the first impression bar high... this one failed on so many levels... first off they used standard packaged lettuce from a cheap dealer and half my salad was the hard white ""heart"" pieces of lettuce... the lattice cut carrots and cucumbers were a nice touch but the epic fail was the dressing.. the bleu cheese dressing was a bland almost ranch ... like they used hidden valley and sprinkled sub par finely chopped bleu cheese onto it.... 

The entree... bone in ribeye with steamed asparagus and a rice pilaf...kinda... the rice was well cooked and had decent flavor... the asparagus was nicely cooked with a little snap to it... the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare but lacked a great flavor... was just ok... it needed seasoned and for a 65 dollar steak it was a two cut steak(meaning two swipes of the knife to cut a bite off)... the steak in all aspects truly failed to believe... I have had better steaks at a longhorn steakhouse... 

Not saying it was a bad place but with so many great steakhouses in one place I'd deff go somewhere else and spend a $150 on a great meal...",83l2FpfSxvcQ_wlAeq5Fmg,4,0,3,9zAle2kUqW9rW4dyX2rhGA

Would recommend the peppercorn demi with your steak as they don't come with much seasoning per order but with the peppercorn is was excellent. 

See past the hotel being substandard relative to the new spots on the strip and check it out.

Head to the bar and get a nice classic cocktail, manhattan being my favorite, and take in the atmosphere with old school red bar seats.  

The meat here is 21 day aged beef on site, and you can see your meat when you walk in.  You'll then notice the grill, which is in the center of the restaurant, making your mouth ready to water.  Sit down and order a dozen or half dozen oysters, not always the best but always good enough.  Their servers are all mostly old schoolers too as well, and they know what they're doing.  Get a bone in ribeye or filet mignon, rare to medium rare, and sit back and wait for your salad.  The salads are good, as is the black bean soup, which comes with a shot of sherry.  French onion is usually too salty so not one of my favorites.  The main event is the meat, and it has yet to disappoint.

I was curious to see that a nice steak house existed at Circus Circus so of course I wanted to check it out! It's located in a row of vendors selling jewelry, purses and Hello Kitty items. Once you go inside you are transported to a place with nice dark wood and stuffed birds...old school decor. 

The first thing you see when you walk in is a big slab of beef legs hanging near the hostess podium. There was even a huge lobster in there. I didn't know if that was real or not but I wouldn't mind seeing it slathered in butter, garlic and lemon juice! 

I started off with the French Onion soup which had a nice gooey cheese. The broth was also tasty. I had the petite fillet for $41.00 which comes with your choice of potato and vegetable. I chose the baked potato and carrots. I tasted my husband's garlic mashed potatoes and wished I ordered that instead because they were amazing! The meat here is the star because it just melts in your mouth. The sides lack excitement but they taste good. 

Here's a tip: If you gamble at any of the MGM hotels you can use your comps to pay for the meal. I guess Circus Circus is like a stepchild to the MGM affiliated casinos. My aunt was able to comp her meal and my cousin's meal .",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,3,4,BJH44-IUzTOqtj9bRgYzEA

As described by others this place has that old time social club feel with the dark greens and reds set against the dark wood paneling. They have a simple menu with your choice of beef (rib eye, porterhouse, sirloin, etc.) Lamb, chicken or fish. Side dishes? what side dishes, I guess they don't believe in them other than sauteed mushrooms but that didn't distract me from my porterhouse with baked potato that came with a huge side of bacon! Everything was flavorful and the mesquite char was nice. Not as expensive as other high end steak places probably because of the lack of expensive sides and stuff but that wont stop me from recommending this place to others.",T_RiQ-TOeZf8N2kiCNCiSg,0,0,4,QTkM3JLoDGI0TW8ZVn6nHw

We came at a perfect time, we had no reservation and were lucky to be seated right away.

Service was great, and everything was served immediately. Our drinks from the bar came out right away, fresh basket of bread, and our salads too. Our steaks barely took a little bit longer. I enjoyed my bleu cheese salad very much, and my steak was very good too. My only complaint is that I ordered my steak medium, and it was more medium rare. Still very good though. My husbands only complaint was his steak had no flavor and he had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper. Other than that, I think we both enjoyed everything.

You walk in past the glass walled fridge /meat locker where I guess they age the steaks. There is a small cozy bar off to the side to wait for your reservation. The prices and portions are reasonable. The steaks are properly cooked to order. Some of our group whined that the steaks weren't  marinated or drowned in sauce. I find that a blessing.

4571224,2014-03-10,2,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"It had been 6 or so years since I last stepped foot in Circus Circus.  One of Eric R.'s best friends Aimee H. came to Vegas with her boyfriend, best friend, and another couple to celebrate her 30th birthday.  She invited Eric R., my brother Jeffrey L., and I to join all of them for dinner to celebrate her birthday at Circus Circus' The Steakhouse.  I was skeptical but went ahead and put on the same outfit I wore on my birthday (LBD with a giant bow in front and rainbow glitter heels with bows on them).  I was relieved to see carpet when my last memory was of the Adventure Dome's sticky floors.  We traversed through this casino to the restaurant, which immediately brought us into Old School Vegas, dimly lit with green sconces and lamps.

The three of us arrived first (and 15 minutes late for reservation) because we had locked our car and house keys in our place and thought we would have to cab it over, but our condo manager was nice enough to come over on a Saturday and give us a back-up key so we didn't have to sleep in the hallway.  The birthday group had troubles getting their car from valet at their hotel so they were late too.  The bread basket had pretzel rolls which made me happy, and the butter had Longhorns on each pad - Hook Em Horns!

Our server was Ray, specially requested by Aimee H. because her parents come here when in Vegas and he is the guy to have.  He was excellent!  Eric R. shared a bottle of Asti Spumante in celebration, but the rest of the table got free wine bottle coupons from a nearby table and got some house cab and chardonnay.

Eric R. and I both like filet mignon, so we opted to share a 12 oz filet, and he added a lobster tail.  There is a $15 split fee but Ray waived it because he is awesome.  The plates came with salad or soup, choice of mashed potato, baked potato, or rice, and asparagus.  I got baked potato and house salad, Eric R. got rice and Caesar salad.  My brother got the oysters on the half shell app (6 to order) and a petite filet.

The house salad had beets on it, which I immediately thought was cool.  Ray provided triple peppercorn and cheddar sauces plus all baked potato condiments on the side.  Our plates came out perfectly split (including the lobster, which I immediately return to Eric R.'s plate to make sure he was happy), and we got 6 oz of filet, plenty of asparagus, a lemon to squeeze wrapped nicely, and our side.  I was pleased to see fresh chives to add the potato.  I did a little butter, the cheddar cheese sauce (since there was no cheese condiment), and chives.  The combo was just perfect.

After our meals (where almost all of us took a to go bag), Aimee H. selected her free dessert from the cart (chocolate raspberry torte) and we sang to her with the candle lit.  Then we all nibbled on the dessert and left quite satisfied.  Overall, the cost was quite reasonable (Eric R. figured since we did not each get a steak, we could splurge on the wine), the food was good, and the service was amazing.

When I first looked at the menu, the high $$$ threw me off a bit but in the end, I recognized the value. Finally, a steakhouse where I can ask for medium rare and they actually bring out medium rare! One of my biggest pet peeves (aside from people who order medium well to well-cooked steaks) is when someone overcooks my steak, especially when the quality of steak is that good. 

If you enjoy lamb, I highly recommend the lamb chops. I ordered them medium rare and they came out extremely tender and flavorful. I can easily say they were the best lamb chops I've had in a long time. The prime rib is also excellent and based on opinions of others, the new york strip is their best (I just couldn't handle a piece of steak that ginormous!) The potato on the side was definitely a good choice. They bring out butter, sour cream, bacon bits, etc. in caddies so that you can create your own baked potato to your liking. The rice pilaf is also a fantastic choice if you prefer a lighter, more diet-friendly side dish. 

The servers are fantastic and attentive. 

I had a cosmopolitan with my meal and it was a bit strong, but delicious. It definitely complimented the heavy dinner that put me in near comatose. Overall, I must say this is a fantastic place to eat on a special occasion.... or when you're simply craving something a tad more than the Outback special.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,0,1,5,XU0rXbBuDFCBD4-B1_sTWg

4655327,2013-06-27,7,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Life could be funny. One hour I am eating at the bottom of the restaurant totem pole in Sam's Club and a few hours later I am eating at the top of the restaurant totem pole in the Steak House (in Circus-Circus). Life could be unfunny. After 22 years I was seeing my estranged aunt for the first time and learning about one star circumstances that happened on my mother's side of the family. To put it nicely I was very relaxed before the meal and will probably be writing a review on Todd English P.U.B in the near future.

  The Steak House is in Circus-Circus. This is an out of the way location if you are in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. If you are driving, the traffic could be heavy and the cab ride could be pricey. Owing to the fact that my Aunt was staying in the Aria, the Steak House was not my first choice. I would have gone for Ruth Chris's Steak House or someplace like Bubba Gump. However, my Aunt heard great things about the Steak House and really wanted to eat there. She did have a valid point. The Steak House claims in their web site to have been voted Best of Las Vegas for over 20 years and was named Zagat's 2011 Top Steak House in Las Vegas.

 My first impression of The Steak House is that it is extraordinary fancy. It is the antithesis of Circus-Circus. The lighting was just right. The décor was extraordinary elegant. And up to the time that the waiter never gave back the change, the service was commendable.

  My Aunt, brother, and I took advantage of the $31 Petite Filet Mignon special. Supposedly it is available throughout the month of June. The Petite Filet Mignon special started out with fresh baked bread. My taste buds greatly enjoyed it. I chose house salad with ranch dressing over black bean soup. My taste buds also greatly appreciated it. The Petite Filet Mignon special came with Chef's Fresh vegetables, which was a bowl of green stuff that I did not touch. From a choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato or wild rice blend; I chose the wild rice blend. My taste buds greatly appreciated the petite filet mignon at the same time that 1) they would have appreciated a bigger serving and 2) they experienced better steak at some other steak houses. The soda (or pop) tasted bland. The reality was that the dining environment added to the taste of the food. It was a dining environment ideal  for family members estranged after 22 years to catch up. As for the food, if I were to be given a blind taste test between their steak or Ruth Chris in a diner for example; I think it would be very close. I learned that in dining, a lot of the experience is the dining environment of the restaurant.

 Life is funny. I learned that I enjoy casual dining food as much as elegant dining food.  In my opinion the dining environment in the Steak House might be better than steak in casual dining restaurants when the food is just the same.

So we had the the Rib Eye Surf N' Turf with the King Crab Legs. I must say that I'm not a big fan of Steaks because they are usually too dry for me.  I am definitely not a seafood eater, but both of these entrees sure got me to reevaluate my order in the future at a fancy restaurant.

The price, however, it shows three stars on Yelp, so it's no surprises that it will be a little heavy. However, I guarantee you that it will worth every buck. In addition, each order is enough for two. 

Tips: The Onion Soup and the Galic Mash potatoes are also outstanding. Highly recommend that you make reservations,. especially during Holidays.

I was being generous at giving 3 stars because of the service. But clearly my photos taken establishes my ""rare"" steak to be over cooked in comparison to my wife's ""rare"" steak. However, the ineptitude of the MGM marketing person is either blind to social sarcasm or is immune to my generosity in spite of their inferior cooked meat. I, normally, do not downgrade any restaurant because of one small thing or another to be fair.

However, this is your speciality. Your reason for being. Ironically our company booked over 1200 rooms and all the ballrooms for our meetings last month at the Bellagio. While I may not particularly like aged meat, my wife does. I know what good aged meat is supposed to taste like as much as I know what good Mexican food tastes like. I don't care for either one as a personal choice but I do eat them. Instead of apologizing they spin it into a taste not to my liking when the underlying cause was their overlooked meat. Anything over cooked is not going to taste good. I am just glad I used Restaurant Week to try them out versus going during regular time periods or else I would be furious. Mistakes I can fathom but inept ignorance is unforgivable. By the way, MGM Marketing, we had a catered lunch for our employees today.

At times I could go ballistic if my meat comes out crappy. However since this was also my anniversary I kept my cool.
There are plenty of steak houses in Vegas. I never had any complaints at McCormicks down the street on Paradise/Flamingo.

Since the marketing persons response seems condescending I decided to give them a 1 star even though the restaurant itself deserved more. Service is always a important factor as much as the food.

--------




I finally went to this steak house after hearing about it through the years and reading my Yelp friends reviews. It is an old fashioned steak house as is its reputation. The place is decorated with old charm, red stuffed leather seating, bankers green and gold lamps. You are greeted at the entrance by the glass enclosed aging room next to the hostess station. Petra greeted me and was the same one who took my reservation at 2pm. We went at 7:30 and she was already turning people without reservations away or letting them know the slots open were after 9pm.

We ordered the Restaurant Week menu. I had house salad, petite filet, and chocolate mousse cake. Water is served via bottle. Bread rolls were brought out very quickly. They were a varied lot consisting of cheese sticks and different rolls. The salad was very good. I cannot recall what was in it though. The filet came out medium rare and not rare that I wanted. They got the better half's meat right. Some pieces of crab meat in sauce laid on top of the meat. Baby asparagus on the side. I chose wild rice as the other accoutrement. It was wild and al dente. I am not Italian so I usually eat my rice cooked, al fully cooked. But I don't mind. It gave a nice texture. It had small chopped mushrooms, along with the wild seed looking things that a whole foods eater would be accustomed to. I am not in the fancy wild rice crowd.

The meat was good. The rare was cooked buttery, from my better half's plate. Not a fan of aged meat to be honest. A nicely cooked ribeye would have been better.

The chocolate mousse cake was one of the best I've eaten. Very velvety and just the right amount of sweet. It was more than I could handle so we shared one and took one slice to go. We didn't even finish the one we started on.

The service was too notch. They were very attentive and quick. I felt bad seeing how they had to walk up and down the stair as well as seeing the busboy lift a whole tables worth of dirty dishes and glasses in one sling.

What can I say? It was good but I don't think I will go back again.  I don't see a hankering to go back to this or another aged steak house. Kind of like Ruth's Chris. This is better than them but I tried it and that was pretty it. I rather go back to a sushi restaurant or have a $20 prime rib. McCormick and Schmicks does better steaks IMO. Aged meats only taste good if cooked correctly. Everyone was working hard including the poor guy who had to fire up all the steaks. He seemed like a pro, feeling the meats temperature as they cooked and adjusting. He seemed way too tall for the cooking station tho.

The clientele were mostly silver foxes...my parents and grandparent types. The hostess said we were very young and we pretty much were the youngest people there. So all in all, a classy quaint place. Now I can tell my dad that I've eaten at his favorite steak house and I am not that impressed to be honest.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,4,1,1,kY9Ym74dc_kWXhWunCyxSQ

Can't believe this place is in this location as if it was anywhere else forget about it.   It was however packed on this Friday night.

A View of the meat locker where they 21 day age their ""CHOICE"" not Prime steak is interesting as all cuts are done on premise.

Start with 2 Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail each $40.00 for 8 pieces brilliantly displayed with ice, lemon and mayo & cocktail sauce with Atomic pure horse radish on the side.  Delicious shrimp. 

All entrees include soup or salad,  choice of Garlic mashed, baked potatoe, or wild rice and vegetables. 

Salads were ice cold with crumbled blue cheese dressing.  Very nice presentation with fresh lettuce and vegetables. 

Entrees:

Giant Fred Flintstone Bone in Prime Rib that was absolutely mouth watering. 

The Giant Filet Mignon & Bone In Rib Eye were  good while  the NY Strip was like the prime rib Standouts.

Garlic mashed were excellent while baked potatoe was average. 

Cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake for desert were excellent as well. 

Service some of the best I've seen and price points for food consumed incredible.  Manager Ron Randazzo stopped by to say hello and chat with us after our meal.

Not worth the money at all! The entire time we were eating the server did not check in us even one time. We were done eating for 20 min, at least, before he came and gave us the check.

It's rare to find a nice steak house that doesn't sell the sides separately. The asparagus was just okay, but the mashed potatoes were delicious! 

My fiance ordered the black bean soup to start and it was pretty good. For his entree he had the Bone in Rib Eye. It was very tender, but too fatty for my taste. That's why I always stick to the Filet. 

We shared Tiramisu and chocolate covered strawberries for dessert. The Tiramisu was good but the strawberries were amazing. I could have eaten a dozen of them.

Yes, you have to work your way through the ""Circus"" crowd but in the end it is well worth it. My dad's boss is a Vegas resident and swears by the place which is where we got the idea to go. We were down from Reno for the UNLV-Nevada game and wanted to have a good dinner without the Vegas price tag. We are college students so all the high priced ""stewey"" steakhouses were out of the question. 

Walking in you get the feel of an old school steakhouse which is what we wanted. The smell of beef slaps you in the face the moment you get to the receptionist. 

We also wanted a place where dress was considered. We wanted to celebrate and look nice doing it! Some reviews on here have stated that people walk in with shorts and button up shirts...This wasn't the case when we went. Every person in the restaurant was dressed ""up"".

I'm not going in depth about the food because I'm not a food critic and won't pretend to be one, but to sum it up we all had Filet's and they were cooked to perfection. The best part about this place is that your steak actually comes with a side and salad!

You may think that Circus Circus doesn't have anything to offer but you are wrong. The steakhouse has an old time Vegas feel and is probably the best thing that the casino has to offer and the reason it stays open.

Our service was great! And she was from Buffalo as well which is always cool to talk to people from the same hometown. 

For $50 you were able to get French Onion soup or salad, Filet Oscar and your choice of dessert. Considering the filet is normally over $50 this is an amazing price.

I decided to go for the french onion soup over the salad. Even though it was summer and very hot out I can never refuse french onion soup. It was very tasty and filling.

The filet oscar was awesome. For those who don't know oscar style is filet with crab meat on the top along with a sauce. This came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes were so good. I had leftovers that I made sure to eat the next day! I didn't finish my meal mainly because I had to leave room for dessert

For dessert I went with the chocolate cake. It was a big toss up between that and the chocolate covered strawberries but the cake won. It was so good! It was a large piece so I was able to take some of that home too.

The only downfall was that everything was served too close together. I like when things are brought out with a bit of a wait in between so you are able to digest before your next course comes around. The soup and main course came so close together that by the end I felt so full I almost opted for dessert to go. 

I was so glad I was able to enjoy this during restaurant week. Great food for a great deal. For those who go at anyother time of the month it's a great steakhouse but with being a great steakhouse comes cost.

Our reservations were made for us on the date and time that we specified through the Sales Department. Goofy as I can be sometimes, I remembered the date but not the time so I had to call the restaurant from our hotel room (yes, we stayed at Circus, Circus; check my separate review on that). The hostess answered, found my name right away and confirmed that we were due in at 6:30pm and was that time okay or did we need to make an adjustment? I told her that we would be there at 6:30.

We arrived on time and were immediately greeted and taken to a booth where menus and a wine list were presented. Our waiter's assistant came by with a bread basket and poured still water for us. He assured us that Felix, our waiter would be by shortly.

Felix arrived with a friendly smile and what I would call an abundance of old school charm. He took our drink orders. When he returned with the drinks, he asked if we had any questions or were ready to order. 

I had two questions. The first was regarding the appetizer Seafood Sensation and what all was included on it. He said that it came with four oysters on the half shell, four prawns and four Alaskan King Crab legs. Okay, we can do that please.

My other question was whether their prime rib was salt encrusted or rosemary encrusted. For that question, he went and asked the chef to be sure. When he returned, he told me that it was salt encrusted rather than the rosemary which I preferred.

I went with the prime rib anyway. Rare. Bone-in. 32-ounces. House Salad with Blue Cheese. Baked Potato, loaded. It also came with Chef's Vegetables which was buttered asparagus. When my entrée was served, the hunk of prime rib was so rare and so tall that heads turned either to admire it or in fear as it went by. It was absolutely fantastic! The Au Jus served with the beef wasn't the typical thin, over salted brown water served at so many restaurants but a thicker concoction with a depth of flavor that was simply wonderful.

She had the Rib Eye. Medium Rare, Bone-in. Not nearly as large as mine. The rest of her meal was the same as mine. 

I asked Felix to slow down the timing of our meal. With such a large appetizer, we didn't want to get swamped with the salads and the entrees. He was kind enough to ask us when he took away the carnage that we created with the Seafood Sensation, how long we wanted to wait for the salads to be served. We were primed and ready to go and I asked him to bring them on!

The Seafood Sensation was very good. Everything was served sitting on a bed of ice and well chilled. The oysters were big and meaty as were the prawns. The King Crab legs were a bit misleading in that instead of four legs, we received four 1/2 legs. Each leg had been split down the middle on a band saw. A minor quibble, we had plenty to eat and it was all delicious! We each also  received a small plate with a 1/2-lemon wrapped accordingly to keep the lemon pits from falling onto our food. There was also a container of Cocktail Sauce as well as a container of Mayo/Creamed Horse Radish?. On the seafood display, there was another small container of Horse Radish.

For dessert, we split a Bananas Foster and each had a cup of coffee.  

Between Felix and his assistant, we were very satisfied with the service. During dinner, she had Iced Tea while I had a Diet Soda. Anytime our drinks were down to about 1/3 full, they were replaced with a fresh drink. 

Yes, we exceeded our $150 certificate budget by nearly $100 including tip and tax but I will always remember that beautifully hunk of loveliness that was presented to me.",FV8qKMVjuufEf4ys9MxIkA,6,4,5,ejxNks9Hq48De8r6AnwQBA

The lobster was so good, as it was served with fresh melted butter. This steakhouse is a little bit on the pricey side considering it is in Circus Circus away from the main strip.

The filet was predictably out of this world, perfectly cooked and aged.  The asparagus was okay but not excellent because it was not crisp enough.

The service was superb.  It is what you'd expect from a 5 star steak house.  We had a rambunctious 2 year old with us and they didn't bat an eye.  It was Circus Circus so there were many kids there.  Parents, think. you can bring your crazy little kid to a proper formal restaurant!

We had chocolate covered strawberries and they didn't charge us for that either.  Yum.",Vh3XdOLujwPsUWygXQNO_w,3,1,5,EcUJwklPpgsRRzaR6Xz8mg

Black bean soup is first rate and as everyone says it's the best. 
Steak was a strip cooked perfectly. It was not overly seasoned or salty and I think a good steak stands on its own. This one was great.
Mashed potatoes were first rate. 
Baked potato was not great. Very average. I ordered it and wish I got something else
Asparagus was good, average except my wife's portion was small. Should have complained but didn't. 
We had great martinis - standard for a steakhouse. 
We had a wonderful slice of chocolate mousse cake. It was excellent. 
Best of all service was A+ as Roberto and his helper were prompt and helpful throughout the meal.  
Lots of steakhouse competition in Vegas and they are all expensive. This one was excellent and for the money a real value for what you get.",eLs2_UyrbuSGrb9YIoqqIw,1,2,5,pel9a6HdYQqfCssRzhleWQ

Reservations were made to air on the safe side.  The restaurant was dark when we arrived.  The meat aging room was right behind the host podium which was pretty neat.  We were seated in the lower area where we could see the grill.  This place had the steak house atmosphere, but definitely could use some redecorating, but considering it is located inside Circus Circus, we did not expect much.  Our server at first did not seem too thrilled since we had our toddler son with us, but she warmed up a bit throughout the service, especially after he behaved for most of the dinner and we left her a nice tip.  At first she had an expression that seemed to imply that she was disappointed and trying to guess if we were one of those people that would use a comp and not tip accordingly...as a former server, I have always been sensitive to this and we generally tip pretty well if the service is at least decent.  The Hispanic man who brought us our bread, beverages, cleared our tables, and packed up our leftovers did most of the work so we hoped that she shares the tips with him.  This was probably one of the best steaks we have had.  The bf ordered the Porterhouse medium well and I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, it is not every day that we are able to go to a place that actually knows how to cook steaks the way they are ordered.  The steaks are aged 21 days here and yes, we could taste the difference.  We opted for baked potatoes which came with the condiments to share on the side-sour cream, butter, chives, bacon.  Vegetables were sauteed baby carrots.  The salad was decent, but the blue cheese dressing was amazing with large chunks of blue cheese.  Our only complaint would be that the bread was cold...and to our disappointment, there were no cow-shaped butter chunks as seen in the other Yelp reviewers' pictures.  We were able to order dessert as well and the total came out to around the price of the comp.  The desserts were a bit disappointing, nothing to write home about and we will definitely do without next time.",p3rQEm0gp2UsR4Rwh6FirA,2,2,4,82exTs9NZbc0Rg5EgaqtTQ

5094934,2015-03-15,18,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"The classic steakhouse of yesteryear.  

You remember, the kind of place where starters were chilled seafood cocktails.  The place where you could have any kind of soup you wanted as long as it was French onion.  Where every entrée came with a salad, a starch and cooked veg.  Where seasoning wass just salt and pepper atop slabs of fire grilled beef, lamb, chicken or fish.  Where ballin out of control meant a big a$$ lobster.

Welcome to THE Steak House.  Yes, it's in the little black sheep of the MGM empire, home to the $25/night room.  Sure the décor is slightly dated and the servers show their patina.  It's still Vegas baby and it delivers.

Starters are simple.  Well cooked, chilled, sweet, jumbo shrimp served with a simple albeit horseradish heavy cocktail sauce; a steakhouse classic.  The French onion soup, showing a great beef broth undertones blending with sweet caramelized onions and sporting the perfect, broiled gruyere cheese topping.

To the real stars, the steaks.  All 21 day, dry aged on site.   Well trimmed.  Four cuts, all grilled over an open mesquite fire.  Excellent sear and always to temp.  The bitterness of the smoke does obscure the subtle umame undertones of the aged beef.  All good.  In the end, it's like a USDA prime backyard BBQ.   Top props to the porterhouse with the bone in ribeye a close second.  Something different?  The bone in prime rib is as good as any.  Juicy, tender, not as well trimmed as the ribeye but classic in every respect (fat is flavor).

Sides are, well sides.  Baked potato with the works, perhaps cooked carrots or asparagus.  No complaints.

Respectable wine list with low Vegas resort markup.

5275221,2012-03-06,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"Went here for the inaugural Spring Restaurant Week in Las Vegas. Figured I lived in Vegas long enough that I should check out Circus Circus at least once and with all the accolades THE Steak House has received, I could kill two birds with one stone.  First off, parking at Circus Circus isn't that great. Both garages were closed?; I would have probably been better off valeting. Also, go in off Industrial as opposed to the Boulevard as that would have been much easier as well. 

Now the important stuff... the food. Great bread basket. I love carbs and a good bread basket and this one had a great assortment. For the appetizer, the Caesar salad was awesome. One of the best I've had. I was also told by a member of our party that the French Onion soup was the best they ever had as well. Good start. The main course was Filet Oscar: a 12oz filet topped with king crab and bearnaise sauce. I probably would have preferred to have the crab as an appetizer and just ate the filet separately as I think the toppings took a bit away from the filet. I ordered it medium and it was good but wasn't the best filet I ever ate. Another member of the party got medium-rare, I ate part of that, and I felt it was much better than my medium despite me not normally liking rare. I'll give the medium filet a 3.5 and the medium rare filet a 4. As for desert, there were plenty of great looking options on the cart. Everyone got something different and no one complained. I had a raspberry chocolate cake which was way too big after what I had already eaten and  was a real good way to end a meal. Nothing went to waste.

All in all, I went in feeling under the weather but left stuffed and content, definitely happy with my Restaurant Week choice this time around. So far with my Restaurant Week choices, I'll put THE Steak House above Palm Restaurant however I don't think I can quite put it above the Capital Grille.",as34MUkSmX14WqHtOo0DLg,0,0,4,M7ZXUGnJr_nB9rmCNHDWPQ

5282073,2017-02-03,2,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"The good - My server was personable and attentive.
The bad - My steak was desperately lacking in seasoning.
The meh - The whole atmosphere feels rushed and not very welcoming.

I really wanted to like this supposed ""hidden gem"" in the downscale Circus Circus.  It had all the hallmarks of a good old fashioned, throwback steakhouse in a city full of glitzy temples of beef worship.

Unfortunately THE Steakhouse fell short.  

I'm a firm believer that your experience as a diner begins at the host desk and the woman running this show was hurried and not friendly or especially welcoming.  Instead of greeting me she remain glued to the monitor as she asked for my name.  Wow, am I bothering you?  Your major job is greet people (fail!) and to know what tables you have and where tables are in service.  Stop relying on the computer and use your brain.

I had to wait for my table but to be fair I messed up my time and arrived an hour early.  A man who was also working the host stand - manager? - managed to get me in a little early and that was very much appreciated.  BUT!  I decided to wait in the bar and despite sitting at the banquette for 45 minutes the bartender never once acknowledged me or inquired if I wanted a drink.  There are 10 seats at the bar.  He can't possibly be that busy.

I do like the decor of THE Steakhouse.  Lots of wood panelling and rich green walls with dimly lit wall sconces.  Unfortunately the harried rushing around by the staff is at odds with the private club vibe.

I was finally summoned to my table by the man-host.  He walked briskly ahead of me and left me to keep up.  When he got to my table he sort of half-heartedly pulled my chair out, dumped the menus, and was on his way back to the host stand before I even arrived at the table.  He did toss a ""enjoy your dinner"" over his shoulder as he hurried past me.  

Not feeling especially welcome but resigned to at least enjoy a good steak, I settled myself in and was promptly greeted by a back-waiter who delivered some water.  Side note - an one of my pet peeves - it only takes a few seconds longer to make sure a table is set neatly with the silverware aligned and the lamp and salt and peppers neatly placed.  This table looked like it had been reset on the hurry with the silverware sloppily placed.  The salt and pepper were all the way at the edge of the table where they had been pushed to reset the table and the lamp shade was crooked.  First impressions people!

Left to my own devices I started perusing the menu.  It's not an especially expansive selection but it's got something for everyone.  I was on the hunt for steak and that's where I headed.  New York Strip, Porterhouse, Bone-in Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, and Prime Rib with two sizes.  All steaks come with a choice of soup or salad, potato or rice, and daily veg.  I opted for a Porterhouse with a $6 upgrade to the Bleu Cheese Wedge, baked potato and asparagus.

Next up the wine list.  Disappointing is the word that comes to mind.  I think any good steakhouse should have an equally good wine list.   Here I found a limited by the glass selection with no vintages listed and the main list was an odd collection that looked like it was either leftovers from a previously good list or was put together for the restaurant by a beverage rep - an all too common occurrence.  At an rate, I ordered an adequate but forgettable cabernet by the glass.

After ordering and receiving my wine, I settled in to wait for dinner to commence.  A basket of bread was delivered and another cardinal rule was violated.  What the hell am I supposed to do with ice cold butter?  I can't spread it.  Butter should always be served at room temperature.  Details are the make or break for a good restaurant.

My salad was delivered promptly and was pretty good.  Excellent ratio of dressing to lettuce and the bleu cheese and bacon crumbles were tasty.  But once again there's a big old ""but"".  Do not bring my entree while my salad plate is still sitting on the table and then swap them out.  Clear my salad plate.  Give me a few minutes to enjoy my wine and then deliver my steak.  I really hate being rushed like that in a supposedly good restaurant.

And, the steak.  First the good - it was cooked perfectly for temperature and it was a respectably hefty size  But, for a supposedly 21-day dry aged steak there was almost no aged flavor and the lack of seasoning was absolutely shocking.  I shouldn't ever have to reach for salt and pepper for a steak and this one forced me to do that.  It was also dry and honestly pretty disappointing for $66.  Not bad, mind you.  Just not especially good.  The accompanying potato and asparagus were ordinary but tasty but when the main attraction falls short the supporting players can't save the experience.

So.....needless to say I'm not going to be rushing back to THE Steak house.  Oh, hell.  Let's be honest - I'm never going back.  For $120 out the door for one person I'll take my $$$ somewhere else.",uLy-ZgRLEmqWNxrscaXa6w,3,0,2,wXnkMdsDkPiL1qq26JuGtA

There are a few places I really enjoy eating at where the location is less than attractive. If anyone's ever been to San Francisco and wants the absolute hands down best local Vietnamese food ever, Tu Lans is the place to be. The problem? Well its on 6th and Market which is probably one of the worst streets in San Francisco. Now back to The Steak House. Whats wrong with the location? Well... Its smack dab in the middle of the Circus Circus Hotel Casino. Not a place one would picture a steak house thats been voted ""Best of Las Vegas"" 18 years in a row. The minute I roll up to the Circus Circus, I immediately feel over dressed... Not that jeans, dress shoes, button down shirt would be over dressed anyone else in Vegas... After fighting off what seems like 1000 kids from the parking lot to restaurant, the whole atmosphere changes once you're in The Steak House. This place is like the other top notch steak houses. Classy. Definitely classy. We get seated and immediately feel like we're a million miles away from the Circus Circus. The waiter suggests the Rib Eye and who I am to argue with a professional. We also order the Prime Rib which could easily feed 3-4 asian girls. The meal starts with the standard fare, a variety of breads and a house salad (or the soup of the day). And at the exact moment that the aged meat arrives cooked to perfection, all our previous gripes about the location, getting here from the parking lot, and fighting off all the little kids seem to dissipate.

We were so excited to go that we went all out when we ordered. We got the seafood platter as an appetizer, which was HUGE. Definitely too much to share between just 2 people before a steak meal. The platter included shrimp, oysters, and crab legs. All of which were just okay.

For our entrees, I ordered the porterhouse and my boyfriend ordered the bone in ribeye. Each meal comes with either a soup or salad to start, vegetables on the side, and your choice of potatoes (mashed or baked) or rice pilaf as accompaniments. We ordered our steak mid rare, of course, but mine came out more on the medium side. I'm not one to send food back so I settled with what I had. 

Honestly, to me, the steaks were kinda dry and not very flavorful. I've definitely had better at other steakhouses. I guess what people love about this place is that, for the price of the steaks, you can't go wrong. They are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than most other steakhouses, but I personally tasted that.

The interior is typical, dark steak house but you really do fee like you have been transported back in time. Maybe it was the Sinatra tunes playing. Anyway, the food. The food was amazing. I ordered the New York Strip and boy was is it a strip! I was expecting the size to be about half of what it actually was because I am used to these newer, fancier steak houses getting greedy with portions. Not the case here. I ordered it medium well and it was cooked to perfection. My strip came with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Nice sides but the New York Strip was the star of the show.

She commented that, among locals, this is where to find the best steak in town - and it has been voted best steakhouse for seven years straight. I wholeheartedly agree.

First of all, forget that you are at Circus Circus. Ignore the smoky, rundown feel of the casino and head straight for the restaurant. The ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a Vegas steakhouse: dark, intimate, and quiet. The servers are fast and seem to fade away into the background, creating an environment where you can just focus on your company and the food.

The wine list is on the small side but curated with a finesse for steakhouse fare. The soups, salads, and sides are also very complementary classics that you would want to find on a steakhouse menu.

I had the petite filet. I received a perfect medium rare, with the right amount of salt and pepper to bring out the best of the meat. The peppercorn sauce should be bottled and sold; the garlic mashed potatoes were better than anything I could make at home; and, the asparagus with brown butter was the definition of crisp-tender.

And the desserts...oh, the desserts. YUM! We had a party of five so we just ordered one of each dessert. Nothing says dessert at a steakhouse like decadent chocolate cake, cheesecake, tiramisu, and chocolate-covered strawberries. What a delight!

Don't go to THE Steak House expecting some giant, overblown menu like most of the places in Vegas; go with the expectation that you will get the best cut of meat and the best sides that Vegas has to offer. Everything is cooked with expertise and the service is outstanding. This is THE place for steak.",YNkbvkPhLMFlOFYH2PLMwA,6,2,5,wOvYHm6K6LBp9aVGnb1-vg

I'm a Chauffuer on the strip and have done a couple of rides for people in a limo coming for dinner...

Curiosity got the better of me and I had to come try it out. I don't personally recommend a place unless it's either highly recommended, word of mouth or I have firstly tried it out myself....

Service was slow, there were no cocktail or desert menus.

We started with some fresh breadsticks and a variety of dinner rolls, some with raisins. The sweet raisin bread rolls seemed oddly out of place... perhaps a sundries tomato filling or garlic and herbs if anything would have been more palatable than raisin buns...   

I don't want to order a cocktail and get slammed with a $40 charge for a drink that may or may not have ice flown in from some glacier somewhere.

Or a mystical $35 charge for a Creme Brûlée that was harvested and helicoptered in from Mt Brûlée....

I enjoyed my House Salad, nicely presented with Red Wine Vinaigrette. I would dare to say as a tip perhaps get the Vinaigrette on the side. It was a bit zesty for my liking.

My partner loves French Onion soup and tried the Surcharged French Onion soup instead of the house salad. He's comments on the soup that he did not finish was a pokey tongue raspberry sound....

Fresh cracked pepper was offered on the salads only...

My Steak was cooked well, as ordered, a good Medium cook. Seemed to lack some good flavor. Was just blah.

Broccolini was nicely steamed crisp to the bite, lightly seasoned.  

Garlic Mash was essentially boring. Nothing special. Forgetful.

Drink refills were slow and the booth was pretty crammed for a party of 4.

My main issue with The Steak House at Circus Circus was the quality of meal for the money.

At around $100 a person there are at least 2 quick references I would recommend hands down over sending someone here.

I can not personally recommend this place.

Glad I tried it out for myself and that I would not wrongfully suggest this steakhouse to others....",X6wbOm865HPjS94-yMXT9Q,7,2,2,7xMxznhGGhhEjRzWPuOC3g

Brad ""Mr. International"" T. & I decided to come here because this was something he has always wanted to try. Also, we needed some red meat after not eating any red meat for 3 months! I was hungry for some good steak! 

Courses. 

First course: Caesar Salad - (2.5)
It tasted like any other caesar salad and it wasn't something that I was impressed by, I could have made a better caesar salad. 

Second Course: Filet Oscar -  Mesquite Grilled Petite Filet Mignon Topped With Alaskan King Crab Meat, Asparagus And Hollandaise Sauce.  With a side of loaded baked potato  (3.8)
I was super excited to try it and have some good steak! I ordered my filet medium rare & maybe I should have asked for it to be rare instead. It was a bit overcooked, but it still tasted great!  However, I wasn't a big fan of the hollandaise sauce. :( It was way to creamy for me or maybe I just dont like hollandaise sauce at all.  The carb meat tasted delicious. I loved it so much! The loaded baked potato was simple and ordinary.  They  put all the sour cream, butter, bacon, and chives on another plate.  Which was pretty cool because you determine how much you want on your baked potato.  

Dessert: There was a variety of desserts that you can choose from. Yay! From the choices I remembered there were creme brulee, another type of creme brulee, banana foster in a martini glass, chocolate cake with raspberry, and a few others.
Brad T. got the banana foster and I got the chocolate cake with fresh raspberry! 
Banana Foster in a martini glass (5) 
It tasted amazing, THE BEST banana foster crepe-like I had ever had.  It was perfection! 
My chocolate cake with fresh raspberries (4): It was very moist and I loved the raspberries.


Service (5): They were amazing and always filling your drinks, checking up on you,and professional!  

Atmosphere (4): very old-school vegas, with the red leather seats/booths, but I really liked it. They had deer heads mounted on the walls, but good thing there wasn't too many of them, then that would be over-kill.  I remember counting only 2, but then I realized there was another section of the restaurant.

We had originally wanted to try out Gordon Ramsey's steak house when we were in town, but when our friend inquired about reservations for a Saturday night, they were (not surprisingly) fully booked.

When our friend Chris told us he made reservations at this place, I was taken aback since it's been at least twenty years since I stepped foot on the Circus Circus property nor had much of a desire to on this trip.  Oh well, we decided to leave our hesitation behind and try this place out with an open mind.

This restaurant has been around for ages and when we told our taxi hailing guy at Vdara to hail a cab for us to go to Circus Circus, he said it was an excellent choice for a steak dinner and supposedly all the big wig Vegas honchos still dine there.

When we arrived, our friends were at the bar enjoying a few cocktails.  It felt a little dated in there, but more classic than old trendy if that makes any sense.  There was lots of emerald green walls, burgundy booth seats and lots of hunted animal heads decorating the walls nearby.

Our server was attentive and kept our water goblets consistently filled with bottled Arrowhead water at no extra charge.  I liked how the meals were accompanied with soup or salad, baked potatoes or garlic mashed potatoes and a side of veggies. Since the veggies served that night was asparagus, it was accompanied by some yummy Hollandaise sauce on the side.

I opted for the eight ounce filet since that was more than enough for my appetite.  All their steaks are aged for 21 days and when I took my first bite into my steak, I was a very happy girl.  It was seasoned nice and cooked to medium perfection.  I enjoyed my steak so much that it made me glad that reservations at Gordon Ramsey's uber expensive restaurant didn't work out for us.  I also enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes and the asparagus, but the garden salad I had before all of this was just okay.

Overall we had a great meal and I liked how I was able to charge our part of our meal to our room back at Vdara since it was all part of the same corporate umbrella.  My room reservation included a $50 dining credit thanks to making my reservation through AmEx's travel site, so I'm glad it went toward a meal I actually enjoyed.

Would I go back here to enjoy a nice dinner?  I actually would.  For it to be around for as long as it has, it speaks volumes that it can weather the storm in it's not so fancy hotel despite all the other competing, pricier steak restaurants opening up on the ever changing Strip.",R_S07piLpe_LHU0yKyYOzg,3,1,4,aBcnHgZtzOtpnNjDZDs--w

Huge shrimp cocktail.
Oysters on the half shell.
One Ribeye steak.  I'm going to say it was at least 24oz.
Double Lobster Tails, easily 10oz to 12oz each.
Split up the salads, choice of dressings.
Two baked potatoes, and they threw in a third at no charge because that's the kind of place this is!  

We could barely finish the steak and lobster we were so full.  Everything was outstanding.  They brought out a nice piece of chocolate cake for our Anniversary.   I had a lemon drop martini and the Queen of Reseda had a glass of Pinot Noir.

The bar is wonderful, healthy pours with an older gentlemen there that is personable and inviting. Problem however: you can't order from the menu at the bar. You can only order apps, which are all seafood. The FINEST steakhouses in Texas has - albiet limited- the ability to serve something once furry and don't make you look like a loser sitting in the main dining area by yourself, amongst dozens of couples and big-tops full of people laughing and pointing at you.

Now to the steaks: They have all the right stuff, the right cuts, the right cooking techniques, the right char-grill with real mesquite wood. But they miss something that I think sets Texas steakhouses apart from this place. Well, two something's actually. 1. Spice. 2. Thickness. If it's spicy, it has this thing.. oh, what's it called.. oh FLAVOR.. That's the word I'm looking for! And, if it's cut thicker, you can sear the outside for a nicer cool rare center. I wanted a rare steak, and was talked into the porterhouse due to how it would ""render"" in the bone and they said they would char it to perfection. 

Bullshit.. the perfect steak isn't burnt. It's seared. The perfect steak has flavor. Not just a dry aged (although I agree a nice cut) tossed on a grill then splashed with water to put the flames out. 

All was not lost however, it was a fair dining experience as the wait staff were so fast and courteous, and the drinks were poured right. The potatoes, asparagus, and side salad were magnificent and they don't make you wait for anything. 
Will I go back, probably.. but this time I'm throwing a c-note to the waiter to go hand-select my steak, cut it to my specifications, and throw some cracked black pepper at least and maybe some salt on it and bring it out seared - not flame fried. 

Oh, and the desert tray looked divine - but I chose a nice digestif for desert instead.",6qOespkLEMJYrvPv8fFTOA,1,0,4,GOR3OCCrEcmtyBcn8oCiaA

It's almost impossible to believe this place exists within the confines of Circus Circus, which in my opinion should be imploded at the first available opportunity.  This steakhouse is simply phenomenal.  

Fantastic atmosphere, amazing service, perfectly cooked food, and you don't feel like they're trying to nickel and dime you for every little thing.  On top of that, the prices are reasonable compared to the other top-quality steakhouses around.

I agree with other posters that the parking is horrid and this casino is not the safest place to be on the strip.  We had a long, scary walk from the parking garage to the restaurant.  Once we arrived, the staff was so nice and immediately acknowledged our 25th wedding anniversary.  We have eaten here many times and have always had stellar service.  Not this time....not horrible service but certainly not what we have experienced in the past.  Hubby and I both ordered filets and I ordered a lobster tail (I always get the same thing when I eat here).  Our salads were good but the dressing on mine was so heavily laden with vinegar that I could not eat it.  I even asked for blue cheese dressing to add to my salad in the hopes I could salvage it but that was also a fail.  My husband was fine with his salad and he enjoyed his steak which was prepared correctly.  Mine was not prepared as I requested but I did not send it back (I should have).  The lobster tail was the real problem.  I noticed when the waiter pulled it from the shell to serve it to me that it looked very tough and charred (the restaurant is very dark so it was hard to see).  I took a bite and could barely chew it.  Bottomline, it should not have left the kitchen and should have never been served.  I sent it back and they brought another.  It was prepared correctly but lacked flavor.  I don't think it was fresh at all.  For the price of this meal, I should have sent my entire meal back but I didn't because I did not want my husband to have to wait on me.  Kudos to the front of the house host for coming to the table and apologizing and they did end up removing the lobster tail from our bill.  The restaurant did insist that we take a dessert with us (chocolate mousse torte which was delicious) on the house BUT as a result of this experience, we will probably try other steakhouses the next time we visit Vegas.  This was a huge disappointment for us because we always eat here and look forward to it.  This was suppose to be our dinner to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  Our visit this time was memorable for all the wrong reasons.",mX-WiYESoNlsndx9XSNklA,1,0,3,7RjOvHecbSbUIl6DTEiHhQ

I come in with a few friends and even they were pretty impressed. Well, these aren't just any friends. These are dudes who are waaaay too knowledgable about steaks. These are dudes who eat steak like it's Mcdonalds. 

I'm too lazy to go through the whole menu we ordered because all I know is someone got the filet mignon, 2 porterhouses, and a rib-eye. This time I opted for a porterhouse. It was so tender that you can't help but to think, why do cuts of meat even matter! It does! But...here...it didn't even matter. It was well-seasoned and well-done! Lol. Don't bash me for eating a steak well-done! Twas good! I didn't need to see pink in order for a juicy steak. This was juicy.

We then went & ordered our salad & what kind of dressing with it; I chose red wine vinaigrette  it was so delicious & fit right with the salad. The lettuce in the salad was the freshest I've ever ate.

5551334,2016-03-31,2,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"So, my dad wanted to go here for Father's day and what kind of son would I be to tell him that he was picking an obviously inferior Vegas strip steakhouse? I will say that this place is better than I was expecting and while it's still nowhere close from the top strip steakhouses (which is hard to visualize when this is 4 stars and they are 5), there just isn't a lot to knock about this place.

It's certainly of a particular style of steakhouse let's get that straight. It has NOT changed with the times at all. It's decor is atrocious but hey it's part of the theme of the restaurant and it works, old fashioned all the way.  My dad claims we used to go there when I was an infant and so when he says it hasn't changed one bit, from the way it looks I believe him.

Ultimately though the food is pretty good. Nothing will blow your mind and nothing will make you say I wanna come back for that specific thing. The menu is uninspiring and you could probably guess off the top of your head 80% of the menu items because they are classic steakhouse staples and nothing more. All of this sounds fairly negative but really since the entire theme of the restaurant is to take you to a different time for steakhouse dining, surprisingly it works.

-Caesar salad. Run of the mill typical caesar salad which isn't a horrible thing. Won't blow you away but should meet your expectations for what a caesar is.

-Filet and Rib eyes. Honestly both are very good. Dry aged and seasoned well they are good pieces of meat. Again you won't be going nuts over them and there are no absurd toppings to put on them (this is one of the only times when my dad asks for A1 to go along with a 60 dollar steak I haven't cringed), but they are very good.

-Cheesecake. I mean the cheesecake was really good. Tasted great. Again it's no fancy cheesecake. There's no liquid nitrogen frozen mint on it, no fruity reductions. It's a slab of cheesecake. A good slab but a standard one.

I don't know how this place is even still open. It doesn't seem like it's ever busy and since there are now 15 reviews for it on yelp I feel like nobody goes here.  But it's still trucking away and at the end of the day if I happen to be in the Circus Circus (and Idk why I would ever do that to myself) and I'm hungry, there are worse places to stop by for a meal.",TZhIAnp1m3RzWevju1mp1g,4,3,4,x34Xgx6J9MAX4ltSVGHjeA
5568420,2015-07-15,2,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"This place is always very highly rated so we decided to give it a try.  I would say the meal was good but the process to get there was a nightmare.  The restaurant is the only good thing going for Circus Circus. 

First of all, the parking situation was awful.  The place was packed with tons of families and kids.  We were stuck in a very long line for a quite awhile even to get into the parking garage. They had one entrance blocked off for no apparent reason.  Handicap parking and valet were both full.  And we asked one of the attendants were the handicap parking was and he was very rude to us.

So we finally parked and then had to make our way into Circus Circus.  There are kids and parents everywhere.  The ceiling is low, the place smells awful, the gambling sucks.  I definitely never need to go back to Circus Circus ever.

So we finally get into the Steakhouse.  We did get a nice table right by the grill area so we could watch what was going on.  The inside of the place is very traditional steakhouse with wood walls, dark furniture and quiet.  

I had the filet mingon with double asparagus instead of potato.  It was nicely cooked.  Good flavor, tender.  Asparagus was good too when I don't even really like it.  My mom had the lamb chops. It was a huge portion.  She took half of it home.  She liked her baked potato.  They give you lots of toppings for it.  

So I would say this was a good steak place but not great.  I have had much better in Vegas at other restaurants.  And the process to get there sucked.  Never again.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,2,0,3,L05rPIgZFT4Slw_aTnnIoQ
5575706,2008-01-26,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"I heard about this restaurant through a friend, and saw many ads along the Las Vegas I-15 freeway that rated it as one of the top steakhouses for the last 20 years or so. Knowing this, I assumed that this place would be really good. My boyfriend and I love to eat steak, and were excited about going here. 

First of all, it is not a place for couples to go. It had a very ""old"" ambiance to it, red leather booths, dark wood panels, pictures of cows, etc. There were no ""couple"" seatings, but mostly tables and booths made for 4 people. When I glanced at the menu, I was surprised to find out that a side of vegetables, salad, or soup were included with the steak, in addition to rice pilaf, garlic mashed potatoes (that was the best I've tasted in a while), or a baked potato. I ordered the Porterhouse and my boyfriend ordered the Rib-eye. Each steak was priced at about $44-47.

We were first brought a basket of different types of bread that were delicious. After we ate almost all the bread, we were brought our salads. Then the steaks came....I ordered mine Medium rare....but to my surprise, it was almost rare in many parts of the steak...the steaks were practically burnt on the top and bottom....and there was no special taste from the meat in general. The steak tasted like a slab of meat that you can just buy at any store and cooked on a home grill! I was very disappointed. If anything, the best thing I had there to eat was the garlic mashed potatoes. 

Despite the lack of taste of the steaks, the service was superb! I heard that the filet mignon was the best thing on the menu. This is also offered on their Sunday Champagne brunch at 930, 1130, 130 (Reservations recommended). The cost is about $35 for it, and offers many other buffet style entrees. The filet mignon is priced at about $55 or so, so the buffet price doesn't even touch that. Next time, I would probably just go for the buffet.",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,0,0,3,vVs2M3L2gLFP7ck2JqbzWw

The sides and garlic mashed potatoes were excellent and the inside was beautifully appointed in classic dark wood and leather upholstery. The waiter was friendly and very professional. The wine was a nice vintage. But the point of a steakhouse is to know what the hell you are doing with the meat.

The prime rib I ordered was a hot mess. I ordered medium-well and got rare. It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat. I performed major surgery to liberate what turned out to be about 4oz of actual meat from the center of this disgusting hunk of beef fat and cartilage. By the time I'd finished sawing away the lard, I was thoroughly grossed out but the huge pile of fat dominating my plate and could barely eat my potatoes and what little meat I had.

So when the bananas foster came for dessert and it had lumps of un-blended cooking paraffin settled at the bottom like marbles, I was ready to vomit. If you are going to make a thickened caramel sauce and use paraffin, get it to the right temperature to ensure it all blends together. Otherwise customers get a mouthful of what feels like cold grease lumps.

The interior; it is classic Steakhouse and has nothing of the gloriously cheesy circus atmosphere that exists just outside the doors.  I love how it looks-oh, and the cow paintings as you enter the restaurant on either side of the hall are great!!
The service;our waiter was great.  no problems there.
The steak; I shared a porterhouse medium rare and my friend had the strip.  I gotta say, I have been here before and the steaks were good.  Today, it was cooked as i ordered, but was just ok.  I choose the place and was too embarrassed by my steak that I didn't ask my friend how is strip was.

5735508,2013-07-23,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"I was in town this past weekend with my son and four of his groomsman for his bachelor party.  We needed a steak and found this place here on Yelp.  After the mostly very positive reviews, we decided to go.  

Circus Circus.  What can I say.  Wayyyy past its prime.  But nicely hidden, so much so that if you're not really looking you will miss it, is The Steakhouse.  What a nice surprise.  

This is a throwback to the old school style steakhouse which my son and I totally love.  Dark wood, cozy surroundings etc.  I was looking for the Rat Pack. (Frank, Dino, Sammy)  You walk right past the grill area when you are seated and we had a table where we could watch the guys cooking the steaks.  Kind of neat.   Just a great atmosphere for eating a steak dinner with friends.

We were greeted by our waiter, Ray, promptly.  I mentioned the bachelor party thing and he immediately lit up and was engaged in making our time a good one.  He is a veteran of the game and knew just how to take care of us.  Drinks and food were ordered and away we went.

Where they stumbled was with the food.  Drinks were great, salads were very good.  But 3 of us had ordered steak medium rare and received medium well.  Also, I ordered a lobster tail with my ribeye and the tail was raw on the inside.  BUT our man Ray handled the situation professionally which is to say with no comment other than a sincere apology and the offer to redo the meals which we accepted.  Unfortunately, a few minute later, a runner came out with my lobster tail which had clearly been nuked in the microwave.  All shriveled up and steaming.  Ray was nearby and I flagged him down and he was aghast.  The ruined tail was taken away no questions asked.  We a were offered a round of free cocktails while we waited and it was a bachelor party so....Way to go Ray.

Unfortunately our 3 friends were done with their meals when our redone meals arrived.  But they arrived completely fresh and perfectly done.   No recycled veggies etc.  In the end we all had terrific meals and were completely satisfied.

But again, the fantastic Ray then offers unsolicited our choice of free dessert or an after dinner drink of our choice.  Again, being it was a bachelor party....We all had generous shots of a nice high end bourbon for ""dessert.""

So even though there were a few hiccups, the staff handled them very well and we were completely satisfied.  And at a price that was about half of what we would have paid at one of the more notable places like Gordon Ramsey's at the Paris. A great time was had by all.

Thanks Ray.",s6ArzWxkfV7uRURej7AoQA,0,0,4,RV0mZmLV8zJznIJxSdJlNw

5837928,2011-09-09,0,bSY97kgQpJ5BrpgW40V1qg,"After hearing about The Steak House at Circus Circus for more than 20 years, Restaurant Week gave me the excuse I needed to finally visit the place and appraise it. And, after doing so, while I do not consider it to currently be the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, I was impressed. Rather than being the cowboy steak joint I sort of expected, this was a classy dining establishment with serious steaks, professional service, and an upscale enclosed dining room. Not everything was executed perfectly but everything I witnessed was executed well. 

The large dining room that featured fancy multi-hued fabric chairs and comfortable, red leather booths was filled to capacity early on a Thursday night. I was very glad that my party of four had a reservation. The room contained several lit lamps but it was still very dark inside. 

Buttered raisin bread was a tasty start to a fine meal overall. A white crock of French Onion Soup was hot and had nicely melted cheese on top as well as well-caramelized onions inside, but the dark broth was very salty and a bit harsh tasting at first. Yet, as I dug in deeper with my soup spoon, and got near the bottom of the vessel, the broth tasted much sweeter, and I liked it.  While the onions were numerous, I found no melted croutons in the midst of the broth, and missed them. But, now I realize that this was my own fault. For, a photo of my soup reveals that several hard croutons rested right next to my crock. All I had to do was dump them in. Pity that I overlooked that when it mattered! 

The large Steak House Salad consisted of just a few types of mixed greens, plus grape tomatoes, and slices of mushrooms, carrots, and cucumbers. An excellent thick and creamy Blue Cheese Dressing made the taste buds come alive. 

Then came the piece de resistance that I was waiting for the most: a 12-oz. Filet Mignon prepared Oscar style with King Crab, asparagus spears, and a generous amount of Bearnaise Sauce ladled over the top. The steak wasn't the best I ever tasted but it was probably in the top ten.  It was cooked medium rare as ordered; it did melt in the mouth once I reached its middle; and I found it to be well seasoned and tender throughout with no noticeable char. It had been beautifully prepared on the grill above white-hot burning mesquite wood by a chef who clearly knows how to cook premium beef to order, as other steaks at my table were cooked medium and medium well as ordered, with everyone pleased with their entree. The crab and Bearnaise Sauce were also of high quality. Only the spears of asparagus were lacking in appearance and flavor; they were undistinguished thin, green--or in some cases yellow-tinged--reeds. My Baked Potato was good but not soft all the way through on the inside.  It could have benefited from a few more minutes in the oven. 

The large array of included desserts from the Chef's Pastry Cart were first rate. Chocolate Mousse Cake with chocolate shavings was dense and luscious. And a novel Bananas Foster that was self-contained in a martini glass was very fine, replicating all of the elements of the more common flambeed variety. Cut pieces of banana, melting vanilla ice cream, and the requisite liqueur all mixed together very well to create a tasty sauce and a memorable dessert.  The only untoward moment was when my wife, Diane, mistook for a Pirouette Cookie an inedible cinnamon stick that was lodged in the Bananas Foster, and almost broke a tooth! 

The meal as a whole was a solid 4-1/2-star experience. An oasis of fine dining does indeed reside inside Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,1,1,4,ri_hsKHxizIXSZnjdlKbig

Crab legs - according to my companions it was very good.
Shrimp cocktail - Amazing, I believe its tiger shrimp cause those baby's where big.

Ordered the New York Strip and it was cook to perfection. Very tasty and juicy. Complimented with the Mash Potatoes and Asparaguas (winning combination). Everything was prepared excellently.

My husband mentioned that he had heard about this place through friends and coworkers. Surprisingly, it was supposed to be pretty good. So we decided to come here on a weekday after work, hoping it would be less crowded. I was able to call 2 hours ahead of time to get a reservation. I haven't been to this hotel since I was a kid, but man this place is run down. Definitely the hang out spot for high school kids. 

First of all, it is very easy to miss this place. We came early and walked by without even knowing it. They are located across Market Express, between two gift shops (don't remember the names of them). We were lucky enough to get a booth. An hour later, the restaurant was filling up. I heard a couple asking one of the servers if they could sit at a booth, but were told ""no"" because they were ""booked with reservations."" 

Service was pretty good throughout the night. Our servers were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. As for the food, the menu was very simple. I really like how dinner INCLUDED bread, chef's vegetables, soup or salad, and choice of baked potato, garlic mashed potatoes or wild rice. That's right, no extra charges for these sides! I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon. It was good, but unfortunately not the best that I have had. It was cooked well and easy to cut and enjoy. However, it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted it to be. I guess that was the purpose of the Bearnaise Sauce, which was alright. Usually, I don't eat my steaks with sauces. On the other hand, my husband really enjoyed his Porterhouse. We also ordered Fries Our Way, which FYI, is fries cooked in duck fat. It was nice and crunchy on the outside, but tasted like regular fries to me! For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu. Out server said that they had ""the best one in town."" Not so sure about that, LOL, but I thought it was still good and not too sweet.

How's that for the start of a review?  I'm not sure that I've ever had worse food at a restaurant, let alone one with such grand acclaims and high prices.  Some reviewers say the decor is elegant, but it looks like the inside of an Irish bar to me.  I believe that because of its location in Circus Circus there is an illusion of classiness created by juxtaposition.

On the night that a friend and I went almost every item we ordered was awful.  They were out of sauteed mushrooms, so we opted for crab legs and grilled shrimp.  The shrimp were ok, but the crab legs were horrible.  Too briny and salty, we couldn't even finish them, and the friend I was with is a fat bastard.  The waiter ended up not charging us for those because he could tell our meal wasn't starting out well.

Next we got our side salads, which were fine, but they weren't anything special.  Besides, we were there for steak.  My friend got the porterhouse and I got a ribeye.  Mine was edible, whereas I had one bite of my friend's and could not have imagined eating much more than the single bite.

Having learned our lesson, we didn't opt for dessert.  I do recall getting decent service, but it doesn't matter when the meal is utterly unenjoyable.

The bottom line: this is probably a great steakhouse much of the time, but when we were there it sucked ass big-time, and you shouldn't risk that, let alone have to pay for it.",PWohtvH6nTdvGCGeRzoUuQ,1,1,1,ON5zPZpfWB0RLdJqzN80gA

I said, ""really? Ive never seen invisible barnaise!"" Can you please bring some extra? He comes out 15 minutes later with some brown sauce that looked like gravy. I said ""what is this?"" he tells me its barnaise. I said no, barnaise is yellow. He tells me that he is positive its barnaise and then walks away.
