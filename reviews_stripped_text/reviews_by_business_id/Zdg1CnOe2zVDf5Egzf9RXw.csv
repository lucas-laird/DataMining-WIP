Anyhow we unfortunately have to tell you we were quite disappointed today after our visit today at 3397 Las Vegas Boulevard.

We arrived around 9:30 a.m. and where seated quickly. The place was not too crowded at all. Matthew M. ""Matt"" was our service guy of the evening. After we have ordered our first drink and it arrived at our table, Matthew told us he will be right back with ""the rest"". After 5 Mins we started to ask for some straws, as we haven't had any. Furthermore we asked to get some water. Straws were available quite quickly, the water wasn't. Matthew said it was a misunderstanding as he thought we only wanted to have our drink and no further water. This itself would have been ok, anyhow we had to go to the bar by ourself to get some water and bring it to the table later on. Our starter was received without any cutlery. This wasn't handed in before main course (and even there only on request). The food itself was good. We ordered another drink, but had to remind Matthew twice before it arrived. Overall we were not satisfied at all.

It seemed like there were similar situation at the other tables around. 

Furthermore we were quite surprised when the check came -""Matt"" took the right to put a tip of 20%, handwritten by himself, on it. 
When we paid at the front desk we asked Crystal to remove it. She was quite surprised and asked us, if we are sure to not give any tip. We wanted to explain why, anyhow she wasn't interested at all, repeated, that ""you do not want to give any tip"". We asked her if she wasn't interested, what made her repeat a third time we are just non-willing to tip.

As written above, this visit at #dennysdiner was not in line with our expectations at all. Instead of enjoying Las Vegas we are now at the hotel...",ZktMevaOAkjTILhTqVtxsg,0,0,1,uG_C9KIk4QxU-jucfUJq8Q

My party of 3 came in on a Thursday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't very busy and had to wait almost an hour after ordering for our food. People who had been seated after us had already finished eating by the time we were served.

I did not recognize the super bird sandwich I always order when it was served. The sandwich was tiny and hardly warm, the bread barely toasted and soggy with butter. The cheese was unmelted and the sliver of tomato looked like it had been sliced 5 hours ago and sat in the sun. The worst part was the meat, instead of thin deli meat I was given a single thick slab of burnt dry turkey dinner meat and 3 tiny burnt pieces of bacon no longer than my little finger. It looked like they had pieced it together from someone's leftovers.

My husbands spaghetti was served cold with very underdone noodles. The appetizers still had not been served by the time we decided to save ourselves the stomach ache and grab some fast food, because taco hell couldn't be worse than what we were served.

She then asked someone standing nearby and the answer I got was yes.  I specifically said again, you have gluten free pancakes right?  Yes, again was the answer.  

We get there and I'm pouring over the menu looking, but can't find.  They do have Gluten free friendly menu where you have to look for a micro-sized icon to denote the gluten free dish.  The only thing I could find beyond obvious items that don't contain Gluten was English muffins.  

The waitress was appoligetic and said she would mention it to the manager.  I would have liked a visit from the manager to tell me that they would make sure the staff was educated in giving the correct answer next time someone phones ahead, but the visit never came.  If I was a gambler in Vegas, I'd bet she never said a word.  I'm going to call ahead again tomorrow to see what answer I get.

Anyway, besides the gluten, this was the worst Denny's experience my family has ever had.  Denny's is famous for ""Cheap"" food, but I kept wondering how in the world do they slice the bacon so thin that you can barely see it.  They ran out of coffee and so the refill came long after the wife wanted it.  I will say, besides the poor service and overall food quality, the gluten free english muffins were good.

Bottom line is we ussually goto Denny's a few mornings while in vegas because of the prices on the stip being so high.  This was the first and last time I'll ever goto this location.

When I asked why my order didn't look like an omelette, the server told me that I couldn't expect it to look like what I make at home. She didn't even apologize and I quietly ate my food.  When it was time for me to pay, I used a discount I got from completing a survey online. When I asked the cashier to explain my bill, she did so with an ""attitude"" and glared at me. I then politely commented that I just wanted to know where the discount was applied. I know that this is a busy location, but Denny's need to do a better job hiring people that can handle the voume, take the stress while providing excellent customer service. It comes with the turf.

I know, kinda strange being a restaurant, but trust us this is not where you want to be if you are hungry or thirsty. We went on a Thursday night when most of the seats were empty and we're directed to sit down and wait on a bench. After a few minutes of staring at tables with menus and silver ware from afar we became jealous of the other guests. We decided to go to the white castle located at the bottom of the steps because our hunger had progressed by this point. BTW White Castle was amazing! The next morning we decided to get breakfast with the rest of our group and give dennys a second chance. We were split into two tables for one party and the tables were not close enough to consider us together as a group. We waited this time but not as long, we would have preferred to wait at this point as is appropriate for a large party. We noticed the place seemed semi busy for an average Denny's and didn't want to complain and began to wait. After about 10-15 min of waiting for a wait staff, and asking a few of them politely to find our wait staff. 2 of us asked from one table with 2 of the staff  and another of us at the second table with a third staff. (For a waiter to bring us water and silverware) After 20 minutes we all got up and went to McDonald's. We were surprised as first timers to Vegas that the ""busiest dennys in America"" (quote we overheard from the staff) was less full than the one back home in the suburbs of Michigan, yet the over-staffed restaurant in Vegas had now let us down twice in our first two days. Let me repeat that in case you lost me, we went to dennys 2 times in 2 days and were never spoke to a waiter. Spent 30+min of my hard earned vacation on their situation.

I usually do not have much love for Denny's these days, but after a long night of partying, this location on the Las Vegas Strip can be just the right place for the right price. 

Do not go here sober: you will be the only one besides the staff and will not like it. 

Hordes of sweaty tourists and drunken revelers slide through this place 24 hours per day all year long and it shows. It is the dirtiest Denny's you will ever sit in, and that's saying a lot. 

But do not mind those minor details; remember, you are drunk and hungry, and Uncle Denny is here to help with that headache. Inside this diner you will experience the greatest craving for substandard food in your life. In a swirling and spinning haze with sounds that cut in and fade out, you will throw out your sensibilities and last vestiges of decency and want everything on the menu like an uncultured swine. Gazing at the menu with a childlike sense of awe and amazement--somewhere in your brain's basement a little voice will pose this question: does this place employ a hypnotist?--you start to feel that each perfectly posed piece of colorful food on the menu is beckoning you. 

Give into those feelings my hard-partying friend; you've earned the right to sit at the booth of frat kings that has comforted hundreds of thousands of bacchanalian souls coming off 15-hour sprees of drinking, gambling, and dancing with Dionysus just like you. You are now in the sticky, vinyl throne of Vegas. You have arrived. 

(For the best 24-hour eats in Vegas, head to Mr. Lucky's 24/7 in the Hard Rock Hotel; that diner cannot be beat during the in-between times).",-fLbuIVrkAZTo1Tm652YvQ,0,0,3,B1u7SMC9RHAizmyBf81rKg

I ordered tomato with mine, easy sauce, It came without tomato and a lot of spread. I felt like the cooks could care less that it took forever. The waitresses seemed a little more in tune but it seems like everyone was slacking off. I think the manager was there and he too was slacking. There was a lot of bickering going on between the waitresses and the cooks. The total time there exceeded an hour and half... FOR A COUPLE OF SANDWICHES!! By far the worst Denny's Ive been to. So sad because I usually like Denny's. The manager needs to get it together and make sure the staff is running efficiently and smoothly.",zsuWuxJEVArFe58y7Dr66g,1,0,1,dIY3C89pAW33Y90zbGlXIA

I haven't been to a Denny's in years, but it seemed like a far better option than paying the ridiculous prices for food where I was staying (Wynn).  Being used to NYC, most places with high prices don't suprise me,but congrats to the Wynn for doing just that!

Anyway, after having not my best Poker session ever (meaning I lost quite a bit to a table full of grandmas), I needed some comfort food for a price I could afford with my now very small bankroll.  

Denny's seemed perfect for just that.  It was about 3am so it was pretty empty, and the hostess and waiter were both very friendly.  The place was nice and clean inside.  

Opening the menu filled me with joy.  Just seeing all the food I could order made me so happy, but also so confused.  What should i get? pancakes, appetizer sampler? omlette, sundae?  Then I saw it.  Grand Slam Burrito.  I read the description.  Buritto filled with eggs, cheese, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and syrup.  This makes the McGriddle look like babyfood.  I instantly was ecstatic at the thought of this meal.  I would guess it was the single most unhealthy thing I have ever eaten in my life.  Every bite was more perfect than the last one though.  This sandwich was so delicious.  In my opinion, this will be remembered as one of man's greatest creations of the decade.  

I wish I could have been in the brainstorming session that resulted in this idea.  I'd like to buy those folks a drink.  You have to try this burrito.  Just wow!.  Oh, and the hash brown that came with it was good too.

The first time was back when I was little on our way through Denver, and the most recent times have been in Vegas, because between you and me, the hotel restaurants really jack up the price for breakfast.

We first discovered this Denny's the last time we were in Vegas several years ago and staying across from it at Treasure Island. And seven years later, not much has changed, besides the fact that this Denny's has moved to a bigger, roomier upstairs space near Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.

Our first breakfast there was on a Saturday morning and while we did have to wait to be seated, it was maybe 10 minutes tops. Every morning after that was even less of a wait time, with Monday morning have no wait (although it seem to take a long time to get our food that morning).

Denny's menu is much better than I remembered as well with some nice, healthier scrambles and omelets and even a breakfast with banana pecan raisin pancakes that doesn't break the calorie bank. Portions are plentiful, gluten free options are available, and it's still the best bang for your breakfast buck on the strip.

Typically, service is pretty fast and they're turning over tables at a good clip. If you have a smaller party of two, you might even check to see if the counter has a couple of spaces (it's on the right of the restaurant when you walk in)  - those are first come, first serve, I believe.

Overall this place is just the same as any other Denny's, I think, but on the strip - it's a great deal in a world of gluttonous, overpriced buffets and alcoholic slushies.",2mguZPvbCa4lwT_ULfTmHQ,3,3,3,JCmrszlAqf3hRDKPK9zzqw

Don't get me wrong, my mood absolutely does not affect my rating of this place, it was simply that bad.

Our group of five decided that we would grab a small and quick breakfast to hold off the hunger until our 2:30pm appointment with the Wynn buffet that afternoon. We woke up pretty late, and headed across the street to Denny's a little after lunchtime. Boyfriend forgot his phone in the room so we told the others to go ahead. By the time we caught up, the three of them had secured a nice table near the kitchen, it seemed like a pretty good spot. They were nice enough to wait for us to order, hopefully we didn't take too long! 

So here's what happened: we were all starving, and it pretty much took at least a half hour before we were able to order/get our food. First off, we didn't have enough menus. (Didn't even get ONE copy of the cool  $2/4/6 menu that I ended up swiping from a neighboring table) Secondly, nobody brought us any water. Third, every waiter we tried to flag down STRAIGHT UP IGNORED us. Why? Because we weren't in their zone/area or whatever. Turns out we weren't even assigned a waiter, no wonder. So by the time we clear up the situation (they all kept telling us that someone else was coming, clearly  not) we were able to order. I personally have a thing against soggy potatoes so I specifically asked for my hashbrowns to be extra crispy, and they came out pasty white (okay, maybe beige. gross!) The eggs were no better, the whole meal was a huge letdown. Despite taking over 30 minutes to take our order, our check came out at the speed of light.

Left our money at the table, definitely not coming back. I realize that not everyone's experience may be this bad, but if its bad enough to be this inconsistent, it's bad.",u238Qh2YnnfL6qlvrmL7Tg,3,1,1,QCPii85Z1G0KKdPsX-epCQ

I had the alaskan salmon dish for dinner with a side of mac and cheese and side vegetables. The salmon lacked a sauce but was prepared ""au naturel"". I have no problem with that, however. The sides were good. Had the chocolate peanut butter milkshake (New!). It was excellent and the server left a metal milkshake container with a second full refill!

Next morning, we came back for breakfast. Omelette, french toast etc. It was great. Coffee is substandard.

The service for the first meal, dinner, was extremely slow and we waited for over 45 minutes for our meal. However, the kind waitress (who actually cared deeply about customer service) wrote off like half the meal price, so no complaints.

The one subtracted star is for the unseasoned salmon and mediocre coffee. However, here is what at least half the stars are for: good and friendly service and reasonable prices. One might think that a place located on the South Strip of Vegas might try to overcharge and under-serve their customers. Not the case.

I wasted about two hours of my vacation to get the most Terrible breakfast I have ever had. 

The service was poor and the food was cold. 
We had to wait 15 minutes to get our pancakes with the rest of our meal and had to ask several times to get a fork, knife and spoon. 

Do yourself a favor and walk south a block to McDonald's which I did every day after this horrible experience and you will get a nice hot, quick meal at a reasonable cost.",J9pZF_KxW2iKty1t0VM0rg,2,1,1,BzpfRMFmEBkGddIcKn0ekw

Customer service skills by her needed tweaking as she did not have any type of interaction did not say hello did not apologize that I was waiting and basically said ""what can I get you"" when she finally came to the table. 
my drink was refilled only one time and she never came by during the mean to ask how everything was. Brought the bill and just sat it down without saying anything. Needless to say if you get the tall red head that looks pregnant move to a different section.

If you get sick from food poisoning, find a pube in your meal, or your server snorts coke in front of you by rolling up one of your pancakes, then yeah, give it one or two stars.  But you walked into Denny's knowing what it was, right?

The staff was friendly and efficient.  Almost too efficient - a crowd of people were waiting to be seated as a crowd of people were waiting to pay.  The food came out quickly and it was your typical budget diner fare.  No surprises here.  The prices are among the lowest that you'll find for restaurants on the strip and it'll give you the energy to walk around on a hot day.

Also don't understand some of the reviews where people act like coming here late night / early morning after partying is a bad thing.  I think it's a great thing.  Denny's is a good way to recharge after a night out.  There's no shame in that.  Unless you're a girl with four guys, walking around like you're a cowboy.  Then there's a little shame in that.

After 35 minutes we checked back and saw that many five, four and seven seat tables were being seated that came way after us. Since we saw that there were still large parties of nine ahead of us and that we were now past the estimated time. We said we would like to split our table however needed in order for us to get a table as soon as possible. 6 and 3 or five and four were fine.
After another 25 minutes of them ignoring us and not seating us we kept reminding her that it is now an hour and we are waiting. We would like to split our table.

They said a table for nine came available and proceeded to seat us.
There were two six seater tables next to each other and I had assumed that they were going to seat nine of us between the two tables.
Nope, they seated nine of us on a six seater.
.
Besides not being able to sit comfortably while we were all squished in, we were then asked for our drink order 15-20 minutes later. We had no waiter for 15 minutes and when we asked any waiter for help they would rudely reply, you are not my table.

When our waiter finally arrived we placed our order.

We ordered hot chocolates. All of them were watery and needed to be remade. (I know what Denny's hot chocolates normally taste like... this was actually the reason we came in.)

The veggie omelette had bacon in it.

Men's bathroom was really dirty.
Waiters given too many tables.


Terrible.
By putting nine people on a six seater table you are setting them up for a miserable meal. We each bumped elbows a lot... one had to sit forward and one behind so that we all actually fit.

So, you head in, sit down, and in a dizzy drunken frenzy, try to figure out what the hell you want to eat.

Maybe that happened, maybe it didn't. Let's just pretend we're in a world of pure fiction right now. We ended up getting an order of some of the crunchiest most delectable cheese sticks I have ever had. While more than half of my friends were passed out, I enjoyed every single bite of mozzarella goodness.

The great thing about this Denny's was surprisingly the waiter. She could instantly decipher our inebriated state, but didn't give us any attitude or treat us like your typical college students. Instead, she just laughed along with our stupid jokes and was very courteous and timely. This Denny's is perfect if you're hungry in the middle of the night and want to fulfill those munchies that you've been craving for all night.",1yv6GXttiII_-od7HaUcfA,1,1,4,d7QKWKXFjy1KHDfcF3FJag

It seemed like it's beneath for anyone whenever this place get chosen as the dining option. We always takes it for granted because it opened 24 hours and it would always be a fall back plan in case the better restaurant down the Vegas strip was full.

This place is the good ol' reliable. A few times when we need to grab a hearty breakfast before we hit the road home, we always stopped by here instead of launching into a gorge feast at another buffet.

Goodness gracious, haven't we ate enough?

I just love the folksy charm of the place with friendly smile and the ever refillable hot coffee that is ready for you. I still can't get over the jam on the butter white toast and the hot scrambled egg with sausage. The only thing I would skip was the rubber pancakes, but people still love'em.

This place never gets the appreciation from many diners until you need them, but I just can't get over the fact we'll get the young couples who just got hitch getting the congrats from a trucker who is about to hit the long road to Utah. Or the fact that a high roller would be spending here instead of guzzing it up in his hotel room for dining in room service.

Nothing beats Denny for a hearty meal on the Vegas strip. Just make sure you come early enough because everyone in town will have the same thing in their mind.

Went with five girls for a economical brunch before hitting the pool/slots. Everything was terrible about this place- so bad that I  made a severe mental note to warn THE OTHERS on Yelp before they made this tragic mistake.

We ordered our meals and a few of us ordered coffees. The waitress came on the other side of the table and told my cousins to ""slide those coffees over there will ya"" to me and my sister. Totally rude. Then, she said ""the bread is getting toasted it's coming"" after we asked where the bread was. Ten minutes later she comes out and says ""oh there actually was no bread but here! take this garlic bread instead"". 

The garlic bread was literally seeped in a garlic broth and microwaved, so my sister was the only one with balls to ask for just bread and butter instead. When the waitress came back, chunks of butter were thrown onto untoasted white bread. Ridic.

I'm not one to complain, but I usually LOVE Denny's and have never had an issue with it back home. The meals we got were literally slapped onto the plate, half-assed, and small. This Denny's made my heart die a little inside.

Waitresses never refilled our coffee, disappeared, and we had to go to the kitchen to find someone to pay our bill.

I'm sure if you've been to any Denny's you know what to expect for the food. In this popular Strip area, there aren't a lot of breakfast options, and this has more well rounded options than going to McDonald's or Starbucks or some more expensive restaurant. 

I came here 3 times for breakfast during my trip, and there was always a wait and not a big wait area. The service was a little unreliable, but it was packed, so of course that's going to be expected. I never had a problem getting a coffee refill as it seemed one person walked around to all the tables to refill those.

It's not a quiet, relaxing atmosphere, but you can get some low calorie breakfast options. I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a party of 2, but if you have a large party, I'm sure it'll be a lot longer. They also serve alcohol.

Denny's falls on the lower end of that price spectrum. the $2-4-6-8 Menu is a blessing handed down from God/Allah/Yahweh/Odin/Zeus/Joe Pesci.

for $6 I got the southern omelet: 3 eggs, cheese, crumbled biscuit, sausage, gravy, cheese, hash browns and toast. also got some coffee and orange juice. total was around $10. the sausage was kind of bland, but the rest of the flavors acted in deliciously unhealthy unison. what obesity epidemic?

service? could have been better. but the place was packed, and yet our group of 6 was seated in 10 minutes, so I give them props for that.

The server never brought them so we used our fingers. When our food came one of the dishes did not come out with the rest. When it came the server tried to argue that the eggs weren't cooked right. And that she tried to tell the cook that. The eggs were cooked perfectly, so not sure what that was all about. My friends avocado Caesar salad had very little avocado on it. And when she asked for more she was told no. Then a fly lands on my other friends pancakes and gets stuck. So we call a server over and they take it away. But now we have all lost our appetites. Our server comes over to ask what happened and we tell her and she claims there was no fly. The manager comes and we tell him what happened and he says he will take the pancakes and the salad that was not like the description off. We wait for our new bill but no one comes. So we go to the front and tell them we were waiting for our bill but none of them know where it is. Then the manager hands the bill to the cashier but he took the wrong items off. Another steps in a comps our whole bill. Of the five people we dealt with only one knew what Customer Service is. We will not be back.

We were not expecting a 5 star meal, yet we did expect at the very least a decent breakfast meal. Unfortunately, we got quite possibly the worst breakfast we've ever had. Our toast was burnt, and not just a little bit on the crust, but charcoal-burnt throughout to the point where we wouldn't quite tell what bread was white and which one was wheat. Our hashbrowns were also done horrible; the exterior was burnt, yet the middle portions were cold. My husband's scrambled eggs were decent, but my over-easy eggs has weird spots in them that made me pass on eating them in fear of becoming ill.

My friend was missing half her food, what food was there was cold, her sausage was undercooked (still pink in the middle) never once received refills on our water and when we finally tracked down another waiter to get our check so we could finally leave after being there for almost 2 hours and they gave us the wrong table check. Our original waitress finally showed up and sat down next to me in my booth and proceeded to tell me about how hard her night is and how she's so sorry and she's was having an off night and just wanted to go home and sleep. I would have felt bad but I just wanted to leave and enjoy what was left of my night. I waited almost 20 more minutes to speak to the manager. Never in my life have a wanted to leave before paying, they would have deserved it. Finally spoke to the manager and explained everything. He apologized and said hopefully we'll have a better experience next time (sorry to burst your bubble but I won't ever be back) I was nice at first but that kind of response from a manager is ridiculous. I told him I wanted compensation for my time and money wasted. He said he'd offer me my food half price. He charged me both meals at a 50% employee discount (according to my receipt) and walked off.

Complaints:
The hostess with black shoulder length hair, treated us like we were invisible. There was no hello, no welcoming gesture, no eye contact.

The hostess was going to give us a dirty booth table. 

The server Kathryn got our orders right. However, she had no time to check up on us after food arrived after 30 minutes. 
Our table had no utensils.
My steak was over cooked. My steak knife arrived when all my other guests had finished eating their food.
I asked for A1 sauce, and another guy server handed me a bottle with 4 drops left. 
We basically had to wave our hands for about 10 minutes until someone can notice that you need anything. 

Lastly, we were charged my complimentary birthday meal, after Kathryn had repeatedly confirmed that it is complimentary.

We complained to the manager. He listened and apologized. However, it was not handled properly. He asked us if it's ok for him to refund us the amount charged for the complimentary meal. That was already given, that it should be refunded.

I came here on Wednesday night (12/30/15) around 7 PM. Surprisingly, there was actually a wait list! We waited about 25 minutes before we were seated. 

We ordered:
-1 Ultimate Omelette // This was actually one of the dishes that was piping hot! Good size, decent quality. Something that I can definitely make on my own. 

-1 (senior) tilapia // ERRR....very small portion. Comes with two sides that you can choose from! But decent, if you want to get something ""healthy"". But of course, you will have to be 52 years old (and above) first....

-1 BYO Half Sampler // We chose mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders. I actually liked these! Reminds me of the frozen ones I could bake from Costco.

-1 Bourbon Bacon Burger // HUGE! Awesome portion. The fries on the side were churro looking fries, and they were stale cold but still yummy. 

-1 Bourbon chicken skillet // Coldcoldcold. I don't even know what to say...such a disappointment even though the picture (first time I have to judge you, photo!) looked a lot better. It felt like two pieces of grainy chicken with some sloppy sauce poured over it. Skillet wasn't even sizzling! 

-1 slow cook pot roast // One of the dishes our server recommended us. It's tasty! But expensive for the quantity (surprisingly) and not hot either. 

-1 (senior) grilled chicken // ERRRRR. Sure. Just a note, it's on the senior menu. You can choose two other sides with this. 

Pros:
-Nice service. They try, they really do. But it's kind of difficult to eat when your server spills hot water all over the table....
-Great view? I don't know if it was intentional, but they are facing right across from Mirage. Volcano shows at 7 PM, 8 PM and 9 PM! 

Cons:
-Everything was cold. My skillet? Didn't even hear a sizzle. 
-Just really, really mediocre/below average food. I bet my brother could have done better!
-Things add up. AKA it's pricey for the quality of the food! 

Tips/Observations:
-If we didn't get a discount, I would not consider this as even a last resort...

Heading up the escalators we realized that a lot of people had the same idea as us and we put our name on the list for a 25 minute wait.  As we were sitting in the area outside the restaurant waiting a lady had come out and passed us some 20% off coupons they received from the manager since they were leaving that day and wouldn't be able to use them.  I appreciated it but, at the same time this should have been the biggest red flag but, we were hungry and had already been waiting for 15 minutes.

We got a booth and our server finally came over to get our drink order after about 5 minutes.

When the server did come back I explained that she forgot the side of dressing and they were now cold so we wanted to get another order.  In her defense she did remove them from the bill and give us the second order for free and she did seem to be working on half the restaurant by herself.

The only thing that was done quickly was the filling of our empty coffee cups and we did have to get up and go into the server station to get more creamers.  The breakfast was fine but, the whole thing took about an hour and fifteen minutes and people come here to get in and out quickly which sort of defeats the purpose of coming here.

After chatting it up with 2 guys that we had met in the club, it was decided that we needed food.  Destination?  Denny's.  I could not believe I was doing this.  I was now guilty of the late night/early morning Denny's visit.

One of my friends ordered 2 moons over my hammie, and I'm pretty sure one of the reasons she ordered that dish was simply to say it.

Management seems to hate what they do and your processes leave a lot to be desired. JUST CLOSE THEM ALL and give them to a fast food joint. Denny's in Vegas has IMPLODED!!! in the last 5 years. 15 years ago it was bad, 10 years ago it improved quite a lot. NOW your just a joke on the strip. I met people who said in 2009 it was great, 2011 it was great but since 2014 it has been a disaster Do us a favo and sell them or close them all down so we can get food at a decent price but served by people who care, DENNYS IS A DISASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",TIAiAEVM2TyoAjJ5Xbt3xw,0,0,1,hCGFLsHA-aAkIci37dW3_w

However, every single times the staff has been lazy in service and the running of their business is chatioc. This trip I waited 10mins before getting a manager just to be sat at a table, then I waited 5mins for a busser to offer a drink. Followed by a 10 wait for server to order food. I will give my server Ashley credit for picking my table up. I am out of her section and she had noticed how long I was waiting and decided to take me ontop of the 2 large parties she has in her section.",9-VKxMgnIBiSoDr3fAOZ9A,0,0,1,Q-AJNz7pXivCUPxGaEpWcA

The service was horrible. You can wait twenty minutes after being seated before anyone even comes to ask if you need anything. Better order food at the same time or it could be another long wait. 

After we ordered we never saw our waitress again, the manager brought out or food that had been sitting under the heat lamp for some time. I never did get my complete order and am still waiting in that second iced tea. 

This is the first time we refused to tip anyone. Won't be going back any time soon.",umKimYxweE6YBcBKHX3dFg,0,1,1,81JgJb1r1BA-atSU_j6guA

Our food and drink orders were brought incorrectly and incompletely. We spoke to the manager several times, and it took three complaints for him to come to our table. The entrance to the bathroom was greasy and one of our party members had to catch herself falling twice. Let me point out that this is a Wednesday morning, and the waiter to customer ratio is no excuse to our crap service.

This was my first experience at Denny's. The view from the ready Durant was amazing as I overlooked the Strip and the Mirage hotel. The restaurant was nice and cool which was great because outside was 108 degrees. 
The restaurant was very busy and it took a while for us to get served once we were seated. When the waitress finally came she was very nice. I ordered two eggs, turkey bacon and pancakes dressed with chocolate and icing. It was good I enjoyed it!! I love to eat so it was a great portion size. I couldn't even finish the pancakes and that's rare for me . I would definitely go to Denny's again.",Bg4B4x0H8n52eBryhzN-BA,0,0,4,_x_Z2LVACcq204vO9rWRMw

There had to have been some fine print I missed that said the quesadillas were light cheese quesadillas and the chicken tenders must've been a typo and were really supposed to state chicken nuggets... extra dry.. like Vegas heat dry... the mozzarella sticks were cooked ok.. but the rest was awful.

They do have the 2-4-6-8 menu, but they hide it, just like the Denny's near the MGM on the strip. This option is much better than the other Denny's that are on the strip IMO. This is on the second story and has a beautiful view of the strip if you can get a seat in that area. One of the times I came I got a great view of the Treasure Island (I think) water & fire show across the street.

Sometimes they are kinda busy, and one time our server seemed very new, and the cook forgot a few things, but nobody has ever been rude. If you are on a budget but still want to have a meal on the strip (like me), this is the perfect place!",NRB8xfZFzc5KFlKUEzIzWA,1,1,5,_58d7P38EVRDG7Nv15auDQ
