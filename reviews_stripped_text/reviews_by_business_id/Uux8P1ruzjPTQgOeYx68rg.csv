Since it looked like your typical cafe off of a mall food court, I was a little hesitant at first. I ordered Rise and Shine crepes ( Ham, eggs & cheese) with a large iced cold brewed coffee. My crepes was surprisingly good and filling, I thought my coffee turned out perfect too! Usually when I ordered iced coffee with creamer and sweetener, it's either overwhelmingly sweet or drowned with so much creamer, it looked like I'm drinking milk instead. 

My coffee was a little over $7, I think it was more than my food lol It is a little pricey BUT it's Vegas!",QNgGR-CQzYkwZDCBURcWvQ,2,1,4,RfL2wt5wavHSOlveWvb8zw

THE Nook Cafe not to be confused with the Nook Express was amazing from their quick and easy menus to their made fresh ingredients . For lunch I had the BLTA on a Multigrain bread it was perfect the bacon was on point as well as the avocado . For breakfast I had a quick 2 eggs over easy breakfast served with bacon and two DELICIOUS HASH BROWN TRIANGLES MMMMM MMMM these by far are the best hash browns I've had in my entire life . My boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich for lunch and mentioned it was delicious similar to portos  if you've had them you know how delicious they are for breakfast he had the chorizo burrito served on a red tortilla. I stole a bite of his breakfast and I'll add it tasted like a genuine burrito . I would definitely  recommend this little cafe and my visits to the linq will definitely have a Nook detour,Azrg_kbvHdloTyf7pRdU2g,0,0,5,tCyaiz4klvOC5fQ9rv4-Yg

The eggs looked good, but upon sinking my fork into the eggs, I quickly found that they were undercooked, and well, pretty much raw. The bacon was great and the only positive thing about the meal.

It looked clean, bright and inviting, and I filed it away in my mind as a possibility for dinner. When we came back through that night, we popped in. 

The employees were consistently friendly, welcoming and helpful. They have a build-your-own salad option with loads of fresh toppings to choose from, and they cheerfully indulged my five year old son as he concocted his lettuce, raisin and crunchy noodle feast. My wife and I each got a Chinese Chicken Salad -- hold the chicken -- and it was tasty and filling. We all shared a slice of cheese pizza, and the huge slice was definitely shareable when paired with a salad. The pizza had good sauce in just the right amount, a nice crust that wasn't too doughy, and it was fresh from the oven. 

They have those cool soda fountains where you can add one of several flavored syrups to your drink (vanilla, cherry, etc.). Too bad they had Pepsi instead of Coke products!

At the end of our meal, a kind person working there discreetly asked if my son had been a good boy today and if I thought he deserved a free cookie. His eyes widened with surprise when I handed him his peanut butter cookie, which he loved!

Prices were rather high, but on par for anything on The Strip. 

This low-key, well-run eatery, with quick service and healthy options, was a winner for my family among the indulgent and heavy foods in the casinos. I'll definitely be back on any future Vegas trip that brings me to the Linq!",VEC8i6r9D0Dsi_CsnTjxbQ,0,0,5,YnMQodQpKT9PZSJBoSPFPQ

I was waiting for our number to be called at Hash House a Go Go when I decided to pick up a cookie. 

The line moved quick and I quickly chose the peanut butter cookie but once I saw that it was two cookies for $4, I thought, ""another cookie can't hurt nobody"" so I chose the chocolate chip cookie as well. 

I should have waited until after breakfast....but we're in Vegas...who pays attention to proper eating habits?! So I ate the peanut butter cookie and OMG. This is the cookie that I've been wanting to bake at home but can't find that perfect recipe. It has a rich peanut butter taste without the flavor of butter or vanilla behind it. The outer edge was perfectly crunchy and the center was dead on moist....almost raw. It was perfect!! I wanted to hoard the entire cookie but played nice and shared it. I couldn't stop there. If the peanut butter cookie was that good...I couldn't imagine what the chocolate chip was going to be like. One bite into that cookie, I quickly realized that it was amazing. There were chocolate chips in every bite and just perfectly moist and soft in the center with a great crunch on the outer edge. Milk would have been the perfect friend with those cookies!!

I stopped here after having a quick meeting at 3535 Bar and I just needed a little nosh before I hit the road. The selection is decent for such a small location, with multiple sandwich options of both the breakfast and lunch variety; including a few salad options as well. 

I opted for the chicken chimichurri and bacon sandwich with pickled coleslaw. They heated up my sandwich and then put it in a to-go container, which steamed up the bread and made for a messy meal. This was a tad disappointing; I mean who likes to eat a soggy sandwich with a fork. 

The bread fell apart, the chicken was flavorful, and the bacon was crispy and plentiful, but that wasn't enough to save this meal. Nook Cafe offers a lot of other food options and I hope they execute them better than mine.

I was visiting my buddies at the hotel while they were in town and I passed this place while walking to their room. After I left I thought about all the delicious looking pastries I once passed hours ago. The thought lingering in my head made me stop there on my way out.

My partner and I grabbed some coffee and pastries. I had the blueberry scone and the bear claw. Both equally delicious. Both going very well with coffee. This place has a variety of coffee teas pastries salads and sandwiches. The seating area isn't too big but there are like 6 tables across from it so it's a nice place to sit and eat.

The price is a tad bit high, but totally worth it. Definitely recommend anyone to come try this cafe.
I'd also like to mention their salads, which I'm not a huge fan of; their chicken salad was DELICIOUS. The chicken was almost as juicy as my a*s ;)

I stopped by Nook instead of walking to the other side of the hotel for Starbucks, thinking I was saving myself a walk and scoring a specialty coffee shop experience. That wasn't necessarily the case. Let me just preface this by saying all of the workers are sweet as can be, the customer service is definitely top notch! Alas, it's pretty much all downhill from there. 

On my first stop at Nook, I got my usual, a large cold brew with almond milk. I'm a total cold brew snob, so I should've expected subpar coffee. The cold brew was watery and didn't have much flavor to it at all, and the almond milk wasn't very creamy. I drank the whole cup, but that was due to my desperate need for caffeine rather than my enjoyment for the drink!

On my second stop, I decided on an iced vanilla soy latte. Hard to mess up, right? Well, they did it. The coffee flavor didn't come through whatsoever, and once again, my drink was super watery. The worst part was the overwhelming syrup flavor. Nook needs to get their ratios revised, because there was wayyyyy too much syrup. It was pretty much undrinkable. 

The worst part about nook is the prices. You're paying for the convenience, because it's right next to the hotel elevators, but that's no excuse to hike up the prices as much as they do. I spent around $50 on a couple morning coffees and juices. Crazy, right?! If I were to ever stay at the Linq again, I would definitely take the extended walk of shame to get to Starbucks.

Clean, friendly staff and a wonderful
Variety of sorts. 
My friend and myself received a warm welcome from the lovely female staff member and she explained the variety of the baked goods in detail.  
That's why each of us left with a decent size box of goodies;)
Fresh ingredients and extremely tasty items for my sweet tooth.   One of these was a strawberry lemon meringue and OH MY!  
Which is why I returned a week later and purchased some of Turkey day.
That's right, I took the easy way out- no cleaning. 
Everything is presented nicely in the cases, all aesthetically easy on the eyes and tastes GREAT!",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,1,0,4,mQL_Vbnu5lrFVXqsG1-HIw

Staff was very helpful, asked if I wanted to warm up my bread and let me swap out my fruit which didn't look as fresh as I want it to be. The prices are a little high but its obviously because of the extreme convenience.",sdvblZYxQ9fqBXio4dIyIQ,2,1,5,q7xvIwXUDRxAbUX63a_mPQ

I stayed at the Linq and this was right by the elevators to my rooms so I stopped in here twice for coffee and food during my stay. Nook isn't fancy and its definitely a cheaper, ""express"" cafe experience- which isn't bad! 

The coffee is decent and they can hooke you up with non-dairy options for your choice of milk (almond for me). I ordered their Spinach omelette breakfast with 2 hashbrowns and two strips of bacon on my first visit- very plain and not amazing and was super disappointed with my choice. The second time I came in I ordered the Beef/Lamb Gyros and it was much better and pretty flavourful considering all things, it was a little on the dry side.

Staff are friendly and the premises are super clean. Definitely a good stop for basic, on the go snacks and drinks. I would definitely come back, mainly for the coffee though. 
PS. They do deliver to the rooms at the Linq, so keep that in mind!",r0PIAIRRsaxpF7z9SRCT1g,3,3,3,aIqxs6EqJOcVKH7Sc7DqMg

5406622,2015-06-26,0,Uux8P1ruzjPTQgOeYx68rg,"I'm surprising myself giving Nook Cafe a 4. It only offers basic things like salads, sandwiches and pizza as well as coffee, but it works for something quick to eat. The food is expensive given it's just a cafe, around $10 for a salad and $6 for a slice of pizza, but that's more or less what you'd find elsewhere along the Strip. The staff here are super friendly and cheery!

I got a slice of margherita pizza for $6, which they heated up for me in their wood-fire oven. The slice was actually pretty big and reasonable for the price and surprisingly good. The crust was thick so the slice held itself up pretty well despite being rather large. I usually prefer super thin crust pizzas, but their thick crust was soft and chewy. I'd definitely recommend eating the pizza while it's still warm and the cheese is still melted! I took mine to-go and only had a few bites of warm gooeyness before the cheese started to harden :(",ofZzcj1oiHS64f7jbGCXxQ,2,1,4,8ijxfwOLS7x92CJ5smZabw

On the morning of December 23, 2016, my wife and I decided to have a quick breakfast at the Nook Café (not to be confused with Nook Express) before checking out and heading home.

The café is located just a few steps from the elevator banks making it very convenient for us to grab something to eat. Nook serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is very small but has plenty of seating inside and outside of the café.

For breakfast, we had:

Two Eggs Breakfast with Turkey Bacon, $7.75.
2 Croissant Sandwich (Egg, Ham, and Cheese), $14.00, each $7.00.
BYO (Brew Your Own) Oatmeal, $5.25
2 Coffee 20oz., $8.00, each $4.00.

The food was very good and tasty, we both enjoyed it. However we did not like their coffee as it was very bitter. Adding extra creamer and sugar did not improve the taste.

Customer service was very friendly and helpful. Our food came out fast.

The Nook Café is a great place for food to grab-and-go. A good alternative place for breakfast.",GQY1kqVezoOY95nofsNb0Q,0,0,4,H1TNgn-lPpnr8hhCjt9Whg
5525904,2015-07-06,0,Uux8P1ruzjPTQgOeYx68rg,"Found this place when we stayed at the Linq hotel over July 4th weekend. It's actually open 24/7 so it's a good idea for late night meals or lighter snacks. They have a pretty wide range of selection from breakfast items to pizza and gyros. My boyfriend and I decided to order the whole pie for 22$. Which wasn't a bad price it was tasty. 
I really recommend getting the tricolera (or something along those lines) it's a creamy white pizza with spinach, roasted tomato and bell pepper with ricotta cheese. Ah to die for. The staff here are really nice too and recognized us by face which is sweet cause they go through so many people at a time. Olivia is super nice and helpful at the cash wrap. Definitely worth checking it out",l8qVKPPcUMQvfy1jgsKQlw,1,2,4,a7Fxr4PyM5RCPPNaeeVePQ

That was pretty much the quality of the slice of pizza I regrettably got from here. At $6 it seems like an okay deal for a huge slice, but I think it was only that expensive so it can match the rest of the menu ($12 for a turkey sandwich), as it was about $1.50 in terms of quality. I feel bad leaving one star because that was the only thing I tried, but why serve something if it isn't up to par?",xfL0XlJxFaAXKhJX5jXN3g,0,0,1,LqIMwq7eSAT4YCaHlJOteQ

A quick stop in the Nook Cafe' or Grab & Run, there's not much here to help one resist temptation.  

Convention attendees were ordering Breakfast sandwiches, while the rest of us were succumbing to such treats as pastries, scones, ice cream . . .

They have two locations the first location you'll pass is a café. If you continue to walk past the elevators past Club Tattoo you will find the restaurant. I've had pizza there, southwest salad, and my friend had a turkey BLT.. I almost forgot I had a Gyro on two occasions. All the food tasted fresh and delicious. The staff was extremely polite and very accommodating. They have more than enough options. You can also build your own salad if you wish.
