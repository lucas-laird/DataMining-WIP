They were very accommodating about dietary restrictions and answered questions. Also, they had no problem with my ordering just side dishes.

Husband loved the mushroom and cheddar omelette, and the eggs over easy with truffle oil and spinach and leeks were fantastic. 
Nice strong hot coffee or green tea were served with a variety of milks (but I like mine black).

Service was excellent. Water glasses were never empty. Coffee was topped off regularly, and after we'd finished our meal, waiter offered to put more coffee in a to-go cup if we wanted.",yK4DXCY_bcdkDOH4uJyamg,0,1,3,Ibe6p7N3g1S_YuPJRiMwmw

Why eat at a spa when you can eat at all the finest restaurants?  Well that's just the reason.  After days of indulgence, my body was saying ""No more"" so I thought I would sidle up to the smoothie bar here and see what else they might have for a hungry girl tired of all the pomp and circumstance that Vegas restaurants deliver on.

Hmmm . . . .I thought as I pondered the menu.  Gluten free black bean chili with pico de gallo?  Sounds perfect.  And at only 155 calories it was the perfect detox lunch.  Pair it with one of their smoothies and it's a great meal.

On another day I had their burger, sans the bun, with extra tomatoes that they gladly supplied.  A perfect lunch.  

The other good thing is if you like the food- most of the recipes can be found on their website so that you can replicate them at home.

1903049,2018-04-15,0,xiAiahsdBfTxYCFfvZmMfQ,"The Canyon Ranch Cafe is across from the Canyon Ranch Spa in the Venetian complex. That's the easiest way to locate it b/c unless you are staying in the Venetian, it's up an elevator which is off a nearly hidden alcove - check the maps carefully.  It is a very small location. 

Bottom Line Up Front - If you want a healthy, fruit and yogurt-based breakfast, try the Berry Parfait. Be sure to check out the rest of their menu as the salmon dish is pretty darn good too.  I just found the parfait a lighter fare for that early in the morning.  For people looking for a simple, wholesome, not fried eggs, bacon and toast breakfast option, this is the best I've found to date.  

During my last Vegas visit, I hopped up very early every morning and walked from Bellagio all the way to the Venetian just to eat when they opened. BTW, that is about a 20 minute brisk walk that time of day when the rest of Vegas is in sleep recovery!  :) I ate breakfast at the CRC at least 3 mornings during my last visit and at least 3 or more times on my earlier trips (which I did not yelp-up).  

CRC has a wide range of dishes from shakes to more traditional breakfast items - check the menus others have posted. My favorite is the Berry Parfait followed closely by the Anjou Pear.  I supplement the Parfait with 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs on the side.  However, if you order those eggs, which are not on the menu, be prepared to wait about 15 mins while they are cooked.  I tipped extra for the eggs and I also had their ""cold brew"" coffee which was a nice alternative.  

During my last visit, a large table of about 20 people showed up all at once and I think one of the regular staff may have been out sick. I thought oh no, this is not going to go well.  In fact, a guy sitting at the table nearby left b/c the single person working the entire dining room just could not handle all the tables.  The staff was apologizing and juggling as best they could - much to their credit. To help out, I'm pretty sure the on-duty manager from the Canyon River Spa, which is right across the hall, joined in to help out the CRC team until another server arrived. Yeah things were a bit slower that day but it was nice to see the teamwork and a manager not afraid to tow the rope too.  Things were back to normal the next morning, so hats off! 

Overall, service has been very good during my visits and this is my healthy breakfast ""goto"" in Vegas.  Both my water and cold brew glasses never ran dry and it was great!   BTW, I asked at the Bellagio about something similar and was surprised the Bellagio did not have anything remotely similar to the CRC.

Most visits to Vegas requires me to have a massage. Since its either a function or conference, sitting in chairs does something to your back. It cant be standing at the craps table or slouching at the machines which cause the  pain =)

The cafe offers the breakfast and light snacks. I liken it to a small cafe for healthy food. Emphasis is on quality for the price vs quantity. After a nice massage, to just sit and relax with a light meal helps to continue the relax feeling.

The food here is very good, though one of the reviewers complained that the food is bland.  'Tis true, but I'm sensitive to over salting, so I didn't mind.

We came in around 11ish, which is the hazy window between bfast and lunch. . .and me loving breakfast and my friend loving burgers, it was perfect timing.  I ordered the three egg white omelette with spinach, chicken sausage, organic cheese and tomatoes while my boyfriend got the burger with artichoke fries.  Since we stayed at the Palazzo, we had a coupon for free drinks and appetizers, so we ordered the ceviche and crab cakes as appetizers.

Crab Cakes:  Baked instead of fried.  Barely any batter, all crab but not very crispy.  It was still very good though.

Ceviche: Ceviche tastes like sashimi fish squeezed over with lemon in salsa.  It was good though. . .very fresh and tart.

Burger:  Tasty but it was just a bit bigger than Terrace Pointe's kobe beef slider (aka it was smaller than a MCD's Happy Meal hamburger).  The asparagus fries weren't fried at all, and since the oil is needed to make the batter stick to the vegetable, a lot of the batter (which looked like sand colored dust) fell onto the plate.  It was interesting, but I wasn't a fan of it.

Omelette:  Yum, nothing's better than an egg white omelette.  It was very tasty, juicy, had lots of flavor, and the cheese gave it a depth of creaminess to it. But the potatoes that came with the meal were not pan fried. . .I don't even know what they did to it.  The texture and taste of it was off.  The fruit was very sour but I still ate it all.

Overall, not bad.  I think I'd come here again, especially since they give you (for most of the items on the menu) Calorie, fat, and fiber content.  Guilt free eating?  I'm all up for it!",XhnK8ABBHQNZGaoZueJccw,0,0,4,BtmzF5BKV62gbI_iNAKj-w

So, my sister and I decided that at least we could be good during breakfast.  We wandered around the Venetian in the AM looking for something healthy yet satisfying.  Breakfast pastries, danishes and croissants oh my!  Not even an apple could be found.  What is a girl to do?

Canyon Ranch Cafe to the rescue!  We were so lucky to find this gem.  The first morning I ordered a fruit salad and wheat toast with fresh squeezed apple juice.  So good!  The second morning (because once was not enough) I ordered the Thai Style French Toast with tangerine ginger syrup.  Excellent!

This place is located on the fourth flour by the spa. You have to walk down a long hallway to get to the cafe (at the entrance of the spa).

The cafe is medium-sized and very casual and has various options, all super clean and healthy! Menu items include egg dishes, sandwiches, grain bowls, smoothies and more. We both ordered the protein bowl which consists of two organic scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and roasted veggies (mostly eggplant and tomatoes) with a side of salsa. Very clean tasting and delicious and not salty at all. Also had a green smoothie (spinach, kale, lemon, apple, almond milk, wheat germ and a few other ingredients...) which was so fresh and just what my body was craving. You can also create your own smoothie. Service was very sweet and attentive.

The space is odd, even for Vegas, and I don't mean in a typically odd Vegas way either. It feels like a hospital cafe, or an airport cafe, or a junior college cafe, or anywhere that isn't known for food that happens to have a cafe. A very odd, sterile atmosphere indeed.  Didn't care for it one bit.

Our server was very luke warm, much like the coffee. He did bring me new coffee after I said something, but it was obvious we were irritating him by being there. I guess the feeling was mutual. I had the turkey hash which had zero flavor or texture, save for the fact that the potato chunks were totally undercooked and very 'al dente'. I wasn't a fan. I doused the whole thing with tobasco to make it edible. My other half had the blueberry pancakes and liked them, although they were so tiny you had to rub your eyes and look again to make sure they were still there on the plate. Come on guys, this is the '00's! Healthy doesn't have to mean tiny or flavorless. 

Honestly though, who goes to Vegas to eat healthy?? We should have known better (actually we had a coupon). This place is better left to the health nuts and anorexics.",ac1e5-W6eBmTrY4B4ITZng,1,1,2,aBLE9fTy5pobbNmXSfFfqA
4484324,2010-05-16,2,xiAiahsdBfTxYCFfvZmMfQ,"A few weeks ago my mom and I spent the night at the Palazzo, attached to which is the mega-spa Canyon Ranch. Since I'd had a leftover gift certificate from the spa with $30 remaining on it, I decided to go downstairs and have a healthy breakfast at their cafe, while she enjoyed the toasted bagel and cream cheese ($4) she sent me down to a hotel coffee shop to get for her as she got ready. I sat at the counter reading the Vogue magazine I tried to conceal as I waited for the mushroom frittata ($14) I ordered. When it arrived, I was in love with the presentation. I have a weakness for dishes/kitchenware/anything that is manufactured in miniature proportions, so the little cast iron ramekin filled with puffed golden brown eggs that were studded with mushrooms immediately pleased my eyes. Then I took a bite. Not only were the eggs as hard as rocks but they were completely devoid of flavor and the accompanying potatoes were terribly undercooked. Being the high maintenance woman I am (when it comes to food), I sent it back and tried my Vegas luck with the breakfast relleno ($13). This was a poblano pepper stuffed with organic eggs and chorizo topped with low-fat cheese over polenta. This was much better, however, no matter how hard I tried to like it (and I really did try), after a few initial piping hot bites the flavor started to take a turn for the worse and I was reminded of its uber-heathiness. I enjoy healthy food, in fact I love it, but I don't believe in eating something healthy if you don't think it tastes great, or if it is over-priced. So, I consumed my two small cups of decent fresh fruit dressed in lemon juice, asked for the check, and headed back to the room to share my mom's more satisfying bagel.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,2,2,2,DZT4R8_kNYvIRJsSRq_isg

My personal favorite is the Thai-Style French Toast with tangerine ginger syrup and a cup (ten cups?) of black decaf coffee. Only 305 calories, folks! Oh, how I wish there was a Canyon Ranch Cafe back here in LA.  The fresh fruit bowl was a bit pricey for fruit ($7), but hey, it's Vegas.  At least they chopped everything up into neat little cubes (like, really little) in case the customers are too hungover to properly chew their food. I  did try a couple of other dishes, and everything had plenty of flavor without killing my tastebuds like most restaurants out there.   Also, the service is amazing; with the way they were refilling my coffee cup, I'm sure I got a bit more caffeine than I bargained for.

4579811,2012-06-09,2,xiAiahsdBfTxYCFfvZmMfQ,"Great place to have breakfast... actually I think it may be the only place to have breakfast... in Palazzo. I was hoping to get some tasty treats at the Bouchon bakery while taking a mid-morning break in our girls shopping day but then I realized that it was way on the other side of Venetian. So I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and found this place. I was a little nervous because it said it was part of the spa but actually even though it is on the fourth floor and adjacent to the spa entrance, it is completely separate. Most people there appeared to be tourists just having brunch. I am sure that some of them may have been doing a spa day but no one was sitting around in a bathrobe with mud on their face or anything.

My sisters ordered wraps and I didn't try any of their meals but they all seemed to like them. As for me, I ordered the breakfast relleno and it was fantastic. I have lived in the southwest almost my whole life but I have never had anything quite like this.  It was basically scrambled eggs with chorizo (the Mexican kind that is crumbled like ground beef, not the Spanish hard sausage) stuffed inside a large steamed Poblano chili and the whole thing was served atop a bed of soft, creamy polenta.  It was delicious! I was so happy that the chili was not battered and fried like most chili rellenos are.  It actually had a really sweet flavor to it that was perfect for a breakfast dish. And the chorizo was not greasy at all. I did not think it tasted like a soy product but if it is real meat then it must be made out of the leanest pork money can buy since it had all the flavor of chorizo but none of the grease. In fact, the whole dish had only 330 calories and 14 grams of fat (they had the stats on the menu) which is about the same as one of the meals I would eat when I was on Jenny Craig except that it tasted like 1,000 times better.  It also came with a side cup of fruit that I barely touched since I got so full.  So that tells you they have good portion sizes, too.  Not huge and overflowing like most breakfast places but not so small that you leave hungry.

Even though this was a spa cafe with a healthy menu this is Vegas so they did also have a full bar. Three of us got Bloody Marys and agreed that they were excellent.  Very light and fresh tasting. They also had a good peppery kick that I really liked. My friend ordered one of their $7 specialty organic cocktails which she said was tasty but weak. So we all had a good meal here and enjoyed ourselves. The service was not memorable but adequate. I loved my food and drink so much I may have actually given them five stars if the ambiance was a little nicer. Since it is next to the spa I was expecting a zen atmosphere with decor composed of organic materials and maybe a water feature. But it was just a dining room like any other hotel breakfast place. It could have even passed for a Denny's.  I know they are a little of the beaten path but I think if they spruced it up a little they could be more of a destination spot. But I do recommend it if you are in the Palazzo hotel and want a yummy, healthy, and affordable breakfast or lunch.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,3,2,4,UpFk09azJsvoT8m0pCLxfQ

I went here thanks to the Yelp app because I was looking for a place to get a smoothie and I was staying in this area of the Strip.  Canyon Ranch is great because you can create your own smoothie, and they use REAL fruit.  This is not juices or sorbets or what have you.  The 20 ounce is $9, which is definitely higher than your local Jamba Juice, but considering the location (one of the nicest hotels on the Strip) plus the fact that they use real fruit (when no one else near there does) I think the price is totally fine.  I have pretty specific instructions regarding my smoothies, I like to have them how I make them at home.  Canyon Ranch did a great job.  All three days I had a guy named Michael make my smoothie, and it was fantastic and consistent.  Can't recommend this place enough if you are in need of a smoothie.

The breakfast burrito was the only food item I tried, and it's the reason I am giving Canyon Ranch 4 stars instead of 5.  It has a lot of ingredients, which may be why it didn't resonate with me.  Too much going on perhaps.  There was something in there that I couldn't put my finger on for which I didn't care.  I didn't even eat half of it.

Excellent service, attentive staff.  Always kept my glass full of water. A relaxing, quaint lil' place.  I actually did a little reading while I was there (yeah, I know, what am I doing reading in Vegas?!) and it did not feel out of place at all.  A truly delightful lil' escape.",4an_jbW1wyOt3GC4gk6GaQ,0,0,5,mYByeJTLS2QawKCGWe7ADg

Once you get to the designated floor, you'll pass a hallway with rooms, and then enter the spa area.  This restaurant is bright and the area exits into the pool if you want a peek (the Venetian and Palazzo pools join if you take a walk...).

The food was healthy and delicious.  Had a bite of the breakfast burrito and the breakfast sandwich.  The fruit was cut up and served in a small cup with a few drips of orange juice.  Genius, and tasty idea.  The pomegranate smoothie was great (but $5 for that size was too much - I could go to jamba juice and get something larger in size).  

The location is lovely, it was quiet and obviously done clean and simple for the people heading to the spa; a great getaway from crowded breakfast places in Vegas.",H0Dq_zK4Ceepkd1KdDK7BQ,1,0,4,tLhCPko7gIiKoMdsg7RC2w
