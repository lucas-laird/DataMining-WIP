138048,2014-09-29,0,ZQBUBnccfiCzQTrEwNy-xw,Great for training or staying healthy. It's perfect for people who don't have the time to prepare each meal or the knowledge to portion it out. Also great for people who are too lazy to make there own healthy food. Definitely a good deal if your time and health are valuable to you.,_1wNTDPZl7HhVXJyFO81Jw,0,0,5,PgIiZIOgOIqAT4kz2Vjq_g

The shakes are where it's at. The walberry shake is delicious, I get one almost everyday.",8HyODWHxD1Vmq5O7HeJe-A,2,0,4,ZbiHvGu4XLUDTrcPiPHNnw

The green fixins shake is delicious. Overpriced? Maybe by a little but worth it for me. Love this place. Great friendly service. Wish there was one in my hometown.",fBSvGA-z16KOUV_0V7m9Ww,0,0,5,8OBQswlSOh2X0aVB3fOpGA

4143712,2015-06-29,0,ZQBUBnccfiCzQTrEwNy-xw,"Places shouldn't use yelp to advertise and issue a check-in  discount if they don't want you using it. Had a check in discount with no mention that it couldn't be used on curtain items. I have only had the shakes/smoothies here. They are good and worth an extra few dollars for the convenience. For the most part this place is overpriced. I would never eat the food here, because i like my arms and legs and don't want to pay that for food. I guess that's what happens with a monopoly on the market. Overall good shakes, overpriced food and a slight attitude. 

Not a fan of people using yelp, issuing check in discounts with no mention that it can't be used on certain items.",AuC6R6-F2tZsISm7NIriOw,1,0,3,iI9zIEHjRAKHr1Z1Xk1Oew
4255157,2015-06-05,0,ZQBUBnccfiCzQTrEwNy-xw,"Over hyped and over priced. Solid healthy food but my food was overlooked. I think the cute servers are friendly and they apparently have a meal plan that gives 20% discount. 

Still it was better than anything in the Rio.  

I wish I tried their beef or chicken instead. It looked really good",7Cw8G2Fg5hPr4w2NwnmLMQ,0,0,3,qVoN8yPLQNQv_OvFr8b6fQ
4594122,2014-03-16,0,ZQBUBnccfiCzQTrEwNy-xw,"Simply put, this is the best food offering of any place in Vegas when it comes to optimal nutrition and supporting a healthy lifestyle. While other restaurants may offer grass fed beef or wild fish, Dave takes into account the ingredient quality, nutrient density, and offers only options that will improve overall health.

Whether you are following the Whole30, strict paleo, gluten-free, or just value what you put in your body, there is simply no other option for 100% natural and sustainable meals in Vegas outside of Whole Foods Town Square, to a certain extent.

As an aside, I don't normally use supplements but even the smoothies are awesome. Tip of the cap, Dave! Keep up the good work...",CjuqjBf1ZPWSMEBJidPJ9Q,6,2,5,s0VELeE4edM2WGgWHwGusg
5883357,2013-11-12,0,ZQBUBnccfiCzQTrEwNy-xw,"This food is amazing!! So healthy and fresh which usually means not a lot of flavor but not here! Dave has put together healthy recipes full of flavor. Be cautious, when something on the menu says ""spicy"" it's definitely hot, so beware.",nDQ83M6KkH1cltLOLUsYKw,1,0,5,zcj89W-vfQiFMiAfsUozYA
