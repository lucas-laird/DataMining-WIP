The happy hour is a good deal with $5 creative martinis.  You can take the drinks across the hall to the sushi restaurant as well.  All-in-all a nice hotel bar.,zDVMxnAPhtA37rjdwETFKQ,0,0,3,h23kWkzi-a_ExvsrpGioeg

It is not a place for children so don't bring them in.  Second - do not ask what's on DRAFT - when there are no drafts served or even present at the bar.  It's a WINE/Martini bar for adults!  Also, this casino is for the older generation - I'm talking grandparents!  We were the youngest people in the place, but didn't bother us.  Quiet, lounge-y - great escape from the loud casino, kids, etc.  GREAT bartender, Antony - made us the best Mike's Lemon Drop Martini and a Caramel Apple Martini.  They do have a menu - which is the same food as the Irish pub next door.  I had the fish and chips - delish - and my husband had a burger and fries, which was great.  Fries were really good - battered and crispy.  Perfect portions so you aren't stuffed.  Love how quiet and relaxing this place is.  A hidden gem.  Our new cozy, Martini joint.",xVfK4hxPqr57SRleHT1U5w,1,0,5,F8RXZBW03viaUvWI2TyoKg

I ordered the fish and chips and was underwhelmed. They have a good (cheap!) drinks menu - $5 wine, martinis and craft beer. I found an awesome beer here (Unibrew) for $5, which was pretty awesome. The bar tender was a bit hoity, telling me that I wouldn't like it. Listen buddy, just because I'm a woman doesn't mean that I don't know my beers well! 
Also, maybe it was because I was there on a Wednesday night around 10 PM, but the clients were also sort of weird...",UMD7kQkVPOvjiaFS6Z0CKQ,1,0,2,WXARf_9dKaTubiNwto71NQ

I met the bartender, courtney, who was very helpful in picking out a drink! Also she was very knowledgable about the entire casino!! Such a friendly environment!! Really enjoyed our night :)",XX_ZZP4C20ilHUFPsJ6FDA,1,0,5,NHqD1EkRyyTdYglcQTGhSg
2507039,2014-08-11,0,X2qnigcKuTWL7x9fS2ZUdw,"Was in tonight 8/10/14 for happy hour from 5-7.  Had the 221 martini, otto skins, & chic cookie w/ice cream.  Was at the pool and had fish taco plate.  We had 1 toni, 2 glasses of wine, skins, & cooke.  Was $ 29.60 something.  The skins came w/5, the cookie w/ice cream is for 2 people.  Tini's were in regular glass.  I know some places will give you a smaller glass for happy hr.  All tin's are regular $ 10.00.  Bartendar was great.  Was welcoming and invited us back.  Very small, but cozy, comfy chairs, tables, and bar seats.  I'll go back.",Q34Y13_vN3hHH61Hatd6CQ,0,0,4,nCV4L6P3IYjHg0oaQc01yA

A nice peaceful respite from the clamor of the casino. The interior of this place is really nice and the wine selection is pretty good . I had a great Pinot Noir. I do wish it was open for lunch, though. Actually, it's open hours are entirely the reason I didn't give it more stars. Three times this week while here for a convention, my friends and I have been run out at TEN PM. Really?!? One of these times, I watched the bartender turn away at least ten people between 9:45 and 10:00, telling them he was about to close. And this was on a FRIDAY night. So it doesn't even matter if they have paying customers, it seems.",SnVvZIotFCpjncVYnnxdYg,2,0,2,ytoNwEb9sNiP0GHtJJ9y5A

The crab cakes were good, menu is small but this is a place to just have a bite and a few drinks.",ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw,0,0,4,0w_yin-LU5xYpxb-62KOEA
5315826,2016-03-18,0,X2qnigcKuTWL7x9fS2ZUdw,It was nice they took the overflow from the Irish restaurant next door.  I think the prices could have been better. I had the Beef and Guinness pie. For $14 you could've gotten a little more and the puff pastry on top could've been bigger. I've been to Ireland and I've had their version and believe it or not they served steak fries with every order. And next time let people know that there are mushrooms in it. However the taste was very good but the portion could've been larger for the price. My companions had a corn beef sandwich and the fish and chips. They appeared to enjoy theirs as well.,twkMzQGzP3umqj3VjoiZKQ,0,0,4,_8sY8ovfG0bA6GeYllz2yw
5583220,2011-06-09,0,X2qnigcKuTWL7x9fS2ZUdw,"Wow.  Ok. so this is a 21 and over bar which was a problem because we brought our daughter.  However, you can eat from the 221 menu next door at the Irish restaurant/bar which is not 21 and over so we were able to try the food.  This may be my new favorite place.  They have three tapas plate columns, the first are meat (2 meet) and include 2 lamb, 2 meatballs, 2 chicken satay, 2 ribs or 2 sliders for just 6 dollars.  The seafood menu (2 see) is $7.00 each and is also 2 of everything (although we received 3 shrimp).  The final column is 1 Good Time which includes a cheese tray, meat tray, mussles, bruschetta, and a tortilla flatbread. These are $8.00 each and are larger portions.  There are also unique sandwiches such as a DLT (Duck Confit, bacon, lettuce and tomato with a blueberry mayo)
We absolutely loved the cheese tray which included Blue Cheese, a sharp cheddar, and a cheese which tasted great but we could not identify.  It also included blueberries in syrup, crustini, grapes and strawberries.  The mussles were the largest we have ever seen and had a good flavor to them.  The shrimp and scallops were excellent and we were full from this small sampling.  

They have happy hour and late night specials and serve dinner until 11.  You won't be disappointed if you go here or eat from the menu in the more casual irish bar.  This place is refreshing and surprisingly inexpensive for a restaurant located in the JW Marriot/Rampart Casino restaurant row.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,8,2,4,ZfW-q9KIp-Rvif2JalQv6w
