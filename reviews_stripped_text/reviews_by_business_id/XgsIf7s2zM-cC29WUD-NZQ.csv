The place was crowded with seating close together, so at times it was difficult to walk between tables, which you have to do to access the buffet. Service was good (drinks were refilled often, dirty dishes cleared frequently, etc...). The food was nothing to write home about.  The hot food was not hot enough, the tempura was soggy, and the sushi rolls did not taste fresh. The pieces of sushi seemed fresh because that seemed to be what was being consumed and therefore turned over quickly. When I got the bill, I noticed the drink was an extra charge, which surprised me because buffets in town include a beverage in the price of the meal.

Next goes to the selection of food, I expected from them to have a sushi selection. They had rolls on one side, nigiri on another. also some other cold plate area. They had oysters as well. Their hot food didn't have a big selection either. But i am giving them and extra star for their ramen, which i didn't expect so that was cool.

Their desserts were so-so. Honestly i don't remember what i had, besides the ice cream, which when i asked for my scoop, and the lady was pretty rude. Ummm If you hate your job, don't let it show. So there goes another demerit.

For dessert the crème brule was one of the best I've eaten.

631245,2013-06-27,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"I enjoyed a meal at Makino years ago, so I decided to return on a recent trip.   It was Father's Day (June 16th 2013) so I checked the website to get the hours and prices, and decided to go early to avoid the crowd.  According to the website the Irvine location would be slightly higher priced but they would be offering King crab legs (instead of just snow crab legs), but the Las Vegas locations would have a normal menu and pricing.

I arrived to find a paper sign noting the price was jacked by $2/pp simply because it was Fathers Day, so customers were ""bait and switched"" at the door.  And no King crab legs.

Since I'm alone I'm seated by the door and hostess/cashier, which is fine for me.  The sushi is good but the tempura sauce tastes weird/bitter, and eventually I start to feel ill.  Having eaten nothing else all day, it could only be the Makino food.  As I get out my credit card to make a quick exit, the waitress rushes over to take it from me, despite the fact that the cashier station is 6 feet in front of me.  

She seems to process my transaction, but then gets into a long chat with the cashier (at least 2 minutes) while I am sitting there feeling worse by the minute.  She finally turns around, realizes that I am staring at her while she ignores her customer, and quickly brings the receipt to me to sign.  Between feeling ill and being annoyed that instead of just paying and going I had to sit through her chat, I did not realize that my credit card was not returned with the bill.

I wisely immediately drove back to my hotel so that I could be near a toilet for a lovely evening of diarrhea, rather than enjoying the sights of Las Vegas with friends as had been planned.

On the drive home to Southern California the next day, I stopped for gas and realized my credit card was gone, last seen at Makino.  After arriving home I called the restaurant and was told ""we no keep credit card"", but when I insisted that it was definitely there, another female came on the line and admitted they have my credit card.  I asked her to mail it to me, and she responded with ""OK!"" and hung up... without asking my address!!!

I immediately called back and told her I am now 300 miles away so it will have to be mailed and I can't just come pick it up.  The hostess then starts to argue with me, 'you left the card here', and I replied, ""NO, my waitress did not return it with my bill!"".  She then said that she would have to have a manager call me back and took my phone number.   I was never called back, and had to report the incident to my bank.  I am also filing a formal complaint against their Visa Merchant account, since they violated the terms of service and acted inappropriately when their error was show to them.

So.... If you enjoy bad service, management that KEEPS your credit card, gouges customers on Fathers' Day, and serves food that causes diarrhea, Makino Decator is the place for you!",zc2nUaA3lIxIvFtS1t7U-g,3,0,1,g6kKiwXYESELm106Wsj41Q

The hot items were almost warm, and by almost warm I do not mean they were kinda hot, more like kind of room temperature. I love sushi, been to many AYCE sushi places, definitely would not go here for sushi. Unless that is if you think it is ok if you cannot tell the difference between there salmon and there tuna when you close your eyes because all of there fish is either tasteless or fishy, oh and that too is room temperature.
      Pretty sure raw fish sitting out and being served at room temperature is in fact a food safety violation, I am really hoping I do not get sick for being dumb enough to eat the pieces I had on my plate. There rolls were ok they actually had flavor,  mostly due to the sauce however. All those that say this place has good sushi probably are also the same people that call a california roll or some roll with mayonnaise and or cream cheese sushi, they are not. 
     The place was empty at lunch time on a friday, I can taste why that is. The staff I will admit was friendly and service was what you would expect at a buffet, the food however was nothing special. Money not so well spent. Quality lacking, I am really disappointed in yelper on this one, I followed the advice of some people that obviously do not really care what they put in there mouth when I read the reviews on this place. One last comment, in case you did not notice that I really did not care for their ""sushi"" I should just say that if I was rating only on there sushi I would have given them only 1 star, the second star came in because they have some good appetizer type selections such as the calamari, pickled cucumbers, seaweed salad, udon, kim chee along with some others such as edemame.

First, because we'd tried to go to their dinner buffet at 9 pm the previous night, but were turned away because they were taking away the food. But I managed to get a glimpse of a gleaming heap of oysters and crab legs that was decidedly lacking at the lunch buffet. 

Second, because all the rolls were tasteless and bland and seemed to be variations of the same thing. I hate deceit! 

Third, because of their small selection of fresh sashimi -- I love mackerel, but I was sad to see a few paltry pieces in the corner.

The best thing about Makino was the dessert bar's chocolate fountain. Holy shit I had no idea how fabulous a thing a chocolate fountain could be. Bowls of fruit and marshmallows with long sticks and a yum yum yummy chocolate coating. But it kind of pissed me off when they turned it off at 2:30, a half hour before their stated closing time.

Now it's just okay and far from where it was.  Changed to some type of rice that was dry and had a cheap taste to it, dishes for wasabi have changed to disposable plastic.  Tuna is too red and appears to have color added.  Since when do you put pieces of carrot in sushi rolls unless you're looking for a cheap filler?  Too many rolls have cream cheese.  I like cream chees but should have a slight presence in sushi rolls.  The final straw of 'cheapness' is that they don't even have toothpicks anymore.

1002698,2016-06-03,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"I am an avid sushi go-er and have been for the past 10 years that I have lived in Las Vegas. I have tried sushi from the high end places and places that, based on location alone, one would probably never even dare to try. So it's safe to say that I know my sushi and I know when sushi is good....and when it is not good. Today was my boyfriend's birthday and he is also a sushi lover. I was trying to surprise him with somewhere new because for a while now we have gone to the same sushi place (because we KNOW it is good) and I stumbled upon this place Makino while searching for top all-you-can-eat-sushi in Las Vegas that also didn't break my bank account. I chose Makino for its high review ratings and because they offered a wide range of desserts unlike most other all--you-can-eat sushi restaurants that only offer a few (my boyfriend loves desserts and I wanted him to have a wide selection on his birthday, but most sushi places only offer a few desserts). 

Upon walking in, I must say that I was quite ecstatic; honestly from the entrance you can't see much except the dessert section and boy did those desserts look good. I was proud of myself when I looked up at my boyfriend's face and saw that he too looked very excited by the dessert table ( we both have sweet tooths); However, the gleeful period did not last long. As soon as were seated we headed to the sushi section and low and behold an array of sushi. Based on appearance, I was expecting the sushi to taste wonderful because it all looked so pretty. What initially bothered me though was that there was no way to tell what each roll consisted of. There were no labels at all above the sushi that told me what was inside of each roll so I selected based upon appearance alone. The first roll that I tasted actually tasted pretty good. It was a bit warmer than I would have preferred my sushi but it was still pleasant. I jumped into the next bit of sushi on my plate thinking it'd be just as good, but that wasn't the case. My mouth immediately became overwhelmed with fishiness (not the good subtle kind, but the kind when fish is spoiled) and I tried to swallow it down but it was so strong that I had to spit it into my napkin. On top of that being embarrassing since my boyfriend was right next to me, I was not eager at all to try anymore of the sushi; however, I did try one more piece just to see if maybe it was a one time deal, but nope. The next piece I put it in mouth had some type of fish in it that was so blatantly dry that it was tough to swallow without choking down water as well. 

I was disappointed to say the least because the main reason I went there was for the sushi because we both love sushi so much, but when I looked over at my boyfriend's plate he had hardly touched his sushi (and he NEVER lets food go to waste, especially sushi). Even though the sushi was pretty bad, we moved on to the other food. Crab legs, clams, fried rice, even chow mein; we tried pretty much everything there because we were hungry and figured that maybe it was just the sushi that was bad. But no. It wasn't just the sushi. I stacked my plate with chow mein, clams, calamari, fried rice, salmon, vegetables tempura etc.; The ONLY thing that I thought tasted good was the vegetables tempura (and if that had been bad I would have been amazed because it's pretty hard to make something fried taste bad). The clams were mushy liked they'd been overcooked, the fried rice seemed to have no flavor besides the oil it was cooked in, and the same with the chow mein. 

Lastly, we gave Makino one last chance; one last chance to impress us and we hoped badly that at least the yummy looking desserts would be delicious. We both tried all of the desserts and while they weren't incredible, they weren't bad either. The textures on most of them were odd, not creamy as they appeared but rather more jello like, but neither of us minded that because they tasted good. The cookies were all fairly good, and the chocolate mousse was the one that impressed me. 

All in all if someone asked me if I would recommend this place I would say absolutely not. The only reason I even gave it two stars was one for the ambiance because the place was relaxed, even for a buffet, and the other star goes to the chocolate mousse. I'm usually not this critical and actually never leave reviews but I felt it was necessary this time because I do not think this place is at all worth the $60 I spent ($27.99 per person + tax). I hope if you try it you have a better experience and that maybe my boyfriend and I just went on a bad day.",4mSPKJBHpkovM5YRrveEdQ,1,0,2,iubIMVDARFHRONQVvvuSlw

Today I went again. I got my plate and when I went to get sushi, there were three mexican sushi chefs loudly carrying on a conversation in spanish. OK, I get that times are tough and the first rate sushi places get the real Japanese chefs. But do you have to alienate your customers with something this out of place in a sushi restaurant? 

I then noticed the jalapeño slices on the sushi. WHAT??? Is this some kind of odd mexican fusion restaurant now? I then noticed the talipia. OK, so this place is no longer a sushi place. 

I went into full on restaurant food critic mode. The salads were not tasty and were poorly made. The hand rolls had canned tuna in them. The soups were just sad. I saw a few things that made me question their food sanitation.

On our first night arriving in Vegas after 4 hours drive from LA, we headed to Makino with high recommendations from local Vegas friends. 

Their all-you-can eat seafood selections include sea bass, grilled salmon, calamari steak, and baked clams. Their spicy tuna, salmon & rainbow rolls were da bomb. 

And for the sweet tooth desserts, they have chocolate & strawberry mousses, fresh fruits, and lots of assorted cakes.

If you are in Vegas and like Japanese and asian fusion food, gotta try out Makino. And it's relatively cheaper priced compared to the hotel/casino buffet counting to spend around $25-26 for dinner or $16-17 for lunch.",vx2-TAqHZ0WTHIE4UCwRXw,1,0,4,6AVoqkOWcGpd4pJ4RYwk8A

We ordered our plates and set out to the buffet.  The diversity of dishes was good, but the selection of rolls, Sushi, and Sashimi was limited.  We loaded up our plates and sat down to eat.  

The first comment that came out of my friends mouth was that her sashimi was lukewarm - like, sat out for a while warm.  We kept eating and each bite was as unexciting as the last.  No good flavors, weird, congealed textures - it all just seemed unfresh - not something you usually expect - especially for $30 a head.

Disappointed, we stopped eating before we had finished our first plates and tried to think of how we should proceed.  None of us wanted to keep eating, but felt that we had invested far too much to not get a good meal.  Finally, I decided to call the waitress over and very politely let her know that we didn't like our food.

She went away and spoke to her manager (who i found out was the owner) and told me there was nothing she could do.  I persisted and she brought him over.  He told me that there was nothing he could do because I had started eating the food (well duh- how would I know it was bad).  He then claimed that I must not like sushi (the moment when I was glad I was sitting with two Asian girls).  Finally he told me he would remove one of our meals from the bill. So - eventually we paid $60 for three people to eat a few scraps of food.  

I wouldn't recommend this place - warm, congealed sushi for $30 a person.",QjqtjQqJxTW-c6lhM8_ZsA,1,0,1,93lhofLqDDMyhdeR5QFRzA

The goods, (1) Sushi was fantastic. The detailed presentation, precise cuts, use of colors and tight hand rolls adds sophistication. The sauces complement the sushi rolls and the garnishes adds ""brightness"" (a cheffy term) to the overall sushi. I've never seen so much variety and creativity in a presentation. (2) The fresh soups are prepared for you ""live"", just say what type of soup and they'll mix & match garnishes and veggies. The broth was nice and hot, full of flavor and quite savory. The garnishes adds freshness and crunch to the soup. (3) The variety of baked fish adds a nice warm component to the menu, all well-seasoned.

The bads, (1) the sashimi was okay. Seemed a bit dry and lacking of taste (my cousin went as far as saying it tasted processed/manufactured). I do believe they're fresh but not as juicy as other sashimi places. (2) some of the meat dishes were dry and overly looked, especially the medallion with bacon wrapped. My dad's medallion was super dry, he said. (3) I wish they had more fruit variety in the desserts section. Some of the strawberries and grapes were over-ripped. 

Service was also great, wait staff very attentive and cleared our plates quick. My mom asked them 4 separate times to take pictures of our party (I felt embarrassed about that, but my mom insisted). Refilled water and hot tea/coffee non stop. Prices $$ are just right for this quality. By the way, it was raining and the roof was leaking! They put 5 buckets to catch the water.

On the buffet menu is everything from decent sushi rolls (bit too much rice though) , to udon, fish, suki yaki beef,  tempura, teriyaki chicken, salads, and more. 
There is also a dessert buffet: red bean/green tea ice cream, pies, cakes, and a chocolate fountain.

After a long drive out to Grand Canyon and back.  We made it to Makino's quite late.  We got there by 8:50pm.  We did call ahead of time and they indicated they closed at 9:30pm.  So we figured,  Ok we can eat till 9:30, which gives us about 40 minutes.  WRONG.  

We got out table started eating.  at 9:10pm, they started removing everything.. and i mean everything.  I was thinking, WTF???? They're business hour sign says close at 9:30pm.. which means, customer's can actually come in up to 9:30pm, right?  

After our second plate, that was it.. other than a few left over plates they were wanting the remaining customer's to clean out.  They litterally started cleaning everything out, while there were still a lot of customer's still eating.  I would say about 10~12 table of customers still eating.  By 9:20pm, almost all the food was gone (as in the worker's cleaned it out), and even the desserts were all stacked up on a cart.. My buddy and i almost felt as we were burdening them to ask for a scoop of ice cream for dessert.  

This is ridiculous... I dont know if the owner's are aware of this practice?
But i think if you're charging your customers the full dinner prices of $26.00 or so.. despite the fact the workers may want to hurry up and go home.. or maybe try and catch the late poker tournament... but if you're business hours says close at 9:30pm..  and you have customer's eating, getting rid of all the food and pretty much pressuring your customers to hurry up and eat and leave by 9:30pm.. is very poor business practice.

They should've at least advice us at 8:50pm, that all the foods will be removed for closing by 9:10pm.. Rather than just charging us the full price, and then pretty much rushing us out of there.

In a city where there's full of buffets, good restuarants.. I have to admit, the food was not bad.  Todai quality... or maybe a tad bit better.. but very bad business practice.  So if you're planning to hit Makino's somewhat late.. dont forget to immediately get about 3 plates full of stuff you want...",oiaYM41M1zYSKSQnaf-ljw,0,0,3,HRrix0d3j1NdElBrTbe7pA

Service is adequate, but the food is sorely lacking.  In the past, I have noticed that the nigiri sushi is not being filled regularly even though the ""sushi chef""  is standing right behind the empty plate looking at it for what seems a good 10-min on the lunch rush.  

Yesterday, my wife and I noticed that the rice on nigiri sushi seems to have gotten a bit bigger, while the fish is now paper thin.

They also had a soup called ""beef soup.""  It was very spicy and the taste was not pleasant.  It looked like something that their Hispanic ""chefs"" put together and set out on the buffet line.  There was nothing Japanese about that soup whatsoever and after a few sips we stopped eating this altogether.

Not too many sashimi choices though. We are big salmon sashimi lovers, and they did not have any :(  They had some salmon sushi, however the salmon slices were a little on the thin side.

Good selection of desserts including ice cream (green tea, chocolate, vanilla etc; which you can get in a cone and take to go), creme brûlée, chocolate fountain (but no strawberries to dip), creme puffs, and other little cakes. This place was okay, but we have definitely been to better buffet places. If you are looking for a decent buffet that is not as expensive as those on the strip (and if you don't mind driving a few minutes away from the strip), this place may be worth trying.

One thing they have correct is that it is significantly better than Todai.  However, even the hot selections and dessert buffet couldn't save this place.  The fish was all chewy and old tasting, and the place was PACKED (we stopped in on Christmas Eve).  Those don't add up; the plates were being constantly swapped out, there should have been some decent nigiri choices, but literally every piece of nigiri was a chore to chew and swallow.  Usually, I love the fish and want to leave the rice-- but here I was tempted to leave the fish and just eat the pretty decent sushi rice.  I will say the sushi is far better than any other buffet line sushi I've ever had, but the Yelper's made it seem like better quality could be expected.  In the end, it's still buffet line sushi-- Sushi lovers don't be conned!

The price point is wrong too.  Lunch may be a decent value, but there are far better hot asian buffets in town for the hot foods at a much cheaper price, and for the same price I can name at least a half a dozen absolutely primo quality AYCE cooked/prepared to order sushi places (actually; with this place clocking in at $25.99 most of the better places are even a few bucks less).  There's really no winning stategy here-- They have decent crab legs, but if it's crab you want there are much cheaper places. And the sushi is borderline gross.  

Heck, if you want crab, for a few bucks more you can ditch the snowcrab and crackers and head over to the Wynn or Bellagio where the crab is King Crab, and the work is already done for you.  On the westside, headout a few more blocks until you get to Hikari, where they will beat every dish served at this buffet for roughly the same price (or less if you are a good looking lady after 11 pm).  And Hikari isn't even the best alternative.

If you like sushi, don't waste your money here and go to a real sushi bar.  One Yelper writes: ""One of the best sushi buffet around in the west coast.""  The sad thing is they may be right.",jmM_nn2kK6CnYenMz7wmHw,0,0,1,7Ei8v6NAPiKI_pC9FatLfA

I worry about where this place will be when I visit Vegas again as I really liked it! So I'm hoping my review will be a one-off rather than the norm.

We came in looking for the oysters we'd scarfed down in the past, but to my dismay they were replaced by fried oysters which were too much, too greasy for my taste. The crab legs were still present, thankfully, and if you're looking for your fix there -- well, Makino's still got it.

Sushi was good, but I'm a strategic guy when it comes to buffets. Don't want that rice to fill up my belly! Nevertheless there were a couple that I tried that I was happy with. My rule with this area: if it looks good... Go for it.

I pretty much stuck with the crab legs and ventured out into some other unmemorable items. Miso soup & kebabs to name a few. Biggest disappointment was with the green tea ice cream at the end, as it was super bland.

In general, this restaurant is located in the Food 4 Less shopping complex on Decatur.  Parking in the area is a bit cramped.  Both times, we had to park farther away than expected.

The restaurant is laid out with buffet style - cart tables that are located on the far wall of the restaurant.  Tables are nicely spaced out.

Our waitress was very good.  She took care of us and kept an eye on us the whole time.

Now the food:
a.  Salad -- it is okay.  sometimes it is fresh; however, some of the greens are a bit old.
b.  Oyster -- this was our hit and miss.  I love oysters.  During our first trip, oysters were plump, juicy, and fresh.  yay!!!  On our second trip, it was not too fresh at all... small and not appealing
c.  Snow crab legs -- extremely disappointing.   Did they happen to buy anorexic Snow Crabs?  These things were frail and thin... Honestly, both trips, I was a bit shocked.  Being a seafood lover, I was sadly disappointed.
d.  Sushi -- this is why you are here.  They have a good assortment of sushi to choose from.  I prefer sushi with ""eel"" in it.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a selection (they have only like 2-3 eel dishes).  Overall, the sushi is fresh, it is good as well.

In summary, I took the average of both my visits and came to a 3 star.  Maybe, 3.25 is more fitting.  For 25 bucks a person, I would prefer some other places though.... I would recommend instead:

-- If you like crab legs, hands down, go to Asia Buffet off of Eastern Avenue for only like 19.99 on Fri or Sat -- these things are plump there.  Also, oysters are amazing.
-- If you like sushi, this place is fine.  However, the better place is Sushi-mon (corner of Maryland and Silverado)~ 27 bucks per person.

After all, most of our best recommendations for places to eat in Vegas have come from locals. He said if we like sushi (and we love it), we should try Makino!

I'm always a little wary of sushi buffets because let's face it, raw fish that's left out for a while... not the most appetizing thing. But I was pleasantly surprised by my trip to Makino-- I think we all were! 

I can see why there may be negative reviews, but for us, the sushi and sashimi were refreshed regularly (thank goodness!) and was really quite delicious. They had a good mix of sushi and non-sushi items, which was good for the members of our party who were not as big sushi fans as the rest of us were. They have an udon noodle station, and really scrumptious mussels!

And even though this place is AYCE sushi, I have to talk about the desserts. Chocolate fondue fountain? Green tea ice cream? And fresh fruit (I am a fruit monster)? Love. The green tea ice cream is super yums, though the annoying thing is you have to wait for someone to get it for you, so try and go when there's no line.

Location-wise, it's sort of off the strip, but we could see the sign for it from our room at Palms Place, so if you're staying at the Palms, definitely go check it out!

Great sushi but everything else is just ok. I tried the shrimp and veggie tempura, and fried dumplings. They were all just ok. I loved the green tea ice cream! Just $20 a person on a weekday afternoon.",yTm944r8hCGTAvdKO6Z9cw,4,1,4,If6ztxvvxpwWm2F5W5qwEw

First, the 5 stars I'm giving are as much about value and service as the food. If you are looking for the $12 per piece sushi bar flavor or experience, you're not going to get that at Makino. You will get all you can eat, buffet style sushi, roles, tempura, seafood and deserts at a price that is more then fair.

The staff is always very pleasant and attentive. The beer is cold and the tea hot. Nothing sits around long enough to not be fresh. If you like sushi and you can't find $35.00 worth of something you like, you are either confusing sushi for McDonalds or you are the emperor of Japan and this is just beneath you.

My rule of thumb with ethnic food... If no one is speaking German, it's not much of a German restaurant. If there are no Chicano's there, you're at El Torito. Makino seems to have the ethnic cred.",C9KbGKrby4tIx9Qp3KwVpg,2,1,5,VOysQacjHlnR-rSlTlQVOw

But you know what they say about too much of a good thing. All of the aromas and visuals paralyzed me into submission. After a few bites, I felt immobile. I feel that if I had ordered the rolls a la carte, they would have been consumed without any issues. The mere fact that there was an abundance traumatized my entire sense of fact vs. fiction. Hunger and desire was no longer an issue. With so much goodness available, it was as if a curse was broken. I was freed from ever wanting more.

As much as I love them, I have to say they truly outdid themselves tonight.  The array of seafood was vast to say the least.  The colors of sushi prepared before me looked like art... red roe, green, pink then yellow creams, white and brown sauces, pink, green and black wraps, scallions, peppers, and so may other vegetables and flavorful crunchies adorned each round roll with such exquisite care it looked as if they had taken extra time to get everything just right.  I told one chef it was absolutely beautiful.  He smiled and went back to his work.  It's so nice to eat at a restaurant that takes such pride in its food.  

There are about 5 sushi chefs behind the counter at all times.  I really couldn't tell you what else is on the buffet.  I haven't looked and I don't really care.  It's all about the sushi.  By the way, did you know they do takeout sushi?  30-50 cents per roll.  I hit them on my way home from work and get 2 boxes full for the price of one buffet.  It's a great alternative to cooking after a long day at work and you WON'T ever see this quality of sushi to-go elsewhere.  Believe me, I tried.

My husband, me and his dad were all munching on sushi tonight from Makino while kicking back and watching TV.  I should mention that before trying Makino my husband told me he hated sushi.  Now the only sushi he will eat is from Makino.  His dad told me the same thing tonight.  That was before he tried it.  After the first bite, he was hooked.  If you don't feel up to going out, or would feel lame eating a buffet all by yourself, or like me, know it would be impossible to eat $25 worth of sushi at a buffet.  Dear Lord that's a lot of sushi!  Take out is definitely the way to go.       

Either way, if you stay or go, you'll still be pleased.  I've never had a bland sushi roll at Makino.  They've never been sub-par or fishy.  I know I'm not the only fan as I sat for lunch at work today and a coworker ordered sushi from somewhere else.  He was lamenting the fact that we didn't work closer to Makino.  He had to settle for sushi that had no special sauces, no crispy toppings, no sparkly roe and NO personality... just crab, shimp and scallions inside plain white rice.  Boring.  Unimaginative.  Those are 2 words I can never say about Makino.  

So what are my favorite rolls?  
Crab, cream cheese and cucumber deep fried in batter.  It's absolutely addictive and when I get take-out it usually doesn't make it home.  I've already eaten it on the way.  Eel with teriyaki sauce, scallions, and a crispy topping is a favorite.  I have to be honest... I can identify the octopus, yellowfin, etc... but sometimes I really have no clue what all they are using in those beautiful little rolls.  I've never tried one I didn't like, though.  That's reassuring when you don't always know what you're grabbing.

There was a spicy guacamole tasting one, a bunch of rolls with BBQ sauce on them, a tuna salad one, and many others that were not appetizing to me. I like the classic rolls, and I was glad that they also had some of those. 

I really liked their dessert section. I liked the chocolate fondue and selection of fresh fruits. I also liked their coconut pudding cups and different types of small pastries.

I didn't care for their hot food section. I ate some baked fish, which was just mediocre. I think they should include more cooked vegetables in this section.

I wish that instead of udon, they could make ramen soup. I know ramen is more expensive, but we are paying almost $30 for dinner.",aZrs3xzJHlUN-Yt1jb2AjQ,0,0,3,8wanXF3iZ8fjLuLJKXYrNA

I was surprised to see this place only averages about 3.5 stars.  The majority of ""bad reviews"" complain about non trivial aspects of the restaurant that don't apply to the average person. 

Food quality is always consistent, good variety, and fresh. 

The ratio of fish/rice is better than most full cost restaurants I've been to (they don't overpack the rice or do the old ""double rice roll"" to save on cost. 

Refills and plate clearing are quick.  Can't ask for much more when it comes to a sushi buffet.

We always eat here.
Best price in town for buffet.
Decent seafood.
They had two locations.
We actually started to going the one at the outlets, but that closed down because their 10 year lease was up.
So thats when we started going to this location on Decatur. 
Same food.
Same friendly staff.
Truth be told there are a lot of choices in Vegas when it comes to buffet. 
However almost all of them are in the range of $$$.
Honestly I don't need to be spending $40 - $60 a person for a buffet.
It's just not justified to pay that much.
For first tourists wanting to be ""wowed"" they'll pay that ridiculous prices.
As for myself. Who goes here about 10 times a year, I'm practically a local, no way!
Anyhow here's the low down on Makino LV:

Location is superb. (Especially if you're staying in The Orleans, Gold Coast, Rio, & Palms Casino, literally a 2min drive with no traffic!) 
Regular Lunch $17
Holiday Lunch $20 (Includes all major Holidays)
Regular Dinner $20
Holiday Dinner $24 (Inlcudes all major Holidays)

Their sushi & sashimi are excellent.
Of course its not a trafitional Japanese sushi joint per se, but for the price, you get a decent amount of sushi & sashimi heaven.
I personally always get their Tuna, & Salmon sashimi, as well from their wide selection of rolls.

Cold section they have (not a complete list)
-Various selection of cold sashimi concoctions example: Regular salad, Sashimi salad etc

Hot section they almost always have the following:
-FRIED RICE (with eggs) not bad. not too oily. very sou saucy.
-FRIED NOODLES (it's not Chow Mein) Before it used to be bery salty. But as of our last few visits, it's been improved. Not too salty and prettt darn good.
-KOREAN BBQ I'm not a fan of it. I know my KBBQ, it doesn't taste quite like it. Plus the beef I find to be dry at times because of the heat lamps. Again not a fan.
-FRIED CALAMARI Again not a fan. It's ok. Comes with its own sauce. 
-BAKED SALMON It's actually pretty darn good. It's just that it's overshadowed by the Salmon sashimi, otherwise I'd be all over this.
-BAKED MUSSELS This is one of my favorite. Really good & tasty.
-SHRIMP & VEGETABLE TEMPURA It's really nice that they have the shrimp & the vegetable tempuras separated. Because we all know everyone always goes for the shrimp because it's delicious with the tempura sauce especially. Just be careful because the batter on the tempura coating will fill you up rather quickly!
-BEEF SUKIYAKI Oh my oh my.......My absolute favorite here! It's heaven on a bowl. Honestly, it's good! Beef is absolutely tender. Same for the tofu. Melt in your mouth goodness! The sauce also is really good. It's a meal by itself. Highly recommened it!

SOUP SECTION:
MISO SOUP (never tried this) but they have them premade with the chunks already in bowls. 
All you have to do is choose a bowl you want & then place it on their MISO Soup machine that spits out the soup unto your bowl, with the chunks already in it.

RAMEN SECTION:
The reason why I never tried their Miso Soup.
You have a choice of either Shoyu or Tonkotsu Soup base. Hot, Mild, or Non-Spicy.
You can choose to have more or less of everything off the ramen contents.
I personally always get Tonkotsu, Non Spicy, extra noodles, extra fried onions.....oh and the sauce is fantastic, esecially if you had been drinking the previous night and wanted to re- hydrate your system. It's oh so nourishing!

DESSERT SECTION:
They have multitudes of different cakes & cookies.
Fruits also. They also have a Chocolate Fondue Fountain.
Honestly what kicks ass is their ICE CREAM!
They a various flavors but the only thing that really matters to me is their GREEN TEA, CHOCOLATE, and oh boy it's a perfect ending!

The staff here are all Japanese women (mostly)
Their all cute, very slim especially with their all black uniforms they wear. Their also full of energy & perk.
Make sure to leave a good tip, they work very hard. Always a great time here.

So in conclusion, if you find yourself in Sin City, & wanted to have a decent buffet for a decent price. 
Go no further than Makino on decatur.",gAKvczVm81Zzlzc5-Bziww,14,6,4,rTSZv2gbIxRHSBiw0DkAXQ
2295632,2014-01-29,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"Ok, there are probably much better sushi buffets or AYCE joints around town but for the price you really can't beat Makino. Now that the Premium Outlets location closed, I decided to come to this one. It's been a while since I last visited this location and was probably way back when they first opened it. 

We walked in at around 12:30 PM and were immeidately seated. We noticed that the restaurant was super cramped and crowded compared to the old outlet location, mainly because the space is smaller and it looked like they crammed as many tables as they could into the small space. Our table was about 2 inches away from the table next to us and located right by the dessert area of the buffet, which meant there were constantly people squeezing by. Space aside, our meal was excellent and we left in a dazzed food coma.

The buffet area includes a salad bar, sushi area with various sushi rolls, nigiri and hand rolls, a hot food area serving various appetizers (gyoza, wings, etc) and Japanese food including udon and ramen stations. Lastly there is a dessert area with various sweets, ice cream and a chocolate fountain. We were way too full at the end of our meal to really have dessert, but I can never pass up green tea ice cream and the one here is no exception. I ended up stuffing a scoop down before leaving.

Overall for $17.95 + drinks ($16.95 on weekdays for lunch), you can't beat it anywhere in the valley. Just know that if you come earlier, it could be way more crowded and a line can form. By about 1 PM the crowds died down and we didn't feel as cramped moving around the buffet.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,8,0,4,gY4YHBkEsKVhDnIbtRhtQw

Since Todai closed over a year ago, we have been trying to find another Japanese Sushi and Seafood AYCE buffet in Vegas.

Yes, like other reviews, the setting is not the newest and expect somewhat crowded tables sitting just a few feet from the patrons eating at the next table.  However, the food at this place exceeded my expectations and is much better than at the Todai that closed in Miracle Mile mall.  The selection of sushi, nigiri, sashimi, and hand rolls were vast and tasted fresh and delicious.  The other hot food offerings were OK and adequate though the quality of the Ramen and Udon were close to that of Ramen noodle restaurant and much better than one expected from AYCE.  The dessert choices were fine with the red bean ice cream surprisingly outstanding.  Best value is definitely going during lunch.  The weekend price is only a dollar more than week day prices.  Overall a great ACYE restaurant with high quality sushi and nigiri.  Definitely highlight of our visit this time to Las Vegas finding this gem.

Asian buffets all tend to be the same as well- typical orange chicken and mediocre egg rolls can usually be seen. I'll be the first to admit I did not expect much when I got invited to Makino LV for a birthday party. I thought to myself how this would just be another Asian buffet. It was thus with a pleasant surprise to find Makino LV did stick out and was different good way!

There was no orange chicken or mediocre egg rolls but instead an array of various sushi of all kinds. There was shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, crispy teriyaki chicken, beef short ribs, chicken and vegetable skewers. They also had ramen made to order. Choice of ramen were tonkotsu and Shoyu. Diners could also make their own udon soup. 

From the savory items, I found the beef short ribs to be of good flavor and the crispy teriyaki chicken was tasty! I found the ramen to be a very nice. I got the tonkotsu ramen and the broth was rich and robust in flavor. 

For dessert, sweet lovers could feast on sweet treats like white chocolate raspberry, creme brûlée and Oreo cheesecake! There were fresh ice cream scoops that seemed to be a crowd favorite. Ice cream flavors included red bean, green tea and cookies and cream. My sweet tooth was pleased with my own dessert creation of cookies and cream ice cream topped with a white chocolate raspberry and a cookie brittle.

I totally understand the gratuity part but really $40 gratuity for someone to refill my soda and water cups. Seriously...we had to remind her that we needed some drinks. Oh and we had to ask them to take our plates away.

Besides this, Makino's is one of the best asian buffets I've ever been to.  While their sushi was subpar for me, they still had a pretty wide selection. I really loved their hot foods though because they offered items I've never had elsewhere. Battered items such as tonkatsu and tempura were very fresh, lightly battered, and well prepared. I really enjoyed their sukiyaki as well. The trays and counters were kept clean, and were constantly refilled. You can also order freshly made handrolls, udon, and ramen.

All you can eat sushi places are better than this. I didn't eat the crab legs or the other ""pricey"" items. The nigiri was sad and dry looking. I had a few pieces and traded in my plate for the cooked items. The only thing worth eating was the tempura shrimp and veggies. Trust me when I say go to any other all you can eat sushi for better quality and service(any of them, seriously). If you're visiting from out of town, stick to the bigger buffets that are in the hotels. The M buffet is about $15 more for all you can eat and drink. I'm having a hard time believing that people like this place. Not to offend anyone, but if you enjoyed this place recently, and you ate the sushi, you have no idea what good sushi is.

And it's all about my buffet-obsessed husband.
""for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part""   
He claims that there's a Buffet Clause somewhere in there.  
I am his Reluctant Buffet Queen.

Makino has been his WallyWorld for years, thanks to his work buddies.
We made it a point to get over there on this trip to Vegas.

Showed up 20 minutes early and since it was real chilly outside, decided to wait in the car.
But then he noticed that there were already people lined up at the door.
And then, people were walking past our car to get in line.
""Get out of the car!  Get out of the car!  Hurry!""  
Okay.
By the time the door opened, there was quite a crowd behind us.  He got all excited.  ""Must be good, yeah!""

Gotta say, these diners don't mess around.
It was like the quick or the dead.
I was doing my usual walk by all the counters to see what was offered.
I normally shy away from buffet sushi, but the nigiri looked really good.  So I doubled back.  In less than a minute and there was only 1 piece of salmon nigiri left on the tray!  Daaaang!
Was able to get some tako, ika, ahi, scallop, saba & 1 salmon handroll too.  Only one polite piece of each because there were so many other things I wanted to try.

The hubby's an organized buffet strategist.  By the time I got back to the table with my one plate of sushi and bowl of udon, he had several plates filled with items from different counters.   He looked so adorably happy.

A few mentions:
Nigiri-  The sashimi was good quality.  So good that I didn't bother with the wasabi & shoyu.  Just savored the freshness as is.  The tako (octopus) was especially good; sliced thin & just a bit chewy.
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=wH8jGzPHkcumsawKM8MNWA
The Udon bar-  LOVED this!  There's veggie & shrimp tempura right next and I made a tempura bowl.  There's eggplant, asparagus & sweet potato in with the veggies.  Fresh grated ginger to add in.  The hubby saw how much I was enjoying it and made himself 2 bowls.
Yakisoba & calamari salad-  Hubby's 2 favorites of the day.  Went back for more.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=ZHwl9sFfUcB8DOfl51yijg
Seafood ceviche-  Beautiful & tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=V2SXkPvdLTE0SILfY6DibQ
Dessert bar-  Couldn't resist and got a coffee jello & matcha cake.  Was about to walk away, but that lady asked if I wanted some ice cream.  Might as well, I already knew my glucose reading was going to be high from the starches & fried food.  ""Sure!  Green tea, please!""   (2 hours later- 215)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/makino-lv-las-vegas?select=lwXIaQIL9F0bRAPDAVpoZw

Service-  They're on top of their game here.
The servers were adeptly going in and out amongst the tables, clearing the dishes & refilling the drinks.
The guys in the sushi station were quickly replenishing the trays.

The hubby's expectations were more than fulfilled.  
He was amazed that I ate more than usual.  Well, yeah!  The food offerings were so good that I wanted to eat instead of doing my usual nibbling.
This buffet kicked our butts.  Instead of going to our planned afternoon destination, we went back to our hotel for food coma naps.

Yes.  Return visits & will recommend Makino to friends & family.


Note:  This place is so popular that it was at capacity within 10 minutes!
When we left, there was a crowd out there shivering in the cold, waiting to get in.

15 minutes later, the waitress came. She told us we have 15 minute more to eat.They will be closed in half hour. Why is nobody say anything before we be seated? Continue the good, we think a nice hot soup may warm my heart a little. Guess what, they are not even warm.....

When the check comes, it's 15% gratuity added automatically. With the bad service, bad good and cold soup. I have to pay extra 15% for thanking them robbed me? what's a nightmare. jc",HpxAYVmNi2UXCHodsxZsnQ,0,0,1,y6Fa389HtweizshzmVQ5jA

The price for dinner is a little too expensive for me but I will definitely be back for lunch. 

To Andrew J who made the comment about the chefs I did notice that the sushi chefs were Hispanic and speaking Spanish but It wasn't loud or distracting. I feel it isn't fair to the restaurant that you gave them a lower rating for that reason. While I was there one customer asked one of the chefs for a specific roll and he was nothing but friendly and quick to complete her request. I think its a little racist to demand Asian sushi chefs to consider the food good. I also doubt you would have noticed or cared if the chefs were Vietnamese or from some asian country other than Japan. Cooking good food depends on skill and quality of ingredients not ethnicity. Anyone can cook any style of food regardless of ethnic background.",krdljOLWQ5mNIthgbe0jOg,1,0,4,448t9lFAaL46FqpDFoi8xw

While the sushi selection was good, and they also had nigiri, the fish wasn't very fresh, especially the tuna. The rolls tasted like ones that you can buy at Costco or smiths which is unfortunate. They also tended to put a lot of cream cheese in their some of their rolls. I did enjoy the salmon nigiri and eel nigiri. My bf ate about 4 plates of their crab legs. I was surprised that they had glass noodles and Kim chi, but both weren't very good. 

They also have a very small selection of desserts and I thought drinks would be included but soft drinks are $1.75 extra. The servers are really good at refilling your drinks.

Makino is a favorite of our local fams and it got some major props by my yelp buddies Sarah Marie D. & Henry C.  HAW-LLLA!!!  Only a short distance from The Las Vegas Strip, it's off Flamingo Rd.  Food 4 Less is the main player in the strip mall it holds court in.  Not much night lights  to help with the visuals, so just cruise to the north end and you'll find it.  The joint is PACKED with Asian folk of ALL ages, so MUST be bringin' it right to keep the masses happy.  Our attendants were pretty good at keeping the drinks full and limiting the plate piles.  So with unlimited access, we sampled a few things...

I'm definitely in agreement with the yelpers that say Makino food quality is a MAJOR step up from Todai, IF you have to compare it to something.  I've had many an Asian buffet in my journey, and this is the best BUFFET sushi quality so far, with an impressive selection.  The chicken, beef, and pork options were all tasty and tender.  The fresh seafood options (oysters, crab legs, fish & shrimp) were always well stocked.  The tempura options were all crunchy yummy.  You're offered a  dessert zone that is Asian influenced and all delicious.  You can also do the chocolate fountain thang and get your hearts content of 6 ice cream options.  YUMMY!!!

Oh man, we all left STUFFED!  I was one HAPPY Chubba Bubba fur sure :) Prices are VERY reasonable, especially for the quality of food that is prepared here.  This is easily something we would come back to, and could recommend to anyone looking for a Japanese buffet in Las Vegas.

I had all the shrimp tempura to myself and unlimited bowls of udon. The sushi was very fresh, and the crab legs were satisfying (not too salty). For dessert, I had tiramisu and strawberry mousse cake. They were cut into little pieces, and every little piece would melt in my mouth (That's what she said). But best of all, there weren't many people, and we had to come back! 

Makino WAS a hidden gem buried deep in the ocean. 
But of course, word gets out and eventually, there are other Makino locations across the valley. 

Up until today, I thought the food quality had retrogressed. But my family decided to dine here tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. The restaurant was very crowded, but the service was excellent. Our plates were always cleared, and our water glasses were never empty. But back to the food. The crab legs were a little bland, but they did the trick. Makino had huge oysters tonight, and I ate them with ponzu sauce. So delicious! They had a small selection of nigiri sushi but a lot of rolls instead. The spicy tuna rolls were excellent. For dessert, in addition to fruit and cakes, they also served crepes and ice cream. 

Makino, you did your job tonight! I might come back when I'm in town again.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,0,0,4,M6Oi7uRWPgZki-celUTl3w

Pricey, yes.  Worth it, very much so.  Freshness abounds, as do the varieties of rolls and, at dinner, a mound of gem-quality sashimi, including the best cuts of tuna and salmon, all for the eating.

There is already a line waiting at 11:30 a.m., when the doors open for lunch.  Seating is done with courtesy, alacrity and a smile.  Drink orders are taken and you are on your own.  The giant horseshoe-shaped sushi counter holds up to 30 varieties of cut rolls at any given time.  Tongs may be missing, and cooking staff are a little bit slow on the customer service aspect, but all is in harmony as diners choose what and how much they wish.

This is the big draw, sushi, fresh, sparkling, delicious.  So it baffles me why anyone would even consider sampling items from the Chinese hot bar.  I did, once, at the behest of a dining companion, and was completely dissatisfied.  For the money, and it is steep, especially at dinner, at $26.95 per person, I am indulging in the one thing that sets this place apart from all others:  Sushi.  Of course, I am not a snob, and I am open to other non-piscine ideas.  Such as desert.   

Imagine my awe when, during my first visit, I turned to my left and spy a real, live... chocolate fountain, replete with all proper goodies:  marshmallows, cake chunks, fruits...  Even as I am knee deep is raw fishies, that dark, sweet, unctuous liquid is never far from my mind.  

Service is competent, smiley-faced and fast-paced.  The Makino website is a classic testament to the ""I do not care what people think"" school of philosophy, as typos galore are the practice rather than the exception.

They have A LOT of sushi selections, so if you're really craving sushi, this is the place to go. They have the typical ones that you might order at another sushi restaurant, as well as custom rolls you can make and sashimi. The ratio of rice to fish also isn't that bad.

I mean you aren't paying 50/person for this buffet (dinner price was around $30/person) but still I was hoping for better quality. 

The hot food selection isn't bad. Decent selection of both veggies and meats. You get your seafood salads and ceviche, crab legs, grilled fish and your typical fried rice and fried noodles. They also have an area where you can order either ramen (soy sauce based or pork broth), or udon. You can also make your own miso soup, filling it with whatever you want. They have a separate sections for shrimp tempura, separate from the veggie tempuras. Because everyone lovees shrimp. 

Dessert was just okay. I was so looking forward to the chocolate fountain, but really all they have to dip is marshmellows. No strawberries or whatever. They do have some fruits available which were pineapple, grapes, cantaloupe, and honeydew. I mean I guess you can dip those in chocolate.

Started at the Flamingo location, later to the outlet mall and then to the recently opened one in Henderson, off Eastern. Sometimes pretty good and sadly more often pretty weak.

Here is a roll with the same fish with a avocado on the outside. What I am saying is that you basically get the same thing right next to each other, just presented in a different cover.

Yeah, you get filled up since it's all you can eat, but I must admit that I've never really said, ""WoW! thats a tasty roll!"".

They have a station where someone makes handmade rolls in front of you where you can pick what goes in it. After awhile though, the sushi starts tasting the same so try not to overload.

They have a ramen station where you can pick what kind of broth you want. It's really good. The broth was so good. I would recommend that.

this is significant because buffets rank up there pretty close to star wars territory from my vast buffet experience.

one thing that i like about makino is that they have a wide variety of sushi and some sashimi. i believe that i counted about 50 different rolls...and even though they are mostly variations of each other...i thought that it was sort of impressive.

My wife (who wasn't there because she was with my other daughter's team this evening), had raved about how great Makinos was, so I was looking forward to it.

I was impressed with the large variety of sushi, especially the maki sushi (cut rolls). I have never seen such a wide selection, and I understand the chefs will make you a handroll if you ask. However, I'm more of a fan of the basic nigiri sushi, so I piled my plate with pieces of yellowtail & salmon roe. With the exception of some of the weirder looking rolls, the quality seemed pretty decent, and maybe that was because it was a busy night (Saturday night with a lot of big groups in the house) so there was a lot of turnover on the food.

There's plenty of shellfish, from raw oysters to steamed clams to mussels. Lots of king crab legs, too (tip: if you don't want spray the people around you when you break the shells by hand, ask the waitress for some crab crackers and she'll bring a few to your table).

With so many raw foods to choose from, I skipped the hot ones (except for the steamed clams & mussels, which weren't all that great). Lots of desserts, but I was disappointed not to get any ice cream; the station wasn't manned for a long time and I finally gave up.

At $26 for dinner, price is a bit high, but it's sushi, shellfish & crab legs so it's understandable. One thing I really like, that all other buffets should emulate (listen up, Soup Plantation), is that they charge kids by height instead of age: dinner for rugrats under 4 feet is $6.99 and under 5 feet is $12.99 (and I think under age 3 or 4 is free).

But she disregarded what I said and kept going on about, ""Oh, well we start taking the food away at 9, so you will have to hurry."" What kind of customer service is that; telling your customers to hurry and eat? Hahah-- no. Whatever, so I ask her how much it was about 2 times, because she acted like she didn't hear me. And when she finally ""heard"" me, she says; ""Oh, for mother's day abou $30 something. Which might be too expensive for you two."" EXCUSE YOU.


LIVID, I turn over to a different person and asked what time their last call was. Ohhhp, girl.. Their last call is at 9:15. And they take away the food, of course, at 9:30. WHEN THEY CLOSE. And that last girl tried to save herself. ""Oh I didnt realize the time, you guys will still have time.""

A few months ago, my husband and I were craving crab legs and sushi badly. We didn't want to spend over $30 at M buffet for crab legs or go to an AYCE sushi place and not have crab legs. We were not willing to compromise on either, so on a whim, my husband suggested Makino.

We prepared ourselves for a mediocre meal, but to our surprise, Makino stepped up their game! The crab legs were amazing! They were juicy, fresh and had a hint of sweetness.  I loved their other seafood items such as their jumbo shrimp and poke. The sushi rolls are enormous. We always go right when they open so the fish has always been fresh since it hasn't been sitting out too long. The dessert is just okay to me... I love creme brulee but my favorite part is breaking the crispy sugar layer and it's never made correctly. 

I'm guessing they stepped up their game with the opening of The Boiling Crab in the same shopping center. I love TBC but sometimes I just want plain steamed crab legs for AYCE and not pay by the poundage.

If you are the mood for crab legs and sushi rolls and don't want to compromise, I suggest giving Makino a shot. After all these years, it still holds up!",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,1,0,4,bYzapTwvrDCfVu84JMrFXA

I then tried the oyster and mussels they were both delicious as well as the crab legs with a hot pot of butter right there ready for your taking but the crab legs do come cold just a quick note if you do prefer them warm at a buffet; these ones come on ice however they have the crab openers ready on your table. I also tried some sliced steak and ribs, the ribs tasted a little left out from lunch or reheated but the sliced steak was yummy. The fried rice was good the noodles right next to them weren't my taste but others might like it. Also the assortment of different salads was great nice and full of dressing.

I decided to go here for lunch on Saturday ($18.95). I was a little more in the mood for some regular Japanese food than sushi, but once we sat down to eat we realized we should've just gone to Umiya instead. 

Nothing really stands out anymore which makes me sad :[ On the hot side I had the fried noodles, beef sukiyaki, calamari, gyoza, green mussels and shrimp/vegetable tempura. All were ALRIGHT. A couple years back the sukiyaki would melt in your mouth, but now it was just okay. If I were to say something stood out, it would definitely be the calamari. If it was there the first round I went, I would've gotten half a plate's worth! What can I say? I love squid.

They have a decent variety for lunch, including ramen, an udon station and of course the whole sushi side. One half of it is rolls and the other is nigiri. The cuts of fish were nice and large on the nigiri, but the amount of rice matched it. So much that you couldn't really taste the fish... at all. Why would you eat sushi that you couldn't really taste?

Speaking of barely tasting something, I would save my money and just order water instead of iced green tea. At first I was convincing myself that the flavor wasn't that strong because of the food I was eating, but when my boyfriend tried it he pretty much said I paid $1.75 for green water, lol.

I know it's a buffet, but it's the same price as the AYCE sushi bars for lunch, so really, if you're craving sushi opt for Sakana (for nigiri), Goyemon (for rolls) or Umiya (for a ton of appetizers). There's nothing wrong with the service here. I would say they could space the tables out a little more so it felt less like ""community seating"". Luckily when we got there it was towards the late end of the lunch service so it was starting to empty out, but I've had experiences in the past where I was practically bumping elbows with strangers while eating. 

Honestly, I think I'm done with Makino for now, at least until I decide to give it my annual pilgrimage for old time's sake, haha.",QwF1v-bnTPECj2nYEQczBw,1,0,3,DtRqDShKK_6tBcoaaJd6Lw

We arrived at 12:30 on a Thursday, 1 hour after they open, and all the tables were full. We waited for about 10 minutes and got a spot. The place was packed!

The first thing I tried was the sushi. There are so many choices, and a lot of the rolls have a pretty generous portion of fish! The clear star of the sushi station is clearly the hand rolls! You can pick from a couple of types of fish and they'll make a fresh hand roll for you on the spot! All of the fish was really fresh and like I said, the portions were pretty generous! There are many different rolls, but a lot of them seemed to just be variations of each other, so maybe like 5-7 distinct types of rolls -- all very good!

Next is the hot entrees. There is a really unique ramen station where you can construct your own bowl of ramen! I didn't give it a try but it seemed pretty cool. They have a lot of options from teriyaki, fried rice, fish, and some veggie plates! All of the food was kept at a nice temperature, and pretty flavorful! I was impressed.

The dessert station was pretty disappointing, however. They have the typical Asian buffet cakes -- small little bites of cake -- but they were all pretty flavorless. I had the blueberry mousse and the flan and both were sort of rubbery and didn't taste very good. The cheesecake was pretty good though!

I just had to get that off of my chest since that experience has made me appreciate ALL other sushi buffets. 

The best time to come here is when it opens or else you'll be waiting for a while. There is a wide variety of sushi rolls and hot foods here. I was surprised to see that they also served spicy ramen! But you have to ask for it. I'm always on the look out for the salmon nigiris since those are usually the first to go then the tuna ones. You gotta be aggressive and grab the tongs first cuz once the chef refills that salmon and tuna, everyone be going apeshit. I remember this man just standing in front of all the nigiris until the chef put out more salmon (he was there for about 5 mins not budging). 

My favorite section is the dessert. But I was disappointed that they didn't serve the coconut pudding cups the other day. I was looking forward to that. I did get a chance to try the green tea cake ugh so good. Anything green tea is just yesss. 

I barely touch the hot food unless there's shrimp or tempura or calamari. One does not simply go to a sushi buffet spending plenty of money to eat hot food! I wanna get my money's worth of raw fish :)

I will always come back here. I'm not all crazy about quality. As long as it taste good and doesn't give me food poisoning then I don't have a problem. 

& remember you don't know terrible until you've tried Todai in San Diego. The Todai here is fucking bomb!",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,4,1,4,_CMDfB_ttW3UKD3cTRICQg

My visit was as pleasurable as possible!
This was my second visit within 3 months and it was soooooooooo busy! But the wait was worth of it.

PRICE: From my perspective it was a good price (28). I can easily estimate that all the varieties I have ate, in other places other than buffet it would be at least (50).

WAIT: My judgement is; they are doing very well, thats why everyone like their place. The place is not small, the occupancy capacity are 280ish, and thats a lot.

FOOD: The variety are huge, delicious, good quality, good size and fresh. For now one of the best sushi buffets I have visited in the last few years.

SERVICE: To see staff working so hard and fast to accommodate everyone, it was crazy! Sometimes when we wait a few minutes we tend to judge they are not doing their best for us, but trust me, yesterday I saw how hard and fast they were cleaning up the huge mess people leave on table to have everything ready for next hungry customer. I can only image the dishwasher crew. A++

PEOPLE: It is a buffet all you can eat, the food will not disappear,  they will always replace with fresh ones. It breaks my heart to see people behind their mountain food plate and wasting so much food. Tips: get one and if you like return to get more as many as you like and your belly can hold. (Not your eyes)

I Like it all!!!

Once we sat down they asked us if we would like something to drink. Unfortunately the drinks (soda beverages) are not included with the price. The real bummer here was that you can't change drink types i.e. You can't switch from Sprite to Coca-Cola without being charged and the server brings you the drink. Aside from those comments, the reason for removing another star is due to the fried rice having egg shells in it, and not just a few pieces.

The food was awesome. I thought this place was going to be similar to the Todai sushi buffet, but Makino was better hands down. The sushi tasted fresh. Comparable as if you were sitting at an actual sushi bar. The had a variety of rolls, although I was kind of bummed that they didn't have a crunchy roll, which is one of my favorites. Never the less, they did have a jalapeno, stuffed with cream cheese, tuna and melted cheese. It was so good. I woofed down about 5 of those. :) They snow crab legs. They were ok, not as gargantuan as the ones at the hotels, but enough to kill the craving. They also had fresh oysters. I'm not a fan but my wife says they were delicious. They also had yakitori sticks, teriyaki steaks, and a good variety of Japanese food. Fried rice was BOMB!

And for dessert, they had a chocolate fountain! Complete with strawberries, marshmellows, pineapple, and other fruits to dip it in. They had a variety fruits to dip. Ice cream was available for your sweet tooth as well as a variety of pastries. Another thing they have that I  thought was unique to a buffet was shaved ice. YUM!

3923433,2013-03-21,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"I went here for lunch with some co-workers and had mixed feelings.

Let's get this out of the way: I actually like the novelty of all-you-can-eat sushi buffets. I like seeing all the food and just picking out what I want. I appreciate being able to get in and out of these buffets way faster than the ""made-to-order"" places (and a positive side effect is that others will be faster too, so it's less likely you'll show up spontaneously one night and have to figure out Plan B because there's a 45-minute line out the door).

A big positive for Makino is the variety. There is a huge selection of hot food (including made-to-order ramen), 10 or so types of nigiri, assorted temaki, and 14+ different rolls - and that's at lunch. I like their desserts as well, which tend to be small bites with pleasant, subtle flavors.

Unfortunately, where Makino really suffers is the fish quality. The fish there is just mediocre. I would actually avoid the nigiri here except to fulfill a particular craving. The fish-to-rice ratio is not good anyway (not much rice, but very thin fish). Stick to the hot food and the maki. If your desire is to stuff your face with nigiri, I'd definitely go somewhere else.

Service was very good. Waitress managed to keep all our drinks topped up and was very friendly. Don't think my water ever got below half full, which is often a challenge at these types of busy restaurants.

Ultimately, I think Makino is one of those places where if you're into the positives they have to offer, you'll really like it. If you aren't, it's going to wind up a suspect value proposition.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,1,0,3,ZSy3xYQ2g3a7TkGdQ5GaLw

I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of sushi and sushi rolls they had. I love that orange pickled burdock root they use in a lot of their rolls.  They also has ramen and udon. They even had roast beef and BBQ ribs, which I thought were unnecessary and kind of out of place.

3943105,2018-04-29,1,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"Overall this was a very ""meh"" experience with only very few highlights.

Getting an unlimited sushi and seafood buffet for around $17 should be a flag that one should temper their expectations in terms of quality. 

The inside is extremely cramped and crowded.  It can be hard to move from your table to the buffet without bumping into other diners. There is a larger back dining room area as well, but they didn't seem to be using it very much.  A highlight was that the staff were very smiley and friendly and were frequently picking up used plates and refilling drinks.

They have a large selection of sushi rolls and sashimi as well as crab legs plus a variety of hot dishes, salads, and desserts.  The quality of the sushi and sashimi was fair but by no means impressive.  It definitely did not taste fresh, but it was OK for the price point.  In terms of hot dishes... the chicken teriyaki was dreadful.  I can't say if it was white meat or dark meat chicken as it was grey in color.  Yuck.  The tempura lacked the light, airiness that tempura should have and was instead heavy and oily.  The shrimp inside definitely seemed like frozen shrimp.  The fried rice was dry.  They will make udon for you; I didn't try that, though.  

They have some decent desserts including ice cream and small cakes.  The blueberry cake was surprisingly good.  The crème brulee was dreadful.  The top was not fully caramelized, and the inside was lumpy.  Yuck again.

If you temper your expectations in terms of quality and instead focus on the reasonable price you may find Makino to be an acceptable dining experience.",OIa6ptM1qUts5arovQUAFQ,5,2,2,oY1KFCOzcTa3WUW2ScgGcw
4014519,2013-09-03,4,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"It's about a 3 1/2 stars.

I don't know why I keep coming back to Makino since there are so many other all-you-can-eat sushi places in Las Vegas.  And according to many reviews, sushi places with a lot more high quality food.  Call it nostalgia from when I was a freshman at UNLV and eating here was a damn fine treat (it was one of the first buffets I had here in Las Vegas), the fact that I don't have to fuss with picking out sushi from a list (I just load my plate), or the knowing that Mr. Makino himself looks like a cartoon character out of a Cooking Mama game.  Him wielding those knives in both hands when he had his commercial back in the day was damn hilarious!  Makino!

Yeah, yeah, all you 'foodies' will knock me for liking a place like Makino's...fact is I don't care.  A lot of you so-called food hipsters like spending your money on the latest and absolute freshest in raw fish.  But do you know in Japan, many high-end sushi joints DON'T serve sushi right from the ocean?  Many sushi chefs say the flavor of many fish from the sea heightens AFTER it has sat for a little while (in proper condtions of course).  So put that in your food knowledge book.  Plus with me?  I enjoy no frills sometimes as long as I can gauge what I'll be expecting.  Morimoto?  A meal of a lifetime maybe someday I will get to experience.  7-11?  Damn well better know you may get SICK.  Makino?  A middle-of-the-field player with skills, not cream of the crop, but more than enough to get runs in.  A solid contributor.  

There are two Makino's, one on Decatur, and one in the Las Vegas Premium Outlets (which I reviewed a long time ago).  I prefer the Makino on Decatur since it's the 1st one in Las Vegas and I just think the food there is prepared a bit better.  Oh yeah, plus now they serve ramen!  Made to order.  And hey, who doesn't love that BIG @$$ octopus dangling from the ceiling asking you for some sashimi?  Nice touch.  

Yes, a lot of the rolls at Makino are sauce heavy, and many of them remind you of your typical 'California' roll.  Unfortunately this is for the less initiated sushi person, give them something familiar and they will probably try it.  But of course, in the front row of sushi you have some gems:

-Ahi
-Scallop
-Clam
-Salmon
-Mackeral
-Eel

And a few more choices depending on the catch Makino receives.  These are the more simple sushi, raw fish, rice, and maybe a touch of sauce or wasabi.  I eat quite a few of these.  I also like the California hand roll (much better than a regular one) as well as a spicy tuna roll.  I stress, you usually MUST ASK one of the sushi makers if you can have a hand roll.  Many times hand rolls won't be on the sushi line.  So ask the sushi maker nicely, and you should receive.  If you're getting a few hand rolls though, be nice and tip OK?  

Another reason I like Makino is because of the hot foods line.  Sometimes I really want more than just sushi.  WTH do they put in that damn fried rice of theirs??  It's damn near addicting.  I also love when they have sukiyaki out on the line.  Like crack in a bowl.  I love it so much!  Thin slices of fatty meat, green onions, tofu, all simmering in a sweet broth?  Bring it on!  I admit I have more than my share of the stuff from Makino.  I will take the noodle bowl from the udon bar and overstuff it with sukiyaki.  Damn fine eats especially on a winter day.  But I'll eat it in summer as well.  But only at Makino on Decatur will you be able to enjoy a steaming bowl of shoyu ramen or pork ramen.  This lately has been my kick at Makino.  Slurping up some noodles in some decent broth is heavenly.  It is a welcome addition.

Dessert at Makino?  Eh, needs some work I say.  It can be hit or miss.  I like the ice cream station, ending the meal with some green tea or red bean ice cream is good for the palette.  Chocolate fountain is ok when the pineapple is SWEET.  But those little dessert bites they have?  Some are good, some are not so good.  I like the tiramisu and the cookies & cream bites, but most of the desserts aren't very memorable.  No biggie though since I don't have the biggest sweet tooth.  

Price?  Not bad for a sushi buffet.  Around $18 per person for lunch (less for kids), and around $28 for dinner per person.  Dinner adds some extra hot entrees, plus crab legs, and oysters.  There's also some more expensive sushi items at dinner, like the popular uni (when available).  I dunno, but sea urchin still tastes like slimy salt to me.  

I've always had decent service at Makino, servers are unusually usually women but they are very courteous and very efficient.  No problems for me there.

Hit up Makino when you want some decent sushi, with no snobby service, but no high price either.  Go here when you can't make up your damn mind on what you want to order from those other all-you-can-eat sushi places before your hour is up.

4025654,2011-01-07,8,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"I'm probably biased with Makinos since that is like my favorite AYCE sushi joint there, but man I love this place...Anytime and every time I'm in Vegas, you know you can count on me visiting one of the Makino locations for sure!

For those of you who read my other Makino review (located in the heart of the LV Fashion Outlets), know that the variety of sushi at this place is just terrific!  If you were to compare Makinos to the likes of Todai, Onami, etc... I'm telling you Makino will blow it out of the water!  

So this Makino branch on Decatur'Flamingo is suppose to be the original Makinos that has set foot in Vegas.  For those who don't know, Mr. Makino was (I believe) the founder of Todai... then later when the quality was not up to par or as he has intended he decided to sell the chain and create Makino in Vegas instead to keep his sushi legacy going.

So let's get back on track to the sushi part of the story...  

What don't you want? What can't you get?  It's got everything here!  6 different types of California rolls, 10 types of fusion rolls, 10 types of nigiri, and a few other deep fried sushi for those of you who loves anything fried... the best part about Makinos?  The menu is not set and it changes daily... so let the imagination creation run wide my sushi chefs!  (numbers are approximations but it is quite vast for sure!)

I can't tell you which rolls are good but I'm a sucker for fusion sushi..  (I'm not all that into the good old traditional styles so you can definitely call me biased on that!)  So majority of them are all very tasty!  (I just skip those that has cream cheese in them because sushi don't taste right with cream cheese in my mind)  So try them all and let me know which is your favorite!  

Then for those who are not keen on sushi there's a lot more you can work with!  They've got cold salad selections (about 5 kinds), assorted hot foods for you to choose from ranging from teriyaki chicken, sukiyaki beef, deep fried tofu, steam fish, miso soup, beef ribs, gyoza, fried rice, yakisoba, steam veggies, udon noodle soup, clams, mussels, tempura veggies, and my favorite of them all, the tempura shrimp!  (These shrimps are so amazing! and it would be worth it already if you just sit there and down about 50 of them!!!  LOL!)

Lastly, let's not forget about the desserts!  A decent selection of baked goods are available but the one of the tastier selection is the almond jello!  So rich in almond flavor.. yum!  And of course we can't forget about the ice cream parlor!!!  Red Bean ice cream is the way to go here!  Just simply delicious if you have never tried red bean ice cream!  (They also have vanilla, chocolate, green tea, and occasionally, a couple other flavors such as strawberry or cookies n' cream)

So for those of you who are sushi specialists and not really caring much about how much it would cost to have 3 tiny plates of sushi presented in front of you, this is definitely not the place for you!  However, if you are down for a good, tasty, and fresh AYCE sushi that won't break your bank, Makino's is highly recommend.  It does take a little drive out of the strip but compared to the usual buffets in Vegas, this is definitely well worth the quick sight-seeing trip!",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,16,12,5,8CUfTLLMOqevyS5QKhRGKQ
4026835,2016-04-14,1,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"I don't know why my mom loves this place or why anyone loves it for that matter. My parents are huge AYCE fans and it's almost as if they think anything that's a buffet is good. So this is why we had family dinner here on 4/10/16. I've been here one other time 10 years ago and I didn't like it, hence not coming back until now. I give one star for dining experience/food and one more star for making Asian moms happy.

It's off-putting once you walk in the door because the crowd is totally rude. Hey, I know it's a buffet in a small space but you don't have to pin me against a wall to get a plate before I can. Jeez, they aren't going to run out of food!

Speaking of the food- it's not even good! Why are there so many cooked tuna sushi rolls? They are really gross. The raw sushi was chewy and did not seem fresh. So after I loaded up on sushi for my first plate, I decided to stick with crab legs after. Unfortunately I also did not enjoy the crab legs. The meat stuck to the shell on almost every crab leg I had. It's possible that they are overcooked. I also disliked the chicken skewers but the fried rice and chow mein were fine and consistent with what you'll find elsewhere. And then the dessert! What are they even serving here!? Some of the stuff was bizarre.. like coffee jello (with condensed milk on top?!) which was gross and then the weird, very soft cheesecake in a cupcake wrapper...

I don't know guys, I don't get it. You can get AYCE sushi at some amazing, fresh places in town for a few dollars cheaper. You can also get a huge buffet and endless crab legs at many casinos.

4043791,2014-05-18,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"I love this place. In terms of quality from what you would get from an all-you-can-eat location, it's pretty top notch. The fish cuts are always nice and thick, the fish-to-rice ratio is great (though sometimes certain kinds like scallop nigiri are heavy on the rise), and the fish itself is always fresh. If you're a salmon lover, you'll love it here, as they have nice, fatty salmon cuts that most places often don't (at least consistently). 

The rolls are tasty and varied, with your common ones like California and Philadelphia, and many other more unique ones. 

Their appetizers are always of great quality, and have a wide selection.

Two things that really make it for me here compared to other places:

Being a buffet, you can get more whenever you want. Many sushi places in town have very poor service, and will often either take a long time to get your orders to you, or completely forget some of items you. Definitely never a problem here. On top of that, the servers here are attentive with your drink orders so your cup will never go dry unless requested.

The other is that they have all-you-can-eat oysters, crab legs, and sashimi on their dinner menu. I'm not familiar with any other sushi place in town that offers this. Being able to stuff yourself with these for $30 is a pretty incredible value.

The only bad things about it are it gets VERY crowded during peak lunch and dinner hours, and that they close a little a little too early (9pm) compared to other restaurants. If there's a long wait for dinner (sometimes it's a half hour wait or more), depending on when you get there, you won't have much time to eat at your own pace.

Those things excluded, I definitely recommend it and consider it one of my favorite places.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,1,0,5,68PqHEPy15OBjfOG3RBCZQ

Makino isn't trying to wow you.  It's a sushi buffet and is clearly aimed at the tourist clientele who frequent the Las Vegas Premium Outlets.

First of all, this place is ALWAYS packed! So you're probably thinking, ""hey, this place mustn't be too bad then?"" Wrong. The tables are so close together, with some only being inches apart. This means in an already packed restaurant, you gotta worry about tiny spaces to pac-man your way through, as well as learning to cope with strangers getting into your personal space. One time, there was a man sitting at the table next to me who just stared at me dead on while I ate. And because our tables were practically connected, I could also hear him chew his food. *quivers*

As for the food, the sushi is really nothing special. The salmon sometimes taste like metal and the rice can be a little hard, almost crusty-like. Some of their other dishes are also pretty oily (i.e. the noodles). I think the only standouts are their mussels and self-serve soup. As for desserts, their cakes are quite dry and stale so I recommend just sticking to the chocolate fountain and fruit if I were you. 

Besides that, the service is always on point when I come here, always refilling our drink every 10 minutes and leaving lots of napkins at our table (i love it when they do that) .",2yPRCQMd2u0ka7r5IdITBQ,4,1,3,vCSFxxjfgqE1p5wfierFCw

Service - 5/5
Atmosphere - 2/5
Location - 4.5/5

Let me start off by saying, the quality of the fish here is the best I've seen on the West Coast; ESPECIALLY for a buffet. Usually when you hear the term 'raw fish buffet' it's something you want to stay away from, however, this is not the case at Makino. 

The location is very close to the strip, so it is easily uber-able (was less than $10 for us to uber from Circus Circus to here). The restaurant itself is clean, welcoming, and not terrible loud, however my one complaint about it is the seating arrangements as it's kind of awkward to get around tables, chairs, and the buffet area itself -- although this isn't a deal breaker, it would be nice to have a more open layout. 

The service was what really surprised me about this place. We were warmly welcomed at the front desk, weren't asked to pay up front (which honestly I don't mind, but I find even more respectful for a paying sit-down customer to pay after the meal). It is true buffet style, so you don't pay for non-alcoholic drinks or left-over food. The waitresses that assisted us were kind, respectful, friendly, and attentive. Very rare in Vegas to find waitresses that are friendly and not condescending or distant. 

At $30 per person, you really can't beat the price for what you get.

Overall, I will be returning, and even though this isn't one of the most fancy restaurants that you can go to sushi wise, the service alone was enough to make me recommend this place to anyone.",jytULgxk9gDRuZQy0AyusQ,1,1,4,bpNnifTYUJbbGwVE1uT74g

The first time we came here the nigri was good, salmon was definitely the freshest. Yesterday's nigri was better than the time before. I'm not a big fan of the rolls as it fills you up quickly and there's just too much sauce. However, Makino's does try to compensate for that by putting two of the same rolls out one with sauce and one without. I haven't tried anything there that was not sushi besides the udon. Dessert is ok, nothing too crazy....there is a chocolate fountain and shaved ice for those with a sweet tooth.

Cons: some of the fish sits out a little too long. The yellowtail was getting a little old. The snow crab appeared to be brined which I didn't like.

And we hadn't been there since, until a few sundays ago, to celebrate my sister's birthday (cinco de mayo- we work so we couldn't go out on monday).

I made a reservation for our large party- 14 of us (my mom, my siblings & their children, only one missing was my brother-in-law). Good thing, too, because when we went to the door, before it even opened (11:30 am), there were about 30 people standing to get inside. Busy lunch time crowd. The staff managed well. We were seated in the back part. We had a high chair, but our little one was sleeping. (We woke him after he had a nap so he could enjoy some fried rice and teriyaki chicken.)

Food was fresh (all the cooks were busy), there was a sushi station, salad section, hot foods section, (personalized section- you select the veggies) & a dessert section (ice cream is handled by the attendant). I liked the many different selections but I was trying to keep myself comfortable, so I was being picky, but I was satisfied. I wanted some Kale Salad, and then upon closer inspection, noticed that I got a lot of the thick stems (next time, I'm gonna be that annoying person that picks at it, avoiding the stems. For the most part, I ate what I selected, and I enjoyed my food. I also saved room for dessert. I got the green tea ice cream but it was a little off (then again, it almost always is, at these places, unless you go to a specialty ice cream place). 

My husband just thought it was OK, but thought it was a little high-priced, and actually likes Todai better (no doubt, the crab legs are quite tasty there). I remember my sister saying that our mom saying likes Krazy Buffet better (it's not quite the same buffet, but ok). Even so, she always has her plate piled way high. 

Service was very good- it's a team, here. Greetings once inside and upon exiting as well. Everything was clean and in order. Clean plates were replenished for the busy lunch time crowd. Dirty plates were promptly picked up, too. There is a ""wasted food""  charge, too; well, signs are posted, anyway. FYI, gift cards are sold here.

I was so excited to come here, I have yet to find a buffet I really like, but the reviews seemed great! The pictures lured me to this establishment, I was ready to experience gluteny at its finest. 

 So we park and the parking lot is packed which is not surprising on a Sunday at lunch time.  When we walk in it's a pretty cramped bustling atmosphere, and our table they walk us to is connected to another parties table. Slightly awkward, but I'm not hear for ambiance I'm here to eat!   My first plate I made for myself was ok, not amazing but not awful, the items on my plate were from the sushi bar directly next to hand rolls.  I also had some fried squid which was decent.  It all went downhill from there.  The nigiri was a hot mess! The rice was way to wet, and the fish on most rolls was not proportionality cut, and was done so very sloppy.  The long row of rolls all looked better than they tasted.  I spit out a lot of food.  Also I noticed the potential for so much cross contamination since there was not enough tongs per item.  Also for hand rolls only at dinner do the offer the irkura hand roll.

In the hot section other than the calamari I tried the beef with mushrooms and onions. Most of the beef was overcooked from sitting under the heat lamp, making it so tough.  The shrimp tempura was soggy, and the rest of the tempura was just a trough of sadness.  I tried the ramen, the guy putting together did it a bit sloppy, and was trying to hit on the woman behind me at the same time.  He was a multi tasker...The noodle was very thin I prefer it curly and thick, the meat was tender, the broth was better than the box kind, but still missing a soul.  The sukiyaki meat was actually very nice, the noodle overcooked.  No crab legs anywhere at lunch, which I can understand Its cheaper.

The dessert area was a joke, it tasted like a bunch of dollar store mixes thrown together rather than anything of quality or from scratch.  Lots of artificial flavors, and calories that were not worth it.  The flan was the only decent thing there.  I saw no creme brule, that must also be a dinner item.

All in all, I just don't get the appeal of this place, it cured me of ever hoping to find a buffet that is worth my money.  Food that sits out, starts to change in texture, and quality.

Their sushi is not -the- best, I admit, but it's not the worst either. I really like the variety in their buffet menu. Their salads and cold dishes is actually my favorite. I like getting a big pile of edamame to nibble on as my appetizer. I usually ignore half of the hot dishes since I can eat most of them at home (like fried rice and yakisoba) but I have tasted them and they are pretty good. I love that they added ramen as well. Their desserts are a hit or miss sometimes. My favorites throughout the years are the thin almond cookies and their creme brulee. There were times that they didn't have both which is why I deducted a star (lol) because some of their dessert items are a little mediocre, sorry. 

But of course they're known for their seafood and 90% of the time it's fresh and delicious. However, the 10% of the time, the crab legs were flavorless and thin and the oysters didn't taste fresh. Sushi and sashimi, in my opinion, have always tasted pretty good. The only thing that saddens me is that they stopped serving salmon sashimi slices :(

I remember the food being really good (hot and fresh) at the outlet location, everything was cold and soggy here. The fish/sushi was okay. We got in around 815 and asked if we were okay having only an hour to eat as they close at 930. We obliged and then started eating. About 915 they announced on the intercom that they were closing. 920 they interrupted our meal and asked that we start paying for the bill as they need to close down the register. It was rather annoying, but gave our CC and continued eating. Then at 925 they turned off majority of the lights and employees started leaving already?!? First of all, I have never been to a restaurant where they kick you out by close time. At most places, if you're in eating, they let you finish your meal, but just stop letting others in.

Pros:
I  can say with confidence that the quality and variety has remained very consistent over the years since my first visit.

There are so many items from which to choose that just about anyone should be pleased with the selection.
This is a Japanese restaurant, so the focus is on sushi and sashimi.
However, they regularly have several other raw and cooked seafood items, a few items from the grill, interesting salads, soups, etc.
The variety and quality of the desserts is above par compared to other sushi restaurants or Asian buffets we've tried.

Most of all, this is a very good deal for a Las Vegas buffet.
The best evidence for this is the line that begins to form outside the restaurant at least 20 minutes before they open for dinner, even on weeknights.
They've raised there price for dinner only a couple of dollars over the past 10 years. With drinks, tax, and tip our tab came to about $35 per person.

Cons:
Arriving at the restaurant even just 30 minutes after opening can result in a rather long wait for a table because the demand for the dinner buffet well exceeds their capacity to seat people.

The quality of the nigiri, maki, and sashimi is definitely good but not outstanding.
No real surprise, though, as this is, after all, sushi for the masses.

They used to have raw oysters on the line, which was one of the principal reasons why I became a fan of this restaurant. However, they have now been replaced with fried oysters, which were still a treat.

I went for lunch and there was no sashimi, which I'm not sure whether they offer it for dinner or not offer at all. I'm not a big fan of rice, so nigiri won't do me any good. Makino has tons of rolls, I mean tons. They offer so many kinds of rolls, occupy the whole section on the right hand side. Their rolls are good but the rice portion is too much for me.

Hot food and cooked food is average. They don't offer so many hot dishes and as of I'm writing this review a week after I left Vegas, I had no impression or memory about their cooked dishes. 

So overall, Makino has good price and good variety of sushi and roll. They pride for their hand roll made to order but again, too much rice and big roll for me. They are packed on lunch and I can't imagine how it will be for dinner.",2t1ZgduPJXzUg9o6Igx2LQ,3,0,4,72wG9zLxrDvueWnS-CB7Aw

The non-sushi food is pretty good as well. If you are a big fan of Japanese food, you will be satisfied, but if not, you should stay away. Their dessert selection is above average for a buffet. They had creme brule which was yummy, and they had real ice cream. None of that soft-serve stuff, but real hand-scooped ice cream in many different flavors. I tried the green tea ice cream and it was delicious!

The cost was around $25 for dinner. We went on a weekday, so it might be a few dollars more for the weekend/holidays.

I don't know, maybe Todai in the Bay Area is just really shitty, cause Todai isn't good at all around here. Anyhow, my friends and I wanted to go to Makino since we knew it was a sushi/Japanese buffet. Also, my boyfriend and I had tried Makino's in Honolulu and it wasn't that great, but his parents mentioned that the one in Vegas was a lot better.

First of all, I thought the quality of food was actually very good considering it is a buffet. Also, the restaurant was very clean while we were here and the service was also very attentive and friendly. We never had to ask for refills or for our plates to be taken away. 

Makino offers sushi, hot food (fried rice, grilled meats, tempura, fish, soup), a salad bar with like eight different types of salads, and then a dessert area. A lot of people seem to think the sushi quality isn't that great. Yeah, it's not GREAT sushi, but I think for a buffet, the quality is pretty high. And even though the rolls are kind of repetitive , they're all really big.  The salad bar has some really good salads - my favorite was the cucumber seaweed salad.  Then on to the hot food, tempura was good and they also had White Ba-Sa fish which was very tasty.

Last but not least, the dessert area has yummy desserts. they have fresh fruit, a chocolate fountain , crepes, ice cream, and different types of mini cakes/pastries.  OH, and they have AMAZING green tea ice cream. On top of that, my favorite was the creme brulee.

Bottom line.. I think people are reviewing this place kind of harshly. Come on, it is a buffet and you're only paying around $25.00. If the food here was at a restaurant and you paid a la carte for each item, then I would have given them a lower rating.

Las Vegas has many AYCE sushi places.  Not many are a buffet.  Most are around $25.  Las Vegas also has many AYCE buffets specializing in Asian food.  Not many are $25, but they don't offer the variety of sushi Makino does.  Not far from here are better options for both at a much better value.  

I have been on a quest to try Makino for a couple of months after hearing about it and checking out the website.  A sushi buffet sounded interesting and I had read good things.  Since I was on the west side of town near Makino, I finally had my chance today.  It was crowded so I took that as a good sign.  

After paying like $30 for lunch, I expected a lot, being I've been to several of the AYCE sushi places, at least 9 in the 4 months I've lived in Las Vegas.  

The desert section looked great, and then there was some standard Japanese fare, like tempura shrimp, and some chicken dishes with fried rice and noodles.  Then there was the sushi area.  It wasn't nearly as majestic as the videos on the website make it seem.  There were many varieties of sushi and fresh fish, but most were just bland instead of the flavorful varieties I've experienced at the other AYCE places.  Most didn't have any additional sauces with them to compliment the flavor. The desert section was pretty good.  

As I mentioned above, service was excellent, but I will not be back.  Life's too short for bland sushi for the price that's more than many better sushi places.",iN5505977Li8XYZ3FnzWJQ,0,0,2,597ZnWHm1U8brE5bLJg4uA

Why the 5 stars?  I've been to other sushi buffets such as Todai, Vegas Seafood Buffet (in Glendale, CA) & Zen Sushi, etc.  The price at Todai is outrageous in comparison!!  My BF loaded up on the sushi which they were not skimpy at all.  They had Red Snapper, Tuna, Salmon, Octopus, Mackerel and a few others.  There were also a handful of rolls.  

I noticed a variety of salads including seaweed salad.  

On the other side of the sushi counter, there was the cooked foods counter.  You can choose from shrimp tempura, mixed vegetables tempura, udon w/ soup, chow mein, steamed mussels, etc.

There is also a dessert station with a chocolate fountain.  

What it lacks in selection, the quality of the food makes up for it!  Would definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas!!",4YldPEIStr4VxO9iNuvtDg,0,0,5,TJ57JrJ62Q0oxI32gQOs8g

Sounds great considering whats on the menu, but none of the items seemed to tickle my taste buds. they were all decent, but nothing great. 

the service was nice. filled our drinks without us asking. there was a sign on the sushi window saying they charged 25 cents for all the uneaten rice from the sushi. but i dont think they really charge that. just to discourage people from eating sashimi without being full on rice. 

quality of the fish seemed a little old. felt like it was at room temperature which isnt a good thing. but none of us got sick.

Reminds me of the dolts that preach Buy American! but spends their money at Wal-Mart because it costs less (can't have your cake and eat it too, folks).

The tempura was fresh and the batter was light. If you're looking for sweet potatoes (my favorite deep fried and battered veggie), there's a white yam option.

I tried a bit of yakisoba and a bit of beef teriyaki. Both of those were also fine.

Red bean ice cream is among my favorite desserts, and theirs is quite fine.

Buffet line is pretty decent, a lot of random sea food choices. If you are planning to bring someone that has never ate raw fish or sushi this wouldn't be an example for a perfect sushi. Rice for the nigiri falls off which should be sticky, I had other better sushis.

I've been here a couple of times now, and the interior is always clean but it never gets too busy. Good place for a large group.

Buffet sushi is also usually not the freshest, and there was no exception here. The sashimi cuts in particular were kind of gross-looking. The crab legs and oysters also weren't that fresh.

On the plus side, there were many types of nigiri, and even more types of rolls (though most of them were modifications of the basic variations). There's also a whole side with plenty of hot foods, salads, and soups. 

The dessert section is particularly impressive, with a chocolate fountain!

It's basically a better version of Todai but also more expensive - I don't really think it's worth the price, especially considering there are so many buffet options in Vegas.

Not a single roll was good. 

The rice was dry.  The flavors within each roll clashed.  The asparagus was undercooked.  The cucumber was hard as though it wasn't ripe for eating.  The sauces were flavorless.  The presentation of the rolls looked as though a bunch of random ingredients were mixed together.  The fish was the only thing on each roll worth eating. 

Even the sashimi was bad: octopus sliced so thick it was an unpleasant chore to eat it.  

Service, fantastic; dessert, good; ambiance, fine -- but nothing can make up for the fact that this is a somewhat spendy sushi buffet and the sushi was horrible.  I wasn't even there on an off night; it was Saturday at 6pm.  

Any other buffet in town that has sushi as a side-station would have been better than this place.  And I could have gotten three great, fresh rolls at any other sushi place in town for what I paid to have an awful, dry, mishmash of garbage at this place.

5022999,2011-11-24,1,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"Makino's claim to fame is its AYCE sushi lunch and dinner buffets.  Prices for lunch and dinner vary depending on the day of the week (Mon-Thurs:  $15.95 lunch/$24.95 dinner; Fri, Sat, Sun, Holidays:  $16.95 lunch/$25.95 dinner).  The buffet line offers a wide variety of nigiri and rolls; however, it also has a tempting array of salads, hot dishes like tempura shrimp and vegetables, miso soup and udon, and desserts.  Makino does have its flaws.  The sushi rice is not nearly prepared to the exacting standards of better/higher end sushi restaurants.  Construction of its nigiri and rolls is impacted by a seeming lack of the appropriate amount of moisture and stickiness of the rice, which has a tendency to be a bit crumbly.  Also, hot foods, depending on turnover, get overcooked, tough, or soggy, in the case of the tempura-fried vegetables, due to spending too much time in steam trays on the hot line.  However, these shortcomings are more than offset by the Makino's sushi variety and its generous cuts of better than average quality fresh fish and other seafood.  Really, who eats sushi for the rice?   

I love sushi.  While I wouldn't want to eat it every day, I definitely enjoy getting my feed on for the stuff...almost to the point of discomfort.  That said, I don't just eat any sushi.  I do have some standards for quality and selection.  Therefore, Makino on Decatur has been my go-to stop for decent quality sushi at a very fair price.

Granted, I still -don't- like Asian buffets overall. But, I would have to say that Makino is probably the prized gem of all Oriental Buffets in Las Vegas--at the same time, the experience and food that I encountered was average.

Ambiance: 3 - For an oriental buffet, most of which are small..Makino presents a pretty large and spacious serving area and seating space. Though, the seats can get a bit overcrowded and it can be hard walking through aisles when the place is full! 

Inside, it's pretty casual--I mean, it is a buffet after all! 

Service: 4 - The service received was quick and responsive. Our server was attentive and patient with my (rather rowdy) family hah! She was always there to take away our plates and bring us more water. Our table was always pretty clean! She deserves a gold star!! 

Food: 3 - The only food thats worth eating at Makino is clearly the seafood. Though, it might not be the best, if you're there it's still pretty good! For the sushi, obviously, there are way better, fresher places for the fish. I personally do not recommend it, but a few rolls are worth a try if you happen to find yourself at Makino! 

What I do recommend eating is crab legs and oysters (raw). Naturally, this is what everyone is here for!! And they don't disappoint--especially with their (what I consider) ""king-sized"" cups of butter for crab dipping! I was just there for crab legs and oysters. Hell, I was good for the night because that's all I needed! 

//Note: the crab legs were served warm when I was there! 

Another thing that was pretty nice was their desserts! I'm in love with desserts and found it cute and party-like that they had a chocolate fountain and fresh strawberries, along with their selections of cake and ice cream. Yeah, I found the diversity of dessert nice, but it still tasted average :/ maybe next time it'll be better!

The crab legs were my favorite item since I don't get an opportunity to feast on them often. My guess is the crab legs are prepared by boiling them.  The boil is aggresively brined and I would have eaten more crab legs but they were way too salty. I liken it to the movie theater that oversalts their popcorn so you eat less and drink more. Despite the imbalance, I would return tomorrow to have them again if I had time. 

Overall, I agree with the majority of yelpers and the 4 star rating. There is something for everyone here.  I would return and I recommend this restaurant to others.",BdXnVL0_4titKGFjF9j-jQ,0,0,4,FOvQDAoB-JqdVisV5eDuSQ
5290735,2008-07-24,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"For some reason or another, a trip to Makino everytime I'm in Vegas to see the folks has unknowingly become a Chang family tradition. Sure that didn't occur without some major arm twisting, since the place is not cheap, but somehow every holiday break, we find ourselves cruising along Decatur, ready for some fish.

About the food, to be completely frank I never know how to judge buffets. Let's see... Price? As stated, the place isn't cheap but lunch is pretty affordable ($15) with pretty much the same selection as dinner ($25) except with crab legs and some more seafood stuffs.  Food? If Japanese food means chicken teriyaki and sushi, then you have Japanese food coming out the woodworks. They have different combinations of sushi, from spicy tuna inside, unagi outside, unagi inside, spicy tuna outside, california roll with spicy tuna outside, etc. you get the point: limited fillings but done in different combinations for your pleasure. Selection is pretty vast so whether you're hankering for greens, fish, desserts, noodles, poultry, red meat, soup, or otherwise, you'll probably find it here, done with an East Asian flair. 

Freshness? Dinner seems more and more a rip since some items seem to be left over from lunch, but their King Crab Legs are super fresh and my mom always makes sure we get our $25 a head's worth in lump crab meat. For the record, I hate dissecting crab legs, I never had the talent for such a task. But the legs here are surprisingly easy to break apart, if that's any consolation. The sushi is usually pretty fresh, but like I said, sometimes you can tell the stuff was left over from lunch and the sashimi gets a bit dried out. Not a big deal, I haven't gotten sick off this place (yet). 

Service? The wait staff seats you and takes your empty plates away. They fill drinks and don't talk to you. Nothing spectacular. Trying to get ice cream from the staff behind the dessert counter seems a bit more arduous, but come on, it's ice cream, you can work for it. Prices are the same on holidays and weekends as weekdays (lunch $15, dinner $25) so don't hesitate to stop by on a weekend when the turnover is higher. 

Overall, I find it a better value than buffets a mile down on the strip, so if you're hankering for uncontrolled access to calories, try driving those couple extra blocks away from Las Vegas Blvd.",DkLLl9Lu1bU1CF4y6QYyVQ,1,1,4,dwGxVIjcbb8co-61kCkghg

5316050,2012-02-25,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"When I first discovered sushi 5 years ago I thought this place was amazing. After broadening my horizons and trying places like Yama Sushi, my perception of this place became a little more grounded in reality. The sushi wasn't great but what could you expect from a 15 dollar buffet style sushi place? At least it had its place.

Last night I went back with a friend for old times sake and realized how far downhill this place had gone. It was the first time I've ever been flat out disgusted by the poor quality of the sushi. Every piece I got was rubbery with a sickening smell of fish hanging around it. After the miserable failure I endured with the sushi on the first plate, I decided to stick to the cooked items. They had gone downhill too: just the same lukewarm mediocre tripe you can get from any 10 dollar chinese buffet. Even the desert plate managed to be a disappointment with the ice cream heavily freezer burned. 
Near the end of my meal I thought at least the blow wouldn't be as hard as if I went to a bad sushi place: there was that 15 dollar price tag, much cheaper then a sushi bar. And that's when the final insult of the night came: the price for this garbage had increased to 25 dollars a diner so I could have just as easily gone to a great sushi bar, loved my food and gone home satisfied. Instead, I left feeling sick and vaguely like I had been robbed.

Don't go to this place people, there are better options. If you want sushi, go to Yama Sushi, Sushi Bomb, Sushi Twister, Sushi Kai or Sushi Mon. All are good and except for Twister and Bomb they're cheaper then Makino too. If you're less of a sushi fan but still want an asian buffet, do Buffet@Asia on Sahara and Rainbow. It has a small sushi section, the cooked food is better and its under 20 bucks for dinner. If not that then go for any other asian buffet and get the same quality of food for half the price.",E4iotT-WNcYMGya62V5uTg,1,0,1,fRVyacpdiPySsw_4_FjQmQ

The tonkatsu Ramen was pretty decent though, had a couple bowls with the wife and kid.

1 - The steamed white rice is hard to find it's tucked away behind the desserts close to the restrooms so you will get a smell of the bathrooms before you eat

2- My first time coming here was a holiday specifically Mother's Day they had Lobster I assume they always had Lobster nope only on some holidays ( they didn't have it on Easter) and it's only half a lobster and you only get one which is through a ticket system 

3- I'm a big cheesecake fanatic I have noticed the recipe has changed. Their new recipe has Shortcake crust which is not as good. 

4- The woman behind the ice cream counter seem to be having a rough day and was taking it out on us the customers sometimes she'll give you two flavors if you ask (they come in small plastic cups) we saw another person did not get two cups when they asked politely. So she was very picky on who gets what and how many types of ice.

Now for the good...

Their clams are excellent they're in a soup broth and unlimited amounts of the sushi selection is fantastic! Always a good amount of crab legs, the claws are pre-cut for easy opening and they provide the aluminum silver crackers too. 

If you're not into seafood there is a large selection of meats such as short rib BBQ, baby back ribs, and chicken skewers

There's a miso soup machine! Fresh Udon too!

Fair selection of deserts and a chocolate fondue fountain.

Huge line outside when they open at 5:30 p.m. however the small restaurant does a great job of squeezing everybody in with enough tables for everyone and short wait time. I would also give this place five stars if they increased their hours and was open longer for their lunch/dinner times.

Family of 4 and one kid (who was under 4ft and if over 5ft pays a slightly higher rate) cost $180.00 dinner rate without tip. If you have a party of over 8 people you should make a reservation. No Reservations are needed if less than that.

All you can eat sushi including hot food, salads, soups, desserts, etc...the sushi always seemed to be the best value you'd get for the price.

We have been to the Decatur location a few times now and each time it has been such a party to get into. I find this place a little too fitted. Not as spacious and when it is busy, it's like a circuit to walk through. I started to feel the decline in their sushi, especially, at the outlet location before they closed...but after frequenting this location...I really really am feeling it. You can see the age in the sushi as it sits, rice has been a bit old, and I can't stand the cross contamination. You know when one tong has been used for different sushis. Which may not be a big deal...but when someone is using one tong for one sushi then the same one for another...people with allergies could suffer from this easily from those who aren't conscious to such things. 

While I do know that the price you pay for the options you get isn't so bad...because I've seen this place years ago, and with all the ayces out there...this place wouldn't be it for us/me. I'd rather pay about the same price for a place that specializes specifically on sushi rather than one that tries to carer to everyone's preference...because quite frankly, there are those who want sushi and then another person in their party doesnt. I feel like this place works best for such situation. 

On that note, despite what I feel...I'd recommend them if whatever I typed makes sense to you. They had a working high chair when I was there but please leave the stroller in the trunk because it gets crazy busy in there and space gets limited.

Don't get me wrong though..I'll still eat these rolls if they're there.  I just think there are better choices out there for sushi buffets like Sushi Hana or even Sushi Factory.

BTW...Penn from Rio's ""Penn and Teller"" dines here for lunch quite often.  I've seen him there at least 4 times and I don't here that often for my takeout box.  You can't miss him.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,14,7,3,3ie4RuDMary-DfD9hIMYxg

That said, this may be the best All you can eat oriental buffet I have been to.  It has a great layout, plenty of creative sushi dishes, and they really take pride in their freshness and cleanliness.  The tuna was perfectly fresh and the calamari was excellent.  Their hot dishes were good too.  They even had a chocolate fountain for the sweet tooth.  The good thing about these places is you can try many different kinds of sushi instead of being limited to 4-8 pieces of each.  The trade-off is you don't get as many special roll choices and you can't ask them to make one just for you.  Still, it was a pleasant surprise and my wife is awesome for finding it!

Update. I downgraded this to 3 stars.  The last time we went was not so good. The sushi was messy, and the hot food was not refreshed quickly.  It was busier than the last time and maybe they had trouble keeping up.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,3,2,3,leprWdl-Bibhz24IvDLUeA

For a supposedly sushi- and sashimi- oriented place, the sushi and sashimi is about the same or worse as I can buy in a good Japanese supermarket.

As for the hot food, some of it wasn't very hot at all. I picked up some fried oysters that had just been put out and nearly gagged when I ate it, because it was at room temperature and just a soggy piece of grease.

The tempura shrimp is always good though, and the crab legs as well.

Now my biggest gripe - the green tea ice cream. Yes it's good, the problem is I've been here four times and they've run out twice. I'm also pretty sure they either intentionally don't bring out more from the back or intentionally don't order enough to satisfy demand.

5651066,2014-07-05,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"My family and I used to frequent the Makino in the Premium Outlet Mall on Charleston a looong time ago. We stopped going mainly because it was just too expensive. Recently, my dad decided to give this place a try and we fell in love with it all over again.

Don't come in here with great expectations because I guarantee you that it will lead to just disappointment. Come to Makino without any expectations at all just like I did, haha!

The overall restaurant is kind of cramped. It's smaller compared to the one that they had at Premium. So that was a big thumbs down for me.

Service: They're okay. Some of the servers have a resting b!tch face. They just come to refill your drinks and take your food away. I'm probably really picky, but I like having servers who'll actually say ""excuse me"" while taking your food or I don't know.. People who'll actually smile?  

Food: There's a lot to choose from here. They have a lot of different kind of rolls and nigiri. If you come for dinner, they serve oysters, crab legs, amaebi (sweet shrimp) nigiri, and sashimi! They also have shrimp tempura, udon, seaweed salad, etc. I personally love the food selections here because they don't have a limit to amaebi nigiri. You can have as much as you want. And you can't find unlimited sashimi at an AYCE sushi restaurant. 

Price: Their dinner price here is comparable to AYCE sushi places in town (around $27). 

Personally, I find it worth every penny. You don't have to wait for the server to take your order, and you don't have to wait for your sushi rolls to come to your table. You can just get up and take ONE piece of roll that looks appetizing before getting more pieces. No more ordering half rolls or full rolls.

Went here on 07/31/14 with Brian P. and his coworker. I left in probably the most painful food coma of my life. Why? Ceviche! It was absolutely delicious! I had to have multiple servings it was so tasty.

Personally, I much prefer this buffet style to regular AYCE places because I like to try a single piece of a lot of stuff, rather than a whole roll. I tried a piece that was just a tentacle of something on a square of rice. No idea what animal  the tentacle orignated from, but it was okay. No real flavor, and luckily not the texture I had imagined.

I tried a hand roll for the first time, it was heavy on the rice and the raw enoki mushrooms were strangely overpowering. Luckily, unlike AYCE places, as long as you're not visibly wasting vast quantities of food, peeling off some rice or leaving some things you don't like on your plate won't result in an extra charge on your bill.

I enjoyed pretty much everything I tried - which was like three plates worth of food. Desserts were really good and I especially like the coffee jello and what tasted like huapia.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,1,4,DmxrryndKSyNQxEkUHlC0Q

The first time I came here, I honestly had NO idea what Makino's was. The only buffets I have ever been to are usually the ones that serve a while assortment of food, but this primarily focuses on Japanese food. So you can only imagine my excitement when I first walked in and saw the incredible display of sushi, especially my favorite: salmon nigiri. If you go at dinner, you can catch their crab legs, however, the quality of them is mediocre at best.

Besides sushi, Makino's has yakisoba, chicken teriyaki, ramen, miso soup, salad, mussels, shrimp tempura and more. Their dessert selection is okay. They do have a chocolate fondue foundation, so if chocolate is your thing then knock yourself out. Their cream puffs are okay, but I feel like they could be a TAD bit sweeter. That's a lot for me to say because I don't really like sweets that much. I do love their green tea ice cream. I feel like you can't go wrong with green tea ice cream.

All in all, I'm not that big a fan on buffets anymore. However, if I am being treated out or treating someone else out that loves buffets. This is by far the cheapest (yet better quality) option even if you go for their dinner menu because you get crab legs.

This is the least expensive meal that I've had while in Vegas and probably my favorite.,",nfcBvVbzRqVU_qoq423gtg,0,0,5,q2rocyDIuvVFmgau6Bdm-g

This place has lots of tuna and salmon. The variety isn't Golden Corral, but its unique in that it's a sushi buffet, as opposed to an All You Can Eat Sushi Restaurant. There are a number of different rolls and some sashimi (shrimp, eel, salmon, tuna). But the rolls aren't particularly appetizing, it's more like a one and done. I didn't feel like eating a roll twice. I didn't see any baked rolls either. For this price, I can't really complain. Tip: If you wanna eat just the tuna or salmon, get the poke. It's more flavorful. 

The other food is surprisingly appetizing. The snow crab legs and pork ribs are good. They have green tea and strawberry ice cream. I'd recommend avoiding the green tea and snow cones, since they give you an entire bowl of ice for the snow cone. 

It sounds like I'm hating on this place a lot, but $20 for infinite crab legs is worth it by itself. The sushi and desserts are just icing on the cake.",wc7FwvCb3H8L8l3DugbZ7w,2,1,5,jsJn6uLqFAd2OTO1_d23vg
5861093,2018-05-04,0,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"For a buffet, it was pretty good. I can taste how fresh their food is and see employees make some of it fresh to order. For $28.95/adult on a Thursday night, I think that's a good deal given that it is mainly seafood and it's all-you-can-eat. There are only very few items that I disliked. I would come again and I recommend it.

PROS:
+ Sushi (""above average"" to ""good"")
+ Other Seafood, like Shrimp Tempura and Prawns
+ Dessert is bomb, especially the green tea ice cream
+ Free parking in the plaza
+ Friendly service & Attentive 

CONS:
× May have a higher risk of cross-contamination because they leave out the tongs for 1-3 different food items 
× Seating is kinda terrible, but it is a buffet. The tables are cramped together, so people sitting with their chairs out doesn't help. You're bound to run into a couple of people.",7QGp3TfX0TpsmJHMMu-n4A,1,0,4,P3fcLq3nZznyFy5aNKQYNg
5865168,2017-08-01,1,XgsIf7s2zM-cC29WUD-NZQ,"To be honest, if I could give this place less than one star, I totally would. When we walked in, the wait was snaked all the way from the front desk to the restroom. Normally, you'd put your name in and wait until your name is called; however, this place gives you numbers instead. Therefore, people were standing in line aimlessly. We waited for about an hour or so and then we were finally seated.

The food is sub-par with not that much variety. It looked like it had been sitting on the plate for a long time. Throughout my time at the restaurant, I only saw one plate being changed at the sushi buffet. The non-sushi food was also pretty bad. The crowding in the restaurant only added to the negatives. 

ALSO there was a dead fly on my green tea ice cream. I REPEAT THERE WAS A FLY IN MY ICE CREAM. EW. 

TL/DR: not worth the price, bugs in restaurant, too crowded, don't do.",t8Wd3y8VeEzww0nuJ0hhSw,7,0,1,sLkGZe0WP4DQu-1Zv5VxLg

However, what they lacked for in selection, they made up for in terms of service. Generally with buffet style establishments, you never see your server other then for a bill or the original drink order. The staff here though are on top of it all. Drinks were promptly refilled and plates cleared after every time we got up. 

While I usually stay away from sushi at these kinds of places, I do trust it during lunch time when it's really busy and they turn it over quite a bit and when they first open as its fresh. Many of the usual standby were still present but I did miss the tempura selection the other location used to offer. Overall though, still a solid place.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,3,1,4,xDKb7o2vhaqpDDkK9Qeuxw

1. Located in a very busy strip mall on Decatur and Flamingo! You might have to park a bit far from this one.

2. You can request hand rolls made to order from the sushi chefs!

3. You can request your ramen spicy!

As promised, this is part of my post-Vegas binge series of reviews. It's a shame that I haven't ever reviewed this place considering that it has been an old favorite of my family for quite a few years now. Since the first time that I was wowed by this place, not a lot has really changed except for my own personal tastes.

The service here is fast, friendly, and efficient. Normally, my family comes very early so there is little to no wait time between getting in and being seated. However, I have noticed that if you are more towards the prime time of dining, you should expect to wait quite awhile to get in.

As for the rest of the staff, I haven't really had many problems either with the waiters and waitresses or the sushi chefs and other cooks. Most requests are met with certainty and the waitress comes often enough that the tables are pretty clean and never really full of dishes.

The food is divided into hot food and sushi. We were just in for dinner last month, so this is a review for the dinner sushi. For dinner, they offer nigiri as well as cuts of sashimi. We noticed that there is quite a bit of rice stuffed under the fish, but at least the raw cuts were nice and fresh. By far a favorite of mine is the salmon skin nigiri and accompanying rolls. 

As you make your way around the sushi area, you'll notice that they have many various types of rolls. I tried most of them except for the deep fried ones because they seemed to be a heart attack waiting to happen. Anyways, the rolls are what are considered common: rice, vegetables, and questionable types of fish covered in some thick sauce. Overall the rolls were fine, though filled a bit with too much rice.

One of the things I always enjoy are their handrolls. They premake the handrolls and leave them out for you to grab on your own; however, if you have a special request for a different type of fish, you can always ask them to make you a custom hand roll.

For the hot food, there are the various normal types of things you would see at a Japanese buffet such as chicken teriyaki, fried rice, calamari, salt-pepper shrimp and the like. They also put out shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, and a delightful ramen station that is made to order. I suggest trying the spicy tonkatsu ramen! They also serve udon around the corner as well as Korean-style galbi short ribs.

For dessert, there is a pretty big selection of cakes, ice cream, frozen yogurt, as well as a chocolate fountain. When we went, however, the chocolate fountain looked like it wasn't as smooth as other places. In fact, after making a chocolate fountain at home, I've sworn off of using them. This is because of the massive amount of oil that goes into making the chocolate run smoothly. I wasn't really impressed with their desserts because the cakes, pastries, and cookies were all run of the mill offerings that you would expect at any Chinese/Japanese buffet.

Overall, this is still one of our favorite spots to stop at because the food is affordable and not insanely priced like most of the rest of the strip. I hope you have a chance to check out Makinos soon!",Ao2X4BBYO8ibQE8_5Me6_g,6,0,4,FdAHIyaHVKeDx35fwC7hmg

For the amount of sushi variety you get at this buffet, its an extremely great value. $22 for dinner, 15 for lunch I think.
The sushi may not be the best cuts, but they are fresh and tasty.

Why do that when it's the middle of your busiest time? But the food was just so good, I'm giving them extra stars for that so that's why 4 stars.

I like the idea that it's a sushi buffet, an Asian buffet all in one. I went on a Sunday night, it was quite busy but I digress to say that most of their food were salty and I didn't enjoy myself.. I'm my opinion I think that Makinos is overpriced opposed to the quality of their food, my daughter is 2 and never touched her food but unfortunately because of her height (she's a tall girl, her father is a tall man) I had to pay for her.

I've been to this location 3 different times and unfortunately all experiences were unsatisfactory.

However, the the Las Vegas Outlet location was pretty tasty. I think it's a hit or miss.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,7,2,3,Esg3NdcEDpxN006RGdcoRA
