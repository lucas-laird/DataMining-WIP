The owner Joe, is from Chicago and and has that 'down to earth' attitude that they are famous for.  If your a little insecure or a pretentious type, the personality can be a little in your face (but hell why you getting hot dogs then?) - For me that is what made the first location so great - you try to be a wiseguy and you get schooled in how to do it.  

The location is just next to Starbucks and across the road from 24 Hour Fitness on Maryland.  Very nice and clean inside, with plenty of tables and chairs.  I asked what was the protein content of the dogs since I was after a meal after a workout and was told ""hey Chicago dogs are all meat, the best you can get' and called a name I am sure in the Chicago tradition was a term of endearment.

Very reasonable prices and the food tastes great, but for me as a visitor from overseas the best part is the attitude which is right out of a mob movie.  Some might find this a little too much but a place that has good food, at good prices AND a personality is worth the trip across town to expereince",ptgBEMXZLVFLpx9dm9s9Kw,1,0,5,Ir-Bq1_sPn7Gw6yULoeF6Q

Too bad this location is closed. They still have the hut over on Lake Near though.",t46PsLNgCEDs0Nqxw8oCAw,1,1,5,mem8UVjmIzzusau0BV5IbQ

Sure, the food is technically the same - it's one of the best Chicago dogs in Vegas. But this immaculate strip mall location lacks the charm of the little Lake Mead Pkwy hut.

There's just something about ordering your hot dog at a walk-up window and eating it outside that adds to the flavor and overall experience.

The staff at this location, though, are just a nice as the Lake Mead one. They've truly gone above and beyond each time I've eaten here.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,1,1,3,eBOTq72gCZlf5Al-4NHsqg

I dont know what.happened to this place but.only one month after they opened, there was an eviction notice on the door.",xYuJAH8j6ExWEyP00819SA,1,1,1,vD8K3guhYq6rOVBTcWxq9Q

The sodas in the fountain were flat and when I told the guy at the counter he mumbled something about ""I'll call them about it"" Wasnt overly impressed. Will try again maybe they were just having a bad day

OK so I went by there yesterday and there was a lock and a 5 day pay rent or vacate notice. I guess their customer service got to them",rvq5rl5TVabnR3D9gudfcA,2,1,2,UCC3oWdKzQtwpBLjyfME7A

I can't leave without leaving atleast a few dollars in their tip jar.

5600922,2010-12-12,0,1tJdRIuyH9UY_35yfn_uyg,As a frequent visitor to the Lake Mead Pkwy hut I was excited that they had finally opened another location.  I arrived at 3:40pm yesterday and found new winter hours on door stating they close at 4pm.  I knocked on the window and the guy counting his drawer wouldnt look up to acknowledge me.  Why close early?  It isnt going to do anything but piss people off and you need to sell every hotdog you can to meet expenses.  I bet they close this location not sure why they dont open other huts with less overhead?  Based upon this experience and other reviews; I will just make the trip to the hut.,cAY_gYiIq68RkWhLennaKw,2,1,1,vM03N7-4ZGp0R3tckBgUIA
