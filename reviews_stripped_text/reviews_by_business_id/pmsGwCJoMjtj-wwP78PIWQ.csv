Pizza look so delicious until we took a bit and the dough was not fully cooked! Like if it was rushed to me . So then I called them back and he said that they were busy and short someone for the night. Overall I'm not ordering pizza from there again.  I was hoping to find a pizzeria by my house so we can be locals There. Unfortunately that didn't happen.,uDY8SVhId5ccLNtmHzz1TA,0,0,3,TVyN0RBwO58wrFBsPaTG-Q

The dough is passable, but was that strange white substance on top actually mozzarella?  Looked more like Elmer's Glue.  And that sauce, ugh.  If this is the pie that Tropicana Pizza has always served, no wonder this is the last location left.

I was surprised the chicken was breaded but it made a world of difference in texture which I was happy about. The pizza was loaded with cheese which is another plus. It is a little gem so don't expect it to be as ""fancy"" as Domino's or pizza hut. But do expect Tropicana Pizza to taste better and be cheaper.",Wu5W5iu_LwptOvE9-pn0JA,1,1,5,dnIAsoIR3CilsJCn0yT7EQ

The chicken strips are good and reasonably priced. 

You can also choose what kind of wings and chicken strips you want. They all come with fries unless you get an A la carta or something. They do charge extra for the ranch but you get a big cup of it though, so it's worth the 50 cent. They stay open late as well.",hokUZTuNlA1y6YNHwJqp3g,0,0,4,maoXsfkou8m97DdjunitsA

Usually the people who answered the phone were friendly and helpful. Though I ordered tonight, and some older guy answered. I could tell it was busy and he was rushing, but he was very curt and short while trying to place the order, he rushed every aspect like I couldn't talk fast enough for him. He didn't even give me my total before he said good bye and moved on to the next call. Then when the order arrived, it wasn't a half pepperoni/sausage, half pepperoni/mushroom pizza and mild wings as I ordered. Instead it was a half pepperoni, half pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza (which ""coincidentally"" offers them an added cost for the same amount of toppings, just different arrangement) and PLAIN wings. When I called right after the driver left, the guy who took the order blamed the ""miscommunication"" on me, then called me a liar about the wings, saying he ""tossed them himself"". I even took a picture of the PLAIN wings for proof, but that was as far as he was willing to go; A regular customer got the wrong order because he was in a hurry, that customer was also over charged, and ""too bad"", because he couldn't care less.

It's sad that I have to stop frequenting a place I loved, but if that is their new customer service attitude, I would rather not waste my money there.",wPvp7ok3vK43HRE4Y930LA,5,0,1,mVu2kgKQINeJzJGjk_Spow

Not going to totally knock it though.  It's alright.  However , the employees don't pay much attention to special requests,  so be sure to check your pie before you leave other wise you will be turning on your oven at home to finish cooking the pizza, or it will crumble to dust because your ""well done"" request was taken too literally..  
 Now onto the wings. They are good , usually nice size wings but ask for extra sauce as they occasionally come out dry. I recommend these instead of the pizza.

I don't know if this is normal for delivery since I always just order to pick up (that's what I get for being lazy) but if it is, I would say just take the trip, it's worth it. 

Other than that, Tropicana Pizza is cool.",2hY1Cyr1SSRHiXjyHl-k_Q,1,0,4,Ysp7yO8sk375Q5P3bLSSgQ

I remember back in the 80's and 90's Tropicana Pizza being just AWESOME - big, thin, fold able, greasy slices of yummy gut bomb pizza - USED TO BE. The first time was just OK but not bad. The second time was atrocious !!! I will never buy from this location again. We ordered a special they have for 2 large pizzas, 1/2 a bucket of wings and 1/2 a bucket of fingers. Everything came timely and the order was correct, but when it arrived we were informed by the delivery driver that the total he gave us on the phone was 10 bucks less than it should have been. OK now I am irritated at best. The food was correct, but as I was pulling out the extra hot sauce, under the edge of the lids on every hot sauce tub we received was a green and white mold just caked thick. So, I called and complained and they sent the driver out with ""new"" hot sauce and I gave him back the nasty sauce. After I showed him the mold he informed me that it was ""pizza sauce"" - GREEN AND WHITE FURRY PIZZA SAUCE ? HUH? I am a papered chef  I know what mold looks like. So, I said to the belligerent driver ""The problem is that I know how nasty and dirty your coolers are if you didn't even know there was moldy spilled sauce."" after which I was informed that they do not keep their hot sauce in a cooler because ""you don't need to"". By now I am thoroughly pissed off. The next day I called the store manager and informed her of my issues with her night crew. She offered me 2 new pizzas, but as I told her, I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT KITCHEN.  I just wanted her to be aware of the goings on. BUYER BEWARE, it may taste good but...WHAT HORRORS LIE IN WAIT INSIDE THE KITCHEN UNBEKNOWNST TO YOU !!!

P.S. Read the ""filtered out"" reviews. They say the same. Why are they not shown? hmmmmmmm?",r7NQ5zhrku8jc-PDGsQI7w,4,1,1,YYY8_O-a1Z7niU4T4QAM0g

""Hole in the wall pit stop for good wings on the east side.""

Food/Drink: The chicken wings are so tasty that I've found myself coming in every other day for them at one point. Another wonderful thing is that they do make their own ranch sauce (which is really good and will order extra). I've tried a few of the flavors but mostly the dry rubs and have no complaints. For $4.99 you can get wings with fries which come out hot, fresh, and crispy.  Because of my wanting to venture into other options, I've decided to try the calzone one day. They at the time did not have spinach so I had to choose three other ingredients out of what was available.  Upon receiving the calzone I noticed it was a pretty big size and the outside looked like it was baked perfectly.  When I got home to eat the calzone, it was gooey on the inside and half baked.  If it wasn't for the wings to keep me wanting to come back then I would still be there at least once a week regardless of my bad experience with my calzone.  But it is the service that I received yesterday which made me decide that I don't plan on coming back anytime soon unless there is new management.

Service: For the most part, service from the workers is friendly and the orders are brought out pretty quick.  There is the manager there with glasses who when I come in he just seems to be a little snippy every time I make an order. Actually, he was the person that I made my calzone order with and after taking it home and noticing it had that wet dough flavor, I called to talk to him about it. He then asked for me to come in to the restaurant because he would ""take care of me"".  I came in after a couple days to order an eight pack of wings instead of a calzone to make up for the discrepancy and he charged me $5 for my my order (with the wings being about same price as the calzone). His reasoning for my calzone coming out gooey was ""because their ovens don't cook them all the way through and that's just the way that they are"".  If that was the case then there is a problem in my opinion and the ovens need to either be fixed or calzones should NOT be made at all.  I came in a couple days later to order a salad and even brought a relative with me (wanting to give the establishment another chance because I love the wings there). I asked the manager about a particular salad and he in a very rude manner responds, ""we can't make that salad because we don't have all of the ingredients"".  This made me wonder why the salad was advertised on the chalkboard menu for customers to be misled when it could've easily been erased? Also this is not the first time that I've ordered anything where they did not have enough ingredients to make a final product.  Eventually one of the workers walked over where we were so then i ask him about a salad and he acknowledges me talking to him but immediately walks back to the order window and stands there. I sit there and I wonder to myself, ""Was he about to come and help us with our order or not?"" The whole experience really bothered me and I decided to walk out of the restaurant. 

Atmosphere: the place is right next to a local bar in which I saw a lot of the workers going back and forth between both spots through a side door. I have to say from the ordering area you can see into parts of kitchen and it does look like they do a good job in cleaning the whole restaurant.  It's tucked away in a small hole in the wall  between a bar and a title loan  office on the east side.  

Price: the prices aren't too bad for what you pay for.

MY THOUGHTS?: Sadly, this place lost my business due to bad service from their management. It's kind of funny how when I let the manager know that I thought my food should've been given to me for free (to make up for my last order which was a calzone that was uncooked), he addresses me by shortening my name as a way to appease me which only aggravated me even further (especially from someone I don't even know). My experience shouldn't dictate anybody else's experience of wanting to come back or let alone giving this place a chance. But I am yelping because of my disappointment in the service that I am apprehensive about receiving if ever I wanted to eat there again.  It's just unfortunate since I've talked highly about their food recently to my girlfriends who also live on the east side knowing how hard it is as an Eastsider to find good places to eat. I thought I found a gem and now that gem has lost its luster. I don't plan on coming back here anytime soon.  

RECOMMENDATIONS: There is a Thai lady who works there who I suggest ordering from because she is really nice. Also, stay away from the calzones because you will be eating nothing but dough.",nY9FUScv1oLEo-XNjOcr4g,5,0,2,qz1mGZz4eQTOPN0hQsiE0A
