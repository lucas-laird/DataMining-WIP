244546,2013-04-22,1,c2l80imPWR8V6gIEM02XPg,"We wanted the food to be hot since we live a long way from the restaurant so we looked on there website and wrote down what we wanted so we could order there.

We ordered the family dinner B for $29.99 what according to there website was to include: 3 main dishes, house fried rice, large steamed rice, large hot & sour soup, 3 egg rolls, 3 crab rangoons.

According to the website if you spent $25.00 you got a FREE order of Shrimp fried rice.

When all was said and done and we paid it was over $44 for a $29.99 special.

The manager did nothing but argue and tells us we ordered wrong and that we did not get the shrimp fried rice free because we ordered a family special and that the house fried rice does not come with the family special when it clearly states that on there website.

We told him to take the rice back then and refund us some money and he would not give a dime back.

They do not want return customers. This is not the only complaint on here about being over charged and about there bad customer service.

I guess there goal is to get your money and hold on to it even if they make the customer mad. They really need to take  class on customer service and making the customer happy.

I certainly hope that food is outstanding but I have am worried after reading other reviews.

Sad because we used to eat there all the time when we lived on the West side of town.

Looks like it is time to find  new Chinese restaurant.",m0oUG1lD9gJm7BNF7zICjg,4,0,1,fqNYnmSy-hZSf-YORp3yrg

It was on point!!  My husband had the house fried rice which came with chicken BBQ pork and shrimp. He is not a fan of egg or anything that has egg in it and when he opened it he was a bit disappointed it had egg but he said the first bite was awesome. I looked over and his plate was half way gone. I guess u can say he loved it. Our meal also came with 2 spring rolls that were great as well. I'm pregnant and a lot of food doesn't agree with me (this baby is picky) especially if it's not cooked properly, temperature ain't right, or if it is greasy. This please had me happy this evening. Cravings were satisfied and I will definitely be back for more in the near future. Oh yea don't let me forget the hot sauce. I want to say it's a garlic chili paste- man it was the best I had since I lived in SoCal and yes I live here in Vegas.

I have yet to try any real meals here as I was walking back to work from the post office and wanted a better snack than what I had back at my office,

Looking over there menu a few things jumped out and I must say that there lunch and dinner specials are a great deal! I plan on having lunch there very soon and will give a better review regarding the rest of there food. but....

My biggest turn off about this place is that it is a hole in the wall! There neon lights are burnt out, there dinning area is dingy and dirty. It is pretty hot inside.. I guess there trying to save on there electric bill. There dinning furniture is old and belongs on a back porch not in a restaurant, it looks like they bought it from the outdoor flea market but hey it works right!!! There service was ok! not bad enought to really complain but it would be nice if the lady could speak better english!

942855,2015-01-24,0,c2l80imPWR8V6gIEM02XPg,"Definitely the worst orange chicken I've ever had; the chicken was dry with a plastic-like texture, the breading wasn't crispy at all, and the sauce was remarkably flavorless. It looked good and I was starving so I kept trying more, but I regretted each bite. So much chewing, so little flavor. 

The egg rolls were marginally better. They're the premade, frozen kind that are roughly half breading. You can get comparable ones from the freezer in the grocery store. They were the highlight of this meal.

For the record, I ordered there and took the food straight home. I live a little over a minute away. Yet, next time I want Chinese food and don't want to wait, I'll make the fifteen minute drive to Teriyaki Madness.

I will say that the portions are huge!! My teriyaki I had to take it home and ate twice that day because there was so much. So that's great! The food is worth the money. 
The shrimp with vegetables was pretty yummy and I loved the meat in the teriyaki but their sauce cannot be called teriyaki. It did not taste like teriyaki at all and I didn't really like it. But the plate was good and I would actually order it again. 
Wasn't the best food but decent food. 
What I thought was really rude was that the lady brought us the wrong order to our table. We were hungry so we were gonna start eating. And she came over and took all the food without saying anything. So we were so confused.

The place is nothing to look at from the outside,  but it's clean and has easy in / easy out parking.  The food is good. Nothing was greasy, overcooked or overbreaded. Even the kung pow chicken was done correctly, with fresh chicken, not frozen chicken nuggets in a bottled sauce. This was lightly fried with lots of crisp veggies. The lo mein was good. The egg rolls were light, although heavier than a spring roll, which is to be expected.  The food came out quickly and was a good size portion for the money.

Egg Rolls: Good
Black Bean Shrimp: Too salty, asked for spicy but wasn't spicy and salty instead.
Orange Chicken: Chicken undercooked. 

Spend your money at Panda Express. You're watching the cooks make the food and in a more comforting environment. The food is cheap here but would you rather feel disgusted after? Up to you.

The beef & broccoli consists of a little beef, a bit of broccoli, and, inexplicably, a lot of carrots and mushrooms as filler? I like mushrooms but really don't care for carrots, this was an unpleasant surprise. Sauce was decently flavored but on the watery side. Portion for price wasn't as great of a value as I had anticipated.

Wor Won Ton Soup was incredibly disappointing. Takeout container is packed with tons of chicken, some shrimp, and a lot of fresh produce, and the won ton skins held up well. But the broth is unforgivably weak and flavorless! 

Rice To Go (cheesy name and all) is a far better option for quick, takeout Chinese with better selection and quality, get thee to Decatur & Spring Mountain instead.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,4,3,fhXGWBofK5OrLxkXxTvsJw
2084428,2015-02-09,0,c2l80imPWR8V6gIEM02XPg,"So I came back. I always like to give places the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off day or whatever. So this time I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and cream cheese rangoons. So the bowl comes from the back, and the cashier, who I assume is the owner, has a large container of teriyaki sauce up front and she puts the sauce on top of the bowl. Well she poured at least 2 CUPS worth of teriyaki sauce on top. 2 huge spoonfuls.  I swear it was swimming in sauce. The worse part is the sauce was bad. I like teriyaki sauce, but this one was off putting. It didn't even really taste like teriyaki. ""Would you like some chicken, rice and vegetables with your teriyaki sauce?"" the lady should have asked me. There was a decent amount of chicken and veggies, but there was wayyyy too much rice. Side note, there are 2 sizes for the teriyaki bowls. The small size is an actual bowl, think Panda Express one entree. The large is in a to-go container, think Panda Express 2 entree. I got about 1 entrees worth of chicken and veggies, and about 3 entrees worth of rice. Next time, I would go with the small bowl.

The cream cheese in the rangoon was pretty much non-existent, so they should just change this to rangoon. I swear the only day I forget my phone is the day that I wish I had it so you could see what I am talking about. The over load of sauce, and the no cream cheese cream cheese rangoons. Unfortunately I won't be back.

I've heard up and down reviews about Red Shrimp.  The reason my work went with this place for our luncheon was because of their ad placed in one of the local papers.  It had coupons for some extras with qualifying orders.  I'm guessing we got a decent deal for the food to feed 60+ folks.

The food from Red Shrimp however?  Kinda MEH.  Very MEH.  Not my favorite type of hole-in-the-wall Chinese food that I like.  Maybe it was in the execution?  Maybe it was because it was delivered and not eaten at the restaurant?  It just wasn't that great to me.  The food from Panda Express I think I even like more.

Here's the dealio:

-The lo mein was OILY.  Like greasy.  Greasier than usual.  Very slick going down, not yummy.

-The egg rolls were pretty basic.  Possibly store bought and just fried.  But damn was the ginger strong in them.

-The beef broccoli was average.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar either.  It's what you find at any Chinese restaurant here.

-The sweet sour pork was hard!  Might have been overfried or stood too long before serving.  There were bits of pork in there that were difficult to chew.  Taste was ok, but damn did I have a lot of onions to go through.

-Main saving grace was the chicken fried rice.  This was the best thing on my plate(s).  That in itself was pretty yummy, but how hard is it to mess up fried rice??

The lunch special was $5.25 when I got it for a pretty large serving of seasame chicken and fried rice. An egg roll was also included. 

I like to give restaurants a chance to impress me, even if they are run down ma and pop kind of places. I wish I had known this was a ""fast food"" Chinese place. It looked pretty dingy and sad. It was strange, when you walk in you see sort of like a panda express/buffet-like area with display glass. However, there wasn't food there (except fortune cookies), and you had to order your food from the lady at the front. You paid, and then when it was ready, you picked it up from the front. In that respect, it is nice to have fresh food. It was pretty hot though, even when I tried to cool it down. 

I had the seasame chicken, but I wonder if she thought I said sweet and sour. It had the sweet and sour flavor to me, but it was sprinkled with seasame seeds. I have only experienced seasame chicken at a Japanese restaurant before, and it was such a bad comparison. It was too tangy and greasy here. It was not appetizing to eat it at all. It was very saucy, and it took up half my plate. I didn't finish the chicken. The fried rice was also unappetizing. I don't know what they used to stir fry it with, but it wasn't good, just tasted greasy. I wish I had gotten the steamed rice instead. I ate it, but I did not enjoy it at all. The vegetable egg roll that it came with (also included a little sauce cup of sweet and sour sauce) was also pretty strange tasting to me. It was doughy but also had some juicy sauce in there. It was strange for my mouth, but it wasn't bad per say. It wasn't very good either. 

They also have ice cream, but I didn't want to have any. It was a strange inclusion. 

I feel incredibly sad, because I wanted to enjoy them... but it was just not good. I don't see how they can live with themselves serving those plates. However, there was a usual there when I went, and a few others when I went around 1pm. To each their own. I would have rather gone to Panda Express. 

The lady in the front seemed nice, but I like to see the good in people. Because I paid with a credit card, she charged me a total of $6, even though it is $5.70 with tax. I didn't mind. 

I did not enjoy anything about the place except for the price, and in retrospect, was it really worth $5.25 or rather $6? Not really. i didn't even get a fortune cookie from the mountain they displayed in the front.

I live around the corner from this place, and pass by it all the time. I'm picky about my Chinese food, and get nervous trying new places.

Yesterday, as a bit of back story, I spent all day with my roommates cleaning our house and garage.  
By 4:00pm, I was starving, and ready to just order in and veg out.

My roommate and looked up the menu for Red Shrimp Company, since we had just seen it again Saturday night, and were curious about the food.

The web ordering process was confusing, so we called in and ordered the family meal, to feed 3 people.  This came with: 3 entrees (picked from a list, not from the full menu), steamed rice, a choice of fried rice or shrimp lo mein, your choice of soups, and 3 egg rolls and 3 crab rangoon.

We were quoted about 55 minutes for the delivery, which was fine.  

About 35 minutes later, the food had arrived!  

So excellent points on a quick and speedy delivery.

The Orange Chicken:  Good.  Better than some that I've had.  
The Kung Pao Chicken:  very good.  I don't do spicy, and it had a very nice heat to it.  
The Moo Goo Gai Pan: exceptional.  I'd never had it before, so i can't really compare it to other places, but I REALLY liked the flavor. 

The chicken was tender in all three entrees.

Crab Rangoon:  AWESOME.  It was still hot, and was not soggy, like some places rangoons are when delivered.  I enjoyed it a lot. 

Egg rolls: Meh.  I've had better.  

Lo Mein:  The menu had said shrimp, but we got chicken.  Minor disappointment, but the chicken was moist and tender, and the noodles were great, so no biggie. 

Rice:  We were supposed to get steamed rice, but they gave us chicken fried rice instead.  Nice surprise.  It was good, but...a little bland, and kind of dry.  

The soup, I hated, but my roommate loved.  We got the Egg Flower soup...I personally think it looked like snot, and had a snotty/slimey/gross texture to it.  I've had homemade Egg drop soup before and liked it, but this was just nasty.  

So, all in all, it was ok.  I think we definitely got our moneys worth.  

I'd order from here again, for sure, just to try some of the other options, and for more Crab Rangoon.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,0,3,HUWMnz6C2DtHON69dAdezw

I decided to go to Red Shrimp Co. so I didn't have to suffer through the horrible Chinatown traffic. Their food is average at best, but nothing too spectacular.

I ordered the Mongolian beef and scallop fried rice. 

The Mongolian beef's sweet chili sauce was pretty good. Not overbearing and goes great as a drizzle over the steamed white rice they give you with the order. Unfortunately, there were WAY too many leeks and white onions than there was actual beef. It was also soaked in an unappealing orange-tinted oil. 

Not many Chinese take-out places offer scallop fried rice as an option, so I went with it. The scallop fried rice was a bit bland for my liking. They were super sparing on the scallops as well (I saw a few scallop bits in there, but it wasn't that many). 

Here at the Red Shrimp Company, they give you a lot of food for an okay price for what it's worth... I think this place definitely has the ""quantity over quality"" ideology here. I'm a little bit disappointed that their dishes were like 80% ""filler"" ingredients, but I can't expect too much from a run-of-the-mill Chinese take-out place...

I stopped ordering because we moved to a different area.  Now that I moved back I was excited that I could have them deliver again and on top of that able to order online.  

I selected the family meal for two, and submitted the payment online.  15 minutes later I get a call from the restaurant indicating that ""they"" did the order wrong and I have to pay again as it wasn't right? so I had to place my order again..  After confirming that I wouldn't be double charged I reluctantly gave them my information again and confirmed my order....... 5 minutes later...I see two different amount charges on my bank account.

After several attempts at calling the restaurant back (kept getting a busy signal)  I asked that they ensure my money was refunded.  They stated they would call back for the refund confirmation.

In the meantime, my ordered was delivered.  I was SOOOO disappointed.  There was absolutely NO FLAVOR in any of the items ordered.  

Egg Flower soup - was watered down
Beef with Broccoli - soggy and seemed to have been out for a while, then reheated
White Rice - hard to chew
Chicken Fried Rice - no flavor/seasoning
Sesame Chicken - my boyfriend had it.. it didn't tempt me enough to eat

I would say the only good thing that came out of that meal were the 4 egg rolls they included in the order.

Oh.. and in regards to my refund for the double charge.  I ended up having to go to the restaurant in order to ask for my refund.  As I never received a call back that night..

5759032,2013-03-16,2,c2l80imPWR8V6gIEM02XPg,"WARNING!!!  STAY AWAY!!!  Please read if you are thinking of trusting your well being to this restaurant. 

 I just ordered what cost me (with tip) about $50 for delivery.  Terrible experience.  Nothing was right in 6 items!  

     But here is the main reason that I am so disturbed about my experience with this restaurant:  THE CARROTS IN MY DISHES WERE NOT CLEANED!  Instead of peeling off the dirty skin of the carrots to clean them, they include the dirty skin, stir fry it and serve it to you it in the meal!  My dishes had all kinds of odd pieces of carrots with the dirty skin still on.  I took a mouth full of the first dish and it tasted like garbage!  Like dirt! Literally!  There is no way that they even washed the carrots!  

     In the next dish, the string beans were not cleaned!  They did not have the string removed so it was impossible to eat them.  My zucchini and other veggies were undercooked and tasted rotten and raw!  Other dishes were soggy, oily, wrongly seasoned, tasteless and just plain bad.  Even the white rice was dry and hard to chew.  The Hot & Sour soup has no traditional ingredients in it that makes it a hot and sour soup.  It just had a few pieces of beef in it and small broken mushrooms.  Everything was either raw tasting, or tasteless or tasted like garbage, because it actually was.  The dirty skin of vegetables are to be discarded, not to fed to a guy who just made a $50 order.

     So, the nice guy that I am, I just figured I should give them a break and not to write a negative review on Yelp for them.  This is only my 5th Yelp review ever and two of them are extremely positive!  So I called them and tried to talk to the younger lady Margaret who spoke clear English and to make my complaints to her.  The older lady who is the owner, treated me like I am an idiot and kept telling me that she was Margaret!  So I started telling her how dissatisfied I was about the food.  Then she rudely started talking Chinese to someone else in the background in the middle of my complaining.  She was not listening!  I finally got her to get the younger lady back on the phone.  I told her all about my complaints and said that if I was not sick, I would have come back with the food and asked for a refund.  

     Now, here is why I am writing all this when I did not intend to make a negative yelp review:  When I told the young lady, Margaret all of my complaints, she said:  ""YEAH, I KNOW!  I TELL THEM ALL THE TIME OF THESE COMPLAINTS BUT NOTHING CHANGES!""   She basically said that she can not really tell them anymore, cause ""he is the boss and I do not want to get fired""!   Wow!  She did not want to tell the boss, which turned out to be her uncle of the complaints anymore so that she can keep her job.  People are calling all the time and complaining and these people are still ripping people off and endangering the public's health with garbage food!  

     I just see so clearly that they are comfortable sending garbage out to delivery orders because there is a less of a chance that the guy will drive all the way back to the restaurant to ask for his money back.  But this food can make people sick.  I do not know if I will not be sick tomorrow for the little of the nasty food that I ate today.  If I was not sick and unable to leave the house I would have gone over there right now and give them back the garbage and not left without my money.  I threw the rest of the so called food away as I did not trust any of it anymore.  I am already sick and recovering from a surgery and do not want to add food poisoning to the list of my current issues.  

   And they are also fraudulent as they engage in false advertising on top of everything.  The flyer says you get a free order of walnut shrimp with a $35 order.  When you get your order, what you get is not an order of walnut shrimp, but a HALF ORDER, which comes in one of those small containers that fits a McDonald's burger!  

     If they are cheating and short-changing the customer at every chance, I wonder how their refrigerators looks like.  There is no way these people are throwing away any rotting old ingredients.  They are probably just tossing them into the wok and feeding them to the people, and I believe I was one such victim today.   The internal culture of this place is obvious at every turn and I am just in a state of disbelief that they are in business.

     For the first time ever, I do not feel that complaining to the restaurant or making a Yelp complaint is enough.  I am going to call the Health Department and file an official complaint.  Something needs to be done and someone needs to take the initiative or these people are going to be ripping people off and serving them garbage for a long time to come.  When will they be stopped?  When someone gets food poisoning?  When someone gets hospitalized?  

     I feel a duty to make the Health Department aware of the situation.  As far as you are concerned, you have been warned.  Stay away!",CHNOxAJZrHO2BkpHR3FDMA,5,0,1,HrpSOPfXA4JYtpQbxna8Hw

What we ordered:

crab rangoons, egg rolls, cashew chicken, garlic shrimp, sweet walnut shrimp, shrimp in lobster sauce, pepper beef, house fried rice, house lo mein, orange chicken.

It took two delivery people to carry the two heavy boxes of food. We had a mini Chinese buffet going on in my Condo :) You must go and look at the photos I uploaded for this review!

Ok so the service was excellent, the food was hot and fresh! Everything was delicious especially the honey walnut shrimp. Our only item that we did not care for was the shrimp in lobster sauce. No flavor at all and it was super runny and unappealing. 

I am happy to say that this last experience has bumped the Red Shrimp Co up to a 4 star rating which is a huge jump from previous ratings.

i ordered chicken and broccoli very spicy and chicken with mixed veggies. they get the order about ready to go, read it off and i tell her that the one entree is supposed to be chicken and broccoli not beef and broccoli... she then takes it out shows me the beef and broccoli and says something along the lines of me to look that its beef and broccoli... i tell her again its supposed to be chicken and broccoli she goes in the back comes back out calls someone over and then says its beef and broccoli i say i know its supposed to be chicken and broccoli she then asks if beef and broccoli is ok... i say no its supposed to be chicken and broccoli... she then finally goes in the back and has them make it... no apology no nothing.... 

to top the experience off, when we got the food home it wasnt even good. it was actually pretty bad (usually its around average, but this time it was just... well, bad)

The daughter (I assume) works the cash register and takes the order, the mom expedites the orders, and the dad with the other Chinese cooks prepares the items on the menu.

It is located at the NE corner of W. Flamingo and S. Jones.  The restaurant has a few simple tables and chairs for customers dining in or waiting for their to-go orders. They also do lunch deliveries within the vicinity with a minimum order of $15.  It is opened daily pretty much from around 11amto 10:30pm.

Since moving recently and being just a block away from Red Shrimp, I finally decided to go check them out.  After staring at the menu with all of those choices, I finally settled on the dinner entree portion of Shrimp with Lobster Sauce (which is prepared using 18 ct shrimps, meaning there are about 18 shrimps in a pound).  I paid my bill and picked an empty table near the window while I waited for my dinner.  Before I knew it, it was already ready for pickup, and I think it took less than 4 minutes.
It comes with a lot of rice and the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was piping hot when I poured it out onto my microwavable plate.  And guess what?  It has 17 shrimps!  That is practically a pound of prawns for just a little over $10.  It tasted good, not too salty and the shrimps was cooked well, not overcooked and rubbery.

Will definitely drop by for their lunch specials.
