A search for the missing ingredient led me to Kinnaree where the old welcoming front staff, and the talented cooks are now found. 

Service is very friendly and informative. Everything done with a smile and good humor.

The food is excellent and well spiced. Solid range of top tasting options (meat and vegetarian). My favorite dish, Lad Na, is the best in the valley... overjoyed to find this cook again!

There is a sister post on Komol's site that agrees with many others about its slide in standards, and advises those with a similar sense of loss to find what they have been missing at Kinnaree.",jCRsTchKcHsqy9lhGavRbg,3,5,5,7UMULyMSKVHTdJ51m9eCtA

204640,2015-07-28,0,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,Overall it was alright. The fast delivery was awesome. I'm half Thai so my taste is often discerning with Thai staples. So I opted to try one traditional Thai plate and a not so traditional one. Their tofu pad Thai was slightly lacking in flavor. The pork in the Chinese broccoli and roasted pork was a tad dry. Sticky rice was stale. And boring egg rolls. :/ the cost was basic for most Thai/Chinese delivery. Unfortunately I probably won't order from here again. I need more pizzaz in my food.,zf6jIhosqOfKcqWaFHFqZw,0,0,3,uHJLpJVIvcmJOPW9Aih-GQ

We found this restaurant when we were looking for something closer to home. We are not vegetarians and wondered if we might be disappointed as many of the reviewers spoke highly of the veggie offerings but not so much about the food for we carnivores.  Well, we certainly were not disappointed.  The food was probably the best Thai food we have had outside of Thailand and we have tried many restaurant in Las Vegas and around the world. The Tom Kha Kai soup was the best, and the Pad Thai and Green curry did not disappoint and all came spiced as we asked.  The meal was also served with optional spices to add if desired, which is a much appreciated touch.

250799,2013-10-05,3,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"Kinnaree is the West Side Komol, literally. Our favorite server from our favorite Thai spot in Vegas opened her own place on the west side and it is fantastic. Living near UNLV, obviously Komol is a lot closer, so going out of our way for a meal at Kinnaree should speak for itself. 

We get the mushroom tom kha every time. Its creamy coconut and lemony freshness goes perfect with a side of brown rice medley. 

My girl gets the yellow curry entr√©e while I opt for the sesame chicken and we both share the pad kee mao with tofu. 

Other reviews are spot on when they say to over order. This is a must. The food is absolutely amazing. Sample as many flavors as you can, the leftovers hold up well on the reheat. 

I must also reiterate the fact that the owner of Kinnaree was at one time the best server at Komol, so good service is practically their mantra here. The dining room is also very clean and comfortable. The quality of the food earns 5 stars alone. You will not be disappointed.",7BY6b405rPD0xmSwcXkBZg,9,6,5,mIXNIhvhUmxbr4ArnqROzw

356533,2013-11-13,1,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"This place gets 4 instead of 5 stars only because I wasn't a huge fan of their red curry with tofu, and that is my favorite dish I always order at Thai restaurants to compare them all.  It wasn't bad though....just kinda ""mushy"" (it may have been because they put eggplant in it....i hate eggplant and it is usually not in red curry).

However, their crab rangoons and fried tofu were both incredible.  my friend and I ate ALL of them, even after they were already cold (they were even good cold lol).  We may or may not have been a little high but that is besides the point :p

Also got some sort of soup which was good but had a giant mushroom in it that freaked me out a bit.

Delivery took some time but the guy said it was his first day...he was very apologetic and nice.  I can't judge because I get lost everywhere I go...I couldn't imagine being a delivery driver!

Next time I order, I think I'll just order like 3 orders each of the fried tofu and crab rangoons, and send myself into an imitation crab/soy/deep fried food induced coma, only to wake up 3 days later craving more.  mmmmmmm",xCDvbp5pkGgPF37Q2F1dNg,2,1,4,QtjYmoqcuolZQcDfZXp3bg

389976,2014-06-21,0,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"I had the duck curry (Heat: 7) and green papaya salad (Heat: 5).

Green papaya salad had excellent flavors and came with two shrimp. The shrimp were not completely cleaned. Looks like they were cleaned, but there was some leftover intestinal crap, as if they cleaned the shrimp carelessly. 

The duck curry was superb. The curry was rich and creamy. Tasted almost exactly like Lotus of Siam. The duck on the other hand, could have been cleaned slightly better. There were some very chewy, almost inedible parts. The flavor on most of the duck was good though.

I will echo the comments of other reviews and say that their spice level is very mild. The level 7 curry tasted fairly mild.

502058,2014-05-24,0,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"I am an occasional user of Yelp, but have been a free-loader until today.  Kinnaree is so good in every way that it even got lazy ole' me to get off of my butt to write a review.

I first went there about three months ago and have returned more-or-less weekly since then.  I love Thai food and have tried almost all of the options in Las Vegas.  This is now my favorite Thai restaurant outside of Bangkok (tied with one in SF).

Kinnaree has two menus, one for meat-eaters and the other vegetarian.  I have tried many of the options on both menus and what's notable is that everything that I've tasted is quite good (if not terrific).  In most places, my normal MO is to find a dish that I really like and keep on ordering it.  However, it is a fun challenge here to keep on trying new items until I find one that is so-so . . . I'm still waiting to be disappointed.  My favorites here are the soups, the curries, and -- especially -- the Steamed Seabass with lemon juice.  The Seabass comes with a super-tasty medley of veggies.  Baby doll!

The location is what scares me (from the point of view of Kinnaree's success):  it's in just another strip-mall on Sahara.  I'd guess that this restaurant will rely on word-of-mouth and positive reviews in order to thrive.  On the inside, though, it is comfortable and lovely.

The staff is wonderful.  The woman who is in charge and her assistant are both charming Thai ladies.  Their English is better than fine; but what's notable is the combination of their hustle and their charm.  If I were a single man, they'd be a big reason to choose Kinnaree.

In summary, this place is excellent.  I hope that you will give it a try.  If you do, I'll bet that you return often, as I have.",R8m3-REoo4k_P9ChKdv5lw,2,6,5,68wBRgAVo1fyPLoYovvKYQ

524036,2013-12-08,1,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"I usually look to Yelp to figure out where to eat.  Usually, Yelp never steers me wrong...but this time it did.  Badly!  I saw the great reviews for this place and decided to give it a try.  Extremely disappointing.  Not sure what the good reviews are for.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing or maybe it was an off day for the chef but it was pretty horrible.  

My husband and I ordered some fried wontons to start.  These were probably the only good thing about our food.  There wasn't really a whole lot of meat in there but the sauce it came with and the fried part was good.  For our entrees, my husband and I ordered our go-to dish: Chicken Pad See Ewe.  Ugh!  The reviewers that said the pad see ewe was great must be on something or have no taste buds.  My husband and I agreed it was probably the worst pad see ewe we've ever had.  It was totally dry and flavorless!  Barely any sauce.  It was like it was an old batch of pad see ewe that had been made in the morning and then they just reheated it in the microwave.  Either that, or the chef overcooked the hell out of it...so much so that it sucked all the sauce (and all the flavor) out.  It wasn't even steaming hot like how I usually see fresh pad see ewe come out to me.  It was barely warm.  The chinese broccoli looked old and wilted.

The only reason why I didn't give 1 star is because the service was good and our waitress was really nice and pleasant.  Also, they serve fountain sodas (which I like) instead of soda from a can like how I usually see at Thai restaurants. 

If you like meat and you like your food to have flavor, then don't eat here!  Maybe this place is just good for the vegetarian food.  What we got was pretty awful.  From now on, I'm sticking to Thai Style Noodle House.  Bigger portions, better prices, and better tasting food!",dAhV0ka-Toxs9_JTfAqxlA,1,0,2,V-stQNkDHXwODj8A64TpSA

It is a cute and very clean restaurant, and the hostess was friendly, informative and quick to serve us. I had a vegetarian salad called herbal salad, and it was delicious, though I am not a fan of fried tofu and it was a little heavy in the salad. The ingredients were crisp, fresh, colorful and very nicely sprinkled with good basil and mint. The dressing was fantastic. I am certain that the papaya salad would be the same. Orange chicken was nicely breaded strips of white chicken, perfectly crisp and hot and juicy inside, not over-sauced....and the sauce was delicious. It was a good portion at a very good price, and a couple of chardonnays at $6 each made our meal about $32 total. We loved it.",n9bbcV0ybyNTsbBp1IIZCA,2,1,5,htb2LYR4Dz1KvWArgCA55g

I'm vegetarian and I love to eat at Thai restaurants because they can substitute tofu for any meat, but this restaurant goes even further by having an entirely separate vegetarian and vegan menu. It's a great feeling to look at a menu and know that I can order anything on it. 

The restaurant itself is small but very pleasant. It's nicely decorated and it has ambiance for informal dining. This is the type if place where you might bring your family. The waitress taking my order was very nice and did a great job of explaining some of the items on the menu. 

I had the appetizer spring rolls, then the cashew nut entree with tofu, following by sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert. The spring rolls were really good, and came with a really great sweet and sour sauce. The cashew nut was also quite tasty. If there was one thing I didn't like as much, it would be the coconut ice cream. I believe it was vegan ice cream, which means it's non-dairy and nonfat, which sort of sucks all the fun out of ice cream. But on top of that, the ice cream had chopped up green beans and corn in it. I can't say it was horrible, but it wasn't great. 

That being said, this was a great place and I can't wait to go there again at some point to try other things on the vegetarian menu.",n6n3RnhXjdFKxVntanRGWw,0,0,4,zaMndwCmMK1A8yMoskGa8Q

When we walked in at around 7:30pm on a weekday, there was only one couple there.  I wondered how a place with so many Yelp stars could be so empty.  But by the time we left, the place was packed.

To start, we ordered eggrolls.  They were free with Yelp check-in and they were great!  I ordered the sesame chicken and it was great!  I loved the sauce.  My friend got Pad Thai and enjoyed it, but said that she wishes she would have gotten it hotter.  (She ordered an 8 out of 10 on the hot scale and it was still not hot enough for her.)  We split a cucumber salad, which was very good.  Sweet and light, with cucumbers, red onion and shredded carrot.  I also ordered a Thai iced tea, which was good, as well.

Decor is simple, but cute.  There's a TV on the wall, where you can watch sports or whatever is on if you want.  It is not overly noisy, so you can actually have a conversation.  Service was very good.  The hostess/waitress made sure we were taken care of.

I'm going to dream about the food. Not in a normal way, a naughty way. A thick rich...just see my pics...

Oh and before you read the veg porn below the customer service was AWESOME. Prompt, polite, and really caring to our needs. After we ordered everything she actually said ""everything vegan right?"" uh yes and I love you................

APP: We started off with veggie potstickers (v), they were perfect! If you don't like a warm pocket of ground up veggie goodness rolling around all in your mouth...don't order these. The sauce was also yummy.

I asked for ""spicy stuff"" and she brought me a three turner of: a red chili sauce, jalape√±os, and hot ground pepper flake.

MAIN: I had yellow (v) curry and brown rice. I'm going to dream about taking a bath in yellow curry. Not just any yellow curry. This yellow curry...thick, rich, flavorful with a little kick of spice...yellow curry. Calgon...I mean curry...take me away...
Give me your sexy soft potatoes in my mouth, give me your crisp flavorful veggies all day long. YES! Add a size to my pants you think rich curry...oh. 
Seriously this curry was full strength if you know what I mean...

MAIN: We ordered Lo Mein (v) or Chow Mein (who knows) with duck (v) and we were told we could have all those veggies but they were out of that type of noodles. No worries, we picked our fav big flat Chow Fun noodles and ate it right up...soooooo good. Not sure how they made that duck or where they bought it from...but it's the best faux faux I have ever eaten and I don't even like that bs.

MAIN: Crispy as crispy orange chickn'...I mean crispy orange tofu :) (v) that stuff was like they made fresh simmered orange sauce and reduced it into a sticky-icky sweet goodness. Oh wait they did. Dang. They even put fresh oranges all over the top of the dish. Real oranges.

Hubby and I could hardly finish our meal and so no room for dessert.

We chose 3 and it had just a little kick...I could have done 4 or 5. The coconut curry sauce in my vegitarian tofu dish was a little rich for my taste but the over all flavor was nice. If you like pineapple you have to try the Pineapple fried rice! We will definitely be back!

A few points I'd like to hit:

1. VEGETARIAN MENUS! Being a vegan in Vegas can be tricky at times. Here, there is a menu waiting for you!

2. The service is 100% amazing. They seat you quickly, make many rounds to see if you are ready to order and to make sure the quality of the food is nothing but the best. I never like to wait around for the waiter to take my order at other restaurants. That never happens here.

3. The food. I can't get over how delicious everything comes out. I always over-order things because I can't decide what to get; everything just sounds amazing and is amazing! Okay, getting hungry now...

I recently tried the orange tofu, a vegan substitute for orange chicken, and it was dreamy. 

Thank you for always giving me a heavenly experience!

The place is clean and it's nestled in a little shopping center next to a thai massage place so I was ready to be impressed. Thai is my favorite food so I'm always looking for new spots. One of my favorite spots in Vegas is Le Thai and there are some other noteworthy places as well. Since we planned a day at the aquatic center, we stopped here for a quick lunch. We was me, my mom, 2 year daughter and 5 year old niece. The egg rolls were awesome, for our entrees we ordered yellow curry and chicken house noodles. The yellow curry was gross and I've been to Thailand had tons of curry in the past. The noodles were over cooked and looked like throw up on a plate. We told the waitress she could take the plate and toss it- she never offered to let us order something else. The kicker was when we went to claim the two free egg roll yelp coupon, she didn't deduct it from our tab and told us we should have told her when we sat down that we planned to use it, wtf? So between the crap food and service we didn't even bother leaving a tip so I guess that saved us about $6-7 on a meal that was already $30, and it covered our egg rolls. Overpriced, overhyped, bland and bad service. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There's way better Thai in Las Vegas. This was below average and unappetizing and that's being modest. Will never return.

P.S. The kids wouldn't even touch the noodles and they love noodles-- That tells you something. My 2 year old daughter filled up on plain white rice and my niece on the vegetarian egg rolls.

Lots of places will do substitutions to make items Vegetarian or Vegan...At Kinnaree Thai and Vegetarian it's in the name, they have a full menu, and it's anything but an afterthought. 

Kinnaree is not my favorite spot for in town for Thai...but it certainly is for Vegetarian Thai!  I am not a vegetarian...I love meat. But I read a Popular Science article last year that described how ""Americans consume a disproportional amount of the world's stuff...we make up 5 percent of the global population, but use 20 percent of the world's energy. We eat 15 percent of the world's meat. We produce 40 percent of the world's garbage.""  With that in mind I am trying to be a conscientious meat eater which can be incredibly difficult while eating out.  Enter Kinnaree!  I have heard good things about their normal menu, but I come for the veggies!  

I really like the Panang Curry!  Lots of deep, full, balanced flavors!  I have also enjoyed their yellow and green curries.  I typically avoid faux meat products, but the the faux duck and tofu options are better than normal here if you're into that.

The service was excellent,  the menu is huge, and they have a check-in offer as well.

We have been there multiple times, and have enjoyed each item that we have had there.  The appetizers, entrees, and soups are delicious, especially the Tom Kha and Vegetarian Seaweed.

The waitress is helpful, and the service is excellent, with reasonable prices.

We strongly recommend that you visit this restaurant!",x2d3QWawBd3hGEe5ElpjPQ,1,0,5,GEiXD2ubb4IKM-Dn8gMFAw

The Tom Yum wonton soup was great and spicy as ordered. The pad thai was wet and sweetly bland. Could have done w the usual condiments. Duck curry was average. Chinese broccoli w garlic sauce was fresh and crisp, not overcooked which is often the case.

They have a vegan menu which is a bonus (for those who actually are vegan!). However I am also suspect of Thai places that also offer Chinese food. Seems to be the go here.",XrRLaAeV20MRwdSIGjj2SQ,1,0,3,PCa9zg0rAYnFeFeLjFAuvA

4022369,2013-07-15,1,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"I came to Kinnaree last night for my birthday. As a vegetarian and a Thai food lover, I was really excited to see this place open up on my side of town.  

The restaurant wasn't very busy when we got there, but since it is fairly new I figured they were still building up clientele. We ordered a Thai tea and a glass of wine which came out promptly. They have a separate vegetarian menu with meatless forms of all the Thai standards, and it includes options for adding soy duck, chicken, or fish.

I started with a bowl of Tom Kha soup with tofu and vegetables. Tom Kha is my favorite Thai dish, and I order it at every Thai restaurant I try. This was hands down the best Tom Kha I have had in Las Vegas!  I highly recommend this soup when you come here. For our entrees we split an order of panang curry and the Kinnaree special noodles with added soy chicken. The curry was very savory and creamy, and the noodles were pan fried with their special sauce which I also found delicious.  All of the food was excellent and our server was very polite. We ordered all of the spicy meals at level 4 - I felt that it wasn't as spicy as a level 4 at Archi's or Lotus. Next time I will probably get a 6. 

At this point I had already decided that this was my new favorite local Thai restaurant, but what happened next really confirmed it. We went outside and discovered that we had a flat tire (and no spare). Our waitress came out to check on us when she saw us looking at the car. We were planning on calling a taxi, but our waitress insisted on offering us a ride home as it was near the end of her shift. She asked for 10 minutes to finish up, so we waited out in the lot. About five minutes later, her manager came out with a bottle of fix-a-flat and insisted on helping us plug the flat. Five minutes later, we were on our way home! He refused our offers to pay for the help, so we are going to go back for another dinner and to bring him a replacement bottle of fix-a-flat soon!",8wLaRjY32WtXRoJi6_wBWQ,4,0,5,h9YHgzmexZOqxexNrzI1rg

I love the veggie Tom Kah soup especially when my throat is scratchy . It does the trick every time! When I go for Chinese or Thai I get the craving for both noodles and  a rice dish. It can get pricey that is why I just ordered the drunken noodles with a side of white rice instead of fried.  The prices at Kinnaree I find a bit lower than other Thai restaurants in the area.

I chose chicken basil which came with white meat and had a pleasant sauce. The BF got a panang curry which I thought was decent from the bites I got of it, but it's just not my preferred style of how it's seasoned.

The girl serving us was friendly and attentive to boot. 

The plus is this place can cater to all types of diets. We were asked if we eat meat or not and their vegetarian and vegan offerings were pretty solid. I'll probably be back to try more dishes during dinner as some offerings like the herbal salad look worth a return.

You can order as spicy as you want (like all Thai restaurants), but I love how they have a full vegan menu!

I actually got to the point with my friend that we kept ordering the herbal salad (because it was so dang good) until we got burned out :) 

The restaurant is very clean and the server (Bee) is great and attentive. The prices are also reasonable and when I have ordered for pickup I've never had any issues. The one thing I do like is that they are never too busy for a table wait (most of their orders are delivery/pickup it seems) so it's never a long wait. I hate waiting to eat, and here it's always efficient.

Also - if you can - order the sweet sticky rice and mango!! It's the best I've had, and the sticky rice is super tasty! 

To the reviewer that said it was not ""authentic Thai"" based on your trips to Thailand, I gather you ate at the ""safe"" restaurants and not from the local vendors. I speak Thai, and grew up with a Thai mother - so I have a very good taste for Thai food - and I would say you probably ate at the ""foreigner-friendly"" places which are not the true taste of Thailand. In addition to this, different parts of Thailand have different tastes to the food - much like that in the US. Also something to keep in mind.

I usually start off with the Pad Kee Mao & Pad Ka Pao...if these are great, I come back and try the Panang Curry and others the next visit.

""Spicy Basil"" aka Pad Ka Pao ($7.95): Chicken, Garlic, Chilies and Basil. This was a great rendition, although their ""spicy"" is not very spicy here.  I always ask for Thai Spicy : 10/10...I love to sweat, and feel like the flavor in Thai food is in the spices and heat.  Although it wasn't very hot, the flavor was still there and it was enjoyable.

Pad Kee Mao ($7.95): Pork, Garlic, Hot Peppers, and Basil. This was BLAND, not spicy at all, and it was missing something...maybe not enough fish sauce?? Disappointing.  It was probably the least flavorful Pad Kee Mao I've had actually...in the noodles and the pork itself.

Their Lunch Specials are fair prices and portions, and come with choice of soup or salad.  The salad had a pretty tasty peanut sauce, but the soup (not a fan of this soup) was on the bland side.  Stick with the salads here.

Wasn't too impressed, so I doubt I will be back, but if you don't eat the Pad Kee Mao, chances are you will enjoy the food here.

Fantastic service. Excellent food.  Very affordable.  Terrific menu selection.

It is noteworthy to mention that I have been to all of the other highly rated Thai restaurants in town (e.g. Lotus of Siam, Archie's, Thai BBQ etc.) several times over. They are also very good, but this restaurant stood out in terms of the quality of ingredients.

Dish: Pad Kee Mao.  The first thing I noticed was how fresh the ingredients were.  I literally did not talk the entire time I was eating.  The only time that has happened was during a Kabuki intermission show dinner I had in Tokyo, Japan.  (To this date, that was my best meal ever. )

The owner is very adamant on making this a successful venture. She knows everyone that comes in regularly and wants everyone to have a great experience.  You almost feel as if you're at home.

Highly recommend to anyone. Enjoy.",eYUKuwRXSvdll_7yzLOyGQ,4,5,5,uVxwZl_mjn5Z-20cOTb_9A

5390840,2013-12-20,3,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"This has become a regular visit for lunch for me over the last few months and only two words are to blame for this:   Herbal Salad.

Oh you don't know about Herbal Salad?   If you've ever been to Komol and had the pleasure of trying the version there, then you probably don't need any convincing, but it's a a wonderful combination of veggies, tofu, nuts, fruit, hot pepper and lime juice.  Sounds like the worst health shake combination ever but trust me in salad form it's a delight.   As much as I love Komol it's quite a drive for me from home or work so I dont make it there nearly as often as I'd like, though the herbal salad has made it difficult to stay away.    Well salvation has come in the form of Kinnaree having the exact same dish!   

Some quick background on Kinnaree:  in doing my daily yelp search I saw some positive reviews being thrown their way and figured I needed to try it as I do all Thai restaurants in the area.   Well imagine my surprise when Google Maps led me right to (formerly known as) Lilly's Thai restaurant.   I felt swindled to be honest.   Lilly's was always decent, but not something I ever craved, so I was worried this was simply a name change and that I'd have the same underwhelming experience I felt I'd had in the past.  Then I saw it, written in marker on a chef's special board ""herbal salad"".    Could it be the same as Komols?!  Or was this some mirage and Kinnaree's version would consist of a bowl of ground up Basil, Oregano, and catnip?   I'm happy to report it was the former, and I've since gone back several times to get it take out.

In my 4 times having it so far at Kinnaree, 3 of the 4 times it has rivaled Komol's version, with the perfect amount of spice (5 out of 10 on their scale) balanced out by the sweetness of the coconut and apples.   One time it was drenched with way too much lime juice but thankfully that hasnt been the norm.

I was hesitant to write this review as I was worried a lot of you savages would go and start ordering this dish and make it harder for me to get.   Mark my words the first time I try ordering it and they say they are out, this review is coming down in a flash.   Ya'll owe me on this one!",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,7,4,glvQJXxbv_AVhzH7mYUx6w
5399081,2014-02-12,1,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"I've ordered deliver from here a few times and have noticed a few consistent negatives:
1) The lunch special portions are minuscule. I could understand if it were cheaper than the surrounding Thai restaurants' lunch prices but it's not. 
2) the spice levels are well above most places. I usually eat a moderately spicy red curry yet when i ordered a lever 5 here, i could barely eat it. 

Aside from the above complaints, the food taste and quality is quite good. The pad see ewe was delicious and without it being a lunch special, actually had a decent portion. The red curry chicken is tasty too, just wish there was more of it. I probably won't order from here any more, it's worth more to drive and get take out from pan Asian or Archie's.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,0,3,DDbJiyIpzSJbEUdPcHz8wQ

5588908,2013-07-17,0,FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,"Stumbled on this restaurant by accident. I was trying to find a thai/Vietnamese restaurant that used to be in it's place. Not a big deal, because when I yelped this new restaurant, there was a free eggroll check-in offer! Got to love free stuff..

Anyway, walking in, i noticed that there's a sign for ""2013 best restaurant"". I'm not sure when this place opened, so I'm also not sure if that sticker belonged to the restaurant before it or not. (Both have had great reviews on yelp). The restaurant is quaint. Small but clean. Looks empty, even though there's paintings on the walls.  I'm assuming they're just THAT new. But as I was sitting there, a ton of people came in. Lunch time rush? It looked quite popular. 

To start, I ordered a thai tea. Sweet, yummy, refreshing.. can't really go wrong with thai tea. 

The free egg rolls were pretty standard.. vegetarian egg rolls. They may have been frozen actually.. but I'm not picky.

For my entree I ordered the beef and meatball noodle soup. It was on the lighter side, the broth was clearer than I'm used to for a Thai beef soup. The flavor was not as intense as I was used to either. But it wasn't bad. Just different. It ended up being exactly what I needed as I wasn't feeling so well and wanted something really soupy vs flavorful.  

My boyfriend ordered the fried pork and chinese broccoli. That was REALLY good. The fried pork belly was crunchy and fatty (if you're going to order pork belly, you have to know it's fatty to begin with. So no complaining here!). And the Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. Firm and crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside - al dente. And the flavor was excellent. I think they use some kind of oyster sauce base, but they mixed it well with other flavors to dilute the strong oyster flavor. It's a must try!

Overall, food was good, ambience was okay, and service was great.. I'd come back again.",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,0,0,3,OFeNuZuKoIR8Sv5qphWC8A

My usual Thai restaurant was closed so we've decided to try another place out.

Ordered chicken pad thai and a pineapple fried rice.

Noodle for pad thai was undercooked, it was too chewy and some part was hard. 
They did not ask us for the level of spiciness, just gave us a very sweet pad thai. It was too sweet for me, because I usually have spicy pad thai.
Other than that it was okay.

For the pineapple fried rice, it just tasted like catchup. 
Some might like it, but not for me. I am used to other restaurants' pineapple fried rice which does not taste like catchup at all.
For me it was horrible. 

The decor of the restaurant is outdated. Looks like a local family owned restaurant.  Nothing below or above that. Which I do not mind anyway.

Overall, I would describe the food as...food I get to eat when I go over friend's house. Not extremely good and not awfully bad, but just little different taste than what I usually have. Different style.

Definitely a homemade food taste. If you get what I mean.",v9r86skKbukSYwXDiIGksw,0,0,2,EJvZnVdI6x54S7-dYzHyEg

Perhaps a misnomer, but Thai and Vegetarian is more than vegetarian, it's Thai with vegetarian in mind.  They graciously make available strictly meat and strictly vegetarian menus with all the usual fare.

What makes this establishment so splendid is that its very freshly prepared.  I got an order of egg rolls (courtesy of a Yelp check-in), and the Red Panang curry with tofu.  Both were excellent.  The curry, in particular, left an amazing taste minutes later.

Simplistic in presentation, it's all about the food.
