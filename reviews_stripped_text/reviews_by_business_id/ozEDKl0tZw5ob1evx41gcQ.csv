I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (garbage), the pork was tough and really seemed like yesterday's left overs (after it sat out and got dry), overloaded with a overwhelming bbq sauce that still couldn't mask the flavor of the nasty pork! The fries were good, and me trying to be positive, just figured some cooks have different standards (I wouldn't dare say Chef!).  So that said,  I hadn't seen my mother in a long time, and she seemed to be enjoying her food, so I didn't mention how much I disliked my food (although it was evident after I didn't take more than a couple bites after I had just talked up how much I would like a pulled pork sandwich). The last straw for me was when as we were walking out, our waitress mentions, loudly, to the hostess ""wow they took forever"". I figure she hadn't seen her tip yet, and I probably should have went back and taken it back! but I did nothing as she gave us another sarcastic comment before we left. I will say again, my mother is a regular here so I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable.  I kept my mouth closed, even though I feel we did nothing wrong for sitting there for a couple hours catching up on missed moments.  we bought food, drinks, and tip well..

The reason I don't like this location as much is it seems to always be much more crowded and filled with smoke.  Also the room is more cavernous & less appealing.  They have a separate dining area which is good if you want to get away from the smoke.  Menu items differ somewhat from the other location- you can't get fish tacos here, but you can get some other fat- and cholesterol-laden goodies such as Spicy Mac N' Cheese (with jalapenos).

Guy sitting in the bar had his dog leashed, but was allowing the pup (approx 3-4mo old Husky) to run all around the bar causing several people to trip over the leash or run into the dog. I was one of those people. The guys response after I tripped was simple; He barked at me with an attitude and said ""WATCH OUT!"" When asking around, it turns out that guy was KURT, the owner.

Very classy. The owner allowing his non-service animal to run around in an unsupervised manner in a loud and heavy traffic led bar environment with no care for customer and employee safety. Apparently it was MY fault that his dog was running around the bar. Last I checked, a non-service animal in a restaurant was not in compliance with the Health Department, who I've already contacted and filed a complaint with. As well as both City & County Business Licensing and LVMPD SIS (Liquor Licensing). 

While you may have a good lawyer, ultimately it's your responsibility to keep employees, customers and other guests safe inside of your venue/property. Hopefully your negligence to do so, bad attitude, and shitty disposition disrupts your business and costs you future money. Have some accountability and change your attitude Kurt.

The beer is great! Love it.

As a Craft Brew fanatic, give Big Dog's some credit. It is hard to be a successful craft brewery out here because the water sucks. 

(Water in my opinion is the most important and one of the most outstanding ingredients in beer)

Like stouts? Try theirs. They have a fantastic Light Beer called ""Leg Lifter"" that is a great novice beer to introduce to those that are unfamiliar with craft beer. Let that deter you from greedy beer giants like Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors and become apart of the revolution.


The Packers, I could care less about but they don't scare me away from this place. I recommend this place even to Bear fans. The staff and regular basis seems to be pretty open minded to the barback/buss/support guy who wears a Bears jersey everyday hahahaha.

Wish the bartenders would be a little more passionate about the product. They don't really seem to care to elaborate on their beers to those interested. Let me hear about it man, I know you would probably care more if I put 20 dollars in one of your machines!",D6zI9HS6F7BldafPnJ5amQ,1,0,4,GXgIMllSyU6LMqM0M6n_6w

It always seems clean to me, although we usually sit in the bar area.  I think in the dining room, the booths might be a little worn & springy (not in a good way), although I haven't been back there in a while.

The food is always tasty.  I've never eaten a bad item from the menu and their custom brews are always good.  I like the ""38 special"" which is a mix of their red hydrant ale (a bit to bitter on its own) and their original pale ale.  It's a perfect blend IMO.  They have great burgers and I used to love the Big Dog's salad.

The downside:  Over the past several years, the Big Dog salad got smaller and smaller, even though it went up in price.  It used to be big enough for 2 meals.  Now it's barely filling for 1 meal.  I know that happens all over.  I don't like it...  thumbs down!  The service has also become spotty.  It's kind of a crap-shoot and it can depend where you sit.  I used to like to sit in the bar, on the side by the door, where there's a long row of tables with booth type seats on one side and stools on the other.  I found the service there is way lacking most of the time... it's further from the kitchen.

If I'm in the mood for a beer and a burger out, this is good place to go.

Was there last night, about 10:45 and they only had a ""late night"" menu.  It said served 11pm-8am.  I was expecting the regular menu.  It took a very long time for anyone to acknowledge us.  In fact, we first went to sit in my old favorite spot because the other side was full.  There was a bus boy at a nearby table who didn't even acknowledge us.  I said, ""lets move"" when I noticed tables at the end of the bar, so we'd be a little closer to the action.  That bus boy finally came back to ask if we wanted drinks and said he'd be back with menus (why not show up with menus?).  It actually took a very long time to get menus and we were super hungry.  I considered leaving because it was also taking a VERY long time for our waitress to make her first appearance.  I was concerned it might take forever to get our food, etc.  My guy wanted to stay when he saw her approaching our table.  It was cool, after she took our order she was on it the rest of our visit.  She even brought him another soda when his was only half gone...  nice!

We visited it too last year and had a great time so we were looking forward to it again.  It's a pretty reasonable beer garden.  For $30, you received a glass pint glass and $30 tokens for beer.  This year featured 50 beers to choose from but a majority of them were IPAs or heavier.  I don't mind a super heavy/dark beer once in a while but it's difficult for most people to spend an evening consuming IPAs.  Another thing was that 2 of the lighter beers were out early in the night further limiting the choices.  

Overall it was a good time.  The bands were at a reasonable volume, it was outside, eclectic group of people and a good price for a Saturday night out.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,1,1,4,f9ZCWIHR3cvCMZw307Vs-A

892415,2013-07-10,0,ozEDKl0tZw5ob1evx41gcQ,"The Draft House is very likable. It's the kind of bar you can hang out at for a while. During the day they have the barn open which is a separate restaurant area (especially good for those w/ kids). Food is served day & night, though if you're in there during late night hours, you'll receive a much smaller menu. The staff is exceptional. I haven't had a staff issue yet. They're friendly in the barn, they're friendly around the bar area. The graveyard bartender, Ty, is an especially cool guy. I've seen him running around like crazy when it's slammed & he still manages to keep us from going dry (even when we're sitting at a table away from the bar). The grave Chef is also pretty cool. They do brew their own beer & have a large board showing the current offerings. 

They have certain regular brews as well as seasonal ones that appear from time to time. I will tell you up front - I actually hate beer. I'm truly not that fond of it. I'm a bit jealous of beer drinkers, really. They can just walk into a place & order a drink nice & easy-like. For a mixed drink it all depends on the bartender's skills & for wine, well, most places only stock the cheapest crap (plus it seems pretentious sometimes to try to be ordering wine in some establishments). So yeah, I'm jealous. I will say though, I can drink the beer here & it's pretty good. The best regular brew is certainly Red Hydrant. It goes down pretty easy & works w/ most any food there. The Black Lab Stout's pretty good (not as good as a Guinness, but pretty good) - it goes well w/ some hot chicken fingers. Several of my friends are quite fond of the Leglifter Light. It's a bit too light for me personally but didn't taste bad. Out of the seasonal brews, my favorites are probably the Raspberry Wheat & Cherry Wit. They run out a little too quickly though, so if you see them on the board, you have to try them then. No putting it off until next visit or they'll disappear on you. Rebel Red was another good seasonal one. It's always worth it to check out the board. They actually list beer pairing options on the menu. :)

On to the food - mostly good. 

Garlic fries (smothered in garlic chunks - you'll smell like them for days), cheddar cheese curds w/ both horseradish & ranch sauces, sweet potato fries, chicken fingers - all great stuff. Grandma's Pot Roast Melt is very good - muenster cheese & horseradish sauce w/ au jus! Salads are huge & quite tasty. 

Southwest Melt is tasty - it's a turkey & pepper jack affair w/ avocado (more on this below).  Wisconsin Steak Brat (a ribeye, a brat & mozzarella on a bun) is pretty good though the brat was a little bit salty for me. Fish & chips are decent. Burgers are great - I've discovered that I especially like the sauteed spinach on there. It turns it into a great garlicky gooey mess, but now that I've discovered it, I always get it. The Phillys are good. I especially like the Southwest Philly w/ poblano, pepper jack & avocado (below!) Breakfast foods are tasty as well. 

The other side of things - there can be consistency issues sometimes, particularly between the day & night shifts. Apparently one of the daytime chefs likes to get a little chinzy with things. You'll order a philly that comes out w/ a perfectly respectable amount of meat at nighttime & you might get only 2/3 of that during the day. The avocado is a prime example of this. Ordering on the late night menu, the Southwest Philly will come w/ 2 kinda thin slices of avocado on each half of the sandwich. Not overkill like they're robbing the boss or something, but bun coverage. It's the proper amt when you see the sandwich. Now, order that during the daytime & you just might get only one paper thin slice per half. I once ordered avocado on my burger during the day. It's an extra buck to do so. When it came I got one of the thinnest slices of avocado I had ever seen - and only one, mind you, on this big ol' burger. I was like, really? I paid an extra buck for this? 

Other less than pleasing things: I got the walleye broiled w/ citrus glaze once & it was seriously bland. I might try it one of the other ways that they serve it sometime. I've had the grilled chicken sandwich twice, once during the day & once at night. Both times it was dry & burnt so I dunno what's up w/ that one. Fillet Sliders & the Malibu Turkey Wrap are just ok. The only salad option on the late night menu (I think it's the Southwestern Steak) is just ok. On the late night menu there is some seriously good food, but not if you want to have something lighter. I'd like to see another option or two added for when I don't really want fried food & lots of meat which does happen sometimes. 

So, this place gains a 4 from me primarily for service, atmosphere, & beer selection. Most of the food is good. Much of it is great. Now if they'd just fix the consistency issues & give me some damn avocado during the day when I order it, I could consider bumping them up some more.",5CmusjjrPimBu2HsM2mI9g,1,1,4,D352nmIuyCWrtf9f0FE_wA
913014,2010-09-18,0,ozEDKl0tZw5ob1evx41gcQ,"I come to the Draft House for one thing.  Their beer.  Yes, they have some tasty food, I'll get into that in a second, but their beer is king.  I don't know about their other beers though, as I've only ever had their in-house made ones.  Their IPA is about the best I've ever had, and while I'm a Guinness boy to my core, their stout almost makes me stray.  Their Red Hydrant Ale is also very good, I'd say on par with any good ale out there.  Now, if they could make a Cider I'd be very happy.
Food:  The food is okay, but it's not the best.  Their Cheese Curds are, I'd say, their best option.  You'd think for a Wisconsin bar that things like Nachos would be just dripping with cheese, but you'd be wrong.  Their garlic fried are just regular fried with an epic-crap-ton of raw chopped garlic on top, not so good. 

All in all, I'd come back (and I do!), and I'd definitely tell anyone looking for a good small-brand locally brewed beer to check this place out.",-edQK3gByFewT7g6LnES6g,0,0,3,UgnfqJvVThy5TCKDRaGbTQ

My friends threw a birthday party for me on Saturday night.  They reserved two huge tables behind the bar area.  It was a great turn out....about 25-30 people showed.  My lasting impression is that ""they have done this before"".  Everything was so organized and flowed very well.  As you have seen in previous posts I love to entertain and have big get-togethers and this venue I will highly recommend.

Our waitress Tiffany was really the only one taking orders if I remember right.  Most all orders were individual and you know how that goes.  This chick was amazing.  She kept everything flowing, remembering where everyone was, who order what and kept handing me drinks throughout the night. haha  The bald guy (sorry bald guy-I didnt get your name) kept the tables clean of emplied plates and bottles which is a huge pet peive of mine.  I hugged him at the end of the night because without him the tables would have been a mess.

My boyfriend ordered a select number of appetizers for everyone....nachos, cheese curds, pizza bites and some kind of spinach dip.  All were fabulous bar food.  Someone ordered the pretzel and I am still dreaming about it.....and then someone else ordered the steak sliders.  Yes we will be back for those!  I must!!!

Almost like being home in Wisconsin in terms of the energy and game day atmosphere.  It had been a couple months since I'd gone here and I happened upon a slew of negative reviews.  I had to check it out to see if one of my favorite places in Las Vegas had really fallen apart.  I'm told the other locations had closed and this review does not reflect or comment on that.  That's a business matter for the owners to speak on and not the yelping public.

The menu is the same menu I remember.  I enjoy the cheese curds, Big Dog's salad, and Bratzel quite a bit.  The cheese curds are the closet thing to Wisconsin cheese curds I've had here in Las Vegas.  The Bratzel is a beautiful creation of cheeseburger, bacon and brat.  The big dog's salad is an excellent mexican style salad.  On my most recent visit I had the chicken friend steak.  The chicken fried steak was one of the better renditions of the dish I've had in town.

Seems like a perfect fit for a guy like me, well I was wrong. I have now been into this place on 2 separate occasions and both times I received crummy service. Keep in mind I have yet to try a beer or any food here. First time I went it was so crowded there wasn't anywhere available to sit, so crowded that I couldn't even find a hostess or anyone to help seat us or make sense of the chaos that surrounded us. It was football season so I gave them a pass due to the craziness that is football season. After 5 minutes of looking for help we left.

Well I thought I would give them another shot today and let's just say this is the last time I will ever attempt to eat or drink there. I walked into the bar and showered the patrons inside with the sunlight from outside the bar. A few turned to see who was walking in. I sat down at the bar right in front of the main entrance and made eye contact with 2 of the bartenders. I sat for a couple minutes while 2 of the bartenders walked back in forth in front of me  and finished their orders. I continued to wait patiently for a few more minutes without any acknowledgement. The third bartender was counting her register and was standing 8 feet from me. No ""Hello"" ""welcome to big dogs"" ""can I grab you a beer?"" None of that. Not one word was spoken to me. All I got were side eye looks and no help. 

Maybe this is the way it is here and I'm just a weird outsider who doesn't know the rules or maybe it's just a bar with really crummy customer service. I was really excited about trying some of their in house brews and finding a cool local bar with craft beers that I could call home.

1264250,2016-01-22,1,ozEDKl0tZw5ob1evx41gcQ,"There used to be a bevy of Big Dog's breweries around town. (My favorite was the Holy Cow Casino on the north end of the Strip, where I hit my first--and only--royal flush.) Now there's only one: the Draft House. And while it seems like it's there mainly for gaming, there's also food and drink on the menu.

We've been to the Draft House many times, and when we're there to eat, we usually dine in the restaurant. This time, we decided to sit in the bar, and while the service was excellent, it was so dark that we couldn't read the menu without whipping out my flashlight app.

My husband had the three-cheese burger, with swiss, pepper jack, and provolone. He said it was fine but nothing spectacular. He also swapped his fries for onion rings, which was a good move.

I opted for the cheeseburger pizza, which was topped with ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and onion. Because of the limited light, I didn't notice until I got home that it also was drizzled with some type of sauce (like Thousand Island dressing). This combination was a little odd, and I didn't care much for it hot, but it tasted better cold the next day.

We each had two pints, so we sampled four different beers. We're both usually big fans of IPAs, but both of the IPAs we had were too flowery, and one of those was also a little skunky. The pale ale was not memorable at all, and our favorite of the four (the 44 Magnum) was actually a blend of two of their most popular beers: Dirty Dog IPA and Red Hydrant brown. That was a tasty beverage, and one I'd try again.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable. But overall, I wasn't too impressed with the food or beer. I have had good meals there in the past, and the Magnum was memorable, so I would still recommend the Draft House if you're in the mood for a quick bite and a brew.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,1,3,I3c49VLu04uGA9m3lhGDvg

Seems they have become complacent in their success over the years.  Hopefully, they will figure out it's time to step up their game before it's too late.  I am definitely paring back my visits and exploring new possibilities for my dining dollars.  

Recently ordered the Raspberry Chicken Salad (I've had it at least 20+ times) and was disappointed.  Salad came out wilted and not fresh.  Seemed like it had been prepared in advance, wrapped in plastic with the dressing already applied and put in the cooler.  At least that's the impression I got.  Fewer chicken and pecans than normal.  

A lot of little things add up.  Seems the servers don't do anything extra nowadays.  Sometimes I like to split a salad.  In the past they would separate it onto two plates.  Now, they will bring you an extra plate IF you ask and you can split it yourself.  I recently ordered dessert and the waitress arrived with the cheesecake and queried, ""I see you still have your fork, would you like a new one or do you want to use the one on your plate?"".  Yeah, I want to eat my cheesecake with the same fork with which I just finished my spaghetti.  Are you kidding me???  That's like me asking you, ""Do you want a tip or did you get enough from the last customer?""  The reason I still have the fork and the dinner dishes is because you didn't clear the table yet.

There's a beer cooler near the restaurant entrance that has been broken for at least 3 months.  It has a sign on it apologizing for the inconvenience during the temporary outage.  Hell, if you aren't going to fix it - remove it and put in an extra table.  I'm sure it could be repaired in a couple days.  Loosen up the purse strings man.

They have a impressive selection of both Big Dog brews and guest brews. If you are a craft beer lover this is definitely a great spot to grab a few drinks. 

We started off with the cheese curds due to many recommendations from others. I have to say, these were fantastic! I also tried the beer cheese soup, and it's probably the best cheese soup I've ever had. The the main course I got a rib-eye, with potato cakes and mac and cheese. First, the Rib-eye. The meat was fantastic, great quality, however, I wasn't a huge fan of the rub they put on it. It really hides the quality of the rib eye which I didn't think was necessary. The potato cakes were by far the best thing on the plate, very delicious. The mac and cheese tasted worse than boxed, it had zero flavor and hardly any cheese, definitely pass on that as a side option.

Beers:

I started off by trying their nitro Bourbon barrel stout. I'm not a huge fan of nitro beers, but this one was creamy, had a great whiskey barrel taste with lots of deep coffee notes. Overall, great beer. Next, while I totally despise any Miller, Bud, Coors type beers, I decided to try the Leg lifter Lager. This is by far hands down the best lager I've ever had. It's very crisp and refreshing. In fact, it was so good, I had 2 more. I finished off with their Amber Ale, which was very well balanced, good malt flavor. A very good amber that is brewed to style.

They even have 22 oz's to go in bottles which was a plus. I got 2 of those to go, War Dog IIPA and another Amber.

I've been a few times now and each time the wait staff has been very attentive to us even though we always sit on the patio. My husband and I are always on the look out for places we can bring our black lab Jack along for dinner (we hate leaving him at home). So this place definitely fit the bill! Sometimes however we find if you sit outside the level of service is seriously decreased. That is not the case for Big Dog's! After one of us simply notifies the hostess inside that we'd like to sit on the patio they typically have someone come right out to attend to us. 

I absolutely love that they constantly have new brew lists and highlight not only their own brews, but also plenty of local guest brews. My husband and I are big beer lovers so it's nice to have a place that's open 24 hours so close to home. I've tried a number of their in house beers and have never been disappointed (love their black lab stout, though I may be a little biased!). I've also enjoyed every guest brew I've tried as well. 

Now on to the food, which is absolutely delicious. Seriously. They serve breakfast all day in addition to plenty of bar food and grandma's style cooking. This last time I tried their pot roast, and it was fall of the fork good. Loved every single bite.

The fish tasted very fresh, and they managed to pan fry it without drying it out, so I was pretty stoked. The Sweet Potato fries left something t be desired, they were thin cut waffle fries, so they lost all their sweet potatoes goodness. I tasted the beer cheese soup, even though I don't tolerate dairy, I had to have a bite of someone else's just for a taste of home. It was delicious! Highly recommend if you like dairy. 

Fried Cheese Curds.. even when I lived in Wisconsin, I have always felt frying a cheese curd was sort of a defilement of something beautiful, so I am not a good person to ask if they were any good. But they were there, and others in my party seemed to enjoy them.

Overall, everyone in my group loved their food, and it reminded me of home. I loved walking around inside and seeing all of the Wisconsin Badgers, GB Packers, and Wisconsin license plates. It was all very exciting, I loved it. 

Extra points for having a pet friendly patio and nice waitstaff, and great beer! This was a definite must stop, and I am glad I don't live near enough to go there a lot, because I would get very fat!",nrvUwzLEjPavCVteBpGRig,4,0,4,mxpr-5ykN_vf1_AIt16wYw

We went again yesterday, and the menus were all new.  It seems that the food is the same but some of the prices seem higher.  We probably won't be able to visit as often as a result.

Yesterday my husband had the Tex-Mex burger, which he said was great, and one of my sons had the sliders with onion rings.  I had the pulled pork sliders and sweet potato fries.  

As usual the food came fast, we never had to wait for anything like water.  There was plenty of food and we needed a take-home box.  The stout beer and root beer, both brewed on site, was really nice.  

All of the food was terrific except the sweet potato fries. Last time we had sweet potato fries at the Big Dogs on Sahara, they tasted like sweet potatoes.  This time, at the Draft House, they tasted like nothing except the powdered sugar they sprinkle on top.  They were completely flavorless.  The mustard dip was great, but I was hoping to be able to taste sweet potatoes.  That's the only thing that prevented this from being a five star rating.  I'm sure we'll be back, because we like the place, but I don't think we'll order the sweet potato fries again unless  they make a change there.",-PfcLYFMW9ZXc1DEWSqw-g,2,1,4,fNpVPG4M7Kk4-hilgWbP6Q

It just seems like the kind of place that you can roll up your sleeves and dig into some great food, maybe throw $20 into a video poker machine and relax with some friends over a few pints.

However, the bar staff was ridiculously rude and greedy.  There was one bartender for forty or so guests around a massive bar.  Every time a manager was called to the bar to answer some complaint about service or food or both, they would ask her if she needed help.  She would look around the bar and say ""nah its not so bad"" and then continue to give terrible service.

I ordered some type of brat-burger sandwich creation that I thought was going to save the experience, but it turned out to be a hotdog pretending to be a brat.

We were there on a Friday, and so they had a fish special going on that one in our group enjoyed, it was a member of the 'all you can eat' variety, and he only had one plate.  He was full.

I enjoyed the fish taco's made with walleye.  Very appealing presentation and the sauce was good.

The soft pretzels are good, and great price during happy hour.  The cheese soup, and the nachos with shredded beef are worth a super long workout to negate the calories.

Burgers are good and you can get veggie burgers (Boca patties) even though I don't believe it is listed on the menu.

HAPPY HOUR 4-6PM everyday: 2$ off draft in house brews and some cocktails
I have to agree: THIS PLACE LETS YOU SMOKE INSIDE and it is the first thing that you notice. It is sooooo overwhelming and I swear this was illegal to be smoking inside restaurants, but who know Vegas is all kinds of backwards. This place is and always will be a divey,casual sports bar. Large bar with casino style electronic card games, larger indoor and outdoor seating area which seats easily 200+ people (maybe 150). 
Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5pm. Was seated immediately. First thing I noticed was how cheap the cocktails were esp the MULE style drinks 6-7$: vodka, bourbon, whiskey, tequila styles. DEF RECOMMEND
Also the drafts include an IPA, Stout, Ale, etc. I had the Stout- it was a stout- nothing special- dark and chocolately. 1 glass- 4-6$. 
For food: Cheese curds- 3/5 recommendation. They just seemed like breaded mozzarella sticks and if you don't eat them within 5min, they get super hard and close to inedible. The sauce that came with it was a ranch sauce and then there was this grotesques what I could only describe as: jalapeno, horseradish flavored stuff; At first it was like a creamy taste but then as you swallowed it, there was this sharp bitter flavor. Do not recommended this sauce.  
Next time I come here will def sit outside when it gets a little warmer. THE SMOKE SMELL WAS A HUGE DETERRANT.",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,5,2,3,gU3sxkuNRwsgtmJ_nvOWEw

Looks are totally deceiving and i totally admit to thinking I was too cool to drink beer in a corny place designed to look like a barn. This place is in my backyard,..I can see it from my bathroom window and up until a few month sago avoided it like the plague.

A  few months ago a co-worked coaxed me into meeting her for a few beers here, so I gave in and drove across the street. The first thing I noticed upon entry (since I'm from Chicago) was the sickingly amount of Wisconsin/packers/ badgers signs and memorabilia. Oh great, I thought...not only am I drinking in a barn, but a cheesehead barn...lol (chicago folk loathe all wisconsin teams). Anyhoo... on to the food and drink,  I ordered cheese curds, a tall  tailwagger wheat brew and a full order of nachos..OMG is the food good...and the beer tastes like a midwestern weiss (my fave!) then came the 20 lb plate of nachos, I thought that was a mistake or a joke, the full plate of nachos could seriously feed 6 people. Then the bill came..surprise, SUPER CHEAP.

So now I absolutely love this place and eat & drink here at least once a week. My newest addiction here is the potroast sandwich. I LOVE this place...if you haven't tried Draft House , you don't know what your missing.",qx1uxK4c_AxQU3EkdEtQTw,6,2,5,FXxi65mzP92Pr-zTrxPcBg

Being a Cheesehead that's a PLUS.  However the Dirty Dog IPA is top notch for sure.  Not only does it have a decent Alc % but the flavor was very hoppy and flavorful but had a very smooth finish.  I am not sure the IBU on that beer and I do not think they had it posted but this beer was very easy to drink.  By the looks of the beer menu Big Dog's had over a half dozen beer's made in house from all varietals of beer styles.  

Food menu had some great choices of hearty stick to your bones dinners like Pot Roast.  Also to choose from were a great selection of burgers patty melts and Wisconsin's finest sausages from Klements and Johnsonville Brats.  I will be definitely trying one of these on my next visit.  Reading the menu I can envision a pile of gut busting goodness of grilled onions, peppers and links slathered in mustard.  Ah, but we will conquer this dish next time.  I chose the ""Draft House"" burger which came out of the kitchen quickly and cooked to a perfect and juicy medium just like I requested.  I paired this monster with the waffle cut sweet potato fries that came out dusted with powdered sugar.  This burger was no Joke! I am sure it was a 1/2 lb with cheddar with thick cut crisp bacon, LTO and grilled mushrooms.  Awesome!.  That burger was no match for me that day.  

You can look at the magic happening while they are making the beer from inside the bar area with the windows looking right at the fermentation tanks. Big Dog's has several seating areas including a bar, restaurant and patio area.  During football season it is almost impossible to find an empty seat in the Dog House.  Packer fans come out in droves to support their team and sip pints of Big Dog Brews.  Once in a while they host a beer festival on property showcasing all of their fine Suds.  Big Dogs is a must try on my list of Brewhouse stops in Las Vegas.  I recommend visiting on a Sunday while football season is in full swing for an amazing fanatic experience.

We all loved this place, including youngest child (who is very particular). My husband did his homework, and we ended up here. 

Cheese curds- ridiculous. I need these in my life more often.

Husband- Brewer's Sandwich. Bratwurst, another type of sausage, grilled onions, sauerkraut. (I told him he was going to have to get himself his own hotel room.)

Oldest daughter- cheeseburger, lots and lots of water, and a house brewed root beer. 

Youngest daughter- kids' mac & cheese (Kraft from the box, but she loved it).

Me- the Cheesehead burger. Being a huge Packer fan, I had to get this. 

And, speaking of the Packers, this restaurant/ brewery is full of Wisconsin paraphernalia, but more importantly, it's full of Packer stuff!

Now, the beers. Dirty Dog IPA, delish. Double Down (double) IPA- delish. Husband got the Double Down, but it's a 9% beer, so I only had a sip. We did get a flight also- cream ale, Imperial IPA, double IPA, stout, and a peach. The cream and peach were okay with, but the other three beers in the flight were wonderful.

Service here rocks. I never sat at the bar, but always at a table next to it. I've had a few different waitresses, all superb.

If you're looking for somewhere with a large variety to satisfy a group of people this is a good choice. They have a beer list that includes their own brews as well as guest taps and the standards. They had 3-4 sours on tap the day we went in. The restaurant is very dark, especially near the entrance. There's a huge bar in the center and a more formal dining room towards the back. They also have shuffleboard, Big Buck Hunter, jukebox, and plenty of TVs. I saw a group that had just finished a tour of the brewery so I guess they do that too. 

I had the ""Ultimate Wisconsin"" grilled cheese. There was a ton of bacon in this, making it extraaa greasy. I was not a fan of the sundried tomatoes. They were really hard so if you bit into one you had to pull the whole thing out and eat it or set it aside. Fresh tomatoes would have been a better choice. My coworkers agreed their meals weren't anything special either (pot roast sandwich, philly cheese steak and patty melt). The food is nothing special.

When we arrived we were prepared to leave but decided to see what the wait time would be... hostess said it would be 20 to 30 minutes due to a family of 11 before us ( I mentally added 10 minutes for the just in case ) so we decided to since it would take about the same amount of time to go somewhere else & eat we chose to stay. After 45 minutes and at least 4 - 5 other parties being seated before us when I inquired with the manager was told that we she didn't have a table big enough for 6. Once seated the busser was prompt in taking our drink order & he was quick to get them, we ordered an appetizer at that time with him, the waitress finally came by our table to let us know she had put that order in and it would be out shortly we did not get the opportunity to tell her we were ready to order so we had to wait another 20 minutes for het to come & to  take our order. All total it took 30 minutes in between ordering & getting food orders. Did not get refills on drinks. Food was not the best ( have had worse but have had much better ). By the time we were ready to leave I had to go track down the manager to get our ticket to pay. She did apologize for making us wait to be seated & did discount the meal ( which was considerate of her ). I did tip the server but if she would have been as attentive to us as she had been the big table seated after us her tip would have been better. When it is busy we do take into consideration when evaluating our service that we receive and do try to be patient, unfortunately even keeping those things in mind and have been loyal customers of Big Dogs in the past I am sorry to say that dinner today has fallen way short of what we used to have.

3333654,2016-01-02,0,ozEDKl0tZw5ob1evx41gcQ,"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I came to Big Dog's half because I like trying new beers and half because they were hosting trivia.  The trivia side of this post will be short because it was not great.  They segregated the trivia player's into a corner of the restaurant and the acoustics were just awful.  You could barely hear the questions and the area had about 8 tables pushed together so there wasn't much room.

Still, the main review is about the beer.  I did not have food, but i certainly tried some beer.  Bg Dog's has the most extensive selection of self-brewed beer in the city.  Their Big Dog IPA is very highly regarded (I concur), and their imperial stout is actually very underrated (and very high in alcohol content) as well.  

For the beer, please come to Big Dog's.  They usually have some deals with some of their beers and give them great sales prices for the night.  They also have many guest taps in the restaurant.  The beer selection is actually quite good in terms of numbers because Big Dog's brews about 20 beers, in addition to the 10-15 guest taps.

My biggest complaint is that they do not put prices on their beer list.  If you ask they will tell you the price (they said most were between $5-$7) but one of my biggest pet peeves at bars is when they omit the price so that deducted a star on its own.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,EqzeHpo0tk7uqYPKMw1YCQ

It was kind of late so the restaurant area was closed. I HATE sitting at barstools, but they had this weird sort of option of sitting on really tall padded benches against the wall. Slightly more comfortable, but the Anaconda said he felt like a little kid with his feet dangling.

Got the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato waffle fries. Burger was well cooked and tasty, and the hot, crispy fries came with a thin, sweet dipping sauce that went perfectly. Baby Sis got a house specialty sandwich with bratwurst. She said it was good but I can't personally attest since I didn't actually get a bite. She never was good at sharing.

Service was fine- friendly staff who seemed a little overworked. Pleasant vibe- they played a lot of classic rock mixed with country hits which seemed to cover the customer base pretty well. (About half of which were chatting and happy while the others were hunched over the video poker machines in their own private hell. I feel your pain.)

Now for the part that, for me, lost them their fourth star, but ironically, made the Anaconda and Baby Sis want to give them 5: they let you smoke at the #@$! table! WTF!  Am I the only one who recalls a law passed not that long ago that prohibited smoking in food service areas? What the hell ever happened to that??!!

I had the Draft House burger with garlic fries. It was to die for. The burger was juicy, drippy, and perfect. Slathered with two huge pieces of applewood smoked bacon, carmelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms, it was a huge success. The best part was the melty, gooey cheddar cheese. I can't say enough about how amazing this burger was.

My husband had the green ghost burger. It came with avocado and ghost pepper jack cheese. It had a substantial kick, and definitely hit the spot. We decided that combining the two; a Draft House burger with jalapenos added would be the ultimate success. 

Garlic fries were garlic-y and delicious, perfectly crispy.

I'm not currently drinking, due to health reasons, but I tried their home-brewed root beer and it was divine. I almost took a growler home of it.

Went here on a Tuesday (Ribs night!) with some friends. No ready seating at the bar so they seated us in bar overflow. I thought this was going to be BS because we were not in the bar. Not so, the bar overflow is open and adjacent to the bar, features a large quantity of sports-tuned televisions, and has a waitress bringing you their glorious beer so all was well.

Food: Had the 9.99 ribs and fries. Really decent for a non-rib joint. Spectacular at 9.99 and consistent with the food I've had before- nothing exceptional just really well done classics and unusually good fish choices. This is not a gastropub, but that doesn't mean you won't leave happy and full. Prices are solid.

Beer: These guys make the best beer in Vegas. The brewery is on site and they actually have quite a lot of great Big Dog beer on tap here at all time. Considering the size of the operation they must run those things night and day. The guest taps are also spectacular: well chosen regional standouts and usually on tap. They also regularly have gatherings for new beer releases and they have consistent enough quality to make the trip always worth it.

Service: our waitress Shannon did something I have yet to behold here in Las Vegas. She split our check, and not only that, she did it happily, voluntarily, and without us asking in advance. I had not seen the like since I was in the Midwest (why is it they hate splitting checks out here?) She was great otherwise, but this was top notch. 

Pro-tip: If you come here in a Bears Jersey they're probably going to take you to the back and play ""Abu Ghraib"" with you. Otherwise an amazing place to watch a football, especially a Packers game.",H7fr4A3OlKtDr-sNn8BIlw,1,0,5,rVei-jOWY1os0JeUOGF13Q

Brought Mom's with me for our traditional Sunday lunch....we were staving and couldn't wait to get seated.  The Draft House is a Green Bay Packers Bar.....so it was packed with Packer Fans on the bar side....not one available seat or table.  It was 3 pm and the Packers vs Vikings game wasn't for another 2 hrs, but it was packed to the hilt!  We got seated in the dining room area, our server wes named Apple, seriously.

After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we asked Apple if there were any specials....she proceeded to tell us about a bunch of Appetizer Specials ($2 off) and $2 off for the War Dog during the NFL Games, so we took her up on it.  We ordered:

- 1/2 Order of Nachos $7.50
- Bratwurst $3.50
- Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels $5
- NFL Hot Wings (10 Wings) w/Chipotle Sauce....their hottest Wing Sauce $6

To wash it down, we both ordered Water and I of course ordered a 24 oz War Dog!  ($7.50, $5.50 with the special) The War Dog was freakin' awesome.....not as Hoppy as I expected based on @Dan P's report, but it was very good.

After a short wait, we got our food....Nachos first.  Mom and I attacked those Nachos.  They were pretty good....topped with Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole, Olives, Jalapenos, Salsa, and Onions.

Next up was the NFL Wings.....I jumped on those next....damn, they were awesome!  Very Meaty Wings.....the Chipotle Sauce was just right....had that Smoky flavor and was just Spicy enough for me and Mom.  The Ranch given to us for dipping went well with the Wings.

They brought out my Bratwurst next.....I added some Mustard and Relish and went to town on it.  It came with grilled Onions topped on the Bratwurst.  It was pretty good....although the Bun wasn't all that.  I would have preferred a Roll or Italian Bread instead of a Hot Dog Bun.

The last item to come out was the Jalapeno Stuffed Pretzels.....they were piping hot and moist and doughy.....delish!  They came with a side of Nacho Cheese for dipping.

It was at this point that Mom and I figured out that we ordered too much food.  I wasn't going to let this place defeat me though, so I pressed on.  Mom said she'd finish the Nachos and I would handle whatever was left of the Wings & Pretzels.

We took our time watching the Seahawks vs Cardinals game and finished our food and Beer.

When Apple delivered our check she said she made a mistake and gave us the food specials for Monday Night Football, not Sunday....but that the restaurant was going to honor the specials anyway because of the mistake....is that great service or what?

Overall, great food & great service.

A comfortable, casual ambience prevails here. No need to get all dressed up, come as you are anytime.

The owners of Big Dog's Draft House on Rancho Drive originally hail from Wisconsin (just like me) and have been in Southern Nevada for many years now. 

They used to have a small brewery on the Las Vegas Strip called the Holy Cow Casino and Brewery many years ago. I still remember the coupons for free pint glasses of their pumpkin beer.

The likely German ancestry of the owners may explain the delectable, reasonably priced morsels that are always available here including bratwurst, an abundant variety of oversize sandwiches, diverse entrees, mouth-watering deserts, beers and much more. 

The available food specials in the evening hours change by the day of the week, the season of the year and the owners' preferences or inspiration. 

All you can eat seafood items such as shrimp, fish and the like are a recurrent then as are annual beer festivals such as the Summer Beer Fest and Peace, Love and Hoppy-ness which always draw a crowd due to their very reasonable pricing.

This location is also just a hop, skip and a jump from other fast-food options such as a Fatburger, Wendy's, Arby's and more. But if you are at the one and only Big Dog's Draft House, you'd truly be a fool to go anywhere else!",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,5,VtBOwfMgr2OS-87JGdq8vA

Speaking for now, I consider it to be my ""home"" bar and rarely have an experience that's not positive.

The beer here is phenomenal, and they always have a great selection of craft brews that they make on site. No matter what you're in the mood for, there's always something there you'll like.

The food is almost always good. A lot of standard American fare, with some Wisconsin style dishes like their fried cheese curds (mandatory whenever you go there) and walleye. Their burgers are always great, as is pretty much anything else you get there. The only thing I've eaten there in recent memory that didn't really get my approval was their prime rib, which was very....okay. That's not a normal thing on the menu though.

Service also generally good, especially if Emily serves you. She's one of the best out there and will always make sure you're well taken care of. The other servers there are also mostly good, though some occasionally disappear for longer than you'd like leaving dry glasses when you want another round.

The environment is very welcoming and down to earth, but by no means trashy or low budget. Being a Wisconsin bar, there's tons of Green Bay stuff decorating the walls. If you're a Bears or Vikings fan, you have been warned. In terms of smoke, you'll come out of the place smelling like it, but there are plenty of air filters installed so you never feel like you're in a smokey bar.

Lately there's some points against it in that it's been extremely crowded as of late (can't really fault them for success, but as a patron it's a pain), and they've also installed a jukebox which means being subjected to loud, crappy music whereas they've always played classic rock and other quality tunes there (some of which is actually fairly obscure, so a music nut like me would jump for joy when you'd hear an old 70's progressive rock tune that you'd never hear on the radio).

-Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.

-Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.

-Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.

-Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.  Their burgers are stacked, juicy, and affordable. 

I never expect much at Big Dog's because the prices are cheap and it's basically pub food.  Portions are big and there's still enough on the menu for everybody.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,7,6,4,HqrPOqlc5Hr08A8LcC4ckA

So, since my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to try it for lunch around 3PM. We got lost on the way there. For some reason, the address on GPS took us to the residential area behind the Draft House. Anyway, not really a big problem, just had to drive around the block. 

So, we were greeted and sat in the dining hall. It had a super ""homey"" feel to it with all the barn house decor. I loved it. It looked like there was one waitress that was managing the few tables that were in there during that time. She was very nice and helpful in deciding what we wanted to order. She also checked on us appropriately and gave us information about their rewards program. The food took a little longer than expected to arrive, but that wasn't a problem since we were killing time, anyway. 

I ordered a beer flight, Wisconsin beer cheese soup, and lobster mac-n-cheese. All were phenomenal. Let's talk about the beer cheese soup. It was literally one of the best soups I've ever tasted. SO good. My boyfriend and I were fighting over the last spoon-full. I would come back for this soup alone. We are still talking about it a day later.

Mac-n-cheese is actually a lot more difficult to perfect than one would think. It's not just noodles and cheese. This place did it right. I opted to add the smoked ghost pepper jack cheese to my dish. It was the right move. I love anything spicy, so it added the perfect flavor to the pasta. There were only a select few pieces of lobster that I could find in my dish, but that didn't detract from the meal. 

The beer flight was really good. I had a hard time choosing my favorite beer. Usually, in a flight, there is at least one beer that you know you don't like. I liked them all in this flight. The flights also came in this really cool swirl holder. Definite points for presentation. 

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the entire meal. I will be back, for sure. My only complaint is that it's a bit far from my house! Thanks for great service and amazing food!",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,1,0,5,7hyG3Il87JYTo__OrnCQYA

I had ordered Hefeweizen beer, red bean soup and sliders that seemed like a good idea at the time. Everything was great until my mini burgers turned into a cheese nightmare...seriously. 

When the sliders came out they were cold, overdone and the cheese wasn't melted, which made for crappy tasting sliders. I politely asked my waitress if she could just warm them up a bit so the cheese could melt and she didn't seem too thrilled about it.

The second time around the sliders came out with melted cheese.... but this time they had tripled the amount of cheese which I didn't ask for and it was just gross. At this point I could continue with what will end up a rant review so I'll just get to the point.

In a medium size nutshell my bill came to $29 tip not included in calculation for cold food, slow and poor service from waitress and management. So this experience for me means it will have to take a miracle for me to come back.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,2,2,2,Z6OLlEUSHevZ8YshDKIEIQ

In all honesty I was a tad bit disappointed with several parts of the visit.  Although I intend to give this place another try in the future; this initial review is only 3 stars.

Positives
1) Beer selection is robust and includes a large selection of beers brewed on sight.  I tried their triple IPA and it was outstanding; beware of the high ABV though, my goodness I think it was close to 12%!  Our party also tried their Hefeweizen and pale ale and were pleased with the flavor and finish.
2) Food menu is outstanding and has options from Fish & Chips to sandwiches to burgers to pizza.  I recommend the Mac N Cheese with Sausage, simply incredible.  Also recommend the pastrami burger and Italian grilled cheese sandwich which was like a pizza!  They have build your own burger and pizza options to allow you to customize your order, always awesome to have that!
3) Outdoor patio seating is available and I recommend this weather permitting due to the smoke on the inside of the bar area.

Negatives
1) Although there is a smoke free dining room, the smell of smoke was still prevalent.  With my wife being an ex-smoker this was difficult to enjoy the experience.  Similar to casinos with smoke free areas, people walking through a smoky bar will undoubtedly bring some of that smell with them.
2) Service was underwhelming.  It took more than 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us once we entered and waited by the host stand.  Again standing in this area was smoky and uncomfortable.  Once seated it took another 5 minutes for our party to be offered a drink and obtaining refills was inconsistent.  On a positive note the server recommended menu items and all of the suggestions were on the money!
3) Decor is a bit dated.  The place has a Wisconsin theme and is apparently a rabid base for Packer & Badger fans during football season.  I could have done without the plastic ducks hanging from the ceiling.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,1,0,3,7YnDPrBoc2TJpcUKCQHBVw

Lo and behold, my first attempt to submit a review by phone, and it went missing, including the draft.  Unlike the meal we had, which settled nicely into our stomachs, the review is floating somewhere in cyberspace.  A re-enactment follows.

It's been several years since we were at the Big Dog's on Rancho, long before my Yelp residency, and I didn't recognize it.  It was conveniently right across the street from the Lumber Liquidators that we'd just been to, so a welcome excuse to avoid cooking dinner was inviting us to cross the street.  Alas, we were about 10 minutes too late for Happy Hour, so we had to order off the regular menu.  Not such a bad thing, since we had a fabulous meal.

After quenching my thirst on my fave, Angry Orchard Cider on tap, I ordered the Southwest Turkey Melt, and Mr. G got the Pecan Crusted Walleye.  My sandwich was absolutely the best, full of stuff, including excellent turkey, and grilled just right.  Normally I wouldn't even have tasted the Walleye, since I try to avoid fried foods. (No, I didn't get fries with my sangwich).  But this one was pecan crusted; mention a nut and I go nuts, so I just had to sample it.  If I weren't so full from my sandwich, I would have inhaled every piece of walleye on that plate.  It was that good!

Service was exceptional: friendly, helpful and mostly prompt, amazing considering it was a weeknight and the place was jammed.

FOOD/DRINKS:
     Ordered a beer that was on their menu, and written on their chalkboard - they didn't have anymore of that kind. Ordered another beer, that they had a photo/sign of in their bar, but they didn't carry that one. So I ordered a sampler of what beers, they did have, and that they brewed. Beer was good.

     Ordered buffalo wings, buffalo chicken strips, and Nachos. The food came out in decent time, the buffalo wings were actually better than expected but the onion rings were on the ""soggy"" side. The chicken strips were a bit under-par, and the nachos were actually good in size and good in quality. 

SERVICE:

The first time I went was for their War Dog tapping party. I actually had another anti-teetotalism gathering at the Freakin' Frog that night. But I had always wanted to try Big Dog's, so I did the mini-road trip from work (near McCarran) all the way up to the great northwest. I was hoping to get there in time for a free appetizer, but that didn't work out. I ended up just getting my free pint of War Dog and leaving. Let me just say that the War Dog IPA is delicious.

By the way, I then turned around and made another mini-road trip back down south to the Freakin' Frog to meet up with my friends. Ken M says I deserve a beer badge for making that beer venue combo in one night.

My second visit to Big Dog's was for their Winterfest. Great event. I went with the 30-token + tasting glass starter pack for $30. I really didn't drink that much beer. My 30 tokens got me the following:

* Half pour of Big Dog's Raspberry Brewbie SupPorter. Yeah this was more like a full pour. Very tasty and part of the proceeds went toward the Keep a Breast Foundation.
* Quarter pour of New Belgium's La Folie Sour Brown Ale. Despite it's supposed ""limited quantity,"" they gave me more like a half pour. Not complaining! This was extremely sour, kind of like Sour Warheads. It was worth trying, but not sure if I'd ever order it at a bar.
* Half pour of Big Dog's Doghouse Dunkelweizen. Didn't like this all that much.
* Half pour of Deschutes' Hop in the Dark Cascadian Pale Ale. Absolutely delicious! Probably my favorite beer of the afternoon.
* 2 bowls of Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. Obviously delicious, since I went back for seconds.
* 1 bowl of Chile Verde. Good flavor and spice.
* 2 Oyster Shooters. Made with Black Lab Stout. Surprisingly delicious.

So I have yet to go to Big Dog's for a non-event. I definitely will return one day though. I still need to try their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds (and compare them to Aces & Ales).

Oh and I love that it's a Packers bar. I'm not a huge Packers fan, but it would be fun to catch a game there maybe next season.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,6,4,5,bjEqCLJB4SGuWYLNmiSfqA

I arrived at 7:00pm to meet a party that had been at Big Dog's Draft House since 4:30. Upon meeting our party, my husband and I were informed that the rest of the group had been waiting for their ""Green Beers"" for over 20 minutes. My husband went inside to order at the bar, while I sat at our table on the patio. While I waited, others in my party beckoned our server, Lisa, several times, each time being told ""you are my next table."" During this time we watched Lisa serve the two tables nearest us repeatedly. Before Lisa finally arrived to take our orders, Sam, who appeared to be a busser, unwillingly took our orders. I ordered four drinks and a side of fries. One of the drinks and the fries I ordered arrived within 10 minutes (none of the other orders ever arrived). We continued to wait for the remainder of our order for the next 42 minutes. Finally, we decided that enough was enough and flagged down another server to get our check. After carefully looking over our tab, we noticed that we were charged for two items that did not belong to us. It took several additional minutes to reconcile the bill. 

Ultimately, after sitting idle for more than an hour we requested to speak to a manager. Patty arrived at our table and heard our complaints. After a long wait, we were able to close our tab. Patty returned to our table with three gift cards for $15 each. 

Big Dog's Draft House gets 1 star for their deliberately POOR service. And, 1 star for their attempt to appease us with gift cards.",onC96DPbXANdLvbY-hfbMA,1,1,2,SKEwatWXdw9uFxcTwgtHqA

In Las Vegas, there are so many restaurants, it's kind of overwhelming. The pics for Big Dogs Draft house looked AMAZING! Sadly, that's where the amazement ended. My pictures look great as well. As far as the taste of the food? It left much to be desired. I will say the Pastrami burger that my son got was very, very good. But my chicken and artichoke Mac and cheese was not amazing. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese. The flavor just wasnt there. I can't remember now what cheeses is said it had, gruyere was one, but it sounded great! Didn't taste that way. I think I found 2 chunks of artichoke in the whole thing. Just so-so overall. Would not order again. My husband ordered a steak. It had AWESOME steak flavor... But I seriously think they forgot to season it!! I'm not kidding!! There was no salt on it, and I use salt very, very sparingly!!  It doesn't taste the same when you add salt after the fact... Again super disappointing for a $24 steak dinner. 
We ordered: 
Pastrami burger
Kids pizza meal with drink
Chicken Mac and cheese
Steak with 2 sides

The sticky garlic wings were also good, but didn't pack much garlic flavor.  I'd recommend asking for extra sauce. Still a good, crispy wing though

Btw, it was a very unfair ending, so if you decide to comment on this review, please do not say anything about this game.  It's kind of a sore subject. LOL.

When you drive up you're greeted with a couple of unforgettable pieces.  First is the huge house shaped sign that welcomes you to the joint.  On the way in, there's also a very large dog statue with a sign that says, ""do not climb on dog."" They shouldn't have put that there.  Later in the evening, our curiosity prompted us to ask the server to climb the dog.  When we got the 'good to go,' we literally took a thousand pictures on that statue.  Awesome.  The inside is pretty huge.  It actually reminds me of a local pub in Wisconsin.  Pictures, awards, Wisconsin shaped everything!  The bar is definitely the center piece of the establishment.  It takes up 50% of the joint.  TV's everywhere make it easy keep track of the game.  The staff was super nice.  Our server was on point.  She really made us feel at home.  I loved the ambiance.  Totally my kind of place!

The cool thing is the fact that they have a line of their own signature brewskis.  We got a total of 4 pitchers of the Leglifter Light.  This American style light lager alternative is mild in flavor and super refreshing.  With only 4% ABV (alcohol by volume), it is sure to keep you going throughout the game.  For our food, we started off with the Wisconsin Cheese Curds for $10.  It's white cheddar cheese curds, breaded and fried golden. Served with homemade dill horseradish sauce & ranch dressing for dipping.  Man, this was good!  If you like cheese, you will love this!  The breading was crunchy and flavorful.  Curds were perfectly salty.  We also got the full order of Doghouse Nachos for $14.00.  Chips with cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños, olives, sour cream, scallions, salsa & guacamole.  This bite reminded me of stadium nachos.  Nothing special, cheese from a can.  Lastly, we got the Chicken Wings for $9.00.  It's served with celery and carrots. You can choose to have the wings plain, BBQ, medium, hot, spicy chipotle or honey hot.  We asked for half BBQ and half medium.  The wing was crispy and perfectly fried.  The mild sauce was my favorite.  The actual sauce didn't seem to over power the wing and really showcased the chicken taste.  The BBQ, on the other hand, seemed to really over power the wing for me.  Super sweet flavor. If they used a little less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more.  

After all brews and food, our bill was $80 for 4 people.  That's a deal.  It's definitely a far drive, however, it is Packers/Badgers season.  It's time to man up and return there for game time.

Part of the reason why it was comfortable to be here is the night time staff was friendly and attentive. We sat in our usual table and even though the bartender was stuck behind a bar he still walked over and asked periodically if we're still doing alright.

 The BF and I went in and there was a bunch of new staff. We walked up to the bar to order to go last week since we didn't feel like hanging out and having beers. The bartender and the bar back ignored us a good 5-10 or so minutes even though they were not busy. They were even having a conversation directly in front of us and ignoring that I'm looking right at them. I was just sitting there like WTF? and debating on leaving if another 5 more minutes elapse.

 There was a girl who seemed to have come up to the computer to check something (she was on her break) and she stopped midway walking away and asked if we needed something since I probably looked cranky sitting there. She put in our ticket and put the check in front of us. I put my card and the whole time the bartender never acknowledged us, never came by to take my card. He's even joking around and dancing to the music, but no time to payout my bill. 

Even when our food was ready, he just handed us the bag. My bill still wasn't paid because he didn't want to take it the 20 minutes I was there waiting for my order. Good thing I'm a honest person so I waved my card to be taken instead of cheesing it. Then he went to the computer and rang up 2 other people first, gave them all their papers before getting to me who was the only to-go order needing to get home before my food gets cold. 

Ugh, I surely hope this guy isn't the new regular night bartender because he doesn't know how to time manage nor the A,B,Cs of service. If the next time I come in and it's the same guy and none of the waitresses are working, I'm walking back out.

Unfortunately, I came on the wrong day; they were out of the first FOUR beers I ordered -- the pale ale, Red Hydrant, Dirty Dog IPA, and 38 Special. Finally, I had the waitress tell me what she DID have, so she went off to the bar, and came back with a recommendation of a rye ale, which I ordered. It was probably the best fifth choice I've ever had. Apparently, Big Dog's had taken part in some sort of craft beer festival the day prior, and ran out of all of their beers there.

For food, I had the sliders, which were okay; nothing special about them, and no reason to order them again.

Our waitress (sorry, can't remember her name) seemed to want to do a good job, but also had a bit of a deer-in-the-headlights look about her. I envisioned that she had recently been in some sort of white-collar industry, and had not been waiting tables for very long.

The place was very loud inside (there was a big game on, so rightfully so).

The beer selection was pretty darn good! Quite a lot of people left once the storm took over, so once the rain and wind died down, there was more beer for the rest of us!

I liked that it was basically a free event if you weren't drinking. You could buy a mug and tokens as you went, or you could buy a large amount of tokens. It was well organized and I may just make it back next year!

In the past two years, just about every Monday night when we are in Las Vegas--which is most weeks of the year--and sometimes on other nights as well.  We were big fans of its long gone sibling situated on the Strip across from the Sahara Hotel & Casino where SLS now stands: Holy Cow, and its fresh Walleye Pike flown in from Wisconsin.  So it was an easy jump for us to enjoy more of the same here--along with plump Pan-fried Pot Stickers so good that they do not taste in the least frozen.  And every time I have tried something new I have not been disappointed.  So my other staples are now the best Beef Stroganoff in town, a tangy Pulled Pork Sandwich, and a memorable Holy Cow! Reuben.

But until last night I had never before sampled a hamburger here, even though I have heard great praise for them.  To take it up a notch, for my first burger I opted for The Bratzel, a 1/3 pound hamburger patty conjoined under a Pretzel Bun with a juicy butterflied Klement's Smoked Bratwurst, along with strips of Applewood Smoked Bacon, slices of tomato, Cheddar and Swiss Cheese, fried sweet onions, and some lettuce.  After adding some mild yellow mustard and ketchup to my medium-rare burger, and I was in for a real treat--even though I could barely get my mouth around the whole concoction.  The brat inside was juicy, just like the great Kosher Dill Pickle slice that was impaled by a steak knife on top of it.  As always, French Fries, too, were first rate.  And the flavor of the Pretzel Bread fortunately did not overpower the taste of the meats contained within.  This is a heavy meat eater's nirvana, and I'm glad I finally became intimately acquainted with it.

Once again service by our server Maria M. was friendly, efficient, and exemplary; and every ordered dish brought out from the kitchen made precisely to order, and of the same consistent high quality as experienced on previous visits.  This is truly a beacon of fine comfort food in the Las Vegas valley.

They have a bar area and a dinning area.  If I wasn't a Vikings fan, this place would have 5 stars.",1kbHR5IroDiZD0npir8OLw,1,1,4,ORFzRiq8hWFkiNT6dRje1Q

All proceeds from $5 pints were donated. The event was very busy and they had a tent outside where 4 of the beers were available. Lots of Nevada breweries donated to the event, which was incredible! I was happy to support the cause and the amazing variety of brews (25 total) was not to be missed! 

Big Dogs is a nice enough place, and a huge place, with a lot of hustle on the part of the employees. The bar is very big and probably always pretty smoky, as it is a gaming bar. Fun tidbit- Big Dogs has 35 machines, which according to their Web site are ""grandfathered in"". I assume that having 35 machines is no longer permitted in taverns. The decor is welcoming and eclectic. The skee ball machine near the patio entrance caught my eye, and I would definitely try it out if I return. 

I placed a to go order at the bar and wasn't given a wait time. Instead of waiting at the bar, I went outside to wait near the patio. A server tracked me down with my order quicker than I anticipated it would be ready, considering the crowd inside. I had the green muenster grilled cheese with bacon, green chiles and avocado. Way too many chiles! It was basically a chile sandwich with not enough cheese. It tasted fine, but I was disappointed that their grilled cheese sandwich was lacking cheese. And the bread was a little burned. Doh!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,7,4,3,QtSvlikzCVbASm4Uzk1q3A

5910958,2018-03-10,1,ozEDKl0tZw5ob1evx41gcQ,My boyfriend and I went there today around 2:30 pm and sat at the bar.  It took a while for the female bartender to even come over and get our drink order. She never came back to get our food order so we had to ask one of the servers to take our food order.  When the food finally came out which seemed like forever the fries were cold and the food was just OK.  We definitely do not plan on going back anytime soon.  Bad service and just OK food.,VUd2z2WjOp1w_xiIA2vBfg,0,0,1,JyUlHHvHjx5jOPM2WSZxsw
5921137,2017-04-13,0,ozEDKl0tZw5ob1evx41gcQ,This is my least favorite dining experience in my three years in Vegas. Service was sooooooo slooow. Didn't get waters with our beers. Asked for to-go boxes then had to ask for check after that. Food was mediocre. I got the smoked mac and cheese. Flavor was ok but tasted like velveeta cheese sauce and noodles were over cooked. Fried cheese curds were good! You can smoke in part of the restaurant but the smell carries to the non-smoking section. There was a art print on the wall at our table and it looks like there were several food fights ages ago. Needs to be wiped off like the table. Had a house stout that was the highlight.,FfbI9vkkQWBOZfww6_nuOQ,0,0,2,erG_mqEfNXNXPOPrZ1XTug
