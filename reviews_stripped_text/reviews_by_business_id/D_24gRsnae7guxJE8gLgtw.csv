Ube flan cupcake, flan that sits on top is decent. The cupcake it's self is not so great. Consistency is like play doh and not that far from tasting like it too.

Crack ube cheesecake is better. True cheesecake texture with mild ube flavor and the ""crack"" part is like a salty butter cookie crust/topping.

Halo Halo Bread Pudding with Ube Ice Cream- dreamy!

Halo Halo Drink - uniquely made and wish I could finish it in one sitting. 
Grilled Cheese- Sourdough bread goodness with the right amount of cheese, served with chips.

Location is perfect as it's not too far from my house. But they've got quite a few ""opening"" kinks to work out.

My sister and I went on a Saturday afternoon and as one can imagine, they were fairly busy. They only had one register opened at that time, so it made the wait that much longer. 

We only tried the leche flan Ube cupcake because we did not want to wait long for other items.  But I will say the cupcake was delicious and that alone is worth a repeat visit.

I think the Ube gods love me?. This delicious purple yam can be found in almost every item on @cafe_86 menu. They give traditional Filipino desserts a modern upgrade while maintaining the same familiar taste we've all grown to love; its creativity at its finest and it's absolutely delicious. We ordered the halo halo which is a flavorful mixture of blended ice, boba, jackfruit, coconut jelly, and cornflakes topped with a generous scoop of Ube ice cream and a piece of leche flan. It was the perfect refreshing treat to beat this heatwave. We also tried the Ube flan cupcakes. The deep purple colored cupcake is moist and fluffy with a mild coconut flavor. The cupcake itself is already delicious but once you add that firm, eggy, caramel-y flan it takes you to a whole new level of delicious. The result is a perfectly balanced not overly sweet dessert that will leave you wanting more (like maybe 2 or 3 more.. lol). So, if you love ube... if you love desserts... or just curious....

THE TASTE ...... IT WAS THE WORST FILIPINO DESERT IVE EVER TASTED. The cupcake tasted like it was just a plain piece of bread except dried out and colored purple, they might as well say flan cupcake cause there's no ube taste but the flan was good. The ube latte on the other hand was ferocious...... It tasted like some low calorie ube powder and mixed with water. I tasted the ube but was not sweet enough nor tasteful enough to finish.

I came here on their opening night. As expected the line was out the door. So many ube lovers. Sadly they ran out of almost all their desserts. Luckily they still had a few ube truffles which weren't what I've been eyeing down but they were really good. It's a good thing they were closed and out of them cause I would've asked for more right away. I got the Ube Monster milkshake. It didn't have the strongest ube flavor but I loved it still it's ube. Maybe I'll ask for more ube flavor next time.

The 2nd time I came here there was no line out the door but again they were almost out of all the desserts. Tears were ready to start pouring down my face until I found out you can order online which I'll definitely use next time. Picked up some ube leche flan cupcakes which were so good. Ube Monster, iced ube latte, and halo halo. They even hooked it up with some sky flakes crack cookies. Everything again was really good. The halo halo wasn't the traditional way, which I usually do prefer, but it works.

There is so much more I still want to try. Ube ice cream on top of a brownie, ube tres leches, churrochi with ube ice cream, ube crinkles, halo halo bread pudding, I could go on and on. OMG I just talked myself into going back now. It's a good thing they're not far away from my house. 

Customer service was excellent, very friendly and quick. As long as they keep it up and keep pumping out these delicious ube treats they'll be around for years, at least I hope so. I'll definitely be back.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,2,3,5,UrHw2r6qCLbKdUxB4ToT1g

Damn everything trendy that's mermaid themed. This Ariel wannabe is a sucker for anything with the word ""mermaid"" in it. I went to Cafe 86 because I was craving a Thai tea, but then once I got to the register I made a last minute call and switched my drink order & got their mermaid tea. The mermaid tea is a milk tea that is a combination of jasmine tea with sea salt cream. Two things I typically enjoy, it just turns out not so much together. In their defense the nice lady at the register did tell me if I didn't like it to let them know and they would make me something I did like. But it was so busy in there and I'm huge on if you ordered it (& as long as it came out correctly) then you better not complain. That's just what I get for taking a leap of faith and it's not like it's going to cause them to lose my business, I will definitely be back because they do have a ton of other items on their menu I still want to try, like their halo halo, churrochi and ube butter bars,  before I make my final decision on Cafe 86. I also did check-in on Yelp and received their free Hibiscuss Cooler, I will probably not do that again... But hey, it was free!

I did, however, really enjoy the dessert I tried. Their unique dessert options had me Googling what ""ube"" was.

Ube (definition NOT found on Urban Dictionary)

A kind of bright purple yam used as a flavoring and coloring in sweet dishes.

I follow them on Instagram and daily they post their selection of homemade goodies. Like I said earlier, there are a few different ""ube"" inspired items I want to try. This time, they had their ube leche flan cupcakes, which they only offer on Wednesdays and the weekend.

When you enter, the ambiance is cute and customer service was good. They had a good amount of seating available, which is always convenient. 

I ordered two halo-halo, four ube flan cupcakes and cookie butter milkshake. The halo-halo and cookie butter milkshake were $7 each and the cupcakes were almost $4 each. I expected to taste authenticity especially from the halo-halo, but what I got was super hard boba which usually are not even in halo halo if you've ever tried authentic Filipino halo halos. 

I also feel like the whole ube flavor was played out. It was ube everything and some of the food pieces just did not tie in all together. As a Filipino I think we have more flavors to offer other than ube and this flavor was just shoved in every type of food you could think of and in all honesty it did not work out for some of it.",qqf3Gc3j0nSu0OPSJIxn7A,0,0,3,vVPAvufjwtY0LyhWLdaHtg

My husband and I split the Turkey pesto. It tastes better than starbucks'. Wish they had some choices of Filipino food to snack on hoping they'll add stuff in the future.

Other dessert I tried were the ube crack crumble and the ube flan. The crack crumble was better than the ube flan! However, they were both good. Ube flan tastes like a purple puto cupcake with flan on top.

She was also so sweet she gave us a Cafe 86 hat for my husband since it was Father's Day and made an extra house milk tea because they weren't sure if they made it correctly the first time but it was and they just said it's okay, I can have the second Mille tea too.

A celebration of Instagrammable delights. I'm Filipino so I inherently fangirl over all things that are concocted with this purple yammy goodness. Needless to say, count me in for opening weekend!

First off, this is just a placeholder rating. New businesses always need time to facilitate and level out the crowds, but I wanted to go ahead and write a review to share a few things I learned:

-- Yes, there is a Yelp check-in offer like they have for all their other locations. It's not yet up on their page, but you get a free mini HIBISCUS CALAMANSI drink if you mention Yelp. (It was a nice refresher after all that ube.)

-- Yes, there is a rewards system if you provide them with your phone number at checkout. I believe it's buy nine drinks, get one free.

-- They seemingly don't have a landline yet, so good luck dialing whoever the 909 number that's listed as their business contact. It was hard to verify the hours for their opening weekend both on that number and their Instagram. (The cashier said they open at 11am.)

-- If you were held hostage and asked to pick between the UBE MONSTER and the UBE MILK TEA, choose the ube monster. Way better. (This verdict may change once I try the UBE LATTE though.)

-- Ample seating, on-the-road theme, big Jenga blocks and big Connect Four included.

Service is pleasant, and we've never ran into the situation of anything being 86'd (kitchen lingo for an item that is sold out) which is what I originally thought the ""86"" meant (It is actually  an homage to the owner's husband's 1986 Toyota Supra)

Cafe 86's GRILLED CHEESE is simple, straightforward, and  delicious...
The UBE MONSTER MILKSHAKE is perfect for any ube addict braving this Vegas heat...
Surprisingly, I wasn't a fan of the popular UBE FLAN CUPCAKE. The flan layer was dense and very sweet, and the cupcake was dry. This is what they're known for, this is what people come in and hoard. It's one and done for me.
Philippines meets Mexico as calamansi and agua de jamaica combine in the HIBISCUS CALAMANSI COOLER...(Free with your Yelp Check-In! GO!!!) Deliciously refreshing,  and a lifesaver after each bite of the ube flan cupcake. The UBE CHEESECAKE is very decadent and use caution when biting into the crust as it is pretty solid and thick. I like that they've taken the national dessert of the Philippines and made it their own by incorporating a cereal milk slushy layer with frosted flakes, giving a different flavor dimension in the HALO-HALO. Our favorite thing to get here is the HALO-HALO BREAD PUDDING. Yummy bits of jackfruit, macapuno, and mango are baked into the bread pudding which gives you the best of both worlds. Get it warmed up, top it with ube ice cream, and KILL
 IT!

We tried almost everything they had available.  

The Churrochi with Ube ice cream is amazing.  Such a great combo.  I also ordered Ube Butter bars and Ube leche flan to go for my husband to try.  The lady that checked me out recommended I try the Hibiscus Calamansi drink which was amazingly refreshing especially on a hot day in LV. 

My cousin had the Halo Halo Bread pudding with Ube ice cream but it was ok ( Im not really a bread pudding kinda person). They also had the Ube truffle (not pictured) and that was pretty good too.

Cafe 86 does NOT disappoint! 

The ""Kouki Monster"" is a clever play on words from the car community that spawned this cafe, and the drink itself is delightful.

The newest and latest café with a Filipino twist has officially arrived in the popular Southwest region of Las Vegas. This SoCal transplant is the 4th location for Cafe86. I personally never got the chance to try their California locations but I've seen tons of IG worthy photos and SnapChat posts from family and friends in the past. A main draw for their desserts and drinks is their use of Ube, the purple yam that is popping up on social media especially foodie bloggers. I was quite please with all of their items that we ordered but was a little disappointed that the pastries were wipeout with the exception of their drink menu and few desserts like the Ube Ice Cream Sandwich and Churrochi. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable but it was notice able that they have been busy throughout the day since they have been open since Saturday, the 16th of June.

Everything we ordered was Masarap(Delicious)! The special made to order, chuRROChi was a unique blend of Churros made with Mochi and cut into triangular shapes and served with a scoop of Ube Ice cream. This dessert was balanced with sweetness and consistent in texture as it was made with Mochi but the outer churro was crisp and wasn't soggy but it paired well with the Ube Ice cream. The Ube monster shake was good and balanced flavor. Another drink that we enjoyed was the Hibiscus Calamansi, a good amount of sweet and tart taste and actually complimented our consumption of Ube desserts. 

According to the staff, this Café 86 is much larger than the SoCal locations so it has a good sizeable lobby with various seating arrangements including a sofa, bar stools and tons of chairs. The modern rustic garage lobby gives it a unique look but the menu reflects a Filipino twist to what they offer creating a cool contrast. Plus, its quite notice able that they like Star Wars because they had memorabilia scattered around that provided a sense of character to the café. I will have to come back and try more of their items including the Ube Cheesecake and Bars!! :)

I always always visit their other branch in Pasadena, CA. but I always always miss the days when they serve the ube flan .
Luckily I ordered Halo-halo and boooooy was that satisfying! woooah! my love also ordered the monster matcha blended, that too was good.
the lady said they will be closed today (monday, father's day) and will probably be open tuesday with the ube flan, so I am looking forward to that. A lot of people were lined up yesterday when we visited, I guess they were excited for the food too.
place: spacious and chill
service: smile, polite, and friendly
ambiance: good ambiance good amount of people and chair
price: halo halo was about 5 or 6 i think and it was worth the price.

At 4pm on a Sunday after they first opened doors, there's no line, there's also no selection of pastries. Make sure you get here early if you want dibs on that Leche flan ube cupcake. Luckily we were able to snag the last one. 

Their sky flake cookie is pretty delicious. Doesn't taste like sky flakes but has the texture of a cracker.

My ube milk tea was okay. Tasted like halo halo milk soaked in cereal. I think I'll try the Ube Monster next time.

With all the Filipinos in town wanting to try halo halo, because it's halo halo, they need to get more blenders and an ice shaver into the repertoire. 2 isn't cutting it and causing a back up for blended drinks in this 100 degree weather. 

I'm sitting here now at 4:30 pm and my friend has been waiting 30 minutes for her non-halo halo drink- the Ube monster. 

While the drink is delicious and refreshing, hopefully once the hype dies down and kinks in the system are worked out, then it won't be as patience testing of an experience.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,2,1,4,ezoFSlWdYFbgcSm0KgSJ5A

Although I must say that the items that they did have left, for example, the vegan ube cake was actually delicious. The ube cheese cake however wasn't so great. The matcha drink was good though. It would have been better if I added boba but I forgot and the lady didn't ask me if I wanted some. The restroom needs help. The soap dispenser was empty as well as the paper towel dispenser. The room had a weird smell too. It smelled like mildew. They have quite a few tables and games like connect four and jenga for entertainment.

My sister and I waited and drove by occasionally to see their progress and were so excited for them to open. We came during their opening week and was so happy that we live so close to the location (Jones and Russell).

The ube cupcake with leche flan is a must have! Although I've been on a diet, don't eat too much sweets, this was one thing I could not turn down! The ube cupcake was cooked to perfection, soft and just melted in my mouth. The leche flan was perfectly sweet. (*eat using a plate or with a napkin because the syrup from the flan does leak and tends to get all over the place) I brought a few cupcakes to work and my non-Filipino coworkers who have never had either ube or flan fell in love with them also!

Such a cool vibe in the place with tons of games and decorations to play with and look at while waiting for your order.

The teas!!! I was so happy to learn that there were a selection not loose leaf teas. It is hard to find places that make teas with real tea leaves and not powder! I'm a fan of the hibiscus calamansi. It was soo refreshingly tasty! (Not a fan of the boba, it was slightly hard but I know that is how Filipinos like the boba in the desserts)

When churros & mochis make love the churrochi is the beautiful love baby it produces. I could eat probably 5 orders in one sitting. They are to die for!!! Mochi texture in the middle.

Wifey had a Halo-halo craze so we went for it. They didnt have the traditional style, in where every ingredient are intact. Basically the blend some of it, then boba was added some red and green jellies and on top, ube ice cream and leche flan.

I mean it tasted pretty good, but i feel like it lacks more of the stuff that you actually chew. The ""halo-halo"" concept isnt really what it is.

Ordered in on a Sunday, 4:06pm as per my receipt, after placing my order they put my order slip on a que.  There was a lot of orders to be made, but the cashier didnt mention any wait time.

Came back to check on my order after 25mins and still wasnt done. =/  yes, i looked at the time difference as i was getting frustrated. Then couple of more minutes finally came.

Service was horrible as far as getting the orders out, yet staff were friendly. I feel like they werent prepared yet as to handling huge crowds walking in. 

Absolutely need more than 2 blenders because its not enough.

5094851,2018-06-30,12,D_24gRsnae7guxJE8gLgtw,"Everything's so purple... just as it should be. 

We're talking ube and that means the refreshing Filipino treat halo halo just in time for summer.  But Cafe 86 is more than a one trick pony.

First, ube, dioscorea alata, is different from Okinawan sweet potato, ipomoea batatas.  It is either found as a powder or a highly concentrated extract.  This Cafe seems to use both to great success.

The ube leche flan cupcake is very good.  Obviously made with some dried ube powder, the cupcake has a denser, chewier texture.  Plenty moist.  Well controlled sweetness and ""dirt"" flavor that pairs very well with the creamy, caramel, scalded milk flavor of the sweet flan topping.

If you enjoy the earthy flavor of chocolate, the ube brownies are great.  Once again a firmer, chewer texture with very balanced sweetness.  It begs for a scope of not too sweet, creamy ube ice cream.  The earthy flavor of ube has been replaced by a starchy potato flavor.  

The halo halo uses the excellent ube ice cream.  Creamy yet cold and icy at the same time.  Though no azuki or corn, there is still a lot of texture and different flavor with each bite when mixed.  Just get one.

Lots of other ube drinks (milk tea, lattes) and ube desserts.  Non ube teas also offered.  

Young and enthusiastic staff still learning.  This will improve with time.

Although from California, the café looks like it would be at home in Metro Manila.

Definitely worth a try.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,14,18,4,ODbEtlo9ntpNNRI3bs0bfg

The place  is neatly decorated in a modern industrial/rustic look with a touch of fun Star Wars flares.  They do have monster jenga blocks and connect for kids or big kids to play with. I honestly don't know how anyone that works there can handle the constant loud bang of the blocks coming down. 

This time we tried the cookie butter and ube monster shakes - delicious!  We sampled pretty much all of the pastries that had ube in it, but missed the ube pie. They were all pretty tasty. Keep in mind, ube is a super mild flavor and most non-ube lovers won't get it.  The ube truffle is where you'll get the most ube flavor and that's a definite fav!  Next time we'll have to sample the pie. 

The staff were nice and overall a good experience, considering it is their first week. There will always be a line where there's mass ube desserts on the menu in LV, so be patient.

They used to do that only on certain days. Well here in Vegas they have it everyday and I'm so happy they do.. Also especially right now since the hype is real with this spot! EXPECT long wait times. I came in today and realized that the ube flan cupcakes were gone again but Next Time I will order online. No big deal.. I ended up getting some ube madelines which were really good if you like Taro pound cake. Thai tea brownies are actually really good but I didn't taste anything Thai tea to be honest but still a solid brownie! The cookie we also ordered is pretty good. And of course I order the Tiger tea which is milk tea and Thai tea mixed together.. really good too. I'm waiting to eat this last Red Velvet flan cupcake but as of right now I'm all sweeted up.. I will have to edit this later to let you know how it was. Cafe 86 is a solid place to eat some deserts and boba or even a sandwich. The decor is super nice and it has a cool vibe to hang out. I can see this place booming real soon. To be continued. Thanks cafe 86 for these goodies,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,3,3,4,sa2Q3sYK2TPASc2u4gz0Ng

I had to see what the hype was about and so glad that we came and it did not disappoint. We arrived yesterday at 11AM....as soon as they opened to ensure we had a good spot and there wasn't a long line. Let's just say that was a good move. My family and I stayed for 2 1/2 hours yesterday. Just enjoying the food and playing Jenga. 

The restaurant was spacious and in my opinion, it had nice decorations. The atmosphere was nice. It was CLEAN! Yay!

We tried a couple of things .....

Ube bread pudding...OMG! It will change your life! This is a MUST have! I don't usually like bread pudding but my sister insisted we get one. I'm so glad we did. They warm it up and then put a big scoop of Ube ice cream on top! The consistency was not like your typical bread pudding (I think that is why I liked it even more). The flavor of the Ube just came right out even without the ice cream. 

Ube Flan Cupcake  - not a fan. It was nothing special. The cupcake itself was dense. Not moist. Lacked flavor. 

Truffles - LOVE IT! it was sweet but delicious...no wonder why it was small but honestly the perfect size! 

Ube Monster - nothing special - honestly, I've had better Ube shakes elsewhere. 

Halo Halo - not the traditional style. It didn't have the ""beans"" like a real halo halo does. They had Jello type mixtures but it was still delicious. 

Churrochi - Another, WOW! It's not a typical churro where it has a crunchy outside. It looks like that but it's not. It tastes like a churro but it has the consistency of mochi. You have the option of getting Ube ice crea on it or not. If you do, it's an additional $1.50. I personally don't mind not having the ice cream as I had it on almost everything else. I loved it! It wasn't as sweet as it looked. It had the perfect sweetness. 

Hibiscus Calamansi - so good and refreshing (free with Yelp Check-in)

Thai Tea Brownie - too rich! I have a sweet tooth but this was way too sweet for my liking. I didn't even think it tasted like thai tea.

The staff from what a noticed were a lot of younger ""kids/adults"" but there were very nice. Met and chatted with the owner and she was also very kind. She was very down to earth and even gave my sister and I a little background of the couple.

All I have to say is, don't give Cafe 86 a bad rating just because they run out of pastries. They just opened. They didn't know how much of a hit it would be. They are trying their best with providing us with what they can. If they run out, I know it's frustrating but let's look at the positive side....IT'S A SELLER!

The design of the place is really cool and modern and there is plenty of seating, which I appreciated. Even with the opening day crowd, there always seems to be a table open for everyone. Something that Cafe 86 did that seemed smart was open starting at 6 rather than a random time in the afternoon. This allowed them to not run out of supplies mid afternoon and so they could accommodate the large crowd that descended upon the store. 

We ordered two frozen drinks including one called the Cookie Monster - which was amazing!!!! I love cookies so I was in heaven. I also ordered an ice cream sandwich with Ube ice cream which was scrumptious! The best part was the cookie which was still warm and the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy.
