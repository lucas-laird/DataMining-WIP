With the latest surge in sushi burrito and poke places, it Can be tricky finding authentic tastes , so I was very happy with the trip to Yoshi.  Nothing over the top relative pricing and tons of fish packed into a delicious, tightly rolled seaweed paper burrito!  

They accommodated my request to change the sauce on one of their specialty burritos , the Yoshi, without any hesitation and helped us all through the menu options .  The Yoshi was packed with 3 different types of fish, fresh jalepeno, rice and a few crunch wontons and I added Siracha and sweet chili .... so good ! 

The service was attentive and nice and even checked on us while eating.  I was impressed and left with a very full belly.  

The only thing that bummed me out was the lack of taro chips! I love them so much and it's such a treat to enjoy them in Vegas so I was hoping they would offer, but they don't carry them .

Since I have been going here, the experience has steadily declined. First they had a generous rewards program but I guess decided it was giving too much away so they changed it. 

But, more importantly, the food. Each time I have gone they seem to be giving me progressively less fish and sides until today I felt like I got a mound of white rice with a pinch of each fish and 1 bite of eel, and a pinch of seaweed salad.  Each scoop of protein is like almost 3 dollars? For whatever reason today my volcano bowl came with a ton of jalapenos and some spicy powder but none of the creamy mayo that seems to balance out the heat... so my face is on fire and I'm not feeling satisfied by this meal, leaving a huge pile of unfinished white rice which took up most of the container. Perhaps I should have asked for more and offered to pay if I needed to? Maybe I should have asked for the more generous chef to prepare my food? 

As an avid weight lifter, I used to come here after a workout and still be unable to finish the meal no matter how hard I tried. What happened? As much as I love this kind of food I can't justify paying $14 dollars for that again because I'm not a small child, no disrespect.",w09fejz3UafOghr1qPhAxw,1,0,2,PJZPiIet_H0axigDyq4Fyg

Nothing I have had from Yoshi has been anything but great - especially the tuna.  I have been to others similar and they have prepackaged shoyu and wasabi and they were skimpy on giving them out.

Ordered: Buddha Roll (ahi tuna, masago, seaweed salad, cucumber, jalapeno, guacamole, red onion, lettuce, wonton strips,yoshi poke & yum yum sauce) $8.95 and a side of Mexican street corn $1.55.

Taste: Buddha roll had a nice balance of flavors, but wasn't the best I've ever had. Portion of fish was greater than the toppings, so definitely felt worth while price wise. I had asked for them to not include the jalapenos, however as I was eating the burrito I noticed that there were several pieces of jalapeno included (I should have been more attentive when they were making my food, but I got distracted by the other menu listings).Size of the burrito was more on the long/skinny side, but I felt satisfied after eating. The Mexican street corn was just ok. It did not provide the flavors I was expecting (missing the acidity) and portion size was smaller than I would have preferred for a side.

Their featured bowls are a small list with only one protein each, which I found odd. The salmon bowl was unimpressive, with a huge portion of hot(!) rice and an overwhelming wasabi flavor that wasn't in the description.

 Seems the staff mixed up the sauces for our items, but since we ordered takeout I couldn't address it with them. I found it interesting that the menu has quesadillas and elote, but haven't tried either yet. I'll likely try this place again after a nearby workout, but Yoshi has a few kinks to workout and some improvements to make to stand out from the many other options around.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,15,3,MAN_pn9YyMZtmfnwpDHheA

I ordered Ninja roll w/seaweed paper plus a side order of miso soup (which you get it for free by checking in on Yelp). The roll itself tasted good for the most part, but it fell apart as I ate along. I think this is because the roll was not made tight enough or there was too much stuff and the seaweed paper wasn't big enough, so I ended up with a mass at the end. Now I will suggest you not to waste your money on the miso soup. The soup is so diluted that you can't tell the flavor at all other than there were some pieces of green onions and tofu in it. I make miso soup at home occasionally, so I do know how it's supposed to be and this soup here is no where near it I have to say. You would be better off spending your money on a bottle of water.

The floors definitely could have used a good mop though. The floor was oddly sticky in the area I was sitting.

There's a first time for everything, and this place is closer to me; however, it's just not completely worth it for me. The quality of the fish just didn't taste right, which I think could have been an account of the rice being a little too over cooked.

I have brought lots of friends and have watched them evolve. I love eel and used to order it in my bowl. The first time it was alright but the next two times I pulled significant fish bones out of it.  I had spoken to the owner and he apologized saying that all eel is prepared that way. It's not. I have eaten eel for the last 15 years and never once have I pulled bones out of it. I let the first time slide but the second was too much. I decided that the fish was still good quality so I would just avoid the eel from now on.  Today, I decided to go back after I hadn't for several months and I ordered a bowl with salmon and spicy tuna. The quality has gone down significantly. The fish is not fresh, the salmon doesn't taste like salmon and it is so mushy that my fork disappears into it. Gross!!!! Also this potentially carries food-born illness bacteria. It also did not have one similar flavor note to what salmon tastes like. It tasted like fishy aluminum. How horrible.  As having been in food and beverage management for several years, I can safely say that I will not be going back here until they improve their quality.  They'll be lucky if I don't send a health department rep there for a surprise visit. I did not see the quality of the rest of the fish as I had someone else pick up my meal for me.

What'd I pick?  The seaweed paper.  It's gotta be like an actual sushi roll right - for a first timer sushi burrito trying spicy raw seafood loving hungry person who decided to skip lunch today (breeeaaathe) :/

Alright, ready... 
Proteins: Spicy tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail.  
Sauces: Wasabi aioli and Avocado cilantro (drools).  
Veggies: Cilantro, Cucumber, Red onion, Seaweed salad.  

It's about to happennnn!  Please add Masago.  Lookin' good ;)  $8.95.  That's decent.  Thanks for helping me!  I'll add tip... An hour or so later.  Well done!  I shall bring these exact ingredients list back for another.

The space and seating is a good size, not huge, mostly two seater tables.  Simple wall designs and looks clean.  The ceiling is really high.  If this place picks up crazy business, there'd be room to build second floor seating possibly.  

They sell authentic green teas.  I'm saying authentic cuz I can't decipher the characters on the bottles.  There are regular fountain drinks also.  It's self serve next to the plastic utensils and napkins.  I didn't get to ask if there are free refills.  And there are extras like jalapenos, miscellaneous spicy sauces, and pickled ginger on the side of the register - allowed to help ourselves.

Friendly and really helpful customer service.  Their countertop is short, so this place only had 3 workers handling my order.  They wear disposable gloves; important.  I'm very grateful they let me sample 3 other sauces that are not in my burrito: Yumz, Sesame, and Unagi.  Yumz is my fave and I'll add it in next time.  Cya' again Yoshi!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,42,34,5,j8e_O2KGdOazlWmkcDi3Pw

The workers were slightly rude with a chip on their shoulder and the whole process was very disorganized ...they had us indicate what rice we wanted and what menu item we were ordering, and then had us pay...then go back in line against the flow to put the toppings on (which had already started to be put on without our request or knowledge, so corrections had to be made which were met with an attitude). The whole process did not flow well and if we had questions they were answered reluctantly.  The quantity of food was good but this place may need more time to get in the swing of things, get organized, train positive workers, etc.
The one star review is because I received a private message on 2/1/17 from the owner- he basically stalked and 'researched' me.  He looked up where I was from (hometown), claimed he knew my husband was in the military, he knew my husband's name, excused the male worker that was rude to us of being pregnant (what?), and claimed to know WHERE I CURRENTLY LIVE and WORK. Totally inappropriate and creepy! We definitely won't be going back here, and I've reported him to Yelp. He has claimed I'm lying however I have actual screenshots of his message to me.  Screenshots don't lie. These were forwarded to Yelp and I saved them in the event the police would need to get involved. Sadly, even though I actually liked the food, due to the clearly inappropriate behavior from the owner, I will not be returning.

I built mine off the standard ones that you can order by spicing it up and adding some texture to my burrito. 

They let you taste the sauces prior so u can know what you're getting into.

All the reviews of people complaining about  being mushy I don't understand....you're eating raw fish and sauces in a burrito. Of course its gonne be ""mushy""...add some texture to it with tempura, vegetables or something people!

1) Server leaned halfway into the kitchen to ask for an ingredient, except instead of walking in, she grabbed onto the wall.   Without changing her gloves, she began to prepare burritos and bowls for customers.  

2) In preparing a sushi bowl, the server began to put cold refrigerated raw fish onto steaming hot bed of rice.  I mentioned to the staff that is not safe and defeats the purpose of keeping raw fish refrigerated in the first place.  Her response was this is how we have always made it here.  I asked her to put the raw tuna in a separate container and I'll simply wait for the rice to cool down.  The rice was so hot, even 30mins after leaving, the rice was still too hot to be used and i ended up eating that separately.

As for the free miso soup check in, it was more miso flavored water with 3 mini cubes of tofu.  Rather than preparing it ahead of time in proper proportions, it was made by squeezing miso out of a plastic bottle and then she walked it over to the plain hot water dispenser.

Customer Service: Every single time I come here it is always the best service ever. Everybody there is super friendly and willing to help. Also the owner or his son is always there and they take the time to check on the clients and try to improve as much as possible.

The food: I became a Vegan 10 month's ago but before then the fish was always fresh and of good quality. My only gripe is that they don't have a Real Vegetarian, or Vegan menu to pick from. When I eat there I have to custom build my own food but the ingredients are always good. 

The Atmosphere: They hold a Car Meet every month and it is pretty cool. They have all types of vehicles, everything from domestic to import to bikes it's pretty sweet. They usually have a DJ booth playing music and they do free raffles. I won fifty dollar at one of these events. 

Discounts: They give military discount and if you are there for the meet they give you discounts as well. They also have a loyalty program that uses your phone number.

The good: Excellent service, good food and a pretty cool environment.

The Bad: Not enough options for Vegetarians or Vegans. Also the last two car meets security has had their panties in a bunch, the guy this time was much nicer but the guy last month was yelling and trying to kick everybody out.

Plus I got a FREE miso soup for checking in on Yelp. The bad: to call it a burrito is a misnomer. It's more like a glorified roll. The size of this ROLL is tiny. I finished it in 6 bites. The photos made it look like it would be the size of an actual burrito. IT'S NOT. Not sure why this place doesn't have more business...literally no one here on a Friday night dinner time. Plus they aren't closing for another 3 hours and one of the employees kept sweeping up a storm with a broom right next to me. Really unsanitary,k6mtbbo7XJV2V7jpDZVlLw,0,0,3,qkZiFt4khUHPg7LQHxHB-g

5558230,2017-01-04,3,_RiwESa2w64ls6y_5tE4CA,"Service was friendly, the establishment was clean.

The menu is primarily poke based, but upon seeing that they had elote in a cup, I was very excited.

For only $1.55 a pop, it came in a good sized container for 1.5 people.
Inside, it carried charred corn which was nice, the melted cheese was an interesting mix despite it not having the normal cotija, it had some of the red powder which idr, .. there was mayo involved, and a sprig of cilantro, BUT IT WAS MISSING A VERY IMPORTANT INGREDIENT: the lime! 
What I'm used to is bbqed corn slathered in butter, mayo, cotija cheese, the red powder and lime juice, so this was a departure from home.

I'm really sad that I didn't try it while I was there, otherwise I would have said something. What would have been a 4 star review shot down to two. There was no acidity whatsoever, just pure creaminess - I was a sad panda.",4UYKBKiYeJDG7Itr1ekrJQ,6,2,2,aokXre5NMO_TwKKk81S5ow

Luckily I was wrong--the food is actually pretty good; the sushi isn't the best you're going to find but it's good enough, the serving size is generous, and the staff is friendly. It's actually a place I would go back to.

Past:
There has been a price increase which is rather substantial with their menu change, and even smaller portions to go with it, along with a reduction of their rewards program. The food, service, and quality has all otherwise been good and stayed the same. It's a bit of a shame since it was one of my favorite places close by, too. 

The owner responded stating that they would have went out of business otherwise, but now I can't really say much to distinguish them from the other comparable poke places. I just wish I had reviewed and promoted them more before so that they wouldn't have had to raise their prices! I can see how the location isn't very visible to the streets and thus might affect business as well without word of mouth and promotions.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,5,0,4,VNCCNx2ie_lu6LatXfS_iQ
