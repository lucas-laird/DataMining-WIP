We came here on a Sunday to watch football, as a last resort. Big Dog's was super packed with Cheeseheads on this particular Sunday.

At first glance, its not that bad of a place. It is pretty dark inside, which I dont mind one bit. The service leaves a lot to be desired. However, they do have some pretty servers :D

I ordered some chicken teriyaki sandwich & it was horrible. The wheat bun seemed a little dry, almost like it was old. My companion was craving a calzone & was excited that there was ricotta in it, so she placed her order. 

Quite a bit of time went by as well as looks of ""hey, where's my food?"" towards our server. So...she finallycame over & said there was some sort of mix up & they sent out the last calzone & that they were out of ricotta now & then it was like Womp Womp Womp, Charlie Brown's F***King teacher, because I stopped listening. So, my friend had to call an audible & order a pepperoni pizza instead. 

Now get this, my food comes out & hers is nowhere to be found. So, being the gentleman that I am, I decide to wait, because it would've been the height of rudeness not to. So, about 10 minutes or so go by & still nothing & by this time my friend is telling me to go ahead & eat & it's ok. So, with great reluctance, I finally gave in. But, I was nice enough to share my fries :D Finally, her pizza comes out & she offered me a taste & it was pretty decent, definitely worth the 1 star.

Our server came out with the check & much to my surprise & satisfaction, they comped both meals & only charged us for the 2 beers my friend ordered. Not too shabby. For that, they get an honorable mention for a 1/2 star.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,0,0,1,uGomKr86WeOM8L5JC6SPBg

Wevr bern back a number of times.   The wings were great each visit, with ultra fresh cut veggies and tasty ranch dressing.  Some places just don't rock the ranch and I like covering my bare veggies with a nice white coat of ranch dip.

Speaking of rocking it, the tunes were great. Different genres each time, but cool background music.   We got hooked on table shuffleboard because they have a nice table that is well maintained and available week nights and the players, us, get a little loud without bugging too many people.  Plus, the evenings now are  perfect for their patio and we notice the regulars who don't need the tv screens or video poker to be entertained  are the ones who head outside.

Service is good and it's always amazing when they recall your drink order after one visit!  BF and I like this place, maybe it will become our local pub!",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,0,4,NlYSkIOwAIzNGMgf53caPw

2514667,2016-02-20,1,wb-OCJAuP1upOefBs7xljQ,"First let me start by acknowledging that this establishment is a 21 & over bar. I visited this establishment because I was driving by and It looked like a descent restaurant from the outside. Upon entering I realized quickly the quality of food More likely would be run of the mill bar food, and that was ok as I was quite hungry and in a bit of a rush. 
The drink. 
I ordered a old fashioned as I often do at bars as it is a most pleasant libation, in my opinion. Needless to say their attempt at making an old fashioned was the worst I have ever had. This is saying something considering the number of old fashions I've enjoyed just in the Las Vegas area. The drink, as I'll refer to it hereforth, was made with crushed ice leading to the rapid watering down of my drink. The proportions were all off to the point that my first sip was all bitters. Finally it was garnished with a lemon peel. It is for the poor quality of the drink that I give this bar such a low rating. If it wasn't for the ""ok"" burger I had I would have rated this bar one star. It is simply unacceptable in my opinion to call your self a bar when incapable of making a mixed drink.
The food.
The food was of a quality to be expected in such an establishment. Nothing to write home about but palatable. I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was prepared as ordered. Surprisingly it was very tasty despite its quality, making for one pleasant surprise. It was this burger that got a second star out of me for this bar. Honestly a bars food shouldn't out shine its Booze.
The service.
I was surprised the wait staff was quite absent throughout the evening. I was never asked if I wanted another drink. Ever. Water was empty almost whole visit. They were not bad in my opinion just not around, because they would rather sit all huddled in a booth talking.
Summation 
A bar that can't make a drink doesn't deserve patronage in my opinion. I will never revisit this bar nor will I suggest it to any one I know.",_3lGvRfFpRtvvhf6Eki99w,1,0,2,B9flGbBYfXYNtTxUz5rUiA

As to the food, I have only eaten here once while sitting at the bar and I doubt I will eat there again.

Except for a couple of barflies at the big central bar, we were the only ones eating.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I was disappointed to learn that wine selections are pretty limited.  Had to settle for Chardonnay, which I'm not a fan of.  

The menu is typical for a pub, and the sandwich list had a good selection of interesting chicken combos.  (I didn't look at the hamburger choices). The one I chose had guacamole and grilled chicken.  The guac was fresh, and the cole slaw I had with it wasn't drowning in mayo.  But the only choices were white or wheat buns, no other bread.

The hubster started with tortilla soup, which was freshly made but not very spicy.  It was just ordinary.  He also had a turkey and bacon wrap, and he enjoyed it.

You would never get the best experience until then.",dfVVFsulfxBSkUM1S-cdvQ,1,1,5,qRwHeQEMaHaPTO1drazgQA

So I was feeling a beer, but there wasn't much selection (at least for a craft person like me). Grabbed ice teas and we shared a ""tall"" (24oz, $5) of NewCastle. This place has some really cheap pitchers (I believe they range from $5-9 bucks during game times/happy hour)  so it's a good spot if you like whats on draft (Bud, Bud Light, Miler, Coors, Newcastle, Fat Tire, Pyramid Hefe). 

We got some appetizers:

Fried Mushrooms ($6.99)- these were quite nice. The batter was nicely seasoned and stayed very crunchy despite it holding a watery vegetable. I really like fried mushrooms but most places don't have a batter that holds up. 
Artichoke&Spinach dip ($6.99)- pretty standard, but done right. Melty, creamy goodness. I appreciate that the chips were warm. 

Dinners:

I grabbed the Red Rock chicken sandwich (grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce and melted swiss cheese- $8.49) and got it with a side of potato salad. The sandwich was juicy and had a good crispy char. It was rather tall once the lettuce, onions, pickles and top bun come into play so it's a fork and knife kinda situation. The potato salad is the usual mustard mayo base and what I would describe best as a ""family picnic style"" w/ some shredded carrot, black olive, hardboiled egg, and a bit of macaroni. 

The BF got a turkey club ($7.99) with spicy fries. The key with a club is crispy grilled bread (both sides), crispy bacon, quality turkey slices and fresh veggies in a proper ratio and you're golden. The spicy fries are not spicy, but more ""spice-y"" with a good layer of seasoning. 

Yeah, we had a bit of room for dessert and grabbed a Xango (Deep fried banana caramel cheesecake wrapped in a pastry crust rolled in cinnamon sugar, topped with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar and whipped cream, $4.29) This was okay. Posed a bit of problem with the filling gushing out, but the flavors were decent. 

FYI- I posted pics and prices to help out, there is a usmenuguide for this place, but it is outdated. 

Originally we dropped by a few days ago and while we were perusing the menu, the GM said they can't serve food because of a grease fire occurred a few hours earlier and it'll be a while. He apologized since he blanked out on it, gave us his card and invited us back to give them a try. He was so nice so we definitely made it a point to come back in. He did give us a discount for our meal, but definitely it was some solid bar food. I'm slowly starting to appreciate American food...haven't before and it's little quiet bars that are changing my mind about it. The only place for me that it lacks on is beer selection. I go to Big Dogs down the street if I'm feeling beer, but their menu at night is stripped down. If I feel bar food variety- I will head here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,10,5,4,OpG_3A8YrQzYDl14c9voEw

Unfortunately, the service was awful. Our server, an older woman, I forget her name, was slow and unresponsive. My companion visited the bar to try to get drinks and the woman, Diana, stayed on her phone despite requested service. It's hard to believe that one person can make such a big difference to a bar/restaurant, but unless Jen comes back I can't imagine doing so.",6TLmHF4m3HaIKGh8310sEg,1,0,1,KdjWBPJYJhIF5MqLdhJ1wQ
5354798,2010-10-09,0,wb-OCJAuP1upOefBs7xljQ,"I heard from a coworker that this was a really cool place to go so me and the SO decided to check it out. When you open the door the smell of smoke is a bit overwhelming but that doesn't bother us to much so we proceeded to seat ourselves in the restaurant area. Since we had to seat ourselves we had to wait for the waitress to notice we were there. It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted. You know what? No big deal. We can look past that.

Mark ordered the chicken fried steak, I decided on the hawaiian burger. It seemed to take an unusually long time for us to receive our food, but being the understanding couple we are we didn't think too much of it. The bar was far from empty. 

She placed our food on the table. Chicken fried steak for Mark... but a mushroom burger for me? I immediately brought the mistake to the waitress' attention. She apologized and said she remembered seeing a hawaiian burger in the kitchen and would bring it right out. 10 minutes later she brings out a red rock chicken sandwich. That sandwich is similar to the hawaiian burger I ordered (it had a pineapple slice on it) so I didn't notice that she had given me the wrong item again. I waited about 5 more minutes for her to check back and told her that she had once again screwed up my order. She apologizes, blames the mistake on the computer and says she will put a rush on a hawaiian burger.

Before she left the table I asked her for another beer. She doesn't bring me that for another 15 minutes, and my burger finally arrives another 15 minutes after that. Mark had already finished his dinner so instead of sitting there longer I asked for a to-go box. 

She comped our second round of beers but I honestly felt that was not a good enough resolution. Instead of making a big deal about it we paid and went on our way. 

The unfortunate part about the whole experience is that Mark thought his food tasted good. My hawaiian burger, eaten cold at home, wasn't bad either. That by no means makes up for bad service.",C4MKM4ST6DQwzaCxOYcvbw,4,0,2,t9pH1HM8SMAhvqY2eEgG8A
5359917,2010-11-23,1,wb-OCJAuP1upOefBs7xljQ,"This was my second foray to the place. Prior experience was pretty good considering. You will arrive thru a cloud of smoke, which you can wave past quickly to the restaurant area. Suggest you get a booth farthest from the bar. Server was quick with the beverages (coffee). Order taken quickly as well..........goes down hill from here......50 minutes later our order arrives. Their was a 3 top which came in after us, however they were served prior to our order, by 20 min. Partners order eggs, pancakes,bacon. Call the server back say its cold...""oh I'm sorry"" Do you want me to put it in the microwave and heat it up. I was a bit taken aback. Thought she might offer to replace the order, but then thought hum if I waited 50 minutes, how long would I have to wait for a replacement order. Said no...my gripe is that I have no doubt she either turned in our order late or she just let it sit.....at any rate my tip reflected her prompt and really stupid service. If you plan to eat here...give yourself lots of time..If your pressed for time...give Denny's a try.",DxQQUd-gbiMCzYznptFjog,0,0,1,xv3HWkunjRE8JSdD0Loadw

I usually go to the bar but it was full and I sat down at a table with my friends and was taken care of by mikayla and she did amazing! I don't think I ever had an empty drink for longer than a few minutes until she came to take my order for another, she was pleasant and never missed a beat. The conversation was great and I feel as though she really wanted to be there. That's a rare find for the area this is located, a lot of servers can be very disconnected to parties who don't ""look the part"" and this was not the case in my situation! Thanks mikayla!

Pool table, shuffle board, golden tee, and it has a seperate restaurant if you want to sit in a booth.  

It is normal bar food, good hamburgers & they have the seasoned fries too (nice and crispy).  Service is usually pretty good.

When we go in its a good fun atmosphere, everyone is having a great time, drinks going around, hollering at the games on about 20 flatscreens around the whole place, food is always fresh..not a big fan of the spinach artichoke dip but theres many places I've had worse!
Waitresses are usually on time with drinks, if not its because its extremely busy!
Dining out, is great, the food is always extremely hot by the time it gets home and exactly how we ordered it and what we ordered! When we call ahead they have it ready in 10-15 mins..
Chili is great here, its made fresh you can taste it and it usually takes a little well a lot longer to get out to us but Im fine with that!
Beers and drinks are always Ice cold and the prices arent bad neither!

Im allergic to cigerettes* and if I can stand to be around it, then its not that smokey..

We ordered jalapeño peppers for an appetizer, we got bonus fries on the bottom and the poppers were mostly exploded; which tells me that either the oil had floaters in it or they fried them with a dirty basket. I ordered the fish tacos; which are described as having corn tortillas topped with shredded cabbage. Mine were flour tortillas, topped with wilted iceberg shreds. Not to mention the ""salsa"" tasted like garlic marinara sauce. It looked like the tomatoe pieces were curdled and the water had separated. Star of the show; the fish, was so over cooked, I chewed on it like a piece of old gum. Overall we spent $30 on a pretty unsatisfying lunch.
