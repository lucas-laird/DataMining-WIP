Everyone who works there seems to really like working there.  BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN VEGAS!  They only use honey & molasses for their breads and that is huge to me...NO HFCS!

I think he was offering a sample? I'm not sure, but I would of loved one being it was my first time. I placed my order and waited for it, while I saw other people come in and got offered samples.

458620,2016-11-22,0,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"Ok. After reading all of the reviews for this store I am even more disappointed with how I was treated this morning.  I entered the store because I forgot to grab breakfast before my hair appointment. I stood in line behind a young lady and there were two other women being helped. There was hardly anything in the counter but I saw them working in the back so I wasn't worried. A young man came out and assisted the young lady in front of me. He was very nice to her and offered her a sample.  The other women received samples as well. So I was excited to taste the pumpkin bread. 

Well....after the young lady in front of me got her order and checked out I stepped up for my turn only to be rudely interrupted by one of the rudest women EVER! This lady was waiting for her order and had already received her sample but was rudely begging for another one (slob). Instead of the young man asking her to wait so he could help me he indulged her rudeness and completely ignored me.  I WAS NEVER OFFERED A SAMPLE AND WAS MADE TO FEEL LIKE I WAS NOT WELCOMED IN THAT STORE.  I had to interrupt her in order to get my order in and I purchased a scone (wasn't that great anyway and it was dry) and I wasn't even thanked.

Regarding the bread, try some Blueberry-White Chocolate bread.  It sounds awful in theory, but it is SO crazy delicious.  For savory lovers, try the Cheddar Garlic, which has pockets of cheddar goodness embedded in the loaf.  

They also have sandwiches, breakfast and lunch, which I've never tried.  

My biggest beef with this place is the hours.  It closes at around 5:00 p.m., which is only convenient for housewives.  Why the hate for the working man?

However we didn't realize that they only bake it on Saturdays and likewise for most of their other types of bread.  So if you're really into a particular flavor you'll have to call ahead and find out their schedule. Because we were leaving before Saturday we implored them to help us out and they said they would bake us an order that day if we ordered a bulk of 15 loaves.  We had a couple other friends with us so we split it up amongst ourselves.  Now we're at home and very happy!  In addition to baking breads like cheddar and asiago pesto, they also make sweet breads like blueberry and lemon.

Price: Less than $6 per loaf

1406392,2016-11-03,2,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"As soon as you walk in you're offered a free sample, I went for the Blueberry Scone but it they also had Pumpkin & Cranberry Breads and even a Sugar Cookie! I loved it but didn't feel the need to order more this time. Maybe next time I'm in I'll add it to my meal. 

The menu is open to vegans, vegetarians and meat lovers. The sandwiches are made fresh and you can watch them make it. They stuff them fat! So you do get every penny's worth. There is also a cooler full of drinks such as water, sparkling water and juice. 

The only thing I dislike and reason they don't deserve 5 stars is THEY DO NOT LIST THE PRICE of each item! So you really have no idea how much you're spending until you're done ordering. I went for the ""combo"" he offered and for a bottle of water, sandwich and cookie (I didn't see any chips that caught my eye) I paid $11.30. Considering this is Fresh unlike Subway, that's reasonable but it would be nice to know that I ordered a $7 sandwich BEFORE I order it. They really should add a price system to their menu and update it if needed because everyone with common sense knows it's subject to change at anytime. 

Overall this is definitely one of my favourite sandwich shops in town. Happy Sandwich Day!!",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,5,4,4,GwvFTsl043ThFOoB80qSrQ

Although it is a bit out of my way, i decided to make the 15 minute drive to this location enthusiastic for a delicious home baked lunch.  

I was however, less than pleased with the service i received. not only were the prices higher at this location, odd, but the sandwich took much longer to make ( and was made incorrectly, despite the fact that great harvest has you write down your specifications).   the bread on my sandwich was falling apart and i had to basically each my food with my hands, it was disgusting.

i was also not offered to sample the bread of the day which i had in mind to purchase. I did notice other clients come in and be immediately attended and offered to sample multiple slices of bread and engage in conversation before walking out and leaving without ordering anything. 

Sadly i left without buying the bread of the day and will probably never return to this branch.

2220853,2015-12-15,5,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"I have been to one of the other locations in town. After my solid swim workout was craving a nice hearty sandwich. Since Great Harvest Bread Company was close by thought myself got the perfect spot for the perfect recovery meal. It was my first time at this location but for the most part everything is the same. The menu is a nice long chalkboard style with the different sandwiches grilled, breakfast, vegetarian, kids, signature, and also have salads. They still have the cutting board of assorted freshly bakes bread that can get sample slice of. The cookies and pastries they baked daily looks delicious. If you fancy some Grateful Dead tie dye style shirts they sell those to. Compare to the other location the display for the assorted fresh jams and kitchen equipment decent size (located smack as soon as you walk in).

Talk about love LOVE love the smell from the minute you walk in the store. Nothing better then smell of any kind of bakery shop. All the different fresh bread baked daily or the pastries. Not only do you get hungry but everything looks as good as the smell. 

I ended up going with the grilled spicy turkey pepperjack sandwich. It was tasty and more important hearty sandwich. There really is no skimpy comes to the amount of turkey that was in the sandwich. The bread you can choose just went with the workers recommendation of sourdough. It was loaded with bunch of other stuff. All you need too know is everything had right balance of flavor and texture. Always sandwich is only as good as the bread. The sourdough was awesome. I also got oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. The cookies are huge take up one whole bag or in my pic see the size of dinner plate. It thin cookie but still that whole lot of cookie for one person. It had the perfect balance of both worlds. Nice moist and one of the best oatmeal cookies had in awhile. 

The service was five star. They were all friendly, helpful, and positive vibes. The only thing is not lot of places to eat there. Three tables of two tops and little outdoor patio area. Then again maybe for the most part people may come here for the bread and pastries to go. You would be sad not try some of the sandwiches.

I ordered the Vegas Veggie sandwich, turkey farmhouse with the cranberry and the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf. The Vegas Veggie was just ok. They didn't have hummus and the sandwich ended up rather dry.

Then our go to pumpkin bread that is usually so addictive and moist. Took 1 slice put it in the fridge and left it behind too. It was a bit dry. Maybe it was a bad day or just a bad location. I will go back to my location some other time and see. Maybe I'm being harsh because I expect a certain level from them.

I ordered the Chipotle Cheddar Pecan sandwich.
It's description reads:
Cheddar, sweet and spicy pecans, chipotle mayo, onions, cucumbers, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, jalapeños and lettuce.

Sounded great, I order the mayo on the side. 

Upon opening the wrapper I was surprised to see how small the sandwich seemed. Lifeless in comparison to my fiancé's spicy turkey. Probably because it didn't have meat... so I take a big bite expecting and sweet & spicy burst of flavor.

What a let down. It had basically no flavor. Surely the chipotle mayo couldn't be the sole flavor provider. So I open it up to find there were no cucumbers, few roasted red peppers, no banana peppers and NO JALAPEÑOS! 
After double checking the ingredient list I also realize that tomatoes are NOT listed. But here they are, on my sandwich list.

How hard is it to make a sandwich correctly?! What a waste of money. 

I also ordered two Swiss turkey sandwiches for the kids with the herbed Italian mayo. Not impressed.

They offer gluten free bread in slices for your sandwich or in loaves to take home. I can vouch that it's seriously yummy! Call ahead of time if you're ordering a GF sandwich because they have to defrost it :) 

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because although their GF bread is made without wheat, no precaution is taken to make sure it does not become contaminated (but they do give you fair warning about cross-contamination). I cannot with confidence recommend this spot to fellow gluten-intolerants or Celiac's. It's a hit or miss for me, and sometimes I do get sick. I noticed that maybe the staff could be trained on how to prepare a GF sandwich. I've had to explain to please not use the toaster on my bread because I could have an allergic reaction if it picks up crumbs from regular bread. Some simple changes could make a huge difference and make it possible for those with less severe allergies to enjoy the food here!

4825580,2017-01-16,0,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,I love love love their Dakota Bread! We make a special trip here every time we are in Vegas for a loaf of this bread and one of their wonderful sandwiches. We tried their delicious cookies. One was so big we split it so we had the other one the next day. The peanut butter was my favorite. Well worth the special trip there.,iTAv8bGCyWNlwn1vMjQYUA,0,0,5,Nk-B1b-Tf7LxyBqkRfin4w

4893852,2013-09-12,9,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"I should have ran, (not walked), in the other direction when I saw the word ""Bread"". Chocolate chip cookies are a weakness of mine, and, oh - what's this? Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread? With butter? That is a recipe for self-destruction! Everything in moderation, right? Nope. It seems like the logic part of my brain shuts down whenever there are cookies around me. My only purpose at that point in time would be to consume every cookie in site! (My motto in life should be, ""No cookie left behind"".) The Monster Cookie, (with the M&M's), does it to me all the time. The sandwiches are excellent - especially the Spicy Turkey Pepperjack on five-grain bread, and the B-L-T-riffic. 2 more favorites - the Savannah Bar and the White Chocolate Blueberry Bread - soooo good! On the days that I want to over-indulge, Great Harvest Bread Company is my first and only stop!",4Zqh0-Db39qpGEHCIll9hw,10,7,5,h-ZMDnNBW8j62lZCV4x3MQ

Walked in and it was a little busy but I was immediately greeted by a chipper young lady and asked if I'd like a sample. Well don't mind if I do :) I was a handed a huge slice of my choice- I chose the cinnamon ? something... It was so delicious and the portion was big enough that it satisfied my sweet tooth. I was still hungry so I ordered a sandwich-the turkey club. So yummy, my little baby in utero was doing flips. I was very satisfied during my first visit that I'm sure I'll be back many more times.",Xjcd3TKbEmi3k4rrYBjeYQ,2,1,5,YKwUyR8w2tITcZ6aOeBy-w

They were supposedly closed at 6 and we walked in at 605pm i felt like an A*hole but they insisted that they take care of us. We tried the turkey bacon ranch and BLT-riffic and grabbed a loaf of pumpkin spice bread to take home. Im so glad we ate here because it was one of the best put together sandwiches ive had. they craft them really well and its not sloppy. I really dont appreciate a sloppy sandwich and the pumpkin spice bread was amazing. i will be back for sure,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,0,1,5,Xo26lAQsDidMsnN_Uh0lEg
5242989,2012-10-02,0,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"I stumbled upon this Summerlin gem while looking for a good sandwich and a lunch break during a long moving day. These guys were about to close up shop, but we had just enough time to sample delicious breads (generously cut and slathered in butter upon request) and order up giant salads. 

I love their popeye bread (cheese, peppers, vegetables, spices, oh my!), the blueberry cream cheese bread (and scones!) the monkey bread, and 

The Greek salad has enough hummus and substance to feed a small Trojan army, and the regular salad sports what is probably close to an entire chicken breast atop fresh greens. 

There's an outdoor patio, fairly quiet and enjoyable for a strip mall area, and the restaurant inside is themed in The Beatles and Star Wars - a quaintly nerdy combination that is comfortable and endearing. The staff is helpful, friendly, and makes bomb sandwiches, smoothies, milkshakes, cookies, scones, BREAD, coffee, and salads. What else can you ask for?

Well, since we're on the topic, I would like to ask for soup. Adding a few hot cup options to the blackboard just makes sense, and would complement those breads and sandwiches perfectly. 

Do note that you have to like their Summerlin Facebook page in order to access the monthly menus for this location.",bpTMsVz-mLl8-0QOcT8gpg,1,1,5,vl8ft_kbEzhS10vBBbI8DA
5286047,2017-11-29,0,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"Bread, that irresistible food item some simply snub and call: carbs. 
Whatever, listen up it's bread and the variety here is fresh and satisfies those taste buds:)
The issue I have here are those samples. Yes, free sample slices and after I taste a few, I'm full! Ha ha ha;)
Therefore, I leave with at least two loaves of the assortments they sell and they also can slice the loaves for you. Indeed- loaves plural. That's it, well they also have sandwiches breakfast ones and lunch ones.  So, stuff yourself, but go here hungry.  
When you entered the aroma draws you in, quickly since they have slices waiting for you to try.  Nope, you won't be able to resist the aroma wafting through this establishment.  Don't plan on counting calories here, this wonderful place is not for those people;). 
The baking is done on premises, hence the aroma wafting through Great Harvest:)",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,2,0,4,7GlSsfUO2oBlGsrqQMoQpg

5433824,2017-08-28,0,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,Totally dissapointed. The companies web site has Loaves of Bread not available in this store.  They slice all their bread and bag it with the exception of the asiago. I find it drys the bread out when sliced. I was told i could request a unsliced loaf and return tomorrow. Yeh. 20 minute drive to get a $9.00 loaf of Bread.  The windows are filthy and overall the place looked dirty. Don't think ill be returning anytime soon.,gWTOYTdpcm0xsgY6k57PGg,1,0,2,3i0IRR7q7R8Zkc3do5tVRw

When I arrived home neither had been toasted and no jalapenos... The sandwiches tasted good but they weren't prepared the way we asked and for $15 I expect to have things done properly.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,0,2,nHt1D32KdAgZufmMmt3Blg

I usually go to the location on Marks in Henderson because it's near my job, but this store is actually closer to where I live.  The best thing about Great Harvest?  The free slice of bread you can get when you step inside a store, with butter if you want it; of course I want the butter!  I love bread, but I can't come here as much as I'd like or I wouldn't fit through their door before too long.  I like their products as gifts because everyone I've ever gifted their goods to has loved them, as well.  The cinnamon crunch bread is one of my favorites, but I also love the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.  The cookies that they sell are a nice, big size with the snickerdoodle ones a fave, too.

5805815,2009-01-11,0,ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g,"I was a fan in Denver and I'm a fan in Vegas. This place offers the best tasting and healthiest selection of bread. I've never had wheat bread that was almost doughy like white bread (great for making grilled cheese!) or yummy seeded bread that was the perfect compliment to a turkey sandwich. 

Their Vegas rolls here are white dinner rolls and are perfect for mini sandwiches, an addition to dinner or just to munch on. Again, they're super moist and delicious!

Bonus: getting a warm slice of bread with butter and honey while you're picking out your goodies. It just doesn't get better than this-- and if you're going to be a carbaholic like me, might as well get the best bread you can get!",eCjQpniDmsnw3Hc9qP0ASw,0,1,5,Z1WMTK5R6mNQezERBC_RIQ

We received a free taste of coconut walnut bread. It was to die for!  The free sample was very very generous. The bread was the perfect balance of toasted coconut and with a little butter it was perfect. The chocolate scone was sweet but was balanced by the not too sweet cream cheese throughout the scone. This scone was definitely more of a dessert. The blueberry scone was more reminiscent of breakfast for me. Delicious in every way. My husband loved the original sandwich. It was huge! Definitely a good item to share. As far as the cinnamon roll is concerned, it was the least impressive item that we ordered. I wish it was warmed. The only thing missing was an espresso bar, but I get it - the business is bread not coffee. This place is much smaller than the one in Henderson. But the quality is the same!

Even though this place is a franchise(I have some mixed contempt for any business that has more than three locations, local or national), I expected to still have access to all my favorite glorious calorie burdened breads. But I found not all choices are available by location. Darn. Alright, I can live with that. What was available on the menu didn't always translate to the shelves however... No matter the hour. Practically every time I went in, whatever the day or time, what was available on their calendar that I particularly wanted they either had not made yet, had sold out or not going to make anymore batches. Way to pop my balloon. I feel like that little kid on Despicable Me with the ice cream each time I go in. My mood especially regresses with the service. It's usually young employees, but I would think young employees would be just a teeeeny bit more chipper. As if I wasn't disappointed enough to walk out with an alternative choice, the feeling of being helped by unenthusiastic workers just don't make me excited to come back. But I still will. There's no bakery closer to home for me and despite the disappointments and service, what baked goods I do get will still be reason enough to come.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,3,3,2,VdzKZGx6SbPGstWLlp1fkQ
