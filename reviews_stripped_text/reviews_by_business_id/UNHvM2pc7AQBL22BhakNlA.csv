9102,2017-09-18,0,UNHvM2pc7AQBL22BhakNlA,"A New Mexican restaurant, only open 30 days at the time of our dinner. We were driving by looking for a new restaurant to try and saw the banners. We went on. Sunday night of a non-holiday weekend. Not many people in the restaurant and we were offered our choice of seating. Place was clean and neat. The family ordered chicken nachos, chicken fajitas and carnitas burrito covered with red sauce. Corn chips with salsa and spicy refried beans for dipping, while we waited for our food. The food was delivered quickly and served hot. All ingredient appeared to be of high quality and freshness. The kids devoured the nachos and declared them the best they have had. The chicken fajitas came with refried beans and rice. The chicken was plentiful with a good mix of peppers and onions. The carnitas burrito was large and had great flavor. A great experience and we look forward to returning. Great food at very reasonable prices.",FW1v4oXaF2asX_0nJ5hShg,1,2,5,1COycFJUMTLR7vcR_GcHJQ

She said that she didn't know what it was and that they did not offer that she also said that many people come in with coupons and that they cannot except them because she doesn't know about them. So that was kind of a bummer but whatever their prices were still decent I guess.

2456721,2017-12-04,0,UNHvM2pc7AQBL22BhakNlA,"I'm honestly quite shocked this place has gotten a lot of 5 star reviews.  I will admit the food was good, but I've never experienced service as bad as today.  My cousin & I shared 'El Chupys Molcajete' which was more than enough for 2 people.  We asked the older Mexican lady working midday on a Sunday, what the difference was between that specific one and the ones listed above it.  She had no idea.  She said she thought maybe it came with more food.  We literally repeated the order 3 times because she was so confused on the Molcajetes they offered.  The menu also lists that it comes with 1 free beer. When i asked if it was an additional cost to make it into a Preparada (Michelada) she said she was not sure and would go ask the gentleman in the back.  She then comes back with the Preparada but still is unsure whether or not it'll be an additional cost and quickly walks away.  I asked a third time if they would be charging me additional to have it as a Preparada and finally gets annoyed and tells me No, ""just drink it"" she stated.  At this point we're already a little irritated by the lack of knowledge or her own restaurant and menu items.  But, it gets worse...
Meanwhile, there was 2 guys that walked in, placed an order,  paid for it, and they waited and waited until they got frustrated.  They finally asked for their money back and walked out.  The Mexican lady chased them outside as she's screaming at them as if its their fault they have such bad service.  Keep in mind, there was only 4 of us TOTAL dining at the time.  I can't imagine what it would be like if they were busier.
Lastly, what really ticked us off was that she overcharged us on a fish tostada we had ordered that was listed as $3.99 but charged us for a shrimp tostada of $5.99!!  When we advised her of the mistake, again she was still very confused on their menu items, that she had to go grab one to double check!  She was WELL AWARE of the $2 she was overcharging us but YET, still RAN our credit card and said ""here's $2 in cash as your refund"" OMG i am in disbelief with this kind of service.  She stated she didn't know how to 'delete' items from their system and there was no one else there to help her that she had to do it this way...
Again no complaints on our Molcajete, but its not worth the horrible service.  This place has so much potential and maybe they could start off by playing some music.  The place was extremely quiet, even though they have a giant booth for a DJ.  It is also VERY dark, when we first walked in there, there was no one around i almost thought they were closed.
Any how, will most likely never be back.",NeyzMJAR_YRb9PsHFYJLNA,1,0,2,VbKcmP_yMqHtZz2XlZatrg

The food came in about half an hour and everything tasted pretty good, but then I realized they forgot the drinks. I called to see if I could come in and pick it up and the girl who answered rudely told me that she's positive that she gave it to the driver.

There was only one other table , and they had already been served - so my order came pretty quickly after ordering.
I had the chicken enchilada plate.
I think it was around 11 dollars . Two delicious enchiladas with rice beans and small salad. 
You can always tell a good Mexican restaurant by their staples ... the rice and beans . Very good here.
The Spanish rice is not dried out as you often find.
The chips and salsa they served when I took my seat was awesome . I almost ordered more chips just to finish the salsa which was so good.
For my personal taste - the restaurant is a little dark and could use better lighting ..but it didn't detract from what was a very good meal .
I would go again.
Parking is limited and beware there is a very busy marijuana dispensary next door so cars are frequently coming in and out and u should take caution when maneuvering around the parking lot .",ats8qvpIrTawAhgXmDUg8w,0,0,4,nXA4pxoR-L7jrMQDqkNonA

My favorite thing about this place was the fact that it was all family members working there. Mom was the waitress and hostess and had one of her girls helping her, dad was the one cooking and came out to make sure we were taken care of and it looked like they had an older child sitting over at a corner table doing homework. My family has our own small business and it always makes me really appreciate others doing it.

We finally went to try it this week, had a craving for tacos. Liked the reviews so far and it was nice to just walk across the street to grab some food. 

When we first walked in it was very quite only one other couple in the place. Didn't see any staff right away. Took a couple of minutes before we got greeted. But once we did, very nice. The overall atmosphere was a little dark, but very festive. Both Mexican style and Halloween. 

They brought chips and salsa and a veggie soup. The chips are very fresh, tasted made that day. So tasty too. We both ordered different things, he ordered a carnitas burrito with rice. I ordered the too hard chicken taco plate with rice and beans ($10.50). Not bad prices. Was very pleased with the portion sizes.  The food was quickly brought out and very fresh and we'll made. Great flavors. You can tell they hope to have more people too, set up for events, dancing, sports, big screens. Also have a small bar, margarita's and beer.

They have all your favorites here, starting off with an excellent chip & salsa, fresh camaron ceviche tostada with a punch of citrus and delicate shrimp, and all your taco/burrito/enchilada needs.

The standout winner here by far was the Tampiquena Steak ($16.95). Delicious! Cooked medium, very juicy and flavorful with all the sauteed veggies. Highly recommended!  I sliced mine up, put it on piping hot tortillas with a splash of cheesy beans, flavorful rice and a dab of house made chunky guacamole....my mouth waters in delight!

Another solid choice was the A La Diabla / Devil Shrimp ($17.99). Smokey Chipotle flavors, not much heat. The sauce is reminiscent of a great BBQ marinade surrounding nice sized prawns :)

5186354,2017-11-15,15,UNHvM2pc7AQBL22BhakNlA,"Chupy's is a quirky experience, but it's a fun one. 

Oh yeah, the food is really solid, too!

Inside, the first impressions are that the owners were in a hurry to get open, regardless of how ""ready"" everything looks. The space was previously occupied by an Indian restaurant that for better or worse, didn't last long. Previous to that was another ethnic restaurant that suffered the same fate. That's the reason why I bring it up: it's a really nice space that actually looks as if it has much more potential than just a hole-in-the-wall place to grab a lunch. I hope the owners continue improving the overall look of the place, as I want this place to stick around a while, especially since it's proven to be a space with a bit of a jinx. 

The food is where things turn everything else on it's head. The chips and salsa are both freshly made, and you can tell. Next, they actually bring you a small bowl of soup (akin to vegetable beef I'd say.) I'll get back to that soup later. 

The main courses I've had have all been really good. There are bright flavors to be had in nearly every bite. The carnitas are pure porky paradise, and aren't the dry mouthful of sand that are often served elsewhere; sad, unfortunate victims of sitting too long. *sniffle* What a waste! Luckily, Chupy's respects the ingredients they use, and serve them up right. The flavor adventure is quite obviously guided by an authentic, experienced hand -- it tastes as if you were invited over to someone's home for a meal. It's then that you forgive the surroundings, because you know you've found something true; something special. In some ways, you almost want it to be your own little secret. Unfortunately, the history of the space won't allow that. 

The first time at Chupy's, a night shortly after they opened, was funny. It took around ten minutes to be noticed for seating, despite there only being one other party in the entire dining room. The previously mentioned soup had stars for noodles. There was a bar with no alcohol. Now, the soup is served as if it's actually meant for adults. Service is quick, and personable. They serve alcohol. The food remains as good as always. Chupy's continues to make changes as it gains it's sea legs in a tough location. If you're a fan of great Mexican food served with care and attention, I implore you to do your part to help a family owned local business stay open. The proof is in the food, and Chupy's definitely delivers.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,22,23,4,KY_t-Mc2GDfOYocarOIDIg

Recently opened at 5795 West Tropicana Avenue, the former location of an Indian Restaurant that has been lightened up and rebranded with a Mexican Menu, it was with friends that dinner was enjoyed on Saturday at Chupy's Mexican Restaurant, the sizable space yet to catch on but likely only due to a lack of advertising as the flavors tend quite authentic with good prices for this style of Cuisine on the West Side.

Owned by a husband and wife couple out of California, the Chef formerly splitting time between four locations on the West Coast before moving his family to Las Vegas, it was just past 7pm that the party of four sat down at a table near the bar where Agua Fresca's are currently made and kept alongside soda, a liquor license yet to arrive but reportedly on the way though apparently tied up by Sin City's lengthy wait list.

Redecorated with backlit Mariachis, character painted walls and old photos of Mexico, the overhead music appropriate and not overly loud with a festive feel, it was shortly after seats were taken that both the restaurant Manager and Chef stopped by to offer their greetings, a laminated menu displaying several plates visually with several dozen choices including choices as traditional as Aguachile and Molcajete all the way to Nachos, Tacos and Fajitas.

Carefully balancing authenticity with broad appeal, the fact that everything save for Desserts are made in house daily speaking of ownership not looking to cut corners in winning over a crowd, it was prior to orders being placed that a large basket of Housemade Tortilla Chips were presented warm alongside Salsa with a medium amount of heat, the quality of both impressive compared to most Off-Strip spots while a complimentary Quesadilla Appetizer was pretty standard stuff, though the toasty Flour Tortilla was quite fluffy despite being pan-seared around Cheese.

Not dissuaded by the lack of Margaritas, though certainly many do come to a Mexican Restaurant with expectations of such, it was instead with Water and two Agua Frescas that the Meal was enjoyed, the uncarbonated Hibiscus Flower version mild like herbal Tea while the pale Tamarind drink was fruity and refreshing between bites including a starting duo of Shrimp and Scallops served in white-hot porcelain with Cheese, Peppers and Onions served alongside the equally sizzling Molcajete filled with a Tomato-based Sauce heavy with Chiles as well as Garlic below a rim ringed in Beef, Shimp, Chicken, Cactus and Cheese.

Serving well-seasoned Mexican Rice and scratch-made Refried Beans with most plates, the latter showing a lot of care in terms of texture and flavor with great smoothness and just a touch of Cumin and Salt, it was with the first two plates still being enjoyed that a jumbo Burrito stuffed with Chorizo and all the traditional fixings was served next to Aguachiles so spicy and clean that one may assume that they have crossed the border, the Chef even going so far as to leave the tails on as they do in Mexico City which, although authentic, may come as a surprise to less experienced or unsuspecting diners.

Rounding things out with a Mixed Fajita platter, the choice of housemade Corn or Flour Tortillas a nice touch with everything on the sizzling plate meeting the same high standard as those before it, it was after hearing that Desserts were thus far outsourced that the decision was made to end the meal with a bit more of the Burrito, the smoky Red Sauce having at this point penetrated deeply with both the Rice and Meat inside well saturated and all the better for it. 

***1/2: Just starting to get up to speed, the failure to secure a liquor license prior to opening and virtually no social media presence to speak of seemingly rookie mistakes for someone with previous Restaurant experience, Chupy's shows a lot of promise for those seeking both Authentic and ""Americanized"" Mexican Food from a kitchen and ownership that so far seems committed to doing things right.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,4,u4GInf_-wNYvP83FrdwDSg
