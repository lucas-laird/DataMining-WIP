We tried both the grilled cheese and the italian panini. 

If you're looking for that perfect Instagram cheese pull, this is your sandwich. The cheese just oozes out. It's a really good grilled cheese. I wish they had one cheese in there that's a bit sharper (like a sharp cheddar), so the flavor of the cheese still comes through when melted. 

The italian was super flavorful. I loved the pepperoni and the pesto. This is an EXTREMELY oily sandwich, though. Be prepared for all the grease. You're going to need napkins.

Smooth Eats is TINY, so I would recommend you eat on the go. Otherwise, you'll have to try and score the one table.

I have been here several times and each time I'm impressed. To say its an upgrade to Downtown is an understatement. 

I'm not familiar with their whole menu because we get the same things every time.

My SO gets the green one because his favorite fruit is mango. I need to steal a sip next time because I have never tried it. He usually slurps it right down. Yum. 

I always get the Beet Box because...well BEETS!!!! Its not too earthy and its not sweet. Just the way I like it. 

I somehow time it perfectly and get to grab a ""few minutes fresh"" wheatgrass shots. Always yum. 
Their ginger cayenne shot is good but it will put hair on your chest for sure. 

They have Dole Whip now. Yesterday when I was there the owner gave me a sample...lets just say it was sooooo good I wanted to order a huge bathtub of it. He said a large portion is $6, seems like a great deal!

The owners (gentleman & wife) are super duper sweet and their business partners own Donut Bar.

What did we order?
Fairy tale- this was good. The mix if blue berry, granola, and dragon fruit over the smoothie mix is just delicious.
The goddess- this was my favorite. If you read the ingredients you might be discouraged on the taste. I think it's great!
Dole whip- when is this not good?
Golden Glow customized- it was great packed with goodness.

UPDATE: I had to update my review because the owners recently changed. Not sure how I feel about the new change just yet. The previous owners were awesome people and were always good to me. They had had such great energy & I loved the vibe every time.

If you didn't know the previous owners and you're just coming here for the 1st time, you'd probably think it was great. I ordered my caprese panini one of my usuals and it was still good. However the vibe just wasn't the same . And service is a big chunk of any business. I always was disappointed because I tried calling in my order because I know it takes a little while and I was on my lunch break but unfortunately they did not answer the phone. So I spent almost 1/2 of my lunch just waiting for my panini. Usually I call in and just pick it up. I'm not writing it off completely, not just yet anyways, but I probably will not be coming back as often as I used to. The girls that were there weren't rude or anything like that, they just weren't as fun and personable, low energy. It's just a much different vibe.

The smoothies are all $5 and you can add on extra ingredients like flax seed, protein, etc. but I stick to the basics. The Beetbox and ProGreens are solid smoothies... actually, they're liquid, like they're supposed to be, but the flavors aren't overwhelmingly earthy, bitter, or sweet, which seems to happen when I take a chance on chain smoothies. 

They have paninis, toasts, and acai bowls for those wanting something more substantial. So far, I've only tried the SD Toast (sundried tomato pesto, avocado, cilantro, sea salt) but I was impressed. I plan to try their strawberry version on my next visit!

TIP: If you're driving, this grab and go business is in a paid parking area. Short of them getting a dedicated parking space out front, your best bet is to pull into the lot around back and be quick.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,16,4,JD3gJmCVWHq07Ni2NNU7ww

I ordered the Mermaid Toast which has almond cream cheese spread, with blue majik spirulina, and gold flakes. The presentation alone is beautiful! The taste was surprisingly good too. It was a mixture of salt and sweet but more on the salty side. It was definitely filling as well. It filled my hunger for a good 4 hours. I also received one of their green smoothies which had a lot of fruits, vegetables and protein. 

The place is located downtown around the corner from Donut Bar on the right side. The ordering area is very small however you can take your food/drink to go or go to their back patio where you can sit and eat. 

I liked how it's healthy, presentation ready and local to downtown! I'll definitely want to go back to try their galaxy toast!",m2hoX1s_gfhmWm82ipNW3w,3,3,5,BlQVH_guSyVVxgtnRebCVA

Strange the coconut cheese doesn't taste like coconut and wish that the toast was toasted a little bit more, but it was yummy! Vegan food in general is expensive, ($9 for two pieces of toast), but I got it as a treat.

The flex smoothie is delicious; so smooth and not sweet with lots of natural peanut butter. For $6, a 24oz cup is quite filling!

The grilled cheese looks delicious and he put extra cheese. Also, they have vegan cookies! I tried the lemon poppyseed and personally, it's way too sweet for me, but if you like dense crunchy fudge, then you might want to try it.

The owner Chad, is extremely friendly and generous. He was very knowledgeable with all his ingredients and gives helpful recommendations.

When we walked in we were greeted promptly. Everyone was super nice and the menu is simple and mostly healthy. They are also very VEGAN friendly, which I really appreciate. 

We opted for an avocado sundries tomato toast to share and wellness shots. We asked for the toast on wheat bread. When it came out I was pretty surprised because the bread is super thick and there was a lot of avocado... which was like heaven. The wellness shots were turmeric and ginger... they were amazing. They have a cute patio and court yard to sit and dine... which was perfect. They offer smoothies, coffees, smoothie bowls, soups, toasts, and other perfect healthy treats.

My friend told me about this place on yelp so I checked it out. I saw they had dole whip so I got more than excited because they were advertising it. I walked a while to go get some. I got there and they didn't have the stuff to make it. HUGEEEEEE bummer because I Walked all that way for it. I'm not upset because I ended up getting something  else but others aren't like that and might have been pissed that had advertisement up for something they didn't have yet. I'm understanding because I'm in the business but some others won't be as happy.

They said they would have it soon so I'm hoping that's true. I would say this place is in a good location being where they are. I do hope they succeed because we need a healthy alternative down there. 


I ended up getting a smoothie bowl that was incredible. It has hemp seeds, granola, blueberries and DRAGON FRUITTTTT!!!!  The dragon fruit was amazing it tasted like a subtle kiwi. If this place continues I hope they bring in more different exotic fruit because that would sure separate them from others. Especially with the farmers market so close. 

Besides the dole whip I only suggest two things as a new business, have different size bowls because I can eat a lot more and like options. Also add some more Berries on it because a lot of the bowl was just smoothie, needed some MORE to go in it to be considered hearty.


Thank you guys for your awesome customer service and great bowls. I will be back and on the look out for dole whip ;p",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,7,4,5,vbUAs4tGXcvMEWUlETyFOA

I ordered the first smoothie from the menu the Power Up. Kale, spinach, banana, mango, and water. I'm trying to find a word to describe it and I'm actually shrugging my shoulders in the ""meh"" sense. It was just that. Not terrible, but it didn't leave a lasting impression either. I think of the great smoothies that I have had in the past, and notice that they have a handful or more of ingredients and usually have more texture to them. The smoothie was only $5 WITH tax, but I wouldn't mind paying $7-8 if the smoothie had oatmeal, flaxseed, cocoa nibs, dates, avocado, or something a little more substantial that might cost a little more to produce.

Smooth Eats is a juice bar, smoothie, shop, and quick bite type of spot down town. They don't have any seating but have areas to eat that they share with the neighboring businesses. It's more of a grab and go place.
I tried two of their paninis- one had a sun dried tomato pesto with turkey and the other had basil pesto with Italian meats. The sandwich was a good size and the flavors were great. They have very fresh ingredients. I also tried their piña colada and a couple of their juice shots which were amazing! The lemon cayenne one is nuts. 

The prices for everything were pretty average to high in my opinion. You get what you pay for and healthier foods are a bit more. Definitely doesn't break the bank and definitely worth the cost.

My last two cents for not giving them five stars was I felt the panini wasn't cooked long enough. The cheese was barely melting and the very center of the sandwiches were colder. Just a couple minutes more maybe? 

They care pineapple dole whip though and it's amazing.

I decided on the $10 fairy tale bowl which was reminiscent of the typical acai/pitaya bowls that we know too well, however the star ingredient is a type of highly nutrient algae called blue magic.

What was interesting about this place was that it was small...veeeery small, like, the size of a closet. I had no issue with this but perhaps there would be some people that would want to sit and enjoy their food with friends. I am looking very forward to going back to try the interesting, vegan, social media-worthy, gold flake adorned, mermaid toast!",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,1,1,5,KHHd0aQH8eN4qXQVDRX0wQ
4938807,2017-12-01,3,1CaM8eIvl41l4f3V-V-cAw,"I've been here twice so far. The first time, I ordered the ProGreen smoothie & an açaí bowl. The cashier (which I later discovered is also the owner) responded to my order with, ""Are you sure you don't want the blue bowl?"" while pointing to a photo of it. I should have taken this to be a sign that their açaí would not be so great but I love açaí bowls and ALWAYS try them when they are on a menu. The green smoothie was good. It tasted just as expected. The açaí bowl came out watery and immersed with sesame seeds. I find it a bit odd to have sesame seeds in an açaí bowl but was willing to try it...ehh, it's definitely not appealing to my taste buds. 

The second time, my boyfriend and I were in the area, and I decided to give their IG popular items a try. I ordered their fairy tale bowl and the mermaid toast. The toast just tasted like toast with vegan cream cheese on it. It wasn't something I would order again; however, their fairy tail bowl did live up to expectations! This bowl's presentation is very BLUEtiful. The blue green algae taste is well hidden by the blended fruits. I tasted prominently green grapes...not sure exactly what the blend was. My boyfriend ordered a soup and sandwich, and he thoroughly enjoyed both. 

I will be back to try more!",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,7,6,4,oQzkzzChqK6hES09jNJWUg

Smooth Eats is a fantastic spot to enjoy healthy, high quality options. I'm looking forward to trying the Dole Whip when I go back.

Being a frequent Vegas visitor, Grass Roots was one of my favorite stops to balance out the indulgences here and I'm stoked to be able to replace it with Smooth Eats in my rotation when I'm in town.",fwP9rp3dFqqpxaxCMxWv2Q,0,0,5,0PxuyeDV0Z7llRchs1sqCw

If you're looking for a light breakfast off the strip, this is a great place to go. They have a small menu but its just enough and everything we tried was excellent. We had both of the acai bowls, one with an acai base, and one with a blue colored base with blue majik spirulina. These are Instagram-worthy bowls. They put a lot of time into making them look nice and it pays off! They also taste great They are a little light on the granola compared to other acai bowls I've tried but that didn't bother me. The flavors were light and fresh. They have a cute outdoor sitting area which is perfect in the morning before it gets too hot. But beware- the smoothie bowls melt fast! We also got one of the avocado toasts which was a generous portion and also Instagram-worthy. This was an excellent breakfast and worth a little drive.",5-corG2RqN4iqamWfSLAPA,1,0,5,PbAnfRJcd8f73vy2BxARvQ

Literally 1 block away from ""The heart attack grill"", in this no man's land of carbs and lipids comes this very cute heaven of fresh and tasty food. I got the green goddess smoothie (yes, I know;) packed with spinach, kale, banana, mango, pineapple and a blend of power food like spirulina. I asked extra chia seeds and they just added it free of charge. Additionally I asked blueberries and avocado on the side that they sparkled with chia seeds. On top of serving tasty and good food, these guys were very happy to make something that wasn't on the menu. Affordable, good, healthy and strongly recommended!

5265998,2017-07-14,0,1CaM8eIvl41l4f3V-V-cAw,"My partner's attention was caught one day when we were passing by the Donut Bar (or maybe it was a new business ad on Yelp... who can remember?). Point being, this kind of place is right up our alley, since he is a vegetarian and I'm not, and this place has something for both of us. Admittedly, I'm not such a health food nut as he is, but I love me some smoothies. 

We were originally attracted to their claim on Dole Whip, but their machine hadn't been delivered yet, so we were mildly disappointed. Af first. Their menu is still evolving, and they have a few ""off menu"" smoothie bowls that caught our attention. 

I had the acai bowl, topped with chia seeds, granola, and blackberries. It was delicious, and the bowl was a decent size. It could have used some more blackberries, simply because they are one of my all time favorite berries!

The owners, I presume, were very, very courteous and helpful. We enjoyed their service immensely. They even offered to try to fake he Dole Whip, without the soft serve machine, but we declined so they didn't have to go through extra effort for something they don't even serve yet. The gesture was appreciated, though. 

I can't wait to see what else is in store for this up and coming business.
