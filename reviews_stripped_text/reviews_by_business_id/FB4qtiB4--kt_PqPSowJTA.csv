It arrived within 10 minutes, included miso soup, a beautiful greens salad, nicely sized sushi and roll. I especially liked that the sushi fish to rice ratio was to my liking ( too many places have a large clump of rice, this was just right). It was all delicious. Admittedly there were not many clients there so the attention we received might not be the norm. A great meal, just the right amount of food.

The proportion of fish to rice was excellent, and the variety of dishes great. I started out with the baked bay scallop appetizer, which was baked scallops with bacon and cheese in a little cast iron skillet but then went on to tuna, salmon, eel, and masago nigiri where the fish extended beyond the rice underneath. The spicy scallop hand roll was the largest I've ever had (it was as big as my hand) and the specialty rolls were delicious. Definitely try the I Love Starbucks roll if you come here. (Don't worry... It doesn't have coffee in it). The staff were friendly and attentive and the decor was clean and comfortable.",-9R1ETuc2CBaxRP4zg2iUw,0,0,5,kP0XXUQCmb2zI-cyjlNh_A

It's a huge restaurant but was slightly empty around 1pm. We were seated immediately after we arrived. Our server was very quick and attentive, and took our drink orders right away.

We opted for the A.Y.C.E (All you can eat) for lunch. Reasonable/competitive prices with those of near by sushi restaurants. Portion sizes were generous. Taste of sushi was so-so. Not great, but not bad. If you like Tuna, I would say majority of the rolls were tuna based. 

While I can't say this is the go-to spot for me, I wouldn't mind coming back here in the future.",STxhzIJC0q_iXrNrg8vZzg,0,1,3,MQsplDr6bBjPg22uuWqvbA

1352450,2017-09-30,1,FB4qtiB4--kt_PqPSowJTA,"Came here for dinner with some friends to try out this new place. Apparently this is a sister restaurant to Blue Fin Sushi on Sunset on the east side of town and 8 Ounce KBBQ. This location took over the old spot for Kobe sushi. 

I've never been to Kobe previously but the decor currently is pretty nice. Very open location with a bar (drinks) and sushi bar. We were a party of 5, with one super late as he misunderstood and drove to Egypt, i mean the east location. XD Since it was fairly early (630P) and it wasnt busy, they gave us a huge booth to sit at. 

We were instantly seated after we arrived and had the waitress come to take drink orders almost immediately. Service was pretty good overall. Very attentive in terms of drinks and orders. 

---------------------

Soft Shell Crab Tempura - Half a soft shell crab per order - Not bad. Lightly battered. Served over a small salad bed. 

(1 order per person for items below)
Grilled Yellowtail Collar (wasn't available - sold out)
Rib Eye Steak - Served on a hot plate of maybe 4-5 slices with onions - Not bad of an appetizer. Had some fatty pieces. Flavored well. Not overcooked but not exactly medium rare either Lol. 
Oyster - 2 pieces per order - Huge oysters. A bit fishy in smell and taste. At least they were clean and had no sediment. 

(Nigiri)
Tuna, Super White Tuna, Salmon, Halibut, Ikura, Masago, Unagi, Uni (limited 1 order per person)

Overall, the nigiri were decent. The ikura was mildly ""less fresh"" than expected as the balls were a little deflated. Our 2nd order of salmon somehow became salmon belly, which was nice. Lol 

Salmon avocado handroll - A LOT of salmon diced with some avocado. Friend was like, wheres the avocado? XD 

Over The Rainbow - essentially otherwise known as a ""rainbow roll"". Assorted fish topped on a california roll. 

(Dessert) - Supposedly its unlimited. We will see how long this lasts Lol 

The ice cream mochi seems pretty decent. Mochi skin is nice and chewy. The honey toast is made with hawaiian bread with a scoop of ice cream on top. Didn't really get to try others. Saw the tempura green tea ice cream. Looked pretty decent

---------------------

Overall, good was decent. Service was great. The rice to fish ratio is pretty decent, still incomparable to some places in Cali which is ridiculous (rice so small and fish so big, the fish can wrap around the rice completely). Fish overall is pretty fresh and clean. 

Some downsides are like, hot tea is served in a pot, vs refilled as needed per cup like other places. Hot tea becomes lukewarm pretty fast unfortunately with the use of a pot for them. Convenient but loses its temperature pretty fast. The soy sauce seems to taste weird to me and my friend. I tried tasting both the green top and red top soy sauces and it seems much diluted and seemed to taste somewhat sweet? it was weird. Its at the point that we thought we should bring our own soy sauce. Price i think is a little bit higher than some competitors but is more convenient and less packed.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,0,3,1H677DGyMjKTy2FtpF74xQ

Would hav given 4.5 stars if there was an option. took off 1/2 a star for flavor of a few items that I'm sure weren't their fault. oysters themselves did not offer much in the taste category even though the sauce was great, also the ""no rice roll"" was wrapped with raddish instead of cucumber like the ""naruto roll"" at jjanga that i love and didn't offer much flavor, steak was only so-so but it is not a steak restaurant (what did i expect?). HOWEVER, service was Great! our orders arrived relatively quickly, everything else I tried was delicious!!! AND no extra charge for hot tea or ""fresh wasabi"".
Fish to rice ratio: definitely more fish than rice

Love exploring new spots for work lunches and our first visit here was so good that it inspired us to come back. 

This place is HUGE. It's also clean and has some fun decor touches. 

The food has been really great. NOTE: my review is only based on the bento boxes during lunch time. The value is out of this world. You get so much tasty food for a very good price. Average for lunch is about $9 per person. The teriyaki chicken bento comes with a good amount of rice and chicken, side salad with ginger dressing, 4 piece Cali roll, egg roll and macaroni salad. Not into the macaroni salad so that's the only thing I don't eat. 

The service is hit or miss. First time was quick and second time was extremely slow and they forgot one of our poke bowls. Third time was on the slower side as well but we got all our food.

Unlike many all you can eat sushi restaurants this one is a little more upscale and the staff is extremely friendly. 

Among the dishes we tried were the soft shell crab which was so good that we had to order a second one. Crazy Jalepeno, Screaming Orgasm, Seaweed Salad, Salmon Sashimi, a Salmon Skin Hand Roll which could and should win an award, the RM Special Roll and the Raiders Roll which was on par with the quality and award winning taste of the hand roll. The sauces and quality of all of the above was spectacular. The only dish we had that we weren't crazy about was the Rainbow Roll. It didn't look as appetizing as the rest and it had a tart taste. Not fishy. Just tart.
We finished with Tempura Ice Cream. I have never tried it before and it was incredible. A must try.

We have been to other all you can eat restaurants around Las Vegas and they were all good but this experience was just a little touch above. I rarely give five stars but for an all you can eat sushi restaurant, this one deserves it.",n0mvVYcr4FR5l4Jh7B-dFg,0,0,5,6nTNnRC2Ivrg87SXQ0LmrA

For a restaurant that was busy and only opened a week they had a hard night to keep up...think they were overwhelmed. I DO NOT recommend this place to my parents, my best friend or anybody that I care about. The food was mediocre, the service was absolutely terrible in that it took 3 tries to get a child's order right. The kitchen staff was told by the server several times of the allergy but still failed to comply; it's been decided that they can't read or follow directions. When asked for a manager no one showed up probably because I wasn't looking straight at our server, Alvin and he chose not to listen.  We didn't ask for my child's food to be comped but he offered it anyways because of the lack of service we received, but when the bill came it was never taken off; husband forgot to check so our loss not the business.

When I walked into the restaurant I liked the whole atmosphere, but I was not greeted by anyone. Waiters and waitresses kept walking past my boyfriend and I with no one greeting us or coming up to seat us.  Probably after a minute or so we were seated. The woman who sat as was very nice and had a huge smile, which kind of made of for the wait (which btw the restaurant was NOT busy) My boyfriend and I did AYCE dinner for $26.99 which is pretty average so I found nothing wrong with the prices. For our first order we ordered three appetizers and two rolls. Probably 5-10 minutes later, one appetizer and both rolls came out. I thought, ""Okay probably cos they have to cook the other two they'll be out in a bit"". Nope. We had finished everything and had waited about 20 minutes for our waitress (woman with short red & black hair) to come back to us to place another order and ask about our two appetizers missing. When she finally came around I asked her about our appetizers and she goes to the back to check (or I'm guessing put a new order in). She then never came back to tell us what happened to our food. About 10-15 minutes later (we still didn't get to order other rolls) she comes out with our two other appetizers. She almost didn't take our other order if I didn't stop her from walking away from us. After those two other rolls we ordered came out, she stopped serving us and a waiter named Ron began waiting us. He was great and I wish I could've I had gotten him in the beginning.

It was around 10pm so the kitchen was closing an hour later so we decided to order the all you can eat sushi because it made more sense to go that route, versus trying to order all types of entrees. The best part about the AYCE is that everything is available! I had multiple miso soups. multiple bacon wrapped scallop orders, and sushi rolls on top of sushi rolls!

3214914,2018-01-26,15,FB4qtiB4--kt_PqPSowJTA,"From the people who brought you Blue Fin on East Sunset comes BF Sushi!!  I like to tell myself that BF stands for bestfriend and not Blue Fin.  The restaurant took over the space vacated by Kobe Sushi Bistro.  Got in a little before 6pm on a Friday night.  The place was pretty dead.  I think there was just 1 other table seated.  It looks even emptier because the restaurant is really large.  So here we are, eating our food.  Staff was super friendly and gave great service.  With our heads buried in our food and the menu, when we got up for air an hour later, we noticed that the place was more than half full.  Not too bad I thought.  The whole time people kept piling in, our level of service never changed.  Kudos for that!

We had AYCE, of course.  I was happy that they had hamachi kama, seems like a lot of AYCE places ""run out"" of it.  When our nigiri sushi arrived, I thought to myself that the pieces of fish were on the smaller side, compared to other AYCE places.  Then I lift the fish to check out the rice portion and boy was I surprised.  You get a tiny nugget of tasty sushi rice.  I'd say the fish to rice ratio was as good as it gets in the Vegas valley. 

Here is a rundown of what we ordered:

APPETIZERS:
baked green mussels
soft shell crab tempura (half a crab per order)
shrimp tempura
screaming orgasm
shumai (they come fried)
gyoza
spicy garlic edamame (very garlicy)
chicken karaage (overcooked and hard)
bacon scallop skewer
bacon asparagus skewer
salmon skin salad
udon
oysters

ROLLS:

blue fin special
rock and roll (no rice)

NIGIRI:

garlic tuna
hamachi
uni
amaebi (with the heads)
halibut

DESSERT:

green tea tempura ice cream

Needless to say, we all left very full and very happy.  Everything is delicious, except for the chicken karaage.  I will be back and recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a solid AYCE place.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,28,26,4,AqfpuuKhi0XjXrKmHkWC9Q

Likes:
1. They have yellowtail collar included in the AYCE and it was tasty (if you want this, ask first if they have it before you sit down. We asked and were told they only had one. We were there for an early dinner at 4 PM and the restaurant is supposed to be open until 11 PM. My friend stated that fact and pretty much complained and asked the waitress to check again. She finally came back and said they're cutting a new one, so we could each have one LOL).
2. All of the fish I tried tasted fresh. Uni also tasted fresh.
3. Sushi rice portion on the nigiri was on the small side.
4. They have specials (ask them). We had salmon belly and yellowtail belly.
5. They have oysters (2 per person). 

Dislikes:
1. Seaweed salad tasted a bit fishy.
2. Baked mussels were awful. They cut it in half and baked it in a lot of mayo. It was flavorless and just tasted like baked mayonnaise.

Lunch is $21.99 and dinner is $26.99. Service is all around good. The place is spacious and looks really clean.

Our absolute favorite was the rock and roll roll (it has no rice). Oh man, the flavors were awesome. You could tell the fish was fresh and each flavor complimented another. We orders two of those! I wasn't a fan of their baked green mussels. I like cheese but their version was too cheesy for me so I just ate the mussels. The mussels were good and I definitely enjoyed them. My favorite thing about their menu is the all you can eat dessert which includes mochi ice cream! Ugh, every single sushi restaurant I've visited has limited the mochi to just one serving but BF sushi lets you order as many as you'd like. I had their strawberry and mango and enjoyed both flavors. My boss orders their strawberry and vanilla ice cream dessert and damn near licked the bowl so I'd say she enjoyed it. Ask for their fresh wasabi, it's AMAZING. First time I've had fresh wasabi and it's a totally different experience which I recommend you try.

In summary, we came here to get the AYCE at lunch time. The rice on sushi and rolls were very inconsistent. The service was also inconsistent. 

To further explain my experience, the rice we had initially or our first 3-4 rolls/nigiri were very wet. Meaning that you cant even distinguish the rice pieces individually as they were mushy. I am not a pro sushi chef but I think that's not the way it should be. And then, we ordered a few more nigiri and the rice in there was undercooked. You could see the individual rice pieces, but at the same time was very chewy and hard to eat cause the fish is long gone before you can swallow the rice(the rice serving wasn't even that much). 

As for the service, we had 2 orders taken in our first 30mins. After that, we had to wait 30mins to get an attention from one of the employees. My mom literally had to hand out a piece of paper containing our written order to their manager because nobody else would pay attention to us. It was my first time to experience a service where all the staff ignores you. They might've not done it intentionally, but that's how they treated us.

On the good side, this resto has a very good fish quality. Very fresh and not overseasoned.

Edit: To add to my statement, the other customers which didn't have AYCE got better service. So, please be mindful when coming here to get AYCE.",GoBQ8KX2Fc-Xm1D_TjLIWQ,0,0,2,Qwt53KDrOSRIRCKtMxco4g

And it doesn't help that the last time I tried a new AYCE sushi spot I was far from impressed... 

When I learned that BF Sushi took over the old Kobe Sushi location on Rainbow I was cautiously curious, when I realized the BF was in reference to Blue Fin Sushi on Sunset I was convinced to give it a try... and I am SO glad I did. A coworker and I had AYCE lunch at BF Sushi on a recent Friday afternoon.

Everything that bothered me about the last all you can eat sushi spot I tried was a non-issue here. 
-1/2 rolls available? Check.
-All You Can Eat sushi menu just as diverse as the a la carte menu? Check. 
-Dessert included with AYCE? Check. 

The items that we ordered were all excellent. I was happy to see the riceless roll I enjoyed at Blue Fin on the menu at BF. Awesome fish to rice ratio on the nigiri sushi. Make sure to get the honey toast for dessert! 

Service was excellent. Our main waiter had a great personality and the people that were supporting him were efficent and friendly. Drinks were refilled quickly and we had no long waits in between the items that we ordered. Empty plates removed from table in a timely manner. 

I am very pleased that we didn't decide to play it safe and go to our normal sushi spot for lunch, BF Sushi is legit and I will definitely be back.

We ordered a variety of nigiri, sides, and rolls. I think my favorite from the nigiri menu is the garlic tuna & garlic yellowtail. That garlic sauce on top really adds wonderful flavor to the fish. I wouldn't say everything tasted super fresh... but it wasn't bad. The fish to rice ratio is ideal but some of the rice was really dry. I tried the spicy salmon tar tar cos I saw some raving reviews about it. However, i wasn't a fan. It needed something else on it? Idk, but it lacked a certain something. They have a good amount of desserts but can't order more than one.

They offer half-rolls on most of the non-baked stuff so you don't over commit and get to enjoy more of their offerings without getting full on their rice.

Favorite dishes: uni (one per person with ayce), ribeye steak, yellow tail collar, yellow tail hand roll, Blue Fin Special, Over the Rainbow, Hawaiian Honey Bread dessert and Rock and Roll (fresh and no rice!)

Liked: service, interior design, clean bathroom

Disliked: Gangnam style roll (it was swimming in a weird sauce that wasn't enyoyable) and their tempura ice cream (the green tea ice cream was icy, and tasted watered down)

4991090,2017-11-07,0,FB4qtiB4--kt_PqPSowJTA,"First off, BF sushi is substantially better than the restaurant that it replaced.  I think everyone nearby appreciates the upgrade.

Interior decor: 5 Star
Service: 5 Star
Lunch special price: 5 Star
Food: 3 Stars

The new restaurant has this modern and cool kind of look.  It's probably the nicest restaurant in the entire plaza.  It's also super clean, which is an important consideration for a sushi joint.  

Service was also prompt.  The servers made frequent rounds and picked up spiked plates and trash moments after I was done.  They were also discreet when they came by.  Just close enough if I needed by not so close that it felt intrusive.  It was the kind of place where everyone helps out - so when my main server was busy, another one would walk by and take a peak to see if I needed anything.  Dare I say service here was comparable to a five star resort.

I had the two roll lunch special, which was a selection of two rolls, miso soup, and salad for $8.99.  Considering that's how much it costs for a large cold sandwich elsewhere in the plaza, I'd call it a pretty sweet deal.  

I ordered the California roll and salmon roll as my two sushi choices.  Unfortunately food is where BF failed to impress.  For some reason, the rice had a very powdery texture, it kind of just disintegrated into tiny chunks.  I did not enjoy that.  For the salmon roll, the salmon portion size was great, but the salmon itself was really chewy.  The California roll was..well... imitation crab, cucumber, and avocado, so no way to mess that up.

Overall I would probably come back again simply because I work in the plaza and it would be awesome to have sushi for lunch once in a while.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,4,0,4,qFO-hOa1iozK3Bm_d5XjNw
5070871,2018-02-06,0,FB4qtiB4--kt_PqPSowJTA,"This was my first time here.  I was very glad to see it wasn't cramped inside. Unlike other places when 2 or 3 parties come in, the service gets slow and food starts coming out slow.  This was not the case here at all.  The place was very spacious, very nice decor, and food came out at a steady pace. 

Service:
Fast
Friendly
Accurate
My iced green tea was not only delicious and was a nice dark green (not watered down) and it stayed filled.

The menu had a very nice variety to choose from, and I liked that it was not copied from other places.  They do make half rolls upon request. They also had their own unique rolls to pick from without it all just being crab meat.  

Beware though if you try the crispy rice cracker spicy tuna appetizer, it's really good but it's sort of a big portion for an appetizer.  

Quality and taste was excellent.  Sushi chef's were fast too.  I was a little disappointed that they don't have a stamp card but it's not a deal breaker by any means.  

I absolutely recommend trying this place.  I will DEFINITELY be back.

We went to BF the other day and had no idea the two were related. For starters, the inside is huuuuge, or at least it felt huge. It is nicely decorated, clean, etc... they do have AYCE. As stated by another reviewer previously, the menu isn't extensive but the quality makes up for it. You are allow d to order half rolls for most items which allows you to try more than you usually would. They have Spicy Garlic Tuna which was incredible. We had a few rolls, goyza, salmon, tuna, and a couple drinks. Rolls were delicious, sushi cuts of fish to rice ratio was very impressive. The non-AYCE places I have been to have huge cuts of fish and a thimble of rice underneath. BF Sushi was right in line with that, I couldn't believe how big the fish cuts were for AYCE. Service was great and friendly as well and very attentive. The only issue, and maybe it was just completely me, but I was charged for a club soda. Not a Perrier or Pellegrino, but a carbonated water from their gun. I don't believe I have ever been charged for a club soda from the beverage gun before so I found that a bit strange... other than that a great experience and would definitely go back!",uDTZyEVjd0sMHSiMt7FgEA,0,0,4,q7XxPe7nuYb5TYUt1aIJ2Q

The prices are resonable. I ordered the Blue Fin special and it was boring!! It had no flavor to it. The Cajun Albacore they used it's like they smothered it in a mexican seasoning. It ruined the roll! My friend got the Over The Rainbow roll and she also said it was boring. Also the sushi rolls just completely fell apart!!! They weren't rolled tight enough. We still ate it though because we were hungry. I wouldn't come back here. I love sushi and this is by far the second worst place I have come to!

When we sat down, I was pleasantly surprised at the menu selection. It reminded me of the very popular Goyemon. My husband asked if they could sear a lot of the fish since I'm pregnant and shouldn't be eating raw. And the waiter said, of course! What a game changer! I've never been to a restaurant that was so accommodating. Basically, they would prepare 2/3 of a dish raw, and sear a bit of it for me. Isn't that great?!

Not only was the selection great, but the quality of the rolls, and nigiri was delicious! The rice was tiny and the pieces were small. This is great in an AYCE so you can have room to try a lot of other things. The fish was super fresh as well. 

I also need to commend the service. We ordered and the food came out within 5-10 mins I think! Empty plates never sat on the table very long. And the waiter kept coming to check on us. We felt so special! 

First visit and BF Sushi is already my favorite AYCE in Vegas! Way better than a lot of the older more popular ones around town. And since the restaurant space is huge, the wait time is negligible.

Today I ordered several different nigiri, Over The Rainbow roll and salmon skin salad. The sushi chef offered me a yellowtail sashimi special on the house which was quite tasty! The fish to rice ratio was perfect. It was probably only about less than tablespoon or so of rice to the fish which were good portions as well. I didn't care too much for the salmon skin salad. It actually tasted burnt and I can still taste the burnt charcoal taste in my mouth after downing water and eating more sushi. The over the rainbow roll was perfect. Variety of fish and not overwhelmed by too much sauce or rice.

I thought the nigiri to rice ratio was generous compared to other all you can places. The yellow tail nigiri was my favorite. I also thought they gave a really generous portion of the salmon skin salad. The desserts we're not limited to one dessert per person which was nice when compared to other sushi restaurants. 

Overall, the rice on each nigiri piece was not overwhelming which was great. The appetizers we ordered were really good and the salad we ordered was a good size.
