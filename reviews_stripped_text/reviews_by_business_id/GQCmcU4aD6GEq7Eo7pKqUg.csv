I live super close to this Wendy's and used to come here constantly for the spicy chicken nuggets. I was addicted. Those were my favorite. I would even order for the next day. I used to say I loved it here but I guess it was JUST because of the spicy chicken nuggets. 
When they removed them from the menu it broke my heart. 
I stopped coming for a few months until I got some coupons in the mail. 
I ended up buying the spicy chicken sandwich to see if it was anything like the nuggets. I actually went back and told them they gave me the wrong one..they didn't. I don't see how it was ""spicy"" at all. 
Then I bought a regular burger with the coupon. Buy one get one free. It was just fine. 
I went again today for the Chicken tender deal and I honestly think it made me sick. The chicken tenders were not good at all. They are super rubbery. The fries were great lol. 
I think this is my last time going. Super sad since I used to love it. If they ever come back with the spicy nuggets I will definitely be returning. Until then I'll stick to other places.",HLxTwrrNrEfLNNsw2liSuA,0,0,2,waf27_lGO1fppRVcl4lbkw

We struggled for a couple minutes in the drive thru, people waiting for us to leave so they can place their order, not bothering to give just 1 more set of hands, even though that's all we needed. That was until Josh came to the rescue. Josh is the manager at this location. Without him we wouldn't have got the SUV to the gas station in great time. That was a good deed for him to do that. He could've sent a lower level employee out to help us but he did what leaders do, and took initiative. He deserves to be at a high position, if possible, higher than where he's at.

Justa  few months ago this Wendy's was pretty plain (like most of them), now they have a better looking interior, they have a soda fountain machine with 1000 different flavors, and they have Televisions so like today I can watch Baseball or whatever else may be on.  I really like the fact that they now have a public soda machine so I don't have to go to the counter and ask for a refill which I always thought was the dumbest thing about Wendy's.  Wendy's has improved their food as well.  I really like the Baconator and the son of Baconator.  The new Pretzel bun burgers are pretty good too.  I ordered the Son of Baconator today and with small frries and a drink cost around $7.  Based off the size of the burger and the taste I think it was well worth the price.  Of course they still have the same old yummy frosty and several other inexpensive food chaices as well.  I get tired of eating all the same old burger places all the time, but Wendy's is a good choice when you are on a quick lunch run.

What can one say about a fast-food restaurant, really?  Prices are inexpensive, especially the value menu, food is consistent with others in the same chain (as expected), and there are actually healthy options which eases the guilt in purchasing and consuming fast-food.  This Wendy's has a cool soda pop dispenser that elevates the acquisition of your carbonated beverage to quasi-video-game status...sort of.  The buttons on the interactive screen make it fun to get your drink, IMO, but I guess I'm just nerdy.

We sat up near the front window and for a while the smell was not so bad. We did identify the smell of raw sewage, and when we complained to a worker we were told they were working on the men's bathroom (they were not). They had just put an out of order sign on the door. After a few minutes of trying to endure this we asked to speak to the store manager, who eventually came out. He seemed surprised by our complaint, even though it was vile. They had screwed up two of our orders,which he offered to replace, but by that time we had lost our appetite, and thrown the food in the garbage. I asked repeatedly for the name of the store owner, which I was never given. I insisted the store should have been closed until the problem was resolved. Finally, begrudgingly, they gave me the name of the district manager, Dave Desz. He said he would check into it. It was obvious he didn't care at all, because if he had he might have asked for my phone number to tell me how it was resolved. Or, at the very least, offered to refund the cost of our lunch.

Wendy's scores major points because their drive-thru lines are the fastest in the business. More often than not, you are served promptly and correctly.

Even at this restaurant, that is usually true. However, at this restaurant, they seem to have a difficult time telling the difference between milk, Frostys, and Frosty Shakes. Numerous occasions I ordered a Frosty Shake, only to have them try to give me a regular Frosty at the pick-up window - and on at least one occasion they were standoffish when I explained this to them. Other times, I have ordered a chocolate milk, and they respond with something like ""what kind of Frosty did you want?"" I NEVER once used the word Frosty.
