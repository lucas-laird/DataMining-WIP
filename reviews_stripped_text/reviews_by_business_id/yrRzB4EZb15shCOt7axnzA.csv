They were very friendly when we got there.  Food was ok but I thought it was overpriced.  I ordered the vegetable soup with pounded yam and specifically said no stock fish. My soup showed up with stock fish. I barely touched my food. My husband's egusi soup was better. At the end of our meal we were slapped with a $15 bill for stock fish that was put in our soups and we didn't really touch. My son requested no meat in his okra soup and guess what,  he got a bowl full of meat that he refused to eat.  Ok experience but not enough to warrant a return visit.",7ZUBYHUbWSSyXJipY5HNlA,4,0,2,ROIK3Vl7jmOTQftEtTZMqg

Ordered online through Yelp, did not receive confirmation of order, called restaurant and the response was ""we don't have a contract with Yelp so I don't know what you're talking about."" Placed the order anyhow to pick up 1 1/2 hours later. Arrived at restaurant, which is very much a whole in the wall type of place, no a/c, lights were not on, and no one in the place. Rang the bell for service and was greeted by a woman who told me that the beans were not ready and that if I wanted to ""wait 20 minutes they might be ready, but probably won't be ready for a while."" She then asked if I wanted the half of my order that was ready. I said no thank you.",r-Pw_QQ4zcvDMC_cdpq9jQ,3,0,1,SfTGtzeHOe4kOX4XIfhidg

First of all nobody welcomed us or sat us, and it looked like they didnt have any lights on coz the ambiance was very dark. A gentleman came and took our orders, and told us it will take 10-15mins for the food to come out coz we were a little pressed for time as we had an appointment to be at in 1hr. Anyways, as you can guesss... the food took 1hr to come out. And after waiting all that time and missing our appintment, it tasted horrible! This is not African food, coz real african food doesnt taste like this.

You have just traveled to Nigeria.  It is a hole in the wall,  there is no decor, no greeter to seat you, no time limits on food.   Throw everything you know out the window.  Eating here is an experience and chuck it up as that, just go in,  humor them, eat your meal and be out because it is strictly about the food there not the dining experience.   Their food is very flavorful.  A bit expensive for the amount of meat given and the variety on the menu is not always available so they may try to pull one meat off for another, but if you were in Nigeria they'd probably do the same so it's okay, it's all part of the experience,  LMAO.

You order at the counter and after haggling over their non-existent choices of meals and poultry (beef beef and beef) the young man tells me my order is going to take 15min. 15 mins turns to an hour and I'm sitting there staring into space. No one checks up on me nor updates me on my order. Enters the food...simply put, it was the most ridiculous mediocre expensive piece of crap ever.

3635530,2012-01-14,11,yrRzB4EZb15shCOt7axnzA,"Was in the neighborhood driving by and spotted a sign for Nigerian cuisine in a little ethnic strip mall. Wasn't really hungry but shoot I've ever had Nigerian food before. I'm curious and I pull over and pay the restaurant a visit. I enter with who I assume is the owner is watching Nigerian TV is also the cook and server. She tells me that they've been open for six weeks. I peer over the menu, unfamiliar with everything the owner recommends jollof rice with choice of stewed meat: goat chicken, fish, beef or a mixture of beef and goat. Craving something more gamey opted for the goat and wash it down it a Vitamalt (Nigerian coke). 

She heads back to the kitchen after taking my order and out she comes with one plate containing a rather slim, boney portion of meat and another plate containing the jollof rice topped with several slices of plantain. I'm disappointed by the small portion of goat in comparison to the larger rice plate I receive. Strangely one portion of the goat is falling off the bone tender while others are a little tougher. The rice on the other hand is nice and fluffy, reminding me of Spanish rice. The plantains are nicely cooked with their bark brown caramelized edges. Solid. Decor is sparse with the exception of a flat screen and considering that I was the only patron in the restaurant, I would've liked a little more attention. Seemingly a little distant, I got the vibe that perhaps she wasn't used to seeing an Asian cat dining at a Nigerian spot. All good though, I'll be returning soon as I'm in that neighborhood every week. Hopefully I don't face the same experience next time I try their other offerings.",E19IMURE4WEoCnvDx-bylg,7,4,3,3BtmnbYjQ5MF0LgvJ5R95A

The nonchalantly comes out and says ""we are not open"". Very poor customer service not explaining why they were not open nor did he offer to bring us in to at least sit down. Another guy comes out 30 mins later and says there were open. We walk back in and I see a different guy and I politely ask him "" Are y'all open"" and he replies ""Is the door open""? What an asshole I will never be back here and I hate it because I think they changed owners.
