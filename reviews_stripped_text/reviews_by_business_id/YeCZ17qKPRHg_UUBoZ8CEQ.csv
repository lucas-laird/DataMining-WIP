Other than that, the tables (gambling kind) are kind of a joke and the rooms here... well, stay somewhere else.",06xIElWq6CAvmtk1xHJWNA,0,0,4,eUCMjT8pu73ctBWvCYVLBA

First we made the mistake of getting off the elevator on the 5th floor which had been completely gutted for remodeling. No wallpaper, no carpet, nothing but a lamp with no shade on the floor and an impending feeling of doom. (our room was on another floor)

We were woken up to a giant jackhammer on the floor above us at 7am. We then had to go through hoops to get moved to the 2nd tower which was not under construction.

The restaurant staff told us a meal would be comped and then tried charging for us. The supervisor argued with us and basically told us we were lying.

When he went in the back we stole the food. 


It's now the Hooters Hotel and Casino. The construction is reportedly over, but as god is my witness i will never step  foot in that building again.",WFrSwPOa1Fd1HMfxXfVPkA,2,0,1,hvi7ckzjCP-ZZhfxfjuGgw
