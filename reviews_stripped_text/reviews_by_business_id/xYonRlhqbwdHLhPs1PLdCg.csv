The waitress was very nice, although too young to serve alcohol and was extremely inexperienced. We ordered an appetizer to share and 3 entrees, about 5 mins later we were told they didn't have ingredients for one of them. No problem, we changed the order and happily waited about ten minutes until they brought out 2 of the 3 entrees we ordered, telling us it'd be a bit longer as the 3rd was coming from a clay oven. The 2 with food started eating and shared our food with the 3rd, so she wouldn't faint with hunger. The entire meals were both completely finished, so we took the 3rd meal to go. No one over the age of 16 seemed to care that we weren't happy. We tipped the waitress 20% and will never be back.

The restaurant looks like it needs some finishing touches but that will come with time - we went for the food and were not disappointed!!! Btw, 'mild' has plenty of heat so use caution when ordering, depending on your tastes.
Tried plain Naan, Palak paneer and Chicken tikka masala - all awesome!!

The hostess said they are closing soon, but it's a buffet so we could still be served. The buffet had not been replenished in a while. Our water glasses were not filled until we had had time to get our food and sit down. We were told the naan would ""come with the buffet"" but wouldn't be made for us since they were closing for lunch. We asked why did she seat us if they weren't going to have a full service lunch? We ended up leaving without taking a bite and will not be back. Would not recommend based on terrible customer experience.

Surprisingly. the food was delicious.

I ordered vegetable samosas - which were beautifully spiced, and seemed freshly made - and Palak Paneer (also very good) - with lots of fried paneer, making for a very hearty dinner. 

The prices were reasonable and the portions were large. I will certainly come back to sample more of the menu.

Why not five stars?
Although the restaurant seemed clean and cared-for; The environment was neutral to the point of being bland. Certainly not every Indian place needs to have fancy tapestries or images of Hindu dieties. Modern and more Western decor is fine.  But the only things that even suggested ""India"" were the window facade cutouts and a TV screen silently playing dance numbers from Bollywood movies. Personally, I'd prefer a bit more 'character'.

1420398,2016-07-09,6,xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg,"Samosas, palak paneer, basmati rice, garlic naan, and gourmet cupcakes. Wait, what?! 

This is a great new Indian restaurant- they have a lunch buffet but definitely go for the good stuff at dinner. The chef is from OKC and is famous for his lamb, so keep those dishes in mind. They also have a case of cupcakes available for dessert, and their pastry chef is from the Venetian. Everything I've had here is great.

PAPADUM: Served at the table as you order, light and crispy with a vibrant mint chutney and a syrupy tamarind dipping sauce. This is gluten free, by the way.
VEGGIE SAMOSAS: Three to an order, pairs great with the mint chutney. This has a fresh, flaky exterior and a savory filling. I like that this version isn't hard and crunchy as elsewhere.
GARLIC NAAN: Four pieces of fresh, blistered naan with garlic and fresh herbs. Always gotta get a side of this.
PALAK PANEER: Generous portion of spinach and homemade cheese. I like to get one meat and one vegetable entree, and this is my go-to order. Really liked the version here, order medium for a bit of heat.
**LAMB SPECIAL**: This dish didn't have a name, but it's four lamb chops, marinated overnight and grilled fresh in a skillet with sliced peppers and onions, with a side of basmati rice. It's like an indian take on fajitas, served sizzling hot, and enough for two to share. This is some of the best lamb I've ever had, wonderfully seasoned and not gamey. This should be a permanent menu item, I'd definitely come back for it.
CUPCAKES: They had two flavors available on my visit, both had a moist cake and a rich filling. Frostings weren't too sweet, and was clearly real butter cream. An indulgent end to a heavy meal, but so worth the calories. 

Service was attentive and friendly throughout our visit, making recommendations and providing constant refills. Location is new and clean, buffet area for lunch looks large. Chef came out toward the end of our meal, told us about his background and thanked us for our visit.

2028753,2016-09-24,1,xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg,"I decided to try this restaurant based on the many positive comments and all I can say is, I would never return to this establishment. 

The restaurant appearance was satisfactory. Nothing special. We were coming to eat at the buffet and were seated at a table where I couldn't see the person sitting across from me because of the glare coming from the window. I asked to move to a different table. We were moved to a booth with a view of the kitchen and end of the buffet line. I am a thin person and could barely squeeze into the seat. Let's put it this way...I could not get a napkin on my lap because the table came one inch from my ribs!

The food.... 
I have never been to an indian buffet that did not serve samosas. That was disappointing. There was chutney available with a wilted salad but other than the small amount of salad on ice there were no appetizers. There was plain white rice that did not taste like the normal basmati....probably plain uncle ben type rice. The vegetarian options were chana masala which was fair. The only discerning flavor was pepper. I like hot but there was no flavor of cumin, cardimun curry or tumeric....just hot, I'd give it a 4. The potato curry dish was ok...again nothing special. All you could taste was black pepper. There was a paneer vegetable dish that had no vegetables except mushrooms (of which I've never eaten mushrooms in indian food before). Usually this dish is made with cauliflower and potatoes and the sauce was ok but there were no vegetables. I got this dish right after they put it on the buffet. It seemed they were trying to save money by just serving sauce! The dal was ok. I can say the nan was good (we requested plain instead of the garlic). The food on the buffet was mostly empty and not particularly hot. Most indian buffets serve kheer (rice pudding) and it was disappointing not to have kheer. There was a bread pudding that was pretty much the absolute grossest thing I have ever tasted. They were sooooo bad I had to spit it out into my napkin. Same thing with the desert balls gulab jamun.... so horrible!

When we walked into Paradise India the first though I had was it was an extremely large space with only a few people dining. Although this isn't a great atmosphere for a small dinner, I can imagine that a giant party or wedding would be a lot of fun at this location. We were immediately seated in front of a booth that made watching the Bollywood movie on the screen the center of our experience and I enjoyed it immensely. 

They don't have lamb korma which is a bummer! I had a mango lassi to drink and we split garlic naan, lamb kashmiri rogan josh, and lamb kadai. Everything was well cooked and tasted good. Although the presentation made it seem as if the portions weren't very big, my boyfriend and I still had a hard time finishing.

First, they should update their hours to show that they are closed before 5pm, not sure what time they open for lunch though which was annoying because I came at 4 and I was disappointed to see they were closed, however I don't take that into account when I rated them. I left and did something else and came back an hour later. I walked in at 5:05 and the waitress (young white woman with red lipstick)  was talking to another worker and it took her a few seconds to acknowledge us. She sat us down and didn't seem to know much about their menu and did not seem very happy to be there. The restaurant was completely empty, but there were many smears on our glass tabletop and when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, there was paper towels and trash on the floor. Our food came out about 30 mins after we ordered (lamb tandoori and kids burger and fries) and the lamb chops were under seasoned and a bit dry tbh. I was very disappointed. I had to ask for rice with it because she forgot to bring it out the first time I asked her. I was really annoyed at this point because I wanted to get some cupcakes for my kid (which were in a display close by) and she said their pastry chef was out of town for a few weeks. Like, why even display those if ur pastry chef is gone for that long?? 

The kids burger patty was hard and not juicy at all and the fries were limp. The portion for the lamb was average as I took leftovers home, although I had to get up and try to find her to ask for a box, as at this point I hadn't seen her for 10 mins after I was done eating. The mango lassi was amazing though!! Tart, sweet and perfect consistency. 

The other waitress who was there today (and a tall biggish guy who didn't introduce himself-maybe he was the owner?) were super nice though.

I yelped the place and called them and they told me Paradise would be open at 5 PM for dinner. I was relentless and I found some nearby stores as a distraction and returned promptly at 5 to find the door still locked. Another couple was waiting for the place to open. They knocked on the window and  the door opened around 5:10. I walked into a large space with an unfinished bar and plenty of seating. The hostess/waitress told me they had been open since June. I was shocked, looked at the menu, and ordered some traditional favorites to go. I don't know what's actually going on here but the lamb Korma was amazing. Spices just right along with true basmati rice, lentil soup (delish) and garlic nan. Not by any means cheap but portions were full of excellently prepared good that stayed fresh until I got home and consumed it with vigor.

She rarely leaves 5 star reviews unless it's some kind of events or in another states, usually 4 stars for even great restaurants in Vegas. I said to my self ""in order for her to rate this place 5 stars, THIS PLACE HAS TO BE FREAKING AWSOME.""  I had errands to do at the night, but I dropped everything and headed over to restaurant myself. I called before I got to this place to make sure they have ""The lamb special"". 

When this special lamb chop came out on a sizzling iron skillet, everybody in the restaurant turned their heads towards this dish. The guy sitting behind me came over and asked me ""Hey, what's that? That looks good."" The smell of it was so amazing. I knew this was going to be delicious just from looking at it.  
It was perfectly seasoned, cooked and prepared. I've had so many smelly, fatty, disgusting lamb chops at so many restaurants (even at a super expensive restaurant) but the lamb chops here are so tender, lean, juicy, flavorful and awesome. FREAKING AWSOME!! The sauce that came with it was nice and spicy. They brought out this sauce 5 minutes before the lamb came out. I tasted it with the spoon. ""OMG, I could drink this sauce like a soup!!"" It was warm and spicy. Tasted so addicting. I seriously wanted to take this sauce home to go, but I didn't. 

The owner chef, William Bathini came out from the kitchen. He asked me how I found this place. I pulled out the printed Yelp page from my purse and showed him the paper. (Yes I print out Yelp pages before I visit new restaurants. I'm old fashioned.) He really didn't know about Yelp... He didn't know his own restaurant receiving 11 solid 5 star reviews... (Oh, my.) I told him how amazing his lamb chops were. He told me that Steve Adams and the team mates from OKC Thunder (basketball) used to come to his restaurant and order ""9 dishes each"" of his lamb chops. (Wowza.) I believe it. I could have eaten 2 dishes probably. It was that good. Yes.

I also ordered Garlic naan. It was nice and fresh but I'm not gonna get in to it. I don't want my reviews to be super long. The lam chops really blew my mind.
Comer after 5 pm and try their lamb special!! It doesn't say anywhere but they close from 3 pm to 5 pm.
Again, I could have never never found this place without Yelp. I love finding out new restaurants through my favorite Yelpers. Love food, love Yelp and love my fave reviewers!!",RpLeX_kRHbrW5v5YH-R0nQ,8,5,5,gQcofKWrZt6jyXv90NZoUA

2803149,2016-09-26,11,xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg,"This review is for the lunch buffet only.  

My group of 6 showed up at 11:30.  We possibly could have had 10+.  So we picked a place & time that could accommodate us if we swelled up to 10+.  As it turned out, the others were too hung over to join us for lunch... thanks to the iHeartRadio Festival.  So we stayed a party of 6. 

Right at opening, we were the only ones there.  So, we were greeted and seated immediately.  I noticed right away the lack of scents.  Maybe the food wasn't ready??  But oh no, the food was already in the warming trays and we were invited to partake.  Hmmm...not sure I wanted to.  But, we were already there.  So...

I got a smattering of everything to try.  There wasn't much...goat curry, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, chili chicken, about 4 vegetarian dishes, & salad.  The waitress brought us a basket of regular naan & a basket of garlic naan.  They were warm & delicious.  The rest of the food though was rather lackluster.  There was no depth of flavors that I've come to expect from Indian food.   The spices were very subtle and left me unsatisfied. 

Those cupcakes that everyone else had raved about should make up for some of that dissatisfaction, right?  I saw some behind a case and asked our waitress how/if we could have some.  She said no.  Those were just for display and that the chef no longer makes/offers cupcakes.  Then why display it and tease me like that?!?!  Not cool :/

To make things worse, the chef stormed out of the kitchen at the end of our meal and reprimanded an employee  for mislabeling the food.  That was an uncomfortable moment.  My aunt actually pulled the chef aside and told him that that was an inappropriate way to handle the situation.  The chef agreed and apologized.  He explained that he has had trouble with this particular employee for months and has had enough. 

Let's recap...lackluster food, no cupcakes, employee drama, & $13.99/person.  Other reviewers paid $9.99 just a few weeks ago...higher price on weekends???  Who knows.  Didn't bother to find out.  We won't be coming back any time soon.",BsdMr3hnc44zZcD8PxgeSA,12,8,2,20OdpSzPq_us1VQRRxK17w

Basic entree using paneer is not even part of a single dish. Food is too spicy. Desserts are a joke. Rice pudding is boiled milk and rice served. Only other option was bread pudding quality poor. thought it was an Indian cuisine. Their Falooda is sugar syrup with milk and bits of noodles. Where was the icecream???

Paradise India offers a lunch buffet, even on weekends, which I opted for. The price is a little higher for weekend lunch buffet ($14.99, compared to $10.99 on weekdays), but I overheard one of the waitresses telling another patron that the weekend lunch includes an extra row of dishes on the buffet.

I opted for garlic naan, which did not cost extra. The naan was made fresh and very tasty, and I'm sure I could have asked for more, but one basket was sufficient (since I also had some rice from the buffet). 

The food itself was very tasty. I liked the spread of dishes, and some items that stood out to me (because I don't see them in buffets often) were the okra dish and eggplant dish. Once again, chilli chicken made an appearance on the buffet, which continues to support my theory that Vegas Indian buffets like to include this Indo-Chinese dish; I had never seen this dish when dining at Indian buffets in California or Virginia (though Indo-Chinese dishes were very common when I was actually in India).

There were also three desserts, more than I expected. I would have appreciated some fresh fruit as well, and maybe some samosas or pakora in addition to the puri so I had more to dip in the tamarind and mint chutneys. 

Nonetheless, I thought the food was great and the service excellent. My waitress checked on me regularly, and refilled my water multiple times.

The place has a pleasant atmosphere and gives off more of a modern cultural vibe, probably because of all the Indian pop music videos playing on TV screens. It can be quite mesmerizing! 

Dinner menu is more elaborate, so I definitely recommend giving this place a try for dinner.

3966514,2016-07-16,9,xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg,"This new Indian restaurant is only about four miles from home.  With the increase in people from India living in Las Vegas, a number of new Indian restaurants have opened near my neighborhood so that I don't have to go to the university area to enjoy Indian cuisine.  I came here today for the lunch buffet.  At $9.99, it's a good deal.

I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant and brought water and the mango lassi I ordered.  I then went up to make my first choices.  The silverware is at the area where you pick up your plate so I got that, took it back to the table, and then went to look at the food.  

A cursory look showed me that most of the dishes were vegetarian and so that's what I chose for my first plate.  Outstanding things for the first plate were the chana masala, palak paneer, and dal tadka. The chana masala and palak paneer had a nice spiciness to them, and I am a big fan of dal in almost all forms.  I went to the end of the buffet for naan.  I was disappointed in it because it was somewhat rubbery from sitting in the warming tray and the first piece had no butter taste to it at all.  In addition, the end of this particular piece was thick like a slice of pizza.  It made it impossible to rip off a piece to grab some dal.  Instead I had to use my fork.

For the second plate, I got some goat biryani, chicken korma, and onion fritters.  The goat was so so.  Nothing I'd get again.  The chicken korma had a good flavor but again trying to get a piece of naan to wrap around one of the chicken pieces was next to impossible.  The onion fritters were more like dipped onion rings in thick bread batter rather than what one normally thinks of when you see the word fritter.

For dessert I tried two things--bread pudding and rice flour halvah.  They were both interesting and something new.  The bread pudding was more moist and soft than what one normally thinks of bread pudding.  The better of the two was the halvah which was quite good and different from anything I've had before.  I did look for gulab jamun but there were none.  I didn't want a cupcake so this ended the lunch on a sweet note.

The deal breaker for me is the naan.  I have been to no lunch buffet in the area where the naan is left cut in a heating pan to keep warm.  Naan should be fresh and brought out when it's ready.  The buffet consisted mainly of vegetarian dishes which is OK.  There were 3 meat dishes--chicken korma, goat biryani, and tandoori chicken.  

I will try this place for an evening meal but I'll go elsewhere for a lunch buffet.

NOTE:  I got a communication from the chef/owner of Paradise India this evening explaining that some staff didn't show up for work today and that is why he put the naan on the buffet.  It is never his way of doing things as he was host and cook today.  This explains a lot and it gives me faith that my next visit will be more enjoyable!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,19,12,3,WS7S6sSLzzN2i1Lk7ms4dw

There were maybe only 4 or 5 tables taken.  Place was quiet!  Where is the TV?  Where is the Bollywood music & dancing?  It was like you could hear a pin drop.

Took a few minutes to get seated because no one was at the front near the entrance.  And once we did get seated there was no silverware near the plates so we had to wait for the basket to be refilled.

At the usual Indian buffet I frequent, every time I enter there is always the smells of spices, bread, something wafting in the air.  Is it my mistake that at Paradise India they had none of that?  For Indian curries/stews, don't most of them take a ton of time to make?  Hmmm...made me wonder, any of the stuff on the buffet line actually made FRESH today??  I'm no expert on Indian food but something was just...OFF.

I suspect my freshness meter was somewhat correct.  Almost everything tasted FLAT, like no burst of flavor or spices like I get from other Indian food I've tasted.  The flavors were muted, like these were leftovers from yesterday.  I of course can't prove that but the excitement of enjoying the spice just wasn't there.  It was all kinda MEH.  Chicken Tikka Masala was really kind of plain, the Tandoori Chicken was near cold and was dry.  The Spinach & Cheese was very lackluster, barely any flavor.  The Goat Biryani was OK but parts of the rice were either undercooked or had been sitting around the heat too long.  And really, where the HELL are the samosas?  I'm not trying to be funny, I like me some samosas with chutney or tamarind sauce!  Thought they would be standard fare.

Most disappointing for me?  The naan bread!!  Why didn't each table get a fresh baked basked of naan bread included with their buffet meal??  It was sitting on the buffet line instead...more limp than Ron Jeremy after party.  Just kinda SAD.  It was no fun trying to dip almost rubbery naan bread into lifeless entrees.  At that point we just ate to get a meal in.

The chef/owner approached us and asked us how everything was...and I mean I just couldn't.  I couldn't tell him it was all very bland for me...maybe it was an off day?  Maybe the regular cook was out?  I just don't know.  So we just kinda told him it was pretty good and left it at that.

We enquired about the cupcakes, which are strange because well...not many Indian places actually serve CUPCAKES.  They looked pretty but we were taken aback when we found out each one was like $3 I think.  I kinda figured one would be included with the buffet meal but that's OK.  Perhaps we'll try them on another visit?  If we do indeed visit again...

Price was on par with other Indian buffets in the area, at $9.99 per person plus tax.  Service for us was very slow though, took a while for plates to be cleared and water to be refilled.  It's probably because a server is hardly ever present in the dining area, ours kept only going back and forth to the kitchen, mainly staying in the kitchen.  

Sorry Paradise India, thought you would be a welcome alternative to our usual Indian haunt...but I guess we'll have to stay with them for now to get our Indian fix.  Keep trying!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,10,4,3,ZGU7pRWpmD7D_fOFingexg

Opened around two months ago in a large corner-space at 8125 West Sahara, Paradise India may seem at first like every similar concept to arrive in areas further East in recent years, but a closer look at the restaurant from William Bathini speaks of a softer, more nuanced side of Indian cuisine that may be just the sort of thing prone to delight fussy West Siders.

Open for both lunch and dinner, the former a bargain Buffet that is claimed to be one of the largest around, Chef Bathini speaks proudly of his heritage when describing an upbringing in one of his country's more traditional States, and having now spent some time in Washington DC furthering his skills in close proximity to some of America's best Indian Fine Dining establishments he hopes to now bring a piece of his home to the city of Las Vegas.

Inspired by tradition and taking steps to preserve the tastes of his homeland with dynamic spicing replacing the aggressive salting and heat that many associate with lesser restaurants, a quick look at Paradise India's menu speaks volumes by way of its relative brevity, the choices divided into omnivorous or meatless options with plenty to choose from, but not so much as to seem as if they are just shooting with buckshot or trying too hard to please.

Ranging from Tandoori and Curry to Biryani with a small Indo-Chinese section plus a few esoteric items speaking to regional influence, appetizers at Paradise range $5-10 and although the sampling was somewhat limited it is safe to say that fans of Poultry are likely to be happy whether they choose the  elegant Reshmi Kabab that sees tender Chicken breast wrapped around a mild Ginger and Onion filling or the more robust ""Chicken 65"" that eats something like a hand-breaded nugget upgraded by Turmeric, Cumin, Garlic and Red Chilies.

Having already gained praise for the Lamb Chops, a clay oven preparation that presents four bones full of meat on sizzling skillet with onions and peppers for $25, suffice it to say that as good as these are Vegetarians will not feel left out since the traditional Pav Bhaji may be even better as the spicy Onion stew is presented with griddled bread in sizable portion that is as delicious as it is hearty.

Acknowledging the need to please American palates, but not willing to compromise tradition by straying from the path, Bathini's Tandoori Chicken offers tender meat just barely clinging to the bones that it is served with, and although Tikka Masala and Korma are both offered elsewhere the texture of Paradise India's base comes across more subtle and creamy, the choice of whether to use Rice or Bread left to the diner, though those interested in something different are strongly encouraged to try the fluffy Omelet Roti that finds favorable comparison to a thin Spanish Torta.

Continuing the traditional approach with desserts, even the sold-out Bread Pudding apparently common in India due to ancient Persian influence, Gulab Jamun proved a bit too 'gummy' compared to previous experiences with the small Donuts in Honey while the Rasmalai and Sevya were each striking in their subtlety, the latter placing long-grain Rice in the context of a Pudding while the former was almost savory with fresh Paneer soaked in Cream, Fruit plus Nuts and a texture somewhere between Greek Yogurt and Cheesecake.

****Taking an approach that neither Casinos nor Off-Strip Restaurants seem ready to embrace, the idea of upscale Indian cuisine focused on authenticity rather than the 'American' expectation that seems to embrace tongue tingling heat and too much salt, Paradise India has started on good footing that should only improve as the recipes become fine-tuned and the word spreads.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,3,4,3Dn7YjTT4TGbV_DmD5irvg

William's dishes are on point and exactly what I remember.

We have never been disappointed here. And partner is always just staring at me as savoring every heavenly bite with sparkly eyes and child like excitement.

The dishes are spicier than at most Indian restaurants which tend to water things down for us Americans. I really liked their version of chanamasala. Good flavor for most of the curries. 

Things to improve on:
- Buffet items not kept hot enough.
- The rice used is of poor quality, short or broken grains and dry. Really missed fluffy hot basmati rice.
- No Indian desserts. No kheer or gulabjamen.

We gave it a try as it is close by but would rather drive further to get a better overall experience in Indian buffet.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,1,0,3,Zli7PbFEmGDOtNjRWHVVBQ
