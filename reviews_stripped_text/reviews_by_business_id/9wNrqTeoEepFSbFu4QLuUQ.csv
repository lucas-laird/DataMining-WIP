100695,2017-08-14,0,9wNrqTeoEepFSbFu4QLuUQ,"I'll start off by saying, we have had Melissa a few times now as our waitress, she sucks, tonight was no exception as she served myself and my family a brown lettuce salad, not a couple brown pieces, two whole plates of nothing but brown lettuce, enough for my 12 yr old daughter to ask,is my lettuce suppose to be brown? When I walked up to the front to ask her about it, she said she had no clue, they must've got a bad batch of lettuce from the produce guy, in which  I replied , would you eat it? I also told her that I had a bad vegetable one night that put me into anaphylactic shock in front of my kids, I was hoping that wasn't going to happen tonight!!!!! Instead of apologizing or offering new salads, I was told there was no brown lettuce back there, so,she didn't know what I was talking about!!!! I asked her if we were the only table then that were served it tonight? She kept trying to act like we wanted a free salad, really? What an ass, I told her I didn't appreciate it, and she was pissing me off, take it off our bill. She walked back to our table and then told us she checked the line, and all of the lettuce, she didn't know what we were talking about as she stood over our bowls of brown lettuce, we showed it to her.........her response, well I checked, I don't know what you're talking about,no apology yet, just trying to pick a fight. I told her I didn't appreciate her third lie about the brown lettuce, she was a fucking liar, and my husband told her get our stuff to go, why would you even serve that to a customer. She kept trying to talk really loud like we were saying something to her, I told her we are done with you you fucking liar get away from our table. She yelled really loud "" ma'am there our lots of families with kids in here, don't say those vulgar words, It's okay for the waitress to LIE to a customer and act like you're trying to get a free brown salad, and keep saying stupid shit to you, but don't cuss, you can lie, but don't cuss, Lol! What a joke, btw, the only kids in there were ours, 2 adults at the bar table, one guy in an orange shirt who I could hear her motherfucking us too, that's okay though, and a table of 3 adults, another lie by Melissa, there were no other kids, just our lying waitress. Upon using our groupon, I walked up to the register to give it to her to take it off the bill, didn't look at her, I waited to  get my phone back from her, silently, I was done!the whole time, she keeps saying  really loud, ma'am, please stop being so vulgar, there are kids in here, after about the 3rd time, and yes, you can check you're cameras Rosati's I stuck my hand up, didn't look at her, and said, ma'am, I'm done talking to you, you did nothing but lie,I'm waiting for my phone, my husband watched and heard the whole thing, after all was said and done,she charged us for our wing sauces, that we had to ask for, since she didn't even give them to us, cuz she was to busy being a jerk. she wasnt  supposed to be our waitress last night, it was a girl who had never waited on us, who she immediately got angry and kicked her right off the table, she knows we tip well, we actually could here her yell at her, did you take the drink order!, not nicely either. About a month ago, Lauren, another waitress, "" ask for her or Christy when you go in, much better experience, both sweethearts! "" had waited on us,we waited for our pizza for an hour, Lauren is coming out with it, when Melissa's yells at her to come back, only to take our pizza and give to her customers table, who had been sitting for maybe 15 minutes, no apology from Melissa, we watched the whole thing,you could hear her being Jerky to Lauren then as well, so, thanks to Melissa, 2 hrs later, we get our pizza to go. Wondering why you're place is slow, I would rethink having Melissa  serving people, doesn't care how she treats customers or fellow employees,doesn't care if she serves sub par food, obviously, steps on toes for the almighty dollar, the only reason she received the dollar and change tonight is, we round off, that's it. She got a dollar, and my husband and I both had the shits! Thanks Melissa! I will be calling the mgr. tomorrow to let him know  if that's the kind of help he wants serving his customers, we will no longer be frequenting Rosati's on Eastern.

I came in and ordered  to take out and while my pizza was ready in an acceptable time of 20 minutes the sandwhich and garlic bread  took another 20 minutes. All the while my pizza was sitting getting cold. The clerk kept saying ""just a few more minutes"". Clearly the kitchen staff is not trained on timing so all orders are ready around the same time. They are certainly good at socializing with each other because that is what they were doing instead of completing my order. The restaurant was not busy so they cant use that as an excuse.

It might be regional taste, but I like the cheese to the edge, square cut pizza. We ordered a large thin crust pizza, half classic combo and half pepperoni, bacon and garlic. The pizza was delicious, great cheese flavor and excellent marinara sauce. I would also recommend the appetizer ""nuggets.""  I pictured a garlic knot type app but it was little squares of pizza dough lightly fried, served with marinara and ranch.  Crunchy outside and tender inside.  So good.

1462179,2018-06-25,0,9wNrqTeoEepFSbFu4QLuUQ,"I wish I would give this location ZERO stars. The customer service and their ability to solve and even want to deal with problems is the absolute worst.
We found this location about a year and a half ago, have gone regularly since we like the food, and have even taken our out-of-town relatives to this location.  Everything was fine, until they really hit rock bottom for us.
Event #1:
We mistakenly ordered online on Easter Sunday (which, in the words of THEIR staff, should not have happened in the first place).  Drove 5 miles to find out they're closed.  Dumb mistake on our part - no harm, foul, we just need them to cancel the order so our card doesn't get charged.  We call first thing the next day and the owner AND one of their staff members assures us they cancelled the order and our card would not be charged.  What happened next?  Of course, our card got charged anyway, another phone call to a manager that didn't want to deal with us, and it still took almost TWO WEEKS for our money to go back into our account.
Event #2:
After the Easter situation, we were more than reserved to go back to this location, but, we're all about second chances.  So I phone order something, so the significant other can pick it up.  Simple - pizza +cannolis. He's almost already home when he looks, and NO CANNOLIS.  Again, another phone call to hear the, apparent, motto at this place, ""How would you like me to handle it?"" - I'm sorry, YOU are the business owner, I am the customer, why do I have to figure out to rectify YOUR mistake?  They ""would offer delivery, but we have a delivery charge"" (WHAT? For something YOU messed up on?), but, ""Oh we don't deliver to your area, anyway."" Great way to solve the problem.  
We will NEVER EVER come back to this location and discourage anyone to go to this location at all.  I really hope the other locations in town are not as horrible at serving the previously loyal customers they have.",_vrtIAWmoSHihifm-_vdeg,0,0,1,jo2qL7CtVyRV9Ajtor_-uQ

I arrived at 12:25 and seated myself. After about 3 minutes of waiting, I asked the waitress if I could have a menu. She seemed put out by this...brought me the menu but said ""Can I just take your drink order for now?"" It wasn't busy inside the restaurant, maybe 2 other parties. I can only guess that they were busy with deliveries or whatnot. I ordered a beverage. 

At 12:33, no one had brought my drink or returned to take my food order. 

At 12:36, I watched several people walk in from outside and put in take out orders. My food order still hadn't been taken. 

12:40. So, after 15 minutes of not having my drink brought or food order taken, I left. It really wasn't my intention to leave such a snotty review about the bad service here, I love their pizza, but come on.

We had a party of 13, designated one person to order for the table- well she couldn't handle that!   Actually yelled I can only take one order at a time!!   Kept trying to box up the  food as we were eating it.  

Attn Judd- either get a good staff or be closed within 6 months.  


Pizza is great, dining room servers need a bit of consistenty one day you can order an item a certain way, come back a week later & new server says kitchen says it can't be done.  Everything should be the same no mater who the server is.

UPDATE:  I don't know what's going on here. Last few times we've dined in & picked up the pizza ha been dried out, like it's been sitting for a while. 

The servers actually handed us a pizza box (flattened) for our leftover pizza when she seen us struggling assembling the box & said ""Yeah, I have trouble with those too"". DIDN'T offer to do it or help!  

When we asked for clean plates, after our salad, we were told ""Yeah, these are our last clean plates, we don't have a dishwasher"".  I sure hope nobody came in to eat after us!!  

Don't try to give cashier exact change with your bills, because she can't figure out how to give change.  For example our bill was $70.33, we gave her $100.33. She changed to $100 bill then had to get the calculator out!!  Then gave us an attitude!!",qfc45SoRX4d8cRQ-4kvXkA,0,0,2,UjtXRc_43LF45R6CG0sngw

Location: 5 stars

Ambiance: 4 stars. It's clean, but bland. They have (as of yesterday) a liquor license with a full bar inside. Plenty of seating. A few well-placed tvs to watch the game.

Pizza: 4 stars. I like the thin crust but do not like the ""double crust."" Note to Rosati's: if you want to make a crust that is breadier than thin, please give it some seasoning. It seems crazy, but pizza hut actually has really good seasoning crumbs on the outside of theirs.

Other food: 4 stars. I love the cheesy bread, like the frozen mushrooms (pretty sure they make them in-house). To me, the wings are meh, but my husband likes them. I haven't tried the sandwiches or pasta yet, but I appreciate the varied menu. Will be back soon to check the other offerings.

Price: 3 stars. The pizza is pretty high, considering they are mostly ""regular"" ingredients unlike the fancier cheese and pepperonis down the street at Grimaldi's.

Overall: I'll be back. They are hands down the best option in walking distance right now.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,2,0,4,0zjzpjQNPcOjEXr23Kl8NQ
4057907,2016-09-23,0,9wNrqTeoEepFSbFu4QLuUQ,I LOVE this place!  I have been going to Rosati's forever.  I am from Chicago so I was so excited to find one in Las Vegas!  The Italian Beef sandwiches are the best!  Now that I have moved to LA hoping they will open one up here!  It is a must whenever I visit Vegas or Chicago:),A97FQ8TQ28-EbJA15vRAew,0,0,5,mpp0YD2PoWWkkeQqhPejRw

Super friendly and courteous severs/bartender. Dallas really made our visit memorable and signed us up for the reward program. I had a salad with their house sweet Italian and it was great! Not too sweet and vinegary with a hint of tang. We started with the garlic cheese bread and we knew we had something special. Melty cheese did not overpower the garlic so it was the best of both worlds. The deep dish takes a while to bake but it is so worth it. Nice thick dough and medium soft crust with pepperoni and tomatoes, just as Deep dish should be! For our drinks we got the Al Capone (old fashioned) just enough bitters, not too much! They have free WiFi so that helped as we had not yet set up our internet. We will for sure be back- 5 star service, food, drinks, and a nice Chicago atmosphere with intimate Henderson feel",18kB52k4_nMRHhF5Oyyy9w,1,0,5,JPp91HBOt3HghY1zz8uKeA

I'm SO glad I asked because I would have been MAD if the food would have showed up with no fries.  I've ordered fingers from over 50 places the last 30 years and they've ALL come with fries.  To not include them with the food, especially when their picture shows them with fries, is a joke.

So, I got their Cheef sandwhich (that did come with fries).  Not bad.  Kinda skimpy on the fries.  Most places give twice as much.

Also got the turtle brownie.  Not horrible, not great.  Wouldn't spend 6 bucks on it again.",-INftgcdy5pCuFuKBBZOmg,0,0,2,vFYmwS47Oc-MCvKT9xWf-g

4655268,2017-02-20,6,9wNrqTeoEepFSbFu4QLuUQ,"What happens when you go to a restaurant where the food, service, and prices are nothing to write home about? In my case you write a review that is nothing to write home about. 

  If it weren't for somebody at work, I would never have caught Rosati's act. It is hidden in the 99 Cents shopping center at the southeast corner of Eastern Avenue at Warm Springs Road. However, the individual I talked to at work told me that I have to try Rosati's pizza. After dining in Rosati's I wonder if that person at work has tried Verazzano down the street, Grimaldi's, or Metro Pizza. 

  Yesterday driving back from Red Rock Canyon in the pouring rain, I figured that I would give Rosati's a try. When I walked in the older lady at the counter told me to sit anywhere. With both dining rooms being sparsely populated I chose a table nearer the counter. On this rainy Saturday afternoon they seemed to be doing a great deal more take out business. With that observation aside, she asked me what I wanted to drink while presenting me with a menu. 

  It took me a while deciding what to order. Not because everything seemed so good. Not at all. It took me so long to decide what to order because everything on it seemed higher price and menu offerings that I find at many pizzerias and Italian restaurants were missing here. This included individual slices of pizza, eggplant parmegaina, and my favorite the eggplant parmegaina sub. After the second time that the waitress checked in on me, I asked her if they serve individual slices of pizza. She responded to the inquiry by saying that they only serve slices during their weekday special. Now that I sipped some of the Coke and was too embarrassed to return to the rain soaked streets of Vegas, I decided on the six chicken wings. 

   The six chicken wings seemed to be close to the only entree on the menu under $10. Earlier I had myself a big breakfast in the Del Mar Deli and did not build enough of an appetite to spend around $20 for a dinner. The six chicken wings costed $6.95 and the bottomless Coke costed $2. Several minutes went by until the waitress presented the wings to my table. I ordered the spicy chicken wings with ranch sauce. They had a decent taste to them. But in similar style to chicken wings they were extremely sticky. I got good use of the napkins. That's for sure. 

   As far as service, just like the place it was nothing to write home about. The waitress was neither nasty nor friendly. It would have been appreciated  if she would of asked me if I could of used more Coke. After a few hours of hiking in Red Rock Canyon, I could of used a top off of Coke. Finally when I paid at the counter, I let her know that I left her tip on the table. She gave me the attitude of, ""whatever."" There was a warmth to Rosati's that was missing. 

   When there is nothing to write home about a restaurant there is an infinitesimal chance of it being my home away from home. I don't live in Siberia. The reality is that there is far better competition within a couple of miles of Rosati's that includes Verazzano Pizza, Mama Depalma's, Metro Pizza, and Grimaldi's.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,11,3,0Gg9cpFhCAnqJ0tbwZ0AxA

5005183,2015-12-15,0,9wNrqTeoEepFSbFu4QLuUQ,"We have been ordering pick up from Rosati's for years. When they moved to Warm Springs and Eastern and now converted to a sit down restaurant, we were thrilled.
We went there this evening to enjoy a good meal, unfortunately, that was not the case!
When we walked in, we were unsure whether we had to wait to be seated or could just seat ourselves and there was no sign posted on what we should do. We stood at the front counter for quite a while. We could see into the kitchen, where there were 3 guys standing and talking to each other, totally ignoring us! Finally, a girl came out from the back and asked if we had been helped. We told her we wanted to sit down and eat and she said to just go sit anywhere. We sat down and waited for 15 minutes for someone to come by, give us menus, silverware and ask us if we'd like a beverage. We decided to wait 5 more minutes before we'd get up and leave. 5 minutes passed, nobody ever approached our table, so we got up to leave. As we reached the front door, there were 2 girls behind the counter talking. As we were walking out, one girl said ""good night, thank you!"". I said ""thanks for what? We never ate!"". We continued out the door and as I turned to take one last look at the girl who spoke to us, she and the other girl were laughing!
Rosati's, you would be better off firing your current employees and going back to being a strictly take out and delivery restaurant!
Do not even think about eating in there!",hiYAibEH9q02UJ2waLOW5A,9,2,1,5GNSusqgSqs4x1NEQR-Ekg

The Chicago style pizza is good, and since Chicago style is hard to find, it's worth going for.  That said, can someone remind the guys cooking it that cheese is allowed on a Chicago-style pie?  The thin crust can easily be beaten for both flavor and price by Verranzano's or Grimaldi's.  
The service?  Well, they might be better off using an order at the counter and put a number on your table method.  Two servers were on duty the night we went and neither seemed like they gave a damn about doing their job.  Passed us by several times and over 10 minutes before being acknowledged.  Poor management likely here. No reason a sparsely populated dining area should receive this little attention and have this many tables not wiped down.  Also, observed other tables having to ask for their checks instead of having it brought to them with an offer of dessert.  However, this wasn't the case for us, our check was prompt after we asked for a box for the left overs. 
I'll give them another shot for take-out when I want Chicago style, but if they can't find the cheese, that'll end it.  I won't do dine in again, that was kind of sad.",wFdvn2LuVHmyJgBvssqssw,0,0,2,R_x8OIuqLA7KEYbCSbttKw

The first two times the food was decent and and the service was mediocre. We understood they had just opened and it appeared that they were trying to get settled so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. 
The third time on 4/1/2016 was an absolute nightmare. 
We walked in and saw that there were was plenty of open tables. So that was great, also they now had there liquor license, another bonus I thought. 
 A young lady asked us to seat ourselves and she let us know that a server would be with us shortly. 
I looked around and I was surprised that for a Friday night there were only 2 other party's seated. A very large group that appeared to be wrapping up and one other couple in the new bar area. 
I will cut to the chase!
We ordered drinks and our food. The table next to us had a pile of dishes and the previous guest check. We sat there for 45 minutes with the waiter returning every 15 minutes apologizing for the delay. After 50 minutes and no food or the appetizer that we ordered. I asked for the check!
They said no charge for drinks. I left money anyways... 

We live 5 minutes away and we're happy to have a new pizza place close to home. We were very disappointed with the level of over all service and they were not busy at all. The pile of plates and dishes on the table next to us remained there the entire  50 minutes we were waiting. What the heck is going on???

I kept being told it would be 5 more minutes...the worst part is that no one apologized, no one offered a beverage while I waited. I just sat there. No one seemed to care.
