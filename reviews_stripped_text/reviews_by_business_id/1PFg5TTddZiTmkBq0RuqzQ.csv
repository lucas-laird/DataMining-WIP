1628502,2014-04-30,0,1PFg5TTddZiTmkBq0RuqzQ,This reminds me of a noodle shop/caf√©. It's new and clean but a bit pricey for the kind of food and the amount you get. I ordered the beef stew noodle soup and only got 4 piece of meat...extremely disappointed as most the dish was noodles and broth. Its a start up business and I hope they do well by improving.,ehAvwDt4Fpsz9KPordu5lA,1,0,2,YrMgQUAKXTIrhGdV-k3vQw
1810330,2014-02-23,1,1PFg5TTddZiTmkBq0RuqzQ,"Great find!  It's a new hole-in-the-wall mom & pop noodle shop where the owner, Vid (very friendly guy and great cook), says it's mostly Hong Kong style soup/noodles, but there were other things on the menu.  Very clean with modern decor...both table and counter seating.  5-stars for great food each visit, and very reasonably priced.  One of my new favorite places!",_TUuQXjxeMR61Z1HRWLWww,2,2,5,-ktF53ukhewVxSRvM99zrw
2079974,2014-03-16,0,1PFg5TTddZiTmkBq0RuqzQ,My new favorite spot for the days I am to busy to cook. I just pick up and go. The short ribs are outstanding. The service is great too.,ru2MiluYr_tYWxh2nAhUlQ,1,0,5,1J_BART3D6Vur7C6sHrPNQ
2724990,2013-12-28,0,1PFg5TTddZiTmkBq0RuqzQ,"I guess this place just opened up really recently and the only person there (who I presume is the owner of the place)  took our order and cooked our food.   He was friendly.

The menu tries to simplify it for the average customer.  No words like ""shoyu"" are even thrown in the menu, just ""pork ramen soup"",  ""beef brisket with clear broth"" etc.

I ordered the ""pork ramen"" and it came in a decent sized bowl with a few slices of pork, an egg (no extra charge) and typical 'veggies' .  It was not bad but not anywhere as close to the flavor of the soups you'd get at Monta Ramen.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,0,0,2,3gpTsRBVi9LsScqm-Hi74w
3931094,2014-03-03,0,1PFg5TTddZiTmkBq0RuqzQ,"Simple menu and good noodles. The pot stickers are fresh grilled on one side. For the price especially  the food is very good.

The restaurant is hard to find right now: the temp sign is small. It is behind the chase manhattan and KFC.",TouQ6rIlA5ivXwdKqOtZoA,1,0,5,a831KXuqgyZ69w3_y0DgoQ
