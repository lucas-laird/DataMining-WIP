We were crammed in by the door but it was a Friday night so didn't really care since it was pretty busy which I thought was a good sign. Like most mention it is a hole in the wall so wasn't surprised by the interior. The menus & the soy bottles were filthy, the staff was ok but the sushi and food period was pretty bad. The rolls were falling apart since the chef didn't take time to tightly roll them & the fish was mushy. We got chicken lo mien for the kids which was disgusting. Wasted $100 on this garbage & will never step foot in here again.",7ttlhpWLnU0sqIGD9nTqBA,0,0,1,uMYJK41bLO5SGKfk094d4w
131914,2013-07-24,0,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"horrible owner and i will not go back!!! they don't want to honor their frequent card saying it expired. i was there today 7/24/13, the first time i went there was august of 2012.  my card had a stamp on the name side as 8/15/2012, that was the  first time i got the card in 2012.  how can it expired when it hasn't even been a year since i stepped into that place??

they were slow, i sat at the table by the door.  then the waitress asked me to move closer because she was the only one working that shift, ok i moved.  then i wanted ayce she said, oh then you should sit at the bar...ok...i sat at the bar.  then the bill came gave her my cc & frequent card and she didn't want to stamp it saying it expired, and she was new and i never saw her before.  where was my nice little Japanese server. 

too many ayce around here in this city.  they lost a good paying customer that's for sure!!! and they fight with the customer and saying the customer is wrong...

i never had this ever happened to me before!!!! i never ever have refused to pay for my meals at any restaurant.  I had many coupons and frequent cards expired and I can clearly understand how it works!! i even paid for this one with the horrible experience...i just can't believe it!!!!!  the sad part was I wasn't even trying to redeem it yet!!! i just wanted my freakin STAMP!!!

I'm totally upset if my writing is not you can understand...lol!!

BTW, I forgot to mention the food...
So it was a new sushi chef or old, I just never saw him before. he must have a lot on his mind...no smile, no talky no nothing.  I order Hokki sushi (surf clam) he took the surf clam and cut it in half made two itty bitty ones...OMG! why was he soooo cheap.  I usually get 2 clams per order.  The rest was ok...
The reason I come here is because of Japanese own and I want to eat what is essence of Japanese food.  They dab a bit of wasabi in every nigiri, the traditional way.  Oh well, I guess I'll go to other sushi place and request that method.  Soooooooooooooooooo...disappointed!!!",cODORiLFa8kdeAh9zTBdPQ,4,2,1,cLKzl8QfEVxPS5eP72nR0w

Coming from Chicago at a time where AYCE places were non-existent and knowing full well that I am capable of dropping several hundred dollars on this beloved cuisine, I stopped at Sushi on Rainbow to check it out.  I met Yoshi, who was entertaining and did magic tricks and for the next few months, this was my one and only sushi place.  

Two weeks ago I happened to be in the area and was craving sushi.  I know that Sushi on Rainbow doesn't have Screaming O's and Johnny Rolls, but I remembered they do have free Saki and bud light on Mondays, so I decided to stop in.  I have to say the sushi was better than I ever remember it being.  They also do half rolls, which is perfect if you're flying solo and want a variety.  Hiro made some rolls that weren't on the menu this week when I went back, and they were exceptional.

I've eaten at top-notch sushi bars in Japan where the fish is so fresh they pour sake in its mouth and its mouth and tail move. My family is Japanese. All their Korean and Japanese friends come to Sushi on Rainbow. I am always served by the same chef and the food has always been consistant. You get huge slices of sashimi. 

I noticed a few reviewers post bad reviews but look at where they're from.  Anyone that thinks people in Las Vegas aren't sophisticated enough to know good sushi doesn't know much about Las Vegas and the transient nature of its populace. Most of us are from somewhere else. And BTW I have friends from both Seattle AND San Francisco who think Sushi on Rainbow is superb.

Here's a tip: ask the chef what fish is best today. 

If you're lucky he'll say super white albacore (nigiri). It's so buttery and just melts in your mouth! My favorite.",42E9Rer6xUuXVisjm6GmaQ,1,0,5,HlqhQFl5lAYXLPxV19n1XQ

A little joint in a strip mall. I was afraid to go in but we were with friends who rave about it. There was only one other table when we arrived but many more when we left. We all did AYCE. Delivery was fairly quick. Cajun is amazing. We loved the super crunch roll although we ordered a second after devouring the first and it was not the exact same roll. Ordered snow crab twice and never got it.  They cut off our ordering on two different occasions.

721308,2008-01-24,0,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"Recycled sushi?  That's simply nonsense.  That would be a direct health code violation and they'd be closed-down in no time flat if that were true.  I'm sure this ''Lisa"" just had a bad experience with the waitresses scolding them about having to actually finish their all-you-can-eat sushi on their plate (common sense), and twisted her story a little.  

Just as a matter of perspective, I'm Japanese, and I've spent many years in Japan eating all sorts of authentic sushi including ones near Tsukiji market.  I've also never been a big fan of the fancy Americanized ""rolls"" so prevalent in this side of the world.  I like sushi, fish on rice, what sushi is meant to be.  With that said, for an all-you-can-eat sushi place Sushi on Rainbow is definitely way above average.  I'm a Las Vegas local, and all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants are popping up all over town like check-cashing joints, most of which are run by Chinese or Korean owners (some even Mexican).  No offense to my Chinese/Korean friends, but for the most part, they are clueless as to what fresh sushi is all about.  One place in particular had the nerve to serve me tilapia straight from the gutter and claimed it was halibut.  The guys behind the counter at Sushi on Rainbow on the other hand are actually Japanese and take pride in what they serve, specifically a guy named Yoshi, who not only serves sushi right but is a hoot to talk to.  Be sure to sit in front of Yoshi and you will not go wrong.  

By far a locals' favorite, a very casual atmosphere (pretty much a hole in the wall) where running into local strip performers/ UFC fighters is certainly not uncommon.  They serve aji (spanish mackerel) and sometimes fatty tuna, which is a rare find at an all-you-can-eat place.   Pretty good quality, again, for an all-you-can-eat place.  Amaebi also served included in the lunch menu unlike the ""dinner-only"" soup nazis found elsewhere.  If you're a lover of rolls you're probably better off going to the plethora of sushi joints in town that serve you sushi with sprinkled coconut or chocolate syrup and find nothing morally wrong with it.  If you want above-average quality sushi, real sushi, the way they should be served, at a bargain price of $25, Sushi on Rainbow is highly recommended.",YkWlehjcpSyo2ceTVBtr-g,3,3,5,QNOcQcjgwK1OAmqmaCKezQ

The sushi has awesome flavors, especially the peppered tuna, Cajun albacore, Garlic Salmon/tuna, etc. The rolls (maki) are very good as well. The location is okay, nothing fancy. The parking is not good during lunch, but I usually don't have problem finding parking at night. SO WHY A 3 STAR? The service can either be great or TERRIBLE, depend on who you have as a server or Chef. STAY AWAY from the small OLD JAPANESE LADY! She is slow, rude, will delay your orders on all- you-can-eat, and then time you to make sure you eat less. I watched a customer order iced tea once, and she brought the lady hot tea. It was a simple drink order, so she should have just swapped it for her. She argued with the lady and made such a big deal saying that she was right, that I wonder how she manages to keep her job- she's been there for several years, by the way. When taking my to-go order this same old waitress gave me a hard time when I asked for two additional packs of soy sauce, believe it or not. She is the reason I am not a regular anymore! Therefore, to avoid the possibility of aggravation, do yourself a favor and ask for the younger servers, they are nice! The Chef who works on the left side of the bar, the small and serious Asian man, is not talkative or welcoming. He may come across as rude. The sushi he makes is okay, but it can be sloppy. The owner, on the other hand, it's more pleasant and works on the right side of the bar. He's not too talkative either, but definitely not as quiet as the other man, and he smiles often. I have eaten there several times, and I go back because it's close to my home, and the food has a lot of flavor. HOWEVER, here's something that may scary some picky eaters: I have found hairs in my sushi... a couple times, and that pretty much kept me from going back there for several months. I did notify one of the young waitresses about the hair incident, and I heard the owner was irate; but they never offered me anything for my ""hairy food,"" not a free soup, not a discount, nothing! They don't know how to treat a customer. Am I going back? Probably! I like the food.

1020944,2010-07-11,0,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"Pricey for a very limited menu which gives a lot of rice for sushi and rolls.

Went here for AYCE.  The service was pretty good, it was fast.  The server automatically split the bill for my group, so that earned them an extra star.  The sushi was nice and big, but so was the amount of rice underneath it.  
  
The AYCE menu is very limited for $22.95 for lunch.  There was no sea urchin/uni they said it was only available for dinner, but it wasn't even on the menu.  Mochi ice cream for desert was not included either.  Desert was plum ice cream, mochi ice cream, red bean ice cream, and orange slices.  I mean, really?  Not even a 1 piece limit on mochi ice cream?

The rolls that were ordered had a lot of rice.  not too much filling.  at least the fried oysters and shrimp tempura was pretty good.  The ahipoke was more like cucumber and seaweed salad with a couple pieces of ahipoke.  That dish definitely did not capture the essence of what ahipoke is.

Actually the entire prep area looked like it needed a good cleaning. For AYCE at $26.95, I expected  more choices of appetizers and sides.

Another place I look forward to when in Vegas.  We usually eat here sundays or mondays because its all you can eat sushi & all you can drink sake and beer!  This place is like heaven for me, I'm a skinny guy but can eat and drink more than plenty for my size.  

The waitress takes your order and we usually order everything at once, sushi galore here we come!  I personally love their mahi mahi express and volcano # 2 rolls, deep fried scallops/salmon/cream cheese smothered in yum yum sauce = *drool! Everything here is so fresh for a all you can eat joint.  

Like starving unruly beasts who just broke out of their cages, we devoured everything in sight.  Like champions there was nothing we could not eat or was in our way.  Except the monster roll, omfg! the monster roll is this truly horrible roll that will intimidate any eater.  A 5 piece roll that is so mammoth in size, it alone can do you in easily to food coma paradise.  

I have no idea why my friend thought it was a good idea to get the monster roll towards the end of our stay here.  We were getting near full at this point.  Maybe he wanted to pique his curiosity, maybe he thought was funny to make us suffer with more food, who knows.  But the plan backfired as you will be charged for uneaten food and since he ordered it, he had to finish it.  He was literally in pain just looking at this beastly roll.  It was like a episode of Man Vs. Food, fail edition as he could only finish 1 piece of this monstrosity.  

Overall this is a great place, a diamond in the rough.  Not many places that provide all you can eat and drink at a great price with great quality.  I had so much food I ate myself sober from all that sake, it was that great!  It's too bad our personal chef Yoshi wasn't there, he's really great and entertaining with his magic tricks.

There was one weird incident that happened after the end of the night.  I had constant back to back nightmares that resulted in me waking up sweating balls every hour.

1406920,2013-03-15,0,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"I'm slowly going to start taking chances and try other sushi places here in Vegas. Naka Sushi is my #1 spot and it's hard to break away when it's always a perfect experience.

I read a handful of reviews and decided this one will be the one to try 1st.

In a general statement... Sushi on Rainbow gets a 4 and not a 5 due to the overall ambiance and welcome-ness to the joint. It's more ""traditional"" I guess you could say, which is fine. But I'm used to an upbeat atmosphere in my sushi places and a huge HELLO!!!!!!!!!!! whereas in this place, it was very calm, mild, quiet, and not a very ""welcome"" place. The decor and parking lot and location and all of that... doesn't bother me at all. That's all fine. I judge on the experience of the restaurant.

So now, down to the food. All you can eat. If you're eating lunch: 45 minutes. Dinner: 60 minutes. That's unusual to me to have a time limit to eat. I mean generally you'll be done eating by that point, yeah. But people typically like to go into a sushi bar and hang out while enjoying the deliciousness and talking about it and whatnot. So that was weird to me...

I ordered the Mango Roll twice, Moon River Roll, Teriyaki Chicken Roll, Sunrise Roll, Paradise Roll, Octopus Nigiri, Surf Clam Nigiri, and the ""Baked Scallop Shell"" from the appetizers.

Essentially, I ordered everything that looked the absolute best to my tastes and literally ordered to my absolute fullness and even slightly over my satisfaction level haha... oops!

Everything I had was fresh, very tasty, flavorful (and to some degrees subtle, which always worked well), just the right amount, and satisfying. Not the BEST I've ever had. And certainly not the worst. But definitely very good.

I'm not sure if I'd come in again for a full AYCE setting. But I would stop in for some to go orders.... especially that Mango Roll. The Sunrise Roll was probably my 2nd favorite. And I'd recommend the Baked Scallop Shell for sure.

If you want solid sushi and an almost overly laid back atmosphere that's somewhat uninviting.... try it. If you like a laid back but fun atmosphere where you can really get to know the chef and feel welcome and everything is always excellent..... try Naka ;)",90ZI2l_9kvK3_snex6E5rw,4,2,4,hQXaEkt36U_lv-0DGmbgUQ

1455860,2014-02-27,0,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"My wife and I have been here several times before, last time being about 6-months ago.  Today we came for lunch just after they opened about 11:45am and there was only one table occupied.  We opted for the AYCE special.  A much older Japanese woman, whom we have never seen before, served us.  

Now when I go to other AYCE sushi places, they take my full order no problem.  Upon telling this woman that I wanted to order 8-salmon nigiri, she acted very surprised and questioned if that was the correct quantity.  I told her it was and then she says that a lot of people doesn't know that it comes in pairs and that I will get charged for uneaten food.  Did she think this was my first time at an AYCE sushi place?  I could only order like 4-items and some appetizers before she said that was all I could order the first round because of only 1-sushi maker working.  Each time after that, I could only order like 3-items at a time before the old lady just walked off before I could finish telling her what we wanted.

So by this time several other tables fill in for lunch and we watched as the other tables were served miso soup and sushi first when they obviously arrived and ordered much later than we did.

Since they have signs posting a 45-minute time limit for the AYCE lunch, I wanted to place a last order.  A younger Japanese woman took our order and when she was writing the order down, the old lady came to her and showed her some kind of paper, obviously she was probably showing her the time that we arrived and told her not to take any more orders from us.  When our last order was ready, the old lady brought it to our table and told us ""last order, OK? That's it!""

Food was good, but the old lady kept looking at us like she didn't want us there after the 45-minute mark.  Very unwelcoming feeling and very cold.  Never have I experienced service like that anywhere.  I will never be back, that's for sure!!!",ZvNDnyc0uTSeelyWXSN-OA,1,0,1,1eFIgBitPlvVmZ_SumDYWQ

1531180,2014-05-14,1,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"Decent option for takeout sushi- a kind yelper uploaded the yellow menu in pics, allowing me to make my selections: the NY girl in Vegas and the American Dream rolls. Called in order, quick and painless. Order was ready when I went in about 15 minutes later.

Initially felt that the rolls looked to be on the small side, but the takeout box is deep and each piece is pretty dense, box itself was heavy. Two rolls was a good portion for one, and price was just over $20. Also had a humongous portion of wasabi and ginger, and ample packets of soy sauce, though I don't use any of that. What I did use was the tiny portion cups of eel sauce and spicy mayo- liked how that was packed separately so I could apply it myself, as many places tend to drown their rolls in far too much sauce.

American Dream roll was fresh with thick slices of salmon on top and lemon, and its a combination I love. Fish was fresh, rolls were tight, portion was large. NY Girl in Vegas roll was also good, topped with noticeably smaller pieces of eel compared to the other roll. Flavor was still good and fish was of good quality. The two rolls together complemented one another- fresh and light for the first, more earthy for the second.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,3,3,0jAzEISHe5AiLQe5jv3mdQ

I have always wanted to give this place a try because I frequent Greenland market a lot. I was happy I did! It was slow and we were seated promptly. We got waters with lemon, which was great, weird but some water can taste funny and this was awesome. We started with Tamago and Maguro. I'll admit that I've had better Tamago, seems as though the Tamago isn't whisked wnough. Still it was tastey, slight sweetness and great egg flavor with a nice savory sushi rice that was cooked perfectly. The Maguro was fresh, tasted clean and with the added wasabi was a delight to eat! We then had the fried calamari, this must be the best calamari I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection. Tender, juicy, and with the added sauce was just perfect. We then ordered some rolls. The lasagna, tiger, spider, and spicy tuna. The lasagna was the best lasagna I've had and I've had it in a few spots so far and I like this one the best. Not so much cream cheese and had a lot of scallops. The tiger roll tasted great and with the avocado was creamy and delicious! The spicy tuna was just awesome. Fresh, spicy, and was hard not to order another one! The spider roll was my favorite. Just like the lasagna I've had spider rolls a lot as it is one of go to rolls. The one here is just badass! Crab was fried to perfection and with The combo of rice and eel sauce went together like rice and shoyu, perfectly! Then we got a cali hand roll. It was actually a lot bigger than most places and the quality here is great. So we then got some snow crab meat nigiri, what a surprise! Took a bite and boom!! An explosion of juices, crab, ginger, wasabi, what an awesome bite. Never had it before and now it won't be the last. We finished off with a sake shooter. My fiance was very resistant but after convincing her we went for it and it was awesome! The warmed sake with the quail egg, sriracha, shout, green onions, was so smooth and creamy with the egg. Who would have thought right??? I say the sake shooter, fried calamari, spicy tuna, spider roll, lasagna, well pretty much all is a must try. If you are looking for a sushi spot give sushi on rainbow a try. Don't let the ratings steer you away, it's awesome! A little hole in the wall that was a great find!

1763499,2012-06-22,17,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"Being half Japanese & growing up in Japan I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi or any Japanese restaurant. Sushi on Rainbow did not disappoint. My friends indulged in my cravings and agreed to eat sushi. Not familiar with any sushi places in Vegas and one of the rare moments my friends have EVER asked me to jump on Yelp & find a place, I was stoked! Usually when I whip out my phone and start yelping it's amongst groans and moans from them. ""Emy put the phone down!"" ""Seriously dude, do you have to yelp everything???"" Sometimes I would Yelp while walking and a few times almost face planted into something. Though my friends were annoyed with my constant Yelping, they were nice enough to guide me while I was walking and typing. So yea, I was pretty happy they were turning to YELP for suggestions. 

This was my moment to either shine or worse - tank. Sushi on Rainbow was close to where we were at and the Yelp reviews were pretty good so I threw caution to the wind and announced, ""I found the perfect place!"". Fingers crossed and a silent prayer to the Yelp gods, we walk into SOR and was immediately greeted with ""irrashaimase"" in the right pronunciation...yeeesss, there is a Yelp god! 

It was AYCE sushi and other Japanese dishes such as tempura, fried oysters, curry rice, katsu etc. As some Yelpers have pointed out there is an hour time limit but this is common in Japan of any AYCE restaurant so this was not a big deal to me. I forgot how much it was per person but I did upload a couple of pics here that have the pricing on it. We all def ate and drank more than our money's worth in the allotted time.

The sushi we ordered came out relatively quickly and so did the non-sushi items. I was amazed at all the things they offer for AYCE! It was delish! The night we were there, beer, sake and soft drinks were also included in the AYCE eat. After establishing who the DD was (gotta be responsible ppl) we all ordered sake.  

The sushi chef's were very friendly and personable so were the waitresses. The sushi chefs would call out from time to time to ask us how we were doing. Like I said, very friendly. One of the waitresses was from my hometown in Japan and lived about 10 mins from me. It was fun talking to her in Japanese especially since my friends hardly ever hear me speak it. So yea, I got to bust out my Japanese...lol. 

Ok getting side tracked. I can't remember everything we ordered but the sushi was very fresh. I always start with hamachi (don't know what it's called in English) and it was very good. Salmon and maguro followed. Plus spicy tuna and a few speciality rolls. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, fried oysters and tonkatsu (pork cutlet). Yes, I'm a little oinker! 

One hour was plenty of time for us to fill our bellies on endless sushi and sake. Like I mentioned we hardly had to wait and the restaurant was a bit busy. The sushi counter was full when we got there and there were 3 tables that were occupied. The 2 sushi chefs both from Japan, were making the sushi and the cooks in the back were making the other dishes, 

This will be MUST GO TO restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Oh and btw, one of the sushi chefs was wearing a UH cap and told me they get lots of customers from Hawaii. 

As for converting my friends to Yelp that's another issue lol. I did score some big points on this once. (Fist pump!) Oh wait, I did convert one person, who just set up an account!

If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi & food this place is the place to go. I've been to other Japanese restaurants in Vegas that were highly recommended by locals only to be disappointed that it wasn't authentic. I mean come on, shrimp tempura is not panko crusted shrimp...that's called shrimp fry. 

So glad I found this place thanks to Yelp. 1 point Emy / 0 points friends who I will eventually convert to becoming Yelpers. Bwuahahaha",FVfGXRIQ6Trnx5cKayU-Cg,23,16,5,P_40kT1-2hC4_ilPZsAvUw

Here's what it boils down to. 

The service is fantastic, and attentive in all the right ways. Very kind, very welcoming staff - you always are greeted warmly. 

The atmosphere - low key, friendly, simple decor (nothing crazy). The vibe seems to be very ""neighborly"", as there are plenty of regulars that come here. 

The specials are fantastic. I mostly crave the basic lunch special (bento with teriyaki beef, california roll, salad, edamame, etc). that is less than $6 total. My mother likes the saba special or ordering two special rolls (both around $8). We typically order a side of whatever nigiri/rolls we're craving in addition to the specials. The nigiri sushi here is like it should be - little rice, and a fresh generous slice of fish on top. 

The All You Can Eat is also great, although I rarely order it since the lunch special is so cheap and delicious. My mother enjoys it from time to time though, and the quality of the sushi is well worth it.

All you can eat sushi - including specialty rolls and nigiri - AND all you can drink house hot saki? Are you kidding? I am SO THERE! 

Of course, if you want to get the royal treatment at a sushi restaurant, you must sit at the bar, in front of the sushi chefs. Ah, he made our night! Was making up new rolls and sushi for us based on what we had liked and ordered, saki shots for all (warning for the squeamish: these are shots of saki, soy sauce, raw quail egg, topped with green onions), and a great time. 

And you must go in understanding that you are in the middle of a desert. So, ""fresh sushi"" has a different meaning that my land of San Diego. Even knowing this, though, I have to admit that I was impressed with the quality and selection of the sushi there. 

Awesome rolls! I'm not usually a roll kinda girl (stick with the basic, wonderful fresh fish), but these were innovative and flavourful - mmmmmm...... 

Good service, and yummy food. A bit lacking in the decor and atmosphere of the place, but seriously, you give me plum wine ice cream at the end of the meal, and all that is forgotten :-)

They are understaffed, sometimes you have to remind what you want a couple of times. But this is classic AYCE. They were part of the 4 store group that brought AYCE sushi to Vegas.

There was only one chef when we visited, so order turn over was slower than normal and some of the things we ordered when we first arrived never made it out (octopus nigiri, I believe)... but the chef was pleasant, the food that did come out was rather tasty, and while uni and amaebi were not listed on the menu they were available and excellent quality.

We came on a Sunday night so they had all you can eat sushi with endless beer/sake (limited choices on the liquor but if it's endless, can you really complain?)  

This was great as it was made-upon-ordering type buffet so you didn't need to worry about food sitting out for who-knows-when.  You look through an extensive menu, pick out nigri or rolls or side items (like soup, seaweed salad, etc), and give your order to a waitress.

What put the ""cherry on top"" on the experience was they had uni and sweet shrimp that was fresh (note: these were NOT on the menu - my wife had to ask if they were available and they said yes!  You are limited to get only one order of two pieces per person on these, but there's no extra charge to the buffet price)

It is a bit of a drive from the Strip.  After going a few miles, I thought I had wrong directions but simply trust your GPS and keep on driving Westward and it'll be on your right in a small strip mall set back from the road.  Keep your eyes peeled but you won't be disappointed if you're there for the buffet.  Yum!

Normally, I would rate this at 4 stars (while fresh, still can't beat Japan), but going to put it at 5 stars to counter some unfair ratings.  I believe 4 stars is a fair rating for this place - little ambiance but very good for the price.",beZNLqyLxcrUzDMaziDixA,2,1,5,dqSBd0Z9AsKkE8apTCnhmg

Paradise Roll
Dragon Roll
Monster and CHUBBY roll...

Did I mention me and my husband eat like 12 rolls? HAHA!

Yoshi is our favorite...my husband likes to stand at the bar while he eats because he thinks he can eat more sushi that way LOL, yoshi always thinks that is funny, and not to mention he has magic fingers!!!!!! he can make like 4 rolls in 1 minute!

Can't a girl get her sushi during the day!?!) So with that said, being that Sushi On Rainbow was open for lunch automatically gave this place a 3 star. This may look like a ""hole in the wall"" but it satisfied my sushi fix.

No trills, no frills....just come in and get your Japanese food/sushi on. The regular rolls on the menu ranges from $5-6 and each order comes with 8 rolls. The special rolls comes with two and it ranges from $8-12. 

Not sure if other places around the area have lunch specials on the weekend (we came on a Sunday) but this place does. My boyfriend got a beef lunch special box that comes with miso soup, salad, beef (duh), a generous portion of rice, and half an orange for your daily serving of fruit. This was $8.95 I think. And he got full off of this....so good adult sized meal. 

Service was great to us. Our nice little Japanese grandma took our order. I didn't know there was a lunch special for the Cali rolls and Spicy Tuna rolls that I ordered. Instead of keeping her mouth shut and just placing my order in, she told me it would be cheaper if i just got the lunch special price and it comes with my choice of soup or salad. How nice of her to tell me =) Throughout our lunch, the waitresses kept coming by to refill our drinks as well as asking how everything was.

All Japanese ran and none of the BS. salad rolls that disguise the old cheap fish flavor. Most sushi restaurants are over rated with average fish quality. In fact you can't find good Hamachi and Maguro anymore since those fish are pretty much fished out and gone.

It pains me to write this review, my heart actually aches.  I wanted to love this place in fact we went back 3 times to give it a shot, I don't normally do that. Sadly we left in heartbreak and will never go back.

We have been to Japan, Sushi capital of the world.  We are not professionals but have traveled the world.  I have respect for those who carry that tradition over to our side of the pond.  The owner is amazing his cuts are exactly where they should be  the fish are precisely cut the rice is also perfect, he is amazing.

So all that going.  Great!  well not so much.  We were treated horribly after our first trip. When we sat at the bar the owner served us the sushi was great.   The next 2 times not so much we were pushed off to the sideline. This time was busier we sat at his bar his sidekick took care of us.  Sushi is not all about the fish is is about the service, presentation and cut.  This individual had none.  No service. No presentation. and the cuts were horrible.  Fish was slopped all over the place no design or pride it looked like a serial killer left a crime scene.

We wanted the owner to wait on us but it seemed he was always busy with his vips.  We Will NEVER be back.

For some reason, I can't seem to find good sushi joints around Chinatown or Spring Mountain, but Sushi on Rainbow is an exception.  They are not lip-smacking irresistibly good, but they aren't too shabby either.

The interior is decent, but a little old. The sushi chefs are Japanese and they do a pretty good job with the sushi.  There isn't too much rice with the sushi, and the fish is relatively always fresh.  I always do the specials such as the bento boxes that come with sashimi along with a side of miso soup.  I don't do AYCE very often nowadays, and I never tried it here so I can't comment on that.

I don't know what it is about this place but I like it.  It's a safe destination, you don't need to worry about eating bad fish or waiting forever because the place is packed.  Sushi on Rainbow is very functional in what they do, but they do it good enough that it's easy for me to make the recommendations to someone else.

Serious nagiri chow-down, with each piece acting almost as a stand alone dish because of flavor. A previous review commented on the 'warm' fish, but I disagree, it was finally the right temperature to me. You could actually TASTE the FISH instead of a cold lump of American food oversight. In-depth creations, with fried, baked, and super-spicy rolls. Even side dishes, dessert, and drinks (sapporo!) is included on AYCE. 

TRY the Peppered Salmon from the Nagiri. Slightly seared peppered salmon, with a sauce that I've never tasted before, but would drink from a glass if given a chance.

Like most other places AYCE is accompanied by rules, 45 Min for Lunch and 1 hour for Dinner. As my dad was champion of sitting it out in sushi joints for his ""All You Can Stand"" with the newspaper (or three) I get this. I honestly appreciate this rule. I've seen the behavior that leads to this rule. You also have to pay for what you don't eat, aka, you can't over order and take it with you on the house.

The place was easy to find via car and not terribly busy. Two things set this all you can eat sushi place from places like Todai. One, they roll the sushi when you place the order (which makes them fresher). Two, they include their specialty rolls in their all-you-can-eat special. I don't know of any place that would include Caterpillar Rolls, Dragon Rolls, etc in their buffet. Essentially, 3 specialty rolls will get you your money's worth at this place. My date and I have been to quite a few sushi places and when we go all out, our bill typically ends up north of the $120 mark. A $50 bill for the two of us was quite the bargain, especially since the quality was comparable to places like Sushi Roku and Kaizen. The staff is friendly and efficient. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. Skip the more expensive places on the Strip and get your fill at Sushi on Rainbow.

They have a sign that boldly states ""Since we adhere to strict Japanese standards, our food costs are higher than other establishments which follow lesser standards"" which sounds promising. Unfortunately, this place is underwhelming in many aspects.

How to get any service at Sushi on Rainbow:
1. Walk in and find your own seat
2. If lucky enough they will swing by to ask for a drink. Tell them your drink order immediately as they rudely slap their menu on the table
3. Order won't be taken unless you wave your hands.  Hands in the air, reach for the stars or imagine yourself being a butterfly trying to reach the heaven. You will get their attention eventually.

FOOD
As I said earlier, their sign posted all over the establishment is very deceiving. I have ordered Sushi 4 You and Sushi Combo for 2. Fish never taste fresh and this is a fact based on +20 visits. AYCE is $22.95 for lunch (with 45min limit) and $26.95 for dinner (with 60min limit). Way overpriced for their low quality items. 

On one of the visit, I decided to order Katsudon which turned out to be a total fail. First, it took over 30mins to get to the table. Perfect! Everyone in my group is done with their food while me and my starving stomach are waiting for the food ever since the dinosaurs existed. 

Finally my katsudon comes to the table and all I see is some crusty rice with katsu (breading falling apart) and egg...overall presented like a vomit. Not appetizing at all. Too much dashi or sauce used for this. Never again.

Despite the other reviews, I thought the sushi was pretty fresh.  Remember, you get what you pay for, and for $25, it was $25 fresh!  It was pretty good (not excellent though).  They have a wide variety of rolls and I didn't get sick.  In fact, we had a group of 8 and everyone liked it and no one got sick.  Don't get me wrong, I have had high quality and poor quality sushi and this was above average.

Included in the $25 is all you can eat dessert as well which included 3 choices of dessert: green tea ice cream, strawberry mochi ice cream and one other red bean dessert.  We ordered only a few desserts as everyone was full, but found ourselves ordering more and more dessert since it was so good (and fresh)!

I only gave this place 4 stars because of the beer and sake.  Honestly the sake tasted like isopropyl alcohol (although I am not a sake connoisseur) and they only had 2 beer choices (and they were domestic beer!).  But seriously for $25, what more can you ask for?

First, let me get this right off the bat, the place serves good quality sushi (there's even signage expressing that the restaurant ""adheres to strict Japanese standards"" offering only quality ingredients), but that's where my enthusiasm ends. The sushi nigiri is excellent, especially the uni, but the scallop dynamite was a big let down (too much onion chunks). Speaking of enthusiasm, it was seriously lacking with the elderly Japanese lady serving the place (perhaps she was tired, perhaps she's just like that, I don't know). We felt rushed (and there is a 1-hour time limit to your AYCE dinner stay BTW), and she sounds indignant every single time we had to ""bother"" her for an order (yes ma'am I know I already ordered hamachi, and yes I am ordering another, please and thank you).

1 hour time limit - I can see why this rule had to be put in place,  you don't want the party of 5 competitive eaters to stay for 6 hours. You need the space for the family of 5 who pay the insane price for their kids to eat 2 rolls.  If you don't have any distractions or you don't want to spend a lot of time visiting with your company, then you won't have any problems with this limit. 

Sushi - The quality of the Sushi is pretty good.  They have a wide variety of choices.  This is what makes it worth it. A key tip is to get a half order of some of the rolls, so you can try them all. 

Service - They don't want you hanging out. If you have noisy kids then everyone looks at you like you are ruining their meal, unfortunately they aren't concerned about the loud sushi bar or TV noises.

There is no limit for their ice cream, so you can try different flavors

They pay attention to details, even the oranges are impeccably cut and peeled for you.

The prices for individual rolls are cheaper than other places as well if you're not an AYCE fan.

This place is pretty much exactly what I expected: okay sushi at a great price.  
All you can eat lunch costs $23, and you get 45 minutes to finish.  Dinner is $27 for one hour.  On Sundays, and Mondays all-you-can-drink saki, bud light, and soft drinks are included in those prices.
They also have a stamp card, where if you do 10 AYCE, your 11th one is free.

The sushi itself is fine, but they do use quite a bit of rice.  Some of the fish is great, some of the fish is ""acceptable"", nothing was really bad (except for the ""Fried Jason""  it's a roll topped with waaay too much melted god-knows-what.  Some people might like that though). 

I was worried about the servers hassling us about the time limit, taking too long with orders, or adding extra charges to our bill, but pleasantly enough none of that happened.  The rolls kept coming, and the server was happy to bring us as many ""buduh-rite"" as we wanted.

Overall, it's a great value, and I'm sure we'll be back.  We will definitely order more nigiri next time (to reduce rice consumption), now that we know it's included.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,5,2,3,A-sCZKr4nNZDkGD1oW3GPg

If the food is good but service mediocre, or if the service is great but food alright, etc . I believe there is just a few perfect places and its unfair to . But when all (or most) factors are just bad..it leaves me a very sour taste.

The food was good. Ill give them that..Average AYCE flavor. Rolls had a little too much rice but tasted pretty good and the selection was pretty big. The menu carries a lot of different roll styles and plenty of appetizers . The fish on the nigiri is not cut very thin so you get a good taste of it and they do put a little wasabi between the fish
and rice that gives a little kick as well.

The chef and the whole staff in general were very cold and simply not caring to an extent that we felt like they were doing us a favor for letting us eat there. It all started when we asked for a miso soup and never got it and the chef questioned us like we were lying.Then,I had to order my drink 3 times, and did not get one refill on it for the
whole 45 minutes they allow you to be there. Which brings me to the next point : At the 42 minutes mark our server came and dropped the check and said your time is up. I was a server so for me this  was a pretty rude approach but let me explain you why I got annoyed .

While ordering our nigiri and rolls. The chef was constantly forgetting to make the items and decided to just watch some good ol' TV. I tried using my telekinetic powers to call his attention but ended up having to use the classic ""excuse me"" around 8 times . Then when I recited the forgotten order to him, he then proceeded to make
it wrong (cucumber on no cucumber, 1 order instead of 2, etc). At one point he decided to stop making our order and went to the back for about 10 minutes. At a place where there are clocking your time like Nazis, 10 minutes is a lot, add to those the times he was profoundly concentrated on his jerry springer episode while ignoring us. So out of the 45 minutes , we might have had a chef for around 25.
It saddens me specially  when it's the service part that kills the experience which happens to be the part that you can fully control as a business. And what saddens me the most is that I cant make a funny review this time.

You might be thinking..oh there was a language or cultural barrier, but no. Ive been to places where I cant even communicate with my server but had a much more pleasant experience. Japanese, Indian, etc you name it .Its all about attitude and body language . Im sad to report I wont be coming to this joint again.",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,4,2,2,nCGxhS4UJnTe8MHfFfN_uw

Ill leave my sushi cravings for nobu and kabuto. Only came here because someone told me they serve authentic traditional japanese sushi.. This place is as far from traditional as sushi goes, not a lot of choices and not so great fish. If you don't know sushi isn't fresh (only certain dishes like sweet shrimp or clam killed on the spot) Sushi can sit for weeks in a freezer building flavor like cured meat, so when people say the fish wasn't fresh they are probably white haha JK or eat rolls covered in sauce. Take my word for it this place probably makes good rolls of sushi but as far as traditional sushi the real stuff that i only eat ill pass on that. The service here was great well only because there was no one there. The atmosphere is very cater to white people on the inside the outside its just another store in a parking lot. Overall like i said before if you want real sushi one your gonna have to pay for it and well you get what you pay for. Overall the only thing i like about this spot is the all you can eat which makes my girlfriend happy and the fact that the chef (owner) was very friendly and honest because we stuck to ordering sushi only no rolls and not all you can eat but he told us at the end of the night it would be cheaper for us to just go with all you can eat so they are very kind and honest about that and i thank you.",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,0,0,2,3VEex0dkGPadSVmP2i9b1A

Can you say All You Can Drink?  And I am not even a drinker!  Anyway, this AYCD promotion is valid during dinner time on Sundays and Mondays.  Which is a great deal when you only have to pay the regular $26.95 dinner AYCE price.  House sake or Bud Light are the alcohol you can get with this deal, or Coke, Sprite or iced tea for the non-alchies.

I came here for dinner as part of an event setup by a Sushi group on Meetup. Although our entire party was Asian from various countries, the restaurant seems to attract a broad spectrum of customers, which is always nice to see.

Like just about all the AYCE sushi restaurants in town, Uni, Ama Ebi are limited to one order per person, even though you will not find them on the AYCE menu.  But their selection of nigiris and rolls are enough to fill both sides of their AYCE menu. And if the chefs are not super busy, they will make whatever you want as long as they have the ingredients on hand. My new favorite is masago with quail egg on top of cooked shrimp, which is a fancy version of the masago and quail egg that I typically ordered.  Thanks Sushi Chef for pimping my roll :)

5939168,2013-02-04,33,Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,"Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting décor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a ""secret menu"" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in ""Goodfellas"" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is ""Omakase"" and they take care of everything for me.

My betches and I were craving sushi, and we didn't want anything on the strip. After a 20 minute cab ride, we arrived here.
