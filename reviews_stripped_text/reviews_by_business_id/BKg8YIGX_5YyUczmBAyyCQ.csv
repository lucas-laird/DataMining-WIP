The last restaurant here didn't have is coming back for more but China Passion will be our new go to for Chinese food. We were a little apprehensive upon entering and seeing the menu handwritten on poster board and taped to the wall. They did have colored laminated menus too as we discovered. The lunch specials range from $6.25  to $ $6.75 which includes egg flower soup for dine in. Very good soup. The entree, egg roll, fried rice and noodles come  with the meal as well as crispy noodles and duck sauce. We had Mongolian beef and orange chicken. Everything was delicious. Even the crispy noodles and duck sauce which I usually don't eat because they are greasy and tasteless were good. The inside decor and seating could be elevated but I want is good food at reasonable price in a clean restaurant.

955082,2017-03-25,1,BKg8YIGX_5YyUczmBAyyCQ,"Well, I finally took a leap of faith, and caved into the very impressive reviews on Yelp, of China Passion, by placing my first order. This is definitely an establishment I've been eyeing for quite some time now, as I am a Chinese food fanatic! So, after seeing an astounding 5 star rating, I decided now would be the time to see what all the hype is about...and, in regards to my overall impression, I was underwhelmed, to say the least. 

So, I initially planned to order delivery through the Yelp app, however after seeing that the restaurant offers a free appetizer to those who phone in their orders, I opted to do just that. I placed the call around 2pm March 22, 2017. The woman who answered the phone was very pleasant and knowledgeable when I inquired about the free appetizer deal. I ordered- 4 egg rolls, crab Rangoon, shrimp fried rice, shrimp chow mein, and general tso chicken. I was told that the 4 egg rolls would be my free appetizer and thus the charge would be omitted from the balance (and thank goodness for that! I'll explain shortly). I was given my total ($33, approx.) and told that I should expect delivery between 45-55 min. Pretty average wait time, so I wasn't complaining. 

3pm rolled around and still no delivery. No big deal. I just decided to give them a call to get a status update. I was told that my order had indeed left and to give the driver a few more minutes to arrive. At around 3:10 I heard the delivery guy run to my door. We exchanged greetings and he was very apologetic about having been late, which I'm not really one who makes a fuss if my order is not overwhelmingly past the promised time of delivery, so all was fine. I paid my bill, tipped him and the next thing I did was feel the cover of the food on top. It was definitely hot. Yes!!

So, my next task was to inspect each of the containers holding the items I ordered. First up were the crab Rangoon and the complimentary egg rolls (4). The crab Rangoon looked great, size was decent, but the egg rolls were not at all what I expected, appearance or texture wise. They were a lot smaller than I'm used to, and they looked soggy, but whatever. Anyways, before proceeding to open the rest of the containers, I had to try these Rangoon's and egg rolls. Crab Rangoon? A+! Oh, so very good! They were crispy where they needed to be, creamy and bursting with flavor. I wish I'd ordered two! Now, I was on to the egg rolls and here is where I started to worry about what the remainder of the food would look/taste like. The egg rolls? Um, no. I took one bite and was immediately disappointed. They tasted just as they looked...soggy, and the veggies inside were mushy. I even contemplated re-frying them to at least give that crispy texture known to egg rolls, but figured that would be ridiculous considering they likely had been previously prepared in oil, so the extra fat/calories would've been too much. Besides, by continuing the cooking process, I would essentially be making the veggies inside even more mushy. Overall, I just felt that the frozen egg rolls I typically purchase are more satisfying, and that's why I made the reference above about being thankful for not having to pay for them. So, I move on to the other items. The shrimp chow mein looked decent, as did the shrimp fried rice and the general tso chicken. Portion sizes of the three I thought was sufficient for the price. As far as taste goes, I felt the chow mein was okay, but lacked the depth of flavor I'm familiar with and there were hardly any shrimp present (I had a hard time trying to shuffle through the dish to find shrimp, which were rather tiny, BTW). 
I encountered the same issue with there being a ""lack of shrimp"" in the shrimp fried rice. There just wasn't much there. In fact, I wouldn't have known it was shrimp fried by first glance, so again I had to pry my way through to find the few shrimp that were included. Also, when I opened it's container all I could smell was fried egg. It was a little off-putting. The taste was okay though. And lastly, the general tso chicken. The taste was strange to me. At first I thought it tasted too salty. I continued to sample it, to try and discern what was off about it. I couldn't put my finger on it, though. I know that it definitely lacked that traditional sweet/spicy, ( I requested medium spice) robust flavor that's generally present in general tso. 

With all that said, I felt that overall the food was certainly fresh. Would I return? I probably would not, but I do recommend others check this place out for themselves because my, or anyone else's for that matter, personal tastes, expectations, etc may be entirely different than what someone else prefers and should not be used as a determent to trying any establishment.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,3,Ag26RtDaOvrhb4JAMZRchQ

And the food,  forget it.   My friends order the Family of 2  for $27.   Holy Cow,  the food just kept on coming,  and I ordered Shrimp in Lobster Sauce.

The portion sizes were HUGE! We actually laughed when he brought the food out, it was so much. 
Our server, the same young men a lot of other reviewers are speaking so well of, was amazing and attentive. 
The Wor Wonton soup was the best wonton soup ever, though I think they should consider adding green onion to it. ;)
The sweet and sour chicken was the best I've ever had, and is literally perfect.
The noodles were so so yummy as well.
The hunan beef was not what I expected, but only because I didn't read the menu well and had never gotten it before. It's very crunchy and tasty, but if you're looking for a chewy/tender texture I don't recommend it.

However, the food is yummy. It's clear everything is made to order and the portions are very generous. Beef broccoli is abundant with beef, no skimping on the protein. Sweet and Sour is almost 100% meat with a little veg as garnish.

The order taker apologized that they were busy and it would take about 50-55 minutes. Exactly 50 minutes after hanging up, the doorbell rang! The Buddha's Delight (veggies in a light garlic sauce) was cooked just a bit more tender past crisp - perfect in my book and the sauce was flavorful without being overpowering. The Shrimp Chow Fun was excellent, the shrimp were, again, perfectly cooked. The Crab Egg Foo Young was simply the best I've ever had! I've never been a fan of the standard ""over-cooked-hockey-pucks-soaked-in-gravy"" but these were very different! Light and fluffy egg holding just enough filling and once again, perfectly cooked, with the gravy on the side. The Chow Mein ($2.50 to upgrade as a side from steamed rice) was good, too. It had a completely different flavor than the Chow Fun. Halfway through dinner, my fiance said ""Throw out every other Chinese menu we have, this is the only place I want to order from!""
  The portions are big, (we are light eaters) but we had left-over Egg Foo Young for breakfast and the extra Chow Fun noodles for a light lunch.

Not only is the food good, but the portions are twice as much as you would get at any of the chain Chinese restaurants, and at a reasonable price.  The place could use some atmosphere and decoration and I'll hope that comes eventually.  China Passon seems to do a great delivery business and I've heard them tell customers that they have several orders ahead of them and it may be awhile and the phone continues to ring.  I have requested my food with special sauces, my rice a certain way, and they have always met my demands.

The food was well cooked and hot when it arrived well within the expected time, less than an hour. There was a small mistake with one item, but the restaurant was immediately apologetic as well as bringing us the missed item, they brought some cold sodas. 

They were very busy, and the error wasn't a huge deal, but how quickly they fixed it settled them into being our new fav place for Chinese-American food. It is very appreciated to have a business care that much that their customers are happy. 

We stuck to the fairly typical foods, so I'm not going to list them all. The flavours were well developed and balanced without anything being too sweet or salty. Everyone, and that in itself is extraordinary as we have some picky eaters, was pleased and had only good things to say about their food. 

Servings were large and will likely feed us for several days.

Let me start with the servers. They are really nice. It's a family restaurant and they really take care of diners. The first couple visits we had were great. They would sometimes offer free appetizers. Their serving sizes were huge. Prices were reasonable. 

On our last visit, we ordered some chicken curry. It was not as great as the other curries we've had but it was fine. It had a weird jelly looking texture. They also forgot to give us our rice with the curry. We tried to ask for the rice but it got busy so we had to wait (for awhile) until we actually got it. 

The next day, my boyfriend and I had diarrhea. It was horrible.

Our first two visits were exceptional, it really set the bar high for them. That's why I was so disappointed with the last one. Plus, the symptoms came at a really bad time for me, I was at work...

Years later as a middle aged man, my goal is to try every Las Vegas valley Chinese restaurant around the Chinatown (excluding 1 star and sanitary challenged ones). The neat thing about experimenting with new Chinese restaurants is that you hit gold and find a fabulous one. When I found China Passion, it seems that I struck gold. 

 China Passion is not in my neck of the woods. However, it is in Sam's Town and Boulder Station's neck of the woods in the Albertson's-anchored shopping center at the northwest corner of Nellis Boulevard and Vegas Valley Drive. 

 With the intention of visiting Sam's Town, the highly rated China Passion Yelp reviews convinced me to give the restaurant a try. I am of the opinion that if they keep up the high Yelp ratings that  they will be worthy of the ""People Love Us on Yelp"" window sticker. 

 I arrived a couple of minutes before the 11:00 a.m., opening. At the time I was the only one in this medium sized full service restaurant that also offers take out service. Right off the bat, the friendly man welcomed me to the restaurant before performing the role of waiter. 

 Thanks to a Yelper's pictures of the menu, I was aware of the lunch special. One more time I will shout out loud that a lunch special in a good Chinese restaurant is one of the best deals. For $6.25, I ordered the pepper steak with onions combo. It included fried rice, soft chow mein noodles, spring roll, a bowl of egg flower soup, crunchy noodles with duck sauce, and a fortune cookie. For an additional $1.50, I ordered bottomless Coke. From the vantage point of my booth, I could see the kitchen where they cooked my Chinese food. 

 The crunchy noodles with duck sauce were crunchy. Usually, the quality of the noodles give me a sneak peak to what the quality of the food that follows is. The tasty noodles gave me the right impression because the bowl of egg flower soup that followed was superb. I can only imagine how they make my favorite soup in the world: wonton soup.

  The main event was likewise superb. To main event was so large that I was thinking that the waiter might of served me the dinner portion. The large portion equated to quality equals quantity. I couldn't finish it all, regardless of how tasty it was. I enjoyed the rice. The soft chow mein noodles were superior to some of the Chinese restaurants that serve it as filler. The bean sprouts interspersed with the noodles created a nice flavor. To add superior flavor to the soft chow mein noodles I reached over to the Sriracha sauce then poured it over them. By the way, the waiter had asked me if I wanted all fried rice or half noodles and fried rice. The spring roll was allright. In all honesty, I am a fan of the egg roll in lieu of the spring roll. Ultimately, the beef pepper steak with onions was very good. 

  All this food that I described with a drink added up to $8.58 after taxes. With the generous tip added on, this full service meal in a Chinese restaurant came out to the same or even less than a fast food meal in Panda Express. 

  My only complaint is that on a heated July afternoon when it was in the triple digit temperature that the air conditioning should of been on and the overhead fans spinning. I was hot. The inside temperature was a contributing factor to passing over finishing the large plate of food. 

Overall, China Passion is a winner. From the time I entered to the time the waiter said, ""Please visit again soon,"" at the end; I felt like I was welcomed here. If I lived in the area, I would visit again soon.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,17,15,4,itJOzPEzg8M2d0E9-RLI-Q

The food is delicious as well! I really enjoyed the cashew chicken, and you can taste the fresh vegetables. They also have humongous portions. I was starving before I came in, and we ordered the egg rolls, wontons, egg drop soup, cashew chicken in place of the string bean chicken, and the orange beef. Now, I thought this was going to be plates with sides of chow mein, and rice. I was wrong. The portions we got, we didn't even put a dent in(and we often go to Mexican places with HUGE portions if that tells you anything).

Their menu is very large and has all the typical Chinese dishes you'd expect. Its your usual Americanized Chinese dishes, but they are all done very well. I wish they had a few more authentic dishes but hardly any body does outside of china town.

Their portion sizes are huge! When my wife and I order a family meal for two its usually enough for us to make four or five meals out of. They make very good chow mein and fried rice, and if you don't want a family meal you can up charge the white rice with any entrée for $3.

When we walked in we were pleasantly greeted and given menus. We decided to try their lunch special. My man had Mongolian beef and it came with fried rice and noodles. I tried the Kung poa chicken also with fried rice and noodles. They brought us out spring rolls and egg drop soup along with the won ton noodles 1st.
The egg drop soup was great...it's one of my favorites. This one had corn kernels in it also which I have had before but my man hasn't.  
I am so picky about meat and can never normally eat the Mongolian beef but I always tey it anyways...well this was a first...it was delicious. Perfectly tender and melted in my mouth. I don't think he liked that I could actually eat his dish! ;) the noodles and rice...perfect! My Kung poa chicken was good ...but wasn't very poa-ish...I like it a little hotter. But it was good!
The staff was sooooo friendly and attentive. 
The food portion given was HUGE...enough for 2 meals! We took an entire 2 boxes home. It didn't even look like we ate anything. Our bill was less than $20! We will definitely be back!!!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,0,0,5,ws64wCWqjF1VGmVUf4VbEg

I actually only came hear because I heard they had Honey walnut shrimp.

We both ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp and for $11 ea. You can easily count about 20+ pieces on our plate. And for this dish is good amount given that it contains a lot and is actually pretty big pieces. I was stuffed after this plate. 

It was weird because at first I wanted to get the 2 vegetable rolls as appetizers but I didn't want to walk out rolling. So I didn't. But half way through our plates the waiter brought us the 2 vegetable rolls as complimentary. Probably because I called for them in mind. I think mostly because it was our first time here. Lol thank you for that!

The honey walnut contains quite a lot of honey, walnuts and at the bottom lettuce. Which at first it seems to not go but once you eat it tastes very good like it's good to add some veggies. 

Overall the service was great, the food was tasty and I'm sure ill be back for more. 2 of those plates and 2 drinks was $30. Thank your for the service it is very hospitable. Pics included....",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,4,1,5,HnkYC953Ze0xYlW7bYCX2Q
5554411,2016-06-05,1,BKg8YIGX_5YyUczmBAyyCQ,"They have no right to charge what they do ($11.25) per dish in such a dive place!  Their food is at best ordinary, not any better than mall food.  The lunch special is mostly fried rice & noodles which doesn't leave much room for the entre.  It is insulting that they reopen and immediately raise their prices.  The menu was new but had crossed out prices with higher prices written with black marker.  They had a sign in the window ""2 for 1 Baba drinks"" & a guy came in to get two drinks & they didn't have any so he left.  Also they have noisy Coke coolers that run way to loud.  They need to work on the interior: table cloths, better chairs & tables that all match, dump the old booths, fix the hole in the wall, get decent menus, put up some kind of window treatment so diners don't see all the crack addicts walking by.

At best this is a take out place, not nice enough for guest dining.  I'm sad that Wok My World is gone, the food was so much better & cheaper.  It wasn't very pretty inside but the food made up for it.  Now, this place is ugly, food is not very good & the prices are too high.

Good luck to them, they will need it.",IncLtw7wG_msJRpEd7morA,2,0,1,3JnSs3yGJz3EA0q2ZI65jg

First time here came on Christmas Day and they were opened! Immediately greeted by young man server, for dine in. While we decided what to order crispy things were brought out (YUM!)
Decided on a combination plate, salt and pepper pork chips, also ended up getting egg rolls and egg drop soup (which I think was called egg flour soup on the menu?) 
The food took regular amount of time to be served, egg drop soup was amazing! It was cold outside so it was very satisfying, good taste, not bland at all. When the entrees came out I was very surprised, not expecting huge quantities!! Definitely a huge bonus as this is not only lunch but leftovers for dinner as well! 
The salt and pepper pork chop came with steamed rice, with options to upgrade to fried rice or noodles. Salt and pepper pork chop #1. Generous portions some bone in pieces, it was completely satisfying and even though this is the first thing I tried here, I would have to say this is my favorite!

The egg rolls were good as well, and the service was on point! Young man was very nice, super polite and checked up on us the right amount. 

I will definitely be coming back here (: 

BONUS: came back later that same day to order more food, got salt pepper calamari, sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, and an order of combination fried rice.
