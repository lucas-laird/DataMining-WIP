45494,2012-02-13,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"I do love me some waffles...So why not try Waffles Cafe? 

Located on Durango and Centennial near 7-Eleven and Slidin Thru. I decided to give Waffles Cafe a try since I haven't had a decent waffle in a long time. I was greeted by the cashier who was very friendly and helpful. As I looked at the menu, I asked him about the pizza waffles and waffle sandwiches. I thought it seemed kind of odd but he suggested that they were really good. They had a variety of different waffles to choose from, I didn't know if I should be bold and just go for the pizza waffle or play it safe and get a regular waffle with any fruit topping I wanted. Decisions, decisions, decisions...I ended up getting a chocolate waffle with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I was not disappointed!  I also ordered a iced Chai Tea, which was okay. 

Not only do they serve waffles but they also have Boba, what a way to finish up your meal!",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,4,4AAL7vaV5WUdGVpozHoY7w
47297,2011-04-23,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"Decided to take the family for a late Saturday breakfast .  The waffles were quite tasty, and the fruit toppings were fresh.  Great selections and variety.  The place had a ""local"" moms/pops feel to it which was nice.  The breakfast waffle came with eggs and choice of meat...and unlimited coffee.  My daughter ordered the Yooni special which was so yummy- strawberries, bananas topped with chocolate sauce and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream, almost too pretty to eat!  My son devoured a plain waffle topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream (we added bananas for a small add'l charge).  

Pros:  Variety, taste, fresh fruit, price and friendliness of staff. 
Cons:  Waffles were kind of cold, no refills on soda (cans)

Overall, it was a good experience.",r1Oz5bRBY5FZbzeg33CYjw,0,0,3,QtR-S_8TeOkg3vLzmUfqwg

418057,2011-02-21,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"Pro's:  The Waffles Cafe is tasty and has wonderful creativity.  Where else can you get a ham and bacon waffle sandwich that also tastes good (it's the special sauce)?  They have a good variety of interesting waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dessert.  They use fresh ingredients (avacado on your waffle, anyone?) They have fantastic drinks and smoothies and the atmosphere has a quaint, fun, local feeling to it.  I thoroughly enjoy the Waffle Cafe and return often.

Con's:  The paper plates and plasticware leave something to be desired.  And although the prices aren't bad, one does pay a tad more for something you'd otherwise have to make at home.  Depending on the time of day, you might have to wait 10-15 minutes for your food, other times it's to you in 5.",a7XUXEq8sQWh2CxDWmMG5w,0,0,4,gPNMc7U6VtbcdPmz52LYfQ

Honestly, I feel like I'd be better off buying a waffle-maker and making this stuff on my own at home.   I would save money, get better service AND I wouldn't have to try to eat a thick waffle with a plastic fork and knife!",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,2,1,2,KA2z9sF4-b292zty0x81cA

443661,2014-08-17,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"I went here with my daughter and she got a pumpkin pancake.  I ordered the breakfast special.  I was fasting for a glucose test, and chose to break it here, and preggo so very very hungry.  Staff was friendly, coffee was mediocre, my waffle was inedible.  I'm not sure what happened, but it tasted like a lot of baking soda.  There was no substance to it either. Kinda like the turkey on Chevy Chase Christmas vacation.  If you haven't seen that movie, you are missing out...
 The pumpkin waffle was pretty good, nothing outstanding.  The fruit was really fresh.  It was a bit run down inside, there was a fan going in the front middle of the floor.  The mismatched paper plates gave it a cheap feel, which was not cool or trendy in any way.  I was disappointed overall.  Based on other reviews I'm guessing my bad waffle was a fluke (benefit of the doubt).  
What would bring me back...
1.fresh roasted coffee (buy the beans from a local roaster or something and charge a bit more) 
2. fresh half and half (mini moos are just gross, everyone knows that stuff is full of chemicals, allowing it stability at room temp for eons,)
3.real plates, or at least presentation that shows you care about presentation, show some pride in your waffles!  Not mine, the ones you usually serve, I think...
4. a little spruce up inside (time to redecorate!) Again show some pride.  Those toy/candy machines have to go, and fix your AC!
5. And obviously, a waffle that's better than what I failed to eat.  Thankful the bacon and eggs were OK...
What I liked-
1. Friendly staff
2. Concept of a menu based on a waffle, including pizza, sandwiches, sundaes, and hard to find seasonal flavors...punky punkin!
3. Its fast.  You could capitalize on this with cool to go packaging.  Possibly a drive thru, and great coffee.",neiq8iMdR0cK8sYI55O8Rw,0,0,3,7mf_xtuANseLBT3skDVdIg

I ordered the Yooni's favorite, topped with strawberry and banana slices, whipped cream, ice cream and chocolate syrup.

As far as the service is concerned, I guess maybe that's contingent upon how many people are in the establishment at any given moment.

Decor: Upon walking in to the restaurant, you'll find tables and chairs that remind you of a courthouse diner. They're pretty basic but get the job done. This place isn't fancy, so just throw on a hoodie and head over.

Food: The waffles are probably the only food item on the menu that is made from scratch. I have had the breakfast special several times now, and I'm positive the turkey sausage is the frozen/microwave kind, while the eggs are powdered or liquid. The food is pretty average, and I would only suggest coming here if you don't feel like driving the extra 2 blocks to Denny's. 

Takeout: When ordering takeout, be sure to check your bag for all of the necessary condiments. Last time I ordered a waffle to go, I was not provided with syrup.",-xVqWqhOMFN7X35ME-IA6w,0,0,3,-dorSIDrjhkiFUo_i2bPLg

As for my food, my fruit topped oat waffle was a bit on the crisp side.  I had to add some syrup to soften it up.  Not to mention it was hella small.  And my son was not happy with his pepperoni pizza waffle either. I tried a piece and the marinara sauce tasted like a canned spaghetti sauce.

Boba Smoothie: Not Good at all. To Sweet. I asked if its frech Fruit. He Said yes but it didnt tasted like fresh. More a powderd cheap Way Too Sweet Drink.3.50$ 
Choc waffle: dry i mean really dry. You Need 2 Cups water After Eating it. 
Not Good at all. 
Topping: Mango. The mango was Hard really Hard Not ready to eat hard & sour.

1847272,2012-08-14,1,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"Food 9/10 Best waffle's I've had in Vegas ever. Highly recommend the flax waffle. 

Drinks 7/10 Standard soft drinks, breakfast combo comes with unlimited coffee, Thai Tea had too much thai tea and not enough condensed milk (aka way too orange)

Environment 8/10 Good breakfast sunshine from the windows in the morning, and nice and cool during the hot summer days. Not a fan of Styrofoam plates and cups when eating in, but its understandable. 

Enjoyment 9/10 I have gone to this place at least two dozen times. Great food, great family, and very accommodating if anything went wrong. 

Overall 33/40 = 82.5% = 4 stars. 

I grew up in the east coast, DC area to be exact. When most people think of a Waffle house, one can't help but think of Fried Chicken and Belgian waffles and a slightly dirty Denny's style diner. Sadly that's what I thought of when I first approached ""WaffleS"". This was not the case

First impression is its super clean environment and bright lights. It's definitely not an ethnic style waffle house. This is done asian style, hence the 'Cafe in WaffleS Cafe. And I can tell you I'm definitely a fan of this place. The first time going there you'll get a small culture shock as all your stereotypes get blown out of the water, THEN you'll get a little shock at the different varieties and styles of waffles you can choose from, literally a plethora of combinations. 

When you decide from choosing between a standard, pizza, or sandwich waffle, you have 5 types of batter. From there, there's a a few dozen toppings from anchovies to strawberries, lets not forget all the syrups and such. 

If you want a waffle your way you will get it your way. My personal favorite is the standard flaxseed waffle with maple syrup. But if i feel a little indulgent, you can't help but try Yooni's Favorite: Plain Waffle, with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate syrup.",tX5Qzrg-ExCB2etafYaFRA,4,1,4,7MBF5Ux9eyxR1auN4YHZVw

on to the review.

first, walked in and I'm hit with a smell/stench. it smells like..you know when throw up dries on clothing and you get a wif of it? that was my first thought when I walked in.

sat down with the fam at a table with a open coke can on it and looked over to the menu on the wall. they do a good presentation of the images of the waffles, so I got the breakfast meal with oj. also got some scramble eggs and a waffle pizza.

waited about 8-10 minutes before some of the food got dropped off. this is where the 1 star came in.

when you pay $30+ for food, you don't expect your meal on paper plates. as soon as I saw the plate I thought ""oh fantastic this is going to be a waste"". and there my 2 eggs with dried, flat cheap bacon sat on a small round paper plate you find at target. then the waffle on a large white plate you find probably from Costco.

also when a restaurant has waffle in the name, they should really make sure their batter is kicking and cooked properly. the waffles come kind of well done, not fluffy or soft with crisp edges and there's a scoop of warm margarine, not then real butter.

rest of the food dropped off, nothing special at all. paper plates, plastic forks, aftermarket orange juice in a 16oz see thru plastic cup. just garbage presentation and food all around.

I just waited for everyone to finish, annoyed, wanting to get out of here. 

if I wanted a Costco meal I'd go get samples for free. 

poor presentation, poor quality food, one star is what they get. will not be coming back.

another suggestion is don't skimp and penny pinch on quality to serve value. we would have been better off going to McDonald's to get the breakfast plate, 3 of them.",Px6w_kTNBuy0GceThHnccw,5,0,1,er3ljGMF3PjOreg3XBPeSA

The shopping center is questionable. There are only 3 restaurants occupying the property, yet every window has signs of new-coming restaurants moving in. I think there was 8 other restaurant signs and all under construction. So random b/c my bf's lived there for 1.5 yrs and its been an empty plaza. 

Tried the waffle sandwich w/ bacon, ham, cheese, and advocado. It was really good! There was a slight sweetness in the waffles(?) which made the sandwich sweet and salty. Bf ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, it was good but mine was so much better. I really want to try their sweet waffles but we were hungry for lunch not dessert.. that just means must return soon!! 

The restaurant was open and big. The guy who greeted and took our order was really pleasant. Gave me free coffee! The menu was small and simple easy to order.

And we also got their choclate strawberry waffle thing. Can't go wrong with this combination. Yum.

There are so many choices of waffles and some pretty interesting ones. Did I mention I love waffles? I need to try all the varieties, but only had room for 2 different waffles to share with the bf.

When we went here for a late breakfast, it was pretty quiet. Only 2 other people inside from what I remember. But as we sat waiting for our food and eating it, there was decent traffic of people ordering waffles to go. It is nice that they have different flavored batters for their waffles.

Must say, the idea of this place is great. Almost a dream come true. And though the waffles were yummy, they were not superb. It did have a different flavor from the traditional waffle and healthier?

2323320,2011-02-14,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"Went here with family recently for breakfast based on good reviews.  It is a very simple place, with several tables and a counter where you order.  Basically you look at the big waffle based menu on the wall and seat yourself and wait for your order.  There is a good selection of waffle types, such as chocolate, pumpkin, flax, and regular, and a wide variety of toppings you can pay to add.  There are also waffle pizzas and waffle sandwiches, so make no mistake, waffles are the focus here. 

Our experience was not exactly stellar.  We were 4, and ordered and sat down.  The silverware is plastic silverware and paper plates, which is not exactly the most convenient way to eat a meal, if one has ever gone picnicking.  We ordered 3 waffles, and a side of eggs and a sausage.  It took 57 minutes to receive.  FIFTY SEVEN minutes.  The place was moderately full, but not a single person came in after us.  The food itself was not bad, but it was not sensational either.  It was basic waffles that one could make at home, with some scarce toppings put on top ($.50 for a dollop of whipped cream and another $.50 for 3 strawberries sliced up).  The eggs were just simple scrambled eggs.  Now, while the food did not turn me off, it did nothing to instill me with a burning desire to return, and after a near HOUR long wait for what should have taken 10 minutes tops, I will not be back.  The guy at the counter tossed us a couple of $5 coupons, but it came when they brought us the food, and there was nothing said in the intervening hour.  No ""hey sorry it is taking an eternity...this is why..."" or anything of the sort.

Overall, I give it 2 stars since the food itself was acceptable, and I like to reserve 1 stars for places that are utterly disgusting.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,2,0,2,j9IcBqpLwyrEcom1nFx9QQ

2340751,2016-03-06,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"A quick review.  A small Ma & Pa-style breakfast joint.  It's located in a little strip mall with inexpensive furnishings and food is served on paper plates/cups with plastic utensils. It might be time for them to do a little touch up painting in the dining room too.  Don't expect much other than some decent and inexpensive food. I do need to comment that the waffles were REALLY good, despite the spartan layout. Another plus is they offer a 10% military discount. 

The young men working there were pleasant and helpful in aiding us in a menu selection.  You go direct to the counter and order and they bring the food to you at your selected table.   The tables we sat at had both been cleared, but not wiped down, which is probably not a good idea considering that waffle syrup is a staple condiment. Breakfast included unlimited coffee refills, but you need to go get it yourself. 

FYI, they do not have a soft drink dispenser, so if you order a Coke, they will bring a can and a cup of ice...kinda like they do in Europe. 

All in all, not an unpleasant exoerience, but we'll keep searching for a North Las Vegas breakfast favorite. Can't for the life of me figure out how anyone could rate this a 5 star...NEVER.",zDi5kBeyhMYZ55tqPpcxXA,2,0,2,qUeUOfOadG2WroEuE29pvg

I proceeded to have a conversation with the guy at the register, turns out he's one of the co-owners.  He was a great guy.  He explained to me that they used to have high school kids work there but then they started reading bad reviews on them mentioning customer service so now he works there all the time.  I love that!  He cares about what us customers have to say.  So heads up to anyone that might've had a bad customer service situation with them in the past.  I went on a weekday morning and there was only one group of people in there before me.  The lady of that group put 2 dollars in the tip jar and thanked the co-owner specifically for the customer service and said she loved her food.

I was happy to find that they had boba drinks (odd for a waffle place, right?), but noticed they were pricier than my favorite standalone boba location. It was $4.50 for a large Thai tea w/ boba. Again, it only tasted okay. (I would gladly pay $5 for super tasty boba.) Even though I received a stamp card, I won't be coming back here.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,5,2,2,zBamEPTRHKRjkyO7-R7TPA

The decor in here definitely needs updating and some style, it sort of feels like you're eating in the teacher's lounge of an elementary school. Nothing here really makes you want to stay and hang out, just finish your meal and bounce. Good thing decor doesn't diminish my appetite or I would be about 30lbs lighter, seriously Vegas you need a major overhaul when it comes to restaurant style and atmosphere. 

The waffles here are good, lightly sweetened which went well with the salty breakfast options. I ordered the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich; sausage, ham, eggs and cheese. This was definitely a meal, the portion was huge and filling, but doesn't leave you wanting more. It's like watching an ""OK"" movie; you've already forgotten the main character's name ten minutes after it's over. One more thing about this meal, it's served with a side of Ruffles potato chips, huh? How about side of syrup or a sweet jam for dipping? 

The service is very good and fast, but I'm assuming that's because they cooked my meal with a microwave. I mean when you can hear the beeps and clicks of the radiation machine in back and your food comes out piping hot within five minutes of it being ordered... ugh.

The food was good, the service was good, and nothing was remotely close to great. I feel like there's a real lack effort with Waffles Cafe, they're doing the bare minimum and giving the bare minimum. A new coat of paint, waffles made to order and maybe a few special touches to the menu and this place could easily have a higher rating and possibly become more of a hangout spot.

It was very cramped and loud. The tables, floors, and walls could have used a really heavy duty scrubbing. This place is another example of Americans being offered very unhealthy foods. These type of dishes with high calories and little nutrition should be saved for a day at the county fair. 
I ordered one pumpkin waffle with apple toppings. I passed on the ice cream and whipped cream, but I still could only down half of the waffle and I felt very heavy afterwards. The order took about 10 minutes to make it to the table. The bf said he saw an employee scoop ice out of the machine with his bare hand... Not my idea of sanitary-- The other employees were wearing gloves while making the meals. The employees seemed hard working and pleasant.

The waffle was extremely light for a Belgian waffle. It was crisp which I didn't  mind except it was so light. Usually Belgian waffles are full and filling this was not the case with this waffle.

Waffle sandwiches, waffle pizzas, make your own waffles, waffle platters. You name it(including a waffle) and they will probably make it.

The smoothies were interesting, I'm not really sure if they were made out of real fruit. They could have been a little fruit and a lot of ice cream, but something about them was just kind of weird and artificial. Not an ideal description of a smoothie.

3737419,2014-01-19,0,T5nTtSCSRoEYMsZPhF61wg,"This café has seriously upped the breakfast game. They serve up buttery waffle-icous meals: Waffle Pizzas (saaaay whaaat?!), Waffle Sandwiches, Waffle Sundaes and Classic Waffles w/ endless toppings(see photos for menu/prices). There are lots of add on options so you can create the waffle of your dreams. All the ingredients are top quality, and you can taste it.  

What we ordered:

My fiancé ordered the classic waffle sandwich. The waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp crunch on the outside. The waffle was stuffed with  layers of crispy bacon, scrambled eggs and ooey-gooey melted cheese: Perfection! 

I ordered the organic flax waffle with sliced bananas, diced strawberries, and chunks of mango with powdered sugar. They didn't skimp on my fresh fruit toppings. Instead,  they loaded that sucker up (just the way I like it). Again, my waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp crunch.  Every bite was like a piece of heaven!  

If you're looking to be WOWed by ambience, keep calm and carry on.  If you're looking for a casual and unique spot to grab breakfast/dessert/lunch, Waffles Café is your place. We loved our breakfast and will be returning sooner than later.

This was my first time here so I wanted the purest version and got it plain. There are other toppings but you have to pay for them.  So it can get pricey.  I got the breakfast special which included eggs and bacon. The eggs were a little runny but I ordered the bacon crunchy and it was PERFECT.

You order the food at the counter and it is served on paper plates.  Dixie paper plates. I get that they want to keep food costs down but to me that is unacceptable and plastic utensils? Not a very environmentally friendly place at all. 

You don't get a server no one asks if everything is okay, it's all self serve and you pay for your food first and if course there is a place to leave a tip. Which I overtipped...

Inside the place is UGLY. It's not inviting at all.  I am not looking for a luxuriously tufted pillow to set my delicate butt on or anything but something in there, ANYTHING could match something else.

My favorite thing to get is breakfast waffle sandwiches (egg, cheese, ham, bacon) which makes for a good bit of savory and sweet. I pour some syrup in mine. The crinkle cut kettle chips are possibly homemade? These are plain, but good. They let me do ice tea as my beverage which is fresh brewed. They also added a water dispenser which is welcoming since I like to drink a lot while eating. My one negative thing is I liked their chicken sandwiches before, except now it seems they use ready made grilled strips. *womp, womp* 

Still, I do like their fluffy style waffles here. It's different from what is usual, but it's a good kind of different. Definitely a plus I can come here in the afternoon and can order breakfast.

The people that work in there and run it to begin with are phenomenal!!! Add that on top of having a deliciously tasting assortment of waffles makes my taste buds and heart go crazy! I am a waffle fanatic by the way so a place like this is a slice of heaven. 

I was very basic and ordered the classic breakfast (waffle, bacon/sausage, eggs). The waffle was good, don't get me wrong omg I've NEVER been served beautiful and hot eggs!!! I can't even keep my eggs that hot when I cook them myself... I'm hating lol. I also ordered a pineapple and peach smoothie (yasssss). I ordered a raspberry white chocolate waffle to go. 

A thoughtful gesture, they waited on cooking my waffle order to go. It was brought out when it looked like we were getting ready to leave. Being the conversationalist that I am, we didn't leave right away which was totally fine. When we did decide to get up and leave, one of the employees says that she'll make me a fresh order. I'm like nooooo that's ok, this will be fine. She continued and then the guy explained how they wanted me to have a more fresh order. My heart filled with even more joy. That was going well above and beyond the expectations of customer service.

Granted I still had about two more stops before I got home, however these waffles were both perfectly fine despite my rough handling of my bags. This place will continue to receive my business and I hope wherever reads this will go and support this particular location of Waffles Cafe as well. There's more that I can add onto this review as of why I  it so much but I'm getting ready to dig into one of my waffles .",ymwuG7mqMGC3FXD3wYT1kA,2,0,5,2ALbD5fKoB_yoDE6mOmLhg

Price range is neat, $6 for a big ass waffle, eggs and bacon. The waffle was amazing in my book, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Eggs. They were eggs. Bacon kinda looked dry and stale to me, which disappointed me at first, but I guess it had a jerky texture to it, so in the end it wasn't that bad at all.

I like how everything is served on disposable utensils. From the paper plates to the plastic forks. I'm an odd germy-phobe, so to not have to worry about whether the dishes were washed properly definitely lifted my spirits.

Seems like they listened to some of our complaints, and finally added some background music!  It is very subtle, but really makes the environment more welcoming.

Service was friendly as always, and the place is clean!

The reason why it got the review bump.....the breakfast sandwich!  It came with eggs, bacon and etc inside a waffle sandwich!  The portion was good for the price ($5.99), and the taste was very good.

Lunch for $6.49: waffle sandwich + chips + soda OR waffle pizza + soda

The Sweet P for $6.95: pumpkin waffle with apple pie filling + vanilla ice cream + caramel + cinnamon

Short Cake Split for $7.45: original waffle + strawberry + banana + vanilla ice cream + chocolate sauce

Banana Split for $6.69: banana + ice cream + chocolate sauce + almond + sprinkles + whipped cream

You can also create your own waffle from $3.95-8.95 (choose from original, oat, flax, chocolate, pumpkin) and add toppings from 75 cents-$1 (walnut, pecan, strawberry, sprinkles, peanut butter, Nutella, chocolate chips, marshmallows, Reese's chips, chocolate sauce, M&M's, caramel sauce, coconut, banana, kiwi, mango, peach, blueberry, raspberry, apple pie filling, cherry pie filling) or maybe get a side of bacon, sausage, egg or wheat toast for $1.50.

I built my own waffle. I had the original with Nutella + strawberries + mangoes. They added powdered sugar and whipped cream on top.  Since I already have Nutella, I didn't put any syrup on my waffle.  The syrups they have include maple, sugar, boysenberry, etc.

Food is served on a paper plate and they'll give you a plastic fork and knife. The downside to that is it's not too appealing but I guess the good thing about that is if you want to take your food to-go, you can just put foil on top and voila!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,5,3,4,QFUeg2NMlGGyAq8Lioh55Q

1) Breakfast waffle sandwich- ham, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and the house sauce all nestled in one delicious, homemade waffle.  It comes with chips as well!

2) Breakfast special- if you are in the mood for a more traditional breakfast, you can pretty much get everything separated.  Two eggs however you like them, bacon or sausage, and a drink.

3) Create your own- your choice of plain, chocolate or pumpkin waffle then whatever toppings you want!  Chocolate waffle with strawberries and bananas is quite good.

It seems like a family run business, the staff is always friendly. I've had the waffle breakfast sandwich and I've had the waffles with eggs and bacon. My daughter loves the pizza waffle. The waffle itself is crunchy in initial texture yielding to the soft and sweet breading inside. It's not fancy or expensive and I've never had a bad experience earing here.

Here you can get waffles every which way- dessert for breakfast (banana split is the best!) or lunch (chicken and waffle sandwich). Prices are a bit high, but really, it's a fresh made waffle with a LOT of toppings and glorious goodness. There are also sandwiches to choose from, like a chicken and waffle one, which a friend said was alright.

Myself and my bf were looking for waffles and after reading the reviews decided to go. Arriving there it looked really empty which SCARED me, but I thought it maybe was because it was 10:00am on a Monday?? The people there were so nice and explained their ""$5.99 Breakfast Special"" which consists of  eggs bacon or sausage and a waffle.Due to me trying to eat better he suggested the ""organic flax seed waffle"" with strawberries. My bf had the waffle with mango and pineapple. We also tried the Boba Thai Tea. Everything was delicious. EVERYTHING. My flax seed waffle had a funnel cake- ish texture almost.It was still light  and soooo good.It was topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream (which he went light on)I also topped it with a little of their strawberry syrup, Divine! The egg whites were awesome, they seemed very fresh. The bacon was ok, nothing special. Even though my bf's waffle was gone in a blink of an eye I did manage to taste some and his regular waffle with the  kiwi and pineapple topping.His fruit topping too were fresh and sweet. Neither one of us have ever had a Boba Tea so this was our first time. Needless to say I'm hooked. It was sweet and creamy. Very good. I like this place because when we left, I didnt feel ""bloated"" or super full as I do with other pancake houses! I also loved that we were in and out of this place in 25 minutes!If you like waffles I suggest you give them a try!",S_6pIhoNUG6QVUmOQUCq-w,1,0,5,cpeeYjKEGFSwp9k2xqd1RQ

We were hungry and thanks to Yelp, we stumbled up on Waffles Cafe. When we walked in, I thought that we were surely in for a bad experience. I looked around and saw paper plates on tables as well as plastic forks and knives. I also saw some interesting looking waffles with a lot of ""stuff"" on them. I'm just a regular waffle kind of guy with just butter and little syrup. My initial thought was that they have all of the ""stuff"" on them to hide a bad waffle. 

I looked at the prices and they were amazingly inexpensive. That was a good start. They had bottomless coffee that tasted really good. I ordered their waffle special which was a waffle, an egg, and bacon or sausage as well as the coffee. It didn't take them long to bring the food. I thought the short wait was reasonable. The bacon and eggs were not anything special. How can you mess that up and yet, how can you make that scrumptious? The waffle? PERFECT! I had just been looking up a recipe for a perfect waffle.

I would like to make an attempt to describe the the waffle. It was very light and had a crunchy crust exterior. It tasted sweet and fluffy, like a fried Cotton candy, but not as sweet. I love lathering syrup on my waffles but I didn't need to this time. 

The eggs were scrambled and layered thoroughly in the sandwich. I love eggs so it was perfect. 

Got Meat!There were generous slices of ham and bacon in the sandwich. The ham was not greasy or salty. Bacon was cooked well and crunchy. It was a nice combination to the ham. 

Say Cheese. The cheese was melted on the eggs and dripped over the ham and bacon. I am not sure if it was American cheese or cheddar, but my mouth liked it. 

So if you are ever in the Vegas area and you're looking for an inexpensive, delicious breakfast place. Go to Waffle cafe!

I ordered the banana split waffle, without the banana. The ice cream on top would have been amazing alone, but the warm buttery waffle underneath it only made it better. The whipped cream and chocolate sauce certainly didn't hurt either.

Their menu is pretty impressive, considering they only do waffles. This is a place that is good for breakfast (obviously), lunch, and dinner. The toppings and possibilities here are endless, and making a choice was quite the task. 

If I do ever end up returning, I am incredibly interested in trying one of their waffle sandwiches. That is if I can resist the banana split waffle again.",MuZwWExL-CaN3uKPkbFngA,0,0,5,ZZuiI2A_3FeHMjfiLTcC7g
