468103,2008-02-19,0,PWjgwphd2prhtqTPWwLbXw,"Corned beef sandwich was so good.  Portion sizes are big and you get tons of meat. Basically all it was, was 2 slices of bread and tons of meat... for about 11 bucks.  Pretty good deal. I was so full i didnt think about food for about 9 hours. The only reason I did was because we had dinner reservations at bouchon. 
Friends ordered:
Brisket sandwich - good but kinda dry compared to corned beef and less flavor. needs some dijon or bbq sauce.
Chicken salad - pretty plain, just a tiny bit of mayo and some lettuce
Turkey sandwich - I didnt try. looked too plain.
Pickles - Good pickles. not too sour or salty. very crispy, right amount of juice inside and even still a hint of cucumber flavor.

3069784,2007-07-15,0,PWjgwphd2prhtqTPWwLbXw,"A nice little deli in the Forum Shops. Beware, they serve large portions that could serve two people. I ordered George Clooney (that's what the sandwich was called) and received two large slabs of meatloaf atop bread (open faced). I ate just about half of it before deciding it would be best for me not to fill up on this. My mom ordered the regular meatloaf dish that was similar to mine, only that hers had mashed potatoes and no bread. We could've easily shared our dish had we known the servings would be so large. I felt bad having wasted all that good meatloaf. Don't let this happen to you. 

If you like pickles, they offer a pickle bucket for a buck and it comes with different kinds of pickles to try.",sd93J2mAZnQga-HVU_Zxyw,1,0,4,Se4GhT2YfV75PKtK2VCIlA

That being said, the matzoh ball soup would have been enough for the two of us, but we went ahead and ordered the whitefish ""appetizer,"" which could have fed four people easy.  The soup was kinda bland, but the matzohs were cooked perfectly.  The whitefish was super yummy, if a bit bony, and served with bagel, cream cheese and the standard tomatoes and cucumbers.  The chocolate egg cream was delish.

We felt guilty for not finishing the whitefish.  I wonder how much food this restaurant wastes?  It's not like Vegas tourists are asking to doggie-bag the left overs.",TEHiUF-e8pa37rByg15MmA,0,0,3,WaCWxjGKLwpKQJL75sgIjA

We were like pissed that everything was a rip off.  I know that seems weird because of course it's that way- it's Vegas, losers.  But we couldn't get past it.

That said, we were happy when we found NY Stage!  After eating unhealthy choices like Sbarro's for a couple days, it was nice to eat a yummy veggie wrap in a spinach tortilla.  My stomach was so grateful.  My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and said the meatballs tasted homemade.  We loved this place's food, but the price even more- we got out of there spending less than $20, which was otherwise almost impossible in Vegas.",XDnlriVXnZgFYXHqphBJ3g,2,1,4,aeswl03LCHkBKhkwGKvlTA

I have to admit that I am spoiled.  Having eaten smoked meat most of my life in Montreal (Schwartz's, Smoke Meat Pete's, Lesters, Snowden Deli).....Stage Deli just doesn't compare.

It was an ok sandwich and the price was excellent.  Having lunch for around $10 in Vegas is a bargain.  I give it a 3-star because of their price and breakfast was decent.    If you ever want a real melt in your mouth smoked meat (pastrami) sandwich, visit Montreal.  It's even better than Carnagie Deli in Manhattan.",RcRhOMoMJuaXLzARqJjNfw,0,0,3,at7ktWGWrepmCh3OQSqRBA

They also had some majorly giant cakes on display too.  We're talking multiple layers, can't fit all the layers in your mouth in one bite, type of cakes here.  I never had the opp to try a slice because I had only eaten breakfast here, but I sure was tempted.

Unfortunately, when I stopped by on my most recent excursion I noticed the location had been boarded up.  No signs indicated whether they moved or if some new business was taking over.  I hope I am mistaken and that they are either renovating or opening in a new location.  Sniff!",uP8qLiZr5zH_5ziDL37S5A,2,2,4,JcgWaLFrS1W4Tq1y4sgyPw

The sandwich was delicious, and huge, but took way too long to make.  I had the David Letterman, which was a huge pile of turkey and a bunch of bacon with tomato, triple decker style, for $10.99.  Came with a pickle and potato salad.

Went again after seeing Elton John with my family.  I just had a coffee, but they had soup and dessert.  One of the desserts was so stale we had to send it back (strawberry shortcake).  Our server barely spoke English, so that was an ordeal.

Long story short, this place is pretty decent and a good cheap(er) alternative to the fancy restaurants in Caesars Palace.  But don't make a trek over here for a meal... there's better places to eat if you don't happen to be inside the mall.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,1,1,3,KDq0pHo7ysGT53_pa-LNrA
4505623,2007-12-20,1,PWjgwphd2prhtqTPWwLbXw,"Wandering aimlessly around Caesar's Forum Shops, broke and ravenous, one of my girlfriends smelled something wonderfully meaty: 'twas Stage Deli.  We looked at the decent prices and barged in.  At first, we were confused because of the odd dichotomy of what seemed to be an on-the-go deli counter and full-out sit-down restaurant.  Cool beans, it's both.  

All of us decided upon the open-face sandwiches, because they're named after famous people and just sounded awesome. Sides include either mashed potatoes, potato salad, steamed veggies, or french fries.  I ordered the Andre Agassi, a hoagie piled with roast beef and with a side of au jus dipping sauce.  The au jus sauce MADE that dish--not salty at all, but savory and like liquid meat to me.  Which sounds gross but was pretty good.  Even the veggies were good, with this teriyaki-tasting sauce.  My friend ordered the steak sandwich, the name of which evades me, but it was true to its name and a whole freakin steak came out.

Overall, this place was great : casually hearty food for a great price and splendid portions.   If you're craving meaty sandwhiches, go here!",dsQQ5XkuaNxW6Ifmm4AZxw,1,0,4,FXewvUId9schODSXgVux_A

Not having $30 to drop on a sandwich, my friend and i chose to browse the forum shops for something cheaper. We randomly came across Stage Deli and since neith of us knew exactly what we wanted, we stopped to choose from their large menu. I settled on a chili dog which was delicious! I had to ask for a side of onions and a side of cheese to complete the chili dog, but once it was all together, it was good!  The chili dog, itself was huge and so was the bun (what a concept). The chili and the fries were all delicious. My friend got a meatball sub which she seemed to enjoy and thank GOD they never put a bucket of pickles on our table.

I really like their open faced sandwiches - I had the pastrami this time around. The portions are gigantic. The pastrami sandwich was not bad, albeit a bit more dry than what I remember it was previously. Normally, I would say the potato pancake is to die for, but this time, it wasn't very good - it was really hard and rather dry. It tasted a bit stale.

The strawberry milkshake I had was not bad, but it definitely wasn't very good - I was craving a milkshake, which is probably why I liked it more than I should have.

I'll try this place again... just a bit disappointed it wasn't so good this time around. Service was nice, but I'm not sure why they didn't bring the pickles around (we didn't feel like asking).
