My husband and I found this store on accident, the ladies in the store asked us what kind of pinata we were looking for. We showed them a picture of the cat in the hat, and asked if they could make it custom. They said all they needed was one week. We paid on the spot for the custom pinata, three weeks before our sons 1st birthday. A week later they never called to let us know it was ready so we called them to confirm it was ready. They said they needed another week. We called the next week and they didn't have it ready yet. We asked if try were going to have it ready by our party and they said it would be ready in four days, which was three days before the party. We called three days before our party to confirm before we drove across town to pick it up... Then they told us it would be ready the day of the party. Day of party we are going crazy preparing for 75 guests and prepping and my husband shows up, they said oh the lady has it in her car she's on her way to work give us one hour. So he waits and waits and finally the lady shows up without the pinata and she said sorry I forgot it at home. Do you want to buy a different pinata? They should have given us one for the inconvenience...Give me a break they strung us along the entire time and didn't even refund us our entire cost for the pinata. They refunded all of it except $3.75 which was their charge for running debt cards- what a rip off. Not that $3.75 is a big deal but we got ripped off, lied to, strung along, and left empty handed and pod for the hassle!!! I would never recommend them and hope you don't trust them with any event or party, they totally let us down and this was our big focal point of the party for the older kids attending. Everyone was let down and I can never get that back. It was my sons 1st birthday and it was really angering to receive such inconsiderate service and know that they don't care about ruining our event. Yes my son is one, but the pinata was for the older kids. Doing business like this, well they won't be around long. Buyer beware they are frauds!!!",M2xzJtOEbj6_OGGBb2MwHA,2,0,1,yw57uYADWMcHzz4HaSVfJg

You might have better luck getting directions on how to get there by asking the mall employee's, but it's in the same wing as Victoria's Secret.

You are greeted by a bright and colorful storefront, an army of hanging (knockoff) pi単atas in all sorts of characters, racks and bins of Mexican sweets and delights, and junk food to fill any child's (or adult's) desires.

It's a Mexican candy wonderland! We were thrilled to see the variety that they had here (trust me, they got the good stuff.) Assortment of lollipops covered in chili, tamarind candies, ground peanut mazapan, mini caramel in wafer sandwiches, sweet and sour, spicy candy powders, chamoy, alfajor, paletas (Mexican ice cream bars), you name it! 

The candies in each bin range from 25 cents to a dollar, so you can grab as much or as little as you like, mix and match, and try something unique such as the chili covered mango pops or the chamoy paste to dip your green apples in...they are mouthwatering good!

You have to try thier paletas, we are a huge fan of Mexican ice cream and they have the legit ones here! They have mango, pineapple, strawberry, and coconut. My favorite flavors are definitely strawberry or coconut, they seriously taste perfect and are made with real fruit and cream. Amazing on a sweltering day. We'll take 2 please. 

They also have a great chip and snack selection, the American and also the Mexican variety. I also noticed that they had a bunch of other random goods such as Chia seeds, coconut flakes, and raw nuts in packages. We will definitely be back to stock up on our sweet, sour, savory, and spicy goodies!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,2,5,GkR305cACk3TpXpFoAXVhw

Located inside the Boulevard Mall, a Mexican style sweet shop awaits you. Looking for a big time sugar rush? Aisles of dulces await you...bonbons, chocolates, paletas, chicles, chips, cookies, THE WORKS!!!

The ladies behind the counter are very nice and helpful, and offer suggestions to any questions you may have on any of their products sold here. This is a great spot to do your Halloween candy shopping, or if you have a kids' party coming up, you'll want to get a pi単ata for the festivities! There are lots of styles to choose from as well.

Mix and match your candy selections...The prices here are cheap!  ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,15,11,4,RlaTtUQ6PGmEU-yVmqyjag
4799033,2018-06-01,0,RGmBfqdFb0giLPG-SZbQUQ,"If I could, I would give this establishment a negative rating. The older lady was completely unprofessional both times I went. There are no prices on any of her merchandise. In addition, she is charging sales tax but does not provide a receipt. I can guarantee she is not reporting and keeping the sales taxes. She changed the prices from one week to the next. The ""custom"" pi単ata I requested is completely ugly! The colors are wrong, the work is disgusting! A unskilled blind folded person must have cut and pasted this thing together! She took no accountability for the poor work done and even had the nerve to say, she knew the colors were wrong! Didn't offer my money back or even a simple apology. To avoid going completely ape shit on her, I took the shitty pi単ata and left!!",SgkwfvexhrvLnD82ZpyEqQ,0,0,1,euATj7BIJii_-jzvgp9eog
5370509,2016-02-18,1,RGmBfqdFb0giLPG-SZbQUQ,"I'm conflicted about rating this place.  They charge you an extra $.50 to use your card or they tell you to go use a non existent ATM machine to pull money out.  Candy is vastly over priced but the only reason I shopped here anyway is because some of the candy they have is hard to find in the US.  

The woman working here is not nice and not nice about the surcharge.  I know that I could report her to VISA because it is actually against the credit/debit card company to charge customers for the convenience of paying with a card but I'd rather she read on here that I am fully aware of her violation.  Consumer Law 101, so glad I took that class.",xFTwjBMXHJwp8MSTUD-rlQ,2,1,2,OgHZO4s5sUc7cfO-Eane-g
