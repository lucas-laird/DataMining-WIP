I have a friend, who looves food almost as much as I do, that referred me  here. The rib tips are slammin! I have been here numerous times and cant seem to order anything different. The mac n cheese is good, black-eyed peas are bomb and the greens...mmmmwaah! I gave this place 4 stars because the location is not convenient for me. I have to drive clear across town to get my food. Maybe they will consider a place on the southwest side of town.

The clientele was a constant parade of locals. They even gave me a hard time for trying to use utensils. Barbacue is meant to be messy.

In a truffle'd Man n' Cheese, high-stakes, no-limit, Wagyu beef, neon town, it's wonderful to see something that's real and wholesome.  H & H BBQ Pit Stop is a small walk-up/drive thru BBQ joint in the parking lot of a Food-4-Less.  

Near the window where you place your order, there are a few picnic tables to sit at, and some huge smokers coating the surrounding area in mouthwatering smoke and charcoally goodness.   The people here are doing BBQ the way it should be done.  

The menu features all the hits, from Ribs, rib tips, and links, to pulled pork, cat fish, and burgers.  The prices are great (for $10) you get enough food to put you right to sleep when you get back to work.  

On my most recent visit I had the Catfish po'boy and fries combo ($5).  The catfish was golden brown and tasty,  but I wish the po'boy had more on it than just catfish.  It could have used some lettuce, tomato, and some type of mayo-based sauce.  The fries were salty in the best way.  

I love escaping work and getting back to BBQ basics.  Enjoying a nice lunch outside while listening to music is a perfect way to break up the day.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,4,5,4,5NoDiyn0D5GplYEbQ6ewkA

1733764,2011-08-26,3,cw8oFCL0BxCQCwwAr8DOOw,"The food is good.  That isn't being called into question at all.  What I did have a problem with was presentation and service.  First off, this place is clearly marked a ""pit stop,"" so it's good for those on the go.  (There are a couple of tables outside on the porch that I patronized, because I prefer eating my food hot and fresh.)  However, for a pit stop, the food is pretty damn expensive.  I got a three item combo with two sides and a drink for $20.  Comparable to most restaurants, and at least there I would have been sitting inside in an air conditioned environment, instead of outside in 109 degree temperature weather like a jackass.

Okay, so with that out of the way, I get my food.  It's packed into ONE styrofoam to-go plate.  All three meats and my sides smashed in there.  It was a mess.  Barbecue sauce leaked out all over the bag.  I opened up the box and I couldn't tell the brisket from the pulled pork.  It was literally SMOTHERED with BBQ sauce, which is okay by me, but I don't know how most people feel about that.  I would have preferred a couple of syrofoam containers to give it a little more room to breathe, and I also feel like I was cheated out of quantity.

The brisket and pulled pork were good, the sauce was good, but I didn't care too much for the fatty pork ribs (not the baby back fall off the bone variety).  That's okay...two out of three ain't half bad.  But all that sauce was making me thirsty, so I asked for a refill.  She gave it to me, so that was good.  I couldn't finish the plate on one sitting, so I took the rest to go.  Since I had depleted my drink again (I was sitting in 109Â° F sun after all), I asked for another refill.  She said ""one refill only"" and closed the little window.  I ended up driving home half an hour with a parched throat.  That pissed me off, and that doesn't seem like a good way to let your customers leave.  Oh well.",QZDS5x8YE7KWsOBhXmw0Fg,5,0,4,ReEfVO6evT9rGMffEjAtrg

1st bad visit they had no white meat chicken, so I had to wait an hour (I called my order in, ahead...) so when I got there after an hour, they were still out!!!  U would think they would put my order aside, but noooo!!!  I had to wait another HOUR. I WANTED IT SO BADLY I JUST LEFT AND RETURNED.  I finally got my BBQ chicken...and it was undercooked and still bleeding :-{ I think they rushed it since I have been making a fuss and waiting so long!
I called and they said to bring it back and they will replace it...well they had no more white meat so I had to come another day, while refrigerating the u done chicken, so I could bring it back to them. NIGHTMARE! and no compensation for the huge inconvenience. 

2nd bad visit...they were out of brisket. Just out?  No brisket?  A huge part of the everyday menu?  Food for Less is in the same parking lot...can't send anyone to purchase meat?  Anyway, I want what I want and they didn't have it, so busted trip. 

3rd bad visit in a row...came a whole different random day w my brisket craving...out of brisket AGAIN!!!  I'm done!

2898763,2011-09-25,1,cw8oFCL0BxCQCwwAr8DOOw,"I made my first visit to the out door swap meet the past month, and I noticed this huge line of people waiting for their food at this takeout restaurant on North Las Vegas Blvd.    I was curious to see why anyone would be waiting in a 108 degree for BBQ, so I went there after my stop at the swap meet.

I stopped by at 230 pm, and there was still about 5 five people in line to make their order.   It wasn't because they had slow service, but it was because of their food....was very good.    I felt a little out of place at first, because I was only tanned banana colored person in line, but everyone was super cool.      

H & H has two different sizes on the menu, bailout (small) and Starving (big), and has a more than enough selections to make any Southern go  WOW.   I ordered a Smothered Chicken with rice, and two other selections for 6.00,     For my two selection, I doubled up the homemade Mac and Cheese.   

When I got my takeout plate, it was pretty heavy, and went to my car.   The aroma was so good that I couldn't wait for my short trip to Henderson, so I took a bite of every part of my plate.     After sampling each item, I jumped out of my car, and got another plate for dinner and breakfast (yes, it's pretty big)     For 6.00, I got three pieces of chicken that sat on a bed of the rice, and the gravy was one of the best homemade gravy I had for this recipe.    As for the Mac and Cheese, it was so good and has a slight sweet taste to it, and has a little grease on top because of the amount of cheese that was mixed in, and wasn't wiped off after it was baked.   I didn't care because it was added flavor!     I'm a sucker for a good Mac and Cheese!    Don't get me wrong there a bunch of different items, and I made another visit with them a week later, and had their burnt ends...it's wasn't bad at all.   The BBQ sauce wasn't too sweet, but had enough spiciness to make anyone happy.   
If you look at the back of the establishment, you'll see the Big wood burning BBQ going off,  and someone always checking on it.

If you're the adventurous type,  who would love great southern foods at very cheap prices....you might want to check them out.    I'm giving them five stars because of price to quality ratio...it's can't be beat for the price in Las Vegas for this kind of food.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,3,3,5,9RK0GRXSUWNj404J67bpUg

H&H BBQ is ready to fulfil your BBQ desires. Stroll up to their window to make your order and sit at their picnic table out front if you want to embrace the Nortown atmosphere. You gotta love it!!! I've tried these guys twice now. I'll have to give them the benefit of the doubt on this one.

This time around I got the 3 meat combo with two sides for $16.99. Hot links, BBQ chicken, beef brisket, mac n cheese, and potato salad with a rock solid cornbread. I like these folks. They give you really nice portions. I had a nice amount of leftovers afterwards and I was full. That's always a good sign when testing new BBQ establishments.

Let's start off with their BBQ sauce. Sweet but not spicy. I like eating BBQ with a little spice, although the sauce did taste delicious during my feeding. To fix that, their hot links was there to save the day. I would just eat a piece of their delicious spicy hot links after every other bite to neutralize the situation. Next is their brisket. It tasted good and tender. There wasn't anything wrong there. No brisket was left on my plate. Now to the subject in question. The BBQ chicken seemed like it was left in the smoker a little too long. Kind of dry so I had to sauce it up a scoach. I had a lot of leftover sides and I only took one bite out of the rock solid cornbread. CRIPES!!! I should have gotten the side of delicious sweet yams that they serve instead. The winners this time around were the hot links and the beef brisket. GREAT SUCCESS!!!

In the end I had to ask myself if I would go here again... Yes I would. It's not too far off from the work place and they give you big portions. Not stingy at all when serving the good people of Las Vegas. EYE LIKA!!!!!!",mIEuWv7fqPzCqzPe3JkC6Q,2,2,4,QYimChZkxrZVhW9-VxGkYg

3839447,2014-09-19,0,cw8oFCL0BxCQCwwAr8DOOw,"I used to L-O-V-E this place. The food was great and the service was friendly. I recommended it to all of my friends who wanted some good bbq. 

I have given this place, not one, not two, not three, but SIX chances. Each time I left swearing to never go there again...then I would crave their food (I ate it pretty much once a week for years since I live down the street) and I'd give them another try. ..and regret it. I think this place used to be a family-run business but they have since hired people who either don't know or don't care what they are doing. 

First of all, the food is very hit-or-miss. Much more miss these days. The cornbread which used to be fluffy and moist now tastes and feels like cardboard. The sweet potatoes are never cooked all the way through. The brisket (which they have been out of the past 6 times I have been there- all at different times of the day - no joke) used to be delicious/smoky/have great texture but is now not only never available, but also cut thin and overall tastes/feels like something you would buy at a grocery store deli. They used to serve kool-aid, which i thought was kind of neat (tastes like childhood) but they have also mysteriously been out of kool-aid the past 6 times I have gone there. Really? Big kool-aid shortage in North America? 

I have stopped by there twice during their posted business hours on the window and no one was there. 

The last time I went there I arrived 30 minutes before they were about to close. I knew they wouldn't have brisket but I figured I could grab some chicken or pork. The lady, all huffy, opens the window and says ""We're about to close"". I say ""Ok, well the sign says you are open for another 30 minutes."" She says ""Well I can give you food but it is going to be cold, we already turned everything off."" 

What the what? 

I left and I will never be back. You couldn't pay me to go back to this place, and I literally drive by it every day.",tK3NRpwMB87McFG5ioQRyg,1,0,1,_i663XFy2mAEqBknDAcypA

While the orders got churned in, I was able to see a team inside doing their specialty, like clockwork.  I caught myself licking my lips in a daze as I watched them handle their food.

I came up to the order window hungry. Conveniently, their large size for meat orders is called ""starvin,"" which fit my particular needs at the time. I was here to make an order for the family, so I made sure to order plenty:

Beef Brisket - Not as tender as I'd like, but still good. Comes smothered generously in their tangy BBQ sauce.
Rib Tips - These were also decent. They didn't blow my mind, but they hit the spot for what I was craving for.
Fried Catfish - I'd have to say these were the highlight of my meal. Crispy, meaty, and well-seasoned. At $6/lb, I'd go here just for an order of these.
Fried Okra - The fried okra was also a hit with myself and the family.
Mac N Cheese - Better than average, but not the best I've ever had. Still a worthy side to order.

 Altogether the meal came up to around $38. For the price, I was very satisfied with my feast, seeing that it generously fed 6 people to the point of bursting. I could definitely see myself coming back when I'm in the area for some local BBQ lovin'.


Note - They also offer plenty of lunch specials around the $5 spot, which is a very good value on some solid BBQ.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,1,1,4,cAjIYk_M7NPrYDgpwor96Q

The drive through has no menu, only until you get up to the window do you see a menu sort of written on the window.  We ordered mac & cheese, corn bread, and a pulled pork sandwich and 2 sides of fries.  They told us to pull to the side and they would bring it out.  We waited about 20 minutes, which sucked because I was starving, but they were very polite.

They failed to give me my corn bread :-( Even though the guy repeated our order as he handed it to us.  But oh well.  The mac & cheese was amazing.  I was very pleased with it.  My boyfriend also enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, and I had a bite and thought it was pretty good too.

I've been here numerous times in the past 5 years or so and followed them from their location that was inside a gas station to their new location and each time, though the food delicious, horrible attitudes and just shitty customer service pretty much each time at this new location and today just topped it off. Only reason I'm here is because I was excited they had a groupon as their meals can get quite pricey when you're ordering for 2 or more, and I'm pretty sure this will be my last trip until they get their shit straight. I'm a server on the strip so I know how the game works, and good food isn't going to be enough to keep this place afloat. Maybe, since I'm mixed half black, if I was a dark skin tone than my white looking skin, they'd treat me better as my black mother has never had a problem with their attitudes as I've constantly complained about. Oh well, get better, happier and more friendly employees and I'll come back and spend my money here.",pfDrj6qVCvod_VZScRx4Jw,5,1,1,yW6zJ3Y08jzQdYpJ02gd5g

They used to be one of the best BBQ places here in Vegas when they where located on MLK, but I think they changed owners and the food has taken a nose dive. I wouldn't recommend them now. My wife and I tried a bit of everything, the spicy sausages where passable but the meat was dry poor cuts and the sauce was way too sour. The cornbread was good but I for one don't go to a Bar-B-Q place for the cornbread, unless it's smothered in Bar-b-Q meats... :-)",YNGcDwRP5GZZd9kk7nk05g,0,0,2,GOx0tfJuKfqvzwsWbhkeuQ
