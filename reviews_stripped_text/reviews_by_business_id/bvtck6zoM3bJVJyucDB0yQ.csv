1230055,2013-01-25,0,bvtck6zoM3bJVJyucDB0yQ,"I came here on my last morning before leaving to go back to California because it was convenient to have breakfast here. 

Anyways, this place is now actually called ""Alexis Garden"" instead of the ""Alexis Cafe"" and it is located right in front of the hotel lobby. When we first came in, we were acknowledged by 2 severs and were seated by a window that overlooks 1 of the 3 main pools on site. Looking over the prices for breakfast on the menu seemed pretty standard of other restaurants for breakfast, so it was fair pricing. But I am sure there are other places on the strip that would have cheaper prices.

Well anyway, I ordered the eggs & hash brown breakfast that comes with 2 pieces of toast (white or white) for $8.75 and a short stack of pancakes (comes in 3's) for $7.75 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alexis-cafe-las-vegas?select=APwj3X6NCyZI5LfUm3SVPg#8DBcSB4pOA4MNUWPTy5K8w) (yep I was hungry.... but I honestly didn't eat it all and saved the rest for the trip and my dogs). Everything tasted just fine, like what you would expect of your typical breakfast. But I did not like that the eggs were made with butter. I would have preferred it made without. I also liked that I was able to get whole wheat toast in stead of just ""wheat bread"" (if you don't see the word ""whole wheat"" on the ingredients label in the first 3 ingredients on the bread you buy, then you are most likely not eating whole wheat bread). The breakfast was pretty filling.

My husband ordered the steak & eggs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alexis-cafe-las-vegas?select=_0SNchLimPkGo38ywWv5hw#_0SNchLimPkGo38ywWv5hw) for $13 and it came with 2 pieces of toast and a side of hash browns as well. I didn't try any of his steak but he did say it was good but a little on the fatty side (which he cut off the fatty pieces of fat off). His breakfast was also very filling as well.

Overall, the food was good but a bit greasy. It is also very filling even if you only eat half of whatever you order. There are also some healthier options available to order, including a bowl of oatmeal (I believe for $4.50), half a grapefruit (for $3.75 I believe) and a bowl of cereal and milk (also for $4.50 I believe). 

There is also plenty of parking out in case you decide to dine here if you are not already staying here. There are also plenty of tables here (when we had breakfast, there was only 2 other tables occupied). Everything is nice and clean.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,0,1,4,UBHyPj7nCOBnhns7QdOogw
1700780,2013-02-11,2,bvtck6zoM3bJVJyucDB0yQ,"Was at an event held here where event comped our lunch at this place. The restaurant is located off main lobby area of hotel. Easy access also from doors that lead to back parking lot.   Pretty good size, clean, open and airy, natural lighting through their glass windows that surround the place. It has a view of their pools and courtyard.  When we had lunch the place was pretty quiet there was only one other party besides our table of 3. 

We preordered from their menu so our food would be ready when we had our lunch break. For lunch and dinner the menu they had a nice selection of salads, sandwiches, wraps, pasta and steak dishes.  Prices were pretty reasonable averaging under $10.  I pre ordered a Thai Chicken wrap.
Thai chicken wrapped in spinach tortilla pretty good size and filled with both chicken and rice..had mildly spiced. Came also with peanut dipping sauce and side of sweet potato fries.  I liked the chicken but there was too much rice for me.  It tasted alright.  For me it was just a little to heavy on starches not enough veggies.  Very filling though. I barely finished half and was full already.  Sweet potato fries were cooked just right and crisp. Definitely will keep in mind to order this as a side dish and that will be just enough for me.
 
Service was okay. Came in and was seated right away. Server took our drink orders and we got those first . We got our meals on time  shortly after, but note we did order ahead. Our server wasn't your average friendly type, for our party at least, but she was professional and did her job.  Other staff on floor though was really nice. Kept our drinks filled and cleared out empty plates promptly. This place is a 3.5ish.. good enough fall back if you want to dine in at your hotel and avoid the crowds, but if you live in the area it's not likely I would go out of the way to dine at.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,4,2,3,BNKJLkEUGN6ozbIugZH1YA

Coffee was acceptable. Nothing to rave about. Nothing to complain about. Meh..... Hence 3-stars.,nmmuGNhOTPfISyQ4_IdmcQ,0,0,3,wwbozKAF6LgBNuRmv_YIgQ

The service was okay.  The views of the main pool with the flowing water fountain was neat.",1eOJSCb2aDQakloIzVqiYg,0,0,3,XWBkwxJou02winrsKvwjHQ

We had a Restaurant.com certificate for what is now called Alexis Gardens and used it tonight before a show.  Our server, Brenda, was excellent!   My wife is a fussy eater.  She wanted a chicken dish and the Chicken Oscar seemed what she wanted except the ""Oscar"" part.  Brenda made sure that the ""Oscar"" part, the lump crabmeat and the bernaise sauce were put in separate cups so I could have them and my wife had a plain chicken breast with extra grilled asparagus.  I ordered the ribeye steak which came with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.

The steak was cooked black and blue as I requested and my side of crabmeat was delicious.  The bernaise sauce was a bit salty so I only used a small amount.  For dessert, I hade a piece of carrot cake which was standard, but good.

I would give this restaurant four full stars except for the lack of menu selection.  The menu is quite limited.  Therefore, I deducted the 1/2 star from 4.  

Again, service was outstanding and the food was very good!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,0,0,3,Mn-QubVksR_7uXaENCcWrA

4442671,2015-01-10,0,bvtck6zoM3bJVJyucDB0yQ,"First, this review is for breakfast only and let me make it clear that I tend to avoid buffets - this one did nothing to sway that normal aversion. 
Positives: fresh fruit, orange juice, and bacon cooked to a variety of doneness.  Fresh, make your own waffles if you are into carbs. 
Negatives: the scrambled eggs look better than they taste, the biscuits were crumbly, and the coffee was bitter. I can't speak to the flavor or taste of the greasy looking potatoes, sausage links, or sausage gravy, as I'm not interested in feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast.
Healthy: only if you stick to the fruit and cereal.",W8UV5KnXhvxYhbkxuXVSXQ,2,0,2,mSymsAFpxvaZF00aVfeJwA
4522302,2009-02-19,0,bvtck6zoM3bJVJyucDB0yQ,"Located inside the Alexis Park Resort, a non-gaming hotel, this restaurant left much to be desired. We went on a weekend and there was only one other group at this restaurant - always a bad sign. As soon as we tasted the food we knew why. The highlight was the wait staff, very sweet and accommodating, but as noted earlier there was only one other family there. Very simple and pleasant decor, but this is a restaurant that I am embarrassed to say I ate at.",Zo2qav3-2dUMTxlitYFWLQ,0,0,1,MV5Vy17NCFS_LTOjODVnzA

5990454,2012-03-18,0,bvtck6zoM3bJVJyucDB0yQ,"We went the other night to the Gardens Restaurant with a KSHP coupon. The Service was excellent the calamari one of the best I have ever had. For dinner my wife hade the Chicken alfrado. She said it was just standard grill chicken on pasta with standard alfrado sauce. Big portion though. I had the night's special which was short ribs on wild mushroom risotto. It was around 530 pm and think it would have been better around 7 as the meat was not quite fork tender and the risotto was still crunchy. The salad was good and it came with a glass of house wine. Not to bad for $20. 
If you come here be aware that the menu is very small. And nothing comes with a salad unless it is the special. I will go back again and would recommend it also. Not bad with a $30 off coupon.",kr5gKgvNxE7ETKAQmZPKJg,0,0,4,RZTFh8wp54AOU8V_qWwm_A
