We ordered The Bobbie, which is basically a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich: turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. It was good and wish I had more cranberry sauce in my portion. The sandwich would get 3.5 stars.

My reason to round down: I came with a group of 7 and half of them had to go to the restroom. We claim two tables to sit and I was at a table that sits two, thinking no one else would sit at the other chair because I'm here. Not true. You would think if someone is sitting at a table, you'll find a different spot or at least ask if he/she can sit there. Well not in this case. This guy just sat down and his friend was standing between us. I didn't really care to begin with because I'm thinking they're just waiting for their to-go orders. Nope. They got their orders first and started eating at the table I claimed. The guy standing placed his sandwich in front of me (although, I had my back to them) like it's his spot. WTH... So when it was our turn to eat, we had to hold it in our hands while those two jerks got the table.",ZbOsl2oBg4twoOg0ek68rA,3,0,3,m_076zfppWrKNwGx1VGAJw

Dude.. Why is everyone keeping this place a secret from me? They know I jones for a good sammich. They know I need my sammich fix. And they know how I get down after Thanksgiving Day, cause leftover turkey is the business. So today I didn't feel like eating pre-sliced and pre-stacked lunch meats served to me, and others, like we are in an Elementary School Cafeteria. So I went here with the expectations of it being similar to a Jersey Mike's or something. As soon as I read the menu, I was like ""Wait!!!... REAL Turkey??""...I didn't go with the Bobbie.. I went here on lunch, and dozing in a 2pm meeting is just not cool... So regular one for me with ALL the fixins. First bite and I'm trying to get to the kitchen so I can Hi-Five the little lady breaking down 15lb BUTTERBALLS all-day. She deserves a gold medal and a sticker... Needless to say, I was very satisfied.. So lose the process meats and come here instead.. Cucumbers don't belong on a sammich anyway..

346060,2012-06-06,2,1bALsE6aZE23mGV2WPxN_g,"What took me so long to finally try Capriotti's?  I'm not sure why it took so long for our paths to cross, but as fate would have it, we had an office Thanksgiving party and I was fortunate enough to meet the Veggie Turkey.

For Capriotti's in general:

I am highly addicted to Capriotti's at the moment.  Which is odd because I'm not usually a sandwich type of girl nor do I particularly care for fake meat.  Something about this particular sandwich, however, has me got hooked.

The bread has a nice little crust on the outside while still being soft and chewy.  The toppings are always fresh.  There is a perfect balance of ingredients- not too much lettuce (like most places will do) and not too skimpy on the ""meat"" and cheese.  The sweet peppers?  They have opened me up to a whole new sandwich experience.  I l-o-v-e me some sweet peppers.

The employees are super friendly and I can't recall any problems with any of my orders.  Plus you can sometimes get $3 off your next order if you get a survey on your receipt!

I've also had theVveggie Cheesesteak and it really wasn't for me- too much fake meat.  It tasted fine I just couldn't handle that much fake chicken.  I think it would be a really good sandwich for someone who is a newbie vegetarian.

My only gripe with Capriotti's is that they don't offer free water.  I think it should be required that every restaurant has free water for their customers, but unfortunately that's not the case.  I really, really hate paying for an overpriced bottle of water.

For this particular location:

The employees are great and they are pretty fast with my order.  The store can get pretty messy though and there aren't a lot of places to sit down and eat your sandwich.  It's probably best to just pick it up from here and eat elsewhere.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,4,3,4,L4A9oqiJjf3XwTohxPdN4A

I was scratching my head too when I saw this on the menu. Didn't even know this was on there. But I'm thrilled that I got it because I've had veggie burgers at other places and none of it were as good as this one. What I loved so much about it was that it didnt fall apart so easily and it wasn't bland at all. I had Justin add some grilled onions, mushroom, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and mayo and ketchup--all that in between the kaiser buns and it was veggie cheese burger heaven..yum. It was also pretty big for a small order so I saved the other half for later. Also a bonus: the price! It only cost 4.50! Plus the service was, as usual, awesome! One thing though that stil needs improvent was the cleanliness of the tables. It just needed to be wiped down more. There were crumbs and grease left over from previous patrons.

 This is a franchise with about twenty Vegas locations. I ate at the one listed.


 We were driving into Red-Rock Canyon for a half day of exploring and trying out the 44 that we had rented and so we decided to get a packed lunch and picnic in the Canyon.


 I had read a good review of Capriotti's and so we went here rather than Subway or another boring sandwich chain.


 When you look at their menu online your mouth will water, and the reality was every bit as good. Our Sandwiches were stuffed with meat or whatever other filling we ordered and then they stuffed them even further with our salad choices, condiments and trimmings.

Went in at the perfect time...there was only one other customer ahead of me and he'd already placed his order. About 2 minutes after I'd placed my order, people just started pouring in to the place!! You can also call your order in for pick-up AAAAAND they deliver!! Right then I knew I'd made the right decision to grub here. 

Got my sammy...headed home and devoured as much as I could. In all honesty, I was expecting a lot more pastrami flavor.  Thinly sliced pastrami piled on a lengthy white hoagy with creamy, crunchy Cole slaw & Russian dressing...

It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection.

Shared the  12' Capastrami and seeing as I was extremely reluctant to order a sandwich with a large amount of cole slaw I can say that I was thoroughly converted by the Cap. The meat was plentiful and the combination of the pastrami and cole slaw was superb.

As I suggested they really load the sandwich and give you a bang for your buck.

Biggest drawback is it's no where near the strip out in no man's land. My friends and I dropped by upon leaving a none of your business weekend in Vegas.",g8TkB9kLwc5JUdLcAU1Tfw,0,0,4,fOZA2Npo6y3fh8y4WBc3cA

I know a lot of people rant and rave about pops cheese steaks,  but what make capriotti's the best is that is cooked to order. At pops they cooked it a head of time and sits  in a bucket to keep it warm so it looses the freshness and drys out when the cook it a second time for your sandwich.  They are both great sandwiches but capriotti's is the most consistent with flavor every time and will win my business 90% of the time.",lkbtFdwhAV5zhSKZ5we2-w,1,1,5,Om_0o2RmsdtclCiA9_6cfg

The slaw, and I'm not usually a fan of slaw, was light and sweet and crispy.  And the Russian dressing was not overbearing but made the whole thing creamy and juicy.  But the best part of the sandwich is the bread.  I really liked the spongy soft roll - it's not like a typical flaky roll that breaks apart when you bite in.

Bread options are slim to none, maybe that's because I don't specifically ask for it but you usually get the white bread.

Inside of the sandwich is just filled with tasty meats but are a bit salty, but you can't really notice it. It gets you right underneath the tongue. The meats are of higher than average quality and you can really taste the vegetables. 

Texture is soft and easy to consume

Experience of it is worth the try but can get busy at this particular place, so call ahead if your hungered. Take it easy capriotti's won't be going anywhere with it's great tasting sandwiches.

The desserts they offer is mediocre, I can get a similar cake at a liquor store.

There are different sizes and that will determine your price: you can order a small (9'' about $5-7 bucks I believe, medium (12'' about $6-9) , or large (20'' i believe about $12 or so)

I was hungry but I wasnt HUNGRY so I decided on the medium size...

Sandwich: The capastrami was AWESOME! The creamy coleslaw paired with the slight natural saltiness of the pastrami was AMAZING. The russian dressing was just an added plus.

Got a side of chips and an bottled ice tea. The chips were just ordinary bag of chips went well with the sandwich.
