The atmosphere is very nice, clean, beautiful decor, comfy seats and good vibe. 

Food was really great. Had the onion soup with Gruyere cheese. The chicken Chop Salad, classic but larger than most and quite hearty. The rib sandwich is actually one of the best you'll ever have. Seriously WOW. Really tasty. My server talked me into a steak one of the times and I really enjoyed it. Who knew you could get a great steak dinner and beer (or wine if you so choose) in an airport? 

They have a decent selection of draft beers... Bud, Budlight, Sierra Nevada, Sin City IPA, Sam Adams, Stella Artois and Blue Moon. Not bad for an airport. 

Service was great over all. Had to wait to get a seat but the place was very busy and seemed short staffed. 

Ruth was my server.. she was outstanding. Couldn't believe she could handle so many people at the same time and be personable and kind to each one. Then I find out she works the place with her sister Sarah who also stopped by to say ""hi"", she was running the other half of the restaurant. Being all from Denver originally, we had a lot to talk about. They both seemed to me as top of the line servers who knew their stuff and cared about each guest. I was very impressed. Seriously, if you go, ask for Sarah or Ruth and they will make sure you have a good experience. A++ to them. 

I met two managers, Lisa, and Ana during my visits. Both were excellent and I could tell they were doing a great job running this joint. I saw them busing and behind the bar and all over.",D7fqBHhpSTX4tpCcvqQkAQ,0,0,5,zGulug7DdoiKe6fGaPnAlw

Nope they weren't.

854944,2014-11-20,0,azxeH9W14hzFnZyuOm8JdQ,"Vegas, and have always had relatively good experiences until this recent visit.

Our server was just plain rude. Her name was either Adele or Adeline, unfortunately my memory is failing me at the moment. Right off the bat, she brought us water which was nice, but never offered anything else to drink. The first time she asked to take our order. I said to my husband, ""Are you ready?"" and before I could finish my sentence, she cut me off by saying:  ""I have other tables so I've gotta keep moving."" Ok then. I noticed she didn't mind spending time at other people's tables conversing with them. I got the vibe she thought we were younger than we are (early 30's) and probably not worth her time since we may not tip well, which is a ridiculous assumption since age doesn't equate to poor tipping etiquette.

She did come back to take our orders a few minutes after that. I had the chicken chopped salad (awesome) and my husband had the BBQ bacon burger (he found it quite dry, likely because she never bothered to ask how he'd like his burger done. Since we are Canadian and don't typically get the option given to us, he didn't think much of it until we read ""well done"" on the bill.). 

She never once came around to ask us how the meal was, which was kind of appalling. The restaurant wasn't overly busy, and she walked right by at least a handful of times. She never once offered us refills on our water or inquired to see if we needed anything else. I am not a picky person and generally as long as a server is nice and makes an attempt to be attentive, I'm happy. I always tip generously for good service.

In this case, our dining experience was totally ruined by her horrible service! Awful",V2c-JlG4m1jSz0D6KUquWg,0,0,2,54el5sRAvcaQdNVV02UitA

CHOP CHOP SALAD
Not bad. If you're curious it has: dried blueberries, avocado, sliced tomato, blocks of cheese, garbanzo beans, and a super sour vinaigrette. 

CRISPY BUFFALO SHRIMP
Sounds pretty good right? But let me tell you, idk what it was, either the buffalo sauce or the mayo/bleu cheese sauce, but it was SALTY AF. Saltier than the sand at the beach. Order if you will, but it was salty, I had to rely on my chop chop salad to balance the taste. I don't like wasting food, so I just ate it.

Decided to stop by and eat dinner before heading home after a long flight. The name chophouse sort of gave me an idea that they would specialize in steaks.  Not so much, I missed the steak section at first but finally found and chose one of the three options a 30 something dollar NY strip steak. 

The side salad was embarrasing, just lettuce with dollops of caesar sauce. The steak itself was clearly defrosted in a microwave, tough and difficult to cut especially with the butter knife. Apparently they do not have steak knives. The quality of meat was like chuck, the kind they use to make ground beef or stew. There was no seasoning or flavor to the meat.

We checked out most all the non-fast food, not just a bar, sit-down eateries at Terminal 3 and chose Chop House despite the pricey menu. The hostess was friendly and not pushy when we first passed by and very accommodating when we came by the second time to be seated. We chose the outside concourse seating so we could people watch. Within minutes of sitting down, we were greeted by our server,, Pedro, who was extremely energetic in both speech and manner, but not in a ""git 'er done"" way. He was attentive and helpful and friendly. My ""side"" chop-chop salad was fabulous and huge, featuring the freshest ingredients and a delicious bleu cheese dressing on the side. My husband's NY strip steak was perfectly done medium. The uncut green beans were wonderful as was his baked potato (yep, I tried them both). But the prices - well, astronomical, in my book. A 6 oz glass of Hess Shirttail Ranches Cab was $15 - ok, yummy and all that, but $15? You can buy a whole bottle for $17.50!
The charge was $35 for the NY strip steak and you can add another $3 for putting sour cream and chives on the potato. Bottle of Angry Orchard ""beer"" - $7.79, which is pretty much the price of a 6 pack of the stuff at Total Wine.
So I reluctantly tipped Pedro 20%, but the inflated prices (not his fault) really stuck in my proverbial craw.

Bless you LVCB! After reading my previous review, they've installed TVs on the inside of the bar, so you can see them when you're sitting on a bar stool. OK, fine, it might not have been because of my review, but it's a welcome addition nonetheless.

While the 'brewery' name is still puzzling, you can't hate on their rotating taps, including local Sin City brews. To change things up from my usual order, I scooped up a turkey club and an order of buffalo shrimp. The club sandwich is built well, meaning it's not one bite bacon, one bite turkey, 17 parts bread. There's a nice arrangement of the BLTT staples along with a pesto mayo that should quell your fears about eating a dry turkey sammie. Great sandwich! The buffalo shrimp was also solid. It wasn't a basket of nasty little fried shrimp in a greasy sauce, it was 6 large fried shrimp with buffalo sauce drizzled over it. The two sound similar, but the execution here is key and if your stomach has some sort of vote as to what you put it it, it would def rock this arrangement on it's ticket (did I really just write that?).

We saw three waiters walking up and down the area, but no-one bothered to clean anything. They were walking empty handed back and forth but did not care whatsoever. 

We waited about ten minutes watching the staff doing exactly nothing. At one point we decided to just sit down and thought we could coerce the staff to make a move. 

What happened was that we were told that according to the health department of Nevada, we couldn't sit at a dirty table. I asked why they don't just clean it, since we have been waiting for a while watching all four tables maintaining their dirty state. Maybe that's the staff's internal policy? Keep them dirty to have fewer customers, and thus, less work? 

Answer was no, we'd have to wait. At that point we left. Seeing the other reviews, I am not surprised. This place probably only survives due to it's off-market position, being one of two restaurants at the airport.

Terribly unaccommodating, borderline rude, and most of all lazy as ÷%¥* staff.

After 10 minutes, our waiter David came around to ask for our drink orders. We also gave him our food orders as well to save time. 

Fast forward 15 minutes and I finish my cup of coffee and looked around for our waiter. He was nowhere to be seen. Another 10 minutes go by before he reappears and I can ask for a coffee refill. We have been seated now for approximately 35 minutes now...still no food. 

I finish my 2nd cup of coffee and watch as the restaurant starts getting pretty cleared out. Plenty of tables and seats at the bar...and still no food. The couple at a table behind us start to get loud and angry about now having to wait over 40 minutes for food. The waiter gives them some excuse about someone having ""lost the tickets"". The manager comes over and comps their drinks, and gives them a totally different excuse saying that they had been backed up. Personally, I think our waiter just ""forgot"" to turn in a few tickets, ours included. 

That couple finally gets served while we continue to wait. David the waiter doesn't bother to check and see if we need anything or even to apologize for the wait. In fact, he doesn't acknowledge us at all. 

After exactly 64 minutes of being seated,  our steak and egg breakfast finally arrived. I think it was ok but we had to gobble it down so quick so we wouldn't miss boarding our flight. That is too bad that a $50 breakfast couldn't be enjoyed. 

Service gets 0 stars. I get that mistakes happen, I'd be more forgiving with this review if they would have been forthcoming about it. What made this worse is that we remained patient and didn't even get acknowledged, while a couple making a ruckus about it were catered to immediately.",iXbogQqFzMGb5G5GUFcjLA,6,2,1,XifaHH3vJCEjw9DPnFEnqQ

I chose the spinach. Angela returned with a tasty and generous portion of spinach. However, the burger, though fresh tasting, was dry and cooked well beyond medium as I had requested. I've been having this problem a lot lately. I would say, however, that Angela's good natured cheerfulness, and the very interesting conclusion to the Cardinals/ Packers playoff game, brightened my mood in anticipation of my 9:58 p.m. flight back to JFK.., leading me to conclude that.........

t3 is terrible period. For food and looks.  The speed in which your bags come out and the congestion at the TSA scanners is the only thing it helped out.

If you want to sit down and eat a meal in a restaurant, this is your only option.  It would get 1 star if you had other options.

The whole other terminal is a debacle in my opinion, if you compare it to what JFK did to JetBlue like 5 years ago, this terminal is a JOKE.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,3,2,3,-tzU4bI4XOaDd7KPUqhVhw

5479839,2014-01-20,0,azxeH9W14hzFnZyuOm8JdQ,"We had a long wait at the Vegas airport when we were getting ready to leave. This is mostly due to the 11:00 check out time of hotels, and that we had a 1:45 flight. After having an amusing conversation with our cab driver (who after he found out he had a gay couple in his taxi regaled us with stories of growing up in San Francisco and how he had a fun night with a young Hispanic man who picked him up the previous Friday) and getting through security, we needed a place to have lunch. Since we had a lot of time, we opted to dine in at the Las Vegas Chophouse and Brewery.

We started with Bloody Marys (because we're still technically in Vegas, right?) and I ordered the reuben and the other half had a burger. The Bloody Mary was tasty and spicy and had quite a bit of garnish which is always pleasant. The food was pretty standard for a place like this, my reuben was a bit soggy underneath and the other half's burger was massive (with a weirdly tiny bun). The fries were alright.

So yeah, alright all around. Nothing special, but it beats most of the crappy airport food you're likely to get somewhere. Plus if you have time, nothing beats sitting around and drinking cocktails before getting on your plane. You may be leaving Las Vegas, but it doesn't mean you still can't party like you're there.",t8aJIHxkutRlWMRNSvpq6w,1,0,3,SNhvYm2OpLy0DikQrPyCzA

On a recent holiday to Vegas, my partner and I had dinner here before our return flight home.  I had checked online what the options were for a sit-down restaurant in the Las Vegas airport and noted this was close by to our departure gate.

We arrived with plenty of time to allow us to have a relaxed meal prior to departure.  We each ordered a pre-meal drink and reviewed the menu. It was varied enough that there should be something on there to satisfy most appetites.  Both my partner and I went for a steak.  I had an 8 ounce filet while my partner opted for the New York strip.  Both came with a salad and your choice of potato or rice. 

When our steaks arrived, I noted that we didn't have steak knives.  My partner quickly pointed out we were in an airport past security and they probably weren't allowed to give them.  But it wasn't an issue,  My filet was incredibly tender, perhaps the best steak I have had in the past year or so.  No steak knife needed. 

Service was very efficient, friendly and attentive and we were done with plenty of time to spare.   It wasn't a cheap meal, but airport restaurants are never cheap.  But the quality was well worth the outlay in cash.  So if you're heading back to Alberta on WJ, arrive a bit early and enjoy a nice meal before the flight home.",65PDE20lK04zDVTiLjJOgA,0,0,4,g3QAFiIDJ6idCFJETHw7xg

The coffee was burnt and horrible .Instead of cream I was given a vanilla flavored creamer. I do not like vanilla flavor in my morning coffee. Fine if you do, but I want my coffee the way I want it - with cream. At $3.39 a cup it is not too much to ask. They had obviously run out of cutlery as we were given plastic knives.
