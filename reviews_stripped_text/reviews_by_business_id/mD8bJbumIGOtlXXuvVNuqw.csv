The atmosphere is very cozy, clean and perfect for conversation and catching up. The service was excellent. Very personable servers and the owner even stopped by our table. 

The food was absolutely delicious. We all had the catfish and loved it. In addition we all loved the sides: greens, yams, mac n cheese and potato salad. The cornbread was perfect too.

To finish it off my daughter and I had the lemon cake and it was to die for.  If you are looking for authentic homemade soul food in Vegas, this is the place to go.

There were so many different cakes that are displayed near the the dining area and we tried several.

The food was cooked on spot and I was delighted to know that ALL the sides aren't cooked with meat so they're 100% safe for people who don't eat meat! The catfish wasn't laced with bones and it was so flavorful and crunchy. My 19 month old daughter loved the food so much she was dancing while eating. My party tried the catfish, tilapia, and smothered chicken. Each plate came with two sides so we choose macaroni, mashed potatoes, French fries, yams, greens, potato salad, and cabbage. The greens were good but not great, the macaroni was to die for, the mashed potatoes were amazing, the French fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly, the potato salad was sweet and salty, and the cabbage was so great. The customer service was amazing! Our waitress never missed a refill or seemed upset when we requested something. The chef even came out towards the end to ask us how we thought the food was! I'll definitely be returning. This was a great experience. This place s ya an amazing example of how all establishments should be.

Two friends and I dropped by and we each got to pick a small slice to sample - the German Chocolate cake was my favorite! They're small slices but there's enough that each person can get a couple bites to see which they like the most.

Our server was super sweet and had the biggest, most beautiful smile! She was very observant, getting us refills, asking us if everything was okay, etc. She was a joy to talk to every time she came to our table. The chef himself even popped over to see how we were doing! The three of us could not compliment his cooking enough, everything we got was soooooo drool worthy! I am a total Mac and cheese snob and theirs is one of the best bowls I've ever had! It was the perfect amount of creamy and cheesy~

We ended up staying longer than intended because - as my friend pointed out - it feels very much like a home. They're decorations were great and they had a tv showing pictures from when the place was being built, photos of the workers, the cakes, it was great watching all of them cycle through. When we left, everyone told us to come by again and I cannot stress this enough - you should DEFINITELY try this place out! I'm super excited to go back!

The cabbage and mac n cheese were a little bland for my taste, but I added a little onion salt and pepper and really enjoyed it.  The cornbread was also pretty tasty.  When I picked my food up, the girl said ""I thought you might have forgot about your food.""  I was there 5 minutes after she stated it would be ready because I got caught up at work.  In the future, they should take the customer's phone number, so they can call and verify they are still coming if they are taking longer than expected.  Other than that, she was pleasant.  A gentleman, that I believe is the chef, came out and said ""Thank you,"" and ""Have a good night.""  Good food and service is not the norm anymore, so I was happy to find this place!  I plan on trying the smothered pork chop and different sides next time.  And based on the reviews, I need to try some cake!
The reason why I am giving them a 3 star rating is because I just called in to place an order at 8:55pm on Saturday night and I was told they were closed.  Not only does yelp have them open until 10pm on Saturday, but their website also says that.  I advised the girl who answered of that and all she said was, ""Really?  I'm sorry.""  Even if they decided to close at 9pm, I would have still taken the order because of the misinformation.

I am from NC but my husband is from ID.  He has no idea, in my opinion, what he missed growing up learning to eat in the South.  I ordered the Dirty Fries, Macaroni and Cheese and the Original Gooey Butter Cake and the Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake.  I could not wait to taste these items and share them.  My husband and I thought everything was wonderful and together, he and I will be back.  We will be telling others as well about this wonderful restaurant.  And on top of all of this, I am on crutches from a brake in my foot.  The lovely waitress carried my purchase out to my truck and I was parked in the farthest spot from the restaurant.  Thank you so much for the wonderful dinner.  My husband and I talked about NC the entire time.",D9M0tJXzG1j-t6DigYg4Tg,2,2,5,KChjtRfmFwnV1CwWLT-XFg

The owner and staff were both very nice and greeted us with warmth. We both ordered the catfish lunch,I had Mac n cheese and yams as a side dish and cornbread with a glass of kool-aid and still ended up taking leftovers back to work. Of course we got bananas pudding cake to go . I will definitely be a regular to try out all the other items on the menu. Thanks so much for setting the example of how more businesses should be.

5680392,2018-06-17,0,mD8bJbumIGOtlXXuvVNuqw,"Stopped by to Call Me Cake last night with two out of town friends. As we walked in, the chef welcomed us with a friendly ""Welcome to my house!"" and I was instantly sold on our decision for soul food. 

The decor is cute - warm yellow walls with a kitchen counter along the wall which has a faux window, a couple sinks, and acts as the display for all the delicious looking homemade cakes. It's friendly and welcoming. 

Our server and the chef frequently stopped by our table (but not too much) and were friendly and chatty. The chef told us the restaurant has only been open a few months, but he used to have a restaurant in North Hollywood for 30 years. His passion for tasty food was very visible. Added bonus: after we ordered, while we were waiting for food, the chef encouraged us to pick a couple of the cakes on display to try a small slice of. We tried the mudslide, lemon cake, and the candy man. All three were so amazing. The lemon cake is what they call an ""ooey gooey"" cake, which I have no words to describe but is amazing. 

I ordered fried chicken breasts with Mac & cheese and string beans. Holy moly, the fried chicken was tender and flavorful throughout. I've had fried chicken breasts elsewhere that only the skin was flavorful, so for the center of the breast to be just as flavorful as the outside was perfect. The Mac & cheese was so good. The beans needed some hot sauce but so delicious. 

The portion was huge - the chicken comes with 2 pieces of chicken (they let you pick) so I have half of my meal for leftovers. Win! 

If you love soul food, you have to check this place out. The food is delicious, the service is great, just overall awesome. Cannot recommend enough!",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,1,0,5,4a-mAdPoFgQh46N5VQ4vKA

I ordered fried chicken, mac and cheese, and yams. Everything came out fresh, steaming hot, and beyond delicious.  My 11 year old nephew was with me and he kept exclaiming that it was a five star restaurant; I couldn't agree more. If you are in the area it is worth your while to dine here:)",iIDcYDZLu_0bjQgO4q7Rmg,2,4,5,hoThCXHM9-IFC38RIpVIBg
5955061,2018-06-06,0,mD8bJbumIGOtlXXuvVNuqw,"I really enjoy this place! Delicious food, great service, and sweet red kool-aid flows! My family and I come here often, if not for a full meal then at least to grab a slice of cake. My mother, daughter, and I have always enjoyed what we've ordered. 

My favorite food of those I've tried is definitely the smothered chicken, the gravy is just *drool face* . The sides are all meatless which is a plus for my picky, non-pork eating friends. And the lunch menu has the same delicious items in (pretty much) the same portions as dinner for a cheaper price. 

It's hard to come across good soul food in the valley, and of the few options we have, this place is at the top of my list!",z5lb-N1alNpuyjZJyXiNgg,1,0,5,svdMPSeSMYb4VKK5vqQMsA
