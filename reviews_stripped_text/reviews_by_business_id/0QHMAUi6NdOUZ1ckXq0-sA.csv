 We had booked a table so it didn't take us long to be seated and a waitress came quickly to give us menus and to take our drinks orders. The menu had items from seafood, beef and chicken to pastas and pizza. A member of our party had special dietary requirements but nothing was to much trouble for the waitress in finding out what they could eat, or what could be adapted for them.


 The atmosphere of the restaurant was fun - the seating is within a jungle them - the ceiling was decorated like a sky with stars. There are a lot of animals in the jungle who move and make sounds. About every half an hour there is a thunderstorm


 There is also a gift shop where you can buy jungle themed items.


 A great place to eat - but would advise booking otherwise you may have to queue for a while.",pe3ieI-TrviX5OKq9JMV2Q,0,0,4,nbj2Yq5EF4BvaLCGeEsyoA

We weren't expecting much from this place but the service we received was horrendous. The trouble began when our server Mike sat down at the table with us to take our order. He got a little close and periodically kept touching my friend during our visit. We both ordered appetizers for our meal: the quesadillas and spinach and artichoke dip which were subpar. We were never given forks or knives and had to ask for napkins that we finally ended up receiving after him telling us he was ""a dick for forgetting napkins and straws"", keep in mind there are children around. This didn't stop him from commenting on how his ""ass"" was in our faces when he was taking the couple next to our's order.

Mike loved playing the blame game. I ordered a refill of my drink and when he forgot about it he blamed the bartenders and said that he wasn't sure if there was vodka in it. When the table next to our's food arrived 35 minutes later he told them that the rainforest cafe gets their kitchen staff from McDonald's - which is both insulting to his fellow employees and the intelligence of the customers. 

Before we started eating we knew we wanted to share the coveted sparkling volcano dessert. Not having mentioned this we were a little surprised when Mike aggressively said ""here's a subliminal message"" and slammed the sign for the dessert on our table. We ended up ordering it and of course once it arrived it was pretty bad. 

Mike seemed very frazzled the entire time even though his section didn't appear very busy. I strongly suggest that this establishment do some drug testing on their employees.",znNp7ysWoiUfZ7PpQu0yuQ,1,1,1,9y-npQbudB2t6lpl-T8jmw

Although the rainforest-themed decor is basically enjoyable and did pique my kids interest, it was really only good for about ten minutes of fun. The kids food menu is completely uninspired and woefully over-priced ($10 for plain pasta and a cup of milk). The grown-up food was similarly expensive and dull. The taste and quality of everything was a step up from a fast food chain, but just barely. My pasta dish had definitely spent a bit of time under a heat lamp before being served. Portion size was on the small side, although I didn't like what I was eating enough to be bothered by this,

Perhaps most annoying was the fact that the waiter tried to up-sell us on just about everything (""Are you sure you don't want an appetizer?"", ""How about a bottle of wine instead of a glass?"" and then later ""I'm really surprised you didn't just order a bottle.""). That said, the service was attentive.

On my way out there were two things I couldn't figure out: 1) Why would anyone without kids ever consider eating here?, 2) Even with kids, why would you stand in an hour-plus line of walk-ins waiting for a table?

It's kitschy like you'd expect if you've never been there before, and given the millions upon millions of people that flow through Sin City every year and never having seen a Rainforest Café anywhere else outside the Southwestern US, it's not all surprising that it's there. 

It does its job when you order the familiar as well - cobb salad, chicken sandwiches/wraps, chicken fingers. It's not for the adventurous, though the name would fool you, wouldn't it? 

I was sad about the lack of beer on draft, as the one in South Coast Plaza does a much better job, but maybe my drinking shouldn't have started prior to Mr. Harris arriving.

I tend to avoid these kinds of places to eat, as they're too ""much"" for their own good, and the wait staff looked less interested in the entertainment than we did (and it's Vegas!).

We should have been nervous when we were waiting to be seated. The restaurant was chaos, even though it was not full. We stood in line waiting for at least 15 minutes while there were numerous open tables. 

When we did get seated, it took much longer than what's acceptable for our waiter to come over to say he'd be back in a few minutes. Actually, a nice waitress came and took our order. I informed the waitress that I have celiac disease and asked if the nachos were gluten free. She said she'd check and get back to me. 

While my boyfriend and I waited for our meals, our waiter had his one shinning moment of not sucking when he brought us refills of our drinks without us asking!  Eventually, our food came out. I had the nachos (without ever confirming if they were safe), and my boyfriend had the avocado burger, even though he ordered the bacon burger. He would have mentioned it but we never saw our waiter again. 

When we were done eating, we waited at least 20 for another employee to come over and say our waiter was ""swamped"" and could he do anything. I said that'd I'd like to be able to leave and the boyfriend mentioned the burger mix up. Other employee said he'd look into it. He came back and told us that yes, he'd ordered the bacon burger, but the runner had made a mistake. He proceeded to ask if we'd like a burger to go. I don't think so. 

The food was meh. My nachos were just under $20 and they were tortilla chips with beef, cheese, sour cream and an attempt at pico. We spent $46 and were super disappointed. We will not be going back.",arpWiAkWebSGzdjmaaXqRw,0,0,1,Oe9KImYqm_9D3TcXs6KBsw

There might have been about 1/2 oz of cheese, maybe one entire piece of bacon chopped up and a few leaves of spinach. The only way I choked it down was with Tabasco and because I am pregnant and hungry!

I ordered the Amazon Feast (A combination of Rotisserie Chicken and slow-roasted, St. Louis style pork spare ribs basted with our Smokin' Mojo BBQ sauce served with Safari fries and coleslaw) and what can I say... the chicken was very dry and the ribs were just disappointing. After eating so much good food off the strip, we were really disappointed in eating here. The reason we went in the first place was because of nostalgia and remembering it being better than it really was. So sad. It was funny because we both said it was good (because we wanted to like it) until one point in the dinner, where we just looked at each other and silently agreed and expressed our mutual dissatisfaction. At least that was amusing, lol.

Our first visited was in Niagara Fall Ontario, 2nd  time was in Downtown Disney ,this is my 3rd time and the kids just love it  when we enter the restaurant with welcoming tropical fish tanks leading the way to our table.
The decoration of this place is a lush Rain forest scenery  ,we were sitting  next to the water fall , it was a bit noisy but the water really cool you down from the hot air out door , during our visit Rain Forest is Acting up few times , with  loud  rolling thunderstorm, lighting  ,rain  drops ( sound only), the sounds of animals are jumping with fear,  the starry ceiling which changes colors and we saw the very dark Blue Moon .LOL ! Not just the kids, I love it too. :) What a life after this dinner we will be at David Copperfield Magic show.
 The food are well prepare in a reasonable price, some time the surrounding would make your meal tastier. We will visit again and the next one we do not know where yet  :)

I ordered an entree because it was cheap at $16 and received a plate of pasta covered in tomato sauce. This was something I could have easily made at home.

Sadly we were so upset by the lack of service and crappy food he picked up our discontent and did not seem to enjoy the ambiance as much as he might have if we hadn't spent the entire time trying to get a waiter attention.

First off, when we were waiting to be seated the hostess was not very friendly. They all seemed like there was something else they'd rather be doing than seating and greeting.... We were finally seated and our waiter came, introduced himself, didn't offer any drink sales or specials or anything more than his name. He took our drink order, brought us our beverages in a timely manner. Then came back 15 or so minutes later to take our food order.... We never saw him again.... At least not at our table. I saw him on numerous occasions at the waiter station but never at our table. Our food was undercooked when it came to the steaks and over cooked when it came to my husbands shrimp. My veggies were burnt, I wanted to send back my plate, but that would have required getting my waiters attentions..... I wanted a refill on my diet coke, but again never saw my waiter....

My husband and I had a reservation for 8:15 and we got there at 8:17 and they still didn't have a table for us.  We had to wait 10 minutes to get seated (leaving us with only 50 minutes before we had to be seated for Cirque de Soleil).  We ordered right away, and to their credit, the food was brought relatively quickly.  I got the check as SOON as our food arrived to ensure that we could just bolt when we were done eating.  

I had the Avocado Burger, and it was ENORMOUS!  It had avocado, a huge onion ring AND bacon piled on top.  Wow!  I could barely get my mouth around it, and I was only able to eat half of it.  Same went for my husband, who ordered the Blue Mountain burger.  The burgers were very tasty, even if it's impossible to eat the whole thing!  (I really don't want to know the calorie count on THOSE burgers!)  The fries were very good, thin and crispy.  We also shared a chicken quesadilla, which came on pita bread instead of the traditional tortilla - a nice twist but BOY that's a lotta carbs!

If we hadn't been in such a rush, we could have relaxed and enjoyed ourselves more, but we did get to see 2 rainstorms, which are always cool.  The lights go dim, the fake sky glows and thunders, the animatronic animals roar and move around, and water pours from the ceiling into planters that catch the ""rain.""  

Overall, I would say that it is a perfectly fine choice for a tasty dinner and a fun atmosphere.  It is a little too gimmicky for my taste, and the food is a little over-priced for the basic fare it is, but it IS on the Strip, so you will pay a little more for everything.  They do have healthy options such as salads and veggie burgers, so it is possible to eat healthier than we did.  It's a bit noisy, so it's not a romantic, intimate option.  Good for families and parties.  Make a reservation, as it is VERY busy, and service may be a little slow at peak hours.",PFqhDyFta-8imsKa4bK3pQ,0,0,3,-FU0hsNBZapRCIKTWZcVIA

I've lived in Las Vegas for 8 years and have never received such appalling service. That is probably why I have never eaten at Rainforest before. I should have stuck with my intuition. 

On a Friday night around closing time with a small rush from the club next door my friends and I ordered a few drinks and an appetizer. The drinks came slowly as the bartenders were more focused on closing the bar and the appetizer almost never came. We waited 45 minutes for an appetizer and if we hadn't made three unsuccessful attempts to alert management before finally getting their attention a fourth time then we probably would have never received it. 

Management was not only unresponsive but upon contact with management (Erika) they seemed to have lack of concern and offered absolutely no resolution. This is just food and beverage. Making me happy is as simple as showing some sympathy and throwing me a concession for my time and satisfaction for which you have frivolously wasted.

It was inside the MGM Grand (and thus probably the smallest), and while it had some familiar/impressive aspects, it was nothing like the Rainforest Cafes I have known.

We went on a slow Monday night with our two small children. You would think that the hosts would want to seat children close to an aquarium or jungle critter to help enhance their experience. Nope, instead we were seated against a wall next to the kitchen. We asked to be moved so that our kids could see SOMETHING, and they stuck us next to the bar facing the entrance of the kitchen. There were seats available all throughout but they seemed unwilling to accommodate. 

The waiter wasn't terrible, but when our food took nearly an hour to get to us, were given a dirty plate (old food stuck on it), a RAW steak and shrimp that hadn't even been de-veined (for the prices you pay at this place they can at least take the vein out!) he did nothing to resolve the issue. 

In general the food was awful. The fries were undercooked and tasted ""off"", my daughter who loves chicken forced down a few bites of her meal before telling us it was gross, I already mentioned the issues with my husband's meal... It was BY FAR nowhere near worth the money!

What we can only assume was a manager on duty was making her rounds asking people how things were, and when approached, my husband shrugged and said ""not great"". We aren't sure if this woman didn't hear him correctly or just wasn't paying attention, but she smiled, said ""good!"" and walked on. 

Absolutely no one cared about our satisfaction or making things right. A place like this doesn't belong shoved into a casino half-heartedly. But its apparent that is exactly what happened here.

Being inside the MGM Grand, I expected expensive but the cheapest meal item I found was $15+. That's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink. The waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer. A margarita would have cost $11 to start so I just ordered a Coke (which was $3 I believe.) I ordered the appetizer sampler because it seemed I'd at least get quite a bit of food for my money.

Now, I knew that the reason for the expense would be the convenience of being inside the MGM Grand and the 'show' that is put on by being surrounded by a ""rainforest"" of sorts. The entire thing is animatronic and features a storm that goes off every half hour or so. Honestly, I found the whole thing laughably cheesy and couldn't believe this is what we were paying extra for. The entire thing would have been impressive If I was much younger and living in the 1980's.... MAYBE.

As for the quality of service, it was mediocre at best. The table next to us was seated and ordered later, but had their drinks refilled before mine. The waiter often disappeared and it took my girlfriend asking him to get drinks refilled. Food was okay, nothing special and nothing I'd pay extra for.

Rainforests are being cleared to make way for industrial cattle farms so we in America can enjoy cheap beef. Sorry, must suppress the inner hippie. Coming from San Diego, where we don't have much rain, it was refreshing to dine in a restaurant where the casual conversations with my friends were interrupted every 15-20 minutes by large outbursts of soundboard-manufactured thunderclaps which signal a deluge from strategically positioned misters. You can see that it's raining indoors but you don't actually feel it. How exciting! How authentic!

Our party of 10 was given a 45 minute wait time, which for Vegas on a Friday night at 6PM isn't bad. We stood around, looked at some big fish, poked and prodded the overpriced novelty items in the gift shop, and before we knew it (but 20 minutes after we were expecting it) they sat our group. Our waitress further added to the authenticity of the experience. Her accent was a colorful mixture of Rosetta Stone English (Disc 1), Dutch imperialism, and the click language of the San Bushmen people. We put in our drink orders and instructed her how to split the check without issue. Then the 20-minute wait began. This wasn't as horrible as it sounds now because for the first 10 minutes we were occupied with determining which items on the menu would be the least likely to give us Ebola or Gastroenteritis. I knew this was going to be an extended outing when our waters came out filled to the brim and ice-cold but without any ice. Do the math, geniuses reading this. 

The next 10 minutes were spent putting in our orders, re-confirming the check splits, and ordering refills. This deliberate undertaking was partially due to our waitress's incompetence (and likely inability to pass the CAHSEE), and primarily due to a passing thunderstorm in conjunction with Diddy Kong's screeching serenade from across the restaurant which made it impossible to hear. 

And then we waited...
And waited...
And waited some more..... (this ellipses gets an extra two periods to further accentuate the amount of time we had to wait)

And then the food came!! YAYYY! 
And it was still warm! Yayyy! 
And 90% of the orders were correct!!! YAYY!!! 
And nobody had to gnaw on their own flesh during the 40 minutes we waited for our food to come out even as we watched tables who were sat and ordered after us received their food. Yayyyy!!!

This review is not about the food. The food was good. I think everyone in the group thoroughly enjoyed the flavor/temperature/texture of their meal. 

This review is about the service. And the almost 20 minutes we waited after our plates were cleared to receive the split checks. I know splitting checks is difficult for a party of 10, especially when people join the group late and people get up and move around when they're bored with the person next to them. I get that. I've been there. Waiting tables is not easy. But any decent waiter/waitress, noob or lifer, with an IQ over 85 can split a check in less time than it takes to watch an episode of Family Guy, even with a DVR skipping over the commercials. 

Remember what time I said we arrived? Go back and do the math while factoring in a little over 20 minutes to eat...

I sort of groaned when a member of my party suggested it for dinner, but we did need to eat so I went along.
They have the hostess podium cleverly set back out of view from the front, so you can't see how long the line is until you approach for a seat.
About every marketing gimmick you have ever encountered out in the restaurant chain world is alive and well here.  The greeting from our waitress was so obviously scripted, I expected her to check the palm of her hand for the correct wording.  Sample - May I take you on a tour of our menu and some of my favorite items?  Sure, only it just so happens all of her favorite items are on the nice laminated 'specials"" menu with bright pictures and names like tower of appetizers and a sparkling dessert volcano (I'm not making this up).  What are the odds that those just happen to be her ""favorites""?
I searched the menu for something safe.  Really, I just wanted something to fill my stomach and not make me sick, so I opted for the burger.  I am sure they sell lots of those here and it was one of the cheaper items on the menu for around $14.  Our food took a very long time to come out.  We were dining well before rush hour on a Thursday, I think we sat down around 5pm.  A place like this is built for volume and tries to turn the tables quickly so they can get people in and out, so I was surprised that things weren't a bit faster.  When our food did arrive, it came in shifts.  Our server was no where in sight, but two other servers brought the first round.  They had no idea where the food went, so continued to auction it off to the table - who had the quesadillas?  A short time later, more servers arrived with the last of the entrees.  Two of us had ordered the same type of burger, cooked differently, so when that one went up for auction, I asked how it was cooked.  The reply was -I don't know.  So I asked why they didn't have position numbers for the order.  I wasn't really trying to give the servers a hard time, but would expect most any high-volume restaurant to require servers to identify the position number of any orders, if only to avoid confusion like this.  The server apologized and said the food took longer because one of the other burgers was ordered plain.  Our group just looked at each other in puzzlement.  Why would a plain burger take longer?  
For all of the service glitches, my burger was surprisingly good.  Not exactly worth $14, but the roll was nice and fresh, the skinny fries were crispy and the burger had decent flavor.  Our original server finally checked in on us and the rest of dinner was fine.  However, on our way out we decided to visit their restrooms to clean up and I am sorry we didn't go out into the casino instead.  They were in a pretty sad state and reminded me more of the facilities you would find in a college bar.  Several stalls were unusable, so I suspect it had been a while since staff had checked on it.

As you might expect, the food and drink are just okay. The food was adequate, but quite unmemorable. They really, really push buying that souvenir glass; but in retrospect, it's not much of a good deal. The drinks sound good on the menu, but are  weak tasting. Get a bottle of beer instead - at least you know what you're getting. 

But, food and drink are not so much why one goes to a Rain Forest Cafe, is it? You go for the fun atmosphere, right? Well, this one is pretty ~flat~ now days.

Yes the food is overpriced for what you get. Especially when you realize you are paying nearly $20 for a wrap and Lay's potato chips. But nearly everything I've tried  is pretty tasty. The wraps are great and I recommend the chicken over the beef, it's more flavorful. The chimi cha cha appetizer is spicy and delicious. The burgers are huge and usually good. The pot roast is fork tender and yummy. I didn't care for the macadamia nut mahi mahi. It didn't have a crisp to it at all, almost like the nut mix was just sprinkled on top and thrown on the plate and it was very fishy and rubbery tasting like maybe it had been microwaved. The side of steamed veggies was typical mushy squash mix and the rice was flavorless and almost hard.

The service on our last visit was not the best. We had a blond server near the bar sections by the fountain. She was nice enough but we had to ask for things several times before it finally arrived at our table. She was way too busy reciting her sales pitch scripts for everything from the membership program to her ""favorite"" desserts  to remember what we actually asked for. She only seemed to have a few tables and it wasn't busy at all so I can't really figure out why she was having such a hard time.

Unfortunately, we were in London together a few years back and I guess just forgot to go, but hey, there's always time!

Either way, not much to say about this particular location, other than the fact that it might be bussier than the other locations that I have been to (not a surprise, since it's Vegas).  The food is the same here as at the other locations, and I always order the same thing every time I go anyway (I get the rasta pasta, which is penne pasta with broccoli, red peppers, and grilled chicken, with a pesto and pine nut sauce on top).  Prices are the same (fairly pricey for the quality of the food, but hey you're also paying for the decor, which includes a rainforest that comes alive every 20 minutes or so...AWESOME).

I had THE most horrible experience at this restaurant, so bad in fact that I will never visit another Rainforest Cafe at any location again in my lifetime. 
Our party had 4 people in it and we wanted to grab something to eat before watching Love. I ordered a Portobello Mushroom Burger (only maybe 2 vegetarian options on the menu). Our server was nice but the service was extremely slow.
Finally we got our food. My burger was lukewarm and my fries cold. It was bland, dry, distasteful,  and even the presentation was horrible. About 1/3 of the way into my burger I felt as if the taste was off. I opened the bun to find that the shredded lettuce they put on my burger was wilted, brown, and rotting. Disgusting! I lost my appetite immediately. 
I waited and waited and waited for our server to finally come over to check on us. Upon mentioning to him that I was disappointed and dissatisfied with my order he offered to get the manager of the restaurant. I accepted. Another waiting game. Our server returned and told us that ""the manager is too busy"" to come to our table. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full given that we came during the off season. At this point we wanted to just leave. I asked if I could get the price of my meal deducted from the tab and he walked off to get our bill. 5 minutes later the manager comes to our table.
She asked what the problem was, I told her, and  her reply was ""our lettuce isn't rotten, the cook checked it, the lettuce wilts when it comes into contact with heat"" which is true but it does not cause the lettuce to brown. Browning means that is is old and rotting. I explained this to her and she looked dead at me and said (with a horrible snide attitude) ""You didn't realize the lettuce was rotten after already eating half of it?"" Never in my life have I had a manager of an establishment sass me while I point out their product is below mediocre. She deducted half of the price of the burger after giving everyone at our table a horrible attitude and experience. 
No one in my party ever wants to visit another Rainforest Cafe based on the experience the manager gave us. 
If you want amazing food, excellent service for a decent price go to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR in Planet Hollywood. The difference, literally, is night and day.",Hc1iuwFNTALnYqXR3p8blQ,8,0,1,JK2oFypgFODIA6Y2L3davg

We waited about 20-25 minutes in line, but it was just as long at other MGM restaurants (excluding the $$$ ones, of course). Our server Eli was AWESOME. He had an upbeat personality, and got us all psyched up for lunch. He made honest recommendations when I couldn't decide between two entrees and two drinks. Also, I have a potentially-fatal food allergy, and Eli was beyond accommodating. He brought out the chef, and would not place our order until he confirmed our food would be made separately to avoid cross-contamination. 

Unfortunately, service was slow (took 15 minutes to get drinks, and 40 minutes to get our food). And to our dismay, as soon as my salad was delivered and triple checked, Eli brought a new waitress over. His shift was over; she was taking over. She didn't check on us once, she was quiet, she brought us two boxes when we asked for four, and she didn't smile. Good thing Eli outweighed the bad (and I gave him his tip before he left).

Our food was relatively good, nothing too special; we got the appetizer combo, burgers, and a chicken sandwich. Burgers and sandwich were a bit soggy/messy, but nonetheless, delish. I hate fries, but their fries were extremely tasty. As for pricing, compared to other places in the MGM, it's not that bad. My sandwich was about $15 (+ $3 for my salad) and my drink was about the same (plus I got the souvenir cup). Unless you wanna spend $25 for a small dish and no drink elsewhere, or eat at the more casual spots, this is a good place. Also, they do separate checks, not easy to get in Vegas (we had 7 people). On the way out, I asked a waiter if I could take my drink out. He enthusiastically offered to pour it into a to-go cup and rinse out my cup so I could put it in my bag. Super cool.

The manager came by to apologize for our refills taking so long, but we hadn't even noticed that it was taking too long. She was also real nice and stayed to chat for a while. 
The only reason this only gets 4 starts and not 5 is due to the rudeness of the girl working in the gift shop. The restaurant had run out of bags and suggested we ask the gift shop for one because we had 3 boxes off leftovers to take with us. When I approached the counter, the girl refused to look up and acknowledge me standing there. Finally I said, ""excuse me"" and asked if she had a bag showing her all my boxes. To which she snapped, ""our bags are for customers"" . I again indicated to the boxes. Her rude response was ""people who buy things in the store"". I then asked if the $100 plus dollars I spent at the restaurant didn't quality me for a bag. To which she said no again. Wow! Were the bags made from gold! ?

It's hard to mess up anything deep fried and or full of butter....so my food was quite tasty and I did get it rather quickly. After that service pretty much disappeared for me.

The service was hit or miss. The first time we went, our server was incredible. She was attentive, friendly, and worth the generous tip we gave her.

I've been here before and had a great experience, but apparently things have changed. The cashier in the gift shop was rude and treated us like we were interrupting her. I ended up not buying anything because of her Crappy attitude. There was only a short wait for a table which was a surprise because the other times I've been here (more than 3 years ago) the line was always very long. Once seated though, we had a bit of a wait before we were able to place our order (15 minutes or so, which is a long time with kids that age). Finally placed our order, which was basic stuff, 3 kids meals, a couple of burgers and a soup in a bread bowl.  We did receive our drinks right away, but waited over 1 hour for our food. I would have asked our waitress to check on our order sooner, but We didn't even see her again until then. Once I was able to ask where our food was she scurried back to the kitchen and immediately brought everything out. It had all obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time, but because the kids were anxious to eat we didn't complain.  The adult food was quite good in spite of having been left sitting for so long, but the kids meals were very disappointing. One plate had 4 French fries on it, another had a giant mound of fries, and the other was somewhere in between. The grilled cheese was 2 super thick slices of bread with one thin little slice of cheese, and the chicken nuggets were just heated up frozen dinosaur nuggets. For $10 a plate it seems like they could have made their own chicken nuggets and threw on another slice of cheese. I don't know what our friend paid for her soup and 1 kids meal, but the bill for me, my daughter and 2 grand kids came to $68 dollars, which was for 2 kids meals, 2 burger meals, 1 soda, 1 iced tea and 2 waters for the kids.  To be fair, my burger was very good, but really, almost $70 for that? Based on this experience we won't be going back.

Rainforest Pita Quesadillas
Coastal Calamari
Leaping Lizard lettuce wraps
Lava Nachos
Caribbean shrimp

My favorite, Leaping Lizard Lettuce wraps, were pleasant to the taste. Lettuce wraps were fresh, crunchy & the sautéed chopped chicken was well-seasoned.

The names on the menu items definitely set the funny jungle theme ...an attraction for the kids but not so much for the adults. Definitely, not the place for a romantic date or a business lunch meeting.

NEVER EVER serve pasta without a spoon!  That was engraved in every staff's brain top to bottom.

So I tried to flagged down a staff. A server, a busboy,a runner, a hostess or ANYONE!  For 6 mins, not ONE person looked my way with my 2 arms raised and waving back-and-forth. Until finally one waitress walked by and I had to literally GRAB her as she zips by.  Do you think this service is acceptable?

Finally when I grabbed this waitress, I asked for a spoon for my pasta and asked for fresh ground pepper (mill) I was told there isn't one in the whole restaurant (this fact was later confirmed with the manager when I asked forher).  The server I grabbed told me that I can use the pepper on my table.  OH REALLY!!?? Do you think I am blind that I didn't notice there is a salt and pepper shaker on front of me?

To be clear, our assigned waitress/server was VERY GOOD.  We asked her for an extra saltine crackers with the clam chowder but when the runner brought the soup with the standard bag of crackers, she noticed it and asked the runner to bring another one (he had appearently forgotten). We also asked extra plate to share, once again the runner forgotten it.  

I think they have some SERIOUS service issue with this reataurant. Particularly, hospitality and service is a TEAM work and not just an individual effort.  For $90 bucks on lunch, I think I will stick with Nathan's hotdogs next time when staying at MGM Grand.

Edit: 
I received a call 2 days later (after I returned home) from the restaurant manager, stating that they received my comment from the survey I filled-out on my card.  He said that they DO have fresh peper mills and was baffled why their staff didn't know about it.  Regardless, he thanked me for my comment/complaint and we agreed that there has to be some more staff training.",bnHp5a7EIzytrV5JTpoj6A,2,0,2,ePmXl2bQRkxidUosmCxuSA

It's not BAD, either, you just have to know what you're getting into.

We were there on a recent Saturday evening.  Of all times, we thought this would be an acceptable one for being a bit drunk and a bit rowdy at the rainforest.  It was okay with the staff (kudos to them for not being uptight), but not with a couple of the patrons around us.  There was a portly couple sitting immediately adjacent to our table, and they were VERY serious about their food.  No riffraff tolerated.  Sorry, folks, I can't help that my friend is ""that guy.""  Okay, maybe I could, but I don't want to!

Anyway, I was impressed that the staff didn't bend to the pressure of said portly patrons when they complained that we were too rambunctious.  This is, after all, VEGAS, folks.

So I can't really say that I was all that impressed with the Rainforest Cafe. First off - you can't collect Mlife points from eating here. I think it has to do with the restaurant being actually part of a chain but that isn't really explained that well by their servers when asked. 

Face it - you are really going for the novelty of the place and not the food or drinks. The animals come ""to life"" every 20 minutes or so and the animatronics in there are severely outdated. 

There was next to no booze in my drink that I ordered so I paid extra for a semi-spiked juice. I had fish and chips where the fish batter had no flavor and the fish had been over cooked. The fries with it were just kinda sad, and a little bit cold. 

My boyfriend had the ravioli which was not bad but really not very high quality at all. It was maybe two notches over Chef Boyardi quality.

The food has always been good, with the kids and adults all ordering different dishes and sampling each.  We haven't had a bad meal there, but again, I don't believe you go here for the food.

The food itself is fine.  the coconut shrimp and the ribs are always well done.  Their crab dip is also quite delightful, and you can easily be filled up on this stuff alone.

However when it comes to the MGM location, the star meter should be in the negatives strictly based on service alone.  Never have I been to a place where I've felt more neglected and treated so rudely.  This is the second time it's happened to me here and I'll never come to this location again.

Our story starts off with us getting seated next to a huge b-day party of fifteen.  Our hostess leaves telling us to enjoy our ""safari"".  Ten minutes go by and not a single ""hello"" or drink order from anyone.  I'm tipping over w/ rage at this point based upon my previous experience and immediately call upon my first manager.  I explained to her how time has gone by and we haven't been helped and she was shocked and took our order right away.

Now you'd think at this point the person that's supposed to be waiting on us would've come by to apologize at least.  If he did that all would be forgiven somewhat.  However he didn't.  In stead he acted like his mom just took away his TV privileges for a month and he slid our waters onto our table, tossed my dining card on the table and stormed off.  I had it at this point and was redder than their stupid sparkly thing they put on their volcano dessert.

Upon comes my request for manager #2.  I requested that our waiter be removed and replaced with a different one or we get reseated to a different section.  I even could've played the race card if I wanted to as it was clear our waiter didn't like Asians and would rather serve his own kind, but I let it be.  The manager was very apologetic and introduced us to our new waitress as the other manager came over with our appetizers.  At this point our original waiter came over and noticed both his bosses and another colleague were at our table and actually tried to come over and take the appetizer platter away from the manager and serve it to us.  Everyone kind of just looked at him stunned.  Needless to say I wasn't too pleased and voiced my opinion to have him removed from our presence immediately.  The managers shooed him away like you would any animal that came near your property.  

The service did get better at this point as Manager #2 was always within our line of sight and he kept a constant watch to make sure we were taken care of.  However this didn't make up for the delays and the neglect right off the start.

I admire the managers for taking control and making sure they did what they could to rectify a poor situation, however the bad service from our original waiter stems from above.  They should have a firmer grip on their staff and should make sure they hire people that know how to do a good job.

Our only option at the time was Rainforest Cafe.  We were a group of 8 that included smaller children and teenagers so heading over to CUT was not an option! 

We had to wait in a roped off line for our seat.  Once we were seated the place didn't seem too crowded at all.  They placed all 8 of us at a makeshift joined table (one round and one square) which made for awkward seating.  While our waitress wasn't bad, she wasn't all that stellar either.  The food took FOREVER to make it to our table and one item came out cold (despite the hot plate).  She was a bit of a smart ass on a couple of issues which is never good.  Sometimes when people know the gratuity is automatically included, the service tends to suffer.  

Their prices are also a little surprising as well.  The portion sizes aren't horrible but for the amount of food you get, I expect a little more at that price tag.

We also had an issue with dirty silverware which was a little discouraging.

At the end, our server was due to receive a $30 tip (mainly because of my liquor purchase).  My bro-in-law ended up having the manager lower it due to the absence of service and cold food.  The waitress was super pissed and her attitude changed immediately.  I think she actually snatched the billfold back from my nephew... 

I can honestly say that I will most likely never return to this location (or chain again).

Fish & Chips: Does mercury have a metallic taste? Just wondering, because that's how my fish tasted. The fries lost their crunchiness from the oil absorbed from the battered and fried fish strips.

Chocolate Indulgence: It's just ice cream sandwiches, fudge sauce (tastes like bottled Hershey's syrup), a Heath bar, and whipped cream. And you know what?

After another twenty minutes I saw our server and asked if our appetizer and the side salad I had ordered would arrive before the meal.  Once again we got the blinky eyes.  No salad order had been put in and she had no idea bout the appetizer.

Cons
The ""Food""

While in Las Vegas my wife, 10 month old daughter, and I decided to try the Rainforest Cafe located in the MGM Grand. We all enjoyed the decor, the service was so so, but the food was absolutely disgusting. We started things off with 2 waters and a diet coke and ordered the ""Awesome Appetizer"". All the food on the platter (2 chix strips, 2 chimmi cha cha's ,crab dip, and calamari) was cold except the crab dip which was piping hot. One thing I don't understand is the chix strips and calamari where both very lightly cooked almost underdone but the chimi cha cha (similar to a chili's southwestern eggroll) was overcooked and really dark. Having worked in a restaurant for a few years I knew this was from using old fry oil that had gone too long without filtration or replacement, it causes a burnt crust with an almost smoky/bitter taste and an undercooked center.

For our main dishes I had ordered a cobb salad and my wife had the ""Rasta Pasta"". My salad was also pretty bad, a good portion of the lettuce was wilted. It was also pretty clear that they didn't take the time to dry the lettuce after washing it. The wet lettuce couldn't hold onto the dressing which caused a pool of water/dressing to form in the bottom of my bowl. My wifes pasta wasn't as disgusting, but it wasn't good either. The chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland.

The total bill for our meal came to just over $70 which is way to much for the quality of the food. After 11 nights in Las Vegas this is by far the worst place we ate at, I have no idea why the MGM Grand would allow the restaurant in it's casino.

The service, however, was great. Our waitress was so nice and friendly and added to my kid's birthday dinner experience. I hear they're going to close this place sometime this year.

It was a long trip and we just wanted to get something in our belly that wasn't a fortune. I've eaten here previously prior to my celiac diagnosis and had decent food so I was confident they would be able to provide me with a meal to suit my needs.

We ate at the bar because there was a 20 minute wait for a table in the dining room. The manager was behind the bar and said the chef would come out and make me whatever I wanted after I explained to him about celiac disease and gluten.

25 minutes later, the manager was gone and the chef never came out to check on me. So I just decided to order a salad and tell them the obvious, no croutons and no bread.

The salad came out with bread on the side of the plate so my sister just took it and ended up eating it. I picked the lettuce off of the salad where the bread had been just in case.

The salad was just okay. Nothing to write home about. I didn't end up sick afterwards or feeling sick so I guess that's all that really matters. It is getting tiring of always settling for something just to stay safe.

My first issue was that I didn't receive my food until about 10 minutes after everyone else. By the time I knew it, everyone in my group had already finished and was waiting on me. The waiter did offer me a soup on the house but I declined and requested a free soda instead. 

The second issue was that the waiter took forever for the most simple things. He had to be asked three times for him to refill a beverage. He would disappear for a while then show up and disappear again. We had to wait about 15 minutes after our meal to even get our check. 

Third issue is when I told the manager I wasn't happy with my visit he said he will go in the back and see what the issue was. HE NEVER CAME BACK.

It has a replica of the sky with shooting stars, a waterfall, huge trees, and different animals that come to life every so often.

It's been a long while since we went to this local theme restaurant location (we went to the Downtown Disney location while on vacation this past February)- last went here when we were in the midst of wedding planning (in fact, made the top 2 on our list), in 2005, wow! And this is one of our favorite theme restaurants, which is part of the Landry's family of chain restaurants (Landry's, Claim Jumper, Bubba Gump, Chart House, McCormick & Schmicks, Morton's, Aquarium, She, Golden Nugget, etc.)- so don't forget to use your Landry's Select card to rack up the points. 

Since the walk is a bit of a stretch inside the casino from the parking garage, with construction (the observation areas for the lions were removed some time ago- that was the last time we were in the MGM), plus add the large influx of tourists for Spring Break, we wondered if the wait for lunch would be horrible. But it really wasn't- about 15 minutes. I also figured that there were so many other choices at the MGM, maybe it wouldn't be as crowded (dinner may have been a different story). (BTW, the A rating is posted behind the hostess podium.) We were seated in a quieter section of the restaurant, behind the mushroom-domed bar, and looking outward to the casino-walking traffic. There were five gorillas (animatronics?) in our little nook. And one of them kept changing position and facing my husband at times.  

The atmosphere is pretty much the appeal along with good eats, of course. The jungle theme is a lot of fun. There is a storm every so often. From top to bottom, it is a jungle, through and through. There are colorful birds throughout. There also many aquariums with a good variety and range of bright colorful fish, located in the front and throughout. The servers all wear zoo-like attire/uniform, camel colored pants and button-down collared shirts. The bathrooms are located upstairs, 2nd floor (stairs and elevators- this is where the stroller parking is next to, as well). There is a baby-changing station in the corner of the bathroom, near the handicapped stalls in the back (but not inside the stall).  

The prices are a little higher here. We ended up getting our favorite item here, the sampler appetizer ($18; chimi-cha-chas, spinach artichoke dip with tri-colored chips, cheese sticks, & chicken tenders with guacamole, marinara sauce, & coconut curry sauce- we like to share. My favorite is the chimi-cha-chas (kinda similar to the southwest eggrolls @ Benigans). Everything was delicious, but some of the chips were a bit too salty, just scrape it off, if that happens to you too. My husband especially likes the coconut curry sauce, and we were dipping the tenders into it. And since it was Easter, we did splurge by getting dessert, bananas foster, which was pretty big- but we also shared this, too. (The featured dessert, a lava cake is $14.99- this a popular one.) The bill was a little over $28.00. The wait for our food getting to our table was not bad either. I had to feed the baby, while we were waiting. 

The staff was pretty good as a whole. While in line, there was a lady taking names and party numbers on a list. That's probably why the wait wasn't as long. The hostess greeted us right away; she was giving us an intro as she was seating us but it was hard to hear because of the noise level. The server was nice, and was surprised that we are locals. Guess not many locals visit, maybe because it's inside a casino. He did check on us a few times during our visit. The manager also made his rounds and thanked us for coming down for lunch. 

Afterward, we went to the store, and browsed. I think that there is a promotion for diners, to save 10% off their purchase. Cute stuff for kids. 

A fun place with jungle theme & aquariums, good eats for a theme restaurant, clean place (A rating), good staff, baby-changing station in the bathroom- we'll be back again. If there is a holiday, we'll make reservations next time.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,CFcIODv3Nm_yvuYMK-DDVg

There was a bit of a wait when we got there - as there was only one person seating people. But the person (or tour guide) seating people, Patty, was very nice and informs you of everything that goes on and everything around you as she walks you to your table.
Our server, Joey, came to our table almost immediately. We had a coupon for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree. There were four appetizers to choose from, and we decided on the mozzarella sticks. Yum! We ordered (and split) a chicken sandwich as our entree, and I got a strawberry lemonade. The food was surprisingly really good, as I read all the bad reviews during our meal. The service was excellent! Joey was fantastic and friendly, and I would completely recommend him.

We found a coupon in the booklet that we took from the taxi for a free appetizer, so we ordered the quesadillas.  They used pita bread instead of tortilla - great choice!  It was super tasty and a great pair with pita bread.  

We added a clam chowder for $5.99.  It was expensive, but the soup was good.

We also got a rack of ribs (Mojo Bones) that was paired with fries and cole slaw.  We swapped out the cole slaw for veggies, but the veggies tasted a little burnt since it was grilled.  The meat came off the bone easily and it was very flavorful.

We ordered a dish that came with fried shrimp, baked scallops, rice, and mango tilapia.  Do not order this.  The scallops were baked in a plate full of cheese that tasted like nacho cheese.  The texture of the scallops were okay, but definitely did not taste good with nacho cheese (the texture of the cheese was like water!).  The fish had tons of spices in it.  It was only good if you ate each bite with a piece of mango.  The rice and grilled veggies were average.  But at almost 30 bucks for this dish, I'd try something else.

We told the waitress that we had a birthday at our table.  She brought out a sundae that was half melted.  Really?  Are 2 scoops of ice cream (which they would have charged 2.50 for) that expensive to you?  Needless to say, we didn't eat the sundae and let it melt all the way down.  That was lame of them to give us melted ice cream to celebrate a birthday.

On top of that, our waitress took forever to get us our food and we had to ask repetitively for refills on our drinks, etc.  She had 6 or so tables so maybe she was caught up, but definitely took a long time to get everything we wanted here.",FImp5zfl4FOKGBAHt8s_ew,0,0,3,DbKZPBJuIQFOfQ1PkpvnmA

4577059,2009-08-01,4,0QHMAUi6NdOUZ1ckXq0-sA,"The thunderstorms should've been a foretelling of what was to come.....

We have been to the location in Downtown Disney (and everything Disney is always uber-organized), so we figured why not, and came here with our nieces that we were watching for the day/night and little one while staying at the Signature. 

You'd think that since this place is supposed to be about the experience and appeal to children that the kids would've had a blast. 

I should start off by saying that I called down to make a reservation from our Suite, and was hung up on twice within the phone actually picking up on the 7th ring!! Finally called down to our Concierge and mentioned we were unsuccessful for the last 10 minutes (I waited to call twice more hoping it was an ""accident"" - I know glutton for punishment, but those who know me know I am a huge pushover and ALWAYS think that there are such things as 5th chances....). 

After confirming a reservation with the concierge, they called back to say that the Cafe said we would have to wait 2 hours for a reservation, but if we wanted to head down now that we'd be able to get seated right away...????? 

So we headed down 2 hours later, just because the girls we're just too into the Lazy River. :)

When we got there - the condescending hostess asked me, and OVER enunciated every syllable:
"" I AM SORRY - DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ACTUALLY MADE THE RES-ER-VA-TION FOR TODAY? OR A DIFFERENT DAY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"" 

I blinked back in disbelief considering at 2 pm, half the restaurant was empty, and there wasn't even a line in the walk in area. 

So I fired back with:

""Yes, Indeed I understand what you are saying. The reservation is at 2, I called your line from our OWNERS suite in the Signature and was hung up on...

""interrupted with - oh we're very busy - so that tends to happen""

""NOT that that is acceptable, but I had our personal concierge call down for a reservation from the Signature - does that perhaps refresh your memory?""

""She said, well, I'll see what I can do""

WTF ? Who the F treats people that way? You're not freaking Craftsteak or any of the fine dining establishments in the building, and we're not random idiots who wandered off the street.

So back with the person who thinks that I don't understand her English vernacular, or that I am said random Idiot - we will find something for you but how many children do you have. 

4, plus 2 adults, and one of the children needs a highchair. 

OK I didn't ask about the high chair, I want to know how many children - can you tell me that?

OK - 4 children, 2 adults I said through a gritted teeth and a smile. After all, the kids are the ones who said they wanted to come here because their friends thought this was such a cool place. 

The entire process to get to our table was like this. 

The only consolation was that the guy who actually seated is was an older gentleman, very pleasant, and when he saw that within a few minutes of us being seated that we were going to have to encounter the wild Elephants bellowing in our faces within less than a foot, he volunteered to move us elsewhere - we gladly obliged. 

Our almost 2 year old, and the 7 and 10 year old nieces literally jumped every time the storm started because the elephants trunk would ""toot"" in their direction and shriek whenever a thunderstorm came. Not amusing. 

It took that long for the same cocky hostess to find us a table in a near  half empty restaurant. I think that is her way of trying to f with people with her ""perceived power"".

Good thing it usually takes us about that long to get the kittens in a box and figure out who wants what off the menu. 

The server was nice enough at first.

Then we had to remind him to bring 2 of our drinks, and oyster crackers for the 2 bowls of Clam Chowder. He brought them eventually, after the soup was half way finished. 

The food is TGIF with a twist on the name of the entrees. Like the Rumble in The Jungle Turkey Wrap. Wild Turkey in a Jungle? That should only come in a bottle.... VERY unexciting food really - except for my coconut shrimp = I only had one. Everyone else at the table had one off my plate. Should say something about the quality of the other food. 
p.s. WHO THE F charges 10 bucks for a kids Macaroni and small portion of bread? 

At the end of the meal, he did end up bringing our bill to us once he saw the kiddies were done eating. 

After telling him to charge it to our suite - he proceeded to give me the bill to sign, and mention that if we wanted to leave him a tip that we could do so at the bottom. 

Good thing I looked at all the receipts included and noticed the only one that listed the 17% service charge that was already added, was on the receipt he was going to keep for himself.

Too bad, no half stars - that would've gone to the older gentleman who really tried to be accommodating. 

Though we like the Restaurant Row available at the MGM/Signature - this place really takes the fun and convenience out of it.",yt94lMP-3UxDgRM2wX-WyA,6,2,1,XDb7VqTB5evhhS584G6_Xg

On the down side, we showed up at about 10 pm and it took over an hour to get some chicken tenders out. The food was not very good and the fries were cold. By the end of it we just wanted to leave and get a yard long margarita.

I've been to the Vegas Rainforest Cafe (in MGM) MANY MANY times before...I want to say two or three, when I was younger in elementary school and probably once more in middle/high school with my family. I've also been to the Downtown Disney location when I was around that age too, and all of those cumulative experiences only resulted in satisfied or mildly happy experiences! I loved the fake animals, every-ten-minutes-is-a-tropical-bonanza-of-animal-sounds, and outdoorsy safari vibe I got from Rainforest Cafe.

HOWEVER, things have since changed. Maybe it's because I've grown a lot older now and the magic seems gone, or maybe it was because my family ate here for dinner on a Tuesday night (23rd of December) right before Christmas Eve, BUT what's with the super slow service, overpriced plates, and my most ticked off point...nut-based pasta sauce when I specifically mentioned my allergies?! 

In the past, I've gotten kitchen-approved salads that ensured that my nut allergies were taken care of, but this time after our server clearly mentioned that the seafood pasta (one of the pasta specials not on the regular menu) we ordered had NO NUTS in it, I immediately felt a slight allergic reaction from a small bite. ALSO our other entrees were alright--my dad's steak was charred as a ""Medium Well,"" and the fish and chips were average. Our three entrees and two beers totaled over $130 after tax and tip. This cost even more than the Buffet dinner we had at Cravings in Mirage!!!

Now on to my review  
So I am a Vegas Local of almost two years now and this is my first time trying the Rainforest Café at MGM. All my prior experiences were at the San Francisco location.  Let me just say I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth this place runs considering how busy it can get.  We decided to go here to celebrate my son's fifth birthday. This is a great restaurant for children because they have all the amazing animals and thunderstorms.    When we arrived it was a pretty decent wait so we decided to join the Landry's Select Club . Now I know what you're thinking? paying to get priority seating? well you BETCHA and it was worth every penny. Basically I paid $25 to get the rewards card that is good at various restaurants Claim Jumper and Bubba Gump Shrimp to name a few of the other Vegas locations but with that intial fee you get a $25 credit towards your next meal but if youre savvy just download the App directly to your phone and register your card and boom you can save it instantly. Which I think is amazing because this place isn't CHEAP. That is why I am only giving it four stars... As much as I would love to give it five for the quality of food it just isn't a five star joint but my kids had a blast!   That club has a lot of other perks like a credit on your birthday and discounts on merchandise so if you're a big fan of dining out it is worth looking into. Now as far as the food goes I got this shrimp Jambalaya pasta that was really spicy but pretty delicious and I tried a bit of my Mom's Chinese chicken salad. They give HUGE portions so come prepared to EAT or get a doggie bag to take home. My kids were able to get these giant Icees and yummy food they both devoured so overall it was a good time. The view is great and the fish tanks and thunderstorm are fun.

To be honest, I never had the chance to check it out and the only reason I did was because almost every place was too packed to get seating to eat. I opted for the bar and got a pasta dish.  Before I even ordered, it was a little alarming that the chef had to come out to explain to a customer why the dish he served was off. Knowing I was short on time, I opted for a pesto pasta and chicken dish.

Normally, I am a huge fan of pesto & pasta but the mediocrity of the $20 pasta plate I got was a really mood killer. I could honestly have made a better dish with $3 and the amount of time (~25 minutes) it took for them to serve my dish.

This wasn't our first choice, we came here out on a limb, because the restaurant we went to needed a reservation in order for us to get a good seat.  Not willing to splurge with the no view seating, we left.  After we overextended ourselves on the strip, we had no option but this, and it was late, so we had to make this our last stop.

The food was surprisingly good, but the service was very very spotty, I got my tomato basil soup with no spoon, lol.  But the good soup saved my chagrin.  The cheese pizza was good also, too big to finish.  The chicken and beef fajita was decent too,  and the burger (with a fancy name) must be passable because it was all eaten.  In the end, the chef saved the day,  so pls give the overworked chef a raise. 

The noise in this restaurant was very high!  It's cute for the first half hour, then it got to be bothersome, and then all I wanted was to get the heck out of there.

The negatives:
1. They sat us by the fountain, which you would think would be cool. However, it was like sitting it was sprinkling the entire time. Our food got wet. We got wet. And it's loud, so you have to talk very loud. 

2. Our waiter was horrible. I know it was the end of his shift, and he was probably tired, but he didn't refill our drinks once and let our food sit until it was cold to bring it to us. He also introduced himself and started talking to us during their ""thunderstorm"", so we didn't hear a word he said.

3. It took over 30 minutes to get our food. I'm not sure where the fault lays here, but there were maybe 10 people total in the restaurant while we were there. And some already had food or were leaving. It wasn't busy. Not sure why a burger and a wrap took over 30 minutes to get to our table. 

4. The food was bad. As I already state, it was cold. It did, however, come out on a very hot plate. I got a burger, which was cold and had a very hard bun. Hard like I could hardly bite through it. The fries were cold and not very good. My husband got coleslaw with his meal, which came out warm. Weird, since that was actually supposed to be cold! Nothing had flavor, even the guacamole. It all tasted like cardboard.

5. The price. I paid as much for my burger as I did at Gordon Ramsay's burGR. They don't even compare. If I'm going to spend that much on a burger, it should be good, or at least warm. We ended up spending $50 on two meals with no drinks (we had water). Horrifying.

I will give this place a 2.5 star overall rating. 

I will say that I absolutely loved the Rainforest Cafe theme. I mean they simulate a tropical storm and it has fictitious animals that move and I believe talk and make noise (A cool place to keep kids entertain). I felt this place was a lot different from the other restaurants my wife and I visited in Vegas.

The waitress was ok....she wasn't bad but wasn't great either. At times she would disappear for a duration of time before we would see her again. 

So after we finally found and flagged her down we put in our drink and food orders. Here is where things started to go downhill.

After waiting about 30-45 minutes, only filling our stomachs with drinks we began looking around at other tables. Immediately we realized that people who was in the restaurant well before us were just starting to receive their meals. We knew it right there that the kitchen was backed up and it was going to be a long night (1 star demotion).

However, we sat and waited patiently, and after waiting another 45 minutes or an hour (Could of been longer but I was so hungry that I was doing whatever I could to take my mind off the super late food and the time) our waitress finally brought out our food.

I ordered the ""Tastes of the Islands"" and when my meal is presented to me I immediately say to the waitress, ""I know I ordered this an hour ago, but I'm pretty sure this meal was suppose to come with scallops"" (These fools had fries on my plate). But I'm not done yet because not only did they mess that up but my wife's food was cold and when I finally took a bite of my food it was cold as well (2 star demotion). So they make the correction on the scallops which was the only hot item we had (Should of had that the first time) and that wasn't bad.

Finally we talked with the manager and he tells us that he'll comp our entire meal, thus the reason I gave them the half a star increase in my overall rating.

Hey, I'm not saying not to go to this place. Maybe my wife and I just had bad luck this time around. Your luck might be better and the kitchen might not be running behind.

Its really loud in there and every 10 minutes or so they have a ""rain storm"" and the fake animals  move and make noise. Its really fun for the kids! It was REALLY expensive for what it is, so I don't think we will come back.

5466089,2010-06-28,3,0QHMAUi6NdOUZ1ckXq0-sA,"I was completely set on giving this place 4 stars until the final few minutes of my experience.  Why?  The only thing truly ""wild"" here is the pricing.

I like the Rainforest Cafe, and have for over 10 years.  But then, I like theme restaurants (I miss thee, Star Trek) because it's goofy and fun to have some crazy atmosphere you normally wouldn't experience in a vast majority of regular dining experiences.  That, and I'm a sucker for their ""Mojo Bones"" (ribs), and their pun name filled alcoholic beverages.

I liked the atmosphere (always love the fish and the rainstorms), the service was polite and friendly and very casual.  Good job all around for our waitress.  The food was good.  Their tomato basil soup is excellent, and I had a pleasant dining experience by their waterfall.  I even had some of my food to go, because it was a respectable (and large) selection of an appetizer, soup, a drink, and my main entree.  For two.

And then the meal came to an end.

This is admittedly where I get ""cheap"".  Rainforest Cafe used to be reasonably priced, and while I noticed the prices were slowly climbing (but still reasonable), the prices were actually uncomfortable this time, so my lady and I tried to be careful in what we ordered.  By the time we got out plus tip, it was over $100+.  For two people.  In a chain restaurant designed primarily for families and children.  We didn't even get dessert.  Thank God, as I may have had to take out a loan.

I honestly don't mind paying that amount of money for one of the exclusive restaurants on the Strip, but those are always intended as ""special occasion"" restaurants that are pre-planned for birthdays or some big event.  I wasn't expecting Rainforest Cafe to gouge me (especially in this economy), and it left a bad taste in my mouth in what was an otherwise good dining experience.

I always enjoyed going to the Rainforest Cafe, and now I'm going to have to second guess doing it anymore.  I'd rather spend the $100+ on a quality steak or sushi from some featured chef in a fancy dining experience where I can dress up and impress the heck out of my lady for being so ""romantic"", than a restaurant you can find in most states around the country, and the standard dress is shorts and flip flops.

When we walked in, I noticed the restaurant was surprisingly empty, and we had zero wait time to get a table.  I thought we had good luck in picking a quiet time.  I'm starting to think that's not the case for our quick seating anymore.  I'd hate to be a family of four.

Unless the restaurant is trying to sabotage itself into a close-down in the near future, it seriously needs to reconsider its pricing structure.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,4,3,3,lYQqMK5sHf_G7KD8rpva-w

You are about to read about all of the above. The in-laws came into town last night and wanted to go to the strip tonight and since we had our daughter with us they decided on the Rainforest Cafe for Dinner. We walked up to the counter and the the older gentleman working the desk looked at us and counted us on his fingers and I think he was about to pull his shoes off and start counting toes, Keep in mind there was 4 and a baby..... As we stand there we can count 8 open tables and we are the only people waiting for a table. The guy then tells us that the wait will be 10 to 15 minutes. For what, I could not tell you, so while waiting we let our daughter stair at the fish tanks near the entrance until she was tired of making the fishy face and tormenting the fish by tapping on the glass. Finally they came to tell us that they had a table for us. We then walk to our table that has absolutely no view of any of the animaltronics. Don't get me wrong, I know that we were not really visiting a Rain Forest and the teenagers in Steve Erwin's hand me downs are not real guides but the last time I ate a Rainforest cafe they attempted to seat families with children near the animals and scenery. Ten minutes or so after being seated the waitress approached our table and the first thing she asked was, ""so were are you all from?"" As soon as we said Vegas, she may as well have taken off the safari hat and moved onto another jungle because that was almost the last time we saw her, I don't know were that attitude comes from because honestly, being from here I would probably tip her better than a out of town-er since I am not there to scimp on my meal to save money for a Leaning tower of margarita or the spin to win penny slots. I read the menu and realized that they give you lays potato chips with your $14 BBQ Chicken Wrap.. What the hell is that about? Excuse me Safari guide did you just say $2.49 extra for french fries? To make this extremely long rant a little shorter, i will say between the 4 adults and 1 child we spent $7.50 to add fries, got $5.00 worth, also at some point our ""guide"" fell off the safari truck and somehow made it back on at the end of the long dusty non animal existent ride just when it was time to collect the $80 for this ridiculous experience.. I was pretty irritated and could have put on my own Gorilla pounding on the chest show by the time we left. I would rather of went to the McDonald's on the strip and watched the Herds of Human cattle and had a much better meal and sat right under the arches.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,0,0,1,dj5pUEG-SSww6H0y0Kd8gQ

After all, you can't really have high culinary aspirations on any place that has a animatronic elephants and gorillas, can you? We only picked this place because I worked at the one in Denver when I was a kid, and it was the worst place I ever worked (in how they treated the employees). Also, they never let us try the food, so I have been curious all these years why someone would wait hours in line to pay $20 for crappy pot roast just to eat in a fake rain forest.

I had the Rasta Pasta, which is basically a pasta primavera. It was OK, but it needed a bit more refinement in seasoning (ie, some seasoning) and a few more vegetables. I also had a Mai Tai, which was pretty strong for a children's restaurant, but I wasn't with kids, so... woo hoo.

The environment is not for anyone with a documented anxiety or seizure disorder. About every 1/2 hour, there is a tropical storm there the animatronic animals make lots of noise and there are lightening flashes.

omg, huge fucking mistake. wow, the service here SUCKS MASSIVE ASS!!! we stood there for a good few minutes to be seated [it was NOT crowded by any stretch] then after we were seated?? it took our ""waitress"" a good FIFTEEN MINUTES to even haul her ass to our table for our DRINKS ORDER. with three well-behaved but young boys, time is of the essence. they are hungry and thirsty! shit, so were we! 

by the time our ""waitress"" came over we had decided on what we wanted to eat so she took both our food and drinks order at that time. she forgot the lemon for my BFF's iced tea. then...we got our food. the food is good, i'll give you that. it was hot and excepting the No Onions on my Bacon Cheeseburger, Please not being remembered, it was fucking tasty. and we were still waiting on the lemon. she finally brought it after a good 5 minutes.

then we noticed the disgusting ""something"" on the INSIDE of her glass of tea. WAITRESS, OH WAITRESS??? in the good 10-15 minutes we spent vainly searching for her...me and the BFF shared my Coke. our ""waitress"" showed back up and i requested a new drink for my friend. who, by the way, had to nurse her son at the table because they don't provide any sort of privacy, quiet place or family restroom for her to do so. we don't give a shit if a boob is out so she just fed her littlest one while we ate and WAITED AN ETERNITY! at least when she brought out the new iced tea, it had the lemon in it already so we didn't have to AGAIN remind her.

so we ate our ridiculously overpriced lunches and enjoyed the cheesy ""show"" they put on. we saw it. FIVE TIMES. 

the kicker for it all? we waited TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES for her to even bother to come back over to our table again. by then, we were waiting on the check. i requested a Sprite for her middle son, a to-go box for the other half of my burger and the check. then another 10 minutes went back. she practically RAN from the fucking table before i could give her my credit card.

i'm a bitch. i gave that useless ""waitress"" a $2 tip. then i told off the manager. what pisses me off more than everything else is that i would have given her a sweet $20 tip for decent service. i'm not overly picky but i like to at least see my waitress. it wasn't even remotely busy or crowded!!! the manager was nice but didn't offer to remove the iced tea off the bill or offer any sort of compensation. i wasn't going to ask since i don't roll like that.

but this place was a total fucking disappointment. we went and cooed at the lions, Belladonna and Gino, in the Lion Habitat and that cheered me up.

Even if you decide to pass on eating here, the gift shop outside of it was so fun for my little boy, we all ended up getting something.",ZuWAof5l6yKeft-F1QCWSQ,2,1,5,K6qjKXq8c2JTl_VrM8biJQ

The atmosphere is cute, as everyone has said and my server was friendly and efficient. Those were the only good things about the experience though. I ordered a patron margarita and when the waiter brought it it looked like a glass of water. Unfortunately, it tasted like one too. I don't like to send things back, but this was the worst margarita I have ever had and for $14+ I had to send it back. Then came my salad. It was some kind of a chinese chicken salad. The flavor would've been pretty good if they hadn't put so many crunchy noodles in it. Those were the only thing that I could taste. This isn't a restaurant that I will be returning to.",rsQ8-0wabCe0IsB55gnwtA,0,1,2,bVj56KxK9n9Ylx94753omA
5841297,2008-08-15,0,0QHMAUi6NdOUZ1ckXq0-sA,"Food: Food is not bad but nothing special. I had the Planet Earth Pasta which was basically sliced sausage, penne, and marinara sauce. I just so happened to be craving pasta that day so I didn't care for ordering a more fancy dish. The chicken quesedillas were also good ad were free (thanks for a free appetizer coupon I found in one of those Vegas mags). 

Price: About $18 and up for most entree dishes or around $15 or so for burgers, etc. Good portion for price. 

Service: Our waiter was friendly and our food came out fast. This is a family/kids restaurant so I can understand the fun and outgoing attitudes of most of the servers, however the host in the front had major attitude and looked like she needed help on managing the incoming diners. 

Atmosphere: Its loud in here, lots of random rainforest noises. There was a storm halfway into our dinner and there were servers randomly yelling out ""Volcano!"" everytime someone ordered their Volcano ice cream dessert. I wouldn't normally choose to dine at a place like this while in Vegas but I had a coupon on the restaurant was right near our show theatre so I figrued this time I'd let it slide...

Took forever to even get our starter salads, at least thirty minutes. Then after finally getting our food, the waiter had gotten all of our side orders wrong. On top of all of that, the coconut shrimp I ordered was fine nothing special but the ""mango salsa"" it was served with is brown and tasted more like a bbq sauce.

Kid opinion: The big snake hanging down in the gift shop is cool.  The rain falling down and the fake thunderstorms and sparkling stars and atmosphere is neat.  And the desert with sparklers is awesome!

Adult side: The food is blah.  The alcoholic beverages were boring or too sweet.

The decor has a jungle feel with moving toy animals and animal sounds going off at odd times.  It has a very playful look that I wouldn't have thought it was a legit cafe from afar.  Thinking the cafe was more about its foresty antics, I sat down with low expectations.

Service was slow but I didn't mind this time as I was with a good sized group and we enjoyed our conversation.  If I was in a rush, the slowness would've been an issue.

I ordered the chicken & ribs combo.  It arrived and looked dry.  Neither the chicken nor the ribs looked appetizing but I was hungry!  To my surprise, both passed the taste test!  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The ribs, while it looked dry, was tender and fell off the bone.  While my wallet was hurting in Vegas, my tummy was happy this night!

Would I eat here again?  I'm not opposed to returning, but I will always opt for a new restaurant whenever traveling (Bachi Burger is one of my few exceptions...)",vNqJm3mlYnqxFrLBi_NViQ,5,4,4,SAID91SmzQJ2dFigsPZDYQ

I recall going to my first one in Illinois at the age of 13 and thinking it was the coolest.place.EVER. Of course, our standards change as we continue to be exposed to new places, people, and flavors...

So while we were in Vegas, I decided to take my best friend to the ""Rainforest Cafe"" at MGM. We tasted their:
* CHIMI-CHA-CHA
* CHEESE STICKS
* COASTAL CALAMARI 
* LOBSTER DIP
* RAINFOREST-CAFE THEMED MARGARITA-ESQUE DRINKS

The coastal calamari was like rubber, the cheese sticks chewy, the chimi-cha-cha mediocre at best and had a strange slightly bitter aftertaste. The lobster dip's a hard one to screw up with respect to taste - it's mostly cheese, with little bits of lobster mixed in. The margarita-esque drinks were HUGE, strong, and sweet. They weren't bad, but I was pretty much indifferent to them.

I learned a long time ago that you don't go to a Rainforest Cafe for the food. You go for the fun interior when you've got 1.) visitors who've never been & don't have one near them or 2.) kids to entertain. 

What about the 150% more you're paying than if you went to that other place? Consider it an admission fee.

NOTE: I grant them 2* because once you've outgrown the OMG-like-whoa interior, what you prioritize is the food.",BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg,6,5,2,OrclHJk9I1stey8pHheKkQ

Food:
guacamole burger- hecka thick meat that i had to take most of it off. I wished there was more guac. The side of coleslaw tasted light and not as flavorful.
regular burger- same as guac burger except no guac.
chicken alfredo- my friend seemed to like it a lot b/c she ate most of it.

Drinks- we ordered 3 drinks, but they are weak as hell. Not worth it if you are looking to be buzzed. My drink even had Bacardi 151,but still nothing. I just felt relaxed and sleepy.

The wait was a bit long each time we've went.  The service was fine each time though, and the restaurant appeared clean.  The ambiance is pretty cool.  It has that nice rainforest atmosphere, and you can even hear the sounds of the animals of the rainforest.  The kids loved it.

The food is decent.  Nothing stood out taste or quality wise so I will not recommend any dish.  Hopefully, you will try something you like.

I do not know If I'd go back to this location again.  There are so many other more options in Las Vegas to try.  I would probably only go back again if the kids wanted to.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,0,0,3,XdBXoWGSCkf2tB5tIVvM4g
