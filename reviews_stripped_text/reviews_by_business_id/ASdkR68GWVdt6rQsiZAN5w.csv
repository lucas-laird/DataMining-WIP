430234,2012-11-15,0,ASdkR68GWVdt6rQsiZAN5w,Just tried this place for the first time and I love it! Xavier the owner is wonderful and truly passionate about raw eating. He's so eager to educate each customer that comes in. I love that he lets you sample everything before you decide what you want and if you're eating there he doesn't make you pay until you're done eating. The prices may be higher than some like but it's not whole foods bad. Highly recommend the mock chicken wraps and zucchini wraps :),m9w6Km8xJKKx773NaiKQ0w,2,0,5,h8amwauQPfBRMCNjK69Jrw

659966,2013-03-12,2,ASdkR68GWVdt6rQsiZAN5w,"Not Raw, and not Express! The name raw food express is everything this place isn't. The only thing express about it, is that it is expressly slow, and they are expressly dishonest! Raw this place is not! Everyone is raving about Xavier. Sure he is nice to your face, and that is because he is lying to it! Xavier flat out lied to my face about the ingredients in the food. My Ice tea tasted horrible, like chemical store bought processed sugar crap!!!! Crap that I don't drink, for various reasons...blood sugar issues being just one of them. Xavier said the tea was made with lime juice, cinnamon, and hibiscus. The real truth is that it is colored Fresh and Easy Limeade...possibly colored with hibiscus...but I doubt that at this point. We saw them bring in at least 20 bottles of the limeade from the store. We asked Xavier multiple times if it was store bought limeade in the tea, he kept insisting it was fresh squeezed. (This is while we were watching the girl put the limeade in the fridge) He went on to brag about he was creating his own line of teas. We kept insisting that lime juice is not sweet like he was telling us. He just insisted that that is why his line of teas was the best because he ""could do things that others couldn't do"". I believe that ""thing"" is called ""lie"". Or maybe that ""thing"" was buy some Crystal Light and mix it with some limeade. I could do that at home if I wanted to, but I wouldn't because that is NOT HEALTHY!!!!!!!!!!

I don't believe that Xavier eats raw food, or even healthy in general.  If  he did, he would understand why people care about what goes in their bodies and would not lie to them about it. He told one customer that he doesn't eat vegetables, that's why he blends them. What healthy person doesn't eat vegetables??!!!!!!!!! I would not trust the smoothies from this place any way. Probably made from Kool Aid, and canned vegetables or something.

They also don't make the food they sell there. I'm not sure if Chef Sharon makes anything, and if she does, she doesn't make it there. Why else was there a chef there that was talking to xavier about bringing food in to sell? He was clearly not familiar with the raw food concepts. 

I had to drive way out of the way to give this place a chance. I really wanted to support a small business, that was promoting health and raw food. I am very disappointed in this place, and very angry that I was lied to!",isW7amAjBerSwUc2VS0c5w,7,1,1,H9P3yPVe20pJqdcsfhrY6Q

I stopped by tonight to pick up some dinner on my way home from work. I am vegan and I'm always looking for easy ""on the way home"" options or just new restaurants where I can eat without worry.
Just like everyone has said, Xavier is awesome and took his time to explain everything they had made for the day. He also was very happy to have me sample an item I asked about. 
The atmosphere is very comfortable and clean, the location is great and everyone was very friendly.
I took home Zucchini wraps, Lebanese salad and Apple Sauce.  The zucchini wraps were so flavorful on their own...but with the dipping sauce they serve with it, they were amazing! The Lebanese salad was good, a simple chopped veggie bowl with garbanzo beans and a simple dressing. The Apple sauce....is to die for! I am an apple addict so I'm a little biased but this was a pure apple and cinnamon flavorful finish to my meal. 
I will definitely return to Raw Food Express!
I hope to see a more permanent fixed menu in the future that I could order from but I also liked the system of them making different dishes each day.

We noticed the sign also included ""Raw Food Express"" which intrigued us. After ordering, we decided we'd look this place up via Yelp to see the ratings and reviews. To our surprise, both were top notch! We both agreed that after our meal, we'd go check the place out and find something to order. We entered a few minutes shy of 7:00 and were immediately greeted by the manager, Xavier. He asked whether it was our first time, and was extremely informative and helpful in the selection process of what we should order or try. He offered us free samples of several of the treats they had-- the carob peanut butter macaroon was my absolute favorite! 

Being that we were stuffed from dinner, we settled for a hot green tea and chai tea, that Xavier had specially made to our liking. He had given us so much information about the business, the term ""raw,"" and product information. I felt bad because business hours were over and Xavier was still catering to every need or question that we had. He truly is one who is passionate about the Vegan lifestyle and his business. I can't wait to return! I plan to pay a visit on Friday night, as we were informed later hours.

After reviewing the menu online and having my mind set on the BlackJack 21 Salad, I drove a few blocks down to the Cafe. I was immediately greeted enthusiastically by Xavier and then Rosa took care of my order. When I realized how small the container for the salad was, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be satisfied. Rosa insisted that it may look small, but the various, nutritious contents will keep my stomach (and brain) happy. However, she also cheerfully gave me samples of a few other items if I wanted to try anything else, just in case. 

5 samples later...

Damn. I am definitely coming back for the tacos, mock chicken salad wraps, zucchini wraps, and the macaroons. I ended up taking home the Blackjack 21 and Labenese Salad, both delicious but I can't take my mind off of the taco sample Rosa slipped me...curses! I'll be back.

p.s. You can tell everyone here is very passionate about the raw food lifestyle. Xavier chatted a few customers up, including me, about his own weight loss experience (215lbs to 140lbs I believe he said) by cutting out animal products and including his WoRx smoothies in his diet, and the foundation of the food and philosophy of the place.

The not so cheesecake was amazing and the coconut pastry puffs were perfection!  
Unless you want what they already have in the fridge for that day, you can not go in and order anything off the menu.  You have to call in a day or two ahead and ask them to prepare the food for you.  
If you are looking for fresh, vegan and gluten free food this is a great place to go.  Just remember to call in before to see what they have or call in to order your food for the week.

I love Raw food express and I can't imagine how anyone could ever have anything bad to say about this place. I have been coming here for over a month now, pretty much on a daily basis. Xavier is awesome! very helpful and can answer any question you have regarding the food and ingredients. I don't believe anything here is ""pricey"" you are getting raw organic fresh ingredients, so yes, you can go to McDonald's and pay 5 dollars for a Big Mac,Fries and soda which has no nutritional benefit for you and you are basically putting chemicals and toxins in your body or you can pay 10 dollars for a plate of natural organic ingredients. Quality does cost more and is worth it if you care about what goes into your body. As far as the smoothies/juices there, the great thing about them is Xavier blends the whole foods in the vitamix blender rather than pulverizing and extracting them into a juice, which keeps them from oxidizing as quickly. Thus all the nutrition and fiber is retained and you can buy one and let it sit in your fridge for a few days.

I've grown up in a household that always has Tahini and Braggs Amino Acid on hand and took tabouleh to school for lunch, so this style of eating isn't foreign to me. What did surprise me was the lack of creativity.

With the raw movement being hugely popular over the last couple of years, I came expect that, by now, the food had gotten a little more.. refined, so to speak; a little more creative. What I found at Raw Food Express was simple, straightforward fare. 

I ordered the zucchini wraps which was about all they had left in the cooler for the day. It was about three thin slices of zucchini wrapped around a prettily diced medley of bell peppers, radish and cauliflower. This came with a coconut water, Braggs and Tahini dipping sauce. The wraps themselves were hard to eat as they were falling apart, but the cool crunchiness was welcome after braving the 105 degree weather outside. The sauce was unbalanced. It had a slight creaminess thanks to the Tahini, but mostly it just tasted of the Braggs- salty. For these three little wraps, I paid $10. Color me unimpressed.

The only truly redeeming factor of this place is Xavier, and it seems as though he's no secret. He'll take his time with you and explain everything, making you feel very comfortable. He's fantastic!

Unfortunately, the overall experience was somewhat disappointing as those wraps were something I would have thought to make at home and I was hoping that someone who specializes in eating as a raw vegan everyday would have surprised me with their creativity. Not so. Still, it wasn't terrible. Maybe I'll have to try one of the smoothies, so I don't end up going across the street to satiate my appetite next time.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,5,1,3,qrCMv3bFogmYtN1xxLgvUw

I used to come here a lot when my co-workers signed up for a juicing cleanse package they offered.

This is why I don't understand their prices. If you aren't buying organic and non-GMO, why are your prices so high? I could go to Whole Foods and get a custom juice for the same price that IS organic and non-GMO. I'm not going to get into a cost vs health debate here, but I bring this up because I was also told someone that worked here that organic and non-GMO weren't essential to a juice cleanse. Any of the foremost authorities on juicing for health will tell you different: Gerson, Wahls, etc.

This little gem of a place is easy to miss plus the storefront sign is about coffee, and since I don't drink coffee I didn't pay attention. But suddenly on the door appeared recently in tiny letters Raw Food Express. The ""raw"" word is what immediately got my attention. 

The atmosphere is very laid back, clean, comfortable, relaxing. They have jazz music lightly playing in the background, and there is free wi-fi and even a couple of laptops that are available for customers to use. 

Xavier...what isn't to like about him?? He immediately greeted me with a smile and introduced himself, very polite and informative. He told me all about the food and the smoothies, and gave me some samples of whatever I wanted to try.

Everything is made to order - and you can fax your order in ahead of time to avoid a wait. I sampled the raw zucchini lasagna (AMAZINGLY flavorful), raw seasoned spicy almonds, and raw fire sun-dried tomato chips. Yum. Yum. YUMMMM!!! SOLD!!!!

I ordered the raw zucchini lasagna and the raw mock chicken salad wraps to go. The mock chicken salad wraps are very interesting... lots of texture and flavor, and sunflower seeds, mmm mmm. I can't really describe what they tasted like but they were not messy at all. I inhaled all three of them in less than 5 minutes. 

Other items on their made to order menu include kale salad, lebanese-style layered salad, raw zucchini pasta marinara, artichoke-spinach hummus, raw Spanish gazpacho, raw ""no cheese"" cheesecake..I could go on and on...

I am totally supporting this local business- nice people, quality, flavorful healthy food...great atmosphere. The small portions are all around $8, large portions $11-12 but you are paying for the quality, worth every penny.

Their were so many options and i really wanted a coffee drink, but passed since i'm trying to whiten my teeth. I asked him just to make me something good, so he made the same drink for me as the lady before and i'm glad he did! Filled with veggies and fruit including califlower and zucchini! Two veggies i usually can't stand!!! I told them my mama would be proud of me for finally eating my veggies! It was deliciousness in a cup ;) Will definitely stop by again when i'm on that side of town!",LRJyK0J_flQe4p5C9mOawA,0,0,5,LsqgMHOAQh2fN4Vj7rsbBQ

I have to say that the food was full of flavor. I tried this desert of somesort it had nuts in it. I tried the hummus and I have never had hummus before so I was kind of scared.... but it was delicous. Like I just wanted to keep eating and eating. 

Next time if I can I will try 1 of everything.. lol jp

I would highly reccomend this place if you just want a snack or something new to try..

The curried chickpea salad and broccoli and mushroom salad were wonderful; savory and full of flavor. I had the peanut and coconut macaroons for dessert, and I had to resist the temptation to get a dozen of them boxed up to take home. They also have various juice tonics which I wi have to try in the future.",AZRNbyN7O_VtsfazanT0BA,0,0,5,zQBFHwEFU5IIVONAxvy3ZA
4989837,2014-08-29,4,ASdkR68GWVdt6rQsiZAN5w,"I love raw, organic, non GMO food and am constantly only on the hunt for a good place.  However, several things turned me off about this place.  So much so that I will never go back.  I hate giving one star to a place that is not a chain... so I'll just state my experience and let everyone else decide.

First, the attitude of the owner was too intense for lunch and inappropriate.  She sat with us (yep, at our table) nearly the entire time and lectured us about food and how to take care of ourselves.  By the way, I did not seek this advice and I only had an hour for my lunch break.  However, I was polite and entertained her and took her advice, but after 15-20 mins it was no longer welcome.  She stated that people that come to her restaurant are here because they need help.  She was abrasive and pushy with her tone and comments.  I told her we only came for the food, but she insisted that people come because they need guidance. 

She continued to preach and offer advice (on what you needed to consume and even how many bowel movements you should have), so I told her that she should consider changing the name of her place because Express doesn't reflect what her business style was.  She wants a business where she can coach and help others.  As several other yelpers mentioned, she wants you to sample things so you can get a taste for her food, but it is not fast service.  The word express is not reflective of her business at all.  While you're there she tries to lecture you and push her knowledge on you.  Since I love learning I listened, but when I questioned anything (as someone who's studied medicine and nutrition for years would) she was not receptive to my responses.  (Which was actually quite shocking... I felt her rolling her eyes at me)  

I think she was very nice when I was just listening, but once I started asked questions (especially about the ingredients in the juice) she because very defense and slightly rude.

We spent over $40 on a meal for 2.  And more when we ordered the hummus. In my opinion price point is too high, but that wouldn't keep me from coming back if I thought it was worth it.  

The hummus was ok, but not memorable.  Honestly, I prefer the raw hummus at Whole Foods.  Her desserts were yummy, I will give her credit for that.  

Overall, the food was decent, but I am did not like the taste of the juice.  Note:  Its not a raw juice, its an elixir loaded with vitamins and minerals.  The elixir or juice that she has does not say organic and it packed with loads of nutrients that I don't know are necessary for most people to consume.  Its also hard to determine if there can be negative side effects when everything combined.  There isn't an FDA approval system that I know of for supplements, so I stay cautious with them.  Plus, I felt terrible after drinking it so I'll let my body decide on this one.  I believe in raw food, but I wouldn't be comfortable drinking the elixir or juice ever again.  

It took me a while to write this review because I wanted to separate my experience from the taste of the food. I don't know if I fully can, but I've never had a craving for the food (not even the dessert)  This isn't a place that I can recommend.",W5UE4LllnPipYa0470mIwA,11,3,2,fUfmYN-acb-eC5D2t8HIyg

One of them enthusiastically explained to us all of the different ingredients and health benefits/uses for their ""elixirs"" and let us sample all of them. They all tasted like really flavorful juice and were DELICIOUS. You could slightly taste the vitamins as an aftertaste, but my friend and I really didn't mind (according to the owner, they had 100-something different fruits & vegetables and a ton of different vitamins inside). You can mix them any way you want to suit your health needs OR what simply tastes good to you. A refreshing 12oz drink was $6.

I didn't get any food, but I read the menu which looks pretty delicious (ALL VEGAN!). Most importantly, it seems like everything is super affordable. Definitely gotta go back to try the menu.",90Go9OZhKs-5jpagYY8N3Q,0,0,5,eLbHBELCHx5OZu1Yq7QK-w

I like the chickpea salad & broccoli stirfry. Cant forget to get dessert the macroons are delish. We need places like this everywhere! And in my opinion its not overpriced at all.

This Chef actually wanted to debate with me about O R G A N I C foods.  I walked in and I had 1 simple question.   Do you use O R G A N I C ingredients at all? This was my first and last time I will ever set foot in that place.  He was very cocky and full of pride as he pointed to a machine on the shelf above him... he washes away all the pesticides,  said that he ONLY USES  CONVENTIONAL ingredients and doesn't believe in anything  O R G A N I C.  He was very rude.  He talked over me as I explained that conventional vegetables and fruits, etc. have been modified with DNA that modifies DNA in our bodies... didn't even let me finish, instead he continued his speech that it is washed away...

I had the Mexican wrap and Lebanese salad and the macaroon that came with all for $10. I really enjoyed the salad and macaroon not so much the wrap but I will definitely be back.

I had asked about explanations of the reasons they choose their ingredients but they were all rather vague promoting this whole idea that acidic foods will really mess you up.. When entirely your blood pH never changes that often.
I believe they got the idea right just, their reasoning could use more accurate detailed answers. ( I am a Medical Laboratory Technician )

But yes the important thing is the food! There is no meat, I have no problems with that anyways.

I'm surprised at how filled I was from their mock chicken. I thought I had to buy 2 plates the first plate filled me, the last plate I had to force down.

To get an idea of the cost.. For 2 plates and the smoothie it was 28 with tax.

I appreciate how much fiber and flavor the food had.
Along with their fresh juice, I sorta wish they made it on the spot instead of refrigerated to get me more nutritional value out of it.

Overall, I like the place its nice, clean, Fast, and healthy. You can pig out with guilt. Lol

Important tip is they open at Noon!!! Grr",YD58b0ZxmB6a2pdX4yjziw,4,1,4,X7zFXSULI8ZOC2NrVlNSZw
5574368,2013-06-27,2,ASdkR68GWVdt6rQsiZAN5w,"Food here is ehhh. But the prepackaged food also kinda irked me. I'd rather see the chef prepare it or set my plate after I order it. Out of all the things I tried (sampled: kale salad, chipotle taco, crab cakes, bought: mock chicken wraps, and zucchini wrapped hummus) I only enjoyed the chipotle taco.

the items are really small for the price, and mainly just doesnt taste that good. 

Like your mock chicken and crab should taste something like the meat its pretending to be right?

I was brought here with a local who recently found this gem and wanted to fix me up since I'm suffering from a random cold.

Whats up doc, jamaican hibiscus tea and berry citrus greens mixed up together... I highly recommend!

Lots of health benefits with anything you walk out with from here.

Cute couple running the business and very informative. 

$6 for what I like to call ""a fix me up in a cup"" :)

If you're into eating clean and healthy... this spot is for you!

I think it's one of the best raw food friendly eateries in the valley.
Generally they will offer you a free sample of anything before you buy! That shows they stand behind their food, as they should.

They also have a little shop with a few things to buy.",-rW_Q9pknwudToXWfRNZsg,3,3,5,ugfMvBzDvk2L2oXGV4roIA
