He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.

I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.

Tia Pueblo Taco Shop is located on Decatur and Lake Mead right behind Subway. It's a small mom and pop type of place. The selection is plentiful and we absolutely LOVED the food. My husband ordered the chili relleno combination (two chili rellenos, rice, tortillas, and beans) and I had the chili relleno, enchilada, and taco combination. Soooooo much delicious food! There was so much on my plate that I had to ask for a to go container to bring home my leftovers! The price of our meals plus two large soft drinks was very reasonable -- about $27.

1783816,2017-04-07,0,OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,"This is the real deal, for sure. Hubby was over-the-moon happy that we tried this little place as he is very finicky about certain types of Mexican food, especially tacos al pastor.  Those three tacos, filled with achiote-red and adobo marinated pork bites, topped with fresh chopped onion and cilantro, were so delicious and made him a bonafide fan of Mi Pueblo.

Ay, caramba!  It was good stuff.  We also pigged out on two combos, with the refried beans, queso, chips, and rice.  One being the chiles rellenos and the other (my new favorite) puercos verde.  Both meals were very satisfying, but that pork with the green sauce had crunchy, roasted pieces of pork, with a light, citrusy green pepper base. I really wasn't very hungry, but enjoyed the flavor adventure so much, I totally devoured that dish.

The lady at the counter is so sweet and so is the chef (owner?)--they both checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. Now, again as others have pointed out, it's a small hole-in-the-wall--but don't let that stop you from dining in. There are a couple big screens so you can watch Telemundo or whatever happens to be on. There is a fresh salsa cart, where you can help yourself to the salsa rojo or pico de gallo.

Also, just want to mention that although it's not located in a ""high-end"" neighborhood shopping center, we were certainly glad we stopped in.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,3,0,5,xLFrMWnkPqjyV0m933bP_w

3519783,2017-06-20,42,OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,"We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. 

I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.

Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. 

Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. 

Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,67,68,4,Oxz26pqpIb7dDVeuUzNZlg

3768221,2017-07-15,1,OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,"TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card payment

I was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. 

Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. 

I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. 

While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. 

My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,2,0,2,sG2U7rH5NSTYR3-DumVT7w

I was craving tacos dorados which I don't think is on the menu ( my husband ordered in Spanish an I got lost in translation) the tortillas were light and freshly fried, meat was juicy and flavorful, really hit the spot 

We also had cheese enchiladas with beans and rice and my husband and I loved it! He's kind of a bean snob, and he really liked their beans which is rare. He's from Mexico and when he says something tastes like his mom made it, it's a good sign we'll be back! We've been back twice now :)

I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco!
