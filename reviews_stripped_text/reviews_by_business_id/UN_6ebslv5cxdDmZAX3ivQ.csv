13109,2014-03-15,4,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"As a serious Hookah lover and a local, I frequent many of the hookah lounges here in the city. I have never walked into a hookah lounge and walked back out as quickly as I did. I didn't even check in! Walking into this hidden flop around 1:00 am, the first thing I noticed was the place looked very unkept and mundane. There were a scattered few people just sitting there and staring into oblivion, no conversations, no dancing, no lively entertainment., no fun. The most OUTRAGEOUS thing I couldn't help to block out was the overly obnoxious and extremely loud music that the ""DJ"" was playing. In such a small place, there should never be music as loud as this was. This is not a concert venue, but a hookah lounge where there is supposed to be a relaxing mellow vibe. I couldn't even communicate with the waitress with what I wanted and she couldn't as well. My group and I started off at our table with a few waters and continuously struggled with the idea of actually staying here for a round of hookah. We were served Voss water without having the choice of tap. What if I didn't want to pay 12 dollars for a pretentious bottle of water? I didn't even want to experience the possible disappointment of a shisha sesh. The mood was so desolate and lifeless with horrible, ear-piercing ""music,"" we had to leave, STAT! 

Hookah has caught on to be a trendy aspect in the nightlife of Las Vegas over the past decade and I get the idea of said places trying to transcend the competitive idea of what a true hookah lounge is supposed to be. I don't know about you, but this is not what a hookah lounge should consist of. Personally, these lounges should forever be evolving, innovative but still remain true to this incredible Middle Eastern tradition. Luna is lost, if not dead. They have some major improvements if they ever want to see there business evolving positively. 

I've been past Luna many a time because of my insatiable hunger for the incredible tacos at Tacos El'gordo and I've always wondered what that eerie structure in the back was with an empty parking lot??   

Oh.....a place I will never go back to again.",8nAchwrSfEKafmFnAehCGg,7,2,1,gWzQzoQg22_YboKGZ8yvxA

Lunalasvegas.com, which is their website, has a flyer that says 6+ ladies get free bottle and hookah.  So when I ask about the bottle and mixers, I asked about the hookah and they told me no hookah.  I explained to the waitress that on the website it says free hookah.. she goes and get the owner, and at this time I have the flyer up on my phone.  I show the owner the flyer, he walks away and then comes back with his phone showing me a Facebook page with a ""new"" flyer (which when you go on the Facebook page and scroll alllllll the way to August it doesn't have the ""hookah"" listed BUT when they captioned, it says COMP HOOKAH"" that only says free bottle. I tells him that I didn't reference to Facebook, I went to their actual site where the flyer was (events).  He goes on to basically tell me that he wasn't honoring the hookah even though it was on the site... We ended having to pay for it, which wasn't a problem, it was just the principle of the fact when you advertise something, that's usually what's expected. The venue itself was nice layout, the hookah was good, just disappointed on how business was conducted.  He could of honored it or even gave a discount, but to tell us straight out NO was rude and unprofessional. And FYI, the flyer is STILL there and I advised him to update asap because he doesn't want to have this encounter again.. it may have been minor but someone will make a major deal out of it",5QPgZXTWDeiy2-lc4zxyLQ,5,0,2,8ls_nsWt7uNM8VsNehRkLQ

367998,2016-07-09,0,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"The hookah was great. That was the only good thing about my visit. Their hours state they open at 2pm during the week. My party and 2 other separate parties showed up exactly at 2pm and they told us they weren't open. When we all said that the website lists an opening time of 2pm, they then said that they were open but weren't ready for customers because they'd just gotten new tables that needed to be moved. (Sidebar: I noted the dirty tables and it was clear to me that they weren't new. And the fact that I see older reviews with pictures of those same ""new"" tables...lets me further know that I was correct in my original assessment. So I call b.s. on that excuse.) Well that is not my issue. I'm sure they weren't ready because they aren't accustomed to having customers in the afternoon on a weekday. But I work in the industry and know it well. You can never gauge what your customers will do so you have to be prepared for all possible scenarios. That means they should have had the restaurant ready for service 15 minutes before opening time, not still trying to set up at the time that you open. Failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. But I digress. So after 15-20 minutes, they finally let us sit down. Then we wait. We had to wait for water. We had to wait for someone to take the order which was just the hummus trio, teapot, and hookah. We had to wait for the trio which was just a duo of regular hummus and garlic hummus. (Sidebar: I'm a chef. I worked in a Mediterranean restaurant for some time. I know for a fact that a proper hummus cannot be made without garlic. So they gave me garlic hummus and garlic-garlic hummus. That's like giving me a regular coffee and a coffee with caffeine. I would have respected them more if they'd said we only have regular hummus right now. Don't try to pull an okie doke by making up a menu item since you think I won't know any better.) We waited forever for the hookah...about 45 minutes total. We kept asking for the manager to come out and he never would. After the 4th time he finally came and that was when we discovered that our apathetic, nonchalant. unapologetic waiter was actually the manager meaning that nothing was going to be resolved. If the waiter who doubles as a manager doesn't care about the customer then the other employees certainly won't...ergo why they didn't care about rushing to let us sit down at 2pm when they restaurant opened. The hookah was quality but it's not enough to warrant me going back and dealing with slow service and indifference to the customer's satisfaction.",lR8xlI39O1V6Vionsv30Eg,0,0,2,VQ4XtXQXPXu_Ib4ooay3xg

We asked for an ice tip and instead they put ice cubes in the tray. When getting our smoke on me and my man like to snuggle close...who doesn't? Impossible at Luna Lounge. Instead of the comfy couches usually seen in these types of establishments, they had uncomfortable individual chairs. My man is only 6' tall but his legs were cramping up. The environment certainly doesn't encourage staying awhile and trying multiple hookah flavors.

Interior is quite stylish for a hookah lounge, more like a nightclub design which tends to be the least focused (interior design) in places of this sort. Little details like lighting, TV screens, projector makes all the difference. They have a wide variety of hookah flavours and other types of hookah base like glass hookah on request for extra $. I can imagine on busy evenings like Friday and Saturday nights it would be busier with louder music and more nightclub feeling as there's a DJ booth in the corner and there's room to show off your moves. They serve cocktails too. Bathrooms are clean, spacious and bright which is a bonus. The waitress is attentive and friendly and tries to accommodate your needs. They have free wifi which comes in handy when you want to book your next show in Vegas! ;)",VHeExy3v6Kdu-k1PdoovqA,0,0,5,njXcJ_wqxEGaQY2YWbmaeA

Also, my friend went inside with his hat on and was told to remove his hat (his hat which he wore since it was 40 something degrees outside). MEANWHILE, there were over 5 other guys INSIDE the lounge that ALL had hats. So why single my one friend that had a good reason for wearing the hat, when multiple other guys wore the hat inside. I had bought a groupon to go to this hookah lounge again, since we had fun in the best. You best believe I have returned that groupon.

1256065,2014-06-30,11,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"Never the type to write these types of reviews, but believe me when I say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY COMING TO THIS RIDICULOUS PLACE. 

Allow myself to explain my reasoning behind why I would never ever go back to this poorly ran establishment. I have been here twice now and I can confidently say never again.

ENCOUNTER ONE: First of all, looking for a place to smoke hookah and get drinks with friends -- this was a location that came up that provided both. I was even more excited that when I googled it, a GroupOn came up. As a precaution, I called Luna prior to purchasing it and they said they were accepting the GroupOns and were open until 3-4 in the morning. With that said, I purchased the GroupOn, which stated one hookah, one hummus trio plate, and one pot of Teavanna tea. My friends and I arrived around 11:30pm. Once seated, I presented the GroupOn to our server and she actually physically took my phone (without asking) to a room behind the bar. When she returned, she said, ""We do not honor GroupOns after 10:00pm."" I, very nicely, told her we had called ahead of time and no time limit was mentioned -- nor was any time indicated in the fine print of the GroupOn itself. Very unapologetic, she said there was nothing she could do. I then asked if I could speak to the owner, who, I would like to add, was probably one of the most emotionless and careless people I had ever met. After talking in circles for about 10 minutes, he agreed to provide us with free hookah and a plate of fries on the house... and that he would not use our GroupOn, that we could use it next time we come in. I noticed he had pushed the redeem button on the GroupOn app and when I told him this, he just said not to worry about it... to just remind him next time we come in and he would take care of us. How nice of him, right? So, the night went on, the atmosphere was okay. The music was decent at times, at others it was not good at all. We ended up spending about 250$ on drinks and shots, but the service was terrible. We would have to flag someone down any time we needed something and half the time, I had to ask twice to get something. This is definitely not a place that knows how to work their tips... These girls did not care about providing good customer service one bit. The night ended, and while I wouldn't say it was a memorable night, it wasn't a total fail either -- so I told myself I would give it another try next time. I did have a GroupOn I still was able to use for my next visit afterall.

ENCOUNTER TWO: Fast forward two weeks later. I had a friend who was in town visiting, looking for something chill but fun to do. Arriving at 8:30pm, clearly before the supposed undisclosed 10:00pm time frame, I presented the GroupOn to our server. I explained the situation about the last time and how the owner said he would let us use this at another time. She requested to take my phone to show the owner and spoke with him briefly across the room, where he was sitting in a corner smoking hookah with two other people. She came back to say that it was the other owner who said that, and they had called him numerous times without any ability to contact him for verification. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do. Despite the situation, no customer service was given. We decided to stay since we were already there. I was already annoyed... but 30 minutes later, I see the same owner, THE SAME OWNER WHO TOLD ME TO MY FACE HE WOULD HONOR IT TWO WEEKS AGO, who was who she spoke with, who promised the use of the Groupon. We made eye contact for more than a second, to where I knew he knew who I was... and all he could do was awkwardly look away and keep walking. All I could do was laugh! It is obvious business for them isn't going well, based of how the place was not busy at all... but you turning customers away is not going to help your business either. The fact this place lacks serious customer service and has owners who know nothing about customer service themselves vouches for why it is that way. 

Bottom line, I gave this place a chance... TWICE. The servers are terrible, the drinks are overpriced, the venue is small, and above all, the owner himself is a lying piece of scum. Living in Las Vegas for the last 10 years, I've never been to such a poorly managed establishment. Never again, Luna.

Last night me and some friends came to hang and listen to music .. we walked in got sat and began our night.. we ordered the ice hookah with the server who came back 5 minutes later saying they don't have the ice so she suggested the fruit bowl which would be an addition $10 charge to the hookah.. we said ok fine we'll try it.. she said they hookah would be $35.. no problem. We ordered at 11pm ... 1145 still no hookah so we flag down the server and asked what was going on and she couldn't give a direct answer so we got the attention of the host who told us the server is new and she'll check on the hookah for us. She apologizes and says she talked to the owners and they will take 10 percent off the hookah.. ok cool. I ordered and drink for $7 and water for $5 .. end of the night the check comes and this is where ish gets bad! The bill says the hookah is $40.05, the ice is $5, water is $5 and the cocktail is $7 so after taxes it was $63 and change.. WRONG. So I ask the server how is the hookah 40 dollars when she told us 35 when we ordered AND there's suppose to be a 10 percent discount and we didn't get the ice because she told us  they didn't have it!! She says ""well I watched him make the hookah and he actually did put ice in it"". SO HOW U GIVE US ICE WHEN YOUUU SPECIFICALLY SAID YOU GUYS DIDNT HAVE ANY for the hookahs!! Then she says and the hookah is 35 plus the additional fruit bowl and the 10 percent discount. This girl clearly can't do math. Hookah is 25 SO AFTER the fruit bowl fee it's $35! Smh so she tells me well I guess the fruit bowl is more "". Like girrlllllll! So I asked to speak to the owner and I tell him everything that was said to me and how the hostess said she talked to the owner and said we will receive the 10 percent off the hookah because it took 45 minutes to get and how we never received the ice because the server said there wasn't any.. he literally looked at me and said ""I don't know what you're talking about"" and turned his head .Complete disrespect! So I said to him well some one has to know what's going on, the entire staff can't be confused! He asked the server did the hookah take long and the little liar said ""it took 25 minutes "". Lmao I couldn't believe it! So I walked away looking for the hostess who helped us and she's sitting down smoking hookah and tells me she's off the clock. I was in a twilight zone. A bunch of BS. So some ""manager "" walks out and says I'll take the ice off the bill and 10 percent off the hookah BUT NOT the fruit bowl. Lmao how silly. The fruit bowl is what holds the hookah .. so why wouldn't that be discounted? No one seemed to know anything !!Yeaaa NEVER again.

1495791,2014-10-31,0,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"So Yelp deleted my previous review due to an autocorrect error... so I'm re-reviewing. 

I've been to Luna quite a few times... to be honest, partially because I was unaware of other hookah establishments. 

Luna is a nice hookah lounge tucked away in a plaza located in the north strip area. The first time we went, we didn't find it initially because it's more so in the back from the directions that GPS gave. If you're in the plaza near Encore, you're in the right place! 

The atmosphere is kind of noisey, definitely dark and trendy. On average, we experience average service. Our initial visit was great but it seems that every time we've returned... the attentiveness has dropped a smidge each time. You've gotta really keep an eye out if you notice your coals not hitting as great. They use coconut coals (it appears) which is nice. The hookahs that I've had hit alright... a little light, but it works. 

I wish during the day that they'd let a little light in...but it's on the strip and I don't think hookahing casually has picked up around here. I do enjoy the music video-dj thing they've got going on. Pretty much every song that plays is accompanied by a video. We've also visited right before a comedy night... which I kind of want to return and check out. 

The price of the hookah isn't so bad given Luna's location... if you find yourself staying on the strip and wanting to hookah...check this place out! :)",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,1,1,4,iJQ-EEn4CL5TTSA-TWC3UQ

So loud, your body will let you know. My ears wouldn't stop ringing for a half hour after. My group sat down and we left after 5 min. There's loud and then there's LOUD. I noticed that no body was talking to one another. Everyone was just sitting there. I don't know about you but hookah is all about relaxing and being social. In this place, it's impossible.

We came here Saturday night bout 7pm and it was about 5 people in there but it's a cute spot and it was still early so I ignored that fact. So we walked in and no one greeted us we kinda just wondered and found our way til eventually a guy came over and asked so you guys want a hookah, ummmm why else would we be there??!!!! So we answered and informed him we had a groupon so he said ok and set us up with the hummus, tea and pitas.  

Everyone working there just looked lost and like they didn't know what they were doing. I say that because we realized after we hit the hookah a few times that the waiter DIDN'T provide a tip to go on the neck of the hookah and that's when I was grossed out. That is gross and you would think that if you are going to run this kind of joint your staff should be trained better. due to that I didn't want to eat or finish da hookah so we just paid and left and this after we had to run down the waiter.

He played a nice mix that appealed to the mixed crowd. The patrons were fun too. No wait and our hookah was nice all night. The plus is that they serve food as well as having an open bar. There's a small dance floor. Mandy was our server Sunday. Super sweet, friendly, and attentive. This is a great place to chill, enjoy hookah, have food and drinks, and dance when your jam comes on.

I needed a fix and came here after reviewing local hookah bars. The atmosphere is relaxed, the music is good. With a dance floor & bar it serves both sides of having fun. Only downside from my opinion is the lack of hookah brands. Most blends contain haze which I don't like. And that you're not allowed to have tongs to move your coals. But overall I enjoyed my time.

We bought a groupon but realized it had to be used before 7pm so our server stated we could use the $10 off $20 that is featured on yelp. So we ordered a hookah, a beer, a coke and 3 waters. We were kind of surprised that she brought out 3 bottles of Voss rather than 3 tap waters. We looked at the menu and saw the water is $3 each. Ok no big deal but it would have been nice to know you only offer bottled overpriced water. The hookah was decent but we had to ask multiple times for a server to come over and rotate the charcoals. Also we planned on ordering the Luna trio but the server said they only had hummus, no tabouli or ceviche. The hummus platter was pretty good. Finally we ask for the bill and everything on the receipt was prices incorrectly. We were charged $5 each for the water although the menu said  $3. When we pointed that out to the server she said ""thats a typo, no one's ever pointed that out before"" umm.. ok.. also the price of the hummus was $1 more than the menu stated and no discount on the bill. So we had her adjust the bill after showing her the menu and would only give us the 15% discount even though she said we would be getting  $10 off as the website states. I am not a fussy customer but you would think we'd get decent service since we were the only table there and not try to slyly overcharge us.

My only gripes about this place:
- To get the 15% off you have to write a 5 star review (wtf really?)
- The toilets STINK as soon as you walk in. Eggorama
- Nobody checked out coals during our visit
- Kinda hard to pay our bill, the lady kinda walked off and started cleaning lol

The place is REALLY nice but the management is horrible. I guess the owner was there and when we walked in we asked is it self seat or they seat us  he just said just go sit down ? Really rude much. The waitress or host whatever you want to call her do sent know a tad bit about hookah. I asked for a specific flavor she said they don't have it. Then later when I got my nasty tasting hookah. The guy was like oh ya we do have that flavor. And didn't even bother to change mine. I got 2 hookahs and each one was worse than the other. Place has potential just needs the right people to run it. And also the dj sucks my 8 year old nephew can pick and mix better music. Never commin back,xnvoZGn3PBC8gI6tFzc3vw,2,0,1,YH6wO9dtrejw212CoKT74g
3304202,2013-10-09,2,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"Finally, a good hookah spot on the Strip!

I checked out Luna Lounge with a few of my friends this week. A lot of hookah lounges in town try to market themselves as a nightclub but few succeed in capturing that party atmosphere. Fortunately Luna is one of spots that is able to deliver on that promise. The place looks like a nightclub complete with a dancefloor, DJ, and bottle service. A sleek modern interior with comfortable seating and impressive sound system makes it a fun place to chill and smoke up. 

We used the $10 for $20 yelp deal which is definitely worth it considering they charge $22 for one hookah. At this price they probably one of the most expensive hookah spots in town. The $35 they charge for a fruit bowl is just plain ridiculous. The hookah was pretty good, the bowl and refill we got each lasted for about an hour and they came by regularly with fresh coconut coals. 

Service was excellent, Luna looks to be family owned and they came by to check up on us pretty often. They also serve food and thankfully feature a full bar which is rare among hookah lounges.

Remember to check in for the 15% off Yelp deal!",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,5,4,4,k6qjHHqkl8JSEv4ux9oChA

Horrible service. Took like 10 minutes to even see an employee and then another 40 minutes to get a hookah. Took another 20 minutes to flag down an employee to get food and another 20 minutes to get a cheesecake and some Oreos..... 

The place is really nice and clean (except for the bathrooms) but it isn't worth it. The quality of the hookah is average, nothing special. $24 for regular hookah with a flavor. We got the Frozen Lakes flavor but you couldn't really taste it. 

The music was very low and poor quality. And an employee served us soda with ice when we said no ice and just walked away. 

Overall, very disappointed. We are locals and we had heard very good things about this place. But we were not impressed. We had nobody check on us for over an hour and when we were ready to pay, an employee approached us and said in a rude way, ""what do you need?"".

He was awesome, he played such a huge variety of music from older classics to newer hits, even different genres, and he mixed them all together seamlessly. This guy definately knew his music. It's sounds wierd but he was so good, we were basically hyped up all night singing and sometimes dancing on the small space in the front, and neither of us ever dance like that haha.

First time we came around 11pm on a Saturday night, very small crowd, but we enjoyed our hookahs. My friend I was with had told me they have Kale Pache on Friday nights, I'm not into boiled sheeps head, but I'd be more than willing to come just for the experience. 

After a fantastic dinner at Barrymore, we decided to stop in. It was around 8pm and it was a totally different crowd. The music playing was, um, every other word was the n* word, I mean I like Tupac just as much as the next guy, but can we mix it up? The girl next to us was wearing a sports bra as her shirt.

So this time around...the hookahs sucked. We tried 4 different times, and my friend even gave the guy $20 to see if that would help with the problem. Nope. Cocktail list is kinda crap. And if I'm paying $12 for bottled water, it better be Evian Pure or something of the like. Not Voss.

As it was a weekday, there wasn't too many people here.  We got a fruitbowl and a mix of different flavors and for the price, not too bad! for checking in with yelp i also got 15% off which is an awesome deal.

The place has a nice modern look with great lounge chairs and couches with great lighting. There's a DJ booth in the back for those nights where they hold special events every week. Not too bad of sound system right now.

Service was great, always got checked up on, got a new set of coals right before the previous were about to go out without us asking is perfect. We also got tongs which was perfect, as i like to move the coals around without pulling out a coin or a card.

Their food is a bit pricey, we didn't order any as it was a bit high.

5/5 for great customer service and how the inside looks great, and for those who are out of town visiting if you want your hookah fix, Luna has to be the best, if not only the strip, but Las Vegas.",97qEu_8WUPsAvpOINUvoEA,1,2,5,hRs8ZX5xVaA0zIs8Ff-pmw

My boyfriend and I went there in early January and the service was terrible. No one came to ask how we were doing, they did not refresh the coals and I had to keep asking for someone to do it. Finally, 45 mins later someone comes over to help us and informs us that the hookah is already out. We wasted so much time there just trying to get service. And the place was not busy at all. I kept asking for a waiter and they are all too busy talking to each other. There were 4 waitresses who were just talking to one another and not doing anything. I don't smoke hookah regularly but it was awful. On a previous trip, we tried hookah at the AzuzA Hookah Lounge Tapas & Cafe that is a little off the strip, and that place was amazing. They refreshed the coals constantly and it lasted forever. However, that place had a 2 drink minimum (slightly lame), but honestly the drinks were really good (same with the food) and the hookah was awesome. Worth the money.

4534153,2016-09-15,0,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"One of the Top hookah places in Las Vegas. I've been here a number times so I can make a solid review.

1) Where - Its across the street of the Encore, in the shopping plaza, tucked in the corner.
2) Whats inside: All the seats are black leather chairs and leather sofas. 
3) Music: Every night is different. On the weekends, they have a DJ
4) The Hookah: They have all the flavors available. Mix and choose. They are clean and you can even ask for the glass hose (We call it the RPG hose). Get that.. it comes frozen and it cools down the smoke.
5) The Service: The waitresses are incredible and always attentive. Jackie is great.. The hookah guys are always coming by refreshing your calls. In fact, I never had to ever call anyone to refresh my coals.
6) The price: Not expensive at all. Its basically half of what you would normally pay for a hookah at the Rumbar at the Mirage
7) The Food is fantastic and they have a lot of options! Get the Luna Chicken, Fruit Salad, and the wrap
8) The drinks are always made well here. They are priced right.
9) If the inside is too loud (which it can be sometimes) you can sit outside on the patio.
10) Crowd - the place is getting more crowded as word is getting around... I would get there at 10am and been there until 3am.
11) They have security guards here so that's good
12) There is a dance floor and dancing.
13) You can call for reservations and get one of the nice corner seating sofas that are elevated a half a foot off the ground.",ssUHjGmbTqWNaSN1uLBgQw,5,1,5,X2Bn95wKMNRPhqR8tLrlFw

A very nice gentlemen who seemed to have good intent. He told us what a nice place it was and to come check it out. I was excited that this was a place I could invite friends that are 18+ and I could still have a drink. I invited 3 ladies and we arrived around 9PM.

When we arrived to Luna the gentlemen who had invited us was at the door and welcomed us in. We were seated in front of a nice sized dance floor and bar. The inside of Luna is very nice. The walls are made up grey bricks pattern that looks amazing with the lights. I felt very comfortable in the cushiony chair.  They have VIP looking seating with larger tables. Everything overlooks the dance floor and DJ nicely. The entire place is so cute. If my experiences were better I would be back every weekend just to enjoy the chill ambiance the place has on its own.

Two of the ladies were not 21 and were there solely for hookah. All four of us are college students and are on budgets (much like the rest of America). We liked that the prices for the hookah and the drinks were clearly listed. We even got a discount when we checked in on yelp. 

My 21+ friend and I ordered off of their specialty drink menu. We both ordered two drinks. The  drinks were not the best but not the worst. Long island tasted like a premix. Couldn't complain, we were there for hookah, which was great. The guy serving us and making sure our coals were flipped did a great job.

When we went to pay our bill my 18+ friends said they would take care of the hookah. We brought our check up to the bar to meet our server and asked her if she could charge the hookah separately and let me pay for my drinks as well as my friends. I paid for our drinks and said goodbye to 2 of my friends and my other friend and I left.

The next day I received a call from my two friends who are 18+ telling us how when they were paying for the hookah they were also being charged for 2 alcoholic beverages that I had not paid for. They had to fight with Luna about how they were not responsible for the alcohol and that they are both 18 years old. My friend took care of the two drinks the hookah and left. 

The next weekend I came in with the same friends to talk to our server and to clear the air since we liked the place so much. She was not the same person serving us, but I saw our original server. She was standing at the bar. I would like to say I am just paranoid but when I sat down I saw point at me and told her coworker something. I felt very uncomfortable. I felt like she was talking about me and I didn't order anything. My friends had hookah but I felt we were unwelcome. 

A few moments later there was a fight and we decided to leave. When we went outside we saw someone who worked for the lounge fighting with the promoter who had brought our business in. The man was telling him that he shouldn't get paid because he hadn't worked. I felt very bad for the promoter. 

There was a lot of 18+. The parking lot was filled with people around that age loitering, drinking, and fighting. I would like to say this place is amazing, and I could actually say that..  but as far as the service goes... I'd have to agree with some of the other reviews that say it seems like their are employees in there who aren't sure what they should be doing and kind of just stand around.

I was out in the parking lot smoking a cigarette and the server was walking around with a bill looking for the person who had walked out on it, then I walk in the door and right when you walk in there are three guys that work there standing against the wall laughing, hanging out, not really helping.

My server may have been rude but really she was the only one besides the one fellow who did our hookah who were working.",LS6zQ4mqEemkXOhZhVckuw,6,1,1,qFl4XQSchCHuV7XwpyV8NA

5156194,2017-07-11,0,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"I'll start off by saying that we were in Vegas for the Hookah Expo Worldwide hosted by Hookah John. So there was all sorts of people in the industry from lounge owners, to tobacco manufactures, to online vendors to, the end consumer or the ""Hookah Enthusiast."" So we visited five lounges over the weekend the only one we kept going back to was Oasis Hookah Lounge. 

Review: To get the check in offer, you had to give the name of the server and say "" _____ was awesome"" in a review (not just check in, which is against Yelp policy). 200$ for non smokable hookah,  drinks were on point, interior is very nice, bathrooms were clean. Was more of a club scene but I could still talk to my group which was awesome. They carry Haze which is actually a really decent brand I would rate above Starbuzz and Al Fakher but below Trifecta, Ugly, and Alchemist. If packed right the bowls can last 1-2 hours with foil and coconut coals, longer if your using an HMD such as a Phoenix or Lotus. The problem was it wasn't packed right because we had two separate hookahs of What-A-Mint which is a creamy peppermint flavor. One hookah had no peppermint taste whatsoever, the other one did have some minty taste but not up to What-A-Mint potential. The other plus with this lounge is they use Coconut Charcoal instead of quicklights unlike a lot of lounges. That's why I see the potential to get even better they care about customers enough to use better coals. The reason they got 2 stars even with all the positive I had to say about the place is because they are advertised first as a hookah lounge, so when the hookah was this bad I'm basing my review mainly on that aspect. I would not go here for hookah but I would go for drinks.",63VEgjbENKiaTY6x1Bq7cQ,2,0,2,MAhIBRjpKPCUdWHML7VnWg

He's been dying to do Hookah with me and we never had the chance to do it since we dont see each other too often. Honestly, I have never done Hookah nor that I ever wanted to, but I guess coming with him didnt really matter much to me. I have seen friends do Hookah but it never really piqued my interest. I'm just not into 'smoking' of any kind.

Before entering, they check your ID to make sure youre old enough to enter the facility. Upon entering, our server sat us on one of the tables with comfy sofa. I dont know much about Hookah so boyfriend ordered and did everything. I think we got Peach flavor with the Ice Hose. He said Ice Hose makes it easier to smoke since you dont feel the 'heat' when you inhale/exhale.

The girl across from our table was curious about our Ice Hose and asked the server for it but unfortunately, they only had one at the store. I guess a lot of them dont know about it or demand is very very low. Ice stayed cool for almost entire time we were there (more than an hour) and it was worth the investment.

Best part of Luna was that you can drink and eat while doing Hookah. Boyfriend and I just grabbed beer and that was good enough. I saw their menu with many different cocktails so ordering a cocktail doesnt seem bad of an idea!

Place is clean and they keep coming to your table to check your hookah setup thingy (whatever you call that stuff, lol).

We walk in and the bouncer immediately runs over to us from across the room at the other entrance. What I IMMEDIATELY noticed was that the floor by the bar was completely wet. Unless it's a pool party or a bathtub, water, where it SHOULD NOT BE is a turn off!!! They did have a wet floor sign up. 

Idk the best word to describe the atmosphere so I'll just go with grunge meets night of the living dead. Our waitress was nice though. I ordered a long island iced tea and it was a strong as the airplane that we flew to Vegas on. We got two different flavors of hookas and it was my first time trying it....it was interesting. Not bad though, just interesting. They were $24 total which friendgirl said was a good price. The DJ was decent. This is a really low key spot, so don't go here if you want more of a crowd.

The security takes there job serious. And at first one of my brothers wasn't going to be able to go inside because he did have a little attitude but not with security it was with his wife but after he calmed down the security let him in. Which I totally understand. We got seated and our waiter immediately start taking our orders. Beautiful waiter and she always checked on us to make sure everything was ok. I felt bad because one of my guest was spilling his drink and the guy had to come and clean like 3 times but he was always nice about it and never gave us a attitude. We did bottle service henny and it comes with hookah and plate of fries and order extra hookah and 4 buckets of beers. 1 blue moon, 2 Heineken and Corona. Let me just say the DJ was on point. He played all the jams and he did a little variety as well. It was cracking and the music was awesome and my whole group all agreed. Most of them was on the dance floor all night. And we were there from 12:40am to 4:00am. Our waiter brought a cake over for my sister because we were there celebrating her 30th birthday. Very nice and lounge and has like club environment too. We were going to go clubbing but I had injured my foot so I couldn't really walk so luckily I found this place on Yelp and my sister whom birthday it was loved it and said she had so much fun! She enjoyed her birthday and we all did and the dj gave her a shout out and she got a cheesecake I think it was too. Good place. Bathroom was clean everything was good and easy to get in and out. I feel bad that I didn't get my waiter name because she definitely was amazing and very sweet. Thank you Luna for making this a night to remember.",cSmh0fKfNlmGVhU6GYyYNA,0,0,5,Ffnh5QbfLTtgpxj2apRubA

I loved this place because they did the fruit bowl extremely well. If anyone else wants to try a fruit bowl that hasn't already, I'd recommend kiwi and mint on a pineapple base, and this place packs it great. The vibe here was comforting and really laid back.

5544151,2017-07-14,0,UN_6ebslv5cxdDmZAX3ivQ,"The only reason this place is getting 3 stars and not 1 star is because of Alan & Jackie.

That first night we were in Las Vegas we decided to go to a hookah lounge close to the strip that we've been to before. 

We walked most of the strip from MGM down to Harrah's in 100-110 degree heat at night it was like around 9-10pm then we cabbed it the rest of the way. We got to Luna Lounge and we barely got out of the cab and the front host outside was standing with a security/bouncer and told us we had to spend $200.00 in order to sit inside with A/C on or not spend $200.00 and sit outside and smoke our hookah in the 110 degree weather. 

There is 5 of us going in (my sister, her husband, my boyfriend, and myself, and our homeboy) and we come here every time we are in Vegas no one has ever made that rule before that's a bit insensitive to make your customers sit outside in this heat no fans no mist etc and force them to pay $200.00 to get some A/C or be indoor.  We asked when did this rule happen they said ""when we came out with these new menus."" That was BS because nothing on there was new that we hadn't seen before & my sister and her husband had gone there a couple weeks before with some friends.

SO, we sat outside! When I asked for 5 bottles of water I checked the prices after the girl went to go grab our drinks I realized they were $5.00 per bottle. Hookah in Las Vegas is expensive (everything in Las Vegas is expensive on the strip for those who don't know) we didn't mind paying that's why we went there. Hookah was $24.00 each we ordered 3. Adding all this up with the waters we would already be spending over $100.00 with tax. 

I did the math to everyone and said lets just sit inside. We ended up sitting inside and knew we had to spend $200.00 apparently. When our hookahs came out 2/3 were made incorrectly. We waited 25 minutes for 1 hookah to be fixed and then 45 minutes for the other to be fixed. 

At this point we are all hella irritated and upset at this point, not only do we HAVE to spend $200.00 here but your customer service is horrible and your urgency to fix your mistake was not there. We asked to speak to a manager since the second hookah was fixed in 45 minutes later around 11:50 pm. Jackie didn't come to our table till 2:00 am. 

Alan was the ONLY employee besides Jackie (after we finally got to talk to her) that made us feel like our business was important and that they would try to do what it took to make it better for us. Alan tried his best to rush our new bowls over but it wasn't in his hands he just kept checking for us without us having to ask. Super friendly it was his 3rd day on the job and he was just a great person all around. We appreciated Alan because he listened and he made us feel like even though the mistake that happened wasn't his fault he would still check to see it was corrected and very apologetic. The management and other staff members could learn a thing or two from Alan. We wish we could take Alan back to the Bay with us because our hookah lounges out here would love having a worker like him he's truly a great worker.

Now onto Jackie.

Jackie has helped us out numerous of times before (like I said this isn't our first trip to Vegas or smoking hookah). I asked her is everyone in here spending $200.00? Because that is what your employee at the front door is telling your customers. Jackie was not surprised. She said we were one of several tables complaining about this issue. She said she has since talked to the employee and will be having a employee meeting once the place is closed for the night. 

We informed her although you may be some what busy the sense of urgency is not there from your staff besides Alan to get the mistake corrected. We don't want to spend money and time somewhere that we are clearly not wanted or cared for as customers/ consumers. 

The money isn't the issue because they can even tell you we spent over $200.00 and we would have spent more than we did had we had our hookahs were fixed in a timely manner rather than 25-45 minutes per each one. We were going to spend regardless because it was my brother in laws birthday. That's why we came out to Las Vegas. Everywhere we went we spent a good amount because we were out there celebrating. By the time it hit 2 am I didn't want to stay up any longer. I was tired of being there for 4 hours and it took 1 hour to get my hookah so I was personally over it. 

Jackie let us know a lot of the employees are fairly new and she was very apologetic. She gave us all free refills on our hookahs and helped us out the entire night for whatever we needed. 

The refills for whatever reason tasted better than the originals we ordered (they were the same flavor lol) and they came out so much faster. If it wasn't for me being so dam sleepy since we waited so long to get the mistake corrected I think I would have had a better night including everyone else because Alan and Jackie did change the experience for us in a better way",on4PhQCtd0dEnmJPSHZvfw,3,0,3,hZvqzHlh5OYtfiJMBL1DNA

The food was a highlight as well. Had the hummus trio, white pizza and feta stuffed mushrooms which were all very tasty. The price was reasonable too.

If you are looking for a place to go dancing dont go here. This is primarily a hookah lounge/bar. Left at almost midnight and no one even has the intention of dancing. I don't smoke so this was a bad choice for me. 
We ordered a couple of drinks and an appetizer. After the first round we asked for a cup of water before getting started on the second round. The server insisted we had to get bottles of water ($).... I don't believe In paying for something that should be legally free and especially if we are going to contribute to purchase additional drinks. 
Well that was the end of that and we closed our checks and left. In my opinion this is bad business.  For a better option try La Jolla.",Wh5_X4ltDp8d5vfkEmrNGw,2,0,1,VFzTvNzBvybpy9ubznTZ7g
