This barbecue place has a food truck that comes to my work occasionally well they have started cumming inside the building and doing catering in the lunchroom the last couple times they came they were sold out before I got a chance to get any of this time I made sure I showed up early to get my fill of barbecue!

The ribs were amazing the hot links were terrific. one of the best bbq in the country only draw back was he was out of brisket ( had a party that ordered Brisket ) his baked beans are out of this world.

First off, the cabbage looked as if it was boiled in old grease. It sat overcooked broken emulsion pool of oily water juice. My beans were sloppily poured in the compartment next to and on top of half of my cabbage. The beans which were from a can had ground beef added to them, and they would have been good if not for the salt content. They were soooo salty I only ate three bites. Giving each a taste a chance, to be sure I was not over reacting. The ribs had a nice bite and smokey flavor but again....salty as all heck. I would guess it was the rub. Who ever is doing the seasoning must be very heavy handed or not tasting the food during and after cooking. *my advice, you could elevate your baked bean dish by using using dry beans instead of canned ones. Try saut√©ing your cabbage to order instead instead of boiling it in with and in fat or with fatty meat.",Tyqwxo11hWqttUw5QHERRw,3,0,2,t8m097Qr4TIZ7C9yOaTHEA

Only flaw is that for bbq- no pulled pork the day i went. Seems they do one specialty a day- i went on ribs day. 
Again, the fish was unreal. The fries sucked but didnt care the fish was so good.",x5q7AGwfpctUuCzcOXx1Wg,0,1,5,kiXS6anIKJb0f_YbJmlr3w

Kind of a scary location but if you want real southern bbq & smoked meaty ribs this is the place.

The owners are really friendly people and take great pride in their love of bbq & soul food and it really shows in their food.

Best ribs at the 1st annual Charity BBQ  Battle. I really liked her potato salad too.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,4,3,4,6HBqEDlZlQPhJnhfhTPcxg

I've been here a few times and I have to say that the sauce is excellent but the meat can sometimes be dry.  Good flavors and reasonable prices, though.",WKaMMaZO5ThNDzJZj2_vzg,0,0,3,3gKTALZtsiIjb9wR8mUe0g
