53683,2017-08-13,0,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"The Charcoal seems to have an identity issue. The food is consistently good, although they may need to find another fish supply. This restaurant suffers from the same malady at times as other food outlets at Santa Fe = shortage of staff, which seems almost chronic. Lately, the Charcoal has employed a singer, strumming a guitar, and proudly singing what I would classify as college songs.
C'mon......  Everyone seems to ask the hostess for the back of the restaurant when they walk in and hear him bleating out these ole dorm classics.
Charcoal room....... maybe send him packing to Cabos, dim the lights 1/3, kill the music down to 10 decibels and make it a classier place to eat.
Still, music or not....great food, usually great service...",ih7Dmu7wZpKVwlBRbakJOQ,0,0,4,odCBW_CwtmBgicRg6wdnCg

64554,2013-06-10,0,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"he Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station is where we come when we want more of an upscale steakhouse without breaking the bank. Since it's not far from the house, we usually try to get up here every other month or so. The meals and service are always outstanding.

The restaurant is tucked away in a corner of the casino not far from where the front doors used to be before the casino underwent many of its makeovers. You might not expect a local's casino such as this to have a fine dining establishment, but the Charcoal Room has survived when many of the other eateries that aren't in the food court have come and gone. One complaint is that the dress code has gone down somewhat over the past few years. It used to be business/dressy, but it seems that we see a lot more people in here dressed in shorts and t-shirts. However, they're usually seated toward the front doors or the bar area, so the good seating in the back is a bit more refined and romantic (except for the TV over the fireplace).

Although it has seldom been busy when we've gone, reservations would be recommended on Friday and Saturday nights. Request a table or booth in the back of the restaurant to avoid the noise of the bar and the flow of people coming and going. When arriving, we've never had to wait more than a minute or two until the hostess took us back to our table. Once seated, the waiter stops by the table promptly to introduce himself and take your drink order. They have a large selection of wine, so if you're planning on having wine with the dinner and aren't sure what to order, don't hesitate to ask the waiter or sommelier. They'll listen to your wine preferences and recommend a few wines that will pair well with your planned meal. They don't push the most expensive wine or the one with the biggest profit margin. We've found some good wines that we normally wouldn't have picked out.

We always begin our meal with a starter and can heartily recommend the stuffed Portobello mushrooms, crab cakes, bacon wrapped shrimp, or the bacon wrapped scallops. We usually choose the scallops and they're always perfectly cooked. Since this is a steakhouse, we don't change our order that much on each visit. I usually have the pan-seared ribeye and Brenda gets either the petite or full size filet mignon depending on her appetite. The steaks are always cooked to what you order. We don't have to order our steak rare to get one that is medium rare like some establishments. Dining is a la carte, so your sides are additional. The grilled asparagus, baked potato and garlic mashed potatoes are all tasty. They don't have the garlic mashed potatoes on the menu, but the chef will usually whip some up for you.

During the meal, the wait staff checks on you often enough to make sure you don't need anything else, but they're not intrusive. They are staffed well enough so it doesn't take more than a slightly raised finger or nod of the head to bring the waiter to the table. Every time we've been there, the head chef has always made the rounds of the dining room to personally ensure that everyone's meal met to their satisfaction. Instead of cheap Styrofoam, any leftovers are placed in disposable plastic containers and given to you in a nice red Charcoal Room bag.

Just writing this review makes me want to give our host a call to set up reservations for another meal here.",SHaD3Xf6anwY8hIRoYeDXQ,1,0,4,cxqSncbPyP_Z85KsFWMDIw

The dining room service was spotty.

I ordered the lobster chowder and the filet sliders w/ creamed spinach.

I had to send back the chowder as it was bland, underseasoned and tasteless.

The sliders were great and cooked to a perfect MR.

The spinach was underseasoned and underwhelming.

My wife ordered the petit filet Oscar style.  It was cooked perfectly, but they forgot the Oscar.

The food, service and ambiance has always been enjoyable.  So for our anniversary last Friday night, my wife and I enjoyed Porterhouse Steak, Broiled Sea Bass, French Onion Soup, Oysters on the Half Shell, and sides of Scallops, Au Gratin Potatoes, Creamed Corn, plus Chocolate Cake for dessert.

What I didn't enjoy was the explosive diarrhea that struck me moments after coming home, and which lasted about 18 hours.  I suspect the Oysters were bad as they were the only item which my wife didn't taste, and she was fine.  The following day, I wanted to warn the restaurant that their Oysters may be spoiled, but no one took my call.

The Charcoal Room ain't what it used to be. I took My visiting Family there last night(Tuesday). This was the only resturant I ever ordered the Porterhouse. It used to be incredible, now, it just needs laces. Had a reservation, only one booth open, the first one, the rest were dirty, the hostess told Us. The waiter spoke broken english. OK. The steakhouse chopped salad, was chopped about 3 hours before We got them, light on the dressing, almost like a soup. Not crispy at all, no flavor.. My steak, I ordered medium rare, was medium. Fortunately, My nephew ordered his NY steak medium and it came medium rare, so I ate most of his and took mine home to My pooch, even she was dissappointed. The colossal baked potato was poor quality, soggy skin, hard and cracked inside...old. The Mac and Cheese, those bastards!!! Yep, also made too far ahead. I would say the service was good except for two things. One, Nobody ever asked how things were. Two, when you're a waiter and you're putting a coustomers entire steak(less 2 bites) into a doggie bag, don't you wonder why?

701244,2015-02-27,0,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"Just left The Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station in the Northwest part of Las Vegas.

6:45 dinner reservation for me and my wife. We were seated promptly.

Then we sat for 12 minutes without a soul stopping by to say anything. Finally someone stopped and asked us if we would like some water. My wife tried to order a martini from the bar. ""I can't do that, but I can try and find your server."" 

4 minutes later Patty showed up. We ordered bread (the pretzel bread is pretty good, I admit),  a diet Coke for me and the apple martini for my wife. Since we were concerned we might not see Patty again for a while, we went ahead and ordered appetizers and main courses then as well.

The diet Coke and bread showed up in minutes. The apple martini took 12 MORE minutes. It didn't arrive until seconds before the appetizers arrived. Patty apologized and vowed to find a manger to take some percentage off of our final bill for making us wait so long.

Crab cakes (appetizer) were ok. I'm a crab cake fan and these were no better than what you can buy at a supermarket and bake in your own oven. The crab meat to filler ratios were skewed waaaay too much in the favor of whatever breadcrumb-type filler they use.

The oysters on the half-shell were good - fresh horseradish, fresh cocktail sauce and tabasco. No saltine crackers like in some places but not a biggie. I felt they would've brought us some if we'd asked, but I didn't want to risk waiting 20 minutes for them.

Entrees arrived. I had a full-sized filet mignon and a lobster tail. My wife had pan-seared scallops and we shared some of the lobster mac n cheese.

My steak was a good-sized portion, appeared to be a good cut of meat and was perfectly cooked. Unfortunately it had next to zero flavor. That is NOT necessarily the fault of the restaurant as it appeared they did everything right with this filet. Sometimes you just get one where you did everything right with and it still comes out tasting like grilled water. I'm a steak aficionado and what I've read on this issue in the past suggests that the diet of the cow is the most likely culprit here, but even that is debatable. Suffice to say I don't blame the Charcoal Room for a properly cooked but flavorless steak - I blame the cow!

My wife's scallops tasted ok. On a 1 - 10 scale they'd be about a 6. It's pretty obvious to me that these scallops had been frozen prior to hitting the pan. That's ok if you're going to really take your time to make sure they come out perfect, but it's not okay if you're going to just slap them down for a pre-determined period of time and call it a day. You might get away with that using fresh or thawed scallops, but not frozen.

The sauces for the crab cakes and scallops appeared to be the same sauce and it was completely uninspired. A good crab cake remoulade usually has a ""mustardy"" (if that's a word) quality to it that bites back a bit when you try it. This sauce was mildly buttery but completely devoid of anything resembling a spice or flavor.

My lobster tail was the biggest disappointment. Again, it appears to have been cooked properly, but had a slightly overcooked, rubbery texture. Like the scallops, I would bet anything this is a result of using an improperly thawed lobster tail.

Incidentally, I realize that virtually ALL modern seafood is frozen at some point in its journey to your plate Yes, even the majority of sushi is frozen before you eat it - in fact, it's frozen before it leaves the boat that caught it! Several times I've stood in the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo and watched the flash-frozen blue-fin and yellow-tail tuna hit the docks frozen solid before the morning auctions.

The problem isn't the freezing of seafood for shipping - it's in sloppy thawing (or non-existent thawing) procedures before cooking. That's what I suspect doomed my wife's scallops and my lobster tail.

The mac n cheese with lobster was good but not phenomenal.

We passed on dessert.

That ""discount"" that Patty promised to get us? Never materialized.

We'll not be back.",NVWO4A0kzIHjkeI5d6ge9g,0,0,2,Zg5w7Lj718oQJQGvLNa6IA

First off, I am not used to high-end steakhouse dining.  Ellis Island is my average steak joint of choice.  A la Carte dining is also new to me but not an unwelcome option.  

This evening we showed up around 8pm on Saturday and were seated immediately.  The middle of the restaurant has a bar with plasma tvs; this was great for watching the Final Four games while dining.

Service was quick and excellent (helpful because the restaurant was not very full).  The bread options were excellent, from regular rolls to pretzel bread, there was plenty for the entire table.  Salads were optional and while I did not enjoy one, the others at my table were raving over a simple chopped salad.

My roommate and I ordered the 14oz Triple Peppercorn Steak while our guest had the 20oz Bone-In New York Strip.  Our steaks were amazingly soft yet crunchy with the spices making each bite utterly enjoyable.  We added a Lobster Mac & Cheese for a side that we all shared and this was equally as good.

While I could not afford to eat here often, if I wanted to treat a guest to a nice steak dinner with an excellent atmosphere but not stuffy enough you couldn't wear jeans and a t-shirt into the restaurant, this is the place I'd go.",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,2,2,4,kRuACIkMgr-l0cj0FOGpWQ

We had a 5pm reservation. Arrived at 450 and had to wait till 5pm on the dot. Fine since that's when they ""open"".
We've been here quite a few times. Every single time my mother in laws filet is undercooked. She requests well done, and while some may not like to cook a steak that temp , this is what she likes. The steak was pink throughout. The other 3 in the party- steak amazing. But poor mil, she sent the steak back asking for a well done filet. The same steak comes back charred on the outside but still slightly pink. For a 34.00 piece of meat it should be cooked right. And it just doesn't seem right to bring the same steak back. Now, the service was slightly odd. The waitress , I can't recall her name but it started with a J , and her help I believe was jordan. Anyway, they weren't rude but just lingered way to much.

Even though the casino itself may be dated, the Charcoal Room was one of the best dining experiences I had in Las Vegas and highlights the fact that the best food is found off the Strip.

All four of us had various cuts of steak, all with different seasoning and taste. If you like thicker cuts, try the porterhouse or the succulent prime rib - the prime rib especially with the cilantro sauce was out of this world. I had the petit filet mignon and added some scallops on the side - the menu no longer had the surf and turf combo others mentioned, but they still allow you to add on smaller portions of seafood to an existing entrée. No complaints about the scallops - cooked to perfection but just wished I got a larger portion for the price. The petit filet was wonderful.

Vegetarian sides were also a la carte and didn't come with steak meals.

The service was warm and polite and the restaurant itself was classy. I could easily see myself having a business lunch/dinner here with no concerns.

Everything that came out of the kitchen was fantastic, the steaks, salad, side dishes were all great. The kitchen deserves five stars as they're doing their part really well. It's in the service that this place fails.
It started out fine, with our waitress and her assistant paying attention but not hovering, yet it would be nice if the waitress could have cracked a smile at some point. 
After our food was delivered, things fell apart fast. The manager came by to ask how we were right when we started eating, and we said ""great"", because the food is excellent. But then our glasses emptied and we began looking around for our waitress, who we hadn't seen in awhile as our food was delivered by someone else. Another waitress kept going by our table and we watched her, but she refused to make eye contact.Is it too hard to fill some glasses? The assistant was missing too, so rather than spending our meal craning around, I grabbed my companion's empty glass and went to the bar, standing to the left of the bartender who was using the computer screen. I waited, and she actually ignored me. Then the assistant eventually re-appeared and took my glass, but I stood there in the middle of the dining room for a few minutes being ignored.
After we finished, we sat there waiting to ask for a box, but again, no waitress. We waited and watched, then  eventually the assistant came over because we were just sitting there looking around. We had seen a dessert cart on the other side of the dining room and wanted to order two desserts, but by the time our waitress finally made her way back to us, she had our bill in her hand and wouldn't look at us. She asked if we wanted dessert, but it was with the bill sitting there in her hand, so we just said no so we could go.Then the assistant came to take our plates away and knocked a wine glass onto the floor at our feet, where it shattered.

1549212,2015-01-25,4,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"Had some free time with the GF and we decided to check out the Charcoal Room at the Santa Fe.  Reservations were made with ease compliments of the yelp website for an early dinner.

We arrived and valeted on the south side.  This made for an easy walk to venue.  The hostess was pleasant and we got to choose between a table or booth.  I like booth when I am with my lady.  Sadly, when we sat down, the angles were all off. the table only moves forwards and backwards.  As a result of my current girth, I was pinned in.  We quickly chose a table.

The service was friendly and attentive.  We bused out with a coupon we had received in the mail.  They advised to give it to them in the end.

The GF started with wine and I started with a martini.  They shake it elsewhere and bring the shaker to the table.  After pouring there was enough left over to replace the half I had already sipped.

Foe an appetizer we decided to split a heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella.  It was a tasty way to start the meal along with the delicious bread.  Some how we had some self control and left room for the meal.

The GF ordered the scallops.  Pan seared or broiled....I can't remember.  They were a welcome addition to my beef to come.  Clean and not sandy.

I ordered up a Fillet Mignon.  Unknown how many ounces it was but is was not a petit for sure.  Medium rare was the call.  I believe it arrived on the verge of rare.  I did not care, my concern was with the GF.  No worries because she ate the half I gave her.  There was a nice cilantro & garlic sauce which accompanied the meal.

Our sides included lobster mac-in-cheese and a truly loaded backed Idaho potato.  First the lobster mac...It was cheesy delicious with a cork screw pasta (if memory serves) the not small pieces of lobsters and crunchy breading were tasty.  The potato was last as well.  I was asked if I wanted the cheese melted and I absolutely agreed.  It came with butter, sour cream, bacon, chives.  This was added to the potato and severed along with the remainder of the meal.

For desert the GF and shared a very berry crisp with a healthy serving of vanilla gelato placed on top.

All in all a pleasant meal decided upon in quick fashion.  Everything came in under a hundo with the coupon.  Not that fancy, as I wore jeans and a collared button up.  But the taste was fancy and affordable.  I look forward to trying again!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,4,4,TmuGR2wnBnRGb6cj8LdfiA

The entrance was nice and they have a wall of wine as you walk in and also have another wall of wine towards the back area. The hostess was polite and we were escorted ton our tables promptly. Our waiter was nice and he handled everything great. As we look over the menu we come to two choices the new york or top sirloin usda steaks aged for 28 days. Everything on the menu is a la carte and at $35-$45 for just a steak was a steep price. So we ordered oysters on the half shell,  coconut shrimp, asparagus,  baked sweet potato,  lobster mac n cheese, my mom had the usda new york steak and my lady and I both had the usda top sirloin.  Lets start with the appetizers.  The coconut shrimp was very tasty my inly complaint is that there is only three lol! The oysters were surprisingly great! Briney, with tobasco, horseradish,  and cocktail sauce was great! Now in the main event. The sides were great baked sweet potato was cooked perfectly amd accompanied with a cinnamon sugar butter, the asparagus was cooked theough and had a great taste, the lobster mac n cheese was awesome!! Tender lobster atop a bed of mac n cheese!! The steaks were out of this world. They were so tender, it was steaks that literally melted in your mouth and the taste was amazing. The seasoning tasted like a simple salt and pepper but it was a very good  blend and had a great balance! We had sauces to compliment our steaks (not that the steaks needed them) but we had garlic cilantro,  bernaise, merlot, and  bleu cheese sauces. All were great but we liked the garlic cilantro one the most. We then topped it off with dessert, new york cheese cake and creme brule. The crem brule was great custard had a nice texture and the caramelized top was done to perfection!! My moms cheesecake was to die for, it tasted unlike any cheesecake I had before and that was a good thing. You could actually taste the cheeses and it was awesome!

I have to say, I don't understand all the rave reviews. The hostess was barely nice - didn't seem to care. The waitress kept looking away while we were talking to her and having conversations with guests at other tables while we were ordering. Don't get me wrong, she was nice, just not as professional as I would expect at a place in this price range - really ruins the experience. For example, my husband ordered the porterhouse with a lobster tail and she forgot the lobster, so after his steak arrived, he had to wait 10 more minutes for his lobster. I think she wasn't really paying attention when we were ordering. On the plus side, they were really fast with the food. 

The pretzel bread is great and I definitely recommend the lobster rolls for an appetizer. 

I ordered the surf n turf. The lobster tail was huge which was great, but didn't taste very good - and I love lobster. The filet mignon was just okay and honestly I've had better at Outback Steakhouse for half the price. 

My husband thought his steak was good, but not great. And for some reason his lobster tail tasted much better than mine. Though still not awesome. 

The whole menu is al la carte so every side is an additional $6. I paid $60 for a tiny mediocre filet and one lobster tail and I can't even get some steamed broccoli with it?

Our evening started with lackluster bar service. I suppose I expected a higher quality of bar service for what we were about to pay for dinner and not a woman with the sniffles, inappropriate tattoos for a steak house environment and a bad attitude. 

We were able to place our order with the waitress within 5 minutes of being seated. About 10 minutes later our food was brought out to us. This surprised me since our steaks were ordered medium well and well done but the presentation of our dinner was beautiful. 

Steak is a strange creature. So many people like it prepared so many different ways. What one sees as medium well another sees as rare, what one sees at medium another seems as well done. The chefs at the Charcoal Room must have 20/20 vision as they did an amazing job with our steaks and they were delicious. 

The plan was to stay and have two glasses of wine with a decadent dessert but that plan was thwarted by the earlier experience with the bartender. Maybe I should thank her.

Came here with a large group for a birthday reservation, and service was very polite but spotty- timing of dishes was off and a couple of orders were mixed up.

I opted for the seared ahi app and the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad. The ahi was a generous portion for $10, perfectly seared, and I enjoyed the tamari soy sauce but did not care at all for the wasabi cream. The salad was a disappointing mess of underripe tomatoes and flavorless ""mozzarella""- it didn't even seem to be that cheese, the texture was crumbly and it was dry and flavorless rather than soft and mild. 

This location does not have a private room, but they were able to place us toward the back for some privacy. We were informed from the start that they were unable to do separate checks, which was a bit frustrating and led to several of our party using the $4/fee ATM outside.

The sides were both amazing; the mac-n-cheese tasted like my homemade (I use the best cheese in mine), and the s.o. loved his chowder. My cheesecake slice was enormous, and the texture was sooooo smooth. ALL of the portions were huge...I ended up having most of the cheesecake for breakfast the next day; and we had a 2nd steak dinner the next night, with our leftovers :-)
The price is well under that of most Strip steakhouses or gourmet rooms. They had a decent selection of beers, wines, after-dinner ports (etc.) too. I would highly recommend this as a place to take guests, have birthdays, etc. It sure made our plain old Sunday really special!

2140508,2017-06-04,0,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"I'm always excited to try a new steakhouse, but the Charcoal Room inside of Santa Fe Station unfortunately did not live up to my expectations.

The decor was lovely, all red and dark wood with lots of cozy circular booths. They had a singer in the front performing a variety of songs with a guitar. Service was pretty good, no major complaints there. Pricing looked very fair, especially given we were pretty far off of the Strip.

So, what made the Charcoal Room less than stellar? What should have been the star of the show- the steak. I'll get to that shortly. 

First, the good stuff. My crab cake appetizer was pretty tasty and a good portion. The crab wasn't lump crab meat and tasted like it was deep fried, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The creamed spinach was perfect- tasty, creamy, and seasoned well. The mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms were also very good.

But the steak. Before I ordered, I asked our server the difference between their medium rare and the medium, because I know that some chefs prepare their steaks differently. He told me that medium rare would be pretty bloody, while medium would have a warm pink center. So I went with medium.

Sigh. It was barely pink and extremely tough. I was disappointed. The flavor was good, but I was filled with regret for not going with medium rare.

I thought dessert would help things, but it didn't. The carrot cake was store bought, and not only did it taste that way, the paper between layers was still in the cake- I got a mouthful of it on my first bite, before I saw it and pulled it out. Not good.

The sides, decor, and service are what pulled this to a 3 star review. Everything else- meh.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,3,0,3,rC8YuvaSbUTF8-5nVJFtgQ

it's as if i'm somehow getting lucky while everyone else is striking out.
that sux!!!

the charcoal room is definitely one of those places that i wish all of you who had bad experiences there had dined with me instead.
the outcome would've been quite different, i think.

we've eaten here 3 times and, each time, we've had nothing short of a positive, satisfying experience.
i always order a fish of some sort and have never had any complaints.
it's always seasoned well and cooked to my liking which is to say a perfectly medium rare piece.
my hubby always orders a steak and it has been consistently good.

but what i like most about this steakhouse, especially compared to other station casino steakhouses, are the sides and apps.
where most steakhouses put little care into their side dishes, the charcoal room seems to realize that the accompaniments and the main entree are of equal importance.
is there anything worse than having a delicious entree when the rest of the food sucks?
sometimes i judge a restaurant on whether or not the greens remain crunchy after being cooked.
i absolutely hate soggy greens.
charcoal room has never served me a soggy vegetable.
that's a huge plus, in my book.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,3,3,5,VaOS4XShBao_3oumqpFDDQ

Tastefully decorated in browns and reds, the room is very warm and inviting. This was actually my first time trying any Charcoal Room as a group of six of us were here to celebrate a friends birthday. 

Items ordered..

- Bone-in New York Steak (5/5) Seriously one huge slab of meat! The pics do NOT do it justice! Perfectly cooked medium. That sucker never stood a chance! Very tasty. Very juicy. Absolutely scrumptious! ($32)

- Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes (4/5) Good sized portion, especially for the price. Very delicious. ($6)

- Mac and Cheese (regular) (4/5) Again, a very generous portion and very tasty mac and cheese! Nice crusty topping with plenty of cheesy goodness just below! ($6)

-Tater tots (3/5) Basket full of tots. Once again, a very generous portion. They were okay. Maybe they just couldn't keep up with the rest of the items we ordered, but they certainly weren't bad. I probably wouldn't get them next time, though.  ($6)

- Service was fantastic! We were treated VERY well here! We were seated immediately. Glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We were served plenty of bread. Our server was very outgoing and friendly. I was quite pleased with the service we got here.

Actually, I was quite pleased with our whole experience here! You really get a lot of value for what you pay here! The prices are a fraction of what you might pay at other places, but you don't have to sacrifice great food and great service for it! I can't wait to come back!

As for the food, the first time went, I started off with the Bacon covered BBQ shrimps. Presentation was good, taste was great, I really loved it a lot. I would of order it again, but with the fact of my wife sharing her BBQ boneless baby back ribs, last trip, I loved those even more. So, on this visit, I just had to order a plate, for me.

When I ordered my drinks, he asked if I had been there before & I said, ""yes.""

I was impressed that he remembered me.

Later, Amber came along to take my order. 

I decided to try a new offering: honey glazed pork belly.

I also ordered the large fillet mignon with hollandaise sauce and a side of Mac n cheese.

I loved the pretzel bread so much from my first visit that I was given just that.

Same thing, warm bread and room temperature butter. So delicious!

And shortly after my starter arrived and what a combination!

The pork belly was tender, great flavor and nestled on a small bed of spring greens, and the tartness of the balsamic drizzle mixed paired well with the honey glaze. 

My steak and Mac n cheese arrived at the same time. 

WoW! 

The steak cooked perfectly cooked rare and seasoned that when cutting into it, was effortless. 

Dipped in a creamy hollandaise sauce made the two a perfect match.

The Mac n cheese topped with nice toasty bread crumbs with a cheesy, creamy body put my meal all together.

I like this place.

Anthony was there to just act as if did something and have us the bill and quickly turned to what seemed like regulars.  
The food was fabulous. The owner walked passed twice and asked how was everything ?But didn't stop to listen to our response. I noticed she did stop to ask the same question to others too but then did listen for there reply.

There!  See, that wasn't too bad.  Were now back in 2006.  October 2006, to be more precise.  Now here's my review...

My wife and I celebrated our three-year wedding anniversary at The Charcoal Room, a cozy little steakhouse located inside Santa Fe Station (a ""local's casino"" situated in the northwest part of town). In the more than ten years that we've been together, we've had the pleasure of dining at several fine restaurants across the country, from Aureole in New York City to Donovan's in La Jolla. And, as denizens of Sin City, we've also experienced some of the best food and beverage offerings available on the infamous Las Vegas Strip. I guess you can say that we are ""foodies"" by definition, and as such it takes quite a bit to impress us. With that said, however, the folks at The Charcoal Room did just that.

The place was pretty empty when we got there. I think there may have been two other occupied tables in the room and maybe two or three people at the bar. Needless to say, I would've been really disappointed if the service had left us wanting. The good news is that our server, I want to say his name was Anthony, and his assistants did very well. They were attentive, upbeat, speedy, and they demonstrated well-polished tableside manners. No complaints about the wait staff here!

Timing-wise, everything came out properly.

Where this restaurant really surprises and delights is in the quality of its food. Here's what we ordered:

    * Bacon-Wrapped Scallops (as our appetizer)
    * Glass of Pinot Noir - one of Francis Coppola's reds
    * Caesar Salad for Two
    * 12oz Filet Mignon - Medium but Charred (for me)
    * 12oz Filet Mignon - Medium Well (for my wife)
    * Au Gratin Potatoes
    * Sautéed Mushrooms
    * Some kind of chocolate cake and molten peanut butter confection

Phenomenal food! With the restaurant's pricing, I was expecting the food quality to register just a notch or two above what's available at Outback Steakhouse (the filets were only USD$30 each). But when I cut into my tender morsel of red meat goodness and chomped down on that sucker, boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Perfectly charred on the outside, just right in the middle, and superbly flavored. And the rest of the food was equally as good!

Compared to certain overpriced and overhyped rooms (i.e., the ""fine"" steakhouse located inside the Bellagio), The Charcoal Room is a breath of fresh air.

So far, I believe the best steak in town is offered at Del Frisco's. Second best can be found at Craftsteak inside the MGM Grand. Third best is served up at Fiore's Steakhouse inside The Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino. Fourth calls Delmonico's at The Venetian its home. The fifth best steak is delivered by the talented folks at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Las Vegas. And sixth best? You guessed it, The Charcoal Room. Not bad for a ""local's"" restaurant, methinks.

3970080,2016-04-20,7,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"I made a reservation for 6 PM and arrived a few minutes in advance.  I was shown to a table in the bar area which was OK because I watched the baseball game during the meal.

I ordered my iced tea, got some bread, and got ready to enjoy a steak.  I only ate one piece of bread--the salted pretzel bread.  Very good.  

I started with a lobster chowder which was a lot like New England clam chowder but with lobster.  There was a good amount of lobster and the chowder was good.

Next, I had the bone in ribeye cooked blue.  The waiter said they averaged 22 to 24 ounces with the bone.  It was a nicely cooked large steak done almost perfectly.  The steak evidently wasn't pre-seasoned with any salt and pepper and I found myself putting salt on the steak.  As a side, I got the grilled corn with chipotle mayo.  That was the standout dish of the night.  The mayo and a nice spicy kick from the chipotle and when mixed into the corn, it made for a great side.

For dessert, they bring a cart to your table and show you the goods.  I went with the carrot cake.  The cake was quite large and it was very good.  The interesting thing about the carrot cake were the thin carrot shreds that were lightly candied giving a crunchy texture to the cake.  It almost seemed like the carrot shreds had been fried although they weren't.  Very nice touch.

Service was very good throughout.  My iced tea was refilled without needing to ask.  There's one suggestion I'd make.  I know you want to show an open restaurant to your clients, but when I'm in a casino steakhouse, I'd rather have the doors shut so I don't listen to slot machine sounds during dinner.

They changed the menu about a month ago and downgraded on the quality. They still have Ahi Tuna on the appetizer menu but it is not the same quality as in the past.  It tasted ""off"" and didn't even look edible.  My friend ordered the Chopped salad and the portion is about 2/3 of what it used to be on the old menu.  The bread basket consisted of 4 tiny pieces of bread that looked like it had seen better days.  They also took away the flatbread - which was the best part of the bread basket!

They changed the wine menu and my pour for a $16 glass of Peju was awful - if I was a bartender I would be embarrassed serving such a paltry amount.

Even the service was bad.  One bartender (new) who ignored us the the entire time.

Note to management:  Either restore the old menu and raise the prices or change the restaurant to a more casual atmosphere where you can get away with serving cheap food.",nrMef8kED1ZwlLkcm1XfzQ,4,0,1,i6ckUh5W8c3eSX73kAYaVQ
4053149,2014-05-30,20,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"Finally!! 

I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sautéed mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  

I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.

Last week my husband and I went to T-Bones Chophouse at Red Rock, and it made me miss The Charcoal Room.  So this week we made our reservations, and I had one thing on my mind, boneless baby back ribs.  My most favorite thing here has changed.  I thought they were made of pork but these were beef and seemed like instead of baby backs, they were more like spare ribs.  They changed the meat and the quality on me and kept the price.  Sad day. 

We had reservations at five, but they didn't open on time.  Service wasn't as good as it was before and I felt like we got a little attitude because we didn't order alcohol.  The last slap was a cheap ""Thank You"" take out bag and generic Styrofoam to go containers instead of the classic red string reusable bag they had before.  I know it seems silly, but if you are spending sixty dollars plus a head for dinner, dressing up and bother to make a reservation, you want a good experience right down the the last detail.

I started with the chopped salad, which was good but not quite as good as its cousin at the Texas (could be how they routinely prepare it here, or just the chef who made it). 

Entree was the bone-in rib-eye, which was cooked perfectly. I'm picky when it comes to the doneness of my steaks. I asked our waiter how the chef that evening cooked, and was advised to order a little underdone, so I went with rare+. Delightfully, a perfect medium rare arrived. I think if I cared less, just going medium rare would have been satisfactory but it was nice that the server knew what to expect. The cilantro sauce is the tastiest sauce ever, I would have it with every meal. Thank me later. I had the sweet potato as a side...it was a sweet potato. 

Service was excellent. In addition to knowing the chef's tendencies, our server was keen on spotting dropped napkins and less than full drinks. Friendly, just the right amount of attention, and knew the restaurant well.

Our server checked on his other tables 5-6x. He checked on us 1x. We had to ask the manager for refills on our drinks and also for the check! The white wine sauce on the chicken was not reduced enough so it tasted like creamy white wine (yuck). The filet was full if fat and the mashed potatoes were severely lacking seasoning. Not in any shape or form what you would expect from 150$ dinner! Still angry I paid that much! Will never be back",HT4r0tWm2D4TsUa3q9i-Rw,4,0,1,Gb11M7L7srhZD3deOFYJTQ

We come pretty much every week and are guests.
We are professional people, lawyers, doctors, etc. We dress nice, spend a lot of money and tip well. Maybe one cuss word came out in passing from a friend, but geeze sometimes that happens when you sit at a bar and have drinks with friends. 

I spoke to the manager about it who was very smug and said that other guests were not being as loud and wanted to enjoy their dinner without noise. I'm sorry, but you have a bar. If you sit next to a bar there is going to be loud noise. It was more in the manner the manager said it. He could have just politely asked us to keep the volume down, offered to move us somewhere more secluded or just been a descent human being.

5028815,2012-04-04,1,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station

A popular restaurant for locals - famous for its heavenly filet mignon & lobster. BUT, the service should be better!

The Yelpy Version:
- One early evening in late March, our friends treated my wife and myself to an incredible dinner at this nice, popular restaurant inside Santa Fe Station Casino. We all had its famous ""Wed Special"" of ""Lobster/Filet Mignon ($30) Combo"". We were all absolutely delighted with the food and wine! The lobster tasted fresh and joicy, and the filet mignon absolutely heavenly - melting in your mouth with delicious flavors! We also had their Marinated Shrimps (actually large prawns!) apetizer, which was very tasty! Our friends ordered a bottle of Cabinet Sauvignon theyliked but it was sold out. Our nice server offered us a $65/bottle of an alternative brand for $35, and it was rich, smooth and flavorful! Great!

The Charcoal Room has a ""medium-high-end"" type of decor, but gives a casual, inviting ambience. It has a huge, beautiful sports bar, which offered $5 Happy Hour drinks and was completely full around 5:30pm.At our departure around 7:30pm, the restaurant was almost completely full.

The serving staff that evening was probably overwhelmed by the large dinner crowd. The service was good at the beginning, but the follow up service was SUB-Par, when it got busier. It was difficult to get server's attention even to order coffee and desert;harder still to get refills for coffee and water!

ADDITIONAL comments for management's kind consideration.
- Even though the food, drinks were superb and the ambience was great, BUT...
1. PLEASE do TRAIN ALL servers to be ATTENTIVE to ALL tables, even those not assigned to them.
- It'd be nice if a server would acknowledge a guest, raising his/her hand trying hard to get attention! Please letthe guest know that his/herserver is busy at the moment but will be notified to come over. - As one knows,
""Psychologically, a customer is MOST ANNOYED and UNHAPPY if he feels being IGNORED by a server""!

2. During our meal, the manager was nice enough to come over for a quick chat, which made us all feel welcome, BUT incredibly, this same manager just ignored us when we were getting out of the restaurant door, where he was standing nearby! At departure, we were asking the hostess about the Happy Hour specials. Thehostess aparently did not know the details. This manager standing nearby was talking to another staff member; he could hear us but chose to just ignore us! - He did NOT even try to help out the poor hostess in answering our important question, nor did he take the opportunity to say goodbye to us. To us, this was NOT good to leave customers with such an unsatisfying ""Parting Impression""! Whatever browny points he had earned by coming over to our table earlier to chat were completely lost when he ignored us, while standing near us, at our departure!

Simply put, absolutely fantastic! We had lobster and filet. Quality was spot-on!

Food is always perfectly cooked and seasoned, portions generous and delicious. 
This has become my regular fine dining restaurant, no need to drive to the strip or anywhere when I have perfection a mile from home.

The service was and is excellent and the atmosphere was and is perfect.
I get the same thing every time:
The Charcoal Room Chopped Salad: Perhaps one of the best salads I've ever had.
I was in the mood for the the lobster mac-'n'-cheese: Which was fine.
But, then came the t-bone steak, and this is what took away three stars - It used to be great, but the quality of the meat recently has diminished substantially.
I've got the stomach of a billy goat.
There is nothing on this planet, that I can't eat.
And I've never not finished a plate of food that's been put in front of me...
Until I got that t-bone.
When the waiter came over to ask how everything was, I told him to take a seat at the table, and proceeded to give him a 2-minute lecture about how I could have spent $5 at Von's and got a better piece of meat than what they were charging me $45 for.
I read some of the other recent reviews, and I scratch my head. Is there another Charcoal Room at the Santa Fe that I'm missing?
To each his own, I guess.
Anyway, steak is my thing (I eat 4-5 steaks per week), and this place just doesn't cut the mustard anymore.

Our daughter had the roasted chicken, her boyfriend had the strip steak, the husband had the strip steak and I had the king cut prime rib. The prime rib was charred nicely on the outside and was a perfect shade of rare with horseradish on the side. Sides were the au gratin potatoes which were the best au gratin potatoes my husband has ever had. The creamed corn had diced pieces of poblano peppers and was very flavorful.

Tried the chocolate banana martini which was fantastic but for some reason had a salted rim, not a fan. The daughter tried the melon martini and tasted a bit like an alcohol version of ecto cooler from kool aid, this is good. 

Our server was attentive and brought out a chocolate cake for our daughter's 22nd birthday. Great selection of wines and I finished with the turtle cheesecake and a tawny port for the night. Santa Fe did send me a $25 coupon for the Charcoal Room and it was much appreciated. 

The chef stopped by our table to inquire about the daughter not eating most of her chicken and she was just too full from our appetizers and the bread basket. The pretzel bread in the bread basket is awesome. Try to save room from dinner. I ate at least half of the pretzel bread and was fighting over it with the daughter.

And appetizers the oysters on the half shell are nice sized, great amount of fresh horseradish and fresh as can be. The seared ahi tuna with wasabi cream is tasty and nicely presented.

5181371,2008-06-11,0,Cr-ywH3ZjBqCyolXf8BpVA,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary.  We wanted to have a good meal and we didn't want to have to travel far.  This place was perfect for all of the above.  

At the table there is a basket of assorted breads.  I think there were 3 or 4 different types.  I'm a bread whore loving any starchy products so this was a very nice surprise.  With the bread was softened butter.  
This really is key when serving bread, cold butter just doesn't work.  

We also had a couple of drinks.  I always have to try the lemon drop martini.  This one was wonderful.  Fresh lemon juice and the right amount of sugar.  Fresh lemons are key, I can always tell when it isn't .  

We started with a crab cake appetizer ($12).  It came with 2 nicely-sized cakes.  They were nice and crisp on the outside and completely filled with juicy lump crab on the inside.  I love crab, but a good crab cake is hard to find.  This one was one of the best I've tasted.  It didn't come with any fancy sauces (didn't need ANYTHING extra) because it was just simple and great.  Very light on the breading and heavy on the crab, the way it should be.

We next split a Caesar Salad ($7).  It was good, nothing really spectacular.  It did come with 3 cheese-baked bread slices.

Then the main meal, our 24oz. porterhouse steak ($32) with sides of baked potato, baked sweet potato, and asparagus with a side of hollandaise (all $6 each).  The steak was cooked perfectly, tons of flavor needing to add nothing to it.  The sides were as you would expect them to be, nothing real extraordinary but how can you mess-up a baked potato?

One of the things that I enjoyed most was the way they split everything.  The runner brings the food fully plated to the table with 2 extra plates and splits it in front of us, instead of the back.  Even the steak, he cut each in half (fillet side and New York side) and put them on our plates for us.  This was so great!

It was so different when we had dinner there on Tuesday June 5th arriving at around 7:00pm and sat at the bar.  It took awhile to get waited on and after getting our drinks we discovered that the bartender was a temporary and did not know the menu and she was not the only new or temporary staff working that night.  We were disappointed that they no longer offered the 28 day aged top sirloin.  So, we ordered the prime rib between rare and medium or rare plus.  After a long wait a staffer brought out our entire order with the salad.  It was obvious he had not been trained to bring the salad first and then follow with the entre.  The prime rib came out well done and we sent it back.  Again after a wait we were told that the kitchen only had well done left, so we ordered a different entre.  Unusual since this was fairly early in the evening and they were not busy.  After dinner we asked for our bill.  I had to remind the bartender a second time that we wanted our bill.  Finally she brought it, but the itemized bill was not included.  We asked for the itemized copy, but se did not know how to recover it and after again a long wait we left without it.

Well, that was a huge mistake! The food was awful, terrible service and the ambience has a lot to be desired!

Green Valley Ranch is were we had celebrated our previous year anniversary which was at Hank's Fine Steaks Restaurant!

At Hank's Fine Steaks Restaurant, the food was delicious, the service was superb and the ambience was beautiful and relaxing!

Whereas, the Charcoal Room Restaurant is totally the opposite of the spectrum!

In fact, I should have tipped the waitress $1 or better yet, one penny! She definitely did NOT deserve my hard-earned money!!!

It was the WORST dinner we have ever had!

My husband ended up in the restroom the majority of the night and I ended up throwing up my dinner!

  The pretzel bread sticks are fabulous, arriving at the table piping hot, soft and salty.  I ate the two that were in the bread basket.    None for my boyfriend.  There was other bread in the basket, though.
  The Caesar salad is good, with small pieces of crusty bread as the crouton-like accompaniments.  A generous helping, I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for the main course.
  The half roasted chicken is tasty.  I ate the breast and took the leg/thigh home.  That sounds a little strange.
  The baked sweet potato is huge!  Regular butter and cinnamon butter are provided; put them on the spud, watch them melt, and consume. I ate half there and took the other half home, too.
  This is a great place for date night, which we had the night we went.
  The service is attentive. The manager came by our table and checked on us.
  Sunday night was so steady for them that there were no booths available, so we were seated at a round table that sat four.  I always prefer booths unless with a large group of friends. Not that we are the type of couple to sit side by side in a booth when it's just us, because that's weird, but I didn't feel like waiting. Reservations are suggested just in case, which we had.

The tables are too close together, the pretzel bread is great, and the steak is good and tender.  Although, mine arrive ""warm,"" and I usually prefer it more ""hot.""

Anyway my biggest BEEF with this steak place is this:  They have a happy hour but when sitting for dinner, I am told ""this is only at the bar.""  Which is...ten feet from my table.  So what is it, I should in a blazing moment of cheap glory rise from my seat, walk to the bar and order drinks there where they are basically half off?  Or I can order from my waitress and pay full price.  I just think this is so absurd.  For a somewhat expensive place you'd think they could do you the courtesy of pricing the drinks the same at your table vs. the bar.
