I tried the noodles.. OMG, the best noodles I have had in Vegas. The beef was thin, flavorful, and very tender. I gave a couple of noodles to my dog, and she agreed they were great. I ate what I could (I'm a big guy btw) and put the rest in the fridge for lunch the next day. The only thing is the dish was described as spicy on the menu.

303436,2011-12-19,1,td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg,"Man I love me some noodles and I've been dying to try this place.  Problem is, it's on the other end of town and I wasn't sure if there was even anything I could eat, being a vegetarian and all.  We tried calling ahead to see if there's anything suitable for vegetarians on the menu, but we were having a little bit of a language barrier.  The super cute voice on the line told me that I just need to come in and let them know I was veg and they'll find something for me.  Well, ok I guess we'll give it a shot....

We got to Beijing Noodle Cafe and it's just a small place and nothing super fancy.  But nondescript places like these are the ones I always end up falling in love with.  When I got inside, I met the cute little voice I talked to on the phone and she ended up being a cute little lady that tried her best to answer our questions.  But, unfortunately, there was still a bit of a language barrier.  I asked several times if there was any chicken broth or fish-based sauces in the meat-free menu items and she said that they were ok.  I'm just hoping that they were alright- especially since they were amazing and I want to go back.  Like, today.

We started with the vegetable pancake and it was soooo good.  It was nicely fried without being greasy and it tasted great with the sweet soy sauce.  My husband ordered the Kung Pao Tofu and it had a nice blend of fried tofu, veggies, sauce, and of course those incredible noodles.  The noodles were nice and chewy and perfectly cooked.  The portion was huge and he was in love.

I originally ordered the Homemade Tofu, but the owner(? chef?) stopped over to the table and said he recommended the Tomato Egg Noodle Soup.  I again asked if there was chicken broth or anything non-veg and they said it was ok.  I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to like it since tomato and egg doesn't really seem like the best combo (scrambled eggs with ketchup baffles me)- but I decided that I was in for adventure.  So, I heeded the words of the random guy.

Usually my instinct is right, but I am more than happy to say it was wrong this day.  Mr. Random Guy gave me some excellent advice because the Tomato Egg Noodle Soup was amazing.  The broth had a lot of flavor from the tomatoes, egg, and soy and it worked great with those yumtastic homemade noodles.  I slurped it down and smiled contently while hoping that my husband wouldn't want to steal them from me.  He did.  My husband isn't a big fan of eggs and even he gobbled up this delicious soup.

With bellies full to the brim, we got the check and saw a grand total of..... 21 dollars.  21 bucks for a ton of food!  Between the price, the friendliness of the staff, and the overall goodness of our food, I think it's fair to give this place 5 stars.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,3,3,5,On9R1gzVivWZNH56UBHv8A

One of my most vivid memories is when our tour group spent the day at Tiananmen Square, and that evening, our tour guide took us to a famous noodle shop that had a glass wall separating the chefs from the dining room so we could observe them hand pulling noodles and cooking them to order.

At that point I had no idea that this technique even existed and it was seared in my mind. It's been over a decade now since I experienced that magical day in Beijing, and it all came rushing back just last week when a friend drug me across town to try this unassuming ""hole-in-the-wall.""

Let me be clear; I'm no expert on Beijing Noodels, but there's no denying the flavors and textures in the Lan Zhou Beef Noodle bowl. Delicious! Add on top of that some home made chili oil and dollar for dollar, it is probably one of the best lunches in town.

I mean come on; the guy is hand pulling noodles! What else do you really want from a noodle shop!

Food (3.5/5):
- Beef Noodle Soup:  Really tasty!  Love the handmade noodles. I'd say this was the favorite from the group because it was so flavorful.
- Lan Zhou Beef Noodle: This was the most popular dish based on Yelp reviews and our waitress. It wasn't bad-- love the taste of it!
- Chicken Soup:  Decent... not memorable though.  I'd pass on this one.  The noodles were good though.
- Pork and Mushroom Noodles: This was a saucy noodle, but loved all the big fat mushrooms that came with the noodles. The pork was REALLY FATTY, so I had to pick off the fat in order to save myself from having clogged arteries.  I would order this again... but maybe ask for leaner meat? 
- Homemade noodles:  Definitely the star of the show was the homemade noodles (rather than the broth, soup, sauce, etc.).

You definitely have to drive out here, so don't come unless you have a car!

Service (3/5):  It's what you expect from a Chinese restaurant-- no frills; just get your food and tea and that's about it.  haha.

Like Cory B., I almost didn't want to share a good review of Beijing Noodle Cafe because I want to keep it to myself however the food is too good not to write about!

Upon Yelp recommendations I've ordered the Lan zhou beef noodle soup which is the perfect cold weather soup and good enough to crave in the blistering summer months. The broth is rich without being overly salty and the beef to noodle proportion is perfect! The beef is tender and sliced perfectly thin, but the mushrooms in this soup are the real winner. I' m not sure what kind they are, but for me the texture was really...satisfying. They're soft with a little crunch and give the broth the edge that has me daydreaming about the soup on sad lunch days at work (you know, those days where you end up with a bag of baby carrots and a handful of wheat thins out of unpreparedness or lack of time).

I've also had the Szechwan eggplant which was filling enough to make this carnivore happy.  I've had the pork and chive potstickers and the pork wonton in red chili sauce as appetizers-of the two I liked the wontons better, but both were delicious! The chives were a little overwhelming for me in the potstickers, but they came with a great dipping sauce that helped mellow them out.

My only ding would be service which can be spotty but friendly. They don't  have a soda fountain so their beverages come out of cans. They also don't serve Coke products which I found out upon being served a Diet Pepsi without being asked.

This place is ridiculously cheap-almost so much so that it feels like stealing when the check comes.  There's nothing fancy about Beijing Noodle Cafe but the food is all the fancy that you'll need. The dishes are large enough to share, so come with friends and have everyone order something different!

Anyway, I made a call for pick up the other day and was confused when the girl on the line kept telling me that they didn't have my beloved schezuan eggpant noodles, or my pork wontons in red chile sauce....I thought maybe they had run out?  I end up ordering some egg fu yung and beef & broccoli noodles (I've had both before from here.  Delicious.) 

I pull up to the restaurant and walk up to the door, to find a new paper menu taped to the door!  I was beyond shocked because the restaurant bares the same name, signage and made no mention as to their new ownership when I was trying to order my ""the usual"".   

I walk in to an empty restaurant and ask the girl about the ownership.   She told me they have new owners and a new menu.  I leave feeling pretty bummed, but willing to give it a try, because I can't walk out and I'm hungry.  

I drive home (15-20) and pull out my dishes....gross.  The egg fu yung's brown sauce was filled, literally to the brim of the styrofoam packaging.  The gravy was broken and had about an inch of oil on the top of it.  I took out a patty and took a bite, LAVA hot.  The noodles for the beef and broccoli weren't fresh at all and adding a traditional beef and broccoli (from PANDA EXPRESS) over some boxed noodles, was not what I am looking for at all.

First, I have to say that the food was very fresh and very affordable.  I could taste the freshness in every ingredient, and the flavors were fantastic.

For appetizers, we tried the pork & chive pot stickers and the veggie pancake.  Loved the pot stickers, could very well be the best I've ever had.  It was nice actually tasting the filling and not having it be just a small glob of vague meat paste inside a dumpling.  I wasn't thrilled with the veggie pancake, however, it had virtually no flavor. (and that's the reason I'm not giving them 5 stars).

I ordered the chicken szechuan noodles and my hubby ordered the mongolian beef noodles.  The food arrived but my order was wrong - and, amazingly, the waitress apologized for getting my order wrong and went back to put the correct order in.  I can't recall another occasion where a wait person admitted their error - and I was impressed with her honesty.  I knew I hadn't ordered a different dish, but it was nice that she didn't try to convince me that I somehow had mistakenly said the word zucchini instead of chicken.. nor did she blame it on the cooks.

While I waited for my entree, I tasted hubby's mongolian beef (we both ordered handcut noodles) and it was delicious.  My own entree arrived shortly afterwards and mine was scrumptious also.  Oh, and be warned.. when they say a dish is spicy, they're actually putting hot peppers in it!  Mine was spicy and delicious and I even enjoyed eating chunks of celery so long as it was covered in their sauce.  The meat in both dishes was quality trimmed, no chunks of fat or gristle in either of our bowls.

Hubby had about half his entree to box up when we were full, I had about 2/3 of mine - and our bill was under $30.  We will definitely be going back there!",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,2,2,4,NfgbB6lDmRaU4ZR_mU2yPg

I snuck in here preYelp and tried the General Tso's chicken of the $5.95 lunch menu.  At the time I thought it was fare compared to other General dishes I have eaten in the valley.

I thought I would wait to write a review after visiting it for second time and trying one of the noodle dishes.

Judd L. writes a great review as to the decor and a bit of the history on where this place came from.

Today I came in and was greeted by an extremely sweet lady that is the owner. 

She gave me a run down on the various noodle dishes, the size of the noodles and the many different ways I could eat them. 

I settled on a recommendation of noodle soup containing beef ""nuggets"" cost..$6.95.

In addition to the meal I also ordered up some pork and chive potstickers as an appetizer.

The potstickers arrived and were unlike any potsticker I have ever seen or tasted.  They were all stuck together in a circular shape.  The shell was delicate and had a sweet taste to it.  The mixture inside was divine and not overly cooked.

My soup arrived shortly after that.

The soup was a hearty beef stock infused with chili oil.  There was a some kind of cabbage and mushrooms in it as well.  The ""nuggets"" were actually small tender pieces of beef.  The noodles were absolutely amazing.

I am not one that will throw out a five star rating.  Some have asked what does a place have to do to get a five star rating?  My explanation is that I want to feel something that stimulates the production of dopamine and adrenaline in my body.

After consuming my tasty lunch, I think I actually caught a buzz from the nutrients or whatever else was in my meal!  Now thats a five star experience!

For the entree, I had the mushroom egg stir fry noodle and the beef noodle soup. You have the option of knife shaved noodle or just the long ones. My favorite between the two would have to be the beef noodle one because it had such as strong flavor and noodles were extra chewy just the way I like. The mushroom one was kind of bland but it was still filled with lots of mushrooms.  Noodles were about $7 a bowl.

Beijing Noodle Cafe has become one of my regular spots. They make their noodles fresh and in-house, which is something you will have a hard time finding anywhere else in Vegas. It makes a huge difference. You can order noodles round or flat, and I think each type fits best in certain dishes. So far, I recommend that everyone absolutely must try:

- Sliced pork and mushroom (round noodles)
- Szechuan dan dan (round noodles)
- Kung pao (flat noodles)
- Tomato & egg sauce (flat noodles) * this one was unexpectedly enjoyable. It's somewhat similar to tomato soup (a-la Campbell's) with noodles added and sews together Asian flavors surprisingly well.

And the one thing I don't recommend is the ma po tofu. I'm a big fan of ma po tofu, but this place makes it with excessive chili seeds, and they are so hard and woody that they detract from the hearty flavor of the dish.

I'm a little partial because it's the best place close to my house, but it is also some of the most authentic Chinese food in town.  Most people are used to southern-HK style Chinese cooking, which is also very tasty - but different.  Northern Chinese cooking has a different group of flavors and tends to be much more carb-heavy.  

I've eaten here a few times and usually have some sort of noodle dish.  My favorite is the pork and mushroom noodles, but I've also had the beef noodle soup, the beef and broccoli noodles and the kung pao, along with the wontons.  The lunch specials are very generous and at about $6, one of the best deals around.  Why eat fast food when you can have a hearty meal for the same price?

Everything is so very tasty.  The flavors are well developed, the noodles are fantastic.  I also recently found that they take online orders for both takeout and delivery.  An extra bit of awesomeness.",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,0,0,5,p-yIsOHJfnRBzjT7XJzeiA

I was specifically advised to get their hand-pulled noodles so I went with the following:

Spicy wonton appetizer with chili sauce-  I was skeptical since this is a traditional Szechuan dish and while the sauce was up to par in flavor, the wontons themselves were off the mark.  They were like little flat ravioli with a hint of meat and while the pasta portion had a good texture, the ratio of meat to pasta was much too low.  

Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup - A popular street food in the northern Chinese province of its namesake, this dish consists of thin hand pulled noodles with sliced beef, mushrooms, several aromatic freshly chopped herbs, and a nice sheen of chili oil with intense notes of garlic and peppercorns.  Unctuous chewy noodle nirvana which is spicy enough to warm you up on a cold rainy day but not overpowering where you lose sensation on the tongue or end up needing to change your shirt from profuse sweating.  

Dao Xiao Mian(aka ""Knife cut"" noodles)- this dish consists of thick noodles served with a various meats/veggies (I recommend the pork which has a nice layer of crispy fat, along with mushrooms and scrambled egg) to be mixed upon presentation so called because the chef literally takes a long tube of dough and uses a knife to flick the noodles into the boiling pot of water.  Definitely best enjoyed on the premises since there is a tendency for the noodles to clump together over time and it's all about the texture.  If there was a scale for ""al dente"" from 0-10 where zero is the flaccid noodles soaking in water at your local Sbarro, this would register an 11 (as in 1 louder on Spinal Tap).  If you want to go healthier, can opt for a different choice of meat or request that eggs not be included.

The owner's wife was very sweet and attentive and although I did not get the chance to see the noodles made, I have read in other reviews that he occasionally comes out to do public noodle pullings on request.  Ambience is a little drab with a predominant red hue, but based on the strip mall where it is located, one might as well have the complete hole-in-the-wall decor to keep it a local secret.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,3,2,4,e2YhnRabmjowpfNVUCrtLw

We started with Fried Wontons, Pork Wontons in Chili Sauce, and Spring Rolls.  They didn't last long - wife was fighting me over the pork wontons - which were great.  She also finished off the fried wontons with cheese. 

For dinner I had the Dan Dan Beef Noodles and wife had lemon chicken (she isn't adventurous).

Finally, we found ourselves in the neighborhood, so we dropped in for lunch.  Cute place.  Clean and quiet.  We were 1 of 3 tables.  The service was quick!  Friendly too.  

After great debate, we decied on the vegetable dumpling/pancake appetizer.  They were ok.  Nothing to get stoked about.  We also had the spicy szechuan eggplant noodles and the Beijing style black sauce (the name escapes me) noodles.  

So...this is how it works.  Apparently, you choose a sauce, such as the two I mentioned, and you can pick a noodle to serve it over.  Well, on the day of our visit, they were out of noodles.  They only had the knife cut noodles. Major bummer.  We were so looking forward to the hand pulled noodles.  Hmphf.  

Regardless, the knife cut noodles were still deliciously homemade with the perfect amount of chew. Since they are handmade, they were all different sizes which caused the texture to change from noodle to noodle.  So, the smaller noodles were a bit mushy and overcooked.   Eggplant sauce was spicy and delicious! A must.

I called here on a Sunday night and they didn't answer. I just wanted to make sure they were open before I made the drive.

I arrive with my cousin to a small restaurant with an odd red tinge in their lighting. Oh, yes! They were open, duh.

I am greeted by the most awkward duo of servers. They both ask how many and wasn't seated until the fourth time; no big deal but I start to think of a possible language barrier-WHICH IS AWESOME!

There menu is small, cute, and cheap.

I hate when menus at restaurants are overly huge..

It consists of different types of noodles and also your typical fair of Chinese food.

I particularly wanted noodles! 

There are no descriptions of the dishes except what their title is so good luck.

Also, our server needed help from the owner ( I think he was the owner ) when taking our orders, not a problem.. Just a note.

After our canned sodas..

We start with the pork dumplings in chili oil. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. The sauce was not spicy. Had it been JUST chili oil, I think the dish would have been more successful. It was just 4.99. Still good.

For my dish I ordered Beijing Noodles in black bean sauce. Since there is no item description, you just have to go by the title. I had no idea what type of other ingredients I'd be getting but the noodles and sauce.

Also, I order sweet and sour pork and Chinese fried rice.

My noodles arrive FAST for a restaurant, but piping hot. 

I look and see meat in the dish and the serving for just over 6 bucks is big and enough to share.

The dish includes noodles, Chinese pickles, horse radish or ginger, and marinated beef chunks. This was really good! You could taste all the single ingredients so each bite was different and tasty depending on what ingredient you got. Also, the noodles are definitely the star of the dish as the other ingredients were cut small.

I won't say much about the sweet and sour pork or fried rice except they were really good and what you'd except from a Chinese restaurant. The Chinese sausage fried rice being exceptionally good with nice sized pieces of the Chinese sausage as opposed to little sprinkles of it. The sweet and sour sauce was definitely home made as it had a more gentle taste than those overly sweet versions of the dish.

For two sodas, our appetizer dumplings, a noodle dish, fried rice, and a chicken entree, or meal was $30.00 even.

It was a really good price for the offering and I'll definitely be going back. 

Just some notes:

The place is big but has very limited seating. Four or five booths line one side of the restaurant with a few tables on the opposing side. I'm sure this place gets busy during peak hours.

Also, we were the only non Chinese group there which is awesome because everyone seemed really happy.

Our waitress and our selves may have had a language barrier, but their service is very sweet/sincere/effective and also genuinely wanted us to enjoy the meal.

Lunch specials I believe range from 6 dollars. This includes entree soup or salad and choice of rice. Definitely going to try for lunch!",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,1,0,5,KUH-RtvgZ6bUPMzJCFm5EA

Our favorite dish has to be the Beef Nuggets Noodle Soup (spicy)  So much aroma and spice packed in the broth that our tongue is always dancing after each slurp.

$7.50 for a big, hot, fresh bowl. If they don't make the noodles in-house, then they get them fresh from somewhere. Fresh noodles make a big difference. The beef was how it should be: lots of tendon, fat, bone and no apologies about it all being there. That's flavor country.

Last night had Lan Zhou noodle soup - so complex, spicy, delicious and amazing.  Not easy to share, but I watched in amazement as the chef served it up for us between two bowls and cut the noodles with chopstickx like they were knives... I wish I could do that. 

Bevel knife cut noodles with Spicy Eggplant - brilliant - I almost had to fight my husband for a bite...

Wontons & beef dumplings - impossible to resist and still as the first time I tasted them.

Spicy Tofu -- finally found one thing - only one thing I wasn't crazy about and that in itself is shocking.  But the deal is, I really hate tofu - I just figured if anyplace could make me love it, BNC could...  so I cannot hold it against them...

For the first time, we were honored by their tapioca -- what a treat.  Like dessert caviar...

My husband, who's incredibly difficult to please, fell in love with it as much as I...then asked if we could go every Sunday...  Yes!

It's easy to mess up honey walnut shrimp, but this place did the exact opposite. It seems like they imparted a savory flavor base during the cooking process before adding the creamy sauce. They also let the natural crunchy and juicy texture of the shrimp shine through, and complemented it with a bed of shredded lettuce and the unique addition of some broccoli to the plate.

The walnuts were also really good, not the typical size or shape but still good. I also have my doubts that they actually used mayo, a typical ingredient, in the creamy sauce. If they didn't, then this dish is even more of a masterpiece. And all for a relatively low price of $8.95? Wow.

I also tasted a friend's egg and mushroom noodles. They were really great! I'll have to force myself to do a noodle dish next time. I also tried some fried rice in XO sauce, and it was also delicious. Based on this experience, I can't recommend this place enough.

One thing for certain, I like the flavors here more than Malan which I find slightly bland. The noodles are tender and chewy. After perusing the menu, the owner's husband recommended the following: 

-Special Flavor Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95). Served with slices of marinated beef and wood ear (fungus). The soup base is made from beef stock and a secret blend of 28 spices (and you thought the Colonel used more spices) with Star Anise as the dominant spice. What a wonderful medley of flavors tingling my palate. 

-Special Flavor Tomato Egg Noodle Soup ($6.95). The soup base reminds me of my mother's tomato and egg dish; slightly sweet with a zest of tomato flavor and sprinkling of eggs. 

-Vegetable Dumplings (pan fried $4.95). Perfect for the vegetarian or someone who doesn't want any meat in their dumplings. Instead of the traditional dumplings that are fried individually, the chef made it into a flower shape that you separate into individual pieces. What a neat way to present dumplings! 

Sure, the place is in the wrong side of town for me. But, it is certainly worth the trek.

No, seriously...they are the star of Beijing Noodle Cafe and it would be a crime if you didn't order them.

My trusty Yelp app reminded me I was in the neighborhood and not only did we recently read about this restaurant in the local paper, but Paul Y. was raving about place to the Husband.  

As soon as I checked in, I realized fellow yelper Andy T. was just here and he quickly sent us a message telling us what we had to order!  

Located in a strip mall, this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant is quaint and simply decorated with pictures of the menu items and hanging red lanterns.  Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.

We were given a lunch menu - on one side featured lunch specials, but the other side was where the specialty noodles were offered.  We shared:

* Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles in a very light aromatic broth with wood ear mushrooms and sliced beef.  It was very flavorful and we were quite impressed.

* Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles with a stir-fry of eggplant, tomatoes and garlic sitting on top.  Again, very good and quite rich.  

Although both dishes had the same noodles, they were showcased quite differently in broth versus sauce.  Once you eat a freshly made noodle, it's hard to want anything else.

While we waited for our order, we inquired about when the demonstration for noodle pulling takes place.  The waiter told us that the chef was out, but usually during the evenings.  The chef came in a few minutes later and he started making our noodles.  It was quite impressive and definitely entertaining.  At that point, the female owner explained more about the different sizes of noodles offered (small, medium or large - although she recommends medium), and that they the hand cut noodles into water as well.  (If you've seen Bizarre Foods, you know what I'm talking about here!)  She also mentioned their appetizer dumplings as being made to order.  We initially thought they weren't offered at lunch because it wasn't on the lunch menu we were given and per another yelper's review.  On the contrary, it IS available!  Sweet!  So we added:

* Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce ($4.95) - Twelve little handmade morsels sitting in a deadly chili oil sauce.  They were fresh and light, and not your average wonton.

I tried the black bean pork noodles (forgot the actual name, sorry!) and my honey had the pork & mushroom noodles.  He really loved his.  I liked mine but they were a little salty so I'd probably try something else next time.  I really liked the noodles part of it.  The pork bits were very tiny, I actually wasn't sure which were black beans and which were pork bits until I bit into them.

The place had just opened and was pretty empty when we got there, but they made our food fast and they give you a really big portion for your money.  We also ordered an order of the pork & chive potstickers which I really enjoyed.  They are traditional potstickers where the wrapper actually sticks to the pot and you cut them off - I'd never seen that before but my honey said his childhood friend's asian mom used to make them that way.  Learn something new every day.

If you're on a low carb diet, STOP READING.  Also, this is not for you if your idea of ""authentic Asian cuisine"" comes from a place that serves general tzo's chicken or beef with broccoli chow mien.  Skip if you enjoy eating rehydrated microwaved noodles from a styrofoam bowl.

This is the real deal.  Extremely glutinous, al dente noodles with just the right amount of surface imperfections to hold the sauce or soup.  Enough, it's just good eats!

The sliced pork and mushroom hand pulled noodles that other yelpers rave about is THE standout dish.  Loads of meaty mushrooms and tender pork.  Very flavorful, not too oily.  The beef noodle soup is also a worthy try.  Fresh herbs, ginger, garlic, chilies, and five spice create a very aromatic base for tender beef, mushrooms, and noodles.

Ultimately, the strong flavors, lack of acidity, and the lack of textural contrast fill you up quick.  Avoid the ""eyes bigger than the stomach"" syndrome.  Nothing worse than a carb brick in your stomach and a cloying flavor in your mouth for hours.

Note:  They use MSG with no apology.  You've been warned.

Pork with sliced mushrooms noodles, by far the best dish.  The pork and mushrooms blend in perfectly and absorbs the full flavors along with the noodles.  For just under $7, this is a steal.

The Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle was not as good, but decent.  I was expecting more of a spicy kick but a got a tangy and peanut butter flavor (WTF??).  For under $7, can't complain much.

Beijing Noodle Cafe is what I call a Hidden Las Vegas Gem. I usually use Yelp when I am out of town on tour or vacation. Thankfully I was still in that mind state after returning to LV from a recent tour.  I love Chinese food but since moving to Vegas about 9 years ago from New York I accepted that it is way easier to find great Thai food in LV than Chinese. (I'll write reviews of my favorite Thai spots soon)

My girlfriend and I decided to try out Beijing Noodle Cafe after reading reviews here. We were surprised no one had told this place so close and delicious! As mentioned by other Yelpers you must try at least one of their Noodle dishes. Also I am a huge fan of the General whenever I order Chinese food and was very pleased with the quality and freshness of their General Tso's Chicken. We have been back a few times since and despite making a vow to order something new each time I keep going back to that General. During lunch special it's only 6 bucks and comes with soup, fried rice and a cheese wonton. It's official, I love this spot and will be back often.

Try the Pork Wontons in Chili Sauce. Try it all, I doubt they will disappoint.

However, we're still on our little ""no refined carbs""  diet and that means the heartwrenching denial of noodles and dumplings. 

With this dietary restriction, we were focused on the entree selection, and ended up with Szechuan Chicken and the General Tso's Tofu. Bonus for brown rice! The chicken dish was disappointing. While the flavor was acceptable, it was truly Szechuan Water Chestnuts, as the ratio of chestnuts to poultry was approximately 5 to 1. I personally am not a fan of water chestnuts. I see it as skimping on quality when a dish is overwhelmed by them.

The General Tso's Tofu was a guilty indulgence of fried sweetness. It is really a thoughtful gesture to enable the non-meat crew to enjoy the brilliance of this American-Chinese staple. We asked to add broccoli, and I did feel that our $2 upcharge wasn't accurately reflected in the amount of florets.

My first trip I had the Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup (on the restaurant menu as Special House Soup) and it was amazing!  The flavor was rich and flavorful, every bite was in perfect balance.  I followed that up with the Beijing Zha Jiang Mein with Noodles (again it has a different name on the restaurant menu).  These were good, amazingly flavorful but served colder than I would expect.  Still the end result was I was telling everyone about the great Chinese restaurant I found and counting the days till I could go back and sample some more dishes.

My second trip I made the mistake of ordering some of the ""Americanized Chinese"" dishes.  The hot and sour soup tasted like Apple Cider Vinegar (not good), the General Tso's chicken tasted funky (in a bad way) and the fried rice was bland.  The Orange Chicken was surprisingly light and tasty.  These were a let down, but I had read other people's reviews so I backed up the order with another Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup and a Schezuan Eggplants with Knife cut noodles.  This time the soup was too salty, too oily, and completely out of balance, plus the noodles weren't fully cooked.  The Schezuan Eggplant had tomato in it (which might have been okay if they were cooked but they were cold) and the noodles were doughy and raw in places.

So I went a third time, hoping that the last visit was just a fluke.  Unfortunately, it was again just meh.  The Homemade Tofu with noodles had amazing tofu with bland undercooked noodles.  And the Beijin Wonton Noodle Soup had a beautiful aroma but the broth was lackluster, bordering on bland and the wontons were also nothing to write home about.

The service here is great, the family that owns it friendly, and they are about 3 minutes from my house.  So I'll probably end up going back again.

5650519,2012-08-22,0,td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg,"Beijing Noodle Cafe falls into the category of restaurants that have an identity crisis.  On one hand, they possess the ability to make delicious authentic cuisine.  On the other, they are faced with a consumer demand that yearns for the likeness of Panda Express. If they were located in a geographic area that had a large mainland Chinese population, I am sure they would have stuck to a menu that would have resembled something that you would find in Beijing, and done without the red lanterns.  But alas, they have carved out a niche serving a moderate Chinese-American population and at the same time catered to more Americanized tastes.  In this economy one cannot argue against the prudent nature of such a practice.

To some purists this may seem sacrilegious, but somehow, they seem to pull it off here.  The center of their culinary showcase are their noodles, which you can specify whether you want the hand-pulled or knife cut variety. And the kicker is that you can order it with just about any of their other dishes such as  kung pao chicken, orange chicken, etc.  I chose to go with the hand-pulled noodles with Mongolian beef.  I didn't particularly think that the beef was all that great, but paired with the  perfectly chewy noodles, it made a wonderful complement.  I also went with a more tradiitional zha jiang mein, which is liberally doused in a black bean sauce.  The latter was extremely tasty and had the right combination of saltiness and pungency.  Another touted item, their pork potstickers in chili oil, looked more like pork sticks rather than the rounded ones that I have come accustomed too.  Despite their shape, they were very good, but it was more vinegary than oily.  Unfortunately, the 110 degree temperature that day prevented me from ordering the lanzhou beef noodle soup.  It is definitely on my list to try next time.

Most people get this restaurant confused with Beijing Noodle no 9 in Caesar's palace, which is an over salted atrocity of an excuse for Chinese food.  Although the quality of ingredients may be a bit better over there, one cannot argue the value comparison to Beijing Noodle Cafe.  All of the dishes that we ordered came under $20. That is nearly the same price as the fried rice at Caesar's.  I am a firm believer that when it comes to comfort Chinese food, moderation belies value which is what most great Chinese places are about.  After all, is there really a difference in a $120 beef noodle soup made from Kobe beef? That is something I shall never know.",4q1GOTm23q-qG3o5Kpz81Q,5,2,4,rzeO7Vgihvn-fwl1YYgG0g

After stumbling upon this place after another session of drunken Yelp browsing, I was immediately intrigued. So we made it a point to check this place out on the most recent trip to Vegas. Plus, something needed to break up the buffet binge.

Just by looking at the map online, you can already tell the restaurant is located in an ambiguous strip mall, 10-15 minutes from the Strip. Plenty of parking available. There's such a wide variety of adjacent businesses, that a ""Beijing Noodle Cafe"" just sticks out like a sore thumb. But that's a good thing. 

We ordered the beef ""nugget"" noodle soup, the zha jiang mein, mushroom and tofu noodles, and your standard order of chow mein (our, ahem, non-Asian guest wanted to order it -- call it familiarity). The food arrived relatively quickly, and we all began to slurp down noodles at a rapid pace.

There is such a distinct chewiness and texture to these handmade/knife cut noodles that can't be replicated with your average-Joe, off-the-shelf noodles. If you're a noodle fan, it truly is a delight to eat. Aside from the texture, another thing I love about these noodles is that I think they really absorb the flavors from the overall dish.

Out of the 4 dishes we tried, I liked the mushroom and tofu noodles and the beef nugget noodle soup. The mushroom imparted some good flavor into the noodles, which were flat and crinkly at the same time (see picture). It was a hoot to slurp up these suckers -- but also a pain to scoop up if you want to portion size into a separate bowl.

The beef ""nuggets"" is just their way to saying pieces of beef. Because of the location, the restaurant still caters to the non-Asian crowd and it shows as they are careful with menu wording (no beef tendon here). It also affects their dishes. Some might find some of their dishes on the bland side, and of the same flavor profile. Again, it's understandable given their main clientele and location.

There are no chopsticks, and you get fortune cookies at the end of your meal. Of course, if you speak Mandarin, then request as you please. Service is friendly and helpful, which is very refreshing if you're used to stoic, zombie-like waiters in most Chinese restaurants. They speak decent English and will help you decide what dish to order. Overall, the food is 3.5 stars, but with the friendly service and inexpensive prices, 4 stars it is.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,7,8,4,OITlQaut_kjJdKhwjaT8sA

My friend said the red hurt her eyes, but it didn't bother me. I expected the standard Chinese menu of paper or maybe even something laminated, but they had cute bound menus printed on pretty paper. Lol I'm impressed by the littlest things. The prices were really reasonable and they had a good selection, most of which can be prepared vegetarian. 

We started with the pork won tons in red chili oil and pork and chive dumplings. Pork won tons were cute little bite sized things, think it was 10 to an order not the 8 mentioned in the menu. Served in a sauce like the light sweet soy sauce you put on rice noodles at dim sum with chili oil added. The sweet/spicy was perfect with pork won tons. Dumplings were basically potstickers - loved the presentation, and filling was mainly pork. Served with the same sweet soy sauce on the side. The dumplings were a little delayed coming out, and the owner apologized saying that they could only make one order at a time (the table next to us ordered first). Does that mean they only have 1 pan?

The 3 of us shared the Shanxi knife bevel w beef - homemade chow fun noodles w beef, wood ear fungus and a slightly sweet brown sauce. Noodles were perfect - a little chewy, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. Beef broccoli doesn't usually need a description but this one was served with a darker brown sauce that was even sweeter. No clue if Beijing style cooking is typically on the sweet side. I was just more expecting the usual Chinese gravy that everything seems to come with. I miss that delicious generic gravy. 

My friend ordered the noodle soup with chicken nuggets, so I just had a taste of hers. Broth was amazing with complex flavors, noodles were somewhat soggy, chicken nuggets were really dark chunks of soy sauce chicken (looked like beef). I wouldn't get the chicken again, but maybe try the beef noodle soup next time.

the shrimp with lobster sauce was ok but same scenario there. (3 shrimp, small amount of rice, one cheese wanton...)
the soups were pretty bad... 
also of my pieces of chicken had a bone in it or something... and there wasnt enough chicken....

overall, i wouldnt go back but its def not the worst....",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,1,1,3,i-p9dww-Urst3SvoLkTzrQ

Yes, they have the usual American items, but the real magic is the Lan Zhou noodles and the authentic potstickers and won tons (not the frozen pre-made food service stuff that most restaurants serve). 

Truly awesome and prices are cheap! We ordered 2 entrees and 2 appetizers and our bill was $25 before tip.",ai2doAx0P1nob55-7n_Wng,2,0,5,2RSpOWELJirRIqvzmmzKRg

After a quick survey of the simple menu, I ordered the appetizer Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce, Sliced Pork & Mushrooms with Hand-Pulled Noodles and finally added the Beijing Noodle Soup with Hand-pulled Noodles (although I had placed the order to use the Hand-Cut Noodles for comparison).

The Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce was very good.  The dumpling filling felt dense while the wonton wrapper was delicate and soft, very good but not very spicy.  (Recommended!)

The Sliced Pork & Mushrooms with Hand-Pulled Noodles (normally prepared with Hand-cut noodles) was delicious.  The noodles has that great texture, nice bite or very ""Q Q Q"" if expressed in Taiwanese. It definitely is in a different league compared to noodles served with machine made noodles trucked over from SoCal.  There are also a lot of mushrooms in this dish.  (Recommended!)

Since I am not on a low calorie diet, I ordered the Beijing Noodle Soup (with Hand-cut Noodles, but was delivered the Hand-Pulled Noodles that it is normally prepared with).  The noodles is good, but I think it is better in the non-soup presentation.  The broth is pretty good, but not something that I would rave about. Again, I have been spoiled by trying Beef Noodle Soup from the #1 and #2 ranked Beef Noodle Soup shops in Taiwan.  

It is definitely a restaurant I would come back again and again, if I am in the mood or in the vicinity.

4 stars for the food and price. The value is pretty exceptional.  The repeat patronage factor is high.

P.S.  Too bad the live demo of the hand-pulled noodle making process has been discontinued.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,5,4,djzFqrotrHMVVcdew_AyXA

I was recovering from a flu/food-poisoning, and as I was on the mend -- soup, particularly noodle soup, is what this non-medical professional prescribed to self.

Searching online from my hotel room on the strip, Beijing Noodle Cafe rose to the top with it's 4+ star rating and FRESH made noodles.  Next step, muster up energy.

I take the elevator downstairs, and take the long walk thru the lobby of the Luxor.  Hobbling and wobbling, all-the-while not drunk, I finally reach valet to retrieve my car.  Next step, find it.

About a 15 minute drive down Flamingo, east of the strip (only 10 if you're really hungry), I arrive at a not-the-best looking strip mall & parking lot.  I didn't see the sign at first...and began to worry it fell victim to the economy.  Alas, I see it and parked right near.  Next step, get it.

I open the door, and find that I am a VIP today...a private place all to myself, no papparazis, no TMZ, and no bother.  At 315pm, It was a strange time to eat, even for LUNNER (lunch/dinner).  A lovely, sweet lady greeted me, and I found a nice table...with some sun on my back.  The decor was cute but not fancy, with chinese artifacts, artwork, and painted a pretty mint green.  Next step, stop looking at the decor and pick a fricken noodle.

The menu was great!  They serve lunch specials late, and I was able to take advantage of it.  Lanzhou Beef Noodle was the choice (and like Seinfelds' George, I like it spicy), with a side of dumplings.  Next step, intend to order a little too much so I have leftovers.

The noodles are made fresh to order, so it takes a few extra minutes.  This translated is, the soup isn't already made where they take a ladle and dish it out to you.  FRESH noodles are worth the extra 10 minutes.  Next step, Zen-like patience.

The dumplings came out first.  Wow - they were huge and a bit oddly shaped.  Translation: homemade, and not pressed out of a machine.  Forgetting that I've been ill, energy came from somewhere and I furiously dig into dumpling #1.  Holy Potsticker Batman!  Dumpling #2 was even more fricken great!  It's served with homemade chili sauce/oil -- pure heaven.  Next step, stop after eating 2 dumplings or be too full for the soup.

The soup comes out, and it was absolutely FULL with FRESH noodles, and lovely pieces of tender beef.  Wow.  This is a great bowl, and perfectly executed by the chef.  Tasty broth, tender beef, and amazing noodles.  Next step, slow down or splash the window.

I ate all the soup, one more dumpling, and took 2 dumplings 'to go'.  I was full, and full of noodle happiness I was!  Next step, don't eat the 2 remaining dumplings in the car, no matter how good they smell.

CONCLUSION -- Great place, great service, great prices, great small business to support, and 2 great cold dumplings later from my hotel.  That's a lot of great, and greatly deserved!   It's best for locals and those looking for off-strip, hassle-free dining.  Next step, your turn.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,12,11,5,4v0DwZJZjlftSUmfuoQxCw

They had lunch specials at the time we came so we decided to order a chicken and broccoli entree which comes with soup, rice, a fried wonton. I decided to get my wonton noodle soup which was also available on their lunch specials for $6.95. There were a lot of reviews raving about their dumplings as well so we had to order some beef and onion pan fried dumplings. Everything came out shortly except the dumplings since they took a bit longer. I really enjoyed our meal especially the wonton noodle soup. They used a slightly thicker noodle than I'm used to but it was still delicious. I'm sure they can substitute for different noodles if asked. Our overall total came out to be less than $20 which is not bad at all! We left full and ready for the long drive home.",7Pqo2KXisRwKJ0nQVmyrBA,0,0,4,obb9f14Y_m8eAmSQXIOpZw
