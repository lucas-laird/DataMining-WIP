Pretty much the only healthy option to the pizza, asian and Johnny Rockets also in there.  I like the California club panini with a side of fries as they also sell Nathan's hot dogs at this location. The crinkle cut fries are golden, crispy and not greasy. Overall for Vegas food court food, this is good food.  The chicken on the panini is grilled, it's not lunch meat and the veggies are fresh.  Depending on the time of day the service varies, mood wise and speed.  This time the service was slow and not very friendly but still the same quality of food.   Very satisfying. They are a bit pricy $10 for the sandwich add $3 for the fries. But for Vegas that's pretty average. I Recommend and would go back.",aqc3CnsHVD177hfh3QE3kg,0,0,3,Kuiot0NpkxVdxKLTENX6Pg

Decided to have a hot dog before going to bed. It smelled good and tasted good but by morning I was throwing up and my granddaughter's stomach was upset.  We spent most of the morning in bed then got up and all I could eat was a little fruit until later in evening when I finally started feeling better. I will not be eating there again apparently the do not handle their food safely. It was just a plain Nathan's dog with pkg ketchup nothing else so it had to be the meat.

I was really glad that I did. I ordered the roast beef sub and could not have had a better sub. The guy behind the counter really knew his stuff. He sliced the roast beef for the sub fresh in front of me. He piled it high and asked what toppings I wanted. 
They have pretty much all you could want. Once it was made he wrapped it tight and bagged it for me as I was not eating in. The girl who was running the register was not overly friendly but it was right at closing. Maybe she was tired. 
The food court could use some cleaning but the food was great. 

I really do not understand the bad reviews. If you want high end food, why are you eating in the food court? 
It is on the pricey side but you are paying for convenience on the strip. 
So if you are hungry, give it a try. If you want really cheap food fast. The golden arches are just down the street.",OI-h0R6CoJtR5LK6zLrvww,1,1,4,7u1zzw07kY5DiU-Oc4M0og

I was greeted quickly and my order was taken fast. I had the ham & cheese sandwich on wheat bread with a Dr. Pepper. It was delicious. The bread was soft and the ham was tasty. The only downfall was one size only for drinks and I didn't need a huge soda but that's all they offered.

4655155,2015-04-07,6,qi7PnlfceCl3otbEUWz75w,"In my eyes, this LA Subs is a glorified Nathan's that also sells subs (this location is listed on Nathan's website). When I am spending time on the Strip and am buffeted out or want to eat light, Nathan's is good fast food that satisfies my hunger. Of course being on the Las Vegas Strip, it is pricey fast food. 

 Going back to the early 80s, and maybe even the late 70s from a little child to a middle-aged adult I have been a fan of Nathan's crinkley cut fries. Now that I live in Las Vegas, the only opportunity to enjoy these delicious crinkley cut fries is when I'm on the Las Vegas Strip. On a mellow day of the recent staycation  hanging out in the Wildlife Habitat, we decided to have Nathan's from the Flamingo food court LA Subs. 
  Where the quality of Nathan's crinkley cut fries have been consistently good the last 35 years, good management has been inconsistent. On this staycation, just the day before we had a lousy experience with the Bally's Nathan's. The experience at this glorified Nathan's was the opposite. As soon as we ordered the food, one lady was starting to make the food while the other processed the order. An expensive order by the way. A Pepsi, crinkley cut fries, and Chile cheese hot dog came to over $17.

  The Flamingo food court featured sufficient seating. There were zero issues with cleanliness. The soundtrack was the oldies hits that poured out from Johnny Rocket's creating the feel that I was dining in the Coney Island Nathan's back in the 60s. 

  This glorified Nathan's is good. It would be a 3.5 star good if they offered the super cheeseburger. In conclusion, I might return here if I'm by the center Strip to snack on crinkley cut fries with a Pepsi to hold me over til dinner.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,7,10,3,My1qDTZmwnuT0nbVdnsSFA
4753459,2014-01-03,2,qi7PnlfceCl3otbEUWz75w,"EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! Ok what the crap??? I am sorry but I wasted $14 bucks eating here! I had some time before my flight and I was staying at the Flamingo. So I checked my bags and ventured off for something to eat. I unwisely chose this place. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella wrap. That was the most disgusting thing ever. I took two bites before I threw it in the trash.  How was it disgusting you ask??? Well, where the hell do I begin? 

The ""mozzarella"" - lets start there. I have mozzarella in quotes because that cheese was either rotten or it was NOT mozzarella. It was not even the right damn color.  Mozzarella is favorite cheese and it does not taste like a dirty dish towel like this cheese they put in there. This cheese had a sharp rotten taste to it and was rigid. Whatever it was it was far from fresh. 

The tomatoes were devoid of any flavor. I don't know how else to describe them but blah. 

The wrap as a whole had no flavor expect for the rotten cheese flavor. Their pathetic attempt to spice it up with some kind of oil based dressing was unsuccessful. That too was devoid of any flavor so I had to dump salt on it just to take the two bites I did. 

Now now, before anyone freaks out at me please understand that I did not walk up to LA Subs & Salads expecting a culinary masterpiece or anything but I did expect at least something halfway decent that I could take more than two bites of. This place had alot of nerve charging what they charge for crap. The only thing that was tolerable was the soda which came from a fountain. As anyone can guess there is no way on this planet or any other that I will come back here. I recommend that you stay away.",upQW7sPfOfh0brmyq2byEg,3,2,1,18-qXUaM4AHqXl8GBEqStg

Prices are what you would expect at a casino. $10 for a grilled chicken California wrap that had more lettuce and avocado in it than actual chicken. Skip the fries and get a side salad for $3 to at least make you think you're eating healthy. Co-located with Nathans which is kind of odd. Girls who work there are nice but kind of confused when it comes to charging it to your room. Plus, they almost overcharged me too. Not the swiftest crew here.
