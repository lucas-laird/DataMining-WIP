My mom ordered the beef and chicken kafta, my dad ordered a regular gyro and I ordered a deconstructed gyro. All meals come with a salad (the fattoush) and fries or rice. 

The hummus was amazing-definitely homemade. The pita wedges were warm and also tasted homemade. Yum!!

I tried the kafta and they were ok-not what i would normally eat but my mom loved it. It came with a really good garlic sauce. My deconstructed gyro was really good. The meat was tender and the tzatziki sauce was excellent!

My favorite part of the meal was the side salad-I made sure to ask then what it was before I left. It has lettuce, cucumber, green peppers, tomatoes and pita crisps topped with what tastes like lemon juice and olive oil. 

I've come back here numerous times now since it's so close to my apartment. The staff are always really nice and helpful. My favorite here is still the fattoush-which I now order every time.

Know before you go:
There is another pita restaurant right across the street called Pita Pit, not the same thing at all.

1459617,2017-02-21,11,j2w6wlRmlaZaaErQus8ElQ,"Pita House is my favorite Mediterranean place in town. It's not just because they are located 5 minutes from me, it's because I feel that I get some of the best Mediterranean food in town.

This restaurant is located on the Southeast part of town, on the intersection of Silverado and Maryland. It's near an Autozone and the uber-foodie restaurant, Yuzu. The only way to get in is through Silverado Ranch, going west, so, keep that in mind.

As its' namesake states, pita is the one of the stars of the show. Sometimes, when I'm experimenting with different hummus or baba ghanoush recipes at home, I will just order some pitas from Pita House, because pita bread can be somewhat tricky to make. So soft and pillow-ey. I personally like the version that they serve here, its thinner, and almost like a big chip. But, don't sleep on Pita House' baba ghanoush or hummus, it is superb.

When I do order from here, I get the combo meals. Whether it's lamb, beef, chicken... shawarma, kebab, kafta, etc, everything I've ever ordered was perfectly cooked, seasoned spot-on, and was fresh. The rice pilaf that comes with it was nicely seasoned and fluffy, and the side salad was a nice touch. They offer competitive pricing, and I believe it's fair value. The service is always friendly.

This is my go to spot. I've been around town and haven't been too excited around town in terms of Mediterranean food, and I like what they do here.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,24,23,5,D8TasOXRYlN_J3PwiDvF4Q

I waivered on wether or not to do this review, because if it were just for the food, I would have given it a 5, but the mood in this small place was, well, frightening. On my way home from a monthly doctors appointment, I saw a little Mediterranean Restaurant. I hadn't eaten all day and hadn't had Hummus forever, so decided to go in. The woman running the cash register was friendly & outgoing. I told her I would probably see her every month because of where they were located. She gave me a menu to take home with me and said if I called when I was leaving my doctor, she'd have my food ready when I got there. Wow, really nice! I sat down to wait and started watching CNN News which was on their TV. It was about Trump's statements that he would not be supporting Ryan or McCain. They also showed a clip of Trump telling a woman with a crying baby to take it out of the room he was speaking in. Anyway, there was a skinhead (I know this because he had a swastika tattooed on the back of his shaved head, not kidding here) yelling at the TV about Hillary being a crook. The woman came out and started yelling with him that Hillary was a murderer. YELLING! Both of them together. Inside of a fairly small space. The woman went back behind the counter to get my food (yelling on the way) and brought it to me, now sweet and nice as could be. After this, she went back to the skinhead and started shouting with him again. I ate about 1/2 of my meal before I couldn't take it any longer. I got a container to go. Couldn't sit and peacefully eat while this insane scene was actually playing out before my eyes. As I left, the owner sweetly smiled and said ""See you soon"". No, you won't. I don't care what your political views are, but you don't behave like this with customers in your establishment. Truly disturbing!",IH5yLymOwQDEqZlyPjn4IA,1,0,1,UzkrSgmfWfErIohdIn8Pww

1548644,2013-10-14,0,j2w6wlRmlaZaaErQus8ElQ,"Was craving a gyro. Looked at some other places closer to my house but they all had poor ratings. I found Pita house, with a good rating and good reviews. It was about 6 miles from my house but I decided to try it. 

 The store is located in a small shopping area, but easy enough to find. 

When you walk in the place is clean and neat. Not to much over the top decor, and the smell was great. Made my mouth water even more. The meat was cooking on a spit, where they just shave off the meat and place it on the  grill to heat it up. So you know the food is fresh and cooked to order. 

I ordered the lamb gyro with extra taziki sauce ( not sure that's right spelling). My husband ordered the beef and chicken kafta plate. All dishes come with a salad, fries or rie. We got the fries. I also ordered the cheese pies. Was thinking of getting the spinach pies (maybe next time).  Got the food back home and I was really surprised how big my gyro was. It was way more then I expected. I was unable to finish it so I saved it for dinner. My husband is a southern guy so if it's not fried or smoother end in gravy everything is jus ok. I asked and he said it was good, so by his standards it was good and he would order it again. 

The staff that was working was very helpful and helped my choose my food. She was right it was all rally good and fresh. We will be back.",SM96w5Sh1emA0VQkXKmU8Q,3,0,5,7s9GYO9SoniGaTBY6XpfPQ

Apps are shareable, with several pies (spinach, meet, cheese options) coming in 4-piece orders. The spinach variety has a heavy lemon flavor to it and does not include feta, as spanakopita would. The chicken shawarma wrap was an ample amount of chicken wrapped in a super-soft pita, sided with soft yellow rice and a small salad. Ask for extra garlic sauce! 

The best item though is the kabob salad- a giant Greek salad topped with your choice of beef, chicken, or lamb kabobs. Lamb is my preference, medium rare, with feta and onion on the salad. Dressing is amazing, I think it's a red wine vinagrette? Different from usual Greek dressings, in a delicious way.

They've got me craving it often but I don't feel bad because their food is every bit as healthy as it is delicious. Everything is made fresh and in house including their bread. There isn't a can opener on site and nothing is processed.

I'm in love with their tabouli salad (see photo). It's been absolutely perfect every time I've ordered it. The beef kabob skewers are also great with their famous garlic sauce. It's a must try! I've ordered their gyros and those are yummy too. They serve theirs on a pita and not that thicker flatbread like I've had at Greek restaurants. Possibly because their food is Lebanese and this is a different style. I have no complaints though. Just wanted to point out that it was uncommon to me. Regarding the rest of the menu, I haven't gotten too adventurous with that yet so I can't comment. However, this is one of those places where I am willing to bet that everything on the menu is good.

I had the gyro plate with a side of hummus. The pita bread is fresh serves warm and the hummus was delicious! 

The pita plate came with a salad and your choice of rice or fries for under $10. A great deal!

The salad had the right amount of dressing on it, bell peppers, but what really made it good were the pita croutons! I would order those by themselves and keep for snacks. 

The rice was cooked perfectly and was buttery.  It wasn't overly spiced like a lot of restaurants do. Good job.

The pita was fantastic! Everything was fresh and it really made the entire pita explode. One of the best I have ever tasted. 

The restaurant is tucked away in a little strip mall and I probably wouldn't have found it without yelp.

The interior was clean and the staff was super friendly. They asked how the good was after I started eating and explained that everything was made fresh and no preservatives.

We walked in and everything already smelled so good. The lady at the counter went over our different options and we decided on the 3 meat kabob plate (chicken, beef and lamb) this came with your choice of fries or rice and a salad! 

We also ordered pita bread and hummus to start. 

While waiting for our food they brought us out fresh made spinach pies on the house! (They were delicious!)

Then we got our hummus and pita bread. The bread was freshly made out of the oven. The hummus was perfect as well. 

Then we got our meal and everything was so delicious! The chicken and beef were my favorite and flavored perfectly! There was vegetables that complimented the meat as well! They also had a wonderful garlic sauce that was perfect for dipping the meat. 

We ended up taking the meal home because it was too much for the 2 of us! An extra order of pita bread was only $1.00 and so worth it!

2594311,2013-10-11,0,j2w6wlRmlaZaaErQus8ElQ,"I loved the Pita House at first bite. When you taste all fresh food compared to processed, it's hard to go back. They make amazing Mediterranean and Lebanese food every day, from scratch, absolutely nothing canned. 

The atmosphere is new, simple, with a touch of elegance, as the floors are handmade tile and the counters marble and granite. The area is clean and well lit.
I love all their kabobs, especially the beef kabob platter. The hummus is extraordinary.

I am the founder and lead writer for Las Vegas Top Picks, which showcases great stuff around Vegas. I put Pita House on my website.  http://lasvegastoppicks.com/pita-house-mediterranean-grill/

I've known the owner, Charlie, for almost a year, from Roy's Liquor Store in Summerlin. I've heard many times about his passion for cooking, and remember when he was preparing the Pita House to open. He put a lot of love in every aspect--the design, the staff, the food, the oven, every little detail. Charlie told me he wanted to create a restaurant that on any given day, his family and friends from Lebanon could walk in and get fresh, authentic, delicious food.

From all that I've heard--and tasted--he's succeeded. I met the staff there too. They care about the food they create. This is not a day job for them, it's a livelihood and their life work. These are the kinds of restaurants I love.

The only drawback is I live on the other side of town, near Red Rock Casino. If I lived closer to Pita House, I would eat here at least three times a week, since it's so fresh and affordable.

Please give Pita House a try and let me know. Your taste buds will thank me!",ZLluD-vsfR4hIjtVxkTV5g,5,2,5,sOcv_jO3IHIi41xJVdC0xg

The Shwarma, Kafta,Hummus, Salad, Pita, and Rice at our meal was enough to curb a Mediterranean craving. But when stacked up with local contemporaries of the hummus game, Pita House is certainly at home in the middle. 

Ive read great things about the Shwarma wrap, and sure enough the first bite was delicious. But I feel a lot of that was thanks to the garlic sauce, which like a secret weapon left the rest of the wrap vunerable in the taste department. 

I feel the best meals are those which you don't search for the salt and pepper, and here I found myself reaching for both. But regardless I'd still give the dishes of Pita House a solid B-.",Biv-1xBbKeUXe2kAVoJGLg,5,5,3,O3GnlEYYe0666nDKRn92Pg

I had ordered the Combo plate [1 skewer of chicken kabob, 1 skewer beef and 1 skewer lamb kabob, basmati rice, salad and their fresh, house-made pita bread that's to die for], and I already knew that this was going to be a lot of food, but I wanted to try all the meats--because protein. My girlfriend ordered the chicken wrap, which also came with basmati rice and salad.

The employees behind the counter were all friendly and extremely nice. They constantly checked up on us as we ate our lunch and I wasn't bothered by it at all. I forget the man's name that took our order [sorry!], but he was awesome and brought us out two different sauces to eat with our food. One was the traditional tzatziki sauce and the other was their garlic sauce. 

Now when the food came out and I opened the box; I was enamored with how the food looked, smelled and I couldn't wait to get it all in my belly! The meats were all perfectly seasoned and cooked until tender and juicy. The rice was light and fluffy and the salad had just the right amount of acidity that really complemented the whole meal. But what really got me was their in-house made pita bread--that's the stuff that was baked from the Gods. It had such a light and soft texture with the right amount of chewy-ness that made me feel like all other pita breads were inferior to this.

I ate in silence. 
I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. 
Then, I quickly realized I was upset that I was full.

It's a good thing there's always tomorrow.

This place was reaaaally good. It's a little hidden, but a good find. I had the falafel wrap with rice. Out of all the Greek places I've been they probably had the best tasting falafel. It was fried to perfection and was still soft and flavorful, not over fried and hard. The only thing I didn't like in my wrap was that they put a lot of parsley, but that's a preference. Next time I know to order without it bc they used too much for my taste.

upon entering, the place is well kept and clean. Very nice. TV in the corner, playing some woman talk show (Probably killed a few of my weaker brain cells being forced to listen to the show). friendly young man taking orders.. all looked good.

I ordered a beef shawarma plate that came with rice and salad and a chicken kabob plate.  Then the wait began. On one hand, it was fine because I could tell they were making my plates from scratch, somewhat. I was the only person in the place and it took about 15 minutes to get the 2 plates. I was ok with that... except for being forced to listening to a bunch of girls talking on the tv...

Went home and opened the containers.  First off, they got my chicken order wrong. Instead of kabobs they gave me a straight chicken plate. Didn't bother me too much, but I wanted some vegs. First the beed shawarma:  very dry and it looked like older meat. Because, shawarma cooks similar to Al Pastor but in a cone type de\vice. Since all my meat looked like end cuts, I am guessing it was a piece of beef cooking for a while causing the burnt ends. I didn't mind but too dry.  The salad and rice were excellent.  The big negative was salt. way too salty.

Then tried the chicken plate that was supposed to be kabobs.  Excellent except for the same complaint of the beef, extremely salty.  What too salty, I'm still tasting it.

Price was comfortable with $18.35 for 2 plates.... but couldn't eat all of it due to the large portions and the salt...  I saved the rest for a late n right snack... maybe having the munchies with a beer I won't mind the salt so much.

Overall, A-OK place. I will try other places in the area that also serve pitas... if I can't find anything I really like, I might come back here.",dHK5-NF7jMf-fCsFiCVMMQ,1,0,3,TGdBzgwrcocGC6LqOICHiw

Yes, the hummus tasted so fresh and delicious. So much better than my usual Trader Joe's Mediterranean Hummus. It came with their home made pita bread. Amazing.
I ordered 2 Skewers Lamb Kabob. For some reason, there were two different kinds of lamb chunks in the dish. The ones that were so tender almost like ground lamb meat ball and the ones that were very tough and chewy. The tender ones were so juicy and delicious, but the tough ones I didn't enjoy. It tasted like just plain lamb meat with no flavor. I left the tough hard lamb meat to go and gave to my dogs. They really enjoyed it so I'm happy. (There was no spice or salt on the meat. Just plain so it's OK.)
Make sure you ask for the garlic sauce. Their garlic sauce is delicious and goes with any kind of meat (chicken, beef, lamb and even vegetable) They don't give you unless you ask for it. 
The older guy that was working here was very attentive. He said he came from Boston to help his friend's restaurant. How nice.

It had been ages since I had eaten any Mediterranean food, close to a decade. When I was in high school, a good friend's parents owned a Mediterranean/Greek cafe that I ate at often but after they closed due to medical issues, I never really found a replacement to get my Greek on. 

Pita House is that replacement. From the deliciously zesty tabouli to the juicy chicken kabobs to the addictive hummus... everything is made fresh, even the pita bread (which is amazing)! After my first visit to Pita House, I would get the most intense cravings for their hummus and I have yet to find a place that has anything quite as good as what PIta House serves up.

The restaurant itself is simple but it has always been very clean when I have gone in. The staff have always been extremely pleasant and helpful. There have been times I have gone months between visits, however the employees always seem to remember me and great me warmly. 

In a nutshell: Pita House has some super friendly employees serving up super super yummy food that is actually good for you AND will not break the bank. As far as I am concerned, for Mediterranean food in Las Vegas, Pita House is as good as it gets!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,4,4,5,GDskujjQ1szaclvgedZnPQ

The location is a bit off the path, but not impossible to find in the corner commercial center between an Auto Zone and Tire & Auto Center. Entering into the space its decorated a bit oddly with different array of colors, and patterns, but its not dirty which is a plus. Now for the important part....the grub! I was smacked in the face with the smell of meats and mouth watery goodness when i stood at the counter to order. Went with the simple Gyro Wrap $7.99 with a little salad and rice. Meal comes out to you in a styrofoam to-go style platter with the 3 sections inside for your meal. Eating into the salad first was fresh vegetables, tangy dressing (i like), and some plain and dry rice which i actually dig. If you like the dry Mexican rice then you will enjoy this as well. The wrap was a great sized portion with lots of meat and again fresh vegetables inside. VERY tasty, and very flavorful. I managed to finish my lunch but i could see how this could be a meal big enough to not be able to finish for some (no complaints there). For a sub $10 lunch and its not terrible over processed and relatively healthy option i find it hard to beat to be honest. There are a number of items that i am now curious to try because of my solid experience here. 

I must also mention that Susan, i believe someone else said she manages the place was very kind and attentive as well. She pays attention to the ""little things"", and that makes a difference for some. I never drink soda, so i opted for no drunk but was offered a water cup. Guests were finished eating in the dining room and she called out to them to ask if they needed a to go bag for their food. And when she steps into the dining room, she walks around and checks on people Some would say this is normal, but i find it all too common for people to simply stay behind the counter and do as little as possible. So thank you Susan, i will be back. 

Its not a date night destination, but for a no nonsense meal on the cheap its a winner.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,0,0,4,uJW_52yN1Y21lgX4OA79lQ

If I didn't have cash on hand last time I was there, they would have had to throw the food away and send me away angry! I'm sure it's already happened to them more than once. I can't be the only one.

The first time I came here, it was pretty amazing. It's walking distance from my house, so that's a plus. I ordered the steak kabob platter, which comes with rice, pita bread and a salad. They were out of rice, so I got fries instead. No biggie cuz the fries were hot and crispy. The meat was tender and flavorful, which was excellent with the pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The salad was fresh and crispy. And the meal came with half a grilled tomato, which I added a good smokiness to everything. The bf and I enjoyed our meal very much, so I kept it in mind for future ""don't feel like cooking"" days. 

Second visit was a few days ago. I order the same thing, but subbed the fries for rice since it was available this time. I guess I didn't miss out on much the first time because the rice was just bland. Other pita places have flavored rice, and since their rice was yellow, you would expect some sort of seasoning. Some of my meat was undercooked that it was still bloody when I cut it open. And the pita bread that was so soft on my first visit was just hard and dry. And for some reason, I don't remember the vinaigrette dressing on the salad to be so sour. 

I hate leaving a 3 star review for family owned places. The owner is so sweet and friendly and makes sure that everything is ok. Maybe they just had an off day on my second visit :(",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,0,3,ENzaOpHi3CcmmhaQqli-9A

The Pita House did not dissapoint!!! It has been a weekly favorite for my husband and me. I love the chicken shawarma and he loves the beef. We always get it with fries. Not the healthiest choice, but the fries are always hot and so perfectly fresh they are hard to resist. The healthy salad makes up for it. I have learned that I don't have to eat all the fries as they give you a huge helping, and only enjoy a few to save room for the sandwich.

We alway order a couple pieces of bread to go and have it with breakfast the next morning.

For lunch I tried half of each and both were completely disgusting. The falafel sandwich tasted like the sauce had soured like milk. I opened it up and the lettuce inside was completely rotten and brown. The falafel tasted old and terrible. The chicken shawarma was dry as hell and almost paste like. So needless to say the only thing edible was the French fries and the puny salad that came with the meal. Now I feel sick and have nothing to take to work for food. YUCK! Never again!!!

They serve the food in styrofoam containers which we liked because you really needed to bring some home.  The portions are a very good size.

They have sauces of course depending on what you order and they will give you extra if needed but don't waste them because they are amazing.  

This is a family owned and run place open 7 days a week from 11am to 8pm and we are SO EXCITED to find this place so close to our house.

5285382,2013-07-08,1,j2w6wlRmlaZaaErQus8ElQ,"I LOVE mediterranean food. Especially, when the pita bread is freshly cooked from the oven. The bread reminds me of Khoury's fresh bread. The woman who I think was the owner was very nice and honestly I was not disappointed in anything I ordered. I got hummus, fresh bread, chicken kabob with basmati rice and a salad. The prices were cheap as well I believe my chicken kabob was only $7.99 and my hummus was $3.99. They serve huge portions. They lack a little bit in timing since it did take a while but I will definitely return.

Free delivery within distance ;)

PROS: Hummus, Chicken Kabob and Fatoush salad, owner was kind, clean, cheap

5391540,2015-07-07,1,j2w6wlRmlaZaaErQus8ElQ,"We came in the late afternoon and one aspect of this place that definitely stood out was the great customer service. 

Visited here with a pita craving and wasn't necessarily disappointed but noticed very little consistency across the various items we ordered which included the meat pies, kibbeh balls, beef shawarma, chicken shawarma, and beef kabob. 

The meat pies were a random spur of the moment order because we never heard of them, in hindsight probably a bad choice. The breading to meat ratio was too imbalanced and just tasted like a very yeasty piece of bread. All in all, a non order next time. 

The kibbeh balls are excellent, an order I always go to at pita places for a starter. Although, these are probably hard not to do correctly, but nevertheless delicious. 

The beef and chicken shawarma receive similar criticisms as the meat pies. Too much breading and not enough meat, the beef was slightly better than the chicken due to the dryness of the chicken. Not sure if I went on an off day or if they use a not so juicy part of the chicken but it was fairly tough to chew and get down. 

Best dish by far out of the ones we ordered was the beef kabob. The regular sizing comes with 6 generous pieces of beef. I asked for medium-rare and received what looked to be well done with no pink at all, but it was still delicious and cooked to a tender texture that wasn't super hard
to chew. The rice here is the bomb too, not sure what they cook it with but it comes out an almost golden color and has a nice savory kind of buttery taste to it that goes super well with the beef. The other item on the side of the meat is the side salad which is also awesome. Pretty standard side salad you find at most pita/Mediterranean places but what stands out is the delicious croutons they use. I actually mistook it as bacon at first until I bit into one and was pleasantly surprised by the crunchy flavorful treat that hit my mouth. 

All in all, this place was ""pretty"" good but would visit other pita places very close by when given a choice. Seems to be too many inconsistencies in the menu for multiple revisits, unless you're the type who orders the same thing every time.",FsbgLI_0UUnEQMZY3ZgTRw,2,1,3,KBK3Bwtjkal5jsrwZfO7Qg

No words. Always warm and straight out of your home oven. Creamy with a bit of oil. Enough to get you to think it's the one element not on the periodic table. All the veggies , perfect , salad ? One of a kind . The fries , the glorious tahini and the baba g , and the dessert... WOW. Go get yourself some baklava right now. Get some falafel wraps and veggie wraps right now If you're a vegan / vegetarian or just a foodie looking for fresh , homemade , organic bites.. And top that off with an entire entree of their vegetarian.. But wait there's more..  Get yourself a plate , actually many plates , maybe even a couple boxes..

Their gyros meat is fresh and flavorful, and the falafel has exactly the kind of complex, rich, nutty savoriness you want in the dish. Sandwiches come with salad and fries. Don't recommend the fries.

5531159,2013-10-08,1,j2w6wlRmlaZaaErQus8ElQ,"I'm no expert when it comes to Mediterranean food but nom nom!!   The owners are always very nice and pleasant.  The food always tastes fresh and yummy.  The wife told us that her husband gets their olive oil from a very far away country (I totally forget where) and it takes a month to arrive- cray cray..  (okay so you caught me, I took a mental vacation the minute she expelled the details and was back to catch the end of it-oopsie for having A.D.D.)

So they have the three meat options: Chicken, Beef and Lamb, all on a huge skewer, cooker, rotater thing and the boyfriend always gets chicken wrap thing (don't know the technical correct term for it) and it comes with a small salad and rice (or fries).  Whatever they use to cook that rice is absolutely tasty and delicious!!  They also have skewers of meat.

baba ghanoush deserves a paragraph of it's own.  HELLO!!  So the first time we went, I ordered the hummus and inquired about the baba ghanoush (I had no idea what it was?!).  The owner was nice enough to give us a little sample and to my surprise, I actually prefer the baba G over Hummus?!  So super delicious!! And the Pita, ohhhhh the Pita, so warm, fresh and good- I could eat just the pita by itself!  And for the price, you get a very generous serving and trust me, you'll love it!  Now we order an extra side of pita because that bad boy doesn't stand a chance!

So Miss. Vegetarian over here gets the filafel.  Sometimes I order it as a sandwich/wrap thing and sometimes I just get the balls plain with the rice and salad.  There's absolutely no guilt eating here because everything tastes so darn fresh and good!!  ...and we never order the french fries...

The last time we were there, we got stuck behind two other orders and it took a loooonnnnggg time....  but we weren't in a rush...  and to be quite frank, we didn't mind much...  and I'd rather have fresh cooked food (just like making it at home) and waiting....than frozen heated up food, or stale food for that matter.  BUT I must put it into perspective, we would have waited just as long at Cheesecake Factory or some other large restaurant for our food... so what's the difference??? none.  only love for this place.

So anywho, give this place a shot, I think they deserve a fighting chance in our neighborhood.  Good, simple, healthy eats and genuinely nice owners behind that counter.",Tq61AHCncEpvRGnUvgnmzA,6,3,4,biN8H25wpZ4tGCAL6iAWJA

On her reccommendation I tried the beef kafta - yummy with the basmatic rice - light and delicious..  My DH got the Kabob Salad with Beef Skewer.  He is a butcher by trade and is very picky of the meat he is served and he loved it.  We also ordered the hummus, oh my gosh so good.  First off it comes in a 16oz deli container.  If you can't eat it all - no worries slap the lid on it and take it home. For $3.99 people - that's a deal.  But most importantly of all their Pita Bread - this isn't called the Pita House for nothing.   It comes straight out of the oven and to your table.  You can smell it cooking in the pita oven (imported from Lebanon).  At $1.00 each pita of course I had to take some home with all my leftover hummus.  To top it all off she brought us some complementary baklava at the end of the meal.  We felt like family.

Daily specials and Sunday - really specials, family favorites.  

Thanks for making this a great meal and experience.
