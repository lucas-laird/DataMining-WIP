777064,2016-04-02,0,Kb43diOoBV4l77bxpn2k3Q,"Purchased a yogurt paffait with expired date on sticker.  What was worse was it was only 2/3 full with no blueberries.  I called and talked to manager, but it took a while for her to understand she sold me an expired item and without blueberries.   I called back later and talked to the store manager to express my concern:  are blueberries being recycled when paffait itself expired?  He said no, and said ""oh, we were out of blueberries.""   He offered me a free dinner, which I declined and said at most I want is refund other than express my concerns.  As he was very persistent, I agreed to accept a free meal.  He said it was to make up for my bad experience.  He said he won't be there, but will let the manager know.  As I don't feel comfortable eating there, my coworker suggested to get a voucher.  When I went to return the item after work,  shift manager just gave me a look, and another employee came and gave me a refund saying, ""I was told,  food you get, you have to eat here, and don't take outside.""  I never even mentioned her about a free meal.   I just told her, ""No, thank you, I don't feel comfortable eating here,"" and left.  Store manager made my bad experience a worst one for sure.  I don't think they care about food safety or customer service.  Not coming back ever again.",Rp4tXNr_CDCz-8K3l94QCw,0,0,1,APk0LbKTeo982DOe6Bs74w

I'm so LIVID I don't know what to do!!!! So I had to pick up my nephew and take him to my grandmother's house after I got off work. So he told me he was hungry so it wasn't a problem. Since most kids including myself 
(the big kid) loves McDonald's so why not. It's 117Â°+ here in Vegas and nobody wants to cook anyway. 
 
So we shared the 2 cheeseburger combo and both got a sundae. Well it everyone must have had the same idea because it took 20 minutes just to get our food. They claimed they were waiting for my fries. But okay whateverSo our ice melted and our sundaes were about to melt. I asked them to replace it because who wants a warm soda & a sundae dripping elsewhere.

We started eating our food and the fries were definitely not fresh and here is the most disturbing part of it all!!!! The cheeseburgers were dry and the bread was hard!!!! Now I'm a french fry connoisseur so I let that slide but give me a stale cheeseburger!!!! 

They better be glad it was too hot and I was too tired to drive my butt back there and give them a piece of my mind!!! And they think they deserve $15.00 an hour??? I'm not knocking them but come on totally unacceptable!!!!!

I am beyond pissed!!!! I didn't plan on going here but my nephew was hungry.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,1,wzv8DU_6E5Adcm5eAiMpFA

Just a few things from the last few months if stopping by different locations w/family. Fist of all it seems like some locations stopped salting their fries all together, good or bad that depends on you. Than some locations changed their menu, personally I did not like the new menu it's to bright and very hard to read. I felt like the words were running all together. And last now they r just wasteful, they r wrapping their sandwiches in a half paper and on top of this putting into a box. Let's be real they do not need both. Oh I also feel like their prices went up.
