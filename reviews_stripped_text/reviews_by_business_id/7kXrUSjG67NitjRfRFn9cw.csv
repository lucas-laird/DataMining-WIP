I ordered a southern fired chicken sandwich for $3.59. It looked big and juicy on the menu board. What I got was a TINY chicken patty on a dry bun with two pickle slices. The dollar chicken sandwich at Jack in the Box is bigger than this thing.
Since I felt this was a total joke, I asked for my money back. The manager took the sandwich from me, tossed it in the trash, and had the cashier give me my money back (less the tax), without ever saying a word! By the look on his face, I guess the money was coming out of his pocket.

To top things off they were basically out of everything. I overheard him tell one customer they were out of Coke and told me they were out of sweet and sour sauce. How are you McDonald's and out of the key items you sell?!

4655238,2014-04-19,7,7kXrUSjG67NitjRfRFn9cw,"I currently view McDonald's as more of a restaurant serving inexpensive snacks than meals. In my opinion, McDonald's is a level or few below the fast food powerhouses starring In N Out, Raising Cane's, and Panda Express. When dinner is far in the horizon and I want to calm my appetite, I order off the McDonald's $1 menu as I look forward to a better meal. The $1 menu features large fountain Coke beverages, a sausage buritto, a hot & spicy chicken sandwich, a double cheeseburger,  small coffee, and other foods.

   Both my check-ins here were when I hiked on the Angel Park Trail system. This McDonald's is convenient to the Angel Park Trail system; which includes the Bonanza Trail, Kellogg Sport's Complex, and Lone Mountain Trail. The restaurant is a convenient respite from outdoor activities. To reach this McDonald's from the Angel Park Trail system; from Bonanza Trail which is really the east spur of Angel Park Trail to you'd walk past the Kellogg Sport's Complex, walk under the Buffalo Drive tunnel and after the K-Mart turn left on Lone Mountain Trail. After Crossing Washington Avenue with a pedestrian signal, you'd turn left and McDonald's is on the right.

  As far as location,  I am curious why McDonald's passed over building the restaurant at the corner of Buffalo at Washington. The existing restaurant a few thousand feet east of Buffalo Drive on Washington Avenue is out of sight lines for motorists driving on Buffalo Drive one traffic signal north of Summerlin Parkway. Then again being McDonald's there is another location a couple of traffic lights north at Buffalo and Lake Mead Boulevard.  

  This is an older McDonald's. This is not surprising considering it is near Kmart. There is no theme. Just a basic McDonald's with a dining and indoor playground area.

  The two check-ins in this basic McDonald's were for a snack. On my first check-in,  I quaffed down the limited time Chocolate strawberry Frape. It was a yummy caffeine boost at a cost of $4 and 600-plus calories. Fortunately this was the halfway point of my hike and I'd burn some of it off. On my follow-up check-in,  I snacked on a Hot & Spicy Chicken with a large Coke. The Coke was flat. That is a no no! If the service wasn't decent and there wasn't a manager presence, this review would fall flat of 3 stars and sink to 2 stars. 

  I try to review places when I am a regular. Now that I am a Duke that will probably see that status fade at this location, it is time to emphasize that this is a decent restaurant for a snack or light meal off the Angel Park Trail system and in the vicinity of Washington at Buffalo.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,7,3,fjzGlG_8CRpEsHxR9fFF3w

They put the fudge on one side and dripped all over the lid...didnt even offer me a cup holder (as usual). No more! Avoid this mcdonalds unit...they always mess something up!!!

I only ordered two items - a large soda and an ice cream cone. At the next window, the server handed me a cone that was made so poorly, it was leaning over at a 45° angle. When I looked at it, she looked at me and said, ""Do you want a cup for that?"" as she also recognized the precariousness of it. I said yes, but was dumbfounded when I considered they would serve such a hazard ridden item, particularly when they know it will be consumed in a car. When she came back, still in a bit of surprise, I told her that she should never have served such a thing, particularly through a drive through window. She smiled and I went on my way.

The cashier and servers were young. I do not fault them. I fault the manager and supervisors that do not instruct their employees on how to address customers (face to face, especially when addressing them) and to only serve items that are prepared correctly, and that if they are not prepared correctly, then to discard them and start again.

5895224,2014-02-27,7,7kXrUSjG67NitjRfRFn9cw,"So I actually ended up at this McDonald's by default because I was shopping at Trader Joe's and it was literally the only restaurant in the area.  I was disappointed at first because I really didn't want to be eating at a fast food chain, especially not at McDonald's since we have about a hundred of them back home.  However, I changed my tune when I saw the menu.  

This particular McDonald's had items on the menu that the Hawaii locations don't offer.  For instance, they had about a handful of items on the value menu that I've never heard of before.  I had the Bacon Cheddar Hot 'N Spicy McChicken sandwich which they don't sell at Hawaii McDonald's locations.  For less than $2, you can't go wrong!  Bacon and cheddar?  Yes please!  Of course I had that with fries and also a couple of Baked Pumpkin Apple Pies.  I went in November so pumpkin was in season AND the apple pies they have are baked.  The ones in Hawaii are fried.  The baked ones taste much better than the fried ones.  

Sure, customer service was kind of crappy but I don't expect great customer service at McDonald's.  Who does?  You go there for the cheap eats and the fries.  It was a plus that I got to eat items that they don't sell at Hawaii locations.",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,5,5,4,S48oIWvAgyleTNjcqHB38w
