Horrible, horrible, horrible.  It has no management, employees look like they don't care, food is often cold, nuggets taste old and dry.
Drive thru lines are super long.  It's an overall frustrating experience.  Avoid this location until someone turns it around.",3XSBHH432euFfSq9TBXXXg,0,0,2,wpfIRZyBo1r-bCTH--gPoA

When I walked up and ask the cashier (who I believe was the manager) for a cup of coffee she says they don't have any.  I can see the coffee maker behind her is empty.  I then ask her if she can make more and she just tells me ""No"". 

How much does it cost her (McDonalds) to make a pot of coffee?  I was going to order food for the whole family but with her bad attitude I just walked away.  Pretty poor customer service.  

If you plan on eating here don't expect too much in regards to service.",aHZbO7KFZrHy3pl6TyyhMw,1,0,1,RxEWM8joH0lNjkuIcY2NJQ
