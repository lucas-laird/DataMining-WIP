My wife and I walked in and were immediately jolted by the loud, thumping dance music being played on the house system.  What?!?!  Photos of everybody from Miles Davis to T-bone Walker on the walls, and you're playing this crap?  It got worse.  We ordered at the counter, and while we were waiting another couple came in, ordered, and then sat outside to wait for their food.  We watched the young woman who took the orders deliver food to them, and suspected that she had given them our order.  sure enough, a couple minutes later, counter girl came to our table and said ""I'm sorry, I accidentally gave them your order.""  Really easy to see how confusing it could have been with a total of four people in the entire place!  When our food did arrive, I found a puddle of grease at the bottom of my order of half-cooked onion rings.
Sad.  I like Fatburger (and part of the reason is the music selection).  but the unsupervised kids who were working that day found a way to make it a really crappy experience.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,2,0,2,q40qSK7HBNG6vfPvaplrVA

We each order the ""XXL"" with egg and bacon, chilli cheese fries and a drink 
($17 ?!?). 
After 15-20min, our order came out in a standard greasy brown paper lunchbag.

This place is a joke.  You pick what size of over-priced hamburger patty you want.  $5 to $10 for a fast food burger? Really?!?!?

When I pulled into this place, there was a blue car at the drive thru window.  I pulled up to the speaker to order and was told ""Just a minute.""   5 minutes later, the order taker graced me with her presence and I gave my order.  I pulled up and the blue car was still there!  I waited another 4-5 minutes and just pulled out of the drive thru and left.  The exact same thing happened about a year ago when I first tried this location.

Pluses: The food is always good. Being able to add an egg or make your order custom is a welcome change. The menu is deliberately limited. This means their core products are spot on and well made. 

Minuses: The current pricing structure leaves a lot to be desired. $20 for 2 people to have burgers and fries is quite steep. The jukebox is gone,but some retro music is still played. Do not be in a hurry here, however long it takes for the food to arrive,is how long it will take.

I wasn't in the mood to argue, the thought crossed my mind to just drive off but I went ahead and overpaid. Should have just driven away, worst, liquid, overpriced shake ever. 

Lesson learned, if you are going to have diet cheat treat, go to in n out and pay half for a MUCH better shake.

It's really not that difficult of a job but for some reason the woman at cash register couldn't seem to be able to process what I was trying to order. First strike, out of fat fries. Then, she wrang my order in wrong so I had to reorder missing items. Next, a man who ordered was given his food but informed the cook he hadn't paid yet so he had to wait for the woman to come from the back so he could pay and take his food. The cook told her he needed to pay cause his food was ready and she instead of taking care of him proceeded to make a milk shake. Then the plain cheeseburger I ordered for my son came out with chili on it which I only ordered on the side. So we had to wait for the burger to be remade. As we are eating right now I notice that all they've done to "" fix"" his burger was wipe the chili of and re-grill it. In total I was in there for 25 min.

It took the cashier forever to enter the order into a computer and you have to speak slow and repeat it several times.  If you order a shake, she will make it before taking the next order in line.  

After we finally ordered, it took 20 minutes to get our burgers!  We were told the fries were taking longer to cook and would be a few minutes.  The burgers were good, but they had started to cool off by this point.  I had ordered the new Thousand Island Burger, they had apparently forgot that small detail.  It took so long to get this one that I didn't even bother having them redo it.

The fries arrived 8 minutes later and were slightly undercooked.  They were done, but not crispy yet.  you could tell right away because they were not that golden brown color.  We had ordered 3 orders of fat fries,  but she brought two fat and one skinny fries.  She told us that she gave us what was available and didn't want us to wait any longer.  She dropped the platter on the table and walked away.  I guess we did better than other people who ordered onion rings, they got the same skinny fries and were told that there was something wrong with the onion rings and that's all they had.  I guess the other people figured the same thing, the wait was so long why even bother fighting it.  The staff didn't even bother offering a refund for the extra dollar it costs for the onion rings!

The meal was ok, but not worth the 30 minutes it took to get part of the order.  The last straw was when my wife pointed out the water stained roof tiles above us.  They were painted black, but now some of the tiles had obvious water damage and one even looked like it had white mold growing on it.

I asked why since there is an expiration date for the Fatburger coupon and dots signifying to ""clip"" the coupon. The coupon doesn't mention that the whole receipt needs to be present for the offer. The coupon is also on a roll with other coupons for non affiliated businesses. Fatburger are you telling me that if I want to use your coupon I better use it before I use the other coupons? If I had eaten at Brooksy's the week before And their coupon was gone you wouldn't honor your coupon since the original receipt isn't intact? Your restaurant was dead and your drive thru empty. Are you really in a position to turn away coupons you personally put out? Hopefully this is the mistake of a poorly trained employee.

This place gave me a severe case of the stomach flu. 

I've never tried Fatburger in my life. So earlier today I was craving for a burger and passed by this one and saw it as a good opportunity to try one. Horrible experience. 

First, the food here was ridiculously overpriced. Call me cheap, but I consider paying close to $15 for a burger, a drink, and onion rings grossly overpriced. Secondly, the girl that took my order got my order wrong and didn't even give me the fries I ordered. Third, the girl that gave me my food first asked me if I wanted ketchup, to which I replied ""yes please"", and then proceeded to hand me a bag of food that I later found out contained no ketchup whatsoever. Fourth, the food itself was quite mediocre, at best. The burger was dry, and the onion rings were drenched in oil and tasted more like oily onions than onion rings. The only decent thing was the sweet green tea.

Lastly, and this is the major one, this place gave me gastroenteritis. For those who don't know what this is, it's the stomach flu. How do I know it was Fatburger's fault? because it was the first and only thing I ate today, and I didn't even have dinner last night. It started with some major diarrhea, led to severe stomach cramps, and ended with me in the ER at 3 in the morning. I can almost guarantee you that Fatburger either didn't cook or wash the meat thoroughly or some part of the food was contaminated. 

If you don't like expensive burgers, getting your orders wrong, dry burgers, oily onion rings, diarrhea, or stomach cramps via the stomach flu, then I HIGHLY suggest you stay away from this place like the plague.",73FJrLal7z88213nKkSVjg,4,0,1,GLoRPuXlon2q18gBykz4UA

i like that this location is off the strip so probably not as busy. it was pretty empty when we came. but we were in a group of maybe 10-15 people and they messed up (or forgot?) about 4 of our orders. the people at the end of our group ended up waiting days for their orders, having to actually go up to the counter, show their receipts and wait even longer up there. i could see other customers getting their orders with confusion and it seemed like the cooks were getting their orders wrong too? another person in our group placed an order of just french fries and waited a pretty long amount of time for them, then when they finally came out, they were cold!

First of all, the guy at the drive-thru had no patience. Every time he asked if we wanted something with an order, within 2 seconds of asking his question, he'd rudely say ""HELLO?"" Secondly, I ordered a sweetened tea, but was given an unsweetened one which the lady gladly exchanged. But when I tasted the new sweetened tea, it literally tasted like sugar and water with no tea flavor whatsoever and barely any hint of color. And lastly, I found a few pieces of wilted lettuce in my chicken sandwich.

The burgers and sandwiches aren't anything special. The only good thing about the meal was the Fat Fries. So overall, the meals are not worth the price. Even my drink was terrible.

This review won't include any whining about prices, it is what it is and you get what you pay for... Frankly if the price is too steep for some people they should just turn around and head down the street to Micky D's or something else they feel is worth the cost...

The issue I have with this location is the service. Yes, Fatburger can be considered fast food so it's foolish to expect much in the way of service. Employees should still be cheery and helpful, and the one that brought our food out was not. She just slapped a pile of trays with all 4 orders on the top one down on the edge of the table and walked away. I'd be more understanding if the place was busy but it was not. I also do not understand why each person's order was not on it's own tray. 

The same employee was less-then-helpful when I informed her that their tea dispenser was out of tea. She told me it was not and that I needed to push the button... which I had done, and nothing but water came out. She then told her coworker that they should check the tea, and walked out the door for her break... 

Like I said, I am not going to bitch about the higher-then-your-typical-fast-food-joint prices, but I will say that if you are going to charge those higher prices your should make sure the people you have taking the money and delivering the product are at least somewhat pleasent to deal with.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,1,2,yURf45jrkhdtKJN25wzoYw

I was properly warned that it takes quite awhile to get the food, and man were my advisors correct. We pulled up to the drive-thru at around 4 pm and didn't get our food until about 4:27.

This was our first visit to a Fatburger. When we walked in, I initially want sure if we were going to stay.  We were greeted by a stagnant water/ old mop bucket water smell  Additionally, many of the booths needed cleaned.

But as I said, this was our first time so we thought we'd give it a chance.

We ordered a medium burger, sweet potato fries, milkshake, bottled water, XXL burger, skinny fries, fountain drink.  At a burger place, mind you.  I was shocked at the total- $40.19!!!  For two people, at a burger joint 

I thought to myself, this better be a darn good burger for that price!

Our food arrived and looked appetizing. It was freshly made, hot, and our order was accurate.

The burger was good, but not $40 good.  It lacked seasoning and the cheese to meat ratio was lacking.  The skinny fries were crisp and tasty.  I'm normally a huge sweet potato fan, but these I would pass on next time.

So, I would go back to Fatburger if one of my friends were dying to try it; otherwise, there's other better burger joints that are more reasonably priced.",GkYbcZpZe541yW296kFOrw,0,0,3,48CILatlsYi38oCQtgHrXg

The cost for 2 sandwiches, and french fries NO DRINKS-$22.00- The chicken was some kind of rubbery processed junk- Dont bother going here!

Meat not fried hi temp and crusty but tasting almost steamed, and the bun was barely heated and bready instead of hot and toasted. Sad but true. Also no apparent  free parking anymore. Went late and had park in back and hope I didn't get towed. 

The LA founder must be very upset. Not true to the Fat Burger quality and service anymore.",5D39zNRO2MbvjfavkomBng,0,0,1,Jlnsd6s313z5FUAPZchLiQ

Recent visit:

The service was poor, just a bad experience that nobody should have to endure, especially at 3am. I am the only customer in the drive thru, keep in mind is approx 3am. We spent exactly 24 minutes sitting in the drive thru, yes i took note of the time waiting on our order which was nothing crazy, two burgers, two fries, and two milkshakes which cost us $33.00. 

The service was bad, no apologies for the delay, attitude as if we were bothering them in making them cook at 3am even though they are 24/7. I was way passed pissed when we rolled out of there to say the least! 

Note to DM: The night shift crew needs some customer service skills and time management training. 

I am dissapointed that I have to do a review like this from such a bad experience.

I will give Fatburger another chance, will just avoid this location and the graveyard shift, I won't forget this last visit, just unbelievable! Shame on them!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,2,1,o1Y51S4Q9-s3fFA0MmGH1Q
