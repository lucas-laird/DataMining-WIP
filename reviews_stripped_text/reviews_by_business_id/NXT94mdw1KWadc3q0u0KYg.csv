Nothing spectacular and all the meats are always dry and lack good flavor. The best item was the mustard salmon. There was not much else to comment on.

I called earlier in the week and spoke to Facia, the Assistant Room Manager, who informed my that they are unable to take reservations, but would do everything in their abilities to accommodate our large party.

Our group arrived shortly after 12pm on a Thursday and the line was minimal. Facia and her team did an excellent job of processing payments and seating our party in groups to expedite the process. We were all able to sit together at 3 large tables right in front of the dessert station.

Honestly, I'm not normally a fan of buffet food, but was impressed with the quality and selection of the food offered. My 3 favorite items (which were recommended by Facia) were the lemon pepper chicken wings as well as the pizza and stromboli, cooked in their hearth oven.

Our 2 waitresses, Wendy and Embet, did an excellent job keeping our drinks filled and clearing our plates. They were both very patient with my students, as they are from 9 different countries and have various English language skills.

This place is a good example of the latest Vegas trend of newly remodeled, upgraded buffets with a modern feel and higher quality food.
I didn't expect much of a strip buffet under $20, but this place is actually quite good and offers decent selection of great quality food. No crab legs but some good selection of seafood, ribs and beef brisket for meat eaters, and even a vegetarian station. The selection of desserts is also quite good. I would compare the feel and the quality to a more prestigious buffet like M.

The bad: My mom says the Asian food was very salty. my brother says the beef wasn't tender and I tried a smoked turkey leg that tasted like wood.

We have been to the )Palms many, many times over the last ten years or so. Eaten at the original buffet, Bistro Buffet and now the A.Y.C.E.  It was great and the price is right on point.  $43.00 for two of us including all taxes.  

The place is brand spanking new and bright and cheery.  Every employee we met was outgoing and friendly.  Our table waitress, Nacine, was on top of her game.  We were greeted quickly and drink orders taken.  Through out our meal she checked on us many times to check on our status and to see if we needed anything else.  Plates taken away quickly and table left neat for the next round.

Okay to the food.  This buffet puts our smaller containers of food and therefore keeps everything much fresher.  Items were replaced immediately.  Here's the list of what we tried.  We kept portions very small to try many different things.  We had:

Duck with white bean, General Tso Chicken, Walnut shrimp, Mussells, falafel patties, tuna poke, salmon poke, shrimp cocktail, cerviche, lemon caper cod, blackened talipia, smoke bbq ribs, smoked brisket, pork meatball in creamy polenta, green papaya salad, Brussel sprouts,and then desert:  lemon meringue, opera cake, sugar free pecan bar, cappuccino gelato, vanilla gelato, chocolate Ã©clair, macaroons.  All of the deserts were  small in size, but packed with whopping flavors.

All of the fish dishes were moist and cooked to perfection, the cod was a little bland needing more salt.  The big stand outs were the General Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, and all of the smoked  meats, plus the entire desert bar area.

I've seen a couple negative reviews of this place and based on our experience I just don't know where they get the negative.

We have lived in this area for a good while now, 7 plus years, and this was just plain good food and done well with great employees.  We even stopped one of the floor managers, Helen, and told her how pleased we were with the new A.Y.C.E.

Now to the Buffett.... super cool decor. Clean. Organized. Nice service by staff. We had to wait one hour in line for our Sunday brunch, but to me was worth it. The price is right, $22 pp for brunch. They offer a good variety of foods and great dessert selection! Brunch Includes mimosas and champagne too! It's short of 5 stars because I though the food was a bit cold and some dishes too oily.

Since Palm's was recently acquired by Station Casinos, their players card is now the ""Boarding Pass"" system. (great ! cuz i never had palm's lol). At $23.80 w/ coupon for 2 people, eh why not try it out, right? 

The A.Y.C.E. buffet is a newly renovated buffet that Palm's had done in the recent few months. My friend had came here for Brunch soon after our vacay in December and said the food was really good. Since then, been mildly wanting to try this place. 

Like most buffets, there are separate sections. 

Sweet & Light (Dessert) - pistachio and cappuccino gelato. both were nice. cappuccino had a decent amount of coffee flavor. there was this cafe latte pudding thing there too. Surprisingly, flavor-wise, it was like a cafe latte, without sugar (like how i'd order from a coffee shop). strong coffee flavor. borderline bitter for a dessert. LOL maybe they forgot the sugar. xD 

Smoke & Fire (BBQ) - Tried pork ribs and brisket. Pork ribs were super dry and hard to eat. Brisket was nicely flavored with a good bite, and a nice amount of smokiness. Not overly fatty but at this point, was full already. Lol i saw they had turkey legs but looked really dry. 

The Hearth (Italian) - Pizzas... made to order pasta station...? Pizzas/calzones/etc looked horrible so i didn't touch any of this. And the made-to-order pasta station was unmanned for half the meal. When there was someone, they were behind on orders. 

Somewhere in between here had a small ""bucket"" that has a crawfish overhanging the side with clams, mussels, shrimp in a light broth. Everything in this was overcooked. Full of broken shells and empty shells. I didn't find a single piece of clam despite having like 4 empty clams Lol... Shrimp was small, similar to the one offered in shrimp cocktail

The Roastery (Carving Station) - Surprisingly, the roast beef/prime rib was really well cooked and tender. They have a roasted cauliflower here too. Totally forgot to get it after being surprised at the thick cut of prime rib the carver gave me. Lol Add some sour cream w/ some horseradish, and some au jus to the prime rib and you're golden. The have elote (mexican street corn on a cob) in 3 different ways. Hot cheeto? dorito?, normal, and something else. Small portions poked with a skewer. The corn surprisingly is cooked well and not super soft, like most buffets. 

World Pan (Asian) - Of all things, surprisingly the honey walnut shrimp was good. Lol. The shrimp was nicely cooked and had a nice firm bite. Sauce was nice and creamy. 

I think there was one more section but i forgot to look at it Lol 

Oh the soup and salad station in the middle, right in front of the entrance had a few soups, fruits, and salad. As well as ceviche and shrimp cocktail, peeled and in individual serving containers. 

During or rather near end of my meal, i had realized what this buffet had reminded me of. Red Rock Casinos buffet. Then again, it is now the same company so not that surprising. Also, with a mild hint of Cosmopolitan with their individual plating, cute but mildly annoying at the same time Lol.. They had a lot of ""mislabeled"" stuff. I dont remember exactly example of things but it wasn't what was labeled. 

For the price i paid, and a full meal, without any ""after meal complications"", it wasn't bad. But even at the price i paid, i'm not that sure if i'd return again. Not much seafood options. With the options they had, really small and overcooked. ""Best"" thing they had was probably the roast beef/prime rib. I mean, then again, $12/person w/ bogo offer for prime rib dinner, i guess that works.. 

where was the raclette station some reviews had mentioned? gelato ice cream sandwich? whaaaa ? 

Service was pretty good. Our waitress had our drinks really fast, and new ones even before the previous ones were empty. Plates were cleared before you returned to your table.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,0,2,OZfWI9FwpN90wPaxCB0L5g

 I am supposed to be allowed to use the Chairman  line which moves much faster as it serves disabled guests as well ,however she denied me that right and said that I did not look disabled. I was forced to wait in the regular line and when I asked the cashier to call over the head manager she overheard it and became extremely hostile and sarcastically said again"" I told you you don't look  handicapped"". 

Not only did she deny me my right to use a line that's available for disabled people but she discriminated against me because of the way I look, in her mind I did not look disabled. When Edward came over (another manager) to our table I explained to him in detail what happened and he assured me that disabled guests are allowed to use the chairman line as it moves much faster and there is little wait.

 When I asked him why I was not allowed to use it and why she denied me that right he said he didn't have an answer and that he would investigate it and he apologized, I also asked him why would she be allowed to say I did not look disabled and I asked him to explain to me what disabled looks like and he said he did not have an answer. 

Regardless of his apology I find it extremely inappropriate and unprofessional that she was allowed to stay in the buffet and conduct her routine duties after such an incident.

There were some pleasant surprises that most buffets wouldn't have - like asparagus & honey walnut shrimp, which coincidentally were a few of my favorites. I was excited to try their Mexican corn, but was very disappointed. I got the cojita cheese one and it had way too much mayo & cheese, not enough lemon, chili flavor. I think they should change it and let the customers customize and add their own toppings. That would be a hit for sure.

I found that the offerings weren't overwhelmingly endless like in other buffets but the flavor of everything I tried was on point and some of the options were also served individually which I enjoyed.

But the food. There is no seafood, which is understandable for the price you're paying for. There is a smattering of smaller prepared seafood dishes like a pail of shrimp cocktail, small small small dishes of poke, and cooked fish. The shrimps were super tiny and reminiscent of the ones you get in the freezer section that you can stir fry. It didn't taste fresh. The poke bowls barely had any taste to them. Bottom line, stay away from most of the seafood. The cod with lemon and capers was not bad though. There is a decent assortment of meats, but most of us felt that they were too dry. I think there was a general consensus that the food was dry because the turnover rate isn't as fast as those buffets on the strip. I think my favorite dish of the night was the wedge salad lol.

For the price it I absolutely a great value. There were a lot of choices but not as many as you might find at some other buffets but the quality of every single item that I tasted was stellar!

I tried some potstickers and spring rolls. Salt and pepper chicken wings which were fantastic. A bowl of clam chowder. Poke salad which was as good as I have found anywhere. Since I read that the pizza at the buffet was fantastic I tried a small slice and once again it was great pizza with a great crust and great cheese and toppings.

There were many other items but I didn't want to overeat and I will be back for dinner soon to try additional items. There is very little seafood (I saw some Thai Curried Mussels, but there are many other choices. I was disappointed in the Barbecue station because there was not one beef item.

The salad choices are extensive and the fruit was fantastic. The watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew melon that I tried were great. The only thing I tried at the dessert station which was truly extensive was some pistachio gelato and that was as good as it gets as well.

For us, there was no line for dinner, and the cashier, hostesses, and server were all pleasant. We were sat in a central area which wasn't too loud or crowded and kept us close enough that the food wasn't a hike away from the table. So far so good. 

The food was just good. It was definitely nothing to write home to grandma about. There were some highlights for me though. The wedge salad was a nice fresh starter. My only complaint was the light amount of dressing.  The fingerling potatoes were delicious. They had a hearty amount of vegetarian dishes which I thought was great.  I really enjoyed the Asian fare, as did my husband. We brought my stepson, who is 14 here and he thoroughly enjoyed it.

Station recently took over the Palms and their renovations immediately focused on the dining options, and this buffet is a huge upgrade from the previous one under Maloof ownership. Space is brighter and more appealing, food is fresher with more variety, and we were pleasantly surprised by the overall increase in quality.

PROS: Several vegetarian and vegan options, including roasted cauliflower steaks at the carving station and jackfruit enchiladas! Their brisket at the BBQ station was on point. Good mix of trendy dishes like Doritos elote and mini poke bowls along with classic buffet staples like prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and a made to order pasta station. $18/adult with players card seemed about right. 

CONS: More than a couple of dishes were mislabeled (""mashed potatoes"" were actually sweet potatoes until they were switched out, second ""brisket"" tray actually appeared to be liver and onions, ""coffee"" flavored dessert was actually caramel, etc) and despite the focus on freshness and healthy options, the greens at the salad bar were past their prime and more than half of that area needed to be restocked. Service was polite but our drinks stayed empty after our first refill, despite us lingering an extra half hour.

At first glance the place looks amazing. Definitely a huge upgrade from the previous buffet. The hotel is really closed off because of the remodel but the cafe & buffet are completely redone. They did have the new smaller high chairs and everything was very clean. 

When we were seated our server immediately greeted us, took our drink orders and gave us a run down of the food stations. The concept is great but I felt like they were trying to make the buffet more tapas style but the quality of the food was not that great. The food was sitting out too long under the heaters bc most of the food was dry and the meats were over cooked and tough. 

The foods that were delicious and being eaten and replenished often were great (walnut shrimp, carved turkey, fresh fruit, and Mac and cheese) But everything just sat there.

1. Corn on the cob three ways! They brushed grilled corn with mayo and rolled it in crushed Doritos, Flaming Hot Cheetoes, and Cojita Cheese. It is soooo good I ate 4!!!
2. New to the buffet scene, they serve Thai Penang pork and Korean Kalbi beef ribs.  
3. They catered to both ends of the spectrum. As a vegetarian I was happy to find healthy light vegetarian dishes like tofu lettuce wraps as well as mushroom quesadillas and my husband who loves his meat found loads of southern BBQ beef. 
4. With a Station Casinos player's card you get a discount at the door.  Also, Station mails out 2-for-1 buffet coupons about every month when you sign up for a player's card. They apply here.
5.  Look for the Cinnamon-sugar coated taco shells at the dessert station! Yummy!!

It may be out of the way for types that like to stick to the strip, but the Palms is a fun excursion and the buffet is an added bonus. I really don't remember anything about the previous buffet, and I'm something of a Vegas buffet connoisseur, so that's definitely a sign it needed an upgrade.

I came for lunch and the wait in line wasn't terrible, about average for that time of day. The thing that attracted me was the price, its an amazing value for what you get and especially compared to some others around. 

The inside is beautiful, open, and bright.  Its easy to navigate, and not overwhelming.  Our waitress was attentive and it seems to be fully staffed.

One thing I love about this buffet that set it apart are all the little dishes. Instead of just scooping out heaps of food on a spoon, they make up these little bowls and plates, almost tapas style. Not only does it help control how much food you get, it just seems a lot less messy and more quaint. 

That said, everything was good! The sliders were amazing, and they have an entire section for vegetarian/alternative options that wasn't just a salad bar (I think this is the first time I've seen this at a Vegas buffet?)

They offer three variations of a few of their dishes, including corn on the cob.

They have a ""Raclette"" station where cheese is melted on small griddles and then poured on top of dishes of sautÃ©ed veggies, potatoes, and pasta. I saw slices of orange cheese and white cheese being used, likely something other than raclette, but I'm not sure what kind. If you like watching cheese melt, check this out.

The cinnamon roll bread pudding was the stand-out dessert item. The assorted macarons including pistachio, coffee, chocolate, lemon, and raspberry, tasted fresh, unlike the dry macarons at other high-end buffets.

For the price, under $20, it's definitely five stars. They don't appear to offer crab legs, which seems to keep the entrance line short, and that's also worth five stars.

What I love about this buffett and what makes it different are the pre-set portions, which you can always go back for more. This is such a huge advantage because it gives the cutest presentation and keeps everything fresh.

The assortment is very different than most lamb, civiche, premium shrimp cocktail, ribs and seafood boil soup. But the most impressive thing was the desert selection, all small petite offerings to allow you to try more flavors. 

The whole buffett was very clean, very fresh and hand crafted. Way to step up the bar!!",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,10,6,5,nOQ0SfY2gQD0TJUd-XkSwA

Compared to the last casino buffet to open, the Medley at the Orleans, A.Y.C.E. Buffet is way way better. I think it's even cheaper when using the player's card. They were about $20 for dinner.

Where do I start!? How about the last thing I had!? The desserts. They actually have a nice selection of some really good desserts. I probably had one of everything at least once. The Creme Brulee they served was the best I've had in a while. The custard mixture was rich and very tasty. It tasted like more egg yolks were used which I preferred. The chocolate mousse cake was also delicious. I had like 5 of them. They're small pieces. There's gelato, macarons, cookies, sugar-free things, and more. 

I honestly ate a little of almost everything except whatever was in the station on the far left.  I'll just mention a few of the items I really enjoyed. Everything in the salad area especially wedge salad. The chicken pot pie, turkey legs, BBQ briskets and rib, kalbi, corn on the cob, pizza, duck, mussels, salmon, walnut shrimp, and everything else. I was easily there for a few hours.

I did like how there were a lot of dishes served in small plates or containers. They're nice to have because it keeps dishes separate from other dishes. 

The only knock on them is there wasn't a made to order pasta station or crab legs but I'd definitely be back.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,16,11,4,jTzfl2Y7i3BvHwj_Tx5VZg

Price: $22 with station casino player card on Sunday night.

Environment: it's a good place to hangout with your friends and family, pretty casual dining place. 

Staff: the host lady was so nice, she was doing amazing job. During the time she lead me to my seat, she introduced me that they had seven food sections and her recommendations for the day would be French onion soup, which tasted pretty nice.
The waitress was different story, I understand as an buffet restaurant staffs are always busy, but through out the entire time I sit there, she didn't refill my water and drink even once. And she even purposely avoid her customers when the table next to me was looking her. Big disappointment!

Food: 
They had seven food sections.
I recommend the orange chicken and Panang curry, they fried chicken pretty well, and the sauce and the seasoning was on point. The panang curry was flavorful, the beef inside were super tender.

I also recommend the BBQ items on smoke section, almost every meat items here were so tender and juicy, that really surprised me. Even the steak here is tender and juicy, it not chewy or rubbery.

Dessert:
The do have variety of dessert choices. They even served macaroons, cream puffs, and cream brÃ»lÃ©es. However, the taste of those isn't surprised me as much as the BBQ items.

Overall, the food quality was not bad, but it doesn't worth $22 for sure. Waitresses need serious training. I wish yelp would let me put 3.5 stars, that's how I truly feel about this place.",R494UCWNG5FSg_yhndq1hw,1,1,4,hzHvJnYXhUQ8oHOC92elqQ

The Asian/Italian/Mexican/Seafood/American food sections are on par with other buffets in Las Vegas.  It's price after you get the ""Boarding Pass"" is very reasonable - at the base level a dinner goes from 21 to 19 dollars.

It isn't on the status of the Bacchanal buffet, but it is also much more reasonable and family friendly.

I took my son for his birthday and he was quite happy, and he is a finicky eater.  The pasta dishes, the southern food options, and the Asian options were as good as any other restaurant that solely serves those types of dishes.

The variety of food you can choose from is crazy. They've got the best and deepest variety of of food of any Station Casino Buffet and also a few other hotels on the strip. The food itself all looks, smells and tastes great.

This buffet is better than similarly priced ""cheap"" buffets I've been to (like circus circus), because it's super new (opened in Dec 2017) and the food is better than I expected for $20.  The main thing difference from fancier buffets would probably just be less seafood (they have shrimp and cooked fish options, but no crab legs and not much sushi).  I like the small portioned plates - they make the food look more attractive and (hopefully) help reduce food waste.

Also Salad's lover, A.y.c.e. doesn't offer a large salad bar selection as Red Rock Casino...
Before I talk about my experience let say that when you pay less than$20 for dinner you should not complain right? 
Let's be fair and honest, it's was good.
Also go sign up for a Casino Players card (takes 2mns) it gives you some discount when you pay :)
Choice is decent, what bothered me was that individual serving were close to cold, and stations were not filled appropriately for dinner rush
I read some many people writing about the macarons they saw on TV ads and not at the buffet... i might be lucky... it was plenty of them at the dessert station hehehe!
The host took us to our table. Nice and friendly. Our waiter offered us great service.  
most of their dishes are displayed in individual portion. which is smart, less waste!
Frenchy clin d'Âil with some traditional french dish like Coq au Vin, Cassoulet Ã  la cuisse de canard, soupe Ã  l oignon :)
The soupe Ã  l oignon was delicious, enjoyed the melted cheese!
The cassoulet was alright, i believe it was displayed for some time, the canard/duck was dry and cold :( the beans were almost perfect
The coq au vin was delicious and tasty! translated in english is like Roaster cooked in wine.
picked a salmon poke. The rice was hard :( 

the funny part is when I look at the salad bar. They offer individual portions of shrimp cocktail, ceviche (lemon doesn't look fresh, it's dried :(()
Like i said compare to the Red Rock salad bar... the bar did not offer many choices.
so here is the funny.. couple clients were looking for butter... nowhere to be found by the sliced bread.
A man was feeling his bowl of ""mozzarella mini balls"" till the station attendant said ""Sir, are you a butter lover?"" it was hilarious, I was giggling so hard !!! 
so the butter is rolled into small balls like mozzarella ... and placed next to each other... so don't get tricked ah ah ah
Pizza/Italian station offers pizza, pasta, calzone pizza...
Dessert station is small but offers good variety of ice cream and pastries. 
Like the macarons and the vanilla puffs!",XEH2VtVx5ZYATKEM4jZOXg,0,0,4,llDkHfAlb00lw6sfrdidOw

I've always believed the taste of food is more important than it's appearance or the restaurant's decor.  I've eaten breakfasts, lunches, & dinners at A.Y.C.E. Buffet.  Many of the selections are ultra fancy, small portions of unusual concoctions that look better than they taste.  In fact, most of the food is often too dry, too overcooked or undercooked, and tasteless.  My wife agrees with me and we will never eat there again.

The buffet, when the Palms was operated by the Maloof family, offered better tasting food, more variety, and a larger selection of food items, especially meats, salads, and deserts.",0PjSykzxXt8o98Qrm7P4pA,0,0,1,oKd6WknixuqjvT51D_0AEg

2861069,2018-01-19,0,NXT94mdw1KWadc3q0u0KYg,"**BRUNCH REVIEW** 3.5 STARS

New buffet? New buffet with a location close enough to the strip for some fun, but off the strip so you don't deal with parking?! YASSS. 

Okay, so a group of 4 of us decided to try Sunday Brunch here during MLK weekend around 12pm. Needless to say, it was a LONG 1hr+ wait, but we made it with a hungry appetite! 

Food selection: 4 stars. Brunch had a LOT of breakfast options, eggs a bunch of different ways, bacon in two areas, biscuits and gravy, French toast, pancakes, sausage, toast, LOX AND BAGELS, prime rib, brisket, etc. They also have a lot of lunch items such as the Asian food, international areas, salad area, small bites on individual plates, etc. Everything was pretty good, but nothing was very over the top that I can remember wanting to go back for. My cousin went to the Omelet Bar which was probably the highlight for brunch! 
OH AND YEA UNLIMITIED MIMOSAS FTW!  (BUT FYI, not consistent. Some batches had a lot of juice, other had barely any...at one point I figured I should just get champagne and order a juice to make it myself LOL) 

Size: 3.5 stars- the ads make this place seem huge and exciting, as if it were another bacchanal. This is not the case. The place was big, yes, and there were ""stations"", but It really is just an upgraded version of a station casino. It has the same set up, but obviously a little newer and classier. 

Wait: 3 stars. It just opened AND we went for brunch, but waited about an hour or more to be seated. 

Service: 4 stars Our mimosas were constantly filled and our plates were taken fairly often. Nothing amazing, but they do their job well and kept us satisfied :) 

SUMMED UP: 
For the amount of time I spent in line, the price and the food selection, I probably would give this place 3.5 stars, the 4 is for me hoping to come back for lunch or dinner to try. 
We paid 19.99 for brunch with our red players card **You only get the larger discount with higher up cards** 
The food was good, but not amazing. Some foods were definitely picturesque (individual small plates in lieu of scooping on your own), but nothing wowed me in terms of taste/flavor.
The wait was fairly long, but for brunch I really shouldn't complain much.
The area was pretty, but seemed like a nicer version of station casinos....where I can brunch for about $11 rather than $20.

I'd like to come back and try the regular dinner and lunch foods. I feel those would be a better deal :)",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,5,2,4,ibHYYBzSvrAul9LnSxa_1w

Well I did and I took the biggest critic I know, my mom. Well I have to say my mother remembered the old Palms with the small buffet and she said it was not the best. First I tried the Asian food station I must say that the rice was a little off it wasn't that great. Then we tried The Carving Station and the beef was really good. We stumbled upon the fried chicken wings and I have to say they were perfectly seasoned and little spicy and so delicious! Every vegetable dish we tried was delicious the vegetables were crisp and fresh. The mashed potatoes were really good. Now I must tell you the best thing there... they have a smoke station with ribs that are delicious and also you can find wonderful brisket that is both more moist and cooked to perfection. Wholesale treat yourself to fried turkey wings oh my goodness. Now the desserts to me were not good the ice creams were crystalled but the white chocolate covered strawberries were the bomb. We did go on a Sunday so we were able to have the champagne brunch; we got there around 3 and stayed till about 5 pm... just eating everything that we could. If you are new to Las Vegas or if you have been here for a while, you know that buffets in the past used to be really really good now most of them really suck.

Omelette station and regular pancakes, carved ham and two types of eggs benedict (go for the brisket one).  This was definitely pleasing and the things that they had there makes me want to go there again the next time I visit.  There were no overdried foods.  Desserts were mainly breakfast pastries and ice cream, but when transitioning over to lunch, they've got tiramisu and some other fine desserts.

TBH, I got more excited for this breakfast buffet and got more satisfaction than I did for the Bacchanal.  Maybe it was the price, maybe the quality, maybe both.  Bravo, Palms!",UcpQ_n_AlV4BbW60Zi_z8w,0,0,5,ABMoXBZQ7tCOC6LbQN7heA
2972861,2018-01-06,0,NXT94mdw1KWadc3q0u0KYg,"I went for the lunch buffet on a Friday. The total cost per person was $12. 
The Palms has a renovated, and beautiful buffet inside. (The Palms has been undergoing a lot of renovation, which in my opinion is a way better look then what the Palms was beginning to look creepy and dark).
They have arranged the different serving areas into seven divisions.  The foods presented are in small serving vessels, something like the excellent,and I would.... recommend the Wicked Spoon ,at the Cosmopolitan. 
     The recipes found at each station are somewhat different then the 'standard' stations casinos buffet foods. The recipes are not bad nor are they excellent. 
    The saving grace in the whole A.Y.C.E. experience is the area called 'Smoke and Fire ',which serves smoked meats. I had the best smoked turkey wing. The salt and pepper chicken found on the World Pan side of the buffet was very good and tasty. My picture shows the chicken, with the delicious olive salad. The other items you see on the plate, in the photo, not so good.  All of their fish dishes and the calamari were rubbery, dry, and overcooked.
   The desserts I think are a failure. In my opinion, the Station Casinos are below standard for what could be provided to the general public. (Eating at stations casinos desserts are often processed sugar put into the shape of something: be it pies, cakes or soft serve ice cream).  I had the pistachio gelato. The gelato  was heavy, lacking flavor, and loaded with sugar. It should not be called gelato in my opinion.
     All the other dishes presented that day looked bland and unappetizing with a selection of some odd morsels for a lunch time buffet. There is no Deli area which would have been a great addition to the buffet.- To serve a deli section as part of a buffet experience, for example like a N.Y. style would be great!  Stations have not done that, and in my opinion probably could. 
    I was there at noon when they should have been on their game at the salad bar which was messy, food around edges, with spoons that had been used for other salads put in with other salads. I chose not to eat any of their salad options except for their olive salad which was pretty good.
The staff were friendly and courteous. Their beverages average  Our waitress was good and for $12.... life couldn't be better. 
    I don't think I would take friends there from out of town , but would go directly to Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock, because they seem to just do it a little better with their tastes and some of their recipes.
 I will go back again in the future.  I will come back to this review with an update. Because it's the new kid on the block, for the locals, I would recommend people to go to it and judge themselves because like all food service there are off days.",pesJID974CXPUfe52GOd5Q,2,2,3,hwNPrU5USFD4rlyBAZgITg

I've now enjoyed breakfast, lunch, and dinner and think all are simply amazing. They overlap so no waiting for changeover, get both breakfast and lunch items if you come around 10am for example. 

Great price but get your players card first to get the discounted (advertised price) you might expect. 

So Much Value!
Food quality is spectacular. 
Unique and fun experience.
A lot of premade dishes so you can try several different things. 
Quick prompt service. 
Cheap price but 5 star food.

Service is fantastic! The cashiers are nice. They have 2-3 people to seat you and always friendly with smiles, even had few of them ask if everything was good while seated. They say goodbye and thanks for coming. Servers are the best, come around very often with refills and work together if on breaks or busy.

Managers listened to my complaints, signs are changed and things are labeled correctly (for the most part). The salad condiments serving spoons are better but still hard to serve, they'll likely improve it though. The fruit is kept full, haven't seen it like I did the first day I went. I said before the fruit needed a bigger tray but that's not true, I just wanted it to be fresher cut and kept full, and they stay on top of it now. 

Every food dish is made with care. Lots of flavor and unique items you won't find at other buffets. Some complained Stations didn't copy their other buffets but that's silly, they took a chance and now stand out from all buffets. 

It is my new go to spot. It'll be hard for me to justify spending $10 or even $20 more for less quality food elsewhere. Other places have longer waits and colder food and worse service.

Love the chairs and tables. Chairs are flexible in the back, well padded, and have a handle to easily grab. Solid wood table tops that are always clean and sturdy. 

They don't have a year long VIP pass yet but I'll be first to get one if they do.

The service was bad, and the food really isn't good. Our waitress never showed up with our drinks after letting her know that our lemonades were weak and asked for juice instead. We came here for lunch on a weekday and yes, the cost was fair but, that's about it. Its not a lot of variety of food dishes to choose from. The only beef option was a slider and the top of the bread was rock hard. Nothing was seasoned at all. The only chicken dish They had was salt and pepper wings that had neither seasonings. Not broccoli, string beans or any basic buffet foods. They had blackened catfish that looked more like a Mexican fish dish. I had mashed potatoes that still had huge chunks of raw potato in it that choked me. The pork loin and turkey I had was dry. Fried rice was hard as its been sitting out all day. Lunch started at 11, we arrived at noon. I have no idea why or how this place is 4 stars. $65 wasted. No, I won't be returning.",70bTHzJnMyBeSic4UtsgNg,0,0,1,HvgS0a7SHjB7txxjG4DM0A

We came close to 8pm and waited in line for about an hour. They close at 9pm but serves food until 9:30p.

Variety is a bit limited but the quality of the food is better than a lot of buffets I've been to. What I especially liked was the asian food. They had a curry, Mongolian beef and walnut shrimp that were all good. Prime rib was good too. The soft serve was not watery as I expected and was actually really creamy and good.

They also had a bbq station with chicken, ribs and brisket. The smoke on the meat was good but all lacked seasoning.

Especially for the price, this is my new favorite buffet in Las Vegas. I love the fact that much of the food is already set out as a serving size, rather than just a free-for-all, grab-as-much-as-you-can. The mini buckets of shrimp and seafood boil were awesome. The mini-tureens of French onion soup and individual plates of blue-cheese wedge salad are ingenious! The variety of foods is ample, and the dessert bar is better than most (the macaroons are awesome). If you like smoky BBQ, you'll really enjoy the beef brisket. They even had duck with white beans, which was amazing. It may not be the biggest buffet in town, but they do a great job with what they serve, and for $20 each, I have zero complaints.

One station had Brussels Sprouts and they were litterly uncooked, just looked roasted from the outside, seamed to be held under fire to look like cooked, but totally raw inside. Who wants to eat that? The ones served at the Asian Station were cooked ok. The 2 dumpling kinda things at the Asian station had some weird tasting meat inside, couldn't eat it. Had some grilled octopus, Love that normally and it was ok. One side was fine, the other side of it was tasting dry and burned. 
And the dessert station is a total fail besides the bread pudding and that sugar free tart. I'm
Not sure what you can do wrong with desserts, even the worst buffets in this town have better desserts than AYCE. I'm sure if you take care of those issues, it would be a great place.

This is not the buffet for prodigious amounts of crab legs and shrimp cocktail. Come here for 1) the flavors and 2) the quality. For 17.99 with players card, we enjoyed top quality dishes, most very delicately prepared. The cuts of meat they use are excellent. You have to understand that when you choose the mini-ramekin of Moroccan Lamb, you are getting fork-tender lamb chunks and not hockey pucks. The spices and preparation are spot-on. The Korean short ribs melt in your mouth like cotton candy. 

There is a honey-walnut shrimp to die for. The Mongolian beef is not only flavorful, but again uses a cut-above of meat that other buffets in this price range just would not use. Nothing tough or stringy. Also, the dessert presentation (cinnamon roll bread pudding with hot caramel sauce, for Pete's sake!) is what you would experience at a 40.00 buffet.

I received 2 - 2 for 1 breakfast coupons and my lady also received 2 coupons for a Palm AYCE Palms Breakfast Buffets.   We had not been to the Palms for 6 months and we went taking advantage of the 2 for 1 pricing. 

My review After liking the updated buffet premises: only change I really noticed an added a Gelato section, and a few more tappa style dishes.  I believe it is difficult for a Casino not have a decent breakfast buffet: cook eggs or make a omelet to order station, and have bacon, potatoes, and sausage very close to that to order station.  

The Omelet Chief was a very adept in remembering orders, he was polite but not a entertaining or cheerful type individual.  However he must be close to one of the top Omelet Chief the Stations have in their employ.  He was quick, & did not seem to confuse orders as some Station Casino cooks labor with.  Unfortunately he did not provide any pleasing customer interaction that is seen by numerous chiefs in Casino breakfast buffets. 

Maybe it was good the Chief was a good cook just following customers orders efficiently, as there were no Bloody Mary to greet the Hotel breakfast guests that may have been enjoying the Hotel facilities late into the previous evening.  

The remodeled Buffet was like most station's properties, similar in architectural style.  The new decor/layout in the Palm's was pleasing to the eye, food display has not changed as much from the Previous Palms buffet, but believe that is the result of three Chiefs hovering in the background that was keeping the staff on their toes.   

Added: Hard ice cream (Gelato area).  Price almost doubled.  No closing down, during change over from Breakfast to Lunch (a nice change).

Missing: the round Meat carving station that extended outward from center of food display aera.  Complimentary Beer and Wine served with lunch and dinner.  No Shrimp night on Tuesdays evenings as I stray from a Breakfast review.

Overall: I liked the location and newness of the premises, Hard Ice Cream (Gelato) was a necessary upgrade, with the Complimentary Beer and Wine being discontinued for Lunch and Dinner. A small ""no added Sugar area"" that includes 1 Gelato flavor.   I am worried when the hovering background Chief's disappear the buffet will suffer and the Palms AYCE will slide into a step above Sunset Buffet.  Currently I believe this buffet is a step below both Green Valley and Red Rock Casinos owned by the same parent company.  

If they send me a 2 for 1 coupon to use I will consider eating in this buffet, but I currently believe it is not worth $9 plus tip for breakfast with a Casino Card.  

Recently all Station owned Casinos have raised their buffet prices $2, including a competitor of Boulder Station, Sam's Town.",w9K_7MTRO610njK_qgbwcA,0,0,2,nRJ3nDTacUH-y8yUtHe6KA

In my mind I thought they were referring to an all you can eat restaurant, Lol. I quickly learned that a new local buffet just opened recently at Palms.

Upon arriving, there was a decent size line but it move quickly and seemed like the turnover is quick. Overall, the staff at AYCE were very friendly and had a great systematic way of clearing tables and refilling drinks in a timely and efficient manner. So kudos to the staff!! The ambience reminded me of Wicked Spoon at Cosmo with a bit of Social Libertine at Mandalay Bay. Kinda, of hipster style but value minded buffet that was surprisingly delicious.

Everything I had was pretty good. I personally like...
-Beef Brisket, Tender and the spices was good.
-Corn Bread, Moist and flavorful without being dried out.
-Raclette Station, Build your own mixed veggie and meat with melted cheese on top. 
-French Macaroons, these were amazingly delicious and they a good variety of flavors.
-Gelato Ice Cream Sandwich Station, This was cool and satisfying. Build your own ice cream cookie sandwich!

Overall, a great value buffet and satisfying dishes that will pleased everyone's taste buds.

My favorite items on the menu were definitely the mashed potatoes and the macarons.

Second, their ""paella"" looked more like potato mush from yams. Rice was soggy and turned into a pile of mush (see pics). Third, their food labels did not match the dishes displayed. You can see a cabbage salad that was labeled ""Cous cous salad"" this was just one of many dishes mislabel.

Relatively new to Las Vegas, this buffet began on December 22, 2017.  Besides breakfast, they also have lunch and dinner buffets!

Located in the Palms Casino, A.Y.C.E. seems to be a great deal at $8.99 for the Breakfast Buffet, but...the fine print alludes to this price with a Gold Players Card or higher.  Regular price is $12.99. If you have the basic card gets you in at $10.99 plus tax and tip.

On a positive note, the Parking is free; the environment is cheerful; and the service is pleasant!  It was better than other buffets because there was no line to get in, and it wasn't crowded!

There were so many different stations and choices, but I had to focus, knowing that my tummy space is limited.  I liked the fresh fruits, oatmeal, tapioca, and variety of breads the best!  The fresh Orange juice,  eggs Benedict, and quiche were also memorable!

I'm paying for lunch not breakfast. The server was overwhelmed and slow. She was polite but stressed out. 

Not to be funny, but sunset station was better and that's not saying a lot. 

Desserts were cheap and stale. Nothing wonderful.

Everything was either fried or drenched in sauces. The sushi rice was so cold and stale.

That disappointment aside the majority of the selections were wonderful. The walnut shrimp was incredible. I've never had a shrimp plate that was so much shrimp and so little coating. They did an excellent job with the poultry. The ceviche was delicious. Little things like mashed sweet potatoes were great highlights for me personally.

I passed on some pasta because it looked dry from sitting under the lamps for a while.  I was drawn by their flaming elotes (they weren't very hot) so it was a bit disappointing.  I also had a small shrimp cocktail in a miniature bucket.  Not bad at all.

For dessert, I had some macarons--they have it spelled wrong--a miniature eclair.  I passed on getting a handmade ice cream cookie sandwich because I was full by then.  It seems like a busy night would be the best time to be here as the food would turnover faster instead of sitting under lamps.

With trying some of the food, the salad bar area had three types of lettuce, decent amount of toppings and dressing. Also In the salad bar area there's a hummus bar with five different types of hummus to try. I tried the regular and roasted garlic and both tasted great.
The salmon sushi was very delicious, even though it's not made there, it was cold and the rice was soft. The Cashew shrimp wasn't bad, had a couple of warm and cold pieces. At the pasta station the cook was very nice, there's only two types of pasta to choose from and a couple of toppings and the serving was plentiful, so much pasta that I couldn't eat it all.
I love lasagna, however the lasagna was terrible, the sauce tasted water down and the meat was tasteless.  Tried a couple pieces of the beef bourguignan and it was cold, went up to the chef at the buffet and said something about how cold the meat was. The Chef tried a piece and agreed that the meat was cold and removed and replaced with a fresh hot batch.
On the dessert area, the fudge brownies were heated and tastes warm and outstanding and I had to get seconds. The cheese cake was also outstanding. However there was covered strawberries that had a pink coating on them and they were way too sweet.

This kinda opened the gates for me - I mean, I was OK with the Palms before the management change, but back then the buffet was really kinda lacking.  I mean before it shut down for renovations, it was doing 24 hour duty!  It was an all day buffet/cafe!  Crazy!

Fast forward to 2018 and the finished masterpiece that is now the AYCE Buffet in the Palms.  What an improvement!  They definitely went to a more Station Casinos theme, and for the better I think.  

Wifey & I waited a month or 2 before coming to the AYCE Buffet because it seemed to be super busy with all Station Casino player's card members wanting to try it!  Using those points, yo!  Even on the day we finally visited for lunch (with our locals discount), the wait in line was about 30 minutes.  But hey it was worth it!  Such an improvement!  We tried out tons of dishes:

-Duck Cassoulet with White Beans
-Moroccan Lamb
-Vegan Stuffed Peppers
-Calamari Steak
-Jackfruit Enchiladas (Yes!  Jackfruit!)
-Poke Bowl
-Shakshuka
-Smoked Brisket Benedict
-Watermelon Citrus Salad
-Shrimp Cocktail
-Ice Cream Sandwich with Cookies & Cream and Butterfinger

They gettin' fancy here!  Some wordy dishes, but some great new tastes!  I was really surprised by the Jackfruit Enchiladas, tasty!  Made for vegans!  Was consistent to actual enchiladas with meat.  The Smoked Brisket Benedict was a standout as well, good smoke from what looked like an indoor industrial smoker!

I could get used to being a local here at the AYCE Buffet in the Palms!  Definitely not disappointed.  Lots of choices for all, and the prices are still consistent with your Red Rock/Green Valley Ranch buffets.  And now with the added benefit of using your Station Casino rewards!!

We went two weeks ago on a Tuesday evening arriving about 6:30 p.m.  We waited almost 1-1/2 hours to get in...but the kicker is, there were at least six ready-and-waiting tables that were empty plus a high-table with about 10 seats that were totally empty.  We were escorted to the furthest section against the wall.  There was a table for four next to us that was empty the whole time until a few minutes before we left.  We had to ask the waitstaff for spoons, salt, pepper, and refills on our drinks.  She told us that the table wasn't fully set-up because that section was closed off until a short while before we arrived.  What???  Closed???  We waited for almost 1-1/2 hours to be seated.  Why was it closed?  The food was just OK, but we even had to ask for items to be refilled at the salad bar.  The buffet at Gold Coast is right across the street and even though it's not as ""fancy"" the food is better at almost half the price.  When we left at about 8:45 p.m. there were still people in line and we counted eight empty tables on the side we sat at.  Thanks but NO thanks.  We won't be going back.

There were some trendy options - Cheetos cob of corn, Buffalo Mac and cheese, raclette covered veggies, jackfruit enchiladas. They also offer the classics - prime ribs, bbq, stir frys, and pizzas. The trendy options were fun to try but I ate mainly their pork ribs and briskets (have to pick around for the perfect cut). Apparently they smoke their briskets for 10 hours?

Their variety of desserts didn't compare to wicked spoons of course butttt every item they offered was done well. The staff behind the gelato station was the sweetest. Genuinely eager to assist whoever is eyeing the sweet treats.

First, for value and quality, former Palms Bistro Buffet was much better than the new A.Y.C.E buffet. The old Bistro Buffet had quality salad bar and Italian station. 
Second, compare with the other Station Casinos, We like the Place Station which is cheaper and offers quality foods. Yes, they do not have fancy environment. But for value and quality, we would like to eat there.
Besides, Santa Fe station is also a good choice. Both Palace Station and Santa Fe Station offer better foods than Palms and Red Rock. Red Rock have not changed a dish for many years, unbelievable!

Don't know if it was the mindset, but the service was not the best so that could have overshadowed everything.

Don't get me wrong, the buffet looks great. Design of the space looks amazing. Very open. Nice and bright.

From the moment we stood in line, the expectations were already lowering. The woman in charge of the line took us out of the line we were at and moved us to the next register, where if she kept us, our group of 7 would've gotten in sooner. Instead, the group after us in the original line got through first.

When our group of 7 was sat, we immediately went straight for the food.

Pros: corn bread (stayed moist), walnut shrimp (retained some crunch and not overly sweet), individual wedge salad (lettuce was not oxidized and fresh no brown or wilted), cooked to order pasta, smoked brisket (flavorful and tender), carved turkey breast (moist), prime rib, coque au vin, mini macarons (ordered out), lemon tart (nice tart flavor)

Cons: turkey legs (dry), shrimp cocktail (shrimp texture was off and cocktail sauce was not like other station property- had no bite or body, loose), collard greens (no ham/ham hock), individualized clam bake (overcooked crawfish and other shellfish), pan seared salmon (overcooked), catfish (soaked up the liquid it was sitting in to prevent it from drying out),  tuna poke bowl (tuna didn't look fresh and very oxidized, no red ""fresh"" color,"" every other individualized desserts (lack luster, didn't know I could ever eat a ""watered"" down espresso flavor, but I did while my friend ate the same thing and his had way stronger espresso flavor)

Service: server kept forgetting our drink order refills. As part of the Station Culture: ""It's Everyone's Job,"" the busser was not very helpful. Our table asked him for help with refills and the response was typical ""union"" response: ""I'll let your server know."" I'm sorry,  dinner rush was finished,  plenty of tables were still clean and open and the time we asked he only had 2 4-tops to bus, so we didn't understand the brush off. ...

I recall the place was dull, small and forgettable.  But A.Y.C.E. changed that with an expensive makeover and completely new menu. 

The entrance is more dramatic with high ceilings and its name is bright lights. Stations are named to sound more like a description (ie. Smoke & Fire or Sweet & Light) 

Food are mostly served in smaller portions now, similar to Wicked Spoon. This is a kid ch better practice for people to sample more types, while cutting down on waste, I hope.  

Food wasn't outstanding in any way but good enough to satisfy.  Small poke bowl; fresh but bland. Salt & pepper wings; flavor was good but I got a piece that was undercooked. Sliders were very dry and well done. These are just a few that needs improvement. Other than these, the food was good enough for us not to complain but not great to be memorable. 

A big plus for me is they have hand scooped ice cream. They also serve cookies and premise ice cream sandwiches. Or you can create your own. Other desserts were also in smaller portions. 

Our server was great. Wish I remember her name but she's an older Filipino lady.  They also did a good job keeping things full.  

I can't believe I didn't know about A.Y.C.E. last time we stayed at Palms Place but there's a pretty good chance we'll go back.  3.5 stars for this new buffet. 

Tips: 

Prices are dependent on your level of Player's Card. Or if you don't have one, regular price isn't that bad at under $15 for lunch. 

If you like macrons & they don't have any on display, try asking.  If there are any left, they'll grab it for you.  

Lines aren't too bad earlier, before noon.  It does get busier after 12:30ish.  

Don't be a cheapskate, tip your server. Two gals next to us didn't tip at all. Lame.

Not included in the normal buffet price, A.Y.C.E. does have a couple nice beer options, and also has wine & mixed-drinks available.

Their grill bar serves up prime rib and short ribs that are tender and tasty.  I liked their gumbo and pea soup, while my wife raved about the penang soup.  Desert bar is off the chain.

We were coming in at 11am, and therefore some breakfast items had one foot out the door, while new lunch items were showing up on each visit to the line.  A bit exciting to see new variety at each round, although most was due to schedule I am sure.

And factor in that it was ~$22/person (without the player's card) and you got yourself a darn good deal of a buffet. 

The food was very good. Actually, their honey walnut shrimp was awesome! Our favorite version is the one at Panda Inn in Pasadena, and these were pretty gosh darn close to it! The shrimp were... shrimpier and less walnuts, but for the price, I'll take it! Husband tried the brisket and it was tough, assuming because it probably sat around a bit, but he got another one when a new batch came out and he said that was much better. 

The French onion soup was salty.. which I find it to be the case more often than not with that soup, but not bad.

After standing in line for 45 minutes in a human maze to be $19.99 each (from my understanding it's 21.99 without boarding pass,  19.99 with red boarding pass and 17.99 for yellow or higher boarding pass, which I had but was charged a different amount regardless).  After being seated,  you will notice that you get an ""A.Y.C.E."" pre-reprinted paper napkin (one per person and you will receive another one napkin per person if you ask nicely during your meal.   All alcohol is charged separately from your meal, so keep that in mind when your deciding what beverage you want to order and order 2 because the service for refills is slow to none.  The salad bar was nice,  just be careful with the sneeze guard because of you're over 5'6"", you will have a hard time reaching the back row of salad condiments, having to go in blind, fumbling for a spoon and hoping you've grabbed the bacon and not beets because you're nor able to reach and look at the same time(I had a difficult time and the attendant was even trying to help me reach because the sneeze guard is positioned really low) although the shrimp cocktail in little buckets was a nice touch but the soups were still the same as anything you'd find at a fiesta buffet.   The was a cold slab they used to keep these small dishes of poke chilled.  It was really neat to see but its so much waste of rice because the rice was what was being chilled, causing it to dry out and get crunchy.   If you're down for cold, dry and crunchy rice with 2 pieces of raw fish on top,  then you'll like this. THis dish wasn't well thought out but it was nice to see though.   I tried a lot of flavors and the pizza area seemed to be consistant, not the best ever eaten but more palatable then some.   The rest of the buffet was the same as any station.   They dressed up their flavorless mac n  cheese into single serving dishes with bread crumbs and processed swiss cheese shavings on top(a generic box from winco had the same flavor... move along there's nothung to see here).  The marinara sauces tasted fermented(spoiled) and led me to think certain dishes were overcooked and an after thought to get rid of quick by placing it on the line.

Buffet at The Palms particularly busy with a broad mix of patrons including Body Builders, Locals and tourists in town to watch the Final Four.

Currently celebrating Passover with a variety of traditional Jewish dishes in addition to the 'usual' items described as a ""celebration of All-You-Can-Eat,"" seven stations spread over a sizable footprint divided by cooking method and concept, it was just prior to 6:00pm that three guests arrived before the rush and found quick seating at a banquet near ""World Pan,"" everyone taking a moment to peruse the choices and plate number one comprised of Walnut Prawns every bit as good as what one will find on Spring Mountain Road plus spicy Noodles and respectable General Tso's Chicken.

Again impressed by such a radical departure from Station Casinos' Feast brand of Buffet, everything from the dÃ©cor to individual servings rivaling the standard set by Caesars' Bacchanal or Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, it was working with small portions that plates two and three took a look at several of the  Passover options plus a Dinner Roll and surprisingly light French Macarons, the Chopped Liver rich and creamy while Matzo Brei, Soup and Stuffing were all pleasant, though limited personal experience prevents comment as to whether others would think they were great.

Executed under the direction of Chef Joseph Kudrak, his time with Station Casinos at Red Rock earning him a role overseeing Palms Casino Resort as a whole, it was with plate four that the first misfire of the evening arrived in the form of watery Lasagna with overly sweet Sauce, the Stromboli and smoked Ratatouille a far better example of A.Y.C.E.'s Italian offerings while the French Onion Soup topped in gooey Cheese is also worth a taste.

Taking a look at the Roastery plus Smoke & Fire next, sliced-to-order Roast Beef faring better than chewy smoked Brisket while Ribs, Turkey and Morrocan Lamb Stew were all better than one might ever expect at a Buffet, those avoiding Meat will be happy to know that Herb Roasted Cauliflower, Mushroom Quesadillas and Cornbread are all very good while the layered pan of Jack Fruit Enchiladas may just be the best savory item on the whole Buffet. 

Priced at just $21.99 for Dinner, Station's Boarding Pass saving each guest $4, Dessert offers a whole island of items that shifts from morning to evening, the aforementioned Macarons as good as what is offered at the end of a meal at Le Cirque while miniature Carrot Cake, Cheesecake Parfaits, Lemon Meringue Tarts and Vegan Coconut Cookies all stand out amongst a collection that even goes so far as to account for dietary restrictions such as Sugar or Gluten Free.

Wrapping up with made-to-order Cookie Sandwiches plus three large-format Desserts, the Apple Cobbler and Fudge Brownie both nice landing pads for Soft Serve plus a variety of toppings, it warrants repeating that no visit to A.Y.C.E. should end without a heaping scoop of Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding plus or minus Ice Cream, Gelato or Caramel because save for *perhaps* what is offered at The Kitchen at Atomic there is none better in Sin City...and theirs is $8 a slice.

****1/2:  Sure some will point out the lack of (thin, frozen) Crab Legs or U20+ Shrimp, but at less than 1/2 the price and 1/4 the wait for Bacchanal or Wynn it speaks volumes of Chef Kudrak and his team that only two of fifty items tasted from A.Y.C.E.'s Dinner Buffet were disappointing while several were good enough that they could be menu items elsewhere - including Restaurants charging double on The Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,9,5,5ebGLysqJsFmNlovGH1u8g

Location: at the Palms casino resort, its kind of out of the way, not near any monorail stations, we had to lyft from the convention center.

Ambience: new, clean and comfortable, open dining areas with a casino view.

Service: excellent, attentive to details. Perhaps it was due to our great server Wendy? Out coffee was always refilled to the brim, even the dining napkins were aligned perfectly on the table with the restaurant logo facing you. 

Food: they dont offer any exotic or expensive items here, but using simple fresh local ingredients to come up with creative, fun & artistic eats.  Has vegetarian & gluten free selections.
Coffee: it was actually good, less bitter less acidic than most places, smooth although flavor not as strong, perhaps dark roast? Almost but not quite as good as the coffees in Japan.
Fresh pressed juices: served in cute shot glasses, its what this place is known for, today it was lemon, i downed 4 of those even though i am not a lemon fan. It was that good.

Actual food: very creative & fun, small servings in cute mini containers: smoked brisket egg benedict, tapioca fruit parfait (excellent), egg white fritatta, chilled glazed tofu (smooth), pina colada fritters, self serving/mixing cold ramen noodle station ( light & flavorful), made to order omelette station was good, gluten free pancake was very dry & a bit hard, bacons were not very enticing, they were dry and lean and in smaller pieces instead of whole strips?perhaps they cut away the fat portions?

Price: $14 each including tax. If u r a member its only $9. 

Conclusion: AYCE breakfast at Palms is now one of my new favorites at Vegas. Great bang even for a loser's budget. Simple yet delicious food that are fun & creative.

I actually loved the buffet, I usually avoid all Vegas buffets since most are either way over priced and mass-produced or just horrible. I've been to almost every buffet in Las vegas. So far for the price and food quality this is the best one currently. 

I actually saw the chefs make the food in the kitchen it seems nothing was brought from outside sources. I also saw the chefs blow torching the creme brulee. 

I'd say 90% of the food I ate was top notch. Only thing I didn't like was the salmon poki avoid it I felt it was inedible. The smoked pork ribs, smoked brisket and everything in the Asian section was awesome. They also had a decent vegetarian section too. They had roasted cauliflower in the carving section for slicing.

The dessert section was top notch, hand made ice cream sandwiches, creme brulee, gelato, also french macaroons. 

The best part of the buffet was how fresh everything was nothing was sitting around and old food. I read some of the reviews and I don't see how some people say it was bad. The buffet is not the biggest in Vegas like baacanal at Caesars but it's about quality and I think palms delivers.

Big tip: this is one of the buffets without a gap between lunch and dinner so you can walk in at 3:45pm pay lunch price and get dinner food that starts at 4pm.

 I originally rated this buffet 5 stars but I first went to this buffet on a Thursday and then went back Sunday for dinner again but the quality had gone down which lead me to believe that the buffet is inconsistent
In quality. When I went back again the dessert section was not very good as it was before, it seems their ice cream fridge went on a blink and the ice cream looked very melted. There also was no creme brulee and no french macaroon like few days before. This is disturbing since it was so good the first time I went.

We walked by this place while going around the casino. We stayed in the Palms Place so we were really close to here. An Uber driver recommended this place to us. And, based on my experience, when a local Uber driver recommends a place, you at least check it out.

The staff were super friendly and let us do a quick walk around before purchasing a buffet. We looked, we smelled, we got in line.

We stayed for the breakfast buffet, so I can only speak about that, but for about $10ish dollars a person, we couldn't believe that the food could be that good. I'm so glad we were wrong.

I usually think of buffets as ""a bunch of average food that makes up for the average taste with the overwhelmingly quantity"". This one, however, has a huge variety AND tastes great AND is super affordable. Seriously, this may be the best breakfast buffet I've ever had.

Overall, because of the clean environment, classy decor, tasty food, wide variety of food, friendly staff, & extremely affordable price, I'd say it's worth a shot. 

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if their prices go up soon. This is easily a $30-40/person buffet at a $10ish price.

The food was average to a few items below average. Nothing was memorable and there is nothing I would want to try again. It is probably one of the lower end quality buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas. I am comparing it to higher end hotels though.
We felt that because we had a two for one buffet certificate, it was OK. We would not have been happy had we had to pay the full price per person, because it simply isn't worth that much.
Getting there at 9 AM on Sunday was perfect for us because there was no line. When we left around 10:30 AM, having taken our time, the line was very long to get into the buffet.

5603766,2017-12-24,1,NXT94mdw1KWadc3q0u0KYg,"This buffet has taken the buffet standard to a new underwhelming low. The selections are Ã¼ber confusing to the point where you're lost in food translation. Their stations don't go by the typical buffet naming scheme, like Asian, American and International Flavors, their naming scheme goes like  ""The Revival"" and ""Hearth"". The only saving grace for their buffet is the carving stations and pizza. I personally prefer Bristo Buffet over this underwhelming reimagining. 

Their food selections aren't really great, to begin with, it's very limited and subpar, compared to other cheap buffets that I've eaten at. I expected that the food quality would be better, as I was told by a customer service telephone operator a couple of days prior to going to A.Y.C.E. Buffet, however, I've expected wrong. Bistro Buffet had the essential buffet favorites that it needed, such as typical Asian cuisine dishes, Fried Rice and Chow Mein, which is a staple for all casino buffets. I found myself a couple of times, moving back and forth by the buffet line, wondering what am I going to plate and bring to my table to eat. Yes, you can call me a slight picky eater, but looking at the selection presented to me, can you blame me?

My other issue is the Cashiers and Ushers, my mom and I stood in line on our first day there, along with other patrons for almost an hour, before we got to the cashiers. What I'm trying to allude to is that the Cashiers and Ushers are slow to allow the line to progress forward. I saw cashiers, just stand around and/ or count their day's take in the register drawer, when they should focus on getting patrons through the line and seated. I've seen many people who were a few minutes before my us, not stay to eat, they've left and requested their refunds. It's not worth $12.00 plus taxes to eat at a place that doesn't provide a variety of food selections, especially when the selections are confusing or unlabeled.

Palms Resort and Casino is a member of the Station Casino family, they should have built a buffet that matches the successful buffets of such hotels like Green Valley and Red Rock Resorts. Management of the Palms should have studied what makes Feast Buffets so successful and they should have emulated it with their buffet. I understand that Palms wants to set themselves apart from their sister hotels, by providing an alternative, but let's be real here for a second, has their previous buffet proven itself to be a success?..... Maybe, when they were an independently owned entity, however, today they aren't. Bistro Buffet wasn't a huge success, but it was the Palms buffet for many years, despite the ever-changing times and trends. 

The reason that Bistro Buffet stayed as the Palms chosen buffet is that it provided its hungry patrons the familiar buffet favorites and it didn't confuse them with eclectic station names. It was easy to understand where to go if you wanted a certain dish or cuisine, if you wanted Asian dishes, you go to the Asian station, if you wanted American, you go to American and so forth. I have a feeling that A.Y.C.E. Buffet won't be a successful hit with its current confusing and limited food selection. The Palms should rethink how they do buffets and change how A.Y.C.E. Buffet works. If they're going with the theme of ""All You Can Eat"", the food should reflect that, with their limited and portioned out selections, it defeats the purpose of the theme of ""All You Can Eat"".

As the buffet was transitioning from lunch to dinner, there wasn't anybody standing in line to wait for dinner at A.Y.C.E. Buffet, it was their second day since they opened. I understand that the line will slowly form, but normally at a buffet like Feast or MGM Buffets, as they transition inside, there is already a line forming outside. The line should have started to form a half an hour to 45 minutes prior to opening for the next meal time. A.Y.C.E. Buffet is going to see empty lines happen, if they continue to operate like this. If they don't want to see empty lines outside their buffet and survive, they should change how they do buffets.

I personally don't and won't recommend any of my family and friends to eat here. Like how I said earlier, it's not worth $12.00 per person (if you have a station casino players card) $14.00 per person (without the station players card). It's better to go to the Red Rock and eat there, because it's a ""Feast"" style of buffet, a true ""All You Can Eat"" buffet. Yes, it's a bit of a drive if you don't live near the Red Rock and it's a bit pricey, however, it's all worth it in the end, you'll end up leaving with a highly filled and satisfied stomach. Knowing that you've truly had a true All-You-Can-Eat experience at the Feast Buffet.

I know that the Palms is trying to cater to a certain demographic, but that's not what they should do, they should cater to every demographic. Which A.Y.C.E. Buffet doesn't do, unfortunately, with their eclectic and limited food selections.",7BqR5zk1O2s1znYt0hlNOQ,0,0,1,sHwinNpRSO425LRg349xKA

The food was better than expected. I really liked all the varieties of single-serving bowls; most or all of them had a poached eggs inside, great for mixing. With the poached eggs were corned beef, ham, rice, or bbq benedict. Of course they had the omelet station - gotta have it. Pancakes & french toast with fresh berries. Oh and the meats! Freshly carved ham, sausages, bacon, country fried steak... All so good. 

There's lots more like an Asian section with noodles, potstickers, and pork baos, an Italian section with bready pizza and the like, a ""Revival"" station for vegan/vegetarian section for superfoods like yogurt and freshly squeeze juices, and of course since it's breakfast so much from the bakery - croissants, rolls, bagels, pastries and so much more I didn't get a chance at because I was so full.

First we arrived at about 2pm it was not busy yet we waited to be seated nearly 15 minutes. Now I could understand the wait of they were not fully staffed or if they were busy but neither was the case. 
So now lest talk about the food, or should I say the lack of food. First the food had ZERO flavor, the mac and cheese was like eating pasta in cheese water, the pot pie was loose cream with a mushy crust, and when you describe an item as being pepperd you should put pepper on it. Over all food was just bland and bad. Also It seemed that every station had the same items. There was pork, turkey and sushi on every station. A buffet should have a variety and preparing the same item in slightly different ways is not variation. And all the food they picture or show in their commercials is not there. No ribs, no smoke sauage, nothing. 
Another big issue was the lack of cooks at any of the stations. We stood at the carving window waiting, and waiting for someone to assist us and nothing. We had to send a busser in back to get a cook to come out. Also when there were empty items I had asked a cook for more tortillas and he said ""yeah ok"" and NEVER brought them back. I must also mention the dessert station that was again unmanned.
We waited along with other guests for over 10 minutes, we asked numerous times if there was someone working here and was told ""I will go get someone"" and that never happened. 
I finally complained to the manager and the chef and was actually told I was the third complainant of the day about the exact same issues.

I can't say how impressed I am with what the Station Casino company is doing with the Palm's Casino. Yes it is under construction but we didn't have any problem parking or walking through the casino.

The A.Y.C.E buffet was impressive for such a great price. The servers were awesome, always bringing drinks even after we sat for 3 hours catching up, talking and snacking. I really liked the duck confit, french onion sliders, salt and pepper wings, vegetable stromboli, french onion soup and clam chowder. We even had the pasta station cook shrimp with garlic in a wine sauce without the pasta which was delicious. I only had 1 cold item, it wasn't that great for a mushroom quesadilla and I didn't like the hummus and pita. For the deserts, I definitely recommend getting a waffle cone and putting some of their ice cream or it might be gelado in it. The mini creme brulee, mini lemon meringue pastry and carrot cake were truly perfect sweet bites and I had to stop myself from getting a second plate of them.

I will definitely be going back to the Palm's Casino for the A.Y.C.E buffet and so I can update this review with other memorable dishes.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,1,0,4,1OV1zsVlN77fWCfcMu8qgw

The renovation turned this place to be more modern, but the quality of food is still, that of a smaller casino crowd. To me, the quality still doesn't compare to WS. The A.Y.C.E. Buffet's similar style to WS by offering small individual servings is a nice feature, but taste and quality of the food is key. 
I'm not a big dessert person, but the dessert section was actually my favorite station. Their meat station was mediocre. Their beef selection was just roast beef, not even prime rib. The pork loin however was perfectly tender and moist. A lot of their entrees were dry and over cooked. 

I guess overall the price for the buffet is by far a lot less compared to the larger Strip buffet restaurants. The server we had, Marilyn was the best thing from our first experience here at A.Y.C.E. Buffet. Her attention and constant clearing of our used dishes was very much appreciated. Her attention to refilling our beverages and her willingness to go above and beyond made our visit a pleasant one. 

I think my 3 star rating is appropriate for its not horrible, but just average.",TX9sluY-YVY4iZrJmg26fQ,1,0,3,yKCBioRY0vKMY9jNlWT25A

There is hardly ever a huge line like most other buffets and free casino parking which is nice. The staff has always been extra friendly & assisting.

This buffet is even worst than palace station. You can't get any worst than that. Not much selection for the price. Overall food is dry cold and tasteless. Local been to many buffet. This is the worst. Palms used to have Wow!!!! Restuarant. Stations just ran it into the ground . Tasteless. Save your money . Try somewhere else,kKnBdaG5eQPLZ0p8J0kkfg,2,0,1,IE7OA6ZJnidTUq4n8dqcvw

The best part is that the price wasn't hiked up more on top of the weekend pricing due to Easter Sunday (unlike other hotels on the Strip that increase their buffet prices days before the actual holiday, wtf!). **Note: Easter Sunday is priced more but you do get booze options!**
Since AYCE/The Palms is off-Strip, they probably do need to offer the incentive for tourists and locals to offer a deal that would compete with the other Vegas buffets.

I feel like they have enough for what they priced which is a plus in my gradebook. There's a meat carving station, crepe station, ice cream & desserts, Asian food options (the bbq pork bao was decent...way better than the ones I had at the Bellagio buffet), yogurt/oatmeal plus fixings, pressed juices in double-shot glasses (nice!), some gluten-free options for the health conscious (lol), and the usual breakfast fares (pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage, eggs benny, corned beef hash). While I can't say it was the best food ever, I say it was delicious enough to warrant praise, especially for its price. It was tasty enough to feel satisfied, and not getting sick is always a good thing too.

Sorry kids...no crab legs or oysters during breakfast, but then again you should be paying more for that kind of breakfast option. ;) 

The server who attended to me was friendly and consistent with coming back to top off my water glass. She even made sure that the other servers or the restaurant greeters didn't clear my table away as I was dining solo. Major kudos, totally deserves the extra tips.


Will definitely be returning again!!",qNmalUH9giHO-0WuMkmLzg,3,2,4,yaO1nTAnMpA4Z2IHKrzQXw

If you want to try all the good stuff you have to come back the day after for round two. Lucky me I work right down the street. Morrocan Lam, Peking duck, Smoked Beef Brisket, Hawaiian Poke, Southern BBQ, French onion soup, Orleans Gumbo, New England Clam Boil Coq Au Vin. I'll get rid of my kitchen and just come here to eat. Whatever diet you are on the Mediterranean, Keto, Low Carb, Vegan  they got it. This is about small healthy fresh cooked plates. Tasting festival of food from all over the world.

5995156,2018-05-28,2,NXT94mdw1KWadc3q0u0KYg,"The Palms is now actually a Station Casino which is amazing for locals. The idea behind this buffet is to offer low prices with a quality delivery. 

The first time we went took about an hour wait, and I'm assuming that it's because they were so new! The other times we stopped by, the line was quick and we hardly waited which is fantastic because we always come hungry. 

The food is great with lots of choices like corned beef hash, elote, bbq chicken, and many other fancy foods that I can't name. My favorite there are the choices regardless of any time you're visiting. It's definitely not Bacchanal Buffet, but it's certainly delicious for the price you're paying for. With that said, I recommend to try bits and pieces of every dish. 

The service is a borderline miss, but they really try to get your drinks refilled. I believe there was only one time when our server hardly paid attention to us, but even then, that did not stop us from coming back. 

A must try especially when you want to try amazing food outside the Strip.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,3,2,5,XPloHeA_yc_-p-xNK8wbcg
