26703,2015-04-07,0,4iLbq_AUiWtsSKHFpG5cbQ,"Jason and his team at Food Factory have been preparing healthy meals for me the last month in my quest to lose weight and feel better. Besides being healthy, they taste great and are reasonably priced. The fact that I now look forward to eating vegetables is a credit to Jason's skill as a chef. 

The atmosphere at Food Factory is laid back casual and the service is excellent. Food Factory is located inside Spectators at the corner of Durango and Flamingo.

Check it out !",1moKpP6RVCgnL8QGsyDjVA,1,0,5,gEF8x_pUC234uv1344jkbQ
94924,2015-09-14,2,4iLbq_AUiWtsSKHFpG5cbQ,Located inside Putter's Bar. Separate dining area. Half pound stuffed burgers and sliders on the menu. Choice of sides like Mac and Cheese or onion rings in case you don't feel like the crinkle fries. Friendly service and no problem taking my Amazon local offer. We will be back to try the Colossal Nachos.,A4UX1tNsNCkhXMoLXCrLwQ,1,1,5,y2hf7d3KcOZRaGxIZ82uzA
393516,2015-03-01,1,4iLbq_AUiWtsSKHFpG5cbQ,"Not sure where these other people eat, where they would rate this place five stars. We've eaten here a few times when it was Carlo's Kitchen, he had good food, horribly slow service, and church basement-like atmosphere, but good food. 
This place, same atmosphere, not as bad service, and the food was well......
Potato skins: potatoes tasted like old potatoes that were not cooked all the way through, ate topping left the potato
Pretzel with cheese sauce: decent, wife liked it better then I did
Sliders: dried out buns, charred burgers came with 4, ate half of one, horrible.
I will say the sauces that I chose were good ( 1000, ranch, onion aioli)
Mac n cheese: not bad,but dry as a bone
Cali chicken sandwich: dry bun, flavorless grilled chicken, wife ate half before giving up.
Cajun FF: eh
Not sure how long this place has been open, but from our experience, it won't be for long.
Sorry guys, we love giving new places a go, but to get people to come back you've got to have good service, and even bad service can be overlooked if you've got great food.",XifTHaTNMK-SoSEJfCRSPA,5,2,2,ZWvoj42_dGlMy3r-g8m2OA

Had a bacon cheese burger which was amazing ... could tell the meat was fresh ... not your average bun ... french fries were fabulous ... and you actually get a pickle not a sliver of something resembling a pickle but a scrumptious half pickle!!

1497011,2015-09-21,0,4iLbq_AUiWtsSKHFpG5cbQ,"We ordered from here thru Bite Squad (a horrible experience) and the food was awful. I called the restaurant and they tried to blame Bite Squad. Well, Bite Squad did not prepare the food. The quesadilla was pretty much processed cheese in a tortilla and cooked in a microwave to melt the cheese. The fries were cold and hard, pretty sure they were frozen and microwaved. The poppers were frozen which I guess is OK if they were a good frozen but the breading was awful, very little cream cheese. I would be embarrased to serve this kind of food if I was the owner and chef. I miss Carlos Kitchen that used to be in this location. Won't be ordering again.",ZXhPWBvHdvOhqslICUQPjQ,0,0,1,49VTCVmwyNp349Vj2KOnoA

2041550,2015-07-12,2,4iLbq_AUiWtsSKHFpG5cbQ,"Stopped by for some late night eats and found a place to add to our favorites list.  The menu is fairly small (which is a good thing for this girl since it usually takes me 30 minutes to decide what I want) consisting of mostly burgers, sandwiches, and pizza. 

We ordered the potato skins for our app. They were loaded with cheese and bacon and a nice portion of potato innards left on the skins which you don't get too often. They were fried to crispy delicious perfection. 

I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich it was really good. The homemade BBQ sauce was smoky and sweet and was complimented nicely by the homemade slaw. The brioche bun was even a step above the regular sandwich bun. 

The guy ordered the BBQ burger. It was huge...lots of smoothing had to be done to get a bite. It had giant onion rings and thick cut bacon and that great brioche bun again. He loved it. 

We both chose the mac and cheese for our side. Usually I'm really disappointed in mac and cheese at restaurants but this was probably the best I've had that hasn't come out of my mom's kitchen. Very cheesy and creamy. 

We got a pretzel to go for a salty midnight snack, it was pillowy and salty (which is a good thing), everything a pretzel should be. 

The service was great. Our server, Rosie, was super sweet and very helpful. She stopped by often and chatted with all the tables which is a nice refreshing change from the normal ""cant be bothered"" attitude you get in most places. The great food and service was topped off by the sounds of karaoke night wafting in from the bar next door. Was great for giggles and even a little sing along too.

It was a big burger and tasted excellent, not the pre-made stuff you see now a days. I also got the homemade Mac & cheese, and an apple pie to top it off. Not a single regret, the owners are very nice and the chef personally came out and greeted us. This place is definitely worth stopping by, and I'll be coming by again for sure! P.S. The appetizers we got were pizza and nachos, both were awesome, the nachos were of a big portion too and tasted great. I say hit this place up!",ZML1O94sfUN3XicWR7c27w,0,0,5,cHx8LP6ogSqLhnqfdBUaKg

When my family and I got in the restaurant we met the owner (very down to earth, nice guy) and we get seated. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and I was completely astonished on how much flavor it had. This wrap completely blew me away, it was beyond anything I expected. I am a big fan of buffalo sauce and this buffalo sauce hit the spot. The fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Everything about my entree was phenomenal. My boyfriend had ordered a hamburger which was so juicy and literally melt in your mouth with the most exquisite flavors. On the side of his burger he had Mac n cheese and I would have to say hands down that it was the best Mac and cheese I had ever had.

But this is NOT your ordinary bar food, more like American gourmet. I was doubting the Mac and cheese reviews; people saying that it was the best they ever had... It WAS the best I ever had lol!

4293820,2015-02-20,0,4iLbq_AUiWtsSKHFpG5cbQ,"I have to say, I was excited to try this place because when I see a new place with perfect five star reviews...from people that only wrote a handful of reviews each, I get a little suspicious. Are they really real?!

Well, it seems they are! This place delivered on all of these great reviews. The food was extremely delicious, and my wife and I were super impressed. We got the appetizer sampler platter which had a TON of food on it, and so we got to try most of the appetizers. Standouts were: Mozz sticks, potato skins, jalapeño poppers. The buffalo wings were also perfectly fried, but they weren't covered in sauce because it came with it on the side.

We also got the juicy lucy burger, and that was also really really good. I don't know why more places don't do cheese stuffed burgers! My mom went through a phase where she loved to make them like that, and I thought they were the best thing since sliced bread! This place gets how delicious it can be, and nails the execution.

As a side for the burger, we got cajun garlic fries (additional $1), and they were awesomely seasoned. We also added an extra side of mac and cheese after the rave reviews on Yelp. Was it the best mac and cheese I've ever had? Definitely not. Was it really good? Yes! It was absolutely above average, and I loved the fact that it had a bunch of different cheeses in it. Mac and cheese is alllll about the cheese after all :)

The atmosphere was OK, it had a smoke smell coming from the bar area, and the whole place was empty on the restaurant side. That being said, our waitress was absolutely wonderful and we enjoyed our meal fully.

We will be back, and if you're thinking about trying this for some great bar/american/fried food...don't hesitate, just go. It'll surprise you, won't break the bank, and seems to be run by some really nice people.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,2,0,4,AcXGFq6-zQLW8bVuBajCkw
