Mingo was staple for my wife and I until early September.  We took some family there from out of town.  My sister-in-law complained that her taco tasted of mold.  My first two tacos were fine... until I ordered a second round of tacos.  We told the manager and he took my sister-in-law's tacos back because she was no longer hungry.

My second set of tacos came and after the next bite, it would be my last.  I could taste the mold.  Unfortunately, it was hard to tell if it was the flour shell or the salad garnishment.  Regardless, I told the manager again about the mold and he asked if I wanted to replace them.  I said ""no thanks.""

The food here does not take itself very seriously and that's not a bad thing, at all. The food here is definitely designed to make you feel comfortable yet still make you feel as though you aren't eating at home. A perfect example of this is their open faced egg sandwich. This is a meal any college student is probably vaguely familiar with due to it's simplicity and deliciousness. Mingo however takes that feeling of comfort, adds some delicious fotina gruyere, avocado, and thick cut bacon and serves a sandwich that is unforgettable.

We were immediately seated outside, in the shade as we requested, while one of the servers made sure to clean our table (it was a bit breezy outside and some leaves were falling off of the trees on to the tables.)

Our server, Eddie, was very friendly but I could tell that he had some ""stress energy"" surrounding him...sure enough, later in conversation, he said that it was his first time serving Sungay Brunch (that's not a typo, by the way) and it was very busy.  In spite of that, he remained composed and professional with our group, one of whom had to order immediately as she is very pregnant, hormonal and one HUNGRY woman!  :)

While I'm not a fan of brussels spouts, they seemed to come with every order and they were very, very tasty...tossed in delicious olive oil (??not sure) and topped with almonds.  

Two of my friends enjoyed the menu so much that they placed orders to go.  

At the table next to us, the diners greeted us with smiles and then said goodbye to us upon leaving.  This left a fuzzy warm feeling in my heart and revealed that customers of Mingo's are happy people!  

I decided to leave my ""doggy bag"" at the table as I had to run some errands and didn't want to eat cold, unhealthy food hours later and one of the servers ran out after us in the parking lot with the food.  She didn't have to go out of her way like that...very much appreciated!

309447,2014-02-17,12,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"Fast forward due to yelps word limit. 

The table that came nearly 15 minutes after is has received their meal.  I know my timing is accurate as I have been watching my clock on my phone the entire time. We were trying to be out of there by 3:15 so that we could make the Roos n More zoo benefit at Zappos. It was already 3:15. We arrived at 2pm. We have not received our entrees yet. 

The hostess, who is also running food, walks by and we ask her is she has an idea of how much longer we need to wait for our food. Her demeanor changes. Condescendingly, she tells us ""they serve quality food here and it takes time"". I have dined at Joel Robuchon on more than one occasion. That restaurant has three Michelin stars, and their food does not take anywhere near this long to prepare. How could french toast, a grilled cheese and a fish sandwich be expected to take this long? I'm pescetarian. I cook fish every day. Even if it is being prepared via sous-vide, it should take no longer than 30 minutes. Bewildered, I repeat that we have waited nearly 50 minutes. The hostess raises her eyebrows puts her index finger to her lips and ""shush's"" us. She actually hisses and then angrily reminds us that we are seated next to their ""investors"" and tells us to say things quietly so that their precious ""investors"" don't hear. 

My girlfriend did not respond very well to that. Loudly, she tells the hostess that she will not be quiet and that the investors they are so worried about should probably hear what we are talking about. With a panicked look on her face, the girl threateningly replies ""You want me to go and get the manager? Because I will go and get George!"" Without waiting for a response, she does, in fact, get George. In retrospect, I respect her for subtly warning us what we were in for. 

Clearly displeased to have his feeding session interrupted. The manager  finishes enjoying a few fries from his plate before coming by. He lumbers over, still masticating, crumbs spewing from his lips as he attempts to swallow the large quantity of deep fried potatoes visibly struggling to find their way down his esophagus. Uninvited, he takes a seat opposite us. The fish and french toast arrive. The grilled cheese is nowhere in sight. 

""So, what's going on?"" 
We told him our food arrived after waiting nearly 50 minutes. He told us that it's our fault because we ordered the fish. And fish takes a very long time to cook. Incredulously, I informed him that fish is the quickest cooking of every animal protein source. I asked him if he ever cooked before. 

Then he proudly, and very defensively informed us that he ""owns this place"". Next, this rather large man points at my 100 pound girlfriend and instructs her to ""just sit down and enjoy the meal. It's the best fish you're ever going to have in your life."" 

The grilled cheese arrives. 

My girlfriend did not appreciate being bossed around and dismissed as though her complaint had no merit. In fact, I believe this is the turning point in which we both became visibly enraged. I was confused, my entire body was shaking with rage, and I was fighting back tears. She told the manager that he had no right to tell her what to do, and that she would not just sit down and enjoy the meal. The manger responded ""So leave then!"" My girlfriend responded with a resounding ""Oh, we will."" 

Horrified, the entire restaurant, precious ""investors"" included, stared at us, jaws slack, eyes filled with pity. Realizing an opportunity to twist the situation and make us the bad guy, he demanded we pay for the meal we did not even stick a fork into and insinuated that we were creating a scene in order to get something for free. My girlfriend happily agreed to pay, and directly called him out on accusing us of not having the money to pay the bill. He then barked at the bartender to come and process her debit card. While waiting for the card to go through, my girlfriend turned to the horrified ""investors"" and apologized for disturbing their meal by making a scene.She mentioned that they should reconsider investing in a business that is owned by someone so classless and unprofessional. One woman, with empathy in her eyes said it was okay, and they all looked like they felt for us. Interrupting her apology, the manager insisted that they are not investors. My girlfriend insisted that every person on their staff said they were investors and thats why we had to sit at the lounge tables instead of a real table for lunch. Failing to find anything rational to say, the manager/owner then demanded to know where I work so that he could come in and complain at my job, like we did at his. He proceeded to yell at us and tell us we are a ""bunch of a**holes"" amongst other unnecessarily profane things for creating a scene. As we were walking out, he yelled at us to never come back. 
I told him to go f*** himself. 

This happened because we asked why our food was taking so long. 

We asked. Asked NICELY. And we're met with this response",DX8RR8U2XokVgSbhqR8TZg,27,9,1,rdQrAiKMiZiVwAkgR3wTsg
323979,2013-05-20,0,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"Met several friends prior to a Smith Center show (Billy Elliot--great show!).

Location is great and readily accessible from Downtown and I-15 via Charleston. The parking lot is a total disaster, and I hope whoever operates the parking lots has good liability insurance because a lot (no pun intended) of people are going to either damage their cars or suffer trip and fall accidents getting too and from the Art Square bar area.

That being said, the open air concept and the courtyard area are really nice and the interior space has a trendy and upscale vibe. The walkways are a bit narrow in the ""dining"" area, not sure how this will work when they get real busy. Also not sure how the open windows will work in the summer heat or winter cold, but it was really nice when the weather was in the 80s.

When I arrived, I asked about Happy Hour that I saw on their Facebook page, and the female bartender said it was over at 5 PM. I had just read it was over at 6 PM, and the male bartender tracked down a happy hour menu for me. The happy hour pricing is quite good for the cocktails and wine. The did not have the white wine (chardonnay)  that was listed on the happy hour menu and offered an acceptable alternative ($6 a glass for a nice pour) and  the Skyy martini was good for $4. I did notice other people had draft beers (specialty beers on tap) poured in some ridiculous highball glass. I sure hope they plan on getting some proper 1/2 pint and pint glasses if they are going to consider themselves an ""upscale"" drinking establishment. The bar service was very weak with ""I just started today"" excuses from the staff, although the bartenders were really nice, just not trained by the management (the bartenders seemed to have a lot of trouble with the point of sales register system). I did see one of the co-owners behind the bar, he should spend more time training his staff rather than trying to play bartender.

The HH food only included 1/2 price wings and some hot dog item. The wings were not very good, tiny, not particularly spicy and clearly just dumped in the deep fryer.  We ordered a few other items, sliders and salads, and they were ""ok"" not great (sliders were small and the salads were heavily overdressed). I think they really need to reconsider some of the items and the price points (the hot dog with a few toppings is about $7, silly). 

Overall, I would check it out after they are open a few weeks and the staff gets some training. I hope in the meantime they tweak the menu.",9OpckhDCX_IahF9YpLZLhg,1,0,3,VflgHSxLYyn2NoAV6lc5vg

If anywhere in the downtown vicinity and looking for dinner, I highly recommend Mingo.  They have patio seating outside in the Art Square courtyard that is perfect for Spring evenings.  This is a tapas style restaurant with a very nice craft beer selection and an excellent Happy Hour.  From 5-7pm, the Happy Hour worked for us on a Saturday.  In the $5 to $7 range, my party of 3 shared everything.  

We had edamame, roasted brussel sprouts, fried rice, the Kanye bacon-wrapped hotdog, Mahi Mahi tacos, and fish and chips.  The flavors of each dish were well planned and well executed.  The brussel sprouts were my favorite - roasted with candied almonds and raisins.  The Mahi Mahi tacos and Kanye hotdog were classic items decorated with the perfect toppings to make them extra special.

As to the ambience: I love the decor it's a chic fusion of modern and vintage, with good lighting balance and unobtrusive and appropriately current music. It looks more like a cute big-city place you'd see in LA, NY or SF. Unlike a review I read, I disagree that it is pretentious, but I guess one could say it is ""hip."" So if you hate fashionable details you may not love the look.(I loved it so much I sent a few pix to friends and co-workers.)
Service: Super warm and casual. If you like staff to treat you like a regular or friend, this is your spot. Mingo, the proprietor and namesake, stopped by our table and was super friendly and obviously cared that the diner's experience is great. If you are a stickler for formality, you could find it a bit laid-back. Personally, I love candid staff who give honest suggestions and act "" real"":-) 
Food: It's not a huge menu, (I was there for lunch) but every choice is tempting. I think they manage fusion without overreaching. Everything was delicious (and  for any fitness types or non-meat eaters, the menu has more healthy and non-meat options than you would expect.) I think the prices were reasonable and portions a healthy size.
 I'm saving my favorite part for last....Mingo is dog friendly! You can bring your dog(s) to chill at your table on the front patio. There is a clever design detail of an industrial metal door that opens up the bar and restaurant to the patio. It makes it like a city version of a beach shack.Yay Mingo for providing one of only a few places in the whole LV Valley that allow a family to dine out together-- even the four-legged members!",NIx3SnbPMuhh3KbKkuVFPA,3,1,5,tDY--t6VTMtobN4BO-2rjA

939862,2013-07-14,0,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"OMG...I found AMAZING Bar Food that is Vegetarian, Gluten Free & Non Dairy...be still my heart!!  My crazy dietary restrictions put me in a position of being limited to house made potato chips in most bars, but NOT at ""Mingo Kitchen & Lounge""!!  I found 3 dishes on the menu that I could eat & ordered 2 of them.  I got the BEST Brussel Sprouts on the planet there.  I know...""BRUSSEL SPROUTS""????  However, in the ""hands of the Master"" Executive Chef Robert Solano, even the humble Brussel Sprout is reimagined in one of the most flavorful combinations of proper cooking technique, amazing sauce & the perfect seasoning.  This is vege's the way they were meant to be cooked & even non veggie lovers will fall in love with.  The other dish I ordered was their version of Fried Rice, which was equally AMAZING!!  Don't expect your typical Chinese Restaurant version of fried rice.  This is a lighter version with different veges, but TO DIE FOR!!  The rice was perfectly cooked and the veges were the tiniest, tenderest (but not at all mushy) little baby squash I have ever seen/tasted.  YUM...I could eat both of these dishes for Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner!!  I didn't order their Edamame, not because it didn't sound good, but because I figured (right) that 2 dishes would fill me up & I can order Edamame in many places, but I WILL order it next time.  Hubby ordered a Burger on a Crossiant, (can't remember the name of it), but he said it was cooked & seasoned to perfection & he would DEFINITELY order it again.  For all you carnivores (like Hubby), there are PLENTY of yummy sounding options.  Hubby got a beer that looked like an amber ale (I didn't taste it) & I got their stoutest stout, even more so than Guiness which they also have, but I was looking for something that outdoes Guiness & they had it.  I wish I could remember the names of these beers.  

Decor was BEAUTIFUL!!  

George Harris was a gracious Host even after spending a LONG day on filming the next commercial for their Alien brand Tequila!!  All the staff were top notch & provided EXCELLANT service!!  Mingo is located in the Art Square Complex/Downtown Arts District  & parking is conveniently located just steps from the front door.  ""Mingo Kitchen & Lounge"" is the brainchild/creation of George Harris, Mingo Collaso & Executive Chef Robert Solano & is the third jewel in their ""Triple Crown"" that includes ""Mundo, a Latin Chic Restaurant"" & the aforementioned ""Alien Tequila"".

I have some suggestions, (I CANNOT critize such a well run organization).  They need:
1)  Better menus (the thing you read, not the food).  The print was sort of faint & in the ambiance of the dim lighting was not as easy to read as it should be.
2)  The menu on their website.
3)  Links to their menu online from Yelp & other sites.  
4)  A paper ""take home"" version of the menu.  
I FULLY expect that the above are ""in the works"" as we speak, since they have only been open a short while, but nonetheless, this is the ONLY thing missing.  

Lastly, the Parking Lot needs repaving, (they don't own the Parking Lot), & I'm not sure who does.  Just be advised if you drive a low to ground car (sports car), drive slowly onto the lot or you might bottom out on one of the uneven surfaces.

Considering our EXCELLENT experience at ""Mingo Kitchen & Lounge"" we had to give it 5 stars!!  RUN...don't walk to Mingo Kitchen & Lounge"" ASAP!!!!",Ri0C0N4nFPPZflejutx-jg,3,0,5,UPLpHWnLaHiBC1ibXfvySg

Might look sketchy to some people but I've never had trouble parking my car here. There is outdoor/indoor seating but I recommend indoor seating for the complete experience. When you walk in they have a wall on the right introducing their staff which is cool, with some local business cards and magazines. Its nice to see them embrace the downtown culture. It is dim lit with cool light fixtures,  gives an underground/speakeasy feel. There's no windows so that adds to the underground feel. The paintings they have on the walls are different, the whole aesthetic is a little off. Nothing is really cohesive. They have couches lined up against the walls and chairs on the other side of the table. They can seat people under 21 but not at the bar. I've never seen it packed besides first friday but it's better that way. feels more private and exclusive. The place is clean, outside is naturally a little more dusty. The menus are sometimes torn or old. Could probably update them soon.           

The music playing is always interesting, a mix of old stuff and newer stuff but remixed so it doesn't sound like the top 40 playing. It's loud enough to hear but you can have a conversation without shouting. It's a closed kitchen so you don't hear anything from the kitchen staff.

Leo is usually there and will give great menu recommendations. It's definitely not the type of bar where the staff will suck up to you. They have a list of rules (really common sense) on the wall for how someone should act. They're not overly bubbly with service but that's the vibe they're going for. The bar has phone chargers, a nice touch you don't see often. Dining at Mingo is really an experience and then the food pushes it through the top. Food comes out on time, at the right temperature and it's really really good.  Everything i've ever ordered is delicious.

The food quality is acceptable but once you throw the price factor into the equation it turns great specially during happy hour when it then becomes excellent.
I ordered the roasted garlic shrimp from their happy hour menu and I also ordered the fried rice, my plan was to create some sort of a paella by mixing them, it was so good that I can say they have the best, non paella, paella in town.

My pregnant wife and I decided to give them a try on a Thursday evening. We arrive around 6 and where promptly seated next to the bar at a tiny table with several people standing next to us. We asked for a booth but where told by our server that they were reserved- whatever. The waiter came over a few minutes later and took our order. Drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive but the appetizer came out at the same time. About 30 minutes went by and I asked our server where our food was- he looked confused and walked away. I already knew what happened; he gave our food to the table in front of us, who, by the way, didn't say anything when they got some free food. Our server came back and lied, tried to say that the computer broke down and they lost our order- he then offered to make it to go for us. I was beyond insulted- apparently the owner was there, and when I approached him he turned away and continued talking to his friend or regular who just came in. I wasted an hour there and rather than try to make up for it, the server handed my our check, attempting to bill me for the food the ""lost"" and offered nothing in the way of an apology. I grew up here, and I always tip- not this time and I will not be going to this place again.

The Kanye dog was the obvious choice for me. And I'm so glad I got it! Usually when I'm at a restaurant the first thing that comes to mind is definitely not a hot dog. The Kanye was crispy, juicy, snappy, salty, tangy, and sweet. 

I can't believe I'm saying it, but I thoroughly enjoyed a hot dog that I ordered from a sit-down restaurant.

I also ordered the fried rice to start with and it was great, but not memorable. 

A friend that I was with got the edamame to start off with and had the notorious P.I.G.  The edamame was spicy and salty and I wish we had more of it! The P.I.G. had an enormous amount of creamy mac n cheese that packed a lot of heat from the horseradish.

The food and drink was alright, but overpriced and I can surely cook better at home. The service was OK, & the decor a little pretentious. Speaking of that, there was this rather large bearded guy at the bar ranting and raving about ""those effing tree huggers"". Huh? I thought he was a customer having a bad day, but then I realized he is a manager or maybe even the owner. Really weird.

That said, the space in this old, old building handled the temps from outside quite well and I was very comfortable the whole time I was there (probably the best part of the experience)! Yes, the first triple-digit days of Vegas are upon us. The indoor-outdoor bar isn't all the rage like folks claim and it has been done many times before. Whoop-de-doo. Great bathrooms, btw!

We had the crispy chicken wings with sriracha sauce and garlic shrimp off the Happy Hour menu and both very were delicious. For my entree I opted for the Skirt Steak Salad... holy delicious. It was curry crusted skirt steak, baby spinach and arugula, blue cheese, tomatoes, candied pecans, horseradish cream in balsamic reduction. It was filling with quality ingredients and at a fair price point.

The hash was maybe 30% taters, mixed with yummy sauted veggies and a wee arugula salad. PERFECT. if you're looking for a standard ham, eggs & potatoes situation, I saw that on the menu, too. But my breakfast was so good it cursed me a little; I can't imagine ordering anything else. I got excellent service, too, from a sweet dark-haired boy.

Since I've been here, they've played Janet Jackson, TLC, Supersonic...really good mostly mellow 90s R&B mixed with up tempo stuff every 6th or so song, perfect for a chill Sunday morning.

First the decor here felt cheesy with black patent bejeweled tufted sofas. Perhaps my initial reaction was because I was expecting something that felt more authentic to the vibe of nearby bar bistro and artisan, but I digress.

Given my less than enthused reaction to the decor, I was open to give this place a chance. However a few highlights:
1. Our server did not know the menu. We asked him about multiple dishes and he just read the description back to us. 
2. We made two requests with our meal and the server forgot both changes. 
3. Even though the above requests weren't met, the food was good. I had the skirt steak salad and it was perfectly cooked. The brussels sprouts were tasty and my friend loved the tomato soup. 
4. I'm too old for club music at dinner. I just wanted a nice dinner with friends and we ended up talking over each other. 
5. It was really hot inside. I think they had opened the area between the bar and outside which made the restaurant really warm and uncomfortable. 
6. Finally, I can handle loud music and cheesy decor when the food is yummy, but the service ruined it for me. It took too long to place our order, receive our first round of drinks and close out the bill. Yes, the food is good, but the server was one of the most inexperienced waiters that I have encountered in a long time.

ONO-LICIOUS FISH & CHIPS: My favorite dish, four small pieces of nicely-battered fish with a spicy tartar sauce and a side of seasoned fries. BF didn't care for this and insisted the breading was too thick, but that just meant more for me!
CRISPY WINGS: Order of 6 wings is $4 for HH pricing, served with a buffalo sauce and a bleu cheese dip. Good crunch!
NOTORIOUS P-I-G: Gotta love the name! It's a thick bacon-wrapped dog topped with horseradish mac and cheese and pickled jalapenos. I'm not a horsey fan, but staff assured me the flavor was mild. I wouldn't get this again, but it wasn't bad.

I'm not a fan of the rocky, unpaved parking lot but I was pleasantly surprised by everything else I found here!

Our server, whos name I can't remember even though he did scream it at us several times during his opening spiel since we got sat right next to the DJ booth, was very slow in service even though he only had 3 booths and enough support to help him out.
By the time he showed up, we were ready to order our entire meal, which, the appetizer of chips with guacamole and salsa came out long before my wine or my boyfriend's beer showed up.

Which I wish it had showed up first as receiving a mid priced wine in a plastic rocks glass shoots red flags right away. The chips were warm and mild due to not having any salt. But by god, the guacamole tasted like it was squeezed out of a bag and drenched in lime juice. The salsa was no better and tasted like a straight up can of ro-tel. You've seen the commercials, and both were is desperate need of salt, to cut the lime, and pepper.

Speaking of pepper, everything here needed pepper. I mean, the cooks here should not be armatures and should know their spices, it's your kitchen for Pete's sake, own it and make those dishes. Don't fear using seasoning on the dishes, as some of those sauces and meats need to cook with them to enhance the final product.

Shortly after our entrees came out, I would have to say, our server put everything into the pos system at once and said, yolo! He dropped off the dishes and we asked for some salt and pepper. Only to see our server go flirt with his other tables and absentmindedly forget our only request. So we asked some passing by server or manager, not sure which she was, and got our requested item, right away.

Perhaps if I was wearing a low cut shirt with my clevage exposed we would have received faster service, or maybe if my boyfriend had one on too, the service would have been more attentive. Who knows but it was working for the other tables next to us.

My boyfriend got the chili rancheros filet mignon and I got the chicken sandwich. And we split a Mexican street corn and Mexican risotto. Both the sides, once again, were in desperate need of pepper.
I make bomb risotto, this side sitting in front of me was so covered in so much cheese that it took away from the natural fluffiness of a risotto dish and made a heavy and awkwardly chewy risotto, very reminiscent of a day old risotto that you cooked the night before and then reheat incorrectly in the microwave the next evening.
The Mexican street corn had the incorrect type of mayo in it, and the correct mayo for real Mexican street corn should have a hint of lime to it.

Now, I enjoyed my salad and sandwich, but you can't really screw that up. On the other hand, the chipotle sauce my boyfriend's dish tasted like it was poured from one of those cheap cans of chipotle peppers and sauce that you find in the international food aisle, and had nothing done to it. Due to this, the sauce was so over powering that it ruined the dish.

We were so over the dishes and the server came to take the chip plate and then left, never asked if we wanted to check or not. I litearlly had to wave him down since he was so much more engrossed in his other guest. I pushed my card into his hand and said I wanted the check. He asked if we wanted anything to go, all I could do was say no. Which should have given him a clue to the fact that we were not happy.

After another ten minutes I got my check back, paid and we left. I think my boyfriend actually warned some people waiting outside to run. We will never be back.",lOiJBKYO4sVF9eAIj4233A,1,0,1,0gLPC2YAmIsONGexkgw1zw

Rj just ordered a bunch of food for us to grub on... I did read some reviews before we hit this place up... Brussel Sprouts was one of the items mentioned as a MUST TRY.

This is what we devoured: 

EDAMAME: garlic, red chile, lime, ponzu, sesame sea salt - I really liked these. They were jazzed up with the spice and ponzu and I love lime! 

GRILLED MAHI MAHI TACOS: red chile rub, spicy taco sauce, shaved cabbage, mango relish, avocado, lime

VEGETABLE FRIED RICE: squash, carrots, ponzu sauce, organic egg - This was good. I think they used Sesame Oil... A little too much, the sesame really stuck out but nonetheless this was a tasty dish! 

GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO SOUP: gruyere, fontina, jack, brioche, heirloom tomato, basil - My second favorite item we had!! The soup isn't thin, more like a bisque and SO delicious!!!! I could have drank it all night! The grilled cheese and really good too with the different cheeses and tomato kicked it off for me! 

SEARED BRUSSEL SPROUTS: brown butter, candied pecans, golden raisins, balsamic reduction - Have I ever even eaten brussel sprouts before?!! I dont think so! So eating them here, the way they are prepared was like BRUSSEL SPROUT HEAVEN!!!!! These were SOOOO on point OMG!!!!!!! I could have eaten bowls and bowls of them! GEE GOLLLLLY!!!! EVERYTHING about them was freakin' DELICIOUS!! They were perfectly cooked and soft and flavorful! NOM NOM FREAKIN' NOM!!!  

FREE CHANGE CHICKEN: mediterranean chimichurri, caramelized cipollini onions, roasted potatoes - This was good too. Tasted kind of BBQ-y - I liked the potatoes too! 

LAND & SEA: curry crusted skirt steak, garlic shrimp, arugula, roasted potatoes - Not too bad, I wasn't a fan of the arugula salad on the side though. 

All the food was QUITE tasty... The service was MEH though. Considering Rj ordered all the food for us and it just came out, we didn't have MUCH interaction with the service staff HOWEVER there was A bartender working and he pretty much SUCKED and was QUITE unappreciative of the generous tips SOMEBODY was hooking him up with. Plus he was slow considering we were the ONLY group in there by the end of the night and even before it reached the end of the night there were a few other groups hanging out but nothing CRAZY. 
Mingo is a SMALL cozy place, nicely decorated and it has chargers all along the bar which is REALLY nice... but seriously. Mr. Bartender: YOU SUCKED.

P.S. 2/2/14: Just heard that lovely bartender is no longer with Mingo so all is well in the world! ;))",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,10,8,4,3aC1XZaXDduo26DT-gmcdg

High backed black leather seating and mostly black finishing give the place a club feel which is reinforced by the music they were spinning during our visit. 

We met Mingo and one of the other proprietors, traced the mixology pedigrees of the bartenders and charged my iphone from the clever outlets under the bar. 

Food won't be served until Monday as the kitchen is still ramping up, so we ordered a Sculpin IPA and one of the signature cocktails. The beer selection is deep with lots of regional favorites and some of the high end standards such as Delirium Tremens. The draft beers had just arrived and were still chilling down. Mingo let me view the bottled list from his Macbook as it wasn't ready yet for print. Although the cocktail was a bit steep for the neighborhood, my Sculpin was probably at the price point I would expect. 

The place has a great vibe and will be one more reason to visit the charming art square area at Charleston and Main. The ""Beyond Thunderdome"" parking lot is not really under Mingo's control but somebody needs to improve the lighting, paint some lines and fix the pavement before another oil pan gets shredded.  It's  nice to see outdoor seating which is so useful and so rare in this valley.

Nestled right in the heart of the art's district in DTLV, across Artifice, it's the perfect spot to grab dinner and drinks before a night of downtown debauchery.  

We came with a large party of 10 people for a birthday dinner.  It was surprising because THE PLACE WAS DEAD.  Although, I can't see why--the food, drinks, service, and ambiance/decor are up to par with some of the trendy eateries downtown.  I'm guessing it was because everyone must have been doing Christmas shopping or attending holiday parties, as it was the weekend right before Christmas.

I love their cocktail menu.  My favorite was the Gossip cocktail (I think that's what it was called)--it has fresh muddled grapes and elderflower liquor in it.  It's delicious!  I ordered a second round.  

For food, I ordered the Rib-eye (medium-rare).  I thought it may have been a little too salty, but everyone enjoyed it.  The Notorious P.I.G. was interesting--a hot dog with jalapeños, horseradish mac and cheese, and bacon.  Really tasty.  Other great hits were the edamame (so addicting) and roasted garlic shrimp (dip your bread ALL UP IN that lemon-garlicy goodness ;)). 

Prices aren't bad.  I think the cocktails might have been around $10, the rib-eye I think was $22, the hotdog was I believe around $10--sorry, lots of this is by memory lol but yeah--the prices aren't crazy.

Came here with the lady after a long day of running errands and needed some nourishment and an adult beverage, Mingo to the rescue! This eatery is located in the Arts District, in a huddle mass of amazing art venues and great boutique shopping options. 

Mingo offers an amalgam of upscale bar food, weiner jokes, and tasty cocktails. We pretty much had the entire place to ourselves and bellied up to the bar. Roman, our bartender greeted us and started us off with couple beers and three-dollar mystery shots. These mystery shots were very good, I'm guessing; Vodka, lemonade, and something else?  Mingo has a decent beer options, but you're better off ordering cocktails in this joint. They have a huge selection and are also willing to create stuff on the fly. 

Happy hour was going strong so we ordered accordingly. We got the Notorious P.I.G., Three Cheese Baked Mac N' Cheese, and Brussel Sprouts with Bacon. 

The Notorious P.I.G. is a basically a hot dog covered in awesome. That awesome being, pickled jalapeños, horseradish mac & cheese, and crispy bacon. I did attempt to pick this beast up and eat it the classic hot dog way, but this mammoth meal needed a fork and knife. There's some great texture going on here, the crispy bacon mixed with the creamy mac n' cheese was stellar! This dish wasn't too spicy even with the jalapenos and horseradish; it just had a baby kick. More flavor than anything.

The seared brussel sprouts were a great side dish for the meal. Even though it says, ""seared"" on the menu these green veggies weren't overcooked. Mingo lightly seared these in a balsamic reduction, and added candied pecans, golden raisins along with bacon upon request. Crispy, fresh, and even with the addition of bacon these lighten up the meal nicely. 

I would definitely recommend this place for a daytime adult beverage stop. I hear that soon they will be hosting movie night on Wednesdays!

3245957,2016-09-18,1,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"I went here for brunch yesterday because my friend was DJing a brunch gig there from 11 - 3 pm and there was bottomless mimosas for $20.00 so naturally I was interested. I didn't expect much food-wise but I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered their chicken street tacos and they were really good! I wish there was a hotter salsa option, maybe there was but I didn't ask.

Their mimosas are HUGE and they have a great selection of flavors. With bottomless mimosas regular OJ can get kind of boring. They had passion fruit, guava (my favorite), prickly pear, pineapple, mango, and regular OJ. We were sitting right at the bar so the mimosas never did reach their bottom and the bartenders were very nice. The bar also had phone chargers and purse hooks as well as coloring pages so I was basically in heaven. I'm not sure if the coloring pages were normal or if the event company who was hosting brought them but either way it was a lot of fun.

The ONLY reason that this place didn't get 5 stars is the owner was extremely rude. There were maybe four guests the entire brunch that weren't there for the music and there was a group of 30 or so people there JUST because of the DJ who all ordered food and bottomless. 

In the middle of my friends set the owner made him cut the music to yell at him in front of everyone because the music was too loud. I was sitting at the bar and was able to have a conversation easily with my friend, I didn't need to shout or anything. I usually wear ear plugs to events but it wasn't even necessary. He was shouting about how his guests come first and the music was too loud. FIRST OFF, were we not guests? The group of people there for the music all eating and drinking there? SECONDLY, Mingo let Found Events throw a brunch party! The flyer had the DJ lineup on it. parties tend to be a little louder than normal restaurant background music because thats why pretty much everyone was there.

So aside from that little hiccup, the food and service was excellent, and I would definitely say it's worth checking out. They have a DJ most Saturdays so if you don't want to be around live music I would advise coming on a different day.",S5Eld1fZx6D8d9i5YbFOaA,5,2,4,b9Y1CPh_1d6iwxD6Tir2xQ

I came here during First Friday, so with their central location in the Arts District I was expecting a great artsy vibe to the bar.  It had good music and the ambience was right, but the wait staff took forever to serve us, and their cocktail selection was awful.  

First off, a few of the cocktails were $10 (which is fair for Las Vegas), but they are low quality and only offer about 3, low alcohol options.  Then to top the low selection, they serve it in a plastic cup.  If I order a cocktail, I expect it to be in a nice glass, prepared for me, not in PBR beer pong cup.

Next, they charge me $12 for the drink, though it explicitly said $10 on the menu.  I tell the waiter and he reluctantly changes the price to $10.  But now, I get taxed on the cocktail when at first I didn't.  How does that work?  This place seems like they're trying to scam people with their prices.  I know it was First Friday and all and people were maybe a little blitzed, but some customer service and selection is to be expected for a nice bar.

Some dishes are better than others. I like their Mexican risotto. It's very creamy and cheesy and the addition of corns gives it a nice texture. Their chicken enchiladas is alright. Their brisket tamales are too sweet for my taste, so I'd say pass on this one. My friend swears by their shrimp tamales, so I'd give that a try next time.

Hands down best Brussels sprouts I've had in forever! It's a must try there! The burgers were perfect, came with some sauce and we mostly used it for the fries which were amazing as well. I'm a huge mac and cheese fan but wasn't overly impressed by theirs but it was still pretty good. 

They didn't get their fish order in time so we couldn't try any seafood dishes which I hear are good..maybe next time. The happy hour menu was great and we definitely enjoyed the experience!  Our server was great too, we left full, happy and still had money left over for a show!

 I was feeling a little skeptical, but we walked in and the whole vibe was completely different.  It looked like your friend from the 70's fixed up a dream basement to drink, play music and smoke weed.  Of course, what your friend wouldn't have had was all those tasty munchies just an order away.

Seriously- bacon wrapped hot dogs, queso flameado, brisket tamales, and deep fried oreos? What's not to love?

3525187,2014-07-24,2,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"One word: weird. Okay, to be specific: weird if you are primarily interested in a meal. Mingo is a swanky cocktail lounge that features a full menu of original and classic dishes concocted from many cuisine inspirations including Japanese, American, Mediterranean, and South American. 

The food is beautiful. Beautifully plated, beautifully seasoned, and treated with care and respect. I truly appreciate that the chefs do not fear bold flavors. My dining experience was a welcome change from the French-culinary inspired dishes I have tasted lately. 

Mingo takes many risks with their food, such as a deep-fried, free-range chicken breast and thigh served with a mango chutney and a chimmichuri sauce. A strange combination [The chimmichuri is served on the side. (You don't have to eat it.)]. The biggest risk, though, is the space.  The layout, the tables, and the seating are not conducive to dining.  This is designed to be a lounge. The tables and seating are fine for small groups who want to have a few cocktails, but they are not suited for those who come in for dinner.  The tables are too low for the booths, and the chairs are to low for the tables.  I spent a good portion of my meal hunched over in order to eat.  This is a shame because the food is excellent.  

I think this would be a great place to visit if you are a single professional working downtown who is going to sit alone at the bar and down a martini and grab a steak at the end of the day.  It is a good place if you are a small group meeting for drinks and a little nosh.  However, if you are planning dinner for two, you and your partner ought to be foodies, otherwise one of you will never want to eat here again.

The restaurant is in the Las Vegas Arts District downtown. It's a definite must if you are visiting downtown Las Vegas, or are visiting during First Friday. 

The food is self-conscious comfort food, with slight irony. Try the tomato soup and grilled cheese which has gourmet cheese and artisanal bread. I like the steak salad with horseradish sauce! So tender and juicy is the steak and the salad part is good too! I have never heard of anyone not liking the food here. 

Yes, it is a hipster vibe, but not obnoxious like so many others. It really is like a high-class diner. Or like a hipster ""Cheers"". You feel like you are in a place that, if you came often enough, ""everybody will know your name.""

On first Friday:
My friend and I order martinis. When we got our drinks, they came in plastic cups. I told the server I did not want a plastic cup and she said she couldn't give us glasses because it was first Friday. I told her she did not inform us of this beforehand and a martini is simply not a drink served in a plastic cup. I'm not a complete snob - but come on. This is super amateur hour if you think this is ok. She says, ""Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger."" I looked at her so confused, having been a server myself, I would never say such an idiotic thing to a customer. I told her that we were having dinner and not going anywhere (we were sitting in a booth) so could we not just have our drinks poured into a glass (didn't even ask for them to be remade) but she said she could do nothing about it, we would not get a glass in that restaurant, no way no how. 
My friend did not want her martini in a plastic cup either, so she said to just get something else that makes sense in a plastic cup. I told the server that I would like to get something else and I did not want the martini anymore (since it was in a plastic cup.) She said ""I'm going to charge you for it whether you take it or not."" I don't think I've ever had that poor of customer service anywhere in Vegas. This is the town that's supposed to be known for customer service, correct? My friend said, ""wow, you should speak to a manager"" but by that point it was clear I was in a place of riff raff and would probably not get anywhere. I didn't order another drink, but told the server, politely, that she should have told us beforehand that all drinks come in a plastic cup and we would have avoided the whole situation altogether. If it were me, and I had failed to tell a customer that her drink came in a plastic cup and neither of my customers wanted their drinks anymore, I would have done everything in my power to return them, get them comp'd, anything; I would have gone as far as to buy them myself since it would have been my fault and I represent the restaurant I'm working in.

THE DECOR (4 out of 5)
Mingo has seating both inside and out including an outdoor bar as well. On the inside it seemed pretty dark and dimly lit, kind of like a club. However, we opted to sit at one of the tables outside. Sure it was with plastic chairs and all but I didn't mind. It was a nice evening, and we had a decent view of what was going on near the Arts Factory.

THE FOOD (4 out of 5)
I was really impressed with their food offering. We had ordered some edamame ($5) which had garlic, red chiles, lime, ponzu and sesame sea salt that I thought was good. Next was the grilled blue point oysters ($14 for 4 oysters) with garlic greens, ginger jalapeño aioli, bacon bits and red chile sauce that was delicious. And lastly since I was still hungry, I tried the Kanye hot dog ($7) which was a Chicago style bacon wrapped hot dog with pickle relish, onions and peppers which I'll definitely order again. 

THE SERVICE (3 out of 5)
Our server was nice and helpful with our menu selections but it did seem to take a while to get our order (especially with some of the beer orders). While it did get busier as the night went on, that's no excuse for having to wait sooooo long just to get a drink, right?

Mingo is fun and edgy!  It's like being somewhere that you're not supposed to be...  You know that feeling?  Like maybe you're doing something wrong, but it's thrilling and a bit dangerous...  Well, my friends, read on!

I first heard about this place from my Yelp friend, Brian M., in Honolulu. He said it was on his list of ""to go"" places. I volunteered to check it out for him and got my 2 friends to go with me for an exciting adventure...and boy, did we have an adventure!  I had also mentioned this place to my Yelp friend, Joyce, in Arizona - she was looking forward to reading my review because she is interested in eating here, too, so here goes...

DANGEROUS
Mingo is located in the Arts District of Las Vegas.  My friends were a bit anxious as they kept looking around for sketchy people.  I'm kind of used to this population because of my work, so I had no fear!  I found a FREE parking space with a bit of tree shade, right in the front of the entrance!  Yay!

HANDSOME
The decor, music, and ambiance were so different and exciting!  I was amazed at the black theme: Chairs, sofas, floors, walls, ceiling, etc.  The only thing that wasn't black were the silver curtains that were a softening contrast; and the white tables that were a bold contrast to the sleek arrangement.  

YUMMY
We went for the Sunday Brunch (11am - 3pm).  My friends ordered the Yo Way Waffles with fresh berries; and the All Up In My Grill Chicken Sandwich.  They both were oohing and awwing over their meals for the duration of our stay.  I guess they were happy!?

I had the Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Soup - delicious!  This is NOT your ordinary grilled cheese sandwich...  The bread was thick and crunchy on the outside from the decadent butter.  Inside with the melty, soft cheese lay the fresh basil and neatly diced tomatoes - mmm!  The tomato soup was on the sweet side and had some gooey cheese nicely mixed in!  Oh yeah!

Our server, Eddie, was the BEST!  (See photo - he's the guy in the doorway with the red shirt.)  He was so energetic, friendly, and helpful!  He sure was efficient and quick!  He even invited us to FREE karaoke on Monday night, but sadly we were unable to attend.  We definitely will return!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,15,15,5,mfjnbWzJaP7CTzTkviECdA

3971626,2014-07-19,7,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"Mingo has been on my list since it opened.  With its close proximity to the Art Square Theatre, I had always planned to go there before a play.  That's what I did last night.

I got there a little after 6 PM and I found out that Happy Hour was until 7 PM.  I ordered the Notorious P.I.G. which is a hot dog with bacon, pickled jalapeño rounds, and horseradish macaroni and cheese all on a hot dog bun.  It was quite good.  The hot dog was grilled and the bacon and jalapeño slices added to the flavor.  I didn't taste much horseradish in the mac and cheese.  I was hoping for a kick, but it just wasn't there.  Along with Notorious P.I.G., I ordered a side of fries.  These were great!  Nicely seasoned with just the right amount of salt.  Very flavorful.

Of course, I couldn't leave without dessert so I ordered their chocolate crunch which is about a 2 inch by 1 1/2 inch round of chocolate mousse that has been covered with melted chocolate and then hardened.  You crack through the chocolate exterior--the crunch--to get to the mousse inside.  It was very good.  There was some mango syrup on the plate and a few slices of fresh strawberry.  A great ending to the meal.

Service was good.  My server, Eddie, was around to refill my iced tea several times and was very helpful.  The place is relatively small.  When I come back, I'll opt for a high top table.  Where I sat was very comfortable until you eat.  You sit low and have to lean forward and up to reach the table.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,9,4,Ly_UZ7EV1gCDInBTJbZEnA
4057788,2013-06-21,0,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"Let me just warn you all that the directions on iPhone send you to the wrong spot.  Don't rely on google maps, but head toward Artifice, because Mingo is slightly hidden and tucked away next to it.  Very inviting place once I found it.  We headed here before the Yelp block party on Fremont street, since the instructions said don't come hungry, and I was definitely hungry.

The bar opens up in the front of Mingo's so you have this open air effect, a la Park on Fremont.  Very cool.  I do think Mingo might be suffering a little bit of an identity crisis because the front is this really casual bar and inside it is full on club.  I kind of liked the contrast though.  Great happy hour menu with cheap drinks and eats.  Although big bites were offered, we stuck to the happy hour menu.  We had:

french fries with siracha ketchup - amaze balls.  Really good.
The Kanye -  Yes, please.   A chicago style hot dog with incredibly spicy peppers.  Although the weiner was a little greasy (hehe), I loved the flavors.
Sliders - Average sliders, but well-cooked

Overall, the food was much better than I expected.  Don't compare this place to Mundo's (Mingo's other establishment) because it is not trying to compete with Mundo.  This is an awesome addition to the arts district and it provides an alternative to Bar+Bistro if you are looking for some good grub.  I've had some not so great experiences at Bar+Bistro, and won't be going back, but service at Mingo was awesome and I would definitely hit this place up again.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,3,1,5,YQikvHB84p9jklZS0ggzEg
4066648,2017-04-23,5,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"This place has TERRIBLE customer service. The bartender the morning of 4/22 definitely should not be in customer service, perioid. 

My friends and I came here to support a friend that was booked to DJ, and many of the people there were there for the same reason for the other DJs. Not one person out of about 20 people had one nice thing to say about this bartender. He started out by yelling ""IDs!"" at us. One of my friends hadn't heard him and was looking at a piece of art in there and he had rudely yelled at her even louder ""I NEED TO SEE YOUR ID."" She showed it to him, then he tossed her ID on the counter and said ""what do you want"". When my friends told him they we're all there for bottomless mimosas he rolled his eyes. When they finally received their half filled drinks, we went back outside to brush the guy off.

Upon one of my friends refills, I was at the bar right in front of guests that we're sitting down for full service. Instead of walking around to serve them he was yelling over the bar at them. The also asked for the bottomless mimosas. Again, the guy rolled his eyes and asked what they wanted. They asked what the choices were. He snarckily replied well it's on the menu and then listed the choice. I looked over, and they didn't recieve a menu. The bartender finished their drinks and set them on the bar, instead of walking over to the guests AGAIN. And as I watched this guy interact with all the guests he never smiled, gave everyone some sort of attitude. Again, my friends and I just stayed outside so we wouldn't have to deal with it.
Finally a second female bartender came, and she was much more attentive but her service was still not very great. I had ordered chips and salsa and I had asked her to put them on my friends tab, and had no problem with it. Later, she said ""are you going to pay for your food or what?"" And when I told her to put them on my friends tab she said ""well I don't know who that is."" And then when my friend came to pay for the tab not even 5 minuets later there wasn't any problem with going and actually checking for the tab.
What had caused us all to leave is the reason that none of us will be returning to this place. I had used the bathroom frequently, honestly it was hot outside and I wasn't feeling great. Every time I was in the bathroom, the lock wouldnt hold and somebody would walk in on me. Every single time. Apparently people had mentioned to the bartenders I has been excessively using the bathroom. When I came out the last time the awful male bartender started SCREAMING and cursing at me, making a scene. He was saying people had told him I was doing drugs in the bathroom and he was the ""manager"" and would ""86 my ass."" When I tried to explain to him I just hasn't been feeling well and I didn't do drugs, I had offered him to check my bag and search my friends if he really had a concern. And he continued to scream at me and said ""DON'T GET CRAZY WITH ME BITCH!"" I walked away because there was no reasoning with him, so I tried to explain to my friends what was going on and he followed me and continued to make  a scene outside. This guy was absolutely irrotic, and was literally just looking for drama.",1lqTR6ZPp8sqcCA1Xd9TIA,2,0,1,cdd1jaa-7OSI__O2O32GYA

This was a small place but luckily not too many people were there so even though we were a little late to our reservation, getting a table was not a problem.  We looked at the cocktail menu and laughed about all the descriptions given for their signature cocktails like, The boner, Pink Lips, and Gold Digger.  We ordered Saints & Ginners and Alien Mule.  Pretty stiff drinks, I guess that's why their wifi password is ""theboner"".  We started off with the edamame appetizer which smelled awesome, I've never had lime served with edamame but it was added a nice citrus flavor with the garlic, chile, and ponzu.  We killed that one quick, I could just eat wood chips soaked in that ponzu chile sauce.  We also had the fried rice, skirt steak salad and roasted garlic shrimp.  Everything was great! Will definitely come back to try other menu items, or just for drinks, edamame and to read their hashtags.  Hope they bring other things and hashtags to the menu!  *playlist that night was great, lots of 90s jams mixed with some Justin Timberlake...

4147530,2016-09-28,1,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"Simply looking at the reviews and menu online for Mingo does not nearly do this place justice. I came here with my co-workers for a mid-day escape.  We were a little nervous after seeing the humorous hashtags and witty food names.  But the reviews were strong and the pictures made the food look so good.  So we took a chance and we are glad we did.

My boss and I were psyched as soon as we walked up.  There was some killer 90s music playing over the PA.  It started with Ice Ice Baby and only got better from there.  We were rocking out.  We were told to sit any where and chose one of the boothes with the leather bench.  Do yourself a favor and opt for the teal chairs.  They are more comfortable.

We were given menues and asked if we had been to Mingo ro Mundo previously.  Neither of us had been.  So our server went over the menu a bit and told us about the unwritten daily special.  Steak salad on this day. We spent the next several minutes deciding what each of the four of us wanted.  I chose chicken street tacos with a side of Mexican street corn.  It was all very good.  The three tacos looked to be on the small side but they were packed with chicken to the point it was hard to even pick them up to eat.  Three tacos were plenty.  They came with a few chips and little cup of salsa.  The salsa was awesome and I can't explain why.  But what really struck me was the corn.  It was not on the cob as I had expected but rather in a bowl.  I could see that it had been grilled and mixed with the crema, cheese and other various goodness.  This was a fantastic bowl of corn.  I could probably make a meal of just that.  I would happily order it again.  And again.  And again.

Mingo is a hip happening little spot in the arts district.  They are a little different but who doesn't love a little bit of different in their lives.  You should get to Mingo and feel the vibes and try the food.  Its a fun little get away.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,4,2,4,K_nJwflW3JxbCNjNChYNbw

Our friend arrived and we had another cocktail and ordered chicken tacos which were REALLY good. Mingo used to be Mundo over in the World Trade Center down the way, my husband had went there once when we first moved to LV, but it relocated and turned into Mingo.

Parking in the Arts District is what it is.  You either score a decent spot on the street, you get what is probably a protected spot in a semi-organized row in the lot on 1st, or it's getting busy and you're wedged in to the un-striped parking free for all.

We got seated as soon as we got to the door, but the seating arrangements were odd.  Five of us there, so two of us got the bench side of the table, which sunk down to couch-depth and put the table mid-chest.  Two got the normal chairs on the other side of the table, and the fifth was basically on a footstool at an end table tucked up against the big table.  So he was basically at the kid's table with us.  All in good fun though.

The service was friendly and prompt, with some recommendations and excitement over the menu.  The food, though, was what really rocked.  Between the bunch of us, there were sliders, wings, hummus, salads, soups, shrimp, and fish.  Everyone's was amazing-- heavy on the butter and seasonings where you want, and delicate where it should be.  Portions were correct- no one left hungry but we were all able to walk under our own power.

Overall, 4 solid stars.",YbiBC-LYzb4b6kSHBpjwPQ,0,0,4,MCFBY34wqogOO9WaXchcTQ

Everything was quite tasty but the things that stuck out most to me were the chicken, and the brussel sprouts. Rarely would I order chicken at a restaurant but since a friend was ordering for us, I was fortunate enough to get to try out Mingo's, otherwise I probably would've never known how delicious it is.  

The karaoke was a lot of fun, minus a few very obnoxious mic hogs, which at times was distracting and disrespectful to some of the other people singing.  There were some super talented people in there!

I'd definitely recommend this place because the food is really good and it's such a cute little loungy place.  One of the owners was there the night we went in, and he was super nice.  He even sang a couple oldies and he sang them well!  The only thing keeping my review from 5 stars was the bartender's service.

The other side of the menu is American fare.   Crazy-good hot dogs, burgers and several other good options.  Foodwise, there is something for everyone here.  And the drinks....!

Rather than updating, unless the service and food standards drop, I'm just going to add on.

10/29/13
Last night was my first time going to Mingo Kitchen & Lounge.  

We got there about 6:30, as karaoke night starts at 7ish on Mondays, and we wanted to go sing for a while.

First of all, the decor is SO cool.  All black and white, with mirrors, and they were all decorated up for Halloween, too, so there was a great atmosphere for the few days before Halloween.

Their happy hour lasts till 7pm (I think its from 3pm-7, but I don't remember), and they have discounted prices on beer and some of their food.

To start, for happy hour, my friend and I ordered: a PBR (for him, not me. ew. lol)  and a Blue Moon (for me).  The Roasted Garlic Shrimp, and the Notorious P.I.G.

So the Roasted Garlic Shrimp was wonderful.  I want to say it was about 8 medium sized shrimp, in a delightfuly tart lemony garlic sauce, served with garlic toast.  It was awesome, and I loved sopping up the sauce with the bread.

The Notorious P.I.G.  This was too good to be believed.
I read the reviews of how good the Kanye dog was, but the Notorious P.I.G was the one that called out to be ordered.
Its a hotdog with crispy bacon, pickled jalapenos, and HORSERADISH MAC N CHEESE!
You wouldn't think that mac n cheese would work on a hotdog, but IT DOES.  

I'd drive all the way downtown JUST for this again. And again. And again.

So after eating this, I decided that I wanted to try the fish and chips.  
I'm a fish and chips fanatic, and I always like to try them out at new places.

I really enjoyed these.  The chips were well spiced, and the fish was flavorful.  My only complaint is that the batter was just a tiny bit soggy, but that didn't stop me from enjoying every last bite.

We also ordered the skirt steak salad.  This one took a while to get to us...the server forgot to put the order in, but honestly...we were having fun singing, so it really wasn't a big deal.  When it arrived, it was worth the wait. 
The steak was a perfect medium rare, with a fantastic heavy sear on the outside.  The salad was delicately dressed, and everything worked together to create a delicious meal.

The serving sizes are not huge.    The prices are fair.

There is also a Yelp deal available when you check in, for 10% off your entree.  

All in all, it was a great night.

Karaoke was fun, the bartender was super nice, and the food was fantastic.  I may have found my new favorite Monday night spot.

11/5/13
Went to Mingo again last night for karaoke.
It was busier last night than it was last week, which bummed me out...I wanted to post up at the bar to charge my phone.  They have phone chargers all along the bar!

Sat at a comfy table and ordered from the happy hour menu:

Spicy Fried chicken wings served with bleu cheese and sriracha.
I'm not a wing fan.  they're ok, but I don't usually make it a habit to eat wings.
I'd order these again.  They were delicious!  The sriracha mixed in the bleu cheese is good too. ;)

""Free Change Chicken.""
I'm honestly not sure if this is a typo or not, but whatever its called, its delicious.
Chicken breast AND wing with a kind of a mango salsa (that's what I thought it  was anyway) served with a salad, potatoes and a mediterranian chimichurri. Oh. My. GOD it was awesome.  I devoured it.  Flavorful and moist chicken.  

The skirt steak on the salad this time was a little overdone, but not inedible.

Service was great.  Jason remembered us from the week before, as did George, who I think is the owner or manager. They both went out of their way to greet us. 

Another good night at Mingo!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,2,4,kMfYxO85GlNVUDriRr-2aA
5279421,2017-12-18,3,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"While the ability to travel and dine at several of the World's greatest Restaurants is undoubtedly a privilege to be grateful for it also comes at a cost, the financial aspect obvious to most but the risk of becoming 'jaded' also something to be taken into consideration; an elevated sense of what is possible often setting a bar too high for more casual circumstances, though in the case of Mingo Kitchen + Lounge it seems as if the average local Diner or even Denny's may have higher standards for what they serve.

Currently located at 1017 South 1st Street in the Arts Distict, the former Mundo inside World Market Center shuttering in December 2015 and becoming Mingo shortly thereafter, it was on an baffling recommendation of ""the food was pretty good when I was there"" from one member of the team that the office Christmas Party was booked for Dinner on Friday, a 7:00pm arrival finding vagrants in the parking lot and a bar nearby jumping, the ""closed for Private Event"" sign on Mingo's door apparently not enough to dissuade rough n' tumble looking regulars who more than once attempted to enter.

Originally toqued by Chef Robert Solano, much of his Latin-inspired menu ported over from World Market as ""Mundo Classics"" to join a list of ""Mingo Faves"" and ""Sharables"" with clever names, everything from Mac n' Cheese Hotdogs and #IMABIGDILL Frickles joining items as pricey as the $28 Boneless Ribeye, it was with a prix fixe offered by way of check-boxes that guests were greeted at their seats, the ""decadent & sexy lounge"" likely only fitting such a description for those fresh from the Strip Club as tacky glass raindrops blended with mixed lighting, worn leather banquets and the overwhelming smell of Clorox.  

One-upping the description of their décor with ""an inventive & risqué menu,"" the inane hashtag descriptions apparently intended to be provocative, it was with drink tickets distributed that guests were left to decide between Beer, cheap Wine or ""Well Cocktails"" described as ""a shot with some mix,"" the decision to try Sangria finding Fruit and Wine largely inoffensive, as too was Iced Tea that was refilled appropriately.

Originally told that Appetizers were a choice by servers, this fact unapparent on the paper menu and actually untrue as the kitchen sent out individual Salads plus a sparse plate of Calamari to be shared at each table, suffice it to say that dinner got off to an inauspicious start when the jumble of Fruits and Vegetables arrived sloppy wet and best eaten with a spoon while the rings of Cephalopod were largely overcooked and only rescued by bottled Sauces in plastic cups that were the furthest thing from risqué, sexy or inventive.

Next offering one of four entrees, the person who recommended the place actually returning hers to the kitchen because it was too spicy, suffice it to say that anyone seeking 'sexy' vibes or good Mexican food would be well advised to stay at Sapphires and dine at El Dorado or give up the glitz and drive over to Charleston Road for better as the Chicken was nicely roasted but far too sweet while the Filet Mignon Chile Relleno was fair to middling at best, though the Corn Tamale clearly made from a mix instead of actual Masa was a nostalgic throwback to Chi-Chi's Corn Pudding from a Midwestern childhood.

Exchanging White Elephant gifts and playing Trivia throughout the course of two hours, the people present helping to alleviate much of the regret for ever stepping through Mingo's doors, it was with samples of all three Desserts that dinner lurched across the finish-line, the Churros easily the most edible option though everyone agreed they were too hard while the Pecan Bars as well as the ""Cheesecake Bites"" were confirmed via the internet to be straight out of Costco (see photos.)",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,3,1,zFrCrmx8TnqlWg71fslK_A

Blackened Mahi Mahi BLT:
#fishdiving I got this sans tomato. Sourdough bread, avocado, sweet herb garlic mayo, fries. I misread the menu as ""garlic mayo fries"" and my taste buds were already set for garlic mayo fries...my bad! This open-faced sandwich was good though. The bread was grilled, crisp and not soggy. 4/5

Rib Rye:
#rarenjuicy caramelized onions, roasted potatoes and soy balsamic glaze. This was cooked warmer than a medium rare we asked for but tasty and tender. 3/5

Deep-Fried Oreo Cookies:

The spicey Hummus is served with grilled pita bread and sliced cucumber,  carrots, celery and radish.  Wine prices are reasonable.  Every Friday night they have wonderful live music (not too loud).  The service was attentive and very friendly.  We'll be back soon and often.",Igju-tNzMmIn4LRldU5WrA,0,0,4,NRow5sr9n6PJh7y6-gwHJA

The directions made it tricky to figure out where we were supposed to go, but thankfully their sign out front helped. This place, which is now Mundo at Mingo, (to my understanding) is a combination of two restaurants in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas' Arts District. The area is absolutely the definition of hip and trendy, and the decor, both inside and out, makes me think that the place could easily flip a switch and turn into a nightclub (I'm pretty sure this is actually what happens). I've only been here for lunches, so I have yet to see what the evening environment is like. 

Every lunch I've had here has been terrific and memorable. I've brought multiple guests and visitors here when they're in town for a few days, as it really does have something for everyone. One great thing about lunch, hardly ever a crowd, so there's next to no wait time. My personal favorites were anything to do with Brisket: the Brisket Taquitos for appetizers and the Brisket Enchiladas. They do their brisket really well - tender, juicy, bursting with flavor, well seasoned, I couldn't rave about them enough. The portions are also smaller, which was fine for me (I'm a firm believer that too many places offer ridiculous portion sizes). The chips and salsa they offer - those chips, I don't know how they do it, they are like the puff pastry of chips, layered, thick and crispy without being too hard/firm, balanced perfectly with their salsa. The next best chips and salsa I've had was in Honduras, so kudos to them for getting it so right.

Overall, this is a great, funky/trendy/hip place to go have lunch or drinks, in a very authentic part of town. Awesome decor and environment, great food, and fast service. Definitely recommend you check it out! Dinged a star purely on difficulty to try and find (not intuitive from the street side - you have to be on the main street to be able to see their sign, otherwise you feel really lost).",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,1,1,4,5_An4KhxOLREnMRWJXH5xw
5628657,2014-06-03,0,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"First the positive.  Atmosphere really is 5 star.  It is trendy, eclectic, unique - all of these rolled into one.  This was our first time, and we loved the decor.  We also liked the food.  The menu is certainly unique, and most of the items we had were excellent.  Also can't beat the prices for the quality of the food.

The problem was in the service.  We went on a weeknight, and fairly early, and it was not crowded.  It took forever for our server to come.  She seemed more interested in chatting with some of the regulars, than working.  When she finally did come, she seemed very preoccupied.  When we asked questions on the menu, she did not seem to know the answers, and some of the answers proved to be incorrect.  She brought out wrong items, and rarely checked back.  She was very friendly, just  perhaps having an off night.

We will try again, and hope for better service, as the food and atmosphere make it worth a second try.",Y0qhtu7hHefyYctCLpExTA,1,0,4,-flS73wOzBJa9nb0wGXFYw

I forget the name of it but our waitress suggested a play on a Moscow mule with blood orange vodka and it was so damn tasty and refreshing I had to keep ordering it. spicy edamame is perfectly seasoned and I wanted to literally drink the rest of my sauce in the garlic shrimp. Was surprised how little our bill was for how much we got especially considering how fresh everything tasted. Love the decor and the ambiance, especially like the adorable and cozy patio. The menu has something for everyone with clever little names. Highly suggest it, great for a date night!",MWLGo48skmF5AAizEM06ig,0,0,5,55zMniJM1Y1z_FYK3NkJhg

I went in the morning so I didn't get a chance to sample their drink menu and kept it simple - eggs Benedict. But would go back and recommend it to anyone else.,IyjjzHO0CRf-MXJnKxk00w,0,0,4,HzvGiX8hi9pX5ChLLEaTNg
5700596,2016-07-21,0,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"This was my second visit to Mingo for lunch. Both times, how could I order anything else, I had the steak salad. It's not on the menu, but happily was the special for the day both times. 

The restaurant has two menus, the Mingo Kitchen menu - it looks inventive and the items sound delicious - AND the menu from Mundo's. 

I don't know what the evening crowd is like but the place has a quiet vibe for lunch. The room is draped in gray silk and has elegant tufted banquettes accented by turquoise leather chairs. Great music sets the mood. 

Back to today's lunch, the skirt steak was cooked perfectly and was served with marinated avocado and mixed greens with a chimichurri vinaigrette. Dessert today was churros y chocolate. Sabroso!",nmWtX_nwRL3Cnl1fTiI_Og,1,0,5,bwRhwHXRHhSMBhFaRVkpjw

When we corrected him, he just replied with ""well what do you want?""  I understand it's busy, I understand your drunk artist is being a pain, but you need to:

A.  Control your guest artist.  Maybe suggest water in between every drink?
B.  Have better guest relations, aka ""sorry's"" and ""thank you's"" go a long way. 
C.  For an artistic launch, actually staff the place with enough servers and bar staff to handle the influx of people.  
D.  Refill our drinks? 
E.  Actually get the paying guest's orders correct.

5843398,2017-04-23,1,zjvnqTjBp56NhMp1GrlO5g,"I have been to Mingos before and I loved coming here until I met the owner today... my friends and I came here for the bottomless mimosas on a Saturday. I've been looking forward my whole week to come relax and have brunch here. We arrive, and I'm checking out the artwork on the wall. I myself am an artist and was considering doing buisness here. I'm greeted by attitude. ""Id please"" followed by ""what do you want"". After being served with disrespect right off the bat, (whatever no big deal maybe he's just busy) we moved to the patio to order food, enjoy the mimosas and listen to the dj's that were playing. My girlfriend who is newly 21 gets sick after a few drinks and is in and out of the bathroom. The owner grabs her by the arm and warned her to stop selling drugs in the bathroom. Offended she gets rude with him. Excuse me??? You have a 1 person bathroom in your whole bar/restaurant. 1 toilet... It's busy. There's going to be a line. After accusing my friend he gets into it with my boyfriend as well. Never have I been to a place and felt such disrespect. Not only was he too stressed out to ask why she was in the bathroom, or let alone look at her and see she clearly sick from I don't know, maybe the bottomless mimosas?? He said ""look bitch, don't let me catch you selling drugs in my bathroom."" Of course she's going to respond with attitude. You can't come at people like that. Never will I bring buisness here again. Get more bathrooms and don't come at your customers like that if you plan to keep a good reputation with your community.",7pWhcxuLb-lpa10EcwHU2A,1,0,1,qXsfCPJpDK6xC_j8nHyE3Q

People are always freindly- customers and staff members alike. The food is incredible and affordable. Their street tacos are the best in the valley. Try the Vegetarian version. You will NOT be disappointed! They also now offer select menu items from the ""Mundo"" menu (a former restaurant recenty closed in the World Market.) Comfort Foods and Latin Chic. It's like being at a your Cool uncles house for a party. They have a great bar and knowledgable barstaff ready to make your tequila cocktails. They even have their special label - MINGOS PBR- that is all the rage. This place gets crazy on the ""First Friday's"" of the month. The streets are closed to create a temporary outdoor shopping and entertainment venue  in the arts district. It's a great place to eat before the smith center. Reservations recommended.

But as you walk in, the decor itself has a very goth/early euro. The deep purple and black colors make it very intriguing. Then they drop the menus and the names for all the items from the food to the drinks give you a giggle. Their menu is not for the conservative at heart. With names like N.O.T.O.R.I.U.S Pig or THE KANYE, drink names like THE BONER and JACK MY D, leaves people with dirty imaginations even dirtier minds. I enjoyed the BLOW POP which was quite delish. Me and my friend ordered their fried rice, edamame, ono fish and chips, and roasted garlic shrimp. Edamame was spicy so I didn't have much of it. The ono fish and chips were good, nothing outstanding to write home about. The garlic shrimp went well with the fried rice, though the fried rice was overly oily. All this for two people was A LOT. We could've done without the rice but our waiter suggested it with the shrimp. Service was good and attentive. They have sit down tables and a bar inside and outside.

The bar as cables for you to charge your phone so that's really nice. 
My boyfriend and I were meeting friends down there for a dinner before walking around at first Friday. Since you can't get a table unless your whole party is there, him and I waited at the bar and had a drink since they were running behind.
The bartender was really quick and made good drinks. 

When the other half of our party got there we got seated outside, it was nice so we did not mind at all!
What we did mind was the slow and kind of rude service. Our waiter took forever to come and take our drink orders. So we orders at the same time we ordered out drinks. 
We ordered an appetizer and unfortunately it came the same time our food did.
We order four meals and she only brought out three. She forgot about my grill cheese and soup. The food was really good though.
