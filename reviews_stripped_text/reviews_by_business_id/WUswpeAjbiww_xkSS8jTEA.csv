WARNING!!! Do NOT eat here!
Even though the service and food here were both below average, the worst has nothing to do with their bad food/service, but business ethics (the thing that keeps businesses from cheating their customers).
This restaurant, my dear reader, has violated the key principle of doing business - they are cheaters:
They put a couple of sales promotions on yelp to lure you in and spend money, but when it is time to pay, the servers stare at the yelp page i hold in my hand and have the guts to say: ""sorry, we can not honor that...""
Naturally, I asked: ""why not? You put it on your yelp page, so i think you should honor it.""
This is the restaurant's response: ""sorry, but we haven't done that for a while now.""
""Not for anybody?""
""Yeah...not for anybody.""
Well, that was the end of it.
End of conversation.
End of trust.

Do you want to help stop this cheating restaurant's dirty practices?
If yes, then please find your food elsewhere, in a better place, with way better ethics.
Thank you.",DuGuP8ox6GNWjSjJbUBlBA,4,0,1,FgXSF5w_OmaCJb27I1-5ow

The salsa they brought out with the chips was delicious. We got an order of asada tacos and the steak was very tender and everything tasted super fresh. The retried beans and rice were also great.

The tamales were new to me, as I've only had Mexican style tamales, but they were good. The pupusas were great! I need to find a similar spot that's closer to my house, or learn how to make my own since this is on the opposite side of the valley from my house. 

The staff was very friendly and explained what things were that we were unfamiliar with, such as loroco. If I found myself in this neighborhood again, I would definitely stop in for some pupusas.

I had the meat cakes which were similar to empanadas with meat and vegetables in it. They were delicious. And I also ordered their enchiladas. They put ketchup and an egg on top of it. It would've tasted better without the ketchup. But overall it was delicious. He handed me my horchata and I took one sip of it and almost spit it out all over the place. It was the most disgusting thing I've tasted in my life. It literally tasted like peanuts and garlic and just left a horrid taste in my mouth. I told the guy it was nasty and i asked if I can have something else and he said the soda machine was broken.

Then we are given water with no ice that's warm as well as a warm coke. There were only 5 tables including us there and yet we had the waitress only come to us to bring our food. She never checked in on us or offered a refill even for our water or offer more chips. So a total of 45 minutes since our arrival we finally get our food. We got the molcajete and it was bland and the chorizo was undercooked. Undercooked pork is definitely not ok. The chicken was nasty and steak was flavorless. I basically just ate the nopales and beans. The waitress was also rude when we asked her for ice for our warm coke and water. She slammed the cup of ice on our table and didn't say anything.

THEN... we show the waitress out 15% off for checking in and she said she couldn't process it with our debit card. We told her she can put it through as credit but she said it didn't work. Then we told her if she could just calculate the 15% and just take it off the bill but nope. So we had to pay in full for this nasty food and horrible service. 

Just don't come here. There's way better places in Las Vegas.

At first we would order at least once a month. Our usual was pupusas and I have gotten pan con pollo. And everything in taste was great! But just recently after being a usually customer they told me of a special that was when you buy 15 pupusas  they are $1 each. So of course that became our weekly spot. When our family gets together for game night we always order 20+ pupusas and I never had anything to complain. I would order before picking up and always gave me my food by when they said it would be ready. Now after 1 1/2 months of going every week and ordering for our weekly family get together they start with making us wait 40 min after they tell us they would be ready (when I order 1 hr before) to give us our food and ontop of that the cole slaw(curtido)  they want to give us 2 sandwich size ziplock bags for 33 pupusas and they were very rude in telling me that if I want more to buy more for 1.99. Come one now. When I've ordered 20 they give me 2 1/2 shouldn't I get more for 33. I'm a frequent customer. You would think it being a family owned restaurant that they would treat you better. I am very disappointment and will be taking my  business elsewhere. 



After not having pupusas for a few months. Today we decided to have some for brunch. After talking to Jorge he was very helpful  & corrected what went wrong the last time.
