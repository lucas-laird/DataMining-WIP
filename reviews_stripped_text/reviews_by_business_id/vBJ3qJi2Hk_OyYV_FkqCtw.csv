If you have a sense of adventure, this is a good place to try. The broth and the barbacoa by the pound are their main staples, one pound should feed a couple just fine. The barbacoa by the pound comes with freshly made tortillas. They have tacos and other Mexican foods too.

If you are not sure about what barbacoa is, Wikipedia has a good enough entry.",d4SrMzG-Cm5ptZjoAHmiIg,0,0,5,_9b2R1n_2zk8gUGwdg8OJQ

1418547,2016-06-23,0,vBJ3qJi2Hk_OyYV_FkqCtw,Omg I've lived across the street from this place and am so upset that I never stopped by. Best tacos I've had in town so far.... Everything we ordered was great... Even my kids (who can be picky) loved it here. This is a hole in the wall place you can't go without trying... You won't be disappointed. Handmade tortillas..... And great service,-17vUkGqkl1-Pkw5TTcTrw,0,0,5,UembSdGELCCzCzY2Sk1sVw

The first time I came here I was not able to eat the food because they had closed early and I was so sad. 

the next time I was driving by and saw they were open, quickly we came in and ordered 2 barbacoa plates with consume (broth). This place is amazing, incredible and fresh. I will be back! I have been searching for a place close to the mexican food in LA and this place is as close as it can get if not better. 

They have the oil chili sauce, I had never had and I am addicted. Since leaving I have been craving it and want to come back. I will be back!!!!",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,1,0,5,Ubh1dKxFa_u5cRLFY9oGBQ

The tortillas are home made/ hand made fresh that's why I gave it the 4 stars. 
I had the consum√©, it was okay nothing to rave about.  The barbocoa was ok too; it was kinda bland.   I had to add a lot of condiments like salsa, onion, cilantro etc

My usual dish is the tripe tacos. They're crispy, fatty and oh so yummy. The tortillas are hand made, so they have this amazing chew to it. My second go to are the soups. They're flavorful and contain a lot of meat. If you're not sure about which to choose they give out samples. .

4800892,2018-05-16,0,vBJ3qJi2Hk_OyYV_FkqCtw,I came here since it's not too far from home and decided to try something new . Going in it smells like you're walking into a mechanic shop. I figured this is because of the scooter repair shop next door. I went to order my food which was 2 huaraches 2 drinks and 1 horchata. My total was $36. This seemed pretty pricey compared to other local mexican restaurants. When I asked for a receipt to see how much was each thing he just wrote the items I ordered and the total on the bottom. He didn't want to write each price per item. Turns out the huaraches are $12 each not $10. When I finally got my order the food didn't really have flavor and was cute up taco meat instead of the thin steak these are known for. It had so little meat and all together the food didn't have a good flavor . I won't be coming here again.,7pMw365nSwoiD7fP58UgKw,0,0,2,je0vh5xaQjp19WWW38QyEA
5141660,2018-04-20,1,vBJ3qJi2Hk_OyYV_FkqCtw,"A couple of weeks ago I had the misfortune to dine at a trendy modern Latin/fusion restaurant miles from here and they served something they passed off as barbacoa (it was more like mop strands soaked in mild chili sauce) the barbacoa I grew up with was done with beef cheeks and/or the meat from the head braised then flash grilled to add some crispy bits. You haven't lived till you come home from school and find a whole cow's head is staring at you from the fridge. Today I set out to find decent barbacoa.

This place is about barbacoa and straight up real Mexican comfort food. The barbacoa is done Hidalgo style using lamb instead of beef. I sampled two barbacoa tacos, beans, and the salsa bar. The Barbacoa was the best I've had since my childhood. It was rich, dense, and succulent. I went over board with the great tasting condiments but the barbacoa was unmistakably excellent.  The decor is spartan, clean, and a telanovela is usually playing on the mounted TV.  But you don't come to places like this to ponder ambiance and art work, you come for the real deal.",TxYvDePA67VeFBwnh-wr8A,0,0,5,fDI58_BPNjXW336b2uVigw

Takes me back to my childhood when I went to go visit Mexico for the first time. it was the most amazing thing I have ever tried.! We also ordered a burrito de Asada the meat was so tender and was perfect usually when I try Asada anywhere else the meat is hard and dry but nope NOT here ! Salsa's were amazing and spicy !

5657034,2016-11-30,0,vBJ3qJi2Hk_OyYV_FkqCtw,"The meats are really very, very good.   The barbacoa,  and Michoacan-style pork were very tasty - - in isolation.    Maybe getting meats by the pound is the way to go, as one Yelper suggested.

But the low score is for the tacos I had.   Again, the meats were good;  the salsas were also good;  the tortillas were light and fresh.  It's just that, these were not very good tacos.  The flavors do not match, and they do not blend into a satisfying product.   I think the main problem are the tortillas - - they have a simplicity and a sweetness, but the flavors do not match the meats, nor the salsas.  These tacos were not a well conceived whole, from a flavor perspective, and they were not that enjoyable to eat.

Really caring service though.",oDftpTXngPupJl4HuVX29g,1,0,2,6S_Gvi-rW00wjDHKHFhBLg

They were efficient as well. Not knowing some of the menu items we chose tacos. An excellent choice, chicken was cooked with very unique spices and tender. We tried 2 types of pork and both were tasty. The soft tortillas had a find flavor and texture. The beans brought back good memories. So, the food they are known for must be fantastic.
