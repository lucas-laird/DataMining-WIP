I've never been to a restaurant with such an attentive staff. I had to special order an off-menu dinner because of my diet.  The wait staff was very accommodating. Chef Gustav, the owner,  even came out to talk to me twice. First to explain my different meal options before ordering  Then to make sure I was happy with what he made. I definitely was! My family enjoyed their meals too. They tried 4 different desserts and said all were delicious. They sure looked it! I'll be coming here regularly on my trips to the area. Well done!! Thank you Chef Gustav, Peter, and  Spiedini staff!!",UDFj3QBSMr25f3s91S4Bqg,0,0,5,yMMOcE1sjc8S3nHB-1tvLw

any quick service and attention!  It was a Saturday evening on a holiday weekend, I do take that into consideration.  

A waiter took our order without any introduction, another person brought
our place settings and filled our water glasses.  This person continued
to supply water and remove the salad and appetizer plates which he
brought.

The waiter brought our entrees and that was the last time we saw him.
We completed our dinner and waited, and waited.  Finally, the dirty
plates were removed.  We waited and waited (perhaps because we were
seated in the back, perhaps, because my Husband did not wear long
pants, perhaps!?

We finally got someone's attention and he brought dessert menus.  The
menus sat, as we, at the table so long that another waiter came and
attempted to take them away.

The water glasses were filled again (hmmm, perhaps because we did not
order any alcohol, our bill would not warrant a huge tip,)  We placed
our dessert order and requested coffee.

We waited again to the point that we considered canceling the final order!

It did arrive, finally, with a bill and delivered by the waiter!  I told
him, ""We missed you!""

He mumbled that he and the other person worked together!!  Please,
the other person was a ""buser.""   He should receive the tip!  We felt
we were targeted to receive such poor service!?

Not at all the attention and courtesies we received on other visits.
Disappointed!   There are additional restaurants in the Casino.
There are lovely restaurants in the area.

Our waitress took our salad and entree orders and the salad arrived pretty quickly.

When the server brought the check, I had to remind him to apply the Restaurant.com certificate.

I wanted this place to be good, since it's close to my house and I love Italian food.  I had high hopes after reading some of the reviews, but my fiance' and I ultimately left disappointed.  

We were there on a Saturday night, and there was maybe ten people in the place, which we should have taken as a sign.  We split the signature chopped salad, and  Fusilli With Lobster dish.  The salad was soaked in their russian dressing, which made it very heavy and rich when mixed with the avocados and bacon.  Some people may like it, but we thought it was a bit too heavy.  As for the pasta, it seemed to smell and taste a bit fishy and the sauce had no flavor.  Needless to say.. we had two bites of each dish and that was it, we paid our bill and left.

One of our favorite things on our trip to JW is Spiedini, as we've always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I called ahead and talked to Avana to make a Valentine's Night dinner reservation, and asked her if we could use the Restaurant.com coupon and if the regular menu would be offered. She wasn't sure, so she put me on hold to check with the manager. She came back and said that we could use the coupon and that the regular menu would be in effect. Lo and behold, we stopped in the bar about a half-hour prior to our dinner reservation to have a couple of drinks and saw that there was a special Valentine's menu. I asked if the regular menu would be available and the manager said no. While there are a couple dishes that we tend to order off the regular menu, we decided to deal with it. When our table was ready, we figured we had better make sure again that the coupon would be accepted; and the manager said no. I told him that I had called a month before to make a reservation and that I checked with Avana if the coupon would be accepted on Feb 14 and she said it would be. He replied with only an apology with no other consideration. We were very disappointed and left the hotel to eat elsewhere.

1419179,2014-04-16,0,FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA,"Honestly, Yelpers, I'm beginning to get really annoyed with members leaving harsh reviews/low ratings for places that have good food, (and conversely 5 stars for something truly terrible like the casino buffet in the JW Marriott where I'm currently staying). Spiedini (also in the Marriott) deserves much better than its current 3 star overall rating. I'd say that most dishes are 4 star worthy and a few 5 stars, so I'm giving 5 stars because it should be bumped up. 

My husband and I have dined here 4 times in the past year, and tried a variety of dishes. Our favorites include the halibut with capers and tomato (superb, moist), the gorgonzola crusted rib eye (freaking yummy), the osso bucco (very, very good), the saltimbocca chicken (super tasty), the fresh beet salad, and the beef carpaccio. Also very good was the lobster risotto (huge chunks of lobster), the cioppino (delicious), the spinach salad with pear, blue cheese and walnuts, the arancini risotto balls, and the house chop salad.  The atmosphere is nice as well.

The meal left a little to be desired, I ordered the ribeye, I realize this is an Italian restaurant but my experience is most Italian restaurants cook an amazing steak. However, this is not the case here, any amateur at home cook could probably produce a better tasting ribeye, theirs lacked any substantial seasoning, salt and pepper, and relied heavily on a watered down sauce.

The food is excellent, the service is great, the wine list is reasonable and broad enough to please most, if not all palates. 
So let's start at the beginning...   Bread basket is fair, good, but no variety.  Had a lovely Belvedere Dirty Martini to start and it was well made.  We moved on to Aranici which was a special app and YUMMO! flavors were great, sauce was fresh.  I then had the half spinach salad, really good but HUGE only hate half the half lol.  We had a nice bottle of proseco with the meal, there was only one option by the bottle which was fine.  I then had the straw and hay, delicious but highly fililng, but my goodness there is something about fresh pees with cream sauce and pasta that simply makes me happy.  We finished with their dessert trio (which you can completely customize, just ask) we had the Tiramisu, Chocolate Cake and the creme brulee, I am not a Creme Brulee but the rest was awesome.  Coffee was fabulous italian coffee and they bring an entire carafe to your table.  The restaurant is beautiful, food is really good and service is great, I would highly recommend this place.

What is worth sharing to the world:

Signature Chopped Salad: Not the typical chopped salad, more like a expertly created chopped salad with the right amount of everything!

Osso Bucco: Home Cooking Flavors Deeply Infused in the Os So Tender Meat!

Wild Alaskan Halibut: Not the usual Wild Alaskan Salmon but an Amazing Fillet of fish with perfectly balanced spices!

Short rib ravioli: To Die For!!!!!

They mixed up my dishes and somehow my ravioli ended up being lobster. The waitress doubted me but immediately offered to replace it.

The wine was another story. I know my wines pretty well and am still not convinced I had a 2007 Zinfandel from Paso Robles. I didn't get that replaced but it wasn't like I had been drinking all day.

The bar tender had way too much to manage and it seemed to be a slow night.  They would not serve us on their absolutely beautiful peaceful patio surrounded by waterfalls and a lake full of koi. It's the best part of what they have to offer and we were stuck at the bar.  But we went outside after putting up with the marginal food......the patio could not make up for the food but we enjoyed it very much but why not open up your best asset? The Hawthorne grill was way better,gw6FV2Z07axlDjWhIrczyA,1,0,3,c__iBHpT7sdlIbXNAbLFCA
2336796,2013-02-19,1,FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA,"I had Spiedini bookmarked for forever, so when we decided to do Valentine's Day dinner close to home, it was a no-brainer.  I emailed to make reservations the weekend before (which I thought might be a little late) - and breathed a sigh of relief when I got an email back saying we were in!  

We arrived at about 10 minutes prior to our reservation time and there was already a line out the door.  The hostess station was set up so that the hostesses were facing INTO the restaurant, not out to the arriving patrons - which was kind of a pain.  We had to push past all the people that were waiting for tables and enter the restaurant in order to let them know we were there.  There were at least 3 hostesses working the station - and we checked in with two of them. They said it would be a few minutes. We waited, saw a large party that had arrived before us get seated - good!  Everything is moving along!  We just had to wait for three more couples to be seated and we'd be in!  Then a party of two that were a walk-in got seated.  We checked in again at the hostess station to make sure they hadn't forgotten us.  When the hostesses made like they were going to seat another party that had arrived after us - another couple that had been waiting as well stepped in and got pretty testy with them. That couple were immediately seated. A half-hour after our reservation time, we checked in for a third time and were finally granted a table.

The restaurant was obviously way over-booked - and the wait staff were apologizing left and right for that (even though it wasn't their fault). They alone saved this review from being a one star. We ordered off of the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu and ordered a bottle of really inexpensive but wonderful sparkling wine. The Roasted beet salad was terrific, the grilled salmon solidly done and the berry shortcake for dessert was good too. I'd be willing to give Spiedini another try on a less busy holiday based on the quality of the food alone. The courses came out of the kitchen S.L.O.W.L.Y - which I wouldn't have minded so much if I hadn't planned on getting up at 5:30 the next morning for a trip out of town. 

Two and a half hours after our reservation time, we got up to pay the bill. I was looking forward to raving about this experience - but the anarchic hostess station, the over-booked status of the restaurant and the overwhelmed kitchen unfortunately put a damper on the the whole meal.  Kudos to the wait staff for being so nice and professional under pressure - we tipped them well because we felt so bad for them.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,1,1,2,Scrk6bOuvk1yh8-cYDFGKA

The restaurant decor is nice and the hostess was pleasant. We were almost immediately greeted by our server Marc, but that was it for about ten minutes.

When he returned, my wife ordered ""red wine blend"" directly off the wine menu. The waiter seemed confused, and ask us which one. Again, my wife said ""red win blend"" which was EXACTLY as it was written on the menu. He said what? I then took the menu from my wife and pointed my finger at the line on the menu. The waiter then says, oh sorry I can't read that, I don't have my glassed on. WTF? Anyway, that is about how it went with the waiter for the rest of the night. He was very snobbish and really didn't do anything for us besides take our order. The bussers did all the heavy lifting.

I ordered ribeye ($28) that was good, but not great. Wife got chicken parmigiana ($20) thet was good, but not great. Appetizer bread was plain, had to ask for more basalmic vinegar jsut to get some flavor on it. Food reminds me a lot of standard italian fare (olive garden, macaroni grill, etc.). Certianly not worth the price.

Our fabulous waiter Marc did add 18% gratutity on it to final bill for us since we were using a restaurant.com voucher. He probably realized that he was not going to get anywhere near that from us. I thought about complaining but we just wanted to get out of there since he took so long to get us the check to begin with.

Bottom line, is skip this place. It is way over-priced, even if the service was good. Just not worth it for ordinary italian food. We will not return there.",GH38M8OQfvM-tZLZn3t1Gw,1,0,2,p8D2tdk9yA_kBR_z4psHUA

4484622,2015-05-13,2,FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA,"I had dinner at Spiedini once before, when I first moved to Vegas, when Yelp didn't even have a foothold.  At that time, it had been suggested by our real estate agent, who joined us for dinner.  My recollection was of a dimly-lit, sorta romantic upscale place, with high prices to go along with it.  Fast forward 10 years, and what a difference a decade makes.  

We were warmly greeted at the entrance and immediately shown to a table.  The first thing that struck me was how bright the restaurant is:  every pendant, recessed, and accent light at full blast, making it seem like the good old days at Senior's restaurant in Brooklyn, aptly named for its clientele.  Where was the mood lighting of my memory?  Gone, gone, gone.

Service was excellent throughout our dinner.  I was happy to see a good German Riesling on the menu, rather than the ubiquitous Chateau Ste. Michelle that's on every other restaurant's list.  Two kinds of decent bread were in the basket, promptly delivered along with olive oil/balsamic.  

Hubby started with gazpacho.  It had a good taste, though it was missing the usual garnish of chopped veggies.  It did, though, have a bit of avocado.  But in my book, gazpacho needs to be served very cold, even on ice, and this one wasn't quite cold enough.  

I ordered from the list of specials, a pork tenderloin w/ prosciutto, served with sauteed spinach and garlic mashed.  The pork was sliced paper-thin, but wasn't dried out.  It was covered with a tasty brown sauce chock full of fresh dark mushroom quarters.  Normally I'm not a fan of sauces, but I liked this one.  The fresh spinach was full of garlic slices (yum!), but the mashed potatoes were shockingly bad:  thin, watery, flavorless, and tasting as if they'd come out of a box (a dollar store box at that).  I asked for a replacement, and cheerfully was served a large portion of the roasted potatoes, and those were very good.  There was plenty of pork, and those potatoes, so I have enough for another meal.

My husband had the meatballs and spaghetti.  He thought they were okay, but wasn't smacking his lips.  I tasted the meatballs and didn't like them, but I detest meatballs made with pork, which this seemed to have.  And it's rare for me to like a meatball that doesn't taste like the ones my mom used to make, even though her cooking in general left much to be desired. (Well-done liver, anyone?).  I didn't try his spaghetti, so I can't speak to it's ""toothsome-ness,"" but it wasn't a very large portion.

The prices, while not low, aren't as relatively high as they were 10 years ago.  My entree, at $20, was a much better value than Herb's, which was $19.  In a contrarian move, this restaurant seems to buck the tide of all the others:  many of the specials are the same price or lower than the ones on the regular menu.  That's almost unheard of these days.

I've been seesawing between 3 and 4 stars, but downgraded it to 3 because of the lighting, the awful mashed potatoes, and the stingy portion of balls and pasta.  I enjoyed my dinner, and three stars means A-OK so I'll stick with that for now.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,4,3,P5ZGnn14dcG8HbRkBk1hjQ

We started with the Arancini Balls. I was happy to find them here because they stopped serving them at Born and Raised. They were nice and golden on the outside with an addicting rice combination on the inside. Yum! 

Then we shared their signature chopped salad ($9.00) . It looked like a work of art.... I didn't want to eat it. It had romaine, avocado, corn, tomato, crisp pieces of bacon, and Russian dressing. It had a creamy consistency to it and had the perfect blend of flavors. It was delicious! 

I ordered the Fusilli (corkscrew pasta) with Lobster ($26.00) . It came with sun dried tomatoes, peas, cremini mushrooms, lobster topped with lobster rose sauce. I didn't think I was going to like it at first because I was leaning towards a white sauce . I usually go with the waiter's recommendations if I'm feeling stuck  because they know their menu better than I would.   My other choices were Lobster Risotto or the Lobster Ravioli. I went with the waiter's choice.  I liked that the sun dried tomatoes were still a little juicy on the inside and the sauce was creamy. I also enjoyed the sweet flavor of the lobster. 

We ended the meal with a light dessert Cassata Napoltena ($6.00). It had layers of Pistachio, Chocolate and Vanilla Bean ice cream with Strawberries on top. It is just enough for sharing especially if you are stuffed to the brim with pasta!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,6,2,4,V0FF5xXQ8Zv0FLY_LemrXQ

5114377,2017-10-08,1,FXiPQQGr_2bwlJ4wOrW2eA,"One of the worst services I have ever received. EVER. Dinner lasted two hours where an hour+ of it was waiting around for our server. Seriously understaffed restaurant if there is only one waiter on the floor for a Saturday night. 

I can't say much about the food. It was decent. Nothing spectacular or memorable. I ordered the salmon with orzo dish and it was meh. The salmon was kind of chewy and over cooked in my opinion. The orzo with vegetable medley was a bit too oily to my liking.  The ribeye entree though was a generous portion for ~$30. 

Service is awful and the floor manager was just as bad. We sat for 30 minutes waiting for our bill to be picked up when multiple times the floor manager,  bus boy, bread servers, waiters kept walking by and nothing. Our sever checked in maybe only once during our meal and we didn't see him the rest of the night. I can go on and on about how terrible service is. 

Take home point is never coming back. Don't waste your time at this Italian restaurant. Food is mediocre, service is crappy, and don't expect them to bring back anything they say they will box up for you.",6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw,4,3,1,_Ccexu6h501Oy_curulwNg

Tried this place out after all the mixed yelp reviews with an optimistic outlook. Sadly, my boyfriend and I were more than disappointed, we were embarrassed. We are both in the industry and try to be forgiving, but I honestly wish I had picked a different place to ""treat"" him. 

Service was the absolute worst, with the exception of the assistant server, or possibly busser that offered the most presence at our table. He earns the star. OH, and the lovely hostess in the front, girl has potential for a much better restaurant,  what a warm first impression! 

Our actual server forgot our drinks, which we didn't get until the main course, and we foolishly ordered 3 (appetizer, salad, main), which was the only course in which he happened to check back on us. As he had been taking our order, the manager was so unprofessional, he walked up behind him to tell him something as we're trying to order! 

The food was bland and tired: fried calamari,  sad salads not worth mentioning, I got a ravioli dish that I'd rather forget,  and the osso bucco that my boyfriend ordered may have been good, but I honestly can't remember beyond the rest of the experience.

However, the waitress ruined the entire experience. She was one of the most rude servers I've ever come across. I understand that holiday parties cause stress and often lower payouts, but that does not excuse screaming at patrons to the point of embarrassment simply because they caught her attention at a bad time. She mixed up several orders at our table and was annoyed rather than apologetic when we brought it up. Overall she had a very bad attitude that ended up ruining what would otherwise have been a great night.",Ar-0s6JAO3b17NWZ-_FH6w,0,0,1,pFw6S9vBfCIDVUp15sHmLw

We started with cocktails and a few passed appetizers.  I ordered a belvedere vodka with soda and lime.  The drink was perfectly prepared.  My husband was impressed with their beer selection as they had a few quite unique options.  Others commented on their wine selection and how good the house red was.

Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I started with a half of their chopped salad and for my entree I had the Chicken Milanese  (the menu has veal but I opted for chicken).  It was perfectly and lightly fried in what seems to be a panko like breading.  Served with sautéed mixed vegis and roasted potatoes that tasted great!  My nephew had the chicken parm and he devoured it until he was able to lick his plate clean!  No dessert for this girl but those that did order made me jealous!  They serve assorted sorbet and gelato's along with tiramisu and other awesome looking sweet treats!

Arrive early for a cocktail in their quaint bat area.  You can enter from the back parallel with the Summerlin Pkwy if you wish to avoid the casino and hotel area.",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,5,2,5,03T_X7G17Uau79Lrg3oCTA

I had my usual manhattan..my son had an Old Fashioned and my wife had her pinot grigio. All very good. Bread was slightly stale..OK..no home run. Caesar salads were good..very tasty. Star of the menu here is the lobster ravioli...my son highly recommended. My wife gave the risotto lobster a thumbs up. My daughter had the chicken sambocca...gave it her OK/average rating. I had the veal milanese dinner. Maybe a little dry but very tasty--I liked it. I had the mango sorbet for dessert....very flavorful but icy--hanging in the freezer too long? We all enjoyed our waiter Raul...full of personality. He never hovered...but was always there with a recommendation or a water re-fill. He's a pro. Not sure I'd make a special trip here for dinner....but if you are staying over..its a decent spot to have dinner.,NcYAAsxBG0Ypxva-0UN7dA,0,0,3,ABpXqTh3y37xhIdvtpOeNw

Lobster ravioli was good but a Tad on the fishy flavor side which I enjoyed but my date didn't care for it much. No cocktail menu. No music...could hear kitchen noises clearly. Service was average at best, with our server not listening to our orders and doing things his way. Spinach salad had tasteless pear rinds and prosciutto was salty and too crispy. Gelatto and sorbets were really good.
Overall it seemed it was reheated frozen entrees, and not even done as well as olive garden. The atmosphere was nice, but resembles the dining room on a cruise ship.",eVufnL_jVKhqqeaAfysgCw,1,0,2,4JUx1Fl7-Z4Jx2AS7tP6Kw

This establishment is very poorly managed and the  ""manager"" could not have been ruder in his attitude..... This restaurant certainly does NOT fit in with the outstanding excellence of the hotel that it is located in! They took over an hour to bring our food to our party of four, and made no excuses or gave no apology, or for that matter even checked up on us during this waiting period..... by the time the food did finally arrive, our entire party was wanting an explanation, so the waiter says that they had problems with an oven in the back..... funny thing is, we all had salads... then the ""manager"" offers to ""comp"" some dessert items of his choice.... I just wanted to get the check, cut my loses and leave, so I say that why don't they just  take off at least 10 percent instead of the comped desserts, to which he claims that he can't do that! ( He certainly could have, he's the manager, he just didn't want to!) Then after the completion of our meal, it takes yet another 30 minutes to bring the desserts and another 45 minutes to bring the check!  I am so glad that I did not let the waiter box up my food, but rather I had asked for a box so that I could do it myself, then I had read a couple other reviews here about how requests for food to be boxed up get thrown out.... I would not recommend this establishment until there are some serious changes made....",Np7-8e9aIGrZ1GH4qD_Tfg,1,0,1,vArclhz4e8dOByaAYMd0Bw
