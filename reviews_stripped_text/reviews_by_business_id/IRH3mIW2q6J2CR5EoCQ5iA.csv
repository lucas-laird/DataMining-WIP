Anyways, when I first stepped in, a tvb series was showing on tv.  I thought to myself that I already like this place. This place is pretty small, they don't have space for parties more than 6 I guess.  

Food we ordered:

Hot HK Milk Tea: A little bit on the sweet side, too bad they don't have free refills, otherwise it would be a real good deal.  $1.50

Baked Pork Chop Rice: This dish surprised me because their ketchup tasted great.  Great meaning, it beat Wendy Cafe's baked pork chop ketchup, it beat Anna Garden's baked pork chop ketchup.  The pork chop came breaded, but the breading tasted a bit stale, which was really disappointing.  Rice was nothing great. 

BBQ Chicken Pasta: Chicken tasted like any bbq chicken.   The pasta came without any sauce, it was sorta dried.  I don't understand how people would like to eat pasta and bbq chicken without any sauce.  But they figured it works.  Oh wells.

Final words: 1 star for showing TVB series, 1 start for cleanliness, 1 star for the ketchup.  I just hope in the future they would expand their menu because I see a lot of potential for this joint.  Hopefully more business will roll in as time pass by.",J-WfsRmH4VPsycArml_G9Q,2,1,3,-UgWglwErO0QR-A_T460yQ

Girlfriend and I both ordered the baked pork chop rice and it was... 3 stars. The fried rice was good and the pork chop was crisp and not oily and already sliced for you. Unfortunately, the tomatoey cheesy sauce had too much corn starch or something in it and I had to remove all the sauce. I was happy just eating the rice and pork chop.  

The reason for the 4 stars is for the milk tea! Only $1.75 and the guy kept refilling my drink! For free! The milk tea is delicious and refreshing in the hot Vegas weather.",ElxoM6w2NxZp6amnFUok8Q,1,0,4,F6WZRVpCtkIl1MuBYcbV4A

A small hole in the wall (but clean!) joint owned by a man who once used to live in the Bay Area. So, he knows good Canto Cafe food I guess. 

I ordered the Curry Beef Stew over a bed of seasoned pasta. Think flat Yee-Mein. It's all about how flavorful the curry is and this one is no exception. Although, not as spicy and temperature hot as I'd like, it was pretty darn delicious. 

My friends ordered the Baked Pork Chop and Seafood over rice. They say it's good, too. I trust them since they're pretty much 'from' Hong Kong. 

I like to compared it to VIP in San Francisco w/out all the baked bread goods.

Worth a try!",ghkA0lS1WrDitjit4gZUFQ,1,1,4,ni0hCr8uQxOodSqwndtZOw

But soon after we ordered, the restaurant filled up.  This place is quite small with only handful of tables.  I ordered the curry beef with rice and my wife ordered their baked pork chop rice.  We also had deep fried chicken wings as our appetizer.  The chicken wings were okay, nothing special, but their curry beef and baked pork chop were quite good.   The curry beef was in a bowl with steamed rice at the side.  The baked pork chop rice was made with fried rice topped with sliced pork chop and baked with tomato sauce.  I also tasted some cheese inside the tomato sauce.  It was a little different than the normal baked pork chop that I am accustom to.  Normally the cheese is melted on top of the dish and not mixed inside the sauce, but not a bad taste at all.   You also get free refills on the milk tea and coffee/tea combos.  Quite a delightful lunch.  I must come back to try their other dishes.  The last time I was here, their menu selection was very limited.  Now, there are quite a few dishes to choose from.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,1,1,5,gdtFAfru6evOZ6CUaZvlVw

they are very reasonably priced and the food is surprisingly tasty.

we sampled the garlic chicken wings, my husband liked it, but i thought i lacked a little flavor. the crispy garlic is good though.

i really enjoyed the salted fish and chicken fried rice. and the portion was huge! they didnt skimp on the salted fish like most restaurants with is a big plus for me!

i bought my dad some jook, since he wasnt feeling well, he had the salted pork with thousand year old egg porridge. it was pretty tasty, just enough saltiness and not too watery.

At our later visit my dad had their curry beef? i dont know how it was but i assumed it was good since my dad finished it. we also had the beef chow fun, it was very good, a lot of flavor from the ""fire"" from the stove.

there were a few more items we had, but overall i'm pretty pleased with this very small but cozy hole in a wall restaurant that is outside of the strip of vegas.

and because its not on the strip, its not going to hurt your wallet eating so much!",COE_5B8t15Crz8U3BP67og,0,0,4,G9Pyfsy5PLkqOJllwb4sLQ

Very tasty and not too spicy.  The chow fun was good too.  Singapore noodles were good but not as tasty compared to the beef stew.  The chicken claypot rice was kinda plain but still ok.  Good portions for everything, overall very satisfying.",kHr4Tt5sUR9Z0263DCMh-w,0,0,4,3a9PoK7SnReNCmNgXaydxg

I was looking for Asian BBQ & Noodles on Jones, for some reason I couldn't find the restaurant, instead I saw this new opened place, that's when I realized I'm on Decatur and not on Jones. Still buzzed from last night's alcohol. Lol.

I stopped by anyway to see what they offered. It's a pretty small place with a limited menu. They only have 15 different items. Yes that's right. 15 items. Kind of weird combination of selection as well. Their signature is listed below:

Baked escargot in herbal butter - $6.50 
Crispy shrimp spring rolls - $4.95
Oxtail Soup - $7.50
BBQ chicken w Rice/Pasta - $5.95
Curry chicken rice - $4.95
Hainan chicken w flavored rice - $6.95
BBQ short rib w rice/pasta - $7.50
Baked pork chop over rice/linguine - $6.95
Baked mixed seafood linguini/rice - $7.50
BBQ chicken sandwich - $5.95
Grilled pork chop ion a bun - $5.95

The best deal will be their curry rice. A really good amount of curry chicken rice for only $4.95. I tasted their curry earlier, taste pretty good. I also tried their milk tea, it was not good at all. The milk flavor is too strong compared with the tea. I will try most of their item in near future.

For now I only give 3 stars, but once I try more of their food and if the flavor above standard, it will be an easy 4 stars.",aIZMN-Sn90rpxOUaXAxKaA,3,2,3,DBLxtI7_BOlwPr-qJaCX6Q
5918497,2010-11-29,1,IRH3mIW2q6J2CR5EoCQ5iA,"Came back recently to get more of their bomb Garlic Crispy Chicken Wings and noticed that they also have a spicy version.  I opted to go with my old fav, and it did not disappoint.  I also ordered the Curry Chicken over Rice (you can also have it over noodles instead), and the curry was good.  However, the larger pieces of chicken were slightly undercooked, just the way the French Chefs like their poultry. 

If you need to brush up on your Chinese, drop in and watch some TV while you wait for your take out order or while you eat.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,1,3,zLV9S-gMqtTZD2_PLLL5WQ
