Someone needs to tell the owners they should have that at ALL locations so I dont have to drive so far next time. Came around 3 in the afternoon on Monday and the placed was packed with kids so I ended up taking order to go.

I was working with a television show whose taco truck fell through last minute. Since everyone was really looking forward to tacos I suggested this place. I called them up and they said no problem and were nice and accommodating to me and said we should do the make your own taco platters. When we got there to pick them up they were ready right on time and gave us so much. They were super nice (even though I know we were being at least a little bit of a pain) and the food was amazing. Everyone loved it and the fact they could put together the perfect taco. I'm definitely coming back here on my own with my bf regularly now. I was also really impressed with the inside because from outside it looks like a tiny hole in the wall, but it's really nice and very clean looking. You guys really got my vote as one of the best places I've been to in Vegas keep up the good work!",OQSya1DStf-2a3o9dcHXug,1,0,5,nKcp7-qlWSENcfLEo4nJNQ
200082,2012-07-16,0,H2Chxto2e6dHTDJ8-s3-pQ,"I like Roberto's, been to several other location, this one isn't as nice.

Question first: Isn't it standard to get sour cream with burrito?  Maybe I've been spoiled by Taco Bell lol.  

Charged $0.95 for sour cream.  Which is fine even though I thought sour cream was standard. When I got the carne asada burrito, there was no sour cream in it!  I took it to the counter, and she says, (i'm paraphrasing because she didn't speak english very well) see that green?  You see how it's not all green?  How it has a milky white to the green?  Well that's the sour cream mixed in.  Okay, so for $0.95 I get a hint of sour cream.  

I asked for a cup of water, she turns on the sink water and throws it in a cup, because apparently the soda machine doesn't have a ""water"" option on it. 

The carne asada meat was saltier than normal.",KMH0-vcV0atzuNN0LABsRQ,0,0,2,rtwmNtE6XFv0Vl6a6ezXlA
330182,2008-03-18,2,H2Chxto2e6dHTDJ8-s3-pQ,"When I first came to Vegas, I was almost thrown in the stockade and burned at the steak for asking, ""Whaa?"" when someone mentioned Roberto's (affectionately Americanized into Robert's by my friends and I).  ""HERETIC!"" they cried.  Luckily, I pulled out my sugary sweet tea smile and explained in the thickest Southern accent I could muster that I was just a girl from lil' ol' North Care-liiina, and I was forgiven.

NOW I know that Robert's is the ultimate hangover food.  One friend always gets the rolled taco meal with guac, the guy likes the carne asada super nachos with sour cream, beans, and cheese only.  Another friend with an empty leg clears a california burrito with all the fixin's, super carne asada nachos, AND a quesadilla.  I love the chili rellenos and tortillas.  

And who needs to worry about drunk driving to this place at 4 am when I can easily stumble a block down the street to get here!  And if you don't live a block away from THIS location, I'm sure you're a block away from SOME location--they are about as prolific as rabbits in springtime.

So, go get yourself a pollo asado burrito with sour cream and cheese, and wash it down with a tall glass of horchata.  You'll thank me in the morning.

The meat tasted horrid, even worse than ground meat bought at some bad supermarket, and I don't even think it was steak. I don't understand why people rave about this place - it is strongly disappointing. I can't wait for another taco company or truck to come out with real Mexican food, fresh ingredients, and actual tacos that are worth their price. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't just this location so I went to the one on Harmon across from uNLV too and it was even worse.

This location is just across the street from where I live on Eastern and is also in the same parking lot as Jamba Juice, Panda Express, and 24 Hour Fitness. I come to this location more often now then before because of the location and it's very convenient for me to just walk a few minutes and get some food fast. 

I always order the chicken tacos (in my opinion, some of the best chicken tacos I've ever had!), and have at times ordered the Carna Asada Burrito or the Carna Asada fries. Both are also very good. Food always comes out quickly. Never have waited more then 5-8 minutes for an order, which is always a big plus++.

Cons for this location:
1. They could make sure the salsa bar is always stocked, especially during rush hours.
2. Drink/Ice machine needs to be always filled as well.

I give them 5 stars regardless if they got my order wrong, they did slightly over charge me for a bogus rolled taco deal, almost skimped me of my LARGE side of crema (sour cream) I ordered.. and had to ask them for  little sandwich bags so I can munch on jalapenos, and carrots while I waited for my order. WHO GIVES A F $%&!?. Your here because your drunk, its a weekend.. you're not working out tomorrow.. the hottie you were working all night at the club,  left with some other person that probably wasn't even close to being as hot as you... and all you can think about is wrapping your alcohol absorbed lips around some legit, lard made tortillas, some carne asada pappas, and an extra order of anything on the menu to bring home to gorge on in the afternoon while suffering from your hangover. I mean!?... come on! You're most likely to wake up a couple hours after your binge, and puking your 15 bucks of great Mexican fast food ANYWAY. This place not only deserves 5 stars, but 5 GOLD stars for sobering my a$$ up enough to get me home.",EILVLAwEPdGAV_ZC0edtgA,0,0,5,Q_Ds6Ok87oZqBtf0qz9Mmg
4710296,2016-02-14,1,H2Chxto2e6dHTDJ8-s3-pQ,Food was cold and they took 20 minutes to make. I ordered a burrito which was priced at 5.65. After tax i checked my statement and they charged my card 10$! I guess the workers think they can add their own personal tips. Very dishonest workers. Pay cash and double check what they are charging you if you are going to come here. PS Not sure what i just ate but looked like a fingernail and pubes. I did not know they had pubes and fingernails on menu. Maybe that's why they over charged me??,4aqZDbqAdNSeg8uUnBB8zg,1,0,1,j5p26ADeBWX8CHq5ihVcZw
4765204,2011-05-11,2,H2Chxto2e6dHTDJ8-s3-pQ,"Don't get me wrong about this... The food is decent. I've had better from places like El Patio Mexico etc. My boyfriend and I also made a comment that we feel the need to get a Hepatitis test after eating here.

My main issues with this place are:
A) Dirty dirty dirty. I should have checked around inside before I ordered.
B) Soda machine only worked half the time we were there
C) You do not need to drown everything in guacamole. Guac should ALWAYS be on the side... not the main ingredient in a torta or yucking up half the nachos. 
D) Please get some staff that understand English. Blahblah, I understand this place is a Mexican fast food joint, but when I have to repeat myself a half dozen times to get the order right, only to find guac on everything despite me saying NO to it, I do get rather annoyed. 

If they fixed these few things up, they'd be a really great place. Until then, there are much better Mexican joints around.",mySDXsBhY3u0yI-G2oVDkA,0,0,2,cRApl6JEDGLLQoQNY8x3_w

Compared to other places I wouldn't buy them here again. Many places are offering with better tasting meat. The asada was so bland here that I felt bad I wasted my lunch coming here.
I placed an order so I wouldn't waste much of my lunch waiting for them to make my food. When I showed up, they started making it! No point of ordering over the phone then, that's what cost them a star.
The salsas were good, better than the meat. I had to drown my fries to get a good taste. All in all this place is starting to disappoint, and with more competition around. Will not be coming back here again.",uYCjMIWMjb1mE1SzMaBXFQ,0,0,2,_HpAoQP_5XobJN_WKOwpSQ

The ingredients always taste fresh, delicious. Awesome soda fountain with unlimited refills of all the typical sodas, sweet and unsweet teas, JUICES and HORCHATA'S! (that alone is almost worth it!) 

And no where else in Vegas will you find such a delicious and large sized Machaca Torta (Shredded beef, egg and onion sandwich on fresh baked bread) for only $4.00! Half of it is a meal!

I go there all the time after a late night work out at 24hr fitness. Love it. People are very particular about their Mexican food, but these people are a class act, and the service alone is worth it. 

I'm not a fan of Ranchero or loud music either, but they play the CLASSIEST, most pleasant Mexican music from the 40's 50's and 60's at a low, pleasant volume. The ambiance is great too! And unlike a lot of other 24hr taquerias, they always have nice, spacious tables to sit in 24/7.
