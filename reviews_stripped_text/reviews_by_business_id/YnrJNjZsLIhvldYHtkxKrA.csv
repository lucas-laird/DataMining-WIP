Large selection of rolls, sashimi, the usual.  All-you-can-eat  includes kitchen items such as teriyaki chicken, tempura, and green tea ice cream for dessert.  What I liked most is the ability to order half rolls with the all-you-can-eat.  This was great the first couple times when I wanted to try out many rolls without getting stuck with one I didn't like.

Cons
Living in Calfornia, the fish in vegas is not nearly as fresh and a little grainy.  Service was ok.  Usually they are not busy, so it isn't a hassle getting service from either the bar or the dining room, but during busy times, don't bother sitting in the dining room for all you can eat, or else expect to wait 20-30 minutes between orders.",yHC44VPkBH1OGt9ZSBZjUw,0,0,3,SI-3VvX1rNZJTLsdwZWTaA

254809,2011-09-21,1,YnrJNjZsLIhvldYHtkxKrA,"A laid back, low key sushi restaurant.  Best for all you can eat, particularly if you are a roll fan.  Personally, I am.  Yeah, rolls might not be ""true sushi.""  I know that, but for some of us, that's what we like.  If so, you're going to love Sushi Factory.  Personally I think the best aspect is that it is the only AYCE place I have found in town that doesn't have a time limit.

As for service, most times I've been (and I've been a ton!), it's fine.  If it wasn't, why would I go back?  But yes, if it's busy it can get a little slow, service wise.  Again, however, if you are there for AYCE, there is no time limit.  And most times my hubby and I go with a group of friends so we like to take 2 hours and sit and talk.  And we do that whether the service is fast or slow, the time we take is up to us.

The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is the decor, tables and chairs.  Really, Sushi Factory?  You can't invest in some matching seating, new tables, and updated decor?  Please try.  I think more people would give you a chance.",sUN0W4KhYvHE3TGNd6cGGA,4,2,4,IVdt9l991tbBPmJa4nf0Ew

not enough options as far as rolls go.

1.  First impressions - The decor is a little bizarre and is a thrown together mish mash of old pizza parlour and 60's diner.
2.  Service - Slowwwww.  In defense of the poor young waiter that was attempting to do his best, they were understaffed and we were told that there was only one sushi chef (the owner) in the kitchen.
3.  Food Appearance - Lacking to the point of being ""iffy"".  The nigiri fish to rice ratio was skimpy and cut uneven.  Even the rolls were haphazard and thrown on the plate.
4.  Food Taste - Average to scary.  The rice for the nigiri disintegrated when you attempted to pick it up.  Some of the fish was barely cool to room temp.  A simple rainbow roll was bleh.  DON'T get the Japanese Lasagna as its a glop on tinfoil.

A group of five of us went for dinner tonight and ordered the all-you-can-eat sushi.  As we were seated, our waitress mentioned something about it being $10.95 per person.

Even the $25 per person price is reasonable, considering there is no time limit annnnd the menu includes ALL specialty rolls, sides, etc.  

So, we ordered specialty roll after specialty roll...all quite delicious!  The staff was very attentive and did not hesitate to continue to bring us more rolls in a timely fashion.

At the end of the evening, they brought us our bill and a couple people in the party thought there had been a mistake because it was so cheap....and the waiter told us that they were having a special tonight...all-you-can-eat....$10.95 per person....really!  He said they were offering it at their Henderson location tomorrow (11/29/11) and, for those people who came in tonight or tomorrow, they would be sending another offer for the end of December for another AYCE special!

I can't give half a star so one star will be my rating. Here, let me tell you why. I'll take a different approach and make a list just in case an employee there reads this and decides to help the restaurant out.

1) Service with a smile:  It only takes 1 bad seed to ruin the whole crop. I've been here a few times because my friends enjoy this place (?), but the service here just doesn't fit any other sushi restaurant I've EVER been to. It says ""60 minute limit"" on their menu. They really must stick to the T on this one because after 60 minutes, they just ignore you and forget what you ordered.

2) Flava-flaaaav!:  Hit or miss when it comes to the freshness of their fish.  Sometimes it's on, sometimes it's off.  Whenever I ordered my AYCE anywhere else, I get half orders (4 pieces instead of 8) just because I want to taste everything.  It's a recession, but it ain't worth giving someone the stomach flu or worst!

3) HGTV: Watch it! Give the place a face lift with some paint or decorations. Some traditional Japanese lamps are always decorative. When my friends and I eat here, we're like 20 deep. We get the tables in the middle of restaurant put together and they're uneven and we're on display for everyone to see. I'm charging for pictures next time.

Hope this helps everyone. This isn't a review to knock the place but to give it some constructive criticism because face it. This is Las Vegas and everyone deserves good food with good service. We live in a DESERT, people! ;) Happy eating!",bTTZzC8RvTxTOeGMvJ5icQ,3,1,1,1TlCJcXVxd86-q0fQdg27g

It started off as one of my favorite sushi joints in town until I noticed the customer service was not on the level as I remembered it to be.  The food was also not that great either, where they piled on rice and cream cheese into each roll! So, if I was a yelper back then, I would have given this place a solid 2!

AFTER a year or so, I decided to go back to see if there had been any change.  When I walked in, I noticed the place had been painted, and was definitely much better looking than I can remember.  I did AYCE, and as much as I love sushi, I don't know how  to use chopsticks (Yes, sad story. haha). So, I always ask for a fork =). The server came running back with my fork like he was some sort of knight-in-shining-armor, which is a good sign for me, because everyone usually forgets my darn fork =(.

So the food came, and I noticed a definite change, it has become even better than I can remember! The service was also wonderful. The servers were much more observant of their customer's needs, and they were just adorable! 

*NOTE: Another thing I remember is that they have a Ladie's Night Special on Wednesdays, where AYCE dinner is the lunch price! Take advantage ladies! And another good thing is they are open late! I think til 3am? (I'll have to update the times and specials as soon as I go back)",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,13,13,4,rpI6thMzXrZwQRUAl6Z39Q

It comes out to less than $30 p/p after all is said and done with taxes and a drink so it's easy to bring a large group. Sushi tastes fresh to me, not sure why it's been getting such bad reviews on that.. The only thing if I were to be picky is that the servers could have a little more personality. Also, the last time they made a big deal about the bill because they forgot to charge for one ice tea. So as we were paying, they were in a frantic to correct it and left with the bill without taking our money and when they returned they said it was a new bill because they had forgotten the iced tea. One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that. There was not even an extra line on the credit card slip for a tip. We will probably continue to return if we have a large party in the future. Seems hard to get seated in Vegas at a lot of restaurants if you're in a large party. But not this place. Always seems empty for some reason.",Jh7_umH5RiAVNet_8yvpfw,0,0,4,OUbVHxa1nSfXj5MGzYfT7Q

More tailored for people that cringe at seeing raw fish on a slab of rice. So I'm not ranking the rolls. Sushi was fresh though. The sushi chef we had was very personable. The other chefs seemed way less personable. Not unfriendly but kind of stoic. It doesn't bother me though cause I'm just there to eat. 

Interior is pretty drab. Could be updated but i it's okay if they're making money. No sense make things extravagant.

One of the waiters seemed disinterested in serving us but later on we had a very cheerful waitress.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I thought the food was fresh and nicely prepared with decent portions. Again just sushi and at the counter. Also,  I'm not comparing this to high end Vegas strip sushi or top notch Japan places I've been to.

Our chef was cool and very quick.  Behind him was a wall of business cards that kept my attention for the remainder of the dinner I did manage to eat.

My boyfriend had the all-you-can-eat sushi.  I had the beef and chicken teriyaki (as I do not eat anything that lives in the water except seaweed).  My meal came with miso soup and a small salad.  The miso soup was pretty tasty!  And the small salad very basic but had an excellent ginger dressing atop of it.  My entree looked really good when our waitress served it but, as I began to eat it, it was full of fat (both on the chicken and the beef).  I guess that would be okay if I liked gristle and fat but, I hate the chewy stuff--it makes me want to puke.  I probably ate 2% of my meal, not including the rice.  My boyfriend ate most of his rolls but later commented to me that he didn't think the ingredients were very fresh.

This was the best sushi place, when we first started coming here (I would say a year or so ago), but I've noticed a steady decline in service. Last night, our waitress took our order, then I think I spotted her twice in the restaurant the rest of the night. Some other waiters took turns serving us, but they did so sporadically and half the time forgot things. Our first order of sushi came out really quickly, but from then on,  the orders came so slow, we thought the waiter had forgotten to put in the last one and we were about to leave without having it (with all-you-can-eat, it wouldn't have affected our bill anyways).
The sushi on the other hand, is still excellent! In fact, last night it was the owner himself making the sushi and it was mmm, mmm, good. :)
They have great specials, which vary by day of the week, but I'm bored with their roll menu. It seems like too many rolls are repeated, only with a different fish or sauce on top. There could be more creativity/variety there.",I9e80hahLUuqyvM0ft3EdA,1,1,3,D1ojeIF6A9BVbXUgQoI8fQ

3406826,2011-05-11,2,YnrJNjZsLIhvldYHtkxKrA,"AYCE Sushi Joints have become so commonplace in Vegas that non-AYCE places are marketing their exclusivity.  Sushi Factory, spawned from the ""Sushi On"" folks who first hit Vegas with the most commonly-implemented concept, made-to-order AYCE (versus pre-made and laid out).

Every time we have some major physical labor (moving an office, hauling off trucks to auction, etc), we use it as an excuse to head over to Sushi Factory.

The appetizer/non-sushi selection is more than sufficient for your scaredycat friends who eat one california roll and one order of tuna.  The list of house special rolls is massive and largely descriptive (they do mix in a few ""trust me""s.  Trust them.)

I have visited Sushi Factory around 15-20 times since moving to Vegas and have NEVER had a problem with the fish.  On a Sunday morning at 1AM it's still good.  If you're an AYCE nut, you can handle the rest, as long as the fish is good and the rice is at least decent (Theirs is sticky, not too moist or dense, and always good to the bite). 

Speaking of 1AM, I love Sushi Factory for this most of all.  At 1AM, my friends visiting from the East Coast start quizzing me on what fast food joints are open this late and can they still order a pizza or something.  I ask what they really want, one says ""I REALLY want Sushi, but it's way too late"".  Sushi Factory helps me keep the Vegas cred high: ""Guys, you've really forgotten where you are.  You want Sushi at one in the morning, Vegas will make you Sushi at one in the morning!""

Service used to be the ""decent"" you could expect from most AYCE sushi in town.  On our most recent vists, the service has shown signs of improving further.  We never had empty glasses (as common as it is cruel at AYCE), you always felt like multiple people were looking out for you (floor manager is now present regularly, likely facilitating these improvements), and the chefs themselves are a riot, keeping the conversation going between themselves and the guests without ever feeling forced.

I was happy with the sushi, but disappointed in the tempura .. i like my tempura CRISPY, not SOGGY. But the taste of it was still koo .. i picked at some chicken teriyaki from my homie's plate and i couldn't complain cuz the chicken was tender ... from the sushi menu i ordered the ""Joe the Man"", the ""Bank Roll"", the ""Spider Roll"" and we hopped on some Yellowtail (Hamachi) Sashimi .. all well deserving of 4 stars .. but yeah, the rating went down to 3 stars cuz of the tempura .. 

I also ordered the Gyoza, which was fried and not oily and also not skimpy (some places don't have too much meat in their gyoza or it's greasy) .. i also got some edamame. The veggie tempura i ordered  .... well .. i was disappointed from the selection .. potato, yam, and eggplant. I was looking for a broccoli .. a carrot .. maybe a string bean .. but i got the boring ones .. i'm assuming cuz it was part of the all-you-can-eat sushi menu, so they gave us the veggies not too many people look for? lol .. i dunno .. the special plate for $7.95 had a california roll, shrimp/veggie tempura and another entree of your choice. It came on a big plate and wasn't bad at all for $8. i'd cop that if i wasn't in the mood for sushi (but that's rare..) .. .the dressing on the salad is kinda odd for me, but my best friend told me it was a ginger vinaigrette and that explained everything (i'm not fond of ginger..) .. 

one thing i did like was that they'll customize orders with no complaints .. a fried Philly Crunch roll tastes better than the regular Philly Crunch roll .. and im allergic to Avocado, so i'm glad they kept it outta my sushi =) they also paid attention to us, making sure we didn't need anything else and constantly refilled the water (w/ lemon, that was a plus for me) ..

As far as menu is concerned, Sushi Factory was pretty spot on. We went for lunch so there was a few things they didn't offer for their lunch menu, like otoro. But then they didn't offer hirame (halibut) at all. That was the very first indiscretion. 

The only thing that pissed me off after that was the service. I understand that sushi chefs traditionally have a shogun (aloof) attitude, but these sushi dudes had straight up bad bedside manner. They were slow and forgot orders. Our waitress was polite, but she never refiled my green tea. 

I suppose we were the forgotten ones because we were the first to sit at the sushi bar, while all other guests sat at tables. The sushi bar is isolated from the rest of the dining area, which I would think makes for bad restaurant feng shui.

Nigiri: 0/5 I hate when I go places and they give me a chunk of rice and a super thin slice of fish. The portions are so off here, the reason why sushi restaurants pack on the rice is to clearly fill you up so you don't get to fully use their all you can eat.

Rolls: 2/5  I usually don't order rolls but my boyfriend does, they have a pretty good amount of variety on their menu but nothing really screams ""OMG I have to try this"" and once again they packed their rolls with a lot of rice.

I did the AYCE with my date. He was all hype about liking sushi though, he wouldn't even touch the sashimi I ordered, but instead insisted on all the fried little concoctions. One of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it. Date didn't seem to care, but I was a little peeved.

Thank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with. I think this soothed the bad experience. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a decent little place, I just don't think I'll be going back considering there are much better places in the valley to get AYCE sushi.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,0,2,SYeVfVYPEXCISvK6U8mdrg

My buddy recommended this spot and raved about how their Cajun Sushi and Soft Shell Crab were to die for.  Heck, we were starving so we saved time and made the call instantly..

We arrived at noon and it was empty, which was good because we were starving.. Just make sure to get the AYCE deal because otherwise, you'd be a fool to hate to lose out on their large selection of sushi rolls, hand rolls, sushi, sides, and appetizers available.

Of all the rolls we ordered (too many to remember), my favorite was the Tiger Roll.  The cajun sushi really was as good as my friend said it would be.  Beware of the Soft Shell Crab roll because it is a large serving (I recommend ordering just one of these to make room for other selections).

Overall, the quality of the sushi was ok but definitely worth the money paid.  Not sure how it is when busy but I'm lucky we didn't have to wait in line or anything.",YNhG4eGMB2sgbTBr22eIZA,1,1,3,cTpvzOdSZT3EqUrMWB3lVg
4544259,2012-09-20,2,YnrJNjZsLIhvldYHtkxKrA,"WORST SERVICE!!
Not exaggerating, I've never waited so long for food in my life.. 
(&STILL DIDN'T GET ANY FOOD!!)

I would rate the food, but I never got to it with their slow service!
They had an NFL promotion going on and with any promotion, they should be well staffed.. especially on the last day of the promotion during dinner time! Well they had 2 chefs last night. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, last day of an AYCE $12.50 promotion during dinner time and you have two chefs working? AYCE sushi during dinner always have more than 2 chefs, promotion or not.
(AND THEY DIDNT EVEN HAVE TV's. NFL PROMOTION WITH NO NFL?)

So I called in and asked how long the wait would be for a table of 9, he said about 40 mins. 

1) When I walked in, there wasn't even a host stand. I had to stand in the walk way (in an unorganized manner bc some people are just standing around waiting) and eventually a waiter walked up and asked random people if they have been put on a list.

2) The hosts waiting list was on little sheets of loose leaf paper. No not a notebook or even one large sheet of paper, it was a couple pieces of loose leaf paper! As he scrambled through them to tell anxious customers how far along they were on the waiting list, I know he messed up the order of the list. THERE WAS NO ORGANIZATION, just a couple pieces of paper with your name scribbled on it. No number on it, it didn't have any order besides the organization of the space between each of his fingers.

3) He said my wait was about an hour, I figured it was fine to wait. It's cheap, my whole family was there already (including my parents that we had to beg to come out since they don't like to eat out- POOR THEM FOR THIS BAD EXPERIENCE. Now they definitely won't go out for sushi ever again), and others that came before me were leaving, so I figured it wouldn't take an hour. 

4) OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER, he apologized and said we are next.. but they are just waiting for one of the big tables to leave (they only had three). We asked if we could be seated separately but he said the chefs can't handle another set of large orders, that's why we have to wait for a big table. Surprised, I just let it go. He then sat others that came in after us.. more than one table. WAIT doesn't 1+1=2?! HELLO THE ORDER OF TWO SMALL TABLES WOULD EQUAL TO ONE LARGE TABLE IDIOT!!!!

After experiencing that, we decided it would be best to leave because if we ever got seated, it would about another two hours until we got all of our food. At that point my parents had enough and just went back home with an empty stomach (across town 40 mins away!) The rest of us decided to go up the street to Buffet Asia (our waiter was so sweet we tipped her extra and she was extra kind about that as well). At that moment I realized I rather receive great service with okay food than bad service with any food.

5) That was the cheapest looking sushi place I have ever been to. Ugly wall colors and decor. Cheap cheap cheap tables and chairs.. just like what you would expect from a vietnamese restaurant, except sometimes vietnamese restaurants use table cloths!

If I knew that was how it was gonna go down, I wouldn't even have tried- totally not worth the $12.50 or even if it was cheaper!!

I hardly ever post on here, I know sometimes people/places have ""bad days"" but this was BADBADBAD that I would hate for anyone else to experience what we went though last night.",zuucdcmEAvJsw_n8MZWtFA,3,0,1,WqnDgyW3pLXUyWPTSWxYow

Make sure you ask them to cook the head, it comes out with a tempura batter but is really crispy and sweet - superb.  The fish is fresh and sweet with no fish odor.

The quality of the food is really good.  It's less expensive than most of the other sushi places in Vegas.  Takashi is the owner, and he is a super nice and good guy.  If you let him know what you like, he'll whip up a really nice selection for you.

If you like simple rolls, this place is perfect.  The all-you-can-eat is good, but you can definitely get full on a-la-carte.  The cajun tuna is exceptional.  Just order simple rolls: if you go crazy with designer rolls it might hurt your pocket book.

Takashi is familiar with gluten free needs.  Bring your wheat-free tamari if you wanna go gluten free, but if you forget, just get some spicy mayo or regular mayo to dip your sushi.  Of course, GF'ers should avoid the tempura, and all other sauces, including the ginger dressing.  The miso is also gluten free.

In all, the best value for sushi in Vegas, by far.  Would be 5 stars if the table service was good.",UJAsDuKc4X99ukdK9X5Epw,0,0,4,H6Zlb94aui-9qLfCOYtNyg
4772481,2012-09-14,0,YnrJNjZsLIhvldYHtkxKrA,"Been coming here for years with my parents and family and enjoyed the dinner specials and rolls and eventually started coming with my friends. The rolls have always been so-so but over the past 5-6 years I'd have to say the service has deteriorated.

Four of my friends and I came to take advantage of a $12.50 AYCE special they were having. And you get what you pay for. First thing that I noticed as I walked in was the industrial blower fan that was serving as the air conditioner for the dining room. It was situated right by our table and directly behind me so it was hard to miss. Service started off with a bang. I arrived a little late and was told that our waitress was completely ignoring one of my friends as she tried repeatedly to order water. I ordered her water with my sprite which they were surprisingly out of. Another friend tried to order a Sapporo which they were also out of. We both settled for flat cokes.

Now to the food: we ordered 2-3 rolls/dishes each which for 5 people is a good amount. Our poke salads and miso soups came quickly enough (nothing to rave about btw). And we sat back and waited for the rest of our rolls.........and waited...........and waited. I figured I give them the benefit of the doubt and that since we had a large order, it would take a little longer. Wishful thinking, I know. About 30 minutes after not receiving anything, we asked about our orders. Our waitress said she would check and never returned. 15 minutes later we asked another waitress who told us that she would go check. She later returned with our order slip and tells us that our rolls were made by the chefs and already given to us. On our table was 4 empty plates of poke salad and 2 empty bowls of miso soup. I pointed that out to her and still she insisted that we received all our rolls. It was AYCE, mind you, and if they already made it once, what's the problem with making it again? Finally she took our order slip back to the chefs. It was an hour after we sat down that our rolls began coming out but it was as if the waitresses were holding a grudge against our table. They would drop off rolls without telling us what kind of roll it was and a lot of the time didn't know. Our cokes were refilled with more flat coke. Very, very frustrating. I later found out that another one on my friends was there the same night and rolls that they didn't order were being delivered to their table. Were they our rolls?? Maybe.....scratch that.....VERY LIKELY as the restaurant was less than half full that night. Like I said the rolls were so-so as always. The fish to rice ratio favors the rice.

After the night we had, I doubt I'll be coming back again. It's a shame because their prices are very reasonable and I'd been a customer for a while. But for $12.50 AYCE we really did get what we paid for.",n6tUb9_xVtLgQ3pfuNBVLQ,3,0,1,0GSH_BALPMpaPvtQN4Kqgg

Never been here because I assumed this place wouldn't be that great and damn was I right! 

The rolls were okay BUT when I ordered the eel nigiri, it was the absolute WORSE eel I've ever had! Disgusting!!! First of all, it took over 30 minutes for me to even get it and when I did get it, it was dark as hell and overcooked to a point where some parts were CRUNCHY and the eel itself was supposed to be soft and flavorful but it wasn't any of that either. SUCH a disappointment. 

The service was okay. A bit slow but I blame the sushi chefs for that. The chefs' sushi making seemed very inexperienced. The rice seemed like it all falling off. Ugh. 
Overall, I will not be coming back.

So I ordered for myself, thinking to start slow with what I can handle- 1 roll and nigiri and a tempura. Others followed suit with their orders- some not holding restraint on their orders and most are ""roll happy"". So rolls started to come out....I found mine and happily ate it...then more rolls and more rolls that everyone else ordered. A few nigiri made it, but none were the pieces I ordered....only the basic, tuna, salmon etc someone else ordered...maybe 12 pieces and thats all we saw the whole night. So many rolls kept rolling in...so many in  fact that we had to cancel anything else we ordered to get through rolls on our table. A few we couldnt even figure out who the hell ordered it...if any of us ordered it at all!  I had to help everyone else eat their rolls so we dont get charged a la carte. I dont like rainbow rolls- I did not come to eat california roll with some fish on top! There was too much rice to me in the rolls, hence stuffing us all up.  I did not like how they did not pace us or bring each person what they ordered like other AYCE's do. I had no problem at places like Sushi Mon serving us as individuals in a group..and I like that when you order nigiri first then thats what you'll get...they dont ""forget"" the order and skip to the rolls. 

The server didnt look too happy with us too and was crabby serving us- this time I can't blame them. Normally me and my brother had to speak/apologize for the group. Mind you they dont know how to shut up most of them....they're so loud the deaf can hear it...but also we've never had ALL the loud ones in a group dinner with us...it was the complete symphony of cackling gays.  Kinda embarrassing and I apologize if you were there on a night a party of 12 gays were there with me and had to hear their bullshit. If I was any of you, I woulda slapped all of us. 

It was just not a pleasant night at all and though my friends are asses, if the staff served like other AYCE's did we wouldnt have had problems with being roll overwhelmed. 

I still cant get near anything with crab or I gag and this was months ago.

When my brother in law introduced me to this place over five years ago and it was fanastic!  The sushi nirigi had small balls of rice and was mostly fish.  There are a lot of choices, they had specials, i.e. ladies night, free Asahi, etc.  What's changed?  A few things:

1.  They now charge for green tea when it was free before, and to add insult to injury, they didn't tell me about it till the bill came!  Good thing I was on a business trip and was able to charge it to my trip expenses.  Being such a tightwad, it didn't matter if it was on mine or the company's dime.

2.  The quality of the fish has gone down a bit and also, they added more rice and not as much fish.  I think this is probably some cost cutting moves here.

Generally a good experience. My family ate here twice when we spent the holidays in Vegas. First night (Christmas night) our waiter seemed very new. Took our sushi order once and then never returned to see if we wanted anything else. We literally had to stop him and ask him if we could order again, and he seemed surprised. WTF? This is all you can eat sushi, babe. And we're Japanese. We needs more food mmkay? He got confused by our order and screwed up w/ the chef, so we ended up not receiving some of our food, but some of the other waiters (and I think owner) stepped in and we got everything we wanted and more. We were more than satisfied with our meal, so I really can't complain. PLUS, it was Christmas night. We'll let that one slide. 

Second visit (12/29) we went for lunch so it was empty. Our waitress was quick and attentive. We ordered about 16 orders of hamachi (and ate it all) before we were told that it was now ""unavailable."" Then we saw a table near us receive a few orders of hamachi so we were thinking they were trying to screw us out of what we wanted. Ordered more hamachi with another waiter and it was available again. Interesting! But all in all, another good meal.

Sushi Factory is located in a plain and slightly seedy looking strip mall. Being from the East Coast, I know that most good restaurants are not in the best of neighborhoods, so I was excited...Decor was also run down, but not terrible inside. It was tacky a bit dirty, but definitely inviting in a ""homey"" type of way.

Service was average. We had to ask our waitress quite a few times to refill my water, but she always obliged and often walked by and never disappeared. Her attitude was rather aloof, but she ""blessed"" us with her smile a couple of times, so average rating she gets.

We ordered some nigiri, sashimi and fresh oysters. I wasn't in a mood (for once) to eat a lot :). Fresh oysters were, how do I say this?, pretty fresh. I didn't expect for these to be good, but they were. Not the best I've had by any means, but definitely tasty. Sushi was edible and tasty as well, however, fish was not the freshest and presentation was rather poor. Miso soup and salad were the best part of the meal, and had very good flavor to them. Prices were incredibly cheap for a sushi place.

Overall, I may come back to Sushi Factory, but only because my best friend lives across the street.

Cons: Service is slow for sit down in the dining room, the sushi chef ""shogun"" attitude is a little over the top (or some chefs just don't make things personalized with their customers?), waitresses have forgotten items twice before.

I've been going to SF since 2006. A couple years back when I first started going the service wasn't as slow in the dining room as it is now, and from what others have said, if you come in hungry wanting to hit plates back to back, sitting at the bar is your best bet for quick service.

SF would have so much potential if some of the chefs eased up a little on the ""shogun"" attitude & if there was better service. I've had waitresses forget appetizers twice before, or have forgotten and realized their mistake, which made us wait even longer to get our items. 

Takashi is the owner & is such a great guy to speak with! Takashi & some of the chefs that have been around SF for awhile are the ones who are most likely to speak casually to customers, but otherwise these new people they've hired over the years could use some work with customer service.

I really hate to give SF three stars because the quality/pricing really is a great deal for a sushi joint in Vegas (and the owner is an unbelievably nice guy), but I really do hope these guys realize there needs to be a little more work with their chefs/waitresses when it comes to service!",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,0,3,cSmfl10iaEoFfb2z22jRYQ
5801121,2009-03-18,0,YnrJNjZsLIhvldYHtkxKrA,"Is this even sushi? I went there since my friend at work raved about how good their sushi is. I thought this place was probably the worst sushi I have had in a long time. The prices were pretty high and their food quality is sub par at best. I had their all you can eat dinner special at $24.95. I had their paradise roll, mountain roll and daves roll. I wasn't that bad but I definitely had way better. If these were their best rolls then I have to say I will not be back there ever again. The only good thing about their sushi is that they don't give you a ton of rice with their nigiri, however, their fish quality is horrid compared to other all you can eat places. Their tuna nigiri was warm and pink!? I thought that was really weird. I don't like this place. They really need a make over and a design consultant to revamp this sad restaurant. It is a waste of time and money. Do not go here.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,1,0,2,XVqtEfCJ6sZ7Uk6lHHXr7w

We Walked in n the decor was cool n the scenery look comfortable n inviting. So the lady greeted us n asked if we would like a table or sit @ the sushi bar, so we decided on the bar. So we walked over n 2 chiefs were busy on their sides n that left us with an older sushi chief with nobody on his side so we sat down and ordered. The ladies who served our drinks n brought out other dishes were very good in service n friendly. So Long story short, sushi took Forever to make, sushi was okay, sushi chief really was slow, ladies service was good. Wife got sick later that night n we will Not be Going Back at all.",29DWe8SD_RCeZ_A6ihxnhQ,3,0,1,0yqqCqILgxEY7QFKekfEBQ

We were contemplating on trying a new place or going to the old faithful sushi factory in which we were familiar with. I said sushi factory it is as I was not in the mood to try a new place and run a chance of it sucking, I just wanted what I knew and fast! 

We go here for the AYCE yes the all you can eat sushi. They have good rolls and a nice generous selection of options.

I tend to order half rolls so I can try many, that is not a problem. 

You go here for the food, to eat and get your fill of sushi. Not for the service, the guys behind the bar making your rolls are attentive however not friendly and they never smile or talk to you other than the ""thank you"" as you are almost out of the door. 

I had my friends to shoot the shit with but I could not stop looking at and staring in amazement at the permanent frowns on the sushi guys faces. It is just odd, I have never seen anything like it before. 

We always sit at the bar so we can freely order without having to wait for a waiter or waitress to take our orders in the dining area they have as well. 

The best quality sushi? NO

Can you get stuffed silly? YES

AYCE? YES

Friendly and inviting atmosphere? NO",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,2,1,3,B0yyAfM-mUNTcxwcgJ_E0A
