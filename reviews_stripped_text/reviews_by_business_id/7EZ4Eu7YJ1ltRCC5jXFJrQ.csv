11876,2017-04-20,0,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,Well can't complain to much I got buy one get one free for dinner in other words don't waste 32 bucks each person so not worth it... I seen some of the reviews and I was like let me give it a try next time I'll just go by the reviews...they have like 3 different lines when ur standing for food one is a pasta station the other is a protien station and the other is bbq and Asian food so it was confusing at first but I got the hang of it. The best thing there is the mocha ice coffee it really is. I wouldn't recommend this place go somewhere else like the mgm buffet that one is the best,aTQs0i04nu4QUKNDJdG5MA,1,0,1,QJACnvS0FFgEuWu3WxM-pg

14253,2016-01-02,0,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"Okay, the only reason I tried the buffet at Treasure Island was because when I paid for my vacation package with Hotwire, it included 2 free buffets.  After seeing the dinner food selection then tasted the food I wished they never gave me the free buffets and just credit me the equivalent of $30+ for dinner per person value instead.  Food selection was horrible with 5 small food stations with terrible selection.  The only seafood was what Treasure Island calls ""Sushi Bar"".  The fish was so thinly sliced and felt like rubber - tasteless.  They had a German theme that night and all it was hot dog wieners, sauerkraut and something that said schnitzel that tasted more like cardboard - one bite I spat it out.  The only place lined up was the BBQ bar and that too was quite awful this side of Texas & Memphis.  Tasteless ribs that the meat had to be pried from the bone (caveman style) rather than fall off the bone.  Only their prime rib was so-so that actually was cooked to medium rare, however the flavor needs further improvements.

So they have a pasta station with some cooks making simple dishes like ravioli, linguine dishes and so on that they expect tips when they make it.  Seriously?  I already paid over $30 for this retched food and they want more of my money??  They have an Asian section (see above about Sushi).  By far their attempt on Asian food was a disgrace even compared to frozen box supermarket pre-made spring rolls and terrible noodles and rice.  Then there is their attempt on Vietnamese food - they made the absolute most horrid PHO Noodles on the planet.  It was so bad, I would not even call it generic beef noodle soup!  Please whatever you do, don't try this buffet unless you want to experience diarrhea... which was what I experienced 15 min after leaving the buffet.   I have to say that the only saving face with this buffet was the desert bar.  But even that is just average.",rjFHzln1LNxfgGUoPd4jCA,0,0,1,ljY0q8MGaHAb4i05rmM2ng

The chefs create made to order salads which a smile and are attentive to what I want in the salad. 
The BBQ was a favorite for my husband and the sushi didn't taste as fresh as other restaurants but it tasted good. 
I loved the Orange Chicken as it was crispy and wasn't full of fatty pieces. 
The Dessert! Oh the Dessert!!! Amazing!!! They were not buffet style...they were boutique bakery style desserts! Wow! I would come just for dessert. And they have sugar free options too!!

When I think of Buffet food, I think of food that has been sitting there for awhile that is luke warm. The food here is fresh and some made to order (pasta, sushi, asian soup). I have to say my favorites were the pasta bar and the asian food. They had great items for kids too, like burgers, pizza, mac/cheese, spaghetti, etc. 

But, save room for the dessert section of this buffet!!! It is FANTASTIC! Some items that were there were: specialty cupcakes, creme brule, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, cream puffs, eau claires, ice cream, cotton candy (kids favorite), and pies.....just to name a few!!! 

The service was only OK. We had to actually search for our waitress the first night to get a refill on our pops. The plates piled up on our table for most the meal. For what you pay, the service of the wait staff could definitely be much better!

The prices for adults weren't terrible at $23.95 for supper, but kids who are 10 or older are considered an adult. I personally believe that a 10 year old should not eat as much as an adult or be encouraged to eat that much. Anyways the other kids were $15.95 for supper(still a bit pricey for kids, in my opinion). If you are staying at TI, make sure to use the 2 for 1 coupon that comes with your room coupons. The prices for breakfast and lunch were a little cheaper. We only ate here at supper time.",S0ud8fCZpx13srSNzNEW-Q,1,0,4,j0iUegdiWsmWZZWLUebuag

There was no wait, and the price is inexpensive.  They also offer Children price so it was helpful.  There was no expensive or fancy stuff at the Buffet - just pasta, pizza, ice cream, and different types of BBQs.  For all meat lovers (like me), the different types of BBQs (like pulled pork, ribs, smoked meats, etc) were just great, with different types of BBQ sauce.  The BBQ meats were all juicy and flavorful.  I don't really miss prime ribs when I get to chow on mountains of delicious BBQ pork.  They also had cotton candy - great for my daughter.  There weren't any fancy desserts, but ice cream and whatever other cakes they had were good enough for us.
The service was also friendly.

We decided to try it because we had the 2 for 1 coupon from the hotel, against my better judgement after checking yelp. The place was clean and simply decorated so we felt comfortable. The first problem was that there was a long hair in the tongs to get pulled pork, when my husband told the person behind the counter he just smiled and said ""ok."" We tried a little bit of everything from the BBQ section, we got slices from the pizza station, and salads from the salad station. All of the meat was dry and visibly old. You could tell it had been sitting for an extended period of time. The pizza tasted worse than Chuck E. Cheese, and the Cesar salad dressing was salty and tasted horribly. The dessert was ok. We had some cookies and sweets and they weren't bad. Another thing that I didn't like is that I heard the waiter in our section speaking very rudely to tourists who didn't know much English, which I find extremely offensive. We were so annoyed and disappointed with the experience that went to complain but there was already someone complaining and yelling not at the manager that we didn't want to wait.

Arrived at 5:30 pm and it took around 75 mins to get in and seated.

First and foremost, 5 stars for our server Rod.  Great guy!  Friendly personality and very prompt and attentive service.  And with a smile, too.  Don't know how much truth there is into this, but it seemed like he enjoyed his job.

I let it go since I had a feeling she was going to give me the stink eye if I'd said something to her ~_O

The dessert bar was also delicious.  Chocolate dipped strawberries, Creme brûlée, mini donuts, fruit tarts and more. 

Other than that, the rest of the buffet was not that great.  Skip the BBQ- it doesn't taste like good southern pit BBQ (odd flavor). The prime rib was dry and tough. The Asian was just ok.

Our waitress was great, but the food sucked - sorry :-(. Mostly Chinese fast-food type (and I'm Chinese..wanted to try something more 'American') so a lot of the food looked like Panda Express.

Salads/pastas can be intimidating because you literally have to choose your own ingredients to make your own salad/pasta. This is good and bad. Considering it's a buffet, it usually is better to showcase appealing (or at least try to) pre-made food. It's bad for those who don't know what the heck to put and I just decided to mix in all the ingredients together. BAD choice.  My parents don't speak English so it was very hard for them to order any salad/pastas. Wish it was in a 'bar' instead. 

The only beef there was pre-sliced beef! Buffets in Vegas are known for their beef tripe or whatever where the 'chef' stands there and slices it for you. The turkey was already pre-sliced too. :-(

The crab legs are ok - had better ones elsewhere and they were too salty - maybe it is to hide the 'freshness' of the crab legs?

The only good meat were the pork ribs and bbq sauce - tender and yummy!!

The mini donuts were cute! But they were stale :-(.  Desert area was also lacking.

My wife and I were having a great day in Vegas today.  We were suckered though into a ""deal"" to eat at TI, saving approx 15 bucks.  Good deal?  We think not.  My wife got the hummus, some of the other Greek items, shrimp and a couple of fruit tarts.  When we left we ended up having to rush into a taxi because my wife started feling ill (we had planned on walking back to our hotel).  When we arrived at the hotel, my wife had to rush back to our room and spent the next hour or so throwing up.  We are pretty sure it was the shrimp.  She was feeling GREAT before eating here, so we're positive something was wrong with the food. I called the mgr, who politely told me that he didn't think it could be food poisoning because food poisoning doesn't set in an hour after eating bad food.  He said we could file a report, but we didn't want to waste anymore time on this place.

Please be careful what you eat if you eat here.  Some of the food looked like it had been out for a while.  The salads are pretty good and the desserts are so-so.  Overall though, in hindsight, it was a really bad idea.  My wife's stomach is still hurting her pretty bad right now (6 hours later).  I'm going to try and get a refund tomorrow.  If my wife is still sick tomorrow I guess we'll file a report.  I really hope we can just forget about TI though.  They've wasted enough of our time already on this trip.

This is my first review on yelp.  Sorry to start off as such a complainer, but I really felt it was necessary to get the word out on this place.",YOMSi6edV4kRb0U5lLGtfQ,5,0,1,t8SvIhUniZjs-fIYCYTffg

I ate their pho soup which tasted just as good as the soup at their viatnamese diner, and also had some of their BBQ.  Everything was good, but not great, and was really only worth it for the 2 for 1 deal.  The dessert was actually pretty awesome and the chocolate dipped macaroons were incredible.

Go here if you have the 2 for 1 deal and want a decent selection of OK food while in Vegas as it will boil down to roughly 10 bucks a person.  Other wise stay away as the total won't be worth it.

1106190,2010-08-22,1,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"I'd give 0 star if I could... The only reason I considered this buffet was because I was supposed to receive a complimentary 2-for-1 dinner voucher for the buffet with our hotel reservation.  Upon check in, we did not receive any of our coupons or promotions, or even reminded of any. 

When we arrived at the buffet, we realized that we were supposed to receive a coupon. I spoke with the Manager of the buffet to see if he would allow us, all they had to do was just receive confirmation through telephone by calling the lobby.  The manager did not even seem to be the least bit interested in even talking to us. Sure enough, he did not even hesitate to tell us ""No, I'm the manager of the buffet, I'm not in charge of coupons.. go to the front desk."" So he wanted us to go walk back to the lobby of the casino just to get some coupons that he should be able to validate with a simple phone call? ""Yes.."". 

To make this short.. not worth getting into specifics.. we had received a dinner coupon voucher (needed lunch coupon voucher) at the lobby front desk. We figured its about 15 minutes until dinner (it was 3:45, dinner starts at 4), even that incompetent manager shouldn't have a problem with this. Just let us pay for the dinner price, which was in 15 minutes, DURING lunch. WRONG! 

When the manager returned, (looked like he didn't want to talk to us) we told him our situation again. Before I finished a sentence the manager said.. ""We don't do this normally, but I don't want to deal with this anymore... since the front desk can't get it right go in.. I'll just wait until dinner time to charge you."" Never again.. 


This is NOT a reflection of the hotel room or the servers at the buffet.
I just wish that the MANAGER would have given us better service than what we received, which was close to nothing.",EGqfcPLxX-e6mN5fi0GIPg,0,0,1,kBufGjfJu-cPM-CwcUcjjA
1117201,2014-09-28,0,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"I was there for dinner on a Thursday night. This was the blandest, most boring food I've had in Las Vegas. Seriously, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. And the line and the grill station was ridiculous. It should have been a sign to the management that they needed to add another line for the food, or increase the staffing. We're talking about food that is already cooked and portioned, so there should be very little time spent getting it. But it was the only part of the place with any line, other than the line to get in. I ended up giving into hunger and went to the pasta line instead and had pasta primavera. But it was terrible. it was oily and flavorless. It had literally four pieces of vegetables in it. And I saw him prepare it for me. Yet by the time I got back to the table it was already cold. How is this possible? Cold plate, very briefly cooked food. 

There was no sour cream at the potato station. Ask for it and someone will carry a blob of it on a spoon from the kitchen. The salad bar requires you to ask someone to scoop the ingredients onto a small plate. The result is unappetizing. All the ingredient bins were picked over and the quantities given were miniscule. The resulting salad was terrible. And they were not very friendly. And no, I was not complaining or being difficult. They were just flat and unresponsive people.

On the upside, I did not get food poisoning, which is the only reason it gets two stars and not one. I recommend going the food courts over this dreck.

The one positive thing I have to say about the experience is that our server was friendly and pleasant. But everyone else was misery.

One of my favorite things at the buffet was the pho station. I must have eaten 5 bowls of pho over my trip there. The BBQ station was excellent, with super tender ribs and and great potatoes. Their dessert station had all the regular standards like mousse and flan, but I particularly enjoyed the cotton candy and the chocolate covered strawberries.

FOOD - nothing really jumped out at you. Cold sushi rolls. Best part might be the made-to-order pasta option. Can't comment on much else because nothing left an impression.

Otherwise, don't bother at all if no voucher, not really worth the $25.

Towards the left, there was a tiny ""seafood"" section where they had about 3 different sushi rolls, and some cold mixed salads.  Moving over, there's an assortment of ""asian food"" (fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, orange chicken), a soup bar (pho, dumpling soup), bbq (+ your standard mac and cheese, mash potatoes kinda sides).

There's also a dessert table of some cakes and pastries along with chocolate covered strawberries at corner right.  If you've been to a Hometown Buffet in California, it's pretty much like that.

A crepe station is something I would have been all over.

I skipped the pasta and pizza section for fear of getting full from carbs and focused mainly on the BBQ and meats section, which I think is definitely worth the visit. No one ventured near the salad station, but judging by the looks of the salad ingredients, everything looks fresh and crisp. Strangely, the snow crab legs area was very empty, but good for me, so I can indulge in them myself  :)  The dessert display is small and quaint, but all the desserts were very good and worth a second trip.

I liked the barbecue varieties, but the Cajun food I tried was kinda gross.  So were the ""Chef's Specialty"" barbecue chicken wings (very dry and obviously sitting under heat lamps for a long time).  Dessert kinda saved the day, but it wasn't enough for me to cheer about.

2004: Rainforest Cafe, San Francisco, CA (food so overpriced and terrible that I can't even remember what I ate)
2005: my roommate's family's house, Salinas, CA (spent eating Filipino food on a Saturday, since for some reason they don't celebrate the holiday on the actual day)
2006: Todai, Las Vegas, NV (Japanese buffet at the now extinct Aladdin Hotel, overthrown by Planet Hollywood)
2007: Buffet at Treasure Island, Las Vegas, NV

At first glance, my list makes it seem as if it's been years since I've had a REAL Thanksgiving. Au contraire, this year was as genuine a holiday as ever--surrounded by family, endless rows of food, endless outlet stores on Black Friday, endless betting tables and slots, endless nightlife possibilities... 

Seriously, how much more thankful could you be!!

Not to mention, the Buffet at T.I. had an impressive authentic Thanksgiving dinner spread that Thursday evening. I had the teensiest slices of turkey and ham, and the ittiest bit of mashed potatoes. The rest of my plate went to sushi, crab legs and dessert (including a pumpkin donut... was too full for pie).

If you're staying at the hotel, the buffet is worth checking out. It seemed pretty clean, semi-new, and ok-pleasant (in that brightly lit, gluttonous sort of way).  At $30 a pop, I thought it could have been a little less expensive, especially after we ate at Carnival World Buffet at Rio, a buffet that's 10 times bigger and more popular, for only $22 each. However, this could have been the jacked price just for Thanksgiving. I'm not sure.

Btw, I really am not as thankful for gambling as I made it sound. I actually don't even like gambling. However, FOOD... oh yes. I am thankful. And thankful for the buffet for making food very abundant and accessible.

I really liked their food selections and the variety that was offered.  They had a made to order pasta bar that was my favorite of all the buffet pasta bars.  The flavors were fresh and the pasta wasn't oily.  I would recommend a mixed sauce of marinara and alfredo with the pasta of your choice and chicken and veggies tossed in!  They offered a good mix of recognizable American Chinese dishes (like orange chicken & spring rolls) as well as some more authentic Chinese fare, like beef tendon soup.  Even my husband's Chinese family was pleasantly surprised with the more traditional Chinese dishes.  The sushi was fresh and some of the best offered at a buffet. There is an extensive made to order salad bar for those who want to add a healthier course to their buffet experience, as well as delicious comfort foods like tender ribs, mashed potatoes, and mac & cheese.  The dessert buffet was wonderful and don't miss the fresh donuts!  I had to go back for seconds.  There is even some whimsy with freshly spun cotton candy.  

It is a very modern clean restaurant that feels more like an bright but upscale restaurant than a hotel meeting space (which described several of the buffets we ate at.)  I think that it was recently renovated.  The restroom is located outside the restaurant in the casino, which was less than convenient, but otherwise, I really enjoyed both the food and atmosphere of the TI Buffet!  I would highly recommend this buffet and wished we had eaten there earlier in the week...I would have been tempted to return during our stay.",SLYPATpTNlaa2LeSMANb9Q,0,0,4,_sVGPRSTWpXKEhlyesTbJQ

For that reason I didn't even try them. My stepdaughter said the shrimp was good. The only bright spot I found in the whole place was the Asian stir fry had good flavor.

The pulled pork and chicken were all soggy and drenched in BBQ sauce. The beans were canned. And I hate when salad bars don't let you make the salad, they make it for you.

+1 star for the omelet bar. That was the only food that was actually pretty decent. The quality of the eggs and other ingredients was just about as great as what you would get at a typical breakfast place. It didn't make that much of a difference just because you're in a casino buffet.

-2 stars because there wasn't else much that was really appetizing. There wasn't much taste to the bacon or the powdered eggs. I tried so hard to enjoy the eggs benedict, but the bread was too stale.

I came here on a Saturday Night after an exhausting day at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The BFF and I didn't want to spend too much money on a buffet (Wynn) since she was tight on money so we went here instead. $26.95 for Saturday Night Buffet Dinner, which wasn't too bad.. I still thought it was a little pricey for the cost but I didn't mind too much. ($30 including tax)

We were just looking for a place that offered Prime Rib and Crab Legs and here the Treasure Island Buffet had it!

Prime Rib here was not bad at all, very delicious with a heaping spoonful of mashed potatoes and meat juice. I was looking for vegetables (Steamed or grilled) but they didn't have any at all :(. And this is where Wynn wins. But I was able to grab some broccoli from the Chinese Beef and Broccoli to save my meal. MMMMMM :)

I really hate salty crab legs, but the crab legs here weren't too salty. And simply awesome with MELTED BUTTER AND LEMON!! OH, my butter!!! These crab legs weren't the best, but who cares, all you can eat crab legs, why not.

They have a pasta bar, so I was able to fulfill my teeny pasta craving with Fettucine Alfredo with Shrimp and Mushrooms. You can taste the garlic!! I LOVE GARLIC! MMMM!!

Dessert selections totally beat Wynn's Buffet though. They have chocolate strawberries, cotton candy, MINI DONUTS!!!, baby pies, creme brulee that was sooooo creamy and not runny. UGH!!! So good.

The gentleman working the pasta buffet when I was there was very talented and whipped me up a tasty seafood ravioli dish and made sure I even got fresh bread on the side.  

I did really enjoy the dessert table.  Everything I got was tasty--and I got a LOT of dessert!  I had to grab a thing of cotton candy because it would make a cute picture (think of me how you wish, but what is more adorable than a cotton candy selfie?!).

Coffee was decent. Meats were very tough. Even to cut with a knife. I would have given 2 stars but my server was attentive enough and I'm smart enough to avoid the questionable items. My dining experience was not terrible. The food is not terrible. Take very small portions to figure out what's good and bad would be my advice. Since I'm a very small eater paying $35 for a plate of mediocre food doesn't justify 4-5 starts. If you have a hearty appetite and like cheap champagne and mimosa then you are safe!,_Q6rOLuD05yr7aPZ1dbOTw,0,0,3,trbNLt7NIAbc55gCG0nokg

I understand that buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, so I would think that the casinos would up their game to draw diners into their buffets.  But it would appear that the opposite is happening.  I don't know if it's a numbers game, with the sheer volume of visitors guaranteeing these buffets patronage out of convenience.  Or if, the quality of buffet food is what it is, so they just roll with it.   My hopes are still up for the next one later this week.

As for Treasure Island's ""seafood buffet""...uh what?  What seafood?  Crab legs, cold & pre-split.  Vegas, STOP DOING THAT!  Leave the crab legs whole!  Shrimp, cold and deveined, and void of flavor.  As for the rest of the seafood selections...a couple of fish options (both dry) and a sushi station, which was a joke.

The rest of the buffet was very pedestrian, with typical choices.  Prime rib, pre-sliced (why?!!!!) was salty and lacking any richness.  Korean short ribs, were not even close.  Various starches of mediocrity to help fill the void.

The self serve drink station would have been the highlight of the buffet, had the ice tea not tasted like it was brewed in sink water.

1 star, only because I paid for this food, even though I'm kicking myself for it.  By the way, we went to Pink's later and got a hot dog...thank God.",XFJGvgnSuQOSs1aPO9Oqsg,0,0,1,lR-qVgxdnMmXt_cKyLwhig

The Buffet at TI is on the smaller side, but it does not disappoint. I believe the quality is MUCH higher than at most buffets that have such a large selection. There really wasn't anything I didn't like, and that's huge considering we came at the end of breakfast while they replaced some items for lunch (so we had really old breakfast food, and some fresh lunch food). 

The chinese dishes are a little better quality here than at most places, and so is the pizza. I enjoyed all of the breakfast items, except they have flimsy bacon - otherwise, everything is good.

I also believe its a cheaper buffet, considering. You can find a coupon online that gives you $5 off I believe. The biggest perk about this place is that it's very quiet and not too many people come here. So the atmosphere is excellent and not many lines for food.

Another perk: self serve drinks. Yep. Oh and btw, they have freezers (like icees or slushies - strawberry banana, other fruit flavors, coffe and chocolate flavors too!). Dessert is EXCELLENT here, though I was full before we got to breakfast so I didn't have much of it.

At $35 a person this isn't a value play but isn't a rip off either. 

I've been to many buffets in Vegas some good some bad and this one isn't bad.

Service was excellent from the cashier and host to the chef and server.

Tyler was very courteous and hard working. 

The dining area is spacious and very clean. 
Now to food. 

The selection is small but decent. I'd rather enjoy a few good options instead of many terrible tasting options! Am I right!? 

The prime rib was on point. I like how the carving station is available for you to choose whether or not to get a pre sliced service or to wait for the carver to do his or her thing. 

The peel shrimp, though small compared to what I've been used to consuming was fresh and tasty.

The dun-genus crab legs come pre sliced or pre cracked you can choose legs or claws.  They were tasty and quickly replenished when low.

I didn't try any of the other stations aside from the dessert and it was good. What I liked was that they used Dreyer's! There was mini churros and mini donuts as well as chocolate covered strawberries. I didn't see a chocolate fountain so I'm curious if these were brought it. Still good though.

 Now to the drinks... 

Whatever your heart desires, they've got it. From iced coffee, juice and sodas. For those of you who don't like soda, they also have several carbonated and flavored drinks which I appreciated.

Yeah, I can't say much because I'm basically giving them 4 stars for the prime rib. Oh! The crab was better than I expected, it wasn't too salty unlike other buffets I have tried. They had a good selection of desserts like cotton candy, chocolate puff thingies, a variety of ice cream, crembule (not sure how to spell that), fruit chocolate tarts, and a lot more! I was getting too excited at the moment because I just wanted to indulge myself with chocolate and sweets. Although T.I. isn't well known as Bellagio's buffet, I came out actually being pretty satisfied and content with the food there.. but that's only because I went for their prime rib. I'm sure other resorts especially Bellagio has an awesome buffet as I recall they have a better selection of food.",0nZE-lIbYwPFcIHuBUkFWA,2,2,4,q9ITI_OXzS4LZBY0l3fuHw

As far as mid-to-low priced buffets go, TI's is pretty good. They had a good selection of food. You had your 'Asian' section, 'American' section, 'Italian' section and 'Salad' section. I kind of felt they were missing a 'TexMex'-type station, but ultimately I wasn't missing it all that much. In particular I appreciated that the salad station would custom-make salads for you - that was a bit of a nice touch.

Everything I put on my plate during 'Round 1' I enjoyed. During 'Round 2,' I picked out a few things I didn't know if I'd like, but more-or-less just wanted to 'sample' and as I recall, everything during 'Round 2' was so-so. I don't know if I can fault the food so much as me being somewhat full by then and having already eaten the things I REALLY liked already. Nothing tasted old or reheated though. It was all pretty fresh and tasty.

But the winner WAS the dessert section. Talk about selection!! By the time I got over there, I kind of wish I'd STARTED with dessert, cause there was so much to choose from - cupcakes, pies, cookies, ice cream, tarts, puddings, creme puffs, chocolate-covered strawberries, cotton candy even!! My friends and I all got several and sampled one another's items, just to get a taste of as much as possible. THE WINNER WAS THE CREME BRULEE! It was DELICIOUS!!!

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",qGd2RE6PHowdDeskkkprlQ,5,1,2,e-um087kh4W_h7ktM5SsAg

{Notes/Tips}

- I enjoyed their breakfast more than their lunch.
- We arrived for lunch at around 12:00 pm, and there was a small line. About a 10 min wait. 
- I was more impressed with their dessert layout versus their other menu items.
- Some of the items in the buffet looked like leftovers. 
- If you want something more fresh, hit the Salad and Pasta stations. 
- A good way to save some money on their dinner buffet is to arrive 30-40 mins prior to end of their Lunch or Champagne Brunch. Pay Lunch/Brunch prices and wait for the dinner buffet.

2572436,2012-06-24,0,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"Pretty decent food - more towards the american menu. 

They do have a simple japanese sushi spread, not that fantastic. Oriental spread - pretty ok. American spread and italian spread(with pizzas and pastas) make up the bulk of their menu. 

Salad spread is good though, with different types of salads to choose and the buffet lady would start mixing the different greens together.

Drinks are free (any type), except the alcoholic ones.

Overall, I would give this a 6/10, definitely tasted way way better buffets than these, but it deserves the thumbs up for the price I paid for it and for the spread it serves.

Tip: One way to get really good and economical value buffets is to head to tix4dinner.com and get a buffet discount coupon. You pay 2 dollars and you get 25% or something like off your dinner buffet. Might be even more.

Once again, it isnt that fantastic but if you're on a budget, this should be more than sufficient!

Chicken Fried Steak was so hard, we can't even saw it apart with the knife.

No Fried Chicken.

Brocoli beef  - beef was like leather
Orange Chicken - Chicken is like leftover, dried, hard and doughy
Sushi  - my son's said his college Sushi was better.

Mexican section - 
Foods look so bad (dried), none of my family even try.

Italian section - 
Lobster Ravioli - had a bite of my wife's three Ravioli, the sauce was decent, but where is the lobster.

Salad and dessert were the only good sections which the reason why I gave it a one star.

I don't like the tiny plates at each of the stations and the absence of a self-serve salad bar. T.I. is clearly trying to present a ""high end"" buffet with the smaller plates but ultimately detracts from the whole purpose of buffet: getting lots of different food all at once. At least that's how I like my buffet. 

Aside from the presentation of the buffet here, the food itself was not very good. The prime rib was flavorless, the salad that I requested, a spinach salad, was blah. The mac and cheese was a half step up from Kraft. The sushi really killed me: the station had a selection of maybe two or three pieces of different sushi on each plate so you are stuck taking the combinations they have created for you.  And the sushi wasn't even very good! Mushy rice, bland fish. The crab legs and shrimp were ok and tasted pretty fresh.

Price vs. Quantity: 5
Food Taste: 5

This is hands down my favorite buffet in Las Vegas. The quality of the food here is at the top while the price for the buffet is lower than the other popular resort buffets. There isn't as much selection, but I think the quality makes up for that. Even the dining area looks pretty upscale for a buffet.

I've eaten here for brunch and for Christmas Eve dinner. All of the breakfast items were great that I had. The scrambled eggs were cooked well (not dry or runny), the waffles were fluffy, the bacon was PERFECT, and even the breakfast sausage was good. I'm noticing that a lot of the buffets give really fatty and greasy breakfast sausages which is a huge put off. They had biscuits and gravy as well which was pretty darn tasty.

The Chinese food selection is probably the best quality of all the buffet places I've been to. It actually tastes like you went to *insert your favorite Chinese restaurant here* instead of cheap and fatty quality that you get at other buffets. Their pizza is single handedly the best pizza from any of the buffets I've eaten at. The quality was so good that if it was a pizza place I might have considered ordering delivery from it. The cheese was melty, crust was flavorful, and it wasn't dried out.

Now on to my favorite part. The freaking turkey dinner. Oh. My. God. That turkey was the juiciest turkey I had ever eaten. I mean seriously it just fell apart in your mouth because it was so tender and it dripped with the amazing turkey juice. Pair that with their perfectly moist and tasty stuffing, some cranberry sauce, and mashed potatoes. It tasted like I was eating a home cooked turkey dinner. This was on Christmas Eve, mind you, so I hope the quality isn't drastically different on a normal day, but I had 2.5 plates of this because it was so good.

A huge draw for me is that they have an entire self serve drink area. Their pepsi machines let you choose a basic drink (say regular pepsi) and then you can pour the flavor in MANUALLY. Meaning if you want vanilla pepsi, you pour the pepsi in the cup and then you actually pour the vanilla syrup (as much as you want) into the regular pepsi. First time I've ever seen this. They have several frozen drinks, some fruit flavored and others coffee flavored. They also have a whole machine devoted to uniquely flavored ice teas and other sodas.

The dessert section is very appealing to look at but it's probably the weakest thing here. Everything LOOKS tasty, and don't get me wrong it's not bad, but it all tastes the same. They are very heavy handed with the sugar so everything is hyper sweet causing it all to blend together if you try multiple things. They have basic dessert items, nothing unusual/unique like Bacchanal or Wynn.",uwavnlkvnttiDEbrNXYgvA,2,0,5,oJnFIfpc6vBYnlfV5kEpvw

Another really good thing about this place is that their salad is really good. The service isn't too bad from what I can remember. XD",hgtKEqVXwG1fgTXe8Lvq3g,0,0,3,r3TyucnPPpj5RiwqaTO7XA

The desserts were awesome! Loved the creme brulee, NY cheesecake, chocolate-covered strawberries, red valet cupcake. Everything was delicious. Wish I had more room for desserts!

On our last day, we decided to try out The Buffet. Being guests at the hotel, you receive a 2-for-1 coupon Monday-Friday for the buffet. With the coupon, we paid $20 for two people however without the coupon, it's $18-20 per person for breakfast or lunch.

For being a buffet in Vegas, in a major hotel/resort, I was expecting so much more. Yes, they had a pretty good selection of foods, from American to International, but I feel like they didn't go the extra mile like other buffets would.

The boy and I were immediately drawn to the BBQ station, we had:
-Pulled Pork
-Cornbread
-Biscuits
-Mashed Potatoes
-Macaroni & Cheese
-BBQ Chicken

Our favorites were the pulled pork, BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cornbread. Both the pulled pork and chicken had great sauces and were both sweet and spicy. The mashed potatoes were good, really fluffy. Cornbread was sweet and moist, I was so happy that it wasn't dry! The macaroni & cheese wasn't that great to me, maybe it was the type of cheese that was used, but it came across as more of macaroni in a cheese sauce than a more traditional macaroni & cheese. 

Overall, I think this is a great option if you are staying at Treasure Island, especially during the week so you can use the coupon. However, with more high-end buffets on The Strip and with the other delicious options in the hotel itself, this just wasn't too memorable.",3HHLpfU7q4HoREEOXtt7pw,1,0,3,YlOFwY9ZEdoQfEwK0y8GTQ

I've been here before and decided to drop in again this past weekend b/c of a 2 for 1 coupon I got with my room. We came in for dinner so maybe thats why everything tasted bad....or maybe its actually bad...

Overall selection of food was pretty limited.

The Sushi:
The rice was old. I mean there was no other way to say it. It was not fresh rice.
If I make rice at home and 4 days later I unplug the rice cooker and leave the lid all the way open for 24 hours because i'm dumb like that, then slap a piece of fish on that crusty left-over rice and put it in the fridge for 2 hours to make it extra cold, then I'll have the same kind of sushi as I had at TI. It was bad.

The sea food was ok I guess. None of it tasted really fresh and it was all heavily seasoned/baked/slathered with stuff.

The crab legs were decent.

The potatoes tasted like they had been sitting out there for quite a while.

I couldn't bring myself to eat the dessert afterwards but the comments from the rest of the table were less than positive.

I'm not a buffet hater since I do go to buffets occasionally, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.

Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.

First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup.

chicken-fried steak - YEAH.
flank steak - YEAH.
make your own tacos - YEAH.
tortilla soup - YEAH.
sweet mashed potatoes - YEAH.

I won't give it 5 stars because the staff was initially very rude to us. we had some friends who were supposed to come join us later, bringing our crew from 6 to 9 or 10, and they UTTERLY REFUSED to clear aside an adjacent table for our additional comrades, saying something about ""stations"" not being open. by ""stations"" I think they meant tables.

there were maybe ten tables occupied in the whole restaurant, so that is about 20% occupancy.

... if it was your first time in Vegas and I took you to the TI Buffet to break your Sin City buffet cherry. Unfortunately, that exactly is what happened this Vegas visit so I am a horrible friend! :D

Even if this buffet is free, I still would advise you to stay away unless you're looking for a quick snack or itchin' for a sweet tooth fixin'. The food ranges from passable to gag-worthy. There were no crab legs in the seafood section, and my smoked-salmon fanatic friend shunned theirs (how do you mess that up?). The Noodle Bar was actually passable, but the pho had this super dark brown soup that tasted like watered-down soy sauce.  The Eggs Benedict had a overly sour hollandaise sauce. *shuddergag*

You're mostly safe in the dessert arena (I wolfed down two creme crème brûlées after being let down by most of the savory foods), but stay away from the bitter-berries. Other safe options include: bacon, country fried potatoes, and breakfast steak... if you're lucky! 

The breakfast steak is a great way to test if Lady Luck is smiling upon you. Whereas my friend's steak had a pink and cold center (comes from not letting the meat defrost fully before throwing it on the grill). Mine was over cooked and had the texture of a jerky. Yes. I considered myself lucky.    

Two stars because the service was actually decent for a large party and also if someone handed me a free voucher, I'd still go in for the crème brûlée ;)

TLDR: I wouldn't bring my second-worst enemy to this buffet. Worst, maybe. Not second worst.",j0nQQCvXEW3uG5N67vV8yA,0,0,2,FiWo72n7hEl6bl0FR56LVQ

3273974,2010-01-16,1,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"Oh, T.I.  You should be ASHAMED to even call this a ""Buffet.""

We got comped, so we checked it out, and decided ""What the heck.""  Unfortunately, we'd checked it out at late breakfast time, and actually did the whole ""Eating"" part at dinner.  Breakfast, if small in selection, at least looked decent.  Dinner?

Oh.  Em.  Gee.

First of all, I really hope EVERY person (all 6 of them) at the buffet that evening were also Comped. Because seriously?  If I'd paid $22 for that ""Selection"" of foods, I'd be calling the Better Business Bureau and reporting fraud.

Ok, so: The decor is contemporary. It looks chic.  

That's where it ends. Let's take the tour:

Sushi ""Bar"": Actually a mostly-empty shelf with saran-wrapped platters of old, oxidizing nigiri behind glass next to a shelf of mini-plated with 2-3 Nigiri apiece on them. The ""Fish"" (Salmon and Tuna, presumably)  was happily decomposing...(I mean ""OXIDIZING"" but that's the first step) atop the solid riceballs. The dark coloration of the Salmon was disgusting, and I walked right past it.

Next Station: The ""Confused"" Station.  Grape Leaves, Hummus, and Olives... with Seaweed/Krab and vinegar ""Salad"" and some other randomness. Got the Grape Leaves and some Hummus. They were actually the best taste we had of the entire ""Buffet""... and they were pretty mediocre.

Then came the ""Chinese"" Station. Some LoMein, Fried Rice, ""Kung Pao"" chicken, Beef and Broccoli, Stir Fried something, and a Pho Station.  Cool... some Pho. Or not... since 3 out of the 4 bowls were non-pho soups. (WonTon, Ramen Noodle...Don't know what else...)  I got a bowl of the Beef Tendon Pho. The broth was actually decent, but there were no ""Pho-courtiments"" like basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, fish sauce...Nada. Take it as it is.  Also:  The ""Tendon"" was also Tripe. Mainly Tripe.

Sigh.

Beyond that, it was the ""BBQ"" section.  Pork Spareribs in a Pile under a Heat Lamp (really.)  Skunky Mac'N'Cheese, Undercooked Collards, Mashed Sweet Potatoes with NO flavor... and ""BBQ BEEF BRISKET.""  Which would be fine, if it were not the EXACT SAME BEEF that was labeled right next to it, in a steam pan with gravy, as ""FLANK STEAK""... AND... over in the MEXICAN Section? SAME MEAT Labeled as ""Carnitas""!!!  What. The. HELL??? There was probably more at the ""BBQ"" area but I'd moved on.  

Then there is a refrigerated salad station where they'll make you one of their pre-set ""Salads."" I had to BEG for just a couple of the Fresh Mozzarella Balls... since they were ""Locked Up"" behind the glass instead of on display so that people might actually EAT THEM. There WAS a ""Cheese Plate"" which looked like something they'd bought at Costco and set out. Charming.

I'm skipping something here, but I can't remember what. At breakfast it was the Omelette station. At Dinner, it apparently was unappetizing enough to drop from my memory. Coming up to the Pasta Prep Station. They have old, hard, cold ""Display"" plates of their offerings.  Even if I had been hungry enough (or brave enough) to want to try their ""Creations"".... those plates would have been deterrent enough.  Gross.

And last is the ""Mexican"" themed bar. ""Carnitas"" consisting of the same ""Brisket"" err... I mean ""Flank Steak""... Yeah.  And Osso Bucco... except that it was all BONES and one teeensy sliver of the Osso Bucco meat. (To it's credit, the meat was tender.)  There was also dried Mexican rice.  And some other stuff.  Again, it didn't warrant me remembering what it was.

Obviously we didn't eat much of what they had to offer.  But it was comped, so at least we'll get some coffee and desserts out of it...

Ohhh, strike that. Coffee Machine Broken. Natch.

Well.  So the desserts. Usually the desserts are the shining star of even a mediocre buffet. But I forgot:  This place can't even qualify as ""Mediocre.""  This place is downright BAD. With desserts to match.   The ""Fresh Donuts"" were... well... let's just say there was no deep-fryer in sight, and the ""Fresh"" donuts that *weren't* out for the grabbing were set on a 3-tiered plate, rotating under a HEAT LAMP.  Uh-Huh.
The cupcakes LOOKED pretty, but also LOOKED plastic... and probably tasted the same. I wouldn't know.
The Creme Brulee was caramelized on top.. sort of. I tried one... and the vanilla pudding beneath was... lacking. In flavor and texture.  I grabbed a Fruit Tart, too, and it had the same filling as the Brulee, but without the faux-caramelization.
They had a Cotton Candy machine. It was neat to look at. That's about it.
Their Ice Cream was Edy's... which is better than average as far as branded Ice Creams go, so the Man had some Dulce De Leche.

The whole experience was pretty sad.  Seriously, if I'd PAID for this junk, there would have been screaming and demanding and threatening.  There are a Gabillion Buffets in Vegas.  Don't waste your time and money at this one.  For less than HALF the price, you can hop the tram to the Mirage, and have a HUGE Corned Beef Sandwich that'll feed you for 2 days.",ox0DtIS-AzUiVeGFkIvlMQ,4,0,1,kxRlCEvYUavxBEGujo8eTw

This was horrific. I ate here because I was traveling with my boss while attending a conference in Vegas.  Let's just say she has an under-developed palette, Chinese food = orange chicken and Mexican food = cheese enchiladas.  We stayed at TI and one evening after a long day of workshops and speeches, we wanted to just get something to eat downstairs at our hotel. We wandered around surveying our options. Unfortunately, we landed here because the boss was afraid to commit to any one particular genre of food and because she was afraid of not liking her food. Since she holds the company credit, we ate here.

It was gross. See Greg O.'s review for a good description of what the food and atmosphere are like. He is spot on - tired and shriveled up are the words to best describe this place.

I don't go to Vegas often, but I've been enough to know that the only buffets here worth going to are the pricey ones. I knew by the lack of a line and the $23/person price for dinner that this was going to be bad. And it was.

Anyways, complete waste of time and food. Complete obligatory food and empty calories. Didn't look good. Didn't taste good.

Pros: offerings from allover the globe, no line, low price-point, friendly manager, dessert wasn't terrible.

Cons: food has clearly been sitting out for longer than it should, the food, bussers were a bit slow to pick up our dishes.

The ribs & the deserts were ok at best there was a hair in my Pho soup the service was horrible everyone was rude starting at the desk. It's awkward to walk in once you pay, you have to excuse yourself threw other paying customers. The woman who sat us seemed irritated upon entrance we asked for an extra chair which she replied ""Well can I give you your set ups first"" in a very snotty way then walked away. The lady's at the salad station were the only nice people there. It was very disappointing especially at 30 a person for a family of 7. I will gladly pay that price at a place with worth coming to.

But I'm not really too fussy or curious about trying out the various buffets in Vegas. Generally speaking, as long as there's meat, I'm happy. Oh.. and of course.. I love me some good eatin' competitions with my friends.  

I've given the buffet at treasure island a solid 4 stars because it's a good $15.00 cheaper than other buffets on the strip, there was no line, and the selections were comparable to other buffets. While the food itself was very average by buffet standards, their DESSERTS were EXCELLENT. Seriously, the small corner reserved for the desserts may look meager in size and selection but they tasted AMAZING even after 3 plates of meat and etc. 

In sum, I wouldn't disagree with the other reviewers who'd given the Treasure Island buffet 3 stars, but personally, the meal(s) did the job, and the desserts were a delightful find to supplement a great trip to Vegas.",llM5gQU1RgLdjQIJzYhJYw,0,0,4,cwpkiJ7lASxWNSQgfbLjWw

Not too shabby! The cheap buffets are usually the good ones huh? Or maybe I just appreciate it more because it was cheaper! 

I love the soup area! There were miso, wonton (3 pcs), shrimp with egg noodles, and even pho with 3 pieces of beef balls! The kind gentleman made my soup in less than 5 minutes! It came out piping hot! There were even fresh basil, green onion, cilantro, yellow onion, and lime! I ordered the pho & wonton. Wonton - 3 stars; it tasted like frozen wontons you get at the market. Pho - 4 stars; tasted decent, it tasted like it could have been ""instant pho""

They had a salad station! 5 stars. The gentleman that was making the salad was not wearing gloves! It disgusted me! I really wanted a salad too! But as i worked my way down the area, there was another person making salad! She wore gloves and also had a mixing bowl where she was able to mix the veggies & dressing in! Whereas the dude smashing the veggies down with the palm of his hands and pouring the dressing over and calling it a day! 

The sushi station was just sad! It didn't look fresh - 2 stars.

Chinese food area, I can't say much about since I didn't even make it to this area! Which is probably a good thing. 

The BBQ station - 4 stars. BBQ ribs were too salty. Loved the biscuits & gravy, cornbread, pulled pork and chicken fried steak! 

Desserts - 4 stars. The dessert station was on the other side of the restaurant. Weird. For a moment i really thought the only desserts they had were fruits! Luckily i walked around! There were tiny donuts! - maple with sprinkles, chocolate, powered, etc. made fresh and was very good! Also about 5 different flavors of ice cream; red velvet, chocolate, vanilla cupcakes; strawberry cheesecakes, cookies of all sorts - i was in heaven! I love desserts!

I've been to the buffet in Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, Rio, Mirage, and residential buffets. All of them have better variety, better quality.

On top of the food not being all that satisfying the cost was a little ridiculous for my taste. The lunch buffet cost $27. Which in my opinion the food wasn't that great for it to have that price! 

We were a group of 8 and they seated us literally right in front of where the buffet started. While all the others got to sit in a nice comfortable area in the middle/back of the restaurant. To top it off they don't have restrooms in there. You have to exit the restaurant in order to go to the bathroom. If you are staying in the Treasure Island Hotel and want to eat there.

By the time we got close to the cashier, he anounced it would be closing in 30 minutes. We debated but thought we could eat and be out in 30 minutes. We got in. Service was bad. The server (not sure her name but long ponytail and hefty girl) was very unfriendly. Food was dry and as it got closer to closing time they took our silverware when we went back for ""last call"". They were still sitting people up to 10 minutes before it was to close and we saw them and were like WTF, those poor people really got ripped off. Anyway I was sad it was not what it was in October.
I have been to Luxur, Excalibur and Paris Buffet too and Paris is the best I have had in LV. I have been there several times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and would highly recommend it.

3675116,2009-10-29,4,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"Lunch was the ""FAIL-BOT"". What is a ""fail-bot"", pray tell? Imagine a robot designed with the sole purpose to fail. Who would design such a robot built to never accomplish anything? I can't tell you for sure, but chances are they had a hand in my culinary experience at the Buffet at Treasure Island. 

Now let's set some ground expectations. 1.) I'm in a casino on the Vegas Strip, expect to pay through the nose for food and drinks. 2.) Buffet = Food cooked some time ago. 3.) ... I'm bored, let's move on.

There are certainly a fair share of buffets on the Las Vegas Strip that will cost you between $20-30 for lunch or dinner, they all have food out and heated, and they all come with a wide assortment of regional foods. Lucky for me this particular meal was on my boss because the food was close to appalling (and I enjoy buffets). 

The sushi had been sitting out to the point that the rice was beginning to harden. Asking the sushi station chef for a fresh plate was out of the question as the station was left unattended for the duration of my meal. OK, so sushi buffets are often a sub-par experience to sitting at sushi bar and having a chef slice and roll to your very heart's content, surely there are some other delicious items to sample? The bbq ribs were not bad and neither were the Korean short ribs. The beef brisket was tough and the accompanying bbq sauce resembled something I once dipped a Chicken McNugget into. The Asian food station was likely my greatest disappointment. Simply and seriously put, I have had higher quality food at Panda Express. Enough of the bad? I will say that the service staff was polite and attentive. At the dessert station I was greeted by a very pleasant woman named Olga, who was not only friendly, but recommended the crème brulée which left a sweet note on what was certainly a bitter dining experience.

I will admit that buffets can often be made or broken on timing, however in Las Vegas with the myriad buffets available and the $20+ /person price I was sorely left with my expectations completely unsatisfied. I expect that at that price I'm not only paying for the variety of food, but also paying for someone to keep the food fresh.

I was especially super attracted to their desserts! HUBBA HUBBA, COME TO MAMA! T.I. has the best red velvet cupcakes, great quality ice-cream (Dryers), and even Cotton Candy! They even had some really scrumptious cakes and cookies. Mmmm.... I'm drooling....

3801859,2014-01-03,0,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"Not recommended. I was visiting Vegas with my extended family, and we all wanted to go to dinner together the last night. There were three families, and we all wanted to pay separately (three bills), but sit together as a big group. We were staying at Treasure Island and we had some vouchers for the buffet, so this seemed like a good and affordable option. We had already paid this way at the Flavors buffet at Harrah's without issue.

So the lady we paid said the seating would be fine, but the hostess said no. Then she said we should talk to the manager. He told us no, they can't accommodate big parties like that, it's so busy, we would have to wait a long time, we really should just sit separately...on and on. My aunt pointed out that there were some empty tables within view, and a couple sitting nearby was finishing their dessert. Once they left, there would be 12 seats together and that would work perfectly. He was still like ""yeah, no...you would have to wait a long time...you should really just sit separately."" She explained it was our last night in town and we all wanted to be together, and he suddenly asked ""well do you want to pay the gratuity then? There's a charge for big parties."" Seriously first we had heard of this, the woman who we paid had not mentioned it.  It was clear we were getting nowhere, so finally my aunt said ""okay, we'll sit separately."" He sortof rolled his eyes and responded ""THANK you."" 

So later one of the servers explained that if we had all sat at the same table in the same section with the same server, we would be counted as one big party, and would incur the large-party gratuity (I think it was 18%). This made total sense and she explained it very nicely- the manager should maybe take some pointers from the wait staff on how to interact politely with people. We told her the manager had been a jerk, and she didn't seem too surprised.

We ended up sitting at two tables of six very near each other, which worked out okay. The food was mediocre- my ham was good but the baked chicken seemed undercooked (pinkish red tint to the drumstick?). The mini donuts were delicious, as was the creme brulee. 

The food was definitely not enough to make up for the rude manager. I will not go back.",-cvrhCPCKHUkEsDak_fY4g,0,0,2,cNezSNIWmCRR-wBWdNk5sA

I stay away from the filler carbs and go straight to the mexican, bbq, italian, and chinese food. Surprisingly the best thing here are the black pepper beef ribs. They are absolutely amazing. I've been here twice and had plate after plate of it. The pastas are good too, mix then with the brisket and ribs with tangy bbq sauce and it's great. Service is very friendly and deserves a tip as well. When you're done the dessert section is to die for. A million flavors of ice cream and yogurt, chocolate covered strawberries, it's fantastic.

3963795,2011-03-02,4,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"LET'S BE TRUTHFUL... 

Last week I decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the Strip. I booked a room at the TI and after check-in, took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering. I stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the $23 per person to get in. 

As we walked through the dining area I noticed about 18 diners in the restaurant (odd for a 7:30pm dinner I thought) who were not really eating much. Must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks... no real food. We arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said... 

""Is it just me, or does this entire place look tired?"" 

I thought to myself and replied, ""Sweetie, I don't understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top, the cold food is shriveled, and the employees are all frowning... but that doesn't effect how much fun we'll have tonight, right? After seeing her expression, I immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register. 

Notwithstanding the terrible looking food, the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a Hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else... I found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when I asked for a refund. We left, walked across the street to the Palazzo and enjoyed a great Italian dinner. 


PERSONAL NOTE TO PHIL RUFFIN, OWNER OF THE TI

I was born and raised in Las Vegas, and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel/casino. I'm proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining Las Vegas has to offer. This buffet, the air quality in the casino, the poor cleanliness of the room, (our room had burnt out light bulbs, yuck on the dresser, broken dresser drawer hanging out, and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair) and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what I envisioned any tourist should experience. When this property opened it was fantastic, enjoyable, and affordable, and most important the air was breathable. When we arrived in our room, my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her Asthma. Perhaps you'll take these recommendations to heart?

If you have a similar experience at this or any other Las Vegas property, please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game. I would be happy to stay at the TI again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review, which I would be proud to post. Until then...",fb8LhL8hF7JoaB1EnjmmPw,10,2,1,T3lZlgxUV2wyxgQ-xnGceQ

We had 2 free meals from our reservation on Vegas.com so we decided to use them on a Thursday night dinner. I didn't experience anything spectacular but I wasn't disappointed either!

Asian food: not great, don't even waste your stomach space on it... Maybe im a snobby asian, but their asian food was just below average. The eggdrop soup is okay if you want some warm comfort soup. The sushi was pretty terrible, lots of cold hard rice with a little bit of fish.
American/BBQ food: Yum, stuff the majority of your stomach with this!!! The prim ribs is actually very decent, a little too cooked for my taste but still good! The chili is yummy. The chicken isn't so great. Mashed potatoes are pretty standard. Their salads are actually really good too if you want a healthier option. They have very food dressings! 
Desserts: wait a cotton candy machine? Yeeppie. Chocolate covered strawberries and mini donuts!!!

Okay, compared to other buffet options, this place isn't the best, or the fanciest, but it's pretty damn good bang for the buck! I went here on a Sunday night, feeling kind of disappointed for letting my out of town friends pick the restaurant for dinner. However, for 24 bucks, we got a pretty decent selection of food. Absolutely no wait, clean, and pretty good service. 

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,5,4,4,9sunAQMPVWTVqnYYHnWljQ

4393577,2015-10-19,4,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"This buffet was a disappointment.  Their weekend seafood dinner prices are $31.95 per person, as of October of 2015.  Since we were staying at Treasure Island, part of their resort fees includes a 2 for 1 voucher at their buffet, so we decided to try out their buffet. 

We stopped by here around 6:30pm and there was a very long line.  Since we had a late lunch, we figured we'll come back here about 9pm, giving us an hour before they closed.

I assumed that the reason the buffet wasn't that good was that we came here at an unpopular time, which was a Sunday night with less than an hour before they closed.  The problems I had was that when we got here at 9:15pm, there was still a long line to get into the buffet.  Looking inside, there was a lot of empty available tables. Most of them were cleaned off too. The line went fairly quickly, but by the time they seated us, it was already after 9:30pm.

They did tell us that they closed at 10pm and the food will be removed by then. After we were seated, the hostess sat us at a very tiny table. There were a lot of other larger cleaned off empty tables. When we asked the hostess if we could just sit at another table.., she told us that we would have to stand in a corner and wait for another table. We had less than 30 minutes before they take the food away, so we decided to just sit at the tiny table.

When we were getting the food, you can tell that a lot of the food have been sitting out for quite a while. The prime rib were dry, the avocado were darkened, etc. They also weren't clearing the tables as frequently as it got closer to 10pm. Afterwards.., when it was 10:30pm, they told us the time and that we had to leave now. So by the time we sat down, we had less than 1 hour to eat. If we paid full price, this place would be a 1-star review.

I would image that if we came here early in the evening, the food would be better and so would their service; although I would never pay full price for this buffet. I would give this place another try with a 2 for 1 voucher, but I would come here at a better time.",dYCmh8rJl_ZkC_mt70ZDhQ,4,2,2,lgBVcCzQB0HLktZESNRhGQ

Luckily, my friends and I got 2 free vouchers for staying in the hotel so we only paid for 1 ticket, which was ~$33. The buffet is divided into different classes of cuisines around the world: seafood, Asian, Italian, American, dessert, 

The good:
pasta station-my friend's lobster ravioli was righteous
salad station-customizable salads with fancy topping options
Prime rib was very juicy and one of the tastier ones that I've had from a buffet
many tasty desserts, including bread pudding, mini donuts, cakes, ice cream, delish cream puffs and eclairs

The bad:
limited options overall, but especially at the dessert station
seafood bar was limited; crab legs/shrimp were over salted
from the looks of the menu, the Asian noodle bar is a disgrace to Asian food

While it is smaller than other buffets, and therefore offers fewer options, the selection of food and dessert is solid. I really do like the food here. This last time in particular, the service stood out for me. It was the friendliest and most attentive service I have received at any other buffet. I also loved the bottomless champagne offered with the brunch; you can order mimosas, or just order the champagne and mix your own juices (you get the non-alcoholic drinks on your own). I also loved this last time that aside from the special-order egg/omelet station, they also had a protein station, where you can create your own bowl, or have them give you one with the pre-determined ingredients. I cannot remember all of the options for the protein bowls, but here is a list of those I do: salmon, chicken, quinoa, beans, edamame, spinach, boiled egg, lettuce, field greens, etc. My boyfriend, who joined me for brunch, fell in love with the mango lasi and the bread pudding; this is saying a lot because he's Indian and has high standards for lasi drinks, and he's not a big fan of bread pudding.",HKKOdbhn4nPihy1FDfD4bg,1,2,3,bFerMThAiOuGeVZFcFBW0w

It all started with standing in line at ""TIX 4 TONIGHT"" to buy tickets for any discounted show (we had already seen O). While in line we learned that we could also buy discounts for buffets. So for $2 we bought an $4 dollar discount, netting a $2 savings (final cost was $12 per person before tax and tip, $15 with tax and tip). Not that big of a deal, but a good enough reason to pick TI over any other buffet option, as it was the only discount available for Friday lunch and stopped the decision process right there (with so many choices, and 8 people, this was a good thing). 

So how was it? Well I don't really have anything to compare it to (though later my brother and I did go take a look at the Wynn's dinner buffet. All I can say is WOW, it probably would have been worth the extra $10 per person for the lunch buffet at the Wynn). There were plenty of entrees from many different cuisines (Chinese, Japanese, BBQ, Italian, pizza, home cooking, Mexican, fish dishes, soups, salads and sides galore, as well as a very large dessert station, complete with cotton candy and a mini doughnut making machine).

Everything I sampled was OK. Other than the pot-stickers and the sushi, nothing was worth a second go, though I did eat everything I put on my plate. A few of the dishes, especially the pizza, were a bit salty, but not so bad that they could not be eaten.

Our server did a great job keeping our beverages full. I was not expecting beverages (non-alcoholic) to be included, but they were, so that was a nice surprise.

So in the end, it was an OK experience, but with so many other buffets in Vegas, TI's is not one I am likely to repeat.

The barbeque section was the only section that really looked tempting to me and that's what I filled my most of my plate with. Thankfully the meat was nicely seasoned, the mashed potatoes and baked beans were comfy and the corn bread was only slightly dry. This is what I mostly filled up on until my I stumbled upon the dessert bar.

The sushi section just looked sad. They had attempts at California and Spicy Tuna Rolls on display. They also had salmon sushi with very pale pink, dry looking, slivers of fish on top. No thank you.

We went to Wicked Spoon on a Thursday, I tried their bacon, was disappointed.

We got 2 free vouchers for free Buffet, at The Buffet in Treasure Island---
Was a bit unwillingly to go because of the reviews on Yelp,
But who was going to pass up a free buffet??

We got there around 11.
Half of the Right was Lunch, The other half Breakfast. Behind, dessert.

The Lunch area, was awesome.
There was a sushi bar, with all the condiments.
Next to it, was Chinese dishes, I really liked their shrimp dumplings,
And their Vegetable Spring Rolls were AWESOME.
Deliciously crunchy (not soggy) and fresh.

They had a customization of Chow Mein and PHO, and other noodle dishes,
Pretty cool!!
Along that was a Meat Section//Turkey Area.
**Some of the Buffets still offer Thanksgiving selections:
Turkey, Yams, Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Corn Bread, etc.

They still had an omlette station, but they were cleaning up since we were there between Breakfast and Lunch.

They were replacing the omlette station for a Pasta Station! Pretty awesome.

So the breakfast they offered was sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs,
Potatoes, pancakes, french toast, crepes, some other stuff lol.

I noticed how CRISPY the bacon looked, and just thought:
""That's how you cook bacon""
It was so delicious and crispy, not like Wicked Spoon's chewy bacon. (Don't get bacon at Wicked Spoon or the Kalbi Short Ribs)

The dessert area was super cute! I loved it.
Tiny desserts.
Cotton Candy. Mini Donuts (They have their version of blue berry donuts, it's hella good, and also Beignets!!) They had a strawberry shortcake in a cup,
Fancy Fudge, tiny fruit tarts, Dreyers Ice Cream. Different slices of Cakes.

Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.

The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.

Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great.

We enjoyed this buffet quite a bit. The food was really good and high quality, except for the prime rib which was all very well done - pity.

My husbands favorite part was the pasta bar. You choose your pasta and your sauce and they mix it all there in front of you in the little pan (with any veggies that are part of it, if any) so it is freshly put together and very tasty. He went back 3 times for different combinations and they were all good.  

They also had a salad bar where a cook puts it together for you. I was odd that you didn't do this yourself, but it had great stuff such as fresh avocado, real bacon, several fancy cheeses, etc.

The sushi was better most of the other buffets we went to. There were crab legs and shrimp. They were good, but I was bummed that the crab legs were not already cut, you had to break them open yourself.

The desserts were the best that I had at any of the buffets. We had done the 24 hour buffet of buffets previously (a good deal) and discovered that all of the Harrah's buffets had the same mediocre desserts at each.  But here they had REALLY good creme brulee, tarts, fresh made little donuts, and good ice cream. They also had the cotton candy that was popular with most of the buffets now (except I didn't have to beg for it like some of the other buffets).

In summary, other buffets did have more variety, but we like good quality. So it depends on your goal. If we had the kids with us, they would probably like a different buffet better. We would return to this one next time we are in town.",zjaIMhUwtEdNi_LsjB_JAA,1,1,4,NlhR20TgoELblxSZJEsvjA

I should've asked if we could move since hardly anyone was there at the time. To be on the safe side, ask for a table, not a booth. The desserts there aren't that good either. They're just O.K. Also, if you're in line for food, KNOW what the hell you want and not just sit there staring at the food forever. That's just so rude! My husband hates people like that so much, that he'll actually push small kids out of the way at buffets, or he'll just move in in front of them. One time he even let out a SBD fart w/o any shame since he couldn't deal with the idiots who just sit there and take forever to make up their minds. lol! He has no shame, lol! That sure cleared up the area fast, lol!

If you can't make up your damn mind, then just come back once you think you can decide what you want in less than a minute tops! One lady had to ask me to move so that she could get to the gravy at the meat station since some stupid chic was just yakking away to the person behind the counter. She either didn't care about the annoyed stares she was getting, or she didn't notice. 

I made sure she noticed how annoying she was by loudly saying to the lady next to me, sorry, but I can't move right now since that woman in front of me won't move. She didn't say anything back. I just moved as close as I could to that woman w/o touching her just so that woman could lean over and get the gravy she wanted. I hate morons like that, ugh!",irkRHMqg9oSt7lv3OSiNkA,3,2,3,S3z2sy2Wf0VuNYmoBe-Yew

OTHERWISE, SKIP IT.

if you are a guest at TI, they give you a coupon for the buffet good for M-F lunch or dinner.  lunch begins at 11am.  the cashier can start to accept coupons at 10:45am.  we got in at 10:55.

breakfast ends at 11 but if you come for the lunch buffet at the beginning, you can still get breakfast.  thought that since bfast was ending in five minutes we would be getting slim pickings..  wrong!  while waiting to get pancakes, waffles, bacon, hash browns, they restocked it.

they have several stations 1) they make your salad  2) they make omelettes

i liked the potato bar.  baked potatoes were large and cooked through.  you could add your own toppings.

other food was okay.  not bad but just mediocre.  sushi, chinese food, chicken..

don't know why dessert is on the other side.  my favorite...i mean, i love love loved this...was the mini donuts!!  usually, i don't rave about donuts but they were just perfect.  powdered donut, chocolate donut, cinnamon-sugar donut, plain donut, sprinkled donut, etc.  i had a donut feast!!!  =D

they also have ice cream, some slices of different pies, cookies, full sized cupcakes (red velvet, chocolate, etc), but one bite of a mini donut and i knew why i was returning to the dessert bar.

the tea that i requested was hot (unlike my lukewarm teapot from wicked spoon), came with lemon and honey.  iced coffee and orange juice were good too.",0qQI-n_ZfrwBewAgr1Nt8g,6,1,2,w8gXHbOlPDfeG25FAKoWuA
4889991,2010-03-31,0,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"So similar to what another reviewer wrote - my group and I ate here solely because we purchased tickets at the TIX 4 TONIGHT booth and learned that you could get a discount on the buffet.  We were going to see Mystere that night, which is also at TI and figured we would cut the traveling time by eating dinner in the same casino.  That was a great idea, although I wasn't as impressed with the buffet as I wanted to be.

First off, the line took quite awhile to get through before we even paid at the register.  Maybe that's common in LV, but it's not fun when you're hungry.

The menu posted outside the restaurant had me salivating - everything sounded so good, and so many different items to choose from!  Could I really have beef with broccoli and pizza in the same meal?  Heaven.  But the reality fell short of the menu.  Yes, there were many stations to select from (pasta, sushi, pizza, chinese, soul food, etc) but just about everything lacked a ""je ne sais quoi"" that could have left me feeling more satisfied.  For example, I got a simple shrimp pomodoro, and it was tasteless.   How can that be?  With the garlic and basil that's supposed to be in it!

The only thumbs up I can give is to the soul food station and the dessert station.  The pulled pork, mac and cheese and sweet potatoes were de-li-cious!  And the dessert station had so much to choose from, that I thought to myself ""you should have skipped dinner and gone straight to dessert - besides, you are in LV on vacation!""  :)",RMnCl0zRqoVm5EnMMTZL3Q,1,1,2,Kscp7B-DwenfzJ75YJ17dw

-the vast dessert bar including fresh made and glazed donuts, cinnamon buns, and croissants
-they have mango lassis! (So random)

The bad:
-we arrived early and the buffet was almost empty. However, the hostess had everyone wait and created a long line for no reason. We waited 30 minutes; what a waste.

As you may know, the TI is not known for its buffet. So why come here? Because it was comped, obviously. 
When we walked in, we felt totally boss having received 4 comped dinners (normally the price is $28/person). 
Now I see why they literally had to give the meals away. 
The smoked trout was extremely fishy, while the stuffed flounder was rock hard. 
The BBQ pork was extremely dry, essentially a victim of the intense heat lamps
Crab legs were present, but were not Alaskan king crab, and was dripping in water with each crack of the crab leg
Prime rib was tender, but lacking flavor
Peel and eat shrimp was ok
Average variety (Vietnamese, Chinese, BBQ, salads to order, pizza, pasta station)
It gained the second half star for the desserts. The Creme brûlée was acceptable, and the mocha-flavored ice cream was enjoyable.

They have a sushi station, an Asian station, a salad/fruit station, a pasta/pizza station, a burgers/dogs station, and a dessert station. 

I had the lo mein and eggrolls which were okay and about what you'd expect. The BBQ ribs were surprisingly good and were the main thing I ate. They weren't too fatty or tough. The pulled pork was also pretty good and had a tangy mustard style sauce with it. The salad/fruit station was the usual, but had a German potato salad with no mayo which is good for those of us who hate mayo. The burgers at the burger station looked to be the cheap frozen patties and were sitting in some sort of sauce or something so I passed on those. 

The dessert station was impressive and had apple caramel cup cakes, fresh made mini-donuts, mini peach and cherry pies, and cheesecake among other things.

Overall, this isn't the best buffet in Vegas but it isn't terrible either.

The bad:
(Total -2 stars)
Wow...where do I begin. Okay, I rarely ever eat sushi at these buffets but since they had no shrimp or crab or mussels or any other seafood during lunch time despite a $20.95 price tag, but I was desperate for anything somewhat fishy. How do I describe the rice? Let me see...a cross between spoiled pudding, 5 day old rice, and concrete grounds. I actually just took the small pieces of fish and shrimp on this sad excuse of sushi rice, ate the fish and used the rice to build a pyramid on my plate. Yes, I've eaten at AYCE sushi buffets so I don't equate them to sushi restaurants, but my goodness this was horrid. Pork ribs? Well, they display real oak wood behind the serving counter at the bbq area, but it's not oak-fired ribs. It was artificial smoke flavor...and it was putrid. Holy cow...it didn't last .5 of a millisecond in my mouth. It was that bad. How in the world can a piece of spare rib be that bad? It tasted like gasoline...and it may have been. You get the idea. Food was old (like left over from the previous day or something, not fresh). Here's the kicker: despite 2 for 1 coupons and/or 2 free buffets, the breakfast and lunch lines were very minimal. The hotel guests probably read the reviews about this buffet and stayed away. Me? I thought maybe I could save $50 by going to this buffet with the 2 free coupons and invest it elsewhere. Bad decision. The insult is they actually charge $20.95 for this buffet to those who don't have coupons. They should PAY people $20.95 for coming to eat there. I should thank my stars that I at least got fed for free BUT when you're on vacation in Vegas and you have to make meals count cuz there are only 3 meals a day you should at least enjoy your meal. This buffet was horrible, putrid, old, stanky, and absolutely insulting. A Vegas buffet shouldn't be this bad. The downtown Vegas buffets were even better than this for 1/3 the cost.

5541598,2015-04-21,3,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"Staying at TI meant that this buffet was the most easily-accessible buffet on the Strip. It didn't hurt that at check-in, we discovered that 2 free buffet passes came with our reservation. Yay! The catch was that those passes could only be used M-F, but it was all good; we went on the Friday night of our check-in. And then went back for brunch with champagne the next day.

Dinner: Since we got two free buffets, we paid for 2 more and split the cost between the 4 of us that went, and it was only $32 each, which really wasn't bad. The dinner buffet was open until 10 pm. And around 9 pm, they were still serving fresh, hot food. I tried the crab legs, pesto pizza, a little fried rice, and egg rolls. Everything was fine, not AMAZING, but not terrible either. Other choices included a BBQ station (easily the most crowded station), a made-to-order pasta station, salads, and sushi. And then of course we hit the dessert buffet, where the choices ranged from cute little donuts to creme brulee to fruit tarts to cotton candy. As the picture will show, we tried a lot of them. Everything tasted pretty good to me. I didn't try any of the eel, but my friend got a whole plate and it definitely looked good; she said it was delicious. It's not difficult to get your money's worth if you're okay with trying a little of everything. 

Brunch: Brunch was $27 and it came with bottomless champagne. Not a bad deal, considering the large variety of choices. At around 11, the Chinese food, salads, sushi, and pizza were still there, with the addition of breakfast tarts/pizzas, omelette station, crepes & blintzes, mini waffles, mini pancakes, and staples such as scrambled eggs (which looked a little runny for me..) and hash browns. What was especially exciting was that they had mango lassi (delicious) and vegetable samosas (meh, but A for effort). I had the somewhat strange but definitely delicious combo of mini waffle, blueberry crepes, bacon and macaroni & cheese (don't judge me). The desserts, while still attractive, looked pretty much exactly like the night before, and I can see why other Yelpers think they just put out leftovers. Who knows.
When I went back at around noon to see if I wanted anything else to eat, they had swapped out the breakfast-y stuff for more BBQ. Cornbread and biscuits instead of mini-waffles - no complaints about that here, but I can see how a late starter might still want breakfast at their noon brunch. 

The service at brunch was fantastic. Someone give Teresa a raise. She was excellent about bringing over coffee AND champagne for us right away, and was never stingy with her pours. We had full glasses at all times. And they weren't little flutes, I'm talking like 10 oz glasses. She was very sweet. 

Overall, I wouldn't hate coming back here, I just definitely have been to Vegas buffets with better quality food and more choices. Judging on dinner alone, A-OK. But brunch was 5-star-worthy. So the TI buffet gets a sunny Yay! from me.",xE_pQnbtMlyDtrwvyBZx7A,4,1,4,6Ot3UQN9BKacDMmW9NBsNw

I planned on eating at the Wynn for our Lunch/Dinner buffet experience and that's where I wanted to spend a lot of money at. I could see Treasure Island directly out of our hotel window so I decided to look up their buffet on Yelp and decided that would be perfect. We went at 0900 and we only had to wait in line about 15 minutes. It was Sunday so we had the Sunday Champagne Brunch which was a little more expensive than the normal weekday breakfast, but was very good. The quality of food wasn't out of this world like the Wynn's lunch, but I have a Ron Swanson love of breakfast food and you simply can't go wrong with a breakfast buffet. Pile mounds of bacon, ham, sausage, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, crepes on and repeat. The omelet station was really awesome and the lone woman working it was making 6 at a time and still made each perfectly to the guests specifications.

Given my disinterest in buffets, this one still ranks towards the bottom of buffets I've tried.  Nothing I tried was horrible per se, but it wasn't very good either.

    My son and I were excited to run over to the buffet and see what goodies we can eat. Stopped at the pasta station.... Nah. Over to the salad bar station... Nah, I want food!! Walked over to the BBQ station, they had some fried chicken, mashed potato's, rotisserie chicken, and beef ribs, which my son and I grabbed a couple each....Ehhhhhh, a little too tuff for me. We then went to the Asian food department, nothing really looked appetizing. Was I not as hungry as I thought or was the food not appealing to us? 

    I finally gave up, but my son proceeded to the dessert bar. I walked over with him to accompany him and see what else the buffet had to offer... Hmmmmm a few decent looking desserts along with some ice cream but that's pretty much it. My son ended up getting the mini donuts. I did see someone walking around with chocolate covered strawberries but I must of passed them up or they were in the middle of refilling them.

They do have crab legs, but they seem smaller and not as good, especially since we ate at the Rio Seafood Buffet the night earlier. 

Tip: You can bring a plateful of the crablegs to the Asian food area and they'll steam the crab legs for you!

Other than that, very mediocre food. So mediocre I can only remember the little crab legs. I probably won't ever eat here again, although I did eat my $20 worth. Why not splurge a bit and go for the better buffets?",-vPM7C063BZ1s5jzuCpcvQ,0,0,3,qQey0vOJUcglCRxHVfxu7A

Nothing like a strawberry shortcake parfait for breakfast! Remember to go toward the dessert area for cold cereals and fresh fruit. 

This was much more cost effective than The Coffee Shop restaurant also located inside Treasure Island. 

I would come to this buffet again if I stayed at Treasure Island agani.",AOQ0yHh-QGTX6H3bgFR16A,0,1,3,_3JlSNUvGUw5n6mMc2AhgA
5816168,2009-09-14,7,7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,"To be honest, the worst part about this buffet was the price. $22 for lunch is just ridiculous.

I dont care for champagne or Mimosas so the fact that they were included was irrelevant.

On the other hand, I was impressed with the variety of foods they actually did have.

I was feeling queasy (shocking, Vegas?) so I couldnt mentally enjoy most of what I was seeing.

My red skin mashed potatoes with turkey gravy were bomb. The actual turkey was incredible and usually turkey sucks.

The egg drop soup had the best texture but way too many peas.

I couldnt think of eating a salad but the salad station was incredible. I liked that a person assembled your salads for you so no ones dripping elbow skin on top of the bacon bits.

As far as entree foods, I thought an improvement they could make is not have as large quantities sitting out because the texture changes and then its no fun. 

The desserts were RIDICULOUS! We were seated right by them and it was torture. So many miniature desserts. It was so cool. I had a little cheesecake, a chocolate covered strawberry and a bite of mini donuts which only could have been better if they were hot.

The dudes loved the ice cream and cookies which I also couldnt stomach too much of. I did taste the ice cream and it was so super smooth and creamy. Tasted like Blue Bell.

Overall it wasnt bad. I would have been able to enjoy it a lot more if I hadnt been feeling like death. (:",bnf7t21SCFw3HWfV_soG_Q,9,9,3,mrngA_dQkGZs2EESz7BhxQ

We typically stay at TI so they give us the buffet for free. Great for free, pretty bad if you fork over any money. Nothing really stands out, a lot of the food has been sitting out so it either gets mushy or dry. All the food is heavy with sauce, cream, breading, cheese or grease. Simply put you feel pretty gross after eating here.

When I came here for the breakfast buffet, it was $25 per person. Considering the options and the quality of food, it's not worth paying full price for this buffet. 

The food was okay. Nothing amazing and nothing horrible. They had the standard: pancakes, crepes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, omelettes, bacon, etc. If you weren't feeling breakfast foods, then there was a salad bar, an Asian bar with sushi and salmon sashimi, and a dessert bar. I stuck to the typical breakfast foods. I did venture out to try some of their nigiri sushi but after one bite, I could tell it wasn't fresh. I stayed away from the sushi after that.

The dessert bar was by far my favorite. Mini donuts, chocolate croissants, ice cream, and even a cotton candy maker. I wanted some cotton candy but the chef behind the counter said he only turns that on when it's the lunch buffet. 

There was nothing impressive about this buffet but it got the job done. I left breakfast stuffed and satisfied.",ez1NI0gSXV8YTs-AZB5pDQ,1,1,3,AHq3pqEKd12KDIZZ6O45Og

The prime rib at the dinner buffet was the only good thing, the crab legs wasn't even as tasty as we would like.  On top of that, it is very difficult to get a server to help you when you needed ketchup, steak sauce, napkins & etc.  My daughter ended up not feeling well after our breakfast and dinner buffet saturday until today which is Monday.

Sushi section: Way too much rice and the fish didn't look fresh. The little sides of bean sprouts and kimchi were good though.

Meats: Um, all were dry with no flavor...they put the BBQ sauce there to make it seem less dry and to overpower everything, but it's ultimately a horrible cover up for horrible food. Only meat that was passable was the veal. Very soft and yum.

Seafood (cold): Crab legs were salty and you have to peel the shrimp yourself. 

Seafood (warm): Fish was not good at all. Dry, fishy...just bleh! Clam chowder on a plate? Not that great...fried clams were break-your-teeth hard. Rolled flounder was really weird tasting as well. I don't recommend the seafood at all. 

Desserts: Everything looked really plain. Cheesecake was ""meh."" Not much flavor or creaminess...and I love cheesecake :( Some strawberry pudding shortcake thing was not bad...fruit tart was extremely horrible. All the tarts were burnt so I just ate the fruit with some gelatin that was more hard than ""fluffy-pudding"" and slid right off the burnt pre-made tart. Ugh. Disgusting. Don't waste your time on this...

In fact, don't waste your time on this buffet, period! You could get something way better anywhere (with the exception of possibly circus circus). Just suck it up and spend maybe $5-$10 dollars more for Wynn or Aria buffet!",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,2,0,1,fSXxMW08E3PcbLpZDqvBOA

The desert bar wasn't very impressive save for 1 thing, cotton candy. I really wanted to carry it out with me, as cotton candy seems like a walking activity, but alas, no could do.

Most memorable thing was gnocchi with pesto. Pesto was super delicious and made to order.

The sushi bar is, as you would expect it. Fish is B grade at best, but wasn't horrible, on par with grocery store sushi.

Pastas: Bland. I make better pasta at home with Prego in 10 min or less.

Sushi: Didn't taste fresh

American:  
1) Mac n Cheese was dry
2) Prime Rib tasted like a bootleg flatiron steak,
3) I almost lost a tooth trying to rip off the meat from a pork rib.

Chinese:
1) Eggdrop soup was pretty good.
2) Chicken was overly saucy
3) Fried rice - cardboard like texture

Dessert:
1) Donuts were DELICIOUS - glazed, plain, and powdered.
2) Chocolate-covered strawberries YUMMMM

Service: The workers seem soo unenthusiastic. Took them FOREVER just to walk a few feet to pour some soup for me.

Overall:
Food sucked. Dessert was awesome, but it wasn't enough to salvage my lunch.  Dessert was the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. 

Tip: Dont eat based on convenience in Vegas, make a little effort and it'll make a world of different in your dining experience",0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9g,1,0,2,wMkOFV4YaSoac0z2cISfyw
