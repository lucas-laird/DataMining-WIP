We just had an order delivered, and the guy honest to god said, in a front of a lobby full of people, that he didn't want us to sign, because ""She hasn't left a tip yet, and I want to make sure I get my tip"" when asked if he was serious, he said, ""Yeah man, I gotta get paid""

Don't get me wrong service was extremely quick almost looked like the sandwich was pre made but it wasn't. Walked in and was greeted normally with a ""hi welcome"" since it was my first time here I walk up to a girl on the counter and asked what's your favorite or the customer favorite at this place. She gives a sly attitude and says oh the menu is above you and you can order over to the next counter. I tell her I was just asking what the favorites are since it's my first time here, she replies with the cashier should be able to help you. Dumbfounded as why she couldn't just answer a simple question I walk over to the cashier and ask her the same question. She helped me through the menu and recommended a couple of items. I ended up getting the number 9 with chips and drinks the number 9 is called the Italian night club. It is made with salami, capicola, smoked ham and provolone cheese, topped with L-T-O, mayo and house made vinaigrette. Sat down to eat, and after I finished I yelled out thank you to the staff and i over hear a girl say thank you have a nice day ""again"" I just laughed, I guess they weren't expecting me to sit and eat, but take my food to go and eat in my car ?! But anyways the food is good, made quick, but man change the attitude. The food can taste like crap but if you give one of the best customer service the taste of food wouldn't matter as much because you distract the guest with kindness.",cdB_dIYHieklXNyvmrXweA,0,0,3,4NaqmcKSfsnFrUbRH7lg5Q

It clearly states that some shops will not carry that promo. So I proceeded to order the sandwich at full price and asked for a cup of water, she was very hesitant to give me the water cup and asked me to pay $.50 for regular Jimmy cup to put water in when I declined she pulled out this tiny little water funnel that couldn't even stand straight up and down and would have to be laid on its side which obviously wouldn't work with fluid in it.

This place is FAST...I mean really fast.   If you want to grab a sandwich on the go or want to sit down and grab a quick bite. This is my current go to spot for a good sandwich at lunch. 

The service is friendly and I have never experienced what the ""scorned"" casual past reviewers had experienced...and I've been here plenty of times to base my review on good service each of the times I've been here.

Tables and decor are clean and up modern...not much wear n tear like some sandwich shops Ive been in...

BAD
Would've given a 5 star to this place but came in one time this month....it smelled like somebody used a dirty mop on the floor.  I blame a lazy employee and not the business as a whole for this one time occurence.

Other than that...kudos to the JJ's team for always greeting me with a smile and having  a great sandwich made fresh for my belly!!",D5Cmz4luMLa0WD4LjYgpKQ,0,0,4,srG28iTbB0bzOZReOUG7Ew
5164273,2016-12-22,0,URQQqvHvktnVJCMRE2S5Tg,"My girlfriend & I went to this location last night for the first time & our last time unfortunately. The sandwiches we ordered just tasted plain. No flavor at all. If We would've known the product would be like that we would've just made sandwiches at the house! We saw nothing that stood out about it & the fact that I payed 18 bucks for 2 sandwiches that weren't good really sucked. Not sure what the problem was, but if the rest of the menu tastes like that then I would not recommend this place to no one. Maybe it was just the sandwich I got or something. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu before COMPLETELY writing you guys off. Maybe . But for now, I'm good.",wUefZVGewspCd-eoMhHLHA,0,0,1,NHhN_VrX9iyLsi0ivsUuJQ

Got my sandwich not cut in half. (Really not huge deal for me) but, all I have is lettuce, tamatoe and avocado spread. THATS IT! Should have cucumber, mustard.

5227947,2017-06-09,1,URQQqvHvktnVJCMRE2S5Tg,"I'm actually kind of surprised to see the comments about poor service here. 
We stopped in about a week ago, and service was spectacular.  Maybe there has been some turn around since the negative comments, or maybe we just caught everyone on a good day...

I love Jimmy John's, but we don't eat here very often.  Lack of opportunity I suppose.

Last week, we were in the mood for something DIFFERENT.  No more McDonalds, no more Del Taco (please god, no more tacos for a minute)...my husband says ""Isn't there a Jimmy John's somewhere around here?"" 

So, I pulled out my trusty Yelp app, and found this location, a mere 6 minutes from where we were.

We got our usuals:  The Bootlegger for me, with oregano, and the Gargantuan for my husband. 

We also applied the 5% off with Yelp check in...which was actually pretty comical.  It took 4 people looking at the offer to figure out what to do with it.  Apparently its either new, or people don't really take advantage of it often.  They were nice about it though, I tried to say that it really wasn't a big deal, but they persisted.  

Everyone we spoke to there was very nice.  

The food was great.  i love JJ's bread, so much more than other sandwich places.  
I would have liked a little extra mayo on my sandwich, but that's just being nitpicky.  

We will definitely come back again.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,2,4,7ltaFbHFZzHQpBIlYldpWQ

5319149,2017-02-23,3,URQQqvHvktnVJCMRE2S5Tg,"I remember being a young and modest college student back in the Midwest, I had a friend that worked at Jimmy John's and would give me free sandwiches. One sandwich isn't enough to fill me up so, I'd pay for another one.

I normally get Bootlegger (turkey and roast beef) and Hunter's Club (roast beef). When I'm trying to eat less bread, I'd get these to as an Un-Wich (instead of getting bread, your sandwich is wrapped in lettuce). I usually hate mayo but for some reason, I don't mind it on JJ sandwich.

I'd still have a JJ sandwich once a year just to reminisce on the good ol' days. But the sad part about this location is that they're not big on customer service at all. They're pretty rude and they mess up your order. The other locations in Vegas has better service compared to this place.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,3,2,PGIztJmLz8s2xtFRftMmZg

5542171,2016-09-19,0,URQQqvHvktnVJCMRE2S5Tg,The food is ok. Bread is a little hard but my biggest problem is their lack of attention. They mislabeled our two sandwiches so that when my dad dropped my son and I off and we finished carrying in our luggage and he took off with the one labeled as #7 it was the wrong one. So now he's 30 minutes away and neither of us have the food we ordered. They also didn't cut my pickle like they offered :(. Little things maybe but we were the only customers. Just pay attention to what you're doing. Being fast is useless if you can't be correct.,7Nc9cYym0S3bfS-fVOxEZQ,0,0,3,rCWwdAA_GHnRxbw3jamixA

I also appreciate the quickness that the sandwiches are made but I do wish there was a bit less push from the time you order; I always feel like I barely got the tomato removed before my sandwich was complete!

5681556,2017-02-05,0,URQQqvHvktnVJCMRE2S5Tg,"Jimmy Johns serve sandwiches at good prices. They make them really fast. (In seconds?) I just think they are a little boring, hence they are not getting 5 stars from me. At subway you can customize the sandwich to your liking while here it's more like you pick the one you want and hopefully it's good. I'm sure I could have told them to put extra stuff on it, but it was only my second time here so wasn't sure how the system worked and I didn't want to be the difficult customer during lunch rush hour. 

Good sandwiches for the money though.
