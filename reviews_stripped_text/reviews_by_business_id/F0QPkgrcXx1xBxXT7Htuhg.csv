61485,2013-10-12,1,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Went on a Thursday night as kind of a last resort and we were very impressed.  Got in right away with no reservation.  The decor is nothing fancy-a nice old school steakhouse.  Our server Todd was great.  Brought samples of the drinks for us to try.  Blood orange cosmo is great.  Wedge salad was good, but the lobster bisque was top notch, one of the best.  Our steaks were fantastic.  The meat is high quality not much gristle, and just the right amount of seasoning.  The rib eye was actually very lean for a rib eye and the filet was great.  For desert tiramisu which was never ending.
Overall, one the best steakhouses I have been to ever.",QSVwGRK1ZSTiId90WM7N3g,2,0,4,7Du9qb7luXh-spXleCtcIg
227836,2009-06-25,1,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Ok, here's the deal! I know Bally's is one of the older resorts on the strip. I've heard that the brunch here is fantastic. I really never heard very too many things about the actual steakhouse, good or bad. Well, let me put it to you like this....I've had much better, in terms of service, food, and atmosphere!

Ok, now to the good stuff, the food! Having been to many steakhouse's around Vegas and for that matter, many others around the country, I didn't hope for very much. It'd be like me comparing a BMW to a Chevy. Both are great for what they do, but the details is what matters! Now, knowing this, I looked at this place as a Chevy, a mid-level steakhouse catering to more of a family crowd. 

To start, there was a house special, bacon wrapped scallops over a bed of red pepper salad? Hum. I think it was more like bacon wrapped scallops over a few silvers of red peppers. Scallops were great, but it just needed a bit more substance. 

The second appetizer was the lobster bisque. Everything was ok, but seemed like more lobster meat was needed. 

Now to the steaks, the rib-eye's were solid. Nothing to really negative write about. Just the usual suspects. However a couple of things worth mentioning is that the lack flavoring of the various sauces they offer to the diner. Since there was 3 of us eating I thought we'd get a mix match of the sauces they offered. We ordered the red-wine, green peppercorn, and morel mushroom sauce. To be quite honest with you, it all tasted the same! Heavy on the cream, no honest flavoring of the various ingredients. 

Just like a classic steakhouse's side dishes were all al la carte. That being said, potatoes, ho hum, sauteed spinach, well at least the water should be drained a bit, and the fries? I think it was frozen. Oh well? What can you do?  

Now to the service...Very polite, but I would say they need to take a page out of service 101. i.e. being polite goes only so much, while knowledge of the food goes all the way! This being said, servers did not know what sauces I was asking about... just referring me to the listing they have... Promptly correcting a error is key to a great experience, but there was none...wrong sauces were brought to us...no apology...a steak someone ordered was returned to the kitchen for being kinda of ""off""...no apology...asking what the specials were...did not know...


With a city filled with great steakhouses, I might think twice before coming here again.",FWHbXUCndMVogI5EuH_TTQ,3,1,2,KXqHQaX3Uw0GSA4TbwZlug

We made our reservations through Tix4Tonight and got 50% off our entree can't beat that. The service was the best I have ever experienced and will be hard to beat.

331486,2010-01-19,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"My fiance and I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and service was fantastic!  I wish I could say the same for the food. 

Right after we were seated, the hostess brought over 2 glasses of champagne and said they wanted to wish us 'a prosperous and healthy new year'.  After we ordered, the waitress noticed that I kept looking at my watch (because I thought we might be running late for our show) and asked if we were limited in time.  Service was quick, staff were friendly and attentive.  The manager came by twice, once to say hello and the other to see how we were doing.    

The food was below average for a 'nice' steakhouse.  We both had steaks and they were nothing out of the ordinary.  The creamed corn we shared was way too sweet.  I also didn't like that the staff stood around in the dining area...perhaps it was a slow night, but still, I didn't enjoy eating with a group of people standing nearby talking and looking around. 

The manager stopped us on our way out, pulled a white rose out of their flower arrangement, handed it to me and said, 'for the beautiful lady'.  We were very well taken care of...if only they could step it up a notch with their food.

Yes, its on the high side for prices but it is a nicer steak house. We got the meal for two which was about $90. It has a huge piece of steak (sliced into 6 slices) and two sides. It was way more then enough for us, and we both can eat. ;-) if your looking for an upscale steak house, this is your place. The steak was probably the best I've had in a long time.

878297,2013-03-06,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"This place was fantastic!  My girlfriend and I went here on a date night and we both have never had such great steak or service.  We had initially wanted to go to Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse in Paris but were too late on reserving a table.  I'm very glad we decided to go to Bally's instead, I honestly don't think our experience anywhere else could have been better.

Our waiter Zane brought out drink samples for us and even gave us a comically large champagne bottle to take a picture with while we waited for our food.  For the appetizer, we got the crab cake and it was delicious.  Very tender crab meat that without too much breading.  I've never been too much of a crab cake enthusiast but I enjoyed this one.  For the main meal, I got a rib-eye steak, medium, and my girlfriend got the salmon with asparagus.  The steak blew my mind.  I had never had such a tender and well flavored steak before, and it was a decent size so that we still had a few bites leftover after dinner.  The salmon was also fantastic.  It was crusted from the sauce it was in, but not burnt at all.  I eat salmon quite a bit, and because it has a distinct flavor I sometimes feel like it all starts to taste the same.  It was still very impressive.  Also, the asparagus spears they served it with were GIGANTIC.

Overall, great service and fantastic steak.  I will definitely be coming here again next time I'm in Vegas.",cQ-P1xIk34nCOt51qFg9Lg,0,0,5,Tc4NMeOZt0jx70IkKWZ1kw

We like the waiters and staff in white shirt, tie, and black apron. Classy. (There were diners in t-shirts and jeans, but that's their problem).  A $49 special attracted us - salad or soup, filet, and dessert.

1056795,2011-12-15,3,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Ever walk into a darkly lit restaurant and think to yourself, ""This place is going to be either great or awful.""

Usually when the decor is retro I assume ""awful"". There must be a reason for the ""retro"" and I'm betting it has to do with the fact they don't make enough money. In this case the reason is, ""they like retro and poorly lit spaces."" I will admit its calming.

Our night began with mojitos and a vigorous discussion as to whether Mojitos were a ""girly man drink"".  I'm immature, you'll just have to deal with it. Regardless of ""girly many drink"" status, the mojitos were ""wonderful"". Too often tenders use too much sugar, because Americans have an odd sugar fetish. The sugar drowns out the other flavors though. This bartender made a perfectly dry mojito. My regards sir.

However, now my review becomes horribly biased, because, as we all know, if you get a good drink, everything tastes that much better. Too bad for you, you'll have to go and make a determination yourself.

We will make do though. Drinks were followed by rolls, with dashes of salt on top. DASHES OF SALT!! BRILLIANT!! Guiness TV commercials brilliant!! (Only three people who read this review will get that joke ... pitty.) The roll is just dusted with salt (and then covered in enough butter to kill a person by yours truly), but that little bit of salt makes the yeast POP. Oh Lord we thank thee for salt!!

Next course!! Scallops. Bacon wrapped scallops. Bacon wrapped scallops with little bits of onion and potato. Bacon wrapped scallops with little bits of onion and potato WITH MORE LITTLE BITS OF BACON!! JOY!! Stop drooling. Just kidding, I'm drooling too. The scallops were really moist and had a fantastic flavor.

I haven't seen a note about any of this, but everything is A La Carte. Its typical of good restaurants, but I thought I should make a note. We ordered steak, lobster tails, asparagus, spinach, twice baked potatoes, and creamed corn.

I must admit to being slightly disappointed in the steak. It was only the size of my head. I was hoping for a steak the size of my leg. Fortunately, the lobster tail were the size of my leg so I relented from complaining. The steak was seared and medium rare and tender. Very few inch and a half thick steaks can be cut with a fork. The lobster tails were so delicate and sweet ... HEAVEN. The asparagus was blonde asparagus and was clearly blanched. It was wonderfully crunchy, which was amazing considering was HUGE the spears were. The corn was beautifully creamed. I don't like runny creamed corn, this was thick and creamy.

Finally, dessert. Creme Brulee with berries. The brulee was second to none I've ever had and is, by far, my favorite desert that does not rhyme with ""ice cream"".

If you are in Vegas and close to Ballys and want a good steak and a fantastic dinner and don't want me to write a run-on sentence, then Ballys is an excellent choice. Go get yourself a ginormous steak.",7HSVIg1a3vlsCamgU5a2Ig,2,1,5,8lIsdWwi9DSLE6f41UIaLg

The service is pretty good, and the booths are comfortable and afford a good view of the restaurant.

1167477,2009-04-13,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"The staff was friendly and I felt welcome, but the food just wasn't up to par.  

To start, the bread was warm and tasty, and the butter was delicious.  Next I had the lobster bisque, which was just ok.  It tasted more of cream than of lobster.  I prefer a more modern version with lumps of meat in it, and it seemed like they tried, though I only got two tiny bits of lobster.  Next, I had the Kansas City Strip Steak (bone-in).  I ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked correctly.  But, it looked like it hadn't been trimmed well because there was a huge piece of fat on the side (more than a normal strip steak should have).  The peppercorn sauce that came with it was good, but the steak just didn't have any flavor of its own.  I got a side of asparagus and they looked like white asparagus (but they weren't).  The claim of jumbo asparagus was also way off... these were smaller than the asparagus I can get at the grocery store.  And the ones I get at the grocery are green throughout.  The béarnaise sauce was good, though.  I finished with the chocolate profiteroles.  I know they are supposed to be miniature cream puffs, but boy, they were tiny (and only three of them).  Size and quantity aside, they were good.  They had whipped cream and vanilla ice cream in the middle, though I got the feeling they were straight from box in the freezer.

Overall, I didn't get the meal I was hoping for.  The flavors just weren't there. The highlight of the meal was using a 50% voucher (off main entree only) from Tix4Dinner (Tix4Tonight).  The meal was $75 before tax and discount, and $57 after.",Xktj5TM-WhtJvQP_imytVQ,0,0,2,3k-7SuiZBGmyDyQJgkP4mg

It has the feel of places from back in the day, although they kind of celebrate their age with classic movie star pictures.  Some of the semi-circlular tables along the back really take you back, along with the formal dress of the staff.

The highlight were the wines by the glass, and they were good.  Also the breads.. I would eat the bacon/chedder bread and some of the others.  The butter/oil/balsamic vinegar mold is a great idea.  

Things went quicly downhll from there.  The crab cake appetizer is more of a mound.  It came cold and my wife returned it.. which is not common for her to do... it came back quickly and I'm really not sure how they cook the thing.  Had two sauces that were unremarkable.  The French Onion soup I tried... a classic at an old school restaurant right?  No flavor and an off taste like either the cheese was old or off or the soup had been made days before.  I returned it.

The Caesar salads I thought were overly salted.  My wife thought the lettuce was not crispy enough.

The real problems came with the entree's. My wifes simple pasta with plum tomotos was mediocre at best.  

I ordered the veal chop, medium rare.  Came to me rare.  I felt bad about complaining about another dish after the soup, but it was not cooked right.  Sent it back. After about 20 minutes, a waiter holding a new chop began wandering around the restaurant looking for the right table for awhile until finally figured out where to go.  At least this guy stayed to see if things were good.  It was even more rare than the first. 

At that point we gave up.  Since my wife doesn't like to eat without me, her pasta dish was now cold an it seemed clear they couldn't manage cooking a simple chop....season it, sear it and finish in the ovn (these were thick, restaurant quality chops...I could tell the first was undercooked just by touching it.    The second had a small layer of cooked meat surrounding a sold black of under cooked meat.

2679385,2011-08-21,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Alright, so me and 4 other friends came here for Sterling Brunch a few Sundays ago. None of us had ever been before; it was my suggestion after hearing about it from a friend of mine. We got here at 11. They ran out of the king crab legs just after I got my first plate - I would have stocked up if I knew that was going to happen! I also discovered they were out of sashimi...come on! So two of my favorite things at a very expensive buffet are gone - I wasn't a happy camper. I wound up going to the cold seafood bar and got a bunch of crab claws instead. Thankfully, I was able to drink my sorrow away with the bottomless mimosas. The lamb shanks were *incredible* and all of my friends agreed, so it wasn't just me (or the champagne). The filet mignon was good but a tad overcooked for my liking. I'm a medium rare guy myself but I get that they need to appeal to the people who don't know better and like theirs well done...ugh. The lobster tails were alright. I mean, I've had better but I guess they were good enough for my buddy who ate 6 or 7 of them! The desserts were just ok, nothing out of this world. They have a crepe bar and I had a banana one which I enjoyed.

2958680,2012-10-01,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Had a Groupon gifted to my husband and me for use on our trip to Vegas, so we made reservations and figured we'd give it a shot.  As parents of a third grader, it's not often we get to go out for meals that don't involve a kid's menu that comes with crayons or sing their own loud renditions of ""Happy Birthday"", so knowing we were going out for ""a nice meal"" was definitely a welcomed change of pace.

First of all, the only real bummer in all of this and the reason for four stars instead of five, was that they lost my reservation.  Of all the things I forgot to pack, it was the piece of paper with the confirmation number on it.  They managed to seat us fairly quickly, but it was certainly after all of the other walk-ins had been seated.  I'll remember next time to bring my confirmation.

The decor was definitely not current Vegas glitz, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  It was clean and classic - true ""old"" Vegas, but not in a tired and dated, ""OMG I CAN SEE THROUGH THAT CARPET"" kind of way.  Personally, I enjoyed it.  If you're not into anything except glitter and shiny lights, this might not be for you.

The service was amazing.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff were on par with their suggestions and we never wanted for much.  For starters, my husband had the lobster bisque and I had a Caesar salad - although you can get a Caesar salad just about anywhere, this one was by far the best I've had in a long time.  My husband couldn't stop raving about the bisque and, had we been at one of those paper kid's menu places, he might've licked the bowl clean.

For entrees, we skipped the steaks and had their pasta dishes.  I had the spaghetti carbonara - ironically, it was the cheapest item on the menu at $28, but I wasn't choosing it to be cheap.  I chose it because I really like carbonara and my low-carb diet was on hold for our trip to Vegas, so I was shoveling all the pasta into my gut that I could manage.  I wasn't let down, either - the noodles tasted like they'd been made in house, the sauce was perfectly creamy and OMG THE BACON.  Quite possibly, the best bacon I've ever had in all my 33 years.

My husband had some linguine dish.  It had shrimp the size of his fist.  Beyond that, I don't remember.  I was too busy having a bacon-related orgasm.  He enjoyed his dish as well and again, I think I saw him really contemplating licking the plate clean.

I could not finish my meal and my husband was equally stuffed, so we skipped dessert and chose instead to finish our drinks and enjoy each other's company.  The only thing that seemed out of place in the entire establishment was a loud wedding party seated behind us.  It kind of ruined the mojo a little bit, but that wasn't the establishment's fault.

All in all, this place is ace in my book.  A perfect example of how a Groupon can help you drum up repeat business - we'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.",clvKaETqirNH12yxkKF2JA,0,0,4,zAWzq7jtmetYSANOVTr7MQ

Caeser salad was very good.  For my entree i had the Chicken Marsala, which was really good, except the flavor was a little too bold.  I like tons of flavor (salt) in my food, but this was slightly a bit much for me.  Otherwise the dish was executed beautifully, the mushrooms were tender, as was the artichoke hearts.  I've never eaten artichokes in Chicken Marsala before but it was surprisingly yummy.

The bf's filet mignon was dry, and had way too many chunks of thick bacon all over his plate, it was like eating bite-sized beef jerky.  The roasted garlic bulb was a good save.

Dad ate light and got the Chicken Parmigiana Soup and a steakhouse salad.  Salad was good, soup was HORRIBLE.  Tasted like a can of Hunts tomato sauce with some ""i cant see no chicken"" under some glob of white cheese i believe.  Hope they take it off the menu and put some real soups on there.

First off they brought drink samples(blood orange Cosmo and a gentleman jack/apple) which seems tacky to me and they were nothing special.   I ordered a simple Filet Mignon, it was just okay... A filet Mignon should never be just 'okay' especially when you're paying $48 for only your cut of meat.  Side items are priced separately.  My small wedge salad was around $12, and my $12 baked potato was over cooked and dry.  The mashed potatoes were served in a tiny cast iron side dish and were more like a purée or soup, and there was a film of grease on top.  My husband ordered the prime rib-eye for $50, he asked for medium-well.  The waiter was rude.  They served it charcoaled!  I was appalled!  Seriously charcoaled on the outside and dry as leather on the inside.  I had the waiter look at it, and even the waiter was shocked.  The next rib-eye they brought out was cooked perfectly.  However, by that time we were all finished with our meal and my husband was full on the bread.  We paid $150 for 2....  And they did NOT comp us for the charcoal rib-eye. I am giving them 1 star for the bread and my 'okay' filet.  I would suggest to go to the buffet!  I love trying new restaurants and have never given any of them this bad of a review.

3415891,2010-11-24,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Oy. Where to begin?? My colleague and I went here for a nice dinner and boy, what a let-down. We arrived at 4:50pm and the hostess told us that we'd have to wait until 5pm to be seated. I've worked in restaurants for 10+ years and let me tell you- at 10 minutes prior to ""opening"", a restaurant is ready to go. There is no reason to not seat someone. Period. So, we went to the bar for a glass of wine. Approached the bar and the bartender was writing something in a big book, and apparently we interrupted his concentration. We asked for the wine list and asked him if he had a Malbec he'd recommend. He frowned and said, ""What's Malbec??"". Seriously? You are in a ""top"" steakhouse and don't know what Malbec is?? We ordered a bottle of wine and sat there for probably 20 minutes, then finally we were told our table was ready. We asked the server at the bar to split the bill in 1/2 and he looked terrified and said, ""Ohhh I don't know if I can do that. I have to call a manager..."" Seriously?? I mean, I didn't ask him to cut off his arm, just split the bill in 1/2. We were seated and apparently no one in the restaurant had heard of Malbec. The food was solid, but when they say the side orders serve TWO- think again. This is not like a Morton's steakhouse. The servings were small. We ordered coffee and dessert and I will say it was delicious. It was just very awkward~ the service, awkward. And the atmosphere is rather old-school. The crowd was also an older crowd, you get the feeling they live there. Would I go here again? Not unless I had to. Sorry.",6xd2nUpkqVZD45TJBcsFJQ,2,0,2,F09gl4AixdXVnokIPh6g-A
3438031,2012-10-14,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"We had two groupons to try here and they were about to expire so we ate back to back days here. Needless to say, my gf and I have a very good idea about what this place is like. 

First off, it has quite an old Vegas feel-- this place is definitely a lot older than I am. As far as strip resorts go, Bally's is one of the older ones that is still located right in the middle of the action and this steak house has been there from the beginning. As a result, it's got a classic steak house feel with classic service. The hostess is gracious and polite, the waiters will constantly check on you to see how you are doing and you won't be able to empty your water glass no matter how much you drink. The blue floral wall paper even seems a bit old timey, and the crowd is often a bit older as well.

The bread here is a pleasant surprise. You'll like the mini french baguettes and enjoy the thyme rolls but you'll go crazy for the pretzel bread-- OMFG that shiz is the biz. The raisin bread I could honestly do without but this bread arrangement is definitely worth remarking on.

The rosepetal salad is a very tasty mix of bitter leafy greens but I think it could have done with a bit more rose petal and a hint of more dressing.

The diablo sauce shrimp linguine is hardly ""diablo-ey"" -- you'd have to be a real wuss to think that its as spicy as the waiters warn, but it is definitely tasty and comes with some gnarly lookin jumbo shrimp. 

I didn't particularly care for the escargot and I don't think its a good way to spend your money here-- you'd be better off having the stuff at Comme Ca where they emphasize quality over quantity. The seasoning wasn't particularly agreeable and it just wasn't buttery enough.

I really liked the lobster mac and cheese. They don't skimp on the lobster and the blend of cheeses is just right. You'll get that subtle bite of bitterness in each mouthful and the sauce is not overly thick.

I mostly enjoyed the dry aged angus porterhouse here and had no problem finishing it. I ordered it medium rare and most of the cut was cooked to order, just as I requested it. However, I don't know whether this is due to their grill or just due to the difficulty of cooking a porterhouse evenly, but part of it was a lot closer to medium well than rare. Over all though, it was a very enjoyable steak served with three different sauces (by request). The black peppercorn sauce was probably the best-- it was a hint of spicy. The mushroom sauce was thick and creamy and the Bearnaise was sharp and tangy. 

I think this is a solid steakhouse, especially if you have a groupon or living social to spend. I'm not sure I could really justify eating here at full price because the competition for steakhouses in vegas is tight. I think I slightly preferred my trip to the Golden Steer on Sahara. However, these guys will offer you an enjoyable meal and treat you right, and I suppose that is just as important as anything else.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,5,0,4,eqJ98lxaUYI_bSwaQSNRqA
3515130,2010-09-13,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"R and I had dinner here the other day and It was one of the worst steak house places that I've ever gone to, and I think I've tried enough to know what is good and what's average.  He bought tickets to the Jubilee show at Bally's and thought that it would be a good idea to have dinner there right before the show.  We got there about 5:30 and when we checked in, it didn't even sound like they had our reservation down. As we sat down, a few other couples came in, and the maitre d' greeted them like long lost cousins and proceeded to seat them before us.   How rude!  

We then were seated at our table which was rather nice on the second level.  Rather dark, but that's quite expected.  I had the portobello salad, and R had the regular salad. My salad was absolutely amazing, and I'm just wondering how they went about flavoring the portobello mushrooms and spinach that way.  Definately would love to have the recipe for that one.   The steak came and that was the worse piece of meat I've ever eaten.  It didn't have any flavor and was rather tough.  I was about to ask for some sort of steak sauce to enhance the flavor somehow, but thought it would be rather rude.  

The saving grace at this restaurant is their desserts.  However, on their prix fixe menu, it was a choice of creme bruiee and banana cream pie.  Both were really good, but not something that I would fly to Las Vegas for.  If it wasn't for the portobello salad and the dessert, then this would definately have been one of those reviews that would have rated a negative number or a zero.",aFlBq0rMHOBc9f1J8ANH9Q,1,0,2,8xmwEw5p6Pf144C6CoOhAw

Bally's steakhouse is a fancy restaurant within a not as fancy casino. When you walk in, you feel like you're on the set of Goodfellas and expecting to see Pesci giving some dude a hard time for being funny. 

The drink selection is amazing, they have all sort of beers, cocktails, and wine. They would offer you to taste two of their cocktail specials to entice you to buy one. For vegas prices, it is decently priced. 

The food was decent as well. I got the Ribeye steak and man was it cooked well! Sooo delicious. My own gripe was that the steaks don't come with a side, so you have to spend an extra $3 on top of the $60+ that you are already spending on the steak. I hope that they would change this one day and just come with a steak. It does come with bread, which is only ok. Slightly on the hard side.

As with any upscale dining, the service is amazing. The waiter gives you the high class treatment even when you're not dressed like an A-lister (ie. me wearing a sweater and jeans). They are really knowledgable about the menu and offered my friend that i was eating with a good suggestion and was very attentive on our needs. Well worth the high tip that we ended up giving him!

Another interesting note, they offer a brunch special during the day for $80 that has prime rib, lobster, caviar, champagne, and assortment of desserts. I have to come back and try that some day!

3955015,2012-05-29,3,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Oh my gosh. A 3.5 stars overall rating for this place? HOW??

I have just received the absolute worst service in my entire life here. I was expecting so much more from an upscale steak house especially with it being inside the casino. My boyfriend and I were in for a special occasion but our server ruined it with her service. She was not very friendly or helpful. Once we sat down, I was looking for a nice glass of wine and when she asked, ""Can I start you off with anything?"" I told her that it was our first visit and she was just like, ""Oh, well I meant like a drink,"" like I was stupid. I was going to ask for a suggestion or even a drinks list since we didnt even get one, but fuck if you're going to be like that, then hell no.

After about 15 more minutes of being neglected and treated badly we finally ordered but then we decided this server was putting me in a bad mood so we left. We stood up and approached who we assumed was the maitre d or manager and told him we were unhappy. He asked if the server didn't take our order yet and we told him that was not the case. Then he said that our appetizers were ready so there shouldn't be a problem. I said I understood that, but that I didn't like the service. He replied, ""So, what? Do you want to leave?"" And I said yes, and tried to begin to explain why I was unhappy but he just said ""Ok then, go ahead."" Throughout this entire conversation he didn't actually ASK me what the problem was and kept interrupting me and talking over me. What kind of restaurant doesn't even ask or try to remedy the problem and lets an unhappy customer just leave? FUCKING RIDICULOUS. I thought my server was bad, but the manager was even worse. He just lost a potential $200 out the door. I have never been treated so badly in my entire life.

All of these reviews saying the service was excellent? I don't understand. I work in the restaurant industry, and I have never seen any establishment, fine dine or casual, with such TERRIBLE front of the house manners, menu knowledge, or presentation. And that is saying A LOT.

Maybe it's because I look young and they think I don't have the money? Maybe it's because I'm Asian, and they think Asians are always cheap? Maybe they thought I wasn't dressed up, enough even though everyone else in the fucking ugly-ass, dimly lit restaurant wore jeans and old, faded Tommy Bahama shirts, and they figured they could treat me as less of a worthy customer as everyone else? Well guess what, Bally's Steakhouse? I make that money, I am a successful ASIAN business woman, and I looked fucking BEAUTIFUL that night that I came into your HORRIBLE establishment. Word of advice?

I was brought the bread basket shortly after getting my iced tea delivered.  The selection was nice.  I only had one multi-grain roll because I wasn't there to fill up on bread.

For starters, I got the onion soup.  It was a hearty beef stock with just the right amount of cheese on top.  I didn't have to have to break my way through a cheese avalanche to get to the soup.

For the main course, I got the 12 ounce filet and I had them Oscar it.  That adds lump crabmeat and asparagus to the steak.  When served, the waiter brought a small sauce boat of Bérnaise that he ladled over the crab.  There was a small grilled whole tomato and a yellow pepper on the plate.  I got a twice baked potato as a side.  The steak was cooked black and blue as I ordered and it had a good flavor.

Last, dessert.  I ordered their signature banana cream pie.  It was very good.  Instead of a graham cracker crust, they used chopped peanuts for the crust and there are a few peanuts dropped onto the whipped cream that topped the pie.  

Service was good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  My one test of service was a fail.  After I out the artificial sweetener in my iced tea, I always twist the small paper packet and leave it on the table.  Good service always notices this and removes the empty packet.  Last night, the packet was left there three times.  It's an obvious thing to remove it but they just didn't.

I enjoyed the hour and a half I spent here.  I wasn't rushed, the food was good, and it's a classic steakhouse with striped wall paper, wood railings, and brass lights.  Dark and cozy is also a good description.

  Their website states there is a ""dress code"", and when I called to make the reservation I was also told that there is a ""dress code"".  So.... hubby and I got all dressed up..... something we don't normally do..... and headed towards the hell known as the Las Vegas Strip.

  We were warmly welcomed by the hostess.  Was seated in a comfy booth.  The restaurant was very nice.... and I enjoyed the old photographs of celebrities hanging on the walls.

  It would have been a romantic place, but it was so crowded and noisy!  We were surprised at how busy it was for a Tuesday night!

  And.... to our suprise..... we were probably the best dressed patrons in the restaurant!   People were coming in wearing shorts and t-shirts!   Wish I had known this in advance.

  The menu wasn't anything impressive.   Basic steakhouse food.   Everything is ""ala carte"".  

 We ordered a house salad to share,  a baked potato to share, and a filet mignon for each of us.

  A bread basket was brought to our table and it was all fresh and tastey.

  I thought the salad was rather plain and bland..... although the 2 rose petals were an interesting touch.

  The steak was probably one of the best I've ever eaten.  A very high quality piece of meat.  The bearnaise sauce was also very good.

  Hubby and I even thought the potato was awesome..... for a potato.

  Service was very good.   Prompt and attentive wait-staff.... although very busy.

  All in all..... I'm glad we had the experience (thanks to my daughter and Groupon).   I would NEVER spend that much money for a meal.   That's just not ""me"".

4397643,2013-03-17,1,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"I was at Bally's due to a convention and was already put off by the room and a gym that is only open from 6am to 6pm.  i am still scratching my head about that.  Anyway, I was in Vegas going on my second day and was not willing to eat at another buffet and I was really in the mood for a steak. Co-workers that were at the convention kept talking about Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in Paris. I wasn't willing to mortgage my house to eat dinner.  So I decided to venture into Bally's Steakhouse.  My son gave me a little toy solder (Capt. Chaos) to take pictures of while I was out so that he could see what i was up to when i am off travelling for work...  Good Times!  I was a little concerned because restaurants with the same name as a hotel usually are lame, but i was pleasantly surprised!  

I was greeted by the hostess and she was able to sit me right away (even without reservations).  I noticed that the majority of tables were set up to sit two people comfortably.  If you had more than 3 in a party, the tables might be too crowded (assuming that your group orders appetizers,drinks, etc.).  There were two groups with about 10+ people, but they were placed more in the middle of the restaurant where there is a lot of foot traffic. As soon as I sat, the waiter let me know that he was helping another table and would be right with me. Another person swept through and supplied some water and some warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Next, the waiter came by and recommended a nice Pinot Noir from the Russian River (excellent).  I ordered the Caesar Salad (average) for starters.  For the main course, I ordered the Bone In Ribeye (24oz) with the baked potato and grilled asparagus.  The steak was great! Way better than I expected: medium rare, very nice sear and tender. I didn't need to add any additional seasoning which was great.  It was probably one of the better steaks I have eaten in my short life here on this rock.  I took several pictures of Capt. Chaos posing on the steak!  He was impressed too. The asparagus was cooked just right and the potato was... a potato. All in all i was very happy with my meal and would most likely go back when/if i stay at Bally's in the future!

4726636,2012-08-27,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"My husband and I were in Vegas for our honeymoon and found a Groupon for this place, so we decided buy the Groupon and try it out. Decor is very old school, as other reviewers mentioned. We had a fairly early reservation and were seated promptly.

Dinner was served with two breads, a baguette and a bread with fruit and nuts. For appetizers, we ordered escargot. They were drenched in an olive oil, garlic and herb sauce that was fantastic for sopping the bread in.  For the main course, I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the duck . My salmon was delicious, with a nice crust from the sauce but not burned at all. The sauce it came in was advertised as a black bean sauce but was more citrusy and gingery, with a kick that was pleasant but not overwhelming. The veggies in the dish tasted fresh and crisp. My husband's duck was cooked medium rare and was a high quality cut of meat. He seemed to really enjoy his meal, though I didn't get a chance to taste. 

We didn't get dessert and left full, but not overstuffed. We didn't wine or cocktails due to dehydration from the oppressive heat of Vegas in July, so I can't really review those selections. But overall, we really enjoyed our dining experience here and the Groupon made it totally worth it. We would be willing to return and pay full price for a meal for a splurgey occasion.

Note: They have a dress code but it's pretty casual, basically stuff like 'no tank tops'.",2__1EmK8L4aNmKdiHLX8zQ,0,0,5,yAWmm9WtGs33vQ9s4D8i9A

Servers were nothing but nice. 

They offered us both sample cocktails. I tasted my orange cosmo which I would have happily ordered another one but I'm not much of a drinker.

I had the special Wagyu 6 oz as I not going to try to eat an 18 oz steak, and nothing else completely caught my eye in terms of entrees. Bread was amazing and I ate too much of it.

The bacon wrapped stuff shrimp was very tasty and just the right portion as was the asparagus.

My notoriously picky eater husband loved his French Onion Soup (even I liked what I tasted and I'm not a fan of it), killed his 18 oz ribeye. Enjoyed the Caesar even though the dressing was mixed in (he hates dressing).

Dessert was a creme brulee cheesecake (2 spoons).

It's VERY expensive but worth it. I even grabbed a business card in the hopes I can convince my coworkers this MIGHT be a good spot for his annual Vegas dinner.

Our waiter even presented the check without asking if we wanted dessert.  Our meals went unfinished because the quality of the meat was so poor, the steaks were so tough. Yet, the waiter never asked us if everything was ok with our meals.  Overpriced mediocre food.

5107379,2013-10-14,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"The place is just okay. Nothing spectacular.  The decor is dated, the menu is dated, the manner in which they serve (carts? Really? Table side salad service?) is dated.

I contemplated on whether or not this is okay since it is Vegas. Vegas has a history and the Bally's Steakhouse is part of it. However, I do not think that excuses this place.  It is fine to play up your history, but using that to excuse the lack of an updated menu or decor is unacceptable.

The food was okay. I would have been very upset with my meal had I paid full price, but I had a Groupon so I did not have to. A $30  dinner is fine. Had I paid the $58 dollars on the bill, not so much.

I understand this place is set to close its doors, and that is really too bad. Given the location and history, I believe it could have been a viable option for dinning on the north strip, especially considering the competition is high priced venues such as Picasso at the Bellagio. 

I think I would still recommend people give the place a try before they close the doors, if for nothing else to be able to say you dined at a resturant frequented by Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra.",4-55PJhdqV8hGFLxYiobsQ,3,1,3,kgVkhcpBenoz7X6ftOKgKg

The free mimosas, Beldevere shots, and Bloody Marys were good.

The filet mignon and lobsters were also very good. I was trying to find the caviar but they didn't have any :( They had some lamb with mint sauce that was very tasty.

Sushi was also pretty good. Fruit is good too. Selection is pretty small overall though.

5256197,2013-02-16,0,F0QPkgrcXx1xBxXT7Htuhg,"Granted, my expectations were a little low, but Bally's Steakhouse blew me away. 

This old-school steakhouse is like stepping back in time to the 1950s...where you could dine side by side with Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin. Everything is very professional from the moment that you check in with the hostess and enter the restaurant lobby. Though the restaurant is not huge, the tables are packed closely together. There is a mix of booths along the walls, as well as free-standing tables in the center of the room. Servers and busboys skillfully navigate trays of cocktails and trays of meat. 

The prices are so much more reasonable than some of the more ""trendy""steak restaurants (Gordon Ramsey, I'm talking about you). But the food is just as outstanding as those newer, more expensive hotspots. 

Start with an appetizer...I highly recommend the Escargot Stuffed Mushrooms, and my friends loved their salads. For dinner, get the Filet Mignon...cooked to perfection! I literally ate every bite. The Truffle Mac & Cheese and Mashed Potato sides are also wonderful.

They brought samples of their signature drinks; a blood orange Cosmo for me and a gentleman jack/apple brandy for the guys. First of all, sexist much? Why not ask instead of assuming the girl is gonna want the fruity vodka drink? Both drinks were pretty tasty, though. 

Lobster bisque. No. Bland and too thick and too creamy. Gross. 

Scallops over a bed of what looked like arzo rice and mushrooms. Very flavorful and tender. I LOVE scallops and these were right up to par. 

I tried my friends' sides; asparagus and Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, all alright, nothing special. Steak was good, but not as good as the one I had at the Cosmo the previous week.

For sides we shared creamed of corn, and garlic mashed. Nothing to write home about. We passed the sides around each person just took a spoon and the two sides were enough for 9 people. Hey we didn't come here for corn and potatoes! LOL I think each sides is meant to be shared just two people. 

One big no no though, chef didn't cook the meat to perfection. I did asked for Medium rare. Always medium rare that's a temperature range from  130 - 135F. It came medium which is a temperature range from 135 - 140F.

If you ordered steak well done you're wasting the goodness from the meat. You see the marbling of the meat (the fat) is what gives that lush, silky, rich flavors. Once you get it well done, the heat melts off all the marbling/fat. Now you're steak is dried, tasteless, and rubbery. I dare say, ""shame on you for ordering well done!"" lol

So if you ordered your steak well done you're better off just not ordering. This isn't a dish for you. You're better off just order spaghetti with meat sauce. 

Did you see the picture I took? They made a nice trim around the rib eyes so there wasn't too much fat around the side, and the heat from from the grill flared up just enough to give a little crunchy crust on the side. Ohhhh, mmmmmm, there were 9 of us and when I got the steak  I wasn't talking to either one of them until I was half way into the steak.

And another thing, Chef didn't over salt the meat. That happened a lot more than you think. I'm not a fan of salt. I like to taste the meat and when it's over salted I can't eat it. But if Chef under salted you can sprinkle some on yourself. The grilled tomatoes, and fried Onions were also delicious. This is my kind of food. Simple, high quality ingredients, delicious! You know there were only two ingredients that went on to the steak right? Yeah, just S&P, Salt & Pepper. What made this steak so amazing is the 45 days aging. That process is what made this steak off the chart. I won't bored you with the aging process details. But if one day you had to choose between two cuts of steaks get the one that's aged.

Recaps:

Get the 24 oz. Aged Rib Eyes. It's so good you'll kiss your mama.
Service was excellent. He was professional, and patient
Value is off the charge with 50% off coupon. I don't know where my buddy got it. What a great deal! This piece of meat easily goes for $80 at Mastro.

Confession time:
I couldn't sleep and splurged on Amazon.com again :( But I cant wait to get my order. I ordered a new cologne, and bunch of other stuff!!! Hahahhaa.

For our dinner we both ordered filet mignons with a side of green beans and giant baked potato. The steaks were wonderful and were done just like we wanted them.

After a day of walking the strip, I was ready for a good meal. Earlier that morning we went to the Tix 4 Tonight office to buy Blue Man Group tickets and the option of buying dinner coupons were available. We asked the person which place he thought was best and he answered Bally's Steakhouse. So we decided to pay the extra 3 dollars a person for 50% off any entree. 

Cool right? Instead of $40 Fillet Mignon, you can get if for $20. So we go. As we walked in the restaurant, each of us a class of champagne. I love Vegas... plus one star. We get seated and order our food. I of course got the Fillet Mignon. It's literally a piece of meat on a plate. No sides, no nothing. Fail for plating. You have to order the sides separately and they're $6 each. Really??? Come on. That's so lame. I ordered the mushrooms for sides and there were rather good, although slightly on the salty side. I have to add that the staff were really friendly and helpful. 

I would NEVER go back to this place if we didn't get the entree coupon. Actually, I don't even know if I would ever get the coupon again. I don't think it's worth going to. Nothing to write home about, unless it's about the prices.",TkGZE41Uq81PwMvWrDMzzg,3,1,2,Jh1z0s2yGj-m7IhD0_yYmQ
