1408745,2018-01-28,16,P2cHq6apwK7z6XPaU24iJQ,"This pains me to leave this review as 2 stars but I have to be open and honest.

I saw on social media that Veganos was opening and was pretty excited about a vegan place opening off Rancho/Cheyenne. I was promised (after asking) via social media that is was not connected to a vegan taco shop on the East side that I despise...so we went. 

We went having an open mind that the photos looked EXACTLY like the other place, with almost EXACTLY the same menu, yet hoped it would be better...it was not.

Pretty rough area hubs was hesitant to park the car, the car is not a RR but it's nice. We walked in a saw a nice family eating and a woman in the back. 

The cashier was super timid and just stood there. When she spoke it was sooooo quiet you can hardly hear her. Not sure if she is miserable or just a quiet person. We order a bunch of food and two hibiscus teas.

We sat and the table was dirty, crumbs and so I wiped them away with the only thing on the table, a paper menu. 

Our drinks came and they were gross. I was super sad I just didn't order a bottle of water. I was hungry and thirsty and this hibiscus tasted exactly like ultra sweet koolaide. I tried to drink it again and just couldn't.

Chkn taco place came and it had beans and rice. Looked sooooo yummy I was excited! Cheat day starting! I kinda actually liked the chikn in the tacos, it had a sauce, but of course it processed faux so I'm surprised I even ate it. The rice tasted like globs of spiced tomato sauce oily rice and the beans were sooooo bland they were border like opening a can and adding salt. They were just boiled pinto beans. 

The breakfast burrito was uncooked mushy tofu (at least add some Kala Namak and turmeric!) a hella ton of canned mushy jalapeño and some white onion that was barely sautéed...

The nachos were ok but since asking for no Daiya (and getting some on it anyway) they were also salty and bland. The ascada was horrible, it was vegan Tofurkey sausage links cut up and tossed on the top. Dry and chunky. There were a few plops of guacamole which tasted great and thankfully some cilantro to give something some type of flavor. The chips are the top shelf Cardenas type of chip the triple fried ones...super crispy...super fried. 

Hubs and I were really hungry and tried to eat the ""food"" anyway. All I could think of was wow can't wait for this conversation in the car.......

We got in the car and we both agreed we would have rather just went to Taco Bell for the first time in ten years and saved the $35.

I was right...it's just like Panchos Vegan Tacos. Poor quality, wasted calorie vegan junk food. Very sad because it could be soooooooo good!!!!!!

If you look at my photos it looks GREAT right? It's not. I have an extreme sodium headache and it's bland af.

Save your money and go to Panchos Kitchen on Charleston. You will thank me later.

1513732,2017-12-30,0,P2cHq6apwK7z6XPaU24iJQ,"After our first time at Veganos, we really enjoyed it! The Beyond Burger is great, the aioli was delicious and it didn't even need the extra ketchup and mustard they put on the sides. Fries were standard but good. The Chile relleno was tasty but the sauce was too spicy for us. The spice overpowered the flavor. And of course it'd be better with a different cheese, I'm not a fan of Daiya. The al pastor burrito was good but I wish there was more al pastor and less filler in the burrito. It was a little unbalanced. The rice and beans are out of this world! I could just get them and be thrilled. 

Veganos is one of the only options in this part of town and we will definitely be going back.",ABed0yA5ycrYO_-3ZNgqYA,3,3,4,C3q_xyIm8H1kTeIHaPIofg

I ordered the Chile Relleno and the Pozole. The Chile Relleno was superb and very flavorful, it came with rice and beans. The rice was good and the beans delicious. I would have loved two Chile Rellenos . The sauce was very tasty and in my opinion, this is a must try. 

The Pozole with Vegan Asada meat as my choice of meat was really good. It reminded me of the Pozole I am used to having at Birthday parties or at weddings. I am not Vegan and it was a pleasant surprise to discover how good the Pozole was without the tons of pork it usually comes with. 
I tasted it on its own and it was tasty. After that, I just dumped all the garnish and lime in. Delicious!

I am so glad I came here and would love to encourage you to try them. It's fantastic to have this type of business in town and I hope they flourish. It can only encourage a trend and elevate our choices.",O9pMFJSPg80YVzpMfNikxw,11,9,5,vf2QIjoHq8amSJLRFQ359A

1976782,2018-05-23,0,P2cHq6apwK7z6XPaU24iJQ,"I've been here 3 or 4 times now and it is by far the best vegan ""authentic Mexican"" restaurant in town (and probably outside of town as well). 

My favorite menu item is the pozole with chicken, since it's pretty much impossible to find vegan pozole outside of your own kitchen. The chicken burrito is very good as well. 

I recommend 'chicken' as choice of meat. The carne asada is okay as well.  I personally do not find the ""Hawaiian pastor"" flavor appealing.

They use Daiya sparingly enough (at least in the burrito) to not detract from the overall quality (I am not a fan of Daiya). I assume it is used more liberally in the quesadillas, etc. 

It's nice to have another vegan option in this part of town (Rancho/Cheyenne isn't exactly known for quality food of any sort), and well worth the drive if you aren't nearby.  The value here is also very good, with extremely affordable prices and filling portions.",NgqIyv9Ld8i_rMPaEmGexw,1,1,5,ztbFSMXv46vlharCn86y1A

The menu is a bit small and I had a hard time deciding. I asked for a recommendation and the cashier suggested nachos. I ordered it with asada.
The nachos came out fairly quickly. First sad face is because the cheese was cold, flavorless, and not melted at all. The ""asada"" was more of a cut up sausage. The other toppings were also not very exciting. 
I've had some pretty amazing vegan nachos at other eateries so there's no excuse for some sad ones...and these were sad. 
Service was okay. 
They could use some cleaning. The floors were dirty and sticky with spilled drinks or sauces all over...needed a mopping pretty badly. 
The bathroom was dirty as well. 
It was an okay meal- but not a good one. Definitely not a great one.

4006655,2018-05-30,0,P2cHq6apwK7z6XPaU24iJQ,"I visited Veganos Kitchen for the first time in Memorial Day and I ordered the Chorizo breakfast burrito. It's a huge burrito, 1lb to be exact, and comes at a decent price of 6.99 with freshly fried tortilla chips and two salsas in the side (verde & chipotle).  I added grilled onions to it, even though I probably should've added peppers to bring it some more flair.  It was a good burrito, but I couldn't really tell there was vegan chorizo inside because of the abundance of tofu.  The seasoning was great, not too salty, and maybe the chorizo they use added to that flavor.  

The burrito had just the right amount of greasiness, reminiscent of a traditional Mexican burrito/taco stand. I would have loved more avocado in the burrito and salsa verde on the side. The chipotle salsa tasted watered down and didn't have much flavor, so I didn't bother using it.  I couldn't taste or tell there was sour cream or cheese in the burrito so that's a bit of a drawback.

I'm giving 4 stars because overall it was a good burrito, I received my food very quickly and I had a good conversation with the owner about the establishment.",I0sK3iL3KLakjiWQYx_N0A,3,0,4,nYeYMAInu1VrTQxM3W3Sqw

For anyone who normally has a weak stomach for Mexican food or spicy, don't worry, this place is for you! Very mild seasonings and really no spiciness at all. Very healthy tasting! Great prices! Can't beat that.
The people seem nice enough although there was very little interaction. 
Give them a try!",3VhMhMMwR5Zxq47zhnFaWA,3,3,4,ySKFUX1Gl2sPT8NwnMwkQw

Stopped in this afternoon for some asada tacos (sides of course) & potato tacos! Both had a spicy kick but equally delicious! My gripe was the excessive black pepper on the tacos. Edible but not my seasoning preference.

I'm eager to come back here & try some of the other menu items -- I feel kind of foolish going to what is a (vegan) Mexican restaurant & ordering a (vegan) cheeseburger, but I've been hearing about the ""Beyond Meat"" vegan burger patties for a while, & was anxious to try one.

The place is in a rather dirty little strip mall that has a Savers grocery store & 99 Cent store -- look for them as you're on Rancho Drive & pull-in to that shopping center.    The restaurant is on the other end from those stores, in-between a laundromat & a check-cashing store (which makes for interesting people-watching).   I was there for about an hour, with no other customers.   In terms of area demographics, I do worry about the viability of a vegan restaurant at this location -- it's going to need us happy customers promoting it.   Though it's pretty far away from the areas I frequent, I'll be back, and am eager to take friends there so they can give it a try & help spread the word.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,9,5,4,7GsytcAcvbGRzV-zrsvFXA

But you couldn't pay me to eat here if it was the last vegan restaurant on the planet.

Tried the sopes, the flavor was alright but whatever product they use for the meat -tofu or seitan I'm assuming- wasn't properly dried so it made the meal watery. 

Also, curse on anyone that uses Daiya cheese. That stuff is gross, please get an alternative.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,7,3,1,eRBiIjNDm5hlcpFDyItIJA

Upon placing my to go order, I was told it would take approximately 15 minutes. Thirty minutes later, I received my order of asada tacos, chile relleno, and super fries. 

The taco plate included three asada tacos, Spanish rice, pinto beans, and a soft drink. My husband said they were slightly on the dry side, and the taste was just okay. 

The super fries looked better than they tasted. A little more salt, sour cream, guacamole and cheese would totally take it up a notch. 
 
Lastly, the chile relleno was grilled instead of deep fried. I'm sure it's much healthier this way, but I prefer the traditional way. They were kind of skimpy on the cheese, but made up it with ample sauce. My husband and I could not get enough of the Spanish rice. I personally like to mix it in with the beans.

I ate every bite. The pozole was on point!--totally authentic, reminded me of traditional posole from Mexico. Yummy! My boyfriend loved the asada burrito. He said it was ""true to it's carnivore counterpart"" meaning, you couldn't tell it was vegan. My brother and sister-in-law loved their tostadas and sopas. I'm pretty sure we all licked our plates clean (just kidding!)!

The resturaunt is small, but cute. The painted walls reminded me of Mexican decor. The bathroom was very clean and well-stocked. The cashier/server was very nice and accommoting to our table.

Go see Jose and ask for a chicken style burrito. It was big with beans, lettuce, vegan Daya cheese, delicious slices of chicken tofu, a side of tortilla chips, green and red salsa.

Chips were crunchy and greasy. Guac was fresh and paired well with the salsa verde. I could taste the love in the beans because those beans were unholy.

Last we're the tacos asada which were also very good, a tad over priced compared to the burrito   
Food was a bit slow to come out but was very hot and fresh when it did. Would like to all have real plates and not paper (ones for some dishes).

I got something with each so I can taste them all. 
Their Chicken is the same as the Asada?
It doesn't have a similar texture to either; its more of a ground sausage. And their Pastor tastes like pure pineapple and nothing else.

Although, once you add salsa, it's all good. 
In all honesty, salsa's great and all, but it shouldn't be necessary.
