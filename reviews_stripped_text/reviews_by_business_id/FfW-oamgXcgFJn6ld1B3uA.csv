489279,2013-08-02,0,FfW-oamgXcgFJn6ld1B3uA,"I am a frequent customer and have been for years. I went in one summer day to fulfill my cravings for their famous BBQ chicken with rice to go. Daniel (Danny), who did the order taking, did not offer me a greeting and had a monotone voice. Not even a smile was shown. It was like talking to a robot. He clearly did not feel like being there at all. When my order was ready, my food wasn't sealed properly and was slid from the register area to the end of the counter where I was at. He didn't even offer me a thank you or farewell. I just left right away because I was starving. It wasn't busy at all, only one other customer there.

When I reached home, I opened my to go box and found out there was no rice at all, just the mac salad along with my chicken. I was so disappointed. I went back to l&l to get my order fixed. As no surprise, I received no greeting from Daniel again. I told him about my rice that was supposed to come with my meal. He gave me a ""sigh"" right in front of my face and turned around and scooped rice and placed it in my to go box. No apology was given when he returned the box. Just quickly turned around and went about his business. When I returned home, I opened my box and found a 1/2 scooped rice in my box. Not even a full scoop was given to me after I drove all the way back there. 

It is quite clear Daniel (Danny) isn't paying close attention. Not only is he rude, he is an example who will drive l&l customers away from the restaurant. He ruined my whole experience and I will never come back there. I encourage all l&l customers to stay away from that establishment. I would give this place ""Zero"" stars if I could because of Daniel.

The company should FIRE Daniel. He is not a good example of an L&L employee. The total opposite actually.",1WxG8bZGfOCecx2JllHCBA,3,0,1,XHozNMm6Eo-974meGrnXKw

This place is always clean the cashiers are pretty knowledgeable of what the menu has to offer. In addition to the main menu, there is also a side menu (sharpie board) that offers daily specials and other items not mentioned. 

I'm a huge fan of Hawaiian food and like to try different dishes I've yet to try, and sometimes I feel like some BBQ Chicken, which is what I ordered this time around. The plate sizes that are offered are mini and regular. I always go with the regular, which comes with the main dish (BBQ Chicken in my case), macaroni salad, 2 scoops of which rice and some cabbage. My chicken is always cooked very well, tender and moist. The mac salad and rice were average.

In June we were in town and decided to get lunch/brunch.  This location was very clean and could tell that it's well taken care of. A clean restaurant reassures me that my food is trustworthy to eat! Haha. We were also greeted upon entering and for me that's always another plus for great customer service.

The entrance is clean as well as the inside. I went in and had not a clue what to order. I asked the cashier, which was from the islands as well as the cook; that made me more comfortable ordering because I thought it was going to be someone else of a different ethnicity cooking the food, She recommended me a cheap and inexpensive dish to try out first. So I got that and she gave my mother and I free drinks for the wait. Which wasen't much, but ahh I can't say no...

  I got a macarroni type dish with white rice and hawaiian type pork. It wasen't sweet, or to raw of taste it was real good. The rice wasen't all dry like steamed rice it felt cooked and steamed.

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the workers were very nice. I ordered the half & half combo (chicken & beef) with all rice. I got my food pretty quickly and was ready to conquer this meal I thought would've at least been decent until I opened the box. :-/

The beef was so fatty! It didn't taste that bad but the task of pulling the good part of the meat off of the fat just killed my vibe. The chicken was okay until I bit into a piece that still had the skin attached. Not to mention the rice was mediocre. The $10+ dollars I paid for this was not worth it. The Pepsi was the only highlight from my visit. If you want the real deal Holyfield, drive down to Charleston and stop at Aloha Kitchen.

4451851,2013-10-09,0,FfW-oamgXcgFJn6ld1B3uA,"I've long looked over L&L as an option for eating in my part of the hood. Yes, this L&L happens to be off of Valley View and Nellis Blvd. I decided to pop in there today as I was running errands and because I am on a tight budget right now, I just didn't have it in me to drive myself anywhere else in the valley.

Let's start off with the pro's:

The restaurant is very clean, tables and seating look new or if not, very well taken care of. The service was impeccable, incredibly nice, happy, and genuine. The food came out relatively quickly.

What I ordered:

Curry Chicken Katsu Bowl: Meh. The bowl was almost over halfway filled with rice, very little curry sauce. It could have used A LOT more curry sauce. The veggies were pretty obviously of the frozen variety, topped with those carrots that have the weird ridges on them... I don't know what the appeal of having carrots like that is. I'd rather my food just look like what it is supposed to look like.... no some weird machine-manufactured vegetable. The chicken, although moist, was kind of bready, and not in a good way. 

Spam Musubi: Yum! I really liked it. Perfectly and tightly wrapped, plus just enough sauce and salty spam. I would order this again.

Overall... I like Aloha Kitchen over L&L and AK is closer to my house. I don't think I would completely take this L&L off my list, but it's not high up either. If I go back, maybe I should try the BBQ.... hmm.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,1,3,UUKeOoIfL-pN5qbzDFd34Q

So, I took the orders from my clan and off I went.  No one wanted to leave the house because it was ""too hot"" and they were ""too tired"".  Anyhow, I got to the L & L and I was taken care of.
