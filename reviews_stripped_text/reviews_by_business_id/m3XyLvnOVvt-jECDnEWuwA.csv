The ambience is a bit strange for those unused to Vegas' combined gambling + (insert business type of choice), but the separate dining room is a nice place to enjoy a savory meal. The calamari was great, the crab cakes were fantastic, the chicken cordon blue was delectable, the oso bucco was delicious, and the bananas foster cheesecake was a dream.

662444,2012-04-22,0,m3XyLvnOVvt-jECDnEWuwA,"Repetes just opened 4/9/12 in the old Screwballs location. The inside has been totally redone and it has a small enclosed dining room as well as the bar area. The food is excellent. The owners have been in the restaurant business for many years in Las Vegas/Henderson and are well known for using nothing but the best ingredients and presentation, having attentive and friendly employees and always seem to be around to ensure that everything runs smoothly. The sold their last restaurant to a casino years ago and have just gotten back in the business with Repetes.
The menu is limited, compared to other competitor restaurants, but the attention to quality shows. They grind their own meat for the hamburgers, they bake their own turkey for their turkey  pannini and other turkey dishes. The greek starters are to die for. You have to try the calamari fries !!!!! The greek meatballs are tender tender tender. Hamburgers put everyones elses to shame. Sliders ??? Three different kinds. Tomato bisque ????? Our table ordered one and after tasting it we had to order three more. No frozen french fries here....fresh and perfectly cooked.
The bar area is very nice and they have plenty of different beers on tap. If you are looking for a quick lunch or a nice dinner this is the place to go. The dining room is very well done, quiet, and you can watch the bar area from there. If you want a family dinner, a place to take a date, or just something a little more quiet....this is a really nice place.
This is sure to be a hit with the locals. This is within walking distance of the outlet mall on South Las Vegas Blvd and several of the large time share units. If you want a nice place to eat at a moderate price.....try Repetes you wont be sorry.",8fxwaAFkDWUkqMbLBcnMmA,1,0,5,zFYkQtKJezD_SGxW0aPfHw

However, the food is great! Not your ordinary bar food for sure. They also do some cool games during football season. We won money on the square games. 

The staff is awesome. I think one bartender is named DJ or some two letter name and he is very nice and a good bartender. The people skills do matter in that industry! I forget the girls name, but she is nice too. They are usually bartending together when we go.

1705186,2014-06-19,0,m3XyLvnOVvt-jECDnEWuwA,"I am a Las Vegas local for 7 years now. I have some feedback for your bar/grill. I went to RePete's for the first time toward the end of March. Based on my neighbors recommendation, I had high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! It was very nice inside and noticeably newly remodeled. The staff was very friendly. This was a Sunday right around noon. I came a few other nights, on Tuesday and Thursdays, to meet up with my neighbors who come there often. The bartender, JC, was very friendly and accommodating. I usually put in $100 per trip to play video poker which end up being about 3 times per week. However, Saturday, May 17th around 8pm-10pm, I had a different experience. First off, I was not greeted promptly or very warmly. I wasn't offered a menu. I then put in $20 and ended up hitting a four of a kind. I played for a while and when I needed to get back home, the waitress charged me for one of my two glasses of wine. I find this not the usual ""culture"" of gambling in Las Vegas. As a frequent video poker player, I tend to lose more money than I gain in general. I feel unjustly charged for a glass of wine as I have in the past put in larger quantities of money and lost a lot more. I have heard other patrons with this sentiment as well.

I was hoping to find a neighborhood bar to frequent quite often, but I was very turned off by my last experience. I will continue to play my money elsewhere as will my husband.

Perhaps, if that is your policy, it should be communicated to the patrons. I would have at least had a choice as to buying a glass of wine, leaving or putting in another $20. I felt very uncomfortable with being handed a bill as I expected to get up and go. It was quite embarrassing to me.

Thank you for your consideration.",6BwBCsE-2l_wZJuH85NOzA,3,0,2,gofKRqk-gPie3RUYDWZ8hQ

2358785,2015-09-04,0,m3XyLvnOVvt-jECDnEWuwA,"I'm surprised I finally met one of the worst bartenders in Las Vegas.

I used to come here quite often during grave-shift about a year ago. Today I was driving past with a friend and decided to stop in for some food at about 4pm.

Elisha took our order (Breakfast Burger, Medium Rare, Fries - and Chicken Strips, Ranch, BBQ and Fries).
She took 3 steps from us to the computer - and had to ask what we wanted again. Then turned and asked us about fries - again. No big deal, better she verifies and has our order correctly, right?

The other Bartender (JC? I think was his name) came out with some Chicken Wings and Chips/Salsa. We let him know that was not our order and it must be for another guest. Elisha storms over and says to me ""That is what you ordered."" I said ""I asked for a Breakfast Burger.""  Elisha replies (in a condescending and bitchy tone) ""No, you ordered Chips and Salsa with Sour cream on the side. Thats what you ordered.""
JT just takes the food in back and lets us know not to worry about it and our food will be right up.
Sure enough - 1 min. later, JC has our actual order - which was being cooked.
Elisha came back to let us know that the food that she said ""we ordered"" was actually for a table and they had been at the bar before. - Okay cool - but you don't remember peoples faces? You don't remember that we walked in to a completely empty side of the bar? Most importantly - you don't remember the order you confirmed with us 3 times?

Food was good - as always. RePete's food is awesome. I am fairly certain Elisha put my burger in as ""Well Done"" rather than the ""Med. Rare"" I asked for - as the burger came out ""Well Done"" and the cooks here are normally very good about getting the right burger temp.

Elisha never asked us how the food was or checked in again. We finished eating and asked for our check.

This is where it get's kind of weird....
I place my credit card on the tab - now over the next 20 mins, she walks past slowly (probably 5 or 6 times) - looking directly at my card - but doesn't run it.

Again, JC save's the day and closes us out.

JC was hustling around the bar, I actually counted him serving 8 guests, before Elisha served 1 guest.

I also talked to one of the regulars that is often there at that time - she confirmed that Elisha is always terrible.

Both myself and my friend are bartenders here in Las Vegas - my friend being at a local bar in the same area, myself on the strip. Never have I ever seen one HORRIBLE  bartender (Elisha) drag such a great place down. Kudos to JC for carrying her every shift and having to deal with Elisha pissing people off (and having to split tips with him).

Also - I only know Elisha's name from the receipt - she never gave us her name.

Last time I've checked their Happy Hour was 1/2 pizzas and apps Mondays-Fridays 3pm to 6 pm and midnight to 3am.  And their beers were reasonably prices with a decent selection of craft brews.

If Buffalo Wild Wing, Outback Steakhouse, or any of the other alcohol/food selling businesses are busy and you need a place to go RePete's is just as spacy, not as crammed, and has a better tasting food menu.  I am a fan of their menu though I haven't had everything yet.  It's mostly better than your typical bar food and includes calamari fries which were pretty big pieces, greek meatballs which I was told was their patrons favorites they were OK , nachos which were pretty huge, various pizzas so far all delicious, monte cristo and other sandwiches, salmons and steaks, pasta, etc. 

I've only had one horrible experience with them and that was when they had the hardest time splitting checks and adjusting the prices on the bill when it switched from happy hour prices  to regular prices.  Other then that most of the customer service has been good.

It's your typical bar with another section designated for non smoking diners. We decided to sit on that side since it was much more quiet and we wanted to catch up over food and drinks. 

My friend orders a screwdriver, which you can't really mess up. I order a vodka (Tito's) and water with lime. I get my drink and it had a lemon instead. No biggie. I take a sip, it's ALL water. I let my friend taste it to make sure I wasn't just being a raging alcoholic since I'm used to stronger drinks. She agreed that it had almost no alcohol. Our waitress was super sweet and had the bartender add more Tito's. 

We order our food and I opt for the fish and chips with coleslaw. My friend had the salmon, which she said was good. Mine on the other hand was just eh. The fish had good texture and was moist but the breading just came right off. It was so much breading too that I just ended up with a thin strip of fish. The French fries were undercooked and soggy. The coleslaw was soggy from the beginning, probably because  it was pre-made and had way too much mayo. For dessert, we opted for bread pudding with caramel sauce. This was delicious. It was soft, but not too soggy and wet. And the caramel sauce added just the right amount of sweetness. 

The owner came around a few times to make sure that everything was well. He was this sweet older man and I appreciated the gesture. Our waitress was sweet as well, always coming by to check on us. You could tell this is a favorite spot for locals because the employees knew a lot of customers' names when they walked in. I had a good time here, but Id probably only come here if this was someone else's choice.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,3,3,4v3Zi6Go5v48h0C0qT_Y-g

The bartender recommend the New York steak with the mashed potatoes and the sauce they make there. I can't remember what the name of the sauce was but it was delicious.

The food is great, good portions, fair prices, all house made. But this is Las Vegas. I've lived her 25 years and played video poker everywhere. Today was the first time I was denied one free glass of wine after putting $20 into a machine. It's the industry standard that if you put inat least $20 you get a free drink. I ordered an appetizer and 2 wines, nether of which was comped.

I asked Alicia? the bartender why, and she said it's because I didn't bet max on all my machine plays. ??? Who cares? I still put in $20. This was a first time this happened to me ever in Las Vegas.

I won't be playing there ever again, but might still stop in for a meal. They do have a separate non-smokers dining room, which I recommend.",eACbdNnkPKim79TynjLdRA,5,0,4,8XeQjvheqx1qY1DxTAg4aQ

I've tried the steak tips, pizzas, carbonara, wings, burgers, as well as a few sandwiches and wraps. Of my favorites are the steak tips and carbonara, while the wings were a great value during happy hour but average overall.

The staff here is pretty friendly, though one time we wanted to have the volume turned up on an NBA finals game and they said the locals wanted to listen to the random background music over the game, which was kind of sad considering they have great TVs and it looks like it should be friendly for sports. I understand the fact that regulars have a higher priority but it seemed ridiculous considering how much it looks like a sports bar.

Such was the case the other day when I found myself pulling into a place called RePete's. After all, how in the world are you ever supposed to find this place unless you're lost? All kidding aside, RePete's is the reimagined local joint off the 15 that suffered from being on a road to nowhere, that is until they finally finished the Warm Springs bridge over the interstate last year. Still, it's hard to imagine many people find themselves driving by this place in their day-to-day lives (maybe I'm wrong), which is too bad really because RePete's has some rather delicious food and a very comfortable environment.

During my most recent visit, I was moved to try the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. First of all, any place that offers sweet potato fries is alright in my book, so the sandwich didn't need to accomplish much to win me over. To my surprise, the sandwich was very good; the pickles were crisp and tangy and the piles of meat did not disappoint.

My Husband was immediately turned off, and wanted to turn tail and run.  I assured him that Yelp sent me here and it would be ok.

Upon entering there is a door to the right that says 21 years old.  That is the bar side, and since my daughter is  not 21 for 6 more long agonizing hours, and we don't care for smoke, we chose the door on the left!  The dining room was smoke free, beautifully decorated with hard wood flooring, dark stained wood tables, nice placemats, and candles.   I really liked their high quality cloth napkins.  It is such a small thing, but so often overlooked. 

Now let's get to the reason were here- the food.  In one word AMAZING!  They were offering 4 specials that came with soup or salad, entree and dessert.  My salad was deliciously crisp, with a nice tangy blue cheese dressing.  I really liked that they didn't overdress the salad.  My husband had the same and also liked his salad.   The entree choices were : Chicken Picante, Pork Chops au Poivre, Beef  Tips Stroganoff over egg noodles, and  Tilapia Piccata. 

I had the pork chops, and let me tell you, those were the best pork chops I have ever had in a restaurant.   The sauce was mind blowing!  It was filled with green peppercorns, demi-glacé, brandy, and finished with cream.  It was served with fresh sautéed vegetables, and creamy mashed potatoes.

My husband also couldn't say enough good things about his chicken picante.  It was boneless skinless chicken breasts topped with a mushroom, white wine and cream sauce, also served with veggies and potatoes.

My daughter ordered grilled salmon, with the same sautéed veggies (a nice mix of squash, carrots, onions, broccoli), and potatoes. She was a member of the clean plate club, and  said she would gladly order that again. 

Now here is where things get really exciting! RePete's is a family owned business.  This family happens to be Greek.  Dessert was included in our meal, otherwise we wouldn't have ordered it.  Our server brought out for us this incredible Greek pastry.  It had a flaky phillo dough crust, with a creamy custard topping that reminded me of creme brûlée.  Angels sang at first bite of this pastry.  Between the three of us, this 4""x6"" piece of perfection was gone in a flash.  This praise coming from someone that rarely eats dessert.  Take it from me....order this! 

The best part of all, I didn't mention, this incredible meal was only $15.99 per person!

The service was impeccable, and they saw to our every want and need.  I can't wait to eat here again on our way home from vacation.",87LhHHXbQYWr5wlo5W7_QQ,8,4,5,-uX8XAgi8MClbA5Y1NbBuw

Decided to finally give this place a shot as we had always seen it as we drove down the blvd- what better time then after a random 3-day strip adventure (that involved some *cough* minor drinking *cough* festivities)...

We were in the mood for some good ol' bar food and couldn't have asked for a better experience...

Walked in on a Saturday afternoon and there was only about 6 other people in the entire place, decided to sit at the bar where we were pleasantly greeted by our server. She was a sweet-heart!

Then, the unexpected happened, an older gentleman sitting at the end of the bar came over to greet us:

 ""I just had to come over and say thank you for coming in, and that you two are the best looking couple I have ever had in my bar"" 

The owner, Mr. Pete himself, came over to say hello, and well, I must say he was the classiest older gentleman I've talked to in quite some time! Went out of his way to come say hello and complement us...


We sent a drink over for him to say thanks :)

He then had (the BEST) Creme Brulee Sent over to us at the end of our meal...

Had to say, it was the best Creme Brulee i've eaten in quite some time- perhaps it was the influence from his complement ;) but it really was fantastic- creamy, not too sweet, you could tell it was home-made (even had the fresh vanilla beans).


It was happy hour, so we then decided to give a few a things a shot, Including beer and wine (much needed ;) 

Quesadilla 
Spicy Chicken Tenders with Fries
Greek salad

...Everything was delicious (and so cheap for HH prices) Not greasy either...


And like I said- The Creme Brulee- To die for! (you wouldn't expect this from a small bar off the blvd)...Can't wait to try their actual dinners here. They have quite the extensive menu.


I am so happy we took the time to try this place out. Awesome experience.


We will most definitely be returning very soon- can't believe this place is right around the corner- sorry but no other bar around the area compares for food, prices, cleanliness, atmosphere and experience. 

If you're looking for a laid back place off the strip to grab a drink and some (hangover) grub, definitely stop by and say Hello to Pete if you have the chance ;) You won't regret it! We would come back just to sit down and talk with him again...

They have separated the bar from the restaurant to cater to people who don't want to have to deal with the loud bunch.  Very smart and appealing for the locals.

I arrived before my friend and sat at the bar as I know his crazy ass will probably stick a ""hundo"" in the machine as we chit chat and catch up.  

As soon as I sit down, the owner, Pete (of course that's his name) comes over and says he is so happy to see a pretty young woman at his bar, I've made his day and to enjoy the food.  Pete is the nicest, sweetest, man ever.  He's completely renovated the place (used to be a shit hole, my friend's exact words). REBEL gear everywhere!  Anyway, my buddy orders the $5 ham and eggs and I grab the veggie omelet.  Food is fantastic!  Even the coffee was good, so that tells you a lot about a place.  It really was a great meal and service was fast and friendly. My friend hangs out here all the time and raved about RePete's wings, burgers, and beef tips too. 

After a great meal and hysterical conversation, Pete comes back, asks how our food was. He's so excited now because my friend and I have come in and now 3 young guys (after a round of golf) come in to grub as well. I promise him to tell all you yelpers and facebookers about his place.

For lunch RePete's is nice. I go with vendors often. I like the Yelp coupon and it throws sales people when you get them some discount. The atmosphere and remodel (3ish years ago) make the place nice for business lunches. But not so elegant that you stay away for casual lunches.

I believe I had the turkey sandwich, which was just right - fresh-tasting and not so heavy that I felt like taking a nap afterward.  

And, as I always want to do after a satisfying, I had a smoke.  But, unlike in the Bay Area, where it's illegal to smoke within 20 FEET of a doorway, I was able to sit and enjoy my smoke and another cold one in the comfort of the bar.

I was so tired I didn't want to waste another 30 minutes driving around, so I asked for a refund that I would come in for later. Josh said he'd have to get the refund approved by his manager & if for any reason it wasn't approved, he said he would refund me out of his own tips. A few days later I went back in, ordering another breakfast burrito, assuming that it would be comped. When I arrived Josh recognized me right away.

But still.... OUTSTANDING!  Really.

We're renting a house and are from out of town over the 4th weekend and are only eating at restaurants we cannot eat at where we live.  I found this restaurant on Yelp, read all the reviews and looked at every photo, and convinced the wife we should try it out.

Two warning signs I'm glad we didn't pay any attention to.  First, Open 24/7 was one red flag.  Second was the bar-side casino.  Ignore those!  When you walk in the front door you have two options; go right into the bar side which has smoking and gambling, or go left into the non-smoking dining room.  We chose to go left as I was with 2 children.

The dining room side seats about 40 people total, is warm yet modern feeling with nice tables and chairs.  We sat in the chairs a while and never got uncomfortable.  Plus, everything is new and sturdy... no wobbly tables needing a sugar packet under one leg.

There are TV sets on in the dining room with the sound off.  The Muzak is piped in but very soft.  Just about perfect.  Mostly it played 70's popular music (Boston, etc...).  Easy to tune out or listen to if you like the song.  You can also see through the glass window separating the bar and dining room if you're not facing the TV sets and can view 4 others that way if a sporting event is on that you're interested in watching.

Our waitress Edna was awesome.  She just needed a little help.  Or maybe we showed up along with everyone else around the same time.  No big deal... we put on our patience caps and just enjoyed the music.  Edna was exceptionally friendly and seemed to know everything about the menu as well as the chef and owners.  She did a great job of filling us in.

The food!  Well, it was 10:30am and we weren't interested in Breakfast so I asked if we could look at the lunch/dinner menu.  No problem!  I also had a beer.  Don't judge we're on vacation.

I had the Greek Meatball appetizer with fries and I believe tzatziki sauce (it was white and good).  We also ordered the House Special Beef Tips, Chicken Parm and Chicken Piccata.  The food was 5-Star all the way.  I'm serious.  Our dinner the night before on the strip at a steakhouse was $400 for four and this food was better.  We were all quite shocked at the quality this early in the morning when they're cooking breakfast for most people.  I read the reviews and knew it was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good!

The fries are crazy good and every meal came out piping HOT.  The chicken piccata was cooked perfectly, was as moist as chicken can get, and the sauce with capers was incredible.  The Greek meatballs are great, as was the Chicken Parm (with penne noodles).  The steak on the House Special Beef tips is so tender and good I can't believe they don't charge more for the meal.  You can get a sauce on the side with this meal also for dipping which is really good, but not needed at all.  The steak flavor and tenderness was better than the $60 Tomahawk Ribeye I had the night before.

Everyone wants to go back.  Our rule on vacation is never eat at the same place twice but we may break that rule.  Plus if the service is better I can upgrade this to a 5 star review which it was this place deserves.

My husband and I went to RePete's for happy hour on a Friday evening after work. We had a great time all-around. I must say that it did help that we won $400 after randomly deciding to play keno.

First, the service is spectacular. There was a good sized crowd there, with a few large parties, and the bartenders were on it! Drinks were refilled quickly, guests were greeted promptly, and everyone was all smiles. Plus, since I sat at the bar, I must mention I was impressed with all the side work both bartenders and barbacks did in-between taking care of patrons. They were ALWAYS working but attentive to guests and that is a big plus in my book.

I read from previous reviews that the bar is owned by an older gentleman and his wife. They were both present during our visit and were busy greeting customers and serving food. I have a big affinity towards locally owned businesses and an even bigger bias towards ""older people"" who own local businesses (similar to a love and admiration for puppies and chubby babies).

The 50% off appetizers and pizzas during happy hour was a big plus for the hubby. He ordered fried zucchini and pepperoni pizza. It was great (I stole some bites).

I opted for the shrimp bisque pasta and it seemed as though that wasn't a popular choice ( the server had me show her where it was on the menu). I definitely liked it but not as much as the pizza.

We are definitely coming back.  The menu had a lot of things on it that sounded great and we want to try them all.

I would definitely recommend RePete's for my company's next happy hour excursion. The entire experience was worth repeating (no pun intended).",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,0,0,4,LqOSr0Hp22623ft-zNjfjg

I had the grape leaves here and they were very good to my surprise. The building has been renovated and the interior is very modernized. There is a separate area for table dining and the bar as well, which makes it a great place if you don't want be in the bar type of atmosphere. If you're looking for a place a little out of the ordinary I would suggest trying it out.",ROXy7nX-Z1S11btsuQRl8g,2,2,3,o5o8b1Y-wCccdNKrYEH8EQ

In a town of overpriced restaurants with overrated food, it is always nice to find a place where you can enjoy generously-poured drinks and tasty finger food...and not have to break the bank.

I come here for their happy hour specials which offer half priced appetizers and pizza, as well as a steep discount on drinks. Do not miss their greek meatballs (you are in for a tasty surprise), their meaty buffalo wings and chicken nachos... they are all to die for. And what about their service? You will be delightfully surprised  by a staff that is happy, upbeat and ready to welcome you to their establishment after a hard day's work!",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,0,0,5,djf7oyJ-6oxSL0-W1n8BTg
5513418,2013-07-01,1,m3XyLvnOVvt-jECDnEWuwA,"RePetes is a cool little video poker bar on Warm Springs just off of Las Vegas Blvd.  I met fellow Yelper Loren for lunch and, this was a place that we both agreed on.  They have a huge parking lot and the space inside was pretty spacious as well.  We walked in and found a place to sit in the bar itself.  They also had a side room away from the bar, which may have been the move to make, because the bar allows smoking.  That is something to consider if I come back here again.  Anyhow, we sat down and eventually ordered.  Our waitress, who is also the bartender, was great.  She gave us time to look at the menu and was cool when I got a little picky.  

I ordered the Spinach salad which came with Chicken and hard-boiled egg.  I also asked for the dressing on the side.  The salad also came with toast, but I stayed away from the extra carbs.  

As we were waiting for our order to come up, we were hit with a little bit of smoke.  It wasn't so bad but, I would rather not deal with it while having lunch.

The meal wasn't bad and our waitress came to check on us a couple of times to make sure we were good.  

So, I'm a fan of this place.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,1,0,4,xmb65QWV9fgh06BkdKb4qA

5583257,2012-12-21,1,m3XyLvnOVvt-jECDnEWuwA,"I have been eating at some of the best and some of the worst restaurants for as long as I can remember (some 44 years).  Sometimes you get jaded and don't believe you will ever find a true gem anymore.  There is always some knockdown. Either it is too pricey, too pretentious or they simply don't know how to cook.  Rare is it you find a place where the food is great and they make you feel at home.

So, ignore the fact that this has a large bar and gambling area.  What place in Vegas doesn't.   From the moment I arrived, thanks mainly to the many positive reviews here on yelp, I felt the love.  Pete, the owner, greated me at the door, and ushered me into the dining area, sealed off so the smoke can't get in.  There was a graduation party going on in the same room and the owner assured me they were a quiet group but to let him know if there was a problem.  There wasn't.

Our waitress was immediately over to our table to provide menus.  My daughter was hungry but my wife wasn't there yet and the waitress took her order and was happy to alter the menu to fit her tastes.  

ASIDE - if your gps is out of date you might end up near Green Valley for some reason.  This restaurant is right by the 15 and Las Vegas Blvd near Tahiti Village.

Our waitress (why didn't I ever get her name) was friendly, fun, and made us feel very welcome, even during the delay waiting for my wife.  When my wife finally arrived after her adventure in Henderson, we selected some menu items with plenty of help from the waitress who guided us in the right direction.

When my wife ordered a drink that was not what she thought it would be (chocolate cake martini) the bartender came out, got a better idea of what she was looking for and brought her a well prepared chocolate martini.  I tried the Pineapple Cake which was excellent and the blueberry martini which was also good.

For food we ordered a house salad side portion, a shrimp cocktail, greek meatball appetizer, surf and turf and pork chops.

The salad was excellent.  The dressing was fabulous and I don't usually like dressing.  The meatballs were superb with a hint of mint in the sauce.  Four large greek style meatballs and a handful of fries could have been a meal for some.  My steak was cooked perfectly, something I am very worried about when I am in a place that doesn't specialize in steak.  The shrimp cocktail was all about the shrimp with large fresh tasting shrimp and a bowl of cocktail sauce.  (I hate the places that waste greens no one eats for the purpose of hiding the smallish shrimps they try to pass off as edible so this place gets 5 stars for the shrimp cocktail).  The surf and turrf came with shrimp scampi (I am not normally a scampi fan) with just the right amount of butter and garlic to please the palate.  The mashed potatos are every bit as good as the waitress advertised.  My wife's pork tasted fantastic and she is looking forward to having it for lunch today as well.  

The portions are reasonable.  They aren't so huge that you will have dozens of leftovers but rather they are the right size so you don't go hungry and might even have a treat left over for the next day.  
 
As for prices, you couldn't ask for more reasonable prices in this economy.  My surf and turf was 17.95 and that was the most expensive thing on the menu.  The martinis were a reasonable $7.00 each compared to as much as 14 in most of the restaurants on the strip.

We got a present of greek cookies from Pete who came out and shook our hands and shared his story of his former restaurant in Boulder City called Pete's.  Hence the name RePete's.   I know I have mentioned it several times already but the service here, especially our waitress really was excellent.  She handled every question and request with a smile, a detailed explanation and really made us feel at home.  It was a pleasure meeting Pete and I hope he sits down with us next time we come to share more stories.  We will be back soon and often.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,8,4,5,E6gpFj4cnFpWP2ZHvuZdnw

This is a solid little bar with super friendly service and a decent drink selection. I had a Deschutes on tap and a $4 mimosa afterward (during-football special). We split 2 sliders and homemade chips for $5. The sliders were juicy and the chips were awesomely thin & crunchy! There were a bunch of Penn State fans in there watching football, and they seemed happy. No bar games like pool, darts, or shuffleboard, and no jukebox that I can see, so one star off for that, but other than that, you should have a nice time if you visit for drinks, during or not during a game!",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,3,1,4,SIaLwo8dQ4p9Hza4ipVCJw
