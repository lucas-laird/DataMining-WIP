20582,2016-01-06,0,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,Hands down the best filipino restaurant in town. My family and a few friends went on a wekend trip to Las Vegas and craved for filipino food at one point. We heard this place was good so we decided to try it and it definitely did not disappoint. The cebuchon is to-die-for and all their desserts are a must have. will definitely come back for more to try try out the other scrumptious items on the menu.,AR85pHfGrSek6Z9-xCyubg,0,0,5,7_bovKRumHlW9OI3ZjX6FA

Lechon lunch plate - tired pieces of pork ...probably  from the day before. Very small portion compared to most.

Sisig - waaaaaay to greasy.  Felt like I just chugged a small bottle of crisco and even more left on the sizzle plate. ..ugh

Mungo - watery...eh

Desserts on counter near register had mold spots growing in it...wth? 

Many other places to go to get a more satisfying meal.",bGUs2VtGoIj2ri_5hNSh-g,5,1,1,RIuYS68kuOVs1VBWsWjm2g

Our friend who resides in Las Vegas is retiring and so we planned to give him a retirement party and one of this venue was to have lunch on arrival date April 2.,2016. Since they are residents of Vegas we let them choose the place to eat and they suggested this place because its new and the tried the food and was ok and to patronize filipino Resto.They spoke with Rose and they advised Rose that there will be around 20 of us mostly from California and the were assured by this woman Rose that there will be no problem.When we got there some of our friends were already eating and we noticed there is a divider between the restaurant and us and so we thought that was nice for the restaurant owner or manager to give us privacy .. as were eating some our friends noticed that the food outside at the buffet was different and better from our food and so we asked if we could get food from the buffet and we were told no. the food they served us was a tray of spring rolls , a tray of some meat with sauce, greassy pancit and cold and tough lechon kawali... I only ate 3 pcs f spring roll and a piece of kawali cause it was too hard and tough. No soup or salad and the dessert was  ginatan sago.When we got the bill itwas almost $900 ..Whaat!!! to make the long story short we wer told that the room was private and the food for $600 for 21 ppl plus th drinks and $120 tip..The manager was not around and the lady who was in charge kept on calling Rose. We disputed the price because 1) we asked for buffet only which we told $11.99 per peson on weekend (2)we did not asked for a private room . we were asking for the manager who never showed up . we didnt want to embarrased our host and our retiring friend who was very upset already so we just paid the bill . the ladywas told by this Rose to waived the Tip.. We ended up paying $521.06(for the food and room rental)what a hack and robbery .so they ended up charging us $25 per person..the only good with this visit was the server they assigned to us was bubbly and sweet and very attentive so we gave her tip.. We are from California and visit LV always.. and by the way there was no contract signed . ts ok Karma is coming for this Restaurant..",rqQmL8A9a53tB3NcOB4PeQ,1,0,1,prUXjIcS8kb0DSuPZlzZNg

We were so happy at first but some  of our group were complaining why our food selection was different from outside of the room we were in, about 3 weeks ago, 3 of our classmates went to this restaurant and inquired how much would it cost per head for the lunch buffet. they we told $10.99/person and according to them they were promised to have privacy for our group. so were happy , we got there, saturday 1200, still happy seeing our friends and exchanging pleasantries until we asked for our check and cant believe what we saw. $700+ for that kind of food and place for 21 people? The lady in charge said because we got the package for $599 for 50 people plus $200 for the room giving us privacy. nobody had seen this contract, it was a verbal contract between the 3 of our Las Vegas friends and a  lady named Rose in the restaurant, who happened to be not there that day of our event. That food and place is not worth for what they have charged us. We won't pay that bill so they came down to $521.06 because were descent people, we agreed to pay the room for $200 and $10.99/ per head for the food but the lady said since its a weekend its $11.09/head, drinks $22.50. This was not even made clear to us regarding the drinks. Anyways, this is very bad and poor management. We will never go back to this place ever again.This is a warning for those who intend to make such reservation like us, be very clear with them, otherwise you will get big surprises! What we had paid is not worth it, we could just have gone to Aling Lorraine's Restaurant . we were there 2 years ago and we had a great time, so many choices. we like to try this new place but we were so disgusted.",g4klj0ARFQKqrjh0G7k4VQ,0,0,1,dTMO5r9HsbN8lnKs0ijs5w

468910,2016-03-31,1,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,"It was Easter and decided on Filipino food in our neighborhood.  We had a party of 6 and they automatically charged 18% gratuity.  We ate the buffet $10.99 pp which was mostly pork dishes; Pork sinigang, pork sisig, Lechon, dinuguan, pork and opo vegetable, pork caldereta.  They had Kare Kare 2 hrs earlier when we passed by but the lady said they weren't making anymore.  My husband really wanted it so he ordered the a la carte menu.  Kids ordered the halo halo and found a hair in it! We brought this to the attention of our server and another lady came out and asked, ""do you want me to bring another one?"" We said absolutely not, and did not offer a refund right away.  We all lost our appetite at this point.  She asked to see the hair and we had a look of disgust and asked why, and she said so she can find out who's it was!  We gave her the napkin and she left.  Later we went to get fruit and noticed they had a full tray of Kare Kare in the buffet area.  Wow we just finished ordering the Kare Kare for $12.99 and they did not offer a refund.  I as a Filipina thought the food was okay, Kare Kare was probably the best dish.  Service was ok, not deserving the automatic 18% for sure.

Also tried the BBQ Pork Kabob... too fatty... 

Flan (dessert) is cheap... but it's also small

Their are some KEY Filipino dishes missing from the menu in my opinion, like the 'beef stew' type dish... which I've seen at almost ALL Filipino places. I also didn't see much of a fish selection...

Food was OK, but nothing memorable  About 10-minutes after leaving, both of us started to become quite sleepy and nauseated.  Signs that they use MSG in their food.

Fast forward to this past Wednesday night.  .We decided to eat dinner here since they are now offering $8.99 buffet.  We were in the area, wanted Filipino food and figured that we would try them once more.  

While the service was very good, I cannot say the same for the food.  Some choices were OK, most were not.  After only eating 2-plates, I had had enough.  On the drive home, both my wife and I felt very uneasy.  You can literally taste the MSG that they use.  If they cooks feel they need to pack it in the food and not let the flavor of the food shine through, maybe it's time to change your recipes.  

I have stayed in the province where they don't have strict sanitary regulations like the USA and never once have i gotten sick.  There are a lot of better choices than Cebu Inasal.  If you want to eat MSG laden food and get sick, this is the spot for you.

I was curious on how they would apply what they have learned at Panda. Second, I am about to visit Cebu in two weeks. I would like to have a glimpse of the menu.
We arrived at 1:45PM at Cebu Inasal. Their were two female food servers and a male server. The male server approached us, seated us down then gave us the menu. Few minutes later, he took our beverage and food orders. People who came in after us were served their beverages first. Our server was still busy taking other orders from other customers. It was difficult to find the servers coz they enter the kitchen, will be gone for a few minutes, then they come out chewing. I guess, they're working on their lunch break.
We ordered the Family 1. The meal was served before the sauces. So we were staring at the foods, getting cold, while waiting for the sauces. Their was no anticipation on the part of the server. The pancit and egg roll were good. The Lechon was too fatty. Grease was dripping as I picked a piece up from the serving plate. The chicken was dry and it was lean as if it came from the ditness center next door. We always had to get the attention of the servers. My kids were so disappointed that they did not even want to try any of the dessert. I asked for the check but It was already past 10 minutes and the check wasn't even handed to us. My kids went to the car while I waited for the check the second time around. My server has just take an order from the table next to us so I asked him for the third time.

I would order the BBQ sticks to go as that was tasty.  My husband got the tapsilog which was okay but the portion you get is bigger at DT's down the street so why not go there plus they have a bigger menu selection.

The main reason I am not a fan is because while I was going to order noodles, the waitress asked if I wanted lechon which is what there specialty is so gave that a try instead, cause who doesn't love lechon! I'd have to say worst lechon I have ever had!  It was served on a banana leaf with rice which a nice touch but it was so oily that my rice was soaked in too much oil.  I couldn't even eat the skin. Normally it's crispy even hard but still good, but theirs was way too hard and rubbery/chewy.

The food was very good. The sinigang was different from the typical sinigang I have had at home and in restaurants but a good different, a very good different. The portions are large and adequately priced. 

The service was super friendly and inviting. I had read a couple reviews about the horrible service but I did not encounter that at all.  Its going to be a toss up between Cebu and DTs now since they are both next to my house.

Of course we had to try the lechon baboy Cebu style because my Asawa is from Cebu. They have a regular order that comes with rice for $10.99 or you can order a 1lb of lechon for $15.99 without rice. We decided to order the regular order with rice and Caldereta. The waitress told us the Caldereta doesn't come with rice. Anu ba yan! Bakit walang kanin! That was what I really wanted to say. Everybody knows you can't have Ulam without rice. Oh, and the cost for the Caldereta without rice was $10.99 and the portion was small. As for the lechon it was tasty but maybe 6 oz of pork belly. 

I will give it a couple of months before we come back and see if they make some changes. The only Filipino place that is more expensive is Max's. If your prices are going to be expensive than at least make the portions big enough to share.",xczZYPorpzE8AqhNSJsJEA,10,2,3,MaLtzdxgawwioa4MGx1Gcg

We ordered the lumpia Shanghai, dinuguan, chicharron bulak, pork bbq on a stick and pancit Bam-i. 
The bbq on a stick and pancit were both delicious. However when we placed our order for the lumpia , we asked how many pieces in an order. We were told twelve. When my mom picked up the order, they showed her what we had ordered, she counted 9. Their excuse was it's because the pieces were cut big. My mom, didn't bother to say anything. But excuse me, if the lumpia was cut into the twelve pieces, they would have been only one bite lumpias. Regardless, that should have not been an excuse.
Next up, the chicharron bulaklak, we asked for it to be extra crispy. What we got was crumbs, maybe 5 small pieces of soggy chicharron soaked up will oil. 
The dinuguan, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.

I will revisit Cebu Inasal, and after enough tries, I'll update both of my reviews here and at DT's. Due to the lack of other Filipino resturants in this area, i'd probably give Cebu Inasal 4.5 stars if I could.

The Inasal Chicken BBQ (inasal na monak) is delicious!!! I'm going to try the pork one next time. It's an herbal type bbq flavor.

The BBQ pork on a stick was delicious, this one a tiny bit sweeter than the Inasal chicken above.

The kare kare could of used more peanut flavor, but i'm not sure if traditionally it's less peanut-y.

The Buko Pandan was decent, it was my first time trying this dessert.

While I was eating, a bunch of the staff came in and out of the kitchen. It definitely looked like all Filipinos. I am not Filipino myself, so I can't tell you if this food is traditional or not, but it was delicious!

Hostess accommodation upon entering? Negative rate. As per sign says, wait for the hostess to be seated yet no one actually will be there to direct u to your seat. (So, it's like seat where ever you please)

3915910,2015-03-07,0,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,":::First Generation Filipino perspective:::
Price:::: 
over priced for the portion they give. The Lechon and Sisig were $12 each. It feeds one person. The waiter said it feeds 2-3 people. I did not think it could feed 3 people. Maybe 2 people if they don't each much. Or I could be fatty. I'm around 5'4, 130lbs. I don't eat much and I thought this was ridiculous.
Waiter Service: Great, I was greeted at the door. Help was given when asked or every 8 minutes. The manager was friendly too. Everyone gave a friendly welcome. It's most likely because they just opened, but check it out for yourself. They speak Tagalog
Food Quality:::: 
The food can taste very good or just lame depending on what you get.
-My choice: Lumpia, Sisig Bangus, Lechon Kawali. The Lechon Kawali was 60% meat and 40% fats. The portion was bad enough, then they try to make it look like a lot was worse.
-Lumpia just tasted bland, the sauce was sour. I highly recommend a sweet and sour sauce if they want to improve. Sisig Bangusand Lechon Kawali tasted great. I don't recommend the lumpia.
Recommendation:::: 
I would not come back, unless the price drops for what they are worth without cutting the portions (from $12 to $8 for either Lechon Kawali or Sisig Bangus). This is why a lot of Filipino's cook at home, because they can cook it better and get a cheaper price. Sure, you are paying for labor, but the price is still too much in comparison to other Filipino places like Fiesta Filipina.",vOaSzGQD1kG7AEmy5IvZOQ,0,0,2,yL-K2bsLVrgp4syCmqsZkA

5206417,2015-03-08,1,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,Let me start with the lechon Manok. You're better  of buying the 5.99 rotisserie at  Albertson's  or Costco. This chicken is dry as a popcorn fart! And whoa! Are we on a bbq sauce drought in this restaurant? A whole chicken ( does not even look like a whole chicken) and they gave us a teaspoon of sauce! The mongo is so soggy creamy looking more like a gravy for a biscuit. ( that's a scary thought) Thank goodness the bam-I is somewhat tolerable. I gave it 2 star 1 star for the water and 1 for the servers smile. Recommendation? No go! Sorry inasal :),fiA6ztHPONUkmX6yKIXyHg,2,0,2,uA_oyVC-qlyPbtVR12GlSw

The Lechon Kawali was nice and crispy and I really enjoyed the sauces that came with it.  The staff was friendly and got me my order in a timely manner. Since Cebu is on my way home from work,  I'll definitely be back soon.",sQv5JZiNBgQ_5Ah3nv9VBw,1,0,5,mTeWlPyd2cLD_pxzGxNt7Q
5316479,2015-03-24,0,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,"I'm giving them 4 stars just because in my opinion they're the best tasting Filipino Restaurant that I've ever tried here in LV. (2nd Salo-Salo, 3rd DT, 4th Max's). Service is awesome too. The only couple of things that are keeping them from getting the 5 stars from me are #1, the price is a little stiff for the portion they serve. #2, I know that they want to serve their food fresh from the kitchen, but damn! I don't want to wait for 30 to 40 minutes for the food, and they don't serve all the orders at the same time. I could've finish my meal before my parents' orders came out from the kitchen. Just saying... I've been there twice and everything I've tried so far taste really good.",D4t_ygMsSEYeJt9VZrW6_g,2,0,4,VIx4WIKxMo7i2JRcNZHCwQ
5400729,2015-03-15,1,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,"Went here for dinner last week on recommendation of a friend, but sadly, we were very disappointed with the food.  The staff is very friendly and respectful, but it took them forever just take our order.  We asked for water, and the water tastes like bad tap water straight from an unfiltered faucet.  We ordered the lumpia Shanghai, Pinakbet, and pork sisig.   None of our dishes came with rice, so we had to order that separately.  The Pinakbet was probably the dish that tasted remotely decent.  The lumpia was not cooked thoroughly enough...the skin was not crispy and still white and rubbery, and the filling was a little rare.  The worst was the pork sisig.  The flavor was not bad, but it was so oily...like a big bowl of the thick grease they use on cars.  My husband, who usually will eat food no matter what because he doesn't like to waste, was so disgusted.  We both felt sick afterwards...like our arteries were clogged up!!!  Will not return ever.",cDc_MPDt2QbuzUGXzLVMEg,0,0,2,DCmxxSqzkm_JaBJBNQZzqQ
5404504,2015-05-18,2,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,"I am very disappointed with the fact the they use the words ""Cebu Inasal."" First, they are serving more of the traditional Filipino food than what Cebu is known for. So they really need to drop Cebu from their name cause they are capitalizing on the idea but when you go there it's just another Filipino restaurant (that's not as good). Oh, and none of them even speak Cebuano. It's like going to a Japanese restaurant and everyone speaks Spanish. Okay, maybe not that bad but because I'm Bisaya, that's how I felt. Second, they seem to fail on the idea of inasal. Their chicken inasal is horrible. They also need to lower their prices. They are not that good to be charging those high numbers. On the positive note, I did enjoy their lechon. Not the best but better than most places. It was the right tenderness and saltiness to it. Skin needed to be more crispy though.",Gefa8xiAGh-VZa9maOyuQg,4,2,2,KErBDGbv3HsiELHsEyipKA

I've been here 3-4 times for lunch, and each time their service has been great.  Can't say how busy it gets for dinner though.  My parents really like it.

5775094,2015-10-06,2,shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,"Came here 10/5/15 for late lunch early dinner... Around 4ish. I was craving Filipino food so bad! I decided to come to this place because it's nearby to where I live. The inside of this restaurant is very clean and nice! Especially compared to a lot of other Filipino restaurants I've been to (others are mainly cheap/decent looking) kinda similar to how maxs look like. 

I ordered the kare Kare, fried bangus, and some garlic rice. The Kare Kare was very peanut buttery which is what the boyfriend & I like very much! The broth was thick and not watered down. It had that very beautiful caramel color not that ugly brown/gray color that some Kare Kare have. It had lots of flavor without the bagoong. I felt like it didn't really need it! That says a lot because a lot of Kare Kare needs that bagoong for the flavor. Kare Kare 10/10 
The fried bangus was alright. They gave the soy sauce sauce for it. I was expecting more of a marinated fried bangus like the traditional bangus. It didn't have much flavor unless you dipped it in the sauce. Bangus 7/10
Garlic rice was nothing to really rave about. But just ordinary rice with some cooked garlic chips on top. I wish it had more of a garlic flavor to it. Garlic rice 7/10. The food took no longer than 10minutes to come it. So that was great.

I see a lot of reviews on how they lack customer service but I had a good experience eating here my very first time. I think it's because it was a Sunday and they didn't have much customers. I'm definitely going to come again! I can't wait to try their other dishes.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,4,2,4,59tbdb7FT2R3ozD_GrcR1w
