2057,2015-04-07,0,QMPDsRxHmDtap9ECO1Uwjg,"OK, let me start out by prefacing the fact that I've ordered from here several times along with my co-workers (upon their recommendations) and the food was generally pretty good. I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. 

As for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. 

My co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. 

The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.",HtxS3TMKjzlCQINL9FAgzg,0,0,2,ZITCVOZ-2n1h7ICsHwJSmA

My wife had the Meatball sub. The sauce was bland, the meatballs nothing special and the bread was, well, bread.

I ordered the Fish and Chips... Standard fish, a bit on the breaddy side. But no chips... coleslaw instead. After looking at the menu again, it specifically says fries come with the meal.

Ravioli was dry and short on marinara and they completely forgot the marinara for the garlic knots. Maybe they were running low tonight??

1781327,2015-07-19,1,QMPDsRxHmDtap9ECO1Uwjg,"This place doesn't look like much- in fact, even armed with the Yelp app directions, I drove past it. The exterior just says PIZZA & RIBS, instead of the actual business name. That said, now that I've found it, I'm not going to forget. 

There's currently a Yelp deal up, $10 for $20 credit. They also have $5 discount codes for ordering online. Either of these can be combined with their super-low lunch special prices. And even the lunch portions are enormous! So far, I've yet to find anything that isn't tasty.

RIB TIPS: The favorite dish so far, an entire takeout box packed full of meaty pieces, and better than many of the crappy barbecue spots here in town. $10
PHILLY SANDO: Lunch special is a hefty sandwich packed with meat and grilled veggies, plus a side of fresh fries, for about $8. This easily makes two lunches for me.
WINGS & FRIES: Their sauce choices are few but the wings themselves are large and meaty, and even the meal comes with ~12 pieces. Not sure how many come in the bucket or half bucket, but this is a generous portion. Bonus points for offering a Cajun flavor that is actually a sauce instead of a dry rub!

Service is friendly and fast. Location is a small and messy takeout counter with no seating available. Majority of their business is delivery.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,3,3,X1DMBT_3ExFtT03bv3LMBg

I feel like my bread on my BLT was either too toasted or stale because it was hard. I was REALLY unimpressed with the potato salad. For one, when I asked the girl if it had raw onions, she told me it was store bought. So they don't even make their own potato salad. Not only that but they hardly gave you any! A very small scoop! Which I'm not really complaining about now since it tasted disgusting like it was made with miracle whip. Over all I will not be going here again.",8Du6H0CmY-PrNBiQXhacRw,4,0,2,t0jbo6cMkE1K0xYhwbwdJA

I had them Cajun style and it was BOMB!!! They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The Cajun flavor was perfect. A little on the non-spicy side but overall delicious! This place is very close to home so I'll definitely be going back.",a8PGFEPGJD5SbA-LBtXG0w,0,1,4,Nb2GPqrQRC4WRmkBPUHhXQ

4883977,2015-08-27,0,QMPDsRxHmDtap9ECO1Uwjg,"On a good day, the fries are perfect, the burgers are delicious and I'm stuffed. We haven't had any good days in  a while.

This place can make some delicious food, but lately it has been terrible. The fries were way over cooked, the club sandwich only had turkey, and the bread changes EVERY SINGLE TIME we order it. 

I love my lazy days and being able to just order a yummy hot meal from my laptop, but this place is so incredibly inconsistent lately, I won't be ordering again.

Positves: Delivery drivers are nice. Customer service is decent. They just need to figure out how to make the same dish the same way  every time. 

It's time to find a new restaurant.",Xl5XQIfXmyQdLOptC39VWQ,2,0,2,YWxI4gqIK3RYte-AtaOe3A

The place is decent prices due to low overhead and in a very small unit. 

They should demolition the crappy gas station next store that closed down 2 yrs ago and expand so they'd be a more legit restaurant and off a lot more food with seating.",keBv05MsMFBd0Hu98vXThQ,2,3,3,k8MqmJEHVT3KNa1shyFOZg

They've got really big chicken fingers and great prices on their lunch specials. I have been ordering from them for years. Not sure if the ownership is the same as then, but I still enjoy the deals. This place also has large party pack kinda deals so I'm sure it'd be great if you had to quickly feed a family for an affordable price. They're most own for the pizza and fried stuff, but their salads aren't bad either. The pizza isn't my favorite, but it's still pretty good. I prefer their buffalo style chicken fingers. Don't expect to sit down if you go to the location. It's sorta like a Dominos, standing room only for takeout items.",AvcQo82bTnF_mOeKNw8HnA,1,0,4,1QrovEW5F1wB8r9RRvEKCA
