Some of the best and biggest sandwiches you'll ever have. I recommend the old favorite ""Surfin' Bird"" or if you're feeling like something really different try the ""Woody"" or the ""Pig Kahuna"". Everything here is amazing. You can't go wrong. Also, if you like good beer, try ""Eye of the Hawk"". This is one of the coolest locations I've ever been to. Lots of seating, including a large outdoor area that is great for lounging. They also have a few TV's, darts and beer pong available.",gMxiEex7G-M4amecZls5Yg,0,0,5,zq6FXPFuToDxV2Q8uyRXoQ

229484,2013-02-18,2,q4v-I9j1v7WqtxR12uEMxQ,"Ate at this spot this afternoon after seeing mostly favorable reviews on Yelp. For a quick summary: I could not have possibly been more disappointed. 

The menu looked fantastic, but a bit overwhelming.  The decor was cool and everything smelled great. I went with a pastrami and turkey on a French roll with pepper jack, chips and a fountain drink. 

The Co2 was out in the soda machine, so I went to the cashier to let her know, and to request a bottled soda instead. After waiting 5 minutes for someone to talk to, I gave up and just took the soda. 

I then waited outside for 20 minutes (literally) before going in to ask about my sandwich.  One of the employees apologized for the delay, which was cool, I get it things happen. He offered me a bag of chips to compensate for the delay, which was also cool but I'd already purchased (and finished) a bag. 

After 5 more minutes my sandwich came, and wow. The pastrami was so bland I'd swear it was roast beef. The turkey was decent, but it's almost impossible to mess that up. I asked for mayo and mustard, and received about a liter of each, globbed into the connected part of the roll. I had to rip about 1/3 of the bun off to use as a condiment squeegee in order to make the sandwich edible. Forced down the remainder and left as disappointed as my parents every time I brought home a report card. 

Cost for my terrible sandwich, soda and a bag of chips? $15 bucks, which was about $17 bucks too much. 

I'd love to say I will give this place another shot since it's so close to my home, but after the trifecta of bad service, bad food, and overpriced, I highly doubt it.",9RJenjlNSdzFqM-sW-asbA,1,0,1,3oj29RqWmKTIevDxoq0oNg

I love me some Panera, Capriotti's, Port of Subs, Firehouse, and even Subway. This is the Rolls Royce of Sandwhich shops! Great portions, amazing and fresh toppings.  The service is great, they are all so pretty ;) 

I had tha Santa Cruz which is pastrami, avocado, bacon and cream cheese, and I'm pretty sure angel dust. It was heavenly! I can't wait to go back. 

My co-worker had the Haole Cheese Steak which is hot roast beef, Monterey jack, cream cheese, onions and peppers with a special spicy marinade, and nearly had to change his pants from excitement...

He had the super salad, which wasn't really that super since it was lacking in toppings. The only protein on this salad is edamame and there were only 5 of them. The rest of the toppings seemed sparse compared to the amount of lettuce that was included. I got the Cabo salad, which had a good amount of toppings and chicken. It was a typical taco style salad. The tortilla chips on it seemed a little old and stale. We could have gotten tastier, better quality salads at Panera for a little less money. We thought that the salads were a little over priced for what you actually get. The restaurant itself has a really nice beach feel with cool decor and surf music.

The first time I tried Beach Hut I was on vacay in Reno. I had major sammich withdraws until they opened up this location. 

Beach hut really knows how to make a proper sammich, like the kind that barely fits in your mouth. I can't seem to get away from my plain and boring turkey and provolone even though I really want to try the Beach Meat Ball, and the Spicolli. My boyfriend is ridiculously picky about his sammiches, and this place nails it for him every time! 

Along with a great sammich, they have a decent selection of chips (not that crap you find at Port of Subs), and other munchies... try the chili nachos!  Plus you can wash it all down with an ice cold beer... great selection of micro beers. 

They have a nice size covered patio if you chose to eat outside, which isn't really common here in Vegas, but if you prefer to sit inside the booths are comfy, and there's even a comfy couch, so you can feel like you're having a sammich at home!

I didn't mind, i wanted a bigger sandwich anyways...but the way they treated that poor girl melted my heart.

The girls shorts were so short they might as well just been in there underwear. As well as the shoes they were wearing, flip flops, boots, etc. I don't think cooperate is aware of how unprofessional this place is but they NEED TO MAKE CHANGES. I overheard employees discussing drug use, (marijuana and pills) and was floored. I then did research on this company and I  finally realized why its so unprofessional because they only have one location in Vegas which they obviously have forgotten about.

992662,2013-07-22,1,q4v-I9j1v7WqtxR12uEMxQ,"Deli Sandwiches and great beer. I should love this place, but I struck out. Again and again, first it closes way too early. So, it took a few attempts to try them when open. Then, finally, the stars aligned. The number of sandwich choices is a bit overwhelming. Most reviews raved over the cream cheese on the sandwiches since I don't dig cream cheese I was left uncertain on what to order. 

We asked for recommendations and settled on the turkey, avocado, bacon and provolone ($7.50 sm) and the pulled pork splashed with Tabasco BBQ sauce, cheddar and pineapple ($10.50). They have Kona on tap which is a huge win! We ordered two beers ($7.90 each). Rather than the cashier informing us it was happy hour, I happened to catch the sign in just the nick of time. He corrected the order, and we got 2-for-1 beers. Yeah! 

While we waited for our sandwich we admired the atmosphere and enjoyed our beers. We love the laid back beach atmosphere. Our sandwiches were brought over on Frisbees - love it. We dug into our sandwiches - didn't love it. 

The bread was thick, dense and while sturdy it wasn't too tasty. They lay it on thick so these are sandwiches for hearty appetites. However, the blend of fillings didn't thrill us. The turkey tasted purely like mustard, the avocado would shoot out the side every time I took a bite. It was difficult to eat about 1/2 way thru I gave up. The pork was ok, but it was ruined by the tabasco BBQ sauce. There was so much of it there was no way to escape it. It completely overpowered any taste of cheddar or pineapple. 

Perhaps we chose poorly, but these sandwiches came highly recommended. I'm not sure that I'd return to try others. It's a real shame because the beer options are fantastic. It'd be better if this was primarily a bar.

Though service is a bit slow for a sandwich shop, it is totally worth the wait. Their serving are massive, I ordered a medium sandwich and could only eat half ( and trust me, I can eat).
What set my sandwich apart, was the Italian dressing, it brought all the flavored together and made it a very tasty meal. Even a better one a couple hours later when I ate the other half at work. 

Natasha (wife), got a turkey sandwich, it had bacon and avocado in it, the bacon was too crispy, and the cream cheese was just chunked in there, maybe great for some people but she didn't care for both the bacon or cream cheese. Once she removed those ingredients, she enjoyed her meal.

As you walk in, there is a large menu posted on the left hand side of the room. Decide there and move to the register to order. I was dining with a group of low-carbers so each of them ordered their meals with no bread. Apparently at BHD that is code for ""make me a lettuce wrap"". 

My sandwich was LARGE. Check the photos from this place. They are not skimpy on the ingredients by any means. I had extra vegetables on my wheat sub and had to pull it apart to start to eat. There was nothing outstanding about the bread or the turkey. In fact, the bread fell apart quite a bit as I was eating. It made for a messy, but satisfying meal. I don't think I have had a sandwich with so much vegetable topping on it anywhere else. 

They did not season the sandwich (that I could tell) much and the side of Italian dressing was necessary for me to enjoy the meal. 

I think the best thing about BHD is how much care they put in their wraps. The low-carbers were VERY satisfied with their meals. One low-carber even had a hot dog wrapped in a bunch of veg and lettuce. I didn't have the heart to post that very odd looking photo. Sorry Mike T. Often when I order wraps the food is messily falling out of the wrap. No so at BHD; they know how to deal with the no-bread issue.

I've never been here so my husband and I thought we would check it out. This place lacks customer service to the fullest!! I want to rate it a negative Star. There are three customers in the entire place when I arrive, so when I walk in and see two employees I thought I would get a, ""Hello, hi."" Something shoot just some eye contact would be great. So I choose a seat while I'm waiting for my friends and husband.  There aren't any menus on the table and since the waitress does not care to greet me or ask if I would like something to drink, I stand up and ask the waitress if she has a menu. I ask two other times and she doesn't even look at me, finally a mail server walks up right next to her and notices me asking for a menu and he hands me one. I tell him there will be more people coming so I will need a couple menus. He walks away and never comes back. Meanwhile I sit down and start looking at the menu. I look around and see the NOT so friendly waitress go outside and start straightening chairs. At this point I am ready to leave, however I had to wait for the rest of my party to arrive so that we can decide on where to go. I would think taking care of customers is more important than pretending to straighten the patio. The place was practically empty (I doubt there was much to clean). If the owner of this place is having a problem with retaining or gaining new customers you might want to send in Restaurant Rescue to watch your servers. They are not doing a good job. I'm disappointed to see the bar for customer service is set so low. I didn't even get a chance to taste anything from the menu so unfortunately I cannot give a rating for the food at Beach Hut.

The Surfin Cow on Sourdough was stacked high with roast beef and they absolutely don't skimp on the cream cheese. 

Marley Nachos were my favorite. I loved the melted cheese with added bonus of gobs of cream cheese. I'm a tomato fan and these were fresh and tasty.

Hobie- was so good with the dressing. And again they were so nice to put the dressing on the side so the sandwich wasn't soggy. We had plenty of left overs to make multiple meals out of one order.

I tried the High Tide sandwich once and it was incredible! (Chopped pastrami, ham, crumbled bacon, cheddar and pepper jack, on sliced, toasted, garlic cheese bread, with fresh-made thousand island dressing) I stick with the salad though because I try not to eat bread that often.

Cream cheese sounded odd to me but biting into the sandwich was amazing! Creaminess of both the avocado and cream cheese complimented the savory turkey and bacon!

I ordered the Beach Bikini Sandwich and my husband ordered the Buffalo Grilled chicken Salad.  He had to ask 3 times or the salad dressing before any was brought to the table.  Half way through eating he pulled up a piece of grilled chicken that was still attached to the chicken on the plate.  It was attached by a very long hair. Immediately we all lost our appetites.  

We didn't tell the employees before throwing our items away and leaving.  I didn't want anything back or our order remade.  It was just a queasy feeling afterward.

The pig kahuna that my husband ordered had bbq pork that was sweetened and topped with chunks of juicy pineapple. My ""small"" sized sandwich, if you want to call it that had pastrami, bacon and cream cheese which was stacked pretty high. All the sandwich combos sounded great and tasted really good. There is no table service. You order and pay at the counter and your food is brought out to you.
   
The staff was friendly and helpful, met and chatted with the owner who was really enthusiastic and come to find out he also grew up in the Bay Area.  But subsequent visits here were a tad disappointing.  I met up with a friend of mine for lunch few days later.  I ordered a different sandwich, Haole Pizza and my friend had the Santa Cruz.  I don't know mine tasted too salty, maybe it was because it was the meats weren't the best quality. But even the presentation was a bit sloppy, like it was just thrown together and same went for my friends sandwich, it was just thrown together, unlike how mine looked originally.  It also took awhile for the sandwiches to be done because there were 3 orders ahead of us first and only 2 ladies working the counter. Maybe because it was different staff??  So this visit wasn't quite as impressive as the first. And I was disappointed because I dragged my friend here, when we would've gone somewhere else that day.

I came back couple weeks later again for lunch and ordered one of the  sandwiches we had in the first place, the Pig Kahuna and this time around I had the Surfin Cow.  Now that was pretty good, the lean roast beef stacked high, but Mr. B's sandwich, the  Pig Kahuna wasn't as impressive this time around.  It was drowned more in sauce and just had a few pineapple chunks that dotted his sandwich. It tasted just way too salty as well because of all the sauce. He was fine with it, but I just have a thing for when there is  lack of consistency when your food is prepared.  So I havent been really motivated to come back as of late.

The Drakester is a hot turkey sandwich with melted pepper jack cheese, creem cheese and a couple of green chilis all on toasted sour dough bread. By far the best sandwich I have ever had. Oh and the plates that the meal comes on is a frisbee, kids 8 and under get to keep em!!",4lZSIjLR8iYmtFUO4EiHzA,0,0,5,-CyjAE4EaWPLEqMO5zOiQA

If you don't like cream cheese - you probably won't like this too much. I mean, yes they have sandwiches  that don't have cream cheese - but a majority do. And yes, you can ask for them without the cream cheese - but why mess with their signature creations? 

Portion sizes are pretty good. I get pretty full after eating one sandwich. I will admit though, I had one fatty day at that place. My friend and I couldn't decide - so we both ordered one sandwich and another one to share, plus the Marley Nachos to start with. Damn, i was full. I'm not a big fan of taking leftovers - nor do I like throwing away food, so I forced myself to eat everything. It was one of the best worst decisions I've made. 

The Marley nachos (onions, peppers, avocado, cream cheese, bacon and a few other items) sounded delicious. Kind of disappointed. It wasn't as good as it sounded or as I was hoping. I probably wouldn't get them again, but they weren't disgusting. Just wasn't my style - but my friend loved it. I'll leave it to you to decide. 

The Santa Cruz (pastrami, avocado, bacon, and cream cheese) is definitely one of my favorites. How can you go wrong with any of those items? 

In a strip mall, that's filled with at least 6 other places to eat - beach hut is definitely a stand out. Do yourself a favor and try it out.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,4,2,4,PKXMQfLkz_uw38OGkM9rVA

We shared the Surfin' Bird 12"" sub sandwich - can we say Yum?! It was $13 for it, but the quality was well worth it.

When they guy, i think the owner, says it was pretty big to feed the 2 of us...he wasn't kidding. Granted my husband can eat a whole foot long subway sandwich himself, he ate half of this bird along with 1/4 of my half... and he was full. The sub alone is packed with enough turkey, bacon, avocado, cream cheese, and lettuce to feed almost 2 1/2 peeps. Not only is the bread super soft and fresh, but the bacon...oh the bacon - it was soo crispy, just how i like it. 

The only thing it lacked was not enough peppercinni's (which i love the kick in my subs), and the service can use help as we waited longer (for just sandwiches) than we anticipated. Can't imagine how long the wait would be if there were more than 6 customers in this place.

We hope they don't change the portion of their food down later on, as they are still new.  Can't wait to try the other subs and pizza's! I would recommend adding some desserts or other alcoholic drinks in that place cause it's soo big.",PcmsD3rA01ZW2I2B3KUn1Q,1,1,4,zWX6K-p_a5gcQFFV4aWsQA

2318863,2013-02-05,1,q4v-I9j1v7WqtxR12uEMxQ,"I wasn't as impressed with Beach Hut as many of my fellow yelpers are. 

I walked in at about 12:30 p.m. and grabbed a menu and sat down, browsing yelp suggestions and hungrily mulling over the menu. I finally decided on the ""Surfin' Bird"" sandwich (turkey, avocado, bacon and cream cheese). The menu says alfalfa sprouts are available on request. I requested them and was informed that they were out. Before I ordered, the lady in front of me was informed that they were out of chicken and roast beef. How can a deli run out of these things? I'm not sure. 

About 20 minutes later (seriously, 20 minutes to make a COLD sandwich that has 4 main ingredients?), my sandwich was ready. I grabbed it and left because I was slightly annoyed with the general attitude of employees. There were three employees and maybe four customers, including myself, waiting for sandwiches. The employees looked like they were just hanging out at work, not being very friendly or helpful and didn't seem to be putting too much effort into making my sandwich in less than 20 minutes. 

When I finally bit into the sandwich, I was very unimpressed with the quality of turkey. It tasted like watered down, pre-sliced, prepackaged turkey from a family pack of processed meat from Walmart. Seriously. THE MEAT makes the sandwich -  not the cream cheese (which I didn't really enjoy too much either) or the various lettuce/tomato/onion toppings. I don't like slimy deli meat. If you do, this is your place?

I wanted to love this sandwich, particularly since everyone raves about it and loves the unique cream cheese addition. But, I didn't love it.  I actually didn't like it very much either. 

I probably won't be back. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe they had an off day, maybe it doesn't usually take 20 minutes to make a sandwich when there are three employees and literally four people in the restaurant, and maybe $10 is a fair price to pay for a small sub (NOT!!!).

2422416,2013-06-17,0,q4v-I9j1v7WqtxR12uEMxQ,"In a desperate search for a weekend lunch change of pace, we remembered Beach Hut and moseyed over. The restaurant itself is much more substantial than I expected. When I think 
""sandwich place"", the setup of Subway and Quizno's comes to mind. Beach Hut is an entirely different ballgame. It's big, with tons of seating, both indoor and out. It reminds me a lot of Rubio's in feel. 

The menu is enormous, so I definitely suggest giving it a quick once-over before you go. At first blush, the sandwiches seem a bit pricey (the low end is $7.50 for a small), but, in this glorious case, you totally get what you pay for! They are totally up for customizing your sandwich, which is awesome. You order at the counter, then your food is brought to you at your table. They do have a bar as well. 

The sandwiches were seriously delicious. I had a North Shore and Boyfriend had a Surfin Bird, minus the cheese and bacon. We got them to go and seriously contemplated weighing the to-go bag once we got home. We completely forgot, but I swear, those two sandwiches must have weighed like 3 pounds. So, so worth it. 

The only negative here is the service. They just don't seem to have everything 100% together. From where we were sitting, I could see the sandwich assembly and watched them put ingredients on our sandwiches that we didn't want, then take them off. The sandwiches were then brought to us on trays, even though we had asked for them to-go. They repackaged them in a bag for us, with a bit of an attitude. However, this is one of those rare occasions where the food is good enough to overshadow some sub-par service.",__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ,1,3,4,p4tXNPjBrFM_AWsHVF5TLQ

Better believe that.

5 stars, maybe closer to 6. It was that good. Every part of my experience at Beach Hut Deli was a positive one. From the recommendation the owner gave to the quality of the food, all spot on. It was 7:30pm, about 30 minutes before the Deli was supposed to close and I was treated no differently than as if I was the first customer of the day. The owner recommended  the Surfin Bird for me (Turkey, Avocado, Bacon, Cream Cheese*, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo). Why the asterisk? Let me tell you why. Because cream cheese on a sammich is one of the greatest things I have ever tasted in the history of my tasting. It was that good. Maybe others already knew this secret, but I didn't. My wife isn't much of a turkeyer, so she took the owners recommendation as he said, and I quote, ""the whole reason I opened this place is because of the Surfin' Cow."" Cowabunga. Same ingredients as the Surfin Bird, just minus the bird and exchange it for Roast Beef. Served hot or cold, she chose cold. Outstanding! 

The thing I appreciated most was that we were there until a few minutes after 8. Instead of feeling like I needed to rush out (which I probably would have done had I worked there) the owner came up to us and asked how everything was as. He wanted to know how we heard about Beach Hut Deli and  what we thought of the food. He could have easily ignored us and I would have still given this place a 5 star accolades. I appreciated the extra attention and him going out of the way to make us feel warm and welcome.

I wanted to try something new but I just kept thinking about the pastrami melt with avocado. It's on garlic bread and the bread actually has real chunks of roasted garlic. Delish!  They are super super generous with their avocado portions, which I love. I had my 22 month old daughter with me, so I took half the avocado off for her snack and it as still enough. 

Hubby got the pig (?) not sure on name. He said it was so yummy. I would've tried it but I'm a weirdo that always goes no mayo, no mustard, no sour cream, no white creamy sauce etc. I wanted to try it though but he loves mayo. 

Funny story, my previous review was very good (4 stars) but I did mention they forgot to put chips in the to go bag.

From the reviews I've read and the posted photos of this place my hopes were high. But after biting into ""Drakester"" and half of it spitting out the back of it, I knew this would be a tough sell. 

I walked in and was greeted immediately, with smiles and info. I had arrived during happy hour which means $2 beers after you roll some dice, the number rolled corresponds to what type of beer you get. If you get a beer you don't like, you can pay an extra dollar and get the beer you want, $3 total. Not a bad deal and pretty fun. Happy Hour is only during the week from 3pm -6pm. 

I ordered the ""Drakester"" sandwich, which is a hot turkey sandwich with melted pepper jack, cream cheese, roasted chili peppers, lite mayo, on toasted garlic sourdough cheese bread. I ordered this with no mayo, but it was still disappointing. The ingredients were fresh and there were plenty of them, but the whole thing fell apart after the first bite. There was way too much cream cheese on this sandwich and I couldn't really taste any garlic on the bread. This was more of a stoner creation a than restaurant quality sandwich. Pretty disappointing 

My foodie partner in crime ordered the, ""Shark Bite"". this sandwich was very good, compared to the Drakester. It came with canadian ham, swiss cheese, cream cheese, tabasco, BBQ sauce, onions, bacon, lettuce and mayo garlic cheese sourdough bread. After having a bite of this I started to have buyers remorse with my sandwich and convinced my foodie friend to trade halfs. Sucker!

The one thing this place does deliver on is beer. They have a great selection of brews from Stone, Lost Coast, and most recently Rogue Hazelnut Brown - pure goodness. 

Beyond the sudsy love, my experience at Beach Hut was pretty lackluster, but the ""Shark Bite"" boosted my faith in this deli and I will be back for another and hopefully to update my review for the positive.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,7,4,3,bLePJ2b4pmfI8tKxWrfFVA

In Depth Review: Live right down the road from this gourmet sandwich shop and deli and never even noticed it. Was going to eat at another location in this strip mall and decided to try this location instead. Walked in at about 2pm on a Thursday and nobody was inside eating or in line ordering food. Was this a sign? Girl at the counter seemed a little unenthusiastic and didn't exactly greet us properly or make any suggestions as we stood there lost and starring at the massive menu on the wall. 

The decor is pretty cool and it looks straight out of a So Cal beach town like Hermosa Beach or Pacific Beach. Really liked the decor and the laid back chill music & beach vibe. Place is much larger than it looks outside and has a great outside patio area that would be ideal if it was not so hot. 

I ordered a hot (melted) sandwich called the ""Drakester"" and the lady ordered a cold  sandwich called the ""Beach Bikini."" We also ordered a side of potato salad and shared a coke. The food comes out in a Frisbee (love it). The sandwiches cost anywhere between $7 - $12 each. They are not massive sandwiches in size and are a bit high on the price spectrum for this neighborhood IMO. The Drakester was interesting. It consisted of hot turkey, melted pepper jack cheese, a giant slab of cream cheese, mayo and roasted chili peppers on sourdough bread. Didn't look enticing at first. Was messy, required two hands to eat as it wanted to slide in two different directions. But this sandwich tasted pretty damn good! It was a pleasant surprise. Not the healthiest choice, but a delicious choice. The lady enjoyed her sandwich but thought it was just OK at best.  The homemade potato salad was served German style and tasted good to me. The lady thought it had too much mayo. Oh well, cannot please everyone. I approve of it and liked it. 

In Summery: The Beach Hut Deli has potential and I think I will give them an honest second look. As a marketing guy I would advise the owners and management to step up their promotions and advertising. Especially in the near-by neighborhoods. Was there 45+ minutes and only saw one other guy walk in to get a sandwich. Pretty sure he worked at a business in the strip mall. This is a neat spot and would like to see it stick around for a while. Or long enough for that second visit.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,1,1,3,Zmk5pSyTlJdavjPKkDDj9w

By far out of every sandwich place I have been to this place knocks the rest out of the water.

If they are charging 10 bucks for a sandwich it better have fresh carved meat not something I can buy in a pre-wrapped package at the supermarket.

I'll give you a little background on me: I love Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. In fact, I order them just about everywhere I go, and have even eaten them in Philadelphia. I walked into Beach Hut Deli at the recommendation of my little brother, and didn't know what to expect. I immediately was drawn to the cheesesteak sandwich. So I went on ahead and ordered the medium variant of it. After ordering a medium fountain drink, something caught my eye. It was a Sierra Nevada beer tap!!! The gentleman making the food (who I later found out was the manager/owner) asked if I wanted a tall, to which I stated ""definitely"". He gave me a huge pint of Sierra Nevada Ale for no additional charge than that of the soda. What a cool guy. Minuets later a monster sandwich was presented to me. It was probably 8"" long and was over-flowing with tender/juicy steak, cheese, and surprisingly; cream cheese (which was awesome!). I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese at all, but this just WORKED. What a pleasant experience, though I'd share. I live in the area, and this place is my new favorite sandwich shop. I still enjoy firehouse, San Francisco sourdough eatery, and jimmy johns.

If you like BIG sandwiches, you should definitely go here. Your sandwich comes on top of a monster sub bun with a pile of meat and any toppings that go with your sandwich. I got the Santa Cruz because it had pastrami, the most sensual of all the salted cured meats, and that was a damn good sandwich. It's topped with avocados and a bunch of other toppings, so if you are more of just a meat and cheese type person, you could just go for their plain pastrami sandwich, which I imagine is also just a mound of delicious pastrami.

The thing you need to know before ordering here is the sizes of the sandwiches. They have small, medium, and large sizes, but their ""smalls"" are actually normal sized sandwiches, the mediums are large, and a ""large"" is probably a sandwich that could feed the team of monstars. I got the medium, and finished it, though I would have been plenty satisfied with only eating half of the medium sandwich.

If you aren't eating, there is plenty else to do. They have a Wii on one of their TVs to pass the time, some beer pong tables, and a bags setup, making it look like a really fun place to hang out.",icDPVdDIBLWSX_8hClrM9Q,0,1,5,V81JKqh3NRsQDOhjCNsBmA

The cream cheese that came in the sandwich was hard and clumpy, not spread like it should have been. I'm sure the sandwich would have tasted better had it not been for the burnt bacon and the frozen cream cheese.

I had high hopes for this place prior to ever arriving based on the previous YELP reviews that I had read and the pictures that were posted. When I entered the door I knew that YELP had set me up for success yet again. This place smells like the inside of a jar of molasses. The setup is really unique and welcoming. They have covered outdoor sitting (covered being the key word), and lots of space on the inside to dine. 

Heres how my encounter went at the Beach Hut. I entered and showed the nice gentleman at the register a yelp photo and said what is this... AHHH the Big Kahuna he explained. Our pulled pork sandwich with chopped pineapples,BBQ sauce, and just enough spice. 

Solid ill take it... oh yeah and add some of those nachos in the picture. (Caution yelpers don't make the same rookie mistake I made and allow your eyes to order a meal that your belly can't sustain)

First came ""The Big Kahuna"" which ...dare I say it, is the best sandwhich I have ever eaten. It has just enough spice to compliment the pineapple and sweet barbecue sauce. The bread was soft and fluffy like eating a cloud of perfectly melted flavors. Next, out came the Marley Nachos. The combination of the bacon, feahly melted cheese and avocado puts the Marley nachos into a league of their own. These things are better then good, great is an understatement, I would classify this plate of chips and cheese as a brilliantly crafted, eclectic, pieces of edible art. I ate the entire sandwich and most of the nachos and yes I feel disgustingly full, but man was it worth it. The young lady in the hut said that was the first time she had witnessed anyone order both(allllrightttt). Let this be a lesson to you all when other yelpers warn that the portion sizes are huge, they mean it. 

I don't mean to sound all dramatic and stuff but this is the best new spot in town. Thank goodness its on eastern and not the strip.

P.S. they serve all of their dishes on frisbees, if you bring your little ones in they let them keep the frisbee.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,2,1,5,HLK6APRoDRmtplZguiqzxw

It sure was a Kahuna because for a small portion it was huge! Mmmmhmmm....I love me some pulled pork. The sandwich was just FULL of flavor and the pinapple toppings went well with the sandwich. There was so much juice and fillings on the sandwich that I even ate it with a fork. So, if you're down to get al ittle messy. Eat it by hand. If not, I'd reccommend using a fork to defeat the Kahuna.

We also ordered the Surfin' Cow. This was also a great choice. Cream cheese? What a twist to a sandwich. They also added what seemed like a full avocado on there. Who doesn't love avocado. This was also full of flavor and the roast beef was nice and tender.

The service was a-ok. The girls were still getting the jist of everything so the service just needs a little work. The only thing I didn't appreciate was the cashier saying, ""Now what?"" I don't know about you, but never have I ever gone to an establishment where a server or cashier spoke to me that way, nor do I ever go to a place expecting someone to speak to me that way. Our order took a little longer than normal to come, but the gentleman who worked there was nice enough to offer us complementary drinks and chips for the wait. So I thought it was nice of him to reach out.

Theo ther cool thing is is they also have a bar with a wonderful selection of beer I think there was IPA, Shock Top, and some more I couldn't remember.

The vibe is laid back & chill, the staff have always been friendly; and the food fresh and satisfying.  You're greeted with reggae or island tunes, which always puts me in a better mood.  Inside, there are numerous TV's, seating at booths with surf board shaped tables, a large sofa, a small bar area, and there are more tables on the patio.

On this trip we shared the 6"" Surfin' Cow sandwich (roast beef, really crispy bacon, cream cheese, mayo, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, sprouts, lettuce, peppers) and the 1/2 size of the Chef Salad (Chopped ham, turkey, salami, cheddar, jack cheese, tomatoes, more yummy bacon, peppers, and sliced avocado).  

I never thought I would like cream cheese on a sandwich, but it adds a creamy texture and a great flavor profile to their sandwiches.  The small 6"" size may seem inadequate to fill some people up, but trust me, their sandwiches are packed.  They don't skimp here.

The salad was also very good and on the 1/2 size the amount of toppings actually eclipses the amount of lettuce.  If you like a chef salad, you'll enjoy this one.

4055012,2012-09-14,0,q4v-I9j1v7WqtxR12uEMxQ,"Deli with a burger atmosphere, if that makes any sense.  Located in the heart of what I call ""Restaurant Row"" on Eastern Ave.  This places doesn't disappoint.  I was very satisfied to say the least. Originally was going to get some grub at BJ's, which is located in the same parking lot.  But a co-worker suggested this place and swears by it. 

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the decor. Kind of cheesy with the ""try hard"" beach theme.  Almost reminded me of someone having a beach theme house party. The second thing I noticed was the huge menu on the wall and multiple flat panel TV's. 

Staff was great and if you don't know what to get, they'll suggest something for you. Just let them know it's your first time. 

I got the Drakster, which is basically a Turkey Melt.  But there was nothing basic about this sandwich. About 10 oz of sliced turkey and melted cheese all in a grilled piece of bread.  Sandwich was huge and worth the $10.  I'm a dipper and had to cut the sandwich in a couple of pieces just so I can dip it.  Your sandwich is also brought to your table in a frisbee used as a plate.  I actually thought the frisbee was a giveaway just like those old school happy meals.  You know, the meals that came inside those plastic boats.  Who doesn't remember that.  Back to the sandwich, the best. 

My only issue is that the booths are a bit tight.  Your table is a surf board, which is small for a table top.  You'll find yourself bumping knees with whoever you're eating with.  Might be a good thing depending who your company is. 

TIP 1:  It's probably a crime to add any condiments since the sandwiches are good as is.  But if you need any, ask them in advance.  That goes for any silverware too.  This place doesn't have a separate place for this. 

TIP 2:  Portions are big.  Yes, this place doesn't skimp.  Order a regular if you're use to a foot long Subway Sandwhich.  If you're a hungry man like me, order their large.

TIP 3:  Open mic on the weekends??  Friend suggested I come back on the weekends to do my best American Idol impression.  Yeah right, but will come back to enjoy.

Today I went back for lunch since I am lazy and it was a short walk from my office. I decided on the skinny dipper. It is pretty tasty and no heartburn this time!

My only bad experience was when they accidentally left the bacon out of my sandwhich.

The price is a little on the steep side when you're considering you're paying for just a sandwich, but this is about as gourmet of a sandwich as you can get without it really being a gourmet sandwich. These guys make big, tasty, attractive sandwiches. Try it, I doubt you'll be disappointed.

During my visit to the deli we were greeted by the friendly employees as soon as we walked in. When they brought our orders to the table they waited a minute to make sure we had everything we needed. At the end of our meal someone came out to make sure we enjoyed everything. Great service!

My second Beach Hut Deli experience was a take-out order at work. Ordering for an office was also easy. The menu was easy to find on their website. I called in the six orders and the woman that took my order repeated everything back at the end for accuracy. All of the orders were correct when we picked them up. We were quoted 15-20 minutes to prepare our order and it was indeed ready when we arrived in that amount of time.

The menu is very unique with sandwich and sub options that you won't find at other delis. Regular size subs are 6"" and Large size subs are 9"". I was happy to see that they have a Dude/Duddette option which is 3"" for subs and half a sandwich for the gourmet sandwiches. The subs are all loaded with meat and toppings so for me a 3"" sub is plenty with a side. 

The Hobie is their version of an Italian with salami, pastrami, provolone, and Italian dressing. It's loaded with meat and toppings for a delicious and filling sub. The Mahalo Taco (special) was one of the best subs I've ever tasted. It included taco seasoned roast beef and chips. Trying to describe the amazing flavor of this sub is impossible. The flavors all worked so well together. This sub was also packed with meat and toppings. The High Tide has pastrami, ham, bacon, pepper jack cheese, and thousand island dressing on cheese bread. It was very tasty, but I think the sub bread is better than the sandwich bread. The Potato Salad and Pasta Salad are both obviously made in house and are delicious. The Potato Salad has large pieces of potato with skin on and a delicious dressing. The Pasta Salad has orzo pasta, cheese, sundried tomatoes, and artichokes.

I used to visit BHD in Reno when I was in college. I remember the shop opening up and daaaaaaaaayum the sandwiches were good. They're still good today. I was so happy to hear there was a location that opened up here.

I came in during Noon-time and it actually wasn't even that busy which was surprising, but they must get some good crowds for their happy hour. YES. This sandwich shop has a happy hour.

I had the flying pig, which has pretty much everything I love in a sandwich. Tasty ham, bacon, avocado, cream cheese, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and thin cut red onions. GAH. I am salivating right now. Order it hot. Or not. Both ways are good.

My only issue is this... since there are so very many sandwich places in this particular area it's kind of hard to choose the best. But even though I love BHD, I think Firehouse Subs is better, but that's just my particular taste. Mainly I pick Firehouse over BHD because of the perfect sizing of their sandwiches.

I've never been there during an event, although I'm pretty sure they have musical guests every now and then. For that reason this review will be based mostly on food. I was there during happy hour though, and you get to roll dice for drink specials, so that was kind of fun.
   On to the food. I've had ""The Woody ""a couple times and Cali Cheese Steaks on a few occasions. ""The Woody"" , which is a hot roast beef sammich, with tobasco,bullseye, bacon, cheddar, cream cheese,mayo, onions, and lettuce. It's a bit pricey for a Sammich at aroun $12, but it's huge. For the typical person, they'd probably have to take half home. The cream cheese is genius, and tobasco is not hot. If your not into beef or BBQ, this is not for you. I highly recommend it. Like I said, this is too big for a single serving, but I found myself stuffing my stomach to the rafters! Typically this would be a high end roast beef sub, but the addition of bacon, 2 sauces, and cream cheese, AND then cooked?! Well that just takes it to a different level. As for this sandwich alone, 4 out of 5. Brisket would get em 5.
  About that Cheese Steak doe...Very good. The way they make it is with Monterey jack and cream cheese. So they call it like a California Cheese Steak. It very good. They grill all the ingredients together. This makes a beautiful mixture of peppers, cheese, and beef, just playing off of each other. Now you can customize this and get cheddar and what not, what ever veggies you want, but what I will say is that there no cheese wiz. So if you're trying to get an authentic Philly, this is not the place. That's why they call it a cali cheese steak. I'd still give this a 4 out of 5.                  
   Onward to the Beach Comber. Now this is what another person in my party got. ""It's a lot of food, and very fresh. It's like you really got it from a deli.it is a customizable sandwich, so you can get exactly what you want.""
   When it comes to mid priced, and fast served sandwiches this is a TOP SPOT. I've never had bad service. I've always left satisfied, they have a great beer selection, and the food is plentiful and great. I highly recommend this place!",lIlJl3f2FR-YzVUwkgDgEw,0,0,4,aqUUZw55apw8qk5k6zz6kg

Vegas is definitely devoid of top-knotch sandwich shops.  Even the best ones have this sort of mass-produced quality.  Being used to ""mom and pop"" sandwich shops where everything is made on premises I'm pretty picky.  I do have to say that this place is pretty darn good.  It reminds me a little of Johnny McGuires at Town Square. 

The bread, meats and toppings are all good quality with very original sandwich concoctions.  While it still has that mass-produced feel, relatively speaking it's definitely one of the standouts in Las Vegas/Henderson.  They don't shy away from the amount of meat and try to just drown out the sandwich in toppings like a lot of sub shops do.  You definitely get your money's worth and I'll definitely return.

I quit after my third day working cause I was not going to take abuse from a work place. This place is full of unprofessional people that want to party before working and giving customer service.

We waited about 15 minutes for all our sandwiches to come out.  The good news, if you go at the right time, try one of their beers that they have.  Great flavors.

The Sandwiches - Wow.  The taste is wonderful. I won't go into describing all the different types, but you can look them up yourself.  All I can say, is that you are getting great quality ingredients, fresh, a ton of them and the sandwiches are created with a lot of ""otherness"" to them that makes them taste great.

The Salads - Had mine as a salad as I did not want bread.  Next time, I am going to try it with the lettuce wrap.

Their sandwiches are nothing short of epic. If you have a small appetite best plan on sharing because Beach Hut's sandwiches are HUGE! Their menu has so many choices which makes it hard to pick. Not only do they have sandwiches they have hot dogs and even homemade soups. Some sandwiches we have ordered were the Skinny Dipper, which had roast beef and melted cheddar cheese. Plus, it came with a side of au jus. The Woody is my favorite so far. It oozes with roast beef, cheddar cheese, red onion and cream cheese. That's right huge globs of cream cheese. Mmmmm all those flavors just melt together between the soft rolls. I also have tried the Clam Chowder and the pasta salad. I know they specialize in sandwiches, (which are amazing), but the soup was luke warm and lacked seasoning. The pasta salad had a sweet note that I did not enjoy. 

I love the seating on the inside of Beach Hut. They have a huge couch as well as regular chairs and tables. The outside patio is a nice change, but be careful some of those chairs hurt your bum! Sitting outside when the weather is nice is definitely part of the charm of Beach Hut. I do really like the staff here too. They are always so friendly and look genuinely happy to be there.

This time, smartly I might add, I brought my wife so we could get two sammies and split.  We went with the Spicolli (delish turkey breast, bacon, ranch, lettuce, french roll) and the Skinny Dipper (roast beef, melted cheddar, onions, mayo and au jus).  I'd be hard pressed to tell you which one I liked better.  Traditional french dips I come across seem to be lazy and played out.  The beef isn't what it should be and it's just another sandwich.  Here the beef and cheese are in perfect harmony - and there isn't so much mayo that it's over-bearing and oozing out.  The only bummer is that I liked each sandwich so much I'd be afraid to try a different one.

Other pluses - they serve beer and have several HD TVs (with sports on).  I also believe they have free wifi because the first time I went there was a big group of guys doing a fantasy football draft.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,0,0,4,VZtJchdyBYtueOIYKVXkTw

5218613,2013-07-27,1,q4v-I9j1v7WqtxR12uEMxQ,"I really wanted to like this location.  I mean I REALLLLYYYY wanted to like this spot.  I grew up near Beach Hut in northern Cali and it quickly was one of my favorite lunch spots of all time.   I was stoked when I moved to NV and saw that they had a Beach Hut, it was one of the first places I had to go eat.  Upon arriving, I gave my order to a worker that I'm not sure knew where he was.  There are certain things I like on a sandwich and certain things I don't, usually it's not complicated and this was no exception.  Somehow just ordering turned into an approx 10 min ordeal.  I wish I could explain how it took so long to just go through what I wanted and what I didn't, but unfortunately I went through the process of repeating it twice (very slowly) and he still seemed confused.  The sandwich came out after another 10 min wait and was awesome, the food here I truly can't knock, it really is good.

The next time going here was fairly uneventful luckily (which truly should be expected at anywhere I go).  There was a longer than normal wait considering my order was the only one they were making, but the food made up for it.

My next trip here really bothered me to the point that I don't wish to go back.  I want to say, I DON'T mind waiting if the food is worth it, I may get a little annoyed considering there's typically no cooking for a sandwich, but I'll deal with it and be happy.  So upon walking in, I head right to the counter and give my order for a To-Go order.  Based on my previous experiences with Beach Hut in general, I know it'll take 5-10 minutes at least.  After being outside for maybe a minute or two tops, a young girl calls my name and tells me that my order is ready, which I found out.  I asked if she was sure it was mine which she tells me ""yes"", I repeat back what I ordered just to make sure because this seemed unusually quick.  She again tells me that it's mine while looking slightly annoyed.  Unfortunately I feel like somehow it's my fault for not trusting my gut instinct and actually opening up the sandwich and checking to make sure it was right.   So fast forward to 15-20 drive home and opening up ""my"" sandwich... well... i think you can guess that it wasn't mine.  If it was just a minor screw up like the same # but with/without onions I would be ok with it, but unfortunately this was just completely a different sandwich.  I don't prefer to have mustard and this thing was loaded up.  

Normally I'd chalk it up to just a normal error like when Fast Food happens to toss the wrong item on your burger, but this just doesn't have the same feel to it.  If there was more people inside ordering at the time I could understand just tossing the wrong sandwich in the wrong bag, unfortunately there was only 1 other person ordering and that was after me.  Best guess is they screwed up someone's sandwich and found a quick way to get rid of it.  

I'm sure in the future I'll break down and give this place another shot based on my love affairs with the ones from my home town, but I just don't see it happening anytime soon.  It's been 3 months since my last time here and I don't know when I'll try it again.

The food really is great and based on that alone I want to rate this 5 stars, just the employees/service bring this one down so badly to the point I feel 1.5/2 stars is appropriate.",6sjBweiKEIyBB2vXC3V1lw,4,1,2,QTnOrJaf6Mhij3s1EQ8Zpg

Went online, read the menu and saw that a lot of their sandwiches had cream cheese in them and one of my favorite delis of all time had cream cheese on it so I thought, why not...let's give this place a shot! When we pulled up, a typical strip mall location. The sign was a little hard to see...but when we walked in it was decorated with a great beach theme. Walked over to the counter grabbed a menu and decided what to have. The cashier was very friendly ...asked if we had any questions...welcomed us ...we ordered 2 sandwiches, my man had the Hobie a  pastrami and salami with provolone and Italian dressing medium in size, he brought half home because it was so big and packed full of meat, and I had the beach bikini, turkey with sprouts, sunflower seeds, and cream cheese...on wheat bread. I took off the cranberry sauce. We sat down at our table which was a surf board. We liked the atmosphere, nice reggae music playing and for how busy they were it was pretty quiet. I looked outside to their patio and think when the weather is cooler, it would be really nice to sit outside, have a beer and play their corn hole games set up. When our food came out a very friendly staff member brought it to us, asking if we needed anything else. The sandwiches were served on a frisbee...great idea!!! Perfect for the theme! The meat was WONDERFUL, fresh ingredients. Really tasty pastrami! The only thing I would have added to mine was some purple onion and maybe a tomatoe...but it was wonderful regardless!!! ;) we will definitely be back...even though it was a drive for us...it was definitely worth it!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,0,0,5,PwpgQSbUbCF2YjgSm3gmQw

New to the Henderson area fresh from the Westside of the LV valley, I was craving a deli sandwich for lunch (I also want a beer with a meal 99/100 times)... So my boyfriend suggested this place and we scooted down to the Beach Hut Deli. LOVE! 

This fun little place is in the middle of a bustling shopping center filled with cool shops and other great eats, but once you spot the Hawaiian style dried grass canopy outside on the patio during the warm Las Vegas day you will want to enjoy a meal here on a reoccurring basis. There is a large seating area inside full of TVs, cozy booths, and a giant comfy couch. Every where you look you will find something fun to look at. There are gorgeous sunset murals and fun beachy signs. The patio is very large, well lit, and covered.

The menu is filled with a bunch of perfectly unique sandwiches that aren't too wildly out there. I had the Woody... hot roast beef, bbq sauce, crispy bacon and a slice of cream cheese among other things, your standard melted cheddar cheese, mayo, onions and finely shredded lettuce. My honeypie went with the Spicolli. hot turkey breast slices with melted cheddar cheese on a toasted roll with ranch dressing, lettuce and bacon. We both ordered a small size sandwich and traded a half with each other. (It's the funnest way to try things!) Both were absolutely delicious, but I was much more partial to my sandwich. I would have enjoyed the toasted roll of his though. Sadly, I didn't get my full Hawaiian fix because they were out of mac salad!!! They do have potato salad and an Italian style pasta salad too, but I really needed that mac!!! Large section of potato chips as well.

They have beer on tap!!!! I. LOVE. BEER. Let me warn you, the large beer is L.A.R.G.E. I'm talking huge. Too big for me, which is saying a lot. It might be... like.... a full six pack. Ok, not a full six pack... but by our estimation it was a solid 40oz of frosty cold brew.
 
Another HUGE bonus is Rogue Hazelnut Brown Ale ON TAP!!!! It's quite tasty and one of my favorite beers ever!!

It is a very laid back eatery, although a little too laid back in the safety/health department. Don't read me wrong, it's VERY clean. I am just slightly particular having worked in the food service industry before. The girls working the station were wearing sandals, which let's be honest- the second you drop a knife cutting my sandwich you are going to lose a toe. Also, I FIRMLY stand by the ponytail rule: if your hair is touching your shoulders, it should be pulled back into a neat ponytail. It's not a fashion show, it's my lunch.

Overall 4/5 stars. I will return for sure, but I hope to see some close toed shoes and properly managed hair. I also know to ask for a toasted bun on my hot sandwich and order the small beer.",UEeZ-eE63citRQIeqsQq1g,1,1,4,G2rWZnJTwJepomP2KC1esA

When I say huge I mean long lines crowed shop and sometimes up to an hour wait for a sandwich. But obviously if you have had there sandwiches it was so worth the wait. Now moving back to vegas I was sad that the only time I could get a bomb Santa Cruz when I visit my sister who is still in reno. Now finding out there is a beach hut deli here excited is a dull adjective to discrive my feelings. Now I live a good hour away but it is so worth the trip. Vegas people do not understand how amazing this place is. Walking into the shop I was amazed to see the lack of business!! This place is huge with games and so much sesting.

There is a really cool island vibe inside, surf boards on the walls and your sandwiches are served on Frisbees. I love the automatic doors and the giant menu on the wall so you can decide what you want without holding up the line. I have since been here about 3 times and look forward to coming back again really soon. 

On my first visit I went for the classic, surfin bird. When it arrived it was so large I wasn't sure how I was going to eat it. You definitely want to stick to the small! The sandwich had great flavor and everything really worked together perfectly. I was a little worried about the slices of cream cheese, but it added a nice creamy texture to the sandwich. On my next visit I split the Spicolli with a friend and we were a bit disappointed. The ticket machine stopped working so we waited a little longer than normal and then the sandwich didn't have much flavor. We could taste the turkey and bacon, but not the ranch which would have really tied the flavors together. I came again the next day for lunch with my husband and fell in love with the Hobie. This classic Italian sub really did it for me. I loved the Italian dressing and all of the flavors really worked perfectly together. I also really love the Dirty brand potato chips that they sell, they are super delicious and a perfect crunchy compliment to any sandwich.

This is easily one of the best sandwiches that you will find in Las Vegas. I love that their sandwiches all have a twist, rather than being the same old sandwiches you get anywhere.

So far I've tried the surfin bird and santa cruz. These are both cold sandwiches, and they're pretty much the same but one has turkey and the other pastrami. Along with the meat, they come with avocado, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, mustard, pickle, onion, lettuce, greek pepper and cheese. Like I said, the sandwich is packed full! The cream cheese is an interesting topping, which I like, but I personally think it's spread on a little thick. The sandwiches come in small, medium, large and I would definitely suggest splitting if you go for a medium or large, as they are quite filling. The hot sandwiches sound pretty interesting too, so I'll have to come back for one of those. 

Along with the food, they also offer beer which is pretty awesome. They usually even have happy hour specials for both the beer and food. 

For a chain deli, the atmosphere is really nice and you have an option of sitting inside or outside. And outside, you can sit in a covered or uncovered area.
