My favorite is the prime rib, which comes with bread, baked potato, salad. You can get a couple of bucks off if you show them your Binion's player card (so be sure to get one before you go in).  The other player's special is the BBQ chicken/ribs, which is a very good deal -- I couldn't finish it.

It's old style, it's kitsch, it's reasonably priced really good food.",XWhXY9Xk-4JQE0Z96EvGqQ,0,0,4,lztePrFXd3CfqdDIIirCsg

My favorite time visiting was when I had just gotten to Vegas and was starving. I got breakfast for $1.99 and they didn't care if I brought in the beer I had bought at the liquor store a few minutes earlier. The service was quick because it was late, and the food tasted just fine. 

The last time I went it was our last meal in Vegas and we wanted a sit-down dinner, but nothing too fancy. We ordered a round of drinks. The beer came with no glass, and the cap still on. My wine came in a single-serve bottle and the glass the waitress eventually brought me was wet. Surely it wasn't wet from being washed because when I wiped off the water with my napkin a bunch of brown stuff came off on it. Disgusting. We walked out. 

I won't go back unless there are no other options. On Freemont St., having no other options is really unlikely.",_Nw4usT8M3oJZgKaKAgKpg,2,1,2,1bMIzqx03j-Cr55fzpBzww

I had a twenty dollar comp that could only be used in the coffee shop, so it was French Toast, and Ceaser's Salad. Best Ceaser Salad I ever had in my life. So good it made me drop my silverware and knock over my drink.",1g_ajkmxzivqpY8E9s9sgQ,0,0,5,wsKqA6LFNUtsdn-3Rtau2g

Last time I was in Vegas, we we're staying downtown and of course at some hungry point of one night, Binion's came to mind. Now, everyone downtown lately seems to be remodeling, but this is bad. No longer hidden downstairs in the back corner, now smack dab in the casino, looking like a temporary pop-up restaurant (hopefully it is!) with walls that don't go all the way to the ceiling. Our server was AWFUL! He was an older gentleman who HATED his job and it showed.  We didn't even get everything we ordered, even though we reminded him to which he responded ""yeah, yeah, I'll get it"", he disappeared FOREVER, never refilled our drinks. Needless to say, we did not leave a tip.

Also, the menu seems different, smaller and a little pricier.

All I have to say is I will never come back here again. I'm just sad one of my downtown Vegas gems no longer exists...",LejJsu-oJ9wX6kGwcX6oxQ,1,0,1,Ed3w-a7GslM8Ylpa5hwUzg

And I aint' talkin bout no jank ass 6oz prime rib at some bourgie steakhouse for $40 - I'm talkin bout a big ol slab that takes two hands to handle the plate and takes a good empty stomach to take it all in :)

4974854,2008-10-21,3,hkbZCioL7TkHLZuTXf-5fQ,"When the folks are in town, I find myself in search of the best deal in town.  Prime rib was on the menu and Fremont Street was where we were at.

Binion's was offering a $7.95 prime rib when you sign up for their casino card, so of course that's what we did.

I must admit, for under eight bucks you get a pretty decent meal.  You get soup or salad to start, 10 oz. slice of prime rib, a baked potato, and string beans.  The prime rib was surprisingly tasty too, with a nice crust on the outside.
 
Service was okay, it's a coffee shop after all and they are busy at night.  Beers were lukewarm instead of ice cold, which isn't so nice when you've been on a bus all day long.

Overall, an eight dollar prime rib dinner can't be beat. You're not paying for gourmet here, just a chunky size piece of meat!  They also had a few other specials that had our heads turning - spaghetti and meatball special, etc.

Their daily Blue Plate Specials go for $7.99 from 11 am to 10 pm and ranges from a Turkey Dinner on Sundays to a Fried Seafood Platter on Fridays and Corned Beef and Cabbage on Saturdays.

Open 24 hours.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,5,3,JBqkU_WpD21K8s_8aRLa0w

I thought i was on an airplane for a minute!(crappy food and all plastic ware).  They are much better and cheaper places right by it.  I was also disappointed that the ""special Price"" that was listed on the sign was only if you had signed up for a club card for the casino.  I did not see that on the sign!",lW4-fwht1tzBJ1aDUr0o4Q,0,0,1,YSt3SgkJKCObYeQDaY3zZA
