The salad bar is fun and they have a pretty descent variety of offerings.
The soups are always great. The chili which was one of my favorites, the chicken pot pie, the beef stew,and the tortilla chicken. Jasons Deli always hits the spot when you are looking for a quick and healthy meal.

But wow has this place gone down hill.  The last few times we've been, there have hardly been any workers at all.  Last time, I had to stand at the cash register for about 5 minutes, waiting to pay, because they had to find an employee who could jump off the food line and come ring me up.  Huh?

The salad bar has also started to look kind of funky, and everything just looks kinda ""dirty.""  The floors need a good deep cleaning, as do the bathrooms.  And to top it off, the whole place has a very weird smell.  It kind of reminds me of an old elementary school cafeteria.  And not in a good way!

No exaggeration.

(?)   The timing of the food execution is horrible.!!! You can even see the staff standing in the back on top of each other waiting to take hot food out that is sitting on this massive counter without a heat lamp.   Hard to watch.  Hard to watch staff just stand around and talk when they best be grateful to be working in the first place....  THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE THING: there are set positions in the kitchen where there are many hands that look over the order before it goes out, a manager or 'expediter'.....???? What is with the expediter?  Looking all dapper and bringing a mediocre, EVERY TIME, tray.   This, seriously? is a CONSTANT at this particular establishment.  The staff ruins the food experience.

1118491,2013-06-04,0,PgQZfKQwW6Q9fIvViD7Xrg,"There were several issues with this place with our visit around 6pm tonight.  The first one was a clear lack of English speakers in places that were needed to communicate with customers.  This caused a multitude of problems.  First, it took about 10 minutes to get my order taken with two parties in front of me because the others took so many attempts to place their order and not get understood or questions answered clearly (while other employees stood around and did nothing).

Once placing our order of just two salad bars and soup, we then walked down to the end of the counter.  We are immediately told what I think was it would be brought to our table as the person pointed.  No problem, but after five minutes we went back to the counter while nobody was doing anything and told again that it would be brought to the table.  Seriously?  At least give us our salad bowls after 10 minutes.

After about five more minutes we give up and go back and our bowl of soup and two empty bowls are sitting on the counter with nobody around so I just pick it up.

This location need to have people that can communicate with the customers and does not need to take 15 minutes +/- to provide two bowls and a cup of soup, especially with how empty the restaurant was.",kFuqgoQCKs19a8-o2JvbYg,0,0,1,PALf6Ba__qxOTSkqILrf1A

The restaurant is filthy. Tables aren't being cleared or wipes down, salad bar was a mess. Veggies looked old and withered. It wasn't kept clean at all. Very disappointing and gross. The ice cream machine was also a mess. So dirty. The employees are standing around, drinking soda, not doing a thing. That restaurant needs some serious attention.

On the other hand, the Rainbow and 215 location has amazing service, a well kept restaurant, clean, and welcoming. I will definitely continue at that location and steer clear of Rampart.",Ds2rty7uFkGohiBNGLENqA,2,0,1,iWK5R72qhwNXvbpIuTn1Nw
1182819,2010-08-06,0,PgQZfKQwW6Q9fIvViD7Xrg,"Some people like it.  I went here on the recommendation of a cousin, and I was not impressed.  I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad, and found it very ordinary. 

Inside, it was cafeteria style seating with small tables crammed too close together, and lots of noisy kids.  I couldn't help but notice that a disproportionate number of the customers were overweight.  And it's a small wonder when you look at most of the items on the menu.

Almost every one of their sandwiches, clubs, and wraps, contain significantly more calories and cholesterol than, say, an In-N-Out cheeseburger, in many case over twice as much. 

To be fair, they do have a ""lighter menu"" with six items on it, but only one of those items has fewer calories than an In-N-Out cheeseburger.  However, you can also ask for smaller portions (like half-sandwiches) of most of the items on the regular menu.

Even though this is a deli that serves a lot of natural ingredients that are healthy, it also serves a lot of meats (advertised as lean), but no claims are made that the meats are free of nitrites or other chemical additives.  Since Jason's Deli does make claims that none of their ingredients contain trans-fat, MSG, or high fructose corn syrup (which is all good), I must assume that they have taken no steps to ensure that their meats are free of nitrites and other chemical additives, which (along with my unexceptional experience eating there) guarantees that I will stay away from this establishment in the future.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,1,0,2,DrMX0hPjWQFDYwVIOX77dw

Although their salad bar isn't as big as the one at Sweet Tomatoes, I like it nonetheless. Everything is fresh, and I like the crunch that their snack mix and whole-grain crackers provide. They also offer whole hard-boiled eggs if you need a little protein boost. And if you have a sweet tooth, there's free soft-serve ice cream to boot.

Sure, you can always get a sandwich or some soup. But if you're in the mood for a quick salad and you don't want to fill your head with a lot of options, give the salad bar at Jason's Deli a try.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,3,XR3Dk6FXs6n_syfHxvsvlA

Not much of a fan of soda anyway. 

Like all other locations, for all customers, free garlic toastettes, and muffins. I love getting a plate full of the brown ones. Always forget what they were called. But not too sweet. Super moist. Unique in flavor. Delicious ^_^ 

Pastrami Sourdough Meltdown was i believe $7 ? Smaller than the usual sandwiches you get from their menu (reuben the great, etc). The pastrami was nice and hot. The cheese was super melty. The sourdough was nicely toasted, not too hard. Best of all, even by the 2nd half, no soggy bottom piece of bread ! (experiences from the reuben the great...)

The baked potatoes we ordered(2) looked awesome in the container but when we opened them, the toppings were only a slight layer on top, we had to actually dig for the sour cream and finally found what appeared to be approximately a teaspoon all curdled, the cheese was one small glob of shredded cheese that was more rubbery than anything. We even hauled our own toppings out of our refrigerator and found these potatoes tasteless!! The potatoes at Wendy's are ten times better and much cheaper. There cheese on there potatoes is at least the liquid kind which should always be on a baked potato. The salsa that came with the blue corn chips was so nasty, it tasted and smelled like it was old tomato's stored for months.

I also love the club royale which comes on a fresh croissant with ham, turkey, tomatoes, bacon, swiss, cheddar, lettuce and honey mustard sauce, it's so so so good! 

The service is good and as you need to fill up on anything from the salad bar or drink station you walk up and get it yourself. They also have ice cream, free for all. It's a soft serve station and I love it! So overall this is a great spot and very casual. I also want to mention they have a wide variety of soups! I've tried a few of them and all were good. One of my favorites is the tomato soup that you can get with a grilled cheese sandwich.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,8,7,4,K8CLpUlOR2fOJX3KRYPURg

It's about the right proportions.  I got the corned beef on toasted sourdough and broccoli cheese soup and chips.  I love that they serve sweet tea as it is something I grew up with in the South.  I tend to make it half sweet tea and half regular tea.  And then there's the free ice cream cone which I actually passed on.  

I did notice they were doing some renovations to the restaurant so I would like to come back and see how it turned out.  Seems that they were pulling some booths away from the window.

If ordering to-go, they offer online and phone-in orders with a  separate counter entirely for takeout meals, which makes things go quicker.

They have about eight soups, most of which are fairly good but unfortunately they run out of some pretty frequently- last two times I've been, the broccoli cheese and tomato basil were both out. Less-common picks like the seafood gumbo are pretty solid, if a little heavy on the salt.

They have a soft-serve cone station for the dine-in salad bar participants, but I'd rather splurge on dishes like their salmon or chicken Veracruz if I want something hearty. Lots of options here. Maybe steer clear of the stuffed baked potatoes unless you're planning to split them among an entire family- they're enormous.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,3,yyn5SpVItX47YUCZ7vJjIg

My boyfriend and I came in Sunday about 6:30. We decided on the salad bar and a bowl of chili for me, and a sandwich and baked potato for him. I spent around $27. I got my salad plate and went over to the salad bar. I started making my salad, but found many of the toppings were low or out completely. No big deal, I just went and told the manager and she said someone would fill them up. This is not what happened though. I watched her walk over to the salad bar, look in some of the containers, and then to the back and bring out metal covers and place them over the items that were empty, then walk to the back not saying a word to me.

So my boyfriend goes up to another employee and asks wtf? He would have asked the manager, but she is now hiding in the back. Not very manager-like if you ask me. Anyway this girl goes and talks to the mgr for a minute and then comes to our table. She tells us they are out of many items because they had a large party the day before and pretty much wiped them out of a lot of items. Plus their delivery had not come in yet. Things like tomatoes, bell peppers, bacon, eggs and cheese, even croutons! All my favorite fixings for a yummy salad.

Here's the thing, I wouldn't have ordered the salad had someone told me this before. Considering that was my main meal, it should have been mentioned not just to me, but to everyone that ordered the salad bar. That, and the fact that the manager was hiding from us was a little irritating. We asked for a refund and went somewhere else.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,1,2,gBTOpZ7b9kz4jt7sZxKsHw

If you're coming here for the first time, I would recommend:

- don't miss out on the free self-serve corn bread and muffins at the end of the salad bar while you're waiting to be served

My transaction went smoothly so no complaints there. The chicken wraps, veggie wraps, salad, hummus, guacamole were OK. A little too bland but you can add hummus or guacamole to make it more flavorful.

I came here on two different occasions. I had the gumbo. Let's just say I'll just stick with ordering gumbo from Cajun/Creole joints from now on. On another visit, I ordered the Irish potato soup. It was alright, nothing memorable and not terrible.

However, I was horrified at my friend's grilled cheese sandwich. I could not believe anyone would serve a pathetic looking sandwich. Barely one slice (1/2, 1/3 of a slice of American cheese?) of overcooked, dry cheese that didn't cover the entire surface of wheat bread. 

In my mind, a grilled cheese sandwich is supposed to be comforting and have cheese covering the whole bread with generous amounts of butter. I should have taken a picture. It's one of the easiest things to make too. My friend's facial expression was one of huge disappointment. I don't think even kids would eat this kid favorite sandwich.

1. The Muffalettas: I can't seem to find a good muffaletta outside New Orleans but this one definitely makes up for that. The sandwich is enormous....fresh ham, salami, provolone cheese and a kick-ass olive spread that I wish I could bottle up and take home with me.

2. The New York Yankee: This sandwich is so good!!....but why does it have to be called a New York Yankee???

New York Yankee Sandwich = a winner in my book/ tastes great
New York Yankees = losers in my book/leaves a bad taste in my mouth

Doesn't add up....but I guess the fact that the baseball team is in second place/behind by about 20 games and this sandwich is my second fav. actually does!! Whew...thank God it's just a sandwich!!  Two of my favorite deli meats, corned beef and pastrami with swiss ( I always order extra cheese...tastes great) on rye.

I have been going to different Jason's Deli locations for probably 16+ years. I love the sandwiches but mostly, I am a huge fan of their salad bar. 

Today, I brought in a friend to have lunch with me. She had never been there before and we both got the salad bar. Along with my salad, I got a few spoonfuls of banana pudding. In my second bite of banana pudding, I discovered a stink bug by BITING into it. Its nasty little bug guts exploded into my mouth (which is why I know it was a stink bug, as well as the clearly identifiable pieces of bug I spit out after.) 

I made management aware, but the poor girl really didn't seem like she knew what to do to handle the situation. So they gave me some free cookies for my ""inconvenience,"" which is a nice gesture, but it doesn't quite make up for biting into a bug. This incident made me particularly upset because this was a chain I trusted to provide a consistent and positive experience every time. Definitely wasn't a good first impression for my friend, either. 

It makes me sad, but I'm going to have to find a new salad bar to frequent. 

I have attached pictures of my little stink bug friend who crashed my pudding.",QfBK0pNrJas7XqMqCD5Dww,3,0,1,uOx8lkkIO-H7iz-2obNwQg

Sure, Jason's Deli is a chain but they still make some pretty decent sandwiches at some very good value!!  My usual favorites are:

*Beefeater - 1/2 pound of roast beef, provolone, mayo (extra for me), toasted on New Orleans French bread with a cup of au jus.  Ask for a side of horseradish sauce!  Add a roasted red pepper from the salad bar too!  Trust me!

*Deli Club - ham, roasted turkey breast, bacon, cheddar, Swiss, lettuce, tomato, mayo (again, extra for me), on toasted multigrain wheat

Some tasty sandwiches done right!!  Don't forget the free sides of cornbread & pumpernickel mini-muffins, and assorted crackers from the salad bar!  Complimentary soft-serve too!!  A complete meal from start to finish, and we often leave with leftovers for later!  If you order right, you shouldn't be leaving Jason's Deli hungry!

Their salad bar and their massive baked potatoes are crowd favorites.  Their AYCE salad bar is actually cheaper than Sweet Tomatoes, with many comparable choices!  I like that Jason's Deli will sometimes serve alfalfa sprouts, even though they can be high on the bacteria.  And their salad bar serves whole boiled eggs!  Likin' their whole beets and pickle spears on the line too.  

Leave Jason's Deli light on the wallet too!  Many of their main entrees are priced at $10 or under.  Save that money for some bingo tickets!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,6,9,4,4Ezir_WS20hERBLPRoLulg

We escaped Red Rock and headed towards the Rampart-Charleston row of chain restaurants and retailers, maybe 10 blocks of regional and national eateries to choose from. Of the 30-40 choices, Jason's seemed a good lunch destination for the family.  

To add to Erika B's post, Jason's has a good selection of sandwich meat and hot lunch choices, and their French roll tasted fresh and was the right crispiness. The salad bar looked ok, and the dozen soup choices should please any palate.

It is clean, the employees are nice, and there is a large yummy menu here. Most of the items pictured are exactly how you will get your food. Sandwiches are generously filled with meat (comes with chips and a pickle). (Hubby and I split one and had a side of soup at home- we took it to go.) The counter is the left side front of the restaurant. The salad bar includes ice cream (*you can get a half sandwich and the salad bar or you can opt for just the salad bar*; both options are under $9.00 a person) is more towards the right, front of the restaurant. The seating is open and expansive. 

Once inside the car, we had another stop to make, the aroma of the sandwich was very inviting. At home, this sandwich never disappoints. Usually, at casino cafes, the bread is super greasy, so your fingers are covered in grease, and the meat is so-so, or lacking. Not this one, it's meaty, but the bread still has its shape (it's firm and toasted) and it's just a great sandwich overall.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,2,4,SqTb4EtgnMnepMt8APRG8A

I got the turkey bacon and avocado and the bf got the pastrami (i think!!) we ordered, paid, got our drinks, and some little muffins and bread! We took our seat and I tried all our little goodies... oh my they were delish! My son loved the hard bread and the bf liked the gingerbread. 

The wait wasnt long and our order was already coming out! I seen them and was super pleased! His sandwich was HUGE!! My little got the regular ham sandwich and was happy with it. My sandwich looked AMAZING! I was excited to eat it!! I took a bite and I swear I creamed my panties! It was soooo yummy!!! There was enough of everything in the sandwich, it was perfect! The bread was soooooo yummy as was the spicy mayo! I took a bite of his pastrami and was floored! I never had it before but this was insanely good! I kept stealing his meat that would fall out LOL. 

The service there was super good! They were very attentive and kind, the place was very clean and I seriously had no problems! We went back and I tried another sandwich (I dont remember what) which was also super delish! I also tried the strawberry shortcake and almost melted! If you look at the photos I have one in there!

It was so good I was sorry I ordered only half of the sandwich in favor of their half sandwich deal. The Sandwich Deal that I ordered came with a cup of soup, baked chips and a pickle spear for $8.29. I tried the Spicy Seafood Gumbo which was really too salty for me. I had three bites and I couldn't continue because it was that salty! I ordered an Organic Pomegranate Melon Tea that I thought would compliment the meal but my hopes fell flat. The tea was very bland I couldn't taste the pomegranate at all and the melon taste was barely there. The ordering was a bit confusing too because in front of carry out there are registers but they had me go all the way down to the other side of the deli to be rung up. I just think they should re invent their layout and the price of the special to stay competitive. I received a similar special at Heidi's Brooklyn Deli for only 5.99 and it was delicious.

4974806,2007-01-04,1,PgQZfKQwW6Q9fIvViD7Xrg,"The desire for Southern Sweet Tea brought me to Jason's Deli over a year and a half ago.  It was oh so good back then and I couldn't wait to have more!  I even had a chance to try their Muffalettas that time!

When I walked into Jason's Deli again, i was super excited!  I couldn't wait to get a big cup of Sweet Tea ($1.59)!  I opted for their Manager's Half Sandwich Special, which is half of any sandwich on the menu (excluding muffalettas) and your choice of one: cup of soup, read beans with sausage and rice, spicy gumbo, chili or fruit for $6.50.  I had the Grilled Portobello Panini ($6.50), 'grilled portobello mushroom marinated in leo's italian dressing, fresh avocado spread, homemade pico de gallo, fresh spinach, and asiago cheese that's pressed between olive oil basted french bread.'  This actually isn't on the menu, but it's the combination of the Chicken Panini and the Grilled Portobello Wrapini.  I had the Tomato Basil soup with my sandwich.  My panini was yummy, a bit small though, but still very good.  It also came with Jason's potato chips.  I had a few stale ones in my batch though.  And the soup was yummy as well. 

The BF had the Chicken Panini, 'marinated chicken breast with provolone cheese, basil pesto spread, sliced roma tomatoes and fresh spinach that's pressed between olive oil basted french bread' along with a cup of gumbo soup.  I just realized that I have no idea how his panini tasted because he never offered me a bite!  (Hmmff!  And you KNOW he got a bite of mine!)  I can't even comment on his gumbo either!

My friend had the California Club ($6.25), 'oven roasted turkey breast, homemade guacamole, tomato, sprouts, bacon, swiss, and mayo on a tasted all butter croissant.'  He proclaimed, ""It was the best sandwich I have ever had!""  Unfortunately, his wife had the Chicken Pot Pie which she said was not good at all.  She barely touched it.  

The cool thing about Jason's Deli is that they offer free refills on their beverages, free soft serve, and free muffins!  Unfortunately, they ran out of the Sweet Tea!  This was maddening and they claimed they didn't have anymore for a Saturday afternoon!  The BF and I were deeply distraught about this incident.  When we asked another employee if they refilled the tea yet, she replied, ""You can go up there and check...""  Gosh, I guess I'm used to a bit better customer service.  Oh well, what can you say?

Overall, at Jason's Deli you go up and give your order and then pay for it.  You take your number and help yourself to your own beverages.  Take a seat and wait awhile for your food. Your order is brought to you on a tray and that's the end of the customer service there.  The menu ranges from soups to salads to pasta to wraps to baked potatoes to favorite sandwiches to make your own sandwiches to muffalettas to po'boys to paninis and wrapinis and a few desserts even.  They have a pretty large menu to choose from.  Since April 15, 2005, all their restaurants became free of partially hydrogenated oils, which means ""no trans fat""!    

Yeah...I'll be back for their Sweet Tea...but you KNOW I'll be checking to make sure they have enough for our refills!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,2,3,7HCsBL2SrppfdfSovjfx3g

Oh how wrong I was. It's not boring. At all. A million ways to slice and dice your sandwich? They make their own chips? And a salad bar too? I almost forgot this was a chain for a second. 

Now I was hoping the salad bar was free with the order of a sandwich, but nope. That's a separate meal altogether. Now personally, I find that rather counterproductive seeing that there's not much to it in the first place. The end of the salad bar is the exception. You're allowed to eat crackers and garlic crostini while you wait for your food.

Speaking of food, I decided to order the Meatball sandwich. If there's one thing I love, it's a good Meatball sandwich. Definitely goes in the top five of my comfort foods. And crazy as it sounds, I must say, the Meatball Marinara from Subway is my personal favorite, with the Meatball sandwiches they used to serve at the grill at CSN being the runner up. I must say though, the Jason's meatball sandwich definitely blows both of those out of the water. Strongly seasoned, with sauce dripping out of the bread and oozing with cheese. If it wasn't almost $9.00, I'd swear off of Subway forever. 

I'd always be down for that Meatball sandwich, but like I said previously, there's a million ways to slice and dice your sandwich here, which means there's definitely some exploring that needs to be done. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Menu has a large variety
Quality ingredients
Not like Panera (which was what I was expecting)

Cons:
Kind of steep
The set up of the salad bar pricing

5466150,2010-05-20,2,PgQZfKQwW6Q9fIvViD7Xrg,"Holy Hell, I love Jason's Deli.

I try not to cover too many chain restaurants for my reviews, because it would be like writing that one Burger King is substantially different from the other 10,000 Whoppers you've eaten in your lifetime, but let me reiterate: I LOVE Jason's Deli.  So much so that if I were feeling more ""LEET"" at the moment, I would place a ""Less Than"" symbol followed by a number ""3"" after this declaration of affection, possibly adding multiple ""3"" symbols to really bring home the point that I'm steadfast in my affection for this place.

That said, I'm a soup and sandwich man.  This has a little bit of a New Orleans flair with muffalettas and gumbo, but there are all kinds of soups and sandwiches here.  Their broccoli/cheese soup is to die for, but their other soups are no slouch.

The menu changes with specials.  They have their staples, but sometimes, you can get things like Frito Pie, which hits the spot, or some other sandwich treat.  The best route in the ""Manager's Special"", which give you a cup of soup, a half sandwich, chips, a pickle and a soda for about $10.  You won't starve on this meal.  If you're not feeling the soup/sandwich route, there's always the salad bar.

The staff has always been friendly, and the service has always been good.  I've yet to be disappointed, and I view going here as a ""treat"".  It's great comfort food whether it's hot or cold outside.

We asked her about the salad bar and she seemed really annoyed about having to explain how it works.  When we put in our orders, she asked us what sides we wanted.  I asked her what type of fruits and veggies were offered and she straight up rolled her eyes naming off some fruits that did not even come with my wrap.  It wasn't a big deal, if she didn't know she should've just said so.

We ordered the Mediterranean wrap and the turkey wrap.  Both were from the low cal menu.  Both were not good.  There is significantly less meat, and that's fine because its a low cal wrap, but it was really boring.  The side of vegetables it came with looked really old and was over cooked.  The hummus from the Mediterranean wrap was really grainy in texture, and to top it off there was a piece of rock in there.  I have no clue where that would even come from.  The manager was really nice about it, but didn't seem to know how to handle the situation much.  We didn't ask for a comp, and he didn't offer either, but he did offer to swap it for something else.

While I was eating, I saw a guest loading up his plate from the salad bar.  He was grabbing some hummus and used his finger to scoop it out of the spoon onto his plate.  He then licked his finger, grabbed something else, came back to the hummus and did the same thing.  Wow, that was disgusting, and one of the reasons why I avoid AYCE joints like this.  

Anyway, this whole experience left a foul taste in my mouth.  There are plenty of other places in Vegas that also specialize in sandwiches.  I'll go there before ever coming back to Jason's deli.  hah.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,5,1,1,yTwRIamfP5dE4_vhWxIyRQ
