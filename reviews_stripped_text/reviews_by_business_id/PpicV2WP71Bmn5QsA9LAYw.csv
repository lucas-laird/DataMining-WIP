The pizza and fried zucchini are great. We also grabbed a bucket of hot Buffalo wings with our beers and this was awesome  (8).",G0BxLN3TDXA9n2TlMwvxfw,1,1,5,QCLiq64l0KSk6p1TaVht7A

An entertaining bunch of people in this place where the locals are local. I love drinks and the setup. Good prices, good pours, and super cool bartenders. I will be there again. Only minus is they dont serve food. You can get it next door but its much better if its all in one. Also the fod next door is Italian and Pizza mostly. So in a bar I want a bar burger and some calamari.. not pizza.. just fyi

See u there!",_i3IZYU28R3xgV4hxkmKjw,1,2,4,t7i5KQBJH6DtYXtkRgrT3Q

Great place for cheap drinks ($2 PBR and $4 Jameson shots...which is cheap for Vegas) and the bartenders are always ready to join you for a shot (my love to Brett, Fred, Scott, Daniella, Jena). If you are looking for a fancy-shmancy place...don't come here because they will laugh at you the minute you walk in. If you want a place to chill out, have an inexpensive drink and engage in some interesting conversation (usually about music) then you have found your Graceland.",COjPTDD-tFr73Gly2xL3gw,3,2,5,ZZ0fMypE93MfOc0PU-ZDxQ

4165955,2018-01-19,1,PpicV2WP71Bmn5QsA9LAYw,"So apparently there are stand up comedians that are pitting there works up here at night. Me and my friends went bere around 11 o clock. And this stand up comedian started to have discrimantion jokes around me. Of course other people were laughing and some were worried that the jokes were going a little too far ahead. However, the experience that we had was awful, the comedian leaned against our table talking about stuff like if we dont understand. Apparantely i have lived in the U.S more than half of my life and i was able to understand what he qas saying. He said stuff like ""i dont care what i even say because they are not going to understand me anyway"" all the discrimination and stereotypes offended very well, if that was his point. As we were about to leave, he told us to continue our miserable life as an asian and we surely did not appreciate his comment. Hope this place does not have any stand up comedians who does not appreciates their own costumers.
Overall, the experience here was terrible thanks to him and i am definately sure that i am never going here again.
P.s. hopefully the owner hires stand up comedians who fully appreciates their customers and someome who is not a racist.
Thank you",-irjG6JQCUB45DNNM9PJdg,0,0,1,Yy1sFSSbBZGi7Zk5Q2N5LA
4250204,2017-05-05,1,PpicV2WP71Bmn5QsA9LAYw,"This is another fun little dive. Cheap drinks, fun bartenders, a decent jukebox - what more could you need? 

On Thursdays, they have an open mic comedy show. The comics can be a little hit or miss, but they're more hit than miss most of the time! The host is great, he caters to folks there for the show, and even those who didn't know there would be a show at all. 

There's a decent pizza joint adjacent - it's definitely a step above ordinary bar food. 

Every time I've been there, I've had fun.",FW-U6120E6pV0QMpmkFjZA,2,1,4,NZ4-mvNbudQS4VDaXo0Itw

Nothing much to look at, pretty small but a neighborhood bar for locals with decent food. The pizza could've been cooked a little longer-limp crust. The philly was cooked-ribeye steak with cheeze & onions,peppers and mushrooms.WHAT is with NOBODY using WHIZ!!!!

Not bad for a bar but nothing spectacular. Now that I know they deliver I might get some fingers and wings another time.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,4,2,3,HTd1sODgJiyPTRSLsEh-jQ
4451666,2011-08-09,0,PpicV2WP71Bmn5QsA9LAYw,"Motor City is located in a strip mall off Paradise. You'll miss it if you're not looking for it, as it is lost in the sea of neon signs. It's a typical Las Vegas bar, although it does have a stage area with seating. 

They do a lot of live music, and currently have a new bartender who is booking shows. I know her, as she is my very good friend!

Overall, this is a cool place to grab a drink, usually very quiet during the day and kind of busy at night and on the weekends. if you're looking for live music (metal, punk, etc) head down here.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,4,ah0dYvodC6mM0LGpFuTMbw

It's a dive for sure. Full of smoke and drunks. The moment I walked in there was a VERY drunk man starting a fight. I stuck it out though. The bartender dealt with it like a PRO. We had a drink and ""enjoyed"" the open mic night for a while.
I didn't have the food, but I have heard good things. 
I had to use the men's restroom because someone was sick in the women's... I have to say it is the cleanest smelling dive bar men's restroom I have ever been in.
I may go back for another round of open mic debauchery in the near future",WwoM6hQbgPnzcX3taqK-xQ,1,1,4,riZ2XCsjmnUBdgb89WvWBA

There is not much to this bar, but its good if you want good quality with out the crowds. Surprisingly they have some fancy unique types of booze. Like Cilantro vodka, and Jalape√±o. It can get crazy in there, and the people behind the bar seem more than willing to experiment with some of the weird stuff. This place is fun I guess... I like their little kitchen, I think its good for those who get a little too tips, they need a nibble.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,2,0,4,FEbB9RRipzOoxGpV0zhflw
