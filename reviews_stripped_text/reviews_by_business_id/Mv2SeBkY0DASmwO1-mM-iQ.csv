If I was paying five or six bucks I probably just shut my mouth but for chips and a drink and a sandwich it was $17 and change so I expect better quality.

But there are a few issues with it that hold it back from being an airport food option to seek out.

1) It's not clear where you stand in line to order. Not a huge problem, but my boyfriend and I walked back and forth from one end of the counter to the other, convinced we were going the wrong way. My boyfriend called this the Las Mkt Mambo. (He thinks he's clever.) 

For the record, line up on the end opposite the registers.

And we weren't the only people doing this. A couple of people after us asked where the line ends, and an angry man in front of us berated the cashier for the confusion. Some ""Order Here"" and ""Pay Here"" signs would work wonders.

2) And speaking of the cashier, he was also the line cook and prep cook -- pretty much every role along the line. He was working hard, and it seemed the few other employees were working hard. Yet it took a while for orders to be placed. There was a bottleneck of people waiting on their food by the registers. 

My bf was standing behind me in line, but there was probably 7-10 minutes between when I ordered and received my food and when he was finally asked what he wanted. 

If you're in a hurry to make a flight, check to see how the line is moving first.

3) The price. I get it -- it's an airport. Food isn't necessarily economical. 

But my Gobbler sandwich (turkey, cranberry aioli, stuffing, gravy) costed about $10. It does not come with sides or chips or fruit, though I was happy to see healthy options offered. And it's pretty standard, sandwiched between two slices of average-sized, bakery-style sourdough. 

Again, I was drawn in by the bacon and didn't really notice the prices until I had to pay. That's on me. But now you are are forewarned. 

When I finally received my sandwich, which was served hot, it was pretty good. I liked the mix of stuffing and sweetness from the aioli. It definitely beat out a fast-food hamburger. 

But Las Mkt could be an eatery to search out when you're awaiting a flight at LAS. That's the most frustrating part. It has potential that could be realized with just a few tweaks.",QiciohgD8N6vCty4vGL3pQ,12,6,3,EiCxA4wF2hFl-o0VXsrYUA

The ""steakhouse blue"" sandwich was AMAZING. It probably could have been a little warmer, but I almost want to go buy a second one right now. 
The staff could've been a little warmer as well, but I don't know how much I can hold that against them. 
Would definitely eat here again, I forgot how much I liked this place! When you compare it to most airport food spots, this one is a CLEAR WINNER. :)",raIRUt4xr9XrUExiTKmTGQ,2,1,4,bJvdj9dEr035k1CHOoGxxw

Bread was ice cold and chewy, very chewy. Chicken was very poor as well. My wife's ham and cheese was just that, no tomatoes or lettuce. Menu said spicy mustard and they were out. Nite to self and anyone who finds themselves in the Las Vegas airport should avoid this place. A bag of chips from store would have been better, at least would be edible. One of the worst places I have ever tried to eat at.",sBx0N3deAJy99I-2wJagfg,0,0,1,kRDbjbsAo839UOzprDU0Iw
