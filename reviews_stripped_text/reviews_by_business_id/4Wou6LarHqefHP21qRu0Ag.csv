41922,2016-02-05,0,4Wou6LarHqefHP21qRu0Ag,"This place is disgusting. It's been going downhill for months now. It's obvious the owner is a cheap bastard and does not care about their workers or keeping customers. Every time I visit they only have one worker doing the cashiering then making the food. Your order if it is correct the first time takes at least 20 minutes. I'm not a big smoothie fan but I enjoy the sandwiches. Well they used to have a drink station which has been removed and now only serve bottled water. This particular visit they were out of bottled water so the only drink option besides a smoothie was tap water. And their sides the only option is plain chips. Everything else was out of stock according to the cashier. And the place is a mess. Not only do they not clean the place by the sitting area, but the food prep area was a complete mess. I can't believe the health department has not shut it down. See the attached picture...All the booth seating are broken and they don't even hand out napkins with the order because they're so cheap. It is completely obvious the owner is cutting costs and running that place as thin as possible. I even mentioned something to the poor girl that was working there for probably minimum wage and she agreed. She said she wishes the customers would complain to corporate and the owner. I feel so bad for those young workers. Anyway stay away from this location....",_ouYcn3z_1SlY-Nb0fbkWw,0,0,1,RtOLtJSfXas74XR3-aJ60Q

I have yet to encounter an employee at this location with one ounce of customer service skills in their blood. I downloaded the TSC app and tried to use it to pay today but for some reason Shawnee the cashier did not know how to use the scanner she told me she doesn't know how this thing works and she doesn't use that app and if she was me she would delete my credit card from the app. You would think that a company that spent so much on advertising and has promotional brochures about downloading and using the rewards app would train their employees a little bit better on the app. So needless to say I did not get my rewards credit for this purchase and also she was very unfriendly and when she brought the smoothies out she made me feel like a total inconvenience. She just set them on the counter and turned around. Time and time again this has been the story at this location terrible customer service.

""Grilled tilapia, spicy cilantro sauce, shredded cabbage and a roasted pineapple salsa with diced red onion and cilantro. Served in a flour tortilla."" 

I actually laughed when I opened my tacos. Each taco had fish, some sauce, and maybe one pineapple chunk, no cabbage whatsoever. (See photo) Really pathetic. Clearly this specific location needs to figure a few things out from the other reviews. 2 stars because they get the job done, just not very well at all.

Also, don't ever call in. When I did during the week (I work nearby), the girl seemed unhappy to take my call, not very polished on the phone, had to repeat things multiple times, and we still didn't get everything correct.

I was in the area and looking for something on the healthy side and as I drove through this parking lot, I stumbled upon this place. 

When I walked in, I was unable to order because the cashier was counting her till. No big deal. She had a new young lady take my order who admittedly started 5 minutes ago. Again, we all have had our first day on the job so no big deal. The one thing that I highlighted for the young lady as she wrote down my order was that it was to have no cheese because I am allergic to cheese. 

As I paid, the lady who was training the other young lady rehashed my order for a chicken wrap. I ordered a bowl not wrap, so this was the first point of my frustration. 

About three or four minutes later I got my food. When I walked in I was the only customer in the building and the time from walk in until I got the wrap was about 17 or 18 minutes. 

I was in somewhat of a hurry so I went to sit down and eat the wrap and the first thing I noticed when I opened it was that it had cheese on it. 

By this time, I literally had no time left so I gave the uneaten wrap back to the lady at the counter and left. 

This was without a doubt one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Not only would I never go back to this location, I don't think I'd ever go to another tropical smoothie anywhere. 

$8.65 for a bag of chips.

-Smoothies are strangely bland but sugary, and depending on what you get, poorly blended and/or watery
-Food is a step up from McDonald's 
-Service... always poor. The 2 girls today seemed to be very sweet and personable, however their non-stop conversation with each other was their top priority, with business and blending/preparing food coming in second. Not to go off on a rant, but it is called work... most of us also have jobs (one of mine happens to be in a restaurant), it's very hard not to be super annoyed with people who look at there job as some inconvenient interruption from what sounded like some of the more unimportant ""drama"" I've heard in my life. Tropical Smoothie must have an overworked or nonexistent management team... so I'll tell you on be half of them.

After 3 minutes another customer came in and the mopper came over to the register. Never acknowledged me. Looked right passed me to the other customer. He had money out and I realized he ha left to get money to pay for his order. Again not a big deal. After he was done, she again never said a word to me, just starred. I asked for juice by itself. 
Finally, she speaks!! ""the juice is all put away for the night, we close soon."" 
I asked, "" you close at 9, right?""
""uh huh""
I looked at my watch, looked at her.  Again. Just a blank stare. I left the store and went to the bar a few doors down and was given a glass of cranberry juice for free.

When I asked what she could offer meal wise after standing in line for 5min she rudely said nothing, ""I'm only doing drinks""! Pretty pathetic to blame our local National Guard base for your managements poor planning ability at four casting supply on demand is a joke!

I walked into this location and no one was at the cash wrap. There was one customer waiting. Two employees were on the clock at this time. The other customer got his 6 smoothies and exited. Then another associate came strolling in and clocked in. They were joking and laughing in the back then this little kid emerges (probably like 16). I ordered a wrap and asked if it came with a side (which I knew it did bc the menu said so). He replied with an ""I'm not sure.""  After pressing several buttons he said yes. So I order. My smoothie came pretty quickly and was fairly delicious. 
But overall the place wreaked of bleach and was pretty dirty upon first impression. They have an ""A"" rating from the Nevada health board though?

Customer Service: 4/5 This place hires many high school aged employees and you can tell from walking in that they have to work on their meet and greet. Overall they are always nice and pleasant but sometimes they leaving craving a little bit more.

Da products: 4/5 I like the stuff they offer as far as shakes and food items. It's nothing too fancy as far food but the shakes are on point. Overall I will go for the shakes the food its alright.

Da price: 5/5 They give an excellent military discount specially when I'm in uniform. I'm very impressed wight he store owners that they do such a great discount, by far the best that I have ever received, thank you for your support of the armed forces as well as our boys in blue and red.

Da good: The coupons!!! at least once a week I'm receiving coupons from Tropical smoothie and they always have great sales going on. 
Also the wait times are great, i have gone in when I'm the only client and I have gone in when they are really busy, no matter what they have always been quick with the products and the quality has never suffered.

Da ugly: Customer service and the taste of the food can be thing they work on.

Overall: This place is great the kids have good spirits, and always competing to see who can make the fastest product or improving on their service time. The sales coupons always makes it a cheap fast food option that its the healthy side.

It's Sunday, I have just watched three groups of people leave rather than wait. I did the same thing yesterday. I feel for the employees. Pretty sure there are franchise standards with respect to speed. I love tropical smoothie but I will have to get my fix at the Blue Diamond store- it's a training store so they always have plenty of people working.",tBp5UzcZS7XH0IpmzAeWjg,0,0,1,VTlmPeqKRqfhrpZtvDGygw

Ordered a chicken salad sandwich toasted, baked lays chips and a smoothie. Got a salad and a smoothie. This was ordered on UberEATS as I'm working from home today, so paid 4.99 for delivery. Horrible! They don't answer their phone, so I can't even let them know.",Htz68DhJ4e0HN_unxvLVpQ,0,0,1,B-Ihx6FtiIxzo2MymxgEsA
