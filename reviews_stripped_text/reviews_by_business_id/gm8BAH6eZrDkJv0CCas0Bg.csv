She explained all of the inner workings of the fondue experience and what to expect with each dish. Jessica was wonderful in consistently checking in on us to make sure we were well taken care of. 
Now the food... it was f*cking phenomenal. The cheese fondue was hot and melty with cool apple slices, tender potatoes, salami and baguette cubes. The steak fondue comes raw and you cook it in this fantastic broth and then dip it into horseradish, bernaise, chimichurri or a red wine reduction. The shrimp fondue is also raw and cooked in a delicious broth with hot mustard, chimichurri or a chili sauce. Each of the fondues also come with some delicious sides. They recommend you get their fries as a side and I do too as they are out of this world delicious! At then end, even if you are bursting at the seams, you must get the chocolate fondue. You will wonder how you ever lived your life without it. 
Endless wine served in baby bottles and craft cocktails are the special final touches that make this meal delicious and enjoyable. The atmosphere and the music are lively and fun. 
Run, don't walk here and try to sit at Leah's table.",oDzcyI-nTTs1WKdllBZmYg,1,4,5,S72jFIbv8I-5e8P3I5F6nQ

They have amazing selection of fondues! You have to go there & try it to see for yourself. I was in love with their backyard/ outdoor bar. It's in the back through the restaurant. The sitting is super unique & they use vintage perfume puff bottles filled with liqueurs for the mixing of some signature cocktails. Gotta check this place out! Best customer service.

235744,2016-02-23,1,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"This is a fun place to go if you want a ""fun"" meal- not if you're actually hungry. It's great that you have free wine with any of the fondue options you can order and there's a full bar in the back patio if you want a cocktail. The wine is served in glass baby bottles and you're charged a $0.51 fee for for the nipple. 
We ordered the steak fondue, the cheese fondue and the chocolate fondue. The steak fondue comes with hot oil for you to cook your steak in and dipping sauces for the steak. Chimichurri, A-1, garlic butter and horseradish. It also comes with bread, kale salad and roasted potatoes for $25. The steak and all of the sides were very good.
The cheese fondue comes with salami, roasted potatoes, green apples and bread for $22. The chocolate fondue comes with strawberries, bananas, homemade pound cake and rice crispy treats for $9. If you want more sides it's an extra $5. 
The decor is very red light district and the back patio will be a hot spot when the weather is warm. The music was too loud in my opinion- if it was just a bit lower we could have actually had a conversation without yelling across the table. The service was great, it was just annoying that the flames kept going out underneath the cheese. 
This being a new place I highly recommend making a reservation- we tried to get in at 6:30pm and had to wait to come back at 9pm on a Saturday night.",UaGKqcjVs-CORc6Tdw_62A,5,2,4,AaN59OxHP-Q5-TA8kGKd3w

396315,2015-12-23,0,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"My husband and I went here on the second night F. Pigalle was open, and it did not disappoint!  First of all, the decor transports you straight to a brothel in the Montmatre district in Paris.  I loved the graffiti art all over the walls, including in the bathrooms and the outdoor lounge area.  Everywhere you look, you're seeing a new detail.  

The food was excellent.  We ordered the steak fondue (with the intention of returning to try the cheese fondue next time, of course) and french fries.  The waiter gave us instructions on how long to cook the steak in the heated oil they placed on our table.  The steak also came with delicious cooked kale and potatoes on the side.  It also came with four delicious dipping sauces that I won't be able to do justice by describing them here.  You'll just have to go there to try them.  They also serve wine in baby bottles.  This does not seem weird at all after your second swig of delicious wine.  Make sure to ask your server the story behind the bottles.

There also was a full bar of handsome bearded bartenders in the backyard/outdoor lounge area.  Okay, I don't exactly remember if they all were bearded, but they certainly were handsome and knowledgeable.  Most importantly, they poured excellent, carefully crafted drinks.  The hospitality all around (waiter, front of house guy, bartenders) was on par with what you'd find at any world class restaurant.  

We really enjoyed this place.  I intend to return with friends soon and highly recommend that you do too.",a31Q_q1pebf7gje1XQMSlA,1,0,5,Feorwa3VBhUspIL9cHbe3g
418532,2016-01-27,1,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"I went to this place with a local who had me intrigued about the idea of wine in baby bottles. This place offers one-of-a-kind experience-- if you are open to fun.

Let's start with the ambiance-- Paris' Red Light District meets San Francisco's Mission District. The style is certainly creative and a great conversation piece. Though this place is relatively small, they've created a balanced atmosphere that is conducive to intimate, engaging, entertaining conversations.

Their menu is pretty simple-- the choices being cheese, shrimp, and steak (each with a variety of sides for dipping). Our group got all three fondues plus the must-have fries. The cheese fondue was heavenly-- a perfectly melted Gruyère. And of course who could resist the chocolate fondue. 

Let's talk about the endless wine in baby bottles. Though it left me scratching my head, it was definitely fun and made for a cool experience. And it was actually pretty tasty. We also had the opportunity to try some of their craft cocktails--yum! 

As for the service-- our server was fun, attentive, and helpful. 

There is a surprisingly beautiful patio area in the back that would be lovely on a warmer day. 

Overall, this is not your typical fondue experience-- and that's exactly why people go there!",6b1AZaUoydGFl3kKGBKhhg,1,1,5,DWIivVEnlj099X8Bcc0J2Q

Ate here last night, they don't have menus to give people, which would've been nice over the blaring music and other people. Our waitress was trying to tell us the whole menu, while it was also hard to hear over all the noise. Once we got our food our fires went out every couple minutes constantly. We were always trying to flag down someone to change it since our waitress was no where to be found and never checked back on us once we got our food. We also weren't even given a cocktail menu even though it was our friends birthday so we had to snag one from another table. The food was mediocre and since our fires kept burning out the process took even longer. Please make sure you guys are checking on all your guests who are dining in with you from time to time.

The menu is small and there were four of us so we ordered the complete menu.

The shrimp were well seasoned and after 45 seconds in the hot broth perfectly cooked.  All dipping sauces for the beef and the shrimp had great flavor and all came with different flavor profiles so no matter your palate you will enjoy them.  The dessert was good, a rich chocolate fondue with fruit, pound cake and rice crispy treats.  

The food was very good, much better than I thought fondue could be and staff was extremely helpful.   I highly recommend visiting this restaurant.  I will be back.",yLifgvTzpXj8Mrdl09M5mA,3,1,5,s3oBS5yoY9xxaXBT4i5SSg

1169212,2016-04-12,0,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"I'm surprised that this place got so many awesome reviews.  I'm glad I didn't read any of the reviews before I went, because I would have been completely disappointed.  In fact, I literally knew three things about this place:

1. Fondue
2. Downtown
3. It's new

Walking in and seeing the mannequin and counter with various contraptions and butt plugs was unexpected.  lol  The condom business cards were a cool touch.  I get it... places downtown have a theme.  I can get down with that.

I'm used to having fondue at the Melting Pot, so I was surprised to see that there were no options for different cheeses, meats (other than steak and shrimp), broths, or chocolates.  We ordered the steak (cooked with oil), a side of fries (which were delicious, by the way) and the dessert (dark chocolate with an admittedly generous portion of things to dip in it).  

The waitress brought out the fries first (which were REALLY good, and a huge portion).  Then she brought out complimentary edamame hummus, with was okay.  The pita chips were very good, though.  The steak came out with potatoes and cucumber salad, both of which were very good.  The steak was just okay.  I'm not a big fan of fondue with oil, but we didn't have a choice, since we picked the steak.  They brought out three dipping sauces: a horseradish thing (which I liked, but found it kind of ordinary), something that tasted like A-1 sauce, and something that looked like it was supposed to be a buttery herb sauce, but it just tasted like oil.  Or oil butter.

The chocolate fondue tasted like plain melted dark chocolate.  I felt that it lacked depth.

If it wasn't for the fries, I don't think the two of us would have been full.

Oh, my friend had the wine (it was bottomless, after all), but I don't drink.  I could see AYCD wine sealing the deal for a first time patronage.  For the price, and if you don't mind drinking lower end wine, this is a very good value.

The waitress, although very nice and helpful, kept forgetting to bring out the wine.  After we were done, we waited for far too long for our check.  The restaurant wasn't busy; there were four other tables seated, if I remember correctly.  

I would come back if other friends made up their minds that they wanted to come here.  Other than that, it doesn't make my list of places to return.",_kIlFHUnTg17fJ7MToNe0w,4,2,3,vYIx_Yb9MHAuZNNYKNVYaQ

1403515,2016-03-03,0,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"Super unique spot in downtown that features a simple, but tasty menu of Fondue. I imagine that it is hard as a restaurant to stick out amongst the crowd of other trendy restaurants in the downtown area, but this place has a great concept.

I am a big fan of echo and rig in summerlin and heard it is the same chef at F Pigalle, so we decided to try it out last Saturnight. Walking in, there is a bondage-esc/French theme (which was not offputing, just surprising. There was a lot of people there because it was a Saturnight night and I got really good vibes from the place. We were seated immediately and the waitress approached of very quickly. The menu is on the wall and is very simple: Cheese fondue, beef fondue, shrimp fondue, desert fondue and some sides. The BEST part is that each fondue comes with ALL YOU CAN DRINK wine! Sign me up stat!]

We ordered the cheese fondue, shrimp fondue and fries. The waitress brought our wine (which everyone already knows is served in baby bottles). You only have an option for either red or white wine and you can tell it is not expensive wine, but it was not terrible and did the trick. The white is very sweet and the red is pretty dry. The waitress also brought us some pickled vegetables to start which were amazing and I ordered 4 plates lol.

The cheese fondue came out first and it was a pretty storng french cheese. Still yummy though, but my husband doesnt like pungent cheese so he barely ate any. It was served with apples, bread, potatoes, and salami (although we dont eat salami so we got extra bread). Next, the shrimp fondue and the sides. Shrimp was good and not spicy (even though it is advertised as such), with pineapple rice, bread, and some roasted veggies. I didnt taste any pineapple in the rice. The side of fries were huge and DELICIOUS. Unfortunately, we did not have room for desert, but was told by other patrons that it is delicious. Next time!

Let's talk food & wine- First off, as soon as you get seated you're welcomed with a plate of delicious pickled veggies. We ordered all of the fondue options- shrimp, cheese, steak and dessert for the sake of not holding back. Every side sauce was so deliciously unique and savory. The best part is the all you can drink wine served out of baby bottles. I have to admit, I thought it would be weird but I quickly got over it as everyone else was doing it. Four bottles later, we all felt like we were at a really cool house party (not in Vegas). 

Let's talk atmosphere- I don't want to give too much away as entering the space is an experience of its own but a cool graffiti wall had me glancing at it several times, always discovering something new. Whoever chose the sexy music playlist and lighting knew what they were doing.

2193209,2016-02-26,1,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"Fun place! I discovered this via Yelp, and I'm glad that I did. We came early on a Sunday evening and had no problem getting a seat - not sure if they get busier later in the evening, or on a weekend. Be warned, you should probably make sure you have the address first, as the restaurant doesn't actually have the name ""F Pigalle"" anywhere outside. Instead, it has dark windows illuminated by neon lights that say ""hot, dip""...and something else I can't remember, but  makes it seem vaguely like a strip club or some other adult entertainment establishment. That's actually what we thought it was at first. 
You go inside, and are immediately greeted by the mannequin dressed in bondage and a stripper poll, dark walls, ghastly red light, graffiti art on the walls and an odd smell.
Our server was very friendly, and helpful. Everyone gets pickled veggies to start as they decide on what to eat. The menu is so simple, it's written on a chalk board: 1 appetizer (fries), 3 entrees (beef, shrimp, cheese fondu), and 1 dessert. We opted for the cheese and shrimp options. Oh man, the shrimp was SOOOO good! The broth was delicious! As were the dipping sauces! The cheese was also good, but the shrimp broth really stole the show! We ended up dipping random other things from the cheese fondue selection into the shrimp broth. As others have mentioned you get free, unlimited wine if you order a fondue entree. The white wine was a bit sweet, and the red was thankfully drier. 
We asked our server about the wine in baby bottles. Apparently Napoleon tried to levy a tax on wine glasses, so Parisians responded by drinking wine out of baby bottles. And hence, we were now drinking wine out of baby bottles. 
After our dinner, our server topped off our wine and we went to the back patio to sit for a bit. It's kitschy but somehow oddly charming, and if I lived in Vegas, I'd probably be a regular at their back bar!",UMD7kQkVPOvjiaFS6Z0CKQ,2,2,4,5lfXuIhK3F1u0CCNtXG-JA

We had a fondue with friends night and let me tell you this, everyone left completely stuffed! The wine was flowing, the cheese was bubbling, the steak was sizzling; it was a hands on, fun night!

The menu is extremely minimal - you choose from cheese, shrimp, steak & chocolate fondue. We ordered a few of each to share between 6. Each fondue set comes with their own accoutrements or sauce variety and they also serve ""all you can drink"" red or white wine in glass baby bottles with disposable plastic nipple tops (which comes automatically with the meal!) It's not top-shelf wine (just a basic semi sweet white or dry red), but it's the thought that counts! I'm sure your face will light up too when you learn the wine is constantly flowing, all night, until you say you're done! I enjoyed the cheese fondue and the shrimp fondue a lot! Although, the sticky rice that arrived with the shrimp fondue was a miss since it was rock hard and didn't compliment the meal. The steak fondue wasn't terrible, but it wasn't exciting either. The chocolate set was my least favorite, since I felt the dark chocolate was too strong and bitter; I wish they offered a milk chocolate blend, or even better, white chocolate! Unfortunately, the sauces were one-note and not too thrilling; a major bummer since I'm a sauce junkie. For the majority, I tasted a lot of butter or oil. Let's just say, they all tasted like they were an afterthought and needed some love.

Sauces aside, our party vibed to the risqué boudoir ambiance that you would find in the Red Light District of Paris. Our table was taught a fascinating history lesson about why baby bottles were one of the choice vessels to drink wine in France. We also luckily peeped some unexpected entertainment, one of the male waiters climbed up all the way to the top of the stripper pole and gave us a show! It was an even better show when tipsy patrons tried to take a swing on the pole. Too funny!

The restaurant is very cozy! You may be able to fit 60 people into this small space on a good night. Though, I won't be surprised if you have a long wait to dine during prime dinner hour. Show up early, or reservation is key! There's are a ton of hidden quirks about this gem that a lot of visitors will find interesting: Their business cards are actual condoms, the scantily clad mannequin dressed in lingerie greeting you at the door, the mysterious open air bar area in the back of the restaurant, the huge collection of glass baby bottles on display, the waitresses wearing fish net leggings with short shorts & cleavage tops, the waiters suited in vintage bartender garb; all-in-all, you will be in for a treat and transported to the era.

This spot is inventive and making heads turn! It's also a completely different concept than their sister restaurant ""Echo & Rig."" It's grittier and grungier. But a welcome addition to the Downtown Fremont Street Experience! Actually, it fits perfectly with the bustling downtown scene. It's definitely a great place to take your friends and I can vouch for a good time! When I dip, you dip, we dip!

The offerings on the night we went included 3 choices of main: cheese, steak or shrimp fondues, and chocolate fondue for dessert.  The two of us shared a cheese and a chocolate fondue, and both were excellent.  The cheese was delicious, with a perfect consistency.  It came with cubes of bread, yummy sausage, baby fingerling potatoes and green apple.  The chocolate fondue was rich and creamy, with just the right % of chocolate, and came with cubes of Rice Krispies treats and pound cake, and slices of strawberry and banana.  We also shared a side of French fries, which came with ketchup and sriracha mayo.  The fries were good on their own, better dipped in the mayo, and out of this world when twirled in the cheese.

The dinner fondues come with all-you-can drink Chablis or Pinot Noir, served in a baby bottle with the nipple cut wide enough that drinking's no effort.  However, their mixed drinks are original and delicious.  We tried two cocktails, one, a violet-infused gin and champagne cocktail, had a delicate floral taste, and puss-in-boots, a punch-like drink for two served in a large glass shaped like a boot, was strong and refreshing.

The restaurant is perfect for date night, or a fun night out with friends.  The ambiance is moody and eclectic, and the playlist is on point.  What could be better than to spend the evening playing with your food?",PhRj3okiYEWNLnlCihwOHA,0,0,5,EYuMn3u_x-7KUl5BeAIM0g
2659235,2016-02-10,17,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"In its continuing mission to cement Downtown Las Vegas as the Hipster Grand Central of Las Vegas, this restaurant takes über trendy hipster to a whole new level. 

Lacking a pronounced sign, this restaurant is easy to miss. A dark tinted front window coupled with a nondescript glowing white globe light with the name on it. 

Upon entry, you chuckle at the vintage, and kinda creepy, furnishings out of a French Red Light district. Burlesque furnishings, S&M mannequin, and kitsch antiquities that I can only assume that the owner sniped off eBay at 3am on some idle Tuesday. We were quoted 20 minute wait time and we walked to the bar out back. The bar is awesome. Vintage sofas and chairs, ashtrays, vintage worn out floor coverings and an über hipster multi leveled seating area that resembles shipping crates covered in old fashioned woven rugs. That was something out of the TV show Friends and I could easily see all five of them laying down and chatting over coffee. 

We were called to our table by the extremely friendly and all-smiles hostess named Jessica. To be clear, Jessica with her perpetual smile and friendly demeanor is the only reason that I decided to grant a 4/5 instead of 3/5. 

It is a fondue restaurant. A chance to see what was in that dusty still-sealed box that your parents got as a wedding gift in the 1980's that they couldn't give away at the last family yard sale. 

The menu is light and is fairly pricey considering you cook the food at your table. Cooking beef in oil and shrimp in an aromatic spice mixture that is water and cream based I believe. Our waiter had a pointy waxed mustache and was as hipster as you can get. Nice guy and very acclimated to the menu. 

Service was good and the place was packed. The experience is what makes this place. The food by itself is probably a 3 at best. They give you unlimited wine in a baby bottle and charge you for the nipple. I would have liked to see an option to get soda or cheap beer instead of wine. 

Overall, I'm glad to see Downtown Las Vegas revitalized, and if I was about 14 years younger, I would probably dine at this place again and again. As I'm not, I'll leave it with the same opinion that I have of Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"": I'm glad I saw it and experienced it once, but I really have no desire to ever do it again.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,25,17,4,_8Lp1oYW5L4LTvCxoheydA

I got the white wine which I thought was pretty decent. I came here for a friend of a friend's birthday & it was on a weekday. So I thought..hey!

Possibly 15+ people came and I thought it was awesome for the waiter and waitress to accommodate each and one of us.  The vibe was super chill but the place is a tad small.

So not worth it. Also the cooks could be heard talking,cussing and just terrible atmosphere. They need a price for all you can drink wine that is separate from the actual marginal fondue.

3003922,2016-01-25,1,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"I wanted to like F Pigalle - I really did.  But there's only so much decor and atmosphere can achieve.  Service and food quality are the most important part of the dining experience, and while service was uneven, the food was just plain ""meh.""

I'll start with what's good; location, design, mixed use spaces, cocktails, and general playfulness of presentation.
LOCATION: Just off the corner of LVB and Fremont, the location couldn't be better.  The restaurant is located in the heart of the DTLV revival, and the placement takes advantage of the energy in the neighborhood.
DESIGN: This is a dimly lit and sexy space.  It feels like a mid-century French brothel bathed in red light.  Black, upturned parasols are mixed with a graffiti wall painted by local artists.  There is the requisite white furred bear skin rug, and the service team are dressed in skimpy, revealing outfits.
MIXED USE: The front of the restaurant features a small lounge for waiting guests, dining room, and restrooms (not to mention some vintage porn).  Down a long hallway past the bathrooms and service areas you walk outside to a minimalist garden patio featuring a covered bar.
COCKTAILS: Damn good and well executed.  Prices are in-line with other options in the neighborhood, but they also seem larger than versions you find elsewhere in DTLV.  The coupe glass alone seemed to be double the volume normally seen, and this is a good thing.
PLAYFULNESS: The staff is casual and fun to be around.  The nature of your meal is such that you must interact with your food, your friends, and the staff, which makes the evening spent at Pigalle one of revelry.

But then the food arrives, or sort of arrives.  Fondue pots with hot oil are brought out from the kitchen.  The staff wrestles the burners to keep the oil warm, but they must be continually lit.  In a world where automatic fondue burners exist, why is anyone filling old burners with fuel and manually lighting them?  But the worst part is the quality of the food, and the presentation of dipping sauces.  The steak is not high quality or tender, and the problem with using tough meat and heat oil for cooking is that the meat comes out as tough as it went in and tasting like cooking oil.  The shrimp is a huge improvement, but the cost for a bowl of shrimp is ridiculous.  Then there are the dipping sauces, which are decent, but served in the smallest trays possible.  This makes them difficult to share, and difficult to keep in the tray.

And finally the service - slow and forgetful.  The ladies and gent who helped us were very sweet, but they were so busy swapping out fondue pots and relighting burners that they barely have time to do their job.  There is a good service experience somewhere in there, but the team has been handicapped by their table maintenance responsibilities. 

I would go back for drinks on the back patio when the weather turns warmer, but with so many other good food options just a short walk from Pigalle's front door, I will eat elsewhere.",NZ_MNakh_nK6zmxNmYg5Gw,2,1,3,DX0MY47R3Rtn9PepR-DyIw

The menu is up on the wall along with a small cocktail menu at the table. You can see price changes for certain items on the wall due to the different paint colors, ha. Our servers were very friendly and explained the menu pretty well.

We ordered the cheese fondue, chocolate fondue, edamame, and fries. The cheese fondue was served in a small dutch oven. The cheese was runny and didn't have much flavor at all. The foods brought out to dip were fried fingerling potatoes, green apple, french bread, and something else I can't remember.

The fries were pretty decent and came in a generous portion with two sauces. Forgettable but the amount given was appreciated. Edamame hummus with pita chips was spicy and had okay flavor. Chocolate fondue was my favorite, came with rice krispy pieces, strawberries, angel food cake.

The wine in baby bottles is a cute gimmick, but the wine tastes pretty cheap, which is understandable given it's 'bottomless'.

A friend of mine said he experienced something similar in Amsterdam. I can't speak to this since I've never been but this place does have a red light district look and feel. However, evidenced by the writings on the walls, the influence is French.

Me and my boyfriend, Roland, came here on 3/11/16 after a heavy dinner at a local French restaurant so unfortunately we only had room for dessert but we'll definitely be back to try the savory fondues. The menu is short and written on the wall and consists of just a handful of things: cheese fondue, steak fondue, shrimp fondue, fries, and chocolate fondue. It's true that you can order the entire menu for under $100 ($86 to be exact) which we will be doing the next time we stop in. This is great for groups, which we saw a lot of.

The chocolate fondue was a great little dessert to follow dinner! It was $9 which I think is a fair price for a fun dessert that we both could share. It came with rice krispie treats, pound cake (delicious), strawberries, and bananas. We thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a lot of chocolate left over so my only suggestion would be to have a bigger variety of pieces to dip or to have an option to purchase a refill of treats and fruit for a lesser price. Orrr I was thinking you could totally order fries to dip in that chocolate :)

We of course also had the bottomless wine in baby bottles. After reading reviews on here and seeing the menu on the wall, I was under the impression that the wine came free with your meal. However, our waitress charged us $12 each for the bottomless wine which I wasn't aware of until the bill came. Maybe it's because we only ordered dessert? I don't know what the minimum order requirement is for the free bottomless wine but we didn't complain. It was worth it; they let us sit there at our table and continue drinking long after we were done eating. I don't normally enjoy wine but I really did like the red wine we had!

The best part of this place is the staff. Our waitress was cute and sweet and like I mentioned, let us chill for as long as we liked. We had a friend join us as we were halfway through our second baby bottle of wine and the manager took his order for a glass of beer (which was on a separate cocktail menu). We spoke to the manager a bit about the restaurant and he was kind enough to comp the beer. Our friend ordered a second beer a little later from a waitress and when he went to close out his tab, the bar manager (a separate manager) said it was on him. We don't go looking for free stuff but I can't tell you how much this was appreciated! It's refreshing to go to a place that is so friendly and takes care of it's customers; it makes us want to go back. We are patrons of the area as Roland has a podcast studio in Emergency Arts. We eat downtown all the time and are very happy to welcome this awesome new restaurant. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed! I'll update my review once we go back to try the rest of the menu.

I feel some restaurants want to beat you over the head with whatever theme you get (looking at YOU Margaritaville). Wine out of glass baby bottles is also a clever nod to the theme. The atmosphere is really great. 

The food options are limited which should help new people. There are three main course fondues (Steak / Shrimp / Cheese), one dessert fondue (chocolate) and one appetizer (fries). All you can drink wine for one is included with the three main course fondues. Those fondues are a very reasonable price of $25.

The fries are everyone's favorite. They are especially great dipped in the cheese. The steak fondue was very good. You get big chunks of steak to dip in the oil. You also get a variety of sides (Chimichurri, A-1, garlic butter and horseradish) and various sides (potato, bread etc). Cheese comes with green apples, bread, roasted potatoes and salami. All of these sides went well with the fondue. Didn't get to try shrimp but if it was like the Steak or Cheese, it will be great as well.

Also, don't think you are getting skimped on the wine. The baby bottles are 250 ml. One fill is a 1/3 of a wine bottle. You will probably drink an entire bottle of wine before the night is done. Plan on sticking around / walking off that alcohol / or having a fondue DD. Seriously, the waitress was on it with refills, so you will drink more than you think.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,2,4,MuHfDFCgsKlBXlYQQ3fD7g

A modern speakeasy themed fondue/bar located right in the heart of downtown inbetween park on fremont & the retired insert coins. This establishment is sexy, dark, and entertaining.

Interior: There is no sign but a bouncer standing outside of a nameless space. Once he checks your IDs, you walk right into France in the 20s during prohibition. The inside is dark with a glass display to your right when you enter, filled with glass baby bottles and a glass dildo centerpiece. This is locked so don't you dare get any ideas! Fair amount of seating and a patio in the back that is really nice. Bathrooms are for individual use.

Service: Awesome! Our server was really attentive and brought out all of our things as soon as they came out with updates. 

Baby Bottles: The reason behind the bottles are because of prohibition at the time banning alcohol, people had to disguise wine in baby bottles is what was explained to our group. Not sure how normal it is in france for a grown adult to drink out of a baby bottle but okay!! Served chilled white wine or room temp red, both very good

AYCD: Per order of a fondue pot you're given 1 free all you can drink baby bottle with choice of red or white wine. I personally like the white wine a lot more. For the extra person, I think it was $12 extra. 

Food: The cheese fondue was served with bread, salami, vegetables. Personally the cheese was slightly bitter but the consistency was on point. There is a meat fondue pot where you dip raw meat into a bowl of hot oil to cook. This is really good but not very filling. 

Dessert: The dessert fondue is a must MUST!! for $9 you get a pot of warm chocolate with rice krispy pieces, short bread, strawberries, and bananas. Really nice.

Overall: A really good place to go on an intimate date or with a group of friends just to hang out. Don't come here expecting to get full because you won't.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,7,4,4,Aq1HiENFLbKwUi1lPDpp7g

The menu is very short, simple and to the point. The price point is very reasonable and the best part is that the fondue comes with unlimited wine. You can select red or white. They take you back to your childhood by delivering the wine in baby bottles. We ordered the cheese fondue which comes with four different options to deep in (apples, bread, salami and potatoes) the cheese was good but it lacked some flavor. We also ordered the shrimp fondue which came with about 7 large shrimp and another 4 sides. This dish was also good, but not memorable. The chocolate fondue was great. 58% Belgium chocolate with strawberries, bananas and crispy treats. Overall, the food was average, but I think the atmosphere, the unlimited wine and the price points makes this place a great location to visit.

Decor and ambiance is awesome, taking you to red light district in Paris with downtempo music in the background (might be a little loud for some though). Simple menu, basically choose between cheese shrimp or beef fondue and I'll go ahead and crown the fries best downtown. Wine comes in a baby bottle (representative of Parisians rebellion against the napoleonic tax on wine glasses) and is all you can drink. Bonus points for their catering to my girlfriend's gluten intolerance.

4733912,2016-05-24,0,gm8BAH6eZrDkJv0CCas0Bg,"After having my very first negative experience at F Pigalle's sister restaurant Echo and Rig (which is great) I was told to go check out F Pigalle and mention the managers name to ensure excellent service and maybe a dessert or something. The next time I was in town was last week with 10 friends, and upon my suggestion we all went to F Pigalle, huge mistake. I called to make reservations due to the size of our group and to my surprise reservations are made through Echo and Rig during off hours. I mentioned the manager by name, explained what happen the last time I was at their restaurant and that the whole reason I was making the reservation was per their recommendation and to please speak to the manager about my call. None of these things happened. I showed up and the one poor waitress was all by herself, knew nothing of my reservation, and there was no manager or supervisor on duty to speak to. Not a good sign. It was early and the place was completely empty. Another bad sign. To make matters worse the air conditioner was off and it was blazing hot outside. Three big flags were ignored and all 10 of my now sweating friends sit down. This is when we realize that there is no music and the place is creepy quiet. We tell the waitress, nothing happens. So, we literally start playing our own music out of an iphone. I think we are up to four flags when we placed our orders. On to the next: I wasn't expecting GREAT wine, I wasn't even expecting really good wine, but decent would have been nice. The red wine was super cold (which I did not complain about cause it was so damn hot) but it just bad. It tasted like fruit juice gone slightly wrong. Sweet and sour. I tried my friends white wine and it wasn't much better. The two in my group who ordered bottled beers played it best. Now we are being presented with all the burners of oil and cheese and the air conditioner has barely even kicked on and its getting warmer and warmer... but we're hungry, so whatever, lets eat and make the best of it! The food was eh. The cheese was so mild it barely held any flavor at all. The oil and shrimp was fairly tasty. The filet was under seasoned and tasted of nothing. The single serving of cheese was also boiling over hot the entire time and the double serving was barely warm. This was so many levels of failure. We had 10% of our bill removed as an apology for the heat. I will never return and have told all my local Vegas friends to not bother with this place. So disappointing. Oh, and no manager or supervisor showed up even after we had left.",LZLYJL51S_e2PEcKVhmRWg,2,0,1,kfTELwcUyQtvjJ94F732Gg

All you can drink wine out of baby bottles?  Let's goooo!!  Made famous by Refuge des Fondues in Paris, what was initially awkward and hilarious became spiritedly entertaining as the evening went on.  From what vineyard and year was this Bordeaux?  There is a time and place for that, but this ain't it.  Raise a toast and suck on a plastic nipple!  Psychologists would have a field day in here.

""F"" could be for fondue.  There's nothing really to screw up unless you're blabbing and forget that the meat was left in the pot too long like ummm.....me.  $25 gives you the choice of shrimp, steak or cheese with wine.  They also offer a wine only option for $12.  Great value.  

The owners have done a great job with what used to be Radio City Pizza.  Its overall Parisian Red Light vibe is like nothing else around Fremont and is totally worth checking out.  Staff was very nice and accommodating.  We ran out of the cheese fondue before finishing our dippers and they brought out another pot no problem.  If you're lucky, you'll see one of them pole dance.

The staff that seated  us was super friendly, we had  a reservation but were early and they let us sit down ahead of time. Once  our party all arrived, they give you the menu speal. Basically every $20 and over fondue comes with unlimited red or white wine served in a glass baby bottle. This concept I loved and was a great idea. If you didn't order enough fondue that was okay too, they will just charge you $12 but hey it is unlimited.  If you are a wine conosor keep in mind this is like cheap house wine, no choices in the matter, only red or white.

The interior was very cool and decorated in an old 20's style with a chandelier which was nice. The tables are very close together too,  so don't expect much privacy.

The food in general was  average, the cheese for dipping is similar to a Swiss cheese so If you don't like it then your kind of stuck. Also our lights for the pots were going out frequently which was super annoying and happened literally five times, making it very difficult to cook any meats. The quality of the meat wasn't so great either,  and came with Apple, bread pieces and salami for dipping. 

Overall,  besides the unlimited wine concept, I can honestly say the rest of the experience could be passed. I was not impressed with our lifeless server, average food,  high prices and just overall annoyance that was pigalle for us.

There are ghosts of Christmases and anniversaries past all around. Unopened Sharper Image boxes..karaoke machines..fondue sets...it sort of registers, but not really. 
 Until it's 2016, you are a full grown adult turned loose on Freemont street with two weeks of pay and not a care in the world. 
 Here we go. To you it's a whole new concept and boy oh boy, what is this witchcraft on a fork. People my age are like- is this Melting Pot? Mom?...
 What makes all of it work is unlimited wine. After a first Instagram/FB/Yelp post I don't think anyone cares if it's served in a faux baby bottle or in Baccarat crystal. Everyone is having a good time.
 Now seriously. The place is a tiny landing strip of a restaurant. Cute patio bar out back.
 It's fondue, so it goes like this. $25 gets you steak or shrimp. For beef- you get a platter with a handful of raw beef, pot of piping hot oil (ewe), pickled vegetables, and mayonnaise based sauces (yuck). And bread. 
 For shrimp- there is a cute ramekin full of oh, medium-ish shrimp, bubbling hot seasoned water reminiscent of shrimpin' dippin' broth and sauces that are pretty much soy sauce cut with wasabi or ginger. 
 Each comes with unlimited wine. Red or white?
 So it's like this. If there are two if you, get beef and shrimp, but for the love of God, turn away the bubbling pot of oil and mayonnaise sauces. Stick with hot water and soy sauce that comes alongside shrimp. Cook your beef in that, or eat it raw and save yourself death by canola oil and mayo. 
 Lastly. Drink your wine. Drink your partner's wine. Check out the bar on the patio. Have fun, you and the wine bottle.
 For someone in late 30's and up- it's fondue. Tried and passé. 
 Like Korean BBQ. Or Shabu Shabu. One Hot Pot. 
 For those vaguely aware of an unopened fondue set circa 1992 in their parents garage it's a hip, mysterious 5 star experience. Go for it.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,5,3,4,FKNY-MMr3QCWl9pJTkEiuQ
