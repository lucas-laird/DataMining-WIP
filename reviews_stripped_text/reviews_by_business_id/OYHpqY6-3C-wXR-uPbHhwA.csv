I ordered a cafe macchiato and the ""barista"" rolled their eyes and the server smirked. Apparently preparing coffees that they have advertised is an annoying task. 

I ordered an omelette and my husband ordered the breakfast sandwich. The cheese in my omelette was not melted and they forgot the eggs on my husbands sandwich.

133883,2016-12-06,0,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"My husband and I came here to eat for lunch today.

We ordered the following and ate dessert first.

Fruit tart $4.50 plus tax
The woman at the counter said they were fresh made. This was clearly false because I received it from the case and it was frozen. It is still cold over an hour later.

Chocolate dome $4.50 plus tax
It was okay. Nothing special just a typical $5 dessert item.

Truffle and Tomato Salad $7.95 plus tax
The salad had no truffle anything. No truffle oil or actual truffles. It also was missing Basil. I noticed this immediately and went to the counter. For the salad I was given a refund on the spot. But decided to leave after because I did not want to sit in the restaurant any longer.
Note that their online menu says nothing about truffle. The in store menu however has truffle listed as a main ingredient. 

Honey 1/2 Pound Black Angus Sirloin Burger for $9.95 plus tax
Despite all that happened we took this home in a box. We did not look at it until we got home.
The burger came without cheese, pickles, BBQ Sauce, Mustard or Smoked Bacon. All of these are listed on the menu in store and online as ingredients. We did not ask to have any of these removed so they should have all been included as listed Yet they were not included see photo for reference.. The bun had a puncture in it, we did notice the puncture but did not feel like making a fuss. See photo to see exactly how the burger was served to us.

I love to support small and local business. However I can not support a place that does not give me what they promise on their menu.",Kr8GVDf5UupHTozB0em_fg,0,0,1,qQ4c9e_FzNIRBXwp2szmtw

The portions were large, the counter person was lovely, however that's all we can say good about it. The 3 eggs were supposed to be over medium, but were totally dried out, hard yokes, and burned brown on the bottom. The bacon was mostly fat and barely cooked, with running grease. The potatoes were cubed with some onion, but flavorless, cool, and hard. No tomato juice and orange juice was only available in small pre-packaged bottles.

Same thing - got a bunch, took them home and found out that this time, ALL of them were stale. Didn't feel like going back because it was just easier to cut my losses (less than 10 bucks I think).

The pastries looked yummy but we were looking for lunch. We decided to stay. My husband and I started out with the home made soup French onion soup. It was yummy. It had a very dark broth but was not salty. Really tasty. On the way out, the chef gave us a sample of the potato leek soup he had just made. Even better. I loved the fact that you could feel the texture of the potatoes in the soup. My husband had a brisket sandwich---it was very tender and tasty. I had their special burger with jalapeno cheese and carmelized onion. I opted out of the bacon and bbq sauce (which was very good as I tried some from the brisket sandwich). Again, very good. They were out of fries so I was offered potato salad or home fries. All I can say is that I hope the next time I am there they are out of fries, again. The home fries were outstanding.

650041,2014-10-07,0,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"I live close by so I've been watching closely to see when this place opened to give it a try. I walked in and I have to admit I was impressed as I was not expecting things like gellato/ice cream, and cupcakes to tempt me on my way in... . I just got off work so I planned to grab a menu on my way home, but I actually decided to have an early dinner.

I ordered to go and got one of their burgers. I was a little skeptical of the price till I realized they were half pound burgers. When I got home I saw the container not only with the massive burger, but it was filled to the brim with fries. Given that other places skimp on sides it was a very pleasant surprise. They were decent fries, nothing to write home about, but a good enough fry to go with a burger. I also got a side of onion rings as well since the price was right, and they were huge! Definitely tasted good, but I almost couldn't fit the food in my mouth! (I have a small mouth...thanks genetics), however even with it not quite fitting well in my mouth, I definitely look forward to trying Honey Cakes again, I had a feeling that their burgers weren't their specialty (or they're still trying to find their groove), and I hope that maybe a quarter/third pound might hit their menu in the future, as honestly a half pound with all the food they offer is too much food even for a fatty like me.

This place doesn't have everything, but has a lot of forays into various areas and plan to bring some of family to try them. My girlfriend loves crepes, My mom likes red velvet pancakes, and my dad could probably be swayed to the jerk chicken. I tried to avoid the desserts as I really didn't want to break my diet so I can't really speak on those.

As far as rating's, they still have a little bit of growing pains. They're brand new (at the time of writing) and it is obvious (As it is with any restaurant) that they are, but it is not their fault in the slightest. The food has generous portions, friendly staff, and I feel that once some of the wrinkles are ironed out it will be a solid addition to my food rotation. That being said, there's no wait on the food being good (I am very happy full after just having eaten there) and a solid 3.5-4 stars :)

P.S. My burger was NOT raw even when I ordered it Medium.",gUJE1jwzhCuYIYjyXHdqoQ,1,0,4,ZAMRJIUu9YmkX4Dz6k6Mfg

This is NOT a destination breakfast place. There was no passion in the food.  It was edible but honestly, the McDonald's breakfast tastes better despite whatever artificial ingredients it may be in it. 

The omelette had no seasoning, the cheese was not melted and the eggs were dry. That may be OK for some people but I wouldn't come here expecting a good breakfast. It is adequate at best. 

The coffee was good but the second cup was cold.

First impression: above average rating.
 
Small and intimate coffee and desert style business. Employees were friendly but quite didn't know the flavors of dessert menu.  One lady said she didn't know and didn't bother to offer and seek out the info I wanted.  Another lady overheard me questioning and walked over and said she ""would go find out for me"". Kudos to her! As I was in the mood to try some of their macaroons!!

Cleanliness:  

Spotless floors, counters, and work areas.  POS register is modern and techy, which was impressive. Employees appearances were nice, neat, and consistent from one to another. The cooks in the back all had the white chef smock and looked presentable and clean.  

Seating: 

This cafe has indoor/outdoor seating.  Inside can accommodate roughly 15-20 people at tables along the inside wall in the left side. Outdoor umbrella patio tables are located just in front of the entrance which can seat about 30 people. 

Parking and location:

Plenty even 12 disabled parking spaces too!  
This business is located in the Costco shopping center in southeast corner of the shopping center. 

Pricing and menu:

Price seems to be a little on the high side for some of the menu items. A dozen mini macaron cost me $15. They have a full menu serving appetizers, breakfast, lunch & dinner items.  I think I will give their burgers a try next time. Fountain drinks, bottled drinks, coffee, and a gelato station will sum up the rest. They didn't seem to have any menus printed up as of yet, only TV style displays behind the counter. As I stated above, I came in because I wanted something sweet.  I ordered the macaroons and to my delight, I am impressed.  Rich with flavor, vibrant in color, and they have a robustness that will pop on the first bite. 

All in all, I am pleased and am looking forward to coming back for an actual meal. Having said that, I welcome you Honey Cakes to the neighborhood!  Much luck to all of you.",iSD-cPCUFNfXkCNgTKCz5w,9,5,4,wRSzU7sNNxB7b0k82NjWgw

You could feel that they wanted to be there. Sandra was the one that took my order at the counter. Besides a few mishaps I got the order I wanted. 

One man there really went the extra mile for me. Their pastry chef Anthony and his team do a beautiful job. When I arrived, Anthony came out with two raspberry tarts. He saw me watching them and offered one to me. Of course I couldn't refuse. The man was very polite and proud of his work, for a good reason. 

The pastries were crafted wonderfully. The lines were smooth and softly elegant. The colors were clear and nicely mixed. Each pastry seemed to reflect its creator. Each showing confidence. 

All wasn't good however. The eggs and potatoes I received were not cooked through. When I looked into the middle of the folds of eggs they were raw. Some of the potatoes were raw. The peppers didn't look nor taste cooked. With the pancakes, I'm sad to say that I was disappointed. It tasted like bisquik. I wouldn't serve it at home I don't like paying for it. For the price, which was decent, I expected better. Now for the coffee, it was unfortunately bitter and not in the good coffee way. Anthony said the coffee was a Brazilian Columbian mix but it didn't seem to have the quality I hoped for. 

The atmosphere was another saving grace besides the staff who were all around friendly. It had soft jazz and french music playing that with the decor transported me to a wonderful place. It had characteristics of a french cafe. The colors were a little bright in places but it wasn't overbearing. Tuning down the hue would make this better if they were going french. 

One other slightly unfortunate mishap was the table. It was remarkable small. It would be great for a small pastry and coffee but once you have breakfast plates, which were huge, it didn't fit. I was worried all the time that the plates would be knocked off. 

While I wouldn't go to Sweetcakes for the breakfast, I would definitely go for the pastries. They were beautiful to look at. An artist truly created them. With a little more smoothing on the fondant it would be perfect.",A1rbNBt-Fv79RhZOF5MwPA,0,0,4,EdsorIe_nPNgo84-Lcbx9w

They threw in an extra crepe and free fries to make up for the fruit issue. 
Great customer service so far. The fries were really good, the veggie wrap was awesome, the macarons were fine, the Butterscotch muffin was yummy, the strawberry tart  and fruit tartes were amazing!

The cafe is small, so it would be difficult with larger groups of more than 5 or so. It would be a tight fit, especially after our first visit on a Sunday around 11am. The inside was full of customers so we decided for a lighter meal instead of dining in. There are many tables outside but the wind was pretty bad. 

We ordered: blueberry muffin and raspberry muffin. I really wanted to try an espresso drink but didn't see any previous posts on whether they were good or a drink menu nor did I see anyone other customer with an espresso drink, so I skipped it this time. Both muffins were fluffy and moist with a nice crust on the muffin top. Not sure if I'll return to try the other items.",ijET3u6uJ7Ug7gY5TIDB8A,1,0,3,WyyhxumBITLwwxyNfthVcQ

I went in and picked up desserts for the family and some breakfast. The omelet comes with 4 items of your choice I asked for tomatoes, onion and 2 bacon...I was charged extra for the 2nd bacon because they called it ""extra"" although it comes with 4 ingredients of your choice but I didn't argue with her I just paid it. 

The chocolate muffin looked delicious but we couldn't eat it because it was hard as a rock. The entire muffin top was solid, gross. The key lime pie had brush bristles in it, or at least that's what it looked like and we went home with 3 drinks that weren't marked and we couldn't tell which was what from a latte, mocha latte and caramel machiatto. 

I ordered the pigs in a blanket and they forgot to give me syrup. This stuff was all ordered to go. I didn't notice all this until we sat down to eat at home. 

Also, they have a display of assorted macaroons when you walk in, which I was told were on sale since they were assorted and a dozen. Of course they weren't, I paid $1.50 each for 12 macaroons, $18. At regular price, I might as well picked the ones that I want since all the flavors in the assortment were disgusting. 

I'll never go back here. It's an adorable place and the staff is friendly but I cant deal with my food being stale or finding junk in it. I'm disgusted.",yPCWGUCn3dUz4ANca6Clvg,3,2,2,q3iT9GRnv0us7TdvQb6XZA

I have to say that every single time we've been here, the service and food have been fantastic! Every meal is made to order, so you might be waiting for your food. On average, we've waited around 20 minutes for our food, which isn't too bad considering everything has just been made and it's hot and fresh tasting when you get it. Their crepes are one of the most delicious ones I've had, and you can see them being made; their pastries are sinfully yummy as well. The ambiance is very nice, like you're in a little French bistro, It is small and quaint. There's so many pastries to chose from and each one looking more delicious and decadent than the next. I recommend Honey Cakes if you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere and good food. 
This isn't a fast food joint, so if you're a little pressed for time and looking for something to eat, I recommend Express, bc they have everything already made and kept warm. (and only a few steps away)

If you like carrot cake see if you can get some because it goes fast. It's some really good carrot cake. The burgers and other sandwiches have been just average or under and too pricey.

I didn't stay to try the food so I can't comment on that.  My Mom and I walked in after  a group of 4 who took a table so we grabbed one as well.  The lady behind the counter immediately greeted them and was very gracious, brought them menus, told them about food and completely ignored us.  My mother is elderly and has bad vision so she was having a hard time reading the menu board.  I finally approached a different worker and asked for menus.  She said that they only had 2 menus and that the other employee gave them to the other table.  We were then standing in front of our table and I was helping my Mom with the posted menu when the first employee finally acknowledged our existence by asking me to not leave my purse on the table.  Her words were ""we are a family here but someone could take your purse, I would appreciate if you didn't leave your purse on the table"".  The purse that I am literally standing in front of? Well then, thank you for the warm welcome!  Maybe she was legitimately trying to be helpful but after ignoring us for 15 minutes it came off very condescending and rude.  We finally got in line and a family ordering was having trouble because they were out of fountain soda and some other items.  We just decided to leave.  There were a lot of pre-made items in the glass counter and they didn't look very appetizing.  Things also seemed a bit over priced for the small sizes I saw.  I'm honestly not sure if I will be back, it was an uncomfortable visit.  Like I said, strange.

We had dinner there tonight with a couple of friends and we were pleasantly surprised with every dish that we ordered.  I started with the French Onion Soup and it was fantastic.  The serving was in a saucer type bowl which was a conversation piece in itself.  My next dish was the Chicken Curry and again it was outstanding as well.  There was plenty of Chicken and the curry was very tasteful, but not overpowering.  It was served with white rice, which was great for soaking up the curry gravy and french string beans which were cooked to perfection.  I ended the evening with a small cup of Rum Raisin Gelato which was the best that I have ever tasted.

I bought 5 Macaroons. Had one bite of each and I was good. I was told the green was pistachio but tasted like chalky dry coconut. The white with sprinkles tasted like pistachio but very very dry. The purple was the better one but still not my thing. Idk maybe Macaroons just aren't my thing? My Husband ate the strawberry red one and said it was great but refused the rest after one bite of the green. I just don't believe these raves about confections are so awful. They have to be cutting corners in the baking process. It shows. 

My chocolate cake.... The reason for a bad review. It was a hard dry brown brick. They must be storing their pastries incorrectly. Fridge maybe? Very very stale and just plain awful! (Insert grossed out emoji here) The frosting was so hard I stuck my fork in it and I could hold the whole cake up.

2202992,2015-03-08,2,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"My parents wanted to try this new little cafe out based on a recommendation of a friend.  Nice little patio seating,  and as soon as you walk in you are greeted by a beautiful display of pastries and gelato. It's quite cramped as you walk to the back to place your order. Constantly having to move out of the way of waiters walking back and forth with plates that were on their way out...and dirty ones on their way back in. After placing our order of pancakes,  omelets and a bananas fosters crepe we sat ourselves at a tiny table. While waiting, i had full view of the cooking process. Being a stickler for cleanliness,  i immediately noticed a few red flags. The same people taking orders,  bussing tables and cleaning took part  in the plating of some foods. I noticed one employee touch the register,  multiple use utensils,  her hair etc...then handle a few bananas she sliced with her bare hands without washing. She handed them off to the cook, and a plate of premade, cold crepes sat waiting. As a busser brought used, dirty plates back to the food prep area he placed them right next to the crepes. So are we cleaning and storing filthy dishes next to what should be a clean food prep area? So the cook brings the bowl of what should bananas fosters back to the same employee who by now simply placed her hands under a stream of running water for two seconds and called them clean. The cold crepes get a few seconds in the microwave.  She pours them into the crepes n folds them with her bare fingers. She looks at another employee and they stare at the crepes for a few seconds.  She pours out some liquid from the plate and brings them to me. I look at this hideous mess they call bananas fosters. In hind sight i should have taken photos of it to show how sad they looked. They sat in a watery pool of white liquid,  coming undone and looked as if they were just thrown on the plate. No garnishment what so ever to make it look as if someone made an effort with them. I thought, maybe it's a house recipe...so i took a bite. Disgusting!  From the look on the employees faces prior to bringing it out, they knew it wasn't right. But i guess they feel comfortable serving what they know is sub par food. So obviously i had to bring it back. The employees were nice about it, sure they expected it. Since the rest of my table was nearly done with their food i opted for the fresh strawberry crepe which was fast to make. This time it was plated nicely.  The crepe itself was cold, rubbery and bland. They are premade, who knows how far in advance because the are just stacked high with plastic wrap over top. When an order comes in, they just pop it in the microwave.  The rest of my table enjoyed the omelets. Pancakes smelled funny and were not spectacular.  The other pastries that were available looked pretty great,  but since i did not try them i can't rate. So the one star reflects the food practices and the sorry crepe. I can't get over it! It was disgusting!  I guess the nerve of them serving it when they knew it shouldn't have killed it for me.",LOJDJh7W5KLuxFlGv7_vSw,0,0,1,pp1nyzB8xXoVzBO2__JIqA

I was excited to try this place that I've reviewed on Yelp before. When we walk in we're greeted by Amy and she was a delight. She asked if this was our first visit and asked if she could give us a tour of this shoppe. Amy offered us a taste of any or all of the gelatos, she walked us through the other displays of wonderful baked goods. I ordered the seafood burger with onion rings, raspberry tea and my daughter order the pesto turkey sandwich w/ fries and a mango tea and a chocolate muffin. Amy brought us the muffin to which she warmed up without us having to ask. With a visit like this I know you would expect 5 stars but Amy left at this point and we were left with the waitress from service hell. Not only did this young woman ignore a waiting customer that left after not being acknowledged after several minutes and several passes from this waitress. Unfortunately I didn't get her name but she was the only other waitress in the place. She brought is our food and continued assisting the only another customer that was in the pIace. I asked for some dressing for the burger I'd ordered but  my daughter had finished her fries and I had eaten mist of my onion rings when about 7-10 mins later she brought me a container of mayo and proceeded to pick something out of the container and flick it away. She handed me the container looking me directly in the eyes and walked away as I saw some dried up food on the container. I began to scrap at the dried food as it began to flake off. At this point I told my daughter what had happened and we got up abd left after we could not locate Amy. I spent $30 for fries onion rings and tea because there was no way at all that I would ask this awful person to correct such a blatant disregard of sanitation and customer service.

Our food was good but nothing fancy.

I think they are known for their red velvet pancakes though (which I'll have to try next time). 

The servers and other staff are very friendly and attentive. Our drinks and coffee never went empty, and we never had to wait too long for anything.

I got one of their raspberry muffins to-go and sooooo glad I did! It was the best muffin I've ever had! Not too sweet, buttery but not messy, moist, flavorful... I really loved the top of the muffin (which is always the best part, right?). It was a little crispier cookie-like, dusted with powder sugar, and a little sweeter, butterier.

When I went in there was no one around except the chef in the back area. Once the waitress returned from her smoke break she took our order. Even though she washed her hands, wow the smell of smoke was very strong- I almost left at that point. 
Food was just ok. Nothing super great. 30$ for 2 sandwiches and sides was a bit steep for me.",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,6,1,2,mIKYI6WIr1L4NSqRbj66dA

They had a great breakfast selection, but a chocolate cupcake caught my eye!! So rich and amazing and... their chef was amazed that I asked what kind of buttercream he used! It's not the shortening crap you get from some places!! Oh no!!! They make true Italian buttercream, and oh the difference!!! The flavor and mouth feel were perfect, the cake was still moist even though I feel the cupcake was made the day before.  The flavor was on point and not overwhelming or too sweet, and it was decorated beautifully! I will definitely return to sample more of their goods!!! I recommend this place to everyone! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I reserve that for near perfection.

3162372,2016-02-15,1,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"This review is about my experience ordering a custom cake from the bakery. They boasted competitive prices and unique designs but unfortunately, my experience was awful. Anthony, the cake maker, is inexperienced. He asked me to email him the artwork for printing onto edible paper which I did, but he called me several times confused and just not savvy with email so therefore, communication was very frustrating. He couldn't see all the attachments, didn't understand how to get the photos I sent, etc. so weird! But that's not all - he and I sat together in person and he made several suggestions on the cake design. He convinced me to go with brown fondant and gold trim and to go with a full sheet instead of a half sheet so he could fit all the design elements on it nicely. I agreed. We even found a sample cake on Pinterest for him to follow. When I picked up the cake, it was out in the open in the drinks cooler uncovered and unwrapped meaning any one could touch it or sneeze on it. Why?! And the cake was white with turquoise trim. What happened to brown and gold? This was a military retirement cake that came out looking like a practice cake for baby shower instead because of the colors.  

There were huge creases in the fondant, the corners were folded over and he failed at his attempt to cover them up with frosting trim. Some parts of the cake had a glitter sheen, others didn't. He left half the cake blank with all the artwork in only 3 of 4 of the corners after convincing me to buy a larger cake for enough room to fit everything. The trim (turquoise! Ugh!) was slapped on there crooked and did not look professionally done at all. 

Now, I will say this - the cake itself was moist and the chocolate tasted good. The fondant was way too thick to eat though and the bad customer service, inexperienced baker, and poor workmanship still made the cake awful. I hated it and have never had this kind of experience after the many events I've hosted. Will not be back, will not be recommending his work, and will never get to give the cafe food a chance after this! 

Also, Anthony did not return my calls and conveniently had ""stepped out"" when I came to get the cake so he never did own up to how/why he deviated from the design and his poorly made cake. I appreciate the cashier who empathized with me when I expressed my disappointment. She, herself, said she was very embarrassed about the cake. She's not the only one who should be embarrassed!",ZgkszHdjImm07C-67qBzVg,8,1,1,0JfUP1IrKpfSLmTglXvE1Q

3517110,2015-04-14,38,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"After doing some shopping in the same parking lot as Honey Cakes Cafe, I decided to stop by and pick up some lunch to-go. I noticed some tasty looking desserts in the front glass case, so I decided to pick out some of those along with my lunch order. I was greeted by the owner Anthony, who says he brings 20 years of experience working on the Strip here to his baby, Honey Cakes Cafe. He said that he experienced a few kinks after first opening, but feels he has things smoothed out now. 

The Corner Salad ($9.95) - Lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, bacon, avocado and jerk grilled chicken with jerk honey home dressing. The salad also had a couple large croutons on the top of the salad that I broke up and sprinkled over the top. The lettuce was crisp and the veggies were very fresh. I also enjoyed the dressing. The bacon had great flavor. When it came to the chicken I was disappointed. It just tasted like grilled chicken with salt and pepper which isn't bad, but nothing special. I hoped with ""jerk"" being in the name and seeing the pictures of the chicken they had on the menu, that it would have had more flavor. The salad was still very good and the portion was big. 

Potato Leek Soup ($5.50) - I really liked this soup and could have just eaten the soup and a piece of bread as a meal since it was a good portion. The soup held up well during the car ride and was still nice and when I had it after tackling my salad. 

Veggie Quiche - My order was taking longer than I expected. One employee stopped at the table I was sitting at and let me know it was taking some time because they were making it fresh. A moment later, Anthony brought me over a veggie quiche that he said just came out of the oven and wanted me to try it. I explained that I needed room for my salad and soup, but he insisted. I really enjoyed the quiche and would eat one again. I also enjoyed the genuine passion and pride that Anthony clearly has in the type of food he puts out. The smile on his face when I took the first bite of the quiche said it all. 

Butterscotch Muffin ($3.99) After all the food I consumed, I had forgotten about the few goodies I picked out. The butterscotch muffin was heated up and packaged nicely. I was impressed with how warm and fresh the muffin still was just like the soup. I could only eat half, but it was worth every penny. 

Chocolate Mousse Cake ($4.50) - I shared this with hubby later for desert and we both really liked it. The chocolate flavor tasted excellent! I think some people who like chocolate, but don't love it will want to try something else because the chocolate really stands out in this one which I personally like, but others might find too rich. 

When I first walked inside, I noticed how it wasn't too spacious, but more narrow. They have tables inside where you can eat, but it can get tight on space if it's busy. I'd recommend dining out on the more spacious patio if you aren't getting your food to-go. The tables outside are a decent size and the tables that are in direct sunlight have large umbrellas over them providing good shade. Even though the chicken was simple the salad was so fresh and tasted great, the soup was comforting and going to become my best friend in Fall, the baked goods tasted excellent and my to-go order was packaged well and still hot. I'd recommend calling your order in if you want your food to-go as it will help cut down on your wait time if you are on a timed lunch break.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,48,48,4,GMlD1ngn1KdHNOmr8hrwOA

Just a normal burger and avocado.. Nothing special.. Especially when it was served to me with shit brown lettuce... They don't spice the meat at all it seems..

It is a small cafe, cramped together in a small space, but they do make up for it by having a decent sized patio with umbrellas and misters. You'll miss this place if you aren't really looking for it, as it is squeezed into a strip mall with many retail stores flanking it.

I ordered the ""Pigs in A Blanket"", which is basically sausage links wrapped up in red velvet pancakes. While I appreciate the effort to be ""hip"" with the red velvet, this dish would do just as well with regular 'ol pancakes as well. 

I was given a dish of butter and a dispenser full of (probably) imitation maple syrup. The pancakes were A-OK, nothing spectacular, and the links, I'm sure were of some once frozen variety.

One downside to this place is their lack of coffee options. It looks like a place that  would have numerous options for coffee-like items, but when I asked for decaf they gave me a weird look. I don't know, I kind of just assume a lot of places have a decaf option. Maybe I'm the one who is weird?

This place won't tickle your fancy if you're looking for a full out sit-down restaurant experience, but if you're more into a cafe vibe and don't want/need really, really great ingredients and exceptional service this will do.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,3,70wCmbNz9VgwJOcK4Gs8iw

I however ordered the avocado burger which is advertised w a pretzel bun, which it wasn't.

4621201,2015-02-27,0,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"Tried this new restaurant in our neighborhood.  My husband ordered the Beef Sliders and gave it 2 thumbs up!  It was delicious...hot, freshly made, roasted peppers, fresh ingredients; a winner!  I ordered the Chicken Alfredo Crepe.  I was a bit disappointed to see the crepe was pre-made and they warmed it on the crepe maker.  It takes less than a minute to make a crepe with premade batter. That struck me as odd.  ~  Aside from that, issue with the chicken distribution (chicken all in the center, and 3-4"" of empty crepe).  However, all was not lost.... the sauce was fresh, tasty, light and seasoned well.  Lastly, and the real bummer, was that the meal was luke warm; sat too long? Put on a cold plate? Maybe crepe wasn't heated through completely?  Perhaps because it was a chilly day, I was yearning for something piping hot.  Still, I'd file this under ""Minor Infraction; the food wasn't cold.  It was delicious in spite of the temperature. 

I LOVE that this café uses REAL plates and flatware! This might not be a big deal for some, but it is for me. When I pay $11 for a meal, I don't want to eat it with a plastic fork.  (Major Cool Points)   Staff was friendly, albeit a bit more chatty than deemed necessary, but they were young so we made concessions.    

Ordered a few pastries and they were nothing short of SUBLIME!  Husband got some heavenly apple creme filled pastry (he let me have one bite). I ordered a raspberry macaroon (Just as though you can measure a good chef by their ability to can make a perfect egg, you can judge a good pastry chef by their ability to make the perfect macaroon) Let's just say that if I rated this restaurant by the 2 bites of the macaroon, I would have given it 5 stars!  It was probably one of the best I've eaten. 

So I'm giving Honey Cakes a 3 Star rating (A-OK), but I think they have a good foundation to build a great customer base. We will definitely go back to try other foods on the menu. Hate to rate a person, place or thing on just one experience.

I walked up again to find her starting a salad. It was a bowl of romaine lettuce with a few small pieces of tomato and cheese that clearly was not mozzarella.

Being new to North Las Vegas, my family and I were in the midst of unpacking the mountains of boxes in the house and we were all hungry for breakfast. Seeing as the kitchen was still cluttered with unopened boxes and having not come across all the tools needed to make a delicious breakfast myself, we looked at our options. 
Honey Cakes came up and with the massive amounts of good reviews, we said ""Let's do this"". We reviewed the menu and I called in the order. This is what we decided on:
Egg breakfast with potatoes and brisket.
Build your own omelette with Brisket, Cheese and Mushroom.
Red Velvet Pigs in a Blanket.
Red Velvet Pancakes.
Regular Pancakes.
I drove down (conveniently located about 4 miles from me), and my order was ready.
I'll be honest, as I was driving home, the smells were amazing coming from the two bags on the seat next to me. I unpacked those boxes and handed the kids theirs first. As I opened my container and Kisha's, I noticed something missing...the toast from both of our orders. One order of wheat, one order of white. I looked in the bags again to see if I had missed it....nope!! Not a good way to start off Honey Cakes. It wasn't very busy and I would expect that even if it was that the order was checked and double checked. But, I understand...things happen. I called and made sure they knew that I had been short changed so I could get my toast next time. 
Unfortunately, this isn't where the disappointment ends. As Kisha and I dove into our food, we both kinda looked at each other, perplexed. Kisha's brisket came served in a BBQ sauce, mine was without since it was in an omelette. It made no difference. The brisket was dry. I mean stuck in the middle of the Sahara with no water and only sand to drink dry. Not only was my brisket dry, but the entire omelette was dry. It was way over cooked. The accompanying potatoes had suffered the same fate. The majority of them were dried out. I like my potatoes to be a little crispy on the outside, and soft and tasty on the inside. Kisha had the same concerns. Over cooked scrambled eggs, dry brisket, and over cooked potatoes. We shared the original pancakes and those weren't that great either.  
The kids did enjoy their food, so at least they walked away happy.
I'm on the fence now, as to whether I'll give them another chance. 
If I do, I'll be sure to dine in.",hnhTHPE9_6OQrEZocNw4gQ,5,3,2,F9XK2Fp1RRnqinz7V3QD-g

It doesn't look like much from outside, but once you step inside it feels like you've been whisked away from Las Vegas. The café is colorful and aesthetically well put together.  There's an inviting gelato bar, croissants lined up on top, and an attractive chocolate and pastry lay out.  Like I said, swoon.

I ordered the veggie wrap ($6) and the mac 'n cheese ($6.95). After requesting the onions and avocado be withheld, I was presented with a wrap containing only lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Needless to say, this wasn't much of a wrap. There was a bunch of ingredients below the veggie wrap menu description I assumed were going to be thrown in. Now I know for next time I specifically need to ask for these extra ingredients. The mac 'n cheese wasn't my cup of tea (it's baked with onions that leave a distinct taste), but I have to admit it was still tasty.

My husband ordered the brisket BBQ plate ($12.95) and a side of onion rings  ($2.50). The plate came with green beans and white rice. I sampled the rice and the green beans, which were awesome. The rice was nice and sticky and the green beans tasted super fresh. My husband pretty much licked the plate clean. He even ate the fat off the brisket! Which he never EVER does. On top of that, he was praising the rice. That man doesn't even like rice. My husband asked our waitress to pass on compliments to the chef, who responded with a wide grin and said ""That's how we do, man!"". 

To finish off, we had some gelato. I tried the chocolate and my partner, the pistachio. We got the smallest size ($3), but it was plenty filling. 

We'll definitely be back. I'm looking forward to trying out their breakfast menu next time.

TIP: You order and pay at the counter, and there's a section for a tip. It kind of threw us off at first because we didn't know if we would have a waitress or if it would be more self-service. The waitress, if that's the proper title, brought the food to our table and checked if we needed refills. However, she never cleared any of our plates.

Update: Honey Cakes offers a 10% military discount!
P.S. There's a restaurant.com certificate available for Honey Cakes! It's kind of pricey here so it definitely helps to have one handy.

Tucked away in a shopping center in Centennial, with early morning hours seven days a week, it was on a whim that I decided to travel up to Honey Cakes Café and although the twenty-two minute drive to an area I really had no other reason to visit proved a hassle due to an early morning traffic incident slowing cars to a crawl my 7:20am arrival found the small café ready and waiting - no customers quite yet, but the shelves and cooling racks stocked with no less than two dozen varieties of fresh pastries while the small kitchen gleaming as a cook stood mixing batters for a variety of made-to-order plates.

Owned and operated by a gentleman named Anthony, a classically trained baker who has manned and managed the kitchens of some of Sin City's finest resorts, it was with the Chef himself present and happy to chat that several pastries were discussed and focusing mostly on personal favorites as well as those hot from the oven seven options were selected, a complimentary apple croissant plus two plates from the kitchen and a ball of housemade gelato comprising an order totaling just shy of $40.

Beginning first with a muffin, taken back to the kitchen in order to be rewarmed in the oven, suffice it to say that anyone who fancies butterscotch would be well served to drive up to Honey Cakes ASAP as the Scotch infused batter dotted with golden chips is undeniably delicious without being overly sweet and following this up with a fresh laminated pastry packed with housemade apple-cinnamon compote a theme was established, the flavor of apples in abundance with a relative lack of sugar allowing the buttery layers of pastry to shine.

At this point receiving two made-to-order plates, one with a ball of sumptuous 'birthday cake' gelato, it was a bit of a surprise that the pancakes were served far thinner than many Las Vegas breakfast institutions but with rich cocoa notes and a delicate crumb freely lacquered by a pitcher of 100% Maple Syrup the flavors were robust and on par with those several times more costly on the Strip, the French Toast faring slightly less well largely due to the high egg content of housemade brioche and the fact that it was not soaked long enough to allow custard to penetrate all the way through.

Moving back to pastry, the last item consumed within the café arriving halfway through my pancakes and French Toast, one must consider the phrase ""the early bird gets the worm"" quite appropriate when considering Chef Anthony's $4.50 Pecan Roll because, while I cannot guarantee it is nearly as good midday, the piping hot version just out of the oven was not only stunning in the quantity of pecans and caramelized sugar packed into each bite, but also by the crunchy shell with stretchy-soft dough within - a reference standard iteration of a classic that I'd rank best in the city by some distance, and on par with the best I've tasted anywhere else as well.

Taking the last five items to go, the bulk consumed with coffee as part of a midday snack, it was only a slightly gummy salted caramel macaron that held the rest of my order back from perfection and with the almond version of the Parisian favorite light and crisp one almost wonders if the former was a one-off mistake - something I'll no doubt have to determine at a later time when I make the drive back up to Centennial since the creamy housemade hazelnut spread filling another croissant is the sort of thing I'll crave while the chewy oatmeal cookie and carrot-packed bundt were equally desirable, the later also available in a cake form still calling my name.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,6,4,ewajtHVmG-3SfAf-59Nc5A

Chicken Line Sandwich:
Chicken breast with red peppers, onions, lettuce and tomato, pickles and fries on the side. 4/5

Avocado Burger:
Beef patty, lettuce, tomato, avocado, Brie, pickles and fries on the side. 4/5

Buttermilk Pancakes:
Amazingly light and fluffy pancakes - I don't even like pancakes that much! 5/5

Truffles, Eggs and Chives:
Eggs cooked however you want. I got sausage and they were delicious - the casing would snap and it wasn't uber salty. I wasn't a big fan of the potatoes though - they could be more crisp and golden brown. 4/5

Chocolate Mousse:
This is one of my favorite desserts. Their version has a hint of dark chocolate/coffee that brings out the chocolatey goodness of the mousse. 5/5

Chocolate Raspberry Tart:
You've seen this dessert many times before at many hotels/restaurants. Tart raspberries with sweet chocolate. 4/5

Gelato:
I tried the pistachio and also the Nutella coffee crunch...yyyyyuuuuuummmm!  Too bad they don't sell gelato by the pint. 5/5

They do custom cakes and they're not that pricey. I really hope this establishment does well as we need more businesses like this in this part of town. The chef works with other local chefs and business owners as well (such as Jinju Chocolates).",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,7,4,MZjGRirgo5AIQAleTwRUtQ

5492405,2015-02-08,2,OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA,"Macarons are hard to find, especially good ones. Well now Aliante has a place that will definitely satisfy your craving, my favorite flavors were the black currant and cappuccino ones.  They have a variety of flavors but you have to come early, since they run out of a lot of flavors by dinner time.  These are better than the Manon ones in Summerlin. They also have a big assortment of pastries and desserts. 

We went for dinner and tried the jerk wings with curry ranch, honey burgers with onion rings, mango and dark chocolate gelato.  The jerk wings were probably my favorite part of the meal.  This isn't really a pretty dish, but the curry ranch pairs extremely well with the jerk chicken wings.  There are 10 wings in an order for $7.95.  For those worried about spice, these are not spicy at all.  The burgers were just okay for me, cooked well, but didn't really stand out.  I think the burger could use a little more seasoning, a different bun, and something other than iceberg lettuce.  Also for sides, the onion rings aren't as crispy as I would like, next time I'll opt for one of their other side choices.  To finish our meal, we ended with a large gelato (dark chocolate and mango).  I preferred the mango, which was a great balance of sweet and tart.  My husband liked the rich chocolate flavored gelato.  Next time I might skip the meal and just eat an order of wings, some macarons and gelato...and call it a nice healthy meal :p. 

The service was excellent, our water was refilled several times and they came by to check on us periodically.  Seemed fairly busy...which is always a good sign.

Went back yesterday 7-26-15 around 2PM to see if they could redeem themselves.  Hint: they did not.  I wish I had never went there.  It pains me to do this because they were so darn nice.  

Have you ever been to a national park and went to the gift shop/restaurant there and thought ""well, this sucks but it's the only thing here."" ?  Well that's how i felt here. Our server, Amy, was incredibly nice and knowledgeable but she couldn't save this place.  

It took 15 minutes or so for three people to get ""gelato"".  We were served what I suspect was ice cream.  They ran out of whatever containers they usually serve it in and we got to-go coffee cups.  All three of us had to make a separate trip to the front counter to ask for a spoon.  I got six macarons and two scoops of ice cream for $12.38.  

Have you ever been at your Nana's house and she offers you ice cream she bought six months ago?  Ya know the kind that has ice chunks and a layer of congealed goo in it?  That's what this was like.  There was a gummy film over all the gelato and instead of scraping it off Amy served it to us like that.  It was awful.  

Macarons tried: 
Coconut
Black Currant
Almond
Pistachio
Strawberry
Lemon 

The display case was kinda empty and dissapointing.  I will never be back here and I do not expect this restaurant to last the rest of the year.  Two strikes and you're out, Honey Cakes.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,7,0,2,y9cKEtzim0zq655GInpy-A

The problem is the restaurant was slow, and not many tables were occupied. Asking for silverware, and straws and condiments... Let's just say I felt like a nag and stopped asking for things we needed.

So, when I saw this new cafe coming on my side of town, I was thrilled!  I was very hopeful it would live up to its great name!  It turns out it was a 3-star experience.

We stopped in on a Saturday morning early. The location is conveniently located in a strip mall right off 215.  It has several outside tables, which is perfect for dining outside when the weather is nice.

The inside of the cafe is quaintly decorated with warm inviting colors.  Their set-up is a little awkward because their display cases are so large it doesn't leave much room for ordering, using the condiment station or making your way back to the restrooms.  I can't imagine how hard it will be to move around once it starts getting crowded.

Here are the pros:  friendly wait staff, ease in ordering, interesting menu, good coffee and comfy seating.

Here are the cons:  long wait to get your food, inconvenience of getting your coffee condiments if you seat outside, and average food.

I thought their prices were a little high for the quality/quantity you receive.  Their brisket wasn't very flavorful and had large pieces of grissel.  The veggie quiche was flavorful though...but pricey at $7.95 with no sides.

Their desserts looked good, so we might be back to give those a try.  They offered an assortment of gelato, macaroons and cakes.",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,3,0,3,4djqF42SnaaHnSk6NFRfGQ
