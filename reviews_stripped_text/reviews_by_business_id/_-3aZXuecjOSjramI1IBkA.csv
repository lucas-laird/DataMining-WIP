The food was ordered and asked for the burgers for well done . The 3 cheese burgers were ALL very pink inside . The grilled chicken was pink inside as well ! When asked to remake the chicken - it felt and tasted like a microwave chicken ( rubber) 
Disappointed - more like a motel meets cafe food .",Zv0nWmd0LuPsyIX7iG7PcQ,1,0,1,uUakMNIZPT_Z80XOrldsbA

Breakfast is free to hotel guests. They offer both a ""made-to-order"" omelet station, as well as a breakfast buffet: scrambled eggs, link sausage, bacon, pancakes, breakfast potatoes, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, english muffins, yogurt, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, and more.

First morning: I opted for an omelet - with spinach, mushrooms jalapenos, onions, scallions, bacon, and sausage. I also tried a side of the breakfast potatoes and some bacon and sausage on the side. Plus coffee. Omelet was tasty and excellent, the breakfast potatoes were nice, crisp, and hot, bacon was meaty and delish, as was the sausage. Coffee was strong.

Second morning: a very small helping of scrambled eggs (with salsa), bacon, one link of sausage, and breakfast potatoes, plus water.

Good breakfast value!

You can also order lunch or dinner here and room service and have it sent up to your room.",XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A,5,2,5,g7TXm9YpvKrlxloM54w6tA

The chefs serve you a portion of bacon, eggs, sausage, and french toast, as well as custom omelets. Behind their hot buffet they also have bread, toasters, fruit, yogurt, cereal, and assorted spreads. In the corner and opposite side they have the beverages, which consist of apple and orange juice, and coffee and tea. The food was excellent but if you go for the breakfast, come early as the line gets long and the food goes fast.",8ZzBvOMMGDz1qxTa2b-ExQ,2,0,5,3-a2qynKzNp_wh2xPneo7g
