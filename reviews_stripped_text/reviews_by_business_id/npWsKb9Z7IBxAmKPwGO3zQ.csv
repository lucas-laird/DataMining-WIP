I have never had such a terrible service from a restaurant nor am I the type to complain about anything but this place just takes horrible service to a different new level. First, we call in to order two XL pizzas. The girl answering the phone says, oh we don't make them XL. Then I speak with Alex, and he says, oh don't mind her, she's new and doesn't know what she's talking about. Then after we placed our order in, they made a mistake and wanted to deliver our pizza TWO HOURS after our requested time. How can we keep a group of 12 people hungry for two hours????? The people running this place definitely would benefit from attending businesses courses because I am not sure if they are going to survive long term. I am so sorry to be doing this to you, but your service is BEYOND TERRIBLE. I would absolutely stay away from them and save all the headache!",Rtb5Z8J4cQWt-FmjmAtsvg,4,1,1,kjqYXHDi1AOkzdYS57Ogpw

604983,2013-11-21,6,npWsKb9Z7IBxAmKPwGO3zQ,"Well, strongly disappointed. We asked if we could split a pizza with half Greek and half mushrooms, they said they couldn't. I don't know of any pizza place that can't split a pie! So we just need up ordering the Greek pizza which came with feta cheese, Greek olives, gyro meat, olive oil and mozzarella on it. We also order a piece of chocolate cake. 

Then they almost hung up with out us giving all the delivery information. 

I will say it did arrive quickly, if not for that I would have wanted to give it no stars. 

Once the food arrived the pizza was not how I imagined it to look... It was more like a white pizza with some olives and a lot of olive oil. The gyro meat was microscopic and rivers of oil flowed through the valleys of pizza. 

The chocolate cake some how transformed into a chocolate pudding pie on the way to my house. Don't know how that happened. 

Needless to say at the end of this experience we ripped up the delivery menu.",4wpZiDawbO6n4ZSFrRt-Rw,4,2,1,pFUSUD_EjbdVIRECiuJhOQ

One day, my room mates and I were pretty desperate for food so we just ordered a supreme pizza. You can't mess that up, can you? Guess again. The crust was burnt, there was barely any cheese, and the the vegetables were mushy, gross and outnumbered the meat on the pizza by far. Not to mention that our pickup took 10-15 minutes longer than anticipated and stated by the woman on the phone. 
Don't ever order from this place, ever. I'm so glad we didn't get it delivered so we wouldn't have to waste another dollar on this place by tipping the delivery boy. If you need an edible pizza around the university area, you're better off getting some crap from the freezer aisle or getting a pizza bagel from Einstein's.

Ooh, also, any good review around here is probably from the owners and employees. I'm definitely not the only one out of my peers that has had terrible issues with this place.",HLEFPpFBX-eosHdUWHp7sA,3,2,1,vY7R2s81QNUeUIbvz_EWQg

I've NEVER had a pizza that looked as good as their Vegetarian Pizza and taste so bad as a result of flavorless red sauce.  I've had many, many, pizza's over the years (I'm not a youngin'), but their pizza was THE worst I've ever had!  Honestly!  I ordered a 12"" pizza, ate two slices, and threw out the rest.  Their delivery was not slow, the pizza delivery person was pleasant, and the caesar salad I ordered was tasty.  Hope they can do something about their red sauce!",5SEZO6WpjsZwL31nKoNVXA,3,1,1,8ufupn8mVohfU7eaAIREiA
1708669,2013-10-24,0,npWsKb9Z7IBxAmKPwGO3zQ,"I decided to try this place because they kept stuffing advertising flyers under my door.  I called in to place the order for pick up.  The woman who answered the phone asked me to hold, and then I could hear her arguing with a customer on another line about an order that had not been delivered for quite some time.  I began to have misgivings, but for $7, decided to hang in there.

She came back on the line, and I placed my order.  She told me it would be ready in 10 minutes.  I gave them an extra 5 minutes, just to be safe, and then went over to pick it up.  

The neighborhood where this Palermos Pizza is located on Twain Ave is not very good.  Not dangerous, mind you, but you just get an unpleasant vibe from it.  There were a group of 4 teenage boys standing in the parking space in front of the restaurant, for instance, idly passing the evening.  

I went into Palermo's Pizza place (basic low-end pizza joint interior; it has about 4 or 5 tables for patrons to eat at, should anyone ever choose to do so), and the woman behind the counter was pleasant and cheerful.  They had just finished my pizza and were cutting it up.  I paid and went home.  The pizza was decent - certainly worth the price I paid.  I would go again.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,4,1,4,lGBtnEQvlpuuTkb04Ssw-Q
2158937,2012-08-29,0,npWsKb9Z7IBxAmKPwGO3zQ,"Delivery was a bit on the slow side given proximity, but I'll give them a pass on that one.

I had the White Pizza, a nice classic style. It was decent in that way where you know it's not really any better than the big chain pizza places but it's not really worse either and it just feels better to support local business. No regrets, but it wasn't one of those secret pockets of unrecognized brilliance. Just an alright pizza at a reasonable enough price. Not a bad choice if you need to be up early and don't want the temptation of a long night that starts with a more glamorous dinner. Still, I know what local pizza places can do and this place doesn't quite meet that bar from what I saw. Could be better, could be worse.",m2a1WvdBx9tCohxvhPaTyQ,4,1,3,N1ydfLfHsb18F9nIu7D9WQ
2167458,2014-01-12,8,npWsKb9Z7IBxAmKPwGO3zQ,"The only reason I gave this place one star is because there wasn't an option for zero stars! This place is awful!! I work front desk at a hotel and myself and some coworkers placed an order ,the food that came was cold and not as described on the menu! Not to mention, I also came down with food poisoning ( I had their fettuccine alfredo).  We told them we were removing all their menus from our front desk, and that they weren't allowed to leave menus on our property anymore. Several times we have caught them back on our property shoving menus underneath hotel room doors, it's cause our guests to complain.  This is clearly not a reputable business.",gya1zcjGi9ldcd-5SivTOw,1,1,1,OznZpa9c7jh7-HWlXp7CUg
2900244,2014-02-07,4,npWsKb9Z7IBxAmKPwGO3zQ,"I've eaten here only two times. First time was delivery, and it took an hour for a greek salad and some hot chicken wings. Second time, I decided to drive there. Bad neighborhood. Crackheads and hookers everywhere. I got BBQ chicken wings, and a Godfather sub. The cold sub was delicious, I'll give them that. But the wings were tiny, and they just plopped the ""BBQ sauce"" on top. The nastiest sauce ever. I never throw away chicken wings, but after 5 wings, I was disgusted.",ldfQl6sgjgKzLYBo_m962A,1,1,1,3ZIw5cvX0t1CRv4uzUcYRg

Instead they were defending the guy that took our order whom repeated our order 5 times and confirmed the time with us for 12;30 also. No professionalism at all. Would not recommend this place to anyone! hope in the future they have better management.",uv-nM5UOd_Dkk-1s_chRlg,7,2,1,upO2lU1k_b0QK1yg91jTJg

4208756,2013-08-04,11,npWsKb9Z7IBxAmKPwGO3zQ,"I really hate doing this but I have to...
Needed to coordinate a lunch for about 15 people and decided to give a mom and pop pizza joint a shot vs the usual dominos or pizza hut we always get because it's so convenient.

I called a few days in advance and spoke with Danny, the owner I guess, and gave him a tentative order. I also told him I'd call the night before to confirm my order because I wouldn't get a chance the next day and needed it delivered to our hotel at 12:30 sharp.
Unfortunately I was unable to call because I had a lot of stuff going on (I had told him I'm coming to Vegas from LA on business and will be very busy.) However, I called the following morning bright and early at 8am, not expecting for someone to pick up but luckily they did!

This guys name was Alex and I told him I'm calling because I didn't get a chance to call last night, but I spoke w/the owner a few days ago and he said u have 24 inch pizzas....I need 2 of them delivered to my hotel at 12:30 today, can u still please do this???
He said sure, no problem, just call at 11 am when we open and place the order.
I called at exactly 11am, a girl picks up to take my order and then tells me they don't make 24 inch pizzas.I explain to her several times that I had spoken with Danny and Alex and they said u do. 
""No, 15 is the largest we make""
I ask to speak with the owner, he's not there...so she hands the phone to Alex. I tell him what happened and he said that the girl who picked up is new...she doesn't know what she's saying. So why would u have her pick up the phone?!?!?!?
I place my order with alex and tell him about 3 times that we need it for 12:30 and give him my friends # to call once they're here so he can hop out and grab it.
It was an absolute disaster!
12:30, no pizza. I call at 12:35 and they say it's on it's way.
12:40, still nothing. I call again and ask them to call the driver to see how far away he is.
Then my friend (who was waiting in the lobby) comes back up and says he just got a call and said our order is for 2:30.
I flip out. I call back and they have no idea what's going on. 
I ask for Danny, he's not there. I ask for Alex and he comes on the phone and tells me I had ordered for 2:30 but he doesn't know who called me.
Mind you, I have 14 hungry people staring at me and there is no way for us to get anything else to eat in 30 minutes before we had to go back to our event.

As I'm arguing with Alex he keeps putting me on hold and I just hear yelling in the background.
At this point I ask my friend to dial the # that called him. Lo and behold it was Danny, I take the phone and Danny basically puts the whole blame on me and tells me that I had said I would call the night before and I didn't. And THENNN he tells me he called me the night before and left me a message. I checked my messages...I had no messages from him. He then told me he did and to check my messages again.
This is beyond ridiculous. What does me not getting a chance to call the night before have anything to do with Alex telling me at 8am AND 11am that they can have it there at 12:30?????
He told me I called a different # than the one I originally dialed from a few days ago I ONLY HAVE ONE NUMBER FOR PALERMOS! 
Danny was very rude to me, blamed their screw up on me, told me to leave Alex out of this...his exact words ""Alex is a great guy""
and then asked so do you want the pizza or not?!?
When I told him I wouldn't pay full price for all the inconvenience he told me he's not going to give me a discount. I told him that before I called the first time I saw that u guys had some bad reviews, but I always support local businesses so decided to give u guys a shot. PLEASE don't make me go on yelp and give u guys another bad review.
He didn't care.

So, in conclusion, I never tried the pizza, horrible customer service, horrible employees who don't even know what's on the menu.
They screw up an order, don't apologize for it, blame it all on me..are totally rude about it AND refuse to give me a discount.

Unbelievable. Please stay away from this place because you'll go out of your mind dealing with people who clearly don't know how to run a business.",eJP9wNvUHm_LWsZAYLQyTQ,8,4,1,Y1QUgnohjhAZhZ2sa02cew
