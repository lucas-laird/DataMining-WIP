We tried a variety of items including their XLB (juicy pork dumplings), shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, bbq pork and spicy wontons.  Everything was ok but not great, definitely not worth the price tag.  There was barely 10 tiny, thin slivers of pork for the $10.88 price tag.

310761,2015-01-13,1,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"Really surprised with the positive reviews.  This place is definitely not good Chinese food - you'd be better off at Panda Express across the parking lot.

Restaurant is small - has three doors and outside seating - big glass wall to outside. There is a ""bar"" to sit and eat as well with stools where you can watch them cook.  All wait staff and host are Chinese - cooks were Mexican...???......

We ordered Hong Kong Wonton Soup - $10.88- had no taste - basically like water.  Well, I take that back - it had cilantro in it - so it tasted like cilantro water.

Rest of dinner (for 3) was Shredded Chicken Breast with Ginger (mostly all rice and greens - very little chicken - no ginger taste) $8.88, Minced Pork over Rice (totally ginger - in fact, it was like I was sucking on ginger root) $8.88, and Sliced Beef with Sukiyaki Sauce (tasted like pot roast)$9.99.  Portions were small.  Everything came in a bowl - just about everything had cilantro on it.  We left hungry - everyone.

Hot tea was $3.88.... I still can't get over a Chinese restaurant charging for hot tea.
No fortune cookies either.

Staff was nice - but waiter kept rushing us through the meal - the place was not full, certainly enough seating.  

We were laughing:  staff went to Wetzel's Pretzels for THEIR dinner and ate it in restaurant next to diners.  Tacky.  And says a lot about their own food!

Both our main dishes (house special noodles and sesame noodles) were bland and it was only after adding tons of soy sauce and Sriracha that we could get any actual flavor out of the dish.

They did not refill our drinks once and never came to check on us. After a terrible dining experience, we left an appropriate tip. And instead of the typical check grab after we've left the table, he grabs it and walks away, saying nothing.

505854,2015-05-19,0,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"Found this place while on a visit to the Apple Store to replace my deceased iPhone (boo!).  The restaurant has a contemporary and modern theme.  It was brightly lit and comfortable.  I really enjoyed the chicken fried rice, which had shredded chicken instead of chunks of chicken.  The Dan Dan Noodles came hot or cold, my choice was hot.  I asked it to be extra spicy and they hit the target right on.  Mmmm....delicious.  While I don't generally feel comfortable choosing from Dim Sum carts (I usually let my friends do the picking, and I do the eating), I was the one who chose from the cart.  Not a bad choice, which leads me to believe that I am either very lucky (doubtful, given my track record at the casino) or everything on the cart is good.  I kind of find it funny that they put the ""First"" Dim Sum carts at The Shops at Summerlin on their menu.  Uh...it's the only Dim Sum cart at the mall.  Not that it changes things, but they are also the tastiest Dim Sum carts at Summerlin.

The portions are decent, the food is good, the service is friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  What more do you need?  I can tell you...a wheel barrow to take me out when I am in a food coma.",jcbHQm4igKvudLWadr-Pzw,0,0,5,Ta52hAQ7gKNFi8Zyir2sHA

We asked the server if they could close the door, he said "" no we need it open for ventilation"". The food arrived just warm, the meat in the shumai was tough, and our food quickly got cold, again due to the open door.

We place our drink order and we're soon greeted with the dim sum cart. I was hesitant at how fresh it was but settled on pork buns and shrimp. The shrimp was nothing special and while the pork had good flavor, I am pretty sure they weren't made from scratch. 

I wanted bbq pork and noodles so I ordered minced pork sauce noodles and asked bbq pork on top. I was having a very difficult time communicating with the staff. He said there was already bbq pork on it. So I said okay. My dish came out and it did not have bbq pork. It was super greasy and I did not like it. Someone came by and asked if everything was okay.

710151,2015-01-13,0,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"Food:  went to try this place since we're in downtown summerlin anyways. This review is only for....

Taiwanese  beef noodle  soup: I've tasted better if I were to rate just this soup it'll give it a 2/5 stars. The beef was thinly slice and it was hard, chewy, and lots of tendon. It should be chunks of beef that softly falls apart in your mouth when you bite on it. The broth I'm not a big fan either. I've tasted authentic taiwanese beef noodle broth before and this  doesn't come close. The only thing I like is how they cooked their egg noodle. AL dente 

Roast duck soup: though  I'm not a very big fan of roast duck  I actually liked this better. The broth was very flavorful  and  the noodle is cooked to perfection. I didn't really eat the duck so can't say anything to that. 

Service: this restaurant  have a very poor rating with  their service but we didn't really have a problem. They refilled our water without us asking. They checked on us and our food pretty frequently. 

Drinks: a pot of hot jasmine tea cost  $4.99 w/o tax which I think is way overpriced. Our fault since we didn't really looked at their price prior to ordering. 

Overall: would I go back?  Probably  not. Would  I recommend it to other people? not to my asian friends  that know the difference between authentic Asian cusine versus Americanized.",Xl9PFRwjSeCVZXFb9tyb4A,3,0,3,EDSeBZDQEp1GXVlgcQNZ-w

This place on the other hand will give you the very best in terrible service, food and dining experiences. It will all start at the door, where the hostees may, or may not be waiting to seat you. When we showed up on a semi-busy Sunday the hostess was just seating another table. Ten-minutes later, I kid you not, she was still nowhere to be found. Another server ended up seating us where we waited another ten-minutes for them to locate a highchair. Irony of it all is that the highchairs were in the staff only room located, wait for it, right next to our table. 

The servers will be of no help in explaining the menu. For my family this was fine, we lived in Asia for over 4 years so we understood the menu. But the table next to us was asking all kinds of basic questions that the server could not answer. I felt for them when they asked if the dish they were interested in was made with seasame oil and the server couldn't answer. Knock, knock. Who's there? Nut allergy...

The open air kitchen allowed us to see what looked like the two-managers doing all of the cooking that day. Not sure, but it was clear that somebody watches too much Rachel Ray. Hello garlic! BTW, Ramen isn't made with garlic. Just sayin'...

For starters the restaurant organization is extremely poor.  There is a hostess station at the front of the restaurant...and, no one is at it...and why is there a hostess stand for 20 tables or less in a little restaurant?  Then you better hope your order doesn't get lost in purgatory...or sent to another table for that matter.  We miraculously got our dumplings after a long wait (which were not delightful by any means).  I would prefer the frozen dumplings from Costco for 1/8 the price.  While scanning the kitchen in hopes of our Dandan being made, we couldn't help but notice the amazing lack of organization.  You wouldn't even think that Henry Ford have invented an assembly line looking at this cluster.  The workspace was extremely small and the workers were playing bumper cars fighting over orders.  Only one dude seemed to have his crap together as he tried to take orders, cook food, and deliver orders while the actual waiters were frantically flipping through their notes trying to decipher which orders hadn't been completed for their tables. We learned from the manager that a majority of the employees are still in training; technique only: don't let the B-team keep sinking if the A-team can catch you back up.  All around us others were having issues with lost/wrong orders and long delays.  Finally, we struggled to get our check asking four separate people.  At least we weren't like the couple behind us who received two checks. When the manager brought our check out she decided to have a conversation with us about our experience.  We gladly provided our input that the place needed to work on their organization.  This was quickly answered with a resounding AMEN we were preaching with the choir.  She continued on stating she is planning a ""team meeting"" tonight.  I hope that went well, because this team isn't going to make it very far.

The service was absolutely horrible. We ordered vegetable spring rolls, but they never came. Our entrées arrived before our appetizer, which was extremely odd. Our green tea was ""supposed to be free"", but the restaurant charged us $4.00 for it. Our waiter never came by to check on us and ask us how we enjoyed our food.

First, we arrived and the place looked deserted, even the lights were not on inside. The store hours said they were open, so we tried the door after a short debate and low and behold they were indeed open. The staff was apparently just sitting in the dark... Not weird at all, right? 

We sat down and started to look at the menu, in the dark, and quiet restaurant. Finally they turned on a few lights and brought out the dim sum cart. I don't eat a lot of meat except fish so naturally I got some shrimp dumplings. They were pretty tasty so I asked for a second serving, that's where things went wrong I think. The second set of dim sum didn't seem fresh, the wrapping was somewhat dry and sticking to the little pot, but I'm not normally a fussy person and ate it anyways. I also ordered the lobster fried rice as an entree, which I had to put a lot of chili and soy sauce on since it didn't have a lot of flavor. Not sure which of the two things I ordered got me sick, but I wouldn't want to try again just to find out. Thank goodness a couple of other tables arrived or there would have been zero noise whatsoever.

1738975,2015-02-18,1,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"Usually when I'm looking to eat an ""out of this world experience"" of asian food, I normally would try my hardest to find a hole in the wall spot where the majority of faces were asian (proving the authenticity of the food) patrons.  

However, I think I just found the exception to everything I've believe life to hold.  And it goes by the name of RICE REPUBLIC. 

This review is based on my first virginal experience at this restaurant (RR) and location.  

Immediately, when walking through the door I was greeted by a chef (who came to be later known as, Chris).  I always look for the warm welcoming because if a restaurant cannot greet within the first 5 seconds of an entrance, then the restaurant has become lazy (complacent).  I approached the bar since I'm a solo food critic for the day and instead of taking a two/four topper, I wanted to be polite for anyone who came after me.  

It was during the mid to end of the lunch rush, but for a the newest/hottest mall in town, I was pleasantly surprised for TUESDAY it was relatively busy.  

I wasn't immediately greeted after that by any one particular server, so I didn't mind reaching out to see whoever could help me since I was sitting at the open faced kitchen.  I caught the attention of a person I thought to be the server, but ended up being the GM, LUV.  

I asked for recommendations on hot teas (since for some strange reason it was 68 Degrees in Vegas), and he was skilled in the art of Le Tea (I made that up ... or did I?).  Suggested Green at first, but then asked if I appreciated an experience for fruitier notes.  I acknowledged that I was open to trying something new and he brought me their house Jasmine Tea, which pleasantly was warm to the belly. 

I was surprised for such a small sized location they were able to fit a traditional CHINESE DIM SUM CART!  Yup! You heard it right ... a DIM SUM CART!  I was immediately on board to try that as an appetizer (BUT they had me at their menu ... which looked a little grunge, which made it more authentic ... no need for a pretty menu ... its lunch).  

I ended up order the SHU MAI and HAR GOW to start.  Two of my fanboy DIM SUM favorites since youth.  Then I order two more servings of two different DIM SUMs.  I wasn't a fan of one because of texture, but the other one replicated HAR GOW except for a slight variation.  YOU WIN SOME. YOU DIM SUM.  

The staff was very attentive.  That includes the other servers who didn't even have my section and the HOSTEST (with the MOSTEST)!  She asked me on two different occasions if I was doing alright and if everything tasted good. KUDOS to her!  Extending more than her greeter and table seater skills (Mad Props!).  

I was later suggested by LUV, the manager, to try a couple of other items on the menu (i.e Taiwanese Chicken and Rice Plate) which I'll have to come back and try.  I was completely full off of the DIM SUM. Since I was full he politely suggested dessert and when I was on the border line of a yes/hell yes, he told me to trust his choosing powers and let him decide for me (...trust issues what?!).  The results were a magnanimous one of a kind lightly breaded CHINESE MANGO CHEESECAKE, drizzled with decadent chocolate, and a divided, yet whole strawberry mochi.  I'm thinking this was OFF the MENU, but who cares ... I literally inhaled it.  

LONG WINDED: overall the experience was obviously to be boasted about!  From start to finish everyone was friendly, customer service oriented and attentive.

The food was mediocre. I had a spicy noodle soup.

When we asked ""how the Dim Sum service worked,"" our waiter replied ""oh that stops at 9 but I guess I could go get the dim sum menu for you."" (We decided not to get dim sum since this guy made us feel bad for even asking about it ""so close"" to closing time).

This might be weird, but personally I find that making your guests feel guilty about being there is not a GREAT service-tactic.

My sesame noodles were the right texture and flavor, and the steam juicy buns were the best I've had in Vegas. The sauces they used were just like what my grandmother would make!!!! 

Don't confuse this with an American Chinese restaurant. Everything I saw come out of the kitchen seemed less oily and more refined than the restaurants in Chinatown. 

The interior is much more comfortable and clean than your typical Chinatown restaurant. The manager was very nice and very accommodating. 
The hostess was not the brightest crayon in the box but I understand how hard it is to find good help in Vegas so I won't count it against them especially since this is a casual restaurant.

We also had their dim sum, which we did not expect since we're at Summerlin, taste just like the ones they have at Chinatown. 
Customer Service: beyond anything we asked for. 
Usually Asians at Chinatown kinda just throws the plate at you lol but here they're super nice and came to check up on us very often. All I can say is great customer service and amazing food.

Full disclosure: I am a huge fan of Din Tai Fung in LA, and that is the standard that I hold all other Dim Sum restaurants to. 
Juicy Pork Dumplings - the main reason I came. So disappointed. They were gummy, the soup inside did not taste right, and they were just altogether wrong. They were served with thinly sliced ginger (as they should be), so plus points for that. 
Shrimp and pork spicy wonton - these were good. Not as good as Din Tai Fung, but good. 
Pan seared pork and vegetable dumplings - these were okay. They had a nice sear on the bottom, and the filling had decent flavor. They were a bit bigger than I'm used to. The ginger dipping sauce was just ok. Altogether nothing special. 
Taiwanese beef noodle soup - I did not like this at all. It wasn't spicy as advertised, the noodles were soft almost mushy, and there were big hunks of fat floating in the soup.  The broth was a bit too salty as well. 
Service was good but not great. Although I was disappointed, it is a brand new restaurant, so I probably will come back to try other items on the menu.",qECKBghDpWlTWT711THlbA,3,2,3,UtzyvVXjUKi1qPmN5jRjkg

Because we had never had dim sum, we didn't know how it all worked. When we asked, he didn't help. We each ordered off the menu and then when the cart came around we just picked some stuff and figured it out on our own. A simple, ""Have you ever had dim sum?

The Lobster Noodle Soup came with great flavor and a great amount of lobster.

Finally after our bowls had been empty for 20 minutes the manager came out to greet us. He is a very nice man with great manners.

In this case, the lobster pasta set me back a cool $19 bucks. It was what you'd expect, a bowl of noodle soup with lobster thrown in. Good, but not the best thing I'd try that day. 

What I really liked was my noodle soup. Topped with BBQ pork and duck, this I feel is their specialty. While I also feel that the duck would be better served on a bed of rice or with vegetables, so that the skin could be left crispy, the soup was still good. The noodles in particular were so beautifully done, it made me wonder if they are homemade?

The single most enjoyable thing we had however was the scallion pancake. Crispy, buttery, not too 'oniony' and with a savory dipping sauce that took this simple appetizer over the edge to Flavor Town.",taHuVRFi8NPNHP6VQYZgfg,1,1,4,m-WoMdYyNctPTxEYaQE_Nw
3005481,2015-01-24,1,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"Wish I could give this place NO stars. Ate here about a month ago and it to put it succinctly, the dim sum was AWFUL and the service was a complete joke. AVOID this place. It shocks me to read so many reviews here saying how good the food is at Rice Republic. Those poor people either have really low standards or have never had good authentic Chinese food. There are so many better dim sum and noodle house choices in Vegas than Rice Republic. 

Strike One: The hostess randomly decides to seat us at the table closest to the entrance where it was very cold due to the entrance door always opening and a cold draft constantly coming in. This is despite the fact that there were plenty of open tables further inside the restaurant where it was much warmer. We immediately ask for another table further inside and she then seated us as we wished before handing us the menus. 

Strike Two: After looking at the menus, about 10 minutes have gone by without anyone greeting us or taking our drink order. Another 5 minutes pass with no acknowledgement whatsoever. We finally see a woman pushing around the dim sum cart and she approaches our table. We order 2 servings of Har Gow, but have still yet to be approached by an actual server to take our drink order. Naturally we were starving by that point so we decided to start eating with the hope that a server would come to our table to serve us drinks or take our menu order. No such luck. 

Strike Three: The Har Gow that we ate was terrible. It was cold, bland tasting, and just poor quality overall (even by Vegas standards). It's safe to say that this was the worst Har Gow I've had. Ever. And that's saying a lot. 

At this point we still had not been approached by a server. We kept glancing at the other servers attending the other tables to grab their attention but to no avail. After having enough of this, I finally yell out ""Can we just have the check please?!?"" That apparently got some attention because a server came running over immediately, rang us up, and gave us our check. As she handed us the check, she then had the NERVE to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. I looked up at her and asked if she was kidding. I asked her why would we order our FIRST drinks of the night AFTER the check has been closed and paid for. Before she could reply, we got up from the table and walked out. This place has to rank among the worst in terms of dining experiences that I've had. Bad food and a joke for customer service.

I ordered the Taiwanese style pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup. I was not impressed with the soup as it had a small handful of noodles,  4 to 5 small wonton's ( that look like they had been sitting around for a few days ) some sort of lettuce or cabbage cut up so small I couldn't tell what it was. Broth was kind of tasteless. The noodles were the best thing in it. My daughter ordered the Orange chicken with white rice. We asked if it would be enough for her to share with the kids. They said yes. When it came out it was on a tiny square plate with about 8 to 10 pieces and very few veggies. The rice order was so small I could fit it in my hand. She said the flavor was good but small size and not filling. The only thing that was fairly good and looked filling was the Ramen Noodles with chicken that my son-in-law ordered. Still the portion was small for the price. Total bill for three meals ( if that is what they were ) with only water was just at $42.00.

Food: Was ok, wasn't really amazing and wasn't terrible. Just typical in my opinion

Service: Also ok, drinks were kept full and the waiters were attentive.

The hubs and I ordered Shrimp fried rice, bbq pork, shumai, crispy scallion pancake, juicy pork dumplings, steamed pork bun and egg rolls. I know ....We like to eat. 

Everything food wise was Awesome! The crispy pancake was so yummy and the shumai.....so ono!

Portions are a little small for what they charge...I guess it is the experience you are paying for. 

Downside...service!
 When the dim sum cart came around we were so confused how to order and really was not explained. I pointed and she gave us our shumai.  We also ordered the egg rolls and steamed pork bun. She said it would be a minute she will start a fresh batch...okay! Still kinda confused on how it worked but hey....fake it till you make it....lol. We got our food family style and it was good. No refills on drinks, 20 minutes later steamed buns show up..still no egg rolls. We asked the dim sum cart about the egg rolls and she said sorry they will be right out. Another 10 mins we finsh up the bbq pork and pancakes and still no refills on drinks and no egg rolls....at this time we were full, thirsty and ready to go. We finally get the waiter to come over tell him we did not get egg rolls and we did not want to wait. Gave us the bill, paid and left.

I had two servers with very different attitudes- the girl who kept coming by was super sweet and incredibly helpful and nice to my baby!  The guy who was coming by seemed to be mad he was there and was very quiet and he also came off as irritated that I had a baby who was laughing away at the menu and tearing up napkins.  Mind you as someone who was a server I not only clean up after myself and my baby I also tip extra because I know how hard of a job it is.  He was the first person to ""greet"" me so I was relieved when I saw that the girl kept coming by.  I tried the Vietnamese Iced coffee- huge disappointment.  I am half-Vietnamese and it just didn't taste right.  It was like the condensed milk or the coffee was sour- not bitter mind you but distinctly sour.  The steamed pork dumplings, duck fried rice and spring rolls were good but mind you I was starving at around two or three pm and everything is delicious when you are starving.  The food came quickly (the place was pretty empty so I was not surprised.)  I did wish the duck fried rice had less hunks of duck fat which is a personal preference.  The duck itself was pretty good.  Before I left I asked when the dim sum cart went around and the girl pointed to it just sitting near the bar and said it is always available.  It's nice it is always available but how fresh could dim sum off that cart be?  This isn't a health code violation?

It was definitely tasty. Was it worth the 16 dollars? Nope. I understand that being in Summerlin the prices get inflated but it's still Chinese food!!!

It was basically boiled hot water with plain noodles and wontons. Zero flavor. Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered steamed pork dumplings. Obviously, these are frozen dumplings, not made from scratch. The only redeeming things were the dipping sauce for the dumplings and the wonton in the soup. My mom added the dipping sauce to her soup just to make it edible. The service was horrible. I had to get the waiter's attention several times. The last straw was having to flag him down for our check and then, after waiting 10 mins, having to flag him down again to get the change. $6 for Vietnamese coffee! $6 for 4 pieces of har gow!

-Taiwan Beef Noodle
-Onion Pancake
-Shredded Chicken Rice

I'm a big of Taiwanese Beef Noodle and whenever I am in Taipei, I make it a point to try as many different places as I can. What I thought was cool was that there is a picture of a beef noodle shop above the kitchen that dates back many years. It looks like the old part of Taipei where there are a row of beef noodle restaurants next to eachother. My all-time favorite is the now closed Ay-Chung. The broth is not too bad, but the use of raw Napa cabbage is a little unusual. It is probably the ""fusion"" part to appeat to Western tastes? The normal vegetable used (I forget name) is a cooked broad-leafed one. Another reviewer noted they had alot of tendon. My beef didn't have any tendon, but not as tender as I would have liked. Also missing is the preserved vegetable that is always included with this noodle.

Onion pancake was tasty but on the thin side.Also the use of butter is not in the Chinese recipe and again, is probably used to appeal to Western tastes.

The Shredded Chicken fried rice was very flavorful.

Didn't try the dum-sum since it didn't look too appealing and I doubt it would taste better than our favorite places in Vancouver, BC (we feel that Vancouver has some of the best dim-sum in Western North America). Vancouver is a place we frequent often.

We were happy with the service and the waiter was very courteous and spoke Chinese to us. Glad we didn't order the tea as one reviewer noted that it is $4.99 a pot which is ridiculous.

I would sum up this place as, ""150% more money for 75% of the portion size for a comparable Spring Mtn/Chinatown restaurant."" We would definitely go back since it is just ""around the corner"" for those lazy days when we don't want to drive down to Spring Mtn.

I don't understand why they had to handwrite a bill (ALL MESSY) in the first place. (Like they didn't want us to read what the bill said and charge is for something we didn't pay for). It really felt like that. Otherwise why would they keep talking smack about us and keep giving us dirty looks for something that wasn't even our fault. It was such a horrible experience! We're definitely NOT going back there. EVER. I give them one star because the place is nice. And that's all thats great about it.

We ordered steamed pork dumplings, steamed BBQ pork buns, sticky rice, and sesame noodles with chicken. The dumplings were soggy and had zero flavor; I literally tasted nothing more than the water absorbed during the steaming process. The accompanying dipping sauce was so salty, however, that the excess water was a necessity. The pork buns were dry and had the texture of Wonder bread. The sticky buns were false advertising; once we started digging in, a foreign object fell from the center. We were told the dish was simply sticky rice...not sticky rice with shredded pork and sausage in the center. Not a pleasant surprise for us. Oh, the sesame noodles...have you ever tasted mud? That was my first impression after a small bite. Inedible, at best. We spent approximately $35 on food.

Where do the stars come in? The hostess and waiter were friendly, albeit with a major language barrier. Their beer list left something to be desired, but we got Tiger Lagers, which were the only things worth paying for.",k2YDuc0ClYuW86L_6ISnKQ,0,0,2,rKtdRIUwGQbD-dj_jWI0Kw

I got a chance to shop around and visit new food places.

One of the places I stopped by was Rice Republic, after reading the mixed reviews I wasn't quite sure what to expect however I was in the mood for Asian food so I gave it try.

I ordered the minced pork with rice, it was full of delicious yum-yum!! 
It was a good balance of savory, smokey sweet flavor.
I also tried the Dan-Dan Noodles with shredded chicken. This is like a perfect type chicken soup to eat when your ill. It was tasty and was great comfort food. 

My only downfall was that I wish I hadn't eaten lots of the noodle, because it got me full and I wasn't able to finish the delicious broth. I felt the prices were expected considering the location. For my appetite, I felt the portions were big, so I actually ended up taking home some leftovers.

I felt the staff was kind and attentive.
I sat at the bar so I mostly kept to myself, but 
I was able to talk to the manager briefly and ask about the dishes I ate. He was nice enough to explain what goes into making the dish which was cool.
As I was walking out, Maria the hostess asked me if I enjoyed the food and i explained my reaction. 
Initially, when I walked in I told her this was my first time eating here so I believe that's why she asked me. She was happy that i liked the food and we had some small talk. 
I could tell she was friendly person.

Food: OK
Service: Bad
Atmosphere: OK (kinda sterile though)
Price: Higher (There are much better, cheaper places in town, but for Downtown Summerlin it's not overpriced)

Longer Version
We went to this places more or less on a whim. I've walked past a few times, but never got in. When we sat down staff was friendly and decently attentive. However, ordering turned out to be more difficult. They took forever to bring some of the food. When we first sat down we ordered a ramen, after waiting for about an hour and telling them twice it still didn't come. We asked one more time and our server forgot that we ordered it (even though we told them twice). Left it off and got the check. Their prices are rather high, though that's too be expected from a restaurant in Downtown Summerlin.

Conclusion
Despite their food being good (nothing extraordinary though) I won't go there again. Service was bad to the point where they forgot what we ordered after telling them multiple times. Which, to me, is as important as the food served.",0y-8L9hXemQew1K1j68KEw,1,0,2,2EPnJVVbxT83q7Vdd0WCsQ

5367286,2016-01-18,0,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"I have given this place a solid 5 visits since they opened. The first week early 2015, this place rocked with the quality-to-price experience. The second visit, I had food poisoning from a shrimp dumpling that was not pulled from the bottom of the dim-sum cart but rather, from the top. Bad move if you know anything about restaurant service and dim-sum in particular. The rotation of the cylindrical steamer trays is bottom to top to ensure heat and any nothing is left cool too long.
Third and subsequent visits were okay, bordering on mediocre. After almost one year,  I came back to visit. I ordered two staple dim-sum dishes...lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice with chicken, pork bao and a green tea. The lotus sticky rice had ONE piece of chicken and two other unknown vegetable ingredients. When this place first opened it had HALF of it filled with chicken. The bao bun, same thing; the rice dough was 1-1/2 inch thick around barely a teaspoon of pork when it used to be a rounded tablespoon of filling. 
Here is the insult to injury. Green tea (ONE tea bag) and a pot of hot water is $3.88!! I get the .88, it's cute, even practical for superstitious Chinese restaurants that want good luck but, $2.88 is already a 1200% margin!!!

The 2 pieces of shrimp tempura ($6.95) were coated in panko not tempura batter. The chicken egg rolls were crisp yet filled with vermicelli noodles so the kids didn't like them. The Singapore noodles were quite tasty although the bbq pork was thin and tough like sliced jerky. The soda was $2.98 which is expected in this high priced restaurant.

We walked in (party of 2) and it was empty with the exception of a large group in the middle of the restaurant.

The guy walked us over to another small table for two, and I explained again that we wanted a 4-seater table so we could sit next to each other. Didn't think it was a big deal, since the place was pretty much empty. He grabbed the menus and threw them down hard in the middle of a large table and walked away. 

Uhm, what? RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!!
We both decided we should probably leave, but were craving dim sum and were starving. So despite our first reaction, we stayed. BIG MISTAKE. 

The service continued to be rude, the tall guy stood in the corner and watched us like a hawk...and the ""dim sum"" cart was very bad. There were only four choices to choose from in one cart.

Impressed by cleanliness,  attentive  staff in addition to great food.  Luv, the GM, was quite interesting to discuss the restaurant and the food.  you can tell he loves his job and is passionate about what he does.  Lisa, the assistant mgr. was also a delight to talk with about my dining experience; very enthusiastic.   I will be back soon to try some of the other dishes.",3fMENOAnuMluMfMoctrS7w,1,1,5,PmGYmf6e_zZqZcgItWjdgw
5850168,2017-01-15,0,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"1 star for extremely poor customer service...not food since I never even got seated!  My story...went in today about 10 mins ago a little before 4pm on a Saturday.   Restaurant nearly empty yet host would not seat me at one of the many open tables because I am a party of one.   Insisted I sit at bar because no small tables open ( yet restaurant pretty empty expect for the few occupied 2 tops and a party of 2 sitting at a 4 top!  
I am in my fifties and fairly short.... bar is always uncomfortable for me!   I could understand if this was a busy lunch or dinner time... but it was not!
It's a shame but I suppose Rice Republic is doing well and opts to turn away customers.  
I will not return and will tell a friend or two of my experience.",a_fKKdy2eBY84tTHt6Vzig,1,0,1,1XKZ05bSf7hhBeSXIeCfQw
5884156,2015-03-07,0,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,Went here after a movie in downtown Summerlin. We had a wonderful experience and enjoyed the food. The shrimp dumplings and the beef Taiwanese soup were delicious. The manager Luv is amazing. He made sure we were able to be served even though we got there near closing. He is very open to reviews and I hope all these negative reviewers told him instead of just putting it on the internet. We thought it was wonderful and will definitely be back again!,MuVntUDfxt3ZeAz4RQIVww,1,0,5,fkTluD9TqebDgPfG6ktNKw

5928813,2015-12-19,1,fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg,"Surprisingly good! When I first saw this restaurant in Downtown Summerlin, I honestly didn't think the food here would be great. All of the good Chinese restaurants are in Chinatown aren't they? Although the food is not as awesome as what you would find in Chinatown, I thought it was pretty tasty and filling. My usual order is the BBQ Pork Fried Rice and the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns from their Dim Sum cart. The fried rice is always full of flavor and never dry. Portion size is what you normally see at a Chinese restaurant. I always take home leftovers! Kind of hard to screw up the BBQ Pork buns, but they are usually hot and fresh. One time it seemed like they were sitting out for a while and did not taste as good. It's kind of weird that they even have a Dim Sum cart when the restaurant is small and the tables are so close to each other. Although I have not tried it, my husband likes to order the roast duck here.

Prices are definitely high, but that is expected because they are in Summerlin. Service is unfortunately hit or miss. Sometimes the employees are friendly and attentive. Other times, the waiter or waitress will take your order and then you never see them again. 

I shop at Downtown Summerlin, so I will definitely be back!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,3,4,OUCmZez_qRQxPuPOaXkUkA

This place is not kid friendly at all. Also, this restaurant is expensive for the amount of food received. I will not be returning.",Yg2hLH4e_XnvupNi_WeE0A,2,0,1,oKJB2wNEimI37FXVRExGtw
