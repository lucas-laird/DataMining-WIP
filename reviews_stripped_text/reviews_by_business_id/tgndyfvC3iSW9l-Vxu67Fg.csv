Menu features a variety of fresh pastries, traditional breakfast offerings, and various salads, sandwiches, and sliders. I particularly enjoyed the grilled ahi tuna salad, with olives, anchovies, egg, and roasted tomatoes. For a $9 salad, the variety of toppings is plentiful but a little on the salty side, could use more greens to balance out. 

Service is walk-up, pay before you seat yourself. Food was slow to come out on both of my visits, but the al fresco seating is peaceful. Hours are limited, closing at 2PM- would love to see them extend to three, as I work nearby but can't make it by on weekdays for lunch before they close.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,3,3,DFWtp5kz1LTDmHKEdBRcyg

I received my food quickly and it was delicious. I plan on coming back to this caf√© to try the different sandwiches they offer. I on the other hand ordered eggs scrambled with cheese, bacon, toast, and potatoes.",uz1_cds7yyehTPYnrArdYA,0,1,5,mRt0XlGfzluMNpsVUwoTaQ
