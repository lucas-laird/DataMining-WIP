The great experience started at the entrance... Jessie ( certified server w/ the blue hair) has a great personality, and was attentive the whole time. The food took a while, but it was soooooo worth it! Um, they made our tortillas from scratch!! Everything was made to order, the guacamole was real avocado and delicious!! We will be back every time we come into town!!!",n9rDCZxGkSZ6RXVEM2G6Ag,0,0,5,qpbd-gWXDy84SxavttE-qg

It is a great spot off the strip for sure worth the drive. The customer service and price are just a cherry on top. I will for sure come back to this place when I'm in town.

3396978,2018-04-26,0,RJ5UZBzWm67j0h6cxV80kQ,"Ok Yelpers.... you got me again.... Fantastic reviews... so I was very excited to find a new local great mexican restaurant... so after seeing the glowing reviews, I gave it a shot for lunch. Went in about 12:45 and the place was basically empty with the exception of one person ....that should've been a clue once I got there.  The wait staff was really nice and welcoming as others have said. The waitress brought out salsa and chips with bean dip and then noodle soup which was actually pretty good. I ordered the Carne Asada plate for lunch and when it came out it looked pretty good. Unfortunately that's where it stopped the Carne Asada was thicker than normal and was not not well seasoned and was very dry, over cooked and tough. The rice was well seasoned but was hard, it was like it had been sitting for awhile. 
Again, I really was looking forward to a new wonderful Mex place, but unfortunately this did not ring the bell for me....",Gy6W9VtYtsYObtiNe1C4EA,0,0,2,xGP1noQY2LlLLbPfAmiPJQ
3457758,2018-04-17,0,RJ5UZBzWm67j0h6cxV80kQ,This place is absolutely amazing!!! Stef was our server and was superb! They give you chips salsa and bean dip to start... then before the meal Stef brought us a tortilla soup that was really good! When we got out entrees we were already sold but they really out did them selves to the point we are rolling out of here...we are so full!,PTWZwycL8Y_f5r2yw7bugQ,0,0,5,jz78I1Cd1Q84Jq_FFFgmkw

The portion/cost ratio is in your favor as well. If you leave here hungry, it is your fault.",_S6vu2ceWoi6ExxN6ggT_g,0,0,5,-tfptlvoQd4VAxaKaTbXkA

4437132,2018-04-18,1,RJ5UZBzWm67j0h6cxV80kQ,"A hidden gem. First, the Micheladas are great.   Had one with Pacifico.  It was a bit on the spicy side so make sure you ask for not-to-spicy if you can't handle it.   It was delicious.   The torta was very good too.  Bread was fresh.     I had the mole enchiladas.  Excellent.   A bit spicy but the sour cream helped.  Very authentic.   Overall everything was fresh and excellent.  It did take a while to get food but not too bad and we were not in a hurry.   The place was a bit empty but I don't think it will remain that way as people try their food and Micheladas.   By the way, came back and had an horchata.  It was excellent.  The pupusas were very good too.",dXIO-WFQJ8pwQ5M2STewZA,1,1,5,RA59YuD09_42NMThaBVtXA

Los Cedros Mexican Restaurant is absolutely delicious!  I have been twice in six days. The staff are so friendly. Jessie (female) was extremely helpful and attentive. She made our eating experience fabulous!
The bean dip and salsa are very tasty.  
The complimentary soup is quite the bonus (more restaurants need to do this). 
Their tortilla chips are nice and crunchy- not at all like some Mexican restaurants where they're thin and greasy. 
The sizzling chicken and shrimp fajitas are on point and a Dos Equis ambar tops the whole meal off to total perfection. 
If you're craving Mexican food, get to this place immediately!",_K7sQwytcF41cyJA_2laAA,0,0,5,mgsuZiDzkaW2p1Nir9iL6Q

Asked For a margarita on ice and asked for top shelf,  they said they only had one type of tequilaand I got a blended one in which i couldn't taste alcohol. We shared a two-person steak fajita and were greatly disappointed. Never have I had fajitas not sizzling when arriving to the table,  but these had a 1/4 inch puddle of oil on the bottom and were silent.  Got the MOST basic beans/rice (which were cold), no guac or pico de gallo. The whole thing was severely underwhelming... lack of flavor!!",FdCry1fn5Yl5LVfRDHPlTg,0,0,2,x-XxpAwCPKZ5D85Ply3RaQ

The cooks were awesome I asked to modify a plate in which no other restaurant would ever do for me and they allowed it. Kind of a hard place to find I missed it when trying to find it. Very cool experience will be back and would recommend trying it out. Don't pass it up next time your out slide thru.,oS2g5B7-dFUdbx9Sh-610A,0,0,3,IrUQw9KVXyKNRq74GhLzqg
