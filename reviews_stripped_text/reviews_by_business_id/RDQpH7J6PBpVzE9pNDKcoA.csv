Anyway, they had a hand full of mexican favorites on the menu like enchiladas, tacos, fish tacos,  burritos, salads, etc. I'm a burrito guy, so I ordered the carne asada burrito. This huge burrito was filled with rice, beans, lettuce, carne asada, sour cream, and homemade salsa which had cilantro, which I loved. One thing you can notice is the fresh and quality ingredients. It also came with some tortilla chips that were not greasy. The restaurant is pretty classy for a mexican restaurant and plays nice music too. I like that you can get a real Coca-Cola in the glass bottle. It looked like a lot of people were ordering the fish tacos, so I'll have to try them on my next visit. The prices were reasonable and the staff was very friendly. I will be back soon.",HNCSCL2XbddJtEheZ0i9bw,2,0,5,2WB4Y8kFyVU6vY7ah7tFpQ

The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",1jJytkYCU25oHfLFHgDuDA,0,0,5,vB8BzjzPHw0E31QcMmyM8A

You know how some mexican food places have great tasting food, but its really greasy? This is not that kind of food. The food here is fresh, tasty, it's just so beyond your average taco joint. Fish tacos are great, tacos dorados are excellent, chicken taco, carne asada taco are good.  Comfortable place to eat with plenty of booths. You order your food at the counter, pay at the counter, and pick it up at the counter.",1N9jCUeyz4zVooPbFop7lQ,1,0,5,jEND8wTSRiRzwwI_HRQFKw
2164307,2011-04-07,0,RDQpH7J6PBpVzE9pNDKcoA,"On a business trip to Vegas, I needed some place to eat. I came across Peppers, and thought ""I'll give it a shot"". At first I was concerned because it was around 5pm and there was only one other person besides my self in the place. I looked at the menu and saw authentic Mexican food and went for it. 

I ordered the chicken in tomotillio sauce. I never had this before, but was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious. I also had a pair of flautas. Now, I am sure I am crossing the line here, but they are really just taquitos for those who aren't latin/hispanic. 

The customer service was great, and the place was really clean. I used the restroom and I felt like I was in a hotel suite. 

Really nice spot, especially for an ""out of town-er"" like myself.",atYqJbIc7rkjN9FhxHNzzg,0,0,4,QCJyleRWCEBq3cjwcbMZSg

Mulitas are like a taco/quesadilla hybrid. The standard taco meat, onions, and cilantro is served with cheese between two toasted, taco-sized tortillas. Very nice dish.",Hzt4UPkvv7VXHXVBAlfIqw,1,0,4,rHhTSgzg_d9ZnCIkPmKhfQ

2886860,2010-06-07,1,RDQpH7J6PBpVzE9pNDKcoA,"This family-owned resto between Sunset and Warm Springs serves a mean fish taco.  These suckers are the perfect blend of tortilla (smallish corn tortillas which are just big enough to wrap around the delish insides), fish (flash fried and not too oily) and spice (there's both a cilantro and chipotle sauce which are used for drizzling).   Also, if you get the fish taco combo (a deal for $6.99), there's yummy rice and beans that come with...  One phrase: Eat it... it's worth the wait at lunch time.",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,1,1,4,viwDFXBEd6SZ3q09YUouRw

4737116,2011-01-16,0,RDQpH7J6PBpVzE9pNDKcoA,"More of a 3.5 -- which requires a return visit to try some of the other offerings. This place is clean, has a well-organized menu and speedy service. My veggie burrito was less vegetable, and more your typical rice & bean fare. It could have been less messy with the wet ingredients that on top of the rice & beans included guacamole and sour cream. But overall a good experience. Mild salsas, good rice & beans, non-greasy chips and good service in a clean restaurant.",AFNHrbJD8pGewNxYJABKEQ,2,2,3,yA_4rnAhtQ15iz7O1qqniw
4888977,2008-05-02,1,RDQpH7J6PBpVzE9pNDKcoA,"I give this place a 3.5 stars. I absolutely loved the fish tacos. They use a creamy cilantro sauce that is perfect! It's not too tangy and the cilantro is not overpowering. The fish was delicious cuz it was real fish.. not a fishstick!! Lots of lettuce and just a little lime was needed cuz yanno.. limes are great! 

I had their horchata which was ehhh.. a little watered down. I like mine sweet. 

Also had their nachos which were yummy and crisp and not greasy. WIsh there was more cheese. but for 4.99 you can't be picky right?
The fish tacos were only 1.99 and the best I've ever had!",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,1,2,3,fRYzk-5AqBgpRnPLxpoG0g
5528002,2011-03-19,0,RDQpH7J6PBpVzE9pNDKcoA,"Wow. I got the fish tacos plate with a mulita on the side. Why yes, i would like to try each both sauces for the fish tacos. 
All I know is, this food was so good I felt like I was breaking laws eating it. My sister and I kept an eye out for the po-lice, because this was sinful stuff.  Everything tasted fantastic and I cannot wait to come here again.",rpWCcNQD7nGVUYoU6vzCFw,0,0,5,s6feDQUBPbWSev4SFH49Zw
