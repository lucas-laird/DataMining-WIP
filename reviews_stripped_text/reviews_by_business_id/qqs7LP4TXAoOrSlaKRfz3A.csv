The salads are excellent and one of my favorite dishes is the veggie curry. The vegetables are crunchy and the all of the flavors in the curry make my mouth do a happy dance. The serving sizes are relatively big and the prices are fair.

I did the Sunday brunch a few weeks ago, however the chicken and waffles wasn't to my liking. I like the concept but the waffles were a bit dense and the chicken was a bit over fried.

The staff is pleasant and explained everything on the menu to us. The food was delicious, however while some reviewers are saying that the portions were huge, be aware that not all portions are huge. My hubby got the lamb chops and there was very little meat on the bone, so not a lot to fill him up. Desserts though were massive and delicious!!

The curry soup is amazing.  The fried chicken is as good as the fried chicken at Michael Symon's Bar Symon (his signature dish  , which I recently decided was the best fried chicken I'd ever had.  Sorry Michael, it's a tie for first).  It's outstanding, and the chive mashed and truffled mac and cheese were...help I can't find the superlatives!
When a restaurant names a dessert ""the perfect chocolate cake"", it's like a dare...so I tried it.  It is the perfect chocolate cake.  Baked perfectly, with some subtle differences between the cake, icing, and chocolate shavings.  
I'm looking forward to many great dining experiences at DW...and the owners are great guys, which adds to the enjoyment.

I have to admit, we were a tad bit put off by it.  Our opinion was that if a place WANTED to look trendy, then it had something to hide...and we were looking for it.  Good thing for DW Bistro, they won us over.  Sure, it felt trendy and yuppy.  Sure, the restaurant looked 20-something and L.A chic, but what's the service and food like?  Well, luckily for them, we were won over in that department as well.  The food was AMAZING.  Our server had an accent and I didn't understand him, but I didn't care.  He still kept our iced tea glasses full, and he often checked in with us.  That's true customer service.  Then, at the end - before paying the bill - we asked our server about the restaurant and it's history and it's food style, etc.  He was very knowledgable, and it seemed he was quite proud of the establishment.  Well, no need to keep preaching - we will be back.  
This place is great.  BUT WAIT!!  All of a sudden, he shows up and says, ""we'd like to give you a complimentary dessert just because...""  What???  First of all, we were already full.  But, okay- sure we'll try your dessert.  They gave us a complimentary slice of the most amazing carrot cake I've ever had.

DW Bistro is a small, trendy restaurant, but it's worth the time and the empty stomach.  No, really - GO!",fFQHmytaERnXR6dYYL0o2Q,0,0,4,UfxwXq8yvQPCv9160FppXA

My favorite is either the curry chicken bowl with cous cous or the fried chicken and a side of mac and cheese as an entree.  Since their opening date in 2010, this dish has maintained consistency in flavor and unique texture. I might add that its price has remained well into the value range.  The servers are friendly, attentive and remember you when you return. Another favorite is the cornbread, dense, cakey, and flavorful.

Jerk Chicken $22, small portion of chicken for the price considering it only comes with rice & peas and a spoon of vegetables. Fried Chicken $22, over priced considering it only comes with cornbread & gravy and NO vegetables.

116159,2011-06-04,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"This restaurant is a nice hidden gem on the west side of the valley.  Trendy, cool, and fresh.  It's a fusion restaurant with influences of Jamaican and tastes from New Mexico in their cuisine.  This place is perfect for a date.  

When I walked into the restaurant, I first noticed the chic decor, artwork, and open space.  They have a patio area, but my friend and I ate inside since it was full on a Friday night around 7:30 p.m.   However, we were seated promptly.

I was going to make reservations in advance, but noticed on their website that they only take them for parties of 8 or more.  

When we asked for a wine list, they didn't have one but I didn't care since I'm not a wine connoisseur.  We just took recommendations from the waiter.

The price points for the cuisine on their dinner menu look reasonable.  I ordered the chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta which was a generous size portion for $13.  The presentation of the dish was impressive and the temperature of the meal when it came to the table was just right.  It was warm enough, but not too hot.  The flavors blended well.  Delicious!    

Dessert was amazing too!  We ordered a chocolate whipped cream which melted in my mouth.

I definitely recommend this place and will be back for sure to try other things on their menu.",Rk6PsHdIfusm0CAglctdkQ,0,0,4,-IFKh472ZhTfJoJ9omf-ow

124304,2012-06-06,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"DW Bistro is one of my favorite non-burger joints in town; I've never had a bad meal there and love everything about the place. There are so many great things to try each time between the regular items and the specials that the burger near the bottom of the menu has never crossed my mind. A friend recently tried it and has been raving ever since, so it was during a recent visit with some friends that I caved and decided to give it a try. Did mixing my burger business with some of my favorite local eats work out ok?

For a local strip mall restaurant, DW is surprisingly cool inside; it's very clean with white walls, floors and furniture, highlighted with orange ceilings and some brightly colored artwork. I was definitely impressed the first time I went and I'm still happy every time I'm there. As I said earlier the menu has some great items with its Caribbean inspired flavors like Jamaican curries, jerk rubs and one of my favorites the New Mexican-style slow cooked pork. The lunch and dinner menus vary slightly, and their brunches are excellent. I compel you to get to the bottom of the glass of your bottomless mimosa before one of their waiters comes by to refill it.

But today is a special occasion, and it's time to talk about their burger which is available on both their lunch and dinner menus: a New Mexican-style green chili cheeseburger topped with jalapeno bacon. As expected it was fantastic. The meat had great flavor, although not cooked medium rare as I had ordered. But the burger wasn't dry because of all the amazing cheese and sauce on top of it. The lettuce and tomatoes were great; they almost reminded me of a po boy you'd find in the south. The bun was soft, great and proportioned perfectly to the meat. The green chilies were fantastic, and the bacon was thick, crispy and delicious with a hint of heat. Overall this was an excellent burger, and should have been expected from a place where I've already loved everything I ordered.

The sweet potato fries are among the best I've had; cooked just right and not soft and undercooked as they can often be. They had excellent flavor and were seasoned perfectly. The accompanying aioli was sweet and delicious. DW Bistro is already a place I recommend to friends looking for a great off the strip restaurant, but now I can also include it in the small list of burgers I hold in high regard in Las Vegas. While some meals for two can quickly get a bit expensive here, this burger for $10 is a great deal and well worth the visit.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,5,7EkU0JAVj4vMwdoGswzXrw

I have friends that have been raving about this place for months so when a date asked where I wanted to go to dinner I jumped at the opportunity to go to DW Bistro. And I was not disappointed.

The service was amazing! Our waiter said he was a customer converted into an employee so he had really helpful tips about the food.I started with a glass of red wine then I ordered the Jamaican Curry Chicken Bowl. I was shocked when a giant bowl of colorful vegetables, chicken and rice came out. It was HUGE! And really delicious. The veggies were cooked to perfection. The chicken was perfectly tender and the Jasmine rice was delicious. I barely made a dent in the bowl so the server offered to put it in a microwavable to-go box so I could take it for lunch the next day. I wasn't planning on ordering dessert but my date insisted. I got the red velvet cake and pretty much died when I took the first bite. It was so light and flavorful, unlike most red velvet cakes I've had. My date had the lemon lime pudding that came with fresh berries and blood orange truffles. All delicious. I again couldn't finish the cake so our server wrapped that up for me as well. When we were done eating he told us all about the weekend brunch and I swear I got hungry all over again. I think I will try it this weekend.

258440,2012-12-16,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"My husband and I went here for the first time today- at 5pm on a Saturday- and we were thoroughly impressed. I haven't exactly eaten around at many steakhouses, but so far the best steak I've ever had, I had here. Absolutely delicious. Surprisingly generous portion sizes of top-notch food- they don't compromise quality here! They pay a lot of attention to detail. More details in the breakdown:

Ambience and decor: First thing I noticed was the decor. Though I ultimately don't care about the decor (I'm here for food) I feel like mentioning it anyways since it was very nice. Sort of modern and airy- it would be a nice place to take a date! Music wasn't loud which is always a good thing.

Service: We were promptly seated and the waiters were very friendly and informative. Food came out fast, though I must note there weren't many customers at the time we came. Overall the service was excellent.

Food: TL;DR- EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! Yummm. The drinks were perfect too. Serving sizes were surprisingly large! The quantity for the price was surprising, actually, especially since the food was such high quality.

We were started off with some interesting bread rolls- they had a variety we could pick from. They came with a butter that I think had chipotle blended into it. Delicious.

Husband and I both had gin & tonics with a full order of the jerk fried calamari appetizer. Whoops, we didn't realize how big a full order was! It could easily serve four or more people. Calamari was spicy as jerk calamari should be. (I'm not a big fan of spicy calamari but if you want a good spicy calamari here it is!) The gin & tonics were also delicious and there was a lot of alcohol in them.

I ordered the special which was the filet and scallops with bordelaise sauce. It was served over mashed potatoes and with a variety of vegetables. The steak and scallops were cooked perfectly (I ordered the steak medium-rare), absolutely delicious. Steak and scallops melted in my mouth. I don't think I've scarfed down a steak so quickly. The sauce was delicious as well, not overpowering at all but flavorful and a perfect complement. The serving size was also generous. At $36 I actually consider this dish a steal!

My husband ordered the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork bowl. He said it was delicious. Also the bowl was huge, with lots of meat! Again a generous portion size. He also said the rice was good. They really pay attention to every detail here. Also, the spicy food is actually spicy!

We ended up taking home leftover of both the appetizer and the entrees since we weren't expecting so much food. 

The bill came to $100, not counting the tip, for: 2 gin and tonics, a beer, a coffee, a full order of an appetizer, and two entrees (one of which was steak and scallops.) Since everything was perfect I think the prices are justified, and heck they're only a little pricey.

Ordered short ribs for an appetizer, grilled chicken with rice and jerk chicken curry bowl. Ribs were pretty good (but I cooked them at home so many times and I know it is pretty difficult to mess it up unless you're a really lousy cook). But entrees have really failed (especially for the price) and took good 40 minutes to be delivered (server's explanation was that printer in a kitchen was unplugged! Really, no tickets coming out in a kitchen on Friday night?!)

Jerk chicken curry bowl: looked like a haphazardly thrown together bunch of vegetables with chunks of absolutely unseasoned chicken breast mixed with canned curry sauce. I won't comment on couscous because it is just... couscous. C'mon DW... you can do better than that for $16. Although, I admit that it tasted better next day after soaking the curry sauce :)

Grilled Jerk Chicken breast.... again barely any flavor to it and barely a trace of advertised tropical orange glaze.

We were issued a complimentary cake at the end of the meal... which at least shows that DW acknowledged the long wait and was apologetic about it.

Food aside there are some other issues that DW Bistro management can address if they want to create a proper atmosphere. Since we had good 40 minutes to wait we had nothing to do but observe people around us... in particular, waiters slapping each other butts casually on a dining floor or bus person wiping his nose with his arm (he is either sick or he was doing coke in a back of the house).",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,3,0,2,TfnKqK0jCjlaf2fKcXtEMw

DW Bistro is definitely one of those gems in Las Vegas, not only for the food, but for the amazing ambiance. The modern furniture, beautiful art work, and the relaxing music makes for an environment that is just warm and welcoming.  

The first time I arrived to DW Bistro was to meet up with my friend Mario Luna. He told me about how amazing the atmosphere and the food was, I couldn't say ""no."" I walked into the restaurant and there was the manager Mycole Enciso there to greet me. He informed me that the kitchen was down due to some issues, that they should have it back up shortly, and offered us to have a drink at the bar while we waited. Mycole then escorted us to the bar and told us he would inform us when the kitchen would be back up and running. 

The bartender, though a little sarcastic at first, was great. Only halfway into our first drink, about half an hour there, the kitchen was up and running. I had never had Jamaican style food before so I was excited to try something new. I decided upon the Ox tail and it was good, but the Pan Sired Salmon that Mario had was fantastic. I actually went back about a week and a half later just to have it again. The whole time Mycole was chatting with us and making us feel very welcomed.

The portions in relation to pricing is definitely very good. I ordered the New Mexico style slow cooked pork, to which the waiter asked if I liked spicy. My response was yes. Needless to say, this was actually a very spicy dish. Like zoinks, Yo! I should've known better. New Mexico red chile is freakin' hot! & just to give you an idea of the level of spice...the leftovers I took home, I added a can of chili & some tomato sauce & it was still spicy! Lol.

What really set it off was when I tried some of their recommended Jamaican hot sauces to the sandwich. One was a mango type hot sauce and another a gingery type and both were slightly sweet. The grace hot sauce was more hot but more of a vinegar based. Combined all the sauces on my sandwich took it to a whole different level.

Being from New Mexico, I grew up on the infamous green & red chile (chili) so it's always a pleasure to see places use it to it's full potential. I must admit that the Jamaican Green Chile Chicken Curry soup was quite enjoyable but I wish it had a stronger curry flavor as the curry taste seemed to disappear within seconds. 

The NM slow-cooked pork bowl was huge and quite spicy just like I remember NM red chile being. Due to the meat/rice ratio, you would need to add another egg to calm the burning sensation you might experience while eating it as one of my friend's stated. When I asked to have my leftovers to be boxed, I was a little sad to find out the waiter-in-training had thrown my leftovers away :( BOOOOO!

My guest had the braised short ribs and those too were quite delectable. The meat was so tender that it just fell apart. She wasn't a fan of the house rice that it came with so the waitress accommodated her by bringing a bowl of white rice. That seemed to make my guest happy.

The wait staff was um, interesting to say the least. Though very friendly servers, it's not the typical service you would get from other higher end places. They joke around with you, let you whack them with wet towels (waiter who threw away my leftovers) and can be quite sarcastic. If you're offended by sarcasm, perhaps this isn't the place for you. If you want to hang out with the cool kids but want to avoid the Strip, this is the place to be.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0,0,4,Lceq7WbsvwQRlNR3DxI-LA

It was a red velvet cake with a berry sauce on the side and white chocolate shavings. The other piece of cake was an absolutely delicious carrot cake that ended up being my favorite of the two!

470527,2010-04-08,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"When you walk into DW Bistro, you get the feeling that you've entered an upper scale Strip eatery. The decor is very modern, whimsical and warm. With a NYC loft feel to it. The staff is very friendly and the owners Dalton and Bryce greet with a warm smile and hearty hello. I was there to take-out lunch, but decided to sit at the bar and enjoy my surroundings.

I started by ordering a Jamaican Ginger Beer and was instantly blown away. It was delicious and reasonably priced at $3 (it comes with free refills). I ordered their Caesar Salad, which had a flare to it. The dressing was a chipotle caesar dressing, drizzled over whole fresh lettuce with whole shaved parmesan and a crostini. It was fantastic. The added spice of the chipotle was a nice touch and turned an ordinary Caesar Salad into an extraordinary starter. 

For my main course I ordered the Jamaican Curry Chicken. I'm usually not a huge curry fan, but Bryce, the owner, talked me into it. I am sure glad that he did. The chicken was tender and melted in my mouth. The curry wasn't over-powering and complimented the chicken, onions and thyme well. I was very pleased with the dish. 

I splurged a little and ordered their Red Velvet cake for dessert. It was perfect! The best Red Velvet that I have ever had. Moist, with white-chocolate shavings that just melted in my mouth. It's served with a small cup of raspberries and sugar-free whipped cream.

DW Bistro is the perfect place to eat for the westside. I plan on going back for dinner with the wife this weekend. My overall experience was  delightful and I left feeling satisfied in both the stomach, taste buds and  pocketbook.",lJAp6PY4TTak7YyY-TplPA,5,0,4,UKpSnIO-5FyRbzRrJCSTFw

474773,2015-09-30,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I stumbled upon this cute little bistro by accident. I was shopping in a little strip mall and saw a bunch of people milling around outside and a nice little patio. When I was in the area near lunch time on Sunday, I thought I would pop in with a friend.

The place was packed, but we were able to order drinks at the bar and relax while we waited for a table to be available. I ordered the iced tea, and was surprised to have a tall glass of cranberry colored liquid handed to me. I asked is this iced tea? And they said yes it is white tea, with pomegranate. It was delicious. I did not need to add any sweetener to it. I am an ice tea purest, but this was a nice refreshing change. My companion ordered the bottomless mimosas and enjoyed several.

This restaurant is Jamaican and Cuban inspired. It is not a fusion restaurant but these elements are a part of each item they prepare.  My companion ordered the Cuban pulled pork with egg, she enjoyed it very much.  she said it was absolutely delicious. I ordered the BLT, which was huge. I actually had to deconstruct it to eat it. The bacon was jalapeño bacon, A nice crisp bacon with a tiny bit of bite! Instead of mayonnaise they used a chipotle sauce,  sparingly used but had a Ton of flavor.

For dessert, we shared a piece of carrot cake. It was amazing. Full of shredded carrots and real cream cheese frosting with shreds of white chocolate on top. I could barely eat a few bites because it was so rich!  My companion managed to polish it off.

Not to be excluded, the service was great!

I would highly recommend DW Bistro for brunch, I would really love to go back during the week and try other items on their menu. Perhaps something with a Jamaican flare next time!",2qG875EzMfFMDcqaDvIjkw,1,1,5,UW0mgROlLKBWCm4RtaWtPw

475817,2014-01-17,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Located in Southwest Las Vegas, DW Bistro is a delightfully refreshing restaurant that combines Mexican and Jamaican flavors into its menu. The ambiance is cool, clean and modern -- almost a hipster's paradise except that you'll see all walks of life in this dining establishment munching on the amazing fare offered here for brunch, lunch and dinner. 

The restaurant itself has a small yet sleek waiting lounge, and two main dining rooms all with large windows letting in gorgeous light for a pick-me-up with your morning mimosa, which are bottomless on Sundays. There is also a main bar located in the larger dining room that is filled with glass containers displaying alcohol-infused concoctions and special drink menu items. If you're heading there solo, just pull up a seat at the bar and watch as the bartender creates compelling and beautiful libations for patrons. However, if you can go with friends or family, you'll be able to spit and taste more of the menu.

The brunch and lunch menu has traditional options but all with delectable twists such as DW Oatmeal that has slivered almonds, cream, coconut as well as golden raisons and berries. For a real treat, though, order the jerk pork hash with is seasoned and slow-cooked served over eggs, your choice of style, and crispy, flavorful potatoes. It's also served with a warm tortilla to spoon the hash onto -- just be sure to ask about the size difference between the half and the full order. The half order is usually a sustainable amount of food to last you all day.

Not in the mood for breakfast? Then try the DW turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Honestly, the best turkey burger I've ever tasted it comes with mango pear apple chutney. And if you're feeling extra indulgent, get the fresh blueberry & white chocolate scones or DW pastry basket to split among the table. Fresh-baked and warm, these pastries are to die for! 

They usually have specials of the day, which are freshly made with unique items. Don't forget to get a beverage from the bar and their full and very-unique cocktail menu. The Bloody Mary is a personal favorite, although it is not for the faint of heart or those with a low tolerance to spice. It does come with the best crispy bacon I've ever had -- a special jalapeño pickled bacon slice. To cool things down a bit, each order comes with a side of fresh fruit, which is a lovely way to cleanse the palate.

Not having yet been there for dinner I can't attest to the menu items, but after perusing the dinner menu and my experiences with brunch and lunch, I can with great certainty say I'll be returning for the jerk oven roasted baby back ribs and the couscous salad very soon.",o4DTgtdKpi_qpoHw4NsP5Q,0,0,5,wMZMkY8_RX09lSCObm87qQ

The food is a fun fusion of Jamaican and New Mexican cuisine.  And it's pretty darn tasty.  We had the Chilaquiles, the Jamaican Curry Bowl with chicken and the New Mexican Pork Bowl.  The Chilaquiles were very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  The Jamaican Curry Bowl would have been fine without the chicken because it was chock full of veggies, although the chicken was delicious.  The New Mexican Pork Bowl had good flavor, but the meat was a bit dry and that brought the whole dish down.

This is obviously a really trendy spot with lots a beautiful people, but us casual ladies fit fine, so don't feel like you have to dress up.  The ambiance is friendly and casual.

          I got the chix curry soup DW salad as starters the soup was a little salty for my taste it had a nice curry / coconut flavor , wife loved it.
       we also tried the jerk chicken salad the chix was flavorful ,but the breast looked like half of one very small., it came with jicama , orange, mac nuts and a mango vinaigrette. The salad was dressed really light ,for my taste. 
    I had the braised short ribs with a port bordelaise sauce the short ribs were tender but the sauce was  thick and had a non discript flavor , kind of muddled flavors.   It was on a bed of mash sweet pot? It was orange  like sweet potato,but did not have the sweetness of sweet potato? The color threw my taste buds for a loop, because every bite expecting sweet but getting a bland mash potato flavor, not good to mess with my taste buds like that, bad.
          My wife had the special which was the dover sole in a tortilla crust , it was a large piece of fish . over mash with 3 sauces, red roasted pepper sauce , mango/pepper sauce don't remember the 3rd sauce lots of things going on in this dish , which in this case was a good thing ,because everything worked well together. it had better at  $38 it better rock somebody's world and it did , wife loved it .
        They had a nice bread basket that you chose out of , I had the brioche it was very good, wife  had the pretzel bread , before i could see about getting another piece of bread the butter was whisked away, wth. Tight with the bread?

The hubby & I got a seat right a way when we arrived but the host seated us in a table that was not prepped with silverware let alone cleaned off. There was a perfectly ready table right across that he could have seated us in instead but what ever. Half a star off. 

Our food took over 1/2 an hour for the fist dish to come out. That's defiantly one star off. What we ordered:
- For starters: DW chicken lollipops $12 This was served under cooked. But we didn't complain cause by the time we were served the hubby & I were famished. For what ever reason I was thinking this dish would be crumbled-up chicken rolled up in bread crumbs and served on a skewer. Instead it's drumstick chicken with the the ends cut off to make the lollipop look. I wasn't impressed only because the bone exposed where shared and there was bits of shared bone on the meat. Over priced for my taste. 
Another 15 minutes later we get our main dishes.
- The hubby ordered: DW bowl of New-Mexican-style slow cooked pork $11. This dish came with a lot of kick and was delicious, I speak for my husband too, lol. Definitely worth the price
- I ordered: Jerk fried chicken & waffles $14 Now when I was ordered this I was thinking of Roscoe's chicken & waffles just w/a Jerk flava. I sure wasn't reading the description when I ordered this, lol. As stated the chicken was served on top of the waffles. I'm not a cook per se but I don't think that's a good idea. Well the description goes on to say atop crispy waffles but if not served right a way it withers down and takes the crisp a way, which it did. But I must say their signature syrup was delicious. The chicken though was slightly over breaded but came with a good amount Jerk flava. 

The atmosphere is really nice, I agree with the other comments it does look like the inside of Ikea. Aside from the Jamaican hot sauce bottles and the color splash in the restroom it could use a dash more Caribbean feel to make it complete. The restaurant fairly sized with outdoor seating but deng it got pretty loud inside, lol. 

The house manager was nice enough to make his rounds and check on guest but of course misses our table so another half star off. I know it's sound a little petty but it makes me feel because I'm brown, lmfao. 

So overall 3 stars for now. I say that because we're definitely coming back to try out their dinner menu and who know's we might get to meet the owners next time.",v0LsUNLSO2No_yXu3w2w4A,0,0,3,D2ev0TTD2YXf6klJfbEHDg

Waiters/waitresses need to know their boundaries as to what type of remarks to have to say to their guests.

808467,2017-04-10,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Review on weekend brunch!  Always been a fan of the DW (old location) and was excited to go to the newer and bigger place.  
Decor - so much more spacious, big and bright, and the patio is very beautiful.

Service - all the servers were all friendly and very on top of filling up drinks (water, coffee...etc).  No wait either on Saturday brunch.

Food - the reason why this is only a 3-star.  I've been to the old location for brunch a few times as well and somehow I feel like the food was prepped better there.  

First of all, the pastry basket.. I remembered at the old location, it's made to order (they tell you it may take a while as all freshly baked), although not mentioned on the current menu, I was expecting the same thing (my own fault).  The portion was generous (5 giant pieces of pastries, 2 cones, 1 plain croissant, 1 chocolate croissant and 1 almond croissant).  The texture were all just ok, and the biggest disappointment for me was it's not baked to order, in fact, not even warm.  They couldn't even try to make it nice to warm it up in the oven before presenting to you.  Everything was room temp. not what I was looking for in both the texture and temperature.  All too buttery (a good thing for some ppl I guess), but all quite dense vs. the crispy and flaky texture you'd want from croissants.  Anyhow, it's still all edible, just not what I had expected, especially it's so nice at the old place.

I wanted the salmon benedicts and they didn't have it, not out, just didn't have it.  If you plan the weekend brunch menu, salmon is not a hard thing at all to shop, why wouldn't you have it?  So i picked a ham one instead.  It's a mediocre benedict, not bad but nothing to raved about.  The microgreens they put on top are just a few sprinkles, almost too little to put on the plate.  

We had bendicts, pork hash (full order, just with too much potatoes), omelet and french toast.  Everything was ok, mediocre than higher exceptions you'd get from this place.  Maybe just a tab step up from your local cracked egg/egg works I regret to say, and only slightly better than them because of the decor of the space, the food is really not that much better.  

I'd probably still come back for lunch and dinner at some point, hope they'd be better than the brunch I had recently experienced.  But definitely won't be a place for me to return for weekend brunch anyone, for the price, it's just not worth it.",bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,1,0,3,nU74wYe9-gBmpMqcIdoDZg

Meeting up with a friend, we started with a few drinks.  In addition to the normal beers, wines and liquors, the bartending staff make some excellent cocktails.  Review the specials list and you won't be disappointed.  The strawberry mojoto was by far my favprite, and seemed to be the one ordered most frequently by the other patrons.

Light snacks helped fill the snacking void.  No cheese fries or mozzarella sticks.  Freshly made ceviche with homemade kettle chips, crispy brussels sprouts and shrimp skewers with a caribbean flair.

They have more meal options too, but was greatly satisfying for drinks and light fare.  So stop by, order a cocktail and some snacks and relax near a window looking out into the vastness of the LV desert.",2-IA-jVpiZIxC0gi8QQUpQ,0,0,4,e9n5iByRK89oOvqvUA0_qw

The sauce on the seasonal vegetable mix was also a turnoff; I felt all the flavors in this dish really clashed.  The mash of the day was also the victim of oversalting.  Yeah, not ordering this again.

Also, I was seated near the bathroom and there was a putrid smell in the air.  I don't want to think about what it was, but it was awful. They need to take care of that (other people remarked on it too while walking by).

My party of four walked in d w bistro around 12:30 hoping to indulge in the bottomless mimosas and a fulfilling brunch. We were quoted a 45 minute wait time & told by the host that we could start at the bar and as long as we had our glasses at the table they would refill them all day. The four of us retreated to the bar where we fought to get attention from the bartenders for a solid 15 minutes. Once we got the attention of a bartender we were told that they were no longer selling mimosas. Another guest commented that they heard the bar was out of glasses so we continued to wait for other tables with glasses to leave. We then tried reordering mimosas and were told that they were no longer selling them as it was after 1- even though a bartender had just given a new glass to a guest that he appeared to know.  We went back to the host stand to clear up the confusion as we had already been waiting for 30 minutes hoping to get a drink. The host then checked back with the bartenders who told her the same thing she had told us. No one apologized for our wait or the miscommunication so we left disappointed. This visit was particularly upsetting because I was visiting in town from LA and I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here because of the excellent yelp reviews.

I honestly can say I have never had a bad meal here!  Everything is gourmet, exciting, flavorful, and way above the average restaurant menu setting.  The chefs play with flavor and spices and everything comes together deliciously.  Bottomless mimosas are a must, but the Bloody Mary's spicy bite and fancy toppings of bacon, olives, and a pickle are a better choice for those who avoid champagne in the mornings.

The staff is fantastic, attentive, and so friendly!  They are always hosting fun party themed brunch hours and are really a joy to be around.

Went for dinner on Saturday night around 7:45 pm. We were worried the wait would be long as this place has always been very busy around this time . When we arrived only four tables were being used and no one the bar. Odd. 

We both ordered the fried chicken which is a favorite of ours. Food took quite a bit longer than expected to arrive but we didn't mind much about that. Besides noticing this plate no longer come with mashed potatoes the chicken was over cooked  and when cut into very large pieces of breaking would fall off.  Not at all worth $22.

1057567,2013-01-03,10,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"In short, DW Bistro is a fantastic brunch spot.  Here are the keywords/phrases to help you consider whether or not DW is for you: FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, JERK FRIED CHICKEN, and BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS.

There is always a warm greeting from the hostess and courteous attention from the wait staff. As busy as they get (and trust me, they can get busy--I wish they took reservations), they keep an eye on you (and your BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS).  

Even the customers at the bar are FRIENDLY. We met a regular named Randall. He was giving me drink suggestions while we waited for our table. People who frequent this place really care about it and want you to enjoy your experience.  And by the way, Randall was right about the Bloody Mary--it was a bit too spicy for me. I'm glad he asked he bartender to let me taste it first.  It was perfect for my Dad-in-law, so there was something for everyone. 

Of course I didn't need any help from Randall with ordering the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS. When people linger too long, I believe these drinks are often to blame. This is a place to gather and linger.  That adds to the energy of the place.  I can see how that lingering can be both a pro and a con. 

We've been coming to DW since they opened. Even from those first visits they were putting out a delicious, high-quality product. DW takes a Caribbean/Southwestern angle with their relatively traditional dishes.  I don't LOVE every dish. But I do enjoy them. Their unique take does lead to some less successful dishes for me. But I so appreciate the creativity and effort.  

They always have tasty off-menu specials. This trip we tried the JERK FRIED CHICKEN sandwich and it was divine. I have no idea why it is not a regular item on the menu. It was one of the most tender, flavorful chicken sandwiches I have ever had. My mother-in-law declared it was THE best she had ever had.

I started with a nice huckleberry cocktail that truly tasted of the fresh berry.  For my entree I was disappointed that the server informed me they were out of shortribs only after I ordered them.  Aargh!  I didn't have a backup selected and felt rushed since everyone else had already ordered.  I quickly chose the shrimp scampi when the server said he could have the kitchen add some jerk seasoning to the shrimp.  The dish I received was quite generous with a large mound of pasta and several, large perfectly cooked shrimp.  But the shrimp hadn't been seasoned and the pasta was a little bland.  I am used to my scampi having a nice garlic flavor that usually gives this dish bold characteristics.  Instead it was just plain shrimp and pasta tossed with olive oil.

This is a cute little place tucked up on the far southwestern side of Vegas. The DW, as I was told, stands for the first initials of the owners, D and W. I noticed it on a list of restaurants participating in Restaurant Week (a local charity event), and when I got a recommendation from one of my managers, it went on my list of places to try.

But when our crew got there and looked at the regular menu, the prix fix Restaurant Week menu went out the door as we looked at all the tasty brunch options. The eggs were tasty and unique. Scrambled eggs left sitting can get hard and un-delicious. Yes, I said un-delicious. But somehow, the eggs here were softer and tastier than other places. The toast is made from some kind of sweetened bread, and when you top it off with their apricot preserves, it's some kind of wonderful.

Elite Emily had the Jamaican Omlette, and Mama Elite had the New Mexico Pork Omlette. Both were mighty satisfied. Hector stuck with the prix fix Restaurant Week menu, which garnered him some crab cakes with eggs benedict, which looked good.

But here's the kicker: save room for dessert. You must have this carrot cake at DW Bistro. No, really. You must. You should actually go right after this review. Because God bless the person who first created this carrot cake. It uses the standard carrot cake ingredients, plus pineapple, macademia nuts, coconut, with a cream cheese frosting and liberally spotted with fresh berries. It's about the size of a house, so make sure you're sharing.

Holy god it's good. I'm pretty sure I made my O-face at some point.

The atmosphere is nice: it's a quiet bistro in a small spot. The staff was really friendly and attentive. I feel a strong ""family"" vibe, if you catch my drift.

It's kind of a ways away from me, but I would be totally open to coming back again. Might be a great setting for a date? Just sayin....",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,1,0,5,iH65vbfD6aqg_ABmt8jizg

My Bf & I wanted something other than Asian food for once and decided this place was it.. We got here around 3:20pm, and after perusing the menu realized it was still brunch time. SOOO everything we wanted to try wouldn't be available til 40 minutes later (dinner)! Needless to say, I was very sad.....

We ended up ordering the grilled chicken sandwich (served on brioche bun with lettuce, tomato, jalapeno bacon, & chipotle mayo) and the jerk fried chicken & waffles (with DW signature maple syrup + breast of chicken atop waffles). The sandwich was served with sweet potato fries...Mmmmmm mm good. Normally, neither of these things would really spark my interest, but we decided to give it a try anyway.. and I'm really glad we did! To my surprise, everything was full of unique flavor, and faaaaaar from bland. The waffles were fluffy and delish, and every chicken would be lucky to end up in a dish at DW bistro.

For dessert, we split the carrot cake. Carrot cake isn't something I normally order, but my Bf enjoys it.. so I had some. I thought it was pretty good (even though I wouldn't consider it to be my favorite type of cake) and asked if he would consider it ""good"" carrot cake.. I guess it was a redundant question as I found my answer in the resulting empty plate.

I also had the pomegranate iced tea -- I really enjoyed this as it was very light & refreshing, and not too sweet.

All in all-- I will be back for dinner. Hopefully very soon.",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,1,1,5,4Lh1D6Jeu6kMhuKSDOOwxw

Not knowing what I was getting into but was pleasantly surprised to find out they are Jamaican Mexican fusion! The wait was quite extensive, but I've heard amazing things and hoped the hour wait was worth it! Located in the Gramercy on the corner of 215 & Russell, I was thrilled it was on the southwest side and easily accessible as well! 

ORDERED: 
- CHICKEN FLAUTAS ($10.00): Lime crema, queso fresco, pico de gallo, avocado tomatillo sauce. (These were a decent appetizer, came with 5 pieces and had great presentation!)
- JAMAICAN CURRY BOWL ($15.00): Imported curry, coconut cream, seasonal vegetables, rice or couscous. (I personally am a curry snob, felt like this lacked flavor and did not have enough curry mixed in. Does not come with any meat; added chicken to it which costed an extra $5.00. Did not feel this justified $20.00 at all). 
- JERK PORK HASH ($16.00): Breakfast potatoes, eggs any style. (A little bland but surprisingly spicy for jerk flavor, came with a side of tortilla which was scarfed down to counteract the spiciness). 

Maybe ordered the wrong entrees, as I wasn't very impressed by the food.

It was packed, but it didn't feel like it was.  The staff was very friendly, and they had a musician playing little acoustic version of 80s and 90s hits.

Food-wise, it was excellent.  I had the Jerk Chicken and Waffles.  The waffles were a tad overcooked, but I didn't mind because they were delicious.  The chicken was thinly pounded, and covered with breadcrumbs and jerk seasoning.  Think of it like the chicken you would get with a Chicken Parmesan, not a giant mound of chicken like you normally get with Chicken and Waffles.  If I had one comment, I would have liked more heat (I love spicy food,) but it was great nonetheless.

My date had the Turkey Burger.  It came with Sweet Potato fried that I couldn't stop eating off of her plate.  This is the first time I had Sweet Potato fries that weren't overcooked and hard.  They were crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.

With all of this, we had Bloody Marys (it is brunch, afterall.)  They include olives stuffed with Habanero, and a piece of bacon.  I will now go back just for the Bloody Mary alone.

Price-wise, not too bad.  The giant plate of Jerk Chicken and Waffles was $14.  They could have charged $20 and I would have paid for it.

My first visit was less than impressive when it came to my dish.  For a classy restaurant like this, I expected much more.  I had a grilled shrimp salad and it was a single heart of romaine lettuce with 3 grilled shrimp that were cold and tasted like they were prepared the night before.  Not worth the $16!

I hesitated to return and would have likely given them 1 or 2 stars had I rated then.

Today's visit was inspired by my colleagues, who swear their food is always stellar.  I opted for a curry chicken bowl which was fantastic.  Very fresh vegetables and perfect balance of flavors with a little spicy kick.

1357626,2012-08-13,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"You've read myriad reviews about the inventive drinks, meals and deserts.  I completely agree with the raves.  

What I love about this place is the relaxed, no-rush attitude.  I'll be honest, if you are in a hurry to order, eat, pay and run, let them know as soon as you are seated.  You'll get a little more attention from your servers during weeknights.  The weekends and Sunday Brunch are usually a raucous, madhouse setting.  If you decide to join them for the party be prepared for bottomless ""All Day"" mimosas, a long wait to be seated and lots of time at your table.  Personally I love the fact that I can share a drink or two at the bar with friends and take our time without ever feeling rushed by staff trying to flip tables.

A few suggestions:

1.  Dine during the week for the most attentive service and less noise.
2.  The daily specials are always amazing.
3.  Specialty cocktails are worth a try.  Beware: some are very sweet and very strong.
4.  Feel free to bring a bottle of wine from your own cellar, they are very accommodating.  
5.  Remember, most of the flavors are bold and spicy.
6.  Sunday brunch is a time for friends and good times, be prepared for an event, not simply a meal.  Schedule accordingly.
7.  Come back regularly and bring your friends.

Good Eating!",76aSbT8EEVdon2DMLbEMcQ,1,0,5,nN10J3E6u8bbLTjUBeuTQg

 I love this place.  Just had lunch for the first time today and the decor is so pretty and super inviting.  The weather was great so we took advantage of the outdoor seating which I appreciated was under a covered patio.  I had to bring my 2 year old along for the lunch and wasn't sure how ""kid friendly"" this place would be.  I was pleasantly surprised they actually had highchairs and a changing table in the restroom ( didn't use but glad to see they offered).  The thing that stood out to me beyond the awesome atmosphere and food, they have great service!   My server, who I was bad and didn't catch his name, he could see my son's patience was being tested so he asked if he could bring him something, I said sure!  He brought my son some flashcards.  Such a simple thing, but kept my son happy for another 15-20 minutes until our food came.  Small gesture but means a lot to a mom!

For brunch:
Jamaican omelet- 
super delicious. made very well. 
Chocolate chip pancakes- 
I don't normally like CC pancakes, but these are so tasty and made with a fluffy yummy texture. 
Breakfast potatoes-
could be seasoned better but still delicious. 
In-house flavored iced tea...yummo!
I SHOULD have had: 
$20 bottomless mimosas! next time...

For lunch:
I had the vegetable curry. It was delicious and super veggie-fied. . . I would love to see more vegetarian/vegan options available on the menu. It was my choice to return here with my friend Helen after our hike and I felt like my options were severely limited and since I have an allergy to mushrooms sometimes I can't always have veggie burgers depending on their ingredients.

It was a generous portion but I don't know if it was the hot weather or not, I couldnt finish it! It was way too spicy for my taste buds & I like spicy. I had a Mimosa as well to quench my thirst. Didn't do the bottomless though. 

My boyfriend ordered the Jerk Chicken & Waffles, which he enjoyed for the most part. The waffles werent anything special and actually dry but paired with the chicken is delicious.

My friend ordered the BLT, which I didnt try but she says it's probably one of the best BLT's she's had in a while.

I give it a 3 because I wish there was more menu items to select from. One of the Yelpers here mentioned how the flavors of all their food is a little ""monotone"" or something like that, which I completely understand now that I've tried the place. I think every dish you could order could possibly taste the same? If that makes sense. 

The prices were so-so & the atmosphere was alright, couple flies here and there because the outdoor patio was connected to the inside dining area, The service was friendly though & the ambiance was welcoming.

The fusion of New Mexican with Caribbean flavors is really interesting to the palate.

Eatings:  The Jerk Chicken lollipops are a great starter.  I ordered the beer braised shortribs which came out super tender piled on top of  rosemary Mash potatoes.  The flavors were earthy and full so don't expect anything bland here even though each table has a plethora of hot sauces from the islands.  The misses ordered the Salmon which didn't taste fishy at all but full of flavor with the guava berre blanc sauce served over a bed of rice.
 We also went for brunch one Sunday and our favorite was the New Mexican-style slow cooked pork omelet. Blasted with flavor! The Jerk pork hash was highly recommended but i did not enjoy that one as much.  
Dessert was excellent. The carrot cake was decadent and did not taste like carrot cake! If you hate carrot cake which my girlfriend does, you'll still enjoy this! Sweet and  delicious perfect meal finisher. 

Imbibe: The wine list is decent but we enjoyed the Pavi pinot grigio! well paired with the full flavor food offerings.  I saw a bunch of people order the Jamaican Mojito and on Sunday brunch the bloody mary's were almost on every table but we decided to go with mimosa's.  Must trust those two on the next visit.

Ambiance: For dinner I fell it was too bright.  They should dim the lights a bit since most of the decor is a bright orange. On the flip side the ambiance is perfect for Sunday brunch! The servers were super friendly and the manager checked in on us 3 times! Very nice staff and attentive. 

Overall: We enjoyed the flavors and our food was cooked perfectly.  The wait can be a bit long BUT they told us 25 min wait...yea we were sat in 5 minutes..Over estimate much? it's a good thing.

1409226,2015-07-19,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Great food! Great service! Wine Starts at $52 a bottle, $13 a glass!

We were looking for a great afternoon, late lunch restaurant with a patio where we could bring our dog.  We had always wanted to try DW Bistro. We called and were told the patio was open and Yes!, our dog was welcome. We were happy and headed right out. The hostess was charming and our server was very nice and full of great information about all the things DW had to offer.  He brought us a beautiful little basket of tasty breads with the menus.  We were hungry and dove right into the menus.... and the bread! 

First, to the wine menu!  We were looking for our normal bottle of under $40 Cabernet or Zinfandel. Normally most every restaurant we normally visit will have a few offerings in our price range - but not here.  A bottle of the least expensive wine was $52!   We do like our wine and we do appreciate a good wine. We are Trader Joe's and Lee's regulars and we know of many very tasty under $10 bottles... that we can usually find in most restaurants for the regular 300-400+% markup,...and... we do not necessarily appreciate what others consider to be GREAT wine... which I guess is our only choice at DW.  

We just do not buy $52 bottles of wine... Our nose and taste for wine is just not that, how you say? ""educated""?

This is a deal breaker for us.  We always buy at least one bottle of wine at dinner, but today we settled for a $13 glass of house Cabernet for each of us.  I will admit the house Cab was delicious. but I think outside of the strip hotels this is the most we have ever paid for individual glass of wine. (yeah, ok so we run with a low end crowd,,, what can I say)

That told, the food was delicious!  Everything... the appetizers and the main courses. We didn't have any deserts but they all sound wonderful and I am sure they are. This only made us more disappointed in the wine selection.

It sounds like the brunches might be the best thing to hit.

1409408,2014-03-20,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I could almost call this a nice gem, in the suburbs. I came here for lunch, on a Wednesday afternoon, with a friend. Prior to coming here, I had read some reviews saying how they sometimes get so packed, that even at 1pm, there is a fairly long wait. Upon arrival, i was actually getting a little scared considering i had to park on the south end of the parking lot and walk over. 

LUCKILY ! Nope, no wait time XD super lucky i was told by my friend. I called her my lucky charm :P haha 

Decor is very different. ""Clean"" and bright, yet simple. Bright colors with live vegetation (live flowers and containers filled with fruit) and decor. Different lighting and textures. It was quite nice on the eyes. Really different from what you'd usually see in a traditional restaurant. 

This restaurant is based on the traditional Jamaican/Caribbean flavors with New Mexican cuisine. I don't know much about New Mexican cuisine but what i remembered of Caribbean is their huge use of spice (flavors) and SPICE (HEAT!) 

A lot of reviews had talked about like the New Mexican Style slow-cooked pork, or chicken and waffles (not traditional chicken but JERK chicken!), or other things. 

We were seated in the side room (to the right upon entry). 

Super nice waitress and briefly described how their items are on the spicier side but can be changed, if preferred. HECK NO!  bring it on spice XD ! haha

My friend and I ordered two things, and shared off each other's plates. She had ordered the New Mexican Style slow-cooked pork, whereas I had ordered the Jamaican curry chicken. 

I was actually amazed by the portion size. I am not a small eater, i couldn't even finish half. Ended up having to box up BOTH orders because BOTH were only half eaten. AND we shared ! LOL 

BOTH were served in a bowl (obviously since it was under the ""DW House Bowls"" section) but the best thing... BOTH WERE PIPING HOT ! YES ! 

New Mexican-style slow cooked pork (simmered in New Mexican red chile with two over-easy eggs served over rice) - $12

VERY heavy and hearty dish. Comes with two? three? small tortillas on the side. This is how i described it to my friend. ""It is a dish where is good on a nice cold night, sitting next to a fire, with a book"". Heavy and hearty to keep you warm through the cold night. Good idea right? Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs on top, spilling its rich ooey gooey goodness over the slow-cooked simmered pork in red chile. Spice level, mild? There IS a bit of spice in it. Would prefer a bit more but it wasn't bad as it was. The meat was tender and pulled apart fairly easily. The included small tortillas allow you to make these small burrito wraps yourself. Another thing i told my friend... ""if only we had some like corn salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese.. this would be a YUMMY burrito !"" haha =X 

Jamaican curry chicken (sauteed seasonal vegetables; served over rice or couscous) - $12 

In comparison to the slow cooked pork dish, this dish is light and bright. Light curry flavor, with little to no spice, but refreshing from the sauteed seasonal veggies that give it a bright flavor amongst the curry taste. It's a pretty good combination. Veggies were like cubed zucchini, green beans, two different types of mushrooms, etc  The chicken is a little overcooked, so a little tough (considering it was white meat as well). Still pretty good though. I later regretted asking for rice over couscous. I wonder how it would have been with couscous. Very curious now. 

Overall. Pretty good experience. $12 for a bowl i cant even finish? Pretty good ! Flavors are good. Would like to try other things next time. 

Little additional uhm... thing.. haha (lack of vocab coming to my head at the moment)... the boxes they give you to pack leftovers... THEY ARE STURDY AND MICROWAVABLE ! (super chinese but most likely reusable) XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,MbDBTbbxRyOCu0tsZOewdQ

Walking in, this place was right up my alley. I loved the decor and just sitting in the restaurant made me happy. I ordered a bloody mary, which I was told was spicy and I love spicy so I was all in. It was a beautiful bloody mary and the jalapeno bacon was a nice touch. However, that bloody mary was spppiiccccyyy. Like something was wrong with it because I have never had a bloody mary that was spicy enough. It may have even ruined my taste buds because my chicken and waffles were just average and everyone on yelp raves about it! I had to have our server bring me some more tomato juice it was so spicy.

I ordered the jerk chicken in waffles. I love Jamaican jerk sauce and was disappointed when the chicken was not saucy, but just spiced with Jamaican jerk spices. The chicken was so-so and the waffle was a waffle, but I could tell the syrup was homemade and it was great. It was a huge portion too. 

My husband got an omelet with filet tips which he thought was really good. I didn't try it though. All in all, it was just ok but we managed to rack up a bill of close to $60 just for breakfast.

Hmm we ordered the calamari for appetizer and that was a success it was different than any calamari I've had at other restaurants and there was a nice kick to it (if you like spicy food). My fiance ordered the slow cooked pork, it came with a bed of rice and vegetables and this order was horrible. It looked more like vegetable and rice bowl, she could not find a piece of pork and the flavor was lacking. We had high hopes with this entree just because the calamari had such strong flavor, but disappointing. I ordered the fried chicken and was excited to try it with the jerk flavoring. It's really hard to mess up fried chicken but I was not happy with this order. We ended up trading entrees because my fiance hated what she got. I gave this place 3 stars because of the drinks we ordered. Those were BOMB we ordered 2 glasses of riesling and  2 jamaican mojitos! This is the only reason why I would come back.

Fish Special of the Day - a bit dry, but the mango salsa on it was really tasty and helped a bit with the dryness I guess....

Lamb was a little under cooked for a medium rare... will update if I get sick later because I ate it anyways. haha

The short ribs were delicious, reminded me of a ropa vieja, just falls apart... :)

Side of fried Chicken was actually perfectly cooked and really tender and juicy for a breast.  Usually the breast is drier. This was probably my favorite of all the dishes I tried tonight... too bad it was a side.

Been to this place about a year ago and loved it!!! Would have been 4 stars back then. Had the jamaican curry chicken, flautas, carrot cake and chocolate cake.

Also need to mention that it can get a little loud because of the way the dining area is laid out, but I like a little noise, so it's all good with me.  Just had to mention it because my father-in-law was saying that there were bad acoustics.  =D  All in all a decent place for dinner.... 


Update:  my father-in-law and I did have upset tummies the next morning..... maybe it was the 2 glasses of wine I had before bed?? normally I can do a bottle and be okay so.... thought it should be mentioned. that's all.",ZUShG75J0pkHhSNoU_4LGg,0,0,3,Nc_hk8BKfgZ4CWaqSAL0qA

First let me say that there were 12 of us. We didn't not have a reservation, it's first come first serve. We got seated right away with no wait time. For bunch they offer specials and bottomless bloody Mary's or mimosas. I had to work or I would have been down for the mimosas. I ordered one of the specials, a twist on eggs Benedict. Instead of muffins they had spicy potato patties. To drink I ordered a cappuccino, and let me say it was almost as good as the ones I had in Europe. My food came out hot and looking great. There was so much on the plate. My first bite was so good, I did not want to put my fork down, but I did ( at least a few times to say how good my food really was). Looking around the table the eggs Benedict must ave been really yummy sounding because 6 of the 12 people ordered it. 

Our waited did a fantastic job in getting overtones order correct and keeping our water and mimosa glasses full. He was very attentive to our group and also his 4 other tables.

 The Boy had the bacon green chile cheeseburger..Great!

The GF had the jerk chicken breast. The jerk was jerky but didn't leave you wanting to gulp down your drink after.

I had the special of the evening that consisted of  seafood curry with coconut rice....AWESOME!

We shared the mac & cheese with mushrooms and bacon.  A tasty heart stopper but I did not give a damn.

I absolutely recommend the pastry basket which included delicious filled flaky turnovers with goat cheese and guava paste accompanied by banana muffins and scones.

1597359,2013-04-06,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"DW Bistro: *heart* (since I can't use a heart emoticon on Yelp, apparently) 

Totally unassuming in a little strip mall on Fort Apache. The space is a breath of fresh air in Vegas - modern, fun, bright, pretty. Lots of white and orange (think creamsicle-chic!) with cute three dimensional star pendant lights hanging above the bar and green pops from the potted plants scattered throughout. The restaurant is fairly small, with a comfortable little patio which is a good place to enjoy the weather when it is pleasant. 

Their menu is a mix of jamaican and new mexican cuisine, which seems like a strange combo but surprisingly, the flavors work together to create all sorts of yumminess in my tummy, so I'm a happy camper!

Favorite dishes - Jerk Chicken Drumette Appetizer (LOTS of flavor with some definite heat) and the Pesto Torte Appetizer, which is perfect to share - goat cheese with nuts and flatbread crackers. Entree - The Fried Chicken!! I tried a few other things prior to finding this gem on the menu - fish, short ribs, etc - and although they were good, the Fried Chicken is what keeps me coming back. The Chicken has a bit of jerk seasoning to it for some spice, the skin is crispy, the chicken is moist, and it is served with the most delicious, melt in your mouth yet unbelievably dense cornbread ever. There is also a petite pitcher of jerk gravy that you can dunk/smother/drink your meal with. 

DESSERT (always the most important part) - they have a cake tasting. Yes, a cake tasting. These are not tiny bite sized pieces of cake - no - they are relatively normal sized slices of their Carrot Cake, Red Velvet Cake, and Chocolate Cake. They are all amazing. Don't get just one type of cake and say ""I'll try the Red Velvet next time""... go get the cake tasting and eat it all. You can share it if you want, but I don't. It's amazing and it should be a rule that all restaurants offer cake tastings. 

Lastly, service is usually quite good, particularly for an off-strip place. The greatest thing is that the restaurant owners are pretty much always around in the restaurant. They stop by the tables to say hello and chat and overall just make you feel incredibly welcome - as though you're a guest in their home. 

Pricing is not inexpensive, but is definitely appropriate and even a bit of a steal considering the quality of food, service, and atmosphere.

First, the service.  When we first entered, we were greeted and seated pretty quick.  The staff was very friendly.  But, our waittress wasn't so great.  Although she was friendly, she only came to our table twice.  When we needed something, such as a refill or for the check, she would take forever!  The bistro wasn't even that busy at the time!  After waiting 20 minutes for the check, I looked for her and saw that she was talking to another waiter in the corner.  I couldn't believe it. 

Also, the food was bordering on bland.  I got the Caribbean Jerk chicken and waffles.  My father got this dish that consisted of slow-cooked pork with rice, cooked in a Spanish-style.  At the first taste, the food was amazing!  Everything was hot and beautifully presented.  The Caribbean Jerk chicken and waffles was a refreshing and interesting take on the dish.  The chicken and the homemade maple syrup was flavorful.  However, the rice dish had no taste and the waffles tasted like stale bread.  Really thick, stale bread.

Pomegranate Ice Tea - refreshing and delicious,  My server (I hate I can't remember his name - sorry!) even gave me a to-go cup which I happily sipped while driving.

Fried Jerk Chicken and Waffles - the chicken, oh the chicken.  Chicken breast was moist and fried to perfection.  The breading was flour with the jerk seasoning.  The waffles were light and airy and crisp around the edges. So good. So-so good.

Breakfast Potatoes - cubed red potatoes with yellow and red peppers and onions.  And the spices were just right.  They were spicy, but it didn't linger, you know what I mean?  Like the potatoes were not spicy just to be spicy, they had flavor.

We started over at the bar- of course. $20 bottomless mimosas, and several other cocktails that made it hard to choose; we had the Raspberry Fizz and the Mojito with muddled strawberries- both were delicious but they tasted very similar. 

Boyfriend had the special ""steak and eggs""- 2 medallions of filet, eggs, potatoes, and sourdough toast. It was delicious but the toast was lacking that strong distinguishing sourdough taste that I crave. I had the Jerk Pork Hash which was a HUGE mound of delicious shredded pork on a small bed of potatoes.. It's still in my fridge, waiting for me to toast it up in a quesadilla- the bill for the 2 of us came out to around $80 but I felt that it was a good value since $24 went to the bar.

We had a really good time there; the service was adequate, the menu had lots of different choices, the bar staff was friendly and efficient, but most importantly the company was top notch. Bring a group of friends and family and you're sure to have a positive experience. They managed our large group of 15-20 well, only a few hiccups- GET THERE EARLY if you have a large party or else you'll be waiting forever.

Their ""from the grill"" section averaged at about $25 per plate... I just ate a fine dining restaurant on the strip and my entree that absolutely blew me away was $32... so the price at this restaurant threw me off a bit. Simple salad averaged at about $15 here.. You get the point. It was pricey for an off strip restaurant in the middle of a strip mall.

I opted for the Jamaican curry chicken bowl with couscous ($14). The portion was huge, the veggies fresh, and the curry was adequate; there really wasn't much kick to it. I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper to my left overs which made it more delicious and less bland. Now, they could have EASILY made the portion half of what it was and had lower price points (this is especially applicable to the higher priced items on the menu). This would affect the marginal willingness to pay of the consumer. But, I digress. 
Boyfriend had Jerk Chicken Scampi over Linguine ($16), and that was very delicious..but once again the portion was quite large.

Our server was great, friendly, and accommodating throughout. They brought us a complimentary slice of their carrot cake, and it was amazing. The gesture was also well appreciated.  I would probably try them for lunch or breakfast again, but this would not be my choice for dinner.

My suggestion would be to reconsider the portion sizes, and price accordingly. But, something tells me that most of their revenue is generated during brunch/lunch, and dinner is an afterthought, therefore this business model works for them.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,7,4,3,jbDP7lEXSEbtOxs-CVWnuQ

Nice modern and bright decor with a great and energetic environment.

Ordered the calamari.. Nice and crispy with that jerk seasoning. Great flavor,

Got the curry bowl and had them add a grilled salmon on top. Perfectly cooked salmon; all the veggies meshed together very well.

I'm a big fan of any restaurant that seems super high end but all walks of life are extremely welcome. A big plus is the chef will make custom dishes come to reality.. Michelin quality food without the ""be on your best behavior"" vibe.

One time I went with a group of 8 and we shared and I can't say any item stood out to me as something I want to try again. I ordered the New Mexico pork chili bowl and I didn't enjoy it. I found it bland with no spice. Surprised that people rage about it.  I'm not a fan of their jerk chicken so avoid anything with jerk chicken. I usually stick to the Cobb salad or curry bowl after trying too many disappointing meals. 

Yesterday I had their curry chicken bowl with couscous which was always my go to favorite meal to order and it was curry soup! The flavor was also off. I'm not sure why it was so watery but I don't remember it ever being that soupy. 

Lunch crowd gets very busy on a week day which was surprising due to their location.

It's funny I continue to come back but it's usually friends or coworkers that bring me back but I think next time I'm going to suggest somewhere else!",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,2,0,2,xQwuK40nSUrUoFu5jH13Nw

All lovely presentations, by a very friendly server. The food was gourmet, fresh and oh so flavorful. I was told the brunch is wonderful too. For me, it was a bit pricey for work day lunch ($14 -$15), I like to stick under ($10) per day, but for a special occasion most fitting. I also have to say that both the food selections and decor swing a bit to the feminine, my husband (not a metro man) may not have been as impressed by the experience.

No seriously I'm so in love with the DW. 

Sunday Brunch on fleek. 

Can't they just do Sunday brunch every day of the week though? Not all of us get to be off on the weekends you know?...I digress. 

This is day drinking at its finest!!! With bottomless mimosas flowing at a rate similar to that of your favorite drag brunch (which means your cup is never left empty).  The food is innovative, fun, and perfectly portioned to keep you happy. The DJ spinning the most fabulous day party music to get you pumped up for your fabulous day off ahead of you...I can't even say enough good things about how much I like this atmosphere. 

I was told I just HAD to try the chocolate croissant, which was baked in house. And I was not disappointed. Fluffy and somehow dense at the same time. I decided to balance out the carbs I just had with some omega 3s and get the salmon Benedict. ''Twas amazing. The sauce was spicy and creamy perfect pairing to the salmon and spinach and perfectly cooked egg. 

I also tried the mule. It was suuuper tasty and I can't wait to join them for their new happy hour starting at 6 on the weeknights so I can try more signature cocktails!!!",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,3,1,5,EM9R8DwX3KksbVY9VcH_2A

The first impression was that the restaurant is clean.
The food is made to perfection when it comes to taste and presentation. For starters we had jerk fried calamari- it had a little bit of a kick to it but the sweet glaze reached our taste buds right after the spiciness did. For me, who is very sensitive to spice, this was the perfect dish.
I also got the raspberry fizz drink, which was made with fresh raspberries. The drink was fresh and did not have that overpowering sweetness that cocktails usually have.
Also, their desert is a must have. Their red velvet cake made our mouths water as soon as it came out. The texture was moist and it had the prefect amount of sweetness. It was also very light so we had no problem finishing the whole piece.",KnKv_9yEE4pTn7M_CrawHw,0,0,5,AJbOfFXja8_icLsWhjK8bg

1757321,2015-06-13,5,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"First impressions: the interior reminds me of somewhere a desert cult might hang out to recruit rich members, in a good way. The mostly-white interior with orange accents, lots of windows and light, and small decorative touches like hanging lamps and rustic patio seating all come together in a really nice way. 

BEST OPTIONS
Spanish chorizo with shrimp (app)- incredible, the sauce was similar to a curry and the shrimp were perfect. I'd pay double for an entrée-sized portion and be happy with just that. Fun mix of bread options for dipping.
Green chile cheeseburger- Perfectly cooked to medium, massive portion, good variety of flavors. The jalapeno pepper bacon makes this dish. Side it with the salad, which has a light dressing, walnuts, and goat cheese. Sweet potato fries are for suckers.
New Mexico Spicy Pork Bowl- the most disappointing of the ""good"" dishes. I'd get it for the great value ($14 for a 2 pound bowl that will last you three more meals) and because the spices remind me of a dish my mom used to make with brisket... but it doesn't actually have much flavor. Eggs weren't cooked properly (one under, one over) and they don't actually go with the other ingredients. Hearty and comforting but underwhelming.

SKIP THESE
Chicken Flautas- these were accidentally brought to our table, then comped, but tasted like they were out of a box in the frozen section. Not particularly crispy or flavorful, but plated in a fun way. Not a fan of the filling.
Jerk Shrimp Salad- the shrimp is blackened to greatness, but the salad itself fell flat. Dressing was bland and didn't tie the elements together. Ate less than half.
DW Bloody Mary- $12 glass, split among our table of 3, still didn't finish it. The drink is 1/3 garnishes (love that jalapeno bacon!) and the beverage itself is nicely spicy, but it wasn't great and we agreed we wouldn't get it again.

Service was professional. Most other parties appeared to be drinking heavily during their visit, so this is probably best experienced as a brunch place. Not sure if Id return without someone else suggesting it.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,9,3,0t40ruVxBF1DgyJ4018x6w

So Maria, Vanessa and Anthony got drinks and Vanessa ordered her jerk flavored calamari.  I did taste it but I did not like it at all.  There was a lot of breading and the seasoning overpowered the calamari.  

The atmosphere is very cool and modern though and everyone seems to be in a party mood.  Speaking of which, there was another table full of Yelpers next to us celebrating a birthday.

The place is beautiful and the vibe was incredible. So many large groups, several of them celebrating a friend's birthday. It was a little noisy for me, but so vibrant that I did not care.
I order the Eggs Benedict and my husband the chicken and waffles. I love Eggs Benedict so I try them every time I have a chance and I have to say these are now in my top 5! The eggs were perfect, the hollandaise sauce had a spicy (I believe Jamaican) twist that was simply unbelievable. I tried my husband food and both the chicken and the waffle were delicious, even though the chicken was too spicy for me. He loved it, but he prefers this dish to have southern flavor instead of Jamaican.
Coffee was really good. I had a Cappuccino. My only complaint will be if they could include different type of milks for coffee, such as lactose free or almond milk. 
I also had a mimosa. They offer 2 options: a glass for $12 or all you can drink for $22. Good options to pick from.
I saw many people ordering the bloody mary. It looked spectacular with bacon flowing out of the glass.

The ambiance is both inviting and modern. From the moment you walk in we were greeted by a DJ playing theTop 40 hits. As we danced to our seats our waiter dressed in a costume offered our entire table complimentary Bloody Mary shots. First met me say that i am not a fan of Bloody Mary drinks but this shot was so tasty and savor that i was surprised to finish it! Immediately we were asked for our drink orders. 

Although i didn't drink and stuck with an unsweetened ice tea my friends ordered the Bloody Mary and the Jamaican mojito and they raced at how gold their drinks were. Service was phenomenal! Not much longer we were submitting our orders to the waiter. If you haven't taken a look at the menu, please do. You will simply be overwhelmed. EVERYTHING sounds so good. I had a very difficult time choosing an entree. I love a good turkey burger but i was reluctant to order their turkey burger when there were so many other entrees and i could have a turkey burger any where. I ended up sticking with my first instinct and ordering the turkey burger and i do not regret it! Their turkey burger i would rate as a 10... there is nothing basic about it. Although my server warned me that it was spicy i still ordered it because i have a high tolerance (btw it's more sweet than spicy... has a little kick). The mango, pear, apple chutney that went on top was delicious, so was the side salad that accompanied it. 

My husband couldn't decide what to order so he ordered two meals lol. He got the jerk chicken and waffles which were AMAZING! The perfect balance of sweet and spicy. This is definitely our new go to spot when we visit Vegas!!!",uvTLWhlP3lPOGts5rziQ2w,0,0,5,Ha9Y1YPwJh-KCEp0CBji6w

It was very busy and everyone looked like they were having a good time. When the bartender got to us we ordered two mimosas, he asked if we wanted bottomless but we declined since we only planned on having one each. When we got our bill for them it was $43. I knew he charged me for bottomless. He was super friendly and when I reminded him we didn't want bottomless he explained it was cheaper if we got more. I told him we didn't want more then one each and he voided the one bill and charged me for the two mimosas which was $25... for the size their not worth $12 each. 

We got seated and had good service the only thing I thought was odd was the server comes over and he just started telling us the specials (he was talking so fast I don't even know what the specials were) he didn't even start by welcoming us or telling us his name. He was nice but it was very odd. He seemed very rushed which is something that always bothered me when we're out to eat. 

I got the BLT, I'll definitely try something else next time it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be but everyone else's food smelled, looked and tasted amazing. Food price was reasonable for the portions. 

When we got home I checked my bank account and since the bartender swiped my card for the bottomless mimosas and ""voided"" it I am stuck with that $43 charge and the $25 until the void transaction drops which really sucks. That's almost $70 for a mistake that he could have avoided if he had listen to us. (Takes about 4-5 business days for voided transactions to become available again)

They also don't check in on you very often to see how things are going. 

Overall, decent place for brunch/lunch but I would probably avoid coming during busy hours.",Csuup4PJ0XVD-tpD7MoGdg,1,0,3,pv1q2yHCgHGLeLYCNleU5w

 If you get him, you might as well go home right there bec you are about to throw money out the window !!!
We order Bottomless Mimosa's which seemed to be very popular in the rest.  They were $20.00 a person and we figured this would be fun and pretty cost effective... LOL  Boy were we wrong.  They were super hot, prob bec they were serving so many... and it worked out pretty damn good for them bec the Champagne they used was CHEAP ! With a capital C baby !!!  
We finished one and we sat looking around for our slackass waiter Marco... UGH ! We finally got a refill and we ordered...  the Chicken Flautas for appetizer , they were ok, nothing special and a little spicy . Once we got those, I decided not to break bad with $20 for an entree bec I could see that we were going downhill at a fast pace.  My girl ordered Chicken and waffles... The plate came and the chicken was so overcooked.. It was damn near black ! It was dry and not great, we will say.  
By this time, we are waiting for another Mimosa.. Waiting, Waiting and Waiting.  We get another hot glass of cheap champagne.. exciting !! By this time, the place is clearing out ! I see a cute lil black gay come in and then I realize that he is walking around the rest. in pedicure shoes, yes that is right yellow pedicure shoes with painted black toenails.  CLASSY !! He starts seating people in these ridiculous paper shoes lol.
So we ask Marco for another drink bec this is about how we have to manage his ass.. What a joke.  He says "" we arent serving those anymore""    WTF????  What did he just say ??  Yes we arent serving those anymore... EXCUSE ME ??? Im sorry but bottomless is bottomless, you serve them until we get our asses out of our seats and leave... It was the icing on the cake for me !!!

1866024,2014-02-12,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Short review: DW Bistro is amazing. If you enjoy food, you can't go wrong here. Don't miss out.

Longer review: This is one of only two restaurants in Las Vegas that I can honestly say I love every item on the menu. From the Jerk chicken and waffles on the weekend to the DW Turkey Burger for lunch, everything is delicious. The specialty drinks are wonderful as well, many of (if not all of them) are hand crafted and taste great. Although be sure to pace yourself, even if you can't taste it, there's quite a bit of alcohol in some of the drinks.

The ambiance is great, it's a very trendy restaurant and the people who frequent it are very hip as well. The service is always done with a smile and it seems like the employees truly love working here. Many times I've had full on conversations with the bartenders during my lunch.

If there's anything negative to say, it's realizing I won't be able to cook anything nearly as good as some of the items I've had here. There's also a bit of a wait during the evenings, but it's pretty much worth it.

DW Bistro is amazing. If you are on the west end of town, make sure to drop in. You won't regret it.",1v1ykNzRtPIJzQSqFt79mg,1,0,5,cUwSZD1yv2Rcy3hoJTbjsQ

Knowing how crazy Brunch can be (DW does not accept reservations on Sunday Brunch) we went around 11am to eat. This turned out to be a perfect time because all the 10am ""Brunchers"" were on their way out, so we did not have to wait for a table. 

Shout out to our waiter Nick, who made our experience amazing. He was very attentive and gave great suggestions.  I will not comment on the food, because its pretty amazing! and you can read everyone else's reviews.

Nick explained all the sauces on the table, as well as sent us complimentry Carrot Cake for dessert. We were stuffed! but not complaining of course!  

Tip: If you're on a budget, ask how much the specials are before you order. My boyfriend ended up getting the special filet breakfast burrito but we did not realize how much it cost until we got the bill. Overall, the experience is great!

We had the shrimp appetizer (which I would totally eat as an entree) and  the daily special - chipotle chicken wrap and the mexican chicken enchiladas. Delicious!
To end our perfect meal was the lemon pudding for dessert. There couldn't have been any better way to cleanse our palette with this sweet and tart explosion of flavor in a cup!

On Saturdays and Sundays the Mimosa which are always yummy and pretty topped with fruits or Bloody Mary with Bacon are always pouring.

It's very modern looking inside the restaurant and has a very fun vibe to it. The wait staff is very attentive and knowledgable. So looking at the menu, they have a very unique list of dishes. The first visit I ordered the New Mexican green chili cheese burger. Now when it comes to any type of chili, ESPECIALLY New Mexican chili I am super picky. All my family is from Albuquerque, and my grandfather actually grows his own red and green chili, so I know authentic New Mexican chili. DW Bistro did not disappoint and had the real deal. I was in heaven! Getting to eat good green chili is something I look forward everytime I go visit my family, and now I have a place to go to while I'm not over there. I ordered my burger rare because most places over cook their meat. DW on the other hand made it true rare, which not to their fault, was a little too rare lol. The burger was nothing short of amazing though. 
I've also tried their flautas, enchiladas (special of the day at the time), and the Jamacian chicken curry on couscous. 
Now let's talk drinks. I'm not a fan of bloody marys, but due to the fact that they add two strips of bacon and a whole pickle as garnishment, I might order it next time. I usually stick to the Jamacian mojito, and boy do they make it strong. They also have a wide assortment of beers from the Caribbean. 
I keep hearing about their brunch on Sundays, but going anytime is a good time. My only negative comment about this place is the ginger candy they give you with the bill. Yuck! Lol",ro8lGoWMsa49B3tWLaWwSA,1,0,5,e0y7LKUGwUDSxsJJNU14Jg

Finally got a table and sat down. I love the menu, the food all sounds so good, but finally settled on the DW Nicoise salad. My date had the Jamaican curry chicken.

I loved my salad, the dressing was divine! I really liked the tuna, but the server never asked me how I wanted it cooked so it came out rare, which I never eat. It was okay, but I would have MUCH preferred medium rare. I dislike hesitating before every bite because I don't care for the rare taste. It wasn't bad, but I could have enjoyed it more had it been cooked a tiny bit longer. The fingerling potatoes were really, really small too. That's too bad, because I really love those. The salad was great, but it really needed those two things to be an excellent salad (bigger potatoes, tuna cooked longer). 

My date had the curry chicken bowl and it also had a choice of couscous or rice and he didn't get offered that either, they just brought it out with rice. He would have liked it better with the couscous. As it was he barely touched it. 

The service is great as far as refills, etc. But they fall a little short on the actual customer service and what they really want. I don't like to have people assume about what I'll eat.

The inside feels similar to Vintner Grill (for those that are familiar) and they have a patio (nothing like Vintner Grill).  Our party of 4 decided to sit outside (although, they would not seat us until all of us were there).

The drink menu is pretty large and it took us a few minutes to decide on what we wanted.  They have infused vodka, which is usually exactly what I want, but I chose a Riesling.  One ordered a beer, one a lemonade and one a mojito.

While it took us some time to decide on what we wanted- everything sounded unique and delicious and after about 10 minutes, we finally ordered.

1. DW fried chicken ($19): dusted with jerk seasoned flour; served with homemade cornbread & jerk cream gravy
-husband ordered this; said it was good, but didn't love it and so he wouldn't order it again.

2. New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork ($17): simmered in NM red chile; with over-easy eggs; served over rice
-I ordered this and LOVED IT!  I recently have found a love of slow-cooked spicy pork and this was exactly it!  Their bowl is HUGE!  Great flavors and the over-easy egg with the runny yolk just added a velvety flavor (that is making my stomach growl just thinking about it!)  I was able to take most of it home for the next day and it tasted delicious the next day!

3. Chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta ($15): served with sautéed garlic, pancetta,shallots and seasonal vegetables.
-Friend ordered this one.  Good, but lots of food!

4. DW signature salad ($9): baby field greens, caramelized pecans, orange segments, seasonal bell peppers,topped with goat cheese and served with balsamic vinaigrette
-Friend ordered this one; Good, typical salad.

They come out with a huge bread tray that you can pick whichever kind you want and however many you want!

I got the couscous salad - sounds as exciting as a gym sock, right?  NOPE.  Again, the flavor combos were brilliant - couscous, jerk seasoned tuna, goat cheese, chile oil and possibly a little black magic.

1. Lun Chorizo Shrimp
2. DW Bowl special - fish
3. Sandwich special - shrimp
All ok in taste, minimal in portions.
The 1* is for the following reasons:
- The server was a clueless girl who did not know anything about the menu items or the chef's specials. We specifically told her ""no beef or pork"", yet she didn't mention item #1 above has pork sausages. We found out too late (after taking a bite).
- She didn't know whether the fish in the bowl special would be a fillet or whole fish. Didn't bother to check with the chef.
- 5 min after placing the order, the server comes back to mention she forgot to ask us 'salad or sweet potato fries' for the side. Didn't matter what we chose coz' we never received it.",ZZ2Vady-Lt-32lIIOdkcMg,0,0,1,ZufXnioNs2jHUl54I7oYig

Normally, I do a little research on a restaurant so I know what I'm about to get myself into; but, this selection was totally spontaneous.  I didn't quite feel like going home just yet, so I drove across town to try Jamaican/Caribbean food.  To my surprise, it was unlike this spot in Downtown Atlanta I frequented, this had a very pleasant upscale taste and feel.

2068711,2012-01-18,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"This place is bound to be my first Yelp! review because in my mind, it stands above the rest of the restaurants in the valley. It provides an ever-changing super creative menu, FILLING portions,  a variety of fresh-baked breads, homemade fruit-laced cocktails, and some of the best cake I have ever seen or eaten. 

Having dined here three times now, with something different every time, I am blown away by the originality. 

Dishes i've tried include:

 the Jerk Chicken Scampi over angel hair which is phenomenal and completely different. The classic white wine and garlic dish meets with hints of jerk flavor and unexpected spices that I never imagined in a pasta dish. 

The Jerk Ahi with mixed greens was simple and filling, excellent light fruit notes to contrast with the saltier jerk spices and tender greens. 

The fried chicken could be the best I have ever had with a unique savory-sweet gravy, and an unforgettable honey-crusted cornbread. 

The Carne Adovado (new mexican pork shoulder roast), which my chef friend from Albuquerque ordered, could not be more authentic. The pork just fell right off the bone and dove into the rich mole sauce. 

Appetizers such as the Pesto Torte and Chorizo & Shrimp dip-thang don't fly under the radar either. Bold flavors that you won't want the server to take away, even after the entree comes. 

...and of course, the dessert (if you can make it) might just knock you out of your chair. DO NOT skip the carrot cake. 

Beyond all of those great things that I had to say; service is excellent, the portions are more than substantial, the prices are extremely fair, and the decor is modern and clean. 

Check it out.

P.S. Dont forget the carrot cake and pretzel bread. Mmmmm.",-y-NREsdr_rUnfN7Eztywg,2,1,5,RGFiOpYjnomPRChM-NGQRQ

We started with the jerk calamari app, it was different, but just ok. The entrees we had were: Jerk chicken breast ; was good , Salmon with guava burre blanc sauce ; was ok , Green chile burger ; was the only really  good food ! 

Here's the bad part, calamari app was a bit on the greasy side. Then when I asked what size salmon came with entree and he said 8oz,  but actually was 4 maybe 5 oz. for $22 ?
Listen, I don't mind paying good money for good food, but if it's going to be small portion, it better taste REAL good, this wasn't worth the money.  
Then the rice that was served with entrees was half under cooked and the seasonal veggies needed seasoning. They tried replacing under cooked rice with mash potato, but that needed seasoning too. 
They did comp part of our meal which was really nice of them to do. I would give 2 1/2 stars but yelp doesn't have 1/2 stars.

She forgot about the cookie that comes with the child's meal so she brought my daughter a roll.  It almost fell off the plate as she was handing it to us so she touched it to keep it from falling.

It's Memorial Day weekend and my friends and I walk in on Sunday morning for brunch. A DJ is present and playing pretty good 90's Hip Hop and R&B, just what we like. We are actually impressed that there's an actual DJ, lol.

The ambience in here is on the more upscale side of casual. It's very cute. Bougie decor. Great for pictures. Located right in the heart of The Gramercy.

We are seated promptly and our server is very attentive. My girlfriend orders bottomless mimosas, a pork chile omelette, and chicken flautas. I order the special tiger shrimp omelette with a Caribbean sidecar (this drink has Hennessy privilege in it with sweet simple syrup... so good), and my friend's husband orders the fried jerk chicken and waffles.

1) Our server spilled my drink on the table and a bit on myself and on my belongings. He was very sorry, however, and continued to clean it all up.
2) My girlfriend got the wrong food delivered to our table. So that had to be fixed.
3) My omelette was very bland. Not enough shrimp, not enough Hollandaise sauce, the potatoes had zero flavor. I was not very impressed by my meal. I was more impressed with the appetizer of the chicken flautas, to be honest.

Will I give this place another chance? Maybe. But I think I would like to come back for lunch or dinner with better options for entrees. I feel like my meal was not satisfying. I would def like to come back for bottomless mimosas.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,2,1,3,C98jmUIbZgAGs0yB1acNbg

Probably the only menu I've seen where I like every single item on it. I hear the owner is also the chef which explains the quality of food,  but above all, it's that perfect combination of tastes he has created with very much healthy ingredients. Sweet and spicy Caribbean flavors, cooked to perfection. The price is very much justified because of the fact that the food is so healthy, absolutely guilt free and delicious.

Anyway, we were seated in the back and met Luis, who was an amazing server. (I am really big on service.) 
We ordered 2 infused drinks from the bar which were awesome. Waters were kept full. Yummy bread basket came out. And best of all, our 3 year old's mac n cheese came early for her. The macaroni and cheese almost made me wish I had ordered it myself. SO good. 
I ordered the chicken curry with couscous and my husband ordered southwest pork with eggs. Both so flavorful and large portions. I am famous for putting tons of salt on most everything I eat but didn't need or want to add salt to anything to we had here, it was perfect as it came out.

$22 Bottomless mimosas for brunch. When they say bottomless, THEY MEAN IT. Never saw the bottom of my glass, and they were delicious! The only thing that could have made them better was a variety of juice, but there wasn't much OJ in them anyways so it was all good! :D

Veggie Omelet. I asked for mine with egg whites which they had no problem with! I have never had a veggie omelet with the variety of veggies that they used! Asparagus and zucchini are never in any other veggie omelet I had &let me tell you IT WAS AMAZING! 

Friendly staff. I didn't deal with the hostess myself, but the bartenders were great and our server was amazing as well. Very nice and accommodating. Again, mimosas were never empty.


DISLIKES:

The wait. I understand it was a Sunday brunch, anywhere in town is going to be packed. However, I would just have liked to have been aware of the ACTUAL wait time when we got there. A ""20-30 minute wait"" turned into an hour. Thankfully, we had our drinks in hand which was great, but I wouldn't have been so upset to wait an hour if I was just told that in the beginning. Once we were going to be seated, our group of 3, saw 2 other open tables on the walk to our table. Weird. Then, it took about another half hour to get our food order. People here bottomless mimosas until 2, they tend to stay in their seats until 2pm. Definitely need a larger space or to use the outside tables as well. 

Bathroom situation. There is ONE bathroom. ONE single toilet for the entire establishment. Not okay especially when everyone in there is drunk. 

Overall, had a good experience but I think next brunch I would try another place before making this my permanent brunch go to spot.",eICyvIE-ZaXqn9Z2vCVT3A,4,2,4,rgjG0VjMEn5E8GI3k1dBzw

We started with the scones. Fresh and hot. Served with butter and some type of berry compote. Best I've had in my life. Hands down. They were amazing. 

For entree I got the jerk chicken and waffles. The waffle was above average but by itself wouldn't have stood out. The chicken was an absolute home run. 10/10!

The decor is bright and vibrant. The owners were working the floor like they were hosting a party in their home. Let me mention again, their food was killer good. 
I slapped my forehead as I took the first bite of their blueberry scone from their  $10 pastry basket. I was so irritated that I NEVER paid them a visit as a LV resident. Their scone was not the rock hard, use it as a weapon kind of scone. It was just, divine, that's all I can say. And their croissant was perfection. Flakey and buttery, the French would be proud.

2225207,2012-11-18,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"This place is more of a 3.4 in my book.  My experience here is better rated when broken down into pieces.

Customer Service- When eating at a place such as this one, I expect the customer service to be on point.  Instead, it was just... meh.  We were seated in the middle of the dining room next to a table that was literally one foot away from us.  One person in that party was extremely loud (which I know DW Bistro cannot help), but it was very distracting.  Our server only came over to take our order and never really checked on us.  Our food took a really long time to come out and nobody came to give us a status on it.  When our drinks were refilled, water splashed everywhere on the table and there was no apology or clean up.

Food- My entree was EXCELLENT.  I ordered the fried chicken, which is boneless, and it was the best mix of spices... so good!  My fiance ordered the short ribs and he thought they were okay, but not the best he's ever had.

Overall, while my meal was good I'm not sure that I dig the vibe that comes along with it.  Maybe I will try it at another time of day to see if the experience is better.",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,0,1,3,75oBv8FZKNn3egBAdJjwiA

Yes, this place exceeded my expectations and I had to tell everyone right away! From the moment we called ahead to see how busy it was to the moment we said our goodbyes were way beyond satisfied! No wait, perfect service, delicious food and refreshing drinks. Everyone was attentive and the place was clean! We ordered their favorites, pork chops, Mac n cheese, couscous salad, short ribs, Jamaican jerk calamari and chicken. All were simply mouthwatering. The pork chops were huge and juicy with the right balance of flavors. Definitely sharing portions! Their bread basket had a variety to choose from. Now to the drinks; pineapple infused martini, gin and tonic, and  this citrus drink (I forgot the name) were all so yummy...try em all! Just have a DD ;).

Our service, especially Nick our server, was impeccable. Nick was one of the most knowledgable and attentive servers I've ever known. He knew his menu, and everything he recommended was spot on! I could tell he was a food junkie like me, and described all of his best meals like I would. They were so accommodating to my one year old boy and offered more of the tiny muffin bread he enjoyed.

2250555,2011-12-13,6,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I cannot wait to go back to DW Bistro. It is surely one of the top 10 dining experiences in Las Vegas, and I say that as a person with unusual prejudices toward the color orange (DW Bistro's design scheme is centered in shades of orange) and an iffy attitude toward strip mall locations.

I knew things were going to be grand the moment the host urged us to ""Come on in."" I was expecting hipster/trendy, and that's there in its best qualities, but the warm hospitality and neat-but-casual appearance of the other diners put me at ease right away. In fact, I was so at ease that I didn't mind sitting at a table in the middle of the cozy room (the more secluded seats were all taken), and usually I prefer to wait until something more intimate is available.

I started with the signature salad. The server (the kind of guy who can be completely professional and personable without being snooty or in your face) advised me that the salad was large, that in fact all of their portions are very large, but my husband agreed to share it so I ordered it as well as the vegetable curry.

In the dramatic words of George Takei, ""OH MYYYYY!""

How good was this salad? So. Good. The caramelized pecans were a revelation. (Until this salad, my husband thought he disliked pecans. If they hadn't been so generously used in the salad, I would've had to fight him for the last one.) The tangy goat cheese! The juicy orange segments! The crisp-but-complex field greens that were lightly but thoroughly dressed with vinaigrette! And mmm, the little red pepper bits.

No two bites were alike as I tried positioning the flavors in all possible combinations. For the first time ever, I reluctantly had to put the last bits of salad to the side so I'd have room to enjoy the main course.

What wasn't helping, I might add, were the delicious bread selections I made from the roving server with the bread basket. I chose pretzel bread and a sort of Jamaican beer bread, and while they were both great, the pretzel bread put all previous pretzel bread tastings to shame. (In fact, I went to Bon Breads at Town Square a few days later just because I read that they supply bread to DW Bistro.)

I had asked before ordering what ""seasonal vegetables"" were in the vegetable curry. I'm not a broccoli/cauliflower person, and that seems to be what I get when I order anything with ""seasonal vegetables."" (And this is why I will *never* order vegetable fajitas in this town again.)

Well, the kitchen talents at DW Bistro could've put a whole broccoli head into my curry and it would've been a lip-smacker, I'm sure, but what I ended up enjoying was a selection of green beans, peppers, squash, and I completely forget what else (red cabbage?) because it all folded together in the fragrant (so, SO fragrant) sauce with savory, large-grain couscous into a heavenly concoction that made actually putting my spoon down between bites a challenge. (But I would do it just to take another deep breath of the amazing aromas again.)

The host came by again to make sure all was well, although I think he could read our ecstatic faces just fine. Later I learned (hello Google!) that this was Bryce, co-owner of the restaurant. Byrce was friendly and pleased to chat a little about DW Bistro's desire for everyone to have a good time. He truly gets the meaning of ""host"" - a good host doesn't just greet you, send you to your table, and thank you as you leave. A good host makes you feel welcomed and makes sure you'll want to come back again.

We asked for the dessert menu, despite full bellies, because with appetizers and main courses like ours, we couldn't leave the sweet side unexplored, even if it meant that it would have to be enjoyed at home. Bryce gave us the verbal rundown, and we decided on chocolate cake and red velvet cake.

I didn't really get to try much of the chocolate cake because it was pretty much gone by the time I finished my red velvet cake the next day. (My husband isn't into red velvet, so that hefty slice was mine.) I can say, though, that the red velvet was moist and flavorful with the most delicious light-yet-rich frosting. The little berry accompaniments just added extra oomphs of mouth appeal.

Screech - wait! I forgot all about the macaroni and cheese with truffle oil that we got on the side! It was good, but we just didn't have room for it, so it came home. I didn't think the flavors were as good out of context and after a night in the refrigerator, but it was creamy and decadent when I took a few bites during the meal proper.

The dinner menu really only has the vegetable curry for a vegetarian main course (although there are appetizers and plenty of sides - can't wait to try the sauteed corn with Spanish onions), but the lunch menu has a vegetable burger that I'm penciling in for my next weekday off, if the brunch menu doesn't lure me in first.

And so I'll say it again: I can't wait to get back to DW Bistro. Don't wait as long as we did to make your first visit here.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,11,7,5,a00Zs_UuBO_YHs5hKN-sIw

I have a few new favorites...plaintains! Delicious, soft and sweet! Chorizo and shrimp, get extra crustini because the sauce is so flavorful you won't want to waste it. Sweet potato fries is loaded with extra goodness! My son pretty much ate the whole plate and wanted another order. 

For dinner I enjoyed the shrimp linguini. Large pieces of shrimp with a full flavored mix of spices. I also shared the braised short ribs and wow they just fell off the bone. Super soft and served with mashed potato. 

Vidal (sp?) was a great server. He was prompt, attentive and touched our table just enough times for us to never feel like he was missing.

Right when I sat down, I received a text message linking me to the nowaitapp website telling me my position in the wait queue. In my opinion, that is THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN! I was so fascinated by the constantly updating page telling you how many parties are in front of you that we got our table before we even knew it!

When we were seated at our table, the first thing I noticed was the 5 different bottles of hot sauce. Talk about variety! The lighting of the place gave it a nice cozy feel to it.  I had the eggs benedict with jalapeno bacon.  This particular entree also came with some house potatoes and a fruit cup.  The fruit cup came out first, and it was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. There were both red and green grapes, a small piece of orange, a small piece of grapefruit, and half of a small strawberry. Sure, it was a small fruit cup, but everything in it was ripe and sweet. Definitely a great start to the meal! When my entree came out, it was pretty much a biscuit cut in two, with a few slices of bacon, and topped off with some cheese.  Also on the plate was about half a potato's worth of house potatoes.  I honestly could not taste any jalapeno in the bacon, but the entire meal itself was delicious!  However, for the price of $13, I would have expected a bit more food for this particular entree.

I'd be back again, because the atmosphere and food was great! It was just the price that got to me. Heck, I'd visit again just to be put on that wait queue! haha!",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,3,2,5,p4JYzNqi4IYYQONB_SMIGw

Most of us was the first time or least for me it was so went in with open mind open palate! Did I need both for my first visit. Thankfully with other yelpers all on the same page got too try little of everything. The apps ohh my gosh between all of us just about order the whole menu and the kitchen sink. Talk about some amazing apps from the jerk oven roasted baby back ribs, jerked fried calamari, pesto torte, and couscous salad with seared ahi. The SIZE is no JOKE at DW Bistro! It not just about the size but the quality of the food without doubt stood out for me. The baby back ribs could have order whole slab be totally in rib heaven. The meat just fell off the bone, moist, and flavor had nice jerk hint citrus flavor then later get the spice kick in. Jerk calamari might look different (hell of dark) but that from the jerk seasoning tasted awesome. Pesto torte fan of the creamy goat cheese with the seasonings in it! It not so thick goat cheese but creamy enough that places perfect spread on flatbread crackers (out of the two the lavosh is the only way too go)! Talk about lot of cheese it felt like effiel tower of cheese! Couscous salad like fact that it was cooked al dente, nice mix of vegetables and seasoning in it, and the seared ahi on top was nice compliment too the dish. Every single plate looked cool. Nice clean plate, not overdone with the decorations, great portion, and let the food stand out by itself.

My entree ordered the jamaican curry chicken bowl. Talk about monster bowl. It was enough too feed two. Plus after all the apps had it was more then daunting too think about eating the whole bowl. The curry sauce itself was da bomb. It had nice curry seasoning throughout the whole dish. LOVE love the fact that it had so many different vegetables. All nice size cut vegetables that after sauteing everything can still distinguish each vegetable eating in the bowl. The chicken was cooked perfect nice moist decent portion in it. Break it down more vegetables then chicken. Am all good with that ratio. If your in the mood of chicken bowl or bowl DW is the way too go.

CORNBREAD........It deserve whole paragraph by itself!!! Not many places in Vegas been that has good true cornbread. DW heads and toes has the best cornbread. The crust is divine, hot and moist inside, again talk about monster portion, and the honey butter that the key. Sooooo Good! 

The service was fabulous! Our waiter was on top of it all night. I had too leave early for hockey game. He was more then happy too ring up just my check. Rest of the yelp gang stayed for desserts.

The spices and sweetness they use in everything I tried were really well balanced.

I got the turkey sandwich and it was delicious with the fruit chutney top. It was heavy on the chutney so I added some of the hot sauce to balance out the sweetness (the big mango one). All of the hot sauces were provided at our table and were absolutely spectacular - really nice heat but also flavorful and low on the vinegar taste.
The salads are perfectly dressed and full of good, dark baby greens.
Someone at my table got the portabello mushroom sandwich, and it literally melted in my mouth at the first bite.
Tables around got chicken and waffles and made me second guess my decision for a minute - great portions and the chicken looked perfectly blackened.

The ambience was open and bright. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, lunch. It doesn't seem very intimate for a dinner atmosphere.
The waiters were great and one of the owners even greeted us out the door and asked how we liked the food. Very nice folks!

This is my new favorite lunch spot in Vegas. Interesting, delicious, perfect portions and bright, welcoming atmosphere.

I really wish I could give four stars because the ambiance was great, but fair is fair! 

My girlfriend and I and one of our friends dined here on Friday evening for the first time. We got there a little after 9:30 p.m. and there may have been 2 or 3 other tables eating and a few people at the bar. 

We opted for patio seating (one star for ambiance). 

The menu was refreshing and unique, unlike most off-the-strip restaurants in Las Vegas. It reminded me of something you would catch in Southern California near a beach. 

We started off with the pesto torte appetizer. From the menu, I imagined it would be a bit of cheese mixed with a bit of pesto and some crackers. However, it was more like a huge block of goat cheese with a drizzle of pesto/olive oil and a few crackers. I'm not usually a goat cheese, or cheese in general, fan but I did enjoy the flavors. I do wish there was more pesto, but overall it was different and quite good. 

I ordered the beer braised short ribs, my girlfriend ordered the chicken with roasted garlic bowtie pasta and our friend ordered the Jamaican curry bowl. I was very impressed with the diversity of the menu and really excited to try each dish. However, when the food arrived, I was a bit disappointed. Everything tasted very bland, which was surprising because the menu descriptions lead me to believe the dishes would be bursting with flavor. They were not. It tasted like one of those old-fashioned grandma meals or something you'd get at a buffet. Great presentation, very generous portions, but nothing to write home about. My dish needed something - some type of spice or salt. The chicken with pasta tasted like it was out of a box or like the chef neglected to add spices or garlic when preparing the dish. The Jamaican curry also tasted bland. Bland and flavorless. I was really upset because I had high regard due to the reviews. 

Also, our waiter wasn't very attentive. He came back to check on us a few times, but a lot of time passed between check-ins and our food was sitting on our table, ready to be taken away for at least 20 minutes before he did so. 

Perhaps we arrived late at night (we were definitely the only people ordering food) and maybe the chefs were just checked out for the night. I'm not sure. 

We ordered dessert. My girlfriend had the chocolate cake and our friend ordered the carrot cake. Both were moist and delicious (two stars here).

now for the annoying part. the acoustics in the place is weird. ive been to loud restaurants but the acoustics in the place was so awkward to the point that i was getting uncomfortable. it didnt help that there was a table of maybe 10 ladies sitting in a booth that had the walls curved towards us. when i looked around it seemed like everyone was talking in their normal level and tone of voice. but it was so much louder than it seemed. my sister said that when she came for lunch they sat in the corner next to the bathroom area. if you look at the ceiling its curved downward in a sloping fashion. she said she could hear people's conversations across the room. 

who designed this place? put some foam on the walls!",klN7Yw_aVUBscqhlkpKkRA,0,1,4,BhLc2qP4fbFsN__d7arHEQ

I will warn you that the ""dusting of jerk seasoning"" is pretty heavy handed so be prepared for some spice. My dinner companions had a steak dish and the jerk shrimp pasta.

My wife ordered a pomegranate iced tea which she liked. I'm not big into iced tea, but I took a sip and thought it was decent.

For our appetizer we both got the shrimp cocktail which was good and had a nice kick to the sauce.

For my main course I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was spicy and delicious. The waffle was served with a really good rum syrup. Would definitely order this again.

My wife got the crab cake Benedict. I'm not a huge fan of Hollandaise but the dish was still pretty tasty. The egg was a bit over done though and had a firm yolk.

For dessert we were give an assortment of treats: mud pie, red velvet cake, lemon lime pudding, and peanut butter pie. I'm not a big fan of sweets and was a little daunted by it all.

From the street it looks to be your standard Vegas strip mall dining spot. I was certainly not expecting the floor to ceiling decorators dream come true upon entering.  Fashioned to the nine, DW pulled out all the stops when it comes to ambiance, decor, and set up. It's fun, modern, but not cold, as most modern decors can tend to feel.

We were dining during lunch hour, midweek so lets just say wait time to get a seat was nonexistent. My guests and I were able to choose our own seats (always a plus in my book). 

The menu is a unique twist on sandwich type foods, rice/curry bowls, and other lunchable items.  I went for the turkey pannini and  though it was a little dry it was still quite flavorful. All I have to say is the sweet potato fries are delightful!  My next favorite part about this place is the fact that they serve FRESH lemonade with free refills!

My only bummer moment here at DW was the fact that it took almost an hour for our SANDWICHES to come out to our table despite the restaurant being virtually empty and our orders fairly simple. (Hence the lack of star on this rating).

So should my travels find me on the West Side of town and in the mood for swanky surroundings and delectable eats (and lets not forget bottomless lemonade), I would most certainly keep DW Bistro at the top of the list.",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,3,1,4,4g2BLspYagSnK-Qomq2JBw

2413203,2011-04-24,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"My girl and I went here for an early dinner yesterday.  For starters, we waited over 5 minutes before a server even came over to greet us.  No big deal.  Drinks came out quickly and soon the appetizer we ordered (chicken lolipops).  It was pretty good albeit just dressed up, snazzy chicken wings.

I ordered the filet and my girl ordered something that we later found out, after waiting 10 minutes that the kitchen was out of.  So, she ended up ordering the lamb.  We both ordered our meals medium.

It took over 40 minutes to get our meals.  Pretty bad considering there was only 3 other tables filled in the restaurant.  When our food came out my filet was burnt and my girlfriend's lamb was extremely rare.

I told the server of the problem with my filet and sent it back.  Didn't send back the lamb because my girlfriend had loaded up on bread during the hour and 20 minutes we had to wait to get our food and she wasn't hungry anymore.

Another 30 minutes pass and I finally get the new filet only to have it also well done.  I didnt complain, just accepted it and asked for a togo container for both meals.

We got the check and I was told the cook was new and was in training and the server apologized for the screw up on our meals.  He then said that instead of charging us for 4 glasses of wine that he only charged us a bottle.  Fantastic, I thought until I saw how much each glass cost.

I dont mind paying a good bit for a quality meal however in my opinion just about everything except for the chicken wing appetizers was mediocre if not subpar.   I have had better mashed potatoes out of a box.  I ended up paying over $100 including tip.  Grossly over charged considering the experience and the quality of the food.

After spending over 8 years as a server and front of house manager in restaurants I know what to expect and how to treat customers.  We should have never been allowed to pay for the filet and the manager should have dropped by to ask and comment on the filet.  Totally unacceptable experience we had.

DW Bistro has been a staple on the Southwest side of town for years now. I recently stopped by their new location in the Gramercy and decided to write a long overdue review.

DW is probably most famous for their Sunday Brunch, but they are an all-around great option regardless of time of day. They are one of the only Jamaican Fusion restaurants I know of in Vegas, and they do a really amazing job of bringing through Jamaican flavors in many of their dishes. They're not about traditional Jamaican eats...even their Jerk Chicken is not a traditional style Jerk Chicken, but what they are about is good portions of slightly elevated, super tasty food.

My most recent visit was for Sunday Brunch. My love and I shared the Salmon Benedict and a Special Jerk Chicken on Corn Bread Benedict. Both items were really good. I also tried a little of their Chicken N Waffles...this was a solid item, but not my favorite version. I'm a fan of the Jamaican Chicken Curry Bowl, Couscous Salad, Daily Street Tacos, and Fish Escovitch. The owners are great and I feel good about supporting a local spot when I eat here. My love raves about the service of Alfonso, and I finally had the opportunity to experience the warmth of his huge smile and his incredible service on my last visit.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,28,25,4,rR1nV8LzhHZOIOjNz5CNHQ

Came for the cocktail, stayed for the food. It was more than worth it. One of the specials was this salad, and I don't really remember what all was in it because I heard fried ball of goat cheese and tuned out. Salad was delicious. There were mixed greens, chopped garlic, red onions, and something that looked like a cherry tomato but was far more savory and tart, with champagne dressing. Very light.

I also decided to try the turkey sliders with sweet potato fries. I was never a fan of sweet potatoes, and especially sweet potato fries, but these were delicious. The sliders were small, but they were also from the Shareables section. The apple pear mango chutney gave a nice kick to them.

Finally, since I was a new visitor, I was treated with a complimentary piece of carrot cake, which had white chocolate, macadamia nuts, ginger, and coconut. They gave me a separate fork, which was brought out in what looked like a small wooden box laid with satin. Talk about presentation.

Okay moving on, the place itself is very feel good.  Bright lights, very fun, friendly atmosphere.  The food is very good in my opinion, we had the brunch.  I had the breakfast sandwich.  Packed with flavor and not too greasy, which is always a good thing.  I tried my friends Chicken and waffles, but there is too much competition out there for this to be the best.

My most recent experience was my second time dining here. The first time just me and my other half, but this was a group of ten. It is safe to say if there was not a crazy wait time, I would give this place 5 stars. They do not accept reservations, but often seem to get large parties. Considering they offer bottomless mimosas, I could see why. I went against the mimosa and chose the DW Bloody Mary which comes with olive, lime, a pickle spear, and 3 slices of jalapeno bacon. It has a bearable kick, and could be considered a meal in itself. 
Among our table I tried the jerk chicken and waffles, the eggs benedict served with NM style pork, pork jerk hash, a caesar salad, chicken flautas, and the vegetable curry.  My personal favs were the flautas, the actual chicken on the waffle dish, and the curry. Never would I had thought to order curry from here, but oh man I am grateful Vanessa N. kept shoving it down my throat cuz it was freaking delish! 
My first trip was superb customer service. And with the group, I would say almost the same. I noticed a couple things that went missed, but nothing too major. And with a loud group of 10 obnoxious Yelpers, (who may have been tipsy), I cannot complain about the service we received. It sucked having to wait over an hour to be seated. But great company made the time pass. 
This is a solid choice for some above average New Mexico style comfort food with a kick. 
I hope DW decides to expand. I would love to see another location in Henderson somewhere.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,7,6,4,Tpx3647DJMjon0yBmRgOPw

However, in addition to a couple enjoyable appetizers, we ordered a slice of their red velvet cake (one of my guilty pleasures) that made up for the BLT. This ""slice"" was at least 1/5 of the cake. I'm convinced the white chocolate shavings were really angel wings because the cake was nothing short of heavenly. On to today's lunchtime yelpventure at DW... The second we walked in, we were made to feel very welcome. The ambiance is contemporary but cozy as a cabin. All throughout lunch, my eyes were buzzing about trying to find a flaw in the decor but I just kept finding things that made me happy I was there. The bar was full, as were the patio & indoor dining area & there was a party being held in the adjoining private party room. We ordered their pomegranate tea. Ahhhmazing. We had 3 glasses. We ordered pork flautas to start with & were given small bowls of fresh fruit. Seriously, I could eat those flautas all. day. long. We ordered the DW Bowl (no egg. it comes served over rice with tortillas on the side.) & the spinach wrap filled with freshly roasted turkey, jalapeño infused bacon, tomatoes, avocado, romaine & chipotle mayo (w/ sweet potato fries on the side). Both entrées were bursting with flavor & we had plenty to take home. We were so full (was it the food or the 3 teas!?) that we didn't partake in any heavenly delights for dessert but we promised them we'd be back for carrot cake & more tea in the very near future.

2640858,2014-04-02,5,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Eeeek!! Here's the deal. I've known about DW Bistro for a LONG time now and have been dying to come on a date night, but never got around to it. I constantly see the reviews in my Yelp feed because I live so close-by, so I was really excited to finally try it last Saturday. My husband and I went with my sister-in-law before the Xtreme thing, because we had to have a sophisticated dinner prior to blending in with Las Vegas's most obnoxious crowd at Desert Breeze Park. 

Our server may have been the tastiest part of the meal (that was piggish, I know, but he was seriously HOT) and so friendly. It seems like the tables he was serving were all regulars, several of them with women. I bet they all ask to be seated in his section for some eye candy. MOVING ON! We started off with the jerk calamari. When they brought it over to us, we were really surprised because it was a pile of black, wet, calamari. It was calamari drenched in their jerk sauce which ended up being way too salty, and soggy. The squid inside however, was high quality, not chewy, and tender. I just wish it wasn't in that sauce. Sadly, this was a recommended appetizer. 

For entrees, we went with more appetizers. We ordered the flautas, turkey sliders, and chicken curry soup. The flautas were tasty, but sadly not tastier than ones that I had at a hole in the wall Mexican take-out place in California. The turkey sliders that everyone RAVES about were so underwhelming! My SIL took a photo and put it on IG, and she had 15+ comments talking about how much they love this thing. I found pieces of the chutney to be bitter (orange peel possibly?) and the burger itself to be tasteless and dry. I just didn't understand the hype of this thing. It came with no veggies either which I found disturbing. It was just a brioche bun, turkey, and chutney. 

Lastly, the soup that everyone on Yelp talks about was a nice sized soup loaded with chicken and veggies. However, I found the seasoning to be on the strong side. I loved the consistency, which must have used a lot of coconut milk to make it so creamy. Perhaps it was an off-night, but the food was not up to my expectations. Things were over-seasoned and I wouldn't order any of these things again. I really really want to come back (to spy on the hot waiter) and try their brunch because that seems to be where the real magic happens!

For my side i got their signature salad (nothing to really claim about it) greens, pecans and a dressing that I couldn't describe about later. 
Before the sandwich, I did have their chicken curry soup... another great choice.. 
A creamy curry base with bits of chicken and jalepeno bacon... only had a cup.. could have gone for a bowl.

After arriving, our server asked if we wanted a starter.  I eagerly ordered the white chocolate and blueberry scones - and was told that the pastry person last night did not prepare enough, so they were only available if one ordered the pastry basket, and not on their own.  Neither of us wanted the chocolate croissant, so no scones for us.  We proceeded to order our meals, a roasted pork omelet and a roasted veggie omelet.  These came with bread - I ordered an English muffin and my friend ordered brioche toast.
My omelet was good, not great, and I asked for salsa to liven it up.  My grind enjoyed her omelet.  We didn't get any butter for the bread, but it was brought when we asked.  When I went to butter my ""English muffin"", I realized that it was NOT AN ENGLISH MUFFIN!  It was a hamburger bun cut into the size of an English muffin and toasted.  Seriously.  I tried to eat it, but it really wasn't worth it.  When I told our server, he told me that they had a new bread supplier, and it probably was just a different brand.  When he looked at it, he realized that it truly was a hamburger bun.  He apologized, but did not offer anything to correct it.  
We ordered the chicken and waffles next, and those were great - wish we had started lthere.  Overall, an OK experience, but a lot of excuses, no scones, and an awful substitute for an English muffin.

Usually a restaurant with so many great reviews you'd have to wait at least 15 - 20 minutes to be seated, but both times (first time with a party of 7, second time with a party of 4) there was zero wait.  

Our server Marco was excellent.  Very attentive but not overly.  

The Bloody Mary's here are SOOOO good.  You had me at Jalapeno bacon! (second best BM I've ever had). 

I ordered the Jerk pork hash, half order was huge! Delish.  I also got to try some of my friends food.  The Challah french toast was BOMB.  I usually don't like scones because they are too dry and bland, but the scones here were so light and fluffy and perfectly sweet.

At the time my boyfriend wasn't able to eat gluten for a little while and the waiter was super helpful and nice to talk to. So we both ended up getting the specials of the day. His was a rib-eye steak with scallops and asparagus and I got the fish of the day which was an Atlantic cod over rice and vegetables. Oh my goodness, so delicious! I'm pretty sure it was the first time my boyfriend and I didn't have any leftovers to take home :)

For dessert, he decided to get the lemon pudding because of the gluten thing and it was sooo delicious. It comes with dark and white chocolate truffles and fresh berries. I got the carrot cake which was really great. They say that it's a home recipe and I savored every bite. Oh and be sure to try the tea they have. I regret that I don't remember what kind of tea it was but I'll check when we go back. 

This place is definitely a little more pricey than we're used to but it was completely worth every penny.

We stopped by during their Sunday brunch madness, found ourselves staring down an hour wait, and opted for food to-go on our way to the desert.
The staff at DW is impressively competent and friendly. They're essentially wrangling a herd of ravenous socialites with the attention spans and attention demands of toddlers, and they do so admirably.
Not surprisingly, we ordered Jerk Chicken & Waffles as well as the Jerk Pork Hash. Both meats were nicely cooked and the portions were perfect. If you're still reading, you're no doubt wondering why this isn't a four-star review. Two reasons:
1. Their jerk seasoning is much too timid. You get the allspice, some herbs, and citrus (there's even some additional orange rind on the waffles), but the habanero heat is a no show. It doesn't move far enough beyond regular chicken & waffles.
2. I am not a weirdo who carries condiments in my man-purse, but I'm officially designating DW as a B.Y.O.Syrup establishment. It's a sad moment when you find yourself wishing you could un-pour the sticky sweetness you just splashed all over your waffles and chicken (for the record, you cannot). You know that irrevocable moment when you dump way too much brandy or Grand Marnier into your recipe and convert the whole dish into a boozy mess? We've all done it, and we'll probably do it again. With luck, DW only did it on the day we visited. The syrup was odd, overbearing, and unfortunate. You have been warned.",2zhTsvYOEPQaQP9w53zkvA,0,1,3,uiZL0MAuO2BULO32L1pk5g

The entire menu sounded delicious. Hardest part was picking what I wanted.
Everyone got something different so we were able to taste lots of things and they were ALL really good. That is rare, usually one or two people have meal choice envy but not this time.

From the breakfast sandwich to the pastry basket, the bread tastes like it was just freshly made. It was warm and flaky, the perfect texture and served with fresh jam. The jerk hash was outstanding. The smoky taste of the meat was like authentic barbecue slow cooked for days. Two pretty flowers topped the mountain of meat and potato hash.

I really don't have anything negative to say about their menu. I've never had anyone complain about their dish or return anything back to the kitchen. My favorite dish is the New Mexican style pulled pork bowl. Flavorful, spicy, saucy and very satisfying. I personally like the two fried eggs on top. If you are really hungry, this bowl's for you. I also recommend the chicken curry with couscous dish. My wife had this dish last time and I had food envy. I still haven't tried any of their jerk chicken dishes or any sandwiches or salads but I hear they are equally delicious. 

Lastly, the decor is trendy, modern and casual and the staff is friendly, fun and accommodating. The owners are so fashionable and always around helping the staff. Truly a hidden gem.

Ok, let me start by saying UNLIMITED MIMOSAS! You can't go wrong with that. You can opt for just champagne, but I don't like looking like an alcoholic at 10 am on a Sunday. But who I am kidding when I drink 8 or 9 regular mimosas? 

The food during brunch is excellent!! Always ask your server for their specials, which is what I end up ordering. One of the specials I ordered was the special eggs benedict, which consisited of a potato cake instead of a muffin and topped with their green chilis. SO FREAKING GOOD! My only complaint is that it just didn't seem like enough food for $16. Maybe give me a bigger side of potatoes or add another benny. Who knows, maybe I'm just being a fatty, but the others at my table who ordered the benny seemed to have the same consensus. Their BLT is also amazing. Thick cut peppery bacon served on Texas toast and served with sweet potato fries. Next time I think I'm going to have to try the vegetable curry. I had a small bite of it and it was excellent. 

Service here is spot on. Our server MARCO (I'm sorry for calling you Cesar, I blame the mimosas and Vanessa) is outstanding. Always refilling our drinks, making sure we have everything we need, and lastly having the patience to handle our rowdy group. Hats off to you sir!

Tip: come early! The wait for Sunday brunch can be horrendous. I've always been lucky and have never waited more than 20 minutes.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,5,2,5,YaQIZSExGTtEKz3SITnIwA

I had the special of the day, which had something to do with a roasted turkey omelet. To be honest, it was good, but not great. But everyone that ordered off the menu had awesome food.

2837572,2012-08-06,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Located in the SW part of town, I've been wanting to try this place out based on the excellent reviews for brunch and their take on dishes with either a Jamaican or Southwest flare.  My cousin was in town for a martial arts tournament so we decided to venture off the strip and give this place a try.  I was warned that the wait for Sunday brunch can be long, but they have a nice bar area with a tantalizing selection of alcoholic breakfast drinks (bloody mary with jalapeno bacon and other beverages with island twists such as the fresh strawberry mojito), and there is also a Starbucks next door to chill out as well.  I appreciated the vibrant modern decor with white walls with colorful bright-colored accessories (see their website) and plenty of windows allowing in natural light as well as their waitlist system on the Ipad where you receive a text message on your phone when your table is ready as well as the opportunity to receive periodic updates at your disposition (savvy marketing).  The noise level inside can be quite high for the brunch crowd inside although there is a nice patio when the weather is permitting.

We started out with the pastry basket which came with a nice pastiche of goat cheese turnovers served with guava jam, blueberry white chocolate scones, and banana muffins still warm to the touch and they were a big hit at the table.  The main entree portions are generous and they all come served with a nice mini-bowl of fresh mixed fruit and thick wheat toast.   Being from Tennessee, I'm a sucker for all variations of chicken and waffles and the jerk fried chicken and waffles was on point with a decent amount of heat (although there are 4 bottles of hot sauce at the table if you wish to turn it up a notch), breast meat is perfectly fried into thin crispy strips of heaven that compliment the house maple syrup and waffles spruced up with a slight amount of orange zest.

Some reviewers raved about the rice bowl of New Mexican style slow cooked pork topped with red chile and a sunny side fried egg served alongside fresh flour tortillas.  Conceptually and presentation wise, I had high hopes, but I found myself disappointed with this dish since it was severely under-seasoned (I almost never reach for the salt-shaker and this one definitely needed some salt) and for all the time invested in slow-cooking the pork, it was definitely overcooked and had no inherent flavor as well.  The chili was a paste of what tasted like pureed chipotle chiles but it could have used some tomato paste or acidity to add an additional dimension of flavor.  I hope I got a subpar batch but will not readily order this dish for myself and concentrate on their other offerings in the future.  I look forward to trying their lunch/dinner menu since the curry chicken soup sounds amazing and their other dishes/desserts also look delectable, but not the groundbreaking debut I was expecting but definitely with high upside.  Ted Mosby describes himself in How I Met Your Mother, ""I'm not some top forty song, easily digestible. I'm complex, I require time and multiple listens. I'm Stairway to Heaven.""

The size of the actual Eggs Benedict was okay But it was an extremely small portion of potatoes, which was disappointing because they were so good. I'm not a big girl by no means, but I was left feeling hungry after I ate and ended up filling up more on the mimosas than the actual food. 

Mike got the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Waffles which is a giant portion and never disappoints. It's always so tasty and huge that he has leftovers for another meal.

Service was good even though there a few small bumps (nothing to raise attention to).  Also, the owners greeted us with enthusiasm, which I thought was very professional.

Foodwise, everyone gets an assortment of breads with chipotle butter.  My fiance orders a cup of the Jamaican Chicken Curry soup.  Wow, that stuff was good.  The soup's viscosity was more of a chowder, and had a smokey flavor with hints of curry.  Unfortunately, there were about two spoonfuls left before our server took it away.  On to our entrees...  He ordered the Jerk Filet that comes w/DW house rice.  There was no rice, boo.  Instead, garlic mashed potatoes that were just average.  I wonder if the DW rice is good?  I tried a small bite of his filet which was cooked medium rare.  The filet was cooked wonderfully.  However, be prepared for JERK!  We realized it is a jerk filet but the jerk was very overpowering, which in my opinion is somewhat wasteful for a filet mignon.  Todd said his food was good but HOT (we're home now, and he says he's still perspiring)!  His only side dish was the DW Sauteed Corn, yummy!  My entree was the Chicken with Roasted Garlic & Cream Sauce with Bowtie Pasta served with sauteed garlic, prosciutto, shallots and seasonal vegetables.  The dish looked stunning and everything was cooked well.  Unfortunately, it was quite bland.  I really wanted to like it but it just lacked flavor.

During the course of our dinner we had three glasses of wine, two rieslings and one pinot noir.  I must say I really liked the pinot noir which was by Alta Maria.

I really want to like DW because we were quite happy with the dinner breads, chicken curry soup, and sauteed corn--all of these were amazing.  I just have to assume we ordered the wrong entrees.  The mishap with the mashed potatoes is understandable as well as the soup being taken away a bit early too.  With all of these calculations I feel three stars is where we'll have to leave DW.  We'll be back to try some other things and would love to award five stars.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,2,2,3,1oeLRVNDBHX7J_wyD0t_Sg

In your typical American chain restaurant, the manager makes it appoint to ensure that you and your party are taken care of. So naturally, I expect the same from this very quaint restaurant tucked away in Southwest Las Vegas. 

On this very slow night amongst a table of 15, I dined with no visit from the owner or even acknowledgment that our very full table was even present in this very eloquent dining facility. I was completely shock because typically the chef/owner makes it appoint to thank his patrons for dining and ensuring that the party was cared for with the upmost respect and customer service, especially when it is a big party. I can say that this establishment is well put together and the food is wonderful but the owner/chef leaves much to be desired. Maybe he should take lessons from his wait staff on proper care and service for paying customers. It would have been nice for you to acknowledge our table even in passing the over five times I watched you walk past our table which was positioned directly in front of the kitchen, you never acknowledged our presence.

Last night I had the Chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta served with sautéed garlic, pancetta, shallots and seasonal vegetables for $15 and a Wasatch White Ale.  The meal tasted fantastic and the portion was HUGE; one could almost share the portions at this restaurant.  I'm really glad they had Wasatch White Ale in stock as I haven't had that in a long time since I lived in Salt Lake City.  The beer was served at the perfect temperature, too.

Front of house service was prompt and courteous.  I don't know who the gentleman was that greeted me at the door but he made me feel like a regular and that he valued my business; that goes a long way.

The wait staff service was on the slow side and it was because of this I'm giving them 4 stars.  Summarizing, I was not greeted table-side for about 5 minutes after being seated and was not given water for about 10 minutes after that.  It's possible due to my location in the back that this was initially forgotten about...not the end of the world, just making note of it.  When the server was at table-side he was professional and seemed to know the menu offerings well.  I don't recall his name but his personality was a bit subdued, which I actually prefer as opposed to trying to put on a show. Yes, I prefer the ambience and the food to be the show; so well done in that department.

DW Bistro has a rather simple menu for lunch...everything looks good but I always order Jamaican Chicken Curry bowl with jasmine rice.

I mean over seven hundred reviews and a four and a half star rating, DW is obviously doing something right. From the decor of the venue, to the amazing food, and don't forget the drinks. No wonder this place is always packed. 

Walking up to DW Bistro you can already feel the buzz and I'm not talking alcohol... yet. On Sundays this place is humming with hungry brunchers, and with an hour wait ahead, why not start starting sippin' on some bottomless mimosas. These will cost about twenty dollars a person, which really isn't a deal bad especially if you're here with a large group. They aren't stingy either, every time my glass was empty, before I could look around for a server my glass was being topped off. 

We finally sat down and immediately ordered the pastry basket. This is filled with chocolate croissants & blueberry white chocolate scones. The soft pastries were very fresh and surprisingly not overly sweet. This basket is overflowing and will easily feed five people, a great way to kick off the brunch party. 

With a group five I won't bore you with what everyone ate, I mean it's really all about my snacking skills, right? Kidding of course (NOT REALLY) 

I ordered one of their ""off the menu specials"". A Mexican-style slow cooked chicken omelet. This was a delicious, and I didn't feel bad about eating an omelet with chicken inside. I mean who cares which came first. The chicken was super tender and came soaking in a New Mexico red chili sauce with peppers, onions and pepper jack cheese. I would most definitely order this bad boy again. 

Our service was point and our party never had any issues. We ever stayed after they closed and the servers were still pouring mimosas.  This place is a great local hangout spot and the owner, DW, is awesome. He even topped off a few of our drinks personally.

If you try one thing, it must be the pastry basket. Get the special pastry basket if you can. The last couple times I've been they have had guava and goat cheese turnovers that I dream about. I went back a second weekend in a row just because of those darn delicious turnovers. On Sunday they have all day mimosas. The drinks are well crafted. I had a fantastic cappuccino. They regularly run food specials as well. I had the eggs benedict with the house made sausage and it was a great balance of sweet, spicy, and savory. The potatoes are a little on the spicy side for the average person. My mom wasn't a big fan. I loved them though.

You can sit at the bar or a table. The bar can get a bit tight when it's busy and the people behind the bar are doing drinks and managing orders for the customers at the bar.

Cons (in no particular order): 

The bathroom men's sink is not mounted on center, which appears to cause water flow over the back side. Not a huge deal, but for a clean freak it leads one to believe there will be mildew on the bottom of it eventually.

Again, a bathroom thing; the refuse bin has no handle, so you must lift the lid with your hand or foot. It does appear to be made of bamboo, which is a nice environmental touch.

Price is a bit much for a local bistro. That's a personal preference point, but still.

I ordered the ahi tuna special, but was charged for the lamb chops. The price may have very well been the same, but I didn't notice it until after we left, so its a matter of distress to be sure.

Pros (again, as they spring to mind):

The staff is exceedingly friendly and personable. They make you feel attended to and welcome. One of the owners (Bryce) walked around to each table and actually talked to each guest (that I saw). 
Not the usual manager walk by you see, but a sincere ""how are you, where are you from, what do you think"" conversation.

The food was phenomenal. Curry soup with just the right amount of zing. Seared ahi that was perfect for a fork on top of yellow and green beans that were done perfectly, with a nice crunch to them and not drowned in butter or oil. Excellent mashed potatoes. Generous portions of pasta and shrimp. Red Cake that was creamy yet not too overbearing. Strike that. If I weren't a guy I would call it luscious. If I were a violent man I'd have left that place, driven to the airport, hopped on a plane to Betty Crocker's house and slapped her across the face. It was that good.

Two words: Ginger. Beer.


Ordering an $8 shot of premium liquor gets you an $8 shot of premium liquor. Enough to fill a glass nicely.

Definitely recommend DW Bistro for a nice quiet dinner after work, but also have not tried to brunch, so I can't pigeon hole it just to night dinning. There's absolutely room for improvement to turn it into a local upper scale place to hang out, but for a little restaurant in a strip mall they are off to a superlative start. I mean, when two of the only cons for a place are in the bathroom, you know it has to be on the right track.  Please give it a try and let me know what you think.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,4,3,4,0YqW06lXMWAckWxnnUJPQw

Being from California I'm used to the sea food being less expensive so that was my only qualm. It was do good I could eat it every day! I personally didn't care for the calamari appetizer, the flavor was ok but the squid was a little chewy for my taste. 
I have to say this is a great little bistro with an excellent staff and great menu. I must note that I called about bringing a small cake in and they wanted to charge me $2 dollars a slice to cut it!

My favorite appetizer is the signature salad with goat cheese (a lot of it!) and caramelized pecans (so delish!!!)

We went for brunch and ordered a bunch of things.  The Jamaican Chicken Curry Soup was my favorite - very flavorful but I'd prefer a little more heat.

For the chicken and waffles, the chicken was well seaonsed and not dry considering many places can mess up a fried breast.  However, the waffles were a little on the dry side.  The flavor was spot on though.

Other favorites were the New Mexican slow cooked pork.  This is served in several ways.  You can get it in a bowl atop rice and an egg.  Or you can get it served in an omelette.

Whatever you do, if you go in a group, have one person order the slow cooked pork.  It's great.  

Heard the cury vegetable couscous lacked some heat.  

I think they should have it like a Thai setup with a 10 point scale.  When I think of Jamaican influences, I think of bold flavors. 

Everything was good...Some items couldve had some more heat.  Will def be back for dinner.  This place deserves all the hype.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,0,0,4,vbPHuSfyo_C6G6HXjMg6lw

It took an additional 45 minutes to get our food. Our server took our initial drink order when we sat down and then we didn't see her again until our food came. I saw her attending to all of her other tables during this time. In the meantime, I walked over to the bar in order to get another drink.

Due to the lack of service, we were all ready to give a less than stellar tip. When our bill arrived, there was an automatic gratuity of 20% applied. We were livid. No wonder she ignored us. She was already guaranteed to get her tip.

Our entrees were brought out very quickly despite every table in the restaurant being full. I enjoyed my turkey burger but once again it was too sweet. The chutney was good but their was too much of it and the raisins were unnecessary. The house salad was spot on and I wished I had a little more of it.

3149824,2013-07-21,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"So you drive into the parking lot of a random strip mall and see a restaurant with ""Bistro"" in the name. Based on my personal experience, that normally would mean that the restaurant would need to be avoided.

But that generalization certainly does not apply to this place. 

This establishment is one of those rare gems where you can achieve three- to four-star restaurant quality flavors at a one- to two-star price.

We came with a large party of 9 for lunch, and everyone was satisfied with their choices. My personal favorites were the couscous salad, which featured perfectly seared and seasoned ahi tuna as well as a perfect level of acidity in the couscous, and the Jamaican curry chicken, which had the right amount of spice countered with a seemingly endless variety of greens. Certainly, fresh ingredients are clearly the focus at DW's.

Not many folks would expect such quality for entree prices identical to those at Applebee's.

Drinks are also tasty and generous in terms of their alcohol/cost ratios.

The atmosphere is hip but very informal and relaxed. Servers are cordial, attentive, and have a keen sense of humor.

If you are visiting Las Vegas and have a car, do not hesitate to drop by this restaurant if you need a break from that casino prime rib or buffet special.",zX7hvqAKAD_sCbg7TaIIIw,1,1,5,PAHYZNP6sd5qaCvs7Pv8Yg

That's the type of crowd you'll get here at one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to. Sure, you'll have to wait perhaps an hour, but grab a drink from their bar that has so many different types of fruit-infused alcohol and a $20 all you can drink mimosa special.

Rumor (unconfirmed) has it that the restaurant owners go and purchase all their ingredients and food fresh in the morning before cooking it up during the afternoon. I'd believe it.

They even send you a text message/call you whenever your table is ready. Unfortunately for anyone not living in the vegas area, there's not much to do right around here. Anyways, on to the food.

Starters:
Grab the DW Pastry Basket and don't think twice...chocolate croissants, blueberry white chocolate scones, banana nut bread, guava something something goodness, etc. Enough to share all around and you can take the fresh-baked greatness.

Jerk Fried Chicken & Waffles: Best.chicken.and.waffles.ever. Chicken breast made me initially think twice about this dish, as i expected it to be pretty dry. Add in the lightly battered jerk spices on top of a moist piece of chicken breast, and you've got a winner.

I didn't have any, but the slow-cooked pork was pretty good according to the rest of my party.

Staff was friendly and on point.  Water cups were regularly refilled.  Seemed like someone was always coming around looking to fill empty glasses.  We also kept getting our table cleaned and a new setup after every course.

We started with a chorizo and shrimp appetizer.  It was a bit salty.  Big shrimp and slivers of chorizo with some red and yellow tomatoes.  For our entrees, we ordered an oven-roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl and shrimp scampi.  The shrimp scampi had the same huge shrimp.  The portion was what I would consider average.  But seeing other peoples food as well as the jerk pork shoulder bowl, I felt ripped off.  The other entrees were HUGEEEEEEEE!!!  The jerk pork shoulder was very tender, but I couldn't taste much of the jerk seasoning.  The rice underneath the mounds of pork was quite delicious.  

DW Bistro is really good for a neighborhood restaurant.  I saw someone order the jerk fried chicken and it looked quite delicious, and also a big portion.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.  And I will definitely be back.  I'm on the cusp of saying it is a 5 star place, but for now I can only give it 4 stars.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,1,1,4,D27_kz4wyJj5Cq8JJ71w1A

If you like Bloody Mary's spicy this one is for you either with or without alcohol. WOW! 

The Pastry Basket is huge, plenty left to take home. It was a delicious variety of butter croissant, chocolate croissant, blueberry and white chocolate scones complemented by strawberry jam and butter. 
The New Mexican Pork Omelet was a large omelet stuffed with slow cooked pork, New Mexico red chile sauce and jack cheese with a side of roasted potato's, onions, peppers and choice of toast. Very tasty pieces of pork and chile sauce.

When we arrived it was extremely loud and packed inside. We got on a wait for about 10 minutes. We ended up asking for a table outside on the patio due to how loud it was inside and the wait increased to about 20 minutes which I was ok with. 
We waited due to how loud it was indoors. You couldn't hear the person you were with unless you were yelling. The host kept us very up to date on the status of our table which was great. I mean it's not their fault they have a loud establishment, just means it has a lot of business!
Unfortunately there was nothing but trap and club bangers being played on the patio. When I go to brunch I expect a nice, relaxing environment. the music was so awful that it made it hard to even enjoy myself. The patio was loud as well, which would have been okay if the music wasn't so terrible. 
The endless mimosas were amazing, they never let me reach the bottom of my glass. The Bloody Mary was spicy and delicious as well. The omelette I ordered was tasty as well. Overall if it wasn't for the music and young, loud crowd I would come back. Unfortunately due to these variables I would never come back and never tell anyone else to brunch here.

3248215,2011-12-12,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"DW Bistro was one of those places that I was never too sure about. The Yelp reviews made it sound sensational, but the menu never really excited me too much. A couple of weeks ago, bereft of any other new option, the wife and I headed here and promptly had our concepts of ""taste"" redefined.

Now, let me set everyone straight right off the bat. When you see ""fried chicken"" on the menu, we're not talking about a battery chicken drumstick of the sort served up by the corporate monstrosity that is the legacy of Harlon Sanders. We're talking about an intricately seasoned masterpiece of wonderfulness, served with equally elaborate accompaniments, all coming together to awe the palate in ways you've never before comprehended.

The food here is simply out of this world. I don't usually throw the hyperbole around quite so thickly, but DW Bistro could quite possibly have provided me with my best meal ever in Las Vegas. Also delicious was the appetizer of ""chicken lollipops"". Bordering on sweet at times, but put into spicy perspective by the arrangement of grilled pineapple served on the side. A really wonderful appetite-whetting for my jerk fried chicken, which I already described, which was to follow.

Rounding things off nicely with a chat with the delightfully sincere proprietor, Bryce, who displayed genuine pleasure at our rapturous praise for our meal (and made sure one of our ""to go"" slices of their excellent cake was on the house) was enough to let me know I'll be back for a repeat visit very shortly - perhaps to see what wonderful new adventures await upon their lunch menu.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,2,1,5,m813ST5_WUWphUSYx7yL8Q

The oatmeal ordered was cold. The salmon on the eggs benedict was barely seared and was sent back to cook thoroughly. The jerk chicken and waffles was tasty. The service was mediocre at best.

3263759,2016-12-23,6,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I've been a loyal DW patron for over 6 years. Yesterday's experience was the worst and in my opinion the final time I go there. During lunch we had our department's mini-Christmas party. We were reserved a table right in front of the kitchen counter. I realized that I was getting the attention of the kitchen staff that were literally 10 feet away from me through the kitchen cutout. It was raining yesterday and so I came in wearing my Trump Make America Great Again hat. The people behind the counter were staring at my hat while talking amongst each other, made me very uncomfortable to say the least. Even when I eventually took it off as I settled in my seat the stares still lingered. I tried to brush it off since I cannot really leave because this was a group outing. Anyway I just wish they didn't do that. I wanted to leave this part out in this review but I think it's worth noting that this place or at least some of it's staff won't be as welcoming if you belong to a certain political persuasion. 

Service wise I think the place really disappointed me yesterday. 15 mins to get our orders in and another 45 mins to get our food seems a bit of a stretch. The place was busy when we started and towards the middle of the 45 minute wait the place already half emptied. We don't know where the hell our waitress went. My coworker had to stand up, walk to the bar and get another round of Mojito.

Food wise my only gripe is DW has been giving smaller and smaller portions of my favorite Ahi Couscous while jacking up its price. It used to be a good filling meal with generous portions of Ahi and couscous now it's only a fraction of the size. The one dish that keeps me coming is no longer worth the price.

That being said, thanks DW for all the years but we part ways here. The rest of my group feels the same way. These people were all diehard DW fans. Our Monday morning work conversations of DW Sunday brunches the day before will be just history.",DrwhNI-9ivWwDYXkFo0CyQ,5,1,1,v8srtkqctaa03VCR0oSzWg

I've eaten here several times - mainly for brunch and always quite enjoyed the complete experience.  Service is typically great and the food is usually creative, tasty and reasonably priced.  

Last night though...oh DW.  I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore!
My friend and I went to celebrate her birthday, and I had talked this place up quite a bit.  Our main server was abrupt, distant and had horrible timing!  He constantly interrupted our conversations and had a knack for doing so during the juiciest parts of stories!  Come on man, we're trying to talk here!  He seemed impatient with our questions and our leisurely dining pace.  We both ordered the mahi-mahi special - which was 30 dollars a plate so I was expecting it to be delicious.  The fish was dry, the rice was dry, and the mixed vegetables were flavorless and uninspired.  Mahi-mahi is a hard fish to ruin, and but they found a way.  It just felt and tasted like a piece of fish I bought frozen at Smiths, thawed out and tossed in the oven with some olive oil and teriyaki sauce.  If I can throw it together myself, I can't help but feel bitter about paying 30 dollars (plus tip) to eat it at a place I usually count on for a nice dinner out.  

The dinner was not a total loss - the other gentleman waiting on us (not our main server, more of a runner?) was incredibly pleasant and helpful.  Our starter was delicious - if you like a cheese dish to start, I must recommend the pesto torte.  Goat cheese, cream cheese, and pesto married together into a soft, savory tort make a fine start to any meal.  In fact, we worked on it throughout and used it to finish the meal as well.  

The hostess who seated us was adorable, and as always the atmosphere of DW is nice.  I just don't know if I can trust them after last night's sad dinner.  I suppose, like the pot smoking teen, trust must be earned before they get Mom's car keys again.",2MD7YF90xxjqPIAS4vcWjw,4,1,3,Zw55xXOPKDsFGJ976Y0dLw

A dear friend of mine, who I texted about the incident with many  emojis, informed me that DW hadn't closed, just moved to The Gramercy. YES! I had to drop by to see if it was still the DW I fell in love with before.

It definitely is. I dropped by for a nice, relaxing lunch after working 16 days straight. Vidal served me, and his personality is perfect for this industry. He is very knowledgeable about the wine selection and menus. I was stuck between the vegetable burger, the ahi tuna couscous salad, and the vegetable Jamaican curry. He recommended the curry and accommodated my extra spicy level request.

Delicious! The food here is just as good as I remembered. The Flavor of the spices in my couscous dish came out BEAUTIFULLY, and the heat level was perfect! Not unbearable, and matched with a Malbec, was just delicious!!

I asked my server for the bartender to create a delicious, weird, amazing cocktail to end my meal with. A little advice for people who ask servers and bartenders for a ""surprise"" cocktail, tell them what you like and absolutely cannot have in your drink. All I asked for was a cocktail that wasn't overly sweet, a little bit weird and off the wall, and absolutely no egg-whites because I do eat a vegetarian diet.

Bless Vidal, because he was so busy at the time, and he didn't hesitate nor express any annoyance at my request. The bartender made a great cocktail with tequila, a pomegranate tea, and some muddled ginger. Simple, tasty, and exactly fit what I ordered.

There are three things I rate restaurants on when I visit them. Ambience, Service, and Taste. DW has never disappointed me in these three key areas. I cannot wait to come back and try some more dishes and cocktails with such pleasant service.",fRF4w7Oe-zDmyjDGFoSYJQ,0,0,5,g5ULI9dnhlZfxfSx6b_VlA

I came to DW Bistro for their infamous brunch.  The restaurant is far from the strip, but it is one of those Vegas greats that should be worth the visit if you want to venture out of the hotel.  

On a Sunday at about 1:00pm, the place was packed.  Bottomless mimosas and great food with varieties from breakfast to lunch.   To begin, the wait staff are all tiop notch.  They are friendly and will help you with anything if you ask.  I had the egg sandwich which was cooked fantastically with awesome bread.  I also added some sausage to the sandwich which was also great.  The brunch was very affordable and their wine and beer list was pretty solid for the area.

The brunch seems like the best way to go for DW, but I'll be back to try regular menu in the future.  They do brunch on both Saturday and Sunday, and the waiters said anytime after about 11:00am gets super busy.

Opportunities: 
-Server had too many tables and his service was lacking. Too long to greet us. We were first timers and nothing was explained about what was on the menu.

I moved in to an apartment about a block away from here and in doing a little research I realized the chef had a New Mexican background.  I was so excited but also poor.  So we waited to go since it is not a cheap place.  I was starting to get worried we were building it up in our heads too much.  Well we finally got jobs and finally started to get paid so we went to celebrate.

The decor, as you have read in all the other reviews, is very eclectic, funky, but clean.  It's nice and the patio is my favorite part of it.  They do have a heater on the patio but it was so nice out we didn't need it.  The hostess was prompt and nice and our server was on top of things.  She greeted us right away and promptly offered us drinks.  I had a half bottle of gruet sparkling wine, a little New Mexico celebratory treat.  The cocktail of the day was a strawberry mojito and the boy enjoyed it.  

The bread service was nice, some of the breads were a little dry, but that's a problem with doing everything in house.  The lavash was super flavorful, I had one of their beer knots and a sweet/salty brioche bun.  All very flavorful if just a little on the dry side.  On too the food!

We had the ribs to start.  They were not a small portion for an appetizer.  The sauce was delicious and tangy and sticky and spicy.  The meat was super tender.  The boy ordered the chicken curry soup and the jerk pork shoulder bowl.  I had the green chile cheese burger.  This is where the OMG comes into play.  My burger might have been the best burger I have ever had.  The bun was deliciously toasted with butter, the meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly MR, the cheese and chiles were delicious, the bacon had been dusted with jalapeno powder and then it was all topped with a beautiful thick slice of heirloom tomato.  I mean.  Come on.  It was perfect and dirty and just made my day.  Plus it was served with sweet potato fries and they were crisp and cooked perfectly.  The jerk pork was also super flavorful and a hefty portion and was used as breakfast today and tasted just as good.

2. The regular tap water they serve at no charge is delicious filtered water. Tastes like bottled water.

3. At first glance you might think it's a little pricey, but nay! The portions are super generous. This isn't some foo-foo postage stamp portion bullshit for $16. You get a lot of good food.

My mom and I ordered their regular salad, which comes with pecans and orange slices. Delicious and very light, the dressing wasn't too powerful. She ordered the BBQ ribs appetizer - it was a huge portion and she couldn't even finish half. She said it was very spicy, but very flavorful and tender. I ordered the curry chicken bowl and it was soooo good. I like that the veggies aren't the boring, out-the-package stuff you get everywhere else. This was hand-cut, filled with greens and goodies, and there were no potatoes crowding out the good veggies (I hate potatoes, seriously, especially in curry). Again, a huge portion and I took over half of it home with me for lunch the next day.

Dessert was a delicious sampler platter of their homemade cakes - chocolate cake, banana creme, red velvet, and carrot. On the side were some fresh berries. Everything was surprisingly light, not your typical super dense cakes.

We left feeling totally full but not gross, which I know had to do with the overall fresh, light quality of their food.

We will be back for Saturday or Sunday brunch. Have you seen the brunch menu? Holy balls. I am going to die of delicious food overload, and it will have been worth it.",WylywSEkQqmNGYRQayihgA,4,1,5,bDuHNzjRnwlFVKazQzpfWw
3364442,2015-07-19,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"3.5 Stars if I could. Good service. Good food. The drinks are surprisingly pricey. $12-$14 for specialty cocktails. Which is usually not a big deal, when you're sitting on a real chair. Their chairs are plastic however... I think for the food price and style, the décor could be updated or improved. It has a very distinct café feel but they could have done better on the design choices. Anywho! Time for the food: 

Calamari to start. Very good. Sweet and spicy friend calamari with jerk seasoning. It was tasty and different. 

I ordered a salad to start my meal. It never showed up. I had to ask the food runner to check in on it for me when he delivered our meal. This was disappointing. When it arrived it was at least good. Good dressing. Mixed greens with goat cheese and candied nuts. 

For my meal, I ordered the short ribs. It came with the freshest vegetable medley I have ever had. Seasoned wonderfully and not over cooked. The mashed potatoes were also some of the best I have ever had. Simply seasoned with butter and garlic. The short ribs were served shredded and off the bone. I was surprised by that choice of presentation. In the past, I have had them on the bone. The other thing that bothered me was the large pieces of fat throughout. It was the kind that was like ""skin"". Not like marbling fat in a ribeye. Just big rectangular pieces of fat that were impossible to cut through. This is very disappointing. Someone should have trimmed this beef and known not to serve that to a customer. My dad ordered the jerk friend chicken. The cornbread was so amazing. The chicken was so spicy he could barely eat it, and the ""gravy"" was boring! No flavor at all. 

Overall, there were some very high points and they were unfortunately highlighted by some very low points. We will be back but we will know to plan our menu a little differently. Four of us ate, with cocktails, and an appetizer for $180. So with tip it was over to $50/person.",kmXn7iEJWGDGbWUiEmZ_kA,3,0,3,-7iGcl6bQPIGgg_sWy7bBg

We ordered the pesto torte ($11), chicken flautas ($10), and the pastry basket ($10). Even thinking back on it, I can't figure out which I liked best. The three of us then each ordered an entree. I got the jerk fried chicken and waffles ($17), one of my friends got the New-Jamaican Omelet ($14) and the other got the grilled chicken sandwich ($14). Everything tasted so different than what I've ever tried in Las Vegas. It is a New Mexico-Jamaican fusion style (what!?) that I really dig. The jerk chicken has a serious kick to it and really awakens the taste buds! We stuck to water because we didn't want to indulge in the $32 bottomless mimosas deal, although we wanted to. One qualm that we had was that our server seemed a bit scattered. He didn't come to check on us and forgot a couple of our requests until we managed to catch him a second time around.

For lunch, I had the couscous salad with perfectly prepared ahi tuna. It was incredible. My mom had the jerk chicken salad which was also good. Throughout our meal, we were check on a good amount and waters were always refilled. We probably should have stated that we were in a hurry at the beginning because they are willing to let you take your time. However, once we voiced this, they were attentive to our needs.

came in this morning and sat at the bar with the bartender San. My bf and i have been in search of a good brunch place in Vegas and we've found our new spot! the decor is simple modern and elegant. DW was also behind the bar and he was so humble and nice! 

I started out with a Strawberry Ginger drink (its on their specialty cocktail list) it was amazing! so refreshing. then i moved on to a Bloody Marry. Amazing! their Bloody Mary mix is made fresh and it has a jerk spice that really kicks up the classic cocktail. 

for Brunch i ordered a roasted veggie egg white omelet. by far the best omelet Ive ever had. Roasted squash, peppers, and potatoes. and the various hot sauces they have really made the dish! my bf had the turkey burger. the bread on the turkey burger was so light and fluffy it was so good! 

we finished our meal with a strawberry mojito, but instead of soda water San introduced us to a Jamaican Soda called Ting. its almost like a Squirt but far better!

They don't have a wine list here, but they will bring you samples of a few wines to try which was a very nice touch.  I think we sampled 4 different wines before choosing a bottle of the Dirt Red.  2 of the 3 us picked this as our favorite.

On to the food!  It was delicious!!  We started with appetizers - the curry soup, the house salad and the cream/goat cheese with pesto.  The soup was fantastic and the pesto was some of the best I've ever had.  You could tell it was fresh, not made with fillers and it was not nearly enough to go with the huge piece of cheese.  We asked for a little more pesto and our waiter brought a small dish with plenty for all of us.

For the main course, we had the vegetable curry, the jerk baked fried chicken and the shredded pork with red chiles.  Everything had great flavor and was a huge portion (we all brought home leftovers).  Our waiter forgot to bring our side of corn, but that was okay after we saw the size of our meals.  

We did splurge on dessert and went with the cake sampler platter; a slice of carrot, chocolate and red velvet cake.  Now for a sampler, we expected to each have a taste of each flavor, but nooooo, it seemed like there were 3 almost full slices of cake on the plate.  All the flavors were good, but not spectacular.

My first visit to DW was when they were located on Ft Apache. I was disappointed with the menu. I didn't find it very appealing. I ended up getting the roasted vegetable omelet. It was what I would expect from a Waffle House.  The service was slow and lackluster. People waiting for tables were lurching over us while we were eating. It was an uncomfortable experience. 

My second visit to DW was at the location on Russell in Gramercy. My friend wanted to go because he had a gift certificate. I was hesitant after my prior visit. He convinced me by saying that they had changed the menu and were under new management (I now think he was just trying to get me to go & had no insight on this one way or another). We arrived at around 11:30 on Sunday morning. There were about 40 people standing inside the door. There was no line. No way to tell where the hostess was hiding to get on a list. Many of the people waiting were standing next to the seated tables. My friends and I agreed that nothing they could serve would be worth dealing with this cluster f*ck. We left and went to Griddlecakes right down the street. That was the best decision that I made all week.

Food, was delicious. As a vegetarian, for dinner, my choices were limited, however, we able to get an appetizer to share. And I got an entree. For the app, we got the goat cheese torte. It was very good. As we were eating that, they came out with a basket for 4 or 5 different breads. Can you say YUM??? I'm new to curry, and the only vegetarian dish (if I remember correctly) was a vegetable curry over cous-cous. I am usually, and I stress usually, not a fan of cous-cous. When my giant bowl of curry vegetables and cous-cous came out, I was like.......oh. Not what I've been used to at Pan Asian. It was absolutely delicious. I mean, seriously, ab-so-freakin-lutely delicious. It had flavor and a touch of spice. And the vegetables, they were endless!!! Onions, cabbage, mushrooms, peppers, sooo many vegetables. And the cous-cous were so good. I guess the combination of curry sauce and cous-cous made it wonderful. It was a GIANT bowl of cous-cous (BTW, am I spelling that right?). I had lunch for the next 2 days. Both lunches were large portions too. For dessert we got the carrot cake. Not something I would usually order but the waitress treated us and WOW! We devoured that cake. It was like 3 layers and tons of yummy cream cheese (?), marscapone (?) cheese, I dont know. I know it was YUM! So, 5 stars for the food. And service was great. Oh, we also ordered the house ice-tea and it was pretty and delicious as well. So, service awesome. Before my ice tea ran out, it was refilled immediately. I didnt feel as though I was being stared at, as much as paid attention to. Very cool.

To start, a beef carpaccio that was rich and savory. Followed by a seafood gumbo was filled with crab meat and spices that warmed the soul. 

For entrees we shared their delicious signature salad featuring pecans, orange slices, and goat cheese that was lightly dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. Along with the salad, we dined on a medium rare filet with borderlaise sauce served over a heaping mound of blue cheese mashed potatoes, green beans, and tomatoes.

To finish the meal we had a piece of their house-made carrot cake with white chocolate shavings and fresh berries. It wasn't your typical carrot cake. It had a much lighter texture than the dense spice cake found elsewhere and it was a bit sweeter with the multiple layers of cream and the white chocolate. It definitely satisfied my inner fat kid.

The waiter then recommended the pastry basket because it has scones among other things. So we ordered the pastry basket and it came with one single scone. My friend complained and to their credit they comped the pastry basket.

The waiter wasn't very pleasant and seemed annoyed most of the time. He also poured half my beer on the table. I think the service was the worst part of brunch.

The dishes weren't anything to rave about. I had the jerk pork hash which had too much gristle for my taste and consequently made the potatoes greasy. Didn't come close to finishing it.

My wife ordered chilaquiles and she wasn't happy with it. Said the cheese was overpowering and she had maybe 4 bites.

We went on a weeknight and surprisingly the restaurant was full. Good sign. Even though they were full, service was top notch. Our waiter was very informative and attentive. The owner was so friendly and struck up a conversation with everyone in the restaurant, making the place feel like home.

They served an assortment of bread and the butter that accompanied it was so good! My husband ordered the New Mexican Style slow-cooked pork. I ordred the DW Fried Chicken. Both entrees were amazing and came in huge portions. I loved every single bite of my entree. The chicken was bursting with flavor and the gravy was the perfect accompaniment.  Normally I don't like cornbread but that was the best cornbread I ever had.

The owner advised us to save room for dessert and we were so glad we did. We were torn between the Red Velvet Cake and the Carrot Cake. We went with Red Velvet and the slice was enormous! It wasn't too sweet but it was a tad bit on the dry side... not a deal breaker though. We will definitely try the Carrot Cake next time.

I went this past weekend with a bunch of friends to celebrate my best friends birthday for brunch. I'm sure the staff will remember, we are quite the loud bunch. Anyways, firstly, the server seems to have an attitude. He wasn't very friendly, you could see the look on his face when he first came to our table he wasn't thrilled. Second, We all ordered bottomless Mimosas... which GOOD LAWD! $22 a person! Who do you think your ripping off here, my geeze! They didn't even bother to inform anyone of the price or bother to ask if we were aware, as I did not see it listed on the menu, but gladly brought one for everyone. Which my husband, normally wouldn't of even ordered that but he wasn't even asked. The second I got the bill I almost fainted. We went for brunch and walked out spending $100! The food is overly spicy for someone like me who doesn't eat much spice and really, I wasn't blow away by it but the price of the food wasn't that bad, so it is what it is.

It's one of those places where the owners take pride in their restaurant & make it worth the trip. AND, once you've gone a few times, you can brag to your friends that you know the owners. 

A few random observations: The atmosphere is trendy; there's a quaint outdoor eating area; they close early on Sundays & are closed altogether on Mondays which is unusual; the food is jerk-style, so if your sensitive on spicy food like me, your choices may be limited, however, if you're feeling extra picky, just ask & the chef will make something special just for you.

So we finally decided to give DW Bistro one more try for Marie's birthday a while back, again for Sunday Brunch and totally pushing my first visit experience aside, Wifey ordered the special Jerk Chicken Benedict and I went for the New Mexican Slow Cooked Pork Bowl.

The Jerk spices on the chicken got a little tiring with more bites, and the dry cornbread and soft boiled(again, not correctly poached) egg didn't make this dish any better. The pork bowl was huge in potion size, kinda like a Caribbean style loco-moco, full of spice, but lacking salt. I actually had to ask for the salt shaker and I'm not one to sprinkle additional salt on my food! 

Unfortunately, the company we had was much better than the food we ordered, and we had such a blast that our noise level got up to 100 decibels(yup,someone broke out a decibel meter on their smartphone!) and after 3 hours we got the boot. How?
Our waiter tells us ""My boss would like to offer you guys free Patron shots....out on the patio. Nice way of freeing up the tables...great, more alcohol knowing that a few people in our party were already plastered from unlimited mimosas inside.

3602987,2018-05-26,2,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Very hip and cosmopolitan dining experience in Las Vegas. Feels more like you are in Miami or San Diego.  Tropical and florid, the decor takes you away from the desert.  It appears to be influenced by one of the owner's Caribbean roots.  And that's a good thing. Yet, it is not shabby chic, but sophisticated.  The food is very thoughtfully and confidently prepared. Bold flavors and inventive takes on traditional favorites, like chilaquiles, breakfast burritos, tacos, and rice bowls.  Spicy is the order of the day! But not heat for heat's sake...it's slow-simmered flavor. My favorite is the New Mexican Spicy pork rice bowl with an egg on top.  Wow.  It's huge, and very satisfying.  You MUST try their Carrot Cake with what appears to be gold flakes.  Just do it.  Share it.  It's enormous...and worth the calories.

No one I've been with here has not enjoyed their meal--with one exception. But the owner came right over and gave my sister-in-law a different dish than the one she had misunderstood when she ordered. They have a full bar, too, in case you're wondering.  They have bottomless mimosas, and pair alcoholic drinks well with your food.  I don't spoil my appetite with drinking, but appreciate their effort. Price for food is what you expect for a high-end, well-executed, upscale brunch experience. I think this is a classic brunch place, although of course, I take it they do lunch and dinner, too. Another plus is just how diverse the crowd is here.  You almost never see so many people of different backgrounds in one place in Las Vegas.  This place looks like the United Nations, and seems as worldly.  Another good thing.

The lack of 5 stars: It's really, really busy.  Oh, yes, that's a good thing, and creates a very charged, exciting vibe.  But it's less fun when you're waiting for a table for brunch.  Sometimes you'd rather be at a place where you don't want to feel you have to be an ""A lister"" to get right in and eating.  (Not that they're like that. Seems the staff is fairly egalitarian).  But that's not necessarily DW Bistro's fault.  They can't help that they're popular.  They moved to this location to better accommodate their burgeoning fans.

From yelp we could see that they had a selection of unique-sounding eggs Benedict dishes. Parking at the Gramercy is pretty easy since it isn't insanely popular still. The bar is the first thing you see upon entering the restaurant and it's kind of stunning in its decor. I could definitely see it being a great place to stop just for a bite and drinks or just a few cocktails with friends or a date. The dining area is pretty spacious and simple, clean, nice. I ordered the bacon jalapeño Benedict, which had great flavors but came out cold. My BF got the salmon and spinach Benedict, which I think might be a certain taste (fish for breakfast? Haha). He said the salmon Benedict was good but he also said he'd give it three stars (haha). The potatoes that come with the meals are nothing to write home about; it would be cool if along with their unique breakfast selections they did some sort of potato that was also unique instead of just home fries, of which they do not give you many (but they're not great so didn't matter).

The salty crunch from the bacon paired well w/ the heat in bloody mary. 

DW has really nice patio seating area. However, we got indoor seating after the wait because we didn't have reservations.

DW delivers on all fronts! The ambiance and style are right on target.The food is top notch infused with an island twist on traditional menu items. The service is always warm, friendly, prompt, and sincere. 

Another bonus, you can bring your pup with you to dine on their patio (just call to see if they're busy ahead of time). Also, I know that they are well known for their amazing Sunday Brunch spread.

It was ok though, because this was the 1st time I had seen my friend Shirley since she had her baby Maksim, and he is as cute as the come!  So it gave us time to catch up.  :-) plus the food is AMAZING! Thanks Shirley for finding a gem of a place.

Perhaps it was the pretzel bread that clouded my judgement, but everything I had was super delicious and I'm eager to return to try more.  I order the veggie curry and a small house salad to start and Shirley had the Jerk Chicken.  Right after we ordered, several new tables came in and after waiting a little long for just a side salad, I couldn't help but wonder how long the entrees would be.  Just as I was about to track down the guy with the pretzel bread, my salad came.  I scarfed that down because the dressing was absolutely perfect. Then just as we all were getting a little antsy, the food finally came.  

I felt bad when my curry came out steaming and Shirley said her chicken was sort of cold.  We both agreed that it tasted good though, in fact the curry was down right delicious! The spice was spot on and having the option of couscous, instead of rice, was unexpected and appreciated.  It's texture with the creamieness of the curry, was almost dessert like.

Leftovers were my fiancés breakfast the next morning, :-) so now we both are curious to see what else DW has to offer, although I'm not sure the two of us will be as patient.",gFWmjc5UED8YaXFhZAm3qw,4,3,4,PGP-nSZDuP17D3GPfVmq8g

As a Las Vegas local I am always on the lookout for new restaurants and lounges to try that are off the strip. When I was first introduced to DW Bistro it was love at first bite! The restaurant has both inside and outside dining options. This is a big deal to me because I am someone who likes to sit outside and enjoy the nice Las Vegas weather when the extreme heat decides to give us a break. All of the staff is super friendly and great at remembering returning faces! Sometimes you can even catch the owners Dalton and Bryce in their visiting with customers!

DW Bistro has one of the best Sunday brunches in Las Vegas. It is so good the line often goes out the door! BUT have no fear, it's always a short wait and totally worth the mouth watering tease as you watch plates of Jamaican and New Mexican style food pass you by! Every meal I have had at DW Bistro has been an explosion of flavors and spices complimenting some of my favorite dishes. When it comes to breakfast I am a huge eggs benedict fan. When I saw that DW Bistro had eggs benedict on their menu I was very excited to try this. I asked if they could add some of their New Mexican style slow cooked pork that is simmered in New Mexican red chili on top of it and they gladly had no problem. It ended up being the best decision I have ever made. The mix of the red chili, tender pulled pork and hollandaise sauce made for one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. REMEMBER - The eggs benedict is on their menu but you have to ask for the New Mexican style slow cooked pork to be added.

Lunch is always something I have a hard time with as I am never really too hungry at lunch and seem to never be able to make up my mind on what I want. I decided to try their chicken flautas since they sounded so good and seemed like a small enough dish that I wouldn't leave feeling overly stuffed. When they brought me the dish I was very impressed! First, you could tell they put a lot of thought into the presentation which of course made for an awesome food porn Kodak moment! Second, the taste was out of this world. They drizzle fresh lime infused sour cream on top which taste delicious and add avocado tomatillo on top. I was very impressed.

When it comes to dinner DW Bistro will never let you down. From the Chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta to the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork, each meal is sure to pack flavor that will blow you out of this world. I went with the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork simmered in NM red chile. The bowl is served with over-easy eggs and rice with a fresh flour tortilla. The meal is a little large and I never finish it. There is so much flavor in the pork and the red chili that I didn't want to stop eating it.

If you are looking for a highly recommended local Las Vegas restaurant, with great prices, amazing service and food that is guaranteed to give you a whole new perspective on Jamaican and New Mexican style cuisine then DW Bistro is the place to go!

The good. Our waiter  named Vital, was super kind and informative he is a True Ace by far!

The Bad. It took forever to find the place because there were no proper signs leading to the actual store front , which made our initial impression extremely frustrating.

The Ugly. Moving from NY to Vegas we are constantly looking for great eats. I am Philipino and My husband is Jamaican and we specifically choose this restaurant because it said they specialized in carribean cuisine. 

Hubby ordered the coconut cury chicken bowl, it was so white-washed , forgive me for lack of a better term, but it was a True disappoint to Jamaican culture. They should have atleast advertised it as ""Jamaican STYLE"" curry chicken so it would at least soften the blow a little a bit lol...the portions were off, such tiny pieces of chicken and large amounts of zucchini and rice, it was just terrible, chicken was not the star of that dish at all!  

I ordered their Mexican Pork Bowl, this dish was one step away from being considered dog food. I never had dog food but I could imagine this being the equivalent to a spicy puppy chow. The sauce was completely overwhelming and the pork was soaked in it I thought it was a bowl of spaghetti sauce at first glance! The overwhelmingness of the sauce took away from any flavor that the pork even had. Please take this dish off the menu immediately before someone gets sick!....and to add insult to injury they served it with 2 flour tortillas in a cute little fancy basket and it wasn't even homemade tortillas!!! they plated a Walmart brand tortilla in a fancy basket and bam! 16 bucks in the garbage! Smh 

I am an excellent chef at home and often cater small events, if there's one thing I know, i know good food when i taste it, But this restaurant was a disgrace. I will not recommend this place to anyone until they revise the quality of their menu items. And one more word advice to the chef and owner, stick to one style of cuisine and master it! JAMIACAN n Mexican Food is not a good combination!!!  If you need good Jamaican food ideas or recipes please reach out to me, Oxtail is a fan favorite and I make it the best! LOL 

In closing I'd like to exit on a positive note, I conveyed my thoughts and concerns to my server Vital, and he was extremely receptive towards the criticism, he was a great listener, and was even thoughtful enough to bring out a complementary piece of cake to make up for the food. Its when you come across workers like that, that actually take the time out to pay attention to their customers, you know your establishment still has a fighting chance.

One of my favorites on their menu is their Truffle mac and cheese with bacon and mushrooms. This side dish blows my mind. The best mac and cheese ever! Please take my word and order it. Their jerk fried calamari is also excellent. 

All of their desserts are great except for their red velvet cake. It was incredibly dry and disappointing.

I will say that my special was kind of ridiculously priced for the amount of food I got. It was delicious but I did not think two teeny little eggie benedicts needed to be $16.

The service was great, especially considering the LOUDMOUTHS at our table :) :) 

I would definitely recommend the brunch, but you do have to get there early because there is a straight up Disneyland line to get in to the brunch.

3806126,2012-07-28,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Another place I can rave about the food and recommend to my friends who visit Las Vegas!  Situated on the west side of town in Summerlin (yes quite a far drive for those in Henderson, but well worth it!), they serve the most amazing food in Las Vegas for a decent price!  The ambiance is spectacular and makes the dining experience even more enjoyable!  

They are known for their curry chicken soup and mac and cheese, so what does my group of friends do?  We order those of course!  Any boy...each bite of that soup and mac and cheese was irresistible and we just wanted more!

Did you ask for bread to be paired with that soup?  Well you are in luck!  There are 4 types of bread to choose from!  And it just keeps coming!  I suggest to try all four at least once, but becareful not to stuff yourself in the beginning, because toward the end, you will be tooooo full to finish your meal!  

I ordered the special for that day, which was a seafood saffrin risotto.  I assumed that it would be small portions, but I sure made an ass out of myself!  I ate too much bread, and when the main course came, I was shocked at the portions they served at this type of restaurant!  (Shocked in a good way of course!)  The fish, scallop, and shrimp were cooked to perfection!  Very tender and moist, and seasoned very well!  

My friend got the braised ox tail which she really enjoyed.  I took a bit and my mouth was exploding in joy!  It was so flavorful with the red wine reduction flavor!  Very delicious!  

Just remember to save room for dessert!  Many to choose from and the perfect way to end a memorable meal!  Once again, we chose the special of the day, which was a chocolate brownie with cheese cake on top.  Do I need to say more?  haha.    

Another thing about DW Bistro is the awesome drink menu!  One thing I like about restaurants in Vegas is each has their own specialty drinks created by mixologists.  This restaurant has a jamaican theme to it, so they incorporated a lot of that into their drinks.  If you are a fan of mixology, definitely come down and try their specialties and fruit infused vodka!",n_UcypOj7YW8gdR43XIUSQ,1,0,5,3RA8dYrJGLhhvazIwdyF_A
3813904,2014-12-06,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I don't see the hype surrounding this place. My friends and coworkers are obsessed so I've had both the lunch and dinner menu and I'm sorry to say the emperor has no clothes. I'm not a picky eater and don't expect perfection, just better than what I'm going to do at home if I'm paying $15+ a dish. 

For lunch I had the jerk curry chicken bowl. I am a huge curried chicken fan, being of West Indian descent, so I was excited to try this dish. The curry didn't taste like much of anything and the boneless chicken was overcooked and tough. If you make your curried chicken right, the meat should be very tender and infused with the curry flavors. 

The night after a different group wanted to go for dinner. We had the plantain app, it had chunks of salt in the sauce that took away from the flavor of the cooked plantain.  I shared the garlic chicken on bowties pasta, cornbread, and Mac and cheese with ruffle oil, bacon, and mushroom w my friend. Again, the chicken was tough, though this sauce ok. The cornbread was inedible! Omg I don't even know how it was made to taste like that but it was not good. The mac and cheese, which is a side, was better than the main dish but not a reason for me to return. We also had the red velvet cake which was very pretty to look at but dry AND turned our tongues/mouths red after a few bites from the dye used - I know that's how the red coloration is obtained but I've never been dyed by this type of cake before. 

Overall it's a cute place to go for people watching and a drink (I didn't have any but again friends raved) but I will not be returning anytime soon nor will I bring visitors. I'll go if friends want to go and hopefully will find a well made dish worth the $14-$22 (not bad if it was good) but otherwise  I will be avoiding this place. I'm very surprised at the food quality here because so many picky people I know love it.. Maybe DW is banking on the majority of people not being familiar with Caribbean cooking and therefore able to get away with mediocre efforts but if you are then you will quickly see through the smoke (of the kitchen?!

My friends had eaten there before, but this was my first time. We ordered a few cocktails, mine was a mimosa. I thought the mimosa was perfectly portioned from sparkling wine to orange juice ratio. 

We all order salads, they all just looked so delicious that we couldn't pass them up. I ordered the Jerk Ahi Tuna Salad. I love spicy so it was perfect for me. My friend however, ordered the jerk shrimp salad and was wayyy to spicy for her. 

The only thing that was disappointing was the strong smell of cigarette smoke fuming off our server. This was very off putting! Everything seemed so clean and fresh that that scent sort of ruined it for me whenever he came over. Luckily my friends couldn't smell it, thought they were both sitting towards the window, and me the outside. 

I would love to come back here for bunch sometime.",9ARxqHzCnZ6pY1DmSGFqFg,1,3,4,UYWDTuS7nrFRehvEyU0QTQ

They know what they're doing. I had the Jamaican Curry chicken and it was a tongue tickling blend of chicken, vegetables, rice and curry. Loved the way the spicy sauce drenched the rice. And the ratio of ingredients were proportioned to perfection. Delicious! 

Cristina had the New Mexican style Pork and she was blown away. That New Mexican style red chili was on the money. The pork was lean and tender. And the eggs over easy was a nice touch! Now I never been to the the Land of Enchantment, but a couple bites of her dish and I felt like I was there. 

I loved all the hot sauces. I had that calypso sauce a long time ago over some Guyanese style Lo Mein. It just brought me back to my NJ/NY days where this cuisine is easier to find. Can't wait to go back and see what's up with the chicken and waffles. Only one suggestion, or a request actually...

We ordered the calamari with Jamaican spice as a shared appetizer, and this was my favorite dish of the night. The dish had a mix of sweet and savory, and it was full of flavor. Several folks in our group (including myself) ordered the New Mexico slow-roasted pork over rice for their entree and were surprised by how spicy it was. It had a good amount of heat and came in huge portions. I would definitely come back to this place and order the calamari again, but I'll probably pass on the pork.

It was so difficult to figure out what to order because everything sounded so good and looked so good going out!

First I tried the strawberry infused rum which was delicious and not too sweet at all. I did also have the strawberry Caribbean mojito drink (can't remember what it is called). It was good but I thought it had too much mint and strawberry pulp.

At the table for appetizers we had jerk calamari (not what I expected, kind of sweet), flautas (excellent) and a chorizo and shrimp dish (also delicious).

For entrees I had the special which was a pan-fried skin-on snapper with coconut rice and mango salsa (out of this world), hubby had jerk lamb chops which he loved, most had the ox tails (got rave reviews as did the spicy mashed potatoes), shrimp scampi and chicken pasta. Not one bad review at all with entrees.

We shared a slice of carrot cake among the table and it was delicious. The server brought us a slice of the most chocolaty cake that I have ever had on the house as well.

Upon walking into the restaurant my friend (Sheila A.) and I were a little bit confused because you immediately see a couch and a wooden cabinet, I honestly felt like we walked into a furniture store. Caught me a little off guard but then we saw the host and on the other side of the wall of the entrance was the bar. I notice the interior is modern (bright orange walls) with a few accent pieces wooden distressed furniture. We were seated and introduced to our server Luis. Calamari was our appetizer of choice and a few minutes later here is comes. I liked the taste of the breading and it was different, but Sheila did not expect what we were served. Luis asked us how it was going so far and as much as we hate sending things back to the kitchen, we sent it back and opted for flauntas instead. Luis was very accommodating and did not make this an issue at all. We were served the flautas, OMG they were amazing. I like to think of these as taquitos, but made with chicken. The tortilla that was used was delicious, I don't know if they make their own, but they taste just like Cafe Rio's tortillas and everyone knows Cafe Rio has amazing tortillas. Onto the entrees, I ordered the bow tie pasta with chicken, which this was really good too. The veggies were really fresh, I even love the fact the string beans were perfectly cooked because they still had the snap to them (I could tell they used the shocking method to cook them). Sheila ordered the slow cooked pork with egg. This dish had a little bit of heat to it and the dish itself was hot (temperature wise). Pretty good too, I could tell there were a number of spices in this dish. I think Sheila was sweating a bit from eating this dish, haha! Finally we were served a complimentary piece of the carrot cake, probably the best carrot cake I've ever had! The cake didn't have the typical cake texture, but was a bit more rough (in a good way). Possibly due to the amount of carrot they put in it. I also love the white chocolate shavings they trim the sides with. The best part is Luis said it was on the house since it was our first time at DW. 

This restaurant is truly something special. We need more spots like this around town because this restaurant has personality and serves great tasting food. Although the price point is a little higher, it is worth it. I will add that this restaurant is a wonderful option for a special occasion dinner or an intimate date. Finally, Luis was an awesome server, more people who work in customer service should be trained like him because he went above and beyond to make our experience at DW enjoyable.

The chef even came to our table to make sure everything was perfect, such a gentleman. His cooking skills are on point and theres a lot of jamaican influence which I'm sure is his background. Either way he does it extremely well. The flats are delicious and I would recommend to start off with those or the Turkey sliders to start. Don't get me started on the sweet potato fries. THEY WERE KILLER! Had to order another basket of them. The only thing I must say is that the bar was out of a lot of basic spirits or did not carry them at all.

It's $20 per person, and the servers are very generous. 

For lunch, when I went the second time we had a lot of New Mexican-style dishes. The appetizer we got was the DW Spanish Chorizo w/ shrimp. The chorizo was nicely cooked. The shrimp was perfect and I loved the bread it comes with, which you can use to dip in the lemony sauce. 

My sister had the New Mexican-Style slow-cooked pork. This is a bit spicy since it was simmered in red chile. It is served with two over-easy eggs and rice. I recommend adding a third egg if you really love the flavor of yoke over rice and pork. The dish is HUGE. So you can definitely share if you want to or take it home for leftovers. It is delicious and probably my favorite entree I had in this meal. 

I had the New Mexican-style green chile cheeseburger. I added avocado in it because I love avocado. The burger is really big and tall. I had to cut it up and even cut a portion of the top bun away just so I can eat it comfortably. The sweet potato fries taste surprisingly great with the burger. I would definitely come back here again. We had dessert. It was a cookie type cheesecake that was very rich. It seems the desserts change often so I am not sure if they will have it here when you go. 

Overall, the experience was very good. The ambiance was a bit loud. But I assume it is because it is so packed and busy because of the awesome service and food! The drinks are overpriced, except the bottomless mimosas on Sundays, but the food is reasonably priced and it comes in large portions. The service was great. On the weekends, there are themed dress-ups, which is always fun to see.

This review is for the Restaurant Week 2011 Breakfast.

This was my first visit to DW Bistro.  I've been going to try it but never thought about going there when I was thinking of a different place.  Restaurant Week 2011 gave me a great reason to go.

The breakfast menu (good only Saturday and Sunday) had 3 courses.  The first two courses had three choices each and the third course - dessert - no choice but you didn't need any choice.  More on that later.

For my first course, I chose the DW oatmeal with toasted coconut and cream.  There were fresh berries including blueberries, red and yellow raspberries, blackberries, and some currants.  The toasted coconut added a texture and flavor that made this a great dish.  4/5 rating.

For the second course, I asked the advice of my server and I went with the crab cake Eggs Benedict with spicy Hollandaise and breakfast potatoes.  The crab in the cake was excellent.  The spicy Hollandaise was great, and the house potatoes had a zing that made them very tasty when compared with the normal fried breakfast potatoes.  5/5 rating.

Dessert course -- talk about decadent!  As I said, there was no choice for the dessert course because it was a sampler of four of DW's desserts.  They were: Red Velvet cake, whipped peanut butter pie, lemon-lime pudding with one blueberry (neat presentation for this), and Jamaican black bottom banana cream pie.  5/5 rating.

Service:  My server was Maggie and I never had to sing ""Wake Up Maggie May.""  She was on top of everything including getting me a clean saucer and a clean up from some spilled coffee--without me asking.  She also recommended the crab Benedict because it's not available all the time but my other choice is on the regular menu.  That's what a good server does and Maggie was superb!

A few little minuses - the oatmeal could have been served a bit hotter; what ever happened to spoons in restaurants in Las Vegas?  Do we have a severe spoon shortage of which I'm unaware.  I didn't get one with my coffee, but I didn't need one as I drink it black.  She only knew I didn't need cream.  What about sweetener?; and, the noise level was a bit high for so few people there.  There is little wall covering to absorb the sounds.  It wasn't bothersome, but it was noticeable.

Now that I've been here, I know I'll be back for dinner and another breakfast to try the jerk pork hash.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,1,0,4,edTDB3ewB7YD0UP_Pc5Nwg

The appetizers I've had were all near perfect, especially the appetizer special Mac and cheese, which both of my other party members said was the greatest Mac and cheese they've ever had. 

The Jamaican curry soup is easily one of if not the best soup I've ever tasted. I generally like to try everything on the menu in each category, but thanks to that soup I won't be trying any specialty salads there anytime soon. 

For entrees I've tried both the jerk filet and jerk chicken breast. The filet was absolute perfection, I was able to easily cut through it with a butter knife(they gave me a steak knife, I was just testing it). The chicken was pretty good, although on a menu this awesome I don't think it's the right choice. The side sweet corn and truffle oil Mac and cheese was also very tasty.",1B65LAHB8Eeo6xcP4vbNhw,3,2,5,XKm07vbURNP__ujFd7M8DQ

I don't know how they do it but their service on a crazy busy Sunday is still top notch and consistent.  We learned from our first visit that arriving at 10:30-11:00 is a pain in the butt.  So we arrived at 10AM with the freshness.  

I've had two notable Sunday brunch meals so far here.  The first being a DW bowl of New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork simmered in New Mexican red chile;
with over-easy eggs and served with rice and the second being two filet mignon with eggs.  The filet mignon, off menu dish, is gooooood.  I'm surprised they didn't try to add their own spin or spice to it, very nice as to not destroy the integrity of the filet mignons.

My only gripe is the servers inability to split checks with big parties.  I think they can because they did last time so the one we had during my last visit could be a liar.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,2,3,4,A0wkbNSRmP6SSQq9qk_uCw
4014456,2015-02-11,4,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Wifey and I went to basically the other end of town for us, to dine with a friend on her birthday dinner at DW Bistro.  Nice place!

I can see why DW Bistro gets a lot of love.  It's a unique place in a corner of town!  Where else you gonna see Jamaica meeting New Mexico cuisine?  A rare mix that actually works with yummy results.  According to Yelpers this joint is all the rage for a weekend brunch.  Considering how sparse the choices are in the SW part of LV they are probably on point.  Me?  I don't do brunch much.  But oxtail?  Yeah, sign me up!

DW Bistro was more than half packed on a Tuesday night, good sign.  Our party was the biggest on in the restaurant by far, but many of the other tables were at capacity as well.  Looking at the surroundings, I had no clue of Jamaica or New Mexico in the mix.  Seems more Asian to me!  But nice and quaint place.  Upon sitting and getting our drink order in, I went straight for the menu.  

Yep, those who know me know exactly what I went for.  It was a near no-brainer.  Braised Oxtail ($20) with a veal demi glace, and mashed potato of the day.  That's what's up!  I couldn't wait for this!  My patience paid off.  This dish was very yummy!  Oxtail was tender, juicy, savory, sticky on the lips from all of that lovely collagen - just the way it should be!  Veal demi glace really gave it a good depth of flavor, and kept the meat moist while I was eating through the dish.  Great oxtail that was probably simmering for the better part of the day (or with a bit of cheating from a pressure cooker).  Had no problem licking this up!  My only minor gripe about this dish was the uninspiring mashed potatoes.  They were on the dry side, I was expecting more butter and cream with them as well as a lighter texture to go with the rich oxtail.  Instead the mashed potatoes were rather dense.  If I had my choice, since we're cooking with Jamaica...why not do it with classic rice & beans?  Now we're talking!  Only other complaint was the portion size, I'm a big boy so I'm looking for a big boy portion.  But for the money, this was probably the right size amount.

Wifey ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Scampi over Linguini ($20) with fresh parsley, lemon juice, crushed chili pepper, and fresh garlic.  I tried it and it was pretty good but I think the dish is lost in translation when trying to figure out it's Jamaican and New Mexican influence.  Tasted pretty much Italian to me.  We liked it, but it really wasn't what we were expecting the dish to be.  It was spicy though because of the chili pepper.  If we got it with the Jerk Chicken instead, I'm guessing it would have been more on that influence we were looking for.  But overall still a nice entrée.  

Big plus here for me?  That damn Jamaican Pickapeppa hot sauce!  It is the bomb diggety!  I love that hot sauce and glad DW Bistro added it to the tables.  It adds sweet & heat like no other.  I'd put that stuff on a Nike (preferably non-Jordans) and probably be able to take a bite.  A little dip with my oxtail was nice, real nice.  

Overall the experience at DW Bistro was excellent, food was tasty, service was excellent (though a tad slow with our large party), setting was nice.  I can see this place as a local hangout with friends enjoying a cocktail.  Relaxed but very hopping.

4017651,2012-01-30,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Probably eaten here eight more times since my previous reviews.  What can I say? It is the very first place to pop into my head whenever Sunday brunch or a nicer lunch is in the works.  

Brunch with the fam yesterday was a dreamy success as usual.  We started with a DW pastry basket.  It is a steal at $8. Everything inside is warm and buttery and just darn good on a Sunday morning: blueberry scones, turnovers, cranberry popovers, cinnamon roll and chocolate croissant.  They serve it with butter and a scrumptious jelly on the side.  

Dad struggles to fit the gargantuan BLT in his mouth gracefully but was pleased with it, nonetheless.  Hubby cleaned the plate on his nicoise salad.  The tuna looked awesome.  

I can't believe I haven't mentioned the very refreshing and tasty pomegranate iced tea.  It is lightly sweetened and very refreshing.  They keep your tall, pretty glass refilled too!

On our most recent ladies lunch, my co-diners were thrilled with a special of shell pasta, grilled chicken and veggies in a blue cheese sauce.  That's part of the fun of coming here!! Completely different specials every time.  Brunch yesterday boasted a special eggs Benedict on a country biscuit with a special sausage and a cognac sauce.  

The place is always jamming now...so glad they are successful and busy.   It is definitely 5 star worthy now.  Everyone is beyond friendly and things are flowing seamlessly.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,0,0,5,S2s7ddZ8r31_iMKndBsMnA

The service was top-notch- all of the servers were attentive and personable.  We started off with drinks-3 of us had the pomegranate iced tea- ( Re-Fresh-ing! )-my husband asked for a Guinness beer.  Server earned brownie points for asking whether my husband would prefer a chilled or room temperature glass.   

Two of us ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich with jalapeno bacon, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo accompanied by the DW salad or sweet potato fries (I chose the fries).  It was a perfect sandwich!  The fries were delicious and I am usually not a fan of SP fries.  My husband ordered the Chilaquiles  (white corn tortilla with chicken, Chilaquiles sauce, cheddar cheese, two eggs,  pico de gallo, lime infused sour cream, avocado tomatillo sauce and queso fresco).  He loved it but did say he would have declared it perfect if it had chunks of avocado instead of the sauce.  Our fourth person had the Caesar salad with chicken (whole romaine served with crostini, shaved parmesan, and DW signature Caesar 
dressing)- the server asked if our friend would like the romaine chopped beforehand- nice touch.  All of the food was plated beautifully (and had I not seen the over 500 pics already on Yelp I would have taken pics myself but my resolution for the year was to quit annoying my friends by insisting on photographing their food!)

We finished the meal with the  famous Carrot Cake.  It was beautifully presented and as good as every previous Yelper has claimed it to be.  I saw several other items I wanted to try so we will be back!!!

4039924,2017-05-04,3,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Goodness I really wanted to love this place, but maybe my hopes were too high? I have been wanting to try this place since starting on yelp years ago. I came in with high hopes to be completely honest. Maybe the years of hype just were too hard to live up to.

I chose DW Bistro as a brunch spot for my sister's birthday. 

The space is beautiful. It was a beautiful day and they have beautiful windows and lighting. The tables and chairs were too small, crowded, and uncomfortable. 

They had like an 80's party theme going on with super loud music and the staff dressed all crazy which initially put me off but I loved by the end. It was a fun atmosphere and vibe. It was like a party at 10am and the place was packed. 

Service was very slow which is 100% fine because it was busy however I didn't like how we never got appetizer plates at any point and the servers didn't clear our tables often enough. 

Anyways my main thing about the disappointment was the food was so mediocre. My party ordered: flautas appetizer, the cheese torte appetizer, New Mexico chili bowl, curry bowl, French toast, and chocolate chip pancakes.

The flautas app is three taquitos cut in half to make six servings. This is beautifully presented but so mediocre tasting. The filling was minimal, had no distinct taste, and I kid you not I had three pieces and only one had a chunk of chicken. 

The cheese torte was a ball of cheese served with som bread and crackers. The cheese ball was a good size but. think we had half the ball of cheese left with no more toast or crackers to eat it with. I liked this but it wasn't anything special.

The French toast was also basic as were the chocolate chip pancakes. 

The chili bowl was probably my favorite food item as the generous portion had lots of tender pieces of meat. I did however find the dish to be one note with no dimension to the flavor of the chili.

The curry bowl was vegetarian and had the best flavor out of any of the dishes. This I would recommend, but that's not saying much.

We did have a couple of cocktails that were delicious. The bloody Mary's were a hit and miss for me. Our server informed us that a Belvadere rep was present and offered us a round on the the rep. When our check came our original orders had a $4 up charge for Belvadere vodka. The Bloody Mary was $11 or $12 on the drink menu and there was an upcharge for Belvadere which we weren't made aware of at any point. Maybe I'm missing something but whatever. 

We did get a slice of carrot cake comped which I did appreciate however considering the unpleasant and disappointing visit it didn't make up for anything.

Overall I was beyond disappointed. At the price point I just expected way better food. I would not recommend this place for dining, but maybe for drinks at the bar. Maybe I just didn't order the right dishes, but this is a thumbs down for me.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,3,2,pFcAxEGqL9B2P09d_EnqoQ

Thankfully once we were seated, everything was great. An automatic 20% gratuity was added to our bills, which sometimes results in sub-par service, I am happy to say that was not the case with our group. 

Allison S.  and I decided to split two dishes because we were struggling to decide what to order. We had the chilaquiles as well as the special pulled pork eggs benedict: 

The eggs benedict was very tasty, you could tell that the english muffins used were made in house. I would have prefered a little more hollandaise sauce, and overall I felt that it was a rather small portion for the $18 price tag. 

The chilaquiles were fantastic. Not the most authentic chilaquiles I have had, but still so delicious. And a rather generous serving for the $15 price tag. 

I started out with a bloody mary ($12), which I enjoyed. A few members of our group went with the very tempting bottomless mimosas for $20, I had things I needed to get done later in the day so I could not be that indulgent. Instead, I ordered a latte after my drink, but it never came out, That is the sole service hiccup that I know of for our large group. 

I don't think I will subject myself to the uber-long wait for a large group to have Sunday brunch at DW Bistro again anytime soon., but the food was excellent so I am sure I will be back sometime soon to try some of the other items on the menu.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,5,5,4,-e5VhlxZiIm5bhjJkyTqfg
4053195,2013-04-15,10,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Where do I start with DW Bistro?  First of all DW has been a long time bookmark for me.  I never had the opportunity until recently with a bunch of Yelp peeps. Read the reviews and one thing in common with everyones review is the wait. So, if you're a patient person, DW's is worth if for you.  I'm one of those impatient people, but had no issues hanging out with a bunch of Yelp buds while our table was being prepared. 

Ambiance...so cool.  I love the decor, specifically the art pieces by Pamela Nielsen. One thing about the decor here is that it keeps you calm.  No angry colors anywhere in this joint.  However, the prices to these pieces are pretty expensive even with the DW discount.  If I ever was to meet that sugar mama, the artwork from Pamela Nielsen would be on my list of gifts.  So right now, it's just on my wish list.  But I did get her card for one of those ""I don't care about money"" days. 

Price is about right for the type of food this place serves.  Food presentation is the key to places like this and DW's definitely got this part right.  All their dishes are well portioned, meaning huge, and the presentation of each dish is prepped so nicely that it made it even tougher to eat.  But for someone like me, this wasn't going to be a problem since food is my number one priority. For brunch, I ended up getting their Filet Mignon and Eggs.  By the way, this dish is not on their normal menu.  This dish comes with two 4 oz filets, 2 eggs, and some bread.  I killed this meal with the quickness so it would be tough for me to say I didn't like it. I love me some red meat and red meat for brunch made meal #3 for the day just perfect. 

Service here is great considering how busy this place gets. We had a party of 10+ and our server dealt with us as best as he can.  Busy is an understatement here.  Yes, you have to get here before they open and line up.  We were one of the lucky ones to be here before opening and I really feel sorry for the folks that waited over an hour just to be seated.  Actually, I don't feel bad. Their bad for coming in late. 

PS:  Vanessa N shout out.  DW Bistro is super super super good.

For starters we always order the calamari.  I have never even liked calamari until I tried it here. It is a little spicy and sweet.  I just can't stop eating it. (As a tip, this does heat up nicely in the microwave the next day so we always order the full size instead of the half and take the extra home. I even ate it with scrambled eggs for breakfast one time and loved it!)
I love the infused vodkas and rum that they offer.  This varies seasonally.  There is usually my favorite, the triple berry.  At times, my waiter will suggest blending 2 different fusions for a nice surprise.  Yummy and strong martinis.
My meal is usually the salmon with rice and veggies. The fish is not fishy or spicy at all.  It is so tender, juicy and full of flavor.  I just love the seasoned veggies so much that many times, I will skip the rice and ask for double veggies. 
My son usually orders the special of the day.  I don't believe that he has ever ordered from the menu.  The special does not disappoint. The best were the pork chops.  If you are there when that is the special, you have go to order it! Many of the specials are spicy. If you don't like spicy food, just let your waiter know. They can adjust that in most meals.
I recently sampled the oxtail from a friends plate.  It was very good.  It just melted in my mouth.  It was paired with garlic mashed and veggies which were also delicious. No spice, just full flavor.
Dessert is always required for me at DW.  My personal favorites are the carrot cake and lime pudding.  The carrot cake is island style with coconut and macadamia nuts.  OMG! The lime pudding is unlike any that I have had before.  It is Dalton's secret award winning recipe.  It is light and refreshing and served with fresh berries.  The portion is just enough to be shared.  You will want to savor every bite of this.",HkwVxpcbX6fFlKMXNZCuNQ,0,0,5,J6o96gMWDnTVmG_Zk8eCFw

Upon entering the staff was very friendly, attentive, as well as helpful in my choices for dining and the generous smiles were a nice touch. The decor was like other said very classy, slightly sophisticated and clean and i could see myself back here for a light evening of drinks and appetizers by the bar or outside on the patio which is where i sat and had lunch. The menu isn't large but has a nice variety of offerings i chose the Curry Chicken and my associate ordered the salmon. Both came out nicely prepared and well presented, both tasted good but not anything outstanding in my eyes. I had a 7&7 although they had no Seagram's on the bar so i settled for Crown which a bar without Seagram's? And she had a pomegranate white tea that she said was excellent and looked eye pleasing as well. .
I did have a slight issue with my take out order which i needed to take back to my support staff at the office. I ordered two Romaine salads with jerk chicken and please note that if you order a salad here it will not be chopped unless specified, so keep this in mind especially when taking it back to the office where utensils like knives and such might not be available. Also keep in mind that if you season the chicken on your salads that there is an additional charge on that as well so just be aware of what you are paying when you are ordering as it seems if you deviate from the menu then there are additional fees which in some cases are understandable. Because of the confusion with the salads and the fact that they were un-chopped when taken back to the office the ability to enjoy and eat them just didnt happen. Disappointed i contact the restaurant who was more than helpful in seeing that my experience was a pleasant one and corrected the take out lunch problem and was very interested in feedback so that adjustments could be made to see that mistakes like this didnt happen again. I believe management and service like this is what keeps privately owned restaurants such as this in business as there is a more personable feel to the whole experience and because of this event and the way that they handled it i actually am even more interested in coming back because you can usually rest assure that they will do their best to see that you are pleased at DW.

I consider myself a foodie, I travel to eat, and I am most happiest when there is something beautifully presented that tastes as decadent as it looks. Food makes me happy. Real happy.  This place made me ecstatic.

We ordered the goat cheese app, and good-goat-cheese-loving-god! It was spectacular. Not too goat-y, not too warm or cold, drizzled with a few amazing toppings, and served with a few variety of toasty breads.  Really wonderful. I had goat cheese dreams last night, so dang good.

Secondly I ordered the veggie burger. The veggie burger was simple, but yet so decadent. Roasted veggies and an heirloom tomato on the most perfect bun one could ask for, with a light sauce from heaven. The textures, the tastes, holy heirloom tomato it was bomb. I challenge any meat eater to try this dish, there is nothing to not love on this plate. It was spectacular. The burger came served with sweet potato fries served with a spicy aioli, which were also incredible.

Lastly, the adult bevs. I ordered a frumpy glass of wine, but my dining partner ordered a Jamaican Mule, and I wished I had ordered the same thing. The Jamaican Mule is sweet, but not too sweet, a little minty, and really wonderful.

4117245,2013-04-24,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I have been meaning to write an outstanding review for DW since the first time that I went in for brunch last month.  This place was recommended to me numerous times and I desperately wanted to try the 'jalapeno bacon'.  Different circumstances (like the fact that they are closed on Monday's) kept preventing me from trying that glorious bacon but when I finally did - it was love at first taste.  I then went with friends for dinner the other night and just have to rave about the outstanding service and delicious food that night as well.  So this is a 2-part review:

Brunch: I went to brunch with my Dad on a Saturday morning and because we are early risers, we were in the parking lot 10 minutes before they opened.  I had already been warned that the place fills up fast and I couldn't stand to miss another brunch opportunity without trying this place out.  We both got a bloody Mary, where previously mentioned glorious bacon was had and solidified my belief that dreams do come true (atleast when it comes to food).  

The options on the menu are solid with the Caribbean influence apparent in the various flavors that are mentioned.  I went with the ""DW bowl of New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork"" and asked to substitute spinach for the rice. (In order to make the dish Paleo-friendly). HOLY! I don't know if I have ever had a brunch dish in my life that is more delicious than that bowl that was placed before me.  Between that and the additional side of jalapeno bacon that I ordered, I was in Paleo-foodie heaven.  My enjoyment of the dish was so apparent that one of the owners stopped me on the way out to comment on my clear satisfaction with my choice.  We shared a giggle in which I reassured him that when it came to food, I had no shame.  That interaction sealed the deal that DW would be my new favorite place to dine in Vegas.

Dinner: Impromptu dinner plans with fellow Paleo-eaters on a Saturday night lead us back to DW Bistro.  I was once again nervous that we would be faced with a hellacious wait but was pleasantly greeted by the second owner at the host stand who reassured me it wouldn't be long at all.  Our server (I never caught his name unfortunately) was equally as pleasant and very patient with our various modifications as the night went on.  My friends ordered the 'Hummingbird Carafe' which was presented beautifully and apparently extremely tasty.  I stuck with water and am so grateful for how quickly my glass was refilled every single time it was empty. For an appetizer we shared the ""DW Spanish chorizo with shrimp"" which I believe was consumed in a record 5 minutes flat.  I then was SO tempted to get the previously mentioned slow-cooked pork again, which also appears on their dinner menu. I knew I needed to try something different though so I went with the ""Pan seared salmon"" sans rice and sub extra veggies.  I'm not going to lie - it wasn't as mouth-gasmic as the slow-cooked pork but it was yummy.  The best part was the various farmer's market veggies that the salmon was served over.  

I can't recommend DW Bistro enough.  The staff seems happy, the owners are present, helpful and friendly and the food has yet to disappoint.",47-nM4VOQRwu86nJ4r3dEw,4,3,5,FJiUjCjnaS4rn4dFTHRfhg

However, I am happy to report that this place exceeded both of our expectations!  I called ahead to make a reservation for a Saturday night, but the hostess on the phone told me they only took reservations for parties of 8 people or more so keep note of that.  However she did tell me we would be able to walk right in and be seated (she was correct).  The restaurant was bright and airy with white walls, tables, chairs with orange accents thrown in.  It looked like they had two separate dining areas and a bar located towards the front.  Our server was extremely nice and personable.  When it came to ordering our food, my friend wanted to get the Jamaican curry chicken, however, our server informed us that there was a recall on all Jamaican curry so the dish wasn't available so keep that in mind.

We ordered:
-Jerk fried calamari ($14) - Absolutely delicious and generous portion size for an appetizer too!  It had a sweet and hot flavor to it, I think since they used the Jerk seasoning in this dish the calamari came out a lot darker than a traditional calamari dish.  Regardless it was tasty.  Our server actually forgot to put this in with the rest of our order so it came out a little after our main entrees, but he gave us 15% off of this dish because of it.     
-Jerk seared ahi tuna salad ($17) - Salad dressing was a refreshing and sweet citrus vinaigrette which went well with the seared ahi that had a nice spicy kick to it.  No complaints at all with this dish.   
-Chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta ($18) - My friend ordered this and it had a very generous serving of bowtie pasta with evenly distributed veggies and chicken.  I'm usually more of a fan of marinara sauce pastas, but the cream sauce they used with this was delicious.

4155661,2013-03-03,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Holy wow, HIPSTER CENTRAL!  

With that out of the way, hubby and I had brunch here last weekend.  It was super crowded and INCREDIBLY noisy inside.  There are no soft surfaces anywhere inside (hard floors, hard walls, no carpeting or rugs anywhere) so the sound just bounces and echoes and the volume goes up and UP.  And it's fairly small and cramped inside so that doesn't help.  There were a number of babies and young children and the noise was almost unbearable for me - but we stuck it out to try the food.

Anyway, after about a 15 minute wait (which isn't bad at brunch-time on a Saturday), we were taken back to our table.  It's a very nice place with ultra-hip(ster) decor - I was in sweats and a t-shirt so I felt a little under-dressed.  But the other patrons were mostly casual too so whatever.  I ordered the french toast and my hubby got the chocolate chip pancakes.  I was worried the wait for the food would be crazy since it was so crowded but the wait was normal and fine.  And the food looked gorgeous when it was served!  

Of course, it also tasted fantastic.  Definitely my new favorite French Toast meal.  It comes with fresh bananas and strawberries and they were perfection.  The toast is made from Challah bread and it was so good, I'm getting hungry thinking about it.   I could have died happy.  Only minor complaint is that, on its own, the dish doesn't come with anything savory.  So after a few minutes, all that sweetness can be a bit much.  I should have tried to order a side of bacon or an egg or something.  I really prefer breakfasts that are sweet and savory, like french toast with scrambled eggs.  I didn't try to order it so I dunno if they would do that but I would assume so.  Then it would have been perfect.  My husband had the same complaint with his chocolate chip pancakes.  They were good but it ended up being just too much sweetness.  Next time we'll try ordering with a couple of sides of bacon and eggs!

Overall, we enjoyed it and loved the food.  I was tired and really wanting to relax so I was a bit bummed by the high noise level - but again, I guess that's to be expected at that busy hour.  We will definitely be coming back for the French Toast again soon, but I think my very-favorite Vegas brunch place may remain Hash House A GoGo for now  (less hipster decor and vibe, more space to breathe and more menu options) :)",p0xGJ_-QMWF8Bp6uCC1j5g,0,0,4,4V9OO79kwFEPmzRQlszJWg

We were told about the ""specials"" they had, one of them being a breakfast burrito which was way over priced for $17.

I just want to mention that the food you get at DW is something you could get anywhere else but at a more reasonable price and without getting sick.

The worst part of this experience is that even though my husband and I ordered two totally different breakfasts we both got sick immediately after.

It was about 30 minutes after eating breakfast at DW that we both felt like we needed to run to the bathroom... and we did. This never happens to me or my husband, unless we have food that hasn't been cooked properly. 

The other thing that wasn't so great about DW was this time around was the service. Even though our waiter was very friendly, he was very slow. 

And there were a lot of very important details that were missing from our dining experience. There was no salt or pepper at the table and I wasn't offered butter or jam to go with my toast.

""All Day"" Mimosa deal, perfect for us functioning alcoholics. I went on a Sunday so I'm not sure if this deal exists every day of the week.

Awesome servers; friendly and on top of their game.

Cons: 
45 minute wait for a table. It was like waiting to get into a nightclub. The general vibe of this place is trendy and pretentious. I felt like I showed up to an American Apparel party uninvited.

If you do not want to get the ""All Day' mimosa deal (around $20something bucks), one mimosa is $13.00 and it's tiny. I totally expect those prices on the strip, but a local's place? Come on. (The bartender did not tell me about the ""All Day"" deal until I was charged for one mimosa. They should be in the habit of letting people know about the deal once a mimosa is ordered, if you ask me. But nobody has)

The food is alright (not amazing), but again, the prices are totally outrageous. Definitely not worth it. Next time, imma point my Ugg knock offs in a different direction.",wFL2RrJvTsOVRU6gnRd2WQ,1,2,2,DQ_9sUQGtUQfg57bzbBVjg

Having lived in Jamaica and been all over the Caribbean, I wasn't expecting to be wowed.  I would have been happy with a yum or 2.  

I was WOWed!! 

Ok let's just say that unless you are lunching at Sandy Lane on Barbados or the patio at Half Moon, the decor is not very Caribbean but this is Vegas and its upscale elegance that is cooling, calming and should be featured at the Hospitality Design Expo this week.  (love the bathroom, btw) 

The menu is just right for lunch.  Not so many choices that you are overwhelmed but just enough to make you go .. hmm do I want 1 of these, 2 of those etc.  

I had my heart set on the vegetarian curry while my son was jonesing for the curried chicken.  Since he is a big fan of spice, he got a side of jerk sauce.  We also had the pan seared salmon (not native of the Martha Brae) and the jerked shrimp salad.  

I could have nose dived into my curry bowl and lived happily ever after.  it was creamy, sweet and just a hint of curry. The vegetables were cooked to perfection and the chunks of onion and potato set off of the couscous.  Likewise the curry chicken bowl had huge chunks of white meat chicken, just the right amount of onion to highlight the curry and the couscous gave the dish some body.  It was an ample portion and we did get to-go boxes for a late night snack later. 

2 thumbs ups as well for the fish dishes and we shared our curries as well.  The jerked shrimp salad was accompanied by an avocado vinagrette that brought out all the flavors yet wasn't overpowering.  

While waiting for a 2go order we had dessert.  too many choices.  I was so tempted by the lime pudding but ended up with the chocolate mousse.  Much to my surprise they brought me the mini mousse, the lime pudding AND a pile of hand rolled truffles.  Gotta love a bistro that knows how to feed the phat chicks.  I had a truffle and a spoon of the pudding.  packed it all up and took it home.  

Note to Jamaicaphiles..they serve real D&G Ginger Beer bottled in Spanishtown, JA.

I love their sunday brunch, so after they moved, I was excited to go try it at their new place, first time going to the new place, drove the car and passed it, went through the whole center and still can't find it, because they don't even have a big sign either in the front or back of the new location.  It's still under construction at that time, ok that's fine....., so I said to myself I'll just come back again, later on I came back, drove right passed it again, after they've been open for almost 6 month, they still haven't put up a sign yet, however I see their neighbor ""Pinchy's taco"" sign, nice and clear, are they trying to hide it from their loyal customers? do they not want the locals to return? are they really that stingy that they can't even afford a sign? I love their brunch, but NO THANK YOU, not only it's consistently causing inconvenience for customers to find it, it seems they show no pride of their own restaurant for simply put up a big sign.

Past review:
I went there twice, once for brunch on Sunday, and once for lunch during weekday, I got really different experience and would recommend only go during sunday brunch.  Their brunch menu is very different and I love what I ordered so far.  But when I went during lunch time in weekday, for some reason everything feels so ""overpriced"", had a burger and a salad, and you'll be looking at about $17 per person(including tax and tip).....burger is soaked in sweet sauce I cannot even taste the meat....salad is good but the high price really is a downer.......",OmSz8hJI5tbG7Ww0Q9IkNQ,1,1,1,qS6rTBpEW8kdmbmPRJ5f_w

I think the saving grace for today's visit was the chocolate croissant! It was probably one of the best chocolate croissant's I've ever had. We decided to order the pastry basket (chocolate croissants and white chocolate blueberry scones) since the server highly recommended it.  I wanted to try the Pork Jerk Hash since Robyn L. recommended it. The fiancé went for the BLT. The pork was so dry that it was tough to chew....it was spicy too which was expected for a ""jerk"" style pork but it was too spicy for me. The BLT was huge!!!! Yet again it was super spicy, the chipotle mayo sauce made it so it was so spicy that I could barely eat it and I could feel my stomach lining burn. I wish they had a warning level of the spicyness like in Thai food. We only ate half of each our plates. Maybe I'm just not the type for Jamaican food, but when we came for dinner I did really enjoy it. I am disappointed after spending 40 dollars on brunch and feeling like I didn't have a satisfying meal. If I could just order the chocolate croissant I would come here everyday.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,2,2,3,TVQZIuqjPDMtnRZIeb7XQA

For dinner, the chorizo and shrimp appetizer is super good, as well as the dover sole puttanesca and the salmon, both incredibly fresh and flavorful. For brunch the chilaquiles and homemade scones are a must. Brunch is a particularly happening time to be there. I recommend ordering wine for dinner though, I have tried several of their cocktails and I didn't really love them. 

Any time you go, the owners Bryce and Dalton are helping out, greeting customers, refilling your mimosas 20 times, etc. They are super friendly, accesible hosts.

4263666,2016-01-04,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Overall, this was a great place for brunch. It's a fun atmosphere and the service was great. I'm giving it 4/5 stars simply because it was pretty expensive for Sunday brunch not on the strip. The food was good and the bottomless mimosas were strong, but they are also cheaper elsewhere. 

What we ordered: Jerk chicken and waffles, challah French toast, Jamaican Mule, and bottomless mimosas. The portions were very large and good in comparison to the prices. The jerk chicken was pretty spicy, which the waitress did tell me before ordering. We both really enjoyed our food. Overall: 4.5/5
Atmosphere and service: It was loud, but I really liked that. It gave it a really fun party atmosphere almost. It's certainly not a place to go and have a quiet Sunday morning conversation. The service staff was also great. We were told the wait was going to be about 20 minutes and it was only like 5. We also got our food incredibly fast, but the manager came by and told us to stay as long as we wanted, no rush sort of thing which was nice. Overall: 5/5
Would I go back: Yes, the menu had enough options that you could go back and not eat the same thing twice and during the week they have other options.
Would I recommend this to friends: Yes, it was a fun place to eat. Although I will say, that this is probably not the place for a family to go for Sunday breakfast. But that's just my personal opinion. DW Bistro was really good and you should definitely give it a try if you're in the neighborhood :)!",Wp6_Wa_ZgvqoZ6u2PHWI6w,0,0,4,4PaB-1M4XJtsD2YaCwUHdA

If you're a curry/chili/stew lover like myself, and also love your spice, this is THE dish that combines the awesome elements of all of them together in one. Not sure if that made sense. 

It had a kick to it, and with rice, oh-mah-gahhhhhhhd. And eggs? Oh-mah-gaaahhhhhd. What human being came up with this? Some genius, I say.

The jerk chicken and waffles were okay for me. I had the best jerk chicken of my life in Nassau, Bahamas, so my standard is a bit high here. This one was good, but not out of this world. 

I forget the third dish we ordered. That must mean it wasn't memorable.

Once we ordered drinks it took almost 20mins for them to be delivered.  We waited for over 45mins before our order was taken.  We had to go to the bar to get our own drink refills. When our food finally came out, it was less then desirable.  Uncooked bacon, salads that weren't ordered. A general sense of the staff not be organized.  We were pretty much ignored the whole time which amounted to over 2 hours.  Normally mints are provided with the check - we got none.  And when we did get our check there was a 20% gratuity added on.

For starters, we ordered the DW pastry basket and pesto torte, both of which were amazing. The pastries came out warm and the cream and goat cheese was so smooth. For entrees, I've had the jerk chicken and waffles and New Mexican-style slow cooked pork omelet. There's definitely a party vibe at this restaurant, so if you're looking for a quiet meal, this isn't for you.

Mini Corn tortilla - I got this and it was soooo yummy! the black beans were soooo good! I wish I had gotten some to go! very light, but fulfilling!

Chilaquiles - Amazing! so much flavor I can't explain!

Jerk pork hash - mmmmmmmm good! potatoes where great! the pork was so yummy and tender! My friend ate every bite of this! (she wants to marry the owner who thought of this awesomeness lol)

I have dined at this establishment a few times (I try to visit a place more than once before I give a complete assessment) and each time, I found the owners to be quite rude. I think that it is fantastic that they spend their days being visible and monitoring the quality of their product, but I think they need to look within. They do not greet guests, they do not inquire about your experience, and they do not even smile in your direction. Maybe I am asking too much and maybe they do not want my business, which I suppose is their right, but they have made me feel unwelcomed each time I walked through those doors.",jNigdUVeghcSgk9fmo4cBQ,0,0,2,1U1JK2DiS9KaAaSYO-tBtw

4284123,2016-12-13,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I was visiting a friend, and wondered about the brunch scene.  Coming from DC, the bar is already set pretty high. so what did Vegas have to offer for this?  In my research, I discovered this place.  Jamaican and Mexican food are two of my top favorite types of food... and to find a place that is a delicate balance of BOTH?  I had to take advantage of my few days in town.

I called ahead to see about reservations, but they only do that for larger parties.  So, we showed up and had to add our name to the list to get seated.... the waiting area was full, so we just had to stand around.  As we were waiting, I saw that some people had mimosas even though they weren't sat yet.  So I walked to the bar conveniently located next to the entrance we came in.  It's not that big, but I have seen smaller ones.  We asked the bartender if we could order our bottomless mimosas while waiting, and she kindly obliged!  While indulging, we got seated rather quickly... we were told it'd be 20-30 minutes, but it was barely 15.  

As we sat, it was almost time for mimosa refills.  The bottomless service was spot-on... we never had an empty glass for more than 2 minutes (if it even got empty, they would just come and refill too).  For food, I decided to order the jerk fried chicken & waffles & my friend got the DW breakfast sandwich.  Everything from the jerk flavor to the texture of the waffles to the compliment of the syrup made me very happy.  My friend spoke highly of his sandwich, and I did try a bit of the potatoes that it came with and enjoyed.  

I wish there was a bottomless food option to go with the bottomless mimosas.  There are just so many delicious looking entrees to try.  Next time, I hope to get the omelet that has jerk pork in it.",sRyNXAjlGWXOtX8KyzM8vw,2,0,5,C2cfDM9sDrzh_7wRJWV5TQ

Curry was too spicy for my taste buds. 
Ahi tuna also too spicy on salad.

The quality of tuna was superb! Something about the vinaigrette and tuna makes a perfect pair.  
We each had a slice of raspberry cheesecake i believe-UNBELIEVABLE. I'm actually craving a slice right now. 

My second visit was for brunch on a Sunday morning, the line was out the door! If you come as a duo, sit at the bar to avoid the table wait. They serve food at the bar as well. I tried the bloody mary with an order of chicken and waffles. Bloody mary was delicious! Very spicy and authentically made. I don't normally like bacon but the slice of bacon in the glass was perfect. Chicken and waffles were amazing. Chicken was moist and flavorful while the waffle was simple yet fluffy. I could only eat half my order. My friend ordered the mexican-style slow cooked pork bowl. It was so satisfying! More of a lunch items rather than brunch to me.

Our server, Ernie, was friendly and we chatted a bit about the fact that we had just moved into the neighborhood and that we were first-timers. He explained the menu and their specialties. We started with Garlic Shrimp & Chorizo Appetizer, Martini's and sparkling water. For entrees, Hubby ordered the Fried Chicken & Gravy and I ordered the Oxtail. We finished the appetizer and cocktails and waited. During that time, several tables were sat around us and those tables had received their entrees. I ordered a glass of wine to go with dinner and we waited some more. Finally, Ernie came back to the table and admitted that he forgot to put in our entree order and we needed to tell him what we had ordered again. He also said to save room for dessert because it was on them.

We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a huge deal. Ernie brought me a second glass of wine and said it was on the house. Our entrees finally came and both were delicious. I asked for some more sauce but it never arrived. Ernie did bring dessert as promised - chocolate cake. It was not anything to write home about and definitely not worth ordering again. I ordered a Chocolate Martini and it came with chocolate sauce drizzled around the rim...only problem is that it also dribbled down the side of the glass and was very sticky to drink. 

All in all, the food was delicious, the drinks and wine were good, the patio was wonderful but the service was below standard. We will go back for the food and hopefully get a different server.",C6kw0Rny7jZAGjTj0MWA3Q,1,0,3,a8ShYsGjqBvioazLZn5PdQ

We had quite an assortment of brunch food here but the star is definitely the curry with couscous. The menu says vegetable but I definitely tasted chunks of chicken with it. Great news considering I love meat but my conscience wants be more bio-sustainable. 

The rest of the menu here I would say is slightly above average. The chicken and waffle looked fantastic but cutting into it was a big disappointment because it was missing a *crunch* factor. Another disappointment is that the waiter asked if we wanted to start with a bread muffin assortment. Most brunch places I've been, offer that for free but upon careful inspection, there is a steep charge for it. So you may be suckered to say yes thinking it's free.

Yes the pricing seems $2-3 higher than it should be but that is nitpicking since the ambiance is quite unique for Vegas.

DW Bistro is another GREAT reason to rent a car for one day while taking a break from drinking/shopping/being hungover, and experiencing some really quality food.

The first thing you notice is the decor.  The design is very non-Vegas and is almost artistic.  It is a vibe that makes you want to sit, relax, eat good food, and have great conversations.  The vibe only sets the tone for the delicious food.

I was a part of a group of four that came for Sunday brunch.  Because there were so many of us, we got to try a lot of the menu.  

The Pesto Torte is a MUST item.  The cheese, crackers and pesto are so-damn-good-I-want-to-fly-to-Vegas-to-eat-now good.  

The Chicken Lollipops with Jerk Buttermilk sauce are amazing, and just the right size.  The sauce compliments the slight spice and smokiness of the chicken perfectly.

The New-Mexican Style Slow Cooked Pork is served over rice with an egg and is a gourmet version of the chili and rice all of use ate in school.  The pork is nice and tender with and is a great, hearty hangover dish.

The French Toast is nicely cooked and the highlight is the slightly spiced syrup.  (We killed the syrup and wiped the plate clean of it).

The best entree item was the Jerk Fried Chicken and Waffles.  If you have had the ones at Hash House, do yourself a favor and try these.  The slight spicyness from the jerk seasoning, the fluffy waffles, and the syrup all combine to create a symphony.  Hands downs, some delicious Chicken and Waffles.

Oh, and make sure to get the Bloody Mary with Bacon.  It is pretty damn good, especially with the bacon.  Be warned though, instead of a pimento in the olive, it is a chunk of habanero pepper, sure to wake you up and knock out any hangover.",TiWF94rl8Q6jqQf2YZSFPA,0,0,5,W5nemo_TPBobadOAXCnKxg

The food started off good - the scones were super moist and chewy. The chocolate croissant was super moist. They were a little a-traditional, but I was alright with that since sometimes scones are just too crunchy; but who turns down a flaky croissant?

The $20 bottomless mimosa was disappointing, and where the restaurant's charm was lost. It came in a carafe that the waiters carried around. Who knows how much/how little you are being skimped on when it comes to champs. There are a lot of places in Vegas I can drink for, and for a lot less. 

The chicken and waffles was interesting. It had a cajun flair to it, which provided a nice zing. The chicken however, was very moist and the breading was not as crunchy as I had hoped for. The syrup had a very vanilla taste to it, which was great. My partner was not impressed by his fishy eggs benedict.

4418182,2017-04-03,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"The most basic of basic brunches and it's worthy all basicness.

First time visiting for brunch since they moved locations. The new digs definitely accounts for the large influx of Sunday brunchers which helps a lot. No more one hour wait (for inside seating) to sip mimosas.. on a Sunday at 11am they had a few open tables for 2.. but if you want to sit outside (which is nicely shaded for the most part of the morning) you have to wait about 30 min. It's nice that you can start on your mimosa and bring it to any part of the open courtyard while you wait.. I anticipate the wait is longer than 30 mins though because it is bottomless and people just sit and chat (i.e. we did just that).

The energy is great.. service is to the point... although I think the drawing out of brunch is partly due to the fact that it takes a while for food to come out (to be expected). Also I'm not sure if they still do their themed brunches like they used to... but it's nice not having a DJ to compete with for loudness. 

PASTRIES were BOMB. Croissant and the scone were my favorite. You'll have a few to take home also.

Chilaquiles was better than I remember.

I was probably double the median age of most of the other customers in the place. It seemed like a bunch of young professionals getting started on their evening. The place has good energy.
I came knowing I wanted the New Mexico slow-cooked pork. The chef was born in Jamaica and grew up- in New Mexico. I wanted to try something Jamaican, so at my waiter's suggestion I got the curry soup. All were tasty. The pork was definitely tender and had a nice spicy flavor to it. This is a dish I highly recommend.
I also liked the curry chicken soup. Again, some nice, spicy flavors and tasty chunks of chicken, too.
I started with a fresh-squeezed lemonade and also got a drink called a Delicioso, which included Pisco. It was maybe a tad too sweet but I still liked it.
They brought me a complimentary slice of carrot cake. It was also well done. Nice presentation and the flavors were good.
Although it doesn't look like they have a lot of wine on the menu that is food friendly, I liked the wine menu. There were several things I wanted to drink.
Service was excellent.

I liked the decor for the most part except for the furniture. It reminds me of specialty convention furniture. It would be nice if they mixed in matched like kept the clear bar stools and traded in the white plastic chairs for something more comfortable. 

We started off with the DW Signature Salad ($9.00). It had baby greens, caramelized pecans, oranges, bell peppers, sprinkled with goat cheese and served with balsamic dressing. This was tasty and refreshing especially on a hot day. 

We then moved on to a starter while we waited for the main course. I chose the Chicken Flautas ($10.00) . If I could compare them to something I would compare it to a rolled taco but these are much bigger! It comes with lime infused sour cream, queso fresco, and pico de gallo. It's served on top of an avacado tomatillo sauce. These babies packed a crunch! 

I was skeptical about ordering the DW Vegtable Burger ($13.00). I didn't know what to expect but I was willing to give it a try. I'm glad I did because it was filled with flavor. It had grilled portobello mushrooms, grilled sqaush, heirloom tomatos with chipotle mayo. This can get messy so please remember to eat over the plate at all times. It was also served with some crispy sweet potato fries. 

I also had a Bloody Mary with my meal that came with a peice of bacon in it. It was okay but It was a little too salty. My Bloody Mary ranking would read as follows : PJ Clarkes, Hard Rock , then DW Bistro. 

The desert was fabulous it isn't your typical carrot cake. It had white chocolate shavings on the outside of it and had bits of exotic fruit in it. I can't remember which ones but this was the highlight of the meal for me. It was yummy!

The good. Our waiter  named Vital, was super kind and informative he is a True Ace by far!

The Bad. It took forever to find the place because there were no proper signs leading to the actual store front , which made our initial impression extremely frustrating.

The Ugly. Moving from NY to Vegas we are constantly looking for great eats. I am Philipino and My husband is Jamaican and we specifically choose this restaurant because it said they specialized in carribean cuisine. 

Hubby ordered the coconut cury chicken bowl, it was so white-washed , forgive me for lack of a better term, but it was a True disappoint to Jamaican culture. They should have atleast advertised it as ""Jamaican STYLE"" curry chicken so it would at least soften the blow a little a bit lol...the portions were off, such tiny pieces of chicken and large amounts of zucchini and rice, it was just terrible, chicken was not the star of that dish at all!  

I ordered their Mexican Pork Bowl, this dish was one step away from being considered dog food. I never had dog food but I could imagine this being the equivalent to a spicy puppy chow. The sauce was completely overwhelming and the pork was soaked in it I thought it was a bowl of spaghetti sauce at first glance! The overwhelmingness of the sauce took away from any flavor that the pork even had. Please take this dish off the menu immediately before someone gets sick!....and to add insult to injury they served it with 2 flour tortillas in a cute little fancy basket and it wasn't even homemade tortillas!!! they plated a Walmart brand tortilla in a fancy basket and bam! 16 bucks in the garbage! Smh 

I am an excellent chef at home and often cater small events, if there's one thing I know, i know good food when i taste it, But this restaurant was a disgrace. I will not recommend this place to anyone until they revise the quality of their menu items. And one more word advice to the chef and owner, stick to one style of cuisine and master it! JAMIACAN n Mexican Food is not a good combination!!!  If you need good Jamaican food ideas or recipes please reach out to me, Oxtail is a fan favorite and I make it the best! LOL 

In closing I'd like to exit on a positive note, I conveyed my thoughts and concerns to my server Vital, and he was extremely receptive towards the criticism, he was a great listener, and was even thoughtful enough to bring out a complementary piece of cake to make up for the food. Its when you come across workers like that, that actually take the time out to pay attention to their customers, you know your establishment still has a fighting chance.

Pastry basket is a must and can easily feed 4. We got a butter croissant, pain au chocolat, blueberry scones, and madelines shaped as mini muffins. The pain au chocolat was decadently delicious with semi melted chocolate, the madeline was perfect for dunking into coffee, and the blueberry scone was lovely and moist, but perhaps a little too sweet. The only thing missing from the basket was clotted cream. Scones are just not the same without clotted cream and it would have also balanced out the sweetness of the blueberry scone. I skipped the butter croissant as I also ordered the Challah French toast, which I really didn't need... I'm just a sucker for French toast.

The Challah French toast was fluffy and light, and again, probably enough to feed 4, but I ate it all by myself. I would have preferred the syrup on the side, but I didn't think to ask for it.

I told the server I was on a paleo diet and could not have any grains at all.  The dish I ordered came with either rice or quinoa and I told the server I did not desire either only but maybe more vegetables.  He said he understood but apparently he does not communicate with the kitchen.

My dish which was a chicken bowl came and as I started to eat the bowl of course I started with the veggies and chicken on top, I did not realize they put everything over rice.  When the server finally came back I told him I asked for no rice and they put rice in the dish.

His response, ""really, I put it in as extra veggies and did not check the rice or quinoa  so they should not have put any in.  I showed him there was rice in the dish and he said oh???

He did not offer to take it back and have it redone, he actually did not offer any solution he just stood there dumbfounded.....

I finally told him just to throw it in a box and I'll take it home.  This was clearly his mistake but he did not want to assume any responsibility.  Needless to say I took it home and threw it away.

If I decide to go back which I am sure I will,  I will ensure I do not get this guy as my server as he is obviously not as good as the other servers and he does not really put his heart into each and every customer.  If something is wrong, oh well....

The food is good, it is a cajun style so there is some spice to a lot of the dishes which I like and this place does get a great lunch crowd so the earlier you can get there before noon or after 1:30 the better off you will be otherwise you may be waiting for a table.  That says a lot about the place and the food, I just wish all servers could be on top of their game.  They do have some good one's there, today we ended up with a dud.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,1,0,2,8Z016Tgt9-4dlraYYZus3w

The jerk chicken wings and macaroni were exceptional!  Carrot cake is my all time favorite cake.  OMG, their carrot cake is best I've ever tasted within the United States!   

The general atmosphere was quite chill.  Unfortunately, the energy emitting from our balding, middle-aged, waiter was ALL WRONG.  Pretentious (?)... I don't know what his problem is, but, he needn't worry about me returning with anyone else.

DW Bistro is amazing on all levels; from the impeccable service, delicious food, and modern decor, DW is the model that all restaurants should strive for. Best of all, it's away from the strip and locally owned. 

My friend and I were immediately greeted and seated next to the window. After surveying the menu I decided to order a pastry basket, salmon and spinach eggs benedict, and a mimosa. The pastry basket was a lovely start. It came warm and I inhaled those carb morsels with a quickness. What diet? Carbs were my bff's at that moment. My favorites were the almond muffins and chocolate croissants. They also gave a small portion of fresh berries. Not sure if this is standard with the basket but it was a nice surprise. My eggs benedict was perfectly cooked and very satisfying. It was garlicky and moist but not doused in oil. A small side of potatoes was a nice sidekick to the dish but vaguely memorable. Mimosas are tad expensive ($12) but they were delightful relief after a night of drinking. Waters were quickly refilled and our server was great.

4562426,2012-10-14,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I think we found ourself a hip little bistro in the desert! Atmosphere here is very artsy, decoration shows that too. The staff here is wonderful and our server Lorenzo gets two thumbs up!! The owner is from Jamaica but raised in Mexico so that's how you see the variety in the menu. 

For drinks we started off with a Plum Rum on the rocks which had just the right amount of strong for my fiancé. I had a pineapple mango infused rum served as martini. Can you say refreshing?!!!

For appetizer we had Mac and cheese with bacon and mushrooms and shared also the Jamaican Curry soup just as recommended by other Yelpers.  The soup has just the right amount of spice to eat and you should definitely save your bread to dip in it. I will admit it was a bit too salty for our taste, but still we enjoyed the flavor. The soup is the same base that they use in the curry bowls so this is a good way to get a taste of the flavor in other dishes.

Mac and cheese with bacon was the best thing that was on the table. I must have ate too much because I definitely had very little room for my main dish. As a matter of fact I just recommend.

Fiancé ordered the Osso Bucco special because he can never resist Osso Bucco. I had to get the braised oxtail. 

Osso Bucco was up to standards in his taste, of course the best part of it was the marrow.  Meat was very soft and tender and you can taste the wine reduction. It was served with wild rice, but was nothing to his liking.

The portion for the braised oxtail was enormous.  I took my bite and was expecting more flavor, I thought it being braised I would have been more ""marinated"" in flavor.  The oxtail was topped on veggies and served with mash. I cared nothing for the mash, it tasted too earthy for me. Honestly they can do without the flowers in the food because had I not picked it out I would have been eating it... Not in my food please.

Since it was our first time there they served us a complimentary carrot cake.  That had white chocolate shavings on it, made it taste extra special.  

Three stars because my main dish wasn't all that.  Service and atmosphere was fantastic however.  Perhaps my next try ill get something that is more flavorful without the saltiness for flavor",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,3,1,3,YUDFDSjd4gpdKVVvQU3vVg

I have had their Bloody Mary which is gigantic and is served with a strip of Jalapeño Bacon. Um, what? Um, YES! SO GOOD! I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. EVERYTHING is delicious and the ambience of the place is awesome. Some days they play island-y reggae music and the other day they played 90's alternative.

None of us had been here before, and we were tired of eating at Asian restaurants... Because this was close by, we decided to check it out! At first impression, I loved the interior design: the light was pouring in perfectly. It was bright, contemporary, and very modern. My friends and I noticed that the patio outside was also very well-decorated and wondered what it'd look like at night. It also helped that the weather was perfect. The host that handed us the menus and seated us was very friendly! The ambiance was perfect and I loved the art on the walls. We were attended to immediately, and our server, Louis, was attentive and patient considering we were first timers. Our glasses were always filled! There were no long waits and our food came out pretty quickly. 

A friend of mine asked if they had tea and our server said they only had pomegranate iced tea. Because he didn't know what that was like, our server was kind enough to bring one for him to try and see if he'd like one. Here's what we ordered:

1. New Mexican style slow-cooked pork - Served eggs over easy, this slow cooked pork has the perfect texture and is jam-packed with heat! The portions are huge when you order bowls so you might want to share this one...
2. Jerk Chicken scampi over linguine - Their jerk chicken is absolutely delicious and the sauce was delish!!! The jerk chicken was a little too spicy for my friend, and our kind server (again, to the rescue) brought him a glass of milk. It helped him a lot!
3. Grilled Jerk chicken breast - One bite ensued a burst of flavor and harmonized well with the rice!
4. New Mexican style green chile cheeseburger - It was tasty! But I am not a fan of jalapenos...That's just me though.

Our server also gave us a complimentary slice of cake because we were first timers there! We chose red velvet and it was heavenly! He also mentioned that brunch here was big. I will definitely be coming back for it!",KAIG8_R5vcBt-CGUi4bkPA,1,1,4,vv1-1De1HgmI5o7CJAcSHA

First, they make some nice fresh ice teas here.  Very refreshing.

Onto the food:

Grilled plantains with honey - Very tasty, actually sweet and with a kick of spice to it too.

Jamaican Jerk Chicken Salad - Awesome!  The salad has a great citrus dressing with the fresh mix of vegetables.  The moist and flavorful jerk chicken is like icing on top of a cake!

Butterfish daily special with spicy aioli and fresh vegetables - Butterfish was grilled perfectly and melts in your mouth.  The grilled vegetables and roasted potatoes compliment it well.

Vegetable curry with cous cous - The curry is a bit sweet for my taste but that being said it does pair well with the vegetables and cous cous.

Chicken bow tie pasta - Overall the dish is pretty good, the best part is the pasta, vegetables, and sauce.  The chicken we had didn't have much flavor, but the pasta sauce helped carry it.

Jerk Chicken - The jerk chicken here is great, very moist and flavorful.  It does lean toward the spicier side, but I love spicy dishes so this was a great dish in my opinion.

Desserts here are always a joy:

Goatcheese Pumpkin cheesecake - At first it worried me that the goat cheese would overpower the pumpkin, it's definitely there but not as strong as you would think.  Pretty good for the most part.

Chocolate peanut butter cake - This is pretty awesome!  The peanut butter mousse is great and provides a lighter flavor to match the more dense chocolate cake.  Great taste!

Red Velvet cake - This wasn't bad, but a bit on the dry side for my taste when I got it.

Carrot Cake - Awesome!  Very flavorful!

Chocolate cake - Very decadent, but not bad.  I love chocolate so all those layers of chocolate just gel very well.

Service is really good here too, very attentive and they are all friendly.

My only recommendation to the restaurant is to review the placement of their loudspeakers.

The waitress replied by saying there was a private event going on and that we had to leave because they were closed. So my question is, why didn't you tell us that over the phone???

4702265,2013-11-13,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"This year, I've had the opportunity of eating brunch, lunch, and dinner here thus warranting an updated review. Overall, I love the location. It's less than ten minutes from my house and it's within walking distance from my parents' house. Extremely convenient. Also, parking is simple and it's easy to find. Can't ask for more. The food is different, delicious, and fun. Mostly simple and fresh. The atmosphere is hip, upscale, but still casual. Great for a quick lunch or a fun date night. Service is inconsistent. I've had really wonderful service and I've had just okay service. Everyone is really friendly and great. However, I felt they were too overwhelmed while busy during brunch and everyone needs to learn to be more aware and not ignore tables (no one would stop at our table or take our order until I stopped a hostess and we didn't get our seasonal fruit, even though everyone else around us did). And they kept hitting our chairs - I'm never sitting in the middle of the restaurant again.

My go-to brunch options:
NEW MEXICAN-STYLE SLOW COOKED PORK OMELET ($13): Great flavor in the pork with the New Mexican Red Chile and that's what really makes this dish, plus, the eggs are so fluffy! Finished with jack cheese. The breakfast potatoes are all right. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're flavorless. Not cool. I'd eat that pork any time and on anything though. JERK FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES ($15): The chicken is moist and the batter is great, but the jerk spices are VERY spicy! Thankfully, you have DW's signature maple syrup to cool you off. The waffles have a good batter and the crisp is good, but it's also a bit dry. Hard to eat a lot of it. DW NICOISE ($16): Wonderful assortment of fresh, delicious vegetables (haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, cherry heirloom tomatoes), fresh mango, hard boiled egg, and pan-seared fresh tuna. Brought together with a bed of greens and dijon champagne vinaigrette. Really great. FRESH BLUEBERRY & WHITE CHOCOLATE SCONES ($8): Really moist and flavorful. Delicious!

Lunch selections:
My favorite lunch selection is the DW BLT ($12) with jalapeno bacon, yellow heirloom tomato, lettuce, and chipotle mayo; served with sweet potato fries. Really delicious! If you want a light lunch option, the DW SIGNATURE SALAD ($9) with baby field greens, caramelized pecans, orange segments, seasonal bell peppers, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette, is nice and a great price.

Dinner favorites:
DW FRIED CHICKEN ($19) has the same jerk seasoned flour, but unlike brunch, it's served with housemade cornbread and jerk cream gravy. The cornbread is moist and gravy is delicious. Pretty spicy as well, so beware. VEGETABLE CURRY ($14) that has seasonal vegetables and served with rice or couscous. Really good. JAMAICAN CHICKEN CURRY SOUP ($7) is made with New Mexican green chile and jalapeno bacon. It's thick and filling. PAN SEARED SALMON ($22) is served with guava beurre blanc and DW house rice. Salmon is well-prepared, flavorful, love the sweet beurre blanc and it completes the dish. 

The only dish I've ever disliked was the JERK FRIED CALAMARI ($10 for half order). Jerk seasoned flour with a sweet chile glaze and sweet hot peppers. The calamari was not fresh, the size of dimes, and really tough. But with only one bad dish, I call dining here successful.

Also, make sure that you ask about their desserts because the menu is forever changing and always seasonal. Always delicious too. Most recently, I had their PUMPKIN GOAT CHEESE CAKE. So, so good. Great cinnamon, pumpkin flavors with punches of goat cheese. It had a graham cracker crust and dulce de leche topping. Deeeelicious. Grab a slice while you can!

Brunch is really popular because of their bottomless mimosa option ($20). They're extremely generous with the champagne and your glasses are constantly being filled. Once, we went when they opened at 10 am and it was already packed! So, weekend brunch is great, but tread carefully because it is VERY busy. Also, it is the one time they don't take reservations. I would recommend sitting at the bar. I had a wonderful experience when I did that.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,5,4,vncczhhFtgoOg6GF0LBtIg

We had reservations and came early to find they had our table ready. Unfortunately a few of our group did not show. Those who came loved the food. I only gave this a 4 because my salad was not the best. The tuna was excellent but it had too many salty items on the plate (lots of beans, olives, and a few other bland vegetables). The salad dressing was excellent. Other plates (salmon bowl, veggie burger, special bowl, sandwiches)  looked delicious.

We went for dinner. The items my boyfriend & I enjoyed were:

-chicken flautas (delicious - I was sad when we finished them)
-jerk chicken scampi (I wanted to lick the bowl clean afterwards - I didn't but I wanted to)
-chicken curry bowl (this was the boyfriends & he loved it - especially the variety of hot sauces on the table he could choose & pick from to add to it. I tasted it before the sauces - so good)
-carrot cake (this is where they were docked a star - it was not my favorite. I love carrot cake & the cake itself was good but the frosting was a little on the light handed side & couldn't be tasted through alllllllllll of the white chocolate curls it was covered with. If I could request no white chocolate on it, I'm betting I would've like it more.)
-lemon lime pudding (I only had a small bite & it was very good - the boyfriend didn't care for the dark chocolate truffles on the side but I was very happy to help with those.)
-iced tea (boyfriend got the house iced tea which was pomegranate, I believe - very good. Not overly sweet. Perfectly refreshing)
-blueberry-licious cocktail (I loved this one - sweet but not overly sweet)
-Jamaican mojito (good but the muddled berries kept clogging the straw - the taste was great though when I could drink it)

All in all, it was a delicious meal. The service was spectacular. We were attended to but not hovered over. Food came out hot & fresh, we never had empty glasses & everyone had a smile on their face.

I can't wait to go back. I want to give them a shot during brunch & again for a different dessert to see if the peanut butter chocolate pie is worthy enough to get them that last star!",vb4Y_Kw9JGS6DKgSQE_XrQ,0,0,4,i1VbaBN79P_HOEV7pU_Kxg
4721188,2012-09-29,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"We went in for brunch last Saturday based on other Yelpers reviews and were not dissapointed. 

The restraunt is tucked in a little strip mall in the Southwest part of town.The decor is clean and crisp with white walls and chairs with green and orange accents  throughout. There are also fresh flowers on each table, which was a nice touch.

I was a little worried about the service we would receive because the place definately gives off a hipster, trendy vibe (and I am neither), but the service was impecable. Our server was friendly and helpful. The guy that bussed our table was also very friendly and we never once had to ask for a refill, he was on it.

I splurged and had the Challah French Toast ($13) with fresh strawberries. The bread was cut in thick slices and cooked through so there were no soggy bits as sometimes happens with french toast. The best part about it was definately the vanilla infused syrup. The syrup had real vanilla infused in it and it really made the dish. The portion was more than enough for me to share and I still left one piece on the plate. I also had the pomegranate iced tea. I normally am not a fan of flavored teas, but this tea was delicious! It was lightly sweetened and refreshing.

My fiance had the Chicken and Waffles ($17). The chicken is definately what makes this dish. The chicken is jerk spiced fried chicken and it is delicious. It was cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful without being greasy. The waffle was somewhat of a dissapointment to my fiance. With all the flavor in the chicken he was hoping the waffle would have some flavor too. The waffle was your standard buttermilk waffle, still thick and yummy, just not a lot of flavor. I thought this was a good thing to highlight the flavor of the chicken. The dish was also served with the vanilla infused syrup and again the portion size was generous.

4759796,2016-07-29,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"After reading many of the reviews here, I was very excited to try DW Bistro, especially since I love Caribbean food, having traveled to Jamaica many times and having been so impressed by the food there. I'd been anticipating eating here for weeks. 

I want to make it clear that I can only judge this restaurant based on the three dishes I tried--the Jamaican Curry Chicken, the New Mexican-Style Slow-Cooked Pork and the Braised Short Rib, all off the dinner menu. For all I know, there are other dishes on the menu that are excellent, but I'm skeptical based on what I tried. Being 0/3 on those dishes is not suggestive of the rest of the menu being far better.

This is a tough review to write, because the owner was so friendly and truly seemed to take great care in his customers' experience. I felt I had to say something, however, as many people are going to try this place based on its stellar star rating, which unfortunately doesn't match the quality of its food by any stretch of the imagination.

If I were forced to come up with a basic summary to describe the food I ate at DW Bistro, it would be ""spicy blandness."" All three dishes we tried were shockingly devoid of rich flavor or brightness. The flavors were remarkably bland, and spiciness does not compensate for bland flavors. 

The presentation of the food was quite attractive, but, as they say, you can put lipstick on a pig [you know the rest]. In the case of the chicken curry, the presentation was so over the top that it actually hurt the food. I don't need flower petals sprinkled all over a bad curry. Just give me a good, honest Jamaican curried chicken and I'm happy. Putting flower petals and assorted vegetables on the curry only detracts from the eating experience, but even without this needless ""garbage"" sprinkled over the dish, it was phenomenally bland and devoid of flavor--and I say this as a curry fanatic who could eat chicken curries every day of his life and be happy.

The short rib and slow-cooked pork were equally bland and flavorless, despite their attractive presentation.

I don't want to rip this place and its very friendly owner without offering some constructive advice. My advice to you, if you're reading this, is to book a trip to Jamaica, go to Negril, stay on the cliffs and eat at the myriad of hole-in-the-wall restaurants serving stellar Jamaican fare, like Sips 'n Bites, Paco's, Three Dives, etc. Learn what great Caribbean food tastes like and figure out how to improve the quality of your food. It has no flavor! I hate to sound patronizing, but my girlfriend and I were frankly shocked at how bland the food was at DW, and, when combined with the rather high prices for off-the-Strip cuisine, it was a tremendously-disappointing experience.",c-YbKFuw-vhEOBLad_NMBA,1,0,1,CegxtW-zCgV1_GE8BUp4kQ

We were immediately seated - the space is very clean and spacious.  They staff was friendly, super nice and attentive - they provided excellent customer service.

Now onto the food:
The boyfriend and I shared the chicken flautas and the jerk pork hash.  The chicken flautas were amazing.  All the flavors and textures were balanced and it was a good sized appetizer to share with a group of 4 or even 6 people - though you would only get one piece if you shared with 5 other people.  It was a great appetizer to start with.  In addition, my friends enjoyed it so much that we had to order another one to share as a group.

We also decided to share the jerk pork hash.  We decided to order the full size because we thought it was going to be a small portion.  Boy, we sure were wrong about that.  When the meal came, we asked the server to place it in the middle.  We were wrong about that as well because when the server asked where to place the other half, we were dumbfounded.  When we were ordering, I briefly mentioned to our waiter that we were going to share the jerk pork hash.  He took it upon himself to have the kitchen do it for us and they plated it in two different plates.  It's such a small detail, but it surely impressed all of us.  The jerk pork hash had a little bit of a kick to it.  It was flavored well, the portion was huge for a half size, and when I kept digging further down in the bowl, I found the potatoes.  You would think that the potatoes would be mushy but they weren't, however, they were not crispy either.  

Overall, we were impressed by the portion of the meals, the flavors, and the service they provided.  If I was in the area again, I would come back to try other dishes.",pCvCL_lQDda2JI0OYTwgvw,1,1,4,uSV8nEylsYVyxWBMpFE2_A

LOL) This review is looooong overdue. I found DW Bistro pretty much when it first opened. Roughly a year and a half ago I want  to guess. When my boyfriend and I first started going we could always be seated, the owners always found the time to speak to us and the food was phenom from the get go!
  Fast forward a year and a half....forget being seated...this place has BLOWN UP!!! And while I'm so happy for them....I'm so not happy for me!! The weekends are always slammed....be prepared to wait!! Have one of their specialty bloody mary's and relax! Now...the owners will still come around and speak to everyone it seems, no matter how busy it gets! One of them is usually at the door, full of smiles and hospitality, while another is usually on the floor helping out and checking up on customers. Either way, I am so pleased with the boom in their business that has not changed!! I always feel so welcomed and at home because of these two men! You rock!!!
  Onto the service...overall excellent!!! When it first opened there was a waitress or two that weren't exactly.....ummmm.....on top of their game! But as of today, the service we get each time is pretty incredible  It seems, like the owners, the staff really take pride in the restaurant, the food and the experience we have there. It's rare! There is one waiter that my boyfriend and I have had a few times and unfortunately I haven't gotten his name (well....I have but have forgotten it cuz I'm terrible with names). I do know he used to be a busboy I believe and now is a waiter. He is so accommodating, on top of service and so friendly!!
  The best part....FOOD! Still rockin'!! Everything I've had has been good!! The pastry basket is a good way to start. Of course if it's just two of you either be very interested in alot of yummy carbs or in taking some home. The blueberry scones are my very favorite. Served with a nice homemade preserve, they melt in your mouth.  One of my favorite Latin breakfast dishes is chilaquilles.  I first had it years ago when an ex-boyfriends mom would make it for me and it was so good! It's very hard to find a restaurant that serves real chilaquilles. A lot serve what I call breakfast nachos, which are not chilaquilles. But DW does it right!! The tortillas are not crunchy, the chicken is moist and seasoned to perfection, the sauce on top is just the right spice and I always order with egg whites versus the sunny side up egg. Chicken and waffles, burger, eggs benedict, chicken flautas, the pork anything...gosh I could go on and on.  It's all amazing!!! And I feel like I've tried most of it! (moo..haha) 
  Bottom line: this place is 1) worth the drive if it is a drive for ya and 2) worth the wait if it's a busy Saturday or Sunday!!",f3ptgbODfNoKMDnSxOCj8A,3,1,5,L5DEVYryv6MtglSwD66xmQ

Was a little disappointed when the server came to the table and when I asked for regular iced tea they only some sweetened kind, but she made up for it by telling me that they had fresh lemonade which was delicious. Then another serve comes around with a basket of bread of two choices pretzel baguette or brioche bun that comes with a chipotle mango butter. I suggest the brioche bun it was delicious. 
    Now onto the food....
For an appetizer we had the pesto torte which was a creamy tower of goat cheese and cream cheese topped with a sweet chili sauce macadamia nuts and a little pesto served with crackers and lavosh on the side. And for someone who doesn't like goat cheese this was a great way to try it.
Though the menu isn't too big reading all the choices and descriptions can make it hard to decide since everything sounds so good and the server seemed to have raving reviews of everything on the menu which made it even harder lol. 
So when we did decided to order I went for the DW chicken because I tell myself if they have fried chicken and cornbread on their menu it better be as good as possible because I am very picky about my fried chicken and cornbread...and live up the the standard it did. The chicken has a kick but not too much and is simply served on top of a bed of satueed mixed vegetables with a huge chunk of cornbread which they top with melted honey butter and a bowl of gravy on the side. My mom got the New Mexico style chili pork which comes with 2 eggs on top whatever way you want them. It was a huge portion of slow cooked spicy pork on top of a bed of white rice. My aunt got the roasted garlic chicken pasta which was really light for a pasta that had a cream sauce. We purposely didn't finish dinner so we could have dessert and even though there was no menu the server recited all the wonderful choices from memory even the specials which sounded good but we opted for the jamaican carrot cake and was once again not disappointed in the least bit. The chunk of cake was so beautiful and so big that as good as it was we couldn't finish the whole thing amoung the three of us.
So to overview decor amazing, all three courses amazing, house made lemonade amazing, and service amazing. I will definitely make this a regular spot.",-Cr_udl8Bf-35w5E_5NoHA,1,0,4,pBsd1TyLzm9ubRJR-6j6SQ

I can't rightfully say that I've ever had Jamaican curry, but as a connoisseur of Thai curry, Indian curry and a lover of Jamaican jerk chicken-- it seemed like this was a safe bet.

The curry soup was very bland and It just wasn't good. I was left wanting some sort of sweetness, or tanginess, or something. It was just off and lacked any type of identifiable flavor (other than curry).

The Jamaican chicken curry bowl wasn't good either. It was just meh. All the ingredients seemed fresh and the chicken wasn't weird or anything-- it was just completely void of any flavor. It tasted like curry powder and nothing else. The chicken tasted like curry powder, the rice-- curry powder-- the zucchini-- curry powder.

I ordered the jerk chicken salad. First of all, the chicken was dry, second they don't trim their greens, third cold zucchini is never a good accoutrement for a salad. The dressing was bland, no acidity & no salt. The jerk scampi, too much lemon juice and the spice was strong. They should signify that on the menu as ""spicy"". I felt even though this was classified as a new American type bistro there was mostly Jamiacain influence which is fine but again it's about being up front w customers.

I dine at DW frequently and have never been unable to get exactly what I want from having a luke-warm meal sent back to be replaced with a fresh one piping hot.  To an order of sweet potato fries not being crunchy enough for me.  If one is unhappy and complains and gets no response from a wait staff, then one should go to a manager there are no less than 2 available and/or at least one of the owners floating about.  
As for the Food
Turkey Burger sublime
Carrot cake unfortunately I love it and my waist doesn't.  
Chicken Curry Bowl with a healthy amount of veggies, and an option of Israeli Couscous or rice (I love the couscous!)
Bloody Mary with Pepper bacon strips.... really you had me at bloody mary and a generous pour of vodka, then you added bacon to seal the deal!
Oh and not to mention one of the best Espresso Martinis I have ever had sans baileys or whipped cream.   
I believe the owners have gone out of their way to provide an upscale restaurant with moderate prices compared to the strip hotel restaurants, and that they do the Very Best they can  with a plethora of staff and all that goes with every personality of every patron walking into their establishment.   So to those who had less than a less than a favorable review I suggest going again and telling them ""at the door"" about the last time you were there & what the issues were.  The owners and staff truly want you to have a great experience, not a mediocre one.

Loved it to where I placed two orders of their red velvet for Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner.  Thanksgiving dinner was great.  Our friends who joined us for dinner loved the cake.  Then Christmas dinner, I placed another order.  It's a $60 plus tip, it's not a cheap cake.  It was completely different from the one I ordered 4 weeks before.  I was told the pastry chef isn't in town, but they will see if they can make it for me.  I was completely fine with, ""Sorry, we can't make it.""  I received a cake that looked nothing like the cake before, I was still hoping it will taste the same.  Well, surprise!  The cake mix wasn't even blended well, there were gray chucks there out the cake.  The inside of the cake wasn't even.  There was zero coconut flakes.  This was a very, very embarrassing cake to serve to my mother-in-law and my husband's family who all flew in from Paris the day before.  We were telling everyone how good this cake was.  I think you can imagine how disappointed I was.  I was so embarrassed and ended up baking cookies for them.  I bought back more than half of the cake to this place for a refund.  I got my refund.  I want nothing to do with this place for sure.  

It's really sad that the consistency of this place for us is zero star to 5 stars.  Even if consistency was a 3 stars, it would be much better than being super happy and then feeling like you've been robbed.  I posted here the cake I received before and the last one I got.

I came here with my future sis-in-law on Saturday. It was Mother's Day weekend so it was super packed. The wait was about 20 minutes. We grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited. The Jamaican Mojito (with guava) is delicious! My future SIL got the Paloma Sour and really enjoyed it. 

The flauta appetizer was good. It was perfect to share between two people. It had a nice spicy kick to it.

We both got the grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Sometimes I hesitate to order grilled chicken because it can be dry, but DW Bistro did not disappoint. The sweet potato fries were crispy and the chipotle mayo was delish. The bacon on the sandwich could have been a little more fresh. I highly recommend this sandwich if you want something a little lighter. 

Service was very friendly, but very very slow. There was a couple who was sitting next to us who were seated way before us but our orders were taken at the same time. We let our server know that we were in a rush and he was kind to bring the check to us as we received our food, but we had to go inside to track him down so he could take the payment.

I brought my parents here after having a great experience at brunch... Unfortunately, we did not have the same great experience. As soon as we sat down, the couple next to us warned us about the service and told us their food was not good. We wrote them off because we'd had nothing but good experiences here... Should have listened! 

I ordered the same thing as what prompted my initial rave review (red chile bowl) and it was TERRIBLE... Over-peppered to the point where I couldn't even eat it. Everyone else's meals were marginal at best for the prices. It's one thing to pay a pretty penny if the food is good... But if you don't even want to package the leftovers to take home, I'm saying ""NOPE."" 

I will note that I'm writing this review quite late... The time we had the poor experience was before they moved to their new location, so I'm not sure if the quality has improved. (I'm not in a rush to return to find out, though!)",MP9-7BEDPWMkQGkTK097zg,0,0,2,9WuQDlIGQhw2H1cR4t03Xw

The waiter was super helpful.  He explained to us that the chef was Jamaican who trained in New Mexico - thus the twist on Tex Mex menu and the AMAZING Jamaican chile sauces on the table.  These are to die for (in fact, we bought a couple bottles to take home, the Gingery Mango sauce was really special).  The waiter recommended several dishes, and so we ordered a bunch and had brunch family style.  It was a hit!

In order of yummines, must eats in BOLD:

CHILAQUILES - This was AMAZING!!!  I've only had this dish once before (and my Chinese family never), so the waiter described it as a quiche baked in tortillas.  It really was the hit of the table.  Especially with the mango sauce. 

PORK OMELETTE - This dish had a much fancier name on the menu, but GET IT.  A really yummy twist on an omelette with the shredded pork and spiciness.

CHICKEN and waffles - I bolded only the CHICKEN cuz it really was the star of the dish.  It is breaded in this jerk concoction, which is AMAZING.  The waffles were buttermilk, on the heavier side, and just Eh.  I think they might have a similar chicken dish for lunch (maybe on a salad?), that would be heaven.

PASTRY BASKET - The ladies really loved this.  A huge assortment of pastries - scones, croissants, cinnamon buns, etc.  There is a smaller $8 version on the menu, but this special $12 version was a huge hit.  Perfect with a cup of coffee.

French toast - Made with challah bread, so it was thick and soft.  The maple syrup is really tasty, but compared with the other dishes I mentioned above, this dish was just OK.

Chocolate chip pancakes - Really nothing special about this dish.

We had plans for a big dinner later on that night so we just wanted something to hold us over until then. 

The server was very nice and explained the menu to us and told us what items were her favorites. We decided on:
Chicken Flautas $10.. which were like taquitos but much much better.. loved the queso fresco and avocado tomatilla sauce that was drizzeled over the 6 pieces!
Ahi Tuna Salad $15... Loved the mixed greens and citrus vinaigrette that it came with.. The ahi tuna was not thinly sliced like I'm used to but came in like medallions.. So good!
Red Stripe Beer $5.. For my man.. He said he had to get Jamaican beer with his meal. lol
Jamaican Mojito $12.. was refreshing, delicious and I loved the presentation
Hot Sauces.. They have a lot and our nice server described each one for us.

We had eight people in our party making the wait for a table even more challenging.  The person (I think he is one of the owners) who checked us in was so friendly and welcoming that we trusted the fact he said it would not be too long, and he was correct.  DW Bistro has a pretty cool check in system that sends a text indicating your name has been recorded and when your table is ready. 

After being seated, they offer all you can drink mimosas for $20.  After a hectic weekend, we went with pomegranate iced teas, and one person had an amazing Bloody Mary.   The pomegranate iced tea was super refreshing, and the Bloody Mary was exciting.  The Bloody Mary comes with a garnish containing an olive, a pickle, and a piece of bacon...yes a piece of bacon.  There was certainly nothing boring or routine about the Bloody Mary. 

I started off with the Chicken Flautas as an appetizer.  The flautas were spicy enough, and the chicken inside was perfect.  The presentation was equally impressive.  My main course was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and Waffles with homemade syrup.  Do not be concerned when you see the coating around the chicken.  The coating is dark, thick, but it is so delicious.  The coating is complex and contains several Jamaican spices.  Others in our party went with the Eggs Benedict, and they indicated it was delicious as well.  The item is served on fresh biscuits and a side of potatoes.  In regards to the service, it is clearly five stars! 

If you find yourself in south Las Vegas near Summerlin, you must give DW Bistro a try.  On the other hand, if you need some time away from the strip, drive 15 minutes south and enjoy the unique dishes that DW Bistro has to offer.",o3Zv4AolGeRr-xX7QhESUg,24,25,5,teYNAqHKIKxhC38xJ0cbPw

Luckily we were able to grab three seats right away at the bar to get started on our bottomless mimosas while we waited for a table. The bartenders were so busy but very nice. They kept our champagne glasses constantly filled. We were originally told 60 min, but we were called within 30, which was fortunate since we were drinking those mimosas extra fast on empty stomachs.

Once we were seated, they kept the mimosas coming. We never had to wait. The service is impeccable!  I can't remember what my friends ordered (maybe I was that drunk?), but I ordered the eggs benedict.  The only problem was that there were options which I thought were add-ons, but they were actually ""instead of"" options.  So I ordered sausage, thinking I'd get sausage on the side, but when my eggs benedict came, they had replaced my ham with the sausage. The sausage did not go at all with the benedict and were actually my least favorite part of the meal.  Everything else was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise was subtle and buttery, and the muffins were toasted and fluffy.

Now the entree. Lamb chops were 'ok', but not 'out of this world'. Certainly nothing I'd return for. The potatoes and vegetables served were tepid. The potato texture reminded me of kindergarten glue. Just awful - inedible.

I prefer doing brunch here but came for a late lunch my last visit and had a chance to try the chicken salad and  curry..and it was delicious.

Every drink I've tried has always been really tasty. The food is always delicious. My favorite and something I order every time I go whether it's brunch or dinner are the flautas. They are a light crunchy little app that's packed with so much flavor. It's a great way to start any meal there. Anything with their jerk fried chicken is amazing as well. It has the perfect amount of spice. This was the first time I've tried chicken and waffles and I was extremely surprised and satisfied. It's the perfect meal to mix sweet, salty, spicy, soft and crunchy. And the chicken is so tender and juicy. They also have bottomless mimosas for brunch and they don't skimp on the refills.",UgYG3TgJocOM-HZ2-VE6zg,1,1,5,YmkX-HNut4zZal41HLQSbA

Our first time at dw bistro we went in for dinner. It was quiet and intimate. We ordered an appetizer which was the jerk calamari, one of their most popular apps.. It was ok, but we couldnt eat the whole thing... the sauce was slightly thick for my taste. But my dinner was absolutely amazing! I got the jerk chicken curry bowl with couscous and wow, first of all it was huge I could hardly put a dent in it but I couldn't stop eating it. It was so flavorful and they incorporated so many different vegetables into it. I loved it...

2 days later we went back with a group of 8 for brunch... There was a 30 minute wait, not sure why bc there were several open seats on the patio that could have been pushed together, but it was worth the wait. Great breakfast, amazinggggggg bloody Mary's mmmmm super spicy I was in love, bottomless mimosas for $20 - can't beat that. I had a special which was the southwest omelette and it was great and once again huge!!! Couldn't finish it. Their breakfast potatoes were way too salty for me though. I loved the huge texas toast they served with my meal though. Tasted very fresh. They also brought out the basket of pastries, yum! And everyone had a great time. It has a very positive upbeat feel. We have already recommended it to friends and family and will absolutely be back! A vegas gem!",mRD8eF_TkCZFqsvrBrHbHg,0,0,4,t0XfbmDdzvDIjsod7-RtiQ

We were absolutely delighted by everything we encountered in this restaurant.  The ambience, friendliness of staff, service, and most of all, the food were amazing.  We literally could not stop talking about it long after we had left the restaurant.  Between the four of us we ordered the Fried Chicken, Turkey Sliders, New Mexican style slow cooked pork, and the Beer Braised Short Rib.  All four of us tried each dish and this is the first time I have ever been to a restaurant where all the dishes at the table were as outstanding as the next.  I had the pork and could not stop eating it.  It was so tender and so flavorful and all of the deliciousness of it was soaked up by the rice and made it the best rice I have ever eaten.  It was hard to finish for the fact that I was stealing bites of my wife's corbread, which was amazing in itself!

The customer service is superb. The waiters take the time to have small conversations here and there. They check on you enough to not be annoying and interruptive. 

I ordered the Jerk Fried Chicken with waffles. It was a generous portion. My man ordered the Mexican stew with eggs on top. We both had no complaints and pretty much devoured our plates. The only thing I wish was improved was the waffles. I like when the exterior is a bit crunchy. We liked that they brought out little complimentary fruit cups before our meal. The prices are very reasonable. We paid below 30 bucks!

I'm giving this place ZERO stars because of the service... not the food. Here's what happened: Arrived at 7pm on Saturday and ordered a salad and two meals at 7:12pm. Everything went downhill from there. It took 40 minutes to get our salad and that was after we had asked our waiter about it. We got 1 serving of bread and our glasses refilled once with water. I watched 4 tables seated while we were waiting and order their food. Of the four, 3 got their dinners before we did, one of which sat next to us. Now to be fair, these people had been seated prior to us, but had ordered after we had. All in all, I watched 10 people who came in and ordered after we did get their meals. I mentioned something to the server and nothing was done. I stood up to leave at 8:23 and we still haven't received our dinners. The waiter kept blaming the cook, which pissed me off even more. In all honesty, it's managements fault for not being properly staffed and the wait staff for not informing customers of a delay. They should have recognized there was a problem and address it. Offer a free cocktail or something. I don't drink, but I'm sure other patrons would appreciate the offer. The thing was, nothing was done in the matter other than trying to put the blame solely on the chef.",Sgsdctj3N6ZsjcFIQIHKjA,0,0,1,Supzi8xlvmySe6hXnkPLMQ

The chicken was served on top of waffles with a side of allspice-flavored syrup.  The waffles and the chicken were OK, but definitely not 5 star worthy.

It seemed that many other diners at the restaurant were nursing their hangovers with bottomless mimosas and other cocktails (The bloody marys looked pretty good).

-- Eggs Benedict with cognac infused sausage - DELISH and comes with a little side of potatoes
-- Jalapeno Bacon - you must at least order it as a side (they also make their BLT's with it and it is AMAZING too)!!
-- Fried Chicken and Waffles - The chicken is juicy and tender and the waffles are light and crisp
-- Chilaquiles - First time I ever tried them was here and it was very good!!  Have had them since at other places, and this still reigns supreme 
-- Drinks - Make sure that you try their Bloody Mary's - they are good and have all the fruit and veggies and a nice slice of Jalapeno Bacon in it (they also used to have a Habanero stuffed olive that they would put in there too, although I think they stopped that....but be on the safe side and check to make sure....don't make the mistake I had and innocently just pop one in your mouth) and their Homemade Marinated Vodkas and Rums!!!",E7x6hdEptNRlcTsgFpC5Kw,1,1,5,9Qtr7gskD_JzEXbTNwr70Q

5016723,2014-09-23,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"It was fellow Yelper Jessica M's birthday and it was decided that we were going to check out DW Bistro. Since we were a large group of about 10 (All of us Yelpers) we tried to get a reservation. But we were informed that they ""Don't do reservations."" So it resulted in an hour & a half wait!! If it hadn't been her bday I totally would have gone some place else. There was no real place to sit down and wait either cause there were to many people already waiting.

We were all starving and thirsty by the time they finally called our name. We were seated at a table in the far back of the restaurant right next to the bathrooms and the kitchen. I was so happy when the waiter came around to fill water glasses and take drink orders. I really wanted the bottomless mimosas like the majority of our group ordered, but I was on a tight budget. Instead I went with a not to spicy Bloody Mary. Yum! It came with crispy bacon, green olives, a wedge of lime, and (my favorite) a dill pickle! Jessie B and I were sharing a menu and could not decide on what to order. Everything on the menu sounded good cause we were so hungry. When the waiter came back out we asked what were the specials for the day. Jessie and I immediately looked at each other and said we so need to get the New Mexico pulled pork Benedict with spicy Hatch Chili Hollandaise sauce. Dyanna L and her man Brent over heard us and asked if we wanted to all get different things and share. I was all in! I love getting to try ALL the things. So we decided on the Special Benedict, Chiliqulies, and the New Mexico pulled pork Hash with scrambled eggs. Wow! If I could rate the food alone I'd give them 5 stars. Let's start with the Benedict. The English muffin is homemade which I loved. It also was very light and fluffy. I could cut through the muffin with my fork and normally that doesn't happen. The English muffin was piled high with tasty pork and topped with poached eggs and had a dab of spicy Hollandaise sauce on each egg. I wish it had more Hollandaise sauce cause the little bit that was on there had a great spicy flavor. It was served with maybe 6 pieces of potato and a cup of fruit. (Which was tainted with pineapple. Not a fan.) Next the Chiliqulies!! Omg yum!!! If you've never had Chiliqulies it's like a breakfast nachos. I loved their enchilada sauce! It really tied the whole dish together. By this time I was starting to fill up!! I did take a couple bites of the pork Hash. The pork meat was tender and full of flavor. I enjoyed the spice from the Hatch chiles. Vanessa N offered us all a taste of her Veggie Curry. Yummy! I really enjoyed that. 

Now let's talk service. It was pretty spotty. The waiter seemed almost annoyed that we were there. He asked if we wanted more drinks and Jessie asked for a vanilla latte, but it never came! When Niyen was asking our waiter if he could have Jessica's bill put on his bill the waiter acted all in a huff about it. Jessica was given a free birthday piece of Carrot Cake that was soooo good! 

As long as Jessica had a good time at her bday brunch is all that matters. But I was way disappointed in the rules of ""no reservations"" and the waiter with an attitude. Since DW is on the other side of the world from where I live I wouldn't go out of my to stop back in. It pains me to give DW Bistro 3 stars cause the food was a 5. Perk up DW!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,1,0,3,078IlvApO0k3xxLDAcZG9Q

I don't have Caribbean cuisine often, well, hardly ever so it was a nice change and twist of flavors for me. I've come to find that ""Jerk"" anything is pretty much an awesome flavor. The interior design is adorable. The colors are bright and open. Although it's not a big space in the main dining area the orange splashed on the walls makes it appear more open. The furniture is cute and the hanging starry lamps and nook area with seating as well as cabinet fixtures - all cute, if you're someone that appreciates the environment you dine in. They also have an outdoor seating area which I noticed is very popular and has cute lighting as well. 

For drinks my friend and I each had an iced white pomegranate tea. Sooo good! It's super light and fresh. There are so many delicious sounding items on the menu so it was really hard for us to narrow down our choices. 

We ordered the calamari to share - perfectly cooked, it was tender and had the perfect amount of breading on it. We also shared the spanish chorizo and shrimp. The chorizo pieces were okay, a little chewy but still good flavor-wise. The shrimp pieces were fairly large for the dish and really good! 

For dinner we had the grilled jerk chicken with seasoned vegetables, rice, and a side of the Mac and cheese with truffle oil, bacon and mushrooms (this side is a huge portion!). All of our dishes were well-made and absolutely delicious. 

The best part of our dinner was the decadent house made carrot cake slice with white chocolate pieces. Free for all first timers that dine here. It was such a nice treat! 

We ended up talking with the owner of the restaurant a lot, Bryce. As he came by and checked up on us more often than any other owner of a restaurant I've ever met. He is so sweet and made sure we were comfortable the whole time and doing well with our dishes. We also chatted about a restaurant I frequent often in boulder city near my home, so I felt he knew his stuff. I'm really glad I took the time to drive out to this restaurant!

5033235,2011-08-13,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"This is probably one of the best local restaurants in Las Vegas. Everything is excellent: the food, the drinks, the service, the decor, the ambiance...it really doesn't get any better than this, for a local spot. As an avid foodie, I was very impressed. We went there with a party of four people, for an early dinner seating. We were greeted nicely and were seated immediately. As for the decor, it is a nice mix of modern with hints of rustic. I wouldn't necessarily call this place eclectic, but it's somewhere along those lines. The industrial feel of the ceiling is a great touch. 

We shared two appetizers that were mentioned as specials by our server who, by the way, was exceedingly attentive and knew the entire menu by heart - but not in a ""this is what I'm supposed to tell you"" kind of way. One appetizer consisted of a few shrimp, drenched in a garlicky, lemony sauce, with generous portions of chorizo sausage. They are served alongside buttered bread, making them excellent vessels for leftover sauce. They were absolutely delicious. We also shared the BBQ ribs, which were also delicious and perfectly cooked. They fell right off the bone, and thankfully did not taste overly smokey (no moist towlettes necessary either). The ribs come with a side of grilled pineapple, which perfectly complemented the meat portion. Overall, we were quite impressed by our choice of appetizers.  

As for our entrees, we decided to share four plates: jerk lamp chops, chicken curry, slow cooked pork, and braised short ribs. Without a shadow of a doubt, they were all amazing, and it was hard to decide which was the best. We could have done without the lamb chops, as you can basically get those anywhere, yet the ones they serve at DW do have a hint of delicious jerk seasoning, but were somewhat overcooked. They are served over roasted, seasonal vegetables. The slow-cooked pork is served in a bowl, atop white rice. The sauce is very spicy (though you can tell your server how you feel about spices), and tasted similar to a Mexican ""pibil"" sauce (made with achiote paste), or a Mexican mole. We couldnt' really identify the ingredients used, but they tasted delicious! As for the short ribs, these were also excellent...perfectly cooked in a melt-in-your-mouth manner. They are served alongside one of the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted in Las Vegas. Lastly, we shared the chicken curry, which is served in a large bowl. It tasted nothing like Indian or Thai curry, but had a distinct, garlicky sauce that was to die for....perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked. I thought the string beans added the perfect amount of crunch as well. And, the curry is served over cous cous, which absorbs the creaminess of the curry and is really quite amazing. 

We couldn't decide on a dessert, so we went for the dessert sampler. Little did we know that we would be served full-sized portions of different dessert items. There were three cakes: red velvet (delicious, with white chocolate shavings on the cream cheese frosting), chocolate mousse cake (very chocolatey and, surprisingly, not very heavy), and Jamaican carrot cake (it was probably my favorite of the three). Also, there were hand-rolled chocolate truffles...delicious. And, a lemon pudding that was refreshing and velvety. We couldn't finish it all. 

For drinks, we tried their version of Mojitos, which were made with fresh lime juice, muddled mint, and strawberries. We only had one each, as we felt that if we were to go for a second, we would immediately feel a buzz. 

We loved this place, and cannot wait to go back soon, especially for their brunch service on Saturdays and Sundays. The only negative thing I have to say is that they were out of their DW chorizo and saffron rice, which I would imagine is to die for. I'll have to go back and hope they have it then. We each ate for around $50, including drinks and tip. And finally, I have to say that I love the location of the restaurant...it's in a nice, quiet neighborhood that seems very lively and happening at night.",p6jBxxG6TA5mAD6slTQ6sQ,1,0,5,u1T_Zh_8BpjgtbeNI3JzPw
5042203,2014-01-20,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"FINALLY!  I had the opportunity to check out DW Bistro :)  I've heard so many amazing things about this place and wanted to check it out.  The location is pretty far from my house, so this was special.  On my MLK weekend, thought this would be the perfect opportunity for a great brunch joint.  

Walking up to the restaurant, I noticed that it was centered in a really nice strip mall.  Far location, however, seemed super worth it!  The restaurant is super modern.  Clean colors makes for a very trendy location :)  I feel so dirty walking into a white place LOL.  One of the major focal points of the restaurant is the bar.  Super nice.  The bathrooms were clean and made me feel like I was at a spa retreat.  Our server was super nice.  He was helpful.  I wish he told us his name so I could give a shout out, but oh well.  

We started out with bottomless mimosas for $20.  Trust me, that's the best deal ever.  And bottomless...they NEVER let it go dry.  Always coming around and refilling the glasses.  It was super worth it.  For brunch, I got one of the staff picks, the Jerk Frid Chicken and waffles for $15.  Huge pieces of chicken breasts, fried in a jerk spice seasoning, on top of waffles and served with DW Bistro signature maple syrup.  The chicken was spicy and savory, garnished with a little orange peel shavings.  It was packed with flavor and so delicious.  The waffles were big, yet super fluffy.  The syrup was refreshing and unlike any other syrup I've had.  It went well with both the waffles and chicken.  Such and amazing and well thought out meal.  Definitely a take home item, unless you come with a super big appetite.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!!

Looking for a great brunch joint?  Try DW!  It has quickly became one of my top picks in the city.  It's worth the drive.  It's modern, it's trendy, it's awesome!  Thanks for a great morning, DW!!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,2,0,5,KgBchwKoYgN2neqa7PMkhA

The wait time is always reasonable and they are very apologetic but who can blame them... DW is the best! Their drinks and bar tenders are delightful and I am not lying when I say everything on their menu is fantastic. 

My favorite is their Jerk Chicken, and their Turkey burger!!! Always quality, great prices, and phenomenal food. Their chopped salad is also so amazing, its like deconstructed with the most perfect elements and portions. Their drink selection however is incredible. I love their mimosas, and weird mixed drink varieties.

However... on Sundays everyone is so rude and it's like a fire hazard. I had called around 11:30 AM to take my sister to brunch and they said no problem. Then I was faced with a confusing ass line then told to go to the front door where I was greeted by a super rude guy in a captain america outfit who told me they weren't taking anymore guests for the next 1.5-2 hours.....

5050230,2012-10-20,9,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I saved my 700th review for something righteously outstanding. We decided to square in on something difficult for us to get to normally for our staycation time and this was the one place I was I really wanted.

The space is modern and vibrant and it was a lovely day so we sat outside. They had a white peach pomegranate ice tea that is a must order. It's fruity and refreshing. 

After much back and forth on several attractive sounding dishes and suggestions from our waiter we decide on our lunch. While we waited, he came back with a little amuse bouche of sorts. He wanted us to try some of their very popular curry soup and it was quite nicely spiced and complex. Promising for our food to come.

He brought a few bottles of hot sauces to the table that were favorites and explained each one. A place of my heart - I love things to be more spicy as of late! 

Short rib sandwich was a beef dream. The braise on them was done right and it was tender and juicy and the jalapeno bacon was smoky and really nicely crispy contrast and their ciabatta bread was good and held up to the meats. I threw on some Scotch Bonnet hot sauce on this was it elevated it perfectly. Sweet potato fries were really light and crispy, more like chips in that addictive keep dipping in the chipotle mayo on the side and popping it in your mouth sort of way.

The ""bowl of the day"" was spiced chicken and chorizo bowl with roasted corn and chilies. This was such a hearty portion we could not finish. Lovely spice and I like that the chorizo was crisped up on the edges. This went well with the mango hot sauce on our table and was such a addictive combo. Being Asian I've cooked up just about everything and ordered everything with rice that it's hard to make me think it's the best thing on rice since white on rice. I loved this dish and reminded me of what my carribean creole neighbors mango gumbo fed me as a kid. Gah, nostalgia gets you every time. 

Since it was our first time there,  our server got us a small slice of their carrot ginger cake to taste. We were full and didn't think we can take more than a bite, but we had to eat it. It was moist, had a very nice balance of spice and the frosting was not too sweet. The raspberry and mango sauces and fresh berries on the plate were perfect accompaniments. I love carrot cake and haven't had one make me smile in a long time. My little heart is pining for some right now. I want a whole cake - none for anyone else. 

Service here was amazing. Our server Lorenzo was so upbeat and friendly and uber attentive to little details. That's what puts this place over the edge for me was all the small things which is such a rarity. Since it was our first time he told us the story of the place and food, took his time running through the menu populars and his personal favorites when we couldn't make a choice. It's rare that a place goes beyond to make your first time special and wanted us a bite of their star curry dish, try some of their banging carrot cake, brought us favorite hot sauces that pair well with what we ordered. It adds a depth of warmth and thoughtfulness that normally is reserved for regulars and even then is lost on many establishments. Something I expect from  ungodly pricey places, but isn't always delivered. Drinks were always topped off and we were checked on in a very present but not overbearing way. Also when we were handling the check, our ice teas were still to the top and he asked if we would like to take them in to-go cups with us and since it was delish of course we did. It was a nice touch. He also showed us their dinner and brunch menus and hoped we enjoyed everything and come see them to try out their other menus. 

I have been stingy with 5 stars, and almost never give first visits a 5, but this IS as good as it gets! One of the better dining experiences I've had in this city. Vibrant, exciting food, lovely atmosphere and thoughtful service. I put off going because I never have a reason to be in this part of town, but with a experience this strong this IS the reason to come out of the way here, and come back fast. It may even have to be this weekend.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,21,16,5,sGhNOX2d3RWYfCc142kf8Q

The star was taken away due to the fact that the wait was way longer then they estimated. They had told us 30 minutes when we arrived and the wait ended up being over an hour. There is not enough space for all the campers with bottomless mimosas. 

This was our first time here and the food was absolutely delicious! The chiliquiles were really amazing without having a guilty portion size. My friends pulled pork omelet was flavorful and presentable as well. 

Our mimosas were 22 a person for bottomless and let me tell you I could barely taste any orange juice! Without a doubt we got our money worth of alcohol. The wait staff was quick with refills and our glasses were never empty! 

Lastly I have to bring this up again they need more space for the business!!! I can't imagine going back and waiting that long again especially when great food is easy to come by in las vegas!",Q7t7isNs3RksmTuiPD9jow,1,1,4,pdbv051vIuAG4CqZyPiEXA

Bottomless mimosas aren't bad - can't taste the alcohol, but obviously had an effect - so they're good?? Chilaquiles were absolutely delicious. We've had our fair share from El Paso and New Mexico and this ranks pretty highly. The pork bowl - eh- cooked by white people, great for white people, recommended by our white friends, we'll leave it at that. Rice was a bit undercooked and the sauce was a bit dry, but that either may be personal preference or clouded by an asian palate. Otherwise the other stuff had good flavor. If you go with the burger, the sweet potato fries are good. Breakfast potatoes are excellent.

5094850,2014-07-07,23,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"JERK!  

Yes, the flavor of Jamaica. It's in 30 percent of the menu.  That said, what's a group of hungry, foodie poker grinders to do?  Order every ""jerk"" dish of course.

Side note:  this is not a Jamaican restaurant rather a contemporary neighborhood bistro.  Large portions, good prices, and friendly off Strip service.  Hits and misses on flavor and preparation but overall a great value.

The jerk seasoning, a good spice blend with pronounced allspice flavor that lacks the fiery scotch bonnet peppers heat and floral pepper taste.  Sadly it results in an earthy taste not often complimented by the other ingredients.

The run down:

Jerk oven roasted baby back ribs with grilled pineapple and a buttermilk ranch sauce - Tender but very earthy in flavor.  The pineapple provides much needed acidity.

Jerk fried calamari with a sweet chili glaze - Pass.  Oily, soggy, and a sticky mess.

Couscous salad with jerk seared ahi seasoned with a herbaceous pesto, heirloom tomatoes, goat cheese and a hint of truffle oil is refreshing but the fish is previously frozen.  All good, it's natural flavor is obliterated by the seasoning.

DW fried chicken with cornbread and a jerk cream gravy - Southern cooking taken a little too far south.  Jerk seasoning has a burnt, dirt taste once deep fried.  Flabby dish.

Jerk lamb chops - Excellent.  Cooked to temperature.  The jerk seasoning enhances the natural game and mineral flavor of the lamb.

Jerk filet - Very good.  Like the lamb, cooked to temperature while the seasoning enhances the mineral flavor of the beef.

Jerk chicken breast - Flavorful but slightly dry.  The orange glaze does not pair well.

Overall, a solid neighborhood bistro with a twist.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,27,25,4,8pAhv73VYXo-q7q985r0aw

We figured that since they only opened it for us, we'd get less service. Nope. These dudes/dudettes were on top of it. They were constantly checking up on us; refilling our drinks without even having to ask, and the food was out so quick. I didn't even mention that it was my friends birthday, but they brought her some cake anyways.

I love the Jamaican/New Mexican fusion dishes they offer, it's fascinating and invites opportunities of new flavors.  Jamaican Curry Chicken Bowl is not like anything I've tasted it's full explosion of yummy. it's a pretty a big bowl enough for two people. 

For lunch, I tried the New Mexican-style green chile cheeseburger.  I usually never order burgers because I feel I should always try something new, However the waitress said its quite popular so I gave it a shot and the burger blew me away. 
Its succulent, juicy just the way I like it, easily one of my top three favorite burgers in Las Vegas.

They have a divine cocktail and beer selection, it pairs up very well with the food.
Jamaican Mojito and DW Bloody Mary is my favorite.

5130233,2018-05-13,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Based on the stellar reviews and overall hype, I went into my brunch at DW with pretty high expectations. 
I'll begin with the quality of service. I honestly can't say anything negative about the service of the restaurant because, frankly, it was outstanding. Our waiter didn't fail to impress our party from the moment we sat down. Attentive, kind, and insightful are all accurate descriptions of the service he provided. 5 stars for service. 
Regarding the ambiance: DW Bistro has tastefully modern and vibrant decor that immerses you in a warm dining experience. Also 5 stars in this category.
Now let's talk food. DW features a great brunch menu with some very exciting dishes. The jerk fried chicken and waffles, and the jerk pork hash immediately caught my attention. 
Appetizers: My group ordered all of the appetizers to start, and we were quite pleased with the decision. The chicken flautas were savory and flavorful, and the sopapillas were nothing short of addicting. Highly recommend both. 
Cocktails: DW's signature cocktails were nothing short of outstanding. I had their version of the moscow mule, which featured some refreshingly unique ingredients, such as mint and apricot. Please give this a try if mules are your thing (or even if they are not!). 
Entrees: Unfortunately, this is where I was eventually let down. Our entrees took quite a long time to get to the table (over 35 minutes), which would have been ok for me if they were up to par. My roasted vegetable omelet arrived cold and dry - like it had been sitting out for a good 10 minutes before arriving at the table. The jerk pork hash was also quite bland. 
Overall, I'd give DW a 3.5 out of 5. With that being said, I am most definitely willing to give DW a second chance; and I would still recommend you give DW a shot as well. I have a feeling the kitchen is very capable of serving the high-quality signature entrees that many others have experienced!",b67mjakbcExVStSxR0SNTA,0,0,3,JFGNzv4KzIvsH9_1QmObZQ

It was a very busy Saturday afternoon...and there was a considerable wait.  Parking was a little difficult as well...busy shopping area.

I was quite a bit bummed out that they don't serve the LUNCH menu on the weekends...only the BRUNCH menu at any time of the day.  Really wanted to give the burger a spin :(

So instead, I went with the New Mexican-style Slow-Cooked Pork ($12): Simmered in New Mexican Red Chile, Over-Easy Eggs and Rice. They warn it's spicy, but I didn't find it very spicy at all. It was super tender though, and had lots of flavor! I enjoyed it :)

Also tried the DW Nicoise ($16): Pan-seared Tuna, Olives, Haricot Verts, Fingerling Potatoes, Heirloom Tomatoes, Sliced Egg, Fresh Mango & Dijon Champagne Vinaigrette. Good overall, but it wasn't outstanding.  I don't think I would recommend it.

Prices were ok and portions were good.  I guess I just wasn't overly impressed enough for the bump in review.  Might have been too hyped up for me personally.

I will also agree that there is a good value when it comes to portion and price.  One word of warning, if you are dining in a group, one side might be enough for the entire table.  My wife and I got a side of mac and cheese and after we threw in the towel it looked like we barely made a dent.

I will definitely be back for the Bloody Mary's as well.  They top it off with a delicious strip of jalapeno bacon in addition to all the usuals.

Keep an eye out for the omelet specials on the weekends.  $18 seems like a lot for a breakfast plate but it was AWESOME.  The omelet itself was HUGE and all the fillings were great.  The toast is also a big bonus.  In most cases toast is toast, but here it's a little something more.

I would agree that at times it can get loud depending on the crowd and if they are taking part in bottomless mimosas or something like that but you can always request to sit outside or in the back.

5156366,2011-08-29,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"A Sunday requested off work for my birthday clearly means one thing: brunch. I decided I wanted an intimate brunch with a few friends in order to celebrate, and after hearing about this place through an acquaintance, we set off to DW Bistro.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous - bright, well-decorated with gorgeous artwork, modern. We waited about ten minutes before actually being seated, which was understandable for a Sunday brunch. Once seated, however, service was sporadic - uncomfortably attentive at first which eventually drifted into long unexplained periods of absence. 

My friends had ordered both the Blueberry White Chocolate Scones and the Pastry Basket. The former were absolutely orgasmic - light, airy, studded with fresh blueberries (though lacking in the white chocolate department). They were then featured in the latter, alongside Chocolate Croissants, turnovers of mysterious fruity containment, blueberry muffins, and cranberry almond scones. The chocolate croissants were delicious - rich, flaky, perfect. The others were somewhat lacking - mediocre at best. 

As for entrees, both a friend and I ordered the Jerk Chicken and Waffles while the other ordered the Tuna Nicoise salad. The chicken and waffles were delicious - ordinary at first with a kick of spice bites later. As for the Tuna Nicoise, huge pieces of Ahi tuna were barely seared atop greens with all of the normal accoutrements. Mango on the side was a random, but welcomed addition to the salad. As for the portions, the prices definitely are right on. All of us finished half of our entrees before calling it quits. 

More into service, there were long gaping moments were no service was to be found - extremely awkward when you're trapped in a restaurant's alcove with a table of gay men casting judgmental eyes toward your outfit! The worst part of the DW experience was handling a price discrepancy for the Pastry Basket. As we received our check, we found that we were charged extra for an upgraded pastry basket when we asked for the one specified on the menu. While I took a detour to the bathroom to avoid conflict with the waiter, I came back to the tail end of the conversation to which our waitress bluntly told my friends that while she'd fix it, that the price she charged was ultimately right.  

Food wise, DW Bistro has me mesmerized - I am smitten. However, service was lacking, but when I think of those blueberry white chocolate scones, it isn't enough to discourage another visit.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,4,VPjA_-e2EeLr5DEN6iD38w

DW rocks because:
- diverse bread basket
- portions are large (I recommend the jerk fried calamari appetizer, also heard the truffle mac & cheese is good as well)
- waitstaff is awesome & friendly
- parking is not a problem

Food only gets 3.5 stars because most of the menu items sound super tasty and/or semi exotic, but when it comes out, it's missing that certain oomph.  For example, the bowtie chicken pasta sounded good on paper, tasted alright, but it could have been spectacular.  I don't recommend getting the full calamari for 2 people - it was a mistake and too much calamari.  The full size is good for 4+, the half probably good for 2-3 people.

Owned and operated by Bryce Krausman and Dalton Wilson, DW Bistro had been on my list of places to dine in Las Vegas for two years but with my visits largely limited to the strip or around Christmas when they graciously give their employees much needed time off it was not until my fateful interview trip that I finally made it to the Spring Valley restaurant, arriving just after the restaurant opened after an early morning flight from Phoenix.  Large and airy with light spilling into the room to match the bright attitudes of the service team I was seated almost immediately on arriving at a table in back per my request and after perusing the menu decided to do what I often do with a menu so tempting; over order.  Coffee in hand and copious refills to follow my meal started off with a pair of pastries including a tender sticky bun and an unfortunately slightly dry scone that livened up slightly with a touch of butter and jam and moving right along my main plates would arrive shortly thereafter, each proving larger than anticipated.  From the smoky chicken atop a crisp yet pliable waffle and onward to the dense egg-bread topped with fresh berries and bathed in fruit-tinged syrup it would be hard to decide which dish I preferred as both were good but neither were 'best of genre' but unable to resist the signature carrot cake (not gifted to me as many have claimed on their first visit) I must say that this dish truly is special - one of those rare situations where reinterpreting a classic shines a whole new light on the dish and puts something pedestrian on a pedestal, the dense spice cake rife with pineapple and coconut served in three layers separated by light cream and flecked with white chocolate.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,1,3,8BpkOYBKJby986rFgATDTw

There was a 35-40 minute wait at 1pm and they don't take reservations. What? This place must be good...no! We got seated at the patio and it was a beautiful day to be outside.

Since I was warned about the jerk chicken and waffles by other Yelpers, I thought about getting the tomato and goat cheese omelet but that seemed boring and I could get that somewhere else. So, I told our server I wanted to try the New Mexico-style slow cooked pork omelet but he stopped me from getting it when I told him I don't like spicy food. I ended up getting the DW Nicoise and somebody else got the New Mexico pork omelet. Both dishes came with a side of fruit.

DW Nicoise:
Pan-seared fresh tuna, greens, mangoes, Haricot vert, olives, fingerling potatoes, hard-boiled egg with mango and Dijon champagne vinaigrette. The tuna was great and so was the dressing. But I've had this salad elsewhere and it was better. This was just ok. 3/5

New Mexico-Style Slow Cooked Pork Omelet: 
Pork in NM chile and jack cheese with rice and egg on top. A bit spicy but tolerable. The pork was tender. I'm glad I didn't get this. Not my favorite taste. I appreciate our server's warning. 2/5

I don't think I'll come back. The menu either has items that are too safe and items that are exciting but not good. The service was good.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,2,3,yhFn2mxRvylnzZqAt6vzKw

Located in a strip mall, this place has a great layout and concept.  Bright vibrant colors greet you as you walk in.  There is a bar inside that's great for eating and getting drinks while you wait for your table. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I assume on a Friday/Saturday night there will be a wait.  

The bartender greets us and seats us at a 2-top.  Our server took a minute to greet our table but the party next to us was large (~10 people).  He took our drink orders...but failed to talk about any specials going on. 

We ordered the seasonal fruit with fresh cream and mint. Which came out promptly and was fresh and delicious, not exactly what I expected for $9.00 but delicious, oh, did I mention that there was no cream on the plate. A healthier options...but still...cream is easy enough.

My partner ordered the Jamaican Jerk Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The batter was great! So savory but with a hint of sweetness to it, lots of herbs and spices went into the batter and seasoning. The chicken was all white meat and juicy and the batter did not weigh it down at all. The waffles were slightly sweet and married very well with the savory-ness of the chicken.  The syrup that accompanied the dish was lighter than syrup and more of a sauce, light, sweet...and herb-y. The dish was a cohesive thought and was very well executed. 

However, my entree did not fare so well.  I ordered the DW Nicoise Salad.  It came with seared ahi tuna and a mango-Dijon vinaigrette.  I was excited to eat this retro salad, however it fell so short! There was dressing on my salad, but it didn't taste like anything. Everything was bland.  There was no seasoning on the terribly seared ahi tuna.   No amounts of salt and pepper or even hot sauce could save this...huge disappointment, but it will not deter me from going back to try this place for dinner.",wU_Ti9E_-QpVPTlV0u2cCg,0,0,3,Odzyed15kqRD7Ko4DImjMQ

We ordered:
BF: New Mexico style Slow Cooked Pork
me: Shrimp Scampi over linguine
appetizer: Jamaican Baby Back Ribs 
They give you really big portions so we were happy to bring home lots of leftovers. All of the food was great, but I must admit, the BF's dish was the best! The slow cooked pork had a fried egg on top  and it was served over rice. I'm spoiled, so I got to eat my food AND some of his. By the end of dinner we both struggled because we were so full, but the food was so darn good we didn't want to stop eating!

The service was great. Our server recommended that we come back for the brunch, so that is definitely on our to do list. When we mentioned that it was our first time to the restaurant, he told us to wait because he had a little something for us. He brought us a slice of Jamaican Carrot Cake.

O.M.G. 

This is unlike any carrot cake you have ever had. It had macadamia nuts, pineapple and covered in white chocolate shavings. The frosting wasn't like the overly sweet cream cheese buttercream that you usually find on carrot cake. This was much lighter and really creamy. The carrot cake had something else that I couldn't put my finger on (it's been driving me crazy because I can't figure it out...Cloves? Cardamom?) Whatever it is, it is totally worth the drive to Las Vegas. I am so bummed that I can't find anything like this cake in So Cal.

The owner who looks like Seal, was hanging out near the door and I kept wishing he'd grab a mic and start singing,

""I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray.
Ooh,
The more I get of you,
The stranger it feels, yeahhhhhhh""......

Unfortunately he didn't, but he seemed to be extremely engaged in the FOH operations, a lost trait amongst many owners. Everyone that walked in the door seem to know him and was greeted by a hip insiders-only handshake, a hug, or directed to a VIP table. I was intrigued because these are the type of restaurants you see on Lifetime television where the owner is a real hot shot suddenly being stalked by a infatuated customer or overlooked employee and weird things start to happen. Haha......
I ordered the BLT with sweet potato fries. The jalapeño bacon had just the right amount of heat and although there was some sort of remoulade-like mayo it was perfect and not overpowering. If you've read some of my previous reviews you know how I feel about food arriving IMMEDIATELY after ordering and it being lukewarm. After the order was put in 3 minutes later my food was brought to the table. The BLT looked amazing,  but the fries looked like Ursula's ""poor unfortunate souls"" from The Little Mermaid. They were shriveled, withered, and. ..... (GULP)..... cold. I knew they were probably the last of the precooked batch. I tried to suck it up, but I couldn't because each fry was so disappointing. I let the server know and he brought a fresh new batch. When I bit into it, steam came out and I smiled like a little kid. They were amazing, and I had no guilt eating them. Although I cut my sandwich in half and anticipated getting a TO GO container,  I devoured the other half effortlessly. With each bite,  I watched the ""cool crowd"" shake hands, make business deals, and laugh heartily at each others witty humor. It was surely a frequent flyer guest list. A place where these people felt taken care of, a place ""where everybody knows your name"" and the service is customized. Yes, swanky.",jwvmw22-y4eMq2rzi0wAeQ,7,4,4,OAfvrT34cfJXzK7D297zzQ

My Top suggestion would be Sunday brunch, their ChilaQuiles are amazing! 
Lunch, Their Jerk Chicken Sandwich is awesome! As well as their Salmon, I also really like their slow roasted pork bowl if your real hungry! 
Their Chicken and waffles are awesome too!

You will be very happy with their food! As well as their service. One of the things that have always impressed me is their ability to retain their employees. There is almost ZERO turn over! This leads to highly trained staff who are very good! 

Also the owners Bryce & Dalton are great guys who have done a great job building a great team, a great environment with awesome food! 

Go there you'll be glad you did!",Qc-ZJSuqgcMPLUBRsigzlg,0,0,5,4ca9SVXq0t-ivK_IA3QV3A

5373413,2013-01-17,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Brunch is a madhouse! Vanessa N. was planning a UYE here and was told that they do not take reservations. I left my house early and got there right at opening to see if that would help expedite our wait time. Instead I was greeted with a line out the door and a no seating uncompleted parties policy.

Oh well, instead of letting that damper the mood I waited at the bar with a few early birds to begin the festivities. What better way than bottomless mimosas? Absolutely none would be the answer. 

For a large party, the food comes out quickly. To begin we were given fruit to start. Jade W., Anthony M. and I split some dishes to get the full experience. Speaking with a friend from work, it is easy to tell a Yelper apart from any other diner. We tend to get a variety of dishes and share. ::check:: The hash is amazing and $11 for a full order. It is a steal. The omelet with jerk pork was light and airy. The eggs benedict with jalapeno bacon was so so. The bacon is crisp with a subtle hint of spice, while the eggs were poached to perfection, yet I did not like the carb portion of the dish. 

The service was exceptional. Luis took very good care of us. We had our mimosas and waters constantly filled. When we started to get too rowdy, they cut us off. It is never pleasant to be told that you have had enough, but I appreciate it.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,1,4,cz9AUvCu4w0tTLJMOo3LGg
5380032,2017-06-27,5,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"AMAZING experience at DW Bistro. A little tricky to find because you can't see the front from the parking lot. It's inside the tall building, just go up the stairs. Sadly we missed brunch but was still able to order our usual BM drinks. Our waiter was the best! He warned us that the BMs were very spicy and I told him I couldn't handle too much spice so he said he would add more tomato juice if that was the case.

- DW Blood Mary
The spiciest BM I've ever had in my life, I'm pretty sure he mentioned the vodka was soaked in jalapenos or maybe it was a spicy Jamaican vodka? I can't remember. The presentation was beautiful, came in a tall glass with a slice of pickle.. my fave! They were very generous with the bacon slices too, it was sooo good! Once I added the extra juice and let the water dilute the drink it was really good!

My bf ordered another drink, it must've been off the menu because I can't find it. It was a chilled coffee with alcohol served in a martini glass with espresso beans. Holy crap was this drink strong! I think this is what put us over the edge. We were on a good one after sharing this.

- DW Cobb Salad
Definitely needed this after a long weekend of drinking. This salad was so refreshing, it hit the spot. The chicken was cooked perfectly, not too dry. There was a generous amount of avocado. If you enjoy cobb salads I highly recommend this.

- New Mexican Pork
Comes with two over easy eggs, rice and flour tortilla. I don't know if it was the BMs since it was so spicy but this was difficult for me to eat because I swear this dish has a kick to it! I wish I was able to eat more of this because it was so damn good!! Our waiter boxed this up for me and I sadly left it at my parents house since we had a flight to catch back home. I need to order this again the next time I come back.

Our waiter was kind enough to bring out a GIANT carrot cake. Just when I wasn't able to eat anymore he brings this out on the house and I almost lost it. I love sweets. It has pieces of white chocolate on top and inside the cake. My bf and I INHALED this cake it was that good!! Thank you to our waiter that was so kind to us and made our lunch experience here amazing. I didn't catch his name but I think it was Michael.

5383574,2011-06-04,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I love the concept behind this restaurant.  It is trendy and affordable.  Some items on and off the menu however can use a little fine tweaking if not revamping.  We ordered a couple of appetizers including a DW appetizer special for the day and the oven roasted baby back ribs.  The ribs were ordinary while the calamari was terrible! I mean, have you ever had candied calamari before? I have, here! The sugar and breading that coated the calamari made the dish a tough and unappetizing one. It's a good thing the entrees made up for the starter mess.  For entrees, we had the jerk lamb chops, jerk chicken scampi over linguine, the filet with bordelaise served over mash f the day, the pan seared salmon and the Jamaican curry chicken. The lamb was juicy, cooked to my desired doneness and seasoned perfectly.  The filet with bordelaise was so so, I've had better breaded fish.  The jerk chicken scampi over linguine was really good.  I recommend this one for anyone who likes to try something new and delicious.  Unfortunately, I did not get to sample the pan seared salmon nor the Jamaican curry chicken. No desserts were ordered as we were all very full.  The price is absolutely reasonable for the portions.  

One thing I like about the place is that the owner of the bistro comes around.  He remembers his patrons and engages in conversation with them.  Another plus to the bistro is their corkage policy.  We brought three bottles of wine and enjoyed it and shared it with everyone in our group.

I am excited about this place.  It is promising.  They just need to work on their specials and their starter menu.",c_vWuM8PYGdMpyxsNctCMA,2,0,3,SCH74p3VBrSDtjG6VQzXrQ
5387318,2012-03-03,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"DW is quite possibly the cutest little eatery ever, in fact I want their decorator to come work their magic on my home!  I really want to love this adorable little spot, but the service needs some work and organization.  The first time I dined here was not long after they opened and I figured they were still finding their groove.  

I made my 2nd visit today; my friends and I popped in to sample their $20 Restaurant Week lunch.  Our first course, the Jamaican Chicken Curry Soup came right out, but with no spoons.  Once they hooked us up with spoons, our taste buds did the happy dance for the little cup full of tasty-creamy-curryliciousness.  

Little did we know that we were in for quite a wait.  We observed as 3 nearby tables that were seated after us were getting their food.   After waiting for 45 minutes we flagged our waitress, who apologized and said our order would be right up.  After another 20 minutes my asparagus prosciutto salad arrived, then 5 minutes later my 2 friends received their dishes.  My dish was called ""Grilled Asparagus Salad with Prosciutto"", which I found rather misleading because I received four pieces of asparagus wrapped in prosciutto atop a huge plate of mixed field greens.  It was like ordering a burger and getting the full size bun with a slider sized patty.

Before we were done with our main course they dropped off our dessert that came with the restaurant week prix fixe, which overcluttered our table.  We waited all of that time for our entrees only to be rushed out when they finally arrived.  As we were preparing to leave we overheard another table that had also been waiting for quite a while.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,2,2,2,iR_ywvlIXwwMg7T8UpXPWA

5390452,2012-07-06,4,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"First off, my first review since becoming Elite!  A standing O?  You're all too kind.  Okay sit down, I have to work here.

I'd wanted to try DW Bistro for a while but it's pretty much out of the way of where I live and work.   One day after a dentist appointment I decided to go a little out of the way on my way into work and treat my freshly cleaned teeth to the jamaican curry that had been tantalizing me via pictures and reviews here on Yelp for months.  Oh what a fantastic decision this was.  

I called in the order and was told it'd be 20 minutes.  I arrived about 15 minutes later and had to use their restroom.   I wouldn't say I have a fear of public restrooms but I do practice some well honed ""only if absolutely necessary"" avoidance techniques.  This was one of those situations.  It did allow me to get a closer look at the whole restaurant though whereby I usually just see the checkout counter when I do takeout.  I found it very sleek, modern, and clean, which I personally prefer over drab, dated, and dirty, so big plus there!  No issues in the bathroom (well none that was the restaurants fault.  just kidding).   

When I got back to the bar/counter area, my food was ready and I paid and drove to work.   I knew right upon removing the curry chicken bowl that it was a winner.  The mix of colors of the peppers, green beans with the beautiful yellow curry.  Had I dropped it on the floor and had to throw it away I probably could have felt comfortable with a 4 star review on it, but thankfully I actually got to taste it.   Okay I did more than taste.  I ATE WITH RECKLESS ABANDON.  ""Is that curry I feel on my cheek?  After a few more bites I'll investigate further""   Pretty sure this makes it deserving of 5 stars.

I will be back, and I want to try every single thing on the menu.  This is no exaggeration, it's just one of those places.  It's ""Elite"" if you will.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,6,5,py-4KpE9YIh-noOFQziGkQ

And we got the DW signature salad - baby field greens, caramelized pecans, orange segments, seasonal bell peppers, topped with goat cheese and served with balsamic vinaigrette.  Both of these were yummy!  Enjoyed them both.

For entree, I got the Dover sole special of the day, and it was a really large piece of fish, over a bed of mash, and smothered with three sauces, red roasted pepper sauce, mango with pepper sauces and the third was another chili sauce.  All of these worked well together, and I really enjoyed the plate.  I'm a fish lover anyway, and these flavors were so unique, I enjoyed it's freshness.

The rest of the service wasn't extraordinary. Our waiter seemed to thrive on over using sarcasm, which was funny at first...but after being there for over two hours it lost its charm. I ordered eggs for my breakfast and he faked shock, since everyone else's food was more ""interesting"" I suppose. I told him I had a dairy allergy and he said ""there's plenty of other things without dairy on the menu."" Great, okay, but I already made my decision 15 minutes ago when we got the menu. I just want eggs and bacon, dude, no need to make a huge deal out of it. 

We had a fairly large group, so we knew it would take a while for our food to arrive, but we were not given updates or anything regarding how soon it would be ready. Our drinks were constantly refilled, so that was nice.  After finally getting our food, we were a little disappointed in the quality. My fiance and his mom both ordered french toast and agreed that it was too sweet. On top of that, the menu said that there would be sauteed bananas and fresh strawberries - but the strawberries were clearly sauteed and the bananas had not been touched. It wasn't anything huge, but a little irritating considering how much the food cost. 

After finishing our food, it took forever to finally get our bill. Again, I understand how busy it was due to the fact it was Mother's Day, but an update every now and again would be nice. 

Overall, the food was good and the restaurant is cute. I would like to visit again and try something else when it's less busy and the waiter isn't questioning my choice in food.",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,0,1,4,ucu4T2AV3uKIzJrjd3uMUQ

They relocated about a year ago, which has a nicer ambiance. I had brunch on a Sunday once and it was an overall great experience. They have a lot of plates you can share and get your money's worth. Especially for bottomless mimosas!

As I went again recently, I went to for a client work lunch and it was around 1:30. It wasn't as busy, but our server didn't pay attention as much the whole time and was too occupied with another table and giving them the best service possible. We had to check on a few items multiple times since he barely came around and I had to ask for water again since he didn't come to refill the table after the first pour towards the end of my meal. 

We ordered appetizers, multiple drinks, and each had our own entree. I personally had the jerk ahi salad without the jerk. It was great, but i wish i had the dressing on the side. Overall, great place and great food. I would just suggest that every table should have the best server experience especially for people who have never been.

I had the pan seared salmon and it was very good and was served with vegetables which were really flavorful.  I also had the soup of the day and it was fantastic. We will definitely return and our only complaint was the atmosphere was pretty bright and light and prefer a little darker restaurant at night.  The bar was very small so sitting there wasn't really appealing and I agree this would be a perfect lunch or brunch spot but would return anytime. This would be a great place for dinner with people you want to talk business with because the noise level was so low and there are out of the way corners in the back of the restaurant.",g4yPg9CHRbl25q7qcV1wGQ,1,2,4,bWNmduwuQg8GJK9mOHj1yA

This was the first time that I ever experienced a dish I wasn't so impressed with. I always contemplate is a BLT suppose to be warm or cold? Ill go with warm especially when I add a fried egg on it. This time, that was not the case. The bread itself they used, brioche was soggy, my fried egg was fully cooked through and definitely did not classify as the over medium egg I ordered. This sandwich does come with shredded lettuce which I don't really care for. I find that majority of it ends up on the plate.

Today we started with the pastry basket. I'm a sucker for blueberries. The pastries seemed freshly made, and those blueberry scones ARE SO GOOD. Hot right out of the oven! The food takes awhile to come out as well. So it was good we were able to munch on something before everything came out.

With that being said, this was a Vegas local's dream come true. 

I walked in, and two extremely flamboyant men (the owners) greeted my friend and I at the door and personally walked us in to our table. (So precious!)
The decor is very calm and soothing yet very chic. The whole entire restaurant is not very large. There is bar seating and probably about 20 tables. 
From there we were offered bread, there were three different kinds that we can choose from. The bread was served in a basket and we were able to pick out which one and however many we wanted. There was a flat bread, curry flavored bread and some sort of one with cheese.  We each took one of each. 
The water was poured from a glass bottle (super classy) and the menu was explained and the specials were said out loud. One thing that specifically stood out to me was that they switch out their mashed potatoes. I don't know about you, but who DOESN'T like mashed potatoes?! I love how they add different ingredients everyday. The day we went was jalapeño mashed, and it was delicious. The portion was a bit too much, even though we split it. 

You can get anything and it's good because it's takes American staples like burgers and salads and adds the extra Jamaican spices and sweets to make the most perfect combination of tastiness.

This was the first time I have every had Jamaican food, and I'll tell you now, Jamaican food is my kind of food! (ya, man!) It's very flavorful and full of spices

It was a bit pricy, but definitely worth it. The environment is great, the service is amazing and the portions are very reasonable.",NnNdqH3DaleFtQk60UT-og,2,1,5,7iEHDw8asVqoWS4Ows1cAg

5620566,2013-04-01,1,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"HIghly rated on Yelp, I've been wanting to eat here for a long time.  The first attempt was a fail.  It was a Sunday around 11:30am and the wait was 1.5 hours long.  My friend and I ended up going to the Yard House instead.  Having learned my lesson, I returned on a recent Sunday, but this time my gal pal and I got there around 9:45am, 15 minutes before they opened.  At first there was no one around, but at 9:50am, cars started arriving and people began to gather at the front doors in groups.  By the time 10:00am rolled around, there had to be at least 15 people waiting.  There really was no line formation, which was frustrating because once the doors opened, people just rushed in, not caring that others had been there first.  My friend and I got seated fairly quickly, but I would have been upset if we had to wait longer since we were technically the second ones to arrive.  Once seated, though, everything was smooth sailing for our brunch. 
 
   We shared the DW Pastry Basket:  2 big chocolate croissants and 3 blueberry white chocolate scones--we both enjoyed the croissants more than the scones.  I went vegetarian, ordering the Mini Corn Tortilla, an egg over easy with black beans, pico de gallo and queso fresco cheese atop two corn tortillas.  This was a hearty dish, nice and filling.  My friend had one of the specials that involved filet mignon and eggs, I think--whatever it was, she loved it.  Our waiter was very friendly and checked on us often and at the end of our meals, when we were already full, said waiter told us he was bringing us a surprise since it was our first visit.  The next thing we know, there's a lovely piece of carrot cake on the table--wow, that's so nice!  

   This place is popular for a reason; great service and food.  I definitely recommend it, but be prepared for a wait unless you get there early.  There were people waiting for a table the whole time we were there and also when we left.  I want to go back now that I can have meat again and sample some of the other tasty-looking items on the menu.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,2,2,4,syL9P1idyVw4vmnqwpt6bA

It's a little bit off the strip, but no biggie. Our group of 6 came by on a Sunday at 11am and was quoted a 30 minute wait but we were seated within 20 minutes. The guy taking down our names was a joy.

Once seated, the service was attentive. ESPECIALLY when it came to my bottomless mimosas! They were not conservative about the refills at all. I would be halfway done with my drink and they would already top me off. 

I got the slow-cooked pork bowl and it was delicious! It was definitely a generous portion in which I couldn't finish. It may be better to share. I got to try my friend's fried chicken and waffles and that was also good. The chicken was just the right hint of smokey, but not burnt. So yummy! All our meals came with fruits and the guy passing those out is extremely talented balancing all of those fruit bowls on one arm. Last but not least, we were told we had to try the carrot cake and let's just say I was sure glad we did. I am normally not a carrot cake fan but this place converted me. This carrot cake had bits of coconuts and white chocolate flakes, all of which are my FAVORITE!

I tried DW bistro when they hadn't moved yet - it was good (surely not exceptional, but I did not feel robbed at the time). After 2 years I came back, expecting good food and good ambiance. 
NOPE!

I guess this is now for people who cannot make eggs for breakfast or bottomless mimosa, for sure.
My omelette was dry and burned around the edges - truly underwhelming and overpriced ($14.00 ???!!!) - asked to sub bread with tomatoes and all I got was TWO slices of green tomato. Yum. 

The curry was okay but still - overpriced. $20 total with chicken added. I will say it was a big portion that can easily be shared but honestly did not taste ""Jamaican"". 

I guess people like to spend money on easy breakfast foods. We came here under the impression that we could order LUNCH (not just eggs or brunch) at 2 pm. There were misleading menu pictures of menus with Way more items than we were offered. 

Service was slow but ok. 

Our total was $50 for an omelette, a curry dish, coffee, tea, and orange juice. And all of it was truly underwhelming. Not ok.

5736759,2015-05-19,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in the valley! It has such a fun vibe, white tables with orange stripes on the wall. The waiters are all super personable and friendly. They are more than happy to make recommendations and your water glass will never be empty. 

We always start with the pastry basket, the scones are soft and delicious. They also serve a little bowl of fruit with each meal, which saved me one morning when I had a hungry baby next to me. I always get the chilaquiles, it's seriously the best I've ever had and I crave it sometimes late at night or other odd times that I can't have it. It has the perfect amount of spice and is balanced out by a touch of sour cream and avocado sauce. It's seriously the stuff of dreams. I've heard the other brunch dishes are great as well, but I'll probably never try them!

I've also been for dinner and everyone at our table was happy with their meal. The food is delicious, but the real standout is the mac and cheese. OMG! You really must add the bacon and mushrooms because why wouldn't you? It is so ooey and gooey and creamy and delicious, all things you want in a good mac and cheese. When I received mine the rest of the table followed suit by ordering their own. You probably want your own, don't share. 

It's nice to not have to fight traffic on the strip to experience an awesome restaurant like this, it's tucked away for us locals. It's a great spot for a special night, they even give you a free slice of cake if you are celebrating your birthday!

I checked in and was quotes a 2hr wait.  Put my name down and received a text confirmation.  I went to the bar and ordered the bottomless mimosas and a bloody Mary.  Getting the bartenders attention will take a while here as they are more concerned with socializing with one another than helping customers.  After 10 minutes i received my drinks.  The bloody Mary was superb with bacon and everything.  Although it was pretty pricey.  

Seating does look to be limited in this space and bar seating is next to none.  After 30 minutes i was texted for my table of 2.  The food is nothing special here.  Very spicy so please be careful.  The servers will just take your order and fall short of recommendations or table maintenance.  Maybe it was just the server that i got.

Unfortunately, they do not take reservations for the patio on Sunday's so make sure to plan ahead for waiting time. Don't worry, the wait isn't too bad since you get to drink your bottomless mimosas on the cute corridor and refill as many times as your heart desires.  The patio is small, so the wait could be anywhere from 30 min to an hour depending on the time of day.  If you don't mind and sit inside there were a few tables open around 11 so I got seated right away.  

Make sure to order the pastries appetizer while waiting for your food to come out.  They come out quick and taste delicious.  They pair excellent with mimosas and you're more than likely to inhale the scones (or I did).  Service was fine and our waiter never skipped a beat in filling up our drinks (I like his style).

I think their infused vodkas and other liquors are a nice addition to the bar considering they double as decor in the huge glass jars with colorful fruit in them. However, there was a time I tried a pineapple-infused vodka drink and the fruit flavor was only a minor note in the cocktail. Maybe it wasn't submerged long enough?

We got seated out on the patio right away with our 2 dogs, they brought the dogs water which is a plus in my book! The food was very good, I had the Nicoise salad $16 (sooo good!) and my boyfriend had the daily special of steak and eggs (a little pricey at $25 but it had 2- 4oz filet Mignon medallions, eggs, and toast) He loved it! We also got an appetizer of a small fruit salad brought to us (we didn't order it, it just appeared) which was cute and tasty.

We went on a sunday for the brunch because well who doesn't love bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's? We got there about 15 mins before they opened and there was already about 15-20 people ahead of us. We were immediately seated and ordered out bottomless goodness but I guess they forgot? Because we had to ask 3 different times for our drinks. I got the hash which wasn't really a hash and it was so spicy I could barely even eat it because my bloody marry was also very spicy. The husband got the DW bowl of slow pulled pork over rice, he really didn't like it he said it was all ""mushy"" he wished that there were different textures. 

Now, I did try his....BUT because the bloody marry, hash, and DW bowl were all so SPICY it all tasted the same. =[ 

Next time I plan on trying the french toast because the lady next to me got it and I couldn't stop staring at it. OH yeah and also I want to try the bread basket it looks legit!!

Though we discovered they were not serving their very nice-looking brunch menu (brunch is weekends only), the lunch menu was available.

Both of us decided on the couscous salad, which comes with really delicious jerk-seared ahi tuna sort of draped on each side of a little mound of couscous, peppers, and goat cheese. It seemed to be a popular item, as we saw lots of orders of it come out of the kitchen--and rightly so, as it was delicious, not to mention beautiful.

The waiter was really great and quite friendly, and when he discovered it was our first time there, he brought us a really tasty slice of their delicious house carrot cake with cream cheese frosting on the house.

Sunday's are usually a busy day for them, but we didn't care for the wait since we were able to drink our mimosas while waiting. The host and hostesses were giving us updates to see how far along we were in line as well which I thought was nice. 

You couldn't go wrong with the mimosas. It was perfect! The taste and the fruits with the drink were super super yummy. 

As soon as we sat down, we already knew what to order since we waited awhile. 

We ordered
Appetizer:
Pesto torte ($11)

Meals:
Jalapeño bacon eggs benedict ($14)
New Mexico style slow cooked pork with rice ($14)

Pesto torte... OMG! So yummy. We were so blown away. The cream and goat cheese with the nuts and a side of frackers with it was so good. Completely melts in your mouth. Never really liked goat cheese because it gave an after taste, but this didn't have that. The New Mexico style slow cooked pork was amazing as well. The sunny side egg on top did justice to it too. The pork was super tender and very flavorful with the chili sauce that they put. The portion of this dish was pretty big too. The eggs Benedict, you can never go wrong. The homemade sauce was bomb too! Had a kick of course because of the jalapeño.

We came for brunch, lingered for a couple hours, and during that time it was about 1/2 full, so no need to worry about a wait yet.  They don't take reservations for 4 people (maybe it was 6 and up?)

Our table shared the DW Pastry Basket, which was a popular item in the restaurant because most of the other tables also ordered the same thing.  I understood why as soon as we got our platter.  The scones were moist and delicious, the croissants were sooo buttery, and the house jam was a nice touch.  Only thing missing!!  Clotted cream.  I hope they add this to this platter and then you would find me camping out here all. the. time.  This platter is so filling that If you're 4 girls like we were, ordering a pastry basket is probably enough food.  

But that's not the way I roll.

I also got the Jerk Fried Chicken and Waffles.  I don't know why, but as soon as a restaurant offers Chicken & waffles I have to get it.  I've been disappointed in the past with soggy waffles and chicken, but they've done an excellent job there.  I like the jerk spice seasoning on the chicken (this one is boneless) and their breakfast syrup is really good too.  I noticed vanilla bean and cardamon(?).  In any case, a great combo all together.

The manager or owner stopped by and asked if it was our first time (it was) so he sent over some complimentary lemon pudding for dessert.  Nice touch.  The pudding was refreshing and not overly tart or sweet.  Great for desert when it's 100+ degrees outside.

when walking in (since we did so separately) the atmosphere was great, being seating and not being pressured by the wanting of being in and out. 

as we were seated the service was great, got drinks within a min being greeted by the owner and just walking to our seats. the automatic water dispense of water was amazing and the accommodations to what ever drink you would like the have. Me having the lemonade (it was a little lemony but upon request it could be sweetened) and with their pomegranate white ice tea was a good choice, light, aromatic and delicious (highly recommended).

as we moved on we started with a salad and starter dish, being their torte and jerked tuna salad. the torte itself was light and refreshing and it hit the spot (if needing to curve your appetite this was the right choice) with some crunch, abundance of flavors and spices, and richness of the cheese it was an amazing choice to have. our second started (actually being an entree) we had the jerked ahi tuna salad. the salad was surprising it has sweet, spicy, freshness and all the flavors after tossing was impeccable. 

main courses - with presentation being a high must all the dishes look amazing and with your burger/sandwich the choice of salad or sweet potato fries give a good health or substance benefactor. then the burger (myself getting the turkey burger) was more than a surprise. After a peer saying it was amazing the the staff giving it good marks i just wanted to try it and it was nothing less than expectation. it was juicy,  filling and great combination of flavors and the chutney gave it an over the roof kick. 

all went well our stay didnt seemed rushed (being a 2 hour sit time) and all was impeccable. 

definitely a must eat for lunch dinner and weekend brunch they have an amazing menu if ever in the south west.",GREtE3e8msdyh0fRW2SNqA,0,0,4,GAumhs7ePDcZf9YBt2LaDw
5882956,2014-06-08,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Some good friends of ours recommended that we should try out DW Bistro. Although it's on the other side of town from where we live, it was very worth the drive over there. 

We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our table. It was a beautiful spring day so we, like the rest of that nights guests, sat outside on the porch - which was really cozy. The inside was really nice too, so when the summer heats up it will still be a very nice place to visit. 

Our waiter, upon hearing that this was our very first visit to DW Bistro, took very good care of us. He gave us his recommendations, and if we had any questions about the menu, he patiently explained them to us. 

We ended up trying the jerk fried calamari for an appetizer (1/2 portion was more than enough for two), and then went for the New Mexican slow pork and pork jerk shoulder. They were both very tasty, but our favorite was the New Mexican bowl. The portions were huge, and we brought home plenty of leftovers for the next day. 

When we had if shied the waiter brought us a complimentary carrot cake since this was our first visit. We will definitely come back for more!",K2ZoDG-9QAi5ErTAVRW8pg,0,0,5,k-7KN4bhOAIOkm7kgKDvhw

With its roots in New Mexican cuisine, DW Bistro has a little something we may have tried before but with a twist.  Their chilaquiles are some of the best I have ever had (I grew up in Austin, chilaquiles are everywhere).  I am hard pressed to name another place that creates them any better.  My second favorite dish is their calamari; you can't order this at brunch but don't worry, their dinner is just as delightful.  For my fellow wine drinkers, their wines are on point, always changing and reasonably priced. 

This is a great date spot or a fun place to have dinner/brunch/drinks with friends.  The atmosphere is fun, energetic and yet comfortable.  Do yourself a favor and try both dinner and brunch here.

Went with a bunch of my girlfriends for a birthday dinner, and we all had a great time! The wait staff was very friendly and fast! I had the short ribs and liked it but felt it needed a little more flavor something was missing either salt or a seasoning it just needed one more thing, but I would def recommend it and get it again (prob just add salt myself) the daily mash that came with is was DELICIOUS and the vegetables that came with it, eehhh I could of done without. Other menu items ordered was the salmon (which I had a taste and LOVED! I thought it was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside) and fried chicken (my friends didn't like it). All in all we had a blast and I will def be back .

Plot twist, I came here for a birthday dinner instead of brunch (which I have heard is phenomenal...) and I second all the great reviews that have been written before!  

The service was top notch. Our waters were never less than half full, our server was talkative and friendly but not overly so, really down to earth staff.  And the food! AH-MAZING!  The Jerk Fried Chicken is definitely spicy spicy but the flavor was wonderful. I also had their chicken pasta which was some of the best chicken pasta I'd ever had in Vegas. It helps that it's so pretty when it comes out (w/ edible flowers!). The only disappointing thing on the menu was the fried plantains - they were a bit dry and doused in honey which made them almost too sweet.  Got a carrot cake for dessert which was DELICIOUS!

5918742,2011-09-07,4,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Plenty of natural lighting, vibrant color scheme (white and orange), and tasteful decor instantly scores an A on my restaurant decorating score card.  And the cheerful greetings and friendly smiles vaporizes any lingering traces of everyday life stress that you might have brought with you as you crossed over the threshold. As far as I was concerned, I was in near Zen state to enjoy whatever deliciously food the kitchen has to offer from their Restaurant Week lunch menu.


As I was seated at my table, I was offered a choice of DW's own beverage creation. I opted for the Pomegranate Iced Tea, which was served in a tall slender glass with a wedge of lemon.  It was refreshing and not at all tart, a great start to any meal or a pick me up after a spa treatment. And below is my review of the three courses served as part of the RW DW Bistro's Lunch Prix-Fixe menu. 


First Course: It was a tough choice, but I went with the DW Spanish Chorizo with Shrimp & Summer Tomatoes (instead of the Farmers Market Fresh Berry Salad with Grilled Pineapple & Jerk Pomegranate Dressing - which garnered a lot of attention from the ladies at the next table while they were still debating what to order).  With the elegant and not over the top presentation, fantastic flavors from the Spanish Chorizo and nicely cooked shrimp and tantalizing tomatoes, this was easily my favorite item of the meal.  And lucky for me, it is available on their regular menu!


Second Course: 

Trio of Sliders. Maybe it was the whole food truck phenomenon in the past year, but my mind was made up when I read sliders.  Although I did forced myself to read the remaining options, out of standardized test taking habits. The plate of sliders on mini brioche buns and sweet potato fries looks great.  The sliders individually are small (smaller than Slidin' Thru's sliders) but all three of them combined into up a fair amount of food.


The first slider I tried was the Jamaican Jerk Pork, which left a noticeable puddle of grease on the plate and underside of the bun. My first and only Fuku Truck burger experience, complete with the horribly grease-soaked buns that I suffered through did an instant replay in my head before I managed to locate the mental stop play button.  Luckily, it was a lot less grease, but still a sharp drop from the excitement from the first course. 


Slider #2 was the mini-me-sized DW Turkey Burger.  The turkey was juicy, and the mango pear apple chutney combined to make miniaturized fireworks in my mouth.  If the regular sized burger has the same juicy turkey, then I will happily order that again on my next trip back.  Favorite #2!


The last slider I ate was the New Mexican Red Chili Pork Slider.  It has a kick to it, but I felt that it was missing something. Maybe crispy fried onions for a little crunchy texture or over-easy quail eggs for the addition of the rich and creaminess of the egg.


Third Course:

DW Trio of Desserts featuring Red Velet Cake (was good), Lemon-Lime Pudding with a fresh Blueberry (a spoonful is not enough,I want more!) and Jamaican Black Bottom Banana Cream Pie (Not sure if this was what I was served? But the chocolate dominated the other flavors, which wasn't bad as I have a weak spot for chocolates).  


Overall, the lunch was good.  Definitely top notched wait staff that flawlessly attend to the guests while they dine.  The appetizers seems to be the star here,at least for me, and I would come back just for that section of the menu alone. 


Ambiance:  5/5  From the other reviews I am not alone in thinking that they hit a home run with their interior decorating concept and execution.  Care to give me your interior designer and contractor as a referral?


Service:  5/5  Just simply pleasant without being over the top.


Price:  4.5/5  Looking at the pricing and the portions of the regular menu items, it is a nice lunch spot to go to recharge for the rest of your day.  Items are mostly in the $10-$13 range, which is more than the average lunch specials, but is a great deal considering the upscale surroundings and pleasant service.


Food:  4/5  Some items are perfect, others needs some more tweaking are needed. Overall, still great food.


Location:  SW Las Vegas.  Pretty far for out-of-town visitors staying on the Strip.  Definitely a cool spot for locals that work or living in the area.

Solid 4.5 stars!  I am an excited fan hungry for more.  Burp!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,10,9,4,CBaKSfIZzJbcDgKEBJUuCg
5920960,2011-08-12,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Hands Down, the best restaurant i've been too since living here in Las Vegas. One of the chefs, Chef Green made a portion of our food and delivered not only a great presentation but an amazing burst of flavor on our pallets. 

We went for brunch, everyone was so friendly. The ambiance was relaxing and inviting. The owners came around and spoke with us. He's such a humble individual, you'd never know he was the owner until he says his name. 

I'm a photographer and the art they have in their main lobby is AMAZING. Must see for yourself!

 I need to go back and try their lollipop chicken. I mean Jamaican infused goodness, great services and a fun environment to be in, that's a recipe for a great experience.

5928889,2014-10-25,3,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"I had heard good things about DW Bistro, but never really wanted to try it because I'm very picky and Jamaican food wasn't very appealing to me. A good friend suggested this place for brunch, so I finally gave it a try earlier this month. The ambience inside is nice with bright lights and artwork on the walls.

The first bad sign was when I looked at the menu and didn't really see anything I wanted to eat. For me, its not good when a menu is complicated! I remembered seeing pictures of shrimp scampi and mac and cheese here on yelp. But unfortunately, those were on their dinner menu. I decided to try the jerk fried chicken and waffles. I asked our server how spicy it was and he said that it was pretty spicy. Then I asked him if they could make it mild and he replied ""No, we don't mess with the levels of spiciness."" My friend and I thought he was joking at first, but unfortunately he was serious. I was surprised, since most restaurants will tone down spicy foods if requested. Plus, that made me wonder if everything really was prepared fresh? Then he asked ""you don't like spicy food? Are you from China?"" I wanted to say WTF does that have to do with anything?? I decided to keep cool and replied ""no."" Finally, he suggested the Jamaican curry chicken for something more mild, so that is what I ordered. 

Our food took a while to come out, but when it finally did, they made everything look pretty. My chicken curry wasn't spicy as promised. However, they were stingy with the chicken and it was kind of dry. They also went overboard with the vegetables. At the end, I got tired of digging through all those veggies just to find the chicken and rice so I stopped eating. Of course our server made a comment to me saying ""oh, you didn't like it?"" Umm, does it look like I did?? I can't remember what my friend ordered, but he enjoyed his food. Like I said, I am picky. :P We decided to share a dessert. My friend asked our server what he recommended, and he replied ""Well, we have an excellent carrot cake but she (looking at me) doesn't like carrot cake."" What a smart @ss! Then he looked at me and said ""was I right?"" Lol, he WAS right. We ordered a slice of their peanut butter pie. It took a very long time to come out, but it was delicious and the highlight of my meal!! The only weird thing about it was that they put raspberry sauce on the plate, which we both agreed that it wasn't a good mix.

Would I come back again? Probably not. If I ever have to, it would only be for dinner! Warning: watch out for their smart @ss servers!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,2,3,Jqnf6NnP1y2jjFY45hHBOw
5930123,2012-01-08,0,qqs7LP4TXAoOrSlaKRfz3A,"Huge portions, great prices, delicious food, and awesome service. Tried a whole bunch of stuff and everything was pretty damn tasty. The bbq rib app was really tender, sweet and just a hint spicy. The shrimp and chorizo with crostini special was really tasty with plenty of large shrimp. Their jerk chicken salad was probably one of the best salads I've come across with orange segments, tender chicken, macadamia nuts, grilled veggies and a mango vinaigrette.

Their entrees were humongous and could feed two easily. I ordered the oven roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl which was really tasty although it would've been nice if some veggies had been included (but it's okay since I had salad beforehand.) I also got to try the jamaican curry chicken which was delicious, the curry soup, the ahi tuna salad and the grilled jerk chicken breast (which came with about 4 pieces of grilled chicken!) Honestly, nothing was mediocre and everything was under $20 which is a great deal for a restaurant of this quality.

Also had the dessert sampler which included their dark chocolate mousse cake, red velvet cake, lemon-lime pudding, and carrot cake although by that point, we all were about to explode. I'm not a huge dessert person so I'd have to say their desserts were the weakest link BUT still pretty good. The cakes themselves were a bit dry but that was alleviated by the frosting.

The service was phenomenal. Bryce came by several times and treated questions with humor and knowledge. Our server was also awesome and even the other customers at the restaurant were super friendly!

I've been here for breakfast/brunch as well as for dinner and on our most recent visit, I was less than impressed with their New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork bowl. The flavors just weren't dynamic enough. It was spicy, but bland which seems weird. The jerk fried calamari was the star of our meal. Just the right sweet to spicy ratio. I have enjoyed a number of their breafast dishes on previous visits, but nothing has stood out as something I need to come back for regularly. Service has been hit and miss on my visits to DW as well. Service is always friendly, but can drag at times.
