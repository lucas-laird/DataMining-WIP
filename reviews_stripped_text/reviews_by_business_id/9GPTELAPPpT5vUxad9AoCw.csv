I must say they do have the edge in their mango cake in comparison to Goldilocks. The cake and whipped topping is light while the mango is perfectly sweet, however all the other products I think are inferior to Goldilocks. In addition, the portion sizes here are more for like a family of 4 rather than Goldilocks which has bigger options. The bigger options are more ideal since these cakes and rolls are usually brought to Filipino parties. IMO even the ensaymada at Golidlocks is better because I prefer the texture of the pastry itself. Lastly Goldilocks puts together amazing children's cakes, I'm not to sure if Red Ribbon can compete with them there since they have significantly less displays. To add to all of this, better value at Golidlocks with better tasting cakes. If Goldilocks was in Seafood City they would probably do more business.

They have a small selection of food, which is perfectly fine, but I will say that I come here specially for either the Arroz Caldo (chicken rice porridge....ask for lemon packets and fish sauce on the side because it is delicious with those!) or Pancit Palabok (Filipino noodle dish...look it up. Also, good with lemon). You can order those ala carte or as meals (I know a couple of options comes with your choice of empanada or slice of cake). You can order Palabok as a party tray as well, but just be sure to invite me.

I know there's two other Filipino restaurants next door to Red Ribbon that carry Palabok, but I really enjoy theirs. If you like thick noodles, look elsewhere though.

Between the popular Filipino bakery chains, Red Ribbon sits atop my list. Why you ask? Because its taste is consistently good across the board. Products are always fresh and service is superb every time. Whenever I visit any one of their stores, it always reminds me of the hospitality and friendliness Filipinos are known for.

Everything that I've tried from Red Ribbon from cakes and pastries to their mini snack offerings like Palabok and Arroz Caldo have been good. Among our favorites are their Chicken Empanadas, I have yet to find a better version anywhere in Las Vegas or LA. Perfect flaky buttery crust with an abundant chicken filling. The kids favorites are their butter Mamon and Cheesy Ensaimada. Of course they're famous for their Mango Cakes that's always a hit to bring to parties, Filipino and non Filipinos alike. It's very light and just the right amount of sweetness to let the true mango flavor shine thru. Recently they've introduced a new variation which is called Mango Supreme (starts at $20.99) that's even better than the original one, more prominent mango flavor.

I like the cakes here especially mango, sans rival, chocolate mousse, choco mocha crunch and crema de fruta. Their desserts aren't extremely sweet which is unusual for Filipino desserts. A lot of Filipinos are diabetics. They use real fruits and the cakes are soft. They have the best mango cake ever. 

Their mamon is super soft and buttery good. If you like mangoes but don't want cake, the mango bars are great. Chewy and sweet bars with mangoes. They also have banana slice, brazo de Mercedes, mocha roll, ensaymada, empanada, siopao (steamed pork buns) which are pretty good.  I'm not a fan of ube...but I heard from reliable sources that their ube cake is delicious. Their palabok (noodles with sauce, pork, fried garlic, sliced hardboiled eggs and green onions) is yummy.

It rivaled that of my aunts...and THAT says alot as she made the most amazing lumpia ever.  

I think that the sauce is one of the best parts about it...so this one was realllly good as it had just the right amount of garlic in it.  Very fresh ingredients, too!  Try it out!  

I also brought back a ton of ensymada and mamon.  The mocha mamon is really good!  Wish they sold that in Chicago!  Next time I hit up Red Ribbion, I'm definitely gonna try out the empanadas!  Sad I missed out!",m3qH3d97shbvSCtmUrpDFA,1,0,4,TdX85Z3mskuwEKUmYx9kyQ

Red ribbon is always good and always a must stop for folks who don't have access to Filipino bakeries.",j9IwA4W65qRI_oJW-c-0Wg,0,0,4,HRhrlq5_zraDi4JazzWxvA

After walking over a mile from the Thomas and Mack to that shameful, bakery-less Vons on Trop. and then to my car parked at Freakin' Frog, I said let's get on down the road. He wanted to try out Albertson's but they didn't have a large enough cake. 

At 5 seconds to 10 PM, we ran into Red Ribbon and they told us they were closed. We ignored that and told them we needed to buy a cake. Wesley quickly picked out a chocolate cake, they wrote on it for us, and we each purchased some purple yam pastries. I got some sort of cake, he got a sweet roll. Now Wesley is totally not into any ethnic food, so he wasn't too pleased with the pastry and gave the leftovers to me - each item was just okay, not as good as the homemade stuff that I've had. I have no idea how the cake he purchased tasted but it sure was pretty!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,1,3,dYCYQhgDdBvbYKzsVo-0LA
