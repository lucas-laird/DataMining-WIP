Their 1/2 pound burritos are the size of the $.69 cent burritos - they consistantly range from 5 to 6 ounces instead of 8. Which means for every two burritos you buy, they save the cost of one! They skimp on cheese, red/green sauce, sour cream, tomatos, beans and meat. The hard tacos are always broken in half so its impossible to eat, and they are all lettuce with a dab of meat and a few strands of cheese. Since the Hollywoood Video/GameCrazy next door closed they are really cutting corners including using the .69 cent tortillas on the .99 cent burritos. CiCi Pizza is opening where the GC/HWV was...it does not bode well for this unit. If you want GOOD Del Taco...stay away from this unit...go to Bruce & E.

Then to just be told to pull around and order at the window lol. Gotta love fast food druve thru mishaps... You have to make sure you use the coupons they send out in the mail because if you are like me and don't like paying full price for something you can get for half you will enjoy them :-) I have somehow switched over from loving Taco Hell I mean Taco Bell.. to Del Taco simply because of the deals they always have. Plus Taco Bell doesn't sit well with me... literally lol. Listen they are both crappy for you however I prefer the Del Taco. They have more options and better ones at that. If you like chili cheese fries they have some killer ones on the menu. Just stay close to the bathroom afterwards and you'll be fine!,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,3,2,3,53qdEGQjEyb433GOJ7KBPQ

We did the drive through, and sat in our car eating it. One thing that all items had in common were that they just felt heavy with grease. we didn't want to put anything down in the car because it would get grease on it. 

The staff was very nice that we interacted with, and I'm sure if you pick better things, maybe you would enjoy things better. We went because of a coupon we received, but honestly...when I saw it pop up in my places I checked into list on Yelp, I could not remember going here.
