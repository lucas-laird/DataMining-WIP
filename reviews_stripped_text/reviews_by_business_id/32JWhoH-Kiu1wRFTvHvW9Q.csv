I tried the habanero cheddar pie; A slight kick to it and the most delicious rotisserie chicken & homestyle vegetables! You can take home a pie and cook it or  call one hour ahead and it will be baked and ready for you.  If you are anywhere nearby, stop over at this wonderful shop right now!

If I had one else criticism that would justify the 4/5, it's that there's no bottom crust to the pie.  It's just a top layer over the pot pie, so basically a stew with a top pie layer on it.

1448046,2014-11-17,3,32JWhoH-Kiu1wRFTvHvW9Q,"Similar to Papa Murphy's, Pie Me Over is a take-and-bake business model, except with a different product. If you like pies but hate the hassle of baking, or the flavor of frozen, this place is a good option to have.

The pies here are tasty, but as Norm said, I'd enjoy more customization options. The freshness is evident, and the rotisserie chicken especially was tasty in the pies, but so far the only thing you can specialize is the crust. Owner stated her favorite was the cheddar, other reviews tend to favor the habanero. Taste is only slight, but the habanero was my favorite as well- buttery crust has almost a Ritz cracker flavor to it, but flaky and soft with a tiny hint of spice to it.

Price is competitive: crust selection changes the price a bit for each size, but the individual is just under $7 and an ample portion. Apartment size is meant to feed 2 (roughly $15), with a larger family size available too. If you're just a couple, I'd get two individual size pies with different crusts until you find your favorite.

Service was friendly from owner and cashier. When owner found out I'd found the business through Yelp, she made a few comments about how they have one ""weird review up,"" and discussed the customer's visit.  I found the comments unprofessional, particularly given that Yelp is essentially free marketing and the review she was referring to was the only reason I'd even heard about the business to begin with, let alone stopped by. 

If you like the product, hold on to their punch card: nine pies of any size will get you a free individual! Hoping they eventually expand to other flavors of savory pies, or even maybe offer take-and-bake dessert pies- maybe try this as a holiday special? They also had sliced date bread available at the register.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,5,3,IAg4u52vBfsThmXRlxNW9g

All the flavor is in the crust, and I would prefer some more spices/flavors in the filling.

It's a take-and-bake shop, although they will heat up the pie for you if you call ahead (you still have to do take-out, there is no place to sit and eat it there). They have a case of fresh and frozen pies. They make chicken pot pies, beef pot pies, and veggie pot pies. All pies can have different crusts: original, cheddar, habanero cheddar, and garlic. I chose an 'apartment size' (2 servings) cheddar crust chicken pot pie. It was delicious. It was full of tender and flavorful chicken, veggies (carrots were obvious cut by hand), and a delectable sauce. The crust had a great cheddar flavor. I thought for sure I would have leftovers, but no such luck, it tasted too good!

1793914,2015-07-23,0,32JWhoH-Kiu1wRFTvHvW9Q,"I love chicken pot pies. So when I saw this place open, I just had to try it. The pies are cute and the sixes are deceiving. Im a big eater, and didnt even think their medium size pie- The Apartment- would feel me up. I only ended up eating half and was full! So they pack more then you think. 

I got the garlic crust pie, and while I can smell the garlic while it was cooking, I couldn't really taste it. What I did taste was the over powering flavor and texture of onion. I'm not a fan of onion. But that's all I tasted, so I was extremely disappointed. There was a little too much of peas in the pie, and while the carrots were a good amount, they should be sliced into halves, or quarters even, instead of full rounds. It would make for much easier eating and diving among plates. 

I typically rate places with a 5 star or a 1 star, so this was a tough decision for me. I will be back to give them another shot and try the habenero crust, and I will review again. 

I hope the owners take to heart the reviews left by myself and other reviews. This can be a great concept, but they need to take it a step further. Adding a chicken and potato pot pie would be a good start. As well as beef pot pies. Not everyone likes chicken. I also liked the idea from another reviewer asking for a curry pie (who doesnt like spicy food!?). All good ideas!",fS86t0IvNj-kDBae2mJHSQ,0,0,3,x-jwqyl_p5fi8LH1Md5_pA

I ate the chicken pot pie. My Mother and husband had the beef pie. 

Both types of pies were chock full of chicken, vegetables and beef with a delicious cream inside. The crust was thick and delicious. The pie was bigger than what you can get at the super market and it's made with all fresh ingredients.

I was just getting over a cold so I was in need of some hot  food to get me through the night.
Saw this place and decided to come in.
They have chicken pot pie (regular ) veggie pot pies for you vegetarians :) chicken curry pot pies and sirloin pot pies.
I got the regular chicken pot pie with regular crust.

You bring these pies home and cook them in your oven so you can eat them fresh of course.
They give you a list of directions which was very helpful because my pot pie cooked beautifully in my oven.
Also pretty simple directions .

40 mins later I take my first bite and it was soo good guys.
Creaminess was perfect, wasn't over salted :)
The chicken was amazingly tender and it was like rotisserie chicken so it was in strips.
Veggies were soft and just right, and ate those up too !

This was one of the freshest pot pies I could have eaten.

Will definitely be coming back and I think I will be getting a chicken pot pie with cheddar crust next time! Yum.

Also you can accumulate points here! So every pot pie gets you more points:)

Probably one of the best decisions I have made in a while with my take out. When I walked in the staff was very prompt to fill me in on what they had to offer seeing as I have never been there. Prices were very reasonable. Next time though, I will be getting a Large because of my boyfriend. Originally wanted to get a garlic crust, but they were all out. I guess that's what I get for coming in 30 mins before they closed. So I opted for a Cheddar Crust Chicken Pot Pie. 

Instructions were very easy to follow. Cooked at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes and came out perfect. The crust was cheesy and flaky at the same time...so good! I find myself to be a very picky eater, usually pushing aside vegetables. But with this...somehow I found myself loving everything!

Although they recently started offering a delicious beef pot pie option, the chicken pot pie is king in my opinion. You can order your pie in 3 different sizes, uncooked or frozen and I think you can opt to have the pie cooked and ready if you order over the phone. The pies come in a variety of crusts: regular, cheddar, habañero cheddar and garlic crust. You can't go wrong with any of the crust flavors. I almost wish they had an all-crust pie. It's that good. The meat to pie ratio actually improved since my first experience which gives Pie Me Over a high mark. They are closed on Sunday so order ahead if you want to eat your pie during football season. They include baking instructions and it's pretty easy and affordable. I order at least 3 pies and store them in the freezer for a nice semi-home-cooked meal if I don't feel like eating out or cooking. I loathe microwave dinners, don't you?

This new year started out a bit rough for me and Pie Me Over was there to provide filling and delicious comfort foods. You can call ahead to get a pie cooked for you or call ahead/walk in to get a ready to bake pie to cook at home (there is no seating in the store). You can freeze the pies or cook the, immediately. They can provide you with directions at the store or you can always log on to their website. I've dabbled in a few different sizes and flavor combos, but I think my favorite is taking home a ready-to-bake cheddar crusted, apartment sized pie. It's perfect for two people and the cheddar isn't too overwhelming. If I end up freezing it, I let it defrost the night before, pop up in the oven during the day, and reheat it later for dinner if I don't quickly devour it myself. It leaves my house smelling like a home cooked meal. If you are particular about a certain pie, make sure you call ahead, because they do sell out. For the vegetarians in your life, there are veggie pies, with cauliflower to replace the chicken. The folks who run this place are always helpful and down to earth. 

Buyer beware - make sure to check out their opening hours. The worst is craving one of their delicious pies, only to find out they're closed. Do like me and buy extra pies to freeze for later :)",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,7,5,5,3ld3CLlHTf6NTAb9sfNpVA

The crust on theses little jewels is really great . I wish it were on the bottom layer of the pie as well since the crust is really good and you want more after eating the top layer crust. They have different flavored crusts and I had both the cheese and the regular - both were great ! I have been twice and got chicken pies both times.

I set my oven to 375F at convection (400F on normal bake temp), covered the crust edges once browned so that the center could finish cooking, and the pie turned out super scrumptious!  I do prefer the chicken version over the beef only because I thought the beef gravy was a bit too thin for my liking.  Both chicken and beef pies had relatively generous and even amounts of flavorful meat and veggies, and for me, the individual sizes were more than enough to make my tummy feel satisfied and full.  For larger appetites, I'd get the next size up.  Out of the different crusts, my favorite was the habanero cheddar.  I'm glad there wasn't any bottom or side crusts because that means more delicious filling!

I stopped in yesterday and bought two chicken pot pies--one with cheddar crust and one with habanero cheddar crust.  They were in individual boxes and the boxes were not marked so we had to guess which was which.  I din't learn this until I got home.  

They gave me a sheet with baking instructions that were very accurate.  I baked mine a little longer than they suggested but I wanted a nicely browned crust. 

After baking, I turned the pot pies over onto plates and a bit stuck to the bottom which is what I expected.  I have made my own and I know this happens.

The filling of the pot pies was good.  You can tell the freshness by the carrots alone.  When I bit into the carrot slices, I could taste the fresh taste of carrot that hasn't been frozen but is a fresh produce item.

A couple of things about my experience.  I wish I had noticed the lack of marking crust flavors on the box before I got home.  That being said, my wife and I found almost no difference in taste between the two.  The habanero just was not evident.  I also find that chicken is the only option and your flavors are determined by the crust, the chance for different tastes is very limited.  What I'd really like is a curry chicken pot pie that you could taste and it wouldn't be that much extra to do.

The pot pies were OK.  I know I'm paying for fresh ingredients and they roast their own chickens, but the cost for the size of the pie is high and maybe it has to be.  I won't need their buyers' card for getting a free one after the correct number of purchases.

Tip:  If you're going to Pie Me Over, look on the east side of Rainbow for the Firehouse Subs.  Pie Me Over is in back behind the buildings in the front of 6070 South Rainbow.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,26,12,3,KvYERyHLE7848dBhVcg71g

Crusts come in Regular, Cheddar, Cheddar Habanero, and Garlic. Every flavor comes in Individual Size and Apartment Size (serves two). Some of the flavors are offered in a Large Size (serves four). We learned that the chicken in their potpies is from rotisserie chicken that they make on site. I like that the pies and the ingredients are very fresh. Pies are offered fresh (to be made no later than the next day) or frozen to save for later.

My husband and I decided to try the Sirloin Pie with Cheddar Habanero in the apartment size. The owner gave us detailed instructions for baking along with a piece of paper to reiterate her instructions. I used my convection oven per the instructions and the pie was perfect. The aroma drifted to the far reaches of my home and invited me to dinner. 

The most important part is the taste of the pie. Taste was a 5/5. The sirloin steak was flavorful and in large pieces. The ratio of meat to vegetable was good for me. The crust had enough cheddar and enough habanero heat to satisfy my taste buds. Serious food kudos on the ability to flavor the crust without overwhelming the pie flavors. Yum, yum, yum!

My only suggestion would be for a bottom crust layer and a tad more filling. Maybe they omit the bottom layer because it bakes better at home without it, but I do think a second layer of crust would make it even better. Also, the filling seemed like it could have been packed a little more to make it a heartier meal. I supplemented the apartment size with a side of roasted vegetables and would consider it a lighter meal for two. 

We'll definitely be back. I have to try the signature Chicken Pie and I want to try some other crust flavors as well.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,6,6,4,R_fgBu1GXo13HgsFGjg02w

Facility: it's located in a strip mall in the South corner. It's a small, clean shop that's just has the counter to order your food and some displays. 

Service:  the gentleman was very polite when I came in and tried to help, but a lady, who I think was the owner, stepped in and took over. She was polite and talked me through their choices and answered all my questions. She stated they were putting the instructions in the bag, but there wasn't any in there when I got home. I called and she talked me through them, and they were super easy. Don't be thrown off when they answer the phone ""Hello?"" either.  Not sure why they don't identify their business, but it's them. 

Food:  I got two individual pies...a plain and a jalapeño cheddar. I ate the jalapeño, of course. The crust was delicious!  It was flaky, and I could taste the cheddar and even a slight spicy hint. The inside had a good flavor in the gravy and big chunks of chicken and veggies.  

Overall: As many other people have said, the menu is pretty small, but I did enjoy what they have.  I guess it's better to do one thing good, then a lot of things mediocre.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,3,3,jpbye3obVDxv1tT1dVv5hg

Although they do offer frozen, I picked up the fresh, ""apartment"" size for the 2 of us. Took it home and baked it as directed. It took the full 50 mins and the wonderful smell throughout our house, of this cooking was almost unbearable. We couldn't even wait until it cooled properly to cut into it.

Only bummer is that he didn't tell me till Saturday night, too late to be a contender. I suggested we have it for dinner Sunday, I was bummed that they weren't open. Just need to plan ahead next time.

We delayed it for one more night. By this time, my husband was beyond yankering and moved to craving desperation to fulfill his taste.  Now he was expecting something fantastic.  Pie Me Over truly delivered.  

We both had chicken, he had the original and I had the cheddar crust.  There was just a hint of cheddar which I appreciate.  It shouldn't be so strong and overpower the filling.  

The filling was made with fresh ingredients that were perfectly cooked.  Plenty of chicken, right amount of vegetables and the sauce was the perfect consistency.  And I'm glad there was no potatoes.  That's just a filler that makes it more starchy.  Keep the recipe as is.

FYI, they make the sirloin beef on Fridays and Saturdays; veggie on Tuesdays; any other days you want these, you'll have to settle for a frozen pie if they have it.  You can probably call them to set aside for you.

As it stands the offer chicken or veggie only, with 3 crust options.

However the veggie filling was a little unbalanced... which is understandable if they are making a ton of pies at once... but my pie had mostly onions and peas with practically no carrots. It did have plenty of chicken though which made up for the loss of carrots.

The Chicken Pot Pie they bake is the best I've had outside from being homemade!!!
Flavors had depth, with the rich creaminess of the stew, seasoning and the crust came together real well. I could tell that after one bite the pie was made with lots of TLC. 

The restaurant is a small, takeout-only place, basically you pick the pies up uncooked, they give you written instructions on the length of time to cook depending on the size and you heat them at home. If you don't feel like turning on the oven, you can call them an hour in advance and they'll heat it up for you. They make Chicken Pot Pies, Veggie Pies and Top Sirloin Beef Pies with different flavors of crust Regular, Cheddar, Habanero Cheddar and Garlic. I felt the prices were reasonable considering they are made from scratch.

Upon entering I was greeted right away. I told them this was my first time and the woman (the owner) behind the counter was quick to explain it all to me. 
 There isn't a lot of options. Chicken and Veggie then you get to pick your crust and size. I wanted one for dinner so I got a large non frozen chicken with regular crust and then 2 individual frozen chicken pies, one with cheddar crust, one with habanero crust. Gotta try them all!
The instructions were put in the bag with the pies. I made the large, it smelled great! It tasted great.

I am a fan of chicken pot pie, green peas pie etc, but they only have chicken pot pie & some kind of vegetarian pot pie, I wish they have green peas pot pie too, cause i tried the one in Austria & that was pretty good with good memory. All you will see in the Pie Me Over store are frozen pot pie, they hv 3 sizes, individual,  apartment (for 2 pp), & big round one for family size, it is not cheap,  prices range from 6, 7 dollars to 20 bucks or so for a pie,  but the ingredients are fresh & it is made 2 order. They do not have one already made at all.  You can either buy the frozen one & bake it at home right away, or call to pre-order one an hour ahead & pick it up. I see people would just buy the frozen one home. I didnt have time to bake so I just pre-ordered one & pick it up later. Same price!  Next time I would call in to pre-order beforehand. My kids love it, it is not salty like the commercial ones you can buy it in market, it is more like home-made pot pie. My daughter said she wishes it can be more juicy like having the creamy soup inside the pie kind, I think it is alright, still good, not too juice, but not dry either.
