97374,2015-10-18,0,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,So I went to the lab last Sunday for the first time after being recommended by a co worker. He told me all about the burgers but once I got there that went out the window as soon as I saw the carne asada fries with shrimp. They were delicious the service was phenomenal and on top of that the complementary chips and dip were delicious. I will definitely be coming back here very soon. The next time I go back I will definitely try out the burgers.,-78WfLq3UlvvYdXsDYz7PQ,0,0,5,QxtCCBp3KEQLTF_dd7FAqw

We came because we saw the pictures on Instagram, when we got there none of that was on the menu. He told us that it wasn't on the menu but didn't explain if we could order that or not. It took a really long time for the food to come out. He explained that a cook had cut himself and had a big group ahead of us so we were aware it would be a minute. The bulgogi burger was really good, fries were good and Cali chick was decent - prob should stick with the specialty, burgers. I'm giving it 4 stars because they apologized numerous times for the wait and only charged us $20. I will be giving them a try again because of the customer service alone, and hope to have a 5 star experience!",PJOfI2AwCuLGsShHf0TAXg,0,0,4,EMU-0x4qU18JWJFCdkwRzw

There was a man sitting near the door, I had no idea he worked there because he was texting very intently but he came over and took my drink order.  The place is very clean and spacious.  My niece had a hard time finding it because it is in the back of a complex that didn't have many cars in it but she finally found it.  When the server came over, we all ordered the BLT Burger, I ordered it well done with no tomatoes and mayo on the side.  My brother asked for his burger medium well, no tomatoes and EXTRA mayo.  My niece ordered it medium well and NO mayo!  I figured there was a 99% chance he would confuse this so I repeated the order.  We also ordered regular fries and garlic parm fries.  It took a while for the food to come out considering we were the only ones there.  My burger was a little bit pink inside (remember I ordered it well done), but I was so hungry by then since I skipped breakfast anticipating all of the calories so I ate it anyway.  The burger was delicious!  Super juicy and a lot of lettuce so I felt I got my veggies in!  The fries were hot and delicious, I really liked the garlic fries.  The service was slow and there was an error with my burger, but I would come back and try it again.  It was $35 for our 3 burgers and 2 baskets of different fries so price is right.",6gL9KyY04VchdaqhYYoKUQ,0,0,3,ohnHoEdtbW7ZU6UWFflNTA

The pastrami was thick like ham and the burger was overloaded with a thick unappealing chili. The patty was dry and the burger looked liked a sloppy joe made by a teenager. The fries were lukewarm and dry. I couldnt even tell the server how bad the food was without embarrasing my server.  I just paid the $10.70 tab and left and would never come back. I wanted to personally call the owner and inform him/her how bad the hamburger was. I sure hope this place improves and survives .  

The problem is this place is a mexican restaurant and a burger joint ( a strange combination that does not work)  and the cook obviously is experienced in Mexican food but cannot make a basic hamburger . you have to be a lousy cook to make one of the worse hamburgers in memory",bS3FEJGL4S2J8ypC979b7Q,1,1,1,ojwQmKy0YU_hPs4GJGb-Yw

Both were cooked the exact same with no pink. i had ordered to go and when i got to the car i looked at them. I took them back inside because i had extra onions when i didnt want any and due to improper cook on meat. The guy said it cooked more because it sat in the box. It only sat in the box for a few minutws and it should be cooked to factor that in. Angered I walked out.

I wasn't sure what to make of the place--Was it a Mexican food spot? Was it a burger joint? I stopped trying to put it in a box and have accepted that it is it's own creature. I can tell you this--it's definitely a fast food spot. 

What I get:
*lemon pepper chicken wings (pro tip: get them cooked extra crispy)
*carne asada tacos 

This is a small shop that puts out consistently good food.  They have a diverse menu (which generally concerns me; La Parilla gets it right) so there is something for everyone to try and enjoy.  I've been here plenty of times and have eaten my two trusty dishes more times than I can count. You might like the wild burger options or the Mexican sodas.  I can only say that I have never been disappointed. It's greasy fast food and they cook it well.  What more needs to be said?",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,1,1,4,EDXk2pu3Gu3QiYcadTF8Rw

1488901,2016-06-02,6,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"I stopped in today for a quick takeout  lunch. I wasn't in the mood for a burger and ordered their 10 pc chicken wings instead for $8.99. I requested half garlic parmesan and the other half as lemon pepper.

As I waited for my order, I looked around the dining area and was pleasantly surprised how this place got a new facelift both in and out since my last visit. The dining area is huge with lots of roomy places to move around. Then I noticed they don't have the option for fountain soda, but have good selections of drinks in the fridge. I like my drinks with ice. So to me it was a downfall.

After 10 minutes, my chicken wings were freshly made, piping hot with a ranch dipping sauce. The wings, to me, seem bigger here than other places. They were crispy and cooked perfectly! But darn it! I just realized the great garlic aroma from the garlic parm (hence the name) and taste were MIA! What I also didn't like about the parmesan cheese used, it was grainy or kinda pasty (can't quite describe it) for me to eat. It definitely lacked that robust flavor from the garlic. 

On the other hand, the lemon pepper wings were good but needed more tartness from the lemon powder. These would have been awesome chicken wings if better quality seasonings were used. The ranch dressing can also be replaced with a better quality. It's effortless to make one from scratch versus premade. This would have been a winning combination!

As usual, the staff here was wonderful and friendly! It's located in a small plaza on East Flamingo between Eastern and Eucalyptus Avenue.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,10,8,3,SJcY50nKX258BD-rQpF9Og

I had a burrito and some tacos. I didn't like the burrito. It had lettuce, beans, peas and carrots in it. I don't fancy the peas/carrots in a burrito. Aside from that, the asada tasted good.. That's all I really liked. 

As for the environment, music was way too loud. I don't mind music, but jeeze, it isn't a nightclub. 

Maybe I'm being hard on the place because I loved the old restaurant and old owners/management. Turn the music down, and try removing the lettuce/peas/carrots from the burrito.",4r_4feU3sXI4K-U-T1pPdw,4,4,3,WzHwNrX9dOwMT6ooed1Lag

Place was clean and the staff was friendly. The prices were OK, not too expensive but not cheap either. I got the bulgogi with a soda and it came out to be a little over 10 bucks.

The burger: 
Buns were a little dry but serviceable, would have loved to see them butter it a tiny bit. Bulgogi was very tender If not a tiny bit salty. The patty itself was slightly over medium but still flavorful and not dry. Overall it was a good burger, didn't blow my socks off but still a good gourmetish burger with interesting toppings. Will have to try some of their other interesting offerings. 

Side note, they give you chips and salsa while you wait and some Ice cream after your meal! All for free, so it definitely increases your value.

Location - situated in small shopping area near Flamingo and Eastern. Parking decent with plenty of spaces. Not sure how I would feel about this neighborhood at night. 

Restaurant - spacious, but boy of boy was the smell of cleaning products extremely potent! And not in a good way!! We could smell it as we approached the restaurant. I feel the smell even permeated on our meals, ugh! Big turn off! Pretty much the reason I won't be back. 

Food - I don't remember what my coworker ordered, but I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and Garlic Parmesan fries. Both were good portions, but again, I feel like the smell of the cleaning products seriously transferred on my food I could only stomach half of my sandwich. They came out with chips and salsa as a starter which was pretty tasty. So for my sandwich, fries, and bottled water I believe I paid roughly $16-17. I don't even know how much they charged for bottled water, since they didn't print us a receipt, but I'm guessing around $2.00. 

Service - Friendly, but slow and it wasn't even a busy lunch hour :(

Recently had the opportunity to hit this place for dinner and was a little underwhelmed. Service is polite, location is pretty basic and bare-bones and menu is exciting but didn't quite deliver.

BULGOGI BURGER: Good choice. Thick, hearty burger patty with flavorful 'gogi for a pleasant combination of flavors. The American cheese was an odd pairing but somehow, it worked.

CHEESESTEAK BURGER: Swimming in cheese, I thought I would love this. The mushrooms, onions, and pepper mixture was a little on the bland side but combined with the cheese sauce it was tasty. But the mixture somehow just didn't combine with the burger component. It felt like two separate dishes on one plate. 

GARLIC PARMESAN FRIES: Large portion, lots of parm, but no garlic. Really bummed, since I miss garlic fries from living in the Bay area where they're  all over the place. I'm also not a huge fan of skinny-cut fries but mostly I was just underwhelmed by the lack of garlic.

I'd stop by this place again, and I would try another few of their burgers. Signage outside indicates that they also sell some Mexican foods which I thought was a little odd and may be overreaching, but staff was Hispanic which may explain why they added those particular dishes.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,3,3,5KX_HfXOIP1lQFF4XIRlzQ

Food was just simply amazing! 

Everyone in the group got burgers, but man... those papusas were just calling out to me!  I looooove their twist on the pickled cabbage. One ordered the El Nino, which is a burger in the middle of two papusas and that tasted heavenly!  two ordered your typical burgers, but still tasted amazing according to them. Then we also ordered garlic parmesian, chili fries, and gravy fries. (Love the garlic parm fries!) 

As for Drinks, I ordered the jamaica which tasted fresh. Another ordered the Ensalada with their own spin of pineapple with cilantro and guava, but that was sooooooooooooooh delicious!  

Mind you, we had to take leftovers home... we were that full.

I ordered the regular burger (American) and the Garlic & parm fries. I waited a little over 20 minutes for the food. The fries are just frozen fries with parmigian cheese and garlic powder and the burger was pretty good. 
The soda fountain is out of order so canned soda it was. 
It was 110 degrees outside and 108 degrees inside. 
Now the reason I disregard the negative points mentioned above is because the owner (or I think it is) is taking orders and cooking with the help of his mom (or I think she is) and serving the food. So as an ex entrepreneur I can understand when times are tough why there is no soda fountain (syrop is expensive and you have minimums to order) and why the AC is on ""energy saving mode"" and when you cant afford employees you do it all. 
As I type this review the owner/server/cook came up to me and ofered complimentary ice cream. I thought it was because he caught me writing on Yelp and wanted to make an impression for a good review. Lol. But I saw him asking every table. 
Over all the service, though slow, was very good and the food is not bad at all. Its fresh and the place is very clean. 
The only thing that bugged me the most was the stripper wanna-be who sat behind me with her boy and had the most obnoxious perfume on her. I lost my sense of smell for a week.

2562530,2016-05-16,1,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"It saddens me to give this place two stars, but if I gave it more, I would be a liar. I had been dying to try La Parilla. Its seemed right up my alley, gourmet burgers, street tacos, a secret menu, and coke from Mexico! Well, what a disappointment! Being a mom and pop shop, I hate having to give them negative feedback, but please, let me explain. 
First I will mention the good. The beans, the shakes with churros, and the carne asada. 
Yep, that's all. The beans were homemade and flavorful. The shakes are like no other! Made with real ice cream and interesting toppers that really catch the eye, and fill the stomach. And the meat on the carne asada taco was excellent. 
I can NOT say as much for the pork, or chicken. Both of those tacos were simply average and nothing to brag about. The burgers, decent. Nothing gourmet. And why did the A-1 burger, not come with A-1? Hmmm? The wings, same, average. 
So if everything was average, why only 2 stars? 
Well, they were out of the amazing milkshakes, which still is not the ONLY reason. My boyfriend asked for rootbeer, they told us they didn't have any. Meanwhile, Barq's rootbeer is clearly in the cooler, in plain site. If that still does not justify my 2 stars, then we seen a roach, in the kitchen. THEN, after giving them the benefit of the doubt that bugs happen, and it's getting warm outside, a roach crawled across the booth, to where my daughter had to literally jump over it. She totally lost her appetite, to be honest, we all did. 
Now, the staff was accommodating, and did not charge us for our less-than-half eaten meals. We still left him a tip, but unless they get a system going, I don't see this place lasting very long.
Maybe it's the building, as many restaurants have failed here. I would love to see them make it happen here, regardless of my bad experience.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,2,2,2,ZliFZ2ny_nB5qxI4ik2mlA

The guys who work there are very nice and it looks like they enjoy what they are doing, its good to know they have a passion for what they are cooking for you! The price wasn't too bad either, it wasn't expensive but it wasn't on the cheap side either. 

 The menu was simple, but it did have a lot of variety. They have chicken burger options and a vegetarian option. They also have salads. Different flavors of fires too! When I went there they were installing a soda fountain. They had some cold drinks available though.

I tried the bulgogi burger and my boyfriend tried the cali chick burger, if I can recall. We received french fries and onion rings. The only thing reason why it wasn't 5 stars was because he miss heard our order. We thought we ordered garlic parm, but we got regular instead. So that was disappointing. Other than that, the burgers were delicious. They were cooked perfectly and they were huge burgers. I was very pleased with the taste of the bulgogi. My burger had the right amount of toppings and it wasn't overwhelming. I could still taste the beef. My boyfriend really liked his cali chick burger with the huge chicken breast and avocado inside.

2759584,2014-03-26,6,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"Solid burger joint!

Ever since I saw the picture of the Bulgogi Burger I couldn't wait to try it. It just so happens I was just down the street from there so it's got to be destiny right? Located off of East Flamingo with Eastern being the main cross street, look for this place where McGoo's is just right off the street.

As I walk in I couldn't help but notice just how spacious the interior was so not enough seating was not gonna be an issue. If you refer to my pic, you could probably throw in some more tables and chairs if you wanted to.

So I order the Bulgogi Burger (7.75) and accompanied it with Garlic Parmesan Fries (2.99). I already had bottled water with me so no need to get a drink. My total came out to 11 bucks and some change. Not really what I wanted to spend for lunch but my excuse was that it was a new place so prices the first time around usually don't scare me away unless the food and/or service is really bad.

Ok so the Bulgogi Burger looks as good as the picture. You get a 1/3 pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bulgogi beef to top it off on a decent bun. From the looks and taste of it, it looks like they season their beef while it is cooking. I asked them how the usually cook their patties and the guy said medium by default unless otherwise requested. The saltiness of the marinated beef was a good compliment to the beef patty. This burger does not come with ketchup or mustard but on every table there are ketchup and mustard bottles. If you want sriracha, tabasco, or A1 steak sauce, it is on their counter. Not sure if all their burgers don't come with sauces as a standard so I guess I will find out next time.

The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good. They make sure to coat each individual fry with grated parmesan cheese and garlic powder. I enjoyed it very much. My Yelp buddy Shawn H got the Chili Cheese Fries and man it looked good. Definitely refer to the pic he posted.

Service was pleasant from start to end. They greeted me as I walked in, took my order, and brought it out in a timely manner. They even asked me if I needed anything as they were cleaning up other tables beside me.

From their menu you can see that they have other items like wings, salad, and extras to add on to your burger. I think next time I will try their wings. I think its like 8 pieces for 9 bucks and you can add fries for an extra dollar.

So all in all my first experience was pleasant. They havnt had a grand opening yet so hopefully that is in the works. Maybe they can have some kind of lunch special so you don't go over 10 bucks for a burger, fries, and drink combo? That would be sweet. I would consider this a gourmet type of place. 4 stars for the first experience. We will see how it holds up the second time around down the road sometime.

My fiance said the wings were cooked good, although small and were out of the sauce he originally wanted. The best thing we had here was the steak and cheese pupusas, but nothing to rave about. I was happy to have a decent pupusa, but it is a far cry from a good burger and shake place.

They have a ""secret"" menu on Instagram. Half the stuff on IG is not on the menu. But basically you just show them a picture on IG and they'll make it for you, even tweak it for you if you wanted to add or subtract items. 

I got the Avocado burger with egg. It was literally bigger than me. Like I am a very neat eater, I don't like to get dirty. But beware, if you're like me, you will get as messy as hell! I did not know how to eat it at first because it was so gigantic. And for about 8$ it was definitely much worth it! My boyfriend got the Bulgogi burger with an extra patty and that was even more massive! 

Also they have the best shakes I ever had. It is literally heaven on earth. We got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shake and it was so good. I really really wanted to get the tiramisu shake but they ran out of tiramisu. That was the only disappointing thing about our meal. 

They also have Mexican food that I hear is pretty damn good. So next visit that is what I will be trying out. 

Now once you arrive it's in a pretty awkward place. It's usually deserted and not in the best side of town but really it is worth it. Do not judge a book by its cover.

The guy that helped us was awesome, very helpful and informative. He mans the IG account and post the best pictures of the food.

2991732,2015-02-21,0,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"First, how to find them: they are tucked into the back of the small strip mall with Magoo's Bar heading east on Flamingo before Eucalyptus Street. Second: the food is as good as it looks in the pictures. Why 3 stars? The service was really off that day.

I'm always crawling Yelp's pages for new places to eat lunch. We stopped by La Parilla for lunch after finding some great reviews. Our experience was a bit uneven. The Lab is a place that serves bar food, specialty hamburgers, with a mix of Mexican and Salvadorenan(?) items. I checked them out with the Health district and saw that they had a line of ""A"" grades, kudos to them. We decided to give them a try for lunch.

The Good: They have a really creative selection of burgers and a nice variety of food on the menu. The kitchen looked clean and the restaurant was neat. The food is great it looks just like the pictures on Yelp. It is a bit greasy, but I don't regularly eat fried foods. They give you a complimentary bowl of chips (homemade) and salsa while you wait for your order. 

The Bad: We couldn't eat in and get back to work in an hour. The nice man who helped us at the counter wasn't very experienced on the cash register and the line went slowly. Halfway through our order, someone came in from outside and completed punching it in so that our original server could help out in the kitchen. All the while, the new guy was chewing gum like a cow chews its cud. I'm not kidding, you could sometimes see the gum in his mouth, it was pink, disgusting. The kitchen was backed up and there was a mix-up with our tickets and we got our food long after people who ordered after us got theirs. The server was very apologetic, I felt bad for him, he needed some help. Also, they need a new take out menu. The one that they have is hard to read because the type is too small.

I think that people will really like their food, but I hope that what I observed will spur La Parilla The Lab to make some changes to tighten up their front/back of house organization. I encourage you to try them, but you might want to phone in your order to make sure it's ready and can be eaten during your lunch hour.",VHNFsnAvK9WGK1qkmm-9jQ,1,0,3,CHYW50ztZfx8CkXbGDcDFw

So I told my wife about it and we decided to try it out.   The burgers looked amazing from some of the reviews, so I was definitely curious! Guy at the counter seems very friendly.  I ordered the 1UP burger but with an extra hamburger patty, since the 1UP is a vegie burger.  But don't knock their quasi patty that's actually a giant mushroom. YES, it was delicious! oooey goooey goodness.  It was a bit messy to eat, but it was very good.  I'm not a big burger fan, but I am now a fan of the 1UP!  

My wife ordered the Cheezsteak.  She said it was a bit salty, so they might want to put something in there that balances the saltiness of the cheese.  We also ordered the garlic fries! That also didn't disappoint.  All in all, my only complaint is, when we went there, it was REALLY hot in the joint, I think only one AC vent was open and that was the one by the door.  We ended up not eating in and just getting our food to go.  

Guy at the counter did offer us some ice cream before we headed out, which was very nice of him. He also mentioned that they are going to be expanding the menu to include other great foods.  Oh, and they give you some fresh made chips and salsa while you wait, which is always a plus!! All in all, great new neighborhood burger joint.  Can't wait to try the chicken wings next time.

3087700,2017-11-13,1,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"I used to go to The Lab fairly regularly and raved about their burgers (I always got the Bulgogi Burger). I hadn't been in awhile but decided to order takeout after revisiting their Instagram page. I ordered the 1 Up burger with onion rings and my boyfriend got the crispy chick with garlic parmesan fries. Immediately after opening the takeout container I had to transfer the burger to a plate because the bottom bun was already soaked. I need to really remember to never have tomatoes on a burger because it gets so soggy. I'm also not a fan of mixing hot and cold vegetables. This burger had grilled onions, lettuce and tomatoes and taking a bite led to the whole thing slipping out the back and me eating mayonnaise bread. The grilled mushroom tasted dirty, with really no flavor. Maybe that's what I get for ordering a vegetarian burger. The onion rings weren't anything special. However, the crispy chick was hearty and was a lot better flavor wise. The garlic Parmesan fries were great, though the portion seemed smaller than I remember. 

The real winner here was the strawberry cheesecake milkshake we ordered. The last time we got this they actually stuck a slice of cheesecake inside the cup. This time it was more broken up, which was easier to consume. I would say this is one of the best milkshakes I've ever had but unfortunately it's not enough to give The Lab more than 3 stars right now.

They also have couple dessert options, a number of bottled drinks (sorry, no fountains here) and even ""exotic"" teas and fresh coffee.

It's a huge place that occupies two spaces in the building, only half of which has seating though. One of my biggest complaints was the temperature of the restaurant. We visited at the end of December and either the heater was broken, or they wanted the AC on and it was on the verge of freezing in the place. So cold that most of our food was quickly losing its temperature not long after getting it. 

I ended up ordering the El Niño, which is what I would say is more like a fusion burger. Topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and pickled cabbage, this burger is sandwiched between two pupusas that are made in house. It doesn't appear that you're able to request meat temperature, or I just wasn't asked, but mine came out decent and was about mid to mid-rare. This burger is really interesting texturally. The soft pupusas and tender burger patty worked really well with the thick cuts of crunchy carrot in the pickled cabbage, and the gooey melted mozzarella was an excellent topping. My burger came with pupusas that were filled will refried beans, and because it's also nearly drowning in tomato sauce, it might be more of a knife & fork dish for some. Unless you're feeling adventurous and don't mind getting messy of course. But it was pretty tasty and something I've never really seen anywhere else.

We also put in an order of wings that came highly recommended by the guy at the counter. Even though we ordered them well done, they were cold to the touch by the time I finished my burger and were hard to eat. The sauce seemed decent, I just don't think I got the full flavor and was really bummed the temperature inside the restaurant affected the food so quickly. 

As far as pricing goes, it's not bad, but the a la carte style menu could easily get pricy. Every burger on the menu is just shy of $8, besides their standard ""American"" burger which is $6.25. Our wings were priced at only $9 for an order of 10, but neither those or the burger came with any kind of side. Ranging from $2-$9, they offer onion rings and about a half a dozen fry options. And because all drinks are canned/bottled, there's no refills, meaning us thirsty folk may need to return for further refreshment.

Some of the other burger options look really interesting, and would certainly bring my back to try, but nothing we had really stood out as something to go out of your way for. If you happen to be in the area, I'd say it's worth checking out as long as you don't have to eat in ice box like temperatures.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,3,2,3,CXGeQrcVuGCw16J1rCjtOQ

And taste just as good as they look. So far I've tried the A1 burger, cheezesteak, and the crispy chick; All of burgers are finger licking GOOD!! I definitely consider them gourmet burgers. The fries are fresh, crispy, and also tasty. So far I've had the regular fries and chili cheese fries. Wow the chili cheese fries not such a big fan of chili cheese but their chili is absolutely unbearable. 


The Service is by far great, fast, and accurate. The menu it's self is simple and easy to understand which is a plus!! The cooks are unbelievable fast and still manage to assure the quality of the burger is just as delicious as the picture. Prices are fair you pay for what you get which is high quality burgers.

So we get there and had one of the staff tell is to have a seat and he will take our order soon. He brought out chips (like 4 chips for 4 people) and salsa and after that it took him about 30 mins to come back and get our order. After waiting for another 30 (1hr total) I thought ""this is ridiculous"" and asked the lady walking around bringing other food out when our food would be out and she said she would go check. Another 10 mins flew by and then she came back out only to bring people that had gotten there about 30 mins after us their food. The lady then came to us and asked us what we wanted to order and that's when we just walked out! The service was beyond horrible, the water was warm and tasted like crap, they have no regard for customers waiting.

I've tried the hotwings and the fries and didn't find anything special about them, but the burgers and the salsa...wow! Have I mentioned their burgers and salsa, well you should check them out. The Burgers are darn good with fresh beef, good bread and crisp veggies. This is not a simple bar burger, it's an artisan burger. The salsa has to be made in house because the flavor has been slightly different each time I went, but each time it was great. Don't be fooled by the exterior. This place is literally the wonderful book buried under the lackluster cover. It's not the best burger place in town, but it is the best burger at the price in town. 

I can't go five star crazy because, like I said, the fries are just fries and the wings are just wings. The interior is a little sparse and the service can be a little slow. However, the servers and employees have all been very friendly. Be leery of karaoke night, not because the music is bad, but rather because the place isn't set up for noise so any volume on the Karaoke machine turns the entire restaurant into an experiment on how long one can maintain sanity inside a rattling tin can. That's why no five stars, but the burgers and the salsa are worth any shortcomings.

I'm a big fan of burgers, I've spent $11-$50 for ""specialty"" burgers and this place won't disappoint as the average price is around $7.50 per burger. This is worth the try.

So it's a Mexican place run by Salvadorians that serves American burgers (some with Asian influences).

And then they have a menu with some delicious burgers. 

I tried the Philly Cheese-steak Burger and it was monstrous, filling, and delicious -- the kind of delicious where you go through 10 napkins and still have to wash your hands after.

We like unique and novel experiences, so we were looking forward to it. We were directed to find some seats and literally sank into bench seats that have definitely seen better days. I was okay with that- I often find broken in benches to be more comfortable.
   Several minutes later, she came out with some water. The combination of dark lighting and badly-selected color patterns have created very  hard to read menus so it took us a while to figure out what to eat. They offer some very interesting items like cinnamon or pineapple tea, a variety of pupusas, great sounding ingredients on burgers, and several types of fries (bacon cheese, carne asada, gravy, cheese, chili cheese, french, garlic parm). Several minutes after the water, she brought out homemade chips and salsa. Later she brought out more chips, but they were burned.
  While ordering, I made a point of stating I am allergic to onions, and she actually had me change my order to avoid them. But when she brought out the appetizer she had suggested, it had onions. BF asked about them, and she explained like there was nothing wrong that onions are a part of this dish- what???!!!
  The main items came out- I had ordered a chicken burger because she said their normal hamburgers have onions in the meat. But when she brought the chicken burger out, it was stacked with onions! We stated the problem. She acknowledged it and said she'd told the chef about my allergy (again- what about the appetizer?). She said she'd get it fixed and took the burger away. With lightning speed she was back with my ""fixed"" burger. Turns out, the chef had just removed the onions and sent the food back out to me. Problem 1- if I had a life threatening allergy, instead of just making me sick this would have put me in the hospital. Problem 2- according to health code, they can't bring food back from the dining room, alter it, and send it back out to me. They should have started fresh, but they were too cheap to fix their mistake the right way.
  While eating, we asked for water 3 times before bf gave up and brought our glasses to the counter. Then she brought us a pitcher so she wouldn't have to check on us. This would have been appropriate and appreciated IF they'd been busy, but we were the only ones there until we had finished eating and were waiting for our bill (1 woman came in and sat in a near booth). While we were still waiting for the bill, 1 of the staff came out, turned on the TV that was maybe 3 tables away from us, and started yelling at the players on the screen.
  Regarding the food, it was not good. I ate half of the burger and didn't bring any leftovers home. I ate a little more than half of the appetizer and literally gagged on my last bite. Bf stated that his buffalo chicken was marginal at absolute best. He didn't bring anything home either

The complimentary chips and salsa they serve are great. The salsa flavor is addicting! I would order this again even though it's free.

Today I had their crispy chicken sandwich with cole slaw, fried egg, and brown gravy. I also had gravy fries, parm fries, and a quesadilla. Yes, I shared with someone!

My sandwich was good. I expected it to be a little more special? It did the job but was nothing special. Maybe it was because the egg yolk wasn't runny. Maybe it was because the gravy was flat. 

The fries were both disappointing. Fries should be hot, crisp, and ADDICTING! They are a guilty pleasure that you can't help but uncontrollably munch on. I remember not taking a to go box and not finishing half of either fries. The gravy fries came luke-warm and sad. Garlic parm fries lacked any garlic or parm flavor.

I didn't have any of the quesadilla but it just seemed like a run of the mill quesadilla I could have made at home. 

The price was affordable and the food was okay.

What sucked most? Our server who only came by to drop stuff off. He was also watching a soccer match. He was also having a beer at a table next to us and never stopped by. Never got refills. We had to walk up for our check. He forgot what we ordered. We had to tell home what we ate at the register.

All that's left is the sad remnants of their burger menu as drably interpreted by a Guatemalan restaurant using subpar ingredients and fast food execution. 

Clue #1: We were literally the only ones there during dinnertime on a Saturday.

Clue #2: More than half the place was set up as an even sadder attempt at a Latin club (see photo). Again, exactly zero people present, other than the ""DJ"" and his late middle aged companion. So our disappointing burger meal was accompanied by blasting reggaeton.

The food: The ($18) surf and turf fries were covered in cheezewiz and overnight grocery store guac, with a stingy amount of ""asada"" and 4-5 shrimps. The wings tasted straight from the freezer with salad dressing ranch. The only passable part of the meal was my El Nino burger, which was meh and looked absolutely nothing like photos from the Lab's glory days.

RIP The Lab. Let's not contort your legacy by trying to house you in a wanna be Guatemalan dance club.",HeJi6YB9z1Q5C9y5puV5yw,2,0,1,Y1CMexEb1bynntTLNWU3Uw
4072639,2015-01-25,1,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"I think just about anybody can crave a good burger from time to time. And La Parilla's presentation got me through the door, and the price and taste will get me to return. 

Located in somewhat of an awkward location on East Flamingo in between a few commercial centers it seemed like an afterthought of a restaurant. Id never have come here if it wasnt for Yelp. Walk thru the doors and there isnt much to be seen or had either, with plastic tarp style sign menu and no frills dining area i almost was turned off. But the guys behind the counter seems informative and i have to try the Bulgogi Burger ive been eyeing pics of for over a week. Presentation is solid looking between a yummy mess to a larger version of Bachi depending on what you order. Ingredients seem fresh and the combinations are good but not gourmet good like a Bachi. The onion rings have a somewhat sweet taste to them making them a big different and worthy of trying. The fries were just fries, nothing to talk about. 

Philly Burger with wiz - Was a mess, decent, but all the wiz took away from tasting the actually burger itself. 6.5/10 

Bulgogi Burger - Fresh veg, Bulgogi marinade was good actually and complimented the burger 8.5/10 

Lets be honest at $7.50-7.95/ burger for the size, and ingredients your used to paying closer to $10. Im interested in coming back to give it another whirl on something different but not too often as i dont want to become a fat ass.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,2,2,4,8OoU9D5ChIes3PnTiUP_7w
4085529,2017-04-24,2,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"First impressions were hard to make. Coworkers (and Google) had told us the place was called ""The Burger Lab"". When we arrived, we saw it was called ""La Parilla -- The Lab."" There was confusion but we still settled in. I thought that The Burger Lab was a cool upstart that fizzled out and was replaced by another business that kind of did the same thing.

This put me at at disadvantage. I didn't get a burger. Why? I wasn't sure if it would actually be good. I thought it was a Salvadoran restaurant that served burgers because you need the appeal to your audience and Salvadoran food isn't a grab like burgers are. 

I was skeptical of the Bulgogi burger, Korean meat served as part of an American hamburger in this Salvadoran restaurant. Coworker swore by it, but I thought it was too risky. I went with some shredded meat with peppers meal. It was something I envisioned close to what ""Ropa Vieja"" is in Cuban cuisine (shredded beef in delicious sauce over tasted black beans and rice).

Well stick to burgers. Meet wasn't super warm and it's in a bit of it's own sauces. Beef had subdued flavor, expecting more of a variety of spices to the dish. It came with some rice which was bland. Mixing the rice with the meat sauce is not optional, it's mandatory. There was what I assumed to be Salvadoran potato salad, but if I was skeptical of burgers here, you know I wasn't eating something with what I assumed was made of mayonnaise in it. Hey, I tried it and it was not something I wanted to continue eating. 

As for the restaurant, it's a lot bigger than you would think. Plenty of TVs around the place. There is a Touch Tunes jukebox that was set to Jet Engine levels of loud when I operated it. Luckily the staff gave me the remote to turn it down. I figure this place is pretty crazy on the weekend.

The unfortunate thing that ended our visit was the fact that the restaurant's credit card machine system was down. This was a serious problem for a lot of us, well pretty much anyone, since carrying cash is a novelty at this point. Great thing was, I'm a novel guy so I was able to pay for my meal and walk out. The rest of my coworkers were not as fortunate. The restaurant was not prepared to handle something like this. Not sure it occurs often but bringing cash wouldn't hurt.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,3,1,2,TB0SEFe6zemCUoH4aePpRw

I had the avacodo bacon burger. This was one messy burger. Carl's Jr would be proud. The bacon was really good, the meat on the burger was just okay and everything else way just a little over board as it was almost hard to eat the way it was constucted. At one point I did take the burger apart just to taste the meat. Which was okay at best. 

The parm garlic fries where almost on eatable with the amount of garlic and parm it had on them. If I were to go back here I would aviod these at all cost. 

I won't have worry about this as nothing about this place was remarkable even though it is only walking distance from where I am staying I don't think I will be back.",AuC6R6-F2tZsISm7NIriOw,4,0,2,ZVMWR_AtO-V-ayzKx66StQ
4147531,2016-03-11,2,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"I came to La Parrilla The Lab a few nights ago with my dad after seeing the strong reviews on Yelp.  Actually, the final decision maker was the pictures.  The burgers looked amazing and I knew I had to try one.

The restaurant was completely empty when we walked in.  We weren't even sure the place was open when we pulled into the parking lot.  But it was open and we were welcomed in and greeted promptly.  We were given the opportunity to sit any where.  A benefit of eating at an empty restaurant.  After each of us ordered a Bud Light, we looked a the menu for a few minutes.  Both my dad and I wanted to try the Bulgogi Burger.  Again, I saw on Yelp and knew I had to try it.  We each ordered our own fries too.  My dad got the chili cheese fries.  I had garlic parmesan fries.  

It took a little while for a food to come out but I could smell it cooking.  I knew it was fresh.  The burgers looked awesome when they came out.  A soft artisan bun and a burger with toppings stacked high.  The fries were equally impressive. My dad's chili cheese fries were covered with the title ingredients and a generous portion of chopped onions.  I tried one bite and could tell it was a good quality chili.  My fries were great as well.  And very fragrant at that.  Between the garlic and parmesan, it was almost offensive.  I savored every bite.

We both thoroughly enjoyed our bugers.  They were cooked to a nice medium which is perfect for me.  My dad I think would have preferred his more rare but it was not a point he felt it was necessary to make.  We both were impressed with the bulgogi beef topping our burgers.  It was sweet and tender.  It added an almost teriyaki flavor to the burger.  Not a bad thing.

The food here is good.  For a nearly hidden hole-in-the-wall burger bar they are knocking out some good food.  Beware though.  The price can sneak up on you. $7.95 for a burger seems alright.  But add $3 or $4 fries and $4 beers to that and you have yourself a sneaky $30+ tab for only two people.  It adds up when you have to order items separate from each other because they don't have meals like a lot of other places.  Not that they are unique in that way.  I've been to other restaurants that do the same thing.  Just know it going in.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,5,3,4,77_zyDdb8_Gh8-BZYZZmXg

4529847,2015-11-09,0,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"Experience:  I was taking my Grandpa out to lunch, and I used YELP to find a place nearby that serves something he will eat. He won't eat anything besides American and Italian. A burger place is pretty safe. It was noon on a Monday. 

Facility:  It's located in a pretty deserted strip mall on the end. Once you walk inside, it's a pretty big size, but not too many tables, which is a god thing. There's about 8 booths and 4 large table and chair seating. It's a diner type atmosphere with minimal decor. 

Service:  We were greeted as soon as we came in by a nice waiter. We sat down and he served us immediately. He checked back several times over and over again. 

Food: They put chips and salsa down as soon as you sit. The chips are delicious, but the salsa tastes way too heavy on the raw onion side for me. Weird...there's no salt on the table. I usually salt my chips.  
We ordered a couple of regular burgers American style and a side of fries to share. 
I was a little surprised the waiter didn't ask how we wanted the burger cooked. However, it still came med-well, so that was good. 
The burgers were big, cooked well and with a nice flavor. There were plenty of toppings, including a lot of pickles, which makes me happy. 
The fries were hot, fresh and tasty. They didn't need any additional salt, so maybe that's why there's no shakers on the table. I only ate a few because I filled up on the chips. 

Overall:  This is a good burger spot, especially for the price. They have some other things on the menu and secret menu that I want to try like the shrimp cocktail, tacos, and ceviche, but today was just a burger day. I'll be back. :)",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,1,3,iTpyEPiRu9663SdvixoZIA
4548340,2017-03-01,3,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"This 3/5 review is specifically due to a solidly delicious burger (4/5)  I had here. But when it comes to service, this place deserves a 1/5!!

We had just picked our friends up from the airport and they were starving. I'd heard this place had good burgers and it wasn't to far from home, so we stopped by. It was around 3p on a very rainy Saturday. The place was empty except for maybe one or two other tables. We picked our table and menus were brought out right away. I had only seen pictures of burgers on Yelp, so I was surprised when a multi-page Mexican menu was handed to me and the burgers were listed on a small separate menu. 

During the first twenty minutes there, our waitress was very aggressive about asking if we were ready to order yet. But between good conversation with friends we hadn't seen in a while and several pages of a menu to dig through, we needed some time. We also had some questions since we'd never eaten there. And with every question we asked, she answered with as few words as possible and seemed very disappointed if we asked for further details. 

When we finally did get the order in, things just got worse. I think it was around twenty minutes that she delivered a burger and fries to me. But not only was I the only one she put food in front of, the order was also wrong (I ordered no bun and wanted LOADED fries). Of course I didn't want to eat since no one else had their food. So we continued to wait...5-10 minutes later she came back, mumbled something about a mistake and took the burger and fries away. We waited a solid 10-15 minutes more for all of our food to arrive! We watched other tables that ordered after us (this place had started to fill up) get their food!! I can't believe our food finally came out at all, let alone as ordered. 

Thank goodness I enjoyed my burger as much as I did after all that nonsense. But I think the people who hadn't gotten burgers and got fajitas instead weren't as impressed - it looked pretty mediocre. It probably didn't help that our waitress brought out their tortillas after our men had already inhaled their food. 

I ordered the Pastrami burger. It was also covered in perfectly melted cheese and some delicious chili. This was a sizable pile of goodness!

And while my loaded fries certainly didn't look like much, they were actually pretty good! The fries looked frozen, the cheese was in two forms - sauce and unmelted shredded. But with real chunks of bacon it somehow came together and was pretty yummy!

Throughout the rest of our time the bad service continued. No drink refills, no checking in on us and impossible to find when we were more than ready for the bill. We didn't even bother asking her to split the check because we didn't want to have to wait any longer.

So, I guess if you feel ok with crap service, go check out this burger!",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,11,3,zusD2kLt9GrKU1ECUo4gmQ

I also really loved that they had other diet options when it came to soda. Yay! 

We grabbed our cold cans of Coke Zeroes and found a booth. While waiting for our food they brought us out a basket filled with fresh chips and homemade salsa. It was really tasty! Totally reminded me of my mom's salsa. We were both sad when the chips were gone. But not for long cause the rest of our order came out. Wow! My Carne Asada Fries were huge!

5139460,2014-03-25,4,Kbnet8BjbZpXoR_q7JLZPA,"Solid 3-3.5 star spot!  I think the RIGHT burger could have pushed me to a 4 personally.

It's almost a ""hood burger"" being on E Flamingo, without the super cheap prices and/or the home cookin' hospitality.  Don't get me wrong, it's not expensive by any means, just not a Fat Boy for instance.

I went with the Pastrami Burger ($7.95): Chili, Swiss Cheese, Mustard & Pickle. SOLID burger, cooked to MR+ with initial juices on the squeeze.  The chili is pretty good too and was the highlight of the burger for me :)  

The burger also had lots of mustard...just wish the pastrami was a little more flavorful to compensate. It was cut thick, a bit chewy, and did not have the crispy / caramelized edges I love...reminded me of a less rendered pork belly / bacon consistency.  It definitely got hidden in the burger/chili combination, until you had to chew it up separately of course, since the rest of the burger melts in your mouth in comparison.

Also ordered the Chili Cheese Fries ($3.95). Didn't realize the Pastrami Burger already came with Chili, so I was quite overloaded with it LOL. These were topped off with LOTS of Cheez Whiz...good stuff!  A bit heavy in the end...I'd share with someone bigger than a 2yr old :P 

I also got to try Roger's Garlic Parmesan Fries...these were pretty tasty!  TONS of parmesan cheese clumped up in small bits, with a good amount of garlic flavor.  Recommended :)

With burger, chili cheese fries and a drink, I was at $15.  This felt fair in my book, but perhaps you guys should consider a combo meal (Roger's idea)?  One of the tame burgers, basic fries and a fountain drink for $9.95 for instance?

I am sure I will be back to try another burger since it isn't too far from the strip :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,15,9,3,RWu74ZSwQ3cUhBYduD7mdw

First off this place does not look like a gourmet burger joint. It looks like a Roberto's. And then we walk in the lady hands us a menu and tells us to sit anywhere, which we did. There was only one couple and then my husband, my daughter, and I. It took the lady like 15 minutes to even come take our order. The concept of the whole burger lab was never explained to us. We didn't know what we can add on or how much the add ons were.

So we ordered two bulgogi burgers (mine was the regular and my husband got one with one extra patty and extra bacon). Then we order bacon and cheese fries. And ordered some drinks. Now we're thinking this place is just starting up but it's like a sit down dinner. Nope!! The only good thing about this place was the burgers! We ordered $4 fries which was a small bowl of skinny fries with cut up bacon and what I'm guessing is melted kraft slices. And the drinks we got were $2 each (we got Peach juice, dr. Pepper, and a small water which turned out to be a big water bottle) these were not Fountain drinks. They gave us bottled drinks, FOR TWO DOLLARS!! Oh and the first time the lady took our order, she lost our ticket so the chef had to come out and retake our order.  WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THERE. And then on top of that they started playing Spanish music,  just blasting it!

And at the end of the night we paid $40 for everything. The lady didn't even show us our bill, so we didn't know until we paid that they charged my husband for 3 extra patties instead of 1! This place is TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT GO!!!!",7qPuRQK2rNGAiI6OWxEWeA,3,1,2,5_u9FC2GQsItQ8FeMj8lWA

We ordered the gravy fries which were, sadly, disappointing.  Flooded in gravy that was more like gray water than a flavorful delight.  The fries were fresh but soggy and, pet peeve of mine, served without utensils. Seriously, how do you eat soggy fries in gravy without a fork.

 $37.66 got us a buffalo chicken sandwich, cheese fries, parmesean fries, a cali chick burger, a jarritos, a Corona, and a cheese pupusa.  Service was very friendly, if not a bit slow.    We were brought very thick tortilla chips and ""salsa"" which was more like tomato soup with a bit of cilantro in it.  

Cali Chick Burger $7.95
Tarragon aioli, lettuce, tomato and grilled marinated chicken breast with Swiss cheese and avocado. Husband said it was very tasty and he enjoyed it.  

Buffalo Chicken Burger $7.95
Lettuce, tomato, onions and crispy chicken breast tossed in Frank's hot Buffalo sauce with a side of ranch.  Chicken was hot, fresh, and tasty although there was no ranch in sight.  

Cheese Pupusa $1.95
Very tasty de maiz with lots of gooey cheese inside.  It was served with the traditional red sauce and cabbage.  Pretty good value for the money, although I wish chicken was an option to go inside it.  

The fries were $2.95 each and IMHO tasted just like very undercooked McDonalds fries.  They had no golden-brown tinge at all.  The parmesean ones were the best but still they needed a couple more minutes in the fryer.  It might be better to ask for your fries well done if you like them crispy.

Only one employee, I guess someone was late showing up, so he was doing all the cooking, cleaning, and order taking. Good job as he managed our table and the two others with charm and efficiency. 

The burgers are huge, and there is a nice selection of choices available. I had the BLT burger and my friend the A1 burger. Both were pretty good, and for a fair price (I think around $8). Drinks come from a giant cooler filled with bottles, and you can get beer if you desire.

If I owned it, I'd have to give it a renovation first off and then inform better regulations as to uniform and hair being tied up. I noticed a blonde lady that had her long hair down and going in and out the kitchen. To me that's just risky business. But besides that, we ordered basically a little bit of everything! And it was all good. The only other complaint i'd have is about the shrimp nachos/ff/tots. We ended up paying $16 just for one order and it did not taste like it was worth that much. Plus, they got he order wrong too. So it can get pricey so just be careful about what you order. And also, there was a long wait time even with no one else there but us...",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,0,0,3,OSst1sorgWEVsoWUdkHTSw

Went in at lunchtime, place was empty.

Asked the waiter for his burger recommendation. After much hesitation, he recommended me the American burger. Pretty boring for a place called ""The Lab.""

The wait for my food was torturous, as I was on my lunch break. All for a burger which, frankly, was completely forgettable.

However, I'm bumping it up a star because I ordered a pupusa out of curiosity. It was cheap, delicious, and frankly, the best I've had. Like a crisp deep fried dough pocket filled with meat.

Conclusion: skip the burger. Get the pupusa.",uSDie7Nl_CZ9mFOvjXo-hg,0,0,4,YVNpRHRzHAMQoj_x_E5Q8A

I had one of their burgers, the pastrami one, and it was decadent. They put the chili on the side as wasn't sure if wanted it. Didn't want it as it had ground up beans, and could taste the beans.  The burger, although a little dry for me, had great flavor and very pleased with it!

The cheesy Garlic fries were OK, had good flavor, but was essentially fries with this garlicky cheesy mixture lightly mixed in. Granted, it was good but would've chosen something else.

Another minor thing that helped subtract half a star is they don't have fountain soft drinks, just a minor thing.

Additionally, they prefer cash as charge an additional fifty cents if use a credit card. At first was a little put off, then thought of it as a cash discount.

Want to check this place out again and will recommend it! Thank you!",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,0,0,4,cPLei8_4tIwFnkllp9xkng

When you first walk in you're greeted right away. Their service is great. They do a swell job in explaining the different burgers and which ones they recommend. Through a few minutes of debating on which burger, we decided to get the guac and the pastrami burger. 

The pastrami burger was really hearty and filling. The burger itself looked just as it did in the pictures. The chili was so good! I really wished I tried the chili fries. Overall a very good burger.

My favorite was the guac burger. The guacamole in the burger was perfecto! I'd probably get this every time if I didn't want to try the other burgers. 

They have a big variety of drinks for everyone from juice to Starbucks ice coffee and canned soda. 

I'll definitely be coming back again. Seriously close enough for a short lunch break if you go to unlv. So gooooood!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,7,3,5,5YEPtye5AVd0mWc0abs6ZA

Come on....my mind was blown. Not only did it sound AH-mazing, but it was ALL THAT!!! I also had an oreo milkshake with two slices of cheesecake topped in it. Wowzer! Service was a bit slow, but I could tell she was new to the serving game so I cut her A LOT of slack, since she was nice and apologetic. Most high end places you don't get that, you're lucky if you get a sincere apology. I had the garlic Parmesan fries and they were ok, nothing special like the rest of my meal. But I will definitely go back for more EL NINO and their shakes. Prices were not bad at all to top it off. Be advised they charge .50 cents if you use your cc and if you're gonna eat in, just choose a chair.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,1,2,4,Ddp1aQR7i2C1v1h_CQ3fbg

Good ingredients, fresh buns, tasty cheese fries (with bacon!), fast and friendly service- they've got the whole package. 

I recommend the A1 burger, with onion rings and bacon (bacon!). My fam ordered the Guac burger (not on the menu) and they  wouldn't share but said they loved it (also with bacon!). 

Convenient location on Eastern and Flamingo with plenty of parking. I'll be back again and again.",FCHAAnjtmJrTGzURy1sQAQ,1,1,4,s7BSj6VowggxqmyHjiFAww
