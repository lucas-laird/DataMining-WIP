She let me literally stand there for over 10 minutes while she kept on preparing sandwich's from an online order while I was the only person in the store there she just kept ignoring me. Then she proceeded to tell me I couldn't have a toasted sandwich because she needed to clean it. She started complaining to me about her alleged horrible work conditions and all the work she had to do. I suggested she ask for some more help. She told me the owners of the store won't give her any and started whining about not having had any break or dinner and how she had just transferred from another store for the very same issues. I told her I'm going to call the store owner & report this as it's not rocket science rather sandwich making. I ended up having to leave because the girl was so rude, I left without even getting any sandwich at all. Another customer left also whilst I was waiting because none of us were greeted nor acknowledgment and the girl working clearly did not know nor care how to multi-task duties with any common sense nor handle customers properly. This store needs to get a clue as it's losing customer's business due to lack of staffing and disrespectful customer service.",0iAmEvCrnf37JXp7buAtcQ,2,0,1,ajkcEXD96zxZkV4ANhO3Cw

This subway was a bit busy but nonetheless they were quick and efficient.  The service was great, the food was even better.

The place was clean and spacious with a lot of room to sit down.

Our sandwiches were delicious.  I'd come here again!  I did notice that their vegetables were FRESH and so was the bread.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,0,0,4,rNC2zVRV7efWsp1eZ74l1g

The soda from the soda machine always tastes watery! Overall a good place to grab something to eat.",OYPT6sbCd1eWkmrVYdtqAA,1,0,4,nacMWg_uLXZDFjxjt2NQmw
