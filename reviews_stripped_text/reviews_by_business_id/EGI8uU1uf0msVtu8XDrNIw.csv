The food is incredibly Delicious and authentic.  The atmosphere created by the owners is awesome.  This place makes you feel like you are over at your Abuelitas house for dinner.

Everything I tried so far has been exceptional, but my favorites are the Ropa Vieja, ensalda de avocado and of course the platanos maduros.

Ratings:

Food - 5 stars
Prices- 5 stars
Location- 3 stars. Just a few blocks north of the Stratosphere casino on Las Vegas boulevard.  Be careful if you go at night.

I was hoping for something simple and inexpensive. That's exactly what I found. Nothing fancy but a very nice casual atmosphere. There was a baseball game (in Spanish) on the television set and the staff was watching it as they worked. I had a Cuban sandwich with fries and a cafe solo. Ten dollars all up and the food came quickly (delivered by the unfortunately bored-looking and rather ill-mannered young waitress). But don't let that put you off. The food was hot and delicious and I'll definitely go back. I don't worry about fancy. I'd rather be comfortable, and I certainly was here.

As others have noted, it's in a sketchy area; the parking lot is sketchy, and the building and restaurant itself are a bit run down.  This is not a fancy place by any means.  

That being said, the food and service are amazing!  It almost feels like you're at a relatives house for lunch, with the TV blaring in Spanish.  I had the ropa vieja, which was delicious and dare I say, better than at the Florida Cafe.

We went on good ol Yelp in search for Cuban food because someone suggested it & this place came up. Based on the good reviews, we unanimously (surprisingly enough) decided to go here.

The place was super easy to find and it's on the right of LVB if you're heading north to downtown. Man it's hot in Vegas at this time! Anyway, we parked in the back and went to the front to enter. There was no one there except for the owners who were watching an Angels game (Dodgers must not have been playing =). The man moved a table in place to make room for us and at this time, we were thinking that this place might be a dump!

Boy were we wrong!!! I'm a huge fan of mom & pop places but since no one was there I thought oh no. But as soon as we got there, they totally make you feel welcomed and the waitress was smiling all the time. We asked what she recommends and she said the arroz con pollo is good. One of us got it and the rest of us got different things. I ordered the pollo criollo which was chicken pieces sauteed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes.

I liked my chicken dish, and my husband had the steak.  Very basic but tasty.  Not sure how authentic, but the owners are Cuban, so I'm sure it was pretty authentic.  The steak was very nicely marinated, tasty like the Mexican carne asada but a different flavor.  The chicken special (they have specials for each day of the week) had crispy, tasty strips of chicken, grilled peppers, and rice.  The avocado salad was good, but so simple that you could probably make it at home.  I wish I had tried the fried plantains - will do next time.

The place is a true hole in the wall, complete with the TV blaring telenova dramas, a big picture of Havana, Cuba on the wall, and even the chef coming out to swat flies...on my table haha.

Not knowing anything, I ordered the Arroz con Pollo.  When it came out it was two pieces of chicken over a bed of red rice and a little slice of tomato.  The food was ok.  The chicken came out dry, but with a little hot sauce the flavor was there.  The rice was unique, with a little spice to differentiate it from other places.

Always in search of the most authentic cuban food we can find, we found this gem while searching for the Floridita restaurant (which by the way...so boring for your fabulous tastebuds).   

From the moment you walk in to this not so luxurious storefront, the aroma of black beans and other fantastic  foods hits you like a brick wall and you think - can this place really smell this good? I hope the food tastes as good as it smells.  AND IT DOES.  I have been  loyal fan to this restaurant for  years and everytime I am in Vegas (3-4 times a year) I have lunch or dinner with Mama.  That is the lady always watching futbol on the tv or watching the novelas.  When she is cookiing your food, you know that it is good. 

The prices are beyond reasonable and the service is great.  They are always ready to please and soooo nice.  I have yet to find a cuban restaurant in L.A. that lives up to the standard of Rincon Criollo.  Try their puerco frito and just bask in the flavor.

1799557,2008-06-24,0,EGI8uU1uf0msVtu8XDrNIw,"Set along the decaying ruins of Las Vegas Boulevard South, Rincon Criollo is a true departure from the glitter and gulch of Vegas. There seems to be something of theme developed along LVBS, with a Salvadorian and another Cuban restaurant in proximity to each other. This one is set in a bland storefront, but once inside the atmosphere feels more Havanian than anything else. The food is simple and spicy and delectable: hot crusty bread and butter, as mentioned in another review, spicy chorizo, steaming rice and beans, chicken that cleaves to the bone, yuca and plantains and pressed cuban sandwiches. The staff seems to be all Cuban, and prepare everything in big pots in the back kitchen. They treat you with genuine hospitality, and aren't particularly concerned with turning the table and running up the tab. Sit there as long as you like and peer through the dusty storefront windows at the sunburnt downtown avenues. It is probably impossible to stay or visit downtown, see the humble immigrant businesses and the few tawdry titty bars set along a background of near shantytowns, and not question how so much glamour and wealth could neighbor such impoverishment. 

In any case, turning back to the Rincon interior you'll find one whole wall engulfed by an aging aerial photo of Havana. The picture displays the Malecon sea wall as it weaves along the waterfront. The water is that tepid blue that suggests a photograph from the sixties or seventies. We ate under its shadow and thoroughly enjoyed what might be characterized as a repast, under the watchful eye of our waitress, who bore a helpful smile our entire meal. After we'd finished, we walked back out into the hot Vegas sun and stood along the unforgiving pavement for a few minutes, soaking in the strangely charmless vista of Old Vegas.

Aaaand left a tad disappointed. The only thing fresh we received was the bread (oh, soo good), the maduros, the guanabana shakes and the avocado salad. Our main course came so fast out of the kitchen after we sat down and ordered, we were amazed... Until I stuck my fork into my chicken fricasé (spoiler alert: when I get it at my local spot, the meat is falls-off-the-bone delish!), not only did it not budge off the bone, it tasted like it had been re-heated, and parts of it had the texture of jerky. Not a sign of freshness. Lord knows I've cooked and reheated enough leftover meals in my day to know what happens to chicken when reheated in the microwave. My mom's meal, though it was very tasty, the one bite I had was less than lukewarm.

Also would recommend the Platanos Maduros (side dish). 
Tried the Ropa Vieja (Shredded Beef) and the Pan Con Chorizo (Chorizo and Cheese panini-type) which were both really good as well. I dont think you can really go wrong with anything you try.

1. Make sure you have some cash for tip. Even if you pay with a credit card, they request a cash tip.

I went here with 7 of my friends before heading back to LA.  It was Sunday afternoon and it was dead quiet.  The service was great.... we were the only ones eating here so I expected nothing less.  I had the arroz con pollo which was good.  It didn't blow my mind but it was tasty and hit the spot.

I also had the Cuban empanada which was micorwaved warmed and bland.  It was still cold in the center so I had them re warm it for me ...... Terrible...... It probably tasted great when they made it whenever they did.

Being the sharer I am, I tried all my friends dishes and nothing was exceptional.  The cuban sandwhich was probably the best thing they had there.  It was perfect.  Perfectly crisp, the right amount of cheese and meat..... yummmm.

What I didn't like was this one fish dish in red sause?  The fish was salted which wasn't mentioned in the description.  It was very very very very very salted.  Don't get that when you see it on the menue.

Whatever, it's still totally worth it.  

Same awesome waitress with awesome grill.  

Prices may have gone up but food hasn't changed at all.

When we got our meals, one of them was a deep fried pork chop which was crispy but in the middle was red and uncooked. We when spoke to our server and told her about it. She did Ok and went back to the kitchen and had the cook refried the pork chop. NOT GOOD!

We had a party of 7, most new to this place, but with some experience with cuban food.  We had the ropa vieja, chuletas, palomilla steak, along with the staple of black beans, rice and sweet plantains.

If you want huge portions, get the pork chops.  The ropa vieja had a smaller portion, a bit disappointing because it tastes so good, but if you are not starving, then great meal to choose.  

The black beans are the best I've tasted outside of my own kitchen.  Most places just open their can of beans and heat it up.  Not this place, they add a good amount of seasoning to them.  The plantains are great as usual.  Sweet, soft, tasty. 

I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 only because they ran out of Flan, so no dessert for us that night.  

Also - side note for those that wish to visit this place in the evening for dinner.  The restaurant is not in a great neighborhood.  So if you plan to take a taxi there, be sure to have reliable transportation back.  Dont get caught up having to find a taxi cab back to the strip.  It gets pretty sketchy out there.  I'd recommend going before it gets dark cuz the freaks do come out at night.

4289268,2009-07-08,2,EGI8uU1uf0msVtu8XDrNIw,"I definitely would say try this place, but as for 5 stars, guess I'm a bit of a conservative Cubana. I am Cuban, and learned how to cook at the ripe age of 9, I will be 44 this July and it still is a passion. The passion of Cuban cooking comes from so many different aspects, first, the culture, the value of family, tradition, smells, flavors, colors, presentation and appreciation. 

One thing I have learned from cooking is if your heart is not in it, the flavor and the love in your food will be nonexistent! So....when I try Cuban food that is not mine or my families, I am a bit of a snob. But, this charming little hole in the wall, I felt the passion upon entering the place. The lady ""Tati"" who answered the phone and aided me with driving directions, was very welcoming, hospitable and anxious for us to sit and grub. 

I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacates (avocados, onions, vinegar and salt), tostones (crispy fried plantains), and the Boliche (Cuban-style pot roast stuffed with Spanish Chorizo), of course I have to order a Malta (malt beverage-ice cold). 

The appetizers were right on, perfect, the Boliche however, lacked the Spanish chorizo, the meat was tender tasty and presented well as were the accompanying black beans and white rice. But, honestly, my beans are better as is my black beans. I have often urged my sister to help me start a catering business or better yet, help me open a Cuban cafe, but in San Francisco, CA., I am not sure it would take off, people in California are much more partial to Mexican food. 

We did return the next day for lunch, my friend ordered the same thing she had the night before ""Camarones Enchilados"", which is sauteed prawns in tomato sauce, garlic, cumin, wine, onions and peppers served over white rice and black beans. She LOVED it so much and I was thinking the entire time, she would flip if she had mine! I ordered the steak sandwich and I was shocked when the sandwich arrived with lettuce and tomatoes??????????!!!!! Cuban sandwiches are forbidden to have lettuce and tomatoes...LOL! Anyways I removed it and had my sandwich, the meat was a little fatty, which is a No NO for Cuban sandwiches.....again we ordered tostones and avocado salad, this time the tostones must have been made by someone else they just weren't the same. 

But, it felt good to be around my own environment, my culture, my food and the staff here is excellent! They want to please and they want you to eat it all, which is very Cuban by the way, I give them a 4 stars, and I would go back, especially if I ever come to Vegas again, since I cannot cook while I am away from home, this is a life saver for someone craving some good Qooban food.",dy_BZmVfkB9Tw1VHx4IQVw,9,3,4,WHZv2Hcj9xy8Wxk3E5othQ

We ordered yuca in garlic sauce, bacalao in red sauce, ropa vieja with fried plantains. We left without finishing our food. The bacalao was SO salty, I couldn't eat it (I actually prefer my food on a saltier side). The yuca was just boiled, drained in oil and sprinkled with garlic powder. The ropa vieja was just ok.
What really stricked me is that you can see part of the kitchen from the kitchen area and the first thing you see is a microwave... Odds are many restaurants have microwaves in their kitchen but should customers see them from their table? Absolutely not.
Now, I went to the bathroom and was seriously grossed out. It looks like it's a bathroom in a 3rd world country. After I washed my hands and left the bathroom I felt like my hands are dirtier.

No fountain drinks (Most Americans are fat enough as it is).
Average prices

Cons:
Location. Very sketchy once the sun goes down. If you have a cc permit, it's a good place to use it.

This seemed interesting and walking in it was very much a hole in the wall family place. I came in with a few patrons already there (seemed all to know the staff) and part of the staff was sitting and watching a telenovela. It's just a very simple of a place and random, like there is a turtle in a tank on the counter.

I ordered a Inka Cola which kinda taste like a more cotton candy tasting cream soda. I rarely drink soda, but felt like a bit of nostalgia from the days my mom would buy Latin sodas for my abuelo. 

To eat I got their puerco pierna asado, cuban roast pork leg, which came with rice and black beans and two nicely toasted and hot french bread slices with butter. The pork was delicious- juicy, nicely spiced with some oregano, garlic, I think it might be cloves and some lime. Thin slices of onion on top just help it to be even better. It is very simple and may not be the most ""big"" flavors in terms of the other things on the menu, but it's something that is comforting and a way I like to judge cuban places. Subtle and simple things are sometimes the hardest to make because it's hard to dress it up, but a fine line of where it needs to be. I kept on happily eating since it was hitting that comfort spot that good homey foods make you feel.  

I like that the staff was just sitting and watching and you hear their big, boisterous laughter at whats on TV. It might irritate wound up people but to me it's like you're in their home so they are just going to be themselves and I like that unpretentious feel. It didn't make me feel weird to join them and laugh at the shenanigans on the show too. 

The way staff talk to each other and to customers and how they care on their customers, it's like you're at your Tias house being showered with their cooking and doting on you. I like that home feel and the pork was right on. I'm coming back and this time I want to bring some friends. There's so much I want to try and the portions are generous, the price is right, so I'm hoping to coax them to share a few things.

Good variety of choices from yucca, to simple arros con pollo, chicken and rice, or if your a meat and potatoes kind of person there is something for you too or if you want to go a lil experimental you can go that route as well.

She said the Cuban bread was just French bread and not the real thing.  The beans and rice were delicious as were the maduros but they were a little too greasy for my liking.  I soaked off the grease with my napkin.  The atmosphere was lacking, it did feel like I was in someone's house and intruding at times.  The TV was so loud it was ridiculous.  Is this a restaurant or what?  The server was horrible.  She was eating while we were eating and never came up to ask us if we needed anything.  I felt myself staring her down to try and get her attention to order a beverage and more napkins.  It felt a little dirty in there too, I understand it's older and outdated but it can still use a good cleaning.  
The food was mediocre, I'd probably go again because there aren't many Cuban restaruants but I'll probably order to-go and I'll know what to expect, for the price, it's good.

All men and women must try this little piece of HONEST and downright DELICIOUS rustic cuban cuisine.

As I ordered my food, I realize that I am still in shock..Am I in Miami?... Nah,not even..Almost felt like I was in a Cuban city rather, before food rations and lack of resources were constant in the country, of course. Which is a shame, by the way, because Cuban cuisine is one of the most flavorful and tastiest kind of food that you will ever eat!!

They brewed my cafe con' leche (coffee with milk) just as I liked it, as my own mother used to make it, with extra sugar too as ordered! Thick, sweet and very satisfying. As you are reading this review, you are now obligated to try the Cafe con Leche, extra sweet, just for me. You will not regret it either!! 

The Pollo Fricasse was very generous and tasty; tender and moist chicken breast with chunks of seasoned potatoes and spanish olives in a red, zesty stew. Goes great with some creamy black beans and white rice. I ordered some fresh avocado with marinated onions ('mojo' or 'mojo de cebolla';not listed on the menu, you just gotta ask for it, it's a cuban thang) on the side to compliment the already-rich taste of everything that I was delightfully shoving into my mouth!! I also ordered a pineapple soda (Jupiña) with my meal, a common fizzy drink in Miami that is by far the best pineapple soda I ever tried..EVER. 

Next time you make a trip to the big ol' Las Vegas, avoid those overtly expensive and gawdy restaraunts for once and give this rustic gem a try. 'Florida Cafe' and all the other more hyped and obnoxious so called 'cuban' or carribean joints in LV and The Strip have nothing on what is truly honest, humble and simply good grub ESTILO CUBANO!!",tUe5B94NOnC3UPm5GxZmDw,1,0,5,4O4ARff1b-oNGwe6oH69MQ
