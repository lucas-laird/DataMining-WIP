1641783,2018-02-15,0,nKph91qATrPCbJ-QwZjDZw,"Confirming all the other five-star reviews ... Vegas Voyager-approved!!

My car was done in just over 10 minutes. Twenty bucks for an in&out (ie, inside & outside). The only other menu offerings are exterior-only for $12 and a hand wax for $40. Add $5 for SUVs & trucks. Add $10 for Armor-All in&out.

Just seconds after I pulled my car into their bay, four energetic employees swarmed upon my vehicle. And all four stayed at it until it was finished. I noticed one or the other of them back-tracking to double check their own work, door jambs, windows, whatever. 

And, yes, the car looked superb. 

The $20 deal included tire dressing, cleaning the wheels, vacuuming the trunk, etc., items that at other car washes are costly add-ons.

Ok, now the venue itself isn't much to speak of. These guys have commandeered one of those no-touch, robotic cinder-block car wash bays at a Sinclair gas station ... and are using it to do hand washes. Then they do the interior and other details after they drive the car out of the bay. There's nowhere to sit, no music playing, no conveniences of any sort. So I just walked over to the gas station's convenience store about thirty feet away ... and by the time I picked out a drink & snack, my car was all but done.

To quote a former California governor ... I'll be back!

UPDATE: I've now been back for the hand-wax special. That includes the outside only (add $10 for the inside). 

Awesome. Pull-in to drive-a-way was about 25 minutes. 

They are using a liquid squirt-paste wax that hazes (and so requires serious hand-buffing), NOT that 'quickie' liquid spray wax that goes on clear (and wipes off easy). 

At the end of the job, they spotted some overspray from recent paint work ... and worked to try to rub it out with some compound, without me asking. 

While I waited, I saw a very-new gray Corvette drive through for an exterior-only wash. So apparently people with high-end vehicles are quickly coming to trust this venue as well.

Accordingly, this venue is even more highly recommended upon this, my second, visit.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,0,5,kpe4ZkYOVrFjylPUer-S7w

They berated me and defended the business, adding in what a great guy the owner is. Told me I am clueless and basically to F off. Obviously this was the work of the owner himself or a friend of his. Wow...so unprofessional!! 

 I'm not sure what all the hype is about. 
I got my car washed here today and I definitely was NOT impressed by this place over any other car wash. 
First of all, the price advertised on the wall for my wash was $20 but they told me it would be $25 because my car was pretty dirty. I have a hatchback so it's like the size of a golf cart, but I agreed to pay the 25 because they insisted it would be a really great, thorough wash. 
When it was done I came out and had to point out at least 10 spots on the outside to the guy that didn't seem very happy that I was pointing out spots to him. Also some spots they missed vacuuming the inside. And, they forgot to put the air freshener in. I still tipped him even though I feel I was overcharged for the wash in the first place. 
Service wasn't that great- I'm not sure if these guys were hung over or just didn't really care about my business but I got no warm and fuzzy or level of professionalism...

Also this wise doesn't even have a working LCD screen you just have to assume you entered the code and that you entered the code correctly as you can't see what's going on. If you need a car wash in the middle of the night you might as well go here but if you need a car wash in the middle of the day make sure to avoid this place.

Truck looked great when they were done.  I did ask them a couple times to wipe off some the tire dressing and they sort of did it, but not really.

When done at Home Depot I went back and they came right over and asked me if something was wrong. 

They cleaned it off and wiped the tires down. A gentleman came over to me thank me for coming back so they could make it right and he told me ""we are not perfect, but we are trying "". Hey, that's all I could expect. I'll be back and would recommend.

My F150 was filthy after traveling across the country through, snow, dust, sand etc. Plus our dogs were in the back so there was dog hair everywhere. I honestly wasn't sure if this place would be up to the task. 

However I was pleasantly surprised with one of the best car washes I've had. They really took their time and went over every detail several times. I saw at least 3-4 people clean the mirrors for example. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you need a GOOD car wash.",zcUlXyniwZMHmP3Ns6P4Ew,3,2,5,4llLhPm_kQszUgeD8ixLEA

The employees inside the convenient store were very nice and greeted me immediately as I stepped into the store. There is also a smog testing booth next  to them as well. 

SERVICE: I got lucky this afternoon around lunch time and was able to pull right in and get my car detailed and on a Friday too! Francisco and his crew of 3 was able to hand wash and wax my car in about 25 minutes! The team was very professional and did a fantastic job bringing the shine out on my black car. My car didn't really need much attention on the interior since I keep my car very clean any ways but the exterior needed a nice coat of wax. Make sure you do a good walk around of your vehicle before you leave in case they've missed a spot or two. I found a few spots they missed and they fixed it immediately. Don't go home and complain and write a bad review when you could have had them correct it right there on the spot. 

PRICING: Very reasonable. Washes start at $11.99 and up. My service cost me $35 and I gave them $50 which included tip. It was about 115 degrees out today and they deserved it.",Yny4tKfTnLHjMJ75dXPQ-Q,0,0,5,hmOJsvbpovPa4uTPk2trcQ

The best part is the price. Seriously, you can't beat $20 for an exterior and interior clean. They vacuumed my seats, hooked me up with an air freshener and cleaned all of my mats for an extra $20.
