1229144,2016-09-18,1,ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA,"I went to Jannat restaurant for dinner with my wife. I visited Vegas couple of times before and have tried lot of Indian restaurants but never found any good one. I searched on yelp and found about Jannat and after reading yelp reviews thought of trying it. 

The restaurant is a little off the strip but not too far away. 

At the restaurant, the server came and took our order. Then he brought us some roasted papad with mint and tamarind chutney. Although I am not a big fan of eating papad I still loved it since the chutney was amazing. The tamarind and mint chutney was thick and with perfect amount of liquid-ness. All the other Indian places I have tried, not only in Vegas but even in other cities, I have seen that the chutneys are merely full of water and too liquidy which takes away the whole taste. 

Anyways we ordered Aloo Tikki Chat (from appetizer), Dal Tadka & Malai Kofta (from entree), Aloo paratha, Onion kulcha, Butter naan. 

While we were waiting for the order, the owner of the restaurant Mr. Sunny came and greeted us and asked if we needed anything else and talked about this newly opened restaurant. He then went and asked the cook to make the entrees spice level as per our need. 

The aloo tikki chat was amazing, it was perfect mix of white chana (chole) and onions with the aloo tikki which is mix of aloo and other spices. The taste was literally as if we were eating at Delhi's road side street food. The dal tadka was very tasty and reminded me of the dhaba style tadka dal. I have seen at other Indian restaurants where the chef's put dry red chilli in tadka, that is not what I have seen in my native place or how we cook it. And this dal tadka was exactly how I expected which simple tadka of ghee with cumin seeds, onions and green chillis slightly saute and mixed with dal. Amazingly tasty.  

Malai kofta was very tasty as well. It was a perfect blend of sweetish gravy with the mix of spices on kofta. The kofta's are very soft and very tasty. My wife who doesn't like malai kofta much since the gravy is usually sweet and lot of Indian restaurants have it very sweet and it mostly feels like you are eating a sweet dish more than an entree. But this malai kofta at Jannat's restaurant was perfect mix of sweet and spiciness, that my wife loved it.   

Each entree comes with complementary basmati rice. The rice is not some ordinary rice that most of the Indian restaurants serve on the name of basmati rice, it is very tasty and a long grained rice.  

The aloo paratha and onion kulcha is a must try. The paratha is stuffed with lightly spiced potatoes which makes it very tasty that you wouldn't even want any pickle or raita with it. Even onion kulcha was amazing and stuffed with onions. Both were very soft enough to eat without the stuffing falling from them while eating. The butter naan was as usual soft and nice.  

People have mentioned that the restaurant is far from strip, but its actually not that far. Its hardly couple of miles which is very easier to drive if you have car or even get there by cab. The restaurant was cleaned and the owner and server are great. They make sure your personal food style like spice level and other things are taken care of. 

I loved this place and would definitely go there next time I am in Vegas. :)",glzdVyRVYM0oDIOReCGAJw,3,3,5,UjAo70u3wosCsNVSOa-vNQ

We came because the yelp reviews were so high, but they really lived up to the hype. We had tandori chicken, tika masala, butter chicken and garlic and cheese naan.

1420430,2016-10-03,11,ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA,"Heads up, the second you enter, you will be enthusiastically greeted by Sunny, the owner. He's friendly and helpful and unnervingly good at the upsell- I spent significantly more than I'd planned without even thinking about it! But damn, he was right about that garlic naan...

For lunch, you have dine-in buffet or plate specials as your options- vegetarian plate is $10, non-veg is a buck more, both come with your choice of three courses (soup, app, entree), plus rice. I got one of each plate and basically made my own buffet at home, and there was more than enough food for three meals. Add on the naan, as the meals don't come with it, and a mango lassi for a special treat.

The soups weren't my thing- lentil was more brothy than usual and the tomato was on the boring side. The tandoori chicken app was a bit dry, but the chana samosa chaat was a flavorful favorite. The muttar paneer and the chicken tikka were both robust with great sauces, but neither came with the requested heat level. Overall, I enjoyed our meal but my guy thought it was pretty average. I might come back for the dine-in buffet, but their dinner prices a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I may have to come back for the lamb rogan josh though!

Props for having a nicely appointed interior- I am really hoping they do not utilize their patio seating to offer hookah, which became the focus of previous businesses in this location. Also, management should note that options available through their online ordering system are different from what is available on site- probably something to address to avoid an issue.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,16,4,3gLr1ahytjt4I4YH8Vx9tg

I love the rice that Indian restaurants serve but since we were there an hour before the end of their buffet time, they came out with a different kind of white rice. Besides the salt factor, the food really wasn't bad. I've seen a few more options though at other places for buffet. The place does have a nice, unique setting though.

It was clearly a family restaurant. The owner took our order, explaining what the various foods were and how they were prepared. We ordered the navratan (?)

Their delivery price is also 9 bucks which is steep but I was desperate for some good Indian without leaving my house. I'm kinda lazy.

But that's two negatives out of many positives.  I've been searching for a delicious Indian place ever since I moved here.  I found some good ones but not a great one like this.  I'm originally from New York and travelled overseas so I know good Indian food when I taste it.  This place is 100%  it.  The best in Vegas. 

I ordered the vegetable samosas, which in my opinion were huge. They came with 2 sauces, one was made with cilantro and the other could possibly be mango.  It was more on the sweeter side but not chunky like a chutney. My one samosa was a little too salty but the other one was just fine. I'll obviously let it slide. It was yummy.

I ordered the butter chicken and the chicken korma.  I honestly couldn't decide between the 2 so I figured I would just eat them both within a couple days for lunches and dinner.  I made them both medium spiced because I didn't know how spicy they can get.  The flavors in both were amazing.  I dipped the pants off my onion naan in both sauces.  They were perfectly done.  It reminded me of the restaurant I go to back home so I was delighted.

The naan was excellent too. Full of red onion. Nice and soft. I wish it was a little bit more crisp but that's what you get when you order delivery.

Maybe their regular buffet cook called in sick or something because this was the first time that I didn't go for second helpings at a buffet.  I came in on a Friday for lunch around noon, and what I immediately noticed was how dark it was inside. There was only one person in before me, and I was disappointed to see that the buffet offerings were hardly much of anything compared to several other Indian restaurants I've tried. The goat meat was tough to chew, the tandoori chicken was dry, and the gulab jamun tasted like pasty, soggy cotton balls, ick.  The complimentary naan bread was average, but you only get buttered or plain whereas the higher end Indian buffets (like ahem, Mint Indian Bistro) generously include garlic naan made fresh to order.  At least the veggie curries were decent enough, but how can you mess up veggies simmered in curry sauce?  Thank goodness I know what better tasting Indian food tastes like, and I'll be returning to those buffets instead.",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,0,0,2,X_hHRScDqUl7Qc6pO-qB5w

I was the only one there on a Tuesday at 7:30pm. I ordered Malai Kofta to compare it with the same dish offered by Mount Everest on W Sahara. Mount Everest seems consistently very good, but I wanted to try a different place. Jannat was: Wrong choice, it turned out.

The three mistakes:

1) I ordered it spicy, 8/10. It arrived at tourist spice, maybe a 3. 

2) Garlic naan had enough garlic, but was otherwise really bland. The rice, Jasmine long grain, tasted mealy, and was clumped in places.

3) The menu, which listed these as $11.95 and $2.95 respectively, did not make the price trip to the final bill, which overcharged each by a dollar. The waitress/cashier seemed indignant that I had brought this up, and I politely showed her the menu, and the bill. After a bit of reprogramming, the final bill reflected the *actual* price. 

The waitress/cashier would have found out about #1 if she had ever visited the table after the order was taken, but it wasn't until late in the meal that she sauntered over.

The ambience is: converted Mexican Cantina. I expected at least normal, but they failed that test, and their customer service attitude was bizarre at best, insulting at worst.

We then placed our order
~Sweet Lassi $3.95
~Chilli chicken (spicy) $12.95
~chicken and egg fried rice $5.95

The lassi was perfect and the fried rice and chilli chicken were good.
What i noticed instantly  was the portions,they were way more generous than the average indian restaurants for the price point.Then the owner walked up to our table and asked us if we liked the Food,now me being a snob for indian food i was ready with various points and we got talking about how much we missed the taste of authentic Indian street food/dhabas.
He said they could totally customise it if we specify before ordering.

so I decided to get some food to-go
~Butter chicken $14.95
~Tandoori chicken $12.95
 
All the curries are served with a side of Rice.

I was blown away by the Tandoori chicken as was my husband and transported directly back to India.The chicken was well marinated,juicy and succulent with the right amount of spice.
The gravy of the butter chicken is one of the best i have had in the US.

We were so happy that we got the tandoori chicken and Cheese Naan to-go the very next day.
And Again it turned out to be perfect (this tandoori chicken is definitely a 5 in my books).

They also have a buffet for lunch which i'm going to try when i'm in town again.
