I live in Logandale but come to Vegas occasionally and always stop by Macayo's to eat before I head back. They have the best chips and salsa and I always get the chili relleno. I like the Mexican-American menu because there's always something for my picky wife and kids.and the atmosphere is really laid-back.

I have known the family since the early 70's when it was horseshow tradition to go eat there at their location on paradise road after a long day of showing.  I still go there 45 years later and get my favorite TCT and smooth sauce, love the chips and sauce, could be a meal on their own.  The beans and rice are great, even as leftovers.  I continue to take my horse show friends there, so, they too can experience in the tradition..  I miss Eddie Sr. He was the nicest man, but looks that his son, Eddie Jr, has things well in hand.

209400,2016-01-01,0,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,"Just went to dinner with my family for new years. Very few customers, yet, there were at least 15 servers that passed us. We were sat relatively fast, yet we were practically ignored for most of our meal. The waitress took our drink order, then came back 10 minutes later with them. By then, we were out of chips on both sides of the table, and of course, they were never refilled regardless of us asking, twice. She took our food order, and when it came, she was mixing up the orders, which is mostly understandable since they looked pretty much the same. Then after our drinks were emptied, we requested those be refilled, and they were not. Then, after biting into my food (grilled chicken tacos) I realized my chicken was dry as hell. I poured the chicken out of my tacos and just ate the lettuce, rice, and beans. Not exactly what I was paying $12 for. After complaining, I got a $2 military discount off of my bill. Yet, when requesting to speak with the manager, and requesting boxes, and refills YET again, I was ignored. So here I am, after filling out my comment card, letting you know not to go to this place when you want quality service and food. I have much more I could tell you (the skimpy-ness of my fianc√©'s shrimp tacos, the watery-ness of the salsa, etc.), but I'm just going to leave it as this. And the waitress's name was Wendy.

We arrived at Macayos at 8:55 pm and was promptly sat.  We were approached few min later by a heavy set Hispanic man (apparently our server) keep in mind not with a welcome but telling us they close in 2 min.  I informed him I did call before arriving & was told they close at 10.  Apparently, I frustrated him so he went and got Sammy to get our order.  Although Sammy was very nice he took our order in some blue gloves & served our food in same gloves (serving our food at same time as our desserts) Now I know for a fact Sammy was a busser & this is definitely NOT his job.  Handling food & disposing of dirty plates is a health code violation & his gloves illustrated Sammy probably didn't wash his hands. And I do commend Sammy for taking us when our server didn't care to serve us, if it wasn't for Sammy had we even got any service???  No one checked on us we were just given the cold shoulder.  Just shameful service.  I work as a server in one of the 5 star casinos on Las Vegas strip, had I provided service in which I received here I would have been in the managers office after shift.

The chips and salsa are crazy delicious. In fact, this is the first place I ever tried salsa (I told you I was picky!) and have been hooked ever since. They serve both smooth and chunky so you can make the decision for yourself.

Margaritas = :) 

I could see how people would say it's not very authentic. Fortunately for Macayo's, I am no expert on authenticity. But I hardly have to twist the arms of my friends who are experts in that field to dine at Macayo's with me.

I think I found my drink now that this place introduced itself to me during HAPPY HOUR:
 All week long! 3:30 pm - 6:30 pm (Available in Bar & Patio Only)

Happy Hour Specials: $4.75 16oz. Margarita de Macayo, $2.50 Domestic Bottle Beer, $3 Import Bottle Beer, &  1/2 price appetizers

Also, spreading the word here: $5.99 Lunch Specials 11am-3pm Mon-Fri

Monday_ Chimichanga de Macayo

Tuesday_ Beef taco & cheese enchilada with rice & beans

Wednesday_ Red or green chile burro with rice & beans

Thursday_ Chicken taco & chicken enchilada with rice & beans 

Friday_ Two cheese enchiladas with rice & beans

With that all announced, to my amazement the 1/2 price appetizers are big portions and one dish seems to do the job ;) (satisfaction) By the way, they sell this really cool se√±orita/se√±or glass cups & every time you bring it back to the bar you get discounted on your margarita drinks (I think at a minimum of 2 servings) 

Margarita Flavors: Strawberry, Mango, Peach, Melon, Raspberry, & Banana (I've tried all but banana & I'm in love) 

   Not to mention, the addicting chips & salsa served right when you're seated is just a teaser...

1258079,2013-10-24,0,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,"This is a very typical Mexican place.  Not upscale, buy not Taco Bell either.  Many things are likely from a can, the quality is minimal, the fat content is high but so is the flavor.  Macayo's is ideal for when you want some chips and various Tex Mex dips, tacos, burritos, chimichangas, etc.
Our first trip to Macayo's was on a friends recommendation.  He had some margarita beverage-ware (silly looking clay cups with either a Mexican man or woman's torso with a cup on the head).  If you bring this cup with you, margarita refills are hella cheap.($3-4)  The service was fairly bad.  It was an hour before closing, yet the bartender's (male, did not introduce himself) actions made it pretty clear that he couldn't be bothered with us and was ready to go home.   He made assumptions (don't give me a frozen margarita just because I am a girl and then look put off when I insist on having it on the rocks) and skimped on every aspect of service.  Nevertheless, we had queso on the brain and were determined to stay and make the best of it.
We had a trio of dips including spinach queso, chile queso, and beans for just under $10.  It was just what was needed and expected.
I had vegetarian fajitas and was thrilled with zucchini, squash, broccoli, peppers, and mushrooms, but not so thrilled that more than half of my total veggies were onions.  
The boys were all happy with their various tacos, nachos, and burritos.  Rob recommends the beef burrito.  For some reason, 2 of our friends decided to WAY over tip even though the service was hesitant at best.  Maybe next time this guy will remember us and be more attentive?
My return trip several weeks later was much better!  Michelle being behind the bar brought happy, prompt service.  She clarified all of our orders---yes, I would like that on the rocks:) smiled, was well-informed on menu items, and had a general sense of pride in her job.  
We repeated the tasty-fattening trio of dips and I remembered to order my  veggie fajitas sans onions.  Success!
I can't give it more than 3 stars due to:
Lack of ambiance and music(we played our own Pandora the first time)
Low quality of ingredients, especially the pink/white tomatoes and iceberg lettuce.
However, I will be back because sometimes you just need some crappy delicious Tex Mex and a margarita.

1408327,2014-08-15,0,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,"Macayo's is a chain but it is a staple of my visits to Vegas. Partly because it is about 2 blocks from my mom's house and partly because I absolutly LOVE their tortilla soup. It is super simple as it consists of broth, cheese and tortilla chips with a little bit of stewed tomatoes. No meat.
I really like their chips and sauce. The chips are thin and they serve two different sauces. One is mild and slightly chunky and the other is a little hotter and smooth like a taco sauce. Both are good but I typically gravitate towards the hotter one or I combine them together.
Also, can't pass up a margarita when I go with mom. If you purchase one of their margarita glasses you get a discount on the margaritas whenever you bring it back in. I bought one probably 20 years ago but never think to take it with me. Guess I should try to remember that next time I head to Vegas.
Macayo's was a popular ""after football game"" hangout for high school students back in the 70s so it is always a little nostalgic for me to go there. Unfortunately, back then, I only ate burgers :(",S_llEH0Hdbipg1xUAmr7kw,0,2,4,3hy74B0oFLcm3MMon7-aIQ

The decor is cute, so I guess that's what the mandatory 1 star goes to.

You see, it was a birthday dinner so our table was about 14 deep. We advised the waiter who and what would be on which check UP FRONT. It's a pain to separate checks (some guests at our table being servers themselves) so we made sure to be patient and accurate so as to make everyone's lives a little easier.

The food came out, and my nachos were allllll cheese and meat. Nachos should be a balance of toppings! 
My mom got fajitas and they were overcooked and mushy. The margaritas were weak and could have perhaps passed as salty virginitas.
Again our table had 14 people so I won't bore you with the rest of the dishes.

Worst part, the checks...
So the waiter comes back and starts writing down what we had on a big roll of receipt paper. What? No, I wanna go home now. This should be the easy part where you swipe my card and I tip you and I go. 

I was the first to hand off my debit card. After over 15 minutes I went to check on my card, being as everyone else got theirs back already. After ""accidentally"" adding 3 different things to another guest's bill, they kept my card as a sort of ""insurance"" for if they couldn't figure out who the items belonged to. I was upset that there wasn't any communication on our waiter's behalf, because I'm a very understanding person. But to sit around while everyone else has left the table did not make me feel very good.

1939069,2015-05-07,19,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,"""Macayo's is serving up the most white-washed Mexican food I've ever tasted""

I couldn't agree with Cassandra B any more... except I think that is awesome. Look when I decide to get authentic Mexican food here are a list of places I don't look:

1. Summerlin
2. End of list

Growing up in Minnesota Taco Bell is ""too ethnic"" for my tastes so Macayo fits the bill for me perfectly. Add in its a 10 minute drunken stumble... err, walk home and I couldn't be happier. 

I think you have to compare Macayo to other similar restaurants- Macayo is not as good as border grill, but it is WAY better than say Cantina Laredo or just about every other Tex Mex style restaurant in the state. So for those of you who don't authenticity check every restaurant you go to, here is the guide to Macayo for n00bs

Step 1: Margaritas. They have lots of them, frozen or on the rocks. Get at least 3

Step 2: Trio Dip- I love Queso. By Queso I mean the white cheese dip you get at some Mexican restaurants. Las Vegas appears to be a Queso wasteland (BTW if you are reading this and you know where to get White Cheese dip- NOT QUESO FUNDIDO thats gross- please send me a message and you can have my first born... and any other born for that matter). Macayo does not have traditional white queso but they do have yellow cheese dip that is certainly passable in a pinch. The trio comes with this dip, bean dip, and a combo cheese/spinach dip that is shockingly good. I say shockingly because who would ever think to ruin perfectly good cheese by adding spinach? Sorry popeye but that vile weed has no place on a plate destined for human consumption. I digress. Anywhoo you should be finishing your second margarita by the time you polish off this dip trio

Step 3: Entrees. They have a really big menu, however, there are only 2 correct choices of food to order; Fajitas or a Chimichanga. Lets start with the fajitas- not the best I've had but you get a crapload of pretty good food for the money. No real complaints. The chimi- these are really good. For those of you who don't know a Chimichanga is a burrito that is then fried, like french fries or anything edible in the south. They have a few different chimichangas but to be honest you should be on Marg 3 at this point and the subtle differences will probably be lost on you. 


Step 4: If still conscious, return to step 1 and rinse/repeat.


Some people have said ""the salsa is bad"". They are exaggerating, its certainly passable. I have no idea if they make it in house or not ( I would guess not) but... its the free salsa you get at the beginning of the meal, its really not that important. 

Others have said the service is bad, it never has been for me. I have been several times during busy hours and while the servers aren't like all over the place I never go more than a few minutes without water in my glass or chips on the table.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,8,11,5,CHyriFZnf54161AskVdCUA

1976771,2016-03-24,0,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,"Macayos is what I would consider a TexMex style Mexican food. Are they comparable to say nearby Bonito Michocan? No. Cantina Laredo. No. How about Cantina El Dorado?  No. Why? Because they're all different styles of Mexican food. One is based on the state of Michocan style food, one specializes in organic, and the other is a trendy Mexican place. It's apples and oranges really. 

With that said, I love all types of Mexican food. As mentioned, I think the fare at macayos is considered TexMex and I think it's perfectly acceptable in terms of flavor. It's not the best Mexican food in the world, but it's tasty and consistent. 

What sets this establishment apart is the Baja sauce. I can't get enough of it... The menu states that it's spicy, but I beg to differ.  My southwestern taste buds think it to be nothing near spicy, but some may consider it mild. Only those w really sensitive taste buds would think it's spicy. 

My fave menu items include the Baja burrito, Baja chimi, green chile burro, & enchilada sampler (request shredded beef). Their green sauce is tasty. Also fun, request the server to put green sauce and Baja sauce on your burrito for an awesome taste experience. 

They service here is of regular quality.  On the last visit we sat in the dining area & a bus person had a tray full of chips and salsa asking if anyone needed refills. That's the first I've seen of that- it was a nice touch and improved customer service during the dinner rush. 

I believe this chain are originally from Arizona. The restaurants there have outdoor seating and a slightly different menu (but very similar). I'm a little bummed the NV locations don't have outdoor seating like their AZ counterparts :-(",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,1,4,dNjGkG1wVQ6RH6yatJgpJQ

Lunch combos are cheap, menu has a lot of choices. Stuck to fairly safe options, including a chile relleno (I liked the sauce but pepper was soggy and had no spice) and chicken enchiladas (bland and unmemorable), rice and beans did not stand out. 

You can do worse for Mexican food, but you can also do better... maybe getting a margarita makes their food more tolerable. If I come back, it'll be for HH.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,11,3,NiJNJM6i3Iug4N_B3lkvBA

Fail #1- Our party of 6 adults + a baby was shoved into a half booth that can only probably comfortably seat 4. Then a chair was added to the other side of the table to make extra room. I arrived a few minutes after everyone else and I would have requested to be moved if drinks/chips weren't already on the table. This seating arrangement was a cluster. There was hardly any room for ourselves let alone our food. I felt like a sardine in a can and I wasn't even sitting in the booth. Everyone's elbows were touching and there was no room for our plates. Most of us ordered the TCT which is a large tortilla with cheese and they come on these round metal trays and there was just no room at all. 

Fail #2- Our server. He was nice and friendly but sucked at serving and that's a problem considering it was his job. There were 6 of us, not 15. It shouldn't be that hard. We had to ask multiple times for refills, sides of stuff we had ordered that had not arrived, etc. Food was dropped off to the wrong person and it was all quite annoying.

Fail #3- The food. To start I ordered the baja sauce to eat with my chips. The baja sauce is like a cream cheese jalapeno dip and it's amazing. I eat it with the bland tortilla chips they serve cause the ""salsa"" they serve you is actually just tomato sauce and it's awful. Anyway this sauce is supposed to come hot, but it arrived cold to the table. I sent that back right way and asked for it to be made hot. It was weird because the bowl it came in was hot, but the dip was not. If you eat here, make sure to ask for a side of that. For my entree I ordered the TCT with shredded beef, beans and sour cream on it. My friend ordered a TCT with shredded beef and sour cream but on the side. I received my TCT with all toppings on the side. Not that this was a big deal, but just another slight annoyance. The TCT is my favorite thing there, and it's just a big ass tortilla with cheese and toppings. If the best item is a damn tortilla with cheese, I would say that's a problem.

All in all, I would have to say this visit makes me not want to come back here ever again and that's sad! I've been eating at Macayo's for years. If you are looking for good Mexican food, I would say this is NACHO place.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,5,2,CVTkDvw13OW0wjD1albYMQ

The food was good but not true Mexican food. I think this place is more of like American-Mexican food rather than true hole in the wall Mexican food. Our waitress brought out the wrong order and she was so sweet because she let us keep the meal anyway. You're seated at your table then greeted with a bowl of tostada chips and salsa. Okay y'all, this salsa isn't true Mexican salsa. It tastes like pace salsa and red sauce. The salsas and pico I have tried have seeds in it, charred pieces from the cast iron skillet and a taste of homemade salsa and pico. 

The amount of food they give you are very generous portions though. If you get an appetizer, I HIGHLY suggest getting the chicken wings! They are crispy with that nice crunch you're looking for when you eat wings! That's my first favorite. We left with 3 freaking to-go boxes! It looks like we didn't even eat! We also got their deep fried ice cream for dessert and it was good! It's a ball of vanilla ice cream coated in like corn flakes and honey mixture and places in a flat cone on the plate.

The food.  I've tried two things on the menu and both were delicious:  the Street Tacos (with carnitas as the choice of meat), and the Spicy Chilorio.  The street tacos were on flour tortillas instead of corn, but this was a pleasant change.  And the amount of meat on them was very generous and very delicious.  I was stuffed and very happy.  The Spicy Chilorio was actually mild, but still very delicious.  This is definitely a new favorite comfort food, perfect with the tortillas on the side and begging to be ordered on a chilly day.  Fresh chips and two kinds of salsa are there for you to enjoy while you wait for your food, and after ordering, everyone's orders came out together and in a very reasonable amount of time.  

The staff.  Both visits included an incredibly nice staff, from the person who seated us to the waiters and waitresses that took care of us at the table.  As you know, even the best of food served by bad staff is ruined.  That's not a problem here--great staff!

The decor.  I believe it's pretty standard for this chain, but it's nice and not necessarily ""standard"" in terms of other Mexican restaurants.  With artwork painted on the walls instead of just framed pictures, it's a very nice change of pace.  Everything is also very clean and in good repair.

Parking.  There's lots of parking around the restaurant.  Take note that the entrance is on the west side of the building and not on what I would have thought was the front (facing Sahara Blvd).  Frankly, with the entrance where it is, it's more convenient relative to where you'll probably park.

Not much more to say other than I'll definitely go back regularly, and I hope to see you there too!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,2,2,4,kuSNT3cr8QD_81DfJUJDbQ

My favorite thing to get here is the bowl of albondigas  soup and a large TCT; *drool*.  I have tried other things of course such as the yummy cheesy enchiladas, the big tasty chimichangas, and rolled tacos.

I have never experienced bad soup, chiladas, or TCT; and I'd say I have been well over 200 times so that's a pretty good record.

I had a taste for nachos or enchiladas. The cashier that was taking our order to go we didn't want to dine in said she would have to Check with the cooks first to see if they could prepare my boyfriends burrito without seasoning . The manager eventually came over and clarified that they could make it but after checking to see what they had in the freezer she discovered they were running out of bell peppers they only had a small amount of green ones and no red ones . How do you run out ? She said the shipment would not be coming in until the next morning . I couldn't believe this but unfortunately we ended up leaving and going down the street to Nacho Daddy. Unfortunate because their food is not even comparable it was awful no flavor and cold .

My go to's include the spicy chicken wings which are very flavorful and not to spicy to where you can't enjoy it.  They give you more than enough and are lightly breaded so not your typical wings you get from a bar.  Their blue cheese is not good nor the ranch so don't bother.  The sauce is all you need.  The shredded beef burrito enchilada style is very good.  They are more than generous with the beef and it is TASTY!  My wife loves the chips and salsa there but I really don't, salsa is too bland and runny for me.  Now the absolute MAIN reason to go here is the TCT appetizer.  It is to die for.

A friend and I went to this location for dinner recently.  We were seated in the normal dining room section...and then left for ten minutes.  Well, during that time we perused the menu and picked out exactly what we wanted.  When the waitress finally approached our table, she took our drink orders and then left before we could give her our appetizer or entre order.  She came back fairly quickly with our drinks, took our appetizer order and then left again.

As we were waiting for our appetizer order (a cup of queso dip) I heard her approach the recently seated people behind me and ask them for their drink order.  The woman had indicated that they were ready to order their food also, so she prepared to take their order.  These are people that were seated after us.  At this point, I heard the party behind us inquire about the queso dip and the waitress responded, ""These girls over here just ordered queso, so when it's done, I'll bring it by your table first so you can see what it looks like.""  Really?  I've already waited long enough and I'm pretty hungry, but I have to wait longer for you to bring an item I'm paying for to another table for a display reason?

She finally came back to get our actual orders and I requsted a grilled chicken quesadilla with no peppers or onions, just chicken and cheese.  The waitress asked me...""so, you don't want the chicken we normally prepare with the onions and peppers?""  No, I just said that I didn't want that.  When our food came out, my plate only had the quesadilla, no sour cream, no quacamole...nothing.  I stopped her and asked if she could bring me a side of sour cream and she says...""I thought when you said no garnishes that you meant everything.""  Ok, first off, I never said ""no garnishes.""  I said that I didn't want onions or peppers IN my food.  She also failed to honor my friend's request that they prepare her enchilada with extra sauce.

I think I'm just sick of getting ready to go out and paying for the experience, just for it to be so mediocre.  I know how to make a quesadilla and how to make an enchilada, next time I'll just stay home and do it all myself.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,0,0,2,YreubGPVdga4hvqKZfgUUA

If you look at the photo, you can see how greasy the soup was and her fajita was even worse...she picked up a piece and it was completely soaked. Luckily she had already filled up on stale chips and TCT so she didn't have to eat much. The Baja chimi was ok but the tortilla also tasted stale and to say the shredded beef lacks flavor is putting it lightly. 

If you're in the mood for Mexican food, don't waste your time with Macayo's. There are much better places in town, many of which are the same price or even cheaper! The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is they made a pretty decent margarita and our waitress this time around was very friendly. The food is barely worth one star and until the next birthday, I won't be coming back!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,2,1,2,7DCmDH9DnvqVlk-ng6d8ew

My faves...
Spicy Chilorio, a delicious mix of creamy cheese, chiles, onions and either shrimp or chicken. Served with a large helping of beans and a side of tortillas it's like a heartier, more delicious chile con queso.

Baja Chimichanga
A huge chimichanga smothered in ranchero sauce as well as their classic, sour cream-based spicy Baja Sauce.

The waitress brings it out with chicken. I politely remind her that I had ordered it without. She argues with me and tells me, ""No, you ordered this with chicken!"" Shocked that she's arguing with me, I incredulously reply, ""I'm on a vegetarian diet, why would I order it with chicken?"" She gave more attitude and we talked about not going back.

A few months went by and we decided to give this location one more chance. Our food was terrible (overcooked, etc). We asked to swap out our entries. My wife, on the way back to our table from the bathroom, overheard the waiter making fun of us for being too picky. Who does that? How can such a person even have a job as a waiter? Hopefully, he got a job picking up trash on the side of the road and no longer works there. But we'll never know because we are never ever ever going back to Macayo's.

In summary: poorly prepared food and even worse service. Save yourself a trip. If you want to know what it's like dining here, just stay home, microwave a burrito, and repeatedly smack yourself in the face with it.",DW2vIcFMpAHAVbO0bZiLbA,2,0,1,rI9SQGjouVQo_x-mD834xg

We ordered the chili queso dip and it was SOOO good! I ordered pollo con Espinaca which was pretty good. Tortillas were great, beans and rice were average, the sauce was amazing, but the actual meat wasn't. The sauce would be amazing if it was on fresh grilled chicken breast, but the chicken that I had tasted like frozen precut strips like from a lean cuisine meal. It was rubbery and not great. 

My dad got the fajitas and said the meat was flavorful, but veggies were overlooked. I personally like soft veggies, but to each his own!

I still enjoy to this day their chips and salsa. The TCT is always a great appetizer as well. However, I'm saddened to say that overall, their food sucks.  I have tried a large portion of things on the menu at one time or another and 90% of it is nothing special at all.  This is a terrible reality for me as I want to say it's great.  After being served what looked like a bowl of vomit today aka Chicken Chiliorio, I had to write the review.  This sounded so tasty on the menu but comes out so awful looking and tasting I had to end lunch without eating it.

I really enjoy the food here. No, it's not what my Mexican family makes, but it is good for what it is. I am addicted to their Baja sauce. You could put it on shoe leather and I would eat it up and ask for more! Do yourself a favor and try the Baja enchiladas with extra Baja loveliness. 

As well as the Baja sauce, their smooth salsa is delightful. I have been known to pour it all over whatever I am eating for an extra level of yum. It also goes wonderfully with the Baja sauce. I live me some saucy goodness!!!

If you aren't in the mood for a big meal, check out the mini chimichangas. Add cheese on top and you have a great snack. Throw in a margarita and you have a party in your mouth!

CHIPS & SALSA: Chips were average but goodness gracious, that watered down salsa is the worst (to include store-bought) I've ever had. Zero flavor. It's basically red water. 1/5

CALIFORNIA BURRITO ($10.49): Way too much sour cream and forgettable in every way. Presentation was very boring as well. 1/5

BAJA BURRITO ($10.99): My husband said his ""wasn't that bad"" but agreed we would not be coming back. 3/5

SERVICE: Our waiter was the one bright spot on our visit. He kept up on refills and cleared up plates quick like. He also got our check ASAP when asked. Food was out in a jiffy and we were seated right when we walked in. 4/5

ATMOSPHERE: Kind of sad and nothing special. Decor is drab and the layout is weird. They tried to seat us in this domed auditorium area with A/C fans blasting on us at first. Nope, not happening. We moved to a different section and were much happier. 2/5

Return Visit?
Yeah, um no. Macayo's needs to make REAL salsa and step up the flavor in their dishes!

The happy hour specials are reduced priced drinks and half off appetizers. Our problem was that we had a 90 year old waiter that had huge difficulties taking orders and getting them right. We ordered drinks that took forever to receive even though we were sitting 5 feet away from the bar. I walked up to the bartender (at the bar) at one point to order another drink and was quickly told that I had to wait for the old man to come back. The appetizers we ordered came out in sporadic order, some never came at all so we had to reorder. He even brought us a few we didn't order. I saw another table haggling with the waiter about the check he received as well. They need to either hire an additional waiter for the bar area during happy hour, or find one that can multitask efficiently.

One of the reasons for coming back is their Baja sauce, love it on everything. I usually get the Baja chimi. You have your choice of meat, I usually get shredded. Always tender and has good flavor. It's rolled up in a flour tortilla, then fried, and smothered in their chili relleno sauce and finally topped with Baja sauce. I also get sour cream and guacamole to top it off. 

Usually the thing is a bit soggy by the time it reaches the table with only the ends still a bit crisp. But I really don't mind, I come for the Baja sauce!  

You can get it alone, with rice or beans or both, or as my husband's choice with fries! The end less bowl of chips and two red salsa, one chunky and one a bit smoky. To top it off, they have sopapillas with butter and honey!

We order food and there was a confusion with the order. My wife ordered 1 taco and the  waiter (kyle) brought 4. He explained to us that it would be fine and not to worry. He said he wouldn't charge us for the extra tacos.  Once we where done eating we ask for a to go box to put our food away.  The waiter then informs us that we could not  have to extra food. So we inform him that we would gladly pay for it since I had already put my food in same container. It wasn't our mistake but we were fine with paying for the extra food. He said it's fine he would fix it. When we went to pay for the food the supervisor informed us that she had removed the charge for the extra food. When we finished paying for meal my wife was  picking up the food container at which point the supervisor snatches the food out of my wife's hand with out saying a word. We assume it was ok to take it since the waiter continued to say it was ok to take it.  We were in shock and just walk out. She took the extra tacos and half of my food that I had paid that was in the same container. We have notified  office and hopefully something is done about that rude supervisor. 
 None of this was our fault. We were given the wrong food. We were told it would be free since the waiter made the  mistake. Then we were  treated like we were trying to steal food. We understood there was a confusion. What we are mad about was how that supervisor just snatched the food out of my wife's hand like if we were trying to steal it.",hrIUhaMB2QpyIONPyYuskQ,1,0,1,K5oP_10MA4FjsE4CQ0WEiQ

Good service, everyone's food was as order and hot. The best house margarita . They have great singing voices too. Can't wait until my next TCT.",JNE1e8ngRW40Bad61S0iYw,0,0,4,aBMp0Xp8BR7hER5NCA8qfQ

I love the enchiladas, shredded beef and green sauce. I have also had a steak there and it had cheesy goodness on top...bomb.

They have a good happy hour as well:)",m7nAGNXl3eqMRE5R4vzu2Q,0,1,5,1w1XYxfyh7cy7h3UaI5TDA

Their chips and salsa are not what most places would call ""traditional"" salsa, but it is good. I only come here occasionally now if I am looking for a quick and cheap meal.
Their TCTs are simple and tasty without being greasy. In the bar area they have happy hour which is half price all appetizers , including TCTs, which are a great price.",-5ye1ya0wRQhNRF9NfQ1fA,0,0,4,zwrdZ-UMJE86yQsweAoIsA
5838442,2017-08-01,0,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,Very poor service. I call in to place an order and am advised it will be ready in 10 minutes. I arrive 12 minutes later and of course they want the money. I wait another 15 and call from my cell a lady comes I ask for my money back. The manager comes with the food by this time I just want to leave not with food just my money. I wouldn't recommend it go back.,UZyUsEZKFSzOxjx7ZXLB2g,0,0,1,lL_FjsZ9p9SR6P_FMexaeg

1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. 

2. expensive for the low quality 

3. service is bad 

4. miserable decor 

Don't waste your money! 

Worst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! 

I suggest ""Super Mex"" see my review! Durango/215.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,3,1,TdNgIoAANP_5AeFGEURHfA

We ordered margaritas to start, and enjoyed chips and salsa.... I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco, my food was delicious! I would definitely recommend Macayo's....

i liked our waitress; our food not so much.  the chips were alright.  salsa tasted store-bought or like it came out of the can.  i mostly got full off of that because the food took a while.  ordered a three choice meal. i chose a deep fried shredded beef taco, sour cream green chicken enchilada, and tamale with a chicken tortilla soup on the side.  the best of my choices was the sour cream green chicken enchilada.  everything else was meh. the food is more americanized and it's acceptable for that matter, but disappointing for me as i was expecting authentic.  

i probably won't be back again.",h-_7eL4MCaXavXKJZOFeEg,0,0,2,CEIcWfmKgP6r4k9NKDD0ng

5960133,2014-05-18,3,yvqcZrHixuf_oIUW83xUcQ,"Don't come Macayo's expecting great food or even good food. I have only tried their happy hour which is until 6:30 on weekdays. On the few occasions I have come it has been with regulars and the service is always impeccable. The staff is very sweet and accommodating and they seem to know all the regulars by name. 

The food is lacking in pretty much every ways but if you stick to the happy hour menu and keep your expectations low, you'll have a great time. Margaritas are cheap and tasty and I've always had a good time when I'm there, for what it's worth.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,4,3,7Bv5T2fhKEkK2pHKkX3S6A
