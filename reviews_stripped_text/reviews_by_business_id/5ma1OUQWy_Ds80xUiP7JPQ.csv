My boyfriend and I left really disappointed, especially after spending $30 here (2 burgers, fries, and a drink). Definitely not worth the money. It took forever to get our food, and when we did get it, my burger came out wet and soggy? Literally there was water at the bottom of my plate and it was just so unappetizing I couldn't get past three bites (coming from someone who doesn't lose their appetite easily). On top of that, the cashier who was taking my order was giving me dirty looks when I was nothing but polite. Not really sure how I offended her but ok..... 

Bottom line - I don't get annoyed easily but this place is the one exception. Please don't waste your hard earned cash here when there are about a billion other burger joints in this town. So not worth it!!!!!",R5p2iFSrj2JlZ2H_xNg6tg,0,0,1,enOkW9mM7koPQzuB5Nspyw

182187,2016-09-04,0,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"Fukuburger is the spot for quality burgers. I've tried the Tamago (which is their most popular), the Buta, and the Katsu, and they are all excellent. The thing I enjoy the most is that each kind of burger (and the sandwich) has a distinction in taste so each burger is different from one another. Their burger meat is definitely the highlight. It's juicy, full of flavor, and the perfect size.

They are somewhat more on the pricey side (close to restaurant prices), but you are also paying for quality. This isn't McDonalds with a factory spitting 100 meat patties out of a machine every 5 seconds.

The fries are very tasty. The only thing is that they are kind of thick, but that's just my preference for thinner fries. 

The atmosphere is very laidback as the employees are very welcoming and friendly. The walls are painted nicely with a great design (major props to the artist). The TVs are always playing sports, Power Rangers, and Anime (usually it was Naruto). They even have board games you can play.

Definitely a spot to check out, especially if you and your friends want a new spot to hang out at.

My bf and I went to the actual restaurant today and again the food was not as good as the first time I had it, but it wasn't horrible either.  

My bf got the tomago and it was good but not worth the $$.

I got the katsu and it literally had 3 chicken patties on it so that one seemed like it was worth what I was paying but there was barely any crack sauce on it and not a lot of cabbage either for the amount of meat! 

The garlic fries were good at the beginning but by the time we were eating the last ones they were pretty crunchy and dry. 

The crack sauce was also rly lacking flavor today! 

Lastly, this doesn't have to do with the food but we overheard and saw, who we assumed to be the manager get really upset with a chef and was yelling at him.. don't get me wrong we understand if ur worker screws up its ok to say something but be aware of the fact the kitchen is open to the entire restaurant, and that doesn't look good for u or the restaurant!",APFFOFEWKMv_LGf97CQHsg,0,0,3,cXn94Bi0xIerRO7TrOKuOQ

Image the scene from the movie ""Half Baked"" where one employee conveys the order to the cook sitting 3 feet away via loud microphone- that just happened. I don't think this was coincidence.

My burger actually mirrored the picture in the menu (mouth watering). The photo attached to this review does not do it justice. Back to the cow I was indulging.

I realized the Sierra Mist lacked the sweet syrup taste and it tasted like club soda instead. The woman came by and informed me they just changed the Sierra Mist machine and Offered to replace my soda. The food was good. I rated at as a 3 because I guess I was expecting it to be much better.

They provided meals to the police force in the wake of the horrible shooting on the LV strip. This is a small but powerful gesture that was greatly appreciated! 

Now, as for the restaurant itself, think 50's burger joint meets anime. It's a cool place with anime art on the walls and ceilings. The menu is just the right size with selections that don't overwhelm you, but all look delicious and will have you scheduling regular returns to try everything. After you place your order you are asked to provide a funny name rather than your own. This catches some off guard so prepare early! 

The food itself was great, the burger patties were formed as if they were patted together by hand rather than press and grilled on a flat skillet rather than a grill, charring the flavor and juices into the meat. 

The staff was friendly and attentive and the cost was very reasonable.

Update: Since speaking with their owner Collin about the issue, he was not aware and has since taken action to fix the premature closings.

Personal favorite is the Tamago. Burger that comes with a sunny side up egg. So bomb and satisfies cravings so well. And you have to get it with the jazz fries. Don't miss out on JAZZ FRIES.

One might make the argument that typically I'm not even a burger person, but it's for a reason! I've been consistently dissapointed by the burgers I've experienced here- I even contemplated eating the tonkatsu burger instead (I'm sure it's probably delicious though) but instead took a risk with the burger and WOWIE WAS IT IMPRESSIVE! The flavors all worked amazing together, which wasn't suprising because we are both big fans of Asian food but the most amazing part of it all was the BURGER!! 

 Juicy juicy juicy and just with one bite you could tell the meat was quality- I COULD TASTE THE MEAT, I know it shouldn't be such an accomplishment but it's one of the hardest things to find here in Vegas. Service was fast and everyone was really friendly. The vibes were chill, the music was nice and the atmosphere is awesome.

The decor is interesting, decorated with anime/comic inspired theme, the menu and burgers were clearly displayed on the wall. Noise level was moderate and overall a inviting atmosphere.

I waited for about 10 minutes for a katsu burger, when the cook finished with the katsu, I was standing next to the counter and saw that he asked another worker to examine it. The second person looked at the overcooked chicken katsu, nodded and proceeded to make the burger. 

He must have thought I wouldn't be able to tell with the excessive amount of sauce he put on there, but the burger was messy, tough to chew and super greasy.

1372095,2018-03-22,0,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,Fuku Burger is a fine establishment. With a fun Japanese anime type ish atmosphere friendly staff and good food. What really impresses me though is that they stand by their product and they listen to their customers which is a breath of fresh air in today's society. When I had a problem with my order I was contacted shortly thereafter by the manager who went out of their way to make it right. Which shows a lot of respect for the customers and deep pride in their work that is rare nowadays. The only caveat that I can say about them now is that if you get their Jazz fries to go you need to specify that you want the gravy and the sauce on the fries otherwise they will give you the gravy in the sauce separate. This was a problem for me the first time however after having been explained the context as to why they do that it makes more sense. They explained to me that they had gotten complaints that the gravy in the sauce made the fries too soggy which I can understand. So if that's your biggest concern then I wouldn't mention anything otherwise if you want the gravy and a sauce to be on the fries on a to-go order you would need to tell them which is not too much of an imposition as they are happy to make any reasonable changes to your order. Overall though it was a very nice experience. I like the fact they take responsibility and the day show respect and care for their customers. Initially I had thought their prices were a bit High but given the customer care that you receive at this place I'd say it's pretty fair I think it's safe to assume I will be returning in the future at some point in time as I already did like this place due to its fun atmosphere and friendly staff even before they showed how much they care for their customers.,CkUfTZdDsiHqTvkbKCBNQA,0,0,5,dXJPgEj3JAaS1ELGb5Qalg

It was all hot and fresh without the gimmicks of the chain restaurants.

I stumbled upon Fuku Burger past midnight on a Friday night and didn't expect much. I was hungry and they had burgers, end of story. Little did I know, I was about to go on a roller coaster of umami. 

I ordered the #4 - Kinoko, and upon first bite, I felt my body transcend into another dimension and I actually watched myself eating the amazing burger I had ordered. 

But on a more serious note, the amazing blend of Shitake Mushrooms, Teriyaki and Pickled Ginger complimented the meat extremely well. I also could tell immediately that the patty they used came from high quality beef source, which shows that the owner really cares about the product that he or she is putting out to the public. 

As a band manager, I travel a lot, and you better believe anytime I'm in Vegas, Fuku Burger will be a definite stop for me. Bar none, the best burger I've had in my life until this point.

Japanese burgers...they look exactly like you'd expect. Unfortunately, I was extremely hungry the day I came, so I wasn't in the mood to be adventurous. I got the safest thing on the menu that I knew I would eat a lot of--the katsu burger. Little did I know how massive each burger is...
Despite my hunger, I was unable to finish my food.

One of the perks to their new brick in mortar location (besides being convenient to me!) is that their food quality is consistent and their service has improved. The location also offers free wifi, as well as fun music and videos playing for entertainment while you wait.

While their Buta Burger is still my favorite- always juicy, plenty of flavor!- the Naga dog is also a solid option. However, a flaw I've noticed with both is the bread. The burger buns are bulk-purchase and don't stand out, and tend to fall apart. I'd prefer a sturdier version (maybe an onion bun?), the King's Hawaiian buns would be a really great option, especially for the hotdog.

I'm a little disappointed to see that the pricing is still a bit high- $8 for a burger is fair, adding $5 for a drink and fries is steep, and $9 for the (admittedly generously-sized) Naga dog is higher than several local specialty hotdog spots price theirs. I guess I expect slightly inflated pricing for food trucks, but to see the same prices here as at their Strip location was unexpected.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,15,3,vwX3c5xtfnyWRXPY0E14rg

This burger had fried onion strings, furikake (Japanese rice seasoning), pickled ginger, fried egg, and wasabi mayo. I thought the wasabi would be spicy, but I couldn't even taste it--it was one cohesive delicious flavor. Not spicy at all--which is good. The buns were soft, toasted on the edges, delicious and really kept the burger together. I've had other Japanese burgers before (Bachi Burger) and i can't say one is better than the other--they are different. Bachi uses more sauce and toppings--definitely a two hand, sit down burger (poss knife & fork). Fuku packs more flavor into the meat, so it's less messy, but still flavorful. You could eat a Fuku burger with one hand. The jazz fries with crack sauce and gravy were delicious, too!",1eUohs5zVhEKu54hiJn39g,0,0,4,9mDWdTMvZvTL1BGy-4R7MA

The burgers are unique and very juicy; I can't imagine anyone would ever complain of dryness to their food. The sauces and spices that are infused in the burgers make for a very different burger experience, and in this case different is good. Crack sauce is great too, goes with everything. 
Their portions aren't huge but it's definitely enough to hit the spot. However, Prices are a little high for the atmosphere and cuisine. A combo will run you $13.50 which are sit-down restaurant prices, so that may be enough to turn some people off. The location  is quite small as well so be prepared to push some tables together if you're in a group.

1872615,2017-04-25,0,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"well, coming from Los Angeles, i am already familiar with this DELICIOUS establishment. You can read my review about the location in Hollywood that closed down here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/fuku-burger-los-angeles?hrid=RF-w9YK0wH7RBFtM1G-D_Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)

After recently moving to Las Vegas, I found myself not wandering the strip for some commercialized BS burger like you can get @ Gordan Ramsay crap restaurant at the PFF (ph, get it?) but driving around the outskirts looking for some good, local spots. Craving a burger we just searched for burger and boom, there Fuku was. While driving i was a little skeptic that it was from the original owner and the same as the location in Hollywood. Well, a few days later I stopped by and was very happy about the results.

The spot is in a small, stand alone burger stand on Jones Blvd. completely opposite to what was over in Hollywood. That place was pretty massive. So this new spot is decked out with Mr Fuku's wise cracking, in-your-face-oh-well style and charisma at a much smaller, personal feel kind of space. There are punch lines and attention grabbers from the entrance to the bathroom.

I walked up to the counter and literally started to salivate enough to the point that it might have looked disgusting when i opened my mouth to request the #5 Karai burger (which if you read my review from the Hollywood location, it is the same burger!)

as I ordered it, i realized that i can't choose the ""hotness"" of my burger! Well that was a little bit of a let down, because over the course of numerous trips to the Hollywood location that is one of the draws i loved was telling the server to hit me with a 10 on the spicy scale.

so i ordered the #5 combo, took my pepsi and sat down waiting, kind of bouncing my leg hoping i was going to get what i had been missing once i realized the closure in Hollywood to now. a few minutes past by, just the right amount of time and my food was up.

the presentation doesn't do the foods quality and taste justice. it comes in a basket with the same paper it sat on in the Hollywood location. the fries i got were the standard seasoned fries, and those were delicious. i had extra hot sauce added to my burger so i could see it dripping off the side. honestly i just dove right in with a fork because i knew it was going to get messy, and i was right.

the first taste to the end had nothing but complete satisfactory with each bite.

The burger and fries were delicious. I went back today and had the sauce on the side, that way i can add the sauce to the burger as i need to.

No complaints at all. Mr Fuku, you got a fan back!",Px6w_kTNBuy0GceThHnccw,0,0,5,0uqpqqyz2Y5gNgc3TH_QNQ

I didn't even end up finishing my burger and just tossed it would've rated it a good 2/3 stars based on food. Fast forward to this morning I wake up to realize I got food poisoning from this place. I've been throwing up every few hours it's currently 3am and can't keep anything but water down. I knew something was off with that breaded chicken. I shouldn't of ate here. The worst mistake ever. I knew this gave me food poisoning because all I had for breakfast was toast peanut butter. And my throw up showed me what was wrong.... let me tell you it was chicken chunks and pieces of fries.

I got the Tamago Burger with the Jazz fries, and it was all surprisingly bland. 

The only noticeable flavor on my burger was overly sweet teriyaki sauce. The sauce drowned out the taste of the egg, the crispy onions, and the wasabi mayo. The burger itself was over cooked and only seasoned with very sweet teriyaki. 

The fries were even more bland. The brown gravy had no flavor, the crack sauce only had a mild mayo flavor, and the fries had very little garlic on them.

This place is a very cool concept, but so poorly executed. I couldn't even finish my food. 

It's amazing that the burger and fries could be piled with so many toppings, yet taste so bland and unseasoned.

I was helped out by Elise who gave me a good rundown of all the menu items and gave me some personal recommendations as well. She was helpful, patient, and cute too. ;)
You can even choose a nickname for your order and they don't care if you swear. I used 'Kyouchan' because that's what my Japanese family and friends call me. Nothing funny or interesting. Just the first thing that popped into my mind.
So I ended up getting a Tamago (egg) Burger and it turned out very well. The garlic fries were tasty and I liked the dipping sauces that they provided as well. The portions were bigger than those at Shake Shack for about the same price. 
My dining experience was pretty trippy. The two TVs that were on had some old-school Sentai (??) and Ultraman (??????) episodes going on, complete with monsters crushing Tokyo city, five characters combining into one gestalt hero and the whole deal. The music playing was some 90s rap too which provided an interesting contrast. And last but not least, as I was eating, I noticed that the paper used to line the basket says ""???????"" which more or less means ""Die you fucking asshole!"" So obviously being politically polite isn't on the top of this place's priority list which is very refreshing in my opinion.

The bun nice fresh, toasted perfect, the fried egg was nice and runny (the golden sauce truly brings the whole burger together with the fried onions, and the burger sauce), the burger cooked perfect, and the best part is still finger licking messy. I went through troll of napkins. I usually get regular fries. I tried the jazz fries. I love all the stuff on top. Basically loaded fries with cheese and not sure rest but all made for awesome side of fries. 

Not just only the food but Fuku Burger it the whole experience. I know food truck to restaurant might lose some of that vibe. I was impressed really felt like hitting the food truck all over again. The people work at Fuku Burger got high energy, positive vibes, always smiling, and awesome come into restaurant place order feel that excitement. The whole ask you for name (I never had courage make something up cool) still the same. Once food done they call out whatever name you tell them. Still get jello stick when leave tip for the cooks/staff.  The simplicity of the menu six different burgers and couple sides. I enjoy because see chain restaurant with novel menus you lose sight of quality and doing food right. The food at Fuku Burger has always been on point for me. Nice is there place that can sit down instead of food truck. Another thing nice is they have few different board games that anyone can play at the restaurant. Just make sure put it back cause community board games. They play current pop music. Inside it is small but love the decor. All the asian theme from on of the television on asian station, teddy bear asian artwork, and definitely lot of asian influence. 

If want different kind of burger (they also have chicken katsu sandwich not just burgers) and cool vibe someplace chill with friends. Fuku Burger is great spot off the strip. One that plan on coming more often since on my side of town.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,7,4,epQOAEn_32bhAHqbsfBVcg

Quality: The burgers are cooked and prepared nicely along with a choice of Garlic or Jazz Fries for the side. (I suggest having napkins handy). I've not once had a burger looked sloppy or tasted under cooked.

Service: I usually stop by to eat during lunch or evening hours as service is quick and not too long of a wait. It's great to see they just started a rewards program for dining in recently but I didn't get offered that on my last dine in. (I'm not sure if they stopped?)

Pricing: I would say you do get what you pay for and that is the quality of food that is being served. Usually it's about $14 for a combo after taxes. It is a small business and they do have to make a profit versus a franchise.

Fuku is a very good restaurant. I am not the biggest fan of burgers but I would eat here anytime of week. Their jazz fries are a must have every single time.

The food isn't even the best part. Every time I've gone they play dragon ball z on the screens and it's like heaven.

It probably has to do with the fact that I've had so many bad steak experiences in high end places. Maybe it's just a bang for the buck thing. If a burger's disappointing, I'll only be out $10-$15 tops, right?

So, we start searching the web for the best burger joints in Vegas, and a lot of them that come up are kinda sketchy or, are exactly the same options I have in SoCal. Fukuburger had some decent reviews, and it looked like it'd offer up something different.

It seems like most of the stuff that would make this place stand out in terms of flavor profile just sort of get lost in the shuffle. To me, furikake adds less to the flavor of something dense and meaty like a burger patty than adding black pepper would. It just doesn't have a strong enough flavor. My tamago burger was prepared well, but it was just a standard ""fried egg on a burger"" burger.

Is that not the exact same cafeteria burger bun you remember from elementary school?) and honestly, I didn't even remember that the burger had teriyaki sauce on it until I went back and checked the menu.

Service was fine, the TVs playing youtube playlists of Power Rangers and Naruto were an interesting and unique touch, and the fries were good, and fried well. All in all, this just seems like an average joint to me. It's fine, but I'm not going out of my way to eat here. If I came back, I'd probably get the FukuMoco and the Disco fries, but my quest to find a Vegas spot that has a really good burger is still ongoing.",eiSIwHugjw9GlbqCgbER8A,0,0,3,zxOscKUrPfa7G6ll1ea2xA

The Japanese fusion burgers are awesome, and you can't get anything else like this anywhere else (that I know of, and I'm from LA). 
They combine juicy burgers with Japanese ingredients such as furikake or pickled ginger.

2880275,2016-05-02,6,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"I was always curious about Fuku Burger, but never found myself making the trek to their original food truck or their brick and mortar location on the strip. When they're Chinatown location opened up in the short-lived White Rabbit space, I had to see what the hype was about. Sometimes, I don't want a good ol' fashioned American burger. Sometimes, I'd rather have a burger that reminds me of the Amazing Aloha from Jollibee in its meat quality and sweetness factor haha. We will usually get the Kinoko (mushroom) burger or their Fuku burger (which is just a normal cheeseburger). We jazz it up with jazz fries on the side, which they pour a bunch of sauce into. Is it the most flavorful burger and fries you're ever going to have? Probably not, but there is something about it that is comforting to me. I think it's the Jollibee reminders though, since the gravy is a bit watered down too and growing up I've always dipped my Jollibee fries in the ChickenJoy gravy. 

I've read good and bad reviews from their different locations, but it's definitely a place you should try at least once. Have a nickname ready! They'll use that nickname to call our your order. One of the guys here does a particularly perfect and hilarious announcement of any name he's given. They also have two TVs, so good place to eat and catch any games. I would say the cashiers could be a bit more informative about the menu and engaging, but they're also cleaning up tables so I can see why they might not always have the time to interact. The tap water here also had a bad metallic taste, so I always bring a water bottle or order soda here.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,8,7,3,v5t9tNJqZkfiGMjIGrwTXQ
2901703,2016-11-21,0,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"Fuku Burger is probably one of my top 5 favorite burger places at this time.  The wife and I were yelping places to try while in Vegas and this one popped up because it was relatively close to our hotel, and it caught our attention immediately!  If you think the pictures of the food you are seeing look amazing, just wait until you actually take your first bite!  It is amazing.  Everything on the burger is done right, from the bun to the perfect sear of the patty, right down to the tasty sauces (holla' for that crack sauce!)

If I could, I would open up a Fuku Burger where I live.  I think this place would be insanely popular in Southern California, especially right next to UC Riverside in my hometown.  This place was so good, my wife and I ended up coming back here again during our vacation, and then we seriously considered coming back a 3rd time, but resisted the temptation.

My favorite burger was the Buta burger with bacon, cheese and pickled deliriousness on top (for real- pickled ginger was revolutionary!).  My wife's fave was the Tamago with a delicious egg and crispy onion straws on top for a classic delicious taste with the Fuku twist.  I don't want to seem like I'm begging, but I really want you to come to this place and try what I tried.  I promise you that you will not be disappointed!",0fKmCIvKlkXwBZU44D0umg,1,1,5,jXRbeClJ34uIpX467_NRuQ
2906919,2018-06-08,0,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"While staying in Vegas for a work conference, I really wanted to get out of the hotel/conference center at least once during my week-long stay. I hadn't originally planned to leave the strip, but thanks to an Internet recommendation and after confirming with my Lyft driver that I wasn't going into a neighborhood where I'd be shot or mugged, I was on my way to find out what this place was about.

The staff was more than happy to help me figure out what would be the best bet based on my tastes, but I kind of ignored the advice and went with a #1 because it was the, ""original."" Of course, I added their miso-glazed applewood smoked bacon, because bacon makes everything better. Their combo meals include garlic fries or their ""jazz"" fries and whatever drink you want, including a beer. I went with the garlic fries because I figured that after the burger, the jazz fries might be a bit heavy.

The burger was great! I actually totally devoured the thing much faster than I thought I would, but about halfway through I regretted not going with the #2 or #3 burgers as I was recommended. Not that the #1 was bad, but, as the staff indicated, it was a conservative Japanese twist on the traditional American cheeseburger. #2 and #3 get a bit more out there and I wish I would've been able to make it back for another try.

Also, crack sauce is crack.

The restaurant interior and overall vibe are super casual, kinda asian/manga, kind of video game heaven. Bright artwork everywhere, TVs on every wall showing anime, Family Guy, or ""watch me play"" sessions of video games. Very laid back, but service was incredibly quick.",01pt1brsAyL0434kGygD3w,3,1,4,E_RhmAIf1uzIFbQA3hqjOg

The main difference here is their burgers are THICK not mushed up like all the rest, I didn't need to order a 3 by3 or 4 by 4 or blah-blah-blah, it was  juice which is what they're suppose to be. I didn't know you can ask on how to cook my burger but I got one a little more than medium which was fine. 
I order the Tamago burger, the only thing I would say bad about it was the teriyaki sauce which saw sweet and hid the burger meat flavor. 
I got the combo meal with jazz fries and they were probably the best fries I've had in a long time. They came with just enough brown gravy and crack sauce. The crack sauce is awesome, I never tasted something soooo delicious before, my tongue was dancing uncontrollably, not like DJ Khaled's cause he don't go down on his woman...Lol. Maybe if he had some of this crack sauce he would.
Fuku Burger's decor was very hipster Kool and Anime Chic, they had big screens showing anime and old classic Japanese cartoons and live action shows like ultra man and speed racer. They also featured art work by local artist. I notice they also had board games too. The place is not huge in the least but I went there at around 1-2pm on a Saturday so not too busy. There was a group of 6-7 people already sitting and 2 couples who just order ahead of me. I noticed the group were waiting for there food they didn't wait too long cause the cook started calling them to pick up their food, i wondered how long they waited and how long my food would take. But to my surprise I think my order came out faster than at in&out. One surprising thing was the cashiers who was also the buser and she asked us all if we wanted refills on our drinks which she brought back to us, I give her five star service for that.
All in all I had a good experience at Fuku Burger and will came back again. I just wonder if I can custom make a burger.",ZjtukyVD3FE8FjJgdTvwog,1,0,5,liVcOFDe9BCsViJmu9RqEA

I was excited to come to an actual location I could sit on really chairs and not buckets from home depot. lol. It seems to be a good location for what they are. I was surprised to find out they have a loyalty card. It's a really cool idea to keep people coming back. I also like that they send out random text about offers or discounts on combos. The space is small but cool. They have some really dope art hanging and it they are for purchase. They have random movies/shows playing on the tv and even games you can grab and play. I like that they make it comfy. They also do the funny name thing like they do with the truck. I really like it. It gets people laughing and in a good mood. I just wish the Ronald McFuku was always on the menu. It's so bomb and delicious and donut yummm. Overall been a couple time and still impressed. They are always friendly and quick to help.

Before coming here, I have not eaten any type of burger for like 5 years. So I was influenced into breaking my determined devotion because I owed my sister. 
I honestly cannot remember which burger I got, but I definitely liked the jazz fries. They poured their famous crack sauce (no idea what it's made of) all over the thick cut fries and that was a 10/10. For the burger, I remember it being undercooked and I had a bad stomach ache afterwards.  
Oh and when you make an order, the cashier asks you what your name should be when they call your order. I asked to be called the 'Immortal Drug Lord' and that's the fun part of this establishment. 
I came again recently for free Foodie Fest tickets so I ordered a chicken Katsu burger with a side of garlic fries. It was just alright.

Yeah we've been to all the superstar chef burger joints and yes they are very very good except for Guy's burger place...but I seriously believe Fuku takes first place in burgers for all of Las Vegas.  They have a food truck too so check out where it might be while visiting Las Vegas.   

Don't forget the fries...again they hit it out of the park.  Crack sauce?!  That is a very appropriate name.  Once you taste this, your hooked and crave more instantly.

Little spot but has indoor seating, fun decor, several tv's, and music. 

They mainly offer burgers obviously but also have a hot dog on the menu. I settled for the pork burger (burger with bacon)and was very happy, 4.5 - 5 star on the burger. Fries were just okay with many over burnt pieces and too much seasoning but the burger was great. 

They didn't ask how I wanted the burger cooked but didn't mind trying it how they serve it which seemed like medium rare. Very juicy (without dripping though) and great flavors and unique toppings. 

They didn't have ice tea. Ugh. Had to spend extra for a can of coconut water which was good they had.

Now we have had burgers from BURGR, Samy's LA pastrami, Bachi burger and a couple other staples in the Vegas valley and I've got to say for the price, it's really hard to beat Fuku burger. I had the Jazz fries and the Tamago burger while my wife had the regular fuku burger plain as she is a picky eater. Let me tell you that it's difficult to find a place my wife likes with her picky food taste and with the exception of not having mustard they won her over with the quality of the food. I would put this burger up to the challenge with those above mentioned restaurants and this would still probably win and it won't necessarily hurt your wallet.

The burgers themselves are delicious. I love the Fuku Burger (their #1). As a burger lover, one issue with a lot of burgers is their monotonous, heavy feel. However, almost every burger at Fuku Burger has a pickled element, which cuts through the burger meat and fills your mouth with some added flavor.

Don't miss out on their fries. Their fries are crazy delicious. The crack sauce they come with is also pretty fantastic.

Fuku Burger also lets you choose how to cook your burger and uses nice irregular patties (unlike the perfect McDonald's circles). Overall Fuku Burger has been consistently delicious with new twists on some regular classics.",DVNPdJKMwS7-OXSYabIE9g,0,0,5,kyEoA6A6v4BdjhsQceNiEQ

I ordered the #5 KARAI (All-beef Fukupatty with pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and finished with habeñero kabayaki).  It was amazing!!  They are generous with their cream sauce.  The burger melted in my mouth. The meat tasted really fresh too. Definitely get extra napkins!

My friend and I split the decadent jazz fries, and couldn't even finish them.  The fries were addictive like crack!  Wow!  

It's their crack sauce that just makes everything better!  I think it's a mix of that Japanese mayo and sweet and sour sauce. Plus probably another ingredient or two. Wow, what a combo!",yQdzlwWSfNDwj1WUixOMHA,1,0,5,eE0nrzeLh9hprzIL76kRpg

All six types of Asian fusion burgers are all priced at $7.99 the Jazz Fries were $3.99
And the soda (with free refill) was $2.10
Staff was friendly, there are about 8 sit down tables and plenty of parking.
You have to give the person who is taking your order a Nickname for your order which they will call out when your order is ready , so be prepared. Mine was ""Squeaky"". It's all I could come up with.
The burger was good but the star of the show was the Jazz Fries.  They are garlic fries with gravy and something they called ""crack sauce "" it was so good I ended up sopping up my burger in the left over fry sauce when I was done with the fries.
If you don't want to try Asian fusion burgers , they offer one burger which looks pretty standard American style drizzled with Fuku Sauce... But the remaining five styles of Burger are DEFINATELY more Asian inspired.

The interior here reminds me of a gloomy teenager's room during his experimental phase.

Fuku's red and black color scheme makes this already small building seem even smaller and made me feel like the restaurant was cramped, even when it was not.  

The cashier was friendly and was more than willing to let us know which burgers are the most popular and that the combo is worth much more than the burgers by themselves. She was great. 

The food was unfortunately not that amazing. I ordered the #3 combo, which is the Buta Burger, I believe. The buns were very small compared to the burger patty, and my patty was too salty and a bit overcooked. I've had better.

We shared a Fukuburger with Jazz Fries, and luckily we just ordered one burger to test it out. Everything sounds and looks great, but the taste and composition of our items just didn't impress me...not a fan of whatever additional seasoning/marinade is used in the patty, and the patty has an odd firm texture to it. The bun is supposed to keep everything in between in tact, but liquid from the patty and additional ingredients were soaked up from the bottom, and it was a soggy mess. Jazz Fries were not all that jazzy...more like a generic poutine without the cheese curds and mayo instead. Um....no.

Fukuburger already has a loyal following, so I wish them nothing but the best...maybe the timing of my visit wasn't good (Team Fukuburger was catering at an Atlanta Falcons game in the ATL) so maybe quality and cosistency slipped a bit, who knows?

3722571,2017-08-11,0,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"When you add crack to the name of a sauce, that is what you get exactly. Whether you're dipping it on your garlic fries or even on your burger this stuff is legit. 
Size and seating : fairly small for your quick grab and go, but also can seat 15-20 pls max. 

Restaurant atmosphere: low key, with some art of Audrey Kawasaki and tv that features anime to Cartoon Network.

Food: the tamago: if you're looking for a burger that changes the game on what a burger should be then this is the way to go. Not only is your meat juicy, it's it constantly hydrated with a sunny side up egg that is just an amazing combination to this burger. The onions and the wasabi sauce are not too over baring and compliment each other really well. 

Garlic fries: over all good mixture and seasoning on the fries. Potatoes were fried just enough to have that crispy initial bite while getting an elegant rush of salty, garlic and furikake. I suggest having this with the crack sauce to help mellow out the salty bits. 

Conclusion: only reason I didn't fulfill all 5 stars was it's cleanliness. But in terms of food and taste it definitely hits the spot.",RLEr7Argb81hr1Tug1oDDw,1,0,4,ljxbsqEvvw6Vz3eJVdDyDw

My husband and I came in for lunch and I wasn't super hungry, so we split a combo meal - a burger with garlic fries. When it came out and I saw the fries, I told him I didn't want any of the burger. The fries were gorgeous and were cooked perfectly, but didn't have enough garlic flavor. They seemed a little overpriced, but if they had more seasoning I probably wouldn't mind. I love a well cooked fry.

The interior of the restaurant is very cute and has a well-defined aesthetic. I love that they had tvs showing a range of different things (including a gaming feed - that was cool). This place is small - don't bring a huge group. The service was fast and the servers were friendly. 

My husband told me that there was no way I was allowed to rate this place less than a four, though, because he is in love with their burgers.

For my second visit. I came here late at night. Service was alright on this visit. I ordered Katsu Burger but meat was definitely under cooked. I got to try my friend's Jazz Fries which was tasty and somewhat redeemed my inedible burger.

My most recent visit was what blew me off. I was deciding between their Kinoko Burger or Naga Dog. 

Cashier: ""I like Naga dog. It's a hot dog with kimchi, relish, seaweed, etc. It's my favorite, you will love it!""
Me: ""Ok I will get one""

Paid for it, tipped but didn't get the tip jelly which kinda sucks. My food was ready in 10 mins and while other customers were getting called by their funny nickname, the cashier just says ""YOUR NAGA DOG IS READY. NAGA DOG"" Yeah..that's fine.

Well...I did not like it. Weiner used is way too salty and overpowering that I could not taste any other flavor on this hot dog. Not to mention, it was completely burnt on both ends. Then the same cashier comes to the table

Cashier: ""How is your food?""
Me: ""Meh..it's alright. I enjoy your burger more than the hot dog. I don't think this was for me""
Cashier: ""Yeah I agree. Naga dog is just alright. It's not my favorite""

EXCUSE ME???? You told me minutes ago that it was one of your favorite item? It's also questionable that an employee is not prideful of their product. Why not do something to improve then? Get your shit together.

This location is a small restaurant with about 6 tables, so not a great location if you come with a large group of people. The menu was very simple and straightforward. I liked how all the items on the menu had a unique name and their ingredients are also unlike other burger places. So when I ordered the #6 Chicken Katsu (Crispy Chicken) I had such high hopes for it. I got the combo so it came with a medium drink and I got the garlic fries. My guest got the #2 Tamago (Egg burger) combo with a medium drink and the Jazz fries. 

As we waited for our food to come out, I tried to find a clean table, but all their empty tables were still dirty from the previous customers. I had to go up to the front and ask someone to come and please wipe off a table for us. Not sure why this hadn't been done beforehand as there were only two other groups of people eating there and all the workers were just standing around...ugh. 

Our food came out fairly quickly and it looked delicious, but unfortunately, that was the best part of it..the looks. The chicken in my sandwich was super bland and dry. It didn't taste like they put any kind of seasoning on it. Not even the sauce and the cabbage they put in the sandwich helped. On top of it being bland and dry, the crust on the chicken tasted like old oil..yuck! Sadly I wasn't able to eat much of my sandwich. The fries were really crispy and were nicely seasoned, but no garlic flavor at all!! Can't call them garlic fries if you don't make sure the garlic flavor comes out. The seasoning on it seemed more like a seasoned salt. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. Really disappointing since I paid around $12 for this combo. 

My guest was also disappointed as his burger patty was still raw!! The middle was bright pink. When he saw that, he quit eating the burger. He did mention how the taste was good, but nothing spectacular or something he'd come back for. The idea of the Jazz fries is a great one, but he didn't like the sweet crack sauce. Being our first visit here, we didn't know that the ""crack sauce"" was a sweet kind of sauce. So, if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces on fries or burgers, probably should ask to have it taken off or put on the side. 

The guy taking our order was helpful and seemed really friendly, but he along with the other employees were just eating their food right there in front of everyone! I always find it so unprofessional for employees to take their breaks and eat where the customers can see them.

This restaurant is owned by a Virginia high school classmate of mine, Colin, class of 1989.  Go RAMS!  I had been threatening to visit him at his food truck for the past ten years every time I visited Vegas, but it never happened.  Finally, on this visit the family and I made it there, ate his food, but he wasn't there.  Well, maybe next time.

The decor was casual, and they had a good selection of board games and puzzles to play if you are in the mood.  I enjoyed the posters and paintings on the walls including some anime and some local street artists.  It is in the Chinatown section of town and under ten minutes from the strip.  

The cashier, Chelsea, was very nice and told us that #2 and #3 are their most popular dishes.  It was happy hour.  We ordered a Fukuburger, Buta burger, and Tamago burger, Togarashi garlic fries, Sprite, Kirin can and Asahi draft.   The total cost for our food was $34.40, with the beers being $2.50 and $2.25, respectively.  Chelsea called out our silly nickname, ""Jasper"", when the order was ready.  Our food was ready in about ten minutes, very fast service.  

We all agreed, these were some of the best burgers we have ever had.  The fusion of Asian sauces and the egg on my Tamago Burger made for a truly wonderful combination.  It was a bit messy but I didn't care at all since it tasted so good. The patties were juicy and marinated nicely.  The fries were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the garlic wasn't overpowering but a nice hint.  We all agreed we will be visiting again.  If you are ever in Vegas make the drive to this restaurant, you WON'T be disappointed.  

See you next time Colin.  Great job on a wonderful fusion of Asian and American.",VPDl5lC-TNJCdV5OqM9JdQ,2,1,5,5b0F9t9iTcxmqWUfLX14Cg
4106894,2016-02-02,6,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"There seems to be a bit of a hate train rolling through this reviews section. While I'd agree that criticism is somewhat warranted, I still see more positives than negatives.

Fukuburger has long been one of my favorite Las Vegas food trucks, and this third shot at brick-and-mortar success is their first positioned outside of the Strip. They've taken over the former location of Fresh Cup and most recently White Rabbit. Customer traffic was steady if somewhat slow at around dinner time on a surprisingly nippy Monday night.

The menu is mostly the same as the truck's menu, although I'm not sure how often they carried all of those fries options. They also seem to offer specials every so often, as seen on their Instagram, but tonight's Kennedy didn't sound that exciting to me. The employee described it as a Katsu Burger (chicken) with mac and cheese inside. I'll try to come back when they're serving up something more intriguing.

I went for the Kinoko (Mushroom) Burger, a somewhat ill-advised choice in hindsight. I hadn't had the Tamago (Egg) Burger that recently, but I went instead with a different burger that I'd previously experienced. That said, I don't remember the mushrooms being so tough to chew. Mushrooms in burgers need to be tender, period, and these were thick but not easy to bite through.

Let's get back to the basics though. The bun was solid and held up to the onslaught of sauces both inside and out. The beef patty was a gigantic oversized portion that met the challenge of the $8 price in a brick-and-mortar context (food trucks are generally overpriced, believe it or not). It was cooked to medium, although it did seem slightly underseasoned and boring in and of itself. But you're not getting these burgers because you're a purist anyway, and the pickled ginger, teriyaki sauce, and wasabi mayo make it an enjoyable burger overall.

Also, the $4 jazz fries (served on the same tray as the burger) were pretty dynamite. While there isn't any sort of cheese in here, I'm pretty sure they're better seasoned overall than the poutine that I tried at a certain shop not too long ago. The fries were crunchy, the brown gravy was hot and rich, and the crack sauce was some mildly addictive mayo-based goodness.

The dining area is fairly small, as fans of the former inhabitants White Rabbit and Fresh Cup may know. However, they go above and beyond by offering free Wi-Fi for all, as well as power strips at the high counters for charging your devices. 

Even though I'd eaten not long before this Fukuburger visit, I definitely enjoyed my meal. Despite my own doubts, they've transitioned their truck's menu into a casual burger experience that has its own niche among other similarly priced casual burger joints.

The wait for our food was a little better, there were some board games that we could play to pass the time. Unfortunately, when our food arrived, we went to wash our hands in one of the worst bathrooms I have seen. The paper towel dispenser was either broken and empty, and the air dryer didn't work either. The floors were flooded with dirty water. The food itself tasted good, but it was very messy. We got the pork (buta) burger, the egg (tamago) burger, the mushroom burger (which I forgot the other name of), and the Jazz fries. The pork burger tasted nice, meaty. The egg burger was good, the egg made the bun soggy though. The mushroom burger was burnt, but still rather flavorful.

In addition to the mayo overload, with the exception of the katsu burger, everything was very soggy and greasy which made the texture gummy in my mouth.

2 days of car dealership haggling for in-laws deserves a  guilty pleasure so we headed south of Sahara to indulge.
The location is anime splashed with cool super hero artwork catering to a demographic mix of saggy jeans, gamers, hipsters and AnimAsians.
The menu is simple yet overpriced for a burger and extra for choice of fries & drink (medium or large).
I saw Katsu on the menu & knew it's usually dark meat but the cashier girl said it was white when I asked. I don't like dark meat but ordered it on her word as an employee who should know the menu. Fukume, it was dark meat.
The Jazz Fries with gravy & crack sauce sounded good but were not. It didn't taste close to anything like gravy...more like a strange sweet sauce. The crack sauce tasted like a spicy mayo and fries were swimming in this stuff. I couldn't eat more than a couple bites. Not what I hoped for. Gravy & fries should taste like real gravy.

First, Fuku Burger is insanely overpriced. I paid close to $30 for two burgers with sides of fries and one drink. I've had much better tasting burgers that were half the price. I'd rather go to In-N-Out than eat here, honestly. 

Second, the flavors were too overpowering. There was too much teriyaki/soy sauce based sauce dripping all over. Then there was kimchi slaw. Then there was like a spicy mayo on there. It was just too many flavors clashing with each other. Also, it was too salty. In terms of the fries, you have to pay extra for them. It doesn't come with the burger. It's just some crinkle cut fries with seasoning on them. I think I can make them from ingredients from my local Von's. 

Lastly, this place was nothing special. The interior was kind of cool and cute, but it's just a small little restaurant where you order, they call your number, and then you pick up your food.

also ordered a side of garlic fries, and the one with fuku sauce and brown gravy
they did pack these correctly in to go containers

the burgers were good, maybe a bit on pricey side, but still decent value
burgers and fries came to a bit under 40 bucks

my friends had the fukuburger and the tamago
they both said they were good, not spectacular, but pretty good burgers none the less

the garlic fries were a bit on the plain side, but the sauces that came with them fixed that
the gravy fries were good too, just not sure if I liked the fuku sauce on them in addition to brown gravy.....we finished em though!

I had the kinoko burger, and am still undecided on this one
I enjoy mushroom burgers, but not sure if the shitake mushrooms are better than a good mushroom swiss burger!  It was decent, I liked the amount of pickled red ginger on it as well. Not too much, just enough to accent the burger.

The menu is small, but so unique! My friend Mr. Y got the Chicken Katsu - Panko-encrusted chicken with shredded cabbage, finished with ""crack sauce"" and katsu sauce. This piece of chicken was huge! Probably about 9 inches long! Although this was a solid choice, we all agreed that some of the other choices were even better. 

Hubby got the Fukumoco - Steamed white rice topped with all-beef Fukupatty, fried egg, brown gravy and bonito flakes. The gravy had a nice, mild flavor. 

Ms. L and I both ordered the Buta - All-beef Fukupatty, applewood-smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled red onions and red ginger, Japanese BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. I got both sauces on the side, not knowing how crazy I'd be for them. But they were great! The BBQ was sweet and the mayo wasn't too spicy. This burger was definitely awesome!

I also got a side of Jazz Fries - Crispy garlic fries topped with brown gravy and crack sauce. That crack sauce was awesome! The gravy was nice, too. But next time I'd probably just go for the regular Fries with crack sauce. 

I can't wait to go back and try something different! Maybe that burger with crispy onion strings and teriyaki....",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,10,5,gF_1OZhbFouS4djbPNGaVQ

I originally saw this place on the strip in Vegas, but when we had planned for an upcoming trip I noticed it had closed.  Luckily there was another location just outside of West Vegas in the Chinatown district. Phew!

I'm always in charge of choosing the eateries when we visit my fiancé's family because they want me to choose places they've never been to as a nice treat. So far I've had a 100% success rate with eateries like Hash House a Go Go, Shake Shack, and BURGR so the pressure was on to impress! 

Judging by the looks of the exterior, I was a little weary. I mean clearly it was an old Taco Bell building. They didn't change anything about that.  The interior had the bones of a Taco Bell, but with an Asian anime and cartoon feel. Just like the pictures! 

We ordered and got two beers since it was happy hour.  The Jazz fries were delicious. Crack sauce (which I believe is some sort of Sriracha aoli) and gravy. Mmmm! Our burgers were cooked perfectly and my egg yolk bursted when I cut into my burger *yaasssss!!!*

Location - about 15 mins from the strip. There are other fast food joints, restaurants and boba/dessert places nearby as well as Chinatown I believe. 

Parking - lots of free parking in this shopping center. Way better than having to pay for strip parking. 

Food - I really like this small compact menu as it would be harder to pick a delicious burger then! I ordered a tamago burger, which was delicious. Add the Sriracha and it was perfect!! The egg was nice and juicy, I wish I got a money shot of it as I cut it though! :( the crispy onion pieces on top definitely added texture and flavor to the burger. 

Jazz fries - gravy with another sauce on the fries.. Reminds me of poutine fries haha. It was ok for me, I rather have had the garlic fries. The adding of Sriracha made it better.

Buta ""pork"" burger is one of their top sellers. A really nice take on a pork patty with bacon and a sweet BBQ sauce. 

Their side of fries were well seasoned and goes well with the burgers. However, it's definitely not the star of the show.

The Karai ""spicy"" burger trumps everything on the menu. The beef itself was deliciously juicy and the shredded cabbage added a nice crunchiness to the burger. Even the pickles were good! And I'm usually indifferent about pickles. The habanero kabayaki adds a hint of spice, although I could go a bit spicier. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of that burger!

Foodwise, Fükü deserves five stars but loses one for me because of the long wait for the food to cook. I mean, if you're willing to wait, which after tasting their quality food I definitely am, by all means is this place a must while in Vegas. They also have some pretty fun board games and lots of TVs with nerdy channels playing to combat the wait time. Parking is also very ample for it is located next to a strip mall. 

I will definitely be coming back (more than once) the next time I'm in Sin City as I am now a Fükü convert.",uY65mgBhjtiUrCnwqNll8A,0,0,4,C3ou2hCAMDap9lrLwtJBcQ

I have to be honest. I hate mayo or thousand island dressings on my burgers. That whole furake business is over rated according to me BUT others love the flavor. You just have To try it. To me it's nothing more than seasoning on fried chicken breast usually. Had it when I visited Hawaii. The better half said I HAD to try it. Yeah I did and that's it. It's sort of like Carl's Jr and that damn secret sauce. The secret is they they just use Thousand Island. Ta da. If you order a combo it gets pricey. You can prob go to In N Out and get the same quality burger for half the price. But if you are tired of the regular chain burger joints, support your local burger joint. Support these guys.

What brings me back is their number #2 Tamago burger. I love how thick their burgers and the juiciness and perfectly medium cooked patty. I have tried everything on their menu and their specialties. 

My favorite is their Tamago and their Loco Moco. It's just something about that fried egg that makes my meal taste great. 

Their burgers are really unique and probably my 3rd favorite is the Katsu burger. Burgers always go well with fries and I love their special ""crack"" sauce. I always ask for a couple extra on the side because it's that good.

By far this is my favorite location in Chinatown because their other mortal spots they had the parking was so far and it is always hard to get around on the strip. 

This restaurant feels I guess you can say a comfortable atmosphere and while you're waiting for your food or eating they have classic board games to play. Friends and I were playing UNO and oh this location serves alcohol! 

The servers and cooks are really cool and I've became friends with a few of them. After you order they ask for a funny nickname and it's always fun to use unique silly names so when your order is ready you will definitely know it's yours instead of a boring number.

So I was hoping that Fuku Burger would be just as good. I ordered the chicken katsu burger and jazz fries. The burger was mediocre. They use dark meat in their chicken patties, which tasted like it hadn't been marinated for very long before getting fried. But the sauces were good, it just wasn't enough to save the chicken. The fries were really good. They had special sauce all over and gravy. If I came back here, I would only order their fries so I can try all the flavors.",bb4gtMm8djK0FO50V2SgmQ,2,2,3,f5XW7KGfAb_e1OgkO4NhgA

Small, cute little restaurant. When I say small, it's pretty small. The decorations inside are pretty cool, it's like a Japanese anime setting kinda place, lol. 

Anywho, let's get to the food. So, they only have 6 burgers to choose from. I got the Fuku Bugrer #1, my boyfriend got the Buta burger #3, and my brother got the Tomago burger #2. Out of the 3 burgers we got my brothers burger was the best. He had a burger with grilled onions, a fried egg and furikake sprinkled on top. Oh my goodness, so bomb. My burger was alittle sweet and salty didn't really like it. And my boyfriend had bacon in his, which he liked. Each burger cost $7.99, but you can do a combo which has fries and a drink that adds up to $13-$14. Not bad. 

In all, it was pretty good. I don't think I could eat here on the daily, probably because when we picked up our burgers you could see how oily it was. But, it's good if you want to try something different. The way they set up the good in the tray is photo worthy, lol. I didn't for the photo honestly.

I'm hoping to come back and try other menu items because for some odd reason the smell of the joint kinda got me hooked. The Garlic fries were the right amount of chunky and crisp. I love how they packaged the sauces.

Appearance wise A+++++++ love the art that was plastered around the place. I was on a time crunch so I had my food to go. I wanted to appreciate the more of it. They had a couple of wall flat screen TVs some played anime and I think another played a Kpop music video. It was very versatile. 

Customer service was good. The cute girl at the counter reminded me of an anime character who's sweet, reserved, & just fast paced. No time to waste. I literally watched her take 5 orders in under 4 min I really don't know why I'm so impressed by that.

5186351,2017-06-29,15,5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,"As you bite through a Fuku Burger, you'll notice quite a few things:

The bun isn't a dry, lifeless ball of sprung dough simply made to act as a vehicle that a slab of beef hitches a ride with -- this is a bun that has actual flavor, and care put into it. It's airy and light, yet has just enough crisp to contribute towards the overall mouth-feel. 

The veggies are actually cold. Texturally, they've got the crunch & snap that you only get when the product is fresh. These haven't been sitting, nor have they been kept out in the hot kitchen. 

This isn't just a mayo & mustard trope-burger. Instead, you've got a nicely balanced wasabi-mayo (call it an aioli if you want) along with a bit of Fuku Sauce, which has a smoky, Asian-BBQ teriyaki inspired taste that pairs well with the mayo.

This would probably be enough to inspire a return visit. After all, it's more of an accomplishment to somehow manage screwing up a classic like the cheeseburger than it is to do it properly. Yet there's another detail that really makes the difference between ""Sure, I'll come back,"" and ""Wow, this place isn't like the others -- somehow I need an excuse to go back sooner than should be allowed ..."" 

BEEF. I can actually taste the beef. Clara Peller can stop searching; I've found the beef, and it's at Fuku Burger, where it's not just a listless, humdrum prose-protein -- here, the beef manages to shine as the bright main character despite a seriously solid, fresh ensemble cast of ingredients. The thick patties aren't gimmicks meant to satisfy your hunger well enough for you to not complain -- they're the star. ""Fuku"" means lucky, which is apt, to put it mildly. 

I could stop here. You can now go try for yourself with full confidence, knowing you won't regret it. That, however, would be a mistake. The staff certainly deserves mention, as they've been tremendously warm, friendly and helpful every single visit I've made. That illustrates itself in true fashion when (not if) you tip them, when you're rewarded with a tasty take-home treat to show their appreciation. 

Yes, it's anything but roomy inside - but they still offer board games and TV's with anime going from open 'till close; surrounded by hip, cutesy Japanese-style art adorning the walls. Bringing a large crowd here with intentions of eating in may be difficult during peak hours, and no -- there is no drive-thru. That's remedied by extended dining hours, and a meal that's certainly worth the trip, even if it's taken back home to enjoy. You'll know when your order is up, because they'll ask you for a unique nickname to call out when the time comes ... and when the time comes, you'll truly understand why it's the customer who is the ""Lucky"" one.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,37,30,5,39MdBxNZwBxTGJaa1kSqqQ

It's so different though. Not only is the food different but the environment is different as well. 
I have to say it's more of a kickback and chill kind of place. More for people who just left a party and want to just grab a bite to eat. This is the go to place for that.

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.

I. Ordering
Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Buta Burgers. It's #3: Buta burger (""Pig"" burger): Fuku patty with miso glazed apple-wood smoked bacon, American cheese, onions and pickled ginger (which we asked for on the side). Finished with Japanese BBQ sauce ($7.99). For $2 you can make it a combo with an order of garlic fries and a medium drink (they upcharge more for the jazz fries). We were not asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, but Trevor said he wanted it medium rare and the cashier said that was how their burgers are cooked. We also got togarashi Garlic fries with banana ketchup and crack sauce ($3.99 normally) and jazz fries - togarashi garlic fries with homemade, brown gravy and crack sauce (normally $4.99).

II. The burgers
The consensus was that this burger does not taste like a burger. Dennis said it tastes more like a bao. Sumana has been to Japan and she said that this burger reminded her of a lot of the burgers there. So we asked the cashier and she said that the patties are marinated (which is how a lot of places in Japan do it). The burger had a little sweetness to it and was nice and moist. However, the patty was not cooked to order properly; we ordered medium rare but it was cooked medium to medium well. It was cooked on a grill and had a nice sear, but not a ton of meat flavor. The bacon didn't really have a strong flavor and was kind of lost among the other flavors in the burger. I really liked the pickled ginger, which is not something you typically see in a burger. Maybe that's why we didn't feel like it tasted like a burger. The bun was dusted with flour and was not really gooey like I like my buns to be. It held up and did its job but didn't really stand out.

III. The fries
The fries are a little too potatoey and seemed to be single fried. The crack sauce was really good and everyone seemed to like the jazz fries more than the garlic fries.

IV. Miscellaneous
Fuku Burger is in a strip mall way off the strip. They are in a building that looks like it used to be a Taco Bell. There is plenty of parking. It is counter service. They call your order by a nickname, which is fun. Trevor got a jelly ice bar thing when he tipped. They have a cool Japanese vibe in here. They have board games to play while you wait. Their music was awesome! It was mostly 90s, early 2000s R&B. One pet peeve was that the menus are inconsistent. The descriptions of the burgers are different when you compare the menu on the wall with the printed menu. This place reminds me of the Humble Potato in LA. They have a very similar vibe and similar menus, but Humble Potato has much better fries!

V. Value
Pretty good value!

VI. The verdict
The crew had a hard time rating this because it was unlike any other burger we've had. Typically fusion burgers still taste like burgers, but these did not. I really enjoyed it, but it doesn't quite fit into the burger genre. The ratings: 3.3, 3.5, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8.

After years of not having it because they opened a restaurant at the Hawaiian Market Place and the Linq, my Husband and I finally went tonight. We have been craving it since we saw that the restaurant on Jones was opening. 

We arrived around 6:40pm and they had a total of 3 other tables. Two of which already had their food. As I was ordering 2 guys came up and stated to one of the cooks that their sodas didn't taste right. Apparently the female cashier knew and said, ""yea I know we need to change the co2.""  Um...if she knew why did she fill the cups and give them drinks? Anyhow, we didn't get our food until 7:22pm! Really, 42 minutes for 2 burgers and an order of garlic fries?! That's crazy! As I went to get our food (mind you the two cups from the 2 guys before were still on the counter, untouched) I asked what is going on with our drinks. One of the cooks said we are having trouble with the co2 and we are currently working on it. I said ok what are we going to drink since we have our food now? He gave me a blank look as the female cashier said I'll refund you the price of the drink and give you another non-fountain drink. As she was refunding me and giving me drinks (less than 2 mins) I returned to the table and started eating. Can I say really? The food was cold. Cold as if it had been sitting in the open. My burger was soggy on the bottom from the oil, the burger patty was hard as if it has been sitting out for hours and the fries? Let's not go there. I don't understand why it took so long for 1 and to be served cold food after we waited so long is beyond me. 

I have to say we won't be back. It was a waste of our time and money. Oh, it was freezing inside! It was so cold you wouldn't enjoy being there either.",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,1,1,1,OhRjNlKbpa9VRiS0ThUIsw

Had the basic Fuku-burger with the agarashi fries.  The burger was really juicy and cooked with bacon fat so pretty healthy and tasty!  The best part was the fries though.  Not really thin fries like In n Out but really crispy and hot - which was nice since it was slow.  

They also make a vegetarian burger out of egg and some veggies.  Didn't really think that qualified as vegetarian but ah well, don't ask don't tell is the way to go.  Ha.  It's tasty too.

While I missed their food truck, I was pleasantly surprised by their fun attitudes.

The burgers are great, with a lot of unique ingredients and very flavorful.  My burger had (among other things) an egg on top of it, resulting in this delightfully messy meal.  And the service was fast, providing a hot and very large order of tasty burger goodness right in front of me.  I absolutely felt full after my meal, which usually makes me want to hide out for a nap.

At the end of the meal, they gave these fun jelly treats in a little tube.  Nice little alternative to the standard mint experience.

I loved the vibe, the service, and the food.  Definitely a great place to get your unique hamburger on, and a place that I would gladly revisit again.

I liked that the menu was simple. Based on what we ate, I think it's safe to say they've mastered those handful of items and you're safe going with any of them.

I ordered the tamago burger. It was tasty. I liked the flavor profile that the sauces brought. Although there's wasabi mayo which likely added to the flavor profile but didn't seem to add spice. I did see a recent review complaining of a raw or bright pink burger. Mine was at the other end of the spectrum, definitely over done. The fries were crispy and tasty, I agree that they are not bursting in garlic flavor. I liked the crack sauce, which I think is mayo based.  

My eating partner had the chicken burger, she didn't finish it. It was also over cooked. The outside of the chicken was past golden brown to a dark brown and apparently very dry.

The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is fitting for people in my age group. There are games to play and lots of shows to watch inside.

This is my favorite item on the menu and it's been my go-to choice ever since their days as just being the truck. Their fries are also great, but I like to have my sauces on the side so the fries stay crispy! Also, if you choose to tip, the whole staff says ""tip jelly!"" out loud and you receive a fruit jelly stick as a thank you.

I was also happy to see that business wasn't too slow on the weekday night that we went for dinner. It's the perfect size. The music wasn't too loud either.

Food-wise, these burgers are the most juicy, greasy, delectable splurge that I can possibly get for those times I just want to ruin myself in the best possible way! They are a little expensive, but not so crazy that I could never stop by every now and then. 

The fresh vegetables they have in some of the burgers do make me feel responsible for my health and balance it out though. I found the tamago burger was lovely in its sweetness but just too much protein/grease overall. The karai burger is a favorite if you like spicy and I've had the mushroom and original lucky burger which are both good. I'll try the rest once I get the craving back for a good burger!

Their fries and sauces on the fries, I'm not really crazy for, but it makes a nice complement to the meal overall. 

When my burger was under cooked at my last visit they replaced it for me without any question and apologized. The replacement was cooked perfectly, not overdone or underdone, and hot and juicy! This moves me to give them 5 stars when its all said and done.

When someone in our party asked for recommendations, the cashier said she doesn't eat meat. Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Maybe I can overlook the service if the burgers are a home run.

The patty in the burger was thick and cooked well. It was juicy and flavorful. Everything else about the burger wanted me to crave In-N-Out. The sauce was underwhelming. I didn't taste much of the wasabi in the mayo. Tasted like simple mayo. What they call the Fuku Sauce was not much of a sauce.

The Jazz Fries were boring. Basically, it's a bunch of frozen fries fried then drizzled with what Fuku calls a ""crack sauce"" and some gravy. Again, the gravy and sauce didn't really make an impact to the fries other than some ""liquid"" texture. What really brought the fries downhill was it was too salty - too much of that Japanese red pepper forced me to not even finish my fries.

Seems like the staff are typically young college kids that don't take their job that seriously, but hey as long as the foods cooked well that's all I care about at a place like this.",BJt5rHl8ETUsWZmdwJnS1g,0,0,5,JMLBFn1K7eYd32upyKGuDw

I was disappointed that the #2 & #5 didn't have near as much flavor as I remember getting from the truck. They both were okay, but really needed sauce to give them flavor. The price seems a bit higher as well which I understand that being in a store vs a truck.

Update: It's great to see that the owner of a restaurant is so willing to make things right. I have to say that for me changes my mind about the whole situation. I'll have to give it another try !",hc--SIiexEJr5fWmmdZczw,0,0,4,L4bcwsnj3vOwuV77rwbbUQ

Always seem to get the Tamago or Buta when I go but have also stolen a bite of the Kinoko too!  The quality of the ingredients are the difference, everything is always fresh and flavorful.  The Jazz Fries are a must have.  Always hit Fuku whenever I'm in town!",KE_oTgna9CCkpnoymPfDEw,0,0,5,iahrhAqol1WhyAVV8fxcPQ

Since then I've stalked their truck on numerous occasion and various events. It honestly feels a little weird to be able to sit down at a table and enjoy a Fuku meal.I think that they should put a set of Home Depot buckets in the restaurant somewhere.

I can proudly say that the quality and taste is the same as you would have found on the Fuku truck that made its brand famous. 

My default order here is:
Karai (Spicy) Burger: topped cucumbers, peppers and avocado cream (I think)  
Jazzy Fries

The Lady
Tamago Burger: fuku burger with nori, fried onions and egg
Regular fries w/ crack sauce on the side. 

The burgers here have an asian flare to them but are not obnoxiously off the wall in any way that would detract from the burger or turn off the burger purist. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Bachi but t's unfair to compare Bachi to Fuku as they are very distinct and different with their creations. I think Fuku creations are delicious because of their subtleness with asian flair which results in well balanced flavors. Take for instance the wasabi mayo and the avocado cream sauces don't overpower the burger but rather accentuate the burger and its toppings. 


I know that this sounds like fancy food snob talk but it's the truth. If you don't believe me then go and try Fuku for yourself. If you don';t trust me then go Fuku yourself but add a c and subtract u. 

Eat with confidence.

I've always raved about it but always felt discouraged by finding the truck and the crowd that pools around. But finally! An actual restaurant and within my area. One that's relatively clean and decorative. Good vibes. I'm all about good vibes. 

However... I've gotta say I'm becoming more and more disappointed each time I come and sometimes it's due to lack of service and others the food tastes a little more bland. This time though two for of the four burgers were extremely undercooked. Like full on MUSHY. I'm not even sorry just because we hate well done patties but really? We were even going to overlook it by taking it home and reheating it... Until I went back to the counter. I got one of the cooks attention after a few minutes of standing there. I was asking for some boxes but I brought up one of the burger to show him how undercooked it was so he's aware. He says oh ok, and walks away. Just maybe I was looking for a little customer service and acknowledgement.. but now you have an uncertain customer with a pissed off boyfriend and an unimpressed brother. I'm just praying they don't get sick after reading another's review. 

Sorry Colin. I'm still willing to give it a shot in the future but this is probably going to be one of the last times I do.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,11,4,2,SdfMK9UAuHJ-dBunIZZ8QA

I usually gett the Karai Burger, as I love spicy foods! also tried their Jazz fries, SO mouth watering GOOD. I am surprised they didn't stay open on the strip. You can either go to the restaurant or catch the food truck occasionally down town. They also send you text specials,  It's worth tasting.",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,0,0,4,MuIku-LCE2AfsBIYy4G1Nw

I even showed them a picture of what I wanted, yet they still got it wrong. But they gave me a refund so I guess that makes up for getting the order wrong. The food was ok, not worth the hype, the burger was under cooked & the prices are too steep for the qualities food they put out. The wait time was insane as well. Interior was nice they had anime playing on the tv. I am willing to give them another chance & will definitely make sure I check my food before I leave.",eEo3SmqjLZzm6vApdOoLPw,0,0,4,gMnJ5xiJYqO4iWwcpWwt6w
