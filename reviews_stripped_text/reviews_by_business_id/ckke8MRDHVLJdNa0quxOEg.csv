169082,2016-01-31,0,ckke8MRDHVLJdNa0quxOEg,"Way overpriced for extraordinarily average food. My mom had the mushroom pasta which was $20 and was just noodles with some mushrooms, nothing special and oily. A sauce would have been a nice addition. I had the $20 chicken breasts meal, which not only were very thin and dry, but there were supposed to be 2. Instead it was one that had been butterflied to take up more surface area on the plate. The seasoning was decent. My side dishes were Spanish rice which was too salty. Also had an Israeli salad, which was basically a slaw of tomato, onions, and cucumber. I sent it back since I've been to others restaurants where I've gotten the same dish as a free garnish. I replaced it with a side Caesar salad, which was also bland. The decor is nice and the staff was friendly but it's basically boring food's attempt to get fancied up in an upscale yuppie environment.

I had purchased a Groupon and I called on Friday at 2 (which they close at 3) as it was expiring on 5/7 a Saturday (which they are not open) he answered the phone and explained my predicament.  He asked his manager and they said that I could come in on Sunday and they would still honor it at full value and they sure did!  Sweet! 
3 stars for the food
So Sunday a friend and I went for a late lunch.   We ordered three tapas to try and went with:
Drunken Avocado-not sure what but it felt like something was missing we ordered it as someone said it was like the Avocado eggrolls at Cheesecake Factory..we agreed that it did not.
Atun Tartare- Great combo with the won ton chips;  however once again it was like it was missing something...maybe some kind of sauce?
Hummus Con Carne-Meat was very flavorful and tasted great with the hummus as the hummus was very plain and the ""bean flavor"" was strong.  Pita bread was very good! Warm and fresh!
Bummer that they did not have any Baklava left.

Our second outing was horrific; very poor service from an untrained server working alone.  She did everything wrong, which reflects poorly on  management that would allow that.
Worse, the food was awful!  Overcooked chicken breast, badly seasoned, looked and tasted like burnt rubber. This was served with mashed potatoes that were clearly made from a box, and nasty onion rings that our server substituted for salad (without asking us), and matzo ball soup in a watery, tasteless broth. The matzo was a balled-up lump, a poorly made dumpling, and tasted like raw dough.
Be warned! Pricing is very high. Our meal was almost $50, after a Groupon discount. This restaurant's inconsistent food quality, and guaranteed poor service should put it on your maybe-not list. If you decide to try it anyway, good luck.",Ps1NK7rvAD7J6cIYF_liAg,3,0,1,k6dxy_0WnktzT8FyxzsQlg

1027344,2017-01-26,0,ckke8MRDHVLJdNa0quxOEg,"Over the weekend I passed by Vegas and made a point to check out Anise tapas and grill. Since they opened up I've been drooling over the pics and reviews. Over the years Vegas has had several restaurants come and go with specialized cuisines like Shalom Hunan. Now we are left with some good choices but the regular generic cuisine like Schwarma and shnitzil. Anise is shaking that up I .love, love the idea of tapas or small plates. I was not disappointed.
 We started out with the mushroom hummus plate. As good as everyone says it is. We all had the same thought  that it taste just like liver. In a very good way.The shakshuka  was on the spicy side just the way I like it. Really unique was the deep-fried  matzoh ball. Who would have thunk? Loved it! The avocado eggrolls rivaled La Gondola. That's saying a lot! Veggie lovers will absolutely go crazy over the artichoke spinach dip. Rich and creamy and delicious. The moussaka lamb sliders with Fried eggplant worked great. I think the highlight was our final tapa ,the paella. Perfectly cooked and spiceed Spanish rice with grilled chicken and lamb sausage. I could very easily have have a second plate of that. Just to make sure we didn't go hungry we got the Cobb salad which was on point. For dessert we got the most delicious pineapple cake. The cake was flavored perfectly, not too sweet with the most amazing heavenly slightly coconuty cream. Yum! Everything washed down real well with the refreshing sangria. Shout out to ponytail dude for the fantastic and friendly service. The live Spanish music really added to the atmosphere. This isn't necessarily a place to grab a quick bite although I'm sure if you call ahead you can do that as well. This seems to be more of a place to chill and have a fun evening with family and or friends. Looking for my next excuse to go to Vegas so I can come here again. -- eating Spanish cuisine at Anise Tapas & Grill.",N0mM85_DwWsZ2CRYlWS-AQ,0,1,5,QdV7GCLrB87-BscwsTY2sg

Anise Tapas and Grill definitely had the best Hummus I've eaten since my trip to the Middle East. When our server told us that the hummus was some of the best, I was skeptical only because I've tried excellent hummus at Hashem in Amman, Jordan which set the bar for me on hummus. I've also had excellent Shawarma in the Middle East, so again the bar is set high. When the plate of both worlds of hummus and shawarma were set in front of me I was excited but skeptical. When I dug in and ate it with their wonderful warm pita bread, I was quickly transferred back to the Middle East eating in an outside restaurant watching people pass by and listening to the call of prayer. It's wonderful how food can trigger beautiful moments. The Hummus topped with Shawarma is definitely a Five Star.

The restaurant is very friendly and inviting as well. I love their long wooden tables that are great for a small group of friends. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. If you aren't sure what or how to order, they will help with recommendations.

As for beverages, try the Sangarias. Holy cow, they are beautiful. Great for photo blogging and even better for drinking. They are served in Mason jars and filled with fresh fruit, then topped with more fruit. After dinner don't forget to drink their fresh mint leaf tea. So refreshing and great for the digestion.

There was a large group of us from out of state that needed kosher meals and all meals were ordered from this establishment.  The brides parents tried so hard to make this a wonderful food experience but instead of being that, it was a total disappointment.  We waited over 3 hours for the food to arrive and  when it did - the cake had been cut and the other guests were leaving.
Our hosts called many times during that time and each time received another excuse.  Anise Tapas & Grill should be ashamed of themselves for their bad service and lack of concern for others.",soezL0hECHsYwlE5vQVv7w,0,0,1,99sH7uxGVQSpLY-wqyKRaA

The plates and silverware provided weren't exactly clean, but we chose to overlook as we were hungry. We had 2 burgers and 2 steaks, 4 teas. That's it. No bread provided or offered at any time.

From the time we sat down, I felt uncomfortable it was obvious the entire restaurant was filled with regulars and we were outsiders. It took at least 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order. We ordered tapas at the same time. Another 15-20 minutes later, we got our drinks and food st same time. 

We ordered the Mediterranean Bloody Mary because it sounded interesting that it had tapenade in it. They were $16 ea and when we got them, they were just ordinary without tapenade. We told the server and she said she didn't know why the menu said that but she would bring us some olives. The olives she gave us smelled and tasted like flowery perfume.   The artichoke spinach fondue was an odd color and room temperature. Tasteless.

- The Who

Anise Tapas & Grill has a bit of an identity crisis, but if you're looking for a spot that offers up Tapas, Moroccan, Spanish, Interesting Egg Rolls, Mediterranean, and Israeli Kosher Items, then Anise may be an option for you. I didn't mind the variety, though it requires several visits to get a sense of the variety of flavors. The real identity dilemma is about the space and value. Anise offers a beautiful atmosphere that you pay for by way of over-priced items.

I had take-out from here once...felt rather underwhelmed, but was coerced back with a two-for-one offer. Altogether, I tried the following items:
Drunken Avocado Empanadillas
Duo Hummus
Atun Tartare
Moroccan Fish Tajine
Pargiot Skewer
Jambalaya Spaghetti
Truffle Wild Mushroom Pappardelle

There wasn't a lot of redemption with my 2nd visit. In fact, as I paid the bill my exact thoughts were, ""It's a good thing I'm not paying full price right now."" There was also nothing I had that would entice me to come back. To be fair, nothing was horrible either...just nothing good enough to cause me to return, even with an offer. The group I was with on the second visit enjoyed the Drunken Avocado Empanadillas the most...but again, I don't think anyone else was really impressed enough to be lured back for a return visit.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,7,3,wGxk3CGTew5guh_7yUzGuw

When we arrived, we noticed that the place was filled with a lot of Orthodox Jews wearing Yarmulkes. ...this is kind of like going to a road side cafe and having it filled with truckers or going to a Chinese Restuarant and seeing that a lot of Chinese people eat there...this speaks to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

We ordered several items and each one of these was great.
Gnocco de Pollo - Tasty little pockets of chicken goodness. (They do need to raise the price by a couple dollars and add more filling)
Great Balls of Fire - This was a twist of a traditional matzo ball, panko crusted with sriracha mayo. (Make it Spicier!!)
Duo Hummus - some of the best I've had in a restaurant. Their pita bread is a pillow of goodness.
Israeli Salad Assortment. - 8 different salads. This was the absolutely the best thing that we ordered. All different flavors and ingredients. 
Chunky Monkey Brownie and Turkish Coffee - Nice end the meal.  

I do wish they had a better beer selection. There are a number of Middle Eastern, Northern African Beers that they could carry...they should.

The waitstaff was cordial...not super friendly, not too distant.  As someone who hates a lot of chatter while eating, I appreciated this. Great job!

Still, I decided to give it a try. First and foremost, one waiter for all the tables and the restaurant is about 75% full !!! He comes over, as soon as we started ordering, he said ""wait, one moment"" and just flew to another table and then took some food from the kitchen counter to another table and THEN came back to our table to take our order. We started ordering and also asking him about some of the items on the menu that looked new to us but I wanted to try. This guy had no patience and wasn't really interested in answering much. (Why are you a waiter then???) When I asked him for pasta and marinara sauce, he said ""forget about that"". Being in the mood for pasta and marinara sauce, I asked him why, he said it is a kid menu item (not only this was on the regular menu , but there was NO kids menu on the whole menu at all!!!!!) I said, well, can you make it for an adult? Quickly he responded no. I obviously took his word and ordered something else instead. After about 10-15 minuets of waiting, I see someone at another table eating pasta and marinara sauce. When I called the waiter over to ask him, he said ""I don't know what that is, he made something for himself to eat"". Surprised at the answer, I asked, wasn't it cooked in the same restaurant and wasn't it cooked by the restaurant staff, then why is it not available for me to order, considering IT IS LISTED ON THE MENU.... IN THE PASTA SECTION, ON THE REGULAR MENU? He kept repeating that he doesn't know what the other guy is having and it was something he made for himself. Finally he ran out of answers and felt caught and finally asked the question he should have been asking all along and said ""what would you like me to do now?"" I said I would simply like to order pasta and marinara sauce. He said let me find out. 10 more minuets he came back and said, ""we can't make that"". At that point I was so mad that I got up and left and when I told him he needs to pay more attention to their negative reviews, he had the nerves to say ""you are more than welcome to never come back"" !!! who says that in the restaurant industry?? That is horrible. Unfortunately, they failed to see that in the restaurant industry, they have the upper hand. People are hungry and are voluntarily walking into a restaurant and they can turn everything into an opportunity. He could have added some more pasta to that dish, make it an adult size, increase the price and I would have still ordered it and been happy. As a matter of fact, I asked him if it can be made for an adult, I mean what was the difference anyways??? I guess the difference was that this waiter and probably the owner aren't about good business and good customer service. Otherwise, they wouldn't have so many unhappy customers. After all, what I was asking for wasn't rocket science!! Oh, one more thing...everything is very expensive. Take your business to another restaurant that is happy to have customers and will do everything to keep you happy.",W0yqSYxuaz2kBoGVZRgvgw,0,0,1,W83UQhBmu4yB8wN8QfZlyA

We tried a few new things one being the paella para mi which the rice wasn't cooked, the chicken tasted like it was 5 days old and the lamb sausage crumbles were like jerkey. We sat with empty drinks for over 45 minutes waiting for anyone to acknowledge us amongst the 5 or 6 occupied tables. Our waitress was nice but was the bar tender, the waitress, the cashier, the server..... The most disturbing thing was the elder man in a Yamaka cap that sat at the best table in the place glaring at us while he was eating, then go into the kitchen, make another plate and come back out with something else to eat, and back and forth. He ate more food in half the time we did. It took two hours for two drinks each and five tiny over expensive tapas plates.

Server with a tail (probably the manager): When we first walked into the restaurant we asked him (server with a tail) let us (two of us) sit at a table with a couch that's more comfortable. He rudely told us that it's for four people, not two. I asked him since there are only two other people at the restaurant (the restaurant could probably sit 30 people) let us at sit at more comfortable seating; he said no, because there will be more people in later. Until the end of our stay, only 4 more people came and most of the restaurant was still empty. Then, my GF asked him to replace the plate, as it had dust on it; he rudely said that it's just how the water is in Vegas, that leaves the stains on the plates. Then, when he brought water for my girlfriend, when she said thank you, he did not reply back to say welcome. 

Karmit (our female server): She was wonderful and the two stars are for her. She was attentive and talked with my girlfriend. If it wasn't because of her, we would leave the place, because the other server insulted us with his attitude. If you guys decide to go to this restaurant, request her and avoid the man with a pony tail. 

Older man with a Kippa: the older man with Kippa (Jewish head covering) greeted us shalom, Shabbat shalom, and thank you in the end. He was also nice. 

Food: the food was a little above average, however, we have eaten better Middle Eastern (Israeli food). 

Note to others: If you're looking for a Kosher restaurant in Vegas, you can try this place out. Just avoid the man with pony tail, ask for Karmit -- the charming waitress.

With that, it took 55 minutes to get our appetizers. Not exaggerating. This was two days ago. We were famished AND in a hurry. There were 15 patrons at the most in the restaurant, and what seemed to me like a decent amount of people in the kitchen. 
The food itself was just ok. Nothing bad, but nothing out-of-this-world at all. The sliders had what I think was frozen bread. My chicken was dry.

Pickled cabbages, seasoned spicy carrots, corn, potatoes, beets, Israeli salad served with fluffy pita bread.  Our tapas choices were Hummus with Shawarma, Drunken Avocado Empanadillas with tequila jalapeno agave sauce, Cigarro Marroqui with tahini sauce, and Spanish rice (paella).

Just looking at the arrangement of these plates spread across the table was appetizing.  The rainbow of colors, the charade of flavors, the amount of food already without a main course was eye buldging!  You gotta come here hungry for sure.

I'd definitely order the Hummus with Shawarma, Drunken Avocado Empanadillas with tequila jalapeno agave sauce, and Spanish rice again!  

Hold on... there's MORE FOOD hahaaa :D

Mashed potatoes came in a small bowl, seemed like it was baked.  I liked the hint of garlic flavor in it.  Those Chicken & Beef skewers with grilled seasoned vegetables though... Mmmm mmmm the chicken gets my favor.  Gotta try it with the spicy crushed jalapeno sauce.  I'd eat that sauce with everything!

The highlight main course was their Sea Bass over steamed rice and bokchoy.  Presentation is important here.  I wouldn't wanna mess up the artistic display.  But gotta dig in - we ordered it...  At this point we are stuffed.  If there had been appetite left I think I would've enjoyed the Sea Bass more with the spicy crushed jalapeno sauce.

To help us digest we were offered fresh mint hot tea!  You guys, there's a halo over it (angels singing in harmony).  This was soooo fantastic - soothing, comforting, relaxing, aromatherapy and really simple.  Fresh mint and hot water!  Have it after any meal.

Not done readers... The tea was meant to make room for dessert :D.  You won't wanna miss this.  My personal recommendation is have dessert first!  Pina colada dessert: cake with caramelized pineapple and toasted coconut bits with whipped cream served in a martini glass.  Let the picture tell you a story.

Ordered a few tapas selections and a main that my waitress remarked as her favorites for this visit: Dark meat Buffalo chicken taco, blackened fish tacos, housemade hummus with sauteed mushrooms, fried avocado empanadas, lamb slider with Moroccan spices and a seared salmon with pomegranate sauce, sauteed mini sweet peppers and mashed potatoes.

Service was warm and attentive without being obtrusive. Most of what I ordered was a solid good but nothing quite stood out as phenomenal. My faves for the early evening meal were the hummus: creamy, flavorful and the sauteed mushrooms were a beautiful contrast; lamb sliders: juicy mini burgers topped with a gently breaded and fried Japanese eggplant, and Buffalo chicken tacos: they had a really nice spicy kick to them!!

First up the waiter brought us crackers and this addicting onion sauce/jam/oil thing that I couldn't stop eating. 

Checked in on Yelp and got complementary sangria that was pretty good, maybe a touch too sweet but hey it's free. 

Drunken Avocado empandillas-reminds me of cheesecake factory's avocado eggs rolls. Comes with a delicious sauce, just wish there was more of it. Especially liked the little salad served on the side. Tons of avocado, if you like avocado this is for you. 

Paella para mi-holy YUM. Could not stop eating this delicious, paella with lamb sausage and mild heat. 

Shish kabob with Isreali salad and jasmine rice-the meat was soooo good. Tender and juicy and perfect. The Isreali salad was a standard but done correctly. Rice was delicious as well.

3275504,2016-11-09,0,ckke8MRDHVLJdNa0quxOEg,"Went for dinner using a GroupOn, and my expectations were moderately high because of ratings and comments of this place. We won't be returning again when there are other options (and I'm not restricted to a Kosher menu). Their management needs to step up if they want to draw in and keep new clientele.

I need to point out the inexperienced waitstaff who also broke a health code: A waitress was picking her teeth with her hand behind the bar before making a drink. She was *completely unaware* that this would not be okay, and she's doing this in plain sight of the dining room. We had just sat down and the only reason why we didn't leave right at that moment was because we were starving. My BF, a former GM of fine dining restaurants, pointed out she also wasn't wearing any socks -- not something patrons want to see. She was one of two waitresses working the restaurant that evening, and while both were tremendously difficult to flag down considering we were just one of three tables being occupied, this particular waitress looked completely disinterested in LIFE and making a guest experience reasonably nice. They didn't grasp the timing of coming by to check up on us, even from the very moment we sat down (it took us four minutes to get two glasses of water, and we had to ask for it).

Our first dish came out cold on the inside (the spinach fondue, which was a fancy name for a simple spinach-artichoke dip). They had also given us a meager-looking portion of chips to dip in; when we asked for more near the beginning, the waitress went to check and found out they had run out of chips. Shouldn't they have addressed this from the beginning? They took it back to make sure it was properly heated. The evening wore on, and our waitress (not the teeth-picking one) was increasingly becoming more apologetic in her demeanor, perhaps anticipating that we would find some dishes she brought would be unsatisfactory. 

Someone commenting further below said that this restaurant menu has an identity crisis. I agree. From potato bravas to lamb sliders (I enjoyed them) to fish tagine to avocado egg rolls (they also made up some fancy name for it -- they are very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory avocado egg rolls), the menu is strangely diverse.

The decor was interesting -- it's dimly lit, romantic in some nature, except they didn't have highboys for two -- we were seated at a four-top (the waitress first tried seating us at an eight-top at the entryway, to which I raised an eyebrow...).

The food was okay but nothing to write home about... which is a disappointment, because I really thought it had an interesting menu and close enough to my home to support it semi-regularly. With all the other great dining options around Las Vegas, I would be hard-pressed to ever return here again.",ORI1UqfFXsNnk8KzmYK5bQ,6,0,2,1VwJvarBZmFrGSRYfo5NiA

I came for a late lunch and was immediately seated.  The restaurant has a lot to offer in terms of specialties, from Israeli to Mediterranean.  I decided to just try a couple tapas and not order an entree.

I ordered the matbucha and the tuna tartare.  The matbucha tasted like a very fresh tomato sauce, but it came with an egg on top and with some fresh, delicious bread for dipping.  The tuna tartare was accompanied with avocados and a wasabi sauce, as well as some pita chips.  It was all delicious and unique for the area.  Those two put together came in at $20.

Their beer list was limited and the bar area itself was very small, but this is a nice, intimate place that would be perfect for a nice meal out that would not break the bank.  I personally would never had known this restaurant existed if not for reviews.  I probably would not tell you this is a must-do destination if you're staying on the strip, but if you live in the area or happen to be on the westside, I recommend you stop in a for a bite.

After 10 minutes I just took one from the front counter because I was being totally ignored by the manager and employee who were chatting on their phones. 
I finally walked to the back to place my order and was told I would HAVE TO WAIT For Their waiter to show up for work before I could order!!! I said I know what I want to order and THEY REFUSED TO TAKE MY ORDER!!
I was the only customer in the place and the cook was standing in the window doing nothing!! What kind of restaurant ignores their customers and refuses to take their order because the waiter was late for work???
I left after telling the manager that they obviously dont care about their customers and why didnt they tell me they were not serving food instead of ignoring me??

Occupying a space that used to house the coffee shop Something's Brewing, it looks like they've inherited some of their high top tables. The modern decor was a bonus too. Unfortunately, the execution of their dishes was sorely lacking.

The meal starting on a high note with complimentary lavash. From there, it all went downhill. Fresh out of the fryer, Drunken avocado empanadillas ($12) proved to be excessively oily, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. Also oily were the chips accompanying the Atun tartare ($12). Average frozen tuna, some of it stringy with sinew running throughout, formed the bulk of the dish along with avocado, an egg yolk, pickled ginger and black sesame. Ending the meal was a beautiful, hefty portion of truffle wild mushroom pappardelle ($20). Unfortunately, it too was rather oily.

Cigarro Marroqui $9 consists of four crispy fried phyllo dough ""cigars"" filled with what they call sinfully and savory spiced Moroccan lamb and Angus beef. This was so-so, I am not jumping up and down for it.

Wings Anise$12 which is crispy chicken wings in a sweet chili glaze. It was ok.

Once i got to the thicker part of the salmon, it wasnt cooked all the way through. So it was like clear and watery which grossed me out. My bf liked the spanish rice that came with his meal.

We felt uncomfortable from the beginning .The waitress gave us a look when she saw we brought our baby. 

FIRST; we sat at the end table, the sofa was dirty; had crumbs all over plus it sinks in ( I'm amazed that by reading other reviews from months ago they pointed the same about the crumbs in the sofa). So we moved to a table and the chairs had crumbs as well, silverware cleanness was questionable. 

SECOND; food was flat, nothing stands out, very small for the price; if food would be great I wouldn't mind, but was not the case. Is not terrible but it doesn't worth the money. The best was the pitta bread..:s

THIRD; the service, waitress was nice but she barely acknowledged us. She never stop by to asked if we need anything else; She didn't even refill our drinks I had to asked her. And place was empty.

And then the WORST happened; while asking for a refill the manager approached to our table directing himself to her speaking Hebrew (I'm thinking) in a strong loud tone pointing fingers at what I thought was my drink. At first I thought he was probably pointing her that my drink was empty. So I thought ok she's slow but you don't have to yell at her. 
Oh my! What was my surprise when she asked me if my baby food had diary on it ; WHAT? It has not, and I had to say it twice, although I didn't understand the question. Then she explained to me that diary is not allowed on the table.(some culture reasons) Then we understood why he was looking at us from his table all the time. We felt terrible! We didn't even finish the rest of their flat food and asked the check. 
She took literally like 15min, I could saw her all the time. She did, who knows what in the computer, went to the bar, attended a just sat customers, went to the kitchen and then she brought the check.

This is a kosher Jewish Restaurant. We obviously don't belong here. We're very respectful with other cultures but I have no knowledge of theirs, neither that this restaurant was very firm about it. You might think that's something they should point out at their website or at least have a sign at the door. Plus there's ways to say this things. He should told the waitress alone about my baby food doubts and have her asking us that, not to come to our table shouting in other language. We're customers and we deserve respect. Plus, I think it was pretty obvious that we were not Jewish. 

Lastly, while waiting for the check a Jewish person walked in and started checking the blood pressure of a kitchen worker, at the back table. kinda like a consultation?...Pretty strange.

So I'm giving it 2 because the food is not great but not horrible, plus atmosphere is nice; modern look deco. But If you're not Jewish, stayed away.

Sadly, on the day I could make it to the restaurant, the chef was late to work that day and there was no lunch service when my guest arrived.  So, she called me and we made alternative plans after the Lady told her she had no idea when the chef was coming in or if the chef was even coming to work.   So after our lunch at another restaurant, I went back to Anise because my Groupon was expiring and this place is a bit far from my house.  I walk in and there's one couple eating and the Lady tells me the chef did come in.  I asked if they would do me a favor and extend this Groupon so I could come back and properly try their restaurant.  ""NO"", she said not even considering it for a second.  And then she lies to me about what she said to my guest and makes it sound like she knew the chef was going to show up and that was not true (I double checked my guest's story immediately) and offers me zero customer service or consideration.  The funny part is a guy who might of been the owner and a kitchen worker are sitting 15' away during this discussion and offer no support or interest in my dilemma.   So, I walked out, refunded my Groupon and bought something else.   

this may sound like sour grapes and probably is.....but where I come from Customer Service counts as much as the food and I've erased Anise from my mind forever.

Then, since we were seated across their kitchen entrance with the curtain, we then hear employees yelling at each other and everytime someone goes inside and curtain or panels opened up, there's a distinct smell of rotten or old food or something. I again looked around and my friend and I noticed the wall by our table is dusty dirty then came the angry server again and asked for our order while coughing in front of our faces! That was it! I said it's okay we'll just pay for our drinks! Oh well my hot mint tea never came so it's just my friend's zero coke in can that she never opened. Server came with the bill and it's $4.65! Wow!

3973267,2016-05-30,7,ckke8MRDHVLJdNa0quxOEg,"I had a Groupon for Anise and came a few days before it was to expire and used it.  I'm glad that I did go.  It was a very pleasant dinner.

I was brought an iced tea as I was reading the menu.  Being a lone diner in a tapas place can be problematic but my server was good at letting me know if I'd be overdoing anything with my order.

I ordered the Drunken avocado Empanadillas for a starter and shawarma for the main course.  There were two sides and from the list the server said, I chose the grilled vegetables and Spanish rice.  For dessert, I got their key lime dessert--key lime served in a champagne glass with pastry crumbs in the bottom of the glass.

I enjoyed the lea very much.  The drunken avocado is such a simple yet creative idea.  There could be a bit more jalapeño sauce but I enjoyed the soft avocado against the crispy wrapping.  An avocado spring roll as it were.

The shawarma was very nicely seasoned and tasty.  The sides were good.   The Spanish rice was OK--rice isn't one of my go to sides--but the grilled vegetables were excellent.  A mixture of sliced yellow and green squash, some onions, and some red and yellow peppers.  I didn't realize until I got home that even though I was told it was one of the sides from which I had a choice of two, there was a $2 surcharge on the bill for the vegetables.

There is a chalkboard near the podium when you walk in that has desserts listed.  There were only two and the server went to make sure of what they had.  I got the key lime dessert and it was quite good.

I enjoyed my meal and the service.  My iced tea was always full.  Service was excellent! 

This was something completely new for me and a good find thanks to Groupon.  It's a bit pricey without the Groupon.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,22,11,4,FDmcucuGXzDfQOj3xq0p-Q

It took 15-20 minutes for anyone to come by and take our drink ordersI had a coupon from Yelp that I wanted to use for a free sangria. I mentioned it to the waiter, and he seemed really annoyed by it, but wrote it down. We had never been here before, but the waiter didn't offer to explain how any of the menu worked. We were familiar with tapas, so the serving sizes didn't surprise us, but the prices were outrageous for what you get. The food was bland and nothing special at all. I can say that the sangria was really good, but at $12 a glass I'm glad I got a free one. After we finished eating it took another 20 minutes to get our check.

I recently dined at Anise Tapas with fellow yelpers. I arrived at the restaurant early and headed to the bar for a glass of wine. What a cozy little gem Anise Tapas is - the inside was dimly lit and flooded with scents of yummy spices. Rodem greeted me right after I took a seat at the bar and provided a drink menu. He cleared off the bar area and took my order (Cabernet) and engaged in friendly conversation, noting that he personally enjoyed the Cab I went with as it was a lighter Cab. The pour was quite gracious and it tasted delightful!

Once the rest of our party arrived we were seated at a table. Menus, waters, and sangria quickly made their way to our table. Rodem took care of us and we were impressed by how knowledgeable he was about the menu and took advantage of his tasty recommendations. Jameson the GM stopped by to welcome us as well which was a wonderful touch and only added to our enjoyable dining experience.

Where to start... The Red Sangria! Filled and garnished with various fresh fruit and maraschino cherries - it tasted heavenly. It went perfectly with our mini feast. 

We ordered a variety of Mediterranean salads which was one of my favorite parts of our meal. An assortment of pickled veggies, two types of cabbage salad, beat salad, marinated carrots and potatoes, corn salad, and Israeli salad (chopped cucumber and tomato in light vinaigrette). These small cold dishes are like the banchan (Korean side dishes) of the Mediterranean world! 

My absolute favorite was the Hummus Con Carne which is a must try. Delictable hummus surrounding a heaping pile of freshly made shawarma. I could eat this all day and it would never get old. Our salads came with amazing warm pita bread that we quickly demolished with the hummus. If I had to recommend one dish to anyone dining at Anise Tapas, I would definitely go with the hummus + shawarma!

We also tried some drunken avocado empanadas (bite size egg rolls filled with avocado) cigarro marroqui (small deep fried rolls with flavorful beef and lamb), beef and chicken skewers, paella, mashed potatoes, and grilled veggies. All were wonderfully seasoned and tasty all around.

At the end of our meal we were served hot water with fresh mint leaves (a delightful yet simple combo) and a delicious Pina Colada dessert to share. I was stuffed but has to try a bite of this fluffy cake layered with caramelized pineapple, shaved coconut, and whipped creamy goodness. The perfect end to our scrumptious meal.

What a wonderful overall experience. From the excellent service, flavorful dishes, to the intimate and cozy ambiance - this would be a great spot to dine with close friends, family, or a special date!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,12,13,5,RVmQcyEtFwyp66grlEEXbQ

I absolutely can't say enough about the Israeli Salad Assortment, it is my favorite the variety and flavor of each element is spectacular and I really ADORE the pita bread, so soft, fresh, and delicious..... I need an extra order of bread!
The Drunken Avocado Empanadillas are another excellent appetizer. The  egg rolls are filled with avocados and cilantro, and served with Patron jalapeño agave sauce..... Yum!!!!

Some of my favorites are: The Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce.... the flavors are sooooo fresh and amazing! I am looking forward to some of their other pasta dishes, based on how great this one is. They have what is called: Simplemente Pasta. You get your choice of of bow tie, cappelletti, or spaghetti pastas to be tossed with olive oil or marinara. I am kind of a spaghetti and marinara connoisseur..... this one is really good!!!!

My husband loved the House Angus Burger.  The home made thick cut french fries are crazy good!!!! I felt kinda bad, as I kept eating off his plate.....  one after the other of the fries...... really good!!!!

The Shawarma, which is, dark meat chicken and lamb shaved off a rotating spit. It was so flavorful, juicy and delicious.... (this is also were that extra pita bread comes in handy!)

4822132,2016-01-06,0,ckke8MRDHVLJdNa0quxOEg,"Took the family of four to try this place on a Groupon.  It wasn't much of a Groupon as I expected to pay about $100 because I know how we usually eat at any tapas type of restaurant.  Nevertheless we arrive...

The only reason that we tried this place was because of all the 5 star reviews here.  It is very much out of our way, and we do have our favorite tapas places already.

Upon arriving, I try a glass door that appears to go into the restaurant, but is locked.  A guy, who is sitting on the ground, blocking the sidewalk points out another door and says, ""The entrance is here.""  After excusing my family so that we can pass, we enter.

We are seated by a female server/hostess (as all the servers seem to greet and seat people as they walk in.)  She sits us, and says that someone will be with us.  Well guess who is our server?  The guy that was taking a break, blocking the sidewalk.  I don't know his name because he never introduced himself to us.  He never asked if we had been there before, nor did it seem he cared anyway.  He did take our drink order and brought us some lavash (which I seemed to enjoy the best.)  I asked the server if they had a menu with bigger printing as I was having a hard time reading the 6pt font on a glossy brown menu with the lights on it.  Of course they did not, BUT at no time did the server suggest anything on the menu.

Unusually, my family did not have any tapas and opted for a salad (Nicoise $19 worth $12), House Angus Burger $16 ($10 burger at best); and Pastrami Burger $19 ($12 at best.)  I, on the other hand, had Moussaka Sliders - $13 (said to be spicy, but wasn't), Cigarro Marroqui - $9 (a bland blend of lamb and beef rolled like a taquito), Falafel $8 (little too well done, ok on the taste), Atun Tartare - $12 (tuna chucks, avocado, sesame seed, ginger), and the Moroccan Frena Pan - $8 (soft, tasty, sweet bread with 4 toppings.)

Much of the taste was bland.  It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't to die for either.  If I lived right next door, I would give it another shot.  But due to the distance, I would probably not go back.  As for the rest of my family, I'm sorry, but it was a thumbs down for all (including the salad.)

Upon entering our first impression was small but had a nice crowd. We were never greeted at the hostess stand so we proceeded to the bar where only 1 patron was sitting. Some seats were empty with dirty dishes but their check was paid and they were gone. We sat at the end of the bar along the wall to allow space for cleaning of the dirty dishes but they just sat there. We helped ourselves to pushing over used water glasses and grabbed menues. 

Now being in the service industry we're laid back and easy going but this is the 2nd/3rd time we've walked out of a restaurant w/o ordering our food in 8 years. We sat there long enough to study the whole menu and prepare our questions. No one greeted us. No bartender, no server. I walked up to the kitchen window where a server was speaking to the kitchen staff and asked if there was bar service. She said yes but after that was very mumble jumble and I had no clue what she said. This server had long hair half shaved. She immediately approached to take our order and we threw in a couple of apps. Seconds later after the girl spoke with I guess our original bartender/server, he came up and said ""How can I help you""? We looked confused and I told him we already order with the waitress and he said, ""yes we're out of the items you order and it's her fault for not telling you"". At that point our first experience that lasted 15 minutes was very bitter and poorly displayed the lack of management, owners operation and customer service so we chose to take our business elsewhere.

We were seated immediately and greeted with sangrias too pretty to drink, which is free with your yelp check in by the way. Score! Jameson the General Manager who moonlights as a photographer welcomed us and indulged our frenzy in taking photos of the picture perfect sangrias. Then we were introduced to Rodem our charming waiter who was spitting suggestions like rhymes, very poetic! hahaha. I have to say he didn't disappoint and made sure we were steered in the right direction. I think if he had his way he would've made us try every single plate they offered lol.

There were definitely a lot of highlights, the food itself was very flavorful and delicious! I couldn't get over how everything had its unique taste that stood out in every bite. Take the assortment of Israeli salads for example, BEETS! who would've thought they could make beets taste so good? certainly not I! The best bite of the night was definitely the hummus with Chicken Shawarma and pita bread, a unanimous consensus amongst us. It made my senses dance with glee, so much so that I ordered one to go for lunch the next day. And I got tips from Rodem on how to properly heat my pita for optimum taste. 

 Another must try is the Avocado empanadillas, more egg roll looking but don't let that fool you. Nothing ordinary about this appetizer, served with Patron jalapeno agave sauce. By the time we were done with the salads and apps we were content but alas we still had the daunting task of picking the entrees. Once again we let our trusted caretaker work his magic and minutes later appeared Angus beef and chicken shish kebabs, and Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. The latter dish was presented beautifully and perfectly crisp just the way this Asian girl likes it!

Our night surely didn't end there, when we thought we were done here came Rodem again with his trusty wand and whipped up some dessert for us to share. But before that, we were served with hot water with Mint leaves. I don't know if it's customary for them to serve that but it was such a welcomed treat in between. Very aromatic and soothing, huh who would've thought right? Lol it was kinda funny how we all marveled at such a simple but satisfying concept. So on to the dessert, another beautiful masterpiece. Pina Colada dessert, chunks of cake with caramelized pineapple in the middle. Layered with cream and toasted coconut, OMG trust, just get it!      

It was definitely a successful long overdue night out with my girls. Cheers to friends and more savage dinners to come hahaha. Looking forward to future visits of this new found gem!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,11,10,5,wKYKdZnTVouJUKvUdIjzyg

How can you have an offer for a free sangria when You check in and then say you can only use it for 1 person per table...when no where does it state that you cannot have more than one per table....and to finish it off when I show my Groupon (which is the only reason I decided to visit this restaurant) they told me because I used the check-in for the sangria on Yelp, I couldn't use my Groupon. How?!? They two different offers and from two different places. NO WHERE DOES IT STATE THAT YOU CANNOT USE ANOTHER VOUCHER. The only good thing about this place is the food, the waiter was extremely nice, but the owner is the one who made things difficult even though it was his fault that he didn't clarify his ""offers"".

Had appetizer of Atun Tartare very good. It actually whetted my appetite, while most places' appetizers just fill you up. Tower of ponzu-marinated tuna layered with avocado, firm yolk, pickled ginger, and a sprinkle of black sesame, wonton crisps and wasabi aioli. Chilled tuna was slightly under seasoned, would have been more appropriate at room temp like sushi but still unusual and good.

I was in mood for cave-man entree instead of little plates, so I got the Ultimate Angus Burger. Well seasoned patty with fried egg, pastrami, onion rings and other garnish and punchy sriracha mayo on a brioche bun. Came with excellent thick skin-on well done steak fries that stayed crispy outside and fluffy inside. 

Overall, I highly recommend AniseTapas.com for a kosher meal in Las Vegas. Great food, hip ambiance, Spanish tapas bar decor and music. Friendly staff makes intelligent recommendations. Would definitely come again!",H9WQWLQYfXqSIawN4uis_Q,0,0,4,yhvs_JPjKKo1adFx77ocCA

The food was great, out of 20 dishes ordered between our group over two days only one thing was not incredible and even that was pretty good. Service was fast and compared to any other kosher restaurant in town the prices were good. It's a unique atmosphere, clean and does not feel like a kosher restaurant the food allows you to feel like you're not missing anything while in Vegas and it's not too far from the strip.
We ordered Kobe beef two days in a row it was so good, everything else was really well & prepared well presented. 
In reading the reviews below it seems that some people were not prepared for kosher prices, but comparing this to even a restaurant in a small town their prices are not bad. As far as service, I can't speak to that but we had two different servers as well as dealing with the owner and all were very accommodating so maybe they have improved service recently",2HEBQJacQgPWN_Z8xaoWpg,1,1,5,p2NqZ26x-lKdadjZngT-Rg

I drove approx. 40 min to try this place and OMG what a let down!!! So lets start with the service got seated right  yeah. :) seemed promising, they have live entertainment lots of fun but then we waited and waited and waited it was like we were invisible. We had to wait 30 min. to have anyone acknowledge us to get our drink or food order. While the food came quickly the portions are super small which I am aware it is tapas but some items you could not even share between 2 people it only came with 1 small item on the plate. The food was decent for which I would give it 3 stars. Our waiter after he dropped off the food never came back It was like we were stranded. He never returned to refill our drinks or water or ask if wanted further cocktails, we never had the opportunity to order more tapas, I guess they don't need my money. After 2.5 hours at this place and no more food or drinks or service of any kind I was finally able to flag down our waiter and request our bill which was brought promptly but then another 30 min of no show from our waiter, I just left my group on with the cash and walked out. We were all very disappointed and despite the decent flavor of the food itself the severe lack of service or care about their costumers needs I will never return. I choose to spend my hard earned money elsewhere where they care about their customers and their needs and are attentive. I am not sure how this owner keeps his doors open I could of easily spent 2.5 times tonight what our actual bill ended up being had the  waiter just returned to see if we wanted to order any more food or drinks. Sadly We left and went to another bar and ordered more food and drinks at a place that knows how to treat there customers.  This place has potential but needs a complete over hall with their customer service and wait staff. Its absolutely horrific!!!!!

Now for the not so good parts. They take a while for the food to come out and the prices are crazy. I know Kosher is more expensive than a regular place but this might be pushing it. 

Although the price is high, usually they compensation with large dishes and that is not the case. The dishes are a bit small and too expensive. 

BUT the best part is the taste. It's really good. Fresh and tasty.    That's why this is a hard review.

As a party of four from out of state, we ordered four tapas and one pasta dish (which came out last and was incorrect). However, the servers were much more concerned with other patrons - one large table was waited on by all four servers despite having already gotten food by the time we came in. Even though our table was in the middle of the restaurant, we did not get water refills or check-ins. We wanted to order more tapas but decided against it after being completely ignored, while other tables of regulars were waited on hand and foot.

When he tried to seat us he tried to seat us at the table right next to the door. We asked to be further away and he said ""no worries. Look over the menu while we get the table ready for you."" 
Then, 8 minutes later, he clears the next table over for us. Literally just as close to the door. 
When we asked to be at the table that was being cleared off much further from the cold door, he shot back ""I rushed to clear that table off for you! But ok fine."" In the most rude manner. 

All while chit chatting casually with another customer. 

He made us feel completely unwelcome, and totally uncomfortable. Sorry we may not have been dressed tzuit, or spoke 100% Hebrew, but we are paying customers and that is no way to treat a paying customer.

We were there and it was empty, so we got our food quickly which was great. But we ordered appetizers and mains, and the mains came out 2-3 minutes after the apps. I wish that they would have taken more time to bring out the mains, because we were still enjoying our appetizers. We ended up going back and forth between the main and apps because we didn't want the main to get cold, which was a little uncomfortable because everything was on different plates so there were a lot of arm stretches to get to all of the food that was brought out. 
I ordered the mushroom pappardelle, which was underwhelming. I couldn't really taste the truffle infusion in the oil.

The same server refused to take order of a regular food on menu claiming it was for kids but it was so obvious that because it was less expensive than other foods and no, it was not in kids menu.  Overall they need to do something about this guy or they keep losing business.

We decided to leave after wasting 30 minutes sitting on the chair dealing with a very bad attitude dishonest guy.
