That being said, this place is the bomb.com.  They put out delicious, authentic PuertoRican food in plentiful portions at a good price.  
We had a mofongo with crackling in it.  The side broth was not as flavorful as it should be but it was good enough.  We also ordered an alcapurria and an empanada.  I loved the empanada.  The alcapurria was made with yuca and I prefer them with masa (green banana masa not the corn masa).  But they were craftily made for what they were.  We ordered the chicken breast with saut√©ed onions with arroz con gandules.  Excellent. Fresh and delicious--and the chicken was tender enough to cut with a plastic fork.  The rice was nicely seasoned and fluffy.  I hate sticky rice.  
The service was super friendly and accommodating.  This is a place you want to stop by when you are in Las Vegas.  It is on the northern part of the strip near the Stratosphere Hotel.  They have extended hours too.  
Don't miss out on this great food for little money.  They have been open for only 10 months so this is a place that needs your patronage to keep open.",ahwwAXJ_qwGmuRjTOHHMWg,5,1,5,eNqJiXF3TjB6473FGM2GHw

4039903,2018-06-09,0,RrKvj24rmHndsO8A19lTyQ,"I've never tried Puerto Rican food, but I do know good food when I taste it! 

Puerto Rico Express is a little ""stand"" outside of Dino's on LVBLVD. Viva Arepas and The Goodwich both used to occupy this small space, so they have tough shoes to fill.

I've never had Puerto Rican food but I found they use a lot of garlic and the flavors are very subtle and savory- not too much spiciness or acid.

The main parts of the menu are sandwiches and then a meat plate- there's about 8 choices on both sides. I was most interested in their plate entrees because I like rice and beans. They have chicken, steak, shrimp, and pork chops. Each entree plate comes with traditional rice and beans or you can upgrade for two dollars and get mofongo which is mashed plantains with chicharon or fried pork skin. Although I'm a rice and beans guy I went for a steak with grilled onions plate and a mofongo upgrade. I also tried their empanada with spicy garlic sauce and a pineapple soda.

4107014,2017-06-09,2,RrKvj24rmHndsO8A19lTyQ,"I'm still in the middle of recovering from and reviewing a road trip involving massive amounts of food, but when one of my best friends invited me to dinner tonight, I couldn't resist. The deliciousness of the food made it even better.

Puerto Rico Express is the latest occupant of the shack on Wyoming and Las Vegas Blvd. I've had so many great experiences eating at this place, mostly during the fabled run of the Goodwich that culminated in their subsequent relocation to a true brick-and-mortar not too far up the road, and the ghosts of past meals loomed mightily as I parked in the familiar tiny Dino's-adjacent lot.

As with the past occupants, there is one window for order and pickup. The metal stools are still here too. The kitchen space is still mostly if not all flattop grills. The counter space for those who would dare to eat outside in the desert heat have been slightly expanded. For the most part, it's a familiar sight if you've been here before.

The menu comes in both English and Spanish, and it is surprisingly vast, with five sandwiches, eight ""specials"" (served with a side of some sort of rice, or a +$2 premium substitution of mofongo and chicken broth), various sides, and even a couple of desserts. I was initially going to share some chicken dishes with my friend, but I got pretty involved into my own order and let those go. He seemed to like them though.

Here's what I had:

Empanadilla Carne / Beef Empanadilla ($2): the best bite of the meal was my first. Crunchy shell around a misleadingly small yet ridiculous pocket full of ground beef and juices. You can't not like this unless you somehow hate beef in general.

Mofongo ($4.95): my first taste of this dish which is almost interchangeably associated with Puerto Rican cuisine. Green plantains were mashed into a consistency that's soft, not mushy or chewy. Pork cracklings aren't crunchy but I'm sure lent flavor. Fresh garlic topping was kinda insane. Wish it'd simply been crushed and mixed into the rest of the mofongo. This came with a piping hot chicken broth that simply added richness.

Sandwich de Bistec / Steak Sandwich ($6.95): this hefty sandwich is highly reminiscent of a steak torta. The beef is tender and the bread is crunchy from the flattop, but it doesn't get in the way. Lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss, grilled onions, are all delicious. For better or worse, the mayo dominates the flavor profile after a while. I would veer toward slightly better.

Chuletas Asadas / Grilled Pork Chops ($8.95): when I asked the cashier, she said that she preferred this to the Lechon Asado (Roasted Pork), so I made it my choice. Two big pork chops come with your choice of rice. I went with white rice w/ red beans, and I realized a bit too late that there really were no beans in this for some reason. At least the rice was seasoned and not just some boring bystander. I'll probably try the yellow rice and pigeon peas next time anyway.

Regardless of the starch support, you're getting two pork chops in this bad boy, bone-in and all. I was fortunate that I got home before dealing with the bones because I always clean off the bones, and that can get a little messy. The pork chops were definitely tender, properly seasoned, and simply delicious. The grilled onions were crunchy and made for the perfect garnish.

Flan (~$3): I was definitely eyeing the pie de pancha, aka passion fruit pie, but they were out of that at the time. However, my buddy Bronsen picked up the flan and shared it with me. Nice caramelized crust, thick and creamy flan, and delicious syrup at the bottom all contributed to a wonderful rendition of the custardy dessert.

This wasn't an altogether perfect series of dishes, but I was definitely pleased with my meal at Puerto Rico Express. I'm sure I'll be back to try the rest of their menu if and when the heat lets up a bit.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,3,4,m7Nt7K1F6IOlI_DsNqgNUA

4826659,2017-11-05,1,RrKvj24rmHndsO8A19lTyQ,I love to support my people so I had to check this place out. The food is horrible and has no flavor. They say they don't sell pasteles because it's too much work. The Alcapurrias don't have no taste. The Arroz con gandules is ok but the steak had no flavor either. They don't sell cola champagne and to top it off the customer service is BAD. I'm not sure how this place has good reviews or 4 stars lol please cook better and represent us Puerto Rican's the right way. We only have two places in Las Vegas who sell Puerto Rican food. DO NOT TRUST THESE GOOD REVIEWS Stay away! This food has no FLAVOR,mpxxmNU3coEWcpU8cpDeMg,1,0,2,P6_ljKOMRDRFcCL0SF2voQ

When I hear about Puerto Rican restaurants, I can't help but get excited over mofongo. I only know maybe 2 places that serve Puerto Rican food in town. Thanks to a friend from PR, we found this place...where Goodwich used to be (small shack at the same lot as Dino's).

Lechon Asado:
Roast pork. Nice, tender and a bit smokey. 4/5

Mofongo:
Green plantains mashed with garlic and chicharon - best eaten when freshly made and still hot. Re-heating does it no justice. Their version is really garlicky just the way I like it. Soooo good. A side order may be slit between 2 people because it tends to heavy once it hits your belly. *buuuuurrrrp!* 5/5

They have chicken, fried pork (also good), yellow rice, tostones, etc. I have to try the other menu items instead of sticking to a pork dish + mofongo.

This place is open til about midnight. Expect to wait about 20 minutes or so as they make your food to order.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,5,8,4,KMoqKC8WfFYnpQDUg_6yqw

5483785,2017-06-10,0,RrKvj24rmHndsO8A19lTyQ,I was hoping for a little better since really good Cuban sandwiches are harder and harder to come by in Las Vegas. The sandwich was pretty good but perhaps a little greasy on the outside. I ordered it with extra pork which was not needed. In the plus column they use sliced pork not pulled and real Swiss cheese not that gooey tasteless Swiss American.,6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,0,0,3,ulseCy_n8GXwVkRsAiTFNg

Yes, it's labeled Puerto Rican express but they make possibly the best Cuban sandwiches in the valley! They're not close to my side of town, which is probably a good thing for my bank account, otherwise I'd go broke spending all my money on their Cuban sandwiches...

Puerto Rico express saved the day!

They do not shy away from garlic and I cannot be mad I love it!

The Cuban sand which hit the spot it was crunchy and filled with porky goodness 

The tostones are awesome Garlic sauce on top. 

All for $10 and some change.
