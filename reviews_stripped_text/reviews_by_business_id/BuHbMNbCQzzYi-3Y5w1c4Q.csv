35756,2016-06-14,0,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,I must say this burger definitely surprised me with how good it tasted. It was my first time trying this place and I had my doubts. My buddy kept telling me to try it so I finally did. The quality was great and I loved that they had more choices for toppings and sauces. The service was great and the lady in the front made her rounds to make sure we were doing fine and also took our trays when we were finished unlike other burger joints. I ordered the double char with cheese and also had a side of ranch and jalape√±os. Location is kind of far from my side of town but will be visiting again when I am around the location. Thanks for the great service and delicious food!,4sK-tMmxPeYSeVzWplUi3A,0,0,5,0xMUHSOoC_1fTYzG9H1wNg
78052,2015-10-08,0,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,My boyfriend and I first heard of The Habit from a friend. It was amazing for our first time there! The staff were so friendly!! We both ordered the Santa Barbara. It was delicious!! And just a heads up I guess they have a secret menu that we didn't know about. Jessica was so sweet in letting me change our order last minute to cheese fries instead of regular. Also their strawberry lemonade was the best I've ever had!! And for dessert I ordered a chocolate malt which was delish as well! Can't wait to go back and try the teriyaki char burger! :),4bSqdBMkC7k6HBFOMS5GUg,0,0,5,lB1vCxYPvxwHuV0O0LyqWg

Let's just put it this way I'd rather go here then smash burger, Bachi burger, or ketchup (which is the bomb but way overpriced). Habit grill is part of the trifecta of best burger spots innout, habit, and then fatburger. Habit is proof that there is a God.

Parking is limited so be prepared to walk if you can't find a space. I entered through the back from Howard Hughes & there was very little parking on the backside. Entering from westbound Flamingo puts you right in the car park. 

They serve 2 combo meals: #1 is a burger/fries/drink; #2 is a double decker burger/fries/drink. Burgers come with lettuce, tomato, mayo, carmelized onion & pickle rounds. Cheese is extra. I ordered a #1 with cheese, no mayo/onion for $8. 

Everything else is a la carte. In addition to burgers, they serve veggie burgers & salads. 

Fries were great. Nicely salted. Served in those trays like In & Out. Hot, not burnt or overdone. 

The burger: definitely fresh, nice charbroiled flavor. Reminded me of Carl, Jrs. but better. It was piled nicely with the toppings & wrapped nicely. It's a nice sized burger & hit the spot. Not greasy or slimey at all. 

Everything is cooked to order & you're given a pager. When it flashes you pick up your food from the expediter who confirms your order before giving it to you. 

It was very busy during noon lunch hour. Everyone working was nice & friendly. The tables inside were packed & the outside tables were open...probably due to the chilly weather. 

I don't care for this area of town due to traffic & construction & proximity to the Strip so I'll probably never go back. However, the food was quite good. If they opened in other areas of town away from crazy Strip traffic I would eat there.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,3,1,4,ItEhIyHTQSYsmqjz8kFc1g

I was going to a show at the Hard Rock last week, and wanted to grab a quick bite.  I took a look at all of the new places recently opened @ the Hughes Center on Flamingo/Paradise, and decided to check out The Habit.  This place is great!  Really good food, fairly priced, friendly service, immaculate dining area, everything you'd want in a burger joint.

The menu is pretty large.  Besides the traditional burgers they offer chicken, tuna, veggie, as well as a tri-tip steak sandwich.  There are also 6 kinds of salads, sweet potato fries, tempura green beans, shakes, malts & sundaes, as well as a small kid's menu.

I got the Double Charburger w/cheese combo (with fries & a drink), about $9.  The burgers are cooked when ordered so everything is really fresh.  My burger was excellent, good fries, the drink selection is nice, several different teas, as well as sodas.  

The staff is constantly cleaning the place.  As soon as a party leaves their table, it's wiped down by one of the friendly staff members.  I was very impressed by The Habit, and will definitely make the trip from where I live in Spring Valley back there in the near future.",4QnjCKq__RCVVhYvFwfb6g,1,0,5,I9qxBUSo6mc1e2mtGwDW8w

The menu offers a variety of charburgers, sandwiches, fresh salads, a kids menu, and beverages as in fountain drinks, shakes, and malts. And they have a complimentary Chili Bar that is frequently stock with chili peppers, pepperoncinis, lemons, limes, and jalapenos.

I ordered the Bourbon Golden Chicken Sandwich ($6.99), a Bourbon BBQ-Spiced Fries ($2.50), and a side of Tempura Green Beans ($2.95). The Bourbon Golden Chicken Sandwich is a fried golden crispy chicken breast drizzled with a mild bourbon glaze on a toasted bun with copious amount of shredded lettuce, mayo, two slice of tomatoes, a pickle, and I omitted bacon. The sandwich is very tasty and I like how this restaurant are generous with portions. 

Now the Bourbon BBQ-Spiced Fries are coated with a unique spicy BBQ flavor, it's drizzled with more of that bourbon glaze, and it taste good. Just an FYI, be sure to have napkins ready because eating fries topped with a sweet tangy sauce can be quite a sticky matter. There is one side item that I always enjoy and it's the Tempura Green Beans, which are green beans lightly battered in tempura, and it's deep-fried to a crispy perfection. It is a fun tasty treat dipping fried green beans in ranch. By the way, the service is great!

They may have salads on the menu, but do yourself a favor and just get the burger. The salads aren't bad but they're really average- I stole the first and last bites of my guy's burger to console myself.

The sides deserve a mention, too- in addition to some standard but well-executed fries, they also offer tempura green beans, which are a fun little switch to make to your standard burger meal. Don't think they're actually ""healthy"" though, I mean they're still fried.

Service is great. Even coming at the end of the dinner rush, counters were clean and staff were courteous. My takeout order was packed up nicely and I was offered additional ketchup and ranch (gratis!) before I headed out.

Nevertheless, one of the managers (I didn't get to ask for his name) approached us and asked how everything was after overhearing me talking to the cashier about the confusion with my order. I told him what happened and he told us not to worry about it and brought the basket of fries right to us!

The long review: super clean place with friendly staff. Our order was out in about ten minutes.

The burger patty itself was cooked well all the way through but still super juicy. The closest comparison would be an In-n'-Out burger plus extra ingredients and a lot cheesier.

I got a Mocha malt as well - it was thick enough without being a chore to enjoy. A criticism I would have is that the mocha flavor was a bit buried under the chocolate syrup flavor, but the remedy for that might be just getting a coffee malt next time. And this criticism does not change the fact that the malt was fantastic.

I had fried green beans, which I thought were a pretty good alternative to fries. It isn't for anyone who shies away from greens, though. I probably won't grab them next time and instead opt for fries or onion rings, but they were a pleasant and interesting choice none the less.",KUq-JJ2Oz9SM3VYILrt0SA,0,0,5,LLe83qt_Wo99vWBIz16KVg

Service- Friendly and quick. I was in and out within 5 minutes even though all my food was cooked to order. The cashier was sweet and friendly. The expeditior and I assume manager who bagged my food was very sanitary. I saw him apply hand sanitizer to his hands often, and saw him wash his hands after changing tasks. He was also very friendly and gave me extra ranch for my sides.

Decor- Very modern, clean space. You walk up to the counter and order and they give you a pager while you wait for your food. They have a condiment and drink station to the right of the register, with strawberry limeade, soft drinks and a pepper bar consisting of jalapenos, banana peppers and yellow chilies. There is a comfy couch to sit and wait while your food is being prepared, and comfy booths or tables if you want to dine in.

Food- I ordered the Santa Barbara burger, onion rings and tempura green beans. The SB is their double char burger on sourdough bread, with avocado, cheese, mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomato and grilled onions. I also order the tempura green beans and the onion rings. I'd say the onion rings were my favorite part of the meal. They were hot and crispy, and had a nice crunchy breading. The tempura green beans were boring. There was no crunch, they were just limp and tasteless. The burger was just okay. I did appreciate the fresh avocado, and there was lots of it. But the avocado overpowered the flavor of the burger because that is all I tasted. I also don't like pickles on my burger and should have asked for them without, but can't fault Habit for that cause it was my bad.

I've been to this place a dozen times and I've only had 1 negative experience and it wasn't with the food. I would recommend not leaving the brand new cashier in training by himself. As he didn't know what protein style was and also having a hard time getting through the line. After messing the order up a few times the cashier who usually takes orders took over for a 4th try. We were a little annoyed and it seemed to annoy her that we were bothered ""I'm just helping you out ok?"" Is what she said to be exact.

The concept and food remind me of another West Coast burger chain which has gained great sucess on stagnat simplicity and robotic execution.

Habit Burger grill may have evolved with the changing times adding Veggie burgers, teriyaki burgers,and kids chicken items.  The decor has a very modern and clean design for this vegas location.  I went with the signature Double Char combo. The burger came out fast a topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and grilled onion.  The burger was a filling portion with 2 1/4 lb patties stacked and flame grilled for flavor. 

My favorite part of the meal was the thick cut fries. Great portion and once again very filling.  The we're fried golden brown and had a nice crunch and seasoned well. It seams the decades of this concept being around they have perfected some items in there kitchen.  

Overall good experience so much so that I could make this place a Habit.  The staff and managers were all very friendly.  The one issue I had was the size of the place. Capacity said 70+ but we were there with about 30+ and it was feeling cramped.  Good thing they have an outdoor patio.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,4,3,4,RWva17thbpf4ZGcND4HUTw

The food!!!! I can't remember the last time I had such a delicious sandwich!!! The ""Santa Barbara"" is amazing. I cannot say enough about how impressed I was with this place. I have been to many high class restaurants, and paid much more money for food that was sub par and service that is beyond lackluster compared to this place.

You can find it in the midst of ""Restaurant Row"" on the NE corner of Flamingo and Paradise. It's actually in a small mini mall with Panera Bread and Chipotle, just east of Fogo De Chao.

We each ordered the #2 combo, which consists of a Double Charburger (we added American cheese) with an order of fries and a regular drink ($8.60). 

(+) Very juicy, tasty, and satisfying burger! The burger is pretty big, so much so that it was tough to get full bites of it! The meat was cooked perfectly. Definitely enjoyed my first Charburger!
(+) Customer service is on point. We were greeted at the door right away by a friendly guy who was great at explaining things and answering some questions about the menu! Plus he was walking around later to pick up trays and ask how everyone was doing. Very impressed at the level of service for a casual burger place!
(+) They set out peppers and chiles if you wish to add those to your items. Not my thing, but great to see they have that option available for those who want it.

Other tidbits -

- They have Coke products for their fountain drinks. No Coke Zero, but Diet Coke is available.
- No eggs available for the burgers. Not necessarily bad, just a heads up.

Really enjoyed this place and I think I would put it in my top 3 casual burger spots in the city! I will certainly be back!

I'm traveling from out of town on business and staying at the residence inn right behind this burger joint. It is easily accessible so I thought I'd try it out. We don't have these in Colorado, so I was excited to try something new. I enjoy that they have a simplistic menu, and it's easy to order. I've been three times now, and EVERY TIME I've gone, my burger was very undercooked. It was cooked well until I got you the center, where the meat was still a dark shade of pink/red. For a quick burger place like this, they should be cooked all the way through. It was too soft to be considered cooked all the way. The first two times I let it go, thinking maybe they were in a hurry cause it was somewhat busy, but they weren't swamped. The last time I went, once again I got an undercooked burger. This time it was not busy at all. They have choices of sides if you don't want fries, but they actually have pretty good fries so I got them as well as the tempura green beans. My food came out fast (again because it was undercooked) and I started eating the green beans. I got three in, pulled out the next one, and there was a long, fine hair stuck to the batter. I wanted to throw up. Needless to say, I walked back to the place (I got my order to go and took it to my hotel room) and talked to the manager. She first offered to make me my entire order fresh again, since now my burger and fries went cold, but I refused. It killed my appetite. She then tried to give me some kind of credit for next time - you've got to be kidding! There won't be a next time. I won't go back there, and we don't have these in Colorado. I told her I just wanted a refund so I can go to the Panera next door instead. She said OK, and I got a refund. 

Overall, their burgers don't taste bad, but they aren't great. They could use better seasoning and less salt. Always undercooked. Want a better burger? Go to five guys. It's a mile away near the target, and they are ALWAYS good. They get 2 stars instead of one because they at least have good customer service.",PtqVPMUcq995hCvsHrtN6g,2,0,2,A7DWSKVmdPiuXIbJXcjp-A

The current LV location is a bit of a drive from my house but I was craving Habit so we loaded up and made the trek.  We got there in 18 minutes which by Vegas standards is forever.  
   They have plenty of parking and once inside the interior is very nice.  Despite being fast Casual they have a classy looking interior.  One of the nicest interiors in comparison to their completion.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We quickly ordered and sat down for the short wait for our food to be made fresh.
   We got the Santa Barbara Burger,  Doulde Char with added Mushrooms, Onion rings, Tempura Green Beans and Sweet potato Fries.  Within 10 minutes our meal was ready.  We were excited to enjoy Habit again as it was very good the last time we had them.  We were not disappointed.  The Santa Barbara was delicious.  The sourdough with just the right amount of butter and toasted perfectly were exactly what I was craving.  The avocado with caramelized onions are a great addition and added to the enjoyable flavor of the burger.  The Double Char with mushrooms was also a delicious treat.  The caramelized onions are so tasty on a burger and add in the mushrooms and this was just what I was craving.   
   The sweet potato fries are so good.  Sweet and crispy which is just what you need with a good burger.  The Onion rings were also very good.  They were crisp but not crumbly and very tasty.  We regretted not ordering 2 orders of onion rings as splitting them became a problem.  The Tempura green Beans were also very good.  I know some don't like them but I have to say I am a fan.  All in all we had a very good meal.

3391589,2015-08-17,0,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"I saw an ad for The Habit many years ago and I really wanted to try it. A few years ago we were coming back from a weekend in Zion and after having lunch at Chilis, I was disappointed to see ""The Habit"" was located right by the freeway entrance! I had missed my chance to try it out. There are no Habits in the Las Vegas area until now and it's open on Flamingo and Paradise near the Las Vegas Strip. I took Lana there on saturday lunch and there was a tiny line as we walked in. The dining area is a bit small with about 12 small booths and a large, maybe 12 seat long table to sit and eat. There is a small outside dining area but with the Las Vegas heat in full force, no thanks! Prices are not bad and there are several burgers to choose from. I had the regular with no cheese, fries and a drink combo for $7 and change. Lana had the mushroom burger, onion rings and a drink, the total was less than $20, around the $17 dollar mark I think it is. That's very good for being so close to a world famous tourist destination.
When ordering I knew exactly what I wanted, but it's kind of a ""dance"" to order because you can't just speak to the order taker in one quick to the point sentence.
Seems they have questions to ask you and if you just order it kind of messes with their routine. Next time just let them ask you what you want and answer them. If it was a dance, you let them lead. You are the hungry robot, they are the master programer. Kind of like the Soup nazi episode on Seinfeld, let them ask you, then you answer. ha ha!
When you are finished they give you one of those light up joy buzzers when your order is ready. There is some hot yellow chili peppers and drinks on the right. The Strawberry Lemonade with cucumbers was delicious, but you can also get the normal selection of soda's too. There are 2 small booths towards the back, but today I guess they were managers in black shirts and it looked like they had those seats as their office and was doing something on a laptop computer. Maybe that is where they work? I didn't really see a office area for them to use. Kind of odd since there were people looking for a place to sit.
The staff was working hard and I counted 10 people in the grill area and 2 to 3 ladies up front, why they need so many people back there, I don't know but they are were like busy ants doing their best.
Soon the buzzer alerted us and we got our burgers. They were kind of on the small side and from what I remember of the ad I saw many years ago, it seemed the burgers were thicker and larger. First bite and you can tell it's a good burger. I didn't really detected that nice charred taste, but this sure ain't no Mc Doodoos. Very fresh and simple, we liked it alot. The fries are standard and so was the onion rings, both cooked to order and not soggy. Very good.
There was a service lady that came around as we were still eating and she really wanted to take our tray away, but we were not finished yet and I had to tell her we were not done yet. Then when we finished a few minutes later I almost got the trashed dumped into the trash can when the lady came over and she wanted to tip the tray in the rest of the way, so I let her take it from my hands and I thanked her. Overall very good classic burger place, they have salads and chicken sandwichs too, I think.

Both times they were very busy, but the line up moves very fast and they have a lot of people in their kitchen cooking.  The first time I had their mushroom burger and it was very tasty, juicy and hamburger was cooked just right, with a little bit of pink in the burger. Their fries are also very good, crispy and tasty and you get a pretty good portion for the price.  They also have a freshly made strawberry lime drink that is a must try.  The second time I went I tried just their charburger and it was equally as good.  It comes fully loaded with grilled onions, tomato, lettuce and pickles,  Their prices are very reasonable.

For what normally will cost you about 8 bucks, you get a good burger (fresh toppings and several different varieties), fries and a drink. That puts this place in the ""gourmet burger"" market, which has some pretty decent contenders around town (Bobby's Burgers, Five Guys, Smash Burger, heck...even In-n-Out). I wouldn't put Habit above any of those i mentioned, but it's was definitely good enough to warrant a repeat trip and to recommend to others. 

Granted it was their opening day, but the energy in this place was high: the people were friendly, the owner was walking around doing table touches and the service was quick. We'll see if that energy dies down when they get to the day-to-day business as usual phase, but as of right now they create a really welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to come back. 

Convenient location too, as you don't have to deal with the strip. Do yourself a favor and resist the temptation of going to Chipotle next door and give this place a try at least once.",VQHGS5qNZvuN2Y78zDA2KQ,3,0,4,2wdoPNuySMPa9wD_0goL7g

3849607,2017-09-21,4,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"This is my latest Yelp review where I'm truly stuck between 3-4 stars and wish we could go halves like the overall average does.

So, my 3 1/2 star experience here featured a high level of customer service, even though it was very obvious that the female employee actually taking my order was a new employee. Another employee looked over her shoulder to make sure she entered the details of my order properly and that particular employee answered every question I had with enthusiasm for my business.

The Teriyaki Charburger was a good choice, especially since I left off the mayo because I don't know why anyone would want to mix mayonnaise with Teriyaki sauce. Unless it is mustard and ketchup, makes no sense for me to mix condiment sauces on any sandwich. Pick one for that particular flavor and enjoy it, don't create condiment chaos that overwhelms the ingredients. 

That Teriyaki burger was better than I hoped and a really good value for the price. Feel free to take my lead and order yours also with sourdough instead of the toasted bun for no upcharge.

I also had a garden salad with tri-tip steak added to it and while I also thought it was a good value, I have to agree with others that the salad is just kind of average in taste and nothing special. The value came in the size of the salad and the amount of steak they added for the additional charge, but I didn't even finish the salad portion despite trying three different dressings at a time to add some flavor to the veggies.

This space is very clean and convenient for those like me who stay just off The Strip and sometimes just want to grab and go dinner from a place a step up from fast food, yet not wait at a bar for takeout at a casual dining restaurant. 

Besides, after a long flight into Vegas and all the additional time required to get off the plane, pick up my golf clubs at baggage claim, ride the shuttle to the rental car center, pick up the actual rental car itself and drive to my hotel, this Habit is right on the way to Westgate and feeds me quickly without any hassles of The Strip itself.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,8,6,3,kEmiFAs69RXJyCFjVSQOmQ

They were somewhat busy when we stopped by for lunch today, but the line moved swiftly and the girl who took our was very sweet and proficient.  We had our receipt, drink cups, and our pager in less than a minute. Off we went to get drinks (Coke products, 3 different brewed iced tea choices, and strawberry lemonade), condiments, and some jalape√±os from their pepper bar before sitting at a comfortable booth.  Our pager went off within a few minutes and we got to enjoy our delicious hot and fresh charburgers, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  

The charburger was juicy with a great flame broiled taste, the bun was light and fluffy, and the lettuce & tomato were fresh and crisp.

The orders of onion rings and sweet potato fries were both generous in portion size.  We could have shared one order, but how can you try both that way!  The onion rings had a great crunch and a tasty batter.  They provided ranch with our rings if you like to dip.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.  They were on the softer side which I liked (not fried to a crisp so you can't even tell they are sweet potatoes).

I must say my first left me unimpressed and a lot left to be desired. I ordered the char burger and it was nothing spectacular. Plain and no flavors really stood out. However, on my most recent visit I had the Hawaiian burger protein style per Melissa V.'s recommendation. I was impressed because it was a must tastier burger than my initial visit. The pineapple was a nice twist as it complimented the burger well. The amount of Lettuce was impressive because it truly added that crunch factor and bite of freshness. But what truly made this tastier was the char flavor, this aspect was defiantly lacking my first time. Is this because their grill is more seasoned than when they first opened? I think YES! This is why I like trying out a place way after their grand opening. Also all the kinks have been worked out, in addition to the hype going down which means less lines. Also reading the reviews will usually lead you on what to order and how. If I'm craving a burger the Habit will definitely come to mind.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,1,0,4,amiKt2CUp3Gu0ulX8eZ6Zg

Quick Review¬ô
*This rating and review is based on a series of firsthand experiences of patronising this restaurant located on Flamingo/Paradise.
*For the purposes of contextualization of this review: I have never visited any other The Habit Burger Grill location. I was a Habit virgin.
*Some items I have tried: Charburger, Double Charburger with Cheese, Veggie Burger, Chicken sandwich, Chicken Club, Sweet Potato Fries, Fries, Strawberry Shake, Strawberry Limeade. All good or better.

Pro Tip: Strawberry shake is the best I have had at a fast food-casual. The music being played is also the best in terms of FF-C.

-----------------------------------------¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠-----------------------

Someone convinced me to try The Habit; I was at Coachella. I looked in at the location in Indio; however, the enormous crowds that congregated during April were just too long of a wait for fast food or fast casual or whatever the fuck this is considered. 

So, I never tried it until it debuted in Vegas. And even then: I was not in a rush. It was the No Kid Hungry¬Æ charity campaign that brought me in the doors and subsequently made me a fan. The food is solid for fast food/casual; the strawberry limeade might be the best drink I have ever had at any fast food/casual anywhere. Easily would go the proverbial distance in a bout against the strawberry limeade at Cafe Rio¬Æ. Only way to find out would be a double blind test. 

Pro Tip: Get the strawberry limeade. It's Best in Show¬ô.

-----------------------------------------¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠-----------------------

Step 1: Place your order with the personable order-taker. 

Step 2: Take the buzzer and proceed to wait/wash your filthy hands since you just felt up a buzzer that has been touched by a hundred people who spend all day doing everything besides washing their hands.

Step 3: Eat. 

Step 4: Refill your strawberry limeade before hitting the road.

Pro Tip: Construction on Flamingo makes it cumbersome to get back on Paradise. Drive north on Hughes Circle until it leads to Paradise just south of Gordon Biersch. This could be helpful to UNLV or Hard Rock Hotel visitors.

-Appetizing sweet potato fries

FOOD 3/5:
TBH the santabara style burger ($5.95) was OK. It had avocado, cheese & other expected burger items but it wasn't doing any justice. For a $6 burger, I expected a delicious patty. The patty tasted bland, like a Mcdonalds patty. The bread was toasty good. 
-Sweet potato fries (2.80): no complaints here, they made it crispy & yummy

They also always inform the cooks to keep my meal separate so it does not cross contaminate with other food.

I never believe those ""Best of . . . ."" titles because so often I've found they really aren't or the bar is set relatively low.

This looked like a burger joint with a limited menu. Counter where you order and lots of seating inside.  Very similar to In and Out Burger so I was prepared to not be impressed.  My mistake.

The burgers are delicious and made fresh to order. They have 6 burgers on the menu. I had the Double Charburger with cheese combo (Mayonnaise, pickle, fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun) which was a killer burger - good size, excellent taste, reasonable price.  The Boss had the single Charburger.   Fries were crispy, nice sized, good tasting and not soggy or oily.  We each had a handmade on the spindle shake.   Really a very good burger meal.  I'm a big eater, but the one Double Charburger was more than sufficient to fill me up.  Good value for the dollars spent.

They also have 6 different sandwiches, 6 different salads, onion rings, sweet potato fries and even sundaes. There is also a kids menu.  The place was busy, very clean and orderly. The staff was constantly running out from behind the counter to wipe things down and clean things up. They were friendly and surprisingly engaging.

Hard to believe a great rating for a chain burger joint, right?  Better than In and Out. Better than 5 Guys. Better than Fuddruckers. Better give it a try! ! !",NRIVHcztZ2sVuL3ZTIDlVw,0,0,4,qoaZWOQ7YbrTI2TeN-nexw

I had the Charbroiled Mushroom Burger, steak-like fresh French fries and a citrus green tea. All very good. Would have totaled about $10. Its from Santa Barbara and while I grew up in southern California - it's new to me, but I like it. In the style of other quality fast food burger joints like 5 Guys, Inn & Out Burger & dare I say Bobby's Burger Palace. I say it s worth a try.

It's in the Hughes Center by Bahama Breeze and Fogo De Chao - near the newer Starbucks and new Chipotle and Pieology. 

Staff was very friendly and helpful.

I have however never been a fan of their fries. Seriously, they can really do something about it and up their game. I normally swap out the fries with onion rings. But I have often just ordered the cheeseburger and nothing else.

I ordered the Santa Barbara with fries and my fried had just a normal burger with onion rings.

The SB is super delicious! I love anything on toasty bread, so a definite plus! The only gripe was that I forgot it was a double patty... because one of the patties was only a half of one. Other than that, really delicious, love the fresh avocado!

Fries are really good; they have a delicious crispy texture and they give you a good amount of fries. 

Onion rings are insanely delicious! Dip them in ranch, along with your fries, and really everything and you have yourself a party!

The ranch is actually something to write about, its soooooooo creamy and delicious! Ask for it!

The strawberry limeade is RIDICULOUS! So flavorful and amazing!

The only downside was the seating, it gets busy, so you have to get what you get. We had to sit in the high booths; if you're short like me, its uncomfortable because your legs just hang and your circulation gets all screwy, and when you get out you fall and everyone looks at you.

Burgers are good, especially when mushrooms and grilled onions are added. Sandwiches are even better in my opinion. On the chicken sandwiches, you can choose between BBQ or teriyaki sauce (go for the latter!), and veggie sandwiches have honey mustard. I'll suggest sour dough, although it'll break apart and you'll end up eating it with a fork.

4654972,2016-04-07,8,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"""There's no substitute for quality,"" is the Habit Burger Grill mantra. The Habit Burger Grill puts substance into their mantra. From a mom and pop burger place established 1969 in San Bernardino, the Habit Burger Grill has grown into a 147 restaurant chain. They are now based in Irvine, California sharing a corporate headquarters city with another burger icon known as In N Out. The chain is in a major expansion mode. In August 2015, the Habit entered Las Vegas with this location. This will be the first of fifteen locations in the Las Vegas market with a second one to open at Blue Diamond and Decatur. 

   Fans of The Habit Burger Grill also call it the Habit. For the rest of the Review it is referred to as the Habit. The Habit righteously has many fans. In 2014, ""Consumer Reports"" awarded the Habit Charburger as the Best Burger in America. 

   I had heard praise about the Habit. My brother told me good things about it. Subsequently my Yelp friends would recommend it through reviews and pictures. Today, it was time to check out the Habit. 

  This Habit is in a crowded part of town made more crowded by construction on Flamingo Road. Getting onto eastbound Flamingo Road could be a challenge. My tip is to exit behind the building. Turn left and a second left onto Howard Hughes Pkwy that leads to a traffic signal at Flamingo. Ultimately the Habit itself is crowded. The restaurant was nearly full at 11:30 AM on a Wednesday. 

  Right off the bat I was impressed with the pricing. The charbroiled Charburger combo which includes a beverage and paper boat of fries starts off at $7. With cheese at 60 cents extra it came out to $8.22. The woman who took my order took my money with a smile. I would eat the Charburger with a smile. That would be in a few minutes. She gave me a buzzer with an appropriate saying ""Better to wait a short time for your burger than have your burger wait a long time for you."" If I waited by the open kitchen the cooks would make the burger before my eyes. 

   The Charburger included cheese, mayo, pickle, tomato, lettuce, and caramelized onions between toasted buns. If I wanted more spice to it; there was a pepper bar featuring jalape√±os, pepperoncini, pickled banana peppers, and hot sauces. The burger didn't need more spice. Just a handful of napkins. The fries were also good and plentiful. Their strawberry limeade was the bomb. The bottomless beverage included the delicious beverage that could win the Consumer Reports ""Best Limeade in America."" 

    Personally, another advantage of this Habit is being near my coffee habit. It is a short walk to Starbuck's which made a nice sequel to the burger adventure. 

    I give a thumbs up to the Habit. I look forward to the opening of the Blue Diamond at Decatur location.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,11,4,mJWDd9uxZfHNIJFcybpZKg

It may look small to the eye but this is a lot of burger, layers upon layers of goodness... each bite better than the last... no exaggeration. This flavorful beast has portabella mushrooms, melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, pickles, and roasted garlic aioli (that doesn't taste too mayonnaise-eee) on a toasted bun. Throw in some hot peppers from their pepper bar and it's sure to be an experience that will linger in your mouth way after you're done eating! No literally.

Burger tasted pretty good, and the killing part was onion ring. their onion ring is fried perfectly, and I made a right decision that I got 2 of those.

5085097,2015-08-26,5,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"Hey now. Three stars means A-OK, okay? Will I make it a habit of coming here again and again? Probably not. When my subconscious is craving a burger, is this my first, second, or even third choice? No.

I debated between a 3 and 4 star rating because realistically this is 3.5* in my book. With that said, there is some pretty stiff competition in the burger scene in Las Vegas.

While customer service, cleanliness, and efficiency of receiving the food (despite being busy) are an A+, the food just lacked the oomph.

Items tried:
Santa Barbara style - the description alone sounded like a burger I would like. 
It is a double char burger with cheese and avocado on grilled sourdough. I love avocado, but that is all I tasted. No other notes of anything shining through. No crack sauce. $5.95. 

Teriyaki char - pretty good taste overall! There's that sauce I was looking for. It's not too salty or sweet, it's just right. What upsets me is how teeny tiny the pineapple was. The pineapple was flat, thin, and dry. I guess the only positive is that they use fresh pineapples because of it's irregular shape and poorly cut portion. It's definitely not your standard pineapple ring from a can. I feel guilty for even wishing I had one of those canned pineapple rings in my burger. I think a bigger, juicier pineapple would have elevated the flavor of the burger. $3.45 + cheese $0.55 

Albacore tuna filet sandwich - this is prepared medium. For sandwiches, there is a choice of bread: French roll, grilled sourdough, or wheat bun. I only sampled this, since it was my husband's order. It was really good! Not fishy at all. I was more impressed with the sandwich than the burgers. $6.95 

Tempura green beans - different, but good! What a neat way to eat your veggies. My kid enjoyed this one. $2.95

Mocha shake - consistency was off. It was a little more chocolate-y than expected. I regret not trying the coffee shake instead. $3.25

Beware of the corporate lunch crowd. It can get pretty busy. 

Healthier options include a lettuce wrapped burger AKA ""protein style,"" veggie burger, and six different salads. 

Looking to try more of the sandwiches on future visits.",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,4,2,3,BMfbu6KJOuI8b4hKKnuBrQ

The burger meat is good and cooked well and taste good but it doesn't stand out from other burgers I've had. They use mayo as their spread and that's fine just I had to add ketchup cause I'm used to thousand island. Fries were good taste like some Burger King fries.

And one thing we've learned about parenthood is... you NEVER, under any circumstances, wake a soundly sleeping baby. So we wound up taking it to go and eating it in the car, LOL. 

The restaurant seemed nicer and cleaner than your average fast food burger joint. Our order was ready quickly and the service was good. The prices... well as a previous reviewer stated, their 2 combos aren't a deal from ordering a la carte. So get whatever darn fry, drink or anything else you want, because you're going to pay the same price for your upgrades whether you get them with your combo or order them separately. That said, overall it seemed cheaper than, let's say, a burger at Five Guys. 

My husband enjoyed his burger and I liked my chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce. Both the regular fries (nothing special, but good) and the sweet potato fries, were decent. The chocolate shake so hit the spot!

5362874,2016-03-15,1,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"I'm a sucker for charbroiled burgers. There's something about a beef patty being freshly grilled that just makes my tastebuds smile. And The Habit has definitely mastered the art of charbroiling!

I always order the Mushroom Char. It's a beef patty that has been seared to perfection then topped with grilled mushrooms, melted Swiss cheese, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo- All on a toasted sesame bun! Call me crazy, but I actually prefer mayo or thousand island as opposed to ketchup on my burgers. So I definitely approve of their choice of condiment!

Since eating a burger without fries is simply unheard of, we usually have 1 order of fries to share. They are pretty generous when it comes to portions, so 1 order is plenty enough. There's a little bar where you can get your ketchup, drinks, and even peppers! I really enjoy this since I love to eat jalape√±os and pepperoncinis on the side.

The plaza that this burger joint is located in is super busy with other popular restaurants. Hubby and I usually make a quick stop here after I finish my classes at UNLV.

We were looking for a place to go eat in the middle of the night that wasn't fast food. We saw the pictures on Yelp and decided to come here. When we walked in we thought there was a mistake or the portion size was really small. $3 bucks for a burger? Our expectations immediately fell.

We ended up paying $10 for the Double Charburger w/ Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, and a drink. Yeah just one Burger because my friend had already eaten earlier. They gave us a little beeper to pick up our food (probably because it gets really busy during lunch) and we sat down for about 5-8 minutes til we got our burger and fries.

Sweet potato fries. They weren't anything special. They didn't taste like they were seasoned well. It was bland, I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries anyways so I would have not enjoyed them anyway. Still I would recommend the regular fries unless those are bland too in which case just don't get fries.

The Charburger was a good size. It was the best tasting $3 burger I have ever tasted. It was the middle of the night so I was expecting the food to not taste fresh. Most restaurants do preps in the morning. I bite into it. It was amazing. The lettuce wasn't old, the tomatoes were fresh. All around great burger. Right remember when I said my friend had already eaten. She took a bite and decided to get one for herself. It was really good.

You ever wanted to be a criminal? Just come here. At their prices your basically stealing their burgers from them. I don't understand how they are making a profit. If you didn't tell me how much the food cost I would have expected the burgers to cost 8 dollars. Oh I forgot to mention customer service. It was good the cashier walked around and made sure that everyone was happy.

I've tried their #1 charburger, #2 double charburger, and mushroom char. Everything tastes great, and service is relatively quickly considering how busy they get during lunchtime. I would say this is my second favorite fast burger place behind in-n-out. If you're hungry, get the combos (#1 or #2). If you're starving, get the #2, it will fill you up. Just keep in mind that adding cheese to your burger is a bit extra charge, as well as switching your fries in the combo from regular to sweet potato fries. If you get all that as a #2, with cheese and sweet potato fries, everything comes out to a little over $10, which is worth it for me. Their sweet potato fries are super good, tastes very fresh. Also try their strawberry lemonade, it's full of flavor and very refreshing.

5911783,2017-03-11,3,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"Literally, the best little burger stop you can find other than in n out. High quality burgers. Thick shakes. Crispy fries. It doesn't get any better. Oh wait, it does. Because the service might actually be one of the best for a fast food place. They're always welcoming when you first walk in and helpful from the minute you order til when you leave. They check up on you during your meal and even get you to go boxes and bags. I like the fact that they have a condiment bar with different toppings for your meal. And they really do become a dang habit. A delicious habit.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,7,4,5,4VuPH7k252zJfjMSyfwDTQ
5917497,2017-04-16,0,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,"Surprisingly good, it gets better and better as you eat it. The burgers seem plain and not very imaginative at first. The fries look like nothing special. The salads use iceberg lettuce. So what's the big deal? Well, everything seems fresh and crispy. The fries are light but have been fried to crispy gold colored sticks of potato. The Santa Barbara Cobb salad has bacon, egg, blue cheese, tomato and avocado with a light dressing. That's just a descriptor. Ok, it's made well. Even the hamburger we seems built and not slapped together. It's simple, flavorful, and looks good. Service was great.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,1,4,YKhSa--256-QbesKuXUQQA

No, the fact that I went to UC Santa Barbara for college, lived in Goleta where the first Habit location was founded and today is my first time having one of their menu item! 

Did that Goleta location shut down while I was there?  I have no idea. What I do know is that the Charbrburger is just alright. Better quality and fresher ingredients compared to McDonald's, but the burger just didn't wow me. Maybe I needed that Fry Sauce I read about in other reviews.

The Strawberry Limeade is good though. Very sweet, so I had to water it down, but I liked it better as a sugary drink over the Charburger vs say a Single with Cheese Animal Style.

Suggestion: avoid the lunch crowd, especially during the summer and the outside temperature is in the low 100s, because that's where you will have to sit and eat if you can't fight for one of the coveted indoor seating spaces.

Carpool if you can too, because Panera has crazy lunch crowds too and the parking lot is also shared with Chipotle, Jamba Juice & Pieology. 

The clear winner? The owner of this strip mall of course!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,15,14,3,zp7dC4gBr_XQ1pKeb3cVJg

I appreciate a good burger, and this place doesn't disappoint. I usually get the double char with cheese, always good. I hear the shakes and malts are good, but I try not to over do it haha. The food is all cooked to order so the fries and burgers are always fresh. The ranch here is so good, so that's a plus for me.
The employees are all pleasant and very nice. I always feel welcome when I'm here. 
It's always nice to eat where the employees are all nice. 
Definitely a good burger place to come to!",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,1,4,AbCGbPHwiBibNp2U5dbxdA

I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
My boyfriend and his family have raved about how good this place was and I had to try it, because a lot of you Reno yelpers know that I love me a burger! So when in Rome (Vegas), I eat! 
Their menu is to the point and easy to read. I got the charburger with cheese, fries and a chocolate shake. It only took about 8-10 minutes for us to get our food (LOVE! Know they cooked it fresh). The burger was delicious, I literally ate it in 5 minutes max. It was juicy and had a great flavor! 
The fries were just okay, but I don't like super potato-ey fries (prefer em crispy) but that's okay! That's a personal thing, can't knock them for that!
The shake was to die for. I usually can't finish a shake no matter how good it was and this one was emptied by the time we left! 
It was also really cool that a worker came up to us and asked us if she could fill up any of our drinks or throw any of our trash away! For a fast food place to have their employees do that felt really personal! I love it here! Now just to get them to open one in Reno...",oT4-j7Kht8P-8EfE9FZCKw,2,2,5,XQIZXtG0r0BhU8uF1SfgOQ
5980246,2015-08-08,1,BuHbMNbCQzzYi-3Y5w1c4Q,Its about time I can have Habit while in Vegas since it has always been my favorite burger from Cali. It must have been a grand opening promotion because I got a free burger and it was delish! Considering they just opened everything seemed to flow well and the staff seemed well trained already so that was nice. Can't wait to come back again!,HO7xKzp623KR7nDBuctdQg,1,0,5,7xDmO6lUZJQqijAyZ_NdtQ

After a long flight...we were starving & this place definitely lived up to its rating. My fiance & I loved the strawberry lemonade & peach & ginger drink! Would definitely recommend & visit again!,Z1jY9bhbjdBUGeRZT_jSmw,0,0,4,AltQAAzuT0knRJlOVIA99w
