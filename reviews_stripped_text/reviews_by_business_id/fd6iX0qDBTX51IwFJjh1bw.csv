They offer a variety of teas (almond, green, black, black-mango, thai, etc...) Their boba is good and the place is clean and cute. The service is really friendly! Chinatown does have better boba, but there is no other good boba place around the university.

Plus, they have a stamp card so after 10 teas, I get one free which is a service that most places around UNLV don't have (like Starbucks/Coffee Bean/Jamba Juice.)

I have never tired their food; I just  continue to go for their boba tea. :)

PS-I read another reviewer stating that this place didn't have boba. I have been here a couple times and every time they have had boba.",ddoeoQd81d4y076PYK-xeQ,0,0,4,FVDB1bgetHQQhfbLjN0U2A

Then we ordered Minced Pork over rice and Pork chop over rice and one milk tea. The dishes are simple, just meat and a lot of rice. When I first look at the dish, I feel bored. For this kind of price, I expect there are more stuff on the plate. Usually, when we went to the other place offer the same kind of dish, it got more stuff in the plate. The minced pork can be more salty. The drink is lack of sweetness. We told the Manager there, and discussed with him a little. He is nice and I really wish they can observe the other restaurant and improve. Finally, he remade the improved drink for us. It is sweet enough, but now it covers the flavor of the tea. Just keep trying, if you wish to improve, you can do it. Please let me know If 3pm got improved. I will go back if they become better. P.S. their WIFI is super fast.

She ordered popcorn chicken which was $5, and it was only like 15 pieces of chicken.  My chicken wings had a little bit more.  It had four pieces.  I just didn't feel that the food was worth it.

Yelp does need to provide a negative star system to show how bad a restaurant can b. a star is still too good. I don't know the staff is not rude but just damn slow and food quality is...omg...

The cafes in Chinatown are better. The spaghetti was good, but I wouldn't order it again. The overall menu was okay. Nothing special. 

The reason why I'm giving them 2 stars is because the service was terribly slow. The workers were very friendly but it was kind of ridiculous how slow our food came out.

I also like how this place has free wifi so I can get some homework done. The place is typically slow with only a few tables occupied however when I was leaving a big group came in and they were kind of loud.

1644335,2012-04-22,1,fd6iX0qDBTX51IwFJjh1bw,"I've been trying to find a decent boba cafe conducive for studying and lounging while trying to get things done.  Enter 3pm cafe.  
Located in an inconspicuous plaza right across from UNLV, I thought this would be a study haven for students.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon expecting to fight over an available table to whip out my laptop to surf on their free Wi-Fi and get my nerd on.    I walked in and the place was empty.  ""Sweet!"" I thought.   I was greeted by a friendly server and placed my order: honey green tea with boba ($3.75) and minced pork over rice ($7.25).  

The service was friendly and attentive so that's always a plus.  Nothing to write home about, though.  I really like the laid-back atmosphere of the place and the fact that I can camp here for a few hours rage-studying without being given a dirty look.  

My tea came out in a cute mason jar fairly quickly.  It tasted good, with the right amount of sweetness from the honey. The boba pearls had a decent amount of bite to them and I do enjoy a good boba chewing session.

The minced pork dish was surprisingly good.  It reminded me of the same dish my mom made back in the day.  There was a good amount of rice (about 2 cups worth) and the pork was tender and flavorful.  There was half a hard-boiled egg so I was excited about that ( I LOVE anything egg).  Two things, I didn't like, were that it was a tad bit salty.  At first bite, it was good.  Each subsequent bite became saltier than the last, but not to the point where I would douse the food with water to dilute the saltiness.  The second thing I didn't like about this dish was that it was a little too pricey but I'd still order it again..just because it's decent food and I'm usually hungry and will eat anything I can get my grubby hands onto.",3fvZdZGNi_87rm5aq_a80w,1,1,3,Y-2-vUcZ1yUgCLLn06jeKA
1947550,2012-09-05,0,fd6iX0qDBTX51IwFJjh1bw,"Oh god wasnt paying attention and this is my 200th review......

Yeah i'd seriously wouldnt recommend this place to anyone. We only went here due to it being a Sunday and all the major hot spots were closed (Stephano's, 28Go, that taco place). 

Service was alright considering there's only one person on staff to man both the drinks and front counter and the kitchen in the back. That could account of the quality of the food but if they knew there was only going to be one person then the food could have been prepared and if it was could also account for it's quality.

Fusion Fries
 - seriously almost 7 dollars for frozen fries with sauce, mayo, and rice topping sprinkles. SEVEN DOLLARS!! at most it's worth 3.95! portion size wasnt even that big!

Pork Belly on rice (daily special)
 - Wow seriously the blandest pork belly i've ever had. Waste of what could have been bacon. Not sure if it's suppose to taste like nothing but it tasted like....nothing. Even the chunks of pork belly which has the fat had any flavor to it.

Curry Rice w/Chicken Katsu
 - The chicken was pretty decent. Dark meat and had a nice crunchy crust and they even seasoned the chicken with a little salt. The rest of it was meh. Potato salad was halfway cooked containing bits of still raw potato hunks. Curry was Golden brand brick instant curry and is there a shortage of the stuff? When that nuclear reactor blew up did it take out the curry brick factory? When you think of Katsu Curry you're expecting a bowl with just all curry sauce, in island of rice, and a few strips of fried chicken slightly submerged in the curry. Nope exact opposite here. Mountains of rice with just a light mist of curry.

Expensive too. WAY expensive. When your target market are college students your strategy should be cheap and plentiful so they keep coming back. 3pm Cafe is neither cheap nor is it very plentiful.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,3,0,1,0g4EzkDqITRxYghSqH03mA

The milk teas were good. We had the green milk tea and the coffee milk tea. The green milk tea was okay. The coffee milk tea was a bit sweet for my taste.

Although not exorbitant, $7 for the minced pork bowl felt a bit too much for what arrived at the table. It tasted fairly good, but it was basically just a bowl of rice with some chopped up pork in it. Suggestion: toss a nominal fried egg on top (provide some furikake or shredded dried pork sung) and I'd be a happy camper. The beef spaghetti felt more worth its price. Definitely tasty.

Overall, definitely a nice place to grab a drink and bite, but with plenty of places all around with somewhat similar fare and some with lower prices I'm not sure we'll be back.",TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw,0,1,3,-xpeeSBwlsHbgKkKB5grQQ

Although everyone was nice they were not knowledgeable about their drinks. Or not very good at explaining the difference between similarly named ones. My lover and I stuck with old reliables: taro milk tea with boba and a black tea. After choking down powder on my first sip I shook and stirred my taro milk tea for a good two minutes to get it were it should have been. At least the boba was good, but looking at reviews that doesn't always seem to be the case. The black tea was WAY TOO SWEET. I've heard that they make things too sweet, but this was bad.

WHERE: On Maryland Parkway, between Tropicana & Flamingo. Right next to Cafe Rio. (Yessss.. dessert!!)

WHEN: They are still fairly new, so I believe they are testing out their hours as of the last time I've gone there.

WHY: If you need a break from all that studying, if you need a place to study, if you want to meet a friend and chitchat, if you're for some reason thirstier than normal, if you want to try something new, or if you just want to be there!

WHAT: I am so glad that there is now a boba cafe directly across the street from school! There are times where I crave a nice, cold boba drink and I now can fulfill my cravings and run across the street (of course looking both ways before crossing) and obtaining that delicious drink!

Both times I walked into the place, it was slower than I was expecting (probably because the times I've been there were both after 6pm). However, every time I stepped foot, I was delightedly greeted!! The workers there are so friendly! You can actually converse with them! =). They strictly had boba drinks only, but their menu stated other. This is because they will be getting their food stuff soon; which I'm extremely excited for (if they haven't gotten it all in already). The menu looked awesome though.

Came in and was promptly greeted and sat down. A waitress came by and we had requested more time to look over the menu. The service was lack-luster post this. We tried to get their attention and when we had. they said they would bring out someone that would take our order and we patiently waited. I was disappointed here to find out that they didn't have a few items that were on the menu and failed to inform us of this beforehand. I would have preferred to have known this before having looked over the menu.

In any case, I ordered the instant noodles with spam and egg. Ordering this i didn't expect too much considering that it was instant noodles and everything. The only upside to this dish was that they asked me how i would like my egg cooked. The rest was a disappointment. The instant noodle took roughly 10 minutes to come out. And came with what seemed to be a diluted broth even by instant noodle standards and 2 slices of spam that were 1cm thick at the most and an egg. The dish was 4.99 and I was expecting a bit more out of the dish in terms of spam just because the instant noodles were probably .50 a package and the spam and egg couldn't have been much further from that. I just feel like I didn't get much value for the money, and being  a college student, that would be a deciding factor in my choice of dining near the UNLV campus. 
On a side note the workers near the prep station for the food and drink were coughing quite a bit which made me feel quite uneasy.

Onto paying for the meal. The payment process took ages due to lack of a p.o.s system of some sort. Everything was written down and calculated by a desk calculator.

In short, I had quite the unpleasant experience here and would probably not revisit at least not for the time being. Perhaps once they obtain some sense of organization I will return and give them another go.",SwYa9R917l0UkxqtBDarGg,3,1,2,n5pCuR-E6DIx__sks2prHA

So 3PM cafe is a new Taiwanese tea house furnished heavily by Ikea items with snacks and minimal entrees. Teas are based off either black or green and then flavored accordingly and come in a fairly sized glass jar. Toppings include the usual such as boba and jelly, although at the moment they do not have jelly in stock. Everything is under $10 and you get a 10% discount with your UNLV ID. There is also free wifi, and I believe they're opened until 1AM?

Now the bad... The service definitely need works. Walking in my group went up to the registers to place an order, but was told to go to the table  to sit down and get our orders taken, although other people weren't turn down at the counter when ordering. Service was really awkward, and took multiple awkward looks with the wait staff to get our orders placed. Two egg and spam instant noodles($4.95) and a minced pork ($7.25) over rice took about 25 minutes to come out. Had to ask for silverware, kind of hard to eat instant noodles with a soup spoon haha. Food... needs to be revised. The two slices of spam were not even cut straight and the mince pork over rice.. well... was probably 90% rice and 10% minced pork, a bit pricey at $7.25. A third spam and egg instant noodle also came out for my friend who came late and never ordered one. 

Drinks came out at the same time even though they were ordered 10 minutes apart and came with the thick straws without plastic wrap, would not be a huge issue if it wasn't for two of the workers coughing in their hands, at least cough in your elbow. The guy making the drinks was also drinking the leftover from the drink mixer... I don't mind if you want the leftovers... but at least pour it into a cup? 

Overall organization is definitely needed for improvement, a POS system, and... sorry to say, but a review on the districts health card movie.

I don't care about service (it's just a drink that i'm after), I do care about price (Pho Tahn Huong raised their price to $4.50 for a boba drink??? outrageous), and I do care about drink quality.

I had the boba milk tea THREE times (twice green, once black). Each time it was bland and watered down. Can I get some more syrup added or what? Perhaps I should try a different flavor, but my theory is that if you eff up the basics, how can you do the advanced?

I sound crazy, huh. Who is an elitist about boba? bwaha. 

Anyways, my conclusion is that I will be back. Why? Cuz I have an addiction and only because it is close to where I live.

There's a new late night spot to hang out in that isn't the Lied Library. It's equipped with free wi-fi, plenty of power outlets, and an arsenal caffeinated drinks to keep you jolted.

3pm Cafe offers a wide variety of teas ranging from fruit and milk teas, along with an assortment of smoothies and non-caffeinated beverages. You can come here hungry too, since they offer apps and entrees. Most of the menu consists of dishes originating from Taiwan, with some popular Japanese fare like chicken katsu bento boxes and katsu curry. After a brief chat with the staff, they seemed to take most pride in their homemade Taiwanese dishes, so it would probably be best to give those a try.

Here's what I tried on my first visit:
-Minced Pork Over Rice - A simple, yet very comforting Taiwanese dish.
-Iced Coffee Milk Tea w/ Boba - I admit that I'm not much of a boba drinker, but I enjoyed this. It was a refreshing beverage that catered to my coffee addiction.
-Popcorn Chicken - I was brought out a sample of this dish. It was a bit salty, but in a satisfying way. It was very tender and flavorful. I wouldn't mind getting this over rice.

Walking in, you get some top-notch service, with clarification on menu items if you're unsure of what to get. The staff never hesitated to make sure I was happy with my meal. I even had a sweet little old lady come out to check if I liked the food. Apparently, she was the mind that went behind the delicious recipes on the menu.

I could definitely see myself regularly dropping by this spot for a quick lunch or for a much-needed study session.

Went in with a couple of my girls and it had nice wide windows and the sunlight was streaming in on two sides of the room. The walls were a charcoal color, chic white lighting hanging from the ceiling, and comfortable square seats with matching tables. Complete with the cutest salt and pepper shakers. The menu was straightforward listing things such as different types of milk tea, smoothies, teas, apps, entrees and additional toppings. Free wi-fi as well? Overall a 4/5

Food &Milk Tea: 
1. Coconut Milk Tea, Thai Milk Tea & Milk Tea: Served in large square glass jars. It was a pretty good amount of milk tea and even more boba pearls lining the bottom. I was so excited when it came out because it was so pretty and it certainly didn't disappoint in terms of quantity. QUALITY however can be approved on. My drink, the coconut, lost much of the coconut flavor because of so much ice, or perhaps they don't use enough flavoring? It tastes like powder mix, but I'm not a boba expert. What I do know is that I've been to many places with better coconut taste. The boba pearls itself was a little more on the chewier side, which I liked. One of my friends though said the inside wasn't fully cooked and was too hard. 
2. Popcorn Chicken (appetizer): Now this time it's opposite of the milk tea. Not much quantity, but makes up for it in quality. Good salty flavor, packs a whole lot of flavor and is the right amount of crispy. However, such a tiny portion for amount paid. 
3. 3pm Fusion Fries: Really liked these, but again overpriced. They kind of reminded me of Fukuburger's Jazz fries with the Japanese mayo, brown savory gravy sauce and furikake sprinkles. Still not worth it to pay over $3 for this and I was charged over $6. 
Overall a 3/5.

Service: 
The guy at the counter was very helpful, explaining the menu to us and answering our questions. He was polite and friendly. Let us know that we could use our Rebelcards for 10% off which was great! He served us our food and drinks (3 milk teas) within minutes of each other, aaand cleared our plates after we were finished and asked us how everything was. Overall a big fat 4/5. 

To me, the most important thing about the restaurant business is the food and cleanliness. Our main goal was to get boba and I left full and satisfied, what with the boba outlasting the milk tea. I'd give this place another try, but honestly?The milk tea flavoring needs a make-over.",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,1,1,3,Pv5q7BEOPh-3TWZiwEq9JA

Reasonable prices and good variety of smoothies, slushies, and flavored teas. Haven't tries their food, but I like their teas. My fav is their mango green tea. They make sure that the flavor is infused by shaking it, not just stirred. Fast wi-fi and UNLV students get 10% discount if you bring your student ID with you. He also has a stamp card, never really asked how many I need to get a free drink, I just have him stamp it every time. Lastly, you can't beat their location. It's right across UNLV, right next to Pita Pit. So I can get my ""healthy"" lunch next door then head here to study for hours.",x7WYJzuBdYqM9PpSoNkM1Q,0,0,5,RCegBS9DCZ_7rfO3IRiV3w
4571792,2012-03-08,4,fd6iX0qDBTX51IwFJjh1bw,"Finally this place has opened!  A dark little cafe next to the new Pita Pit and Cafe Rio, 3pm Cafe offers boba drinks, teas, smoothies and Taiwanese snacks and entrees.  The tables are unique with corner-shaped chairs.  Wifi is free: the phone number!  There are lots of outlets so you can hang out and study.  The hours are good, early to late and great for the nearby student.

I stopped in for lunch today and experienced great service.  I ordered one tea-flavored egg ($1.50, 3 are $3.25), a fried tofu appetizer, and an off-the-menu avocado boba smoothie.  The smoothie came first in a huge mason jar - I ordered the regular but it almost appeared like mine was large!  It is more sweet tasting than avocado tasting, but still good.  Next time I should go for almond milk tea because that is another favorite of mine.

The tea flavored egg came next.  I peeled it (I am terrible at hard boiled egg peeling but this was at least cracked for me in the kitchen).  Unraveling the shell bits was an almost tie-dyed egg, a beautiful contrast of brown shades.  It was a bit salty, and the yolk over hard (I am partial to eggs without grey-shrouded yolks) but it was a new experience nonetheless and not bad.

Lastly, the tofu appetizer.  Mini fried and marinated tofu squares with salt and pepper sprinkled on top.  Tasty and simple.  With the drink, definitely filling.  The server graciously put my mason jar smoothie into a to go cup.  I will definitely come back again.  There are also daily specials and this week a 10% off discount with RebelCard.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,6,5,4,oxUqpc9QbEbIGhvuRrRs8Q
5096637,2012-05-05,0,fd6iX0qDBTX51IwFJjh1bw,"You are a Boba place.  You should have Boba.

Two days in a row I have been here and been told that there is no more Boba.  This time, it was at 5:30 pm, well before the business closes for the evening (1 am).  The milk tea is okay, but not worth driving and spending my hard-earned cash to come here, only to be told that there is no Boba YET AGAIN.

My fiance's milk tea tasted entirely different than it did the day before.  It was disgustingly sweet and watery.  I strongly dislike inconsistency, so this was a big downer for me.  I also had the pleasure of witnessing the girls making my drink discussing how they ""really didn't know how I make a Thai tea"".  Really??!?  I guess that's why it took over twenty minutes for them to figure out how to do it, even though our drinks were the only ones they were making at the time.  Maybe if there was a long line of orders I would be more understanding... but instead, I was steamed.  I wanted to hop behind the counter and make my own drink.  It would have been quicker.

The tea that was used in my drink was sitting out in a big, warm, frothy vat.  Yummy.  The evaporated milk came from an already-opened can that looked all crusty on the sides.  Worse yet, they didn't put any ice in the cup, so I was left with the unobscured sight of odd orange floaties drifting around in my tea.  Ick.  I threw my drink away.  Between the warm temperature, oddly frothy texture, and random mystery floaters, I knew it wouldn't go down the hatch without a fight from a very unwilling stomach. (SEE NASTY PHOTO)

Save your money. It's not worth it.  Go to a real Boba place... You know, where they sell Boba.  This place is vile.",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,1,0,1,GYJn6vOwtRjkEGSTOcnwIg
5199623,2012-04-06,2,fd6iX0qDBTX51IwFJjh1bw,"Vegas definitely needs more of this: comfortable cafes with free WiFi and a generous camping policy! I was able to meet with a couple of people and complete work over the course of 3 hours, and I didn't receive the evil eye once! 

I had no problem with service. In fact, the server repeatedly checked in on me and even offered water. I ordered an unsweetened green tea with boba. The tea quality was as expected, but the boba were a bit below average- a bit smaller and without any distinct flavor. I also ordered the popcorn chicken for a snack, and when it came out, the appearance was not promising. However, it tasted pretty darn delicious. 

Overall, as a place for lunch or dinner, perhaps not so much, but if you' need a post near UNLV to post up for some meetings, remote working and refreshment, they do the job very nicely.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,8,7,3,rSONu2ny69yokwzVHKfCug

This was a perfect spot.

My server was super friendly and very attentive.  I stayed there for two hours and didn't feel like they were wanting to kick me out. 

People have mentioned the food being overpriced.  Nothing on the menu is more than $8.00 and while the portions aren't huge they aren't tiny either.  

Downsides are the service was a little on the slow side so if you are in a rush this might not be the best choice and the food choices are minimal.  And boo that the 10% discount is only for UNLV students.  I go to NSC and UNLV honors our id just like their own.  

Still will definitely come here when I am at UNLV.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,0,0,3,0ces4UNSZMrFQ0xSo_FuNA

It was empty. That wasn't too surprising as it was 8/13/12 - during the 3rd summer session at UNLV. It's the most dead semester of the year. We ordered popcorn chicken, but they were fresh out. The friendly guy working the cash register went above and beyond to make up for the fact that they were out. He gave me boba for free in my drink... and upgraded the size. That was pretty awesome of him. 

My coworker got the chocolate toast and I got fries that were the special. They had black and white mayonnaise on them. They were okay. Nothing I'd crave, but the sauce was good. 

Overall, I'd probably hit the place up for more boba, because honestly, who doesn't like boba?",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,0,0,3,Zd4ytg3tR_gqw9eAem2Qgw
5725813,2012-04-22,1,fd6iX0qDBTX51IwFJjh1bw,"I stopped by here with some friends, after having lunch at the Pita Pit next door.  They opened at 1pm that Saturday apparently due to maintenance earlier that day.  We walked in at around 1:15pm and was told that their boba wouldn't be ready for another 15 minutes.  Not a big deal, but not good considering that boba is probably the main thing people want in their drinks.  Instead of waiting, I decided to try their lychee instead.  

I ended up getting a Mango Green Tea with Lychee.  We were the only ones in there, so the drink was made quickly.  When I got the drink, though, I found two strands of hair floating at the bottom near the lychee.  How does that even happen? I told the server (who didn't even apologize BTW), and she quickly tossed it and re-made the drink.  Already grossed out, I analyzed the new drink and noticed a few black specs floating around the bottom.  It might have been from the tea, or it might have not.  I took a few sips anyway, and it tasted decent.  I eventually tossed the drink though, because I couldn't get over the stuff floating around.

First time I've ever had hair in a drink.  With this being my first time there, I don't plan on going back. It's too bad because it's in a great location right across campus.
