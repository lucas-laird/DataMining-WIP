613505,2014-09-27,1,ISeb4rh50T02uADLTok9TA,"I will NEVER order from Pop's again. I do NOT recommend ordering delivery. We placed our order and told it would be at our apartment in 30 minutes. A good 1 hour later, we had to call to ask where our food was & were also told the delivery person had left 20 minutes before that. Almost an hour and a half later, cold food was delivered to our door. At least they refunded our money, but it doesn't make up for the fact that we now have to eat pizza that is cold & hard. On top of it, they didn't give us the desert we ordered. Extremely poor service. I don't even know how they are in business. We should have just gone to Grimaldi's.",47uVyOwF0nEbIrbNiI9HBg,1,0,1,uUV-0nCCGy8-JZaoBwmgdA

The crust, which is somewhat New York style, was good but otherwise I didn't think the pizza was very tasty. My friend, on the other hand, did enjoy it.",4yCgyrh6pZGZexYTeF9jhw,1,0,3,FGqOxNBrsoSYLZYvQwTS8w

My friend and I were greeted and told about the limited selection due to closing soon. This was fine we only wanted a few (3) slices total.

The light employee with glasses took our order and washed his hands, promptly.

The darker employee(male) made sure to take his time sweeping in front to the soda machine and left the trash can lid in our way to let us know we were in his territory and we should leave. The dark female was also nice enough to let me know I was in her way as she brought trays to the counter and forced me away instead of walking an addition 5 more feet around the counter.

Pizza was decent. Nice crisp crunch. (supreme) Vegetables tasted fresh.


Only real complaints here are: 
 1) Soda lids:
      A) They stuck together
      B) You couldn't make them stay on the cup.

 2) Dimly lit store

 3) Passively aggressive darker employes.",cPnc8-nSdNb9FKPYYwwOHQ,0,0,3,pMnpnfhuNNtI3v4ZIZDrCQ

It's cheap compared to food in the hotels and they sell pizza by the slice. With that being said, I wouldn't order a whole pizza here...it's not THAT good. I ordered a slice of pepperoni, ham and sausage pizza. It was okay for one piece, but I wouldn't want more than that. I only ate about half, but I did eat the crust because another yelper said the crust was amazing. It was really good.

The location of this place isn't the best area, it's in a shady little strip mall. For this reason, I wouldn't reccomend taking kids there. If you do, go early! The strip mall also has a Panda Express, McDonald's, Liquor store, Donut House, and a gas station next door.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,1,1,4,EG8n5kXLhBUeM1LB9i98gw

Nice small strip eatery, next to the McDonalds across the street from Manadalay Bay.  Locally owned and operated which is always nice to see!!  

The missing 5th star is because the salad could use some work, it's iceberg lettuce (yuck) with mozarella, onions and tomatos - although the raspberry vinaigrette was tasty!   They have a combo deal - $7.95 for two slices of cheese ($0.50 upcharge for other toppings) and a drink or one slice, a salad and a drink.  Oh!  And the tiramisu and cheese cake are delicious!!

They're open till 1AM during the week, 3 AM on weekends.  It's really pretty busy around lunch time with a mix local folks stopping in for lunch and tourists looking good quick pizza at a nice price!",evS0cCehNU_EiDiD3286Jw,0,0,4,iheTKqGHdnWLY-EbqOaxyQ

Pop's was across from my hotel (Mandalay Bay) and I wasn't in the mood for a $40-100 meal so I found pop's on yelp and walked over. 7.95 for a slice of cheese,  side salad and a 21oz drink. .. not bad for Vegas. Pizza was decent but it was fresh out of the oven hot. It's kinda hard to mess up or judge a slice of cheese lol. The salad was fresh and the ranch was yummy. I also ordered garlic Knotts 5 for 2.99 sooo good. If you want cheap and fast and your down on that end of strip, it's worth a try.",taOXwlF45HWASmuGgDyKEg,1,0,3,4XBvJg2qlzGEpKw68ThzAw

The toppings did not seem to really stand out. After eating the pizza I got kind of sick but I don't necessarily blame the pizza.

Ordered the vegetarian. I was hungry and just wanted  some decent pizza it met my cravings. I ate the large by myself so it's not that much pizza since it's such a thin crust. It does have a chewy crust. I would maybe go back again.",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,3,TXbLFjczqXT-YzExcu1JkA

Super bomb pizza for my tasting and definitely good size slices for the price. Customer service was awesome especially with Nikki (sorry if misspelled) as she was very polite and answered some questions about cool things in the area. Atmosphere was very laid back as there was also a TV to watch the game. Definitely reccomend and probably will return ;),e3RT37kKM4fMe9ydJt8VJQ,0,0,5,3kW5LYzSqz5oHpjHq3RsUw
5498994,2014-10-16,3,ISeb4rh50T02uADLTok9TA,"Visited this place because it was open late at night and had a four-star average on Yelp.

Are you kidding me? How blind stinking drunk are the people who stagger into this place that they mistake this for food, let alone four-star quality good pizza?

We ordered two slices of plain. The pizza looked like it hadn't been fresh since the Mob ran Vegas. But it probably wouldn't have been any better fresh. The tomato sauce was cloyingly acidic, the cheese was dry, the cardboard - I actually meant to type ""crust"" there, no kidding, that was a freudian slip but you know what? I'll keep it.

We literally ate one bite of our slices, threw them in the trash, and went to get pizza somewhere else.

This was literally the worst pizza I've ever eaten in my life - and I've had a Little Caesars Pretzel Crust.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,0,0,1,KrPP1w4yMkA2uCcWro4Ykg

This is such a late post, I don't remember much of the details, but do remember that I liked their pizza.

What stuck out for me was that their crust.  Good, firm crust with a crumby texture.  Texture ties it all together every time!

I wouldn't say it's a must-try, but it is good enough that if you are in the neighborhood and hungry for pizza, you can't go wrong here!",vNqJm3mlYnqxFrLBi_NViQ,3,2,4,LIbQxpvgnfmbX955TeQEAQ
