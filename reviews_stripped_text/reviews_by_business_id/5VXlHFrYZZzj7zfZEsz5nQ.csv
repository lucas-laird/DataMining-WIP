I had a really yummy mango flavored drink with jalape√±os, my husband had a very smooth cold sake served in ice. I saw they had hamachi served as a roll and asked if they offer hamachi kama. The server informed us that it wasn't on the menu only to return with a generous offer that the chef had it and was willing to make it anyway. ^_^ It was grilled to perfection with crispy salty skin and moist tender meat! With such a great chef, it would make a great addition to the menu! The service was exceptional and we will come back on our next trip.",hnMhR691v6oW9Se30sNK3w,0,0,4,yXEI6Qd5__ULeC_y1VYNBQ
26081,2016-05-04,0,5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,"My wife won a $100 dinning credit at the Monte Carlo so we decided to try Dragon Noodle. The lady who booked the reservation (Mellanesa) was a bit on the rude side but after several conversations she said that she booked our reservations for 7pm.
We showed up at 7 and there was no reservation and no one knew about the $100 dinning credit. After explaining to the staff for the 20th time that we were locals and we won from a radio station they asked me to speak with someone on the phone.  I explained the entire situation to VIP services and they told me to call back when their supervisor gets back from lunch.... Ummm ok. 
This kind of killed the mood of dinner and all we really wanted was someone to follow through with what was happening. Eventually this was fixed but after emailing Mellanesa, all she replied with was, ""I personally walked down and made the reservation."" Out of site, out of mind type of attitude!
This is a customer service based city and no one felt the need to tend to the guest.
The food was ok, extremely overpriced for the quality, we could have went somewhere closer to home and paid a lot less then what we were charged. The Monte Carlo F&B director and Dragon Noodle manager need to sit down and examine this place.",BFx0LcvuYpO-Q2wTvcd7SQ,0,0,2,0a4Lrs9n8TlAlW79oe_EYg

147726,2013-06-27,2,5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,"I really wanted to put one star, but the manager lady was fair enough and partially resolved a problem I had there. My stay at Vegas this week, I looked up their website's menu and the price excited me seeing it was better than other place. As the saying goes, ""not all cheap things are great."" 

First let me say there was this Asian man who took my order, who was a little rude. He did not really listen to what I had to say, and he came to me with the check when we were done and literally coughed without covering his mouth on my face, and told me ""the suggested gratuity is 20%"" and that I should pay this amount. It was just a party of two, and our total came out to around $50, so the gratuity suggested of $9. 

All well known and better restaurants say at the bottom of all their menus that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill of ""parties of 8 or more."" He was telling me to pay a ""20% gratuity"" of only a party of two.

Okay, it's not just that, I was really disappointed in the food as well. While I was eating, I kept thinking that I rather be eating panda express. It's the worse dinner, and course of meal i've ever had especially I'm eating in Vegas. I wanted what I imagined to be vegetable stir fry, but the guy who took my order, before I could spot it on the menu, said it as ""salt and pepper"" which I didn't catch with the accent, and speaking fast before I could finish ordering, sorry that had to be mentioned. You can say I was pretty wrong to assume he understands what I wanted. What i had was an appetizer like menu which costed more than a similar appetizer menu I had. There were 2 salt and pepper menu in front of me, because I had also ordered a calamari salt and pepper. I should've made sure, but when the food came I just couldn't satisfy my hunger, because it was plain weird and salty. 

Of course it was weird, because I got something different than what I really wanted to order.

I wanted to pay for everything and accept my fault, until the server placed the receipt, coughed on my face, and told me to pay a 20% gratuity which no restaurant had ever done to their customer. You simple leave the check, walk out, and whatever you get, you get. Since he was rude I thought I'd speak up about what I didn't like, so an Asian manager lady gave me a half price off the wrong order made. You can say it was better than paying a big price for something you didn't like.",lv3dfST5W4wPOCFfokM9wg,1,0,2,ZBkW5aiOOLBCke8e5JdWOQ

The bf and I stayed at the Monte Carlo so we did pass it a few times earlier.  Each time looked dead inside, which is a tell-tale sign of a junk restaurant.  There was another party that was just being seated, so we figured it can't be that bad.  We said F- it, let's go.  The waitress led us to the back room which is completely hidden from the front, and this room was PACKED!  Every table was filled, so that gave me hope that maybe this won't be that bad after all.  

We ordered a few orders of Hamachi sushi, the Tiger Maki roll, char siu bao (steamed pork buns), and Hong Kong Style Chow Mein.  The Hamachi was OK, I want to say just a little better than Genki Sushi quality, but I did like that they added avocado on top.  Everything else was fantastic.  We tried the HK Style Chow Mein because we are used to having all the other noodles so often back home, so we just wanted to try something new.  It was pretty good!

Service was acceptable, our waiter wasn't super friendly (not smiling, not really talking story or anything) but he was professional and didn't give us attitude.  It was busy so I didn't expect the server to be waiting on us every moment but he made sure our water was always filled, and brought me green tea when I asked.

- General Tso's chicken - Again, a pretty decent portion. Crunchy battered chicken slathered in sauce. Pretty good, nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about.
- Sesame Ball - This one I consider good. It's crunchy outside, soft inside, how I like my sesame ball.

Overall, the food is pretty good. It's more American chinese than authentic chinese, but that's to be expected considering the venue. Price is on the high side, but considering the location and the portion, IMO this place is less overpriced than other Strip restaurants.

There were 7 of us, we were seated promptly and politely by the host, but upon being seated, our server (who was Chinese, as well as we are) was absolutely rude to us. My family didn't really speak English so I was going to order for them when she told me to shut up and let them order for themselves so that she wouldn't get confused later. I was about to get mad but then thought: OK, if it'll help this less-than-smart woman, fine. My family had a hard time ordering, and when my father, who spoke Cantonese (we heard the server spoke in Cantonese to another customer and was basically kissing their ass*s), she did not reply to him and simply walked away after taking his order.

We were perplexed but since we were hungry, we thought, well, let's just not tip her for her rudeness. That was when my father thought, if our server DARES to be that rude, the tip was obviously already automatically added. Hmmmm.... After a while, she came back with our soups and I asked her if I could get an extra plate, she simply looked at me and walked away!!!

The food came after a while, and guess what? She had to ask who ordered what, even after telling me to shut up. The food itself was horrid and our server never came back with my extra plate. She was running here and there even though there were only 3 other tables that needed to be waited AND there was another server! I had a feeling that she was ignoring us on purpose and soon enough, she sent the other server to attend to us.

For reasons I could not and will never get, she decided to be rude to us. This was the worst service I have ever had, and my father was right. The bill came to us (from the other server), and an 18% gratuity was already automatically added. Me and my husband was so offended that we walked to the host and informed her how rude our server was and that she was ignoring our requests. The host then apologized, promised that she would take off the 18% gratuity, and that she would talk to the server.

When we turned around, we were very surprised to see that the server was standing right behind me, waiting to talk to the host (what are the odds of her standing right behind me, wanting to talk to the host when we are complaining about her?? -to me it looked like she was trying to eavesdrop with the pretension of wanting to talk to the host-)

In the end, the host took off the 18% gratuity and we left no tip whatsoever for her. I would NEVER come back to this restaurant, even if someone pays me to do it. I was extremely offended.",Kxm3Xx0Ys9JR0pI4nKKIZA,2,0,1,sdse7_WNNNKP3YjpuLc-Uw

The is in Monte Carlo, pretty much a has-been hotel with all the new buildings within the vicinity but still a great hotel nonetheless.  We went here for lunch and ended up making it our goto place for the next two days of our stay.  Why I'm surprised is because of the decors...very stereotypical Asian decors which caters mostly to Caucasian customers....so I thought.

We sat at the table then going through the menu, we saw various non-authentic Asian dishes which supported my visual impression of the restaurant...but the old saying goes, never judge a book by its cover.

She ordered the roasted duck with wonton noodles and I ordered the dried scallop fried rice.  Both were beyond my expectations.  The wonton noodles does not have the ammonia odor which usually accompanies it and the fried rice was cooked to perfection with very little oil.  We've been to LV Chinatown before and the garbage we had there is not comparable...you'll get your typical oily Chinese food in Chinatown.  The food met my standards and is better than some of the local restaurants in Vancouver.

The next two days, we ordered the pho, bbq wonton noodles, and udon.  All our orders came with lots of meat and was very filling.  The meats were on the salty end but it mixed well with the noodles.

The prices are a bit steep but very reasonable on the Strip...plus if I have to take a cab to Chinatown to eat something less worthy, the bill adds up to about the same.

*edit* also to add, we found out the chef at this place used to work at a very high end Chinese restaurant so explaining the quality of the food...but if possible the meats should be less salty for my taste.",Vgd5B5h9wfHEAi0PZpTJWA,0,0,5,QAEKZG58xwIrOU51rOZiGQ

We thought we didn't fill it out completely so we filled it out and went to go look for a ATM. He chased after us again and started demanding that we tip and that we have to tip $17 for the chef, busser, hostess, and server. And it just turned into a very uncomfortable situation.

We arrived around 7:00 and the restaurant was not busy at all, which was nice as we had a large group of 8.  I ordered the California Volcano roll, which is my absolute favorite roll!  Not every restaurant has this roll (a california roll topped with spicy tuna), so I was excited to have it!  The roll was fresh, and an appropriate serving size for a reasonable price (especially on the strip).  I also ordered a side of pork spring rolls, which was mediocre -- I wouldn't order it again.

My friend and I also shared the ""Volcano"" drink, which is a mixture of various types of alcohol and fruit juices.  In the middle of the drink, there's a shot of Bacardi 151 that is lit on fire!  It was a lot of fun to drink, and got us pretty tipsy.  In fact, we ordered a second drink to share, so we basically drank one each.  The drink was pretty expensive, but considering it was supposed to be shared by two people, it was a good value.

The service was a little strange, but I think it was mostly because of the language barrier.  We asked the server a couple of questions (most importantly, can we drink the alcohol that was set on fire or was it lighter fluid?), but she did not really understand us.  The timing of the food being served was strange, as some people received their food much earlier than the others. 

Overall, I would return to Dragon Noodle Co, but it really is just a place to grab a quick bite of sushi and a drink.  Do not take anyone here on a date or for a special occasion, as it is very casual and low-key with traditional Chinese decor.",VjmDfDsK9iogVNuaGIBMvw,0,2,4,Pd2_IBCvOda-EYN7AIdq3Q

shortest version possible:

There were 10 of us. 
We waited forever for a server. Once the server came, he didn't seem to know what to do. It took him quite a while to get our drink order and bring them to the table. Finally he took our meal orders. The food kept coming for different people at different times over a 1 hour period. One couple was still waiting on one of their sushi; turns out the servers had brought it out 45 minutes prior and had put it on someone else's plate. No server ever came back to the table to ask if everything was okay. After sitting there for a while, my husband chased down our server so we could all cash out. Cashing out was a nightmare. My husband and I didn't order drinks, nor did another couple. However, they brought the check on one ticket. We told them to split it. They split it into equals sets of 5. $69 per person! Absolutely NOT! One couple only had a salad, appetizer and tea for crying out loud! I told the server, ""NO...we need them to be split to what we ate."" after 30 minutes, me and a friend left to go gamble. It took another 40 minutes for the guys to cash out after the girls had left. Unbelievable. 

I think the kicker was the next day when my husband, along with a friends husband, called to complain, even meet with the manager. But, all they got was the run around. They knew we were one of many Las Vegas tourist who they wouldn't see again, probably ever. They offered to comp our next meal. But, the experience from the night before left us all so upset, we declined.

Coral reef drink, delicious!

Beef noodle soup we had some issues with. My husband ordered the Chinese style but was given Thai style. We were hungry enough so he ate it but he wasn't happy with the mix up when he not only said it, but pointed to it on the menu as well. He added wontons to it and they were stuffed full with meat. Broth of the soup was very tasty, but wasn't what he was hoping for because of the order mixup.

After exploring many restaurants, one night we were feeling a little indecisive. We ended up coming back to our hotel (The Monte Carlo) & decided to go to Dragon Noodle Co. after remembering some adverts from the elevators in the hotel.

We scanned the menu, which was average but it looked like it could put something together quite easily for me (being that I'm vegan). We were seated quickly & courteously by the girl at f.o.h. and she let us know who our server would be. From there, the entire experience went down-hill.

Firstly, our server left us with menu's and didn't come back for 15 minutes. I'm all for being given time to decide, but we just couldn't get his attention. We came to realise quite quickly this was due to the two large tables (one seated after us) that were sat adjacent to us, one with 6 the other with 10. The server provided us with the bare minimum of service (actually less) and he was clearly making sure his tip at the end of service was good with these tables.

When my girlfriend and I placed our orders, he had complied that a dish variation of one on the menu could be made vegan, no problem. He advised it was a ""special order"". In addition, he did not ask us for drinks or provide us with a drinks menu. We waited 45 minutes and I had to get the attention of another server in order to ask what the delay was- ""it's taking some time to prepare your order, but it will be ready soon!"" I ordered Szechuan vegetables & tofu with noodles. 

My girlfriends dish arrived before mine. She stated it was bland and lacked any flavour. My dish still hadn't arrived and I asked again, what was the delay? No answer but ""I'll check with the chef"". My dish came back with the server and I couldn't have been more angry- saut√©ed onions and tofu on fried noodles. No szechuan, no sauce. Nothing. When I tried to get the server's attention, again, impossible.

I had to leave our table to find a member of staff willing to talk to me. I explained the situation and massive delay with the answer ""what would you like me to do about it?"". So I asked to speak to the manager- another 15 minute wait. I explained the situation to the manager, how frustrated, disgusted and angry I was with the server's attitude and the terrible dishes. I stated that I would pay for my girlfriends meal (which was half eaten) but not mine (which I didn't touch) and that we wanted to leave. He understood and apologised, stating he would not charge us for either. I appreciate that the manager was kind, polite and did not charge us, but it did not make up for the situation and the hour-and-a-half we had spent there.

Incredibly poor service, rude staff, ridiculous wait time for food that had nothing to it and lack of service simply because we were a table of two and not six. The first restaurant I have ever walked out of mid-meal. Don't waste your time here!",oxy3IArlE7eo7nsuSvOvsA,3,1,1,GjV2pWLdT_Uu2Yzgpz0EOQ

Located in the Monte Carlo hotel. I thought it might just be convenient to stay close. The place looks very nice. Very good atmosphere for groups or couples.

So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.

I was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.

The heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the d√©cor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.

Three menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.

My bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.

The roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  

It took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.

We noticed also that on Sundays they have happy hour starting at 5 p.m. Well we arrived at 4:51 p.m. and the dumb bang waitress would not let us even sit down until 5 p.m. if we wanted to order off the happy hour menu. Mistake numero uno. So we watched the tail end of the Raiders game and then finally were allowed to sit. Not sure if the idiots here cannot understand english or what but every question I asked just proceeded a confused expression and an attitude. 

Come to find out it is half off appetizers and sushi for happy hour BUT you have to sit at the sushi bar to get half off sushi and you have to sit at the regular bar to get half off appetizers. We ended up just getting sushi and what a mistake. For being only one of three groups in the place my rolls took so long you would think there was a fisherman out back reeling in my spicy tuna. And not only that but exactly when I picked up my last bite the dumb bang waitress comes over and takes my plate away before i could even dip it in soy sauce. Then it took us another ten minutes to hunt someone down for the damn check. 

The food in general was okay. Nothing special. I was very disappointed with the service. It was down right miserable and literally put my entire group in a bad mood. I will NEVER eat here again due to the horrific service.",NDnON2ZwuLGklRYA15_Nfw,4,2,2,znRcjseSiQ9H0wchxzlAGQ

So, I was staying in the Monte Carlo and figured I'd give their restaurants the old college try.  Brand steakhouse is wonderfully awesome, but I'm not at all impressed with this Dragon Noodle place.  First off, the prices!  Yikes!  I don't remember exactly what I had since it was that unmemorable, but i'm pretty sure I had several varieties of nigiri sushi, sunomono, miso soup, and a glass of plum wine, and my friend had a chicken or beef dish.  Whatever it was, the total was a lot over $100.  I mean, you'd have thought I had bird's nest soup for goodness sakes.  I will say that the quantity of food was pretty large, but it was not all that great.  I have definitely had better sushi, and whatever beef/chicken the friend had was oh so gross.   We had a ton of leftovers to take back to the room - which promptly went in the trash since the smell of garlic was so pungent it burned off some of my nose hairs.

I didn't like the texture of the noodles, best way I can describe it would be chewing on hair.

one - for the service.  drinks were kept full.  food was out promptly.  table was ready when we came in.  bazingo!

two (as in, star number two) - for the soup.  $5 for a giant bowl, i'm down.  thanks for helping me out.  i was sick when we ate here and really wanted some soup to battle the insane freeze outside.  and for $5 at a casino restaurant?  i'll take that!

three - the rest of the food.  chicken was extra crispy with just enough sauce.  fried rice came with a giant portion (again, surprising for a casino restaurant) that we struggled to finish the next day (our left overs).  chow mein was nicely seasoned - not too much soy sauce, and the chicken actually had its own flavor (as in, marinated separately then put in, not just mixed in with the noodles to soak up the regular flavor).  oh oh oh, and they have my shrimp rice noodle on their dim sum menu - yeah :)!!!

four - very reasonable price.  go with the lunch menu and have enough food for now and later (and with ice cream!!!!).  dim sum is not LA chinatown price, but if you must, I guess you could go for that too and not spend too much.  but if you can, go for the lunch menu or dinner combo options - for 2-4 people, depending on how hungry each one of you are, you could definitely be getting some bazingo for your buck.

and five - because we always eat here free.  usually with food & beverage comp or using some of our actual comp, we never pay to eat here.  making every meal, extra delicious (of course, please pay tip!  comp never covers that!)",wa40Yx8wrZfiRqTgZsdd0g,3,1,5,VzPwxkJbNpYBYV3cP9kyGA
2927155,2011-11-18,3,5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,"Back in 2009 when Don and I were just dating, I kept telling him about a ""Cosplay Lounge"" that was opening up in Vegas. I never got around to going and soon forgot about it because it didn't gain much popularity (nothing even pops up when typed into Yelp). Forward almost three years later and Don was taking me on a ""surprise"" lunch date. He parked at Monte Carlo and I had no idea where we were going. I never even knew where the Cosplay Lounge was located, so that's totally not what I was expecting. We turned the corner and he said, ""This is it!"" and I was still confused, because it said ""Dragon Noodle Co."" which didn't ring a bell at all. That's when said, ""It's the Cosplay Lounge!""

We walked past the completely empty lounge area and into the restaurant where there were only two other people dining. The waiter brought out our menus and told us there were currently lunch specials and dim sum. I noticed Don looking around all disappointed and he told he he was confused because he expected to at least see someone dressed in costume, but not a single person was. When the waiter came back, Don asked him about the ""Cosplay Lounge"" and the waiter gave him this extremely puzzled look like he had no idea what he was talking about. So Don started describing it and talking about the costumes and the guy said, ""Ooooh, that's not all the time. It's just at night on weekends."" By the way he answered, it sounded like he was even unsure of that. I have a feeling they don't even do the ""Cosplay"" thing anymore, but I could be wrong. 

After getting over the whole situation, we went ahead and ordered two lunch specials: Mongolian Beef ($9.95) and Orange Chicken ($9.95). Both came w/ soup, rice, and a Spring roll. On top of that we also ordered Salt & Pepper Calamari ($8.25) and Steamed Pork Siu Mei ($3.50). The Calamari was very different. It didn't come with any sauces and it came on a bed of lettuce with onions and jalapenos on top. We both really enjoyed it. Rather than relying on the sauce for the flavor, the dry toppings gave it all the flavor it needed and the jalapenos were a nice little kick. The Orange Chicken was alright, nicely breaded and cooked. The Mongolian Beef, however, was WAY TOO SAUCY. This pic I took: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/deeOpEHwPHQpXvF7YYPIcA/l.jpg doesn't even detail the amount of sauce that was on it because the lighting was poor. It was like someone was having a water balloon fight in the kitchen, except with water balloons filled with sauce and one of them accidentally landed and exploded on top of my Mongolian Beef. I just stuck to everything else on my plate and picking off Don's plate. 

Overall, the two things I liked about this place were the ambiance and the Calamari. The service wasn't that great. The waiter only refilled our water once and that was when we asked him to do so when he brought out the bill. The only thing that would bring me back would be the Calamari and I'd probably order it to-go.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,3,2,YXtXTR1IfTgjKPIq0fcSaw

Just what I needed to soak up some of the liquor! Peter L told me he's never seen me eat so much before, so it must have been good, right?

So why 3 stars? The prices. $8 each for a Heineken and Asahi is outrageous! Why so pricey when the noodle soup and calamari were moderately priced?! And $25 for seafood chow fun? I don't remember what seafood was on the chow fun, but from the looks of my pic, nothing to justify charging $25.

Easy to find within the Monte Carlo, my fianc√© and I decided to sit at the bar and have an easy going, relaxed dinner with drinks. That's exactly what we got! Greeted by a friendly bartender, Wayne, we asked about beers, ordered our drinks and had them quickly. We wanted to order a little, eat, then order some more and that was perfectly fine with Wayne. Started off with the salt and pepper calamari and the jalape√±o popper roll, with unagi and eel sauce. Both delicious. The calamari is not your typical touristy ring-style calamari, but rather large yet tasty pieces, perfectly fried with a delicious relish of peppers, onion, salt, pepper and other seasonings. Quite tasty! The jalape√±o popper roll was fabulous as well. Not too hot, but a slower, almost smoky heat that creeps up as you savor each bite.  

We took a short break then ordered some miso soup...fabulously simple but flavorful, and then decided on two more rolls...the traditional Philly roll and their California Volcano roll with crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, green onion, avocado and sesame. Fabulously fresh with the delicate heat from the spicy tuna paired with the sesame overtones, this was probably my favorite bite tonight. 

Wayne was a great bartender and server with a friendly, relaxed demeanor who was also eager to please, offering suggestions and even samples of a draft beer I hadn't had. If I were in town longer I would definitely go back to try more items but will certainly make it a priority the next time I'm in Vegas.

It was decorated in a really cheesy Asian theme, replete with a creepy floating baby head that gave me the willies because its eyes were following me.

Food was subpar. I just wanted something small to tide me over so I ordered a won-ton soup. It was reminiscent of packaged supermarket stuff.  Really salty, yet bland.

I didn't pay much attention to what everyone else ordered but no one was too happy with their choices. One of our group had ordered fried rice and the vegetables in it were still frozen. Just unacceptable.

I know Yelp and Foursquare are two different things but the two of them working together enabled the enhancement of the Dragon Noodle experience.

Ordering the lettuce wraps and a few drinks easily put us over the $20.  The serving size was pretty generous for just 2 people.  It was enough to make 2 stuffed wraps.  1 of these well endowed wraps would have been enough.  The lettuce was also nice and very fresh.  A free California roll only makes it taste better.

Our sever had very little food knowledge and was not able to accurately describe the dishes or answer our questions.

An appetizer, two entrees, and a side of steamed rice came to $69.00.  If  you are at the Monte Carlo and just have to have Chinese food spend the money on a cab do not eat at dragon noodle.  If you do not want to leave the hotel go to Diablos and get the nachos.  

The chicken in the lettuce wraps were bland but with enough hoisin and soy sauce added they were okay.  The General Tso's chicken was bland.  The strongest flavor was the oil that the chicken was fried in. The battered shrimp tasted like they may have been frozen.  The flavor of the sauce was kind of like plain gelatin, with not a hint of the spice the menu said it had (or much of any other flavor for that matter).  

The menu indicated their walnut shrimp was in a ""mayo sauce"".  We asked if this like the typical honey walnut shrimp fond at many other Chinese restaurants.  Our server as seemed unfamiliar with honey walnut shrimp so we asked the her what the sauce was like.  First, she told us it was a white sauce. Figuring that she did not know what a white sauce was and that she was really just telling us the sauce was white, we asked if it was a little sweet perhaps with a little honey.  She said it was salty, oh but not too salty, just right.  Choking up the server's accounts of the dish to her apparent inexperience, we decided to give it a try thinking we knew what we were getting. The sauce turned out to be pretty much just mayonnaise, no other flavor.  It was basically frozen fried shrimp coated in a thinned out mayonnaise. I will eat just about anything and found it difficult to eat.  We sent it back but they still charged us for it.   

We ended up sending back the General Tso's chicken as well in exchange for their Beef Chow Fun which was not bad with a little So sauce added to it. It is pretty much the same as the Pad See Ew found at Thai places but with a much higher price.",gk_r8B9wtsNyOxlJ0LVueg,0,0,2,8oK2sbjtIS_PaklhoMbggQ

When the server (i think he was a manager) sat us at the table and we asked for the lunch menu, they didn't want to give it to us because they dont provide lunch menu for party of 6 or more. Now this made us really upset because when my dad called to make a reservation and asked if they have a lunch menu, they didnt inform us about this. Dinner menu is super overpriced and we ended up paying $124

Yes, it is the usual Vegas-strip thing... prices are gonna be high but I had and enjoyed a wonderful meal and honestly I don't think it was over-priced. 

 I had The Special Pho and I don't understand anyone who claims it does not have a depth of flavor. Either you don't know Pho or you lost $ on the tables/slots and decided to take it out in a review. It HAS depth of flavor. Yes, you need to customize it as you should - BUT that is what Pho is about... SMH.  

 I also had the pork&shrimp pot-stickers. Fantastic!!!! Really loved them. I chose to buy a large bottle of good Sake but only finished half of it (they let me take it up to my room which was great) and the entire bill was about $75 (including the $50 bottle of sake!!!). It was awesome and one of the best meals I had in a few months. 

 I will most likely grab lunch there before I leave Vegas this week....

So in to allllllllll of the bad:
* Menu is super basic looking, has all of their offerings but very little by the way if description. Not even pictures. Absolutely nothing mentioning portion size.
*Speaking of portion size: you're paying what I generally regard as the standard price for each dish but getting slightly less than half as much as you would at any proper Chinese food place.
*Atrocious service.
*Made an order of food and drinks. Only received drinks for two people out of four (a pot of overpriced tea with two cups), slowly after we received two soups for the drinkless people. Still no drinks. Then later received the appetizer platter for the drinkless people. Many minutes later we were presented with one plate of rice (out of four that were ordered). About 5 minutes after that we received one plate of friend rice for the drinkless peopel to split (which wasn't mentioned that it would be a split). Still no drinks and missing an order of rice for a person. Many minutes later, the waiter comes by and askes how is everything. We then had to tell him that he still forgot 2 drinks ( which he forgot what they were), an order of rice, and two orders of orange chicken. Then many minutes later we finally received drinks, with the orange chicken following a bit after... Still no rice for one fellow, just decided to cancel that order of rice.
*Additionally, there was no salt, pepper, sauce, or sugar at all on the table for the while meal ( we ended up asking for sugar).

Wow. 

Steer clear.

Oh yeah, the orange chicken was soggy and well more saltt than sweet/orange when it finally came around. 

96$ for 4 people, the worst service I've had in quite a while.

Final update: been waiting now for about 10 minutes to get the check and leave as quickly as possible. Barely ate any of the entree because it's super not great.",2gk15t6hi7qhukPsxjIP8g,0,0,1,M_KLIZ1fu_dPrHYtIR0g6w

Can't remember all the ingredients, but it had mango, rum and jalape√±os. Our bartender, Wayne (who was pretty much the coolest most down to earth guy in all of Vegas) warned us that it was pretty spicy. I said go light on the spice and it turned out to be one of the best drinks I've ever had in my life. Fresh jalape√±os garnish this baby and the flavor combination is something I never expected to work, but it so does. We liked it so much we ordered the full strength version just to compare.

The decor was quite nice, which makes you wonder why it's so empty? Maybe we just came during a bad weekend. However, they had some sort of baby mascot or something, because the odd baby face was plastered EVERYWHERE (i.e. menu, sign, above an archway) and gave me the slight creeps...

Anyway, they had a decent selection of soup noodles and non-soup noodles (hence the name). On each table they even had an ordering paper for sushi rolls, I suppose for when it's happy hour and people are more prone to order them 50%. However, we came too early during lunchtime and were less inclined to order them full price. I ended up ordering the soup noodles with BBQ pork/charsiu, while my boyfriend got the soup noodles with beef and wonton (for an extra fee). The noodles came out looking very hot and delicious, but upon tasting, were a little bland. Apparently the wonton were not worth the extra price either.

Once we finished, even though we were the only people left in the restaurant, we had the hardest time getting our waiter's attention to get our check...kind of silly. But it came with fortune cookies at least.

Our party ordered a beef chow fun plate among other things, then our waiter called our order back to us, everything was fine. Then everything went wrong. Our chow fun noodle plate didn't come with any noodles. When we informed our waiter of this he promptly said no we didn't order the chow fun dish, just the regular beef dish, even though he repeated it back to us.  We told him that we even pointed it out on the menu to him as he looked at it and wrote the order, which he then gave the excuse that he couldn't see it.

As an absolute rating of Chinese food, I'd say it's a solid 3. You'd expect to find this quality at a 24-hour joint in Hong Kong, which makes it very authentic, but quality is perfect for a reasonably drunk and happy crowd. Food is slightly saltier than I'd like, but when you're starving, it's excellent. However, the true test was mom. She didn't necessarily hate it, but wasn't a huge fan (mom hates 24-hour Chinese eateries). 

Noodles are soggy, calamari is over salted, and Cantonese roast duck is about as dry as asphalt. BUT the Peking duck was excellent, as was the fried scallop and egg white fried rice. Those 2 dishes earned top marks and made the whole dining experience worth 2 visits. 

So don't bother if you're looking for something on par with Fin at the Mirage, or even Red 8 at the Wynn. But if you're hungry or inexperienced with top-shelf Cantonese, this is a decent starting place.",qW2e3x21BMWlOr72WUoFug,3,1,3,Pjg8pXL_Sf9lIdl0p5xYUQ

We had tofu & spinach soup, pot stickers, salt & pepper asparagus and a pepper steak dish. The soup and pot stickers were good, but not amazing. I especially appreciated the large hunks of ginger in the soup broth.

Both the salt and pepper asparagus and sirloin with black pepper sauce were recommended to us. The asparagus is fried and served with lots of minced pepper, like a traditional salt and pepper dish. Now, it may sound picky, but it was too salty. Yes, I know it is SALT and pepper, but if there had been a little less salt, this would have made my ""dishes I dream"" of list. I think it is a delectable idea! I would order it again to see if they can get it perfect. The steak was tender and flavorful, and I would also recommend ordering it if you find yourself here.

So to make use of proximity we went here, hidden in the corner of the hotel. There was no wait and the restaurant looked about half full. The hostess was cool as was our waiter. He looked like he was also the bartender. 

He was great, constantly checking on us before and after we ordered. My girl had the ""soup noodles"" with chicken and vegetables and I got the ""soup noodles"" with roast duck. I don't know who wrote the menu, but that's how they wrote it. ""Soup noodles with...."" 

The soups came out in somewhat quickly. Normally that would be a plus for me, but in this case, not so much. I found that the noodles were a little undercooked and clumped together. The chef didn't dip them in hot water long enough to prevent them from sticking together before adding the broth. So it was like trying to eat a chewy birds nest. The roasted duck looked good, the skin was good, but the meat was very rubber like. And they prepared it in a way where it was mostly bones. So it was like eating bones with some duck meat. Very little duck meat. I've eaten a lot of duck, even at a lot of cheap Chinese restaurants. And this was the worst. Disappointing it was. The saving grace was the broth, which I thought was pretty good. 

Other than that I still tried to finish it all. We had a show to get to and not a lot of time to get to it. And for the what this cost, I didn't want to waste my money.

So we opted for a table.  I was very underwhelmed by the sushi selection.  Living in Wisconsin where the surrounding area has a population of 75k... our resturants have a much larger selection and more creative offerings.

5710391,2012-11-21,0,5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,Terrible food and ridiculously overpriced! Orderd beef noodle soup. Super salty and tons of MSG. Terrible service as well... Advice for people from China mainland or Taiwan: do not go to this restaurant!! You will be utterly disappointed. Go to Noodle Asia at Venetian instead.,fU4v8isFIMCyUi78DYt6Ew,0,0,1,0xlIBs5Hr38aNs5uowzJ3A

After giving them all the info they completly missed the point of what took place , offered no compensation , told me it wasn't their policy to do what happened to me and to check with my bank!! Bad move! Though in the end I WAS ONLY charged the amount of my bill. THE RESTRAUNT/SERVER put a HOLD on my credit card for an extra amount of money to guarantee a tip until it could be varified we paid one (cash)..=this happened and was wrong!!!!. TIPS ARE NEVER GUARANTEED!! Unless it is shown on the bill as when there is a large party. I signed for one amount and another amount was held hostage by this RESTRAUNT!! Bad business..",rIBStsFqfa2FoW15WDl86g,2,0,1,4IlaZ2kX5TN42nOcs_7dag

Their food is not like Panda Express but close behind. Not impressed with the favor of their food.

The skinny male host has a big attitude he wouldn't allow us to sit in a table for 6 because he said it was for 4 (it wasn't) so he gave us a table for 12. Manager finally moved us over.

Waiter was nice and on top of things. Table was very sticky.

A little overpriced for what you get.",beMkFfyPUB2LORU1ponmwg,0,0,3,vC6hwNvSMs96hXMJdtyOHg

Didn't want to taste it again after all.  Calimari was bland.  P.F. Changs is way better.,houWsX8qe8-nH9W1LbzXkA,0,0,1,XFBPK2tUIKfwjxcHymhamw

We were greeted n seated right away.. But the place was empty so.. We ordered chicken noodle,  upon, salt n pepper calamari, and lettuce wraps.. Everything was goood.. Nothing special.. Just plain decent. The only thing I would say I didn't like is the calamari, not salt n peppery at all and the batter was greasy and doughy. My chicken noodle soup was ok.. Wasn't bad. But the service was great... Again I'm sure it was due to being empty.  I'm not sure if I'd come back.. Maybe is someone wanted it bad n treated me to dinner;)  other than that I would not crave this place at all.",PcfwKJJA9-H6ZNXAqNke9A,0,0,3,tYCIurflu3MJHy0muz-kzA
5819177,2009-03-19,1,5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,"This is a solid place for Chinese food in Vegas.  The first time we went, we had just arrived from the airport and it was 10pm.  For us, hot soup in our bellies is the best way to sooth a grumpy traveler.  My husband got the noodles with bbq pork - lots of noodles and pork...little veggies and broth.  Great for a hungry hungry man (or growing boy) like my husband.  I got the wor wonton soup - no noodles, but plenty of seafood and won tons.  Personally, I was not a fan of the wontons.  They are minced meat filled.  I like my wontons of have chunks of shrimp or other filling.

Second time we went for dinner.  We ordered the seafood tofu soup and garlic eggplant entree.  The seafood tofu soup was delicious - chunks of scallops, shrimp, crab, egg and soft tofu in a thick-ish broth.  Their garlic eggplant was also yum, but their eggplant was a little old - the skin was tough - but nothing a searing hot wok won't take care of!

It's a nice alternative to the buffet, esp if you are looking for a particular cuisine to eat.",5lR5gs5Oc9AgVSRB3lZsuA,1,1,3,W5TKU87eZshsVPX77iUh1g
5848381,2011-06-15,0,5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ,"This restaurant was the only reason I step foot in Monte Carlo. The quality is good for the chinese food. I have not tried their sushi so this review is based solely on the ""cooked chinese"" courses. 

I am dissapointed however as they no longer have my favorite of all time ""sweet and pungent shrimp"". They don't even have a sweet and sour shrimp even though is not the same as sweet and pungent shrimp however will cure my sweet saucy shrimp craving. :( 

Honorable mentions if you are staying at Monte Carlo and in the mood for chinese:

KUNG PAO SHRIMP

WALNUT SHRIMP

Service wasn't horrible, nor was it particularly good. It helped that the waitress spoke cantonese since I was here with my aunt and auntie and they were both chinese-speaking.
