The hotel is garbage but as long as Kenny is here they will at least have a customer at the bar. He should be teaching bartenders in Vegas. I hate doing reviews but everyone needs to check this guy out.",_sUvvSsjoKKLQ7FEkj5YTA,1,0,5,-e5YQF556ZTaDiR7Md3Jcg

He muddled everything that you would expect in a blender. I asked him if he had heard of something so unique and phenomenal  and he completely grasped the idea above and beyond and brought it to the highest level of perfection! Kenny can make anything and needs to be in ""Imbibe"" magazine!",KoTLHtSWffLMhs3OhjOoLA,2,0,5,ksmOqx4Qo0SeVk2437Qf4w

He is what makes this place amazing! 5stars, and 3 cheers for knowing that he is the textbook definition of hospitality, and delivers proper customer service.",nVK00oKUk4asStkaOR09uw,0,0,5,ENLV_xdbDdCGtMaNU89BnA
