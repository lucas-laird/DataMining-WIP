Common sense says u don't talk to your customers like that seeing how  it was your error.",ujFKIsncQ2Ey-5l5bFWd0w,0,0,1,FyjD4UJv85l07jIVUrJ26Q

I chose pizza because the others had long lines, but immediately regretted my decision when I was charged almost $7 for a (mushroom and pepperoni) slice only slightly larger than normal. I could have bought a whole Chipotle burrito for that price. They warmed up the slice and I ate it, but it tasted average. You can bet that next time, I will choose to wait in line for another restaurant to get a better value for my money.",gZHCbDOkHdHIk2d02FN3kw,14,11,1,2MV5H9CYalk_wzt7A6d2GA

I ate here more often than anywhere else while in Vegas, which says more about me than this place but still.",TSj_Dc6xcrzJ2Hdyx68Lyw,0,0,5,ux-6KqV_-EyJIPJHd_QXpA
