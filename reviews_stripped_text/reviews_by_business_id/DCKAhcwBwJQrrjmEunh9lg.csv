1537411,2018-01-24,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,Decided to check this location out because a friend said they are generous with their portions. Quite the opposite...the tacos had only a few pieces of lettuce and was the lightest and flattest I've ever received! Drive thru was a little slow but staff was friendly.,rwDwxFlLlJwbRmJiTsLpvA,0,0,3,aOdV2TUBCA3bkR1jJJE2lQ

Multiple times our order was completely wrong and we never receive sauce, even after asking several times when we order.

We tried a chicken spicy jack quesadilla 5/5 delicious, chips and queso (pepper jack spicy cheese sauce) 4/5 always tasty, queso crunch Taco which is a soft Taco wrapped around a crunchy Taco 5/5, a grilled chicken taco from the $1 menu also very good and made fresh 5/5, and lastly a $1 drink with bottomless refills. All in all a great meal fast and fresh! We now have another option in Mountains Edge. Muchas Gracias Del Taco!",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,4,5,5,Yx0c8SLzBuR7JqM1StTkJw

3773630,2018-01-12,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,I came here around 3am and ordered a grilled chicken street taco plate. I waited about 20 minutes to get my food with a car ahead of me. I got my food home and saw my beans look like they are at least a day old. Also there was hardly any chicken in the tacos. I understand this is late night but why would you serve this to a customer. Completely hard and inedible. I would have rather them offered me a double serving of rice in place of day old beans. I'm not expecting a five star dining experience here. I'd just maybe like the food I order to at least be edible.,TTFjea5Xr0gqdZE88wlGIg,1,0,2,VTCrkYUlF3r_RDCwPF1gaA

4185087,2018-03-31,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,"Wish I could give zero stars. I have never written a negative review on Yelp before but this Del Taco location certainly deserves it. Me and my family eat Del Taco very often, at least once a week and this new location is right by our house. Ever since they opened I have had something gone wrong literally every single time I've gone here. I've given up and have decided I will be making the farther drive if I do decide I want Del Taco because there is NO WAY I'm going back to this one. My fianc√© has found a long black hair in his food on two separate occasions. One in a burrito and one in a tostada. We called to complain and the manager acted as if this was a normal thing, brushed it off and just offered to give us a free burrito. On another occasion I was stuck in their drive thru for 45 minutes. I am not exaggerating. It was nearly midnight and they were obviously training someone new in the back but 45 minutes is excessive and they barely even apologized for the wait. And if they're not taking a lifetime to get your order together or putting their nasty black hair in your burritos and tacos then they're getting your order all wrong and messed up before anything. Seriously the WORST Del Taco I have ever been to. These people should be ashamed of themselves and really need to get it together. I love Del Taco overall and I'm surprised this location hasn't absolutely ruined it for me with their shitty fast food experiences I've endured time and time again.",1KVCSGZocKUn86C0-TSnVA,0,0,1,-jfmZGRFvQuIhVCH3lhoIg
4211341,2018-05-04,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,"This place is AWFUL and the meat they use is not fresh! I've only been here twice and both times were absolutely awful. 
My first time here, I ordered two of the mini shakes to go with our meal, and when she handed them to me, they were so watery, they looked like milk. I politely asked her if they could remake them and make them thicker, because they are so runny. She looked at me like she wanted to hit me, said nothing, rolled her eyes as she shut the window and leaned in to her coworker to say whatever she said. She then opens the window and says, ""that's just the way they come."" I then handed them back to her and I told her, that I didn't want them because they were definitely not shakes and I'd like a refund. She snatches them out of my hand and huffs and rolls her eyes and shuts the window. She then goes to get the manager, and as she is explaining to him the reason I need my refund, she is mocking me and holding one of the shakes up and rocking it back and forth and rolling her eyes to him. He then shakes his head and rolls his eyes as he glances towards me and then proceeds to refund my transaction at the micro and then walks off. She grabs the receipt, opens the window, pouts her lips together like a mom does when she is scolding her child and then slings her arm towards me to give me the refund receipt. She never even said a word! WTH?! I was so offended by her AND the manager, I swore to myself I would NEVER go back. 

Well, I should've listened to myself! Time heals all wounds right? .......Wrong! Fast forward a couple months and I'm heading home too tired to cook for me and my son, and I really want a burrito and a taco for dinner, so I think, ""okay, I'll try this place again"" because I really was so exhausted and didn't want to fight the traffic to get over to the rainbow Del Taco. I go through the drive-thru again. I order 2 Beef Del Burritos and 2 Del Beef Tacos. She says sarcastically to correct me, ""we don't have Del beef tacos.......(long pause).....we only have DEL TACOS."" I said ""oh okay well, your menu says beef or turkey, so I just wanted 2 Del Tacos with beef and not turkey."" Then I hear her and her coworker talking and she then says, ""we don't have any crunchy taco shells, we only have soft tacos"". I'm like ""?"" ""Uhhhh, okay. I will take just the burritos"". She says, ""so you want the soft tacos?"" I said, ""no, I'll just take the burritos"". I pull up and I smile and asked her nicely, ""how does a taco place run out of taco shells?"" as I giggle a little.  She looks at me and says, ""we are crazy busy."" I'm like ""oh okay."" As I'm looking around and there are no other cars or patrons anywhere to be found. So she hands me my bag with two burritos. Now, this Del Taco does not fold both ends of the burrito, which is typical of some fast food taco joints, however, it is food to go so I would think you would, at the very least, put the wrapper on them fully? Nope, both burritos were wrapped to leave one end fully open in an open bag. Now, if I have to slam on my breaks as I'm driving home, this meat will definitely come flying out, so I show her the bag and and say ""you guys didn't even wrap the burritos up all the way?"" She looks at me like I'm deranged and says ""uh, I'm sorry?"" I was like, ""can I just get a couple of hot sauces please?"" She proceeds to slam her hand in the sauce bin and grabs a handful of 13 (I counted when I got home) and hands it to me as if she was going to throw them at me. Now I've got to take both my hands to get all this sauce. She didn't even ask me which hot sauce I wanted. To top off the experience, when I got home, the kitchen staff had apparently wrapped the sides of one of the burritos so hard, their thumb went through the paper and poked a hole in the burrito and the sauce inside it had leaked everywhere. AND the meat in the burritos was cold and tasted old. Mind you I went through at 6:45 pm. when you would expect it to be fresh for the dinner rush. I also found my receipt crumpled up in the bag. I've never had anyone crumple my receipt like it's trash and throw it in my bag. I've also never gone through a drivethru that didn't put a single napkin in the bag. 
I've been to many other Del Tacos, locally and across the country, and I have NEVER been treated with such hatred by their staff. I will absolutely NEVER be back to this Del Taco. EVER!",H7VHKTiy6pY1vhM315eTTg,0,0,1,EIhCErSABh1x3MDkjzibTA
4305586,2018-03-20,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,I already knew when ordering from here that the food would be disgusting. Sure enough my assumption was on point. I ordered a breakfast burrito that had mysterious brown clumps mixed in with the eggs and black charcoal specks all over the tortillas. Enough said. That was it for me.

4560614,2018-06-27,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,"I'm pretty sure this is Taco Bell and not Del Taco. Because this is the worst Del Taco ever. I have been 3 times and they have struck out on receiving my services again... Until I see better Yelp reviews. The wait is always over 10 minutes long and they don't put anything in the tacos. I even ask for extra lettuce and they put in even less lettuce just to spite me. 
I have been to the 1st Del Taco restaurant in Barstow and over 100 Del Taco's from the states of California, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada. Every Del Taco I have ever gone to has the most incredible 10 star customer service. I will literally be still paying for my tacos and they are already giving me tacos with tons of extra lettuce, cheese and meat!

5254728,2018-04-06,0,DCKAhcwBwJQrrjmEunh9lg,"The service at this location is TERRIBLE. I was in the drive thru for 15 minutes, and there were only three cars ahead of me. The line behind me wrapped around the building. They were taking drive thru orders and fulfilling them one at a time. There were zero cars queued up between the memo board and the window. When I got to the window, there were five teenage girls in there, three of which were just standing around talking. Not one person cared about the line of cars outside. I ordered seven items. I asked for no tomatoes on the Del tacos. They both had tomatoes on them. I was also missing one item completely.

There wasn't anyone in the drive threw and we were the only people in the dining room and it took 12 minutes to make 4 burritos. There was 6 staff members, all young, not working and just laughing and taking. It is great to have a good time at work but not when guest orders are pending.

Clean inside as expected being new. Food was fine no issues other than the wait for the food. They really stuff the tacos with cheese. Did I say cheese ? Seriously.
