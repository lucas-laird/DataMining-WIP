I'm headed to the Fantasy show at Luxor and stopped by here at 9:00 pm.

Got the tiniest meal on the menu - perhaps too basic - I could have had some lettuce and tomato but that would have bern a couple bucks more - I just missed it b/c I thought all burgers had L&T to my surprise.

The patty seems to be hand-pressed. If it wasn't for that, I could have thought this was a MickyD plain burger, just a little thicker and privier.

I love the location of this joint ~ Classic/Vintage Excalibur walkway to Royal Towers - so many memories!

My experience at this Johnny Rockets was one for the record books. I was looking to bring in 25 people to celebrate a friend's grandmother, and the manager -- Saem -- went above and beyond to make sure all went well.

I spoke with Saem prior to the trip, and he was able to not only reserve seating for us in a little ""patio"" area to the left of the restaurant, but he was able to give everybody a discount, AND a free meal to the guest of honor. We were all blown away by the great customer service. Top that off with great food, and it was a huge win.

So one thing to keep in mind is this is a Johnny Rockets with the concept of a fast food restaurant; you order your food, they give you a transponder, and then you pick up your food when it buzzes. You grab your own utensils nd you clear your own table. 

Honestly, I almost didn't feel like I was in a Johnny Rockets because there were flat screens all over the place and no juke box either. It didn't have that 50s spunk that the others have and it just lacked that nostalgia.

It's Vegas,  I get it. I mean it's pretty awesome that this place is open late but I sure missed that old Johnny Rocket's feel. But anyway, I digress.

For me, the heart warming thing Bout this place are the smoothies and floats. The burgers and fries ate great too but the sweet stuff is usually so delicious! Not at this location.

My root beer float was just awful. The ice cream wasn't smooth, but rather very much frozen and crunchy. I was also jipped. My float was missing alot if you ask me.

Luckily, I had a Groupon to use for this purchase because I thought for a burger and fries (no drink) for $16.11 is pretty pricey. Not to mention it was difficult to find this place inside the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. Coming from Mandalay Bay we had to cross the Luxor and into the Excalibur and go down the escalator to get to Johnny Rockets. The nice part was we didn't have to walk outside in the hot weather to get there.

After placing our order I was surprised that I was given a transporder machine thingie that buzzes you when your order was ready. Really? I thought it was a fast food joint.  I had the BACON CHEDDAR SINGLE - Smoked bacon, double cheddar cheese, iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, white onion & special sauce. I must say that it was tasty and delicious but for $10.95, uh-uh! The fries is separate at $3.95. It had no taste. I had to add salt. 

There are lots and lots of places to eat in Las Vegas on the Strip alone so it is unlikely that we will be coming back in this location soon. The place was kept clean and staff was okay but must try other food places before coming back here...

 That's what you gotta do when you are a guy in these situations.  Suck it Up.

She got the Route 66 and I got the Smoke House Single.  Not bad for either one.

Not salty, which is how I like it. People complaining on YELP about ""no flavor"", I would disagree with them on that matter.   YOU DO NOT NEED THE EXTRA SALT, FATTY.  

1/2 Fries and 1/2 Onion Rings were just the right amount of portions for us both.

She got the Strawberry Milkshake and I just got a cup of H20(I've limited the amount of soda I drink each day no matter where I am)   Milkshake was very good and I got a sip or two.

Total came to about $32, which I would say is on the  high end for something like this place $$$.   The food was fine and tasty, the price was rather obscene for what I'm willing to spend usually. No mess-ups with the order, otherwise I would of asked for my $$$ or asked for a new order till done right.

We stopped in at 2 pm, we were only in line for less than 5 minuets. Family of 3 ordered the Route 66, Smokehouse Single, Rocket Double. 3 Large sodas later and the cost is over $45!! While we waited for our food we got our drinks and table. We each had the lemonade (delicious). The seating area was clean as well as the drink station. The food only took about 8 minuets to come out. It tasted good, but definitely not worth the price. Better tasting food at Whataburger or In and Out. This was our first time eating at a Johnny Rockets, we will never be back to another one.",9MLeBYYhBTDkzh-Kr9smRw,0,0,2,LGRVG87acv0oHv3htmX84w

Lo and behold, they have a veggie burger!  So, I ordered that and tater tots.  Enjoyed everything I got!  It's a fun, old-fashioned vibe.  The dance routine that the staff has to do was ehhh.  I could tell they weren't into it.  I would probably feel silly doing it, too.  But, still a good experience.  Definitely consider this a food option if I'm in that casino.",Y76nS3L426UCz7N_1pUfUQ,0,0,4,Qoj7qF5UJ1BvaClrQi5Efw
5349686,2017-10-26,0,emCZVTnhkDEQUaAz5wJq1w,Very pricey! Drink not included in combo price. Had the bacon cheeseburger and it was very good. The fries were very tasty as well. It was Saturday evening and I really wanted to see the Penn State College football game and they couldn't change the channel because it was controlled by the hotel. I didn't understand this and was very annoyed by it. I will only return if it's a last option.,Zp66HJ1Rntt9bwLSaAMoFw,0,0,3,g9EbQixvzfDEXAqX6TF9Bw

5623288,2016-01-08,6,emCZVTnhkDEQUaAz5wJq1w,So I never had this place burgers until last week.  I'm at a mehhh... as far as the overall taste of everything.  The Burger was good (Just good) but for $12.95 I would expect the burger to be a knock out.  The fries weren't good at all.  I mean I thought McDonalds fries were better than these fries.  Soggy and greasy potato sticks would be a better description.  Of course my large soda was $3.95.  I'm sorry that movie theater prices.  For the mehhh food and the Super price thats why I gave this place 3 stars.  I don't understand why its so expensive here.  The place itself is in the Excalibur hotel.  You see all kinds of bleacher creature tourist in that place.  The line was pretty long the whole time.  After I ordered I had to wait about 10 minutes for the food to be done.  They give you a pager with a number on it.  The dining part is pretty big.  I would think it fits 100 people at least.  The food was ight...  But from looks alone the milkshakes looked like the best thing here.  Maybe I'll go back for a milkshake next time.,B855Q1HFe8HKZ9zytQONYw,9,7,3,ihSOh3YSMiMCTl0tnc73vg

The staff is super friendly. and the food is great.  I didnt know Johnny Rockets served breakfast, in the morning after gambling i had pancakes and scrambled eggs with american cheese.

So we go in. I ordered a regular burger. I ordered a small drink. I was told they only had large. I said ""but you are advertising you have small."" I was told, ""We only have large."" Bad start. I whipped out my debit card. ""Can I see your I.D.?"" As  I hand it to her, I said why do you care?. No reply. I get my burger, drink and onion rings and sit down. I then notice a lot of customers have brought cups from the casino to get a drink without paying. Unless MGM resorts owns Johnny Rockets this is stealing. The entire meal was awful. How do I know it was awful? I took 3 dumps within an hour and a half of eating it. So Johnny Rockets can suck it!!!! I would have asked for my money back but that would asking a colony of ants to build the pyramids.",N-uaP30UVe_lA5qZYE_sDA,0,0,1,4P6TvxNUiPBNs9rglVfb2A
