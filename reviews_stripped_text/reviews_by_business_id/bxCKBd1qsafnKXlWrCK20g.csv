336115,2016-02-06,0,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,I tend to judge a restaurant based on the bread basket. The two slices of dry yeasty soft crusted bread served cold on plate did not bode well. The matzo ball soup was good luckily and the rock crab claws fair for the cost. Service can be spotty. While I enjoyed both the Flame and the Cafe more the food is adequate especially if using comps.,IYlauYtBJp3rv4Hn1ljEmQ,0,0,3,bTCr65T5PwGbj1cq6j7QyA

We spotted the Red Neon Sign as we walked into the casino & it welcomed us into ""Bugsy's"" domain. The restaurant has a nice 1940's decor with Bugsy's picture, bigger than life on one of the walls. The service was great. Paula, our waitress, came over right away & showed us the drink menu. I had a Meyer Lansky Mule(a New York Mob version of the Moscow Mule) & the drink was excellent. The menu has a nice variety of selections, shades of old New York choices. The food was prepared very well & came quickly. It was delicious.

731145,2016-09-01,1,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"This was our first visit since The Flame closed and we were quite disappointed. The food is not bad at all, and the $10.95 Prime Dinner was great as was the Yellow Pike, but the place is now nothing more than a diner that was at one time a lovely white table cloth restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere and feel. Not any more. The staff was good and I felt sorry for them because they had to walk so far to serve some of the tables, it seemed poorly planned. The cashier seemed to squabble a lot with her colleguess that was a distraction and once she shoved a chair away from a nice lady trying to clean a table, but I could see they were experiencing a lot of pressure from just the way the cheap skate set the place up as it was so far just to wait on the customers. What a sad thing to see a beautiful restaurant turned into such a cheap red and white and black tile joint. I must say the staff and bus people were top of the line and very, very courteous and it was nice to see some of the familiar faces from the old place. I hope the staff makes out, but this place is just a feeder place dumped on the good people who patronize the El Cortez with their money. Certainly it says a lot about what the owners think of their customers, which in my opinion is not much. My wife and I won't be going back and will instead make two trips to Binion's Steak House now, instead of the one we used to and the one at what was once the Flame. No more Flame. So sad. And really, what for? To serve breakfast and lunch all they needed to do was cover the pretty white table clothes with new red ones and set up two steam tables and two waitress stations and they could so very, very easily have covered breakfast and lunch for everyone. But, no, in their cheap minds they figured the white table cloth Flame needed to be done away with and we now see what we have, a not so attractive diner like down at the corner at three o/clock in the moring. Sadly, also, the wonderful piano player, Ray, is not there either, he's off to the side of the lobby next to an old beat up antique car. Is this the way downtown is going? Geez, I certainly hope not. Lets hope these rich but cheap owners come to their senses and go out and hire a consultant next time before they stand up and just demolish a classy, tasteful and lovely established place like the Flame.

When you ask someone for water or anything it starts a cascade of people asking other people but no water.   Where does the server keep disappearing to?   The GM was wandering around but seemed not to notice the room full of people waiting for drinks, food, checks, etc.  Also, when the meal arrived it was cooked wrong and cold. It has obviously just been sitting in the back for a long time.  On two different visits.  I had to send it back it was so bad.   I don't really know the restaurant business but they seem to have plenty of people, they probably just need to re-think their process, I don't know.

1032317,2017-06-23,0,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"I had heard about Siegels 1941 and been wanting to visit it when I got to Las Vegas.

Well the opportunity came and I went. 

The atmosphere here is cozy and quant. 

Observing the restraurant and notice the customer service in which was given to the customers not knowing it was the manager (Rodrigo T.) of Siegels 1941 scored major points in my book.

Rodrigo T. connected with his guest at the restaurant (with a smile and the tone of his voice was gentle) to make sure his guest were satisfied. 

After reviewing the menu in which had excellent choices, he suggested the ""8 oz.Prime Rib Special"". His selected dinner suggestion was ""Phenomenal"". 

When you visit Siegels 1941, make sure you ask for the manager Rodrigo T. because he will make you feel right at home and make sure you will leave satisfied.

Overall, because of the customer service (number 1 which sets the tone) and his suggested selection Rodrigo gave, I have to give this place 5 stars

Thank You,

1053480,2017-09-17,1,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"Per our server (never got his name), Siegel's 1941 has been there around 2 years. The Cafe is gone (replaced with yet another pizza joint in the area) and the $10.95 Prime Rib dinner isn't so obvious. I specifically asked the hostess about the unadvertised special and I was simply dismissed. When I mentioned to our waiter, ""we were looking for the cafe with the prime rib special"" he lied and said it (the special) didn't exist. Come to find out after we finished our meal he said they had the $10.95 Prime Rib special though Severs are told by management to not tell customers it is still available unless they specifically ask! Did I not ask before I ordered? I specifically said, ""Well, since the special isn't available I guess I'll get the 14 oz $28 Rib Eye.""

Now, that was one of the most disappointing cuts of Rib Eye I have ever had. Reminded me of the thin cut of steak with steak and eggs found on the midnight? cafe special for a few bucks that most casinos offer.

Others ordered Filet Mignon and it was way overcooked to a travesty! 

Our beverage lady was rude, slamming glasses on the table when she did provide a refill! One whole refill! And I never did get water so had to drink out of everyone else's glasses at my table.

Server made no effort to correct the issue or offer a manager to discuss this horrible experience with. 

I'd give zero stars but I have to select one I guess... Don't waste your money here. I've eaten at most moderately priced steak houses in Vegas in almost 15 years as a local and several high end ones but Siegel's 1941 makes Outback look like a Ruth's Chris restaurant in comparison!",ksIS0JG2nXUmTE-McCDiDQ,2,0,1,wb_k3P5K7-w0ozLSrDBTvQ

""Hello"" would have been minimally cordial but ok at least we're sitting quickly. Atmosphere was decent. Waitress took our order of prime ribs, queen for the lady,  king for myself. We each ordered a coke and received waters instead. Eventually The cokes came right before the meal.  The food was decently priced for Vegas especially and it was quality meat. I wanted some catsup for the fries but our waitress was way overworked with too many tables to handle. Never got a refill on the coke. We were still eating when the waitress put the check next to my empty glass. I would have liked a coffee, maybe see the desert menu, I don't know, maybe a refill on that empty coke that was sitting there for half the meal.

He offered a complimentary piece of cheese cake which we accepted and it was quite good. All in all, I'd say the food actually was worth the price but not the service.

The restaurant fills up a little more. 20 minutes goes by and no prime rib. We see other tables get their food which really upset us because we where there when the restaurant was empty. We finally see someone bussing tables in a suit and tie that we thought was the manager. We asked where our food was and tried to ask how other tables, including the one next to us, got their food before us when the manager interrupted us by saying, ""I'll go check on your food"" 5 minutes later, with absolutely no apologies, the Manager says that our food will come out shortly. Another 5 minutes rolls by and our food finally comes. Two of the primed ribs came out well done and one of them was really rare.

The menu encompasses breakfast and dinner specials, a series of ""sandwiches of the world"", and a $19.41 steak dinner, which makes Siegel's not what I expected. The atmosphere is geared more toward a steakhouse, but is instead utilized as a diner. 

The $19.41 steak dinner includes a salad (heads up, the house vinaigrette is a creamy version), sliced sirloin served topped with steak sauce (usually not  something I like, but nicely zesty here),  heap of fresh fries, and a bread plate (which never materialized). The Tuesday dinner special is a country-fried steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, which was generously sized and solid for the low $11 price tag. We couldn't resist adding on a bowl of their matzoh ball soup with challah, which was surprisingly meaty for $8. 
We wanted to share a dessert, but upon asking to see the menu, we were handed our bill- guess that makes the decision for us, huh?

Unfortunately, the subpar service kind of ruined it for me. Regulars were enthusiastically greeted, and we were helped in a polite and competent manner, but odd delays (20 minutes between courses, 10 to run our card, the dessert thing) made things a bit frustrating. The location and decor lend this space the potential to be a higher-end restaurant, if they kicked up the menu and retrained the staff.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,7,3,WrMp0Fubavbgx2jj23Yetg
1993814,2017-06-13,0,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"We got comps so decided to come here for dinner. The restaurant itself looks very nice compared to the rest of the casino. We got there around 7 and was seated immediately. The busser took our drinks immediately and brought them out very quickly. Shout out to Kibrov (I think this is how he spells it), he was amazing! So friendly, so good at his job, our drinks were always filled, he picked up our empty plates right away, and every time we ask for something he delivers! He was the best part of the whole experience to be honest. 

Our server was friendly enough but service lacked majorly. We had to ask for dinner rolls and it was brought out to the wrong table. We checked-in on Yelp and got a free bottle of wine, which she did not know about. She kept looking at my phone then had to ask the manager. If you have special officers, make sure the staff knows about it, it was not very professional when she asked me ""Oh..what is this?!!?"" And the wine took forever to come out, then she told us ""everyone came in at once, I have so many tables."" I know it wasn't her fault that she was behind because I could see her running from one table to the next, the manager should schedule more people if possible. 

The four of us got 3 steaks and a pasta with house salads. The house salads looked pathetic, very little lettuce with a couple of thinly sliced onions on top with cucumbers and tomatoes. Lettuces were wilted and flat, did not look appetizing at all. My pasta did not taste bad but had too much sauce, pasta was over cooked and a little mushy and chicken was dry. It was not too terrible to where I could not eat it by any means, but would not re-order. The steaks on its own were not too expensive but the prices of the sides were a bit high for downtown pricing. $7 for very basic sides: baked potato, grilled asparagus, spinach - nothing special. 

Food came out half cold and half hot, some parts were hot while other parts were cold. Clearly food sat there for a little bit before it was brought out. We were so irritated by this point we just wanted to finish and get out of there.

The hubs was craving some chicken pot pie so we decided to hit Siegel's for a good tuck in. 

We headed over to the El Cortez and braved the smokey hallway to get to the restaurant. The question is... Was it worth it?

Overall,  I am grateful the hubs decided he needed a pick me up and got us a venti green tea frappucino before getting there. Because if he hadn't,  we would have been way less patient with the service. 

Once we were seated,  the server took a while to come to our table. The buser got us some water but our server was largely MIA. This is even after we purposely closed our menus to signal that we were ready to order. We didn't know who our server was until a good 15 minutes when she finally showed up at the table. Our food also took a while (yes,  I know we ordered chicken pot pie which takes longer.... But it took 30 minutes+). The only thing our server was good at was leaving a check. Picking it up was another matter and I had nearly finished my review before she came and picked it up. 

On to the food. I ordered the Cuban which was pretty horrible. The roasted pork was dry and extremely salty. The lack of mustard mayo also added to the dryness and lack of flavor. They also did not have properly sliced pickles in there - just lay a large pickle spear inside. Plus,  the cheese was not completely oozing out of the sandwich like a real Cuban. Boo! The side of coleslaw was pretty meager and served in a small ramekin for butter. That may have been a good thing as the coleslaw was tasteless. 

The hub's chicken pot pie was bad too. The chicken was cooked to the point of mushy baby food and certainly not in chunks. The stringy bits of chicken could only be matched by the undercooked vegetables.  The puff pastry was doughy/gummy yet slightly burnt on top. Flavor wise and texture, a Marie Callender's frozen chicken pot pie is far superior to what we experienced here. Served with a side of rubbery unseasoned broccoli,  we had enough. 

Between the subpar service and the food,  there is no reason to schlep it to downtown and brave the smell of El Cortez for this. 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,0,2,-Kfz7lMH6b_wX_zDEvMZ1w

Based off the online menu, I was expecting something a little more upscale but it's more like a cafe with high aspirations. It has a quaint cafe-style atmosphere that's typical in casinos, very laid back and welcoming. I really liked the homage to Bugsy on the wall.

I knew before sitting down that I was ordering the $10.95 prime rib - it's not on the menu so I figured it must be especially awesome ... It was better! The meal comes with vegetables and choice of potato (I ordered the homemade mashed potatoes with gravy) but no soup or salad. My medium-rare prime rib came out perfectly (warm red center) and to top off a great meal, they still offered a dessert menu for afterwards.

We ordered cheesecake and apple cobbler for dessert. I was super impressed that it was still fresh and didn't look or taste like it had been sitting all day.

Our server was very attentive and quick to acknowledge us despite being double-sat by the hostess. We were never left waiting or wondering where our food was - the entrees took about 9 minutes to arrive to our table - and our drinks were kept full.

My obstacle this morning was a feisty old,
eastern European waitress from the Carla Tortelli School of Waitressing.
I ordered a cheese omelet a la carte.
In her thick accent, she asked, ""what kind of toast you want?""
I said, ""um, I don't want any toast. I just want the omelet by itself.""
""But it comes with it.""
I said ""OK, I'll have some wheat toast to ignore.""
So she brings me a full breakfast with toast, omelet and hash browns.
I only ate the omelet - which was delicious, by the way.
She never checked back with me after serving me, never topped off my coffee or asked how everything was.
When I was done, I flagged the hostess to get my Obstacle.
She slipped me the check as she muttered ""you can eat whatever, I don't care.""
I said, ""that's big of you to let me eat whatever I want!""
She laughed loudly.
I wondered if my army green jacket was giving her flashbacks to the Revolution.
I charged the bill to my room, handed her the filled-out check. 
My babushka said ""you take toast for later.""
I said ""I DON'T WANT THE TOAST.""
We then proceeded to bicker at the end of which I shook my head and said ""you should not be waitressing!"" 
It was like a scene from a Woody Allen movie.
As frustrating as all this was, I don't want her to lose her job. Life is hard for everyone these days.
I'm Italian-American and had a bossy grandma from Naples so I get where she's coming from. 
Maybe she was thinking I'm a poor Trotskyite, what with the Commie jacket, boho bag, small specs and lack of makeup, in need of all the food I could get.

2659275,2015-08-23,2,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"Tonight we had the opportunity to dine in a recent newly opened 24 hour restaurant at the El Cortez that was named after one time owner Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel. The restaurant achieved the blessing and cooperation of Siegel's daughter who was a teenager at the time of his assassination in 1947. She donated some family photos and even 8mm video of her father and family. 

In premise, backstory, and even aesthetic execution, I would give this place 5/5. Unfortunately, the ultimate execution falls short on a few levels. 

Yelp has this restaurant categorized as a ""Steakhouse"" but the truth is it it just one step above a 24 hour coffee shop. The restaurant is located in the former space that was occupied by the El Cortez Steakhouse which was a fine dining old Vegas style restaurant. Siegel's isn't really a steakhouse at all. It offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night with a menu that includes low priced sandwiches, appetizers, and basic steaks and soups. We ordered the calamari which was ok to mediocre. The Poutin was a travesty. Had it not been labeled as Poutin and instead just advertised as cheese fries, we would have probably been more impressed. 

The overall restaurant is quite nice. My recommendation would be to nix the 24 hour and go for a more traditional darker Siegel Steakhouse fine dining restaurant. The concept is done nicely with napkins, China, and mosaics all adorned with their Siegel's 1941 logo done in Bugsy's handwriting. I do recommend giving it a try but I also recommend that they revamp their overall structure. 

Service was satisfactory. Not great but not bad either. Just mediocre to okay. I think this restaurant, now a month old, will reinvent itself eventually and when it does, I look forward to returning.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,6,2,3,hbiqozGGySdgxDOCbvWjPg

While playing some video poker and waiting for some friends to arrive at the El Cortez bar, I noticed an advertisement for their restaurant, Siegel's 1941. The deal being offered was Las Vegas at its finest and I couldn't get it out of my mind. 

Starting at 11pm you can grab yourself an El Cortez burger and a beer for $6.00. 

My interest was peaked and you can bet your big ol' butt that I was in the half empty restaurant, waiting to be seated and hungry as all hell at a few minutes past 11pm. Okay, the service is horrid. One waitress, spread super thin, completely frustrated and ready to clock out... for life. She puts a lot of trust that the menu does a good enough job explaining the food because when she's at your table, she's all biz, no chit-chat. Thankfully I was already prepped and primed for the burger/beer special, which was not listed anywhere inside of the restaurant but verified to actually exist. 

I ordered mine cooked medium with a ice cold PBR to wash it all down. Twenty minutes later an impressive looking burger surfaced and I was quick to dig in. Where's the salt? Where's the pepper? Sure it was cooked to the perfect temperature and looked pretty, but damn, where's the flavor? A little seasoning could have bumped this burger up a few levels seeing as all of the other components were pretty decent. Hey, for $6.00 I'll still chalk this one up as a win.",aIJ-2R1q5G7oqzBSgK_Vvw,13,13,3,U0kCuutfm9Wd_ijKQG7LYQ

Of course, I had to get the prime rib - I didn't expect *too* much bc of the price but I really enjoyed it LOL.

I've read the reviews and they were always mixed but, my friend didn't want to travel to any of the new restaurants that have sprung opened in the recent 3 years, I optioned for Siegel's restaurant.

The wait time wasn't very long and we were seated. The decor and ambience is to reflect the old school times of when Fremont street were run by the organized crime bosses of its era.

Pictures of its former leaders adorn the walls and the furniture are echoes of its historic past.

The waitstaff are nice and our waiter Des was quick to come and get our drink order.

Shortly after, our food order was placed. It is an ala cart menu and offers many comfort food selections.

I ordered the prime rib rare, and a side of Au Gratin Potatoes.

The Au Gratin Potatoes was amazing! Cheesy, sharp cheddar flavor, buttery and creamy. So good!

The prime rib was flavorful but, unfortunately it wasn't rare as I had ordered. Small detail.

In the end, the whole experience was good and the food delicious. The customer service was also good.

I have only four stars because of my preference for prime rib.

3428369,2018-04-28,1,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"We recently spent 4 nights at the El Cortez, lured in by ""the loosest slots in Vegas"", the vintage vibe, and the direct booking offer of a free bottle of wine and a prime rib dinner at Siegel's. We were looking forward to a nice steak dinner, so we redeemed our prime voucher and headed in. On first glance, the restaurant itself is quite nicely decorated. It's obviously new, but still has that swank vintage Vegas feel (unlike the casino floor with it's odd smell, yellow light fixtures, and low ceilings). The large TV screen playing classic Vegas/mob movies was a nice touch. Service started out well, then kinda fell to shit. But I don't want to get ahead of myself. Our order included starters of calamari (greasy) and poutine (not poutine). I'm sorry, but poutine by definition is topped with cheese curds, not melted cheddarjack. Regardless, the fries and gravy were ok. My partner had the prime rib, rare. It looked and tasted great. No issues there, especially considering it was ""free"". I, however, decided to live large and order a $28 ribeye, medium rare, with a $7 side of creamed spinach. And here's where it went off the rails. First I'll add that after our waitress delivered the apps, we saw her scurry across the dining room to a server area carrying a styrofoam cup of instant ramen noodles. No biggie, servers have to eat too, but it was strange to see in the middle of dinner. My steak-the medium rare one-was delivered well done. I mean like, shoe leather well done. I'm not one to send things back, but for a $35 entree I had too. The manager eventually came over and seemed put off by my complaint. I'm like dude, don't blame me-I didn't cook this. Nevertheless he apologized and promised to fix it. 
A few (literally a few) minutes later my new steak arrived. Now, I'm an amateur chef and know full well that even a Med rare ribeye takes more than 4 minutes. And I was right. I cut into it right in front of the server (who was probably wishing she was eating her ramen)-and it was rare, borderline raw. Again it goes back to the kitchen. In the meantime, the cheese is congealing on the (not) poutine, as is the cream in my creamed spinach. A few minutes later my steak comes back out. It's still on the rare side but at this point I'm over it. Fine, I say. 
The server then lets us know it's time for he break. Meaning, she wants her noodles, and passes us off to another waitress who we never see until the check is delivered. No offers of dessert or coffee, no ""how was everything"", nothing. 
To end the evening, the check was wrong. The ""free"" prime rib was charged. We didn't know who we'd be tipping. 
There are lots of places in Vegas to get great food with exceptional service-this isn't one of them. Free prime rib and wine or not.",6nQZy3agHWItZeVpYIhWKg,0,0,3,gzNqokBmw141hHMspAef0A

There was a TV that showed old black and white gangster movies. You couldn't hear it but I think it was there to add to the Bugsy Siegel theme.  The service was prompt and attentive. The prices were inexpensive. A glass of wine is $5 and the average meal was about $14. On Wednesdays if you are 50 years old or over you get 50% off your meal (select menu) I tried the spaghetti with 2 giant meatballs. The pasta and sauce was good but those meatballs were delicious and for 50% off I loved it even more. They also serve a prime rib dinner for $11 regular price which is served 24/7. I enjoyed my prime rib dinner it was cooked to perfection, medium rare. I chose a baked potato with sour cream and scallions for my side and it comes with steamed vegetables. One early morning after gambling in the casino I had the crispy hot/Asian wings. They were over cooked but I guess that's why it's called crispy wings. They were $10 but I used the $5 off coupon (El Cortez Fun Book) So for $5 I was okay with the wings. When I order them again I'll ask if they can be lightly fried.

So I sit here with my $5 dining credit unable to eat for free anymore. I ordered a $9 roast beef sandwich, so $4 is the modified price. We'll see how it holds up. If it's anything like their burger was, I won't be impressed.

On my first return, service was so bad that it took approximately 10 minutes from the time I ordered a piece of pie for dessert.  My server even walked out with an empty bowl requested by the table next to me and then made a trip back to the kitchen.  You can't carry a small bowl and a piece of pie at the same time.  

I returned last week for breakfast.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The menu describes is like this: ""Poached Eggs Served over Toasted English Muffins and Canadian Bacon. Topped with Hollandaise Sauce and Served with Hash Browns.""  The Hollandaise had to be from a can or bottle.  If it's made in house, the chef ought to be ashamed!  The Canadian bacon was more like two thin slices of ham, and the plating was atrocious.  Someone just took a ladle and dumped the Hollandaise smearing it along the side of the dish and partway into the hash browns.

When our order came, there were several issues. My prime rib was well done because he had not asked, and I prefer it rare. My boyfriend and I both had prime rib and the cut was only about 1/4 inch thick. He did take my prime rib and brought out a rare one, which was about an inch thick and really good. My friends got dinners with salad and they had to request croutons for their salad a few times. One person ordered a Chicago dog, no onions and no tomatoes. It came out as a bare hot dog on a stale bun. When she asked about the other condiments, he looked confused and had to go get a menu to see what she was talking about. He came out three different times and once told her nobody knew what peppers they were talking about on the menu. He finally brought out another hot dog with some items on it.

My family and I went for a night out downtown, and decided to stop here and have some dinner since we've heard about this place but never have been here. 

We had the shrimp scampi which was very tasty. In my opinion it was more like a Shrimp Alfredo but it was delicious and very filling. The Calamari was one of my favorites. The sauce it comes with has a nice spicy kick to it. It was a perfect flavor. 
Also, we had the Filet Mignon. It was flavorful with a side of potatoes and veggies. FYI They dont add seasoning so if you want seasoning added to your steak request it. 
The New York strip was another choice of ours. It was a juicy, tasty steak I got cajun seasoning added to mine and it was really good. Also I got a side of macaroni of cheese with it. The macaroni and cheese had amazing flavor of different cheeses and crispy on top. My daughter got the chicken tenders and she devoured them which is a good sign. We also ordered the potato skins which were pretty good as well.

To top off our dinner we all shared the bread pudding. The ice cream on the side is vanilla bean ice cream. None of that fake ice cream it was real vanilla bean, and the bread pudding was delicious.

The decor is just ok, with an attempt to nod at the history, but it still had a cold, empty feeling to it.  They need a bit more drama, like adding some art on the blank white walls and i would also recommend the lower the heights of the deco lights in  the center of the room to help fill the void.   Very nice table top  and menu, i wondered if they add tablecloths at dinner service... 

Service was not great, in particular the hostess/maitre d.  No smiles, deshuvelled uniform, not remotely into doing this job. Waitress was nice but not great.

Food was ok at best, i had the chicken n waffles, which was chicken fingers on a waffle.  The gravy was good but i don't think that was really maple syrup.   Husband's eggs seemed ok but not great, and when he asked for toast, we were told it didnt say in the menu that it came with toast, but they would give us some anyway.   While i appreciate that they made this concession, i wonder who serves eggs without toast??

Don't order the cappuccino.

I also had to request the preserves that should accompany it...and had to settle for strawberry as they didn't have the customary raspberry.   They have not disappointed in my two more recent visits however.  Both were breakfasts from the Wednesday 50% off for age 50+ menu.  With discount the NY Steak & Eggs cost $7.  The medium-cooked steak was reasonably tender & flavorful.  Sure, it wasn't the higher quality steak but for the normal $14 price what did you expect?   The hash browns were good and the eggs, which I eat scrambled, good.  Toast comes on the side & I took sourdough, a good match for the rest of the meal.

4963899,2015-11-09,2,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"Where do I start.....

The Meal: My Mom asked me to take her for the prime rib special she has enjoyed over the years. The coffee shop is closed but we were told Siegels 1941 offers the prime rib deal. $10.95 just like before, however you need to ask for it.

Meat:The meat was perfectly rare, and was seasoned nicely they scored 10 points,  Her piece was extremely fatty and she left a pile of fat on the plate.Mine was perfect, there was enough marbling to add flavor, it was not as tender as I have had before but still good.

The Potato: The baked potato was rinsed and baked, there was no seasoning, not even salt, nor did they rub oil on it, so it was presented plain, and it was not even split. My first thought, was that it was not cooked! There was a generous amount of butter and sour cream to add taste, presentation is everything... 

The Vegetables: The green beans, carrots, and waxed beans were no better than the potato. There was no flavor, no salt, come on, at least throw garlic powder on them. My Mom asked me to taste the carrot, it was textured mush, so two bowls were returned on our plates minus one carrot each.

The Salad: I give points for the salad, it was a spring mix and the dressing was good. What ruined the salad, the bag of saltine crackers. If the bag was opened and crackers were placed on the plate the salad would look more appetizing. The looks of the plates were cafeteria

The Decor: When you first enter, you feel as though you stepped into vintage Vegas, as we sat down and as we looked around we could only shake our heads. I loved the photographs on the wall of Bugsy, the black and whites are great, the chandeliers and lighting, Sinatra and others are singing in the background and this is a nice touch.Then in the corner there is a flat screen TV with sports on, I am then looking to see where the bar is and there is none, it is so out of place.  The red booths against the wall are nice as well as the chairs that are retro, then I look at our side of the dining room and we are all sitting on wicker chairs that belong on a veranda. Order more of the elegant chairs, or if you can't get them, sell all of them and make them uniform, or cover them all in red fabric covers!. The room does have glass windows and you can see into the casino and that is nice, however I began to cough because the smoke enters in through the front of the restaurant, for that reason alone I cannot go back, I have asthma. The beautiful drapes at our table with the wicker placemats, ruins the ambiance. It is like Siegel's can't decide if it is a nice dinner spot or a coffee shop. If they change the name to Siegels Coffee Shop some of this could be forgiven. The servers have great uniforms so maybe I expected more, it just needs to decided what it wants to be, casual or elegant. If management polished what they have, Siegel's 1941 could be a gem!

The Service: Poor. We were seated and a server came by and asked what we would like to drink, then a second one came over and was asking about drinks and food, they had my Mom and I both speaking till I stopped and asked, ""Who is the server because I am not sure who to talk to since one was on the side and the other at the front. We both declined water and a few minutes later the water arrived. We both thanked the server/busser. Then came the wine. I do not expect 5 star service but when one pours from a carafe, if you lift it away from the glass it looks nicer. A busser had a quick conversation with another employee that was leaving for home at our table, so we looked at her back as they spoke. Having a better command of English without an accent would help, I had a difficult time but my Mom really struggled. Part two, the busser came by to fill the 2 inches of water my Mom did drink and my Mom said, ""No thank you"" but she continued to pour the water. I am not sure if this was a language issue, or a busser on auto pilot. The server came by to ask if we needed anything, as we said no thank you, she left before thank you came out of our mouths, pausing a moment would be a good thing. I thought for sure she would return with the bill without asking for dessert, this is a peeve of mine, if there is a check in hand I always ask to see the dessert menu, much to my delight, she asked if we would like dessert! She scored points. Training could make the dining experience very nice.

I do not like to write a negative review, I feel guilty, the El Cortez has been a favorite place to take friends from out of town to have the chance to experience old school Vegas, and the charm was lost here. I will watch other reviews and see what happens, but if it does not change, I will not be returning.",LgiBFHIsRWIduc7HTq2rkA,3,1,2,Ayf1BGIHsFNw63nwwegEDQ

I really wish I could remember our servers name bc he was so patient with us (came in last nite, Wed around 11pm).  He definitely deserved the stellar tip I left on our small bill.  

The guys ordered their $8 burger special which included a PBR.  All the guys devoured their burgers before the beers which told me they were pretty tasty.  I ordered their 2 Eggs Any Style with no meat or toast (gluten intolerance).  I asked our server if he could do scrambled but with no dairy.  He just looked at me and I said I know (while giggling) but I can't have dairy either.  Then I laughed and said whatever way you want to make it, I'll take it!  Any style is fine but no dairy. LET ME SAY, my scrambled eggs were DELICIOUS!  Oh man they were so good I wanted more! They were so fluffy and the taste was on point.

I love steak, and was excited to read about a hidden gem steakhouse in the hotel. Sadly, it was not until I arrived that I found out it had closed; however, I heard El Cortez was building a brand new restaurant that included the top steaks from the now closed steakhouse. We ate here it's first day open, and were thrilled. The rib-eye I ordered was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I've paid more than double for the same cut at more prestigious, well known steakhouses in Vegas, and this steak was better. She ordered the steak and shrimp, which was also good. The shrimp were nice sized and grilled perfectly, and she enjoyed her medium well (a travesty if you ask me) steak.
      I was in Vegas recently and took clients here. They didn't think much of the place until they sat down and took in the decor. They enjoyed the poutine (fantastic) and their main courses.

5279628,2015-06-23,4,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"Perhaps the most aspiring downtown hotel dining project in recent memory, and one that instantly sparked interest given the 24/7 concept within the historic El Cortez, it was with three friends that a four-course feast was enjoyed at Siegel's 1941, the sizeable space and immense menu showing promise of great things to come despite only officially being open for five days at the time of our mid-morning arrival.

Inspired by Bugsy Siegel, an early investor in the El Cortez, with a soundtrack that veers vintage as Rat Pack classics float beneath gilded ceilings overhead, Siegel's 1941 features several touches harkening the era for which it is themed and with Virginia Hill gazing on over wood and red leather the menu is wide-reaching with breakfast, 'all-day,' and late-nite versions offered depending on the time, the transition from breakfast occurring at 11:00am proving the impetus for the party's 10:15am reserved table.

Managed by Scott Farber and conceptualized by ESPLV, a design group behind several local restaurants with varying degrees of value, it would seem obvious that a concept as aggressive as Sigel's 1941 would be marred by a few issues in its opening days, and fully admitting that staff/kitchen transitions are one of those 'kinks' it was no-doubt a pleasant surprise that saw Scott diligently looking over his team throughout the stay, a middle-aged Hispanic woman providing almost universally impressive service given the complex coursing of the order, while a few kitchen delays and errors in execution seemed a bit more egregious - the chicken sent in place of requested eggplant, while a side of meatballs was instead served as the spaghetti centered entrée with a whole lot of watery noodles eventually going to waste.

Beginning with breakfast, a few cups of coffee as well as orange juice, milk, plus a cocktail all brought along with water with refills rarely requiring a request, course one saw four plates delivered and while the flaccid pancakes with a simple spread of nutella could have benefitted from a bit more imagination both the chicken and waffles beneath peppery sausage gravy and the challah French Toast were as good as any served within a local diner, the use of 100% pure maple syrup a definite highlight, as was the quality of house-made corned beef acting to anchor a hash that featured golden-brown potatoes and lightly seared red peppers alongside a pair of poached eggs.

Designating round two as 'the sandwich course,' it was on the advice of EatingLV that 'the city's best Cuban' was ordered, and served with fries on a silver tray one would be hard pressed to argue with such an assessment, particularly as relates to authenticity, as each ingredient melded nicely between layers of toasty pressed bread, the 'Monte Cristo' equally tasty and loaded with ham despite missing an opportunity to be the only deep-fried version currently offered in Sin City while the 'Carolina' pulled pork was unfortunately quite dreadful, a total lack of vinegar in either the pig or the slaw not at all resembling the stuff served in the Southeast while the bun was a soggy mess mere seconds after arrival.

Receiving repeat apologies for a delay that stretched just under forty minutes at the midpoint of the meal, it was almost as though the extra time only served to confuse the kitchen since the aforementioned mistakes were sent out despite being correctly listed on the ticket, but thankfully not meeting any harboring a distaste for animal flesh as the enormous chicken parmesan was an exceedingly high quality rendition with light breading and good sauce while meatballs were unfortunately a bit dry and almost entirely devoid of spice, the pot pie undoubtedly proving a far more worthwhile bite as golden puff pastry formed a buttery dome over a creamy potage chockablock full of chicken and vegetables that outdid many more expensive versions found elsewhere in Sin City.

Not yet dialing in the dessert menu, and as such unable to offer the Strawberry Ice Box Pie while also admitting that breakfast pastries are currently brought in from an outside source, the meal conclude with a duo of Bread Pudding and Turtle Pie, the former a dense block of brioche swimming in bourbon infused sauce beneath slowly melting ice cream while the later was an absolute must-order for those fancying caramel or chocolate, the filling a spot-on rendition of the inspirational candy with a graham cracker crust crisp too the tooth and heavy with spice.

Already rivaling anything downtown for 24-hour fare, and only likely to get better with time, Siegel's 1941 is the sort of retro-rebrand that places such Roxy's at the Stratosphere have long aspired to emulate - a place where tourists and locals alike can get a good meal at a fair price, all while experiencing the old-school Vegas vibe that flows throughout its longest continuously running hotel and gaming space.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,Kf3DgWF-z5pbb1W8f15D6w

The food is decent but not great - we ordered fried calamari as appetizer which the calamari wasn't very chewy or fresh, batter was kind of apart from the calamari. We had a ribeye steak ($28) that came with no side, so I add grilled asparagus for $7 which felt like a ripe off at this diner. But I needed some ornaments for my yelp picture so oh well.. and another shrimp scampi pasta as entree. Both dishes is lack of flavor but I was just glad my medium rare was at least on point.

So the worst part about this place is the service. Took the busser a while to ask us what to drink, and forever for the server to come take the order when it was not busy at all at the restaurant. After the meal came until we finished the server never came to check the table and just took our dishes away without politely asking if we're finished first. Then we had to asked him to refill water and of course he told the busser to do so, but busser didn't even remember our water was no ice with lemon. And the server forgot to deduct the voucher while we already told him in the beginning we are using voucher as partial payment. These are all basic knowledge and respect to customers but none of them is putting their heart at work which made us really disappointed.

I would say there's no reason for me to return, although I was interested on the prime rib special for $10.95.. so maybe someday if I end up at El Cortez with hungry stomach I'll reconsider again.",_KJRnZAxwEPyPhgJzQOxYA,4,1,2,89VagQ58klFI3zDaNY2feA
5672030,2018-01-04,2,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"Okay. I was in Las Vegas. It was my first night there. It was about ten O'clock, and I was exploring Fremont Street. I had JUST had a slice of pizza and beer at Evel Pie down the street. As I was walking back, my eyes caught sight of a huge banner that read ""10.99 Prime Rib!"" And for some inexplicable reason. I suddenly really wanted prime rib.  I guess I'm just a sucker for advertising.
    I got sucked into the casino. The El Cortez? I think? I meandered around looking for the restaurant. I found one of the bars, and moved on. No signs for Prime Rib there. I passed the pizza joint. Nope. No Prime Rib there either. Then I got to Siegel's. It seemed fancy. It seemed pretty upscale. It seemed really nice. No way this is the place? 
      ""Is this the place?"" 
      ""Yes. This is the place."" 
      ""Okay. One please!""
   I was quickly lead to a table and a cute waitress swung by for my order. I let her know I wanted $10.99 Prime Rib. Not quite still fully believing it myself. She smiled, nodded and asked about my drink. I hadn't had water all day, and I figured it was a good a time as any to keep up the hydration. Plus, I just really wanted to pay $10.99 for the Prime Rib. But cute waitress got a tip too. Nowhere on the menu does it say '$10.99 Prime Rib"" Hence my confusion. But if you ask for it....they've got it.
    On the TV's were playing I think the original Ocean's 11.  (No, not that one.  The actual 1960's original one) That somehow seemed appropriate here. After a lil while of trying to figure out what the heck I was watching, the prime rib showed up. Holy Crap! $10.99 Prime Rib is awesome! I was starved all of a sudden.
     Thick juicy tender steak. Mound of french fries. Bowl of carrots, and two different ramekins of sauce to dip things into? I think I love you $10.99 Prime Rib Special. I tore into the steak and ate it as lovingly as I could.  I tried to save it. Enjoy it as long as I could. But it was gone before too long. I used the horseradish and au jus sauce with the fries. (So very Good.) 
  

    So ya. Total was about $15. So a pretty cheap second dinner. Thanks Siegel's for $10.99 Prime Rib Special. It was magical. I'll definitely stop in on my next trip out your way for it.",43WiflwfTbmjizIfxvQ_jw,6,2,5,0KZtz9COoMeAhsbnMHfY_w

Has an impressive menu but food is not like a gourmet room restaurant in a hotel.  Prices and service are decent.  I would recommend staying with the meats and comfort foods.,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,0,1,3,ksJXgHWHk94VPxZqeGfwUQ

To say it's decor is from the 40's is a little misleading. It's more like cafeteria style, a little loud, but has huge BW prints on the walls, which we liked. There are a couple TV monitors that play gangster movies, which is cute. The menu is named after historical mobsters (The Lucky Luciano Burger) which we also liked. You can get a good burger for $10. They also serve breakfast, so we'll go back next time for that.",QHYmvzo_SWxvmCASkyBq7Q,1,1,4,8lp8whVIQb1yrcnninjarg
5729505,2018-02-02,1,bxCKBd1qsafnKXlWrCK20g,"Stayed at El Cortez for the first time recently, and after a late concert and a lot of drinking my friend needed some late night (early morning) grub... bad!... so we went in Siegels.  I didn't feel particularly hungry but thought I'd get a little bite of something and somehow turned it into ordering a full meal vs bite.  I got the chicken parmigiana.  It was huge!  And A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y  DELICIOUS!!  The sauce, the chicken, the noodles, the bread... everything was excellent!!!  My mouth is watering just looking at the picture.   I chowed down on more of that than I care to admit and took the rest up to my room which luckily had a fridge.  The next morning (ie, a few hours later) it was time to check out of the room and I couldn't bare to toss that meal but there was no microwave. I thought I'd just look at it (ha) and then I saw it and smelled it and... couldn't resist and took a bite (haha)... and another and another.. man I couldn't stop. 
 Even COLD it was still delicious!  Clearly, I highly recommend this dish and I'm so excited to be going back next month and I am FOR SURE getting it again!",6uUgFZJsDW2FIk5DWw4EFw,0,0,5,z7WFRaL53FlL-Z8iDqJZYA

Our food came out and he went on break really 2 nd time that happened and it was busy  we were forgotten but had our bill we wanted desert flagged someone down and we all ordered desert my son got a brown cow similar to a float and sucked a piece of meat through the straw disgusting .I showed the busser who went and got a women who took the item then never came back.

Vegetable Egg Rolls were crispy and very good, and Shrimp Chow Mein featuring large tail-on shrimp was good and tasty.  Service was efficient and good, as well.
