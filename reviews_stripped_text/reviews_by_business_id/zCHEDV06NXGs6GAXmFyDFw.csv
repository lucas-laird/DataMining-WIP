The bacon wrapped dates were decent 3.5 stars. Our waiter appeared depressed, didn't smile or engage us until the very end (tip time). I notice they have this poor girl standing at 7 am at the corner of Cactus and Dean Martin waving a sign to join them for Happy Hour. This wouldn't be necessary if they improve the quality of their food.",DskMAWgN9X2CGNX1WCSCMg,2,0,2,sSvFxA8weY8qpMvvQFA2lw

Barcelona is a great hidden spot in Vegas. It's relaxed, and the sangria is great. Once in after a couple times, the staff knows you by name, and  the food is nothing but amazing. It's great to have such quality in the neighborhood.",amU6JNWD7-beipN8IOZa9w,0,0,4,r6pL2hm1mr3CdR5BzH1sgQ

We received a complimentary plate of grilled bread, hummus and an addictive, spicy, garlic cream spread.  Our first order was  pan fried dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped in bacon with a wine reduction sauce (3.5 stars) and quesa fundido, baked cheese in a roasted pepper and tomato sauce (2.5 stars).  We then shared an order of paella which was mediocre due to the absence of saffron, a good seafood broth and chorizo (2 stars).  The meal was concluded with delicious flan (4 stars).",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,1,3,b820zuWUrAuvbuRpwOk-bg
