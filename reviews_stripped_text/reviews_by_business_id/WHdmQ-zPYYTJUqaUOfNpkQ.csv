My coworkers and I had lunch here since we were craving for some Blizzards, so Dairy Queen was what we all voted on. I ordered the chicken strips basket which came with fries, toast and 4 chicken strips. I also ordered a Butterfinger Blizzard, which was delicious and satisfied my craving for some ice cream and candy. 

The staff was really friendly and asked if we wanted our blizzards after our meal so it wouldn't melt. I also order my coworker a blizzard since he couldn't come with us and the lady put in the freezer so when we were done we can just grab it.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,1,5,DPstO3fl_Sgpca7k7b0XDg

Got home the cheese curds soooo good! Kinda like mini cheese sticks. I loved the fries cooked perfectly. Now the burger it had all the right stuff on it. Cooked to hockey puck standards just like all the chains but no good burger flavor. It was so boring and flavorless my dog had a gourmet meal!

5657712,2015-03-13,2,WHdmQ-zPYYTJUqaUOfNpkQ,"went in to get a quick ice cream cake for my dad's birthday today and since there were no prices in the cakes, I asked the cashier for the prices. after sounding completely irritated that he had to walk to the freezer, he looked at the cake I wanted and walked away while saying the price. long story short, I ended up buying the cake. after paying for it, I asked if they write on the cake and he said yes. I wrote down exactly what I wanted, ""Happy 80th Birthday Dad!"" he took back the cake to another lady and came back out about 15mins later and said, ""here you go, hope you like it!"" 

Idk if this is just me, but when you tell me you write on cakes, please specify the level of experience. I mean, if it were me, I'd definitely let my penmanship be known. imagine my face when they brought the cake back to me and I saw the picture below!? then you say, ""hope you like it!"" I almost asked, who wrote this? is there a child back there doing this? smh! do not by any chance, let them write on your cake!",R0riGDpjLwqqD796_TbXkg,3,1,1,_r-Q6Zs28FZxsTwNS09cDA

Now I had to wait for a few minutes just for a cashier to come up front and acknowledge us. Then he seemed like we were and inconvenience to him. Really not worth all the issues. Go to any other DQ, trust me.",xFBuE2kvvlxYR2-gQKnRPA,0,0,1,QlDdAvzXYcALDvmrjnHS0w

Fast food and I are on A-OK terms, and this locale is no different. The drive-thru service was fast and the lady taking the order was A-OK too. 

The fries and chicken were still crispy and hot by the time I got home - so that's a win. And the blizzards are always upside down-licious. Butterfinger blizzard is my usual jam, but if you're feeling adventurous, I highly recommend mixing Oreo and strawberries. Your tastebuds will thank you for the unexpected combo.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,12,3,y2TgSDESeUYTQ7vj2-lfbA
