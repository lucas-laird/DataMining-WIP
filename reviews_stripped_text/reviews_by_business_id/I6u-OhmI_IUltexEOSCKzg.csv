I couldn't help but notice the sign for this place driving along Spring Mountain...cute little anime girl and a steaming bowl of ramen and the name of the joint is (surprise) Anime Ramen.  This made for the perfect quick lunch spot on an errand-running Sunday.

The place is tiny, but you are made to feel welcome as soon as you walk in the door.  The menu is pretty simple, just a tonkotsu ramen and an order of edamame sounded ideal to me.  And it was pretty damn good.


Fun anime movies play along on the TV screens while Japanese pop music blasts on the speakers.  All I kept thinking was how much my 16 year old nephew would enjoy this place.

But, the service and the food are both seriously lacking. The ramen is HORRIBLE. There are no words. This is not real ramen. Or it's the world's most poorly made ramen. Either way, stay away. 

As for the service, we were there for an early lunch, so the place was pretty much empty. And yet the 2 servers kept disappearing in the kitchen for 5-10 minute stretches while they were going to refill our glasses. There's nothing quite as uncomfortable as sitting at a table waiting for your drink to come back while you're thirsty. You tend to keep staring at the back room, waiting for it to re-emerge. This wouldn't have been a big deal if the place was hopping but, again, there was only one other table seated the whole time we were there.

Between the bad service and even worse food, this place gets a 1 star. There are some great Ramen places in Chinatown, I strongly recommend finding another.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,3,0,1,wSGlp0D5jMAQyr3_fsv34A

207086,2013-02-01,0,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"This place runs solely on gimmicks and it's only a matter of time before the gimmick stops working. 

Me and my boyfriend walk in and first impressions are not yet shaken. We go in expecting the anime wall art and the costumed servers. It actually looks inviting. To my left I notice a small shelf of - what else? - manga and some issues of Shonen Jump. Interestingly, some of the manga have yellow labels on the spine that indicate they belonged to the city's library district at some point. Anyways, apropos reading material given the theme of this place.

We're promptly seated - the booth closest to the back - and even though there's some anime playing on the TVs, and a few other customers, I notice that its eerily quiet. Then I realize - there's no noises from the kitchen. None. There's also no scents of food in the air. If you were blindfolded you probably wouldn't guess that you're in a ramen joint. 

I order tonkotsu, boyfriend gets vegetarian miso and a mango smoothie with boba. The smoothie tastes sweet and milky, not enough of mango, and I saw the server dump sweetened condensed milk into the blender. I personally think its a strange ingredient for smoothies so thats probably why we didn't care for this $4.50 drink. Amount of boba provided was rather small.

Tonkotsu arrives and it's a huge disappointment. The pork broth barely had flavor, if any, leaving the caramelized onions to greatly overpower the ramen. The noodles were bland and soggy. The egg had zero seasoning - it was just a hard boiled egg that, due to its lack of ANY flavor, felt out of the place with the ramen. I ended up not finishing my noodles because the whole dish was a fail. The miso vegetarian ramen was reported to also be incredibly bland, as were the noodles. Check was paid, we left.

And service? The servers looked like they hated their job, wanted to get their shifts over with, especially our waitress. She mostly mumbled when she spoke with us and was very much indifferent when she checked up on our meal progress. Considering Anime Ramen's Facebook page and how 90% of their photos are their servers posing all ""cute"" with peace signs being made and whatnot, the other 10% being food shots, and zero percent showcasing their menu, I'd figure more of an effort would be made in service but I guess that its literally all style and no substance.

261652,2012-08-24,4,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"Back so soon?  I guess habits really are hard to break.

Anyway, I talked to the manager who was very nice and very apologetic about things that I've been told.  Sadly, the kimchee is not vegetarian but it could have been before since they do get different brands in from time to time.

However, the miso IS vegetarian.  There is no fish in it like I was previously told.  Good news for this girl!

So I got me some Miso Ramen, vegetarian style.  It leaves out the pork, fish cake, and egg leaving behind corn, seaweed, bean sprouts, and tofu.  I really can't complain much about ramen because I'm such a carb freak (thanks, Italian genes!) and the noodles hit the spot.  However, the miso was a little plain so I kicked it up a bit with the condiments provided on the table.  It was definitely a good way to warm up on an unusual rainy day!

My husband got the veggie fried rice and now I know that I've been missing out with my Chinese options up here in the north.  Their fried rice was really good!  I might have stolen more than a couple of bites from him.

Now I feel good about coming back here and I'm excited to have another noodle soup available on my rotation!  Plus this one is on the way home and easy to hit up when the mood strikes.

Thank you again to the manager for being so patient with this vegetarian.  I really appreciate it!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,7,5,4,j_Z_Ji_LxC9ydEF5hDp5Ew

I thought the wait staff would dress up as anime characters or maids uniform but nope...instead they wore some type of school girl uniform ensemble with colorful wigs.  It wasn't even a JAPANESE school girl uniform!  Anyway, that's all the cosplay I got to see.  The waitresses kept yelling """"Iraashaimase"" (in a high pitched voice)...every single time a customer entered or left the shop.  The greeting got really annoying and distracting after the 4th time.  

The decor was simple and reminded me of my brother's room when he was in middle school (posters all over).  Anime posters decorate the walls while Dragon Ball Z (or Dragon Ball Z Kai..which ever it was) played on the two TVs. 

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and well...I've tasted better.  The ramen noodles where soft, soft as in it was soaked in the broth for some time before it was brought out to the table.  The flavoring wasn't memorable ( I can't seem to recall it ). Throughout the meal, I couldn't help but compare my ramen meal to the one that I had at Santouka at the Mitsuwa Marketplace in NJ.  Santouka's way better by the way.

The only great thing about this ramen shop is that the waitresses were really attentive.  Overall, the experience and food was so-so.",j4qQqGIqAXPUMzFzW0_9gw,5,0,3,6w-FiR1UreQWOnRie-VPUA

356786,2011-10-20,3,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"I've been an anime/manga fan for 25 years, and a cosplayer for 20. I'm also a tad snarky in regards to my chosen fandom. So, seeing this new ramen-ya named Anime Ramen, I -had- to give it a shot. I went for lunch and was underwhelmed, sadly. But, i'm a staunch lover of Monta, so my expectations were very high, so there's that.
 
The atmosphere is fantastic, if you adore Naruto, and the current anime trends. They blast anime and video game soundtracks, which was fine, but not everyone's cup of tea. The place is trying for a ""maid cafe"" concept like they have in Japan, but it's a bit lacking. The girls don't wear wig-caps for their head, so their anime-esque wigs look not only low-quality, but VERY messy. They are friendly enough, but seem a bit scared of things, still. My guess is for some, this is their first wait-service job, and it shows.

 The food is only average, to me. The gyoza tasted like frozen from a bag, and the tonkotsu ramen was okay, but not as delicious as Monta to me. They give 3, paper-thin slices of bland chashu in the ramen. The one thing I loved about the ramen? The French fried onion straws in it!

BIG props to the fact they serve good boba tea! I got the almond milk tea, and it was delicious! It's good enough that is Tea Planet is busy, i'll gladly stop into here and get my fix.

 My thoughts, if you're a parent with a kid hard-core into anime, take them here! You won't starve, and your kid will love the experience. I promise the opening theme to Cutey Honey will get stuck in your head for days, later! ^_^",DwS5fvL_BR1-uUaafGTkOQ,3,3,3,sQXOxtW9TBTIP8ygdXHVDg
412333,2011-11-01,2,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"I pass by this joint everyday coming from work and one day decided to check it out. I must say that the Tom Yum Ramen was incredible! When we went, they were offering free bobas with purchase of entree. Yay freebies!

Now when you walk in, the brightfully colored wigged staff greets you like most Japanese places in town. You seat yourself and they come by and take your order. The environment is relaxed and cozy. The decor features anime art plus you have anime playing on the tvs, except for that one tv that plays American football. The staff is nice but they do seem a bit inexperienced. They did forget a couple things here and there but my only issue was when they kept asking how we were doing every 5 mins. It just becomes annoying after a while. The guys I was with did mention how they enjoyed the scenery at the place and would come back to just ""hang out"" there. Men!

Anwyays, yes the menu is small but what more could you want? They have ramen, fried rice, some appetizers and bento boxes. And they're portions are actually a decent size for the price you're paying.

At $8 a bowl, we ordered the miso ramen, tom yum ramen, kimchi fried rice ($6) and the usual teri beef (?). First off, this isn't Monta or Ichiza but I give these guys kudos for trying to bring this concept to Vegas. The fried rice was better than I expected, actually I enjoyed it better than Shuseki's version. Ichiza's is still my favorite. The only thing is that, the rice did contain pork so if you're not a pork fan you might want to make note of this before you order it.

The Miso ramen wasn't bad. The guy that ordered it enjoyed it very much and said it was very flavorful. I tasted the broth and the broth was nicely flavored. Not too bland but also not too salty.

I ordered the tom yum ramen and honestly I couldn't stop eating it! I love tom yum and their version was very comparable to some of the Thai places around town. Add some ramen with the chicken and mushrooms and you have a winner winner chicken dinner. I ordered it spicier but alas I still needed to kick it up a notch. Just thinking about it makes me crave a bowl. Normally I can't down the big bowls of ramen, which is a bit surprisingly since I usually have a big appetite, but I did find myself scrapping the bottom of this bowl. This surprised me, that never happens! I was so full but was determinded to not this go to waste. To top it off, the Thai Ice Tea boba went down great with it. 

So with that being said, yes it's not Monta or Ichiza but at least give it a try and judge for yourself. I like the concept of it especially since it's Vegas! Despite what some might say or think, Las Vegas has a pretty decent Chinatown compared to some other cities.

I actually came here a few weeks ago, the weekend before they changed it to ""Pretty Girls Maid Cafe"" so I'm basing this on the Anime Ramen menu rather than the new menu. I got the karaage chicken and miso ramen. The karaage chicken was average, I've had better at Ichiza. It took them a long time to make the ramen, which is weird because if you've been to other ramen places like Monta, you can look into the kitchen and see how fast it takes for the chefs to make the ramen. My bowl took about 30 minutes to make and when I got it, it wasn't even steaming hot. Their noodles reminded me of the ones you get from instant ramen and the broth lacked flavor. Their char siu was not that great either, great char siu is suppose to melt in your mouth, but this just tasted like I was chewing on pork fat. Service was average, the night I went it was packed so we didn't receive the best service, but we weren't being intentionally ignored.

Furikake Fries: These fries are addictive! I did not need any ketchup or mayo (or was that salad cream?).

There were only 2 other customers and both were already eating. The waitresses in the bright-colored anime wigs go overboard playing up the high-pitched cutesy voice, to the point that it becomes difficult to understand them. As we were eating, one of the waitresses, who had apparently just gotten off work, was sitting in a guest seat at the counter, counting her tips, with her wig sitting on the counter, beside a customer who was eating.
 We ordered the tempura appetizer, shoyu ramen, and seafood ramen. The fried shrimp and veggies that they served us was NOT tempura. The batter was thick and heavy, slightly sweet, and very oily. It was the same packaged batter mix that you get on bar food. Like I said, NOT tempura. It was overcooked and the oil wasn't hot enough, causing the batter to absorb a LOT of oil. 
 Both the flavor and color of the ramen noodles told me that they were from a package too. The broth of both types of ramen was bland. The bamboo shoots were tough and rubbery, not crisp. The fish fillet in the seafood was very fishy, not fresh.
 We got the impression that the chef has SEEN pictures of Japanese food, but has never been trained how to make it, nor ever tasted real Japanese food. It also took about 30 minutes to get our food, even though we were the only ones with an order in.

We had a great time talking about anime and shared a bunch of great laughs at whatever anime that was playing. 

The waitresses were all dressed in very cute cosplay and I couldn't keep my eyes off them lol. They were really friendly and cool, it was a very chill and relaxing environment that even the waitress shared a few laughs with us here and there. I think some of my friends felt a bit uncomfortable cause they were just really digging the really cute waitress with blue hair and pikachu ears or they just thought it was a really strange place. If you ask me though this place is really special to me. The ladies were so cute, I kept thinking damn I gotta go back there the next time I visit Vegas. 

Oh right the food, anyways we ordered some kimchi rice to get everyone started before the ramen came and it was good. We got 2 orders of it and everyone on the table just killed it in like 5 minutes. It was just that good, as for my order I got the Shoyu ramen with extra bamboo shoots. It came with only 2 pieces of pork which seems to be the norm these days in ramen restaurants but they were big pieces so that made me happy. The same with the bamboo, they were cut in larger than normal pieces and the ramen was just normal tasting. Nothing really special about the food but doesn't change the fact that it's a fun place to hang out.",GsuyCIvrwXbt-X4oKPeqTA,0,0,3,1CzAl-NkZNmAtq7eheeEjA

I ordered extra noodles in my ramen and when they brought out our order mines was wrong. They brought out a bowl of just plain noodles and that was my extra noodles. Haha. So as I waited for my order the hot noodles are getting cold and soggy. Didn't mix well with my Tonkatsu at all. 

We ordered honey toast for desert. Our server seemed nervous and stopped coming around because it was taking so long. She didn't even refill our waters. So after no refills and 30 minutes later I cancel out order and ask for the check. Server apologizes and says it usually takes longer. For French toast and a scoop of ice cream!?

I thought it was a smart move to add the subtitles for those that wanted to watch the movie playing on the big screen. Always something to look at in there whether it's the anime posters on the wall or the maids, I give the owners props for coming up with the unique experience. 

Boyfriend and I ordered from our waiter who seemed nice enough. I ordered the Teri Chicken because I was a little nervous in trying the ramen because of all the talk going around on how bland and terrible it was. Maybe next time. My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum ramen. 

Food came out at an understandable time. Not crazy busy, but not dead either. The Tom Yum was awfully bland; noodles were overcooked; and tasted watered down. (yes we leeched off of each other's meals to taste) The portions were good. As he calls it, it was ""edible"".

My Teri chicken came with two rolls of crabmeat sushi. Unexpected, considering it came with a light salad, rice, and chicken. Normally when I eat sushi, I would like to eat at an actual sushi restaurant. It was a nice surprise and surprisingly good, fresh. 

Although the presentation was lovely and neatly arranged, the dish's salad was raw with hardly any of the vinaigrette. When I did get what was little of it mixed with a bit of salad, it was delicious. I just felt it was raw veggies tacked on there with the skimpy vinaigrette. Is this what I paid for? The rice tasted a little stale and warm,  and the chicken was unspectacular. It's a usual dish with quality you can find anywhere. It was okay, but I was expecting to be wowed a little bit. 

Our waitress seemed upset and very timid. We would thank her for setting down our food or thank her getting us the napkins they may have forgotten earlier, and she would walk away without one word or even smiling. It felt unwelcoming. It must have been a long day, I guess. I liked our waiter much more because he was polite. Both seemed inexperienced though. Not a huge deal, but nobody really checked on us unless we waved them down. 

We are not picky eaters (far from it!), but when we go out to eat, I expect it to be better quality food than what I make at home. Food was decent enough to eat, but not enough to recommend. It was an okay experience. However, the service and quality of the food really detracted from it. It is going to take more than gimmicks and adorable dress-ups for us to come back though. I want to be convinced into coming back or to feel that it was so great the first time that I'd want to come back again. I would give it another chance maybe on a different night.

Our group of friends got a large variety of food, it was all very good quality, even the meat that was in other dishes.

I am talking the nastiest meat I have ever seen or tasted in my life. 60 percent of it was literally just huge chunks of fat floating in there instead of actual beef or chicken. While that was supposed to be the main part of the ramen, we all ate around it. It made me want to puke even looking at it.

We came in with a party of 8.  The staff was very quick to put 2 tables together for us and brought a clean high chair for our daughter.  We had waters before they took our orders and helped explain any questions our guests had with the menu.

The food came out in a timely manner.  We were told the Chicken Karaage was a new recipe so we ordered it and it was delicious.  Our daughter loves the tofu salad and that didn't disappoint either.  I ordered the tonkatsu raman and my wife had the tom yum ramen.  

The tonkatsu was great.  Plenty of noodles and meat and the broth was delicious.  The only thing that made it better was adding the Mayu they provide and a few drops of lemon juice to make the broth pop.

The tom yum ramen was a nice twist on the traditional thai dish and was nicely done.

The staff at Anime are extremely friendly, attentive and dressed in costume.  Although the place is all about anime, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  So if you've never seen anime, don't be intimidated and if you are a fan of anime, it could only make your experience better.",iMYz7rdyhma74hK6SyYQVg,1,0,5,FoUcw__TkiSyiUflo7MyUQ

Walked in and one of the servicers was dressed like a maid but the other was just in normal clothes, which we thought it was weird, so it wasn't required for all workers to dress up?

We were digging the anime posters and artwork on the walls and after instagraming photos, we ordered the BFF (1/2 Tonkotsu and 1/2 Shoyo) ramen, Stewed Beef ramen and Anime Lasagna. We actually ordered the ramen first but they brought out the Anime Lasagna first even though the server told us it would take longer and we said it was fine, since we assumed we could start on the ramen first, but instead we starved a little longer. booo

Everything was a bit bland and the noodles were too soft for my liking, the consistency was closer to egg noodles than ramen noodles. The Stewed beef had a very Chinese taste to it, very herby. The BFF didn't have much flavor to it, I couldn't really taste the pork in the broth. Anime Lasagna was good though, it just seemed like a baked scallop roll but with a fancier name.

 Yes, you can get addicted to ramen, and I'm talking about the real thing, trying to resuscitate dead noodles by adding hot water to it doesn't work for me anymore. I'm not in college and my taste buds had graduated and now they expect something better. I'm glad I found this place since they were open later than my regular Ramen location, ate my food and felt more animated but I will be honest, this place is good the ramen was decent and satisfying but not as good as the ramen at my favorite place down the street where they somehow manage to intensify the flavors, I would call this,""ramen lite"" so for now I'll just keep it on my list for emergencies.

Here is why I love it:
-the brown rice? hot tea
-the mayu!!!!!!!!!!
-the seafood udon
-the kimchi
-the green tea creme brûlée

We ordered three hot teas and three waters they came out quickly and so we ordered edamame (they are just lightly salted) the calamari (tempura like fried, comes with mayo side and standard sweet chili side) and the chicken nugget like app (comes with ketchup and a soy like sauce?)

I munched on the calamari and discovered all the sauces on the table I LOVE SPICY, I love how I immediately started dumping sriracha, mayu, chili oil, red pepper flakes, all on my side plate to smear my edamame and calamari in :)

I really wanted kimchi fried rice but did not want to ask for it without the pork belly (I don't eat pork) so I went for the other choice I wanted anyway SEAFOOD UDON! And I ordered a side of kimchi :) Hubby ""the non spicy"" ordered a chicken teriyaki and our friend ordered the beef ramen.

Our order came out perfect and timely. We were refilled with hot water or tea quickly when out

Hubby liked his huge portion of teriyaki dinner and I snatched a little bite of the ginger salad it came with and it was very good! friend liked his beef ramen!

I LOVED my seafood udon! it was a very light broth, with baby bok choy, whitefish, squid, fish balls, tons of udon and very very yummy. Of course after trying the udon ""as is"" I dumped all my additives and even kimchi right into my bowl!!!! the pic of brown broth is what I should have posted :) YUM!

Also, I Jay-son (the owner) also manages/ owns Satay Grille, so I did have a certain expectation coming in of the service, since the service is great at Satay. Now, this isn't Ippudo in New York, so I am not grading it as such. I'm about the ""bang for your buck"" type of places. Ippudo in New York is expensive, so of course you expect awesome ramen and service there.  But this place is actually very very good for fraction of the cost. And the service is actually up to par. 

When you walk in, all the waitresses (who happen to be dressed in anime style) greet you. Now, This might sound sexist, crass, and/ or racist... but if you are guy who is super into asian chicks... you should come here. If not for the food... then to look at the cute anime chicks (Come on... this Vegas anyways... and it is all in good taste). I said that comment because my friend who likes asian women said, ""the food is really good... but I really like the 'enviroment.' A lot to look at."" (he meant the females all dressed in anime).   

As for the food, I have been here a few times. And within those few times, I have tasted the Tonkatsu, Shoyu, the Pork on Rice, the Teri Chicken, the Teri Salmon, and the honey toast. 

For the ramen, I would have to say that I read some of the previous reviews and some are comparing it to Monta. That is a fair comparison since Monta is the only other place I know of that serves ramen. But if you all notice that the ramens at Anime come pretty complete with all the condiments (i.e. half an egg, bean sprouts, cha-shiu, onion etc , versus at Monta (where you have to pay for each additional condiment... maybe you can grade a bit differently). Yes, I agree with some of you that the ramen might taste a bit bland... but I spoke to Jay-son (the owner). And the reason they do that is because they tried different combinations for each soup. And the census showed that more people would rather it come out a bit blander so that they can add how salty, spicy, etc. that they want it. These are also generous sizes. 

The rice plates are very good too. But I thought I would put more of my attentions to the ramen, since the place is called Anime Ramen. I highly recommend the pork over rice or the salmon. They come with 2 decent size California rolls, a large scoop of rice (more like two), veggies, and mac salad. 

Highly recommend closing your dinner with their Honey Toast. It isn't like the Ichiza one. This one comes as three Texas toasts, prepared in French toast style, with ice cream and honey drizzle. 

I will probably go again and again and again.  The employees may seem inexperienced, but the place is new. But for inexperienced employees, they are all very very nice.  I have had three different servers and they all seem to have the same quality of service, as in constantly checking up on us, giving us recommendations, and even tried to strike up a conversation.",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,4,2,3,hLac3lR2YkZTqPs1aro5zg
1484866,2013-01-21,0,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"My girlfriend and I had been visiting this restaurant since it open. It was a favorite spot up until a couple of months ago. Recently, the service has taken a turn for the worst. The past three times it seems that Anime Ramen doesn't have enough wait staff or kitchen workers. We've waited about half an hour several occasions to have our food orders taken and another half an hour for the food to be prepared.
Most recently, I left after not getting service at my table for over 15 minutes, not even a drink order taken, nor a hello after being pointed to sit at a table; the tables around us seemed to have waiters, but not us for some reason. It's sad because we loved to come here, but after this latest experience, we no longer feel that the great tasting food and low prices are worth the wait.",KWRQxYLWVZa9Rn7qlseSUg,0,0,2,K8GaN1IHS3zVzVq0Umy8pA
1566532,2011-12-28,1,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"The atmosphere and the careful attention to details were the first thing to win my heart.

Not only am I surrounded by canvas paintings and posters of familiar characters but the real rush of nostalgia I get happens when I look up and see things such as Pokemon: Destiny Deoxys, Miyazaki's Ponyo, and Sailor Moon S playing on the flat screen television, along with the great selection of Jpop music in the background.

Also, I bet if I were a male, I'd be caught gawking at the adorable anime lookalikes that take your order. Even then, I'll admit, I wish I was as cute as they were.

Their menu had quite a bit of variety, despite it being a single laminated page front and back. Not to mention, the speech bubbles and the fact that the style of the menu itself looks like a page from a manga is amazing in itself. But oh, did I mention that everything in the menu is under $10? But it doesn't end there; after you get the check, you get a cute collectible card, as if though they were from an actual trading card game for an anime! Did you want more? They have a calendar.

But anyway, the service here was by far one of the best I've had lately. Today, when the place was settled or not too busy, our server attended to our services very often, and even squeezed in a little time for a nice conversation along with our group of six. If you ever get served by a sweet girl named Ivy, then you're sure to be lucky.

I've gone here quite a few times, and I've tried the following:

California Rolls -- I've never order them separately as an appetizer, but I liked having them as an extra little addition to my rice plates. It's a nice serving despite only having two and hits the spot for a mild taste of sushi simply just to have some. Also seems a bit bigger than the pieces I get at 'nicer' places. But as I said, it hits the spot, and since it's included, why not have some?

Teriyaki Beef Plate -- The beef could be more flavorful, but I swear I came close to asking for more sauce since I was practically picking it off the plate. Honestly, I've had better, but it's not bad.

Tonkatsu Rice Plate -- The bowl of curry was a bit confusing for me at first glance. I'm used to dipping it in something that's more closely related to a barbeque sauce type of flavor, and considering I don't like curry much to begin with, I was a bit iffy at the start. But I'm glad I opened up to it, since it went along nicely with my cutlets. Mmm mmm mmm! I finished every last bite!

Tonkatsu Ramen -- By far my favorite bowl of ramen here, I also tried this in udon, and, in my opinion, captivate my taste buds quite a bit more simply because of the extra thickness in the noodles.

Shoyu Ramen -- Had a bit of my boyfriend's, and from what I had, it was almost as good as the Tonkatsu, although didn't seem to fulfill me as nicely as the latter. Maybe just that there was simply a tad too much stuff in a single bowl?

[Furikake] French Fries -- Only because I had to feed a broke, starving friend did we have it sent to our table. Just a tip, ask for a bigger serving of Japanese mayo before anything else. You won't regret it, especially since it's a really sweet compliment to a simple, salty side dish!

Mochi Ice Cream -- Nice and chewy in a good way. They're fairly small, but just the same kind of serving as you would find in another restaurant such as Kobe or Ichiza. 

Honey Toast Ice Cream -- Rich, sweet taste that gets my taste buds just as it does when I have Ichiza's, although is quite a different take. Both are equally as good, however, and the sweetness just takes me to a place out of this world.

Strawberry Boba -- Only tried a sip or two of my friend's glass, and I don't regret it! It's not overwhelmingly powerful, but sweet enough to give you the 'mmm' factor. I love my boba balls chewy, and I'm glad they did just that; it compares to my favorite spots for boba like Tea Station and Volcano Tea.

Overall, I consider Anime Ramen a quaint little place great for sitting back comfortably with a group of friends with great service, nostalgic anime, and good, relatively cheap food. I definitely want this place to become a regular spot to visit with my close friends! (:",IWQkdTTn9FslPeSiih2l2Q,2,1,4,kqHaMV3g9cCsYeD10-cGQg
1566882,2011-09-17,5,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"Cutest place ever! The waitress that helped us looked like she literally jumped out of an anime. She was dressed in a maid outfit and looked super cute. Service overall was excellent. I was greeted when I came in and the waitress checked up on us frequently. As for the food, we ordered the tonkotsu and miso ramen with an order of chicken wings. For the ramen, I'm kind of biased because I'm comparing it to Monta.

Miso ramen: Kind of bland. There was some miso flavor but overall it wasn't enough. What I did like though was that it came with a bunch of extra stuff like half an egg, bean sprouts, cha-shiu, onion etc.

Tonkotsu ramen: Kind of salty! Pretty much the opposite of the miso. lol. Once again, I did like how it came with a bunch of extra stuff similar to the miso.

Chicken wings: Yum! Fried perfectly with nice crispy skin on the outside. The chicken wings were huge and came with ketchup. However, I would recommend them switching out the ketchup and changing it with a special sauce such as wasabi mayo or something.",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,12,9,4,t0yypNKsOti0gC4GN_YOjQ
1619221,2011-10-05,2,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"I'd like to say that I'm going to enjoy coming here every week. The greeting  from the waitresses was surprising at first and gave me the impression that this place was gonna be fun. I loved the whole color scheme (I'm really antsy when it comes to colors blending, complimenting each other, etc). The decorations from the wall, to the bar, to the lamp above your head, it gives a fairly comforting atmosphere. The waitresses are all bubbly and are a lot of fun talking to. I probably have never seen them frown even a little, so far. 

Anyways, the food. I've tried almost everything and so far, I'm in love with Tom Yum, udon noodles. I've tried chicken and shrimp, both are going to be my regular whenever I come by. The broth isn't too spicy, but spicy enough to hit the spot. I would only have one complaint though for the shrimp. I hate taking off the hard shell tails. :/ The teri chickens could have a little more teriyaki sauce, but that's more of a personal preference. It also comes the mac salad, a couple cali rolls, and something else, I totally forgot (I think it's green... something...). Teri Sliders were amazing though. I personally don't like pineapple, but the sauces and meat that compliment it make it bearable to eat. It's just a little pain to pick it up because the breads soaked with teriyaki sauce on the bottom bun. Minor setback from my epic nom noming. The food is great, just needs a little work here and there, but all in all, great. It's not a pocket breaker either, none of the food is really expensive. The portion sized compared to how much it costs seems about right.

*Liquor license is on the way, probably expecting a lot more business after that's settled. Definitely late at night, Chinatown seems like a 24 hour place anyways.

*Waitresses look like they enjoy their job too much sometimes. Pretty fun talking to them, if you can get the chance. How are they always so bubbly?

*Relaxing, chilled atmosphere. Interesting anime on TV, wall decorations are really nice, comfortable seats, and the restrooms have a anime photo next to the ""Men/Women"" sign. Fun facts yo.

I'm glad I tried it because Im sure I will never go back again. Not that it's bad it's just there's nothing that can make me go back again. =/ 

*FOOD*
- Tonkotsu ramen ::: not bad but not good at all. Can't compare with Monta's tonkotsu ramen at all. The pork bone soup tastes bad and the pork tastes a little bit over cook. And the size is smaller than the Montas.
- Chicken wings ::: A little bit dry and it only comes with ketchup and some white sauce. 
- Pork over rice ::: Im not sure if it's japanese food or not? To me, it's more like Chinese food. This one tastes okay (but it's easy to make so .... ) And it comes with 2 pieces of sushi and some pasta salad 
- Gyoza ::: soso ..
- There's only soda, ramune and bottled water etc on the drink menu 

*SERVER*
- The servers are nice and they kept coming to my table and asking if my boyfriend and I need anything.
- They dress up in lolita maid style
- But these do not sound attractive to me since Im a girl. Maybe guys like to go there ???

*INTERIOR DESIGN*
- ..................................
- ........................
- Yea Im kinda wordless. It's just simply a restaurant with some anime picture mounted on the wall, a tv playing anime and anime music. .....

The food is not good .... the interior design is not good ...

Anime is open until 12am. Servers we dressed up in anime attire which was interesting.  Ordered two soba bowls with pork and vegetables. Soup was hot and the noodles seemed fresh. Needed a little bit of a kick to spice it up. We also ordered a custom sushi eel roll. The roll was 10 pieces and was very good. This place is a convenient alternative if you are in the mood for noodles. You may even want to take their sumo challenge of eating one of their giant noodle bowls. I wouldn't necessarily make this place a specific destination unless the more traditional noodle shops are closed in the casino.,t2lcYmcuoNUWCeQLCyO5Fg,0,0,3,w_2x90XbVcQwqCA4f7SyLA

1812986,2013-01-15,24,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"Personally, I like the inside. Female servers dressing like anime characters, right down to the colored wigs. Oh, there were other things to look at in here? Never noticed.

I was still quite satisfied from my meal earlier in the day (yup, In-n-Out) and figured dessert was the way to go here. Tempura ice cream sounded good. In other words, fried ice cream. Tried the green tea version because the other option was just plain vanilla. 

I really liked the presentation: a sizable ball of fried ice cream, with whipped cream, sprinkles, and chocolate drizzle. The thick tempura shell was crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside; it also tended to fall open like a blooming flower. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but it looked cool, anyway. It was also a pretty satisfying dessert.

There's a quantity food challenge here: the Sumo Bowl. We're guessing around 7-8 pounds of food total (including almost 3 lbs of noodles at pre-cooked weight), and you gotta drink the broth. You got 60 minutes, and even if you finish early, you have to stay the entire time. Maybe they want to make sure you don't have one of those ""reversals of fortune"" or something. I think there are only six winners to date, and I probably know half of them.

Did the Sumo Bowl look good? Definitely. How long would I need? Hmm, maybe a week. That's one big-ass bowl. Looks like a nice salad bowl filled to the brim with noodles, broth, and all the usual ramen additions.

There are a few types of ramen on the regular menu, along with some tasty-looking teriyaki dishes. I hope to be back to try them at a future date.",oN23cWAm6Umyp19BTCc-QA,6,4,4,YEVcwG0dx4iO14SZq6LX5A

Drinks 6/10 (Ramune, soda and gatorade... Alcohol coming soon, should make specialty themed drinks clean glasses)

Environment 9/10 (Anime themed paintings adorn the wall, various popular anime series play on the 42"" flatscreen, anime music playing in the speakers... Im in anime heaven!)

Enjoyment 10//10 (I've observed people coming to dine alone, but this place is best viewed with a couple of friends. Great hangout potential)

Overall 32/40 = 4 stars (Food satisfied my appetite, cosplay maids made us laugh and smile. They were hella cute and were very polite and attentive. Finding that combination is VERY rare for this price range.)

Do you know how many anime themed stores/restaurants are there in the greater Las Vegas area? Exactly, there aren't any. The Vegas anime community may not be as large as LA or NYC, but its still large enough to warrant themed restaurant or two. That's where Anime Ramen comes in.

Tucked away in a small 10x20 ft space in the corner of a chinatown shopping center Lies this small, quaint little restaurant. Even the Restaunts window sign spills slightly over the neighboring restaurants window space. I didn't notice till the owner of the other restaurant was yelling at the owner of this place. Its so small and innocent that you can't help but wish good things for this place. 

Much like the building space, the servers are cute, petite, and friendly. Very helpful and pleasing to the eyes. Not like the various Hooter-esqe joints this area is plagued with. Anyone that is looking for an anime friendly place don't need to look any further. 

BUT there is no point to go to this place if the food is horrible right? let me tell you the food isn't horrible at all. It's also not the best in town. I'd say that this place is pretty good for what its worth. Sure ramen portions aren't as large as other restaurant, but for $7-10 for a healthy bowl of ramen is fine. Don't expect to be eating foie gras or some Kobe beef carpaccio. Ramen is comfort food and does its job just fine. 

My two friends and I tried all different kinds of Pork, seafood, and miso. The flavor of all 3 don't overpower you. It smells good and they tasted good so we all agreed it was good food. Not great but, good :)

Regardless of your opinion of how this place is from others, I feel its mandatory for any anime/manga fan to at least try this place. Since I'm very sure things like this just don't come around Vegas at all. 

Come for the food stay for the atmosphere. Possible good hangout spot for anime/manga fans alike.",tX5Qzrg-ExCB2etafYaFRA,0,0,4,DJms1kieOVMo0J-Oa8tSEA

But, the ramen isn't worth returning for.  The soup base is bland, the noodles aren't anything special, and the toppings are decent but can't save the nothing that is the soup base.

Another problem is the complete and utter lack of regular soy sauce.  All they have available is the low sodium version. They obviously know that their product requires condiments because they give you a pile of them, so to not have regular soy sauce is baffling.",6aJ_WRWa3C3o0A3EXYyEmw,0,0,3,fRKStaUCrPPBrKl-6BwtDw

We also weren't fans of their unsweetened tea. I guess we were expecting the kind of unsweetened tea that you'd get at most restaurants. Theirs is Japanese tea that is better served hot, not cold.

2002537,2011-10-02,3,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"If you have ever attended a themed Maid/Cosplay cafe in Japan or otherwise, half the time the food isn't really up to the typical standard of a regular teriyaki or noodle house.  They oftentimes are there for the simple notion of enjoying a themed meal with cute servers and entertaining atmosphere.  

Thankfully, when I stopped by Anime Ramen &Teriyaki Cafe a few days ago, I had an overall pleasant experience thanks in part to a clean establishment with chirpy, ""genki""-esque girls, and pretty decent food.

The angle here of course is Anime.  Giant prints hang on the walls from anime ""Japanese Animation"" work such as Kenshin, Naruto, Bleach, and other popular titles.  Thank God I'm in my twenties and not in my teens because if I was in my teens I would have lost my mind and been here all. the. time.  

I tried the teriyaki sliders, the pork based noodle bowl, and iced tea, which was an original mix of theirs.  The tea was pretty decent, the sliders were excellent, nicely presented, and the pork bowl was flavourful, with good chunks of meat with Udon noodles (Which was presented as a choice.)  The sliders were definitely the best feature of my meal.  I'm a Pho kind of guy and I prefer Pho over Ramen as it's more flavourful and healthier (depending on the venue as far as salt is concerned.)

I wanted boba tea but they were out of boba so that was a no-go.  Apparently they also have a liquor license on the way so we'll see how that goes over.  

Service was a litle scattered but otherwise very pleasant.  The servers are adorable girls in wigs who greet and see you out with the typical Japanese phrases, (although ordering in Japanese doesn't work, so don't try to show off your skills if you hanasemasu Nihongo.)  They managed to talk me into trying the Honey Toast, (which after, despite my love for Ichiza, I have tried and disliked due to how overly sweet and how you can only enjoy 1/3 of the actual toast), which was really good!  Think of it as Honey French Toast, every bit is edible and it's less to deal with.  

So, that said: I was quite pleased with Anime & Ramen Cafe but there is room for improvement being that the business is all of three weeks old:  

-I would like to see a better pacing to my meal i.e. if I order appetizer and meal, I'd like the appetizer to arrive prior to my actual meal.  

-My water refills were a little slow and I had all three waitresses, minutes within each other attempt talk me into dessert, even after the first waitress talked me into it.  

-A football game on the monitor?  Seriously?  People come here to get their geek on, don't put on anything else but programs pertaining to this scene.

When the call went out for a location for dinner the next night, we immediately suggested Anime Ramen. A group of 8 went out to the restaurant, but we were delayed by stuff at the conference we were there for. We grabbed more friends an hour later and joined that original group. Another group saw our squees and foursquare checkins and popped in as we were leaving.

I think our glancing at a sign got at least 60 people to try anime ramen last weekend, and I'm very very glad they all did. The location has the feel of a non-creepy Akihabra maid cafe, but with tasty ramen and cute sushi. I thought the noodles were particularly well done. I didn't care much for the meat. The sushi was really cute but fairly mediocre. I really liked that they tried to give them cute names and make them themed. I loved that my favorite movie, ""Spirited Away,"" was playing on the screens as we ate. Canvas wrapped anime prints were a nice touch. The wait staff were attentive and adorable.

The staff is willing to help you get what you need but they seem quite timid towards the customers and shy at times when you have a question. (Only certain waitresses)

The ambiance is calm with the anime playing in the background and at times they do play Japanese music as well. It can be quite loud at times but maybe I'm just getting old. 

Price wise, nothing to complain about. Main dishes range around $10, although some drinks and appetizers seem over priced for the amount that you get. The food comes out fairly quickly (only if it's ramen) all of the other dishes come out pretty slow sometimes. 

All in all, a good place to go to if you want a quick ramen fix.",T1qFl_9vIo8DJY2yiAfLGw,1,0,3,kU-CG6PBFqBHGX-kcwWhgg

I ordered the Japanese pizza which was very good but HOT (let it cool for awhile before you burn the roof of your mouth) We had calamari, which was lightly breaded and cooked perfectly. The furikaki french fries was interested, but the furikaki didn't stick well to the fries (my suggestion to the, add a mild cheese or maybe a lite wasabi mayo to help the furikaki stick better). We also ordered teriyaki sliders which was good, and the miso ramen was tasty. We finished off the meal with honey toast ice cream, which was VERY YUMMY!  I would go here again, but maybe next time I'll skip all the appetizer and go straight for the ramen.

Feeling in a spicy mood, I ordered the tom yum with ramen noodles.  I also ordered the California rolls.  I heard that the owner, or someone associated with the owner, used to own one of the Thai restaurants in town.  I was quite surprised at how tasty my tom yum was!  I expected it to have more of a Japanese slant on this classic Thai dish, but surprisingly it was pretty much Thai style.  Lemongrass, galanga root, and basil.  The broth had a nice, savory flavor with a slight tang to it.  The ramen noodles were good in this tom yum, which I guess actually did give it a Japanese twist.  My friend thought that the noodles were slightly overcooked, but I didn't detect anything like that in mine.  I ordered a level 8 spice level, and the waitress thought I was a crazy white guy.  Well, for me the level was more like a 5.  Still good stuff though!

The California rolls were generous in size.  They were tasty, perhaps not the best tasting CA rolls I have ever had, but a great appetizer.  

My friend did like his Tonkotsu, but he felt that the noodles and Chashu are better at 'that other ramen place'.  I would maybe say that the ramen is just a different style, and perhaps healthier than 'that other ramen place'.  

I had fun here, and I would like to go again.  The service was very friendly, although perhaps a bit inexperienced.  Our waitress had a tough time splitting our check between 8 or so people.  Still, she constantly checked up on us and even struck up some casual conversation.

Initially it might seem bizarre to be served by waitresses in cosplay costumes; however my friends and I thought the anime oil paintings and their showing of the spirited away accompanied well with our meal. 

I enjoyed our meal very much-we each ordered our own servings of ramen and shared butakimchi fried rice and Japanese chicken pizza. I wouldn't recommend coming here for authentic japanese cuisine (i.e. sushi, sashimi, fish) because that is not what they are known for. Regardless, it is a a decent joint for a casual sit down meal of ramen and side dishes. Their ramen noodles had a nice QQ quality and soups were flavorful. I highly recommend the butakimchi fried rice. Although it doesn't taste anything like kimchi fried rice, it has an incredibly rich flavor that I could get enough of! Japanese chicken pizza was good but not particularly special because it tasted/resembled more like bbq chicken pizza than traditional okonomiyaki. Overall, we had a great time watching anime while slurping on yummy noodies.

The restaurant is located on the smaller section of Chinatown (plaza that has Ten Ren/Tea Station and Ichiza izakaya; The location is convenient for driving and is only a $10 taxi ride from the Strip.

FYI to the vegetarians: The Miso Ramen states vegetarian on the menu, so Torrance paid an extra $2 to add chicken. I don't have to have meat with my meals, so no adjustment was needed for my order.

I was on the way to Las Vegas Little Theatre one day and noticed this place and made a mental note to come and check it out sometime. I ended up bringing some co-workers with me to try it out, and now we've gone three or four times and have only been pleased with the food we've had.

As far as appetizers go, my favorite that I've tried so far is the Karaage Chicken. The meat is extremely juicy and succulent, and is served with ketchup and a sauce that may or may not be ponzu. I always make a point to order this, no matter what else I end up ordering. I've also tried the Gyoza and the Fries (w/ Furikake) and I thought both were decent, but nothing extraordinary. My friends seemed to enjoy the Chicken Japanese Pizza as well as the Takoyaki (a breaded Octopus concoction), but I passed on trying those as neither were really within my tastes.

The entrees have all been wonderful that we've tried thus far as well. My favorite is the Tonkotsu bowl, which I usually have with the Udon noodles. The broth is nice and flavorful, and they throw an awful lot of noodles in. I have yet to sit down and actually be able to finish a bowl of the ramen...it's that large. I've also had the Curry Chicken, and thought that was excellent as well. My co-workers seem to enjoy the Budae JJigae bowl, which is one of the spicier bowls of the lot that Anime Ramen offers.

As for desserts, this place is not lacking. I usually just have mochi ice cream. However, we've also tried the Banana Split and Tempura Ice Cream and been impressed by both.

We just ate here today and noticed that the menu has been expanded greatly from the last time we had been there a few months ago. They now have a larger selection of sushi :) Someone in our party had the Anime Lasagna off of this new menu and thought it was great...so if you haven't been in for a bite in awhile it might be good to stop in and give this place another whirl :)",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,3,3,5,CXlztsPF74dXpHnRaE1a-A

My boyfriend and I both got the ramen, with a side of kimchi fried rice. The ramen came with egg chashu (sp?) pork. My boyfriend thought the broth in his was a little weak. Mine was fine. The boba tea however, was delicious!

Update: I've been back several times since, and I have to say one thing. If you went when they first opened and didn't like the broth, go back and try it again. They're constantly improving the broth. Every time I go, it's better than the last time.

Of course, there are also the cosplaying servers dressed (at least on this visit) in anime-style maid outfits who cheerfully welcome you to the restaurant.

The food was surprisingly good.  The gyoza was solid, and my Tonkotsu ramen noodle soup had some nice flavoring to it, though, unsurprisingly, the quality of the ingredients--particularly the meat--doesn't compete with what you can get at some of the noodle joints on the Strip.  The honey toast was a simple and savory dessert--toast three pieces of bread, cover them with honey, and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle.  Unfortunately, the ice cream was frozen rock solid when it came out but eventually relented to the chipping away of our spoons.

Prices are pretty reasonable, though I can't fairly recommend the restaurant for its food alone.  On the other hand, if you're looking a pretty fun environment that you usually don't see outside of Japan or the occasional anime convention, then give Anime Ramen & Teriyaki a try.  As a side note, it's a little bit of a pain to get to if you're visiting Las Vegas without the use of a rental car, but I didn't regret making the trek.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,2,1,4,b7-06GMC-t-cal3fIAo-_g

Pretty funny, pretty cool. What I thought was awesome about this place was that they had a Vegan option! YAY! Service was good and the colored wigs gave a slight feel of animeness. My freinds were all complaining how the food tasted like instant Maruchan noodles, and how the meat they got was thinner than a slice of deli ham.

Delicious, affordable ramen plus the anime theme really makes it quite a dining experience!

The ramen itself is not all that bad. It's not the absolute best I have ever had, but it gets the job done. What really shines here are the sides and the kids meals!

I had a side of the kimchee fried rice, and let me tell you..... It is by far THE BEST I have ever had!!! It's so damn good. Love the pieces of pork belly mixed in. I also have tried the fried noodle side dish, in which you can order it with the thick noodles or the ramen thin noodles, as well as a choice of beef, chicken, or pork (and maybe one other choice. I can't remember). It was a little oily, but still super delish.

My other favorite things to order are the boba tea (AVOCADO, PLEASE) and the honey toast. One weird thing though. The first time I ordered it, the toast was dipped in egg and cooked, like a traditional french toast. The second time, the bread was just toasted, no ""french"" at all. Hmmm. Kinda odd.

I got to try this place out after reading fellow yelper Tony T's review.  When I stepped into this restaurant and I instantly felt like I was in Tokyo. The cute little waitresses in their maid outfits reminded me of the maid cafes in Tokyo.  The only difference here is that they speak very good English and they don''t call their customers ""Master"".   Since this is their soft opening, all their menu items were 25% off.  What a sweet deal considering how expensive Japanese food could be.  But actually their menu items are reasonably priced.  We had their gyoza, karaage fried chicken, tonkotsu ramen, miso ramen, and the grilled salmon platter.  All this for under $30.00 (with the 25% off).  The gyoza was quite tasty, but I must say that these were the smallest gyoza I have ever had.  The karaage chicken wings came with ketchup and Japanese mayonnaise dip.  It was good, but probably would not order this again because it is deep fried.  I had the miso ramen.  The presentation of the ramen bowl was very pretty and just like the ones you get in Japan.  The miso broth though could have been more concentrated, but not bad.  My wife had the tonkotsu ramen and she really enjoyed it.  The broth was excellent and the egg, sliced roasted pork and other condiments complemented each other very well.  The roasted pork slices in the ramen could have been sliced a little more thicker.  My friend had their grilled salmon platter.  It came with two pieces of sushi, steamed rice, broccoli and macaroni salad.  She substituted the macaroni salad for the seaweed salad.  She also enjoyed her dish.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the two waitress kept coming around wanting clear away our dishes when we haven't even finished eating.  To me the service was a little on the annoying side, with them coming by every 5 minutes to check on us.   But this won't keep me from coming back as their food is quite good and as authentic as it gets.

I ordered a honeydew milk tea, and it was overwhelmingly sweet.  Now, I know that honeydew is sweet, but I've tried it in a number of different places, and I know that a non-saccharine version exists.  I'd be willing to try a different flavor in the future, but would recommend staying away from honeydew if you don't want something excessively sweet.

I ordered the tonkotsu (apologies if I butchered the spelling) with ramen.  I liked that there was an option of ramen or udon noodles, and I really liked the way they packed up the soup for me to take home.

The broth was rich and delicious, the egg was wonderful, but the stars were the crispy caramelized onions.  I was not as thrilled with the pork, and a little surprised that there were only three thin slices.  I made the mistake of adding in too much of the magu (again...apologies on spelling) to the broth, and the flavor overwhelmed everything.

Right when we walked in, I was greeted with bright neon colors of anime characters all over the restaurant. Anime cartoons were blasted on their flat screen TVs. The cute waitresses in their costumes looked like they stepped out of an anime. The attention to detail and the execution of their concept was impressive!

I was a little ticked off at first because the waitresses took a while to take our order. The place wasn't that busy and it seemed they didn't have their priorities straight when we've been sitting there about 15 minutes and one waitress was sweeping. 

My husband and I ordered the Karaage Chicken Wings to start. He ordered the Shoyu Ramen and I got the Tonkotsu Ramen. Luckily the food didn't take long. It was weird that they brought the ramen out before the wings but no biggie. My husband and I tasted each other's soup and although I liked the Tonkotsu Ramen better, it wasn't that great. Like other Yelpers said, it just doesn't compare to Monta.The chicken wings were actually boneless and were also mediocre. 

We had the Honey Toast for dessert and it was my favorite part of the meal. I always hear how good Ichiza's Honey Toast is, but I have always been too full to try it. I don't know which one is better, but I really enjoyed the dessert here.

The waitresses were good about checking in on us after our food was brought out so the initial annoyance I had went away. I also have to give them extra brownie points for being so darn cute!

The decor is pretty simple and gets the job. There are anime canvas posters on the wall and anime window poster shade things on the side. The girls who work here dress like maids and have typical anime girl hair, adds well to the overall theme of the restaurant. 

They were nice, but their service needs a little bit of fine tuning. Waitress came by and read us the drinks on the menu, and when we said water she took away the menu without giving us a chance to take a look. They seem like nice girls though.

Now to the important part, FOOD!

I will be comparing the food to Monta a lot because.. it is the one to beat.

Definitely not on the same level as Monta and ramen is slightly more expensive (@ $8/bowl). The way that they serve the ramen was interesting, had a spoon that lays perfectly on the side of the bowl, but the soup is filled only to the height of the noodles. Personally I prefer my noodles to be ""drowned"" in soup. The miso ramen was somewhat bland, but with the increase in price they do come with a few extra amenities like half an egg and corn. Tonkotsu ramen soup was less salty than Monta, but didn't deliver. The pork that is served is also thinner than Monta's. I had no problem with the noodles since they were cooked al dente. Lastly the gyoza was okay, the taste did not compensate for its smaller size @ $5/plate.

At this time they don't take any credit cards other than Master (weird) unless you're paying with debit. 

I will probably come back in the future to try the chicken wings, but I'm in no rush to come back.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,5,3,3,h9doZqLL_NaMdpdqu_5Ujw

The bad reviews on here scared me though. I drove here in the middle afternoon for nice lunch, and I feel like i got so much more.

Love the outer decor. Sailor Moon on the window? Score! Also, the inner decor is nice as well. It's much nicer than people are describing on here. I like to refer to it as asia-chic. IT's not traditional, but it's definitely japanese inspired. also, the pictures of anime on the wall are much more than some posters. they are high quality canvas print panels, and they also have j-pop playing in the background, with gundam anime on the two flatscreen TVs. The cute waitresses in colored wigs and fun outfits greet you in japanese, much like they do in japan (they do this for everyone who comes in, no matter what they happen to be doing at the time.

Parking is hard to find so we just parked at the gas station next door then it's just a hop, skip & jump away. 
Total of 4 in our party (2kids). Ordered 2 meals off the kids menu. The plates and food was not worth the $8, toys that come w/the meal are the ones u get from the quarter machines. They come w/Capri sun pouch also, without kids menu the Capri sun is $1 each, which doesn't sound like a lot but u can buy a box of 10 Capri sun for $2. Kids mostly ate the fries which were good. But could've saved $16 off the bill and just ordered side of fries for them.
Adults ordered chicken katsu w/curry sauce on the side, and bowl of beef curry ramen. Chicken katsu portion was a little small for the $9 pd especially when you're used to getting larger portions at a Hawaiian BBQ place, but the taste was alright. Beef curry ramen sounds weird but definitely works! It was like eating a beef curry stew(it had potato & carrots) but with ramen in it. It's worth a try if you're in the mood for curry. We got the tuna poke app which disappeared in 1min by my hubby so I'm assuming it was delish. For dessert we got the honey toast, don't mistake it for French toast because we got plain toasted pieces of bread covered in honey topped w/ vanilla tea ice cream. It was still good but would've been awesome if it were actual French toast as advertised. And to go my daughter got a coconut smoothie bobs drink which was better than I expected it to taste. 
All in all not bad but a little pricey when u add kids meals, dessert and sides.

Not a bad place for ramen considering we folks here in Las Vegas are severely limited with authentic ramen choices.  Call me old school, but I still have the idea the best ramen joints ever are the ones where it's a huge hole-in-the-wall.  Not catering to anyone, but being able to knock your socks off with a simple bowl of noodles and broth.

I hate to say it but Anime Ramen is a bit gimmicky for my tastes.  Sure, I guess it's cool to have little Asian girls trot around in their form-fitting cosplay outfits, and have various anime posters all around.  But for me it takes away from the experience of a true bowl of ramen.  Ramen to folks in Japan is simple, comforting, and in many ways an art form.  The ingredients used to make your broth, the way you make your noodles so they have the right chew, and the additions you add to your bowl are supposed to evoke zen-like feelings when all is done correctly.  Well, that's what I hear anyway.  The environment at Anime Ramen just kinda distracts me from trying to enjoy my bowl of ramen!  

I'll give the cosplay girls credit though, they do a good job with service.  Attentive, kind, and pretty on point.  No complaints there.  But the food just didn't leave any kind of lasting impression on me.  It was ok, nothing special to me.

I tried the shoyu ramen that night.  For $8 I thought it was a bit on the skimpy side, the bowl was small!  I really wish there was more noodles for me to slurp up.  The broth was rather bland for my tastes.  I didn't get much of a shoyu flavor, or a deep broth flavor of any kind for that matter so it left me a bit disappointed.  I added extra soy sauce to the bowl and it tasted a bit better but still not good enough.  Maybe the broth could have used more beef or pork bones?  Perhaps more bonito?  Or maybe even a dash of MSG?  I dunno, it just wasn't that great for me.

I also tried the teriyaki chicken rice plate.  That was ok too, not the best teriyaki but not the worst.  Chicken was on the small size of portions (I am over 200 pounds people!), but at least the rice was good and the veggies were cooked just right.  

There are other things to try on their little menu, various other ramen bowls, teriyaki dishes, a few salads, and appetizers including teri sliders and furikake fries which I've heard are very good.  And nothing over the menu is $10 or so.  Value wise it sounds good, but man do those portions seem small!  This place is great for you lighter eaters.

Me thinks that you are unfortunately paying for the anime-themed ambiance.  I place way more stock in the quality, quantity and taste of your food.  Size matters!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,0,3,qmUBVacsYhhXQDYCAdi2gg

The second visit was similar experience. But during my latest visit this week, either the restaurant has changed their owner or the chef completely dropped the ball. The teriyaki beef was very dry and the ramen was not even the same quality. I was very disappointed I have to downgrade this to a 2-star and probably will not go back again.

My buddy got the miso ramen and an avocado smoothie & I got the tonkatsu ramen and teri-sliders.
Both of the soups lacked flavor from their broth and was waaaay oily! The pork meat they put in there was pretty much all fat, edible but gross. The avocado smoothie was good but the boba was the kind that fell apart in your mouth. The best thing I had was the teri-sliders. You get 4 to an order which comes with LTO & a yummy teriyaki sauce.

Here are my notes:

1) They charge you per can of soda.
2) Tried the calamari, and while it was cooked well, it was bland. The only saving grace was the fact that there was some sriracha at the table to help give it some flavor.
3) Tried the Tonkotsu ramen ($8.99), added extra charsui ($2.50), mushrooms (uh regular american white mushrooms), and bok choy...  all of it bland. the broth, the charsui, the bok choy, bland. I tried adding hot sauce, soy sauce (they only had low-sodium), and it was still bland. Didn't even finish my meal.

So in the end a expensive bowl of ramen that isnt worth it. Go to Monta or Ichiza or Ramen Sora.

Phones out, we started looking for other places to eat. Within a couple of moment the boyfriend found a ramen place and off we went.

Anime Ramen is located in Chinatown just outside of the strip (do not worry its safe to move away from the glitziness of the city lights and try something new). The center that it is in also has a boba place along with a couple of other places to eat at. Parking can be a little crazy and the drivers will run you off the road if you are not watching! There you have been warned my friends!

Entering into this place the first thing I see is the huge Hello Kitty on the wall along with artwork of various Anime characters. A large LCD flat screen that had an Anime show on which kept catching my eye as I was looking over the comic like menu. 
The girls who work here all are super cute with their different colored wigs and outfits. 

Prices are not bad at all (everything was under $10.00)... Outside of serving different kinds of Ramen, they also have....

-Sushi (limited)
-Karaage chicken wings
-Gyoza
-Sliders
-Teriyaki chicken
-Takoyaki
-Fried Rice

Along with desserts:

-Honey Toast
-Tempura Ice Cream
-Mochi Ice Cream

They also have milk tea boba and slush boba teas as well....

Ordered the Shoyu Ramen-Noodles, Hardboiled egg, slices of pork, seaweed, bamboo shoots, and green onions. This Ramen was pretty light and filling, as I could not finish the small bowl. The noodles were soft and pork slices were tender. The broth was good and not salty.

A small ramen shop store with the hostesses and waitresses creatively and interestingly dressed head-to-toe in awesome cosplay and cute Anime characters, is located in a plaza on the corner of Arville and Spring Mountain. This delicious Japanese anime-influenced restaurant is in the heart of Chinatown, as well as in my heart as one of the best places to go for food and lots of fun =)

ATMOSPHERE: Exterior they have a menu board as well as pictures of Anime lining the side walls of the restaurant. In the interior of the restaurant the walls, flat TV screens, waitresses and even the menu are decked out in everything ""Japanese anime"". It's warm and inviting and the booths provide ample space to relax and hangout with friends.

FOOD: Although they have their flavor-packed and topping-laden ramen and udon noodle soups, I usually go for the rice dishes so I like to order the Kimchi Fried Rice with Pork Belly or the House Fried Rice with Chicken. Both entrees are well under $10, and the portions are a very good size. 

There are condiments on every table as well so because I love Sriracha on everything that's a big plus for me. The milk tea boba drinks that they serve are seriously so good and refreshing to go along with all my spicy rice dishes. My favorites are the Almond or Coconut Milk Tea with Boba. 

Lastly, the desserts. Oh for the sweet delicious love of desserts! I can't get enough of the Honey French Toast with Vanilla Ice Cream, or the Fried Bananas with Green Tea Ice Cream. Try it, you won't regret it =)

On the other hand, Anime Ramen is in your face. In a good way. I love all the canvases spread out around their walls. There's barely an empty spot. With bright and playful colors, they've done a great job of transporting you to a different world.

I admit that I don't know that much about anime. A Rurouni Kenshin piece on the wall looked familiar, but I had to ask my friend to confirm. However, I was excited to see them playing Howl's Moving Castle on the screens--it's one of my favorite Miyazaki films.

Oh right. You probably want to know about the food. I figured I should try the Tonkotsu Ramen as a baseline comparison metric. To be honest, I haven't been to Monta in a long time. And at 28GO, I had something different. Nevertheless, Anime Ramen's Tonkotsu was delicious. The broth was flavorful without being salty (though I've never experienced the overly salty broth at Monta that other people seem to complain about). I didn't even add any condiments to spice it up--my friends went to town with the chili pastes and powders and the like. I was content to savor the soup the way it came out.

The tthing is ..I've tasted better BUT...Thats if you are from a region like So-Cal or a place that has a lot of japanes food spots like japan town in SF.  If thats the case = you may be disappointed with the food you get here...But lets face it, we are in Las Vegas...you scale needs to adjust according to the competition a business has, how long they've been in business..(they usually get better or just go outta business..lol) and customer service!...So all in all.. I LIKE!

This place is cute, definitely different than the spots here in vegas.  The service was nice.  My server's name is Kim and she did a pretty good job of serving us even as every booth filled after we were seated.  


We order Kim Chi fried rice and Shoyu.  The Kim Chi fried rice was good, spicy but not to the extreme.  Flavor was decent.  The shoyu was not bad but it was a tad bland (could use a bit more sea salt). They are currently offering free milk tea/thai tea boba drinks for ordering Entrees.  The idea was great but I have to say, I've had better boba drinks.  The flavor was good but they put too much ice into the free drink..guess thats why its free to begin with.  The boba was firm/chewy on the inside but soggy on the exterior.  I know they were fresh but a quick tip for you guys if you are reading ANIME RAMEN: instead of keeping them in water after you are done...Boil for 25-35 mins, then cover the pot and turn off the stove..let sit for 25-30 mins...Then strain and mix with pure honey......That will keep it from sticking to each other rather than leaving them in warm water for extended periods of time (causing the soggyness of the boba :( 

Secondly...I know it takes a bit more time, but cook the boba twice a day...if you could afford the time,   you have a rush during lunch time, another rush for dinner..make sure they are fresh for dinner time.  Less ice in the drinks please (3.50 is a bit hefty to pay for that much milk tea)

Otherwise, I will be coming back.  Thanks again Kim for the awesome genuine customer service.  Oh and expand the menu please!


Come visit and comment on yelp about their service.  As Kim mentioned they read this stuff and the next time you come in, you'll get free mochi ice cream for commenting...constructive critisms are also welcome as confirmed by the waitress so go on : post away!!

Both of those worlds combine into one of the cuter restaurants I've been to.  Anime Ramen happily provides what you would expect from their name.

The walls are decorated with art from different anime, the TV shows anime, and the waitresses wear colorful wigs that would not look out of place in an anime.  I didn't see any giant robots or guys with spike hair and huge swords, but I guess that would have taken away from the cute factor.

Soups offered here are interesting in that you first choose your broth, followed by the type of noodles.  Broths include your shoyu, tonkotsu and miso ramens, but also include other varieties such as tom yum.  Noodles can either be ramen or udon.  Based on ramen being part of the restaurant name, I've tried the shoyu ramen and tonkotsu ramen.

The ramen here is good, though the meal is a bit of a rollercoaster ride for me.  There are no add-ons available for your ramen (aw), but all the bowls do include a boiled egg and seaweed (yay!).  Instead of getting only two slices of chashu pork you're treated to three (yay!), but I think that it could have used a bit more boiling and flavor (aw).  The broths are flavorful and not salty, so its easy to find yourself slurping up every last drop.  The tables don't have garlic and ginger for you to add to your soup, but you can ask for some ginger from the kitchen.

I think your experience here will depend on what you like the most abouta bowl of ramen.  For me, it all averaged out to a decent bowl that I will enjoy every now and then in the future.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,5,2,3,pZWLRJjixK8KULHcabu8ew

4934411,2011-11-19,7,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"Not too shabby!  Great place to bring the kids to. I read reports of several of the Yelpers and figured I had to try it. 

1.  Location - Just west of the Chinatown Plaza mall in the next strip mall. Easy parking.

2.  Ambiance - WOW Factor.  Outside is decorated in Anime.  Inside it is hard to determine what to look at first. The petite waitresses in anime costume that is really cool, or the decor on the wall and the TV's showing DragonBall Z.  Everything is just right and in really good taste.

3.  Service - As mentioned, the ladies are dressed in anime wear.  It is very cool and they are very attentive and timely. With a fairly busy restaurant, about 75% full, we had excellent service. Food comes out quickly.

4.  Food We had quite a variety, me, the wife and two of our kids. 

Shoyu Ramen - Noodles were right texture and taste. Very enjoyable. Lots of pork egg, and other bits combined with the right quantity and not too much fat at all on the pork.  The egg must have been cooked in shoyu as it was a bit dark colored. Nice presentation.  The broth was a bit simple, not too many flavors at all, however, for my kids, this is the preferred method.  We asked for smaller bowls to share so i spiced mine up a bit.

Chicken Wings - Really not wings, but seemed to be more like chicken kara-age. The waitress told us it was boneless, and it was, however, perhaps it should be just marketed as fried chicken instead. Overall, nice taste, light, crispy and with two sauces.

Sliders - Small little burgers that seemed to be lightly marinated in teriyaki.  The patty is about size of a flattened golf ball with tomato, lettuce on what looks to be a toasted King's Hawaiian Sweet Roll. It is about 3 inches round and about 4 inches tall, nicely kept together with a bamboo type of skewer.  Excellent taste, very light and very cool presentation.  WE had four sliders which was perfect for our family of four. I do not know if it always comes to four per plate or not, so you may want to check.

Chicken Teriyaki - We also shared a plate of Chicken Teriyaki and rice. Comes with a heaping scoop of macaroni salad, nice portion of lean chicken lightly covered in teriyaki sauce, two sushi rolls, and rice.  I did not get to notice the type of sushi roll it was, as one of my kids was quick to abscond with them and scarf them down. it was perhaps a california roll with the sesame seed on outside?

California Roll - Comes 6 to an order and was very nice. Not too strong on the vinegar taste of the rice. It was pretty good. I am not a huge Western Sushi eater, meaning I eat it when we have it, but will generally order typical Nigiri, Chirashi, or Inari Sushi.  Everyone liked it and it was devoured quickly!

Honey Toast Ice Cream - We were not really ready to order any dessert, however, the waitress mentioned it was a real popular dish. This is like french toast with ice Cream drizzled in Honey. It was an odd thing tio think about, yet the presentation was awesome and the taste subtle and flavorful

Overall - To me, in a way, coming here is like a guilty pleasure.  While not the best in any one thing, it is very good in presentation. I believe that Monta has more traditional and flavorful Ramen, however, when you combine pretty good food, with great service, and wonderful decor, it all combines to be a really fun experience.  When I was here, there was a strong overwhelming amount of single men coming here vs. family and couples. Perhaps anime waitresses is the key?  Hmmmm......

This is not ramen, this is not even Japanese.  You are better off going to the store and buying cup ramen for 79 cents.

4960189,2012-04-04,2,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"This place was a totally random discovery for me. A girl who was my friend on Facebook had mentioned it, and I definitely was curious about it. It's a long drive and kind of a pain to get to, but the fact that they have me coming back on a regular basis now should say something.

Essentially, this is a small cafe/restaurant serving Asian dishes, and the servers are all cutesy oriental girls in brightly-colored wigs, who are apparently supposed to resemble anime-syle characters. Definitely a novel concept I haven't seen anywhere else. And it works. The restaurant is fairly small, but is decorated with many anime posters, and large TVs air various anime movies/episodes/etc. There is even a bookshelf with manga at the front that you can borrow to read during your visit, which is nice. I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the atmosphere and the personalities of the servers, but I don't see any of this stuff as an issue. I love it in this place. Everyone I have dealt with in here has given me great service, and all of the girls seem knowledgeable about everything on the menu.

As for the food itself, it is better than I was expecting for a place like this. I am more of a chicken person, as any one of my friends will tell you, and the chicken dishes I have had here have all been very good. The curry chicken is possibly the best version of this dish I have had at any Asian-style restaurant. The Furikake fries also come strongly recommended as something you and your party can get and share. A strong selection of beverages is offered, including normal soft drinks, bottled drinks, and boba tea and other things of that sort. The menu is not huge, but there really is something for everyone on it, and every item on the menu is $8 or less, which is nice. It's great to have a fun little ""lunch place"" I can go to like this, that won't break the bank. 

The issues I have with this place are minor. Mainly, I just wish the menu was a little bigger. The place is not perfect, but it is far better than some other people's reviews have made it out to be. You might say some of the other reviews on here ""take the place too seriously.""

The Husband enjoyed their Tonkatsu Ramen, while I devoured their Pork Belly on Rice dish. Um, hello...I'm all over pork belly!  (We have that stuff in our freezer ready to go!)    

Seriously, I'm not the expert on ramen, so I can't say too much about it.  But it was the Baby's first go at ramen and he was eating it all up.  Then again, it was his first meal of 'regular' food, and no wonder he was eating it all up!  And every time we drive by, I think about their Pork Belly!  So perhaps my high ratings is really for their Pork Belly and not actually what they are known for...their ramen.

Service - the girls were sweet in their brightly colored wigs but maybe not the brightest at that moment.  I asked for a high chair and she said they didn't have one, but offered a booster chair.  Towards the end of my meal, I see two high chairs in the corner.  Hmmm...I guess she didn't know and she didn't ask anyone either.  When the Baby knocked off a completely full glass of water all over the table and floor, the staff didn't bat an eye and immediately started cleaning it up.  (Thanks for not making us feel bad!)

Discovered they are in partnership with Hui Thai, Mr. Sandwich, Satay, and the former Vietnamese shop that occupied that space.

As far as food, the Pork Belly rice bowl was the Filipino Pork Adobe over rice. Nothing too great to get the tummy tickled. I was disappointed because the picture on the menu looked crispy and savory. My bowl was fatty and slimy. 

From what I saw, my family ordered the infamous BFF ramen and all i saw was just another disappointed face. The noodles were undercooked and the both was just water. No flavor or satisfied faces.

So their honey toast is more honey french toast instead of the toasted box served upstairs. BF thinks he likes this better. I think they're both good but different. It hit the spot. BF and I also got a taro boba shake which was solid, but the boba was slightly softer than I would like. 

Can't really comment on the namesake as I havent gotten that yet. 

Now, when we said we wanted a boba shake, water and some honey toast our server made a face and was kinda pissy about it I guess because we weren't there to eat or didn't order one honey toast each. She even told us we should order two! I would think that's better than no money. Pfft.

Anime Themed Menu, Check: Just look at the dang menu and you know what am talking about.
Anime Server, Check: Dont know where they hired these girls but they sure look like they come out from a comic book.
Most importantly Good Food.. Tonkatsu were bomb, if only they can make the takoyaki a little bit better. Spicy kimchi noodle were so so.

I ordered the tonkasu ramen ($8.50), and the broth was pretty light (aka not much pork fat, not much oil, not too authentic).  How ever the char siu was very tender and delicious!  Fatty & melt in your mouth amazing.  

Also tried the hambugu steak with mushrooms, it was quite small, and they only gave a few mushrooms.  It was alright.

The furikake fries sounded interesting, but in actuality they tasted like normal fries with a ""hint"" of seasoning.  

Also had almond milk tea which wasn't too great.  It was too powdery at first; I could literally taste a powder chunk, so we asked them to re-make it.

Then the second time i tried kaage wings, while i was eating them i couldn't help but to think ""what does this need??"" SAUCE! So i asked the waitress and they had a sweet and sour sauce...IT WAS AMAZING, they should really offer that as a side or just dip it in, i don't care.

One thing is consistent at Anime Ramen and it is the push to up sell. The first time I came here, it was with some Yelpers after dinner. The goal was to get honey toast. Between the three of us, we got a dessert to split and the other two got a drink. The server looked put off. It wouldn't have been fair of me to review it then, so I waited to come back for it's namesake. 

The second time, a group of five of us came in for dinner. We got three boba drinks, a pop, hot tea, some fries, two salads, three ramens, and a fried rice. Yet again, it felt like we were getting pushed to order more and more. I understand getting people to buy more food can mean a larger tip. Take into prospective that hassling guests can also mean a lower tip. Our bill came out to $60, we still left 20%, but it might have been more if the emphasis was put on attention to service and not racking up our bill.

The boba are warm and fresh. A little chewy, but still soft for my liking. My Avocado Smoothie($4.50) was decent. It was more sweet than anything else. The creaminess of the avocado was masked by sugar. Tried my friend's Almond Milk ($3.50) and it was borderline marzipan sweetness. 

The Ramens range from $8-$10 and they are decent. The Tofu Salad ($5) was the most memorable item of the night. I could have easily ordered two of these and called it a meal.

Don't get me wrong: I like my anime.  I grew up on the staples of Akira, Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D and a good ol' fashioned Studio Ghibli film or five.  This place really took me to that nerdtastic time in my life.

The set-up is great: Bright, cheery, with upbeat J-Pop playing as anime dressed girls greet you in Japanese.  The art is everywhere, but is very nice and classy (I do wish they had some of the old-school classics, but what they had was fun).  On TV, some Pokemon episode was playing.  When we walked in, we were the only ones there.  About halfway through our meal, the place became packed.  Talk about good timing.

The food, however, was just right for the outing.  Their gyoza is pretty darn tasty, as are their HUGE bowls of ramen.  Everything was hot and flavorful.  Even their boba teas were excellent and sweet.

Service was very nice.  The girls checked by often, but not enough to become overbearing.  They were always on top of things, and super friendly.  I appreciate the effort they put into their costumes.  It's not as crazy as some theme restaurants that I've been, but it still makes it point that the name of their game is anime.  Even their little business cards are styled after one of those trading card games, which I found charming.  It's the appreciation to details (and the tasty food) that made this experience memorable.

So memorable, in fact, that it ensures that I'll be going to this place again, and soon.  It's a neat, clever idea, and I'm glad that someone obviously has fun with the business that they run.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,4,3,4,zIBd_ke2fgeq2uj3sulKoQ

The waitresses are all done up in anime costumes as is the entire theme of the restaurant.  The costumes are elaborate and looks like a considerable amount of time is put into prepping the anime look.  

Sadly, I hope the Herbert the Pervert isn't a regular here simply to fulfill a fettish I'd rather not expound on.  But if you are looking for an experience, Hooters girls, eat your heart out, lol.

Unfortunately, not all the employees are dressed up, primarily the dudes...not saying that it was a deal breaker to not have cartoonified males serving me noodle soup, but it would be nice if they kept it consistent.

Now if Akira came out in blob form to ask me what I wanted to drink, I would order anything just to see him blob around, lol.

Otherwise, the meals we ordered did its job, add cushion for the alcohol pushin...

I rate this place a 3 merely on the costumes alone!",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,0,3,jN1OAmBCcdK2PR6Kv3NtUg

I came to Anime Ramen& Teriyaki with my boyfriend, who is an anime geek like me :p. The place seems to get a lot of business since it was packed for a Sunday night! We ordered some gyoza for appetizers (which were pretty food) and I ordered the miso ramen for $8 (which is a bit pricey from other ramen joints I've been in Little TOkyo in Downtown LA). It was hot and was well seasoned...but it had a bunch of toasted sesame seeds which I kinda of chocked on and coughed for a minute :o.

Any who, THE FOOD! First off, I decided to try their boba milk tea (cappuccino flavor) which wasn't a good idea. The end taste was a little weird and it also made me bloated (I usually get water so I guess I shouldn't get anything other than that) so I got full easier (probably different for you guys).

The ramen was pretty yummy. I definitely liked it. I saw the beansprouts as being a little odd but it actually fit in quite well for me. The ramen was $8 but we came during their 25% off soft opening special so it ended up to be $6 for us. My tonkotsu ramen came with the pork and the egg.

Service is a bit off cause I had to ask three times before I got my water. The servers are dressed in anime outfits (especially their colorful hair) and they're friendly. I'll probably try their boba smoothie (my friend loved the strawberry boba smoothie) next time with some appetizers ^^v.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,1,3,jvyGwUwQwCCSy61jslFqHQ

I say manga theme because the cute waitresses wear colorful wigs and Japanese cartoon outfits modeled after Anime magazines and the menu has Spicy! and Hot! popping out at you in cartoonish fonts.  That's the biggest draw, though, because the food itself was somewhat bland and it took a long time for it to come out.  I got the miso ramen and split an order of kim chi fried rice and karaage chicken, but my ramen tasted bland and wasn't too exciting.  The chicken was too oily and the meat was dry but crispy.  The fried rice was just ok too but not that memorable.  I don't mean to nitpick, I guess I was expecting some pop out at you flavor and excitement from a cartoon themed restaurant.  I wanted to like it, it's a cute place and the waitresses are really cute.

The ramen is quite good, but the real draw of this place is the theme and atmosphere.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 5th star is because I have had better ramen in Los Angeles.",0XQUGlil2YwXx4jGSx8hXA,6,3,4,W3qbLum0ZJkKRncMW9JbzA

The food wasn't bad but nothing stood out as omg. I did like their seasoned fries but the seasoning didnt stay on the fries and made eating them kinda difficult. The fried dishes were lightly battered and the food fresh making a delightful appetizer.

Before I forget (not that I would ever forget how bad this was) They have a fried banana that is just not right. Bananas are supposed to be served cold and eating a hot mushy banana was just kinda disgusting. I would assume this would be like eating hot baby food and would explain a few eating disorders in young children.

The Ramen dishes were served in large bowels and had great flavor. The sushi dishes were fresh but serving sizes were kinda small. The names were amusing and the presentation on the plates were cute. The teenage girls I was there with loved the hello kitty plate.

Ok the anime theme was cool and we all caught ourselves watching different shows. The wait staff was sexy in their costumes and very patient explaining different dishes and the rules on the big wheel they have. 

We were there for an early lunch but they allowed the girls to spin the wheel and gave them free cookies for playing.

We were a table of 4 and our bill was $65. Seemed a bit high for a lunch tab but we all left full and enjoyed our time there so Im considering it money well spent.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,1,3,eJJQ9ZP8KqJEOv5O7zrTsg

You have waitresses in pink and purple wigs (missing the big eyes), anime pictures hanging on the walls, Final Fantasy Advent Children playing on the flat screen LCDs mounted on the wall, and the menu is designed like a manga. I have a few fanboy friends who would easily salivate hearing about this.

It was a mellow night when we went. The parking lot of the plaza sucks, but most Asian plazas are like that anyway. It wasn't crowded at all though, as we got a table right away.  

The menu offers an assortment of Japanese dishes along with your typical ramen with your choice of soup base. I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen. 

The ramen itself is decent. The soup was rich and flavorful. Cloudy just the way I like it. The noodles itself has a firmer texture, I prefer my ramen noodles softer. There were a few slices of chashu and half an egg. I had to order extra noodles to fill me up. 

I don't it beats any ramen joints in LA in terms of flavor. However it's pretty good for what you get in Vegas's Chinatown.",tPJ1g7cErzV4Rlfpaef4Zw,10,7,4,f1CKdE2dxzRIb-01FAJb3Q
5918602,2011-09-18,3,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"Dropped by after finding out about this new ramen and teriyaki restaurant via Yelp. From all of the anime characters outside, one might think that it is a video or anime or comic store, but it clearly has ""ramen & Teriyaki"" after Anime. The restaurant is still in its soft opening phase of operation, so business is still relatively slow and there is a 25%off soft opening promotion.

When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by two uber cute and very cheerful waitresses.  The place was empty, but nicely decorated (although the waitress said it looks like a pho restaurant - a nicely decorated new pho restaurant) with many anime paintings or art works on the wall, so I basically picked where I like to be seated.

The menu has a comic strip look to it, a nice touch.  

After checking out the menu, I opted to try Karaage Chicken Wings and Tonkotsu Ramen. The chicken wings were fried perfectly, but it was served with ketchup, which I thought was untraditional (chicken karaage is also traditionally boneless).  I think a simple wedge of lemon would have been a better choice.

The Tonkotsu Ramen (they source the ramen from the same purveyor that supplies Monta and Big Wong), but the noodle was not prepared as well as those served at Monta on my 1st visit. But I also don't think they hired a ramen chef directly from Japan either. For now Monta's ramen is still better than the ones served here.

Finished the meal with Tempura Ice Cream.  It is a good size, not the small ones served at the AYCE sushi places. But the waitress told me to try their Honey Toast, which she said was not as sweet as the ones served upstairs at Ichiza (I could not remember if I ordered that there or not, but will see about getting this on my next visit).

Ordered the Tom Yum Chicken Ramen (9-18-11) and the ramen was cooked a lot better tonight.  The broth was yummy and maybe a 3 spicy level. Different waitresses, not as talkative but still very pretty, so still a positive experience.

Decor/Ambiance: 4/5  Definitely sticking to the theme, although there are still a lot of room to go in the decorating department, such as Anime-related items as decoration on the tables (under a sheet of protective glass of course), photos of cosplayers that dine at the restaurant, anime figures, etc.  Even some of the waitresses are dressed in maid outfits like in some Anime, although some only donned anime-colored wigs and graphic tees. 

Service:  4.5/5  Very friendly, energetic, and attentive. (I definitely gave an extra star for this, although your mileage may vary depending on the waitress, your youthful good looks and AXE application)

Food:  3.5/5  Some items still need fine tuning, but that is to be expected for a new restaurant in the soft opening phase.  Would suggest serving more soup in the ramen, lemon wedge or alternative dipping sauce for the fried wings, serving the ramen WITHOUT the spoon already in the bowl.

Alcohol:  Will be on the menu once the proper licensing and other requirements are in order.

Price:  2.5/5  All items are under $10. Ramen (san the 25% soft opening discount) is priced higher than Monta, but comes with 1/2 shoyu boiled egg. Personally I think at the 25% off price, it is a competitive Japanese casual comfort food dining spot, but a harder sell without.

Value: 2-3/5  Not going to win any Best Deals in LV awards, but will not break the wallet either.

Location:  5/5  Very centrally located in Chinatown, not that far down the street from the Palazzo, Wynn, and Treasure Island. Just downstairs from Ichiza and a few doors down from Yagyu.

Parking:  You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya punk????

Final thoughts:  This could possibly be a great ""wotaku"" hangout in Las Vegas or just a nice friendly place to chill out and watch whatever Anime they happened to have on at the time. Waitresses are definitely the friendliest I have encountered around LV.  Have yet to wait for a table, and the place is larger and seats more people than Monta.

Note:  Accepts debit cards and only MasterCard at the moment, which hopefully will change after Chase card processing is also approved.

The Anime character decor is cute and the waitresses are unique with their outfits, but those are the only good things going for this place.

The food needs a lot of work. I have tried:

-Shoyu and Miso Ramen: The broth was very bland and the noodles were too hard. You know it's bad when you feel like you can make a tastier bowl of instant ramen at home. 
-Gyoza: tasted like one of the frozen brands that you can buy at the grocery store. 
-California Roll: it was okay. I mean, it's hard to screw up a California Roll right?
-Furikake Fries: interesting concept, but the furikake does not stay on the fries. They might as well just serve regular fries only. 
-Honey Toast with Ice Cream: probably their best menu item. Nice presentation, tasty and not too sweet. 

The service also needs a lot of work. Other than our very first visit, the servers have been horrible. We either always have to ask for drink refills or we get nothing at all. On our last visit I had to ask for napkins because they forgot to give us some. There were 9 of us at the table. Really?! Also, don't even think about ordering sliders because for some reason, they take forever to come out of the kitchen. Parking? Nonexistent.

I think they have more variety than monta, but Monta is by far the best Ramen place I have eaten at so far. I have eaten at a ramen place in hawaii, I still think monta is better. The only difference here is that their noodles already come with all the different add ons, and monta's is pretty plain...but I guess simplicity is better. Price wise it was ok too.

5939171,2012-02-06,12,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"Before I talk about the quality of the food and service at ""Anime Ramen"", I first want to address something that has caught my attention. I have lived in Las Vegas for a long time, and noticed the rivalry and dislike that many of the Asians have for each other here. As I read the reviews below and the reviews for many other Asian owned establishments here on yelp, I notice that there is always a group of conservative Japanese, Filipino, and mainland Chinese yelpers who give negative ratings to a business all on account of the owner being a member of an Asian nationality that they dislike. Most my family immigrated to America in the 1800s from Japan, and since the beginning we and all the Chinese, Koreans, and other races of Asians, TOGETHER  had to endure Anti-Asian laws, discrimination, internment camps, and mass deportation. They banned our marriage, they put us in concentration camps, they deported us, they taxed us for just being Asian, they took our houses and savings, they rioted and burned down our businesses, and they took away all our freedom and dignity. They didn't care what particular type of Asian we were.. we were all the same to them. As Asian-AMERICANS, we ALL had to endure the same discrimination TOGETHER.  Instead of hating each other, we should be united especially due to our history of enduring hate. This is America, and we all have the right to be here and we should all live together in peace. If you disagree with that, and dislike diversity then go back to whatever Asian country you came from and leave us Asian-AMERICANS alone.

Getting to the subject of ""Anime Ramen"". I personally believe that ""Anime Ramen"" has a better Miso Ramen than the much more popular ""Monta"". Though I think that ""Monta"" has the best Shoyu in the world, I think that the Miso Ramen isn't that great.  As we all already know, Miso Ramen is my favorite food in the world. I like Miso Ramen more than I like crack and various other narcotics(just kidding, but I really do love Miso Ramen). ""Anime"" has a thinner yet more flavorful Miso broth that I really enjoy. The broth is very similar to the popular ""Chin Ma Ya"" in Little Tokyo, LA.    
 
One of the best things about ""Anime Ramen"" is that they throw in many of the sides for free. At ""Monta"", they charge extra for corn, eggs, and a 3rd slice of Charsiu. At ""Anime"", you get the egg, 3 slices of charsiu, and the corn all included. Also, ""Monta"" makes you buy extra noodles on the side because they don't give that much in the first place. At ""Anime"" you get a lot of noodles, and a bowl of broth which is probably about 30% larger than other Ramen houses in Las Vegas.

Surprisingly, they also have really good french fries here for people who can't eat Asian food. This is great because I have a lot of European friends who just cannot eat anything that comes from Asia(picky eaters). I wish they had those Teriyaki fries that you get at Hawaiian restaurants, but what they got here is good enough. I really recommend getting a side of their fries! 

The best thing about this place is that there is always a seat open. Sometimes at ""Monta"" I gotta wait 30 minutes to an hour to get a seat. I have never had to wait to be seated here at ""Anime"".  

Maybe the one problem I have here is that servers tend to be a little creepy and have way too much energy. As soon as I took my chopsticks out of the paper wrapper, the Neon Anime Girl sprinted over to me, took the wrapper out of my hand then ran across the room and threw it away in the trash can. Then a few minutes later I used my napkin, and the moment I put it back down on the table she sprinted over again, took it, and then ran away. I didn't even see her coming that time. It literally looked like she came out from under a table. BTW, I like to use my  napkin more than just once you know... The weirdest thing was that I told my server that I thought that the Miso Ramen here is better than ""Monta"", and she got all shocked and practically told me that it is not nice to say bad things about other restaurants even if they are competitors. 

I guess you can tell that the owner is not Japanese by the interior design. The art that is displayed on the walls are from Japanese anime's that were popular in America but not extremely popular amongst Japanese anime critics, such as: ""Naruto"", ""Pokemon"" and ""Sailor Moon"". A few years ago I went to an Anime themed restaurant which was owned by a man from Kobe. His restaurant was decorated with art from animes which had a lot of cultural significance in Japan, such as: ""Mazinger Z"", ""Battleship Yamato"" ""Galaxy Express 999"", ""A Girl of the Alps"", ""Cutey Honey"" ""Candy Candy"" and ""Mobile Suit Gundam"". That's the first clue in identifying if the place is actually Japanese owned, but who really cares about that. Even if this place was owned by someone named Marco Antonio Lopez, I would still come back here everyday because the service and food is really good.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,16,12,5,Mi-RkRVMnHC-kFjqY41mUQ

I would come back again one day but hopefully their service is better because they charge 18% for tip on the check, when they didn't even give that well of a service.

5959405,2013-06-25,4,I6u-OhmI_IUltexEOSCKzg,"My OG Ryan B and I had a date for a little foodie crawl and we decided to check out 28GO, we arrived and were disappointed to find out that they were closed until later in the week. Thwarted, we decided to head across town, during rush hour no less to check out another spot he had been wanting to check out in Chinatown. We walked in and I was already not feeling it. The theme is cute, but not executed as well as it could be. The atmosphere just left a lot to be desired, so I was having misgivings before I even ordered. Looking at the menu, nothing really sparked much interest in me, so I decided to order the spicy Tom yum with udon and tofu, thinking it was a relatively safe bet. Ryan B ordered the beef fried rice and a tempura appetizer. 

Our meals came out and there was an odd smell emanating from the bowl. Almost a little dirty smelling?I let it sit for a while so I could build up enough courage to take a bite. I kept trying and trying and even took two bites before I totally gave up. The flavor and smell were so off. I'm not one to send food back, so I was reluctant to do it. I finally decided to let them know that I really didn't like my dish and asked our waitress to return it to the kitchen. Our server was very kind and apologetic, quickly removed the dish and told me she would remove it from our check. I really appreciated the service and how friendly they were about it. I really didn't want to send my dish back, so I was glad that they weren't too offended. 

While I watched Ryan eat, I tried a piece of the tempura had ordered and it wasn't great. A little over battered and seemed like the frozen kind you buy prepackaged at the store. Just not fresh and lacked flavor. He seemed to enjoy his fried rice. The only saving grace for this restaurant was the friendly service, but I won't be back.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,7,2,7e3oigyGQpi4IqpKVPk_gw
