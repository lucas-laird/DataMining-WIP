1606595,2014-01-10,7,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"Came here for dinner. The inside was clean but they seem to have a few kinks to work out. One of the employees brought a menu and explained some of the food. The soda fountain wasn't working and I wasn't going to pay $1.25 for a bottle of water so the food was packed for take out instead of eating inside. The woman who took the order said they were having some issues getting the man out to hook up the machine. She also said they had a lot of delays in even opening at all. She seemed nice enough and appeared to mean well. Like I said they just have some kinks to work out.

My wife purchased a yelp deal... $10 for $20 and even though they changed the deal to $5 for $10, they honored what was purchased. The tortillas here are weird. The texture and taste remind me of the shell they use on Gorditas at Taco Bell. It wasn't dry or anything but I didn't care for it. I like a more traditional tortilla. The quesadilla wasn't very good. It was a tad overcooked and the cheese was funky. The rice has a good taste... kind of like they maybe cooked it with chicken stock? It was good. The beans had a good flavor but not in the bean and cheese burrito. I think it goes back to the tortillas here I'm not find of. I had a sizzle taco and really liked it. It was different and the taco shell was great. We shared a big white fluffy sweet thing for dessert. The name I don't remember but it was damn good. It reminded me of something I would eat at a carnival or some sort of fry bread.

Food was just OK.  It was not fantastic. . .but I realized after I ate that this is not your traitional Mexican place.  It is based off of New Mexican Cuisine which is different then tradtional Mexican food.  

Sopaipilla was just ok.  It was denser then I am used to. . .so I definitely will not be getting that again.  It was more along the lines of Navajo Fry Bread.  Totally not what I was expecting.  

CC Sizzle. . .that was the best one as the other reviews said.  I tried it as nachos and it was really really good.  I tried chilaquiles.  It was not good.  I normally love it BUT this one was sub par.  

Am I planning on going there again?  YES!  Why?  Because I love to support mom and pop style shops and because they have GREEN NEW MEXICO HATCH CHILES!!  =)

2936570,2014-08-05,5,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"We stumbled upon this little gem, it's around the corner from my husbands' new work location.

Damn, this place is crazy good, fresh, full of flavor and MADE TO ORDER. Are you kidding me?  It's like sitting in your abuelitas house while she cooks just for you. All the while you are drinking green kool-aid and watching cartoons in her living room, on her couch covered in a clear plastic cover. Just like that.

The place is small, sits in a small business center right behind a gas station. DO NOT LET THIS store front fascade scare you away. Inside is the cutest little mexican restaurant with modern decor you will ever find. There are only 4 tables (square) that seat 4 people each. Don't fret, take out is available also.

We were the only customers in the  place, we arrived at 7 p.m. and they close at 8 (On Sunday, which is today) so we got their full attention. The owner and his wife (I believe she was the cook) treated us like we were family. The owner recommended the CC Sizzle and the green chile chicken enchiladas. He explained that the green chile is from a certain region in New Mexico (which is why the taste will be very different from many other mexican restaurants) and let me tell you..we ordered that shit right up.

My husband tried the CC Sizzle on the sopapilla (we've never tried one before) and I ordered the green chile and chicken enchiladas in verde sauce...for the love of god. So damn good and the best enchiladas I HAVE EVER HAD. I have traveled to many states and eaten at many different restaurants, I guarantee you will not have a better enchilada hit your mouth.

My youngest daughter, who is 8, hates mexican food. She ate two of their chicken hard shell tacos and ate them both exclaiming ""I have never eaten so much mexican food in my life, it's because these are so delicious...I can't wait to come back"" Our sentiments exactly, my husband, older daughter and I agree 100% .

The owner checked on us, when he could've been getting ready to close. He was attentive, super sweet and just a good soul. He made us 3 complimentary dessert sopapilas with powdered sugar and honey, to go along with the one that came with my daughters' kids meal. He talked to my husband and I about the original restaurant that still resides in New Mexico, been open since 1960 something. My husband let me try (before he devoured) the CC Sizzle sopapila and it was delicious, flavorful and fresh off the grill.

Love, love, love this spot. Told him I would be back for round 2 tomorrow, because I want to bring a friend who just moved to Vegas, so she can tell her friends, and they can tell their friends and keep this spot open for many years like it's first location.

The rest of the family loved their meals as well. Before we left, the cook came out and placed warm sopaipillas covered in cinnamon on our table & said they were ""on the house"". Once again, delicious. As we were leaving, we paid & tipped our lovely waiter. Much to our surprise, he did not even want the tip! After some insisting though, he did kindly accept.

3519514,2014-01-03,22,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"I bought a yelp deal ($10 for $20) a few months back for this place not knowing they weren't open yet. Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was ""coming soon"" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Café Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? 

Walking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the ""Coke man"" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. 

Some of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Café Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of ""Sizzle"" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! 

Sizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. 

Sopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. 

As I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a ""New Mexico Flair"" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!

The inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Café Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try!

3684425,2014-07-18,1,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"I just ordered here delivery with the eat24 app. I was pretty excited to see Mexican delivery. I really only wanted a snack as I am at the office working late and I will likely go home to dinner in a few hours. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa. 

The chips and salsa was kind of standard, salsa not bad, see myself ordering them again. 

The quesadilla however I probably won't eat again, and it is not because it was bad. They have these home made tortillas which I think most people may like, but it just was almost like a bread and for me I think it was to much bread. They came with some very awesome cheesy potatoes and refried beans. Big fan. 

This was a lot of food for the money. What great value. 

All in all my food was probably slightly less than 4 stars for my tastes, but I can't wait to try them again as i feel I would likely rate a different selection 5 stars.

3864171,2014-05-05,2,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"I purchased a groupon awhile back when they first opened and I'm finally getting around to using it. This place is located in a very small strip mall behind the gas station. The Christmas lights strung in the window is what caught my eye and led me here. 

We were warmly greeted by a husband and wife team. We were the only diners at the time, he gave us a very thorough run down of the menu items and had suggested the CC Sizzle, we picked Nacho Style. This was delicious. It was a blend of meat with onions, cabbage and cheese over their homemade tortilla chips. Our second item was the Green Chile Enchiladas, made with Hatch green chili's and chicken with creamy chili's sauce. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. 

We ended the meal with Sopaipillas. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I like mine with honey, and they had a few different types to choose from. 

This place is really casual. Even if you're dining in, your food is served in styrofoam to go container. The soda fountain wasn't working when we were there, bummer, I like a nice cold Coke when I'm eating Mexican food (only time I like soda). The owners were really nice, he was telling us all about where they're from in NM.

Decided to take his suggestion and ordered it. Got the nacho sizzle, beef enchiladas, and the chilaquiles. The nacho sizzle had good flavor in the meat, but had a large amount of grease. Dish consisted of taco meat and cabbage over chips. Chips got soggy from all the grease. Beef enchiladas had great flavor and didn't disappoint. However, enchiladas is a relatively easy dish to make. Chilaquiles was bland and was a soggy tortilla mess. This is a dish that could use some improvements. Presentation was on point and really liked the teamwork executed by the employees. Will have to try this place a second time to make sure it wasn't just an of day. Tried for a second time. Tried the bean and cheese burritos. Also tried the beef tacos.

Ohhh in addition they give 20 percent off teachers and first responders :) 

Service is fantastic, they gave us a sample of the cc sizzle on a nacho prior, which is VERY RARE in food places nowadays! So thank you for that, a few nacho samples and we bought 4 orders and a dessert! Sopapilla dessert is yummy I wish they had ice cream (it's coming soon)! The gentleman was so nice!!!!

4848138,2014-12-12,0,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"We were pretty convinced this place didn't really exist, but after months of casually looking for it, I finally found it. As noted in a previous review, they only have a banner in place of the sign next to the dry cleaners.

My whole family came in, and we all loved the food here. It is more American style Mexican, but delicious American style Mexican! The chips and salsa were great, although there weren't enough chips for the salsa. I think it'd be nice if these were complimentary for dine in customers, especially since it takes quite a bit of time for them to make the food. No one else came in during our visit, but they did seem to be very busy with delivery orders.

I had chicken tacos, and the style kind of reminded me of what you'd see at a buffet, except buffet tacos are disgusting, and these had great flavor with high quality chicken. Others in my group got enchiladas, which they enjoyed, and my niece got a bean and cheese burrito, which she complained about, but that may have just been because she was in a rush to get dessert. Strangely, there was something funny about the taste of the burrito, which made no sense since I liked the beans, I loved the tortillas, and the only other ingredient was cheese. Maybe there was some kind of sauce added in that made it taste different than expected.

The tortillas were amazing, probably the best I've had in town. I don't live nearby, but I'd travel here just for those. We also got complimentary sopaipillas, which everyone loved. Service was good and very friendly.

My only suggestion would be to invest in some plates, even if they're styrofoam or plastic, for dine in customers. Six of us eating out of takeout containers was a mess with the lids falling into each other's food.

I would also prefer they be open on weekends and maybe until 9:00 on weekdays, but they've already experimented with hours and said that business is very slow during the hours I wish they had. Oh, well, maybe in the future as they get more popular.

This isn't the place to go if you're craving that unique meal you had at a hole-in-the-wall in Puebla, but for your standard Mexican fare, Cafe Casera is fantastic with great flavors and constant freshness.",1bLbofVz5HEVZNhXJI0M_g,0,0,5,FXqH0hTwjV1lYH06u1jfCw
4868100,2014-04-16,2,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"OK... So I'm actually writing this review while waiting for my food at this place. Obviously, this is pertaining to my first visit, which was yesterday. Considering I'm here again, it's already a given that my experience at this place is very good. 

Location -  this Mexican joint is located in a strip mall right next to a gas station, hair salon, and a brand new bar. Most of the businesses in this location are brand new and starting up. The strip mall itself is located in a residential area deep in the south side of town (Jones and Robindale) 

Restaurant - it's a little hole in the wall but the place is very inviting. Very simple and the staff (which I'm assuming is the family that owns it) is very friendly. They explained the menu and introduced me to their house specials. 

Food -  their house dishes are called ""CC Sizzle"" and you get to choose what style it comes in. You can get it in either nacho, burger, burrito, taco and their own house signature, the sopaipilla. All dishes come with rice and beans. Everything is made to order. They roll the dough in front of you and prepare their tortillas on site which is pretty cool. I had the burrito style during my first visit. It comes with 2 medium size burritos which is a huge meal  on its own right. I left very satisfied and stuffed... 

Just a heads up. The place has only been open for 2 months I believe and the owner told me they're still working on the little things. With that said, their drinks are a la carte ' at the moment from a little fridge behind the counter. They have a fountain machine set up but it's not yet operational. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially if you're in the neighborhood. It's quick, fresh and food is delicious. If you're craving simple Mexican food, it's a go to spot.",A872opA-l6OeCy9x1b2QFw,3,2,4,IsqdQImgp8vb0uLZlvJTJQ

All of the staff are super friendly and helpful.

CONS:  The restaurant is very small and the staff if ill-equipped to handle spurts of business that may occur during a lunch rush.  I noticed a table's order get lost today.  I was there on my lunch break and would have had to leave without eating. Fortunately those guests were not on a time crunch like we were and we received our food in a timely manner.

Additionally, I found a small piece of plastic in my food while I was dining.  I have worked in the service industry and understand how this happened and I am not mortified that it happened, however it is another indicator of the poor management and attention to detail that needs to be happening in a successful business.

5325773,2014-01-28,5,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"okay, i have to admit, i'm kind of an asshole...

when i walked into cafe caserá to pick up the food i'd ordered online, i was told that they did not have several things i had ordered (the green chili mashed potatoes & the sugar cookies). they offered to replace these items with an order of chips & salsa and an order of sopapillas instead. truth be told i'd been somewhat torn about which sides/dessets to try anyway, so i accepted the substitutions without complaint. i *was* a little unimpressed that they were out of multiple menu items (i really wanted to try those taters, man!) so i considered writing a review to warn people that this joint is still a little rough around the edges, but since the couple preparing my order were so incredibly sweet  and apologetic i told myself to just chill out, be a big girl, and graciously accept whatever they gave me...

i noticed the busted soda fountain against the wall, the quiet hum of the empty restaurant located in a sketchy half-empty shopping plaza. i nearly missed the storefront entirely and drove right past because there were no illuminated signs out front. the decor inside was simple, rustic, unassuming. a handwritten sign next to the register suggested calling ahead to order Superbowl party platters. i chuckled to myself that whoever was ordering a Superbowl party's worth of food from this place was probably taking a pretty big gamble, as i gladly would've taken the under on these guys sticking around til then....

but like i said, i'm an asshole.

anyway, i got home and was immediately forced to eat all of my words because once i tasted my food (and dear god was there a LOT of it for the $15 i spent) i realized i'd stumbled into some *seriously* delicious mom n' pop-style comfort food. every single item tasted fresh and amazing: the house-made seasoned tortilla chips, the INSANE salsa roja, the combo burrito, the sopapillas...everything was friggin' incredible. 

just goes to show that you can't always judge a book by its cover. this place may not be much of a looker but at its core it's good people makin good food and that's what's important. thumbs way up. :)",wmtixWKF6Ou87YXtjuYv-w,7,5,4,luU3TBpGcSd2iGUsjvNTGA

5436931,2014-04-19,1,6JTxM3pZAaiauddFu88VpA,"Today was our first time at Cafe Casera and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. I think there's a lot of potential, but there are a few things to iron out.

We really like supporting mom & pop type restaurants and have been to Albuquerque on many occasions, so we're very familiar with New Mexican cuisine.

We started off with chips & salsa, which had good flavor, but was a bit on the mild side for us. $3.25 for chips & salsa is a bit on the steep side as well considering the vast majority of restaurants offer them complimentary.

We had the CC Sizzle sopapilla which was a little disappointing. The sopapilla was very dense and a lot more like Navajo fry bread than a light, fluffy and airy pillow of love that we've come to expect from a good sopapilla. Also, I was expecting a stuffed sopapilla, rather than it being folded taco style, with very little meat.

The CC Sizzle meat was quite good and we really liked the flavors. However, for $8 I think it was really lacking in the quantity department and was pretty skinny for my liking. Look at my pictures, there is a little bit of meat below all that cabbage. We had them add Hatch green chiles, add $1, and would've liked a few more of those as well. The rice & beans were pretty standard fair.

Worth going to? Yes, but I definitely think there is some room for improvement.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,3,2,3,p5Bl0EYQhXgyQBz6JSxg0w
