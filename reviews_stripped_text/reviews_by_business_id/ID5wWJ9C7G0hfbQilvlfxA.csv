I was in Las Vegas with my girlfriends, and we stumbled upon this restaurant while walking around downtown.  We sat at the bar. The owner was working that night, and kept us laughing.  The waitresses were cute, the service attentive, and the food was delicious!   The organic greens salad had a flavorful homemade dressing, the sea bass in tomato sauce was delicious.

The decor reminds us of an old mexican fishing restaurant, with nice details as to the paintings on the tables and group seating. The music was good selection, a tad loud.

The waitress, Tanya, was very helpful in helping us navigate the menu, the Tamarindo Margarita was perfect, not too sweet and refreshing, the Pescado a la Plancha, was moist and the Veracruz salsa with it, balanced and  good combination of flavors. We will be back with friends.",vzsusM_TgeXkfSaTIvuJpA,0,0,5,AC4gxYU5b4EnZ2lPLblrQQ
27963,2013-07-19,0,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"The only reason this place gets two stars is the service and somewhat decent food. Location is in the ""revitalization"" part of downtown Las Vegas so it's loud, sketchy and when we saw police cars patrolling the block multiple times, we should have taken the clue and left. I'm writing this review to encourage management and guests to NOT patronize the valet service, which was being managed by ABC Valet, when we went a little over a month ago. They returned my car, and when I pointed out that my hood emblem had been pried off, the valets immediately threw up their hands to say ""not my fault"". Their policy says you can file a claim with their management but ONLY IF YOU STAY ON SITE TO DO SO. We ended up waiting over an hour for them to find claim forms, get their manager on the phone, and were treated like we were the criminals for trying to pull something over on them. If one of them had just nicely said, we're really sorry but you know emblems are only $30 or so to replace, I would have been ok. The La Comida manager was great about sending his apologies and offering us drinks, but honestly, I hope he understands that his valet service takes away from his restaurant's overall experience to guests.",0pmjosqsUtmW1zVS2W7utQ,0,0,2,kTw-yMSuuX5OYdtsy07vsA

The server we had was really nice and attentive, and when I asked for my second margarita to have less ice, she and the bartender were very accommodating.  Overall, the food was very good, but it could use a little kick in the spicy department.  The shrimp enchilada was excellent, and so were the carnitas tacos.  The fajitas were served with lots of veggies but not enough tortillas or pico de gallo, and they charge you for more tortillas.  The menu is simple, though somewhat limited, but the bar was well-stocked and the cocktail menu was even longer than the food menu.",kmC8nIGdQeLUOBCgRDzS8g,0,0,3,OMwjseIisvY7SiTdwGMlIg

We were not greeted and as we waited. Someone from our party sat at the bar that was, and was basically scornfully asked to get off the seat. Its understandable(they were under drinking age), but they could have handled it better, I mean the place was dead no need to have a fit. 
We ordered a few beers and beverages while we decided on some small things to nibble on. HE seemed really annoyed that we didnt order any food at first. ANd seemed really bothered evertime he came over. 
We orderd guacamole for the chips at the table, it was amazing, and a tostada. It was decent but the meat seemd reheated and dry.

We live in Seattle and have several excellent modern (non-american) mexican restuarants. This place would fit right in our city.

decor was distressed/modern with a hip vibe.

we shared a huge pork sandwich and got an egg with it, as our server sugessted. unfortunately the egg was a bit overcooked. the sandwich still tasted excellent, but could have been even better with a runny yoked egg. the potato chips were great and made on site.

free chips and salsa. excellent quality.

price was about what we paid in Seattle. beer $6, margarita $15 & $18 (for high end tequilla).

124319,2013-05-15,1,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"La Comida is located in the El Cortez' old laundry facility space on 6th Street, just around the corner from a majority of the foot traffic in the area, so those that don't know of its presence may miss it altogether. But if you happen to venture around the corner, you'll quickly see their funky neon skeleton monkey sign hanging from the top of the parapet. There's a small patio outside with a handful of tables, a rustic bar with maybe 14 seats, and a number of different sized tables offering the combination of various dining groups. The space is open to the wood framed roof above, with lots of reclaimed wood decorative items, stained glass, and a huge tequila selection behind the bar. It's a pretty cool interior, and definitely fits with the theme of the menu. And speaking of the menu, it doesn't seem to be available anywhere online yet but features some great sounding items like mesquite-smoked pork shoulder with avocado sauce and plantain chips, beef skirt steak with wild mushroom and oven-roasted poblano peppers, tacos and plenty more. There is also quite the list of specialty margaritas to work your way through.

As usual I'm here for one thing; in this case it is called the Hamburguesa Mexicana and comes with ancho chiles, avocado, Oaxaca cheese and sweet potato fries. Upon first bite I instantly noticed how fantastic the bun was, and it instantly made me think of Bachi's. Could it be the same supplier? The next thing I noticed was the great chorizo flavor mixed in with the ancho chiles that I wasn't expecting based on the description, but it was a very welcome surprise. The patty meat had good flavor, but I question its quality based on your only two options for cooking temperature: medium or well. Without hesitation I went with medium, but it was cooked a bit beyond that in this case. Still, it wasn't too dry, and the combination of guac, chorizo and ancho chiles made for some really great flavors. The Oaxaca cheese was flavorful, melted well and even had some nice brown to it from the cooking temps. Overall this burger was a surprising success.

The sweet potato fries were also great; sweet and cooked very well. They came out seasoned with just a bit of salt and were a nice companion to the flavors of the burger. At $14 I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper, but if you compare it to another burger in close proximity that wasn't nearly as good at $12, this isn't so bad. I think the prices of everything on the menu are a few dollars too high and portions a bit small, as I've been back a couple more times to try some of their other signature dishes. The food is really good, although they should look into alternates for their soft taco shells as theirs have fallen apart on me a bit too easily on both visits. Either way this is a really fun restaurant, and a great addition to the East Fremont area. The entire staff is very attentive and has treated us well every time we've gone in there so far; definitely check this place out if you're in the area looking for a good burger, good Mexican meal or just a fun scene.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,2,4,f9559_4OIl-k3kLJhZEbaQ

I think La Comida has one of the best michiladas I've ever had!
I had one each of the fish tacos, which came with rice and beans; they were both ridiculously good ($13).  My husband had the queso, which he said was just okay.  Our friends ordered an enchilada (with fantastic reviews), two people ordered the pork shoulder (with fantastic reviews).

211919,2013-05-18,3,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"I really wanted to like this place and the new breed of downtown restaurants like EAT and  Le Thai had me feeling sure that I would.  I liked the look of the place and the idea of resurrecting the the old El Cortez laundry space.  Unfortunately after eating at La Comida I feel like this place was born of a corporate calculation to take quick advantage of the good feelings created by the other more thoughtful efforts to bring good food to downtown.  Our experience wasn't all bad.  The staff was friendly, helpful and were doing their best.  The food, however, was very disappointing.  As several previous posters have mentioned the prices were high but the real problem is what you get for your hard earned money.  I don't mind paying the price for good ingredients and skillful preparations but this food was mediocre at best.  The shrimp ceviche was rubbery and dry, the pork shoulder was tough and lacked flavor, and the Mole was too sweet and covered dry bland chicken enchiladas.   There is also something cynical about places that work hard to give off a cool hole in the wall vibe but charge top dollar.  My rear still hurts from sitting in a recovered folding metal chair and I don't find cheap paper napkins charming when wiping my $7 dollar salsa off my fingers.  Yes the salsa trio was $7 and  surprisingly bland.  Although the restaurant was half full they kept seating the two top that was pretty much touching our table in that always uncomfortable attempt to foster the communal experience that I guess they hope will distract from the food.

I may be a sucker but I am still hopeful that the owners of this place can experience it as their customers do and realize changes must be made.  I really do want to like it.",Rdqn24QoxtkOQKNqRyyY8Q,6,5,2,FrZua2sv2sffDpvSyg0eHw

238193,2014-07-23,0,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"The best way I can describe this place is hip, trendy, and overpriced. I've had lunch here several times. I won't come back again unless the boss is paying; that's a fact. The only parking is public, and you have to pay, so bring your quarters! Let's just break today's experience down step by step:

- Decor. The dining and bar are in one big room with very artsy decor and clever furnishings. The music is a bit loud for business lunches, but adds to the artsy entertainment factor. One of the main attractions used to be the very fit and attractive female bartenders and hostess. It appears they were off today. 

- Service. Standard. Nothing above par. I had to ask for a water refill. 

- Chips and Salsa. One more day, and the store-bought chips will be stale. The salsa was thick and smoky, if you're into that, and I swear they put molasses in it. Not a fan. I like good ol' fashioned salsa picante!

- Passionfruit Margarita. Great flavor, one of many. It was $10. A couple of pitfalls, though. It seemed like a small serving (small mason jar), couldn't taste the alcohol. Also, they fill the glass half full with ice. I get that it's Las Vegas, but c'mon. That is not standard procedure for blended margaritas, muchachos.

- Shrimp Ceviche. This was $12. The shrimp tasted fresh and the side of plantain chips was nice, but again, I felt the portion was small and something was off about the sauce. It tasted too watery and sweet. Needed more cilantro, lemon, and salt.

- Grilled Fish Tacos. This was the highlight of the meal. The yellow tortillas for the street tacos were the perfect consistency, and the fish was very moist and good. With a nice relish garnish. 

- Beans and Rice. Came with the fish tacos. Nothing to brag about. Just standard flavors. Beans were a little bland and the rice a little dry.

That's it. All in with tip and tax, I paid $42 for just lil ol' me. I think if they had lower prices, I wouldn't have an issue about recommending this place. It really is a nice hangout downtown and seems like it has great potential for nightlife, but not on my dime.",pOI8k1l3PsAqbKhdiqZ9pg,4,2,3,0tULznZ3w_8rXp951gfLeA

Listen, Vegas..I love you, I live in you, you are  my soulmate, you make me great food, you're cheap, you're hot, and you're pretty.....That being said, STOP trying to change into something you're not!!

I get it.. Downtown is cleaning up, getting trendy..I am all on board with it.. I am even embracing the hipsters , or are they still the regular DT homeless?  I can't tell, they both dress in ripped clothing and don't shower.. 

I have even grown to love Commonwealth and their over priced drinks made by *cringe* mixologists.. I'm trying, but I usually just hangout at The Griffin or Insert Coins until the terrible DJs show up. 

but La Comida, has no excuse to be pretentious and grossly over priced. It is a Mexican Restaurant off Fremont.   It's great to makeover downtown to a cool artsy, hip town..but does that mean I have to pay $10 for a beer and a million dollars for tasteless ceviche?  My friends and I went here for the restaurants first brunch,  they ordered what was a sad attempt at a breakfast burrito, which looked suspiciously like the ones from McDonalds, and I had some dry tasteless French Toast that cost me $15..  Sighhh..  

I will stick to one of the other dozen AUTHENTIC Downtown Mexican restaurants.. I will gladly substitute the trendy atmosphere and crappy over priced food for a hole in the wall, cheap delicious experience.

The food is mouthwatering!  I highly recommend the ceviche, and the tacos are great.  Sure, you could go down the street and find a taco stand with good tacos for less, but the ingredients won't be as fresh and high quality as La Comida.  You certainly get what you pay for.  While the food is delicious, the drinks are even better!  The Prickly Pear Margarita is by far the best margarita I have ever had.  Not too sweet, no tangy sour mix flavor... You can tell that it is a quality margarita.  The sangria is also superb.  Definitely give those two a try when you go. Finally, La Comida's ambiance is fun, clean and casual.  It is the perfect place to start your night downtown, or just grab drinks after work.  You should check this place out.",NY_W-0-x4ZEOPlq4-W1tsg,0,0,5,I7m8ExLaoJhXFkbjb1aHdQ

And the food. Puta madre. La comida was beyond bad. It is actually MEAN to serve food this dull and charge this much for it. The carnita tacos were dry, flavorless, and lazy.

I ordered the cameron al maya -fried shrimp taco with mango and habanero salsa.

Still holding strong though and not sick so that's a good sign! The shrimp were pretty small. The tacos had a kick to them with the habanero salsa.  They came with beans and rice but it was sent over on a small plate to be ""family style"" with my friend - the ""family style"" portion is about the size each person would get on their own plate in a normal sit down mexican restaurant.  You received three tacos with any of the taco plates. It was $12, and the tacos were equivalent to a standard street taco as to size. I think they price was a bit expensive for what you get. The drinks sounded good, but I did not imbibe. Overall cute place, decent food, a bit pricey for what you get, nothing memorable as to the flavor profile. Also, I asked the waitress what she recommended she immediately steered me to the most expensive item on the menu ($22) - I am always skeptical when this happens but maybe she gets to eat for free and that just happens to be her favorite, she recommended a few other of the higher priced items too.

I told him tomorrow he would have that opportunity. the next evening we were back, greeted by a very friendly hostess and Rafael, who asked if we like pork and chicken.

The blood orange margaritas were amazing.

The salsa had great flavor with just the right level of spice.  We also got the guacamole.  It was obvious it was freshly made. Quite yummy.

The whole menu looked great so we asked our waiter, Frank, what he recommended. He asked if we were looking for a full meal or something a bit smaller.  We said we wanted something smaller and he recommended sharing the Puerco Ahumado.  It did not disappoint. The pork shoulder came in a smokey red sauce with two plantain chips as garnish. In this way I think the menu was a bit deceptive since you could infer the plantain chips were an integral part of the entre' (maybe for dipping); they were merely garnish.  That didn't matter to us though.  The pork shoulder was served with warm tortillas (clearly made fresh).  The pork fell off the fork it was so tender and the flavor was amazing!

The service was quick and attentive.  We appreciated Frank asking what type of meal we were looking for so we didn't get too much or too little.

The decor was authentic with a Catholic bend.  They have a wall of rosaries.

This restaurant, I don't know honestly. It didn't meet my expectations. I was actually expecting more and it was a disappointment. First, my date and I ordered the Albondigas and the waiter wasn't paying attention and spilled the sauce on the table (annoying). It got on my shoes and my dates wallet and phone. 

My date ordered this chicken dish that had chipotle sauce and it came in a nice presentation. After he had a taste, he asked me to try it and ask if it was suppose to taste like that. The taste of the dish was so flavorless. Think of it as the sauce and the chicken having no flavor. The chicken was over cooked and dry. 

We did ask the manager to try something different because we were dissatisfied and he recommended a pork dish that had plantain chips. He brought us samples of the pork to taste and it was very good.

I ordered some street tacos Al Pastor and they were okay. It didn't make me want to have more after the first taco (3 come with the order).  

I would say the service was great. They did go above and beyond to ensure we were happy. The food in the other hand was a 4 from a scale  from 1-10 (10 being amazing).

This quaint cantina serves up elevated Mexican cuisine from all over the map. Think, Mundo with less fuss and more character. 

Walking down the narrow entry, I felt like I was whisked off to Play del Carmen or some other Mexican coastal town. Suddenly, Fremont Street was a distant memory. I was taken with the striking bar that serves up more than 100 tequilas and an extensive list of margaritas made with fresh fruit puree. I was unable to resist the prickly pear ($9). 

While seated I loved how sunlight filled the space from the patio doors being perched open, and I enjoyed the warm breeze wafting in. It was a pleasant way to enjoy my refreshing prickly pear margarita served on the rocks; the perfect blend of sweet and tart. It was a great choice to wash down the house chips and salsa. The salsa had a smoky flavor with a slight hint of heat. 

Next, came the carnitas ($11). Three tacos topped with pickled onions and cilantro, served with a side of rice and beans. The carnitas were flavorful and tender. I had no complaints. Everything was tasty and well executed.

The food was delicious and best of all it tasted authentic Mexican food. And to put the icing on the cake, Chef Mario Garcia came out and introduce himself and asked how was the food. He started to talk to us like a friend. You can tell he loves what he does and he wants to make sure everyone knows. We talked to the Chef for quite a bit and to add more wonderfulness he had one of the Cook's prepared us a delicious Flan . It was to die for. The flan was very creamy, rich and delicious. Now that's what you call exceptional, excellent customer service. Restaurants of Las Vegas you could learn from Chef Mario.

During Happy hour theres no food items available for the happy hour price and the food and drink prices aren't worth ordering anything unless it's happy hour,what poor marketing! The manager seems uptight an had no personality which may have been due to the fact the place was basically like a ghost town. The bartender seems friendly but beware his job is to hustle you with their extremely pricey guacamole. I believe it was $8 which was more then the drink at happy hour. The salsa was a joke and since your forced to eat tortillas due to their pricey menu at happy hour guacamole sounds better then what it taste.

Apparently any more than two people in a group and the waiters don't know what to do with themselves. The food was extremely over priced for the small portions that you get and I've tasted better meals at Taco Bell then what they were serving. All the food was either over cooked or under cooked. My wife got the fajitas and it ended up making her sick, and when we told the waiter and tried to send it back we got the biggest attitude from him and the staff. Never one apology. Also make sure you know exactly what you order in a group because they refuse to split bills, and will give you an attitude of inconvenience if you ask. Also make sure you stay away from the guy with the ridiculous mustache. If you decide to rock an idiotic mustache on your face that you normally don't see every day then you'd expect to get some comments, however if you tell this waiter ""hey cool mustache!""

The chips and salsa are complimentary. They serve a red salsa that was flavorful and had a little bit of heat.  Pretty good.

The burrito was mediocre. It was smothered in green sauce that was pretty good but the inside looked and tasted like I was at Chipotle.  It needed more flavor. 

The steak fajitas were delicious. The meat was tender and cooked just right. They were served with corn tortillas.

The corn was absolutely amazing. It was cooked perfectly and had a little bit of crunch and not too mushy. The flavors blended well with the butter, lime, and cheese.

Our waiter was hilarious and engaging and the food was very timely. I chose the breaded shrimp tacos (Camaron Al Maya) and didn't regret it.

Above & beyond awesome service dude!

He knew the drinks & menu, made recommendations after getting a feel for what we were in the mood for.  They have a creative mouthwatering Margarita list & everything looks good on it so after my fav the 'Verasco de Jalisco,' he asked if I felt like refreshing or smokey.  The Verasco de Jalisco is refreshing to me so the smokey w/ a tangy tamarind sounded unique & tasty.  I wish it was on the menu cause it was delicious.  

We read some reviews of La Comida & decided to try the Chicken Mole.  Wow.  Love the mole & shredded chicken.  I need to ask for extra mole next time cause the chocolate was right on point.  Once I had the Taquitos which were not good, but my friend got the Chicken Enchiladas & they were very good.  I was coming back for them or their most popular dish w/ the pork.  Left this time very satisfied & craving the Mole.

The Mexican theme, as soon as you walk in a short corridor on the left, is funky, spooky & Mexican eclectic  such as a wall of rosary's, plastic flowers, graffiti, bar swing, outdoor hanging lights, variety of chairs & china plates w/ that ol' grandma style.  Very cool.  I also love how the front opens to the outside.  The booths are also very comfortable & there's a chalkboard w/ future events coming up such as a Tequila Dinner on the 28th. 

Frank was right there w/ our check & did it all so fast cause our meter was almost up!  Next time, we'll stay for at least 2 hours, cause one hour is only enough to eat, enjoy one drink & gulp the other.  

I have been here three times now, once they were closed so I was really disappointed & we found a parking right in front that day.  Consistent after the two visits w/ fast service, great atmosphere & excellent margaritas.  

Note to self:  
Closed on Mondays.
No beans or rice cause I never eat them & am too full.
Never order taquitos, no where gets 'em right.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,15,11,5,dTbDdbCCbS81frmWFV48HQ

To start we had the tortilla soup and some guacamole and both were decent. We ordered enchiladas de camaron, they were good with plenty of shrimp filling and cheese, it comes with two enchiladas and rice and beans to share. Also ordered the pollo al horno which it was very flavorful and juicy, it came wrapped on banana leaves and in a paper bag. Authentic? Who knows, it all depends from what area of Mexicos food you're accustomed to, all I was hoping for is some good food and I was not disappointed.
Service was great. We were greeted by almost everyone in the building, we were served in a timely manner and glasses (mason jars) refilled constantly, no problems there.
I love what they did with the place. Modern industrial look with exposed ducts and brick and imported Mexican tile. The cool bar with some gothic touches and saints, giving it a feel of a religious altar where I could just pray all night to the agave gods.
 I do have a little problem with the rest rooms. Saloon swinging doors don't really work in bathrooms, I really believe that bathrooms doors should completely seal all bathroom activities from the rest of the restaurant, and also using Jesus and the Virgin Mary as marking signs for men and women is going to far, a bit insulting.
 Prices are a little high, but the experience is worth it, I doubt I'll be a regular since this place is far from where I live and parking is not abundant but if I find myself in downtown again I'll make sure to stop by and try other items on the menu. I hope by then I find Jesus in the dining room or by the spirits. I pray to that.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,4,4,4,D23rnWxQgsbxUMRlDWngqw

It was pretty slow for a Tuesday night so we were greeted & seated right away. Our Server Frank came right over and got the process going with chips & salsa and water in the cool little mason jars that everyone seems to be doing these days. He answered questions, explained the menu, etc.

I ordered whatever Server Frank suggested and he didn't disappoint. Like mojitos & margaritas? Then get the Verano de Jalisco it was THE best drink I had during my whole time in Vegas. I'm not a salt girl, but I couldn't get enough of the salt/Mexican spice mixture on the rim of the glass.

Start out with ceviche Frank said. Absolutely. The shrimp were juicy and plump and the plantains added just the right amount of sweetness.

Get the shrimp tacos (Camaron al maya) Frank told me. Done and done. Once again the shrimp were plump and filled the tortilla, there was the perfect amount of cabbage and queso fresco to make it taste just right.

My friend got the shrimp enchiladas and besides sharing the chips, salsa & ceviche we didn't offer each other to try our dishes because they were that good we didn't want to give them up.

The only thing I turned Frank down on was dessert. I didn't want to press my luck and have dessert disappoint, though I'm sure it wouldn't. Or maybe I just didn't want to get rid of that Verano drink taste that I polished off my meal with. 

Try this place out! Really have no complaints. I do agree with people who say its pricey. My 2 shrimp tacos were $13 but I was on vacation and it was Vegas so I felt ok to splurge!",PwNTJJhmw-nHz0TCb011qA,3,1,5,UfBbWYxLJvpPRnLwloDgCA
1350122,2013-09-11,0,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"It is funny that most of the knocks against this joint are the price, with something like ""...for Mexican food..."" accompanying the gripe. Yes, there is dirt cheap Mexican food out there - some of it is even decent. But if you are getting an elevated experience with high quality ingredients, then expect a higher price. Hell, Italian food is largely based in pasta and sauce, yet they can charge whatever they want and there is little fuss over the price. With that said, does La Comida's food (MEXICAN even!) deserve a (slightly) higher price tag. Well... maybe. The decor and atmosphere are superb, there is no doubt about that. It sports a retro-chic (to pair two horribly over-used words together) look, and it is done with much love and care. The space is nice and open, and it seamlessly flows right into the street. As for the food - that is a bit difficult to judge from my one experience. My date and I stopped here for something light - only splitting an app and an entree. Oh yeah, and there were some chips and salsa going on, which were fresh and tasty. The app was a shrimp ceviche that was overly limey. The entree was the Camaron del Golfo - a dish with large shrimp, veggies, and sauce. It was solid and light, but seemed to be missing something. If nothing else, I plan on visiting Comida again for its cool, casual vibe. Hopefully, it will be with more people, so I can get more of the flavors going on here.",JqfQCJlKeiALcL3v0bYjAw,0,0,3,McfGR7sBKOldtEvZSj9NhA

We came in got sat rite away host was kind. Busser brought us water and chips and salsa didn't say much but could tell he did his job well he also prebussed the table for us. Are server came got our drinks I asked for recommendations he gave a few me and my wife went for two of the four he offered. Food runner brought our food said he would be back with the tortillas I ordered and was told they were extra by the server and then told they came with the meal by the runner.. The food was not bad but not rememberable you know that food that you say im comeing back for this tortillas are out of a bag just nothing special to me maybe it just wasn't authentic enough for me my opinion yours may be different. I asked next what they had for dessert and me and my wife decided on the trece leches cake that was a good moist piece of cake like it should be. Now for the bill well I understand confusion and this may have been the case we we're charged for the tortillas that we were told we were going to be charged for and thats fine however after I was told they came with the meal by the runner I asked the server he said oh I forgot that meal does come with them. Ok perfect he fixed the bill and this is why you get four stars because no matter how many times you fix the issue there are other times where you just simply dont get caught doing things like this and thats unsettling as a patron hopefully I get the opportunity to give this spot a second chance and feel better about what happened any how good luck,guDQoyNiyn3JEi49J59d8A,0,0,4,ODIRO_Xcz0aMbjV_WsJeGw

Love La Comida. I rarely eat twice at the same place but during this short three-day trip, I had to hit this one twice. 

The food is excellent. I went with something called the Torta Grande, with egg added. This is a HUGE sandwich and, although I have a large appetite, could not finish it all. Took half out in a to go bag and gave it to a guy on the street. 

The Torta Grande was outstanding, as were the chips & salsa that came with it. Went back for the Pozole and it was outstanding as well. 

There is a lot of indoor and some outdoor seating, as well as a spacious bar. Staff is awesome. Professional and helpful if, like me, you're having trouble deciding what to get.

Jelly Jars, the Kim Kardashian sort of popular official gentrification bar glassware and lunchroom like seating...heavy sigh!

My second thought, RUFKM!!!  If I'm going to order a $19 margarita I want gold flecked tequila slowly dribbled into my mouth by a libation slave.  I was pretty convinced that that was not going to happen, since I couldn't even get a glass of water, so I insulted my palate with a Boone's Farmish tasting sangria that had a few slices of orange floating in it like a dead goldfish.

My third thought, WTF!!!   I could have gotten a better meal at a Del Taco drive thru without the maybe I should refinance my house prices!!!  

Pollo al Horno - dry and bland 
Chicken Burrito - dry with a undefinable overabundance of a spice that made it close to inedible
2 Chicken Enchiladas with Mole - more dry chicken, the mole sauce tasted like a cinnamon paste, dreadful!
Communal rice & beans - Meh

We were ironically glad about the kid sized portions, because all our meals ranged from poor to fair at best.

I was excited to try this place and meet a friend for food and drinks here. Bottom line is ""I've had better."" - I've definitely had better Mexican food and better drinks, BUT this is a fun place downtown to hang out and grab some food, (I've yet to try Le Thai).  The outdoor seating and on a nice day with a couple of beverages, is definitely worth it. 

I got the Shrimp Salad with large shrimp, mandarin oranges, some walnuts, and a sweet dressing. I really liked this salad when paired with my Prickly Pear cocktail. 

My friend got the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. It wasn't spicy but lacked flavor and spices that I know that chicken enchiladas usually have. The sides were rice and beans. 

The service- I think they are still working out the kinks, our server brought us a copy of our receipt with no place to sign or tip..? We had to get this matter resolved with the hostesses up front.

If I was downtown hanging out and bar hopping, would I hop over to La Comida? Probably not. 

Would I come here for Mexican food? Most likely not. There are better places in the valley for Mexican food.

It was dinner time, but we came specifically for margaritas. There was some chips and salsa brought out to us that were whatever. The chips were not very crispy and overly thick. The salsa was more chile based and thick like marinara, which in theory is ok but this missed the mark. There is really great selection of margaritas made with fresh juices. We ordered the blood orange, guava and passion fruit. The guava was my favorite. It didn't pack a huge punch, which for me means they were being stingy with the tequila. They were mostly sweet except for the passion fruit which was actually overly sour for my taste. If I wanted fresh juice they would have been fine. 

Over all you are paying for the downtown experience and the trendy little neighborhood they are nestled into. I would come back here and remind them to kick it up a little with the tequila.

We were greeted by John, the bartender after sitting for a few minutes, I can only assume that was his name as this is the name that appeared on my receipt. 

I will say John was extremely attentive to a group to my left and a group to my right, but somehow we were missed. The couple to my left were complaining about something because not only did the chef come out to speak with them but the manager as well. I guess that might be what it takes to get service in this place. Another thing I didnt like is that John was drinking ont he job, he had a shot of something with the group of men to my right. BAD!!!

As for the decor the lighting was bad, I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. The menus lacked description of how the item is prepared but did list all the ingredients. The feel of the place was very casual and relaxed. Although VERY loud, your typically Mexican home during dinner time. 

The food was different than anything I have experienced. Not your typical Mexican food. I would not even call it Mexican, more like a mexi-fusion of some sort. 

The chips and salsa were were given, were heavenly. The chips were light, not too oily but not too thin that they crumble while dipping. The salsa was a blend of roasted tomatoes and green chili. Not too spicy but could have used a little salt, Overall very good. 

My husband had a shrimp dish that he was over the moon about, the shrimp was cooked to perfection and sat atop a bed of sausage, potato and other veggies. 

I ordered the pollo de horno, as the menu did not give a detailed description I was not sure what I was getting other than chicken. when it arrived, I have to say, I was taken aback by the presentation, it was served in a paper package, wrapped with banana leaves. The chicken was 2 pieces, a leg and a thigh, in a  poblano sauce with squash and onion, The chicken was so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering as i write this review. 

The down side to the meal was that the sides are served family style. The small, and I do me small platter of rice and beans was not enough for 2 people, I seriously thought a 2nd platter would be brought since we ordered 2 entrees. the rice had great texture and flavor. I would say almost as good as my own. The beans were tasty too and I am quite picky with my bean, If they are not my Tia Jenny's forget it. These were pretty good, Sorry Tia. 

I might try this place again, maybe sit at a table and not the bar. this place is rather small and the lay out looked like it catered to larger crowds, so I thought sitting at the bar would be easier and they could serve more customers.

Unfortunately we didn't have time to eat more than just chips and salsa, which by the way may have been the best chips and salsa I've ever eaten. A group of 6 of us wandered in looking for a quick drink. Everyone at the bar was very nice and the drinks came fast. Oh, and there's a swing! Like right at the bar! So fun and creative, but not in the cheesy seedy way that many of the Vegas bars are. You will not find flashy foot long glasses and servers in bikinis here!! We were so impressed with the service and the style of the place that my husband and I stopped in again 2 nights later, and to my surprise the whole staff remembered and welcomed us back like family! The margaritas were Delicious. One of the friendliest places we visited in Vegas.

1605718,2013-07-06,4,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"In the interest of fairness, this review is for the visit I had along with some work partners during lunch approximately a week after LC first opened.  Maybe things have changed...I don't know.

Without reading the reviews and looking at the star factor, I committed to taking my partners out to luck on this particular visit.  This decision was solidified after talking to another buddy who states he was the first paying customer (at a discount) and said the chow was decent.

First, beware of the parking.  Meters are all around and make sure you have plenty of quarters because you during lunch you never know how long it might take to get your meal. LC was heated up during lunch time.  One of my partners said he would take care of the parking situation and little did he know just how much a task it would be.  It was quite the challenge to find change for anyone in LC during the start of lunch.  Not even the bar had change!  I will say this, it was pretty damn cool when the bartender reached into his own pocket and gave my partner seventy-five cents of his own money to assist with parking after not being able to break a twenty.

Our waiter was very nice as I think most everyone else was.. except the hostesses.  

The menu looked awesome but it was configured at ""foodie"" prices.  Hoping the sizes of the chips, salsa, apps, and meals would make the pain of paying so much bearable, I was sadly mistaken.

The app was a queso dip with it's size being only large enough to satisfy a smaller person let alone three guerrillas.  The Sea Bass Tacos I ordered, though tasty were the size of those one would get from a taco street vendor in TJ.  Only those on the other side of the border were like five for a dollar.

Between the quarter/parking fiasco and the absolute ""foodie"" portions at ""foodie"" prices one might expect this type of meal further south of the strip, say past Sahara where the tourists are.

$70 dollar meal (lunch) with no booze just plain sucks.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,2,2,Tot7Q7AwUvYZrT-A-vD1Wg

My friends and I just came here for some margaritas and some snacks and to just really talk and hang out.

I had gotten the blood orange margarita and my friends got the prickly pear margarita. 

Totally worth it.

My margarita wasn't as blood orange-y as I would've liked, but it was still fruity and full of tequila. The prickly pear margaritas were great! They were sweet and very refreshing. 

Other than that, we just got chips and salsa and queso fundido. Chips were seasoned well and the salsa had just enough heat. The queso fundido was hot and the chorizo gave it a nice heat.

That said, the bartender could afford to lose the attitude. I ordered my first marg on the rocks and she made a point to tell me with a bit of a sneer that ALL the margaritas are served on the rocks. Presumably, blenders are just too bourgeois. Then, when my friend joined us, he ordered a blood-orange marg and a passion fruit one. When the same bartender set them down, he asked which was which. She sneered again and said, ""The orange one is the blood orange one. D'uh."" My friend apologized for HIS COLOR BLINDNESS.

Sat down and was greeted by a pretty girl in a cute outfit who really knows her way around a bar. Inquired about all the tasty margaritas and she explained which was tart, which was sweet, mellow, etc. Super helpful stuff there. Also threw some chips and salsa in front of me that alerted the tasted buds that delicious stuff was on the way. Thanks for the heads up, sexy, salty chips!

I ended up with two different margaritas. The first was a passion fruit margarita, which was fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing like the next one I had. Whew. Was talking to Michelle, I think that was her name, and she recommended I try the verano de jalisco. I am a huge fan of cilantro and added to this drink it made it fresh and delicious. The unusual salt (can't remember the name) around the rim just made it all the better. Do these!

I then had a side of elotes asados and it was sooooo freaking good. The plate was piled so high I couldn't eat it all. I should have eaten it all because now I want some and I realized how much I wasted. Regret.

Nice to be able to sit outside, but the music is too loud and it's difficult to have a conversation. It's not out of the ordinary for downtown Las Vegas, but it ruins it for me, especially for brunch/lunch. Without the loud music I'd give it a 4.

Value: 3/5
Kinda pricey for normal Mexican food 

Service: 4/5

Server right away got an attitude and said ""have you ever had mole?"" Yes good authentic mole that has flavor. He suggested replacing it with their shrimp enchiladas, ok why not.

I ordered the fish tacos and my friend ordered the pork shoulder. The fish tacos were good, but it didn't stand out as being particularly memorable.

The servers were pretty friendly.

La Comida is the quintessential tourist trap that's ironically located in a not-so-touristy, local hot spot area of downtown Vegas.

I had been dying to try this place, even after reading all of the crappy reviews, because I'm optimistic and I'm not overly critical of new restaurants. I know what it's like to be on the other side, have an ""off"" day, etc. 

I don't want to get into all of the things that are wrong with La Comida because other Yelpers have done a good job of summing it up. My experience can be pinned down to the same experience everyone else seems to have - extremely small servings, high prices, watered down drinks and lack of flavor.

I love Mexican food. LOVE. And it's really hard to disappoint me. I've had great meals and average meals at so many different Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  So, I am not expecting 5 star quality food or the best meal of my life.  But, I am expecting decent flavor - especially if I'm paying $15 for two tiny tacos and the smallest plate of rice and beans brought to a table of 4 to SHARE. 

La Comida has a lot of potential - if management would pay attention to the reviews and make some changes in the kitchen -  I think it could be very successful.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,4,1,2,apVdmcD8gd-1-aMXpdFSLg

This place is located on Fremont Street right next to Common Wealth. The inside is nice and very old school. Kinda like day of the dead. There is also a swing located by the bar. Which I didn't see anybody ride. LOL 

We started our dinner with a passion fruit margarita, which was actually really yummy and I just had me a regular modelo beer.I ordered the ceviche which came with plantain chips, I thought it was kind of different. I preferred the ceviche with the tortilla chips that they served when you get there. I also thought it would be a big portion of ceviche but obviously with my picture it wasn't. But enough to get me full. My partner ordered the nachos, served with steak, cheese, guacamole, and jalapenos. They also served the nachos not with tortilla chips. Im not sure what kind of chips they were but they were thick. The nachos were OK. Wasn't a really big fan and the portion was OK as well. I know that when I go to a Mexican restaurant they always serve a big portion of their food. We ended our dinner with the tres leches cake which was really yummy and I guess you could say I would order that cake again.

Im not sure if I would come back to this restaurant, but if I do I think I would have to be really drunk. 

Ohh and their servers, they talk to each other too much. I shouldn't have to yell for them to fill both my cups of water and ask for more tortilla chips.Just sayin.",eYW6HKDCOLAf1COkxhVG5g,2,1,3,7y2O88_ShXVsIZBnghrMRQ

The food is overall nice and feels fresh.The presentation is also very acceptable. The decoration is interesting and different which is a bonus for a restaurant in Vegas considering the competition is very high.

One would think that for that price, the tortillas would be made in house, but no, they're the same crap you get at the grocery store. The red snapper tacos were the most well received item at the table. As far as decor, the building itself is great, but the overdone Mexican kitsch is just annoying.

I have, at this point, tried almost everything on the menu.. but tonight I went for the Enchiladas de Mariscos, which were tender and flavorful shrimps with queso fresco and sour cream rolled in two soft flour tortillas and drenched in a delicious tomatillo sauce. The sauce tasted like what my Grandmother's marinara would if she were from Mexico instead of Italy- I could eat that shit on white rice. It was like heaven, if heaven were a sauce. Long story short, it made the dish. The shrimps were super moist and tender, like they had been poached instead of grilled like most places do. Fiancee had the Chilean sea bass tacos again, and as per previous review, they were exceptional. 
The service is always great, and multiple servers checked in on us and were playful.

2648873,2015-06-24,6,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"As a Mexican, I am highly disappointed in this place. I walked in and the dude must have not seen the nopal (cactus) on my forehead, and proceeded to speak to me in English, which may not mean anything to someone who is not of our culture, but for me, you should at least say Buenos Dias or Hola as a salutation if you claim to be a Mexican or Mexican inspired restaurant, (unless you are just ripping off of our food and culture, *sigh*).

First problem their salsa for their chips, is nothing but tomato sauce with hardly anything to make it a ""salsa"" which was unfortunate. I ended up ordering the shrimp enchiladas in tomatillo sauce.  Here's where the second issue comes up. They made their shrimp in a salsa roja first prior to making the enchilada and then added the tomatillo sauce on the top which completely clashed. Tasted more like a sweet and sour enchilada, which might mean they are going for an Asian-Mexi fusion? The arroz and frijoles were just okay. I had a piece of their Tres Leches cake for dessert because I couldn't make my mind up between that and the flan, so I took the waiter's advice. While it looked pretty, it was just a piece of a thick cornbread doused in a la Lechera/milk mix. 

The only thing authentic about this place was the Mexican Coca Cola that I had, the Mexicans working in the back, oh and the decor was nice. Bye Felipe!!!

2nd part of this rant, because I stewed in angryface as I walked back to the office, which could have been a combination of the amount I paid them, the fact that they are called ""La Comida"" when I left wanting real Mexican food, and because esta mas caliente que el culo del diablo outside. (translation: it's so hot outside it's hotter than Satan's a**hole... pardon my language but it was like 106 degrees outside)

Seriously they should change their name to THE FOOD, because they don't deserve to sell anything remotely to even be considered Mexican.",GtN4uGWhXgIkLzx72JAq_A,4,0,1,on7L3H4256srkLCQs3bq3Q

As the expert tour guide that I am, I quick pull a 180 and see out of the corner of my eye this little joint called, ""La Comida"". Surely, the best restaurants are the ones that look a little sketch on the outside. She becomes a little concerned but agrees none the less. We turned the corner down the long walkway to the entrance and it becomes cuter and cuter. As we enter, the inside has an authentic type feel and is surprisingly really awesome! The decor has a theme and the place is pretty hopping.

So we order drinks, the house margarita and a prickly pear margarita (when in the southwest, do as the tourists do). They come out in mason jars and that adds to the ambiance. The staff was super friendly and got really excited when our guy friend followed the sign above the bar that read ""For a good time call Kat (insert restaurant phone number)"". The man who waited on our table was really fun and kept calling us ""family.""

We ordered the Red Snapper Tacos and the guy friend got the red snapper entree. Both were good. They tasted fresh and the flavors blended well, but the tortillas felt a bit slimy. However, the best part of the culinary experience was the salsa--hands down! The salsa was a blend of spicy and smooth, and was probably one of the best salsas I have had in a really long time! 

Mid-way through our meal, the guy friend comments that this would be a great date place. He is totally right, fun ambiance, good (and slightly messy) food, and the volume is great for conversation.",AzcB-NUs6hOxbq-BVqzd-Q,2,0,4,wfozHIhjDjNZDa2avmulYA

Overall, nothing about my rating changes (still 4-stars), but a quick update to my previous review:  my last visit for lunch was last week with co-workers.  Five of us went in and before any orders were placed we told our waiter we wanted separate checks (one couple, plus three individual checks).  We were told ""we're not allowed to do separate checks anymore"".  I've been to restaurants that won't allow separate checks for parties over a certain size, but we were a group of five asking for four checks.  Separate checks were never a problem in the past.  Not allowing a small group to have separate checks suggests a willingness to inconvenience the customer for the convenience of the restaurant.

The torta that my daughter ordered had the worst meat patty I have ever seen in any dining establishment.  Not only that, but the ham smelled terrible.

Weathered white, distressed woods, mismatched frames, but still cohesive and cute. 

The food is superb too. They offer a chorizo sausage queso, so amazing. Their carne asada tacos, flavorful, tender meat. The staff was also very generous with chips and salsa. 

Gabe, the bartender, was amazing. He was friendly, nice, and made easy conversation with our group. Exactly how a good bartender should be. And their selection was good, we (of course) stuck mostly to tequila....namely Don Julio. And they have a wooden swing at the bar. Think ""swing from a big tree"" type swing.

Ok so I was heading to Le Thai but they were closed and I remembered around the corner this place so strolled into in. Checked Yelp photos for an ideas and then placed our order consisting of guacamole & chips ( amazing guac BTW ) chicken burrito , Mexican corn & steak fajitas.

So the guac comes and we're excited cause it's extremely tasty but then the entrees show up and the place sank faster than the titanic. The mexi corn was horrible, it was cold and sour. My burrito was not so bad and the green sauce was fantastic but it was a below average burrito. It consisted of rice and chicken but lacked the taste bud punch needed to put a smile on my face. Now the photo of fajitas may look amazing but looks are deceiving. #1 it didn't show up on a sizzling metal plate as 99.9% serve it. Meat tasted like it had been microwaved ( I tried and spit out into napkin cause it was so bad) so it was tough and lacked that fajita taste. The veggies and meat were kinda cold so this give you an idea of why It wasn't a winner.

La Comida has an amazing look from the bar to the dining room, which are all in the same area. I met up with my family here after dinner as they had suggested La Comida for a few drinks before heading out into downtown. I bellied up to the bar and took a look at the margarita menu. I'm not a huge tequila fan so I asked the bartender what her favorite drink was on the menu? ""El Corral"", she replied. Well saddle up partner...let's do this. 

The ""El Corral""  margarita comes with Anejo Tequila, sour mix & Grand Marnier. The drink was refreshing at first and not over powering with the tequila, however, with every sip the drink got sweeter and sweeter. I actually didn't even finish the whole drink, I passed the rest to my GF and ordered a whiskey based margarita. Mmmm, this was super tasty and very interesting. A little Jameson, soda water and a splash of sweet & sour mix. Not on the menu, but if you sweet talk Tanya she might make one for ya. I did try my cousin's drink, the Tamarind margarita, and I liked this one a little bit than my original drink. More salty than sweet.  I'll get you next Tamarind...next time. Muahahahah

I did eat chips and salsa while I was here and I looovvveee me some chips and salsa. The offerings at La Comida are above and beyond. I ordered the Roma Tomato and Habanero salsa which definitely had a kick, but nothing too strong for the palate. I loved this and could have possibly eaten the whole bowl by myself. 

My time in La Comida was brief, but delightful. The younger local ambience was a nice department from the touristy Strip area and sometimes sterile surroundings of Henderson. To quote the Terminator, ""I'll be back!""",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,3,3,4,3t-7KwlgT35A8oCaj3Ahzw

My other half and I rolled in here shortly after 6:00 PM, the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. We were told, our only option is the right side of the bar, so we took it. It was clear they were setting up for an event, while still trying to accept walk ins. 
First, let's talk about the positives. I love the decor. The hidden front walkway entrance. The swing. (yes a real swing at the bar) And of course the huge wall of tequila is pretty breathtaking. Maybe the authentic look set my expectations too high. 
Between the two of us, we ordered fajitas, potato tacos, ceviche, a salsa trio, and a guava margarita. The fajitas were bland. Not bad, just boring. What fajitas don't come out sizzling? These ones. 
Potato taco, I would give these a C+ or even B-. Not bad, but not amazing. The best part was the jalapeno crema. (Not what I expect the best part to be on a taco)
Ceviche, PASS! I was so excited because it came with mango and jalapeno. Nope. Way too sweet, not nearly enough lime, cilantro, or cucumber to even out the flavors. 
Salsa trio, 2 outta 3 were great. The ""attempt at being spicy"" one, try again folks.

The tiny portions of chicken in the faitias were unbelievable.  

6 small strips of chicken. 

We ordered 2 chicken faitias and while the food was very tasty the portions were a joke for $17
You get 3 tortillas and you could barely make 2 tiny ones.

Then they give you one smallish plate of rice and beans to split.
So If I ordered one faitia dish I would get one plate of rice and beans but you still only get one small plate when you order two faitia dishes. Come on... give people what they paid for. Each dish should have it's own plate of rice and beans. Especially for $17.

Seriously it must have cost them no more than $2 for my $17 dish. 

My niece ordered a salad for $10 and chicken with it for an additional $3 and her plate had at least 3 times the amount of chicken than one faitia dish.

The points people make about the cost are somewhat valid, but this isn't a taqueria, this is much more of a chef driven better quality restaurant. Puerco ahumado was $15, but for a huge portion of smoked pork in a mole`. Great taste. At $11 for 2 the tacos are overpriced, but are high quality so you are getting what you pay for. My usual taqueria has all tacos for $1.30, so I feel the price point issue like everyone else.
These are modern/upscale versions of Mexican food, so don't come here and expect it to be ""authentic"" (see my comment about $1.30 tacos above for my idea of Mexican American food, but there are lots of variations on Mexican cuisine, including fine dining in Mexico so what really is ""authentic""?).
Nice place, communal seating, very nice looking antique-ish back bar, and very good service make this place worth checking out. The drinks are interesting, and they have a massive selection of tequilas (up to $100) to try if you're interested in something other than Jose Cuervo.

Food - The menu is short and sweet. They have lots of Mexican favorites. My favorite are the street tacos. The chicken and steak are perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The tortillas are fluffy, and the guacamole is fresh. They also bring out a large plate of rice and beans to share family style for the table. 

Drinks - They have the most fun and exotic margarita flavors. I have a strong liking for the paseo fruit and guava flavors. They are the perfect blend of fruit and tequila, and the tequila is hidden. They will hit you after 2-3.",GUx6CHEbdcNVVXDIDm5Bxw,0,0,5,4_VtVXvydGNCAJ_lxI0ocg

On the inside, there was quite a variety of Catholic imagery -- for instance, the bathrooms were marked with small pictures of Mother Mary and Jesus. My aunt teased my grandmother and I endlessly for being confused as to which room was meant for the ladies!

My family and I were quickly greeted by the host and were seated promptly in the large booth my uncle spotted in the back. Chips and salsa were brought out, albeit in small-ish cans, which led to several refills for a party of 6. The salsa was delicious, as well as the avocado sauce and tomatillo sauce. Om nom nom. Our waiter was kind, attentive, and on the ball with ensuring our chips and water were filled.

I ordered shrimp tacos, which were remarkably tiny for $12; however, they packed quite a punch in flavor. Spicy is a bit of an understatement. Our table split two small plates of rice and beans. For the price, the size of the dishes seemed tiny, but in the end, the portion was right. I left the restaurant feeling full, but not stuffed, which was a huge plus.

Definitely recommend for those wanting to get off the Strip and into downtown. Enjoyed the food, enjoyed the decor, and definitely enjoyed the company. I'll be sure to visit again next time I am in town.",qpuYp31W89tq6vaGY6wLVg,1,1,4,HY9FzXdCD92Qw4uwc8YfQA

We didn't have dinner so the only food I can review is the free chips/salsa. I like hot flavors. I usually order the hottest wings available when I go out for wings. But there was something about the salsa that didn't agree with me. It tasted good, but my mouth was on fire and my tongue hurt for about 2 days. No idea why lol.

It has been made to feel like a seedy Mexican cantina where you might hire someone to kill your boss, while at the same time being a cozy little bar you would feel comfortable taking your mother to. We tried the mole chicken enchiladas, and the shrimp tacos. I typically find mole to be too sweet and rich, but the chicken was so flavorful that the mole wasn't overpowering and created a nice balance. The shrimp is VERY lightly battered and served in small corn tortillas with small pieces of mango and a jalapeño crema. Typically mango served in tacos is huge chunks and creates too much juice, and/or they just fall out. These are more like mango ""shavings"", which made the tacos much more enjoyable.

3304176,2013-12-31,0,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Finally a good decent Mexican spot near East Fremont!

We decided to stop by La Comida as it was one of the few places that allow underage diners after 8pm on East Fremont. SMH @ The Park on Fremont!  I had a great experience here at one of the Yelp Elite events earlier this year and wanted to see what the place was like without the VIP treatment. 

To begin the restaurant is pretty unique in it's design and decor. What used to previously be a laundromat has been transformed into a chic cantina style Mexican eatery with plenty of Catholic influences. The bathrooms are gender separated by pictures of Mary and Jesus while rosaries hang from the light fixtures. I wonder if anyone ever gets offended by it?

The menu is little different than most Mexican restaurants. No combo plates or nachos here, instead you find an eclectic spin on some of your south of the border dishes. The menu isn't huge but everyone should find something that they like. I ordered the Mexican burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were delicious and the burger, complete with ancho chilies and jalapeno bacon, was pretty unique. Word of caution: all of our burgers were served very rare - specify to your server if you want it cooked longer. My cousin ordered the enchiladas which would have been great if not ruined by the heavy serving of mole sauce all over them. La Comida serves unlimited family style rice and beans with their entrees for everyone at the table to share. 

Service was great. Our server was very friendly, on top of refills, and very knowledgeable about the menu. It was nice to see the manager out on the dining floor interacting with diners as well. 

You can tell La Comida specializes in margaritas from their massive tequila selection. Extra props for serving up these concoctions in a mason jar!  The walk-up window by the outdoor porch and the giant wooden swing by the bar are a nice touch,

If you are looking for some good Mexican fare give this place a shot. You at least get free chips and salsa!",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,3,1,4,Xuzwj0ZZ8CE4DHmdPTxLQQ

The entire restaurant is open so you can see out onto the street and people walking or driving by can see in.  It's sort of roped off and you walk around the side of the building to get in.  I like the fact that you can see the cooks preparing the food but I hated the dinning area.  It is very small and they cram as many tables as possible into a tiny area.  It was 2 of us and they sat us at a 2 person table next to a table of four.  The tables were so close together we might as well have been siting with them.  If I stuck my elbow out it would have touched the person sitting at the next table.  To me that is ridiculous.  Thankfully they were wrapping up so we asked to be moved over after they left.  Now the menu, first thing I noticed was that the food is EXTREMELY over priced and there are no lunch specials.  I specifically asked the waiter did the meals come with sides and he said beans and rice.  The fish tacos were good but tiny.  We also ordered chicken enchiladas and asked for double rice, no beans with that dish. When the meals came the server only brought 1 small plate of beans and rice which were cold.  The other side of rice never came, I know they didn't expect us to share!  I called the waiter over and told him the beans and rice were cold and he was like ""Really"" and told him the double rice never came.  The chicken enchiladas were good besides the sauce on top, it was a very sweet sauce.  The service was a little slow but okay and the waiter did eventually bring out more beans and rice but by that time we were practically done with our main dish.

Very hip, eclectic, day of the dead decor which I love for its quirkiness with a pinch of darkness. Only down side is the entrance is no where near the hostess station.

The wait for our table was not long and once seated the waiter came over to get our drink order within reasonable time. 

The waiter was very nice and explained things on the menu to me because it was my first time there. Ultimately my friend and I ordered three dishes and the avocado based salsa. Now here is were things went downhill for me. First of all the food took quite a awhile to come out (which I can let them slide on because they were extremely busy that night) but it also came out in spurts which was somewhat disruptive to the flow of our meal. Then the food... 

Of everything we ordered I only liked one dish. We had the chicken enchiladas, the elote asado, and the queso fundido. The only dish I like was the elote asado because it had great taste and was literally addicting. It reminded me of being in LA and getting the corn-on-the-cob version from the little cart... Lol! Ijs! The fundido was okay but not enough meat for me. The enchiladas was the worst of all. It had a mole sauce which he said would be kind of sweet but it wasn't. The taste of the sauce was awful to me and the chicken was tasteless.  I have had great mole sauces and this was not one of them... Deeply disappointed! As for the salsas... To thin for my taste and not flavorful enough for my taste!

RESTAURANT

Even during the daytime, it's difficult to miss their skeleton monkey sign that entices your curiosity and draws you into the restaurant. The wooden tables with their long benches and the folding chairs give it a homey vibe. Day of the Dead elements and rosaries that hang on the walls add touches of Mexican culture throughout the dining room. 

FOOD

Complimentary bowls of tortilla chips with salsa are presented as a light appetizer. I say order the guacamole, too.

Appetizer - Queso Fundido: Cheesy, gooey goodness served on a hot plate. 

Entree - Sea Bass A La Baja: When our server explained how these are the only tacos on the menu that use flour tortillas instead of corn, I had doubts. After my meal, I can't imagine corn being used for these tacos. The tempura battered sea bass was crunchy, and the chipotle mayo added a tolerable spiciness. I would never have thought that pickled radishes to complement the other flavors. This didn't disappoint.

Dessert - Flan: This is one of the best flans that I've had. It's solid and doesn't jiggle much. Smooth, creamy, and not super sweet.

Dessert - Fried Plantains with ice cream: Sweeter than the flan, the fried plantains retained their crunchiness even as the ice cream started to melt and created a pool in the bowl. Decent, but I prefer the flan. 

SERVICE

No complaints. Everything ran smoothly.

We ordered queso fundido. It's basically melted cheese and extremely hard to mess up. I've eaten this appetizer a million times at a million restaurants. The only way you can ruin this is by buying the cheapest cheese that probably isn't meant to be melted. There was a think layer of grease over the cheese, and it tasted like rubber.

Flautas De Pollo ($9) - Chicken, Oaxaca cheese, queso fresco, sour cream and tomatillo Salsa. Priced well and plated pretty, however these were more like rolled tacos and had a funky flavor. I'd personally pass in the future. 

Chicken Fajitas ($17) - You can choose chicken or steak. I had chicken and it comes with guacamole, pico de gallo, sauted corn, bell peppers and onions. The chicken was full of flavor and everything complimented each other nicely.

The chicken had a very smokey flavor to it and the vegetables were not over sautéed and still retained their crispness. The tortillas were corn or a mixture of corn and flour.  I would have preferred all flour. And for dessert we got the Tres Leches cake which was one of the better Tres Leches cake I have had.

3646199,2013-05-02,2,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Well holy shit - my first Vegas review!  I have recently relocated to the city of Vegas for work, from the beautiful Derby City of Louisville, KY, and I am having a blast exploring the city and everything it has to offer, so let's get down to it!

To me, the beauty of Mexican food is that it is very communal and down-to-earth.  Its flavors are brought to life through the simple preparation of simple ingredients, mixed just right.  It's just good, homely food, free of pretentiousness, generous in quantity, and best enjoyed in a laid-back, unassuming environment.

And that's precisely where La Comida, with its cool, bohemian, ironically hip vibe collides with the heart and soul of traditional Mexican food.  It strips away the real idiosyncrasies of authentic Mexican dining in order to offer a distant, mutated version of it, conveniently prepackaged for the haughty, trend-seeking crowd.  Let's face it, no Mexican restaurant touting any kind of authenticity would charge so damn much for such modest portions, nor would it pepper its ambiance with a faux Latin cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" by Eurhythmics and dubstep remixes of Ace of Base, which I caught playing over the PA.

To be fair, the food was not bad.  My Pollo al Horno was actually tasty (though a bit on the dry side) and the chips and salsa were also quite good and obviously homemade.  The service was also pretty good; prompt and very courteous, so basically the root of my dissatisfaction comes down to price.  Look, if you're going to charge me $20 for a margarita, I expect a commemorative pair of booty shorts, or a kitschy container I get to take home or something.  There is also no way I'm shelling out $5 for a can of PBR, unless that can is a barrel and I also feel if I'm going to pay $16 for a chicken entree, I should get my own rice and beans.  Having to share such a tiny portion with my entire table didn't feel like a courtesy but more of a peeve.

I'm not sure I want to back to La Comida.  I get the sense that they're trying to elevate and experiment with Mexican cuisine which is all fine and good but the food was just okay, which considering the prices and the ambiance to me it means they're way off the mark.  A cool vibe will never replace a satisfactory dining experience, so I echo the sentiments of those who've said they much rather eat a cheap, seedy joint offering better food at reasonable prices.

On that note, who's got recommendations for a GOOD Mexican place?  Sorry LV, this is one area where I still remain far from impressed!",Esw0eIaMfIbzRfAk4Ivepg,13,2,2,0Mw2rfhEQe9j91rZj0ZtZw

We usually get sangria when it's on any menu. La Comida's sangria was aight. I felt like it was more ice than sangria tho.
Second we got elote. C'mon...how can you ever get that dish really wrong!?! It's corn, mayo, and cheese -- delicious!
Sadly, I forget what my boyfriend and I got but, I know he got the fish and I got half a chicken wrapped in paper...(sorry for the bad description).... His fish was whatevs; and my chicken was good in that it was smoky but, it's not something that I would try again.
Our dessert of sautéed bananas and vanilla ice cream was the star of the show. Something about that ice cream...I think the real vanilla beans!

The grilled fish tacos ($12) were excellent! The Chicken Enchilada ($14) was just the right level of spicy. The Beef Fajita ($17) was very good, too. We also had an Ensalada Organica ($10).

It's a little pricier than the average Mexican food joint - as expected of anything downtown - but it's definitely worth it. 

I'd recommend trying the shrimp tacos! They've been the staple of each of my visits here, which has to count for something. The entree comes with 3 tacos that are overflowing with flavor: succulent, lightly-breaded shrimp tucked into a bed of purple cabbage & diced mango, which are tied together with a delicious jalepeno cream sauce & salsa.

My only critique is with the appetizers... The complimentary chips & salsa are perfect, but I've tried both the corn & the queso now and they both fell flat in my opinion. The corn tasted soggy or cooked in a pot of water for too long, while the queso was extremely hard to eat. The cheese it was made of wasn't nearly melty enough to easily scoop up with a chip or bit of tortilla. Kinda disappointing to me, but the other entrees make it easy to overlook.",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,1,0,4,VbPHmBWLjdSzDDIw8ie7Pw

Growing up in Los Angeles where there is good, authentic Mexican food everywhere, I've moved to Las Vegas and discovered that all of the Mexican food I've had here in Las Vegas so far is much like by butt.....very, very white. 

La Comida is not really any different. It's rather white-washed and toned down. It's got great flavour, don't get me wrong, but it just seems to lack depth. We ordered their street corn as an appetizer, and let me tell you, it wasn't ""street corn"". It was ""let's slap some stuff on this corn and call it street corn"" street corn.

I will definitely, though, hand it to their bar tender. Their drinks here are PHENOMENAL! But, I don't go to Mexican restaurants for mixed cocktails. I go for Mexican food. Lol. 

If you are downtown and want some light ""Mexican inspired"" food, try La Comida. And get a few of their cocktails. They're delicious. But if you're looking for some Mexican food that tastes just like abuela used to make, don't get your hopes up too high.

Place was empty but were told we would have a 30 minute wait. We agreed to wait at the bar for 15 minutes (and have a drink) then decide how long we would be able to wait. Well, 10 minutes after hitting the bar we were told our table was ready.

Now, the food. Our worst experience. I ordered a shrimp, chorizo, yellow squash dish with other mixed veggies.  It would of been a good dish expect the squash was not cooked (i think it was still raw and left nothing to be desired).

Husband ordered the vegetarian taco's which were barely eaten. He's not picky but they just weren't good.

The hi-light of the dinner was the guacamole. Small cup for $10 bucks but a least is was good.

Not likely to return.  Unfortunately, after 3+ meals we couldn't even get a single great meal.

Also, pretty proud pricing!

I have IndiCard which is a discounted app for people in Vegas who work in the industry. For this particular restaurant the deal was ""50% of margaritas and $5 beer bottle or draft."" 
After we finished eating we wanted drinks. We tell Sergio which drinks we want (Sergio my waiter) and he walked away before I could even tell him about my IndiCard. He comes back with my drinks, again walks away before I could even say ""I have a question."" He comes back and asks if we were done and I say yes and I finally asked him about my IndiCard. 

He says I was suppose to say I have IndiCard before I order drinks. I've used IndiCard before and I've never had a problem with showing it last before I pay. This time it was a problem. He said there was nothing he can do to add my discount that if I would of showed he would type in some key that would automatically add the discount. 
I'm assuming the manager or owner was there that night and I wanted to speak with him but I didn't wanna be a total ass crying about $7 worth of a discount really. But then again if he would of stopped walking away every time I tried speaking to him this situation would of never happened. 

Working in the industry I know you can void things out and do it all over again. I also know it's a hassle but if a customer is unhappy or has a way of saving money you help them. Even if it's a pain. Because if you don't you get Yelp reviews like this. Sorry Sergio.",2txk62rcVvbUU38_DzMy4g,1,0,1,lGrMUiy7IcQnP-Ob5DDJbw

-o- Carnitas, a little bland & on the dry side.  Good sized for street tacos, but, at $5.50 each, they should be big.  BTW, it is 2 to an order, so, $11 for an order.  I did the math.
-o- Salsa, a little too Old El Paso, heavy on the tomato, light on the, well, everything else. 
-o- Chips were decent, but not sure if from a bag or fried in store.  Not very salted which could be good if your blood pressure is high, or bad if you like flavor.
-o- Shot, a perfect Don Julio Anejo, but for $19, it had better be perfect.

I like the cantina look of the place, but not the mason glasses or plastic chairs.  Also, no draft beer. I did take a picture of my food, which had fairly decent presentation.

I typically am not harsh with my ratings, but $30 for 2 tacos & a shot while sitting in plastic patio chairs does not seem like smart restaurant-ing.  I suppose the truth hurts; it hurt my wallet for sure.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,11,1,2,6QZA9l9kbAuDdzGBqKuziw

Aside from that, I thought the food, service, and atmosphere at La Comida were all top-notch. The owner (same owner/chef/developer as the restaurants in the Palms) obviously put a lot of thought and time into the design of the space, with some exposed brick/wallpaper walls, rustic-y furniture, a marquee over the bar, and a small patio. It's a livelier atmosphere, even at lunch, with fairly loud music playing throughout. 
Our waiter was friendly, prompt, and helpful, explaining to us that the menu item 'huarache' is actually a tostada of some sort in the shape of a huarache. Weird, but cute.
We ate the pork tacos and the red snapper tacos. Both were very good. 
Chips and salsa were good, but nothing special.

After almost 10 minutes we were noticed and asked what we wanted to drink.  I asked for one of their specialty drinks that was supposed to have blueberries in it, but was given a mojito.  My husband asked for a Corona Light, but was given a Corona. No big deal, I like mojitos too.

Next we ordered chicken enchiladas and a chicken burrito.  The enchiladas were under-temp and the mole was a little too sweet.  The burrito was spicy and good, but looked exactly like one you can get from Chipotle.  As for the beans and rice, they don't come close to authentic Mexican rice and beans... they were almost insulting.

Overall, we had fun and it's in a nice location and it has a fun atmosphere.  Just don't expect to be impressed with the food.

4054599,2013-04-23,17,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.  

New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service. 

My first thought upon arriving here was ""Wow"".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another ""Wow"".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  

There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.

As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times ""I love my food"".  

It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.

Went here with a few friends on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy but we had trouble being served. It took forever to get someone around to help us.

The place wasn't busy either.

The food wasn't anything to write home about. It should be more memorable. I just remember the rice being bland. This is partly due to the blood orange margaritas. Those are delicious without being too sweet. If you want to enjoy yourself, get a pitcher of that. 

Overall, it's a very underwhelming experience where the service takes it down a notch. They lack any enthusiasm. They don't even pretend to care that you are there.

Someone came and took my plate and fork before I was done eating, so fast I couldn't even grab my fork back!

Located in the Fremont East area, a block or so from Container Park, the outside is inviting just by the shear whimsical flair of the neon monkey sign and brightly colored flowerpots lining the walls as you enter and finally the traditional Virgin Mary of Guadalupe statue.  
Inside is equally thoughtful in the Mexican design.  The bar area, stocked full of different tequilas  (and other liquors and beers) is adorned with rustic wooden and stained glass cathedral pieces. The walls with weathered wallpaper and tons of rosaries surround wooden tables with a mish-mash of Mexican style chairs and benches. A+ in decor. 
Food, it's good, but not fantastic. The chips and salsa they provide are very good, the guac is also very good. However, the other dishes we've ordered are not so fabulous. The pozole was decent in flavor, and quite a bit of chili was added to bring more flavor. The burrito was commented to be good, but nothing spellbinding. The chicken fajitas were definitely tasty, but I was disappointed that they seemed warmed and served on a regular plate. Traditionally, Tex-Mex fajitas are usually served sizzling and steaming hot. The chicken tacos have some strange green guac-salsa verde that is not very appetizing. If we go again I will ask for no green salsa on top of the tacos. The house margarita was very tasty, though! I like how they serve it in a mason jar, keeping with the artsy-rustic feel.

Honestly, I feel like there's no excuse to charge these prices for Mexican food. I mean, wtf. It's guacamole and corn chips and tequila, for pete's sake! It wasn't reCOCKulously expensive -- not as bad as I'd feared -- but was still pricey for what it was.

Food-wise, everything was ok. The free chips & salsa are fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but they did replenish our basket without even asking, so I give them points for that. I ordered the cheapest margarita on the list, which at $9 was OK... not bad by Strip standards, but this isn't the Strip!! Then I had the street corn appetizer, which was good, but...any better than real street corn at Valley View & Sahara for a fraction of the price? Then the snapper tacos, which were ok, but again...two smallish tacos for $12 or whatever it was? Really?

Loved the decor of this place, from the flower pot adorned walkway to the wooden table tops inside. The place was only about 30% full so we received a table immediately. 

Since we were trying to sober up, we declined anything to drink beyond the water filled mason jars. Our server asked us multiple times if we were sure which was a tad grating. Chips and salsa were placed on our table and we dove right in. The salsa was fresh tasting but lacked any sort of flavor or kick that would make it distinctive. When we ordered, we decided on the queso fundido, chicken flautas, and the Mexican burger. It was all decent enough and pretty much standard. Although I will admit that we did not choose any dishes that were unique. I had been eating some leftover shrimp tacos all week which is why I went with the strange decision of having a hamburger in a Mexican restaurant. My burger was generous with the avocado and had a huge mound of sweet potato fries. 

The reasons for giving a three star: the mediocre quality of the food we had and the service. When were close to ending our meal, our server asked if we wanted boxes. I had half a burger left and plenty of fries so I absolutely wanted to bring the rest home. He dropped the boxes off at our table and about two minutes later asked ""do you need help with that?"" and pointed to my box and my plate. I was in the middle of telling a story to my friends (so he interrupted me) and his tone was one of annoyance, not of trying to be helpful. I told him that I could handle it and my table mates were kind of flabbergasted at his tone. So I packed up my box and he immediately rushed over and cleared everything out of the way, including the napkin I was still using to wipe my hands with. It felt like we were being rushed out of there and it just lessened our experience, especially since they weren't trying to turn over the table and we weren't excessively lingering around (it wasn't close to closing time either). I don't know if we were being sensitive but it was enough to leave an impact on us.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,2,0,3,IRGNio3AwpNzrnAFoLUpjA

Top notch service and a modern, urban huntsman design meets Mexico City's ""La Condesa/La Roma"" district decor greet the hungry diner upon entering this oasis of cool.  Buttery green tufted leather Chesterfield style banquettes line one section of La Comida, allowing patrons VIP people watching privileges while tailored rough hewn wooden dining tables dot the center of the dining hall.  Every detail in the design of La Comida has been considered and will not disappoint, including the stained glass cathedral windows that make up the presentation of the bar.

The service, starting with the reception desk and all of the restaurant team that we encountered, were La Comida's biggest and most impressive asset, what an incredible crew that has been assembled for this venture.

While decor and service are important, we had come in to enjoy a nice Cinco de Mayo Mexican food feast and for the most part, we were not disappointed.  While there were some dishes that were spot on, we found others that needed a little more refinement.  The chicken burrito, while chock full of tender pieces of shredded chicken, was overwhelmed by a spicy green chili sauce.  Others in our party of three enjoyed their tacos, guacamole, cocktails, real Mexican Coke and other specialties.  There has been some mention of the costs at La Comida, however, as an overall package - the food, fun, service and decor, it was well worth the expense.

4348209,2014-09-12,5,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Since Minh plans our anniversary trips, I get to plan our anniversary dinner wherever we go.

After doing some research and asking some of our Vegas friends about this place, (the other reviews really do not do it justice) I was told that this would be the perfect spot of us.

Called the week of and made reservations, the girl who answered the phone was pleasant. I was asked if we were celebrating anything that night. Said we were it was our anniversary. Was told that there would be something special for us after our dinner. I do not ever except a restaurant to do anything nice like that (half the time they are busy and forget). 

We arrived sort of late due to the fact we were staying about 30 minutes from DTLV. No, problem as I called to let them know we were running late. The guy who answered the phone said he would move our reservation to an hour later just in case we hit traffic. Parking is by street only, which is not a huge deal as this place is located right in the heart of all the awesome bars and Fremont Street!

Walking into this place is just how the photos are, super dark and full of amazing vintage lights, a neon pink monkey sits high above on the side of the building, potted plants and flowers line the side of the wall, Mexican artwork and religious figures greet you as you walk inside.  **Note: You enter in on the side of the building. It looks confusing but trust me as we stood outside after taking photos looking like to dumb idiots trying to figure out how to get inside** 

Entering into the actual restaurant was even more beautiful! It was still dark with candles on the table, Día de Muertos stuff was displayed all over, and they were playing The Cure and other likes of music. I am in LOVE!

The hostess showed us to our table, and then our server came promptly after to take our drink order while another server brought us fresh chips and salsa. We decided to order some guacamole to go a long with our crunchy snack. For $8.00, you get a huge bowl of freshly prepared guacamole mixed with pico de gallo, jalapeno, and zesty lime juice. Muy delicioso!!

Ordered one more appetizer to try Elotes Asados $8.00
Mexican Street Corn, queso fresco and chile lime butter. It is off the cob, which makes it a lot easier to share. They give you a huge plate of this too!

Our server gave us more than enough time to enjoy our conversation and appetizers. When we were ready she came back to take out order.

Enchilada De Pollo- $14.00 -Pulled Chicken, queso fresco, onions and mole poblano sauce.
I was not expecting this enchilada dish to be giant but it was staring right back at me. The smell from the mole sauce started to make me drool (and kind of miss my nana she made the best mole) Well here goes nothing, I sank my fork and knife into the hot mole and tortilla out came a huge cloud of steam followed by the aroma of marinated pollo and onion. First bite was delicious!  The mole sauce was sweet but not over baring like some of them can be! 

I tried my hardest to finish the whole thing but with a night of partying after, I decided it probably would not be a good idea to be Enchilada wasted!

Service was great, they did not do anything for our anniversary like promised, but as I said, I do not ever expect! 

Would we return yes! Their happy hour I heard is awesome, as I would like to try their sangria and some more of their appetizers.",coKnuxLznH0FHb34m4ZLCw,6,7,5,_26Nzehzqri234wvGNVc-A

4373648,2018-04-17,1,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Unfortunately, I tried this place out for the first time for my birthday yesterday and I'm sorry I did. Christian was our server around 7pm (4/15/18) and we were about the 4th table to be sat in there. 

Christian wasn't the most enthused to be working or even to be talking to us. I've been a server before though and I understand that feeling sometimes. However, when you're working for tips... whatever. 

We ordered the elote (corn) for appetizers and those were good, but I'd have to stay away from the ""Ceviche"" (shrimp cocktail). Me and my guests (2 others) took a shrimp each and just made a face to each other and decided we didn't want that. 

My guests ordered a torta, chile relleno, and I ordered the ""steak"" tacos. The chile was just alright (hardly any flavor), the ""steak"" tacos were ground beef tacos that were so overcooked that it was more like crunchy oil crisps. (wish I would have taken a photo).

When the food runner dropped off our food it was JUST THAT. More like a ""hi... here... bye."" Didn't ask if we needed anything before we started our meal, and Christian didn't come back to check on us, refill our waters, or make sure we had everything we needed, so one of my guests didn't get her watered filled once, and had an empty cup for her whole meal. 

This whole experience was such a joke, and I just kept trying to keep my mouth shut so not to make anyone uncomfortable. But once I noticed my friends water hadn't been filled the whole time, I had to speak up. 

Upon letting Christian know that I wasn't a fan of the Ceviche and that we had it taken away, his response was ""Well, I told you it wasn't like a traditional ceviche."" I also let him know that the taco meat was overcooked and not steak like I had hoped but what seemed to be left at the bottom of the grease, and his face was as if I was wasting his time and insulting him personally. Christian said he couldn't take the ceviche off but he'd take the tacos off of the bill, because I literally looked at them after receiving them and put them at the edge of the table in hopes to order something else. So when he didn't come back except to end our ""service"" and give us a check, everyone else was done with their meals and I was PISSED OFF because the birthday girl didn't even get to eat dinner. 

Upon my friend paying the bill, he came back to offer the change and said oh yeah, and I accidentally took the wrong thing off your bill (meaning to be the tacos) but they're like the same price"" WOW LOL 

I WILL NEVER be back here again AND I'll do everything in my power to make sure I tell all of my friends not to even try this joke of a place. 

Christian, I don't know if you were having a bad day or if you just didn't care but I hope you find something more suitable for your personality to do for a living. 

Food wise- This is NOT authentic anything. PS- you don't use Jasmine rice for Spanish rice. WTF?! Gross Gross Gross.

Service 4.5/5 -- Although both experiences were very different, I experienced positive customer service. There's a server there who is extremely helpful who served us the first time... He's the guy who also works at Firefly! 

My second time I sat at the bar to eat and had a bartender on our side who was busy. He was an older gentleman with white hair. He was quite inattentive with us and I understand how busy it was (I work in the restaurant business as well) but I really found it hard to capture his attention, especially when I was ready to order things. I personally felt like he skipped over us and couldn't even give us a ""okay, be right there"" type of response. He did end up noticing that I was probably slightly irritated and offered us free shots and a drink. The fact that he acknowledged it made me feel better about the service and the free things just made my experience way better!

Price 4/5 -- it's like $11-14 for three tacos. They're pretty delicious, though, and the food comes with delicious rice and beans and chips and salsa. It was $10ish for the Blood Orange Magarita. 

Food 4.5/5 -- the tacos are delicious! I had the pollo and carne asada tacos. I am a huge fan with how fresh it tasted! The meat wasn't dry like some other places and the tacos had the right flavors. The Spanish rice that comes with your meal was also sooooooo delicious. I sometimes crave it! The guacamole is delicious as well! Yummy yummy. The salsa is free and yummy as well!

I ordered the blood orange margarita and it was so delicious! Does it even have any alcohol?! I could drink it like juice. The tequila shots we ordered were in the cutest cups too. 

Overall, positive experiences despite the little hiccups in the beginning. Food and drinks are yummy but a little on the pricy side. I would come back here every now and then and definitely recommend their margaritas!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,12,13,4,jFduJn6oDwQvDGm_4DCHsA

I came to La Comida on the evening of Thursday the 24th for a round of drinks with my fiancé. We were waiting for a table at another restaurant but wanted to enjoy some delicious drinks like we've had on previous occasions, except after this evening I feel like NEVER returning. Correction. NEVER returning when there's a certain manager but most importantly a bartender. 

My fiancé and I walked in and headed straight to the bar, we let the hostess know we didn't need to be seated. After sitting at the bar our bartender (John) came up and just stood in front of us, he didn't greet us or ask us if we were ready to order or if we needed a menu. After an awkward moment I told him I wanted a drink menu. He returned with the menu and left without saying anything. I had just been at this establishment 2 weeks ago and ordered the same tamarind margarita and this time my fiancé ordered the margarita with squirt. When he brought the drinks I noticed that my drink was not rimmed how it usually is (with this sugary chili spicy rim) and the drink tasted just like tamarind. Once again, I state that i've dined at this establishment many times and there has always been a high level of consistency with food and drinks.

Anyway, I was hoping that he would stop by and check on our drinks or even ask us if we wanted to order food (you know to increase their ticket price) but NOPE, during the 45 minutes we were there he kept talking to a party of 3 that was sitting next to us. He ignored us and didn't check in on us at all. Also, he took a break and his manager took over during that time. She, just like him ignored us and spent all her time talking to that party of three, in fact she paid so much attention to them that she was even pouring their bottle water in a glass for them while they ate. 

I hope to return one day because this manager and bartender didn't demonstrate the level of customer service i've had before but will not be going if they're there! I'm so glad we have this forum to express our experiences, so BEWARE!!!

BTW, just to let you know how upset I was, I left him a $0.01 tip. That's how bad of service it was.",0SMtO3NR5F9B0fYThXF0gA,7,0,1,cMj2mBwu22ZxvHPesOOWAw

What I liked:
The mason jar cups, patterned wallpaper, and hipster servers really gave it that downtown feel with a cool modern Hispanic flavor. Our server was pretty great as well, and I really enjoyed the energy and fun all of the server shared with one another.

What I ordered:
The Ceviche de Camaron - Worst ceviche I've ever had... It was caked with some kind of cilantro sauce. Also the shrimp was very small, something you'd find in a cheap buffet. But the plantain chips were a nice spin, it was the first time I had them with ceviche.

Mexican Burger - *Beware* if your server recommends the Mexican burger don't get it. Three of us ordered it and none of us finished it... came out very rare. Wish my server asked me how I wanted it cooked. The sweet potato fries were very mushy and got cold quick as well.

They gave us unlimited family style rice and beans for FREE with our entrees which was great, but they taste pretty average. Don't be impressed, but heck at least they were free!

The service:
Server was terrific and very knowledgeable of the menu and it's offerings. All of their servers seemed like hipsters and did a great job taking care of one another's tables.

Overall, I was not very impressed by this place and I can see why they have a 3 1/2 star rating on yelp. 

Imho, La Comida was an exceptional experience for it's atmosphere but the food quality and taste really disappointed. I would highly recommend this place for the atmosphere and vibe, the food not so much. If you're feeling mediocre Mexican food and want to experience the new downtown feel give it a shot.

If you can it can be a little frustrating.  However once you find a parking spot or walk here the ambience is very interesting.  The Decour is very Catholic almost bordering on creepy and I am a Catholic. The service is very fast and very good.  I had carne asada tacos with beans and rice.

4571226,2013-04-29,9,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"As a native Texan, I have a hard time even bringing myself to go to Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas - my palate is honed to Tex Mex, powerful salsas, reasonable prices...

I saw La Comida pop up and decided it would great to try a new place downtown that had what seemed like a relatively authentic menu and great location.  We made reservations for Saturday night and met our friends there - both of us securing rockstar parking (it was early for Saturday dinner) and a half-moon booth inside but right by the open patio.

One of our friends is Mexican and saw huarache on the menu, a childhood favorite.  We were given a mini galvanized tub of warm chips and salsa, which was plain - our friend asked the server in Spanish for the non-gringo salsa which got us a chile de arbol salsa, which was not much better.  Waters were served in mason jars which is cute.

The server did ask before we opened our menus if we wanted guacamole with our chips - my friend immediately agreed - to which we experienced dismay upon opening the menu and seeing it for $11 - and the $11 did not include a tableside guac in molcajete show - but instead a small side bowl that was not much bigger than the mini salsa container.  That was a disappointment - at least do it tableside to charge that much - what I can make for $2 with 2 avocados!

Our table's order was our friends' getting huarache and queso fundido, I ordered the ceviche trio, and Eric R. got the chicken enchiladas with mole.  He was pleased to hear it came with rice and beans.  When the food was delivered, the queso came with tortillas, and Eric got a small plate with his 2 enchiladas (topped with pickled onions), and I got a small plate (see pic) with 3 divided sections with ceviche.  My husband's sad face was attributed to the ""communal"" rice and beans, which he thought was bizarre since he was not sharing his with anyone.

The huarache had cheap meat, not like the kind our friend expected.  He was a bit disappointed.  Eric R.'s meal was cold - he had an enchilada then sent his plate and the communal beans and rice back to be reheated.  The kitchen was nice enough to give him 2 new enchiladas hot.  Of my 3 ceviches, the snapper one was tasteless (dry fish, pepper, and sliced green and red bell peppers) but the shrimp in a green sauce and the bay scallop with tropical fruit were very tasty.

Overall, it seemed just too expensive for small portions and food that was not memorable.  The only thing memorable is the rip-off guacamole that we were somewhat conned into ordering.  Our server was nice but it took awhile to get our check taken care of though it was not terribly busy at the early hour.  This place will definitely stay popular, so enjoy those $20 margaritas (not kidding) and $7 bottles of XX - no beers on tap.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,27,10,2,TJeJ9sWReNtOQebbd8284w

I've gone here a few times and everytime I go I'm always disappointed in the food. The chips and salsa are so yummy and addicting but the food isn't really traditional. The last time I went I ordered a mojito which was really watered down and the nachos which sounded amazing but were sorely lacking when they showed up. For the price you pay you'd expect crisp chips and large juicy chunks of white tender chicken breast. Topped with melted cheese and fresh jalapeños. The chips were soggy, and the meat was dark meat and fatty. The jalapeños were soggy and canned. So disappointing.

Anyway, upon my first bite, I realized its appearance was deceiving as it was bursting with flavor.  The green had to have been cilantro, and it surprisingly wasn't overpowering at all.  There was a wonderful balance of spiciness, cilantro, lime and extremely fresh-tasting shrimp.  I was very pleased.

The service was good too.  We sat at the bar so we got to chat with the bartender and barback a little bit.  They were both very friendly and helpful.

4986645,2014-07-01,1,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Geez... I will most likely never return to La Comida. Food was ok, drinks were alright but the lack of service is what really ruined the experience. We've only been here once before during their early months of opening and it was an ok experience. We went for a Sunday brunch, so the menu was smaller. I thought the food was good, but nothing that stood out making me want to return. 

It was a Friday night and I wanted to try a new restaurant that had just opened around the corner, Carson Kitchen, but seeing as it was a Friday night around 8pm, there was an hour and a half wait, so we decided to try Carson Kitchen another night and eat somewhere else near that, leading us to La Comida. 

My party of 4 were sat at a table next to the bar, squeezed between other large parties. Servers bringing the complimentary chips and salsa came shortly after while we decided on drinks. We all ordered margaritas, which took a bit to arrive but whatev, it was Friday and the bar was busy. We had finished both baskets of chips and salsa before the waiter had returned to take our dinner order. Luckily I ordered the elotes asados (mexican street corn) to start (which was pretty darn delicious) so that held us over until our entrees came. When they finally did come, I had ordered the Sea Bass Frito a la Baja (primarily cabbage stuffed tacos with a little fried fish inside), my boyfriend got the Fajitas (pretty much a plate of steak on top of peppers and onions with tortillas, no toppings! wtf?). My mom had ordered the Enchilada de Pollo dish that was a mole enchilada, which she enjoyed, and my dad the Camaron del Golfo. He said that it was good, but a small portion. I will say though, he's a big guy so almost every dish is a small portion. We had finished everything.

We thought about possibly getting dessert since we were still hungry, but our waiter had not returned through the entire corse of the meal. No check up, no asking for another drink order, nothing. We had waited, irritated, for so long, that our dessert appetite was lost and I was ready to walk out without paying the bill, but we didn't. I had kept an eye out for our server, but he seemed to always walk on the other side of the restaurant and not even look in the direction of us. I finally had to ask a bus boy to grab our check so we could get the heck out of there.

After the bill was paid, we left, and I decided that I will most likely not return. In a town full of great Mexican food and attentive service, this place needs to take a few lessons. I think the only good things they've got going for them is being Downtown and having trendy decor.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,2,0,2,mHvM9Dv7fzwBvnPeLEjBsQ
4996147,2016-07-14,1,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Went there with a friend from out of town for the first time.   Only a couple customers already there when we walked-in at about 6:30PM on a Wednesday.

Greeted & seated promptly & served water, along with a very small bowl of chips & salsa.

As a vegetarian, I really didn't see anything on the menu that I could eat, though my 50 year old eyes & the dim lighting made the menu a little hard for me to read.

When the server came to take out orders, I asked if I could just get some cheese & onion enchiladas, though I didn't see that listed in the menu.  With the option of several sauces -- red, green or mole, I chose mole.  Expecting rice & beans to come with it, I asked for black beans (since refried beans are normally cooked in lard) & was informed that the meals come with rice & pinto beans.

During the 15 minutes or so between our order being taken & being served, we ate about half of the chips, and all of the salsa.      There was never an effort on the staff's part to see if we'd like more of either (& yes, I would have), or if we'd liked a spicier salsa (which I would have -- what they served was good, but sweet).

Eating at a variety of Mexican restaurants pretty regularly, I was immediately surprised by the small portion of food on my plate & that of my friend.    A small quantity of Mexican rice & pinto beans were brought to us on one separate plate -- I guess we were supposed to share it, though the quantity was really just enough for one normal person.

The flavor of my food was good, and my friend loved his meal (living in the mid-west, he admitted that he can't find decent Mexican food near his home). However I left the place hungry.     I don't know how much the bill was as my friend paid it as a business expense, but the quantity of food was poor and I will avoid this place in the future, going to numerous other Mexican places in the area that are better deals.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,2,squZ_A7Mncz0Lv6_Ys2DPg

Hi, let me preface this by saying there are a lot of things I truly enjoy about your restaurant. The margaritas are divine, the chips and salsa are incredible and the service exquisite. I had eaten here once already and couldn't wait to come back. A friend of mine had informed me of a certain hairy situation that occurred while she was eating here. Despite this, I wanted more of your delicious tacos. I came in Saturday night and had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans on the side. Everything tasted great and there was no incident, until a few hours later when I got home. That's when the fever, chills and vomiting began. The next 24 hours was basically the worst ever. I deducted I became ill as a result of your food, simply by the fact that I ate no where else in the hours leading up to or following my visit. I am not writing on your wall to receive anything for free or to cause a stir, there just isn't any other form of contact I can find. I only ask that you and your team review your cleanliness, preparation and food safety procedures so this does not happen to other diners.

She offered us chips and salsa right off the bat - the chips were thick, crunchy and delicious.  The salsa was pretty good.  I had the carnitas tacos which were yummy.

Food in Spanish is Comida. Yep, they have food. Good thing they didn't name the place Excelente Comida...then you would have a case of false advertising. I really loved everything about this place but the food. The interior has an old world feel about it. One of my partners in crime said "" boy, they sure spent a lot of money to make this place look old"". The feel of the room is well appointed with oldish Mexican decorations and art. Nice job on the leather covered plastic lawn furniture I suppose. The music mix crosses musical genres, it's hip without being trendy even mashing some Hispanic influenced sounds with more predominately English sounds. I see mixed reviews with the service, we were very well taken care of on that front. Servers were excellent! Chips were decent and plentiful, salsa, while offering some complexity, sorely lacked heat. I was there with 2 other friends, got to sample their dishes as well as mine. Everything, and I mean everything was just OK. 8 bucks for an ear of street corn, kind of left me with the feeling of being corn cob fucked in the culo...and that was my favorite item of the day. $5+ dollars for a street taco..a bland one at that.  REALLY? One friend got some kind of (1/2 or 1/4 chicken dish that was nice...AND bland.  Listen, I don't mind dropping mas pesos for a meal, but if your not rockin' my world, then I won't be returning to yours.  At this price point, and only 1 short mile away, lies the delectable Mexican delights that is Mundo. A mile away in distance, but a world a part in flavor. Yes the name of this place is La Comida...and yes they DO have that--food. There are Wayyyyy too many REALLY GOOD Mexican mom and pop choices close by for me to waste my time here. I suspect La Comida will be a success. Plenty of folks are perfectly happy with dumbed downed Mexican fare in a well done atmosphere with $20 Margaritas. If just wanting food, I would rather walk 7 minutes to grab the excellent $1.50 pork on a spit street tacos from the little stand at LVB and Bonanza.

Before we even walked in I was surprised with REALLY loud music causing our 18 month old to wake up from his nap. We were seated at a table tight by the kitchen,  I don't mind it, I don't feel like we were being picked on but the restaurant only had like 2 other tables inside and I just think we could've been seated not right by the kitchen. I had the prickly pear margarita I thought it was good, not too sweet, but yet again not great. My husband had some beer, can't recall which one. To start off we ordered a queso fundido to share.  I ordered the shrimp enchiladas, and my husband ordered a Mexican street burger. When our queso fundido arrived I got excited I love queso fundido. Love chorizo and cheese! But...NOPE. I started eating it with tortilla and I noticed that the cheese wasn't even melted. It was still not cooked. I got pretty grossed out. It didn't have that melt effect that it's supposed to have. I waited for our server to come by to inform them of this. By that time the food runner had dropped off our entrees. My enchiladas were good, not great just okay. The tomatillo sauce was a little over acidic. My husband's burger was good, but not really authentic to Mexican street burgers.. we asked the food runner to call the server. We told her about the queso fundido and how it wasn't done cooking yet. And she made it seem like we were being inconvenient. Like we were doing it on purpose. She said she would let her manager know, and SIMPLY left the dish on the table.

**I  work on the strip in the f & b industry and we all know this is the number 1 no-no, if a guest doesn't like something or its not right you take it away immediately not let it sit there in front of their faces.  And you offer to replace it with something else.. 

Our server did not do this. I got pretty annoyed, seriously?   So we ignored the fact that we had an uncooked dish at our table and kept eating.. by the time the manager came back to check on us we had finished our entrees,  she asked if we wanted a different appetizer.. NO I finished my entrée already I don't think I want to start my dinner all over again. She then let us know she would take it off the check. She could have done so without putting it in our face.  We didn't have more than 2 bites of the dish and we are not one of those people to eat more than half of the food and then complain.
-This was the first time I have ever sent any food back, EVER. 

To wrap it up, food was okay.. No great customer service. Also speciality margarita prices were a little pricey, strip prices to top shelf are equal or else for a specialty drink. 

I also did not appreciate the goofy food runner, acting like a 12 year old eating snacks by the side of the kitchen where we could clearly see him. Not professional at all! Not sure if the health department would appreciate this either.

Everyone loves the cocktails and the bartender KNOWS his tequilas.  I've never really sat down for serious eating here until two days ago.  I waited 48 hours to write this and I still can't shake feeling ripped off.  

I generally shrug off service issues.  La Comida is a hip place in a currently hip part of town.  I'm not there for Zagat rated service.  But in a restaurant a quarter full, we shouldn't have had to wait 10 minutes for a server. This set the stage. We asked about any specials, but the server told us they are listed on the menu. I then pointed out those were SPECIALTIES, do they have any daily specials? I then told him in Spanish. He got it, laughed and said no.  Pretty matter of fact, but on top of a ten minute wait, not appreciated.
 
I ordered the shrimp ceviche. My date the chicken burrito.  My ""dinner"" came back a little cup of miniature shrimp, no bigger than a dime, on top of some diced fruits and avocado. It looked and tasted like half of the serving you get in a 99 cent shrimp cocktail in sundae glass up the block the California Hotel on Fremont Street.  Worse? It tasted like it! I couldn't believe it. The way it was described by the waiter, it seemed it would at least be in league with similar restaurants.  This couldn't even hold a candle to Applebee's.  This dish was $12 and it couldn't have cost them more than a quarter to make.  I was livid, but on a date, so just smiled....and drank my warm Modelo.

My date fared better. The chicken burrito had a chewy tortilla wrap, but the chicken was good and somewhat ample.  It was also kind of pricy at 12 bucks, but could tolerate it because was more than a cup of miniature brine shrimp at the same price. My date's Modelo was also warm (but we were told they were supposed to be like that by the waiter. OLE')

Bottom line...this is a destination restaurant more for taking selfies with drinks in hand than actually eating food.  I don't think the owners, Jenna and Michael Morton, who are renowned for creating dining experiences, are probably even privy to this kind of spotty food and service going on.  I'm hoping they are not.  But if it's really good food you want for the money, I'd say have a drink here first and move on.",EwoyFK9MhuYZ4__2LAVHMg,0,0,2,6f3zlarOznvmPBl3ouFu7w

So we settled on La Comida, right before our production @ the Smith's Center. And we came the first Sunday they were open, manager said it was actually pretty good business. So note to self: OPEN on SUNDAY FUNDAYS! 

Gerardo was our server and he was super helpful, hospitable, and patient with all of our annoying requests hahah poor guy! He made great recommendations, we tried pretty much everything he recommended. The Prickly Pear margarita and the Tamarind marg were pretty bomb.com + nice and strong! Our food was pretty good too.... I asked for vegetarian options and he brought me a separate menu. He recommended the Queso Fresco tacos for me and I'm not a huge cheese person at all but I really enjoyed these tacos, added avocado of course-- our meals came with family style rice + refried beans too, which were prob not vegetarian haha. 

We had to take off because of our show but I want to come back and do dessert! I saw they have plantains I think? I'm a sucker for some goooood platanos so I hope so!

If you are looking for spicy salsa order the Roma Habanero salsa. I had the burrito con pollo and the burrito with steak the two times we went and it was so delicious plus I loved the ranchero salsa they topped the burrito with. My husband had the torta the first time we went and it was amazing. Maybe a little more Cuban than Mexican because of the jam but still one of the best I have ever had and came with homemade potato chips absolutely to die for. The second time we went he had the nachos linkable and the chips were thick and baked to perfection so they did not get soggy. The cheese and sauce the chicken. Was cooked in was also fabulous. We did not have any of the drinks however what we saw they looked amazing and I definitely will have to.go try a prickly pear margarita before we head back home.

The margaritas, especially the guava margaritas, are incredible. The shrimp tacos are definitely my favorite item on the menu. The flautas are very good. The guacamole here is made fresh and is absolutely delicious. What I really like about this place is that not only is the food really good, but it is served in small portion sizes that actually fill you up pretty quickly. This allows you to only order one or two plates per person and be able to share it with the table.

My boyfriend and I went last night for date night.

The price is what I would expect at a this kind of place but the food was not.  The chips and salsa were great but the two entrees we got were sooooo bland.

Our server was great, she even offered to take one of the entrees off the bill.  Which I think is super cool because I assumed we would just pay for them and be unhappy.

5492662,2016-04-05,2,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"THEY STOLE FROM ME! DOUBLE CHARGE!!! I used to come here minimum 1 a week . Not ever again. We came in we sat down and this quirky girl came to take our order. We just wanted water and she just wouldn't have it she kept trying to force things down our throat. She said ""you come just for water?"" Then when we would get a drink she would say, "" oh that one isn't good, try this one."" Obviously she would pick the most expensive things to shove down our throats. I know upsale-ing is part of the job but not when she insults our choices. 

She finally uncomfortably made some of us go with her choice just so she can leave us alone. 
She forgot some of the drinks, we wanted regular cheese dip and brought us a weird type of cheese mixture when she said it was normal cheese. Again to trick us.  
She brought our check. 
I was almost tricked into leaving double tip!!!!. 
I saw my bill and there was a large tip sum added without my consent. I asked her what this charge was she said it was that way because it was a group. 
But no where were we told she said she couldn't tell me how they came up with this number. 
Then she said it was automatic 15%. I was upset at this point. She kept trying to bully everyone into buying things, insulted our choices, forgot some of our order and was tricking us into leaving extra tip. 

I asked to speak to the manager  she came, very rudely said that she would remove the tip. But after confirming the tip was not 15% but 18 and that the other waitress was new and didn't know. 

Saying if I don't want to leave tip it's fine but that it's always added when it's a group as a curtesy , but that she would take it off because I don't want to leave a tip. What kind of manager is this?! So damn rude. Kept repeating and saying it out loud that I didn't want to leave a tip. 

Which was not true, I always leave a tip but not when they are tricking me in to giving 18% and extra. 

So my bill was 38 she said she was going to refund and charge me only that not the 18% 

So she did, we went home and saw my bank account and only 1 charge of....$83.20 !!!!! Where did this 83 come from? 
I was charged a little over double. !!!! 

I immediately called her. As supposedly the manager reversed the first payment and not charged again so I should have two payments on there but I only have one. 

She assured me there was only one charge and that the bank hasn't released it back to me. She also said that she would send me an email receipt. This all happened this past Sunday . It is now Tuesday and I am still waiting for that email. And my money back. 


I I'll never be coming back and neither will any one I know. So disappointed .

On both visits, my man and I sat at the bar with Johnny taking care of us.  Johnny is a great bartender (one of the best in Vegas in my opinion) and is always good for a funny or interesting story.  He makes everyone at his bar feel at home, whether he has known them for years or has just met them.

Who goes to a Mexican restaurant without ordering a margarita?  Definitely not this girl!  My favorite is the prickly pear and my man loves the guava, but we still have several that we haven't tried yet, just one of many reasons we will be back again soon.

Now on to the food, the obligatory chips and salsa are a great start to the meal, the chips not too greasy, the salsa not too chunky or too runny.  Personally, I would prefer a bit more heat, but the flavor is good.  The shrimp ceviche is served in a green chile sauce that has quite the kick to it.  It comes with crispy plantain chips that are beyond addicting.  My man and I loved this dish so much the first time that we had to order it again on our second visit, and it definitely did not disappoint.

Covering both visits, for entrees we had the shrimp tacos, carnitas tacos, skirt steak, and red snapper.  Everything I had was absolutely delicious, although I did not get a chance to try the carnitas tacos.  My boyfriend loved them so much he had already inhaled them before I had a chance to ask for a taste haha!

Lastly, I cannot end this review without talking about the tres leches cake.  This is one of my favorite desserts and La Comida's was absolutely to die for!  It was moist and creamy (but not soggy) with flavors of vanilla bean, cinnamon, maybe nutmeg, just all around delicious.

Mel C. and I were lucky enough to attend the invite-only/soft opening with our amigo Cisco, so I will preface this review by stating that it was definitely not the typical dining experience.  It was a first for me to meet Jenna and Michael Morton, the owners of La Comida, and part of the Morton dynasty - not typical.  I think every employee of La Comida was working last night and the place was bustling with all the excitement and, most likely, nerves that accompany opening a new and much-anticipated hot spot.  There were many Las Vegas celebs and higher-ups there, but I only recognized a few.  What stood out for me was the food and the ambiance.

I had:
La Catrina margarita:  ""Cabrito tequila infused with strawberries, Combier, guava and limes""--so tasty and sweet, but not overly sweet, just the way I like my alcohol when I do drink.  I don't want to taste the alcohol.
Chips and salsa:  The salsa had a little kick, but not too spicy.
Guacamole:  Fresh!
Camaron del Golfo:  ""Gulf shrimp, butternut squash, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, crema de Guajillo""- 3 big grilled shrimp with the other ingredients as a side medley--it was delicious.
Platanos Fritos:  3 fried plantains with vanilla ice cream--a sweet ending to a big meal.

It's exciting to have La Comida in DTLV, making Fremont East an even cooler place to hang out.  Word is that official opening is Thursday, April 25th, so check it out for yourselves--I will definitely be back, too.

Upon asking for the check, I waited for 20 minutes for the waiter to bring it. They also forgot (completely) the chile verde tacos to go. So I waited an additional 30 minutes for them to make the tacos - again, 2 VERY SMALL street tacos for approximately $10.

I really like the decor as well as the staff at La Comida. Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: ""if you think it's salty, it must have been really salty"". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I'm not the only one in the group that didn't think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were ""meh"" and the Guacamole dip was even more ""meh"".  

I don't feel the food is worthy of what they charge so I think you should leave it for the tourist and hit Tacos El Gordo or Don Jaun.",e2LtHijFAXy4RNTDL5IELw,1,0,2,RGDdtyW-TYxd51jMNXN51A
5674895,2014-01-09,3,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"After having such a stellar time at the YEE awhile back, I had been wanting to go back to La Comida for dinner.

I was early to meeting some friends downtown and decided to pop in (on a Saturday night) for a quick beer and food.

I sat at the bar, and although it wasn't busy, the bartender was running around like a chicken with her head cut off.  She seemed put off when I wanted to see a menu, and once I received it, it took another 15 minutes to order.

I just decided to have a beer and order some guacamole, since I wasn't sure when my friends would arrive and knew it would be quick.  I was never offered chips and salsa, although there were 2 order sitting on the bar near me.  When I asked if I may have some, the bartender said ""oh, sure. These people never touched them, they sat at a table right away.""  Now, that is kind of gross - how do I know if they touched them?  And she was so ""busy,"" I am not certain she knew either.

The guacamole came out fairly quickly, and I asked for extra chips as well (fresh).

Everything was fine.  The decor is cute and it is a small place.  For as high as their prices are, you'd think they would focus on providing stellar service so diners feel like they are getting their monies worth.  I mean, the margaritas are the smallest things I've ever seen (I honestly thought we received a mini version at the event, but that is the true size!).  At $15 or so, that is crazy!!

The next morning, I believe I had some ""Montezuma's Revenge,"" for lack of better terms.  It had to be something in that guac, because that was the ONLY thing I had eaten all day on Saturday.

I just don't spend a lot of time Downtown, but was looking forward to liking this place.  Unfortunately, I left disappointed and definitely would never go out of my way to return.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,7,3,2,_v3RYV1z6w81TgRoM_Rl7A

Love the ambiance and decor but the food is simply meh.  Think Chevy's meets Vanguard Lounge...except I can at least think of a couple dishes at Chevy's I like.

I came here with several friends and one asked the server for nachos. The entertainment went as follows:
Her: Can I please have nachos?
Server: We don't have nachos
Her: Do you have chicken, tortilla chips, salsa, cheese, beans, guacamole, and sour cream.
Server: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.
Her: Then you have nachos.
Server: Sorry we do not serve nachos, this restaurant is authentic mexican.
Her: [pout face]

She then proceeded to order each individual item as a side and dumped them on her plate and made...yup nachos. So yeeeahhh, if it's not considered ""authentic"" I get if it's not on the menu but if you have the ingredients what's so hard about accommodating a guests request? She didn't ask someone to go slice up some beef stomach and make menudo. I guarantee it took more energy to individually prepare and serve those items, then to just dump them on a pile of chips. I don't get it, anyway, rant over. 

The food is subpar and considering that there are multiple ""authentic"" Mexican restaurants within a two mile radius, this place would only be good for a quick drink.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,5,0,2,Q-sKkgUQJBmOxscKz0ZKdA

For restaurants, I usually wait to review after I have been there a couple times to make sure it's consistent and certainly this place has always been.

Located next to Common Wealth and near the container park, La Comida offers some great drinks, which are served in mason jars as well as great Mexican food. There many dishes are always great and seem to be just the right amount of size as not leave feeling stuffed like a jalapeno about ready to pop like some Mexican places.

The restaurant hosts a full bar and sitting bar top area as well as many tables with some booth type feeling on the end/wall. There is also patio seating available. Decor is pretty great in lots of Mexican style skulls and typical Mexican themes. 

Services has also been on point and not left looking for a waiter/waitress to get something, they always seem to be right there when you need something. Sure there has been some busy times and it takes just a minute or two longer but they certainly go all out to make sure youre taken care of.

Also, It seemed like some sort of big shot from the restaurant came to greet the people sitting in front of us and ignored what was going on at our table.

Chicken Tortilla soup, nice and creamy with large chunks of shredded chicken, good spice level with a very rich taste, good size bowl with more than enough for two to share. 
Carnitas Tacos, were small but filling, 3 per plate with nice little chunks of pork goodness.
Chicken Enchiladas, two large  enchiladas per plate, very large and filling, red sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste but adding some of the salsa made them very tasty.

Although he was busy, he made sure to explain the food items and make suggestions.  To our surprise, the manager comped us our first round of drinks and their house made guacamole!

I won't make this long and drawn out but besides waiting for a bit in the beginning, our first experience at La Comida was a good one.  The pozole was fanastic (especially with the guacamole in it,) as was the street corn appetizer!

We recently decided to check out La Comida. Our friends who had been there before had different experiences, so we weren't quite sure what to expect. Luckily, it turned out to be a great idea to visit La Comida. 

First of all the interior is really cool, with the big bar and the high ceilings and open room. The booths next to the end walls are nice to sit in, but the tables in the middle are fine too. 

As per usual the chips and salsa was complimentary, and it was very mouthwatering. Since it was our first time at La Comida, we asked our friendly waiter (sporting an awesome beard) what he recommended. He suggested the Puerco Ahumado (mesquite smoked pork shoulder) and Camaron Del Golfo (Gulf shrimp and butternut squash), and neither of them disappointed us.

La Comida also has a great selection of tequilas, and a wide range of different Margaritas. In other words a great place to start the night if you're planning on going out Downtown - or for a nice date night.",K2ZoDG-9QAi5ErTAVRW8pg,2,0,4,DONx2xzOjB_7hdXzF3kI4Q

We got the carne asada; it was way overcooked/tough, and the house salsa was about as inspiring as Pace. The trio of salsas app is $7 and includes a ""hot"" one (which really isn't, but regardless, the flavor isn't that impressive either and doesn't differ much from the house salsa), a tomatillo (which is a bit unnecessarily sweet), and one made with avocado which was really quite nice. We also ordered the pozole, which was unlike (and fell short of pretending to be) any pozole that either of us have had in Mexico or New Mexico. The broth was decently tasty at the end once we'd already added in enough salt from all of the chips we dunked in it in the beginning, trying to improve the flavor. Then you need to take into account the ~$13-15 tiny margaritas and $7 XX beer (even the PBR is $5), which then convinces you that you definitely should have gone elsewhere. Well, unless you really like being jostled by people's asses brushing against your dome every few mins; then definitely go and ask to be seated at the one doesn't-belong table nearest both the door and the bar, where everyone is trying to get by. On the plus side, the waitress was very nice, but took forever to come back each time, which, to be fair, is probably because this place just opened and is still working out the kinks. I'd give them another chance in a month or two, but the prices just aren't worth it.

5933005,2016-04-14,1,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"The customer service of this ""restaurant"" needs some MAJOR improvement. The place was 1/4 occupied so we figured we would receive great customer service and our food fast, WRONG!!! They asked us if we wanted to order some margaritas and I said of course, I asked for a ""strawberry margarita"" and they said they don't make those. Are you freaking kidding me? A 'so called' Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve strawberry margaritas? 

        I'm a Mexican-American, so I know what Mexican food taste like, this was certainly not it. Perhaps a step up from taco bell, but hardly any flavor. If you don't care for true mexican food then this place is probably for you, but if you know what that real stuff taste like, the you probably want to skip this place. The waiter was just terrible, never came by our table too see how we were doing. Additionally we had to flag him down and ask for water, and he simply never came back. We had to get the host to ask for the bill and it had to take me getting up to ask her again to get it. The food took 20 minutes to get out to us with hardly anyone in the restaurant. It's too bad because the place looks nice, they just need to get the owner to take do something about it, I don't see this place being a long term establishing in Vegas.",6UAMmtOI_dMgVAoJh29S6w,0,0,2,oJJniT03Y4JhX8dF6HvVMw

We had the same bartender as last review - which is welcoming in transient Las Vegas! Had the queso fundido and carne asada salad. OMG on the carne asada salad - definitely would order that again. Queso fundido is quite good - it's a really rich dish. I think it would be better with more people so can share and be satisfied with only a small taste. We shall return!

We showed up on a Friday night with no reservation to find a packed house, but we managed to get seated within a few minutes. The atmosphere's really neat-- cool Latin decor, intimate lighting, and hip music. The staff was super friendly, too. Shout out to Frank! You definitely helped make the night!

We ordered an array of things, but we probably could have been gotten away with just eating the complimentary chips and salsa. My friends all ordered different margaritas, and they were raving about the variety of options and the unique flavors that were offered. The food hit the spot, too, and was a reasonable price. It was nice getting away from the ritzy (new) Vegas strip. If I ever found myself back in Las Vegas, I would definitely go again.",u4Uytt-ZlbAZPvXdiGvHHQ,0,0,5,mEpamMc1zPJYAAJJAJ6V9w

We are local n I don't think we'll come back. We have recently exploring downtown and trying out restaurants. Carson cafe was really bad, and now this. So far Mingo is the best one. Been there twice already and both times were very satisfying.",ftttLxXB10LtHJ7v0j2hDA,1,0,3,m48x6vxreMGjwSyPoIZh8Q

The place is well run by an excellent general manager named Rafael. The professional that served my table gave great suggestions on what to try (the shaved elotes was NICE!) and the energy of the place was strong. We found this place on our way to another restaurant and decided to take a detour. Glad we did.,EZhho_G8OxzYKVgJVtMYFw,0,0,4,2_iDg2OkCdQWM54ngXUCOA

5987739,2015-04-16,0,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Was totally surprised by this place - in a very good way.  A couple Vegas residents proposed this place in between nights of meals at Carnevino and Raku and my skepticism at a downtown Vegas Mexican joint began melting away right as we entered the first courtyard leading in.  

The building/décor is spot on.  Perfect.  Ambience is top notch.  Outdoor seating, casual yet sophisticated take on traditional Mexican flavors.  Good drink list heavy on tequila and the jefe margarita was the best I've ever had.

Ordered the guacamole, which was chunky, flavorful and one of the best iterations I've had.  Queso fundido was a winner as well although if you're torn between the two - go guac.  Had the gambas (shrimp) on an intensely flavorful bed of squash, chorizo and tomatoes which had everything I want in a dish.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Also sampled the tuna tostada which, while quite good, could have stood for a little more seasoning.

Service was friendly but slow.

All told, I felt a strong connection with downtown Vegas in general (check out the container park - hours of drinking fun) and this is a fantastic alternative to the glitz and glamour of the strip, with relatively subdued pricing to match.",SzANwTg5VIfUQW2t5ru6SA,0,2,4,5WFd6ACA8KG0uOv1_7TYPw
5992835,2017-03-26,2,ID5wWJ9C7G0hfbQilvlfxA,"Admittedly, my friends and I were trying to go another place that didn't have room, so we ended up at La Comida for a quick dinner.

I love the wood paneling and decor. And where have you last seen a swing at a bar?

I started with the Siempre Caliente margarita ($12), which included passion fruit and hot sauce. It was tasty, and I liked the kick.

My husband got the Camaron Al Maya tacos, which had shrimp, cabbage, mango, jalapeno cream, and hot salsa ($13). It was definitely my favorite thing at the table; the sweet and salty were nicely balanced, and the shrimp was cooked well. I got the sea bass frito a la baja tacos. They just weren't as flavorful or balanced. 

This spot definitely seems like a good place for a group and chill gathering.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,4,3,3,VpcQVIH_LEhSwXlDt8skBg
