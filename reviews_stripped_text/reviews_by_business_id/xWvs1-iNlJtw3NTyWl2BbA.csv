Tinoco's is a local Vegas institution.  Enrique Tinoco has had restaurants around vegas for over 15 years and they've all had a cult following.  The menu is inventive, fresh, varied and more than fairly priced.  There's also a full bar and a great wine list.  For brunch I would recommend the Eggs Chesapeake, poached eggs over delicious house made crab cakes with a red bell pepper sauce.  It's inspired.  For dinner I tried the cream of asparagus soup, which had the texture of silk and amazing flavor.  I also had the David Love's It, risotto with jumbo scallops and shrimp in a lemon butter sauce.  It was perfectly cooked risotto and seafood in a beautifully balanced lemon butter sauce.  I love being able to rave about a great local place.  You should definitely check it out!",aJvNNSBbbaZYAlKGnOXiSQ,1,1,5,msV1d8H1JjySUPCe3-q-Ng

I went with a friend who had been to their previous location and spoke highly of the food so we were determined to find it.

The waitstaff was extremely helpful with both knowledge of the menu and with wine suggestions.  Our waitress, a lovely little woman who could pass for your favorite great-aunt, even let my friend order off the menu saying ""tell us what you want and if we have it, we'll make it for you.""

DÃ©cor-wise it's nothing special, being in the bowels of an older hotel/casino means there are no windows and not much to look at, but the friendliness of the staff and some nice banquettes in the dining room more than make up for the lack of flashy interior design.  

Besides, it's about the food, which is really good.  On my completely arbitrary scale of 1-1000, I give it a solid 838 stars.",QoHFdySn4K85_aLsgyWUEA,0,1,4,dU9n3aC8WAZDgDi5f-cWXg

It is in a Historic Landmark Restaurant in the Las Vegas Club Hotel, serving delicious Italian Pastas, traditional Steaks, and Fresh Seafood: Something on the Menu for Everyone.

Come here for the Authentic Vegas Experience. The Downtown location with an Uptown Vibe. The food is mouthwatering as Chef Tinoco has over 24 years experience pleasing palates around the planet.

What we personally like the most, aside from the way too hip art on the walls as well as the tables, is that a fabulous salad or soup comes free with every entree - in such a portion that would have been Fine as a Stand Alone meal In Itself.
Plus the Desserts are Divine and one is big enough to share with three people.

Came here for our anniversary to have dinner and was hesitant because the majority of people who came here complain about the service, but when we went, the service was great! There was one lady working and she was super nice and made us a dipping sauce for the complimentary bread and when our food came out she also made us a hot sauce that she usually makes for the chef for his lunch. Lol. We got the crab stuffed shrimp and the lobster ravioli. This place has honestly been by far the best place i've eaten in Las Vegas. The portions seem pretty small when your plate comes out, but to our surprise, it is so filling! We barely finished our food. You have to come try this place, it's amazing!

Oh and there's a lobster claw machine outside of the restaurant. The boyfriend was so set on winning one, he wasted $20 trying. With that $20 he could've just ordered a lobster. Game is addicting because sometimes you get so close to winning one, but make sure you don't play too much. Waste of money!",fGs3rR1X1JdgmuqMaLV4gg,1,1,5,WLFa1Dsva8Jr0kdI_Eri5w

Nachos - They have the supermarket bagged nachos, similar to the tostitos, with a nacho cheese on top, and jalapeno's. It was good but nothing you couldn't make at home, it was a little bit overpriced at 3.75.

Mexican plate special - This is a trip. You get an enchilada, soft taco, beans and rice for 4.50. It's a trip because I was watching her make this. The enchilada was pulled out of the cooler and popped in the microwave. While she was preparing the taco, after the enchilada was finished, she popped the taco into the microwave. Then she scooped rice and beans from a steam table. I had my doubts about this one but once I tasted it, it was ok. The food seemed fresh and perfectly seasoned. The rice was a bit overcooked for me, but it wasn't bad. I think for the price you'd be better off across the street at Dupar's or if you can drive, go over to Tacos el Gordo.

We stopped by here around noon to have some brunch on a Saturday. The Las Vegas Club is like a maze inside, so it was a little difficult locating Tinoco's.

We ordered cornbeef hash and eggs and Portuguese sausages and eggs. My cornbeef hash and eggs smelled kind of funky, but they were okay. The sausages were a bit burnt.

2869930,2010-03-15,0,xWvs1-iNlJtw3NTyWl2BbA,"I have been a customer of Tinoco's since he first opened up on East Charleston, connected to a muffler shop (Lenadams Dorris recommended Tinoco's in Citylife in the late 90's, and it was an excellent recommendation).  Since then, I have eaten at his locations (all now closed) on Warm Springs and The Arts Factory.

A few incontrovertable truths about dining at Tinoco's to date.  You will always get well prepared food.  The service will always be friendly (I think many staff are family and friends).  He will always have his signature dishes available, prepared well (Sea Bass with potatoes and spinach, Pasta with blackened shrimp, red pepper sauce and peas, and excellent house salad with bleu cheese and candied pecans, pesto rolls, etc...)  His restaurants continue to be a good value based on the quality of food served.

The Las Vegas Club locations is very good, menu has been expanded a bit (although I am still not a fan of the 'pallete' tables brought over from the Arts Factory - odd shape, wobbly, depressions for condiments are distracting - but a minor detail).  My favorite location remains the now gone original on East Charleston - the notion of this undiscovered gem and such good, simple, well prepared food and good service being offered in this modest location made it special, as it exceeded all expectations.

Tinoco and his team, in my assessment, are valued local restauranteurs who have tried many locations in serving the Southern Nevada community.  I applaud his efforts, quality consistency and value.",Oixv0VgElz8pxQFp2lkdJg,0,1,4,ZqLCRQvnLcSq48vPMBAbbg

I had seen the signs, but it didn't register in my mind that it was actually in the casino. I live here and I know of it's location in the Arts Factory on West Charleston. I saw an article in the Weekly on how they relocated. So I went back to partake.

Same family, same, if not better, quality in their moved location. They do get better exposure on Fremont Street. and it dies bring local flavor, at least to Fremont street. If you have read me before, Fremont Street IS Vegas proper and township. 

I'm going to write about what I had, which I'm always torn about in reading restaurant reviews. what if you don't like what the reviewer ordered, would you still go? I got chicken Parm, but what if you're a vegetarian? What if you want a good Philly? They have plenty of other entrees, let me link their page.... http://www.tinocoskitchen.com/

Parking is in the lot down Fremont Street. It is charged by the hour and I think it cost us $5 total, which includes walking down the Fremont strip, eating, and walking back and looking at everything.
Service was friendly. Small place to eat... hidden away inside a hotel. Food slightly overpriced, but oh well. I love my lobster raviloli, which came with grilled shrimp on the side. The corn chowder and shrimp pasta in garlic sauce was good too. 

The owner's wife (I'm assuming) came over to ask us how we were doing and we ended up talking to her. When she found out we were celebrating an anniversary, she gave us free slices of cheesecake, which was only okay due to the caramel swirl. 

Overall, good service, good food. I don't know how the bill came out since I didn't pay, but I'm assuming it was about $20 per person.",ZBbONms0uMqWS-lDqPYmsw,0,0,4,5XqRcX0nXtb_mlYDWc3D7Q

Having given up hope that is ever a decent affordable meal in LV I found Tinoco's and made the plunge.  I mean Really?  A lobster Claw machine for $2 and then they make it for you at no additional cost!  You have to be kidding me.  So it was about 10pmand we wandered over to give it a shot.

The Casino Lobby is so scary you almsot don't want to even give the place a chance.  But I held my Girl close and we made our way to the back.  Once you get past the casino floor things get a little bit nicer.  And the entrance to the restaurant reminds me of a movie style Mob restaurant.  But with WAY nice people to greet you.  The front bar is quant and once inside the HUGE booths seemed to be upholstered in an ostrich type of material.  I fell in love right there.  

Well, we were the only ones in the joint and quickly decided that the must be closing.  Liz our waitress came up and said there was no rush even though we felt we must.  She told us the specials and we went for the Steak and Shrimp Scampi on mashed potatoes with veggies.  took the Broccoli soup and got the crab cakes appetizer. 
Crab cakes were amazing,  very fresh and on a  bed of tasty salad like veggies.  the Red peper sauce was fantastic.

The Broccoli soup was out of this world,  We could make a meal out of just that.

The steak was not the best i had ever had,  but it was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were not over cooked as well,  thats a big plus!  The Sauce was delicious and so were the veggies.  

The service was impeccable as well.  So for us it was no hard decision to return there for breakfast.

A group of us girls sought this place out because of the great yelp reviews.  We were thinking, steak, seafood, pasta, this place could please everyone.  So, our hopes were high.  When we sat down we waited quite a bit.  Finally an older lady came over to our table, we ordered wine and she cracked some jokes.  Okay, a little unpleasant but whatever.  Then we waited... and waited... about 20 minutes and our wine was nowhere to be seen.  What was worse was that we observed her yucking it up with all the other patrons in the place and deliberately avoiding our table.  Was it because we were a solid 20 years younger than any of the other patrons?  We were confused.  Finally, the hostess?!? stopped by our table to ask if everything was okay.  We said, no, we never got our wine.  She looked unsurprised and went and poured our wine.  5 minutes later (so we are talking about 30 minutes after sitting down) we had wine.  At that point the waitress really avoided us.  Another waiter brought our food. Then we were ready for the bill.  Oh yeah, the old lady came by once half way through the meal and asked if everything was okay.  What the hell?  We were confused and not the least bit amused.  I said, ""we have been taken care of"".  Then she is gone again.  When it was time to get the check the hostess came by.  We asked to split checks and she said okay, but she really had no idea what we ordered (remember she was the hostess, not our waitress!), so that led to about 2 mistakes before she got the checks right.  When the checks were finally right, guess who brought them to the table... the waitress.  Ah, so she found time to come to our table when it was time to pay.  Dare I mention that I stiffed this waitress her tip?  I have done that exactly twice in my life and the other time was when a waitress was obviously tripping on mushrooms and was about as space cadet as you can get.  On the way out, we handed some money to the hostess and asked her to please keep it and not share it with the waitress.  
Oh yeah, the food.  Actually, my friend had the best Filet Mignon that I have had in a long time.  My scallops and shrimp were pretty good too.  The pasta was less impressive.
