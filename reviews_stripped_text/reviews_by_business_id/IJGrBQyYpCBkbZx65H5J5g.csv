I love their fish taco's! The fish is Pollock that has been dipped in a beer batter and fried to perfection. I don't find it too oily at all. You can pick between corn or flour tortillas, I chose corn. The original is topped with cabbage, salsa and some white sauce.. cheese maybe? Not too sure what it is, but it is delicious! The Especial comes with gaucamole, onions & cilantro and cheese. The plate comes with a side of their ""no fried"" beans and chips. I changed out the beans for their side of rice. I found these sides to be kind of small in servings. My boyfriend added a side rice to his and it was only $.50, but it was small. You can also switch it out with black beans as well.

I found the establishment to be very clean. They have a salsa bar near the fountain drinks. They have 4 different salsas. Salsa verde, picante, mild salsa, and chipotle. They also had an onion/cilantro mixture, and of course pickled peppers & carrots (like robertos!)

Service is quick and they are very helpful. 

I haven't tried anything else yet, because I really like their world's famous fish tacos.. but they also have mahi and chili lime salmon and shrimp. They also have chicken and beef for all you non-seafood lovers out there. Their food is very fresh and their tortillas are pretty awesome too!",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,1,0,4,6ZScSa2hhBi2_ui6UVq81A

However, this location my husband and I have been to 4 times and EVERY VISIT they have MESSED up the order!  The good thing is they are apologetic and remake it, but this last time they messed it up even after taking it back.  

The receipt will say the right thing, but the person actually making the food will do different.  1. Did flour instead of corn tortillas 2. Putting on sauces that we asked for not to be on the food 3. Chicken instead of steak. 

The food is good, and they were nice, and sorry for their mistakes, but the time & wait is not worth it. We will not return to this location, but will go to other locations.",SNyDeFU-9t-zxK0PHnTrZw,5,1,2,cuLOoAXRQPtsnap202T4yQ

They specialize in fish tacos but every taco I've tried has been packed with flavor and vibrance. Their shrimp tacos are packed with juicy, lightly charred shrimp and a delicious creamy Baja style sauce. The verde shrimp tacos come with ripe buttery slices of avocado and the verde sauce adds a citrusy fresh note that really is something I could eat everyday. Their pride and joy, the fish taco was lightly coated in a flavorful, light, mildly airy batter that is a bit greasy but sinfully good.  They also have a special steak taco with bacon and crisped cheese, yum!They're decently priced for quality and offer a nice salsa bar that makes it fun to experiment with adding different tastes from smokey chipotle to classic verde.

Placing the catering order was very simple and easy. You can do it all online - pick out what you want, when you want to pick it up, etc. (And you can arrange delivery if you want.) And I appreciated that they called me the day before my scheduled pick-up to confirm the order.

When I walked in to pick up the order, the place itself was actually quite nice for a fast food-type place. And some of the pictures of the fish tacos did have me salivating just a little bit. And the menu did appear to be rather expansive.

As soon as I arrived, I was helped immediately. Once I said ""catering pick-up"", they knew my name, knew I had a gift certificate, had my order all packed up and ready to go, etc.

The packaging was pretty nice. It was all in a nice, reusable tote-type bag. On top was a box of utensils, napkins, and plates. And nothing I ordered spilled or leaked or anything.

I ordered two platters - one salad and one quesadilla (mix of some steak and some cheese). Honestly, the quesadillas weren't much to write home about. Good, but nothing different or standout about them - just average. The guacamole that came with them, though, was above average. The salad, while just a salad, was quite tasty. There was plenty of cheese, which I appreciated, and the dressing was deliciously spicy. 

So good service and good food, but nothing that really pushed me to think of it as more than a-ok. However, I do now intend to go back and try out some of their tacos and other items. And probably get some more of that salad dressing.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,0,3,jy-IBdS5u8vjKXMVhn_ggg

Hey did you get your free burrito?  ""Yes, now leave me alone.  Go away""

I only came here because of the free coupon for the Burrito Especial they're promoting for the Las Vegas Film Festival.  The only other time I've eaten at a Rubio's I had the fish tacos.  I figured I would never return. But....................

Anytime, there's free food you expect the long lines and long wait for your food.  But I must commend the people running this place efficiently for being so busy.  Very well organized and they had portable vibrators so you knew when your order was ready.  

I grew up in San Francisco (Land of the Taquerias) and being a burrito snob and typically despise chains like Chipotle, Baja Fresh and Rubio's so I wasn't expecting much.  But nobody should ever go here because of ""authenticy"".  But as for the burrito itself eeh it was aiight.  The good was that the steak or chicken tasted straight from the grill.  The guacamole tasted fresh and not like the kind that's processed in a plastic container.  But is it $8 good?  That's debatable depending on your standards.  But the good news is I have yet to have an immediate ""closed-door meeting"" today!  Usually bad ""mexican food"" leads to a quick meeting for most people.  

With all that said, I don't see myself returning anytime soon.  I'll stick with my favorite mainstay taquerias that serve my beloved Lengua, Al Pastor and Carnitas options for authenticity.",rqv9mIc9pj9R_b0MIm_fzg,4,1,3,5WORqyeUwEnATaHZ9U7k2Q

One of my favorite things about this place is the salsa bar. They have a salsa verde that I can't get enough of. I always get extra chips to keep snacking. Sometimes I'll get chunky mild salsa to switch it up, but the verde is where it's at.

The fountain machine serves a unique option, vanilla coke, and no this is not one of those all in one coke machines.My main complaint about this chain is that that some of the best items in the menu get taken away... If you have been here before, you might remember a mango habanero version of their tacos and burritos. This is no longer an option.

Don't have me fall in love with an item and just take it away. I know this must have been a corporate decision, but still!!!

Regardless I will be back for $1.50 fish taco Tuesdays. Never forget Taco Tuesdays!",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,1,1,4,R6qUUEouD8B2dW_ka5o5yQ

I was not sure what to expect when we stopped by for $2 Fish Taco Especial last Tuesday. The Original is only $1.75 after 2:30pm.

I had seen on the Yelp app that you can call ahead and place your order. Well, not realizing the time necessary for these wonderful fish tacos to be ready, we just stopped in and placed our order at the register to go. 

The young woman at the register was very pleasant, and made sure that we knew that with the Fish Taco Especial, you get the addition of homemade guacamole, a cheese blend and a mix of cilantro and onion. And a lime wedge! Yes, that is definitely what we wanted. We decided to get 4 since they were such a good price. No way can I eat two of these, but I could always have one for lunch the next day.

We waited for nearly 15 minutes, but when it was our turn we stepped up to the counter and the same young woman who took our order opened up our to-go box and presented us with a view of these tacos. They looked fabulous! Seriously. These were a step above just any fish tacos for sure! I really liked how she showed us the tacos before bagging them up. We were excited to get home and try them. We made sure to get some salsa from the salsa bar and put it in their containers with lids to go. Convenient. 

When we did get home, we realized just how large each piece of fish on these tacos really was. One was PLENTY for me. I am not a big eater, and I was stuffed. 

We plan on trying these out again, but calling our order in this time so we can just stop in and take home our tasty food. There is no drive-thru, but this food is made fresh for each order. Well worth any wait. The parking lot is in the northwest the corner of Eastern and Serene, and is not crazy busy over there.

When it comes to the food, this is one of my failsafe choices...I walk in the door and I know I'm not going to leave disappointed. And then there's the salsa bar...with one smoky, dark, flavor packed salsa that I can't get enough of. If I could buy it in bulk I would...I've never had anything quite like it. 

So why not give them 5 stars? I'm not a fan of their drink choices. Half the time their tea is empty, and their fountain drinks have been flat or off a couple of times. But that's the only flaw I've found after many repeat visits.

They not only made a whole lot of tasty food, everythings was made to order, LABELED, so you knew what you were eating, but also set me up with a box that divedes the utensils, plates and napkins, so they didn't get mixed up.
 They also delivered the food on a cart to my rather tiny car, and the guy CRAWLED in to make sure everything was balanced so it would fall.
 While I was waiting I asked if there was a pond store nearby. The lady behind the counter actually did an Internet search, and gave the directions and address. That;'s customer service. Much better than Pollo Loco, who said they only check their fax once a day and didn't know my order was on there last Inservice.

Be sure to join their birthday club & receive a free entree during your birthday week. Thank you Rubio's!

However, the staff here always seems to be upset or angry. Yesterday I went to claim my free birthday meal, and I asked the cashier a question to make sure I was ordering something covered by the coupon. She rolled her eyes at me, and responded as if I should have known the answer (which I didn't, because I don't frequent Rubio's very much.) Then I told her that since the coupon covered that meal, I would get it. She sighed, and stuck her hand out for my phone so I could give her the coupon.

It was a bit insulting and put a damper on the meal. I am giving it a three star rating because: 1) the ancho citrus shrimp burrito was delicious and 2) the chef who brought me my food was super friendly, and almost made up for the cashier's sour attitude.

Consistently fresh and always tasty with a great menu, Rubio's is pretty much a top notch establishment. This physical location is not the greatest of locations as it's deep in the Eastern corridor of hell, as I refer to it. The promise of yummy tacos with delicious salsa is hard to resist when I'm in the area, however. The wait can be a bit extensive sometimes but I like to say it's worth it for fresh food. Among my faves here are the grilled gourmet tacos with shrimp (mmm bacon) and the salmon burrito. And the Tuesday fish tacos for $1.50 is now $1.75 I believe. This is always a popular deal and it's usually pretty busy.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,2,4,eLmCewNKvDOHw4SICimsDQ
