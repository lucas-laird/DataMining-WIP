Their turkey chili soup was the best one I sampled while I was there. The potato creamy soup did not have enough flavor, did not have a chance to try the cauliflower and cheese. 

Their ice cream is surprisingly thick. Usually, soft serve machines produce watered down ice creams that melt within seconds. Not here. The lemon lava cake is delicious. I was a bit disappointed by the blueberry muffins, maybe it was because the one I got was a bit on the burnt side and was not moist enough.

There used to be one across the street  called soup and salad and it was at least 4 bucks less. There is little to no protein on the salad bar portion of the buffet and the soup is mostly watered down or if it is a creamed soup there is a thick crusty layer on top so I try to pass that  up.

So now I get to write one of those generic liens about how I loved Sweet Tomatoes, despite the fact that I should despise all they stand for and salt the earth beneath them. 

It's true though. I, hater of rabbit food actually enjoyed my visit. The ingredients were crisp, fresh and tasty. This is especially impressive given that I'm in Vegas, aka the enemy of all things crisp, fresh, and tasty, not necessarily in that order.

Not only did were they good, but the ingredients were also plentiful and the choices were many.  Even the ranch was tasty, and usually people mess up ranch. It's either too thick, too thin or just tasteless altogether. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine, actually. Sweet Tomatoes did not leave me peeved, though on the all important ranch issue. 

Aside from the greenery, they featured a varied stock of soups, which are cooked in gigantic pots in the morning. Seriously. I saw into the kitchen. I could probably sit in one of the pots. The soups were also tasty, and well flavored. Not overflavored like many do. Just flavored. 

In general, keeping it simple and plentiful seems to be the entire mantra of Sweet Tomatoes. It works. From the food to the flavoring to the seating arrangements and decorations, it all falls into that line of thinking. In a world of overwork, overhype and overpushing by restaurants, Sweet Tomatoes went the opposite direction and they are all the better for it. 

If you like soup, go here. If you like salad, go here. If you like having prepackaged choices waiting for you...go somewhere else.",yXuvxLICKpUCrM7cg4E2Bw,0,1,4,st9DHz4rs53D5FkaEWZjpA

They also have Mexican or Chinese food and usually piles of fresh cut melons, not to mention a tempting array of desserts. The off-Strip casinos are about the same price as Sweet Tomatoes.

1059410,2014-10-05,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"I've been going to Sweet Tomatoes since before I started Yelping, so there's a long history behind this review.

PROS:
*  Extensive salad bar.  Almost always full.  Prepared mixed saladsare freshly made and refreshed often.  (You can watch the staff make it if you happen to be there when it's happening.)
*  Extensive soup menu.  Despite a review stating three soups, there are either six or seven bain maries for soup (I can't remember exactly).  Soup is always freshly made; never boxed nor canned.  Certain soups are constant, like their Big Chunk Chicken and their Chili; some are seasonal.
*  Fresh pasta (three types) always freshly made.
*  Baked potatoes (and recently added baked sweet potatoes).  Condiment bar right there.
*  Several types of breads and muffins, both sweet and savory.  Butter, margarine and ""honey whip"" available.
*  Staff is pleasant and always helpful.  I have a bad leg and my wife has had back reconstruction; when we walk in with our walking sticks, we are ALWAYS asked if we need assistance taking trays to tables.  Frequent offers to have our drinks refilled instead of us walking to the beverage station.  Empty plates and bowls picked up from the tables on a regular basis.

CONS:
*  Specifically addressing a comment made by another Yelper: sometimes the customers are faster at making a mess than the staff is at cleaning it up.  Splashed dressings (a teaspoon or so of ranch in the French, for example) can't always be resolved with the lines of patrons running through the place.  Also ""mixed vegetables"" (some cabbage in the radishes, for example) ... same concept.  Not everyone has the same accuracy.  Myself included.  As full as they get the bins, I tend to spill a bit of cabbage or a few pieces of mushroom myself.  My apologies to the folks behind me if I don't always get a chance to clean up after myself.

If you don't like serving yourself when you go out to eat (my dear mother, the venerable Mama Hawk, is one such), Sweet Tomatoes may not be for you.  Otherwise, ""come 'n' get it!""  You may just see me and my darling wife there.

This was my first and LAST visit for so many reasons besides the lack of meat.  There was no assistance in directing us on how the restaurant operates. For instance, guests pick up plates and trays as soon as you enter and then you proceed down the single row vegetarian salad bar (which was soaking wet because there was a woman wiping it down every few minutes for some reason and not wringing the dish cloth very well) and pay at the end of it. No one directs you to beverages or the fact that there is another side of the restaurant that has the vegetarian soups (I think there were 5 to choose from), three types of bread including cornbread, and sad looking deserts like plain chocolate brownies and a couple of healthy muffins. They have a soft-serve ice cream station, but no cakes, pies, cobblers, pudding, cheesecakes, or cookies (not even oatmeal-raisin).  

We sat at our table (all self - seating) after we figured out how to get our food and beverages by watching other people, because no one working there offered any help to my husband and myself who obviously looked as if this was our first time at this poor excuse of a restaurant. We even had to place our trays on a vacant table next to us because it seemed the thing to do as we saw other people doing the same. Again, no guidance or help from the staff in clearing tables.  

We paid $32 for myself, my husband, and a friend of ours for soup and vegetables at a fully self-serve restaurant. It wasn't worth it especially in this town where we could have gone to any number of the neighborhood buffets for the same price and had more of a variety of foods AND have someone serve us our beverages (with refills), clean our tables, and answer any questions we may have about the buffet.

The place was clean and the service was great  
I know this is a place where you don't get your average burger with fries or fish ,nothing like that but  we payed $30 just for tasteless food and that $30 was with a coupon for drinks 

When going to this places keep in mind that maybe the only best thing is the salad  passed that area you will only find 6 different soups -pizza- mac &cheese -pasta noodles and for dessert  ice cream , chocolate mouse , jell-O , tapioca and apples   so be prepared to be hungry with in an hour  many of this places called soup plantation in Ca have so many more items  to choose from and tasty (think they are the same chain even tho they have different  names because soup plantation coupons are accepted here .",dJ_AhP3TpmZblvuLgz_r5Q,1,0,3,eKMh-bWgk8bjpu7jeZdVgA
1162065,2010-08-05,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"The food here is pretty good.  There are plenty of salad ingredients, including some fancy fruits and vegetables you wouldn't normally put in your salad at home.  Everything is fresh and clean, and legibly labeled above the items on the plastic dome shielding the food from contaminants.  Behind the salad bar and pasta bar counters, plenty of food servers are constantly freshening up the ingredients and wiping up spills, splashes, and the occasional spoon/tong mishap from diners.  In addition to the wide selection of salad ingredients, there's also every dressing imaginable to choose from.

If you don't wish to put together your own unique salad, you can instead grab your choice of an already prepared and labeled gourmet salad.  I recommend the Asian chicken salad mix with its crunchy won tons and zesty sweet dressing.

There are also hot ""bars,"" with do-it-yourself pasta and soup stations.  These items are controlled via hot water tanks and heating bulbs, so the freshness isn't always what it should be.  The noodles tend to be stuck together and using two tongs sometimes works best.  They have a good selection of tasty soups, everything from French Onion to Minestrone.  In addition, they've also got tasty breads and simple pizzas in this section.  It's always nice to have a small square of pizza with my salad.  

Finally, we have the dessert section, with a do-it-yourself soft ice cream machine and plenty of candy sprinkles or nut toppings to choose from.  There's also variety of cakes and cookies here.  

I guess I should also mention the fountain drink station, which includes options for hot coffee and tea.  

The major downside to this establishment is the seating process.  It's a cafeteria setting, so you may find yourself holding your food and beverage tray, craning your neck to spot an open & clean  table that will fit your party, while kids and other diners zip past you.  Once seated though, the experience can be enjoyed.  However, if you want to keep your table, you and your party will have to return for seconds or thirds in shifts.  

This is not a restaurant where you can take your leftovers home.  Although, apparently you can order a box to go, fill it up, and take it away with you.  But if you dine in, it is all you can eat for under $10.  Of course, there's only so much anyone can eat, and with all the choices and temptations it can be a bit overwhelming.  You may find that you want a little bit of everything and end up gorging, which is never healthy -- even when the food is.  

Sweet Tomatoes is an establishment I visit from time to time, but I usually wait till I have a coupon, so I can really feel like I'm getting a good deal without having to stuff myself.  I will also visit the newer location on West Flamingo next time, because from what I've read it sounds like it might have a nicer atmosphere.  So maybe I'll post a review of that one in the future.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,3,6lKRszk7RN8NHy86-oeo4A

You start off with getting your fresh salad with all sorts of fixin's. I usually just opt for their Caesar Salad or the Asian Wonton Salad. You pay after you get your salad then once you're situated at your table, grab a drink and more entrees!

It's basically endless bread, soup, pasta, pizza, baked potato, ice cream etc.! Every month, they try to feature different dishes depending on the theme they choose. It was Italy when I last visited so they had 3 different pastas & various soups to commemorate Italian culture.

I just chose my usual staples; Garlic Foccasia Bread, Cheese Pizza, Corn Chowder, Broccoli & Cheese Soup & most importantly Cornbread with Honey Whipped Butter. GAHHH! My favorite. I also love their Strawberry Lemonade. 

I think it's a pretty good place for brunch/lunch, there's not a huge selection for food but trust me, you'll always leave full. You'll feel quite healthy too, no-guilt attached. I think that's a pretty good feeling considering we are all foodies here. :)

For breads, there is usually focaccia and corn bread as well as several muffin types (the chocolate muffins are divine!). 

To mix things up, their soups, pre-mixed salads, and muffins general infuse seasonal flavors. 

The have a full potato bar and, of course, there is fresh fruit and a dessert bar. They round out dessert with a soft serve ice cream machine and (rarely) bring fresh baked cookies to your table.

Everything was so mediocre last night. First I noted that the spinach leaves weren't topped off and fresh, there were broken leaves and some of them looked limp. 

Moving on to the soups, the chicken pot stew was OK, I did like the french onion soup. 
Tried the chicken noodle soup and the chicken was really dry and tough. 

The brown whole wheat honey bread was good, thats probably the only thing that was on point last night. 

I had some of the spicy italian meat pasta and the pasta was mushy! No bueno.

The past couple times, I have noticed a downward trend of quality. recently, some items were added to the ""upgrade"" section. For almost $11 for dinner, I would rather pay an extra buck & just have as much chicken as we want. Not for $2.49 & only one 3 or 4 oz serving!

The soups are fairly good quality. The chowder & the potato leek soup alone made a star on the review.  

The pasta dishes have dropped badly in quality. Fazoli's had better pasta - and that is a fast food place! I would like to see a return to basics on their pasta. What's the use of sausage & peppers if you cannot get the pasta right?

For a salad bar restaurant, Sweet Tomatoes has a very poor selection of fruit. Watermelon, pineapples, & cantaloupe should be standard, plus maybe one or two others. They had bananas and apples! Wow how imaginative for the price we paid. Not. 

The selection of hot tea is quality. Two different red tea selections. The pomegranate green tea was tasty. BTW, it is the Republic of Tea company, not Lipton or Nestea. 

Jason's Deli does offer a better salad, where a soup can be bought for $1. Maybe we will give Sweet Tomatoes another chance in a few months. But it is no longer the go-to place it once was.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,0,0,3,Z_vjUMU47NwKYmDWhjrUFQ

I like how you are able to immediately pick up a plate and start assembling your salad as soon as you walk in, and that there are two sides to the salad bar itself- made things move quite quickly.
Or at least that was the intention. There seemed to be some sort of issue with the cashier on our side disappearing, and an employee stocking silverware had to hop on register at the last minute but her login was not going through- luckily, the cashier on the other side (Jarra?) came to the rescue and began attending to both sides of the buffet line and alternating transactions with her register. Way to step up!

The salad bar portion started with a few premade featured salad options, then had all the ingredients, add-ons, and dressings to fix up your own. BF and I did a little of each. You're able to customize to make your meal as healthy or unhealthy as you want- I really try to stay away from the premade versions as they general are over-dressed and have more caloric ingredients.

Once you are seated, you can then add on soup options. Tomato soup was delicious,  cream of mushroom was a super-fresh featured flavor, and the clam chowder was very flavorful. The black bean chili had surprising depth of flavor but didn't really suit me, nor did the chicken noodle chunk.

The baked potato bar, pasta options, and dessert area are very limited- which for us was a good thing, as we could not really be tempted and could focus on the healthy meals we came here for. Lots of breads though- add a stick or two to the bottom of your soup bowl, especially the garlic bread + tomato soup combo.

Service at the table was surprisingly attentive about clearing dishes, asking if there was anything we needed, and generally maintaining a productive and positive attitude throughout the dinner rush time.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,3,4,TywChWkwcEl5KR_FYo1GPQ

2077524,2015-01-21,3,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"Sweet Tomatoes is best described as a soup and salad buffet. Considering there is no meat on the menu, I think the price is a bit steep @ $11.49/pp NOT including a drink. Drinks will set you back an additional $2.49. So basically almost $14/pp for  lettuce and soup! The good news is if you sign up for their rewards club, you get an email every 2 weeks or so with coupons that take about $5 off. Luckily I had just received a coupon when my aunt invited me to dinner. The cashiers can scan the coupon code right from your smart phone, in case you forget to print it out.

The buffet line begins as soon as you walk in the door. You grab a tray and a plate and proceed down the salad line where you can build your own, or try some of the pre-made ones they have, like my favorite the Asian wonton. At the end of the line you pay and then seat yourself. Then you make your way over to the hot food items, where they have 5/6 different types of soup and chili, a few different breads and muffins, baked potatoes, and a few pasta's. This particular visit I tried the tomato soup and cream of rosemary potato, which were both very good. The pasta I tend to stay away from because it is too watery. For dessert they have a soft-serve ice cream machine as well as pudding and fresh fruit. I usually take the brownie muffins and put them in a bowl with some chocolate soft serve on top and some hot fudge and it makes for a pretty tasty dessert.

2093307,2017-10-29,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"When it comes to wanting to feel healthy eating at a buffet, Soup Plantation or Sweet Tomatoes is always first pick for me. I enjoy the pricing, the foods that are normally on the healthier side, as well as the soups, pastas and desserts.

This time I will say the restaurant was lacking a bit. The salads were amazing. They had a broccoli in a sauce with bacon, cashews, cranberries and other ingredients that made for a sweet and delectable and enjoyable bite. I enjoy all the dressings and cheeses available, especially the blue cheeses, because its my favorite.

As for the soups, that is what normally limits when I go. I love me broccoli cheddar, but there was none yesterday. I wasn't a fan of trying most of the other soups, though the pumpkin bisque was nice. I think sp/st has such a great chicken noodle soup, however, yesterday was somewhat of an exception. Though the soup was good, it could have been great, like it normally is, if they would have added some salt or flavoring. The chili is always a favorite of mine too, but I guess they've changed recipes over the years... so instead of a mashed thicker chili, it was more of a liquid soup with beans in it. (I used to enjoy putting a corn bread piece in the bowl and dousing it with chili). I'm not the biggest fan of this new chili, though still good, not as great.

The breads were all good. The pizza like bites were delicious. The corn bread was a star in the buffet, as usual. Extremely delicious. I really enjoyed the baked sweet potato with maple butter (I ate 2, wanted another but was extremely full). 

Pastas were a let down this visit. Normally very rich and delicious, this time only tasted like pasta with store bought sauce. Not bad, but not great as normal.

As for desserts: chocolate mousse is sugar free and should not be consumed by anyone lol I'm not a fan, and never have been. Sugar free isn't good, but I guess it is healthy. The pumpkin spice muffins were delicious, and as were the brownie muffin which you can put underneath a nice thick blanket of ice cream! 

All in all, I enjoy this place, but it could be better as it used to be.",bJ_CWJ55ZLgwNvo-OAW2Og,2,2,4,km_n49vEaea4dtuTWJv1lA

2166722,2010-09-27,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"This is our nth time visiting Vegas and earlier in the day we had our customary buffet on the Strip.  It was 7pm and because we had way too much meat and crab legs for lunch, we thought a nice salad dinner was a must.  

Getting here from the Strip takes about 15 min. w/o traffic.  Be sure to take the ""82B"" exit from the I-95.  It will lead you straight into the humongous shopping center and Sweet Tomatoes will be right behind Applebees.

I have to admit I'm a regular at the Souplantations in the OC.  My favorite item there is the Clam Chowder, but for some reason Sweet Tomatoes (which is pretty much the same thing as Souplantation w/ a different name) does not offer this soup.  Because of this tiny little detail, I couldn't give it 5 stars.

The veggies were fresh.  Chocolate lava cake, that's only offered after 4p, was delish.  And the lady who took away our dishes was kind enough to bring us a plate of freshly baked cookies.  The staff overall was very polite and that made the whole dining experience pretty darn great.",kTA-f2zhfEFJOBpgYw4DOg,0,0,4,USFCTRmT1sctO2E2CpNT-w

2205530,2018-05-31,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"So I have to say Sweet Tomatoes is one of my favorite places to eat but this is by far one of the worst locations.

Let's start with the dishes. Had to get water cup swapped out because it was very dirty and then silverware as well because there was gross left over food stuck to it. No napkins stalked at our table so we had to pull some from another table. Table was very dirty as well so this location has to work on cleanliness.

Second the food...
So disappointed. Salad bar ok... however soup selection wasn't the best and what they had wasn't good. The vegetables inside the soup were extremely hard. Like they had cut them up and put them in the soup raw.  Muffins and bread were hard like they had been sitting out. All around the food was just gross.

Mentioned it to the manager and he could have cared less

Lastly... last time we were here my 7 year old burned herself grabbing one of the utensils to grab the bread. They get very hot. She needed ice and it left a mark. This time she remembered because it literally scarred her... this time the little girl right next to me did it with the garlic bread. They should really put something in the handles or have a warning. They are metal handles sitting Under heat lamps. that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

Won't be returning here. Especially after manager didn't care about us not being happy about this visit.",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,1,0,1,HPH6tntAf3PQ7XhEPRqI5A

I've noticed that the salad bar turnover is high, which explains the high quality of vegetables.  The soup station features 5-6 different soups, all made on-site and all tasty.  Baked offerings include several different types of bread (foccacia w and w/o cheese, cornbread, muffins) and dessert (crisps, cobblers, molten cake).  Frozen yogurt and fruit station seem popular, but can't tell you what they're like as I've never had any of it!  ST is great for vegetarians and for those wanting a lighter meal (as long as the desserts and cheesy items are consumed in moderation).  Cheap buffet + cafeteria style ambience = casual meal out.

I used to come here regularly but since they keep raising their prices I don't see how it's worth it anymore, especially when their food has little proteins and service is mediocre. Takes forever just to pay for your food since they only have 1 cashier despite having 2 separate lines at the salad bar. 

Sign up for their e-club to get regular coupons sent to you.  During the holidays they also have gift card deals where you get a free meal with every $50 in gift cards purchased.

The selection is nice of salad items and premade salads. And their soups are great. I like to get creative when I dine here, trying to mix everything together. Can't say the food is always fresh, but its decent, not old and dry looking.

I like to get the baked potato with their fresh honey whipped butter and sour cream and then put chili in it with some tabasco! YUM!

And then the chocolate brownie muffins with ice cream for dessert.

Their seasonal items are always great. For the fall, or maybe just November.. they had chicken pot pie with biscuits, pumpkin spice muffin with cranberries, and after 4pm, they have a gooey pumpkin cake.

Don't expect too much and you will be surprised what you do get out of this place. I always leave happy and really stuffed. It may just be soups, salads, and muffins, but they do it well.

Generally I try to eat low carb and high protein, so this place is not a ""healthy"" choice for me at all. Pricing is good and there's plenty of seating. And they have good selection of beverages. What more can I say? I am a fan. But it isn't good for my waistline to eat at Sweet Tomatoes too often.

If you're looking for a salad bar along the lines of Ruby Tuesday's - here you go. Cold, fresh, and a very impressive selection. The few times I looked down and wondered, ""Are those carrots or squash? Zucchini or cucumbers?"" there would be a sign on the sneeze shield indicating what it was. There are some smart folks running this franchise! 

Soups (included) were great. Especially the baked potato soup, the chicken & rice soup and the chili. And none were too salty - a great thing.

Glad I gave it another shot. A fun, healthy alternative to the smorgasbord of Asian / Mexican places that we usually end up at for lunch!",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,2,0,4,Om9BTmomAgdqPiYG4puZ0Q

The staff always do a good job to keep the salad, soup, pasta and dessert bars clean, stocked and fresh.  Even the premade concoctions at the very beginning that can get soggy because they are already dressed.

Soup is one of my favorite things to sample.  I love that they always have 8 different varieties to choose from and include many vegetarian options as well.  I have not had a bad soup yet.  Even when they creamy potato gets burned from sitting in the well all day it still is very tasty.  

Sweet Tomatoes will highlight a different ingredient it seems every season.  That ingredient will be incorporated in many of their salads or sides dishes.  This mean the selection will vary slightly if you space your visits out enough.  So make each plate your own and make frequent trips to the soup and salad bar.  Get creative and try something new. 

The one issue I have with this concept is the price for soup and salad.  Over $11.00 for each adult not including a drink for dinner seems a little steep in my opinion.  Also why have a lunch and dinner price when there is really no different choices offered at 4 pm when dinner price kicks into effect.

2845917,2014-12-13,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"I stumbled upon this salad bar while killing time driving around Las Vegas a couple of months ago, and in need of something for lunch.  It looked interesting, so I did a quick Yelp search from the parking lot to see what it was all about, and seeing decent reviews, I stepped inside.  

When I first walked in, it took me a minute to figure out the process, but thankfully there was an employee right there doing some cleaning, and he pointed me in the right direction.  Down the salad bar I worked, creating a huge salad of all my favorite veggies, many of which you don't see at a typical salad place.  I wish I had realized at the time that there were more delicious things down the other end of the bar and beyond, so I could have left some room on my plate!  Once you work past the regular salad stuff, you get to some prepared salads.  I tried one that was vegan.  After finish with the salad bar, you pay a flat rate per person, depending on whether it's lunch or dinner hours.  The cashier somehow realized that I was a newbie, so she explained the company to me and welcomed me.  

After paying, you can chose your seat, and then make your way to the hot bar, which included soups, chili, bread, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and probably some other things I can't remember two months later.  Even though I already had a huge salad on my plate, I had to try a little taste of the ministrone soup, and a wheat roll. There is also a dessert bar, but aside from the fresh fruit, there didn't appear to be anything this vegan could eat.  

While I was sitting, enjoying my meal, the manager, who apparently also caught wind that I was new to the restaurant, came over, welcomed me, and gave me a small bag of their in-house made chocolate chip cookies!  Never before had I felt so welcomed at a business, I knew I'd be returning before my trip was over.  Didn't even care about being given cookies I could not eat.  I was happy to share them with my husband's hockey teammates.  

I did return a day or two later with my husband, who also enjoyed the experience.  Unfortunately on the second trip, we were rushed, so we didn't get to sit and enjoy our meal as much, but it was still delicious.  

I really wish this business was in New Jersey.  Next time I'm traveling west, I'll definitely keep my eye out for a Sweet Tomatoes!",zqh0Gm8TLOQmU1ayg-DPDg,0,0,4,5f3jZSlR2eD9N6aedOM4Eg

The fountain bar is always drenched and there was not even 1 piece of ice.Half of the salad bar had nearly empty containers and they were out of forks. Our salads were on point but when we went for the classic chicken noodle soup the chicken was so hard and tough we couldn't eat it. They pasta bar had mushy dry old pasta. It was approximate 5:30 when we arrived by 7pm it was still the same. The quality is just getting worse and worse. I don't know how their corporation could even be half pleased to allow the current quality of this place. Sad to say I'll have to find a new place,di1JBJqc4SlSnckOC6KgCg,3,0,2,W5lb8SiVkIisX8zuc9rRXQ

They open at 11am Mon-Sat and it was only 11:15am when we got inside. When we started going down the salad bar, I couldn't help but notice that everything looked like it was just uncovered from the night before. A lot of the salad was limp and majority of the toppings were almost empty. Considering they just opened 15 minutes before, it shouldn't have looked like that at all. In fact, one would think we would be getting the best of everything because it should all be newly stocked. That just wasn't the case here...

We looked at the menu online beforehand to make sure they had soups that we would like. The main reason why I wanted to go was for the Cream of Broccoli and Sweet Tomato Onion, so after eating some salad I went to load up on soup. I saw French Onion, chili, Cream of Broccoli, Turkey Noodle, Dill Potato, and Split pea. What was missing? The Sweet Tomato Onion!! Apparently they just don't follow their menu that's posted online because the Tomato Onion and Chicken Noodle were missing, but they had Dill Potato and French Onion, which weren't even on their online menu.

The only thing I really liked about my experience here the other day was that it was easy to find booth seating right next to the soup/pasta section because it was very early on a weekday, but that's not enough of a bonus to add another star.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,0,2,PFjs4wva7b4Kkm_1EcmTWA

They have home made soups, a baked potato bar, home made breads, a pasta bar, and desserts. Always fresh and hot. They feature different items seasonally so keep an eye out. I just had the Avocado BLT salad and it was delicious. I'm sure it was not as fat free as I'm going to make myself believe.

They have a couple different salad and a whole bunch of toppings to add. You pay for your buffet and drink and then side down. They also have water bottle for purchase if you want them. We sat down and demolished our salad and then made our way to the soups. I grabbed the chili with some of their pizza breads. They also have spaghetti and mac and cheese too.

There are a few places you can grab a salad, including fast food restaurants, but how many offer unlimited salad, soup, pasta, breads, and dessert?  Not many.  Sweet Tomatoes is a salad buffet, with all the toppings and sides you can think of.  It's cheap, it's convenient, and it's not that bad.  

I like their soups, especially the Asian Ginger Brother, which tastes like arroz caldo from home.  I love their cornbread (with real corn) and blueberry muffins. Those are great points to the place.

Now, for the bad.

The other day I stopped by with my friend to eat lunch, since our breakfast was somewhat greasy.  We grabbed a plate, piled it on, and when it came to the red onions, which were just replaced in front of my face, they reeked.  Now, don't get me wrong--I know onions have a scent, but imagine that scent times 100.  I figured that, since it was just replaced, it was fresh.  WRONG.

That evening I contracted a nasty heartburn episode tasting nothing but red onion and I felt nauseous.  Apparently when onions smell really strong, they actually fermented.  BAD.

The kettle chili is really good.  I tried the shrimp bisque and was very disappointed.  I didn't enjoy the taste or texture.  My husband had the chicken noodle and was very happy with the big chunks of white chicken and noodles. 

The fresh pasta is becoming more flavorful and moving away from being completely bland.  We tried the penne garden tomato with basil and it was very good.

2nd: MORE BUFFET!! 7-8 soups, 6-8 types of bread, ramen soup station, 5-6 types of hot pasta, fresh fruit, pudding and soft serve ice cream with a goodie station.

I felt adventurous, and wanted to try something new. I didn't really know what to expect. I wouldn't say either that my palate is expansive. In general though, I like salad bars, so I thought I would give this place a try. I'm not even sure this review will be helpful to anyone, but maybe it will. 

Basically, you walk in, grab a tray and a plate, make a salad from the salad bar, pay for your order, and then sit down. From there, you get your drinks and then soup, bread, and everything else they have there. 

I'll start with the positives. The staff was super friendly and helpful in explaining a newbie how everything works. The food was replenished in a timely manner. The restaurant was very clean. They serve Coke products, which is always worth a star. 

Now, if you like meat, don't come here. They have none. I didn't see any salt or pepper, either. Even the chicken noodle soup has no chicken. I'm not a vegetarian, and I don't mind too much that there isn't any meat, but I thought that the price was a little high considering that meat is usually what drives prices up at buffet type places. 

In Vegas, there are plenty of other options where you can get pretty much everything Sweet Tomatoes has to offer (and a lot more) for the same price, or a little more money. I didn't see the value for the price. 

The food itself, in my opinion, was average. It's completely subjective, but I wasn't blown away. The soup was cold. The chili was cold. The bread was cold. The corn was cold. The chicken noodle soup was pretty much water and noodles, and lacked flavor. Chili is hit or miss for me, and I didn't really care for it. The salad was fine, and the food was fresh, just really cold. It was all very healthy, I'm sure, and well prepared, but I just wasn't blown away. 

If you're already a big fan of Sweet Tomatoes, or you're very health conscious with your food and you love salads and soups, you'll probably like this location, which is in a family friendly, safe area. If you're a meat lover, your options will be severely limited and you'll want to stick to a buffet or a Golden Corral or something. I'm somewhere in the middle, hence the 3 star review. With so many other alternatives in Las Vegas, I don't see myself coming back a second time, purely for subjective reasons and not because of Sweet Tomatoes or the location itself.

3837759,2016-02-25,1,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"We come here so frequently due to the simple fact that it's delicious and inexpensive. They recently had a huge remodel, providing a cleaner and more professional atmosphere to clientele. 

I've never encountered old food (everything is usually fresh), and very rarely do I not like what I try. It's always pretty loud, but, then again, what can you expect from a quick buffet like this? 

We once encountered an issue with the food, but the manager was on top of it. My fiancé took a bite of his salad and found a literal screw in the bowl (I assume that it was from a very rushed remodel). He wasn't hurt, wasn't offended, and calmly called over a waiter to find the manager. To me, the whole screw incident is an anomaly. The possibility of some idiot contractor leaving screws on a kitchen shelf where it could fall into a bowl is high. Immediately, before anything else, the manager pulled the salads and had them replaced. He apologized to us profusely and gave us several coupons for free meals with drinks. Awesome.

Honesty, I won't hold the whole screw thing against them. It was only a couple days after the remodel. Shit happens. 

Either way, we're still happy to come in an devour all the cornbread. Because if I sit down at a restaurant with my fiancé, or I drive up for fast food, it will cost about $20.00+. Sweet Tomatoes is about $22 for two people with a coupon (which are constantly available).

I am a vegetarian and I love eating here. They do charge extra for meat, but I think that is fair since I don't want to pay for something I will never, ever be indulging in. I appreciate their vegetarian options, however I wish they had more vegetarian soups on any given day. I always feel very disappointed when I pay and then end up with one soup choice that I don't care for. Lord knows they always have 8 different varieties of chicken soup. That is my only complaint, I love the vegetarian broccoli soup.

We went this past Monday for dinner.  We both love Mexican food and welcome the variety at Sweet Tomatoes.  If we were in the mood for just Mexican, we would have gone to a Mexican Restaurant.  There was lime, cilantro and sugar in almost everything.  Soup: Chicken Tortilla, Mexican Stew, Posole.  Pizza: Quesadilla PIzza.  Baked Potatato station: Pico de gallo, cilantro (no chive available) --we asked.  Pasta:  Cilantro Lime Penne Pasta (the sauce was separated, greasy and sweet) it was the worst pasta I ever had.  BTW all three pasta choices were penne pasta, even the ""macaroni"" and cheese.  Dessert:  Margarita Muffin-- my husband literally spit it out and asked me to taste it. I of course didn't.  Don't me wrong we love Mexican food.  It may have even been ok if it tasted good but it didn't.  There was only vanilla soft serve available but there was still chocolate dripping down the machine and in the receptor.  My husband is a Chef and I am a pastry chef.  We go to Sweet Tomatoes due to the consistency of quality, product and service.  We will never go to this location again.  We may try the Summerlin location or another in Las Vegas one more time to give it one more chance.  I am hoping it isn't a company or regional decline.

It's dumb for me to come here because I have all the greens and chicken or tuna at home but everything is ready for me here to put on a plate and eat!

The items are always replenished when running low, and tables are always clean.  People always come in with coupons, where the heck do you get those?  :P

It's always packed in there but there's always room to sit, very nice.  When I think about it, I drop $40 a week here after my gym sessions.  Yikes.  But I keep coming back!

4014464,2008-06-16,3,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"I usually end up here once a month or so for some reason because I find myself craving some veggies.  Lunch is pretty reasonable for around the $7 range per person, but I think dinner is a bit pricey at about $9 a pop.  Damn the stinking economy even makes getting a salad harder to do.  But this place is considered vegetarian heaven.

When you first walk in, you see trays to the left or right of you.  The place is kind of like a cafeteria in the sense that you take a tray, a plate, and concoct your own salad with the fixins'.  They have a TON of stuff to choose from like spinach, romaine lettuce, pickles, peppers, cheese, croutons, even my fav alfalfa sprouts, and lots of other fresh things.  They have a few special or house recipe salads at the beginning of the line.  My fav is the Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad, I get it every time and it usually fits the bill.   I do get a little greedy sometimes though and take as much of the chicken as I can find because as you can tell, meat is sparce in this place.  But you can buy a little container of extra chicken for $1.25.  To me it's not worth it.  I just go and jack extra chicken form the Chicken Noodle Soup and cut it up to throw on my salad...ha ha.  They also usually have a decent house Caesar salad and a special salad that changes monthly according to one of their themes.  After you go down the line you and choose what you want, you get to the end and pay for your drinks and meal.  Then you get seated, or if it's not busy you can seat yourself.  

They also have a soup area with at least 5 or 6 different soups daily, with staples like Chicken Noodle, and Chile Con Carne.  Their Cream of Mushroom soup is great (I think it's only on certain days..Tuesday?) because it's got lots of fresh mushroom in it.  You can also make yourself a baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, green onions, and onions.  Not to mention they also have a bakery section that features breads, muffins, pizza bread (great with their killer Ranch), garlic bread, and even gooey chocolate cake or cobbler (dinner only).  They also got a fresh fruit bar, build your own sundae bar, and a pasta station with 3 diffferent selections to choose from.

The food here is pretty fresh and not bad at all.  If you enjoy a salad and soup you will like this place.  I usually find myself craving for a steak or a rotisserie chicken however after I eat here.  For some reason, not having a hunk of protein on my plate leaves me hungry.  Good thing all their food is fresh, otherwise this probably wouldn't be a great place to eat.  I can eat at least 2 plates though of their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad.  AND at least 6-8 pieces of their pizza bread (only from the MIDDLE part...ha ha) with Ranch.  They got good Strawberry Lemonade too. 

Their sundae bar ain't too bad even though it's standard fare from a soft serve machine.  You can make one with vanilla or chocolate ice cream, Oreo crumbles, sprinkles, chocolate, caramel, pineapple, and cherries.  They have these little, itty, bitty baby cones to put ice cream in (I guess this is to cater to the little ones).  I ALWAYS, ALWAYS try to fill one of these little cones up and it overflows, causing ice cream on my hand.  Never fails.  Maybe they can install something to make the ice cream come out a little slower?  I don't know.  

Eat here if you're craving a salad (a lot of us don't), enjoy freshness (at a bit of a price), and are vegan or vegetarian.  Actually, we all should enjoy freshness at a salad buffet.  Me, I like my salad with a hunk a meat on the side.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,2,3,rQ_nIzEGMdHMfeRw2B4BHA

I have been going here since they first opened 10-11 year ago...Back in the day I would have easily given this place 4-5 stars! 

Did not recognize one employee here which is UNUSUAL-one thing that I liked about ST is that they seemed to have a very low turnover rate which usually is a good sign for a restaurant.

There was a warning sign posted on the front door stating that due to the recent bouts of weather they were out of several vegetable items...Totally understand- But the ""Wonton Chicken Happiness"" salad was minus the happy chicken as was the tossed chicken Tarragon salad sans the chicken...Would have appreciated the ""chicken shortage"" sign as well...
The veggies did look fresh-never a complaint about that.  ST is pretty vigilant in keeping their salad bar clean.

The soups were good except for the pumpkin soup-it couldn't make it's mind up between being a sweet or savory-pick a side & stay there!  

There was plenty of pickings from baked sweet potatoes & regular baked potatoes to the many breads & muffins...

And then we got to the pasta bar...The Garlic Alfredo was watery and about as tasty as milk soup.  They were also serving scalloped potatoes-the spuds did not seem thouroughly cooked and the cheese sauce was watery.  Blecch... 

The apple cranberry cobbler looked like it had been sitting out since lunch and what was left would not be anough to put in one of the paper dressing cups.  (It was 6pm-Prime dinner rush-I noticed that same pan out for at least 20 minutes before my husband asked the nearest server if there was fresh pan) There was & it was served.

No one offered us refills of water (never had to ask before).  In the past , you could barely bat an eyelash before your dirty plates were removed by attentive staff.  Ours actually piled up a bit and one server actually left the swampy looking potatoes behind which made me relive that disgusting moment.

4147094,2013-04-12,3,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"I am torn on what I want to rate Sweet Tomatoes as today.  I went last night for dinner and I enjoyed it but not really enough to give 4 stars.  However, I feel 3 stars is too low.  How about I break it down and let you all decide.

I start by parking in what appeared to be a mostly empty section on parking lot.  I walk to one door.  No go.  It is an exit only.  So I walk to the next door.  Same thing.  Exit only.  Before I knew it I was on the other side of the building.  No matter though.  It just means that I have an easy exit back to my car when I am done eating.  

Having not been to a Sweet Tomatoes or Souplantaion style restaurant in a very long time I did not remember that you start by grabbing a tray and plate and filling up with salad before you pay.  It was confusing to me at first.  So I just followed the lead of those in front of me.  The line moved a bit slowly but it gave me time to put what I wanted on my plate without feeling rushed.  I had Ceasar salad, spinach, mixed greens, olives, beats, shredded squash, feta cheese, sun flower seeds, cauliflower, cucumber, and mushrooms all topped with balsamic dressing.  When I got to the register I gave the cahsier the coupon I had for 20%.  She scanned it and I paid $11.19.

I then sought out an open table where I could eat without feeling like I was taking up space as a single diner in a place that is set up more for groups.  I settled in an open area near the soda fountain.  Before I started on my salad I went up to the soup bar and filled a bowl with cream of mushroom soup.  It was a toss up between that and the creamy tomato basil.  I feel I made a wise choice.  The mushrooms I could tell were fresh.  Not canned.  Delicious.  I also grabbed a piece of sour dough bread and some creamy butter before heading back to my seat.  

As a speedy eater I did not feel like I was in the way at all.  I ate my one plate of salad, one bowl of soup, and one piece of bread before people near me in line were even half way done with their food.  I was out of there quickly.  

During the time I was in there I was greeted by a friendly cashier and a lady picking up trays and asking if I needed anything else.  There is not much expected in a buffet style restaurant but the service here was good.  The major issue I have is the price.  $10.29 plus the price of a drink and tax seems high for a salad bar.  Perhaps if I had gone for seconds it would have seemed more worth it.

So, what do you think?  3.5 stars?  Seems fair to me.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,6,2,3,M-Xn_mnJZ6TP-qkU-CSOFw

The ambience is terrible, too much noise and plenty of crying babies and noisy kids. But its a cheap place for families and they have to eat too! 
The best time to go to get a table is to avoid the crowds at lunch and dinner. If you show up for a late lunch at 2:30pm versus earlier at 1 or 2pm it's easier snagging a table and no wait. For fresher offerings, it's better to go for an earlier dinner, around 4:30p.m.

UPDATE 2-17-16 PRICES HAVE GONE UP RIDICULOUSLY FOR TOGO so now I make my own salads! 

This place is one of my favs when I don't feel like cooking and want to have something healthy. Typical salad bar set up, you can make your own salad and pick a soup of your choice and you are ready to go! I most always do a to go order, and it so convenient, I'm always in and out. 

In addition to my salad, my absolute fav is the Tuna Tarragon. I need the recipe for this as I could eat that stuff all day! I live for the Lemon Chicken Orzo soup when it's in season and the Udon Sriracha soup is great on a cold day.",2_JZcBO_KLAgxDQosHnt5Q,3,2,4,qSUGdEGl5IWNbPXJjJpRog

Endless topping for your salad! I couldnt stop adding stuff going down the line.

The Madness Broccoli(9) down here had me hooked the whole afternoon, and was the first time having raw broccoli. Since it was my first time, i can only say i enjoyed their Cran Orange Muffin(8) and their house chili. Dressing wise, Greek(10) is the way to go! Especially if you like that vinegar sour taste.

I had some errands to run, late as usual, and was in the shopping center anyway, so I called my husband and suggested he meet me there.  We've been here many times before.  He got a BOGO coupon online and drove over. Sweet Tomatoes is usually okay, and tonight it was less okay.  

I was surprised to see that the prices are now up to $10.50 pp.  Okay, but we had a BOGO.  But wait...in order to use it, you have to buy two drinks.  We don't usually buy drinks unless they're alcoholic, and I know from past experience that Sweet Tomatoes' coffee is the worst swill in the world.  They charge 2.39 for any drink, which puts their coffee at a price even higher than Starbucks, and it's undrinkable. I don't do soda or iced tea.

I usually like their salads, but tonight was an exception.  One, a spinach with turkey, apples, and almonds, tasted really peculiar.  

Every month the theme changes except, apparently, December.  All the inspiration went out with Thanksgiving.  There was stuffing to put into a cream of turkey soup.  Many of the salads had turkey as an addition.  The soups were uninviting, too, unless you like cream soups:  there were two to choose from.  They had an Asian Ginger broth whose sign said to add spinach, mushrooms, scallions, and a host of other ingredients, but all of those were way on the other side, requiring a walk to the back of the restaurant to get around back to the front, where the salad item are.  And the one chili seemed like a soup with meatballs, thin and watery, and not very spicy.

I've never tried any of the hot pasta dishes until tonight, but the penne in a peppery sauce with Italian sausage sounded good, so I took a tablespoonful.  It was dreadful - lukewarm, with gummy pasta and just one speck of sausage left in the entire wok receptacle.  

One big reason I don't like coming here is the ambient temperature.  In the summer, it's freezing, because the air conditioning is blasting and the ceiling fans are spinning.  In the winter, it's...freezing!  I had on a sweatshirt and a fleece jacket, and couldn't take the jacket off.  It started to warm up a little, and then got so cold my nose was running.  I asked the manager if it was corporate policy to keep the place so cold that people eat fast, eat less, and leave!  He said the AC wasn't even on.  I hope this review will help turn on the heat, literally and figuratively.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,0,2,aagrx1CFWKhoIRpj_4Q25w

I had the house made green chili ranch dressing and it was really good!!! Had a bit of spicy from the green chili and was thick and creamy! Yum!!!
They also have 8 or so different soup options, a baked potato bar, and some pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, and mac & cheese) These, not my favs.... I had the chili, it was just like any ordinary can of chili. 
The pastas about the same.... I tasted the spaghetti and fettuccine neither had much of an appetizing sauce, a great option is you have kids though.

They have TONS of veggies to choose from. 3 premade salads and 4 different types of greens. Joan's broccoli madness is the shiz! Their strawberry lemonade is awesome but pretty sweet so I usually mix it with their unsweetened FLAVORED iced tea. My favorite soup is the clam chowder and the big noodle chicken. Sometimes they'll have a creamy tomato soup which is soooooo much better then Campbell's lol. My daughter loved their Mac n cheese, I personally don't care for it. Their cord bread has whole corn in it and is awesome with their honey whipped butter. For dessert I ove vanilla frozen yogurt and their butterscotch sauce.

I came around 4:30 pm on a Saturday and they had a steady stream of customers.  When you walk in, the salad bar is already laid out in front of you.  They have you getting your food and tray way before you pay!  They have a pretty decent selection of things to throw on your salad, including prepared tossed salads, pasta salads, slaw, potato salad, tons of dressing choices, and all your typical toppings.  It's not hard to fill up your plate with just salad alone.

If you ever venture past the salad bar, you'll find a few varieties of soup (chicken noodle, tomato soup, french onion, etc.) and chili, a make your own baked potato section, a few selections of focaccia breads, cornbread, and even the pasta bar.  (Their mac n' cheese reminds me of the Kraft in the box variety, which I actually really like!)

When you're ready to satisfy your sweet tooth, they have chocolate pudding, fresh fruit, sundae bar, and rice pudding.  (I didn't see any molten lava cake like Myke R. was talking about though!)

Beverage choices include your basic soda, along with strawberry lemonade and cranberry green tea!  You can even make your own coffee with a shot of something or other and chocolate milk with syrup! 

They claim that everything is made from scratch, which definitely impresses me and I wish I could take a look into their kitchen to see if they are really are brewing up chicken stock!  They also label what's vegetarian and  vegan, which is definitely a rising trend and helps everyone out.

Service is surprisingly good.  There's someone there to help you find a table when you're carrying your tray (and sometimes they'll even help you out with your tray too)!  And there are a lot of busboys and busgirls clearing you table efficiently and quickly.  There were some staff members even asking how things were.

Although you may think you're eating healthy though, you can easily OD on the fatty stuff.  After all, it's still a buffet and you'll find yourself eating a few too many breads or potatoes with real butter and sour cream.  

Their Sunday morning menu offers waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, and make your own burritos too! 

Dinners cost about $9.39/pp, but you can always find a coupon in the weekly ads.  It's a real deal for children to eat here though!  And you can also do take out too! 

Overall, it's not a bad choice when you're eating like this for under $10/pp and with such a variety, everyone will be happy!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,3,3,-sdZs5kGoNW8cDLhNuDT3A

Not sure if there was a change in management or something of the sort.  We were greeted at the front entrance and asked if it was our first time, it was for some of my family.  Then the cashier went out of her way in accomodating us with our coupons.  The waitress, super friendly and very good about picking up dirty dishes.  The best part though was when the manager ( young hispanic guy) came to our table said he heard it was our first time, gave us free cookies all wrapped up along with a coupon for next time.  Great job with the staff Sweet Tomatoes!!

You can always go back and get more, duh. But they have a really ridiculous 'premium' items section, which is essentially chicken pieces, for an extra dollar. Unless you are going to die without those items on your salad, skip them and fill your plate with the healthy greens.
They have seasonal foods, such as chili in the winter, and strawberries in the spring. They always have low fat ice cream, and brownies, which you can make into a brownie sundae. 
Waiters come around and clear your table pretty well, and will leave you a plate of warm chocolate chip cookies.

5504345,2016-01-28,0,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"Love this restaurant,  been coming here ever since we moved here in 2003. Used to frequent every Sunday after church, and then they had a breakfast buffet for a little bit which we tried a few times, but we were more for the soup and salads. The pastas used to be overdone and tasteless but it's a little better now, but still not something I eat a lot of  anyway. We've seen management come and go, even the ladies who pick up dishes. There's one whose been there since we've been going. But we don't see her as often nowadays. 

The Chinese chicken salad is their staple there and it's one of my favorites along with the Ceasars salad. The best things I like that they have to offer on a rotation is the Greek salad, taco salad, lemon, chicken and rice soup, albondigos soup, mushroom soup just to name a few. 

I like how they stay  on top of keeping the salads , toppings and dressings filled, although,  most times there are always drippings of the dressings into each other. I have never seen it not dripped. and a lot of the times lately,  the pizza is a little overdone. it's used to come out nice and cheesy and not burnt on the edges. it still goes fast, but if you can get it out of the oven, you can get the middle pieces. I love the muffins,cornbread and brownies as well. After filling up here, who  needs dinner? we usually have a snack for dinner if we feel hungry.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,1,0,4,v5rWBQg3ChwL12ax2tWF5Q

5517442,2015-12-04,1,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"I love Sweet tomatoes. Well, I really keep coming back for their Caesar salad and this tuna pasta dish that I never bother to remember its name. Also, I just love their blueberry muffins. It is moist, warm, with a crisp to it. I sometimes indulge by adding a little of their whipped honey butter on it. Yummm! 

Oh, you don't have to get the Caesar salad. You can totally build your own salad! Lots of choices to choose for sure in that department. 

They have a variety of soups which will vary. They usually have a themed month (mexican, asian, i.e...) so usually you'll find a specialty soup customed to the theme. Honestly, I don't really eat the soups. My husband does, the kids usually get the chicken noodle soup...which I've tasted and is actually pretty good. Chunky noodles and chunky pieced of chicken. 

They also.serve a few pastas like mac n cheese, a penne type pasta, and even serve bake potatoes in which you can just add all the fixings yourself. Note, the potatoe isn't pre-cut opened so you'll have to slice that thing yourself or just put all the toppings you want in it on a side dish and do it at your seat.

I can only give them 3 stars though I'd wanna say 5, especially if you are on a trek or on a track to a healthy lifestyle...but they keep raising their prices to the point that almost 40 bucks (that's WITH THE coupon) isn't worthed. I could actually eat for the same amount of money elsewhere, still eat a salad, then at least my boys can indulge into something more of their liking. 

But we'll eat here because as I said...they make a really good Caesar salad and those blueberry muffins are deelish. Love fulfilling my Caesar salad crave from here. You don't have to buffet-it. They do have to-go boxes that you just fill yourself. I don't know how they charge in that way...i should find out. 

My advice is join their email club before going in so you can take advantage of any offers. They recently renovated, the place looks great. We certainly do no frequent here as much as we used to. However, we'll be back...we always come back at least a few times a year. I'd recommend this place for someone who is looking for an alternative route. 

Note, they don't serve much protein. Whatever protein you find would be the ones they add into their soups, or a small cup of chicken to add into your salad.

On this visit, I was pleased to see that the buffet restaurant has gotten a fresh new look!  From the new wooden floors, to fresh coats of paint, and even a few new seating updates.  How cool? Smart move Sweet Tomatoes as the place was kinda worn before the remodel.

I found the salads to be very fresh along with all of the veggies and the ton of other toppings that vie for space on the plate.  My two pasta salad weaknesses are Broccoli Madness and Tuna Tarragon; I could get seriously fat eating these ""healthy salads"". 

Then made my way over to the soup section where there is always about 6 or 7 kettles of piping hot soup from which to choose.  Decided on the Irish Potato Leek this time which I found to be creamy and very tasty. Yummy!  Another bowl please.  Don't tell anyone, but I always snag a piece or two of sourdough bread to dunk in the soup. My favorite soup for sourdough dunking is the Chicken Noodle.

Five or Six soups to choose from. 3 types of muffins, baked potato, prepared pastas, fresh fruit, yogurt and toppings. Cold drinks, coffee, tea... I know that fast food restaurants work hard at keeping things clean. However sweeping the carpet with a broom and dustpan was a little disturbing. I know they need to tidy up, however when you begin to raise floaters that I needed to wave away from my plate. 

As you enter the restaurant you make the decision as to which side of the buffet you are going to stroll. Pick up our tray and plate and get a squirt of some hand sanititzer just before you embark on the valley of veggies. It's nice that they have the sanitizer, however everyone does not partake. So it might be a good idea to have more sanitizer at the end of the line by the cashier or give out wipes at the table. Each veggie of course has its own spoon/serving utensil and I try really hard not to let that skeeve me out, know how many hands that have possibly touched each.

5907814,2015-01-27,1,56Ll9rqG2WxXj4X2pmlkHQ,"It's comical watching folks see how high they can pile food on one plate. Who doesn't know there's no limit to the number of times you can go back for more?

One school of thought says it's better to visit the line a few times to experiment with tasteful combinations instead of lumping ingredients together in a single homogenized heap.  The heap approach is adventurous. It can result in a legendary blend, something like how the Cobb--or even Caesar!--salad was invented.

Why delay gratification when you can gorge yourself immediately on a single heaping monument?

The arrangement of the buffet line lends itself to erecting your own fortress of salad-tude.  Build a symmetrical cone or bulging mound.  At the end near the door, start with a foundation of leafy greens, followed by chunky morsels of broccoli and cauliflower to support your slices & strips of veggies such as celery, carrots, squash, & cucumber. Throw in some Jell-O to hold it all together. Carefully scoop on peas & beans so they won't roll off the pile.  Apply generous dollops of dressing to form a cohesive mortar to hold the whole mish-mosh in place. Mix your favorite dressings in zany combinations such as bleu cheese, thousand Island, & ranch. Garnish the tidy shambles with shredded cheese, croutons and tasty flecks of textured protein, aka ""bacon"" bits. Add a decorative necklace of cherry tomatoes around the edge.

Every item is labeled either vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free.  Do people really go to a salad bar to ""eat healthy""?  They're gonna chow down regardless.  Don't kid yourself.  All the runny creams and sauces, the yummy garnishes have as many fats and calories as a Big Mac.

At the start of the feeding frenzy it's fairly peaceful.  But as the lunch rush builds, the din sounds like a cell block disturbance, making it so hectic & stressful that satisfaction comes only when you beat a hasty retreat out the side door.

I was about to leave a dollar for the table server when it occurred to me that when there's an orgy of gluttony greed can't be far behind.  Someone would snatch that girl's dollar.  Plate pilers are not to be trusted. On the way out I gave her the dollar personally.
