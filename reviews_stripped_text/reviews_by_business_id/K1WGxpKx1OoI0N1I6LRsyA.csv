I will be back to try their red velvet...and maybe their burger? You pay for what you get right? However, the shakes are a must get for the price you pay!!!  The shake has this flavor that takes you back in time during the good old days where cold stone, baskin Robbins, and all the other ice cream joints didn't exist.",PcmsD3rA01ZW2I2B3KUn1Q,0,1,4,p_L0x7LJ4NGFZgC1i6k0iA

My family ordered the score its 24 cheeseburgers with 4 fries for 22.99, when the food came (took about 15 minutes) half the burgers were cold other half semi luke warm, maybe because they have 1 small grill to work on. Fries were very salty, told one of the employees, she was very nice and remade them. I would never come back, I gave them 2 stars because the employees were nice.

They are pretty bland and we found ourselves having to add condiments and whatnot to make it taste yummy. I did like their chili cheese fries a lot so I will back for those. Not the greatest but it's not very pricey so that's a plus.,JZkgINdB793HS48PO-M4Lg,1,1,2,LdgbuBnN8Zh-BPyDPZzPfA

2811873,2015-03-03,14,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"Quickee Burgers? More like ""Yucky Burgers"". 

Let me explain. I saw this advertised on Facebook so I was intrigued. I was thinking it couldnt be any worse than White Castle right? Well, it was about the same tastewise but what happened after my experience there was laughable.

Let's start with my initial visit. With an open mind I wanted to see if they are better than WC. If you refer to my pictures, they look eerily similar to my WC pics. I got the QB #2 which are 3 sliders, fries and a drink for 5.99. Not a bad deal. Since I wanted to try the chicken slider I requested to have one of the burgers substituted. It was at this point that the cashier asked the owner whose name is Michael, if it was possible. He agreed and said it was an upcharge which was understandable. First impression was that I thought he seemed pretty nice. Until he started joking around with me that he would only do it if I hooked him up with any one of my Asian lady friends. I wasnt offended at first but as the conversation went on I thought it got kind of awkward.

So fast forward to the meal. If you refer to my pictures, the look and taste was the same as WC. The fries sucked. It was dry and salty. I couldnt seem to find anything appealing about my meal. The only thing that warranted praise was that they had the one coke machine that has a lot of soda choices and that the chicken slider was kind of decent meaning I was able to finish it. Im sorry I coudnt say the same for the regular slider. One bite and I struggled to swallow it.

When I left, in my mind it was a 2 star review. Well here's what happened  before I started doing this review. I saw the ad again on Facebook. He was basically offering people a free brown bag lunch if  they were selected after tagging somebody. Well I commented that I didnt think that the slider was any better than WC and that the chicken slider was ok. Minutes later my comment was removed and I was blocked from commenting. If you cant handle the truth I guess block the person that speaks it? Well then, try blocking this dude. All you did was make it worse. Instead of two stars you lost one. If you are going to be an owner, you need to learn how to deal with constructive criticism. Instead you delete my comment and based off of what some people have told me after eating there, the way you treat your customers is rude and inapropriate as I found out for myself. The proof is also in your replies to some of the reviews on here. 

In closing, whatever sliver of hope you had with me coming back and recommending you to my friends is gone. As a matter of fact, to be fair to you, if my friends ask me about you, I will tell them to try you first, then we will talk. My intention is not to put you out of business, but if your product is not good and you treat your customers rudely, dont be surprised if nobody shows up. I would say after about 6 months or so, I will check out some recent legit reviews. If it looks like you have improved, then I just might come back and verify. I wanted to try the shakes but rude service will always negate that. Until then, try blocking this review dude.

3037776,2015-02-21,4,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"I requested a grilled cheese (as it is Friday during Lent) and was told that would not be possible. Apparently it's against company standards. 

I wasn't requesting someone catch and skin a fish for me, I was simply asking for a meatless option at the same price as a typical cheeseburger. 

I work real hard for little bit of change that's left in my pocket at the end of the day. With that being said, if your business isn't willing to accommodate my request I will take my coins some place else.

3304318,2015-01-28,0,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"This Quickee just opened up and despite some issues it has  potential. 

I stopped by a few days ago thanks to a $3 groupon I picked up. Upon walking in the place was a ghost town. Nobody was there but the tables and restaurant were surprisingly dirty. I presented my groupon and the cashier quickly explained what I can get: one small chicken slider, one small regular slider, side of fries and a drink. On the menu the combo is worth about $5 which doesn't sound bad but the amount of food you get is minuscule. The burger slider was alright, nothing special; the chicken slider was delicious and worth getting again. The fries were surprisingly good and fresh. 

The menu is pretty basic: sliders, fries, shakes and a few combos. You can place a 'bulk' order for the sliders and pick up 20 of them. The touch screen coke machine for drinks was virtually empty. They only had diet versions of a hand full of drinks which was pretty disappointing. 

Overall it wasn't a bad experience but hopefully the issues are resolved and they start giving you a bit more food for your money.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,1,2,3,EM0bB9z3TMn1nvgZOaVYRQ
3540237,2015-02-04,3,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"Just awful.  I picked up two dozen to bring to my work for some friends.  I was super excited about them, but once we opened the  box it was just full of disappointment.  The sliders were not made consistently.  Some of my sliders barely had any meat in them.  Some were really salty, while some tasted like nothing.  I don't think I want to come back.  There are much better restaurants in that plaza, go check those out.",R38mW_Uyp46JHToxobXQXg,6,2,1,RwylYJuuaeGKvXxMMXGCNA
3577088,2015-03-13,2,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"I read about this place on Yelp and really wanted to try it.  Even though White Castle is here in Vegas, this place is very close to my house and I love going to new restaurants.  I'll admit I was a bit scared by the negative reviews and the sociopathic replies of the owner on both Yelp pages for the two Quickee locations (seriously, the guy appears to be a step away from being one of the owners of Amy's Baking Company).

The first things I noticed when I went in at lunchtime on a weekday were that the place had no customers, some of the tables only had 1 seat while others had 2, 3, or 4 seats, and everything was impeccably clean.

I ordered a cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, and fries.  First off, anyone who says the taste is like White Castle is wrong -- not that the burgers need to taste like White Castle to be good.  White Castle sliders have thin beef that covers the whole light and airy bun.  Quickee sliders have slightly thicker beef and the patty does not fully cover the bun, which is a bit thicker as well.  The burger was very bland, dry, and dominated by the taste of the American cheese on it.  A bigger patty or better seasoning would do wonders.

The chicken sandwich tasted better at first, but I must have gotten a bad one because there were 3 pretty big pieces of gristle in it.  The fries were good -- no complaints here.  All-in-all I'd say my experience is slightly below average.  I probably won't go back again unless there is a significant change in the quality of the burgers/chicken.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,Q1KVyD3m6DMmWrBi6o1e0Q
4245023,2015-02-11,0,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"After hearing about this place on Facebook I finally decided to try em out since they opened up around the corner.

I ordered a dozen burgers, regular fries, and the chili cheese fries.

The service was great I was greeted with a smile, and she was really nice.  Ordered the food to go, and surprisingly it was still hot when I got home.

Now for the food, the sliders themselves were MEH, the regular order of fries were lukewarm and not fresh, the chili cheese fries were also MEH, they have a spice to em that makes it sweet and i can't quite place it i wanna say it's an Asian/Indian spice and wasn't expecting that, but it was a decent amount of fries and chili enough for 2 people maybe 3.

Overall I wouldn't go out my way to try them again even if they are around the corner, the service was excellent the food was whatever, maybe I'll try em again in a few months if they are still around.

Also it was pretty dead, and I highly doubt they were made to order I was in and out in less than 5 minutes, but the place was clean.

They get 3 stars for the service if I had to base it off the food it would be 1 star",w8_ZbCP40wsQXzIqECRDuA,1,0,3,yqSJ16jl5lclpsowbN5jFg
4413451,2015-06-01,1,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,"It's my second visit to Quickee Burgers - had the brown bag special which includes 4 mini burgers, fries and a drink. The Quickee Burgers has relocated to 3231 North Decatur in the same outdoor strip mall as DIY Flavor Shack. 

Fast and friendly service. 

White Castles fans may like this one better - these are slightly bigger and better burgers in my opinion. 

I will have to try the chicken - Quickee Chickee and chilee fries next.

This place is backed by Mike Tyson , Vince Neil, Ian Ziering and Michael Politz (who happened to be there the first time I was at the Quickee Burger.

If you are looking for a good Quickee lunch or dinner go to  Quickee Burgers.",IQf2SaovzIRIpmqx4IQbyg,0,1,5,wGaU-h7vsM7ZCzK6SBbMEg
5170318,2015-01-28,0,K1WGxpKx1OoI0N1I6LRsyA,So Heres The Thing People have to expect about this place. I think the food is pretty good its nothing special but i have to say i love the prices. For me and the wifey we both got the 4 sliders Fries and a drink meal. it came out to $12.95 and it was a perfect portion of food. Its definitely comparable to the famous white castle and taste almost exactly the same as the microwave burgers with a toasted bun. The only thing is they need to be more organized and thats  staff related so dont pass this up  because once they fix that it will probably get a 4 star rating from me. So the people in front of me ordered like 30 sliders and the one before me ordered like 20. So for 3 people to make 50 sliders before they get to mine its definitely understandable that its going to take a while. So all you people that get upset that you're not getting your Quickee Burger fast just think before you write a bad review. The best thing of the night was one of the guys came out to apologize for the wait and asked if there was anything he can provide us with on the house I actually asked for chilli cheese fries and he came out with a full order for free which by the way the chilli cheese fries were good its beanless chili with nacho cheese on top. Thank you for doing that because it definitely makes me feel like you cared about how long i waited to eat. I will be back to give this place a second chance to earn your fourth Star Stay Tuned YELPERS..,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,2,0,3,j8EwAocW0_Iw1CrVvde9Ig
