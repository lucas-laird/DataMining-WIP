They quickly seated 3 women at a table for 8 which was available for us. Later found out they would have 5 only from manager. 

Our party had to sit apart for a group that'd fit at the table we were sat at.

The Main thing was that I went out to the self parking at MGM and my car window was broken, someone had broken in and stole everything.  The MGM grand hotel was very unhelpful given the circumstances, the security had an attitude of ""so what"".  I told the story to the waitress and she mentioned it to the manager and they unexpectedly comped my whole meal, alcohol included.  I would go back to this place anytime I was in vegas definitely because of the kind gesture.  I would however never stay at the MGM grand again and I would only ever valet at any casino after this experience.  I should also note that this happened in a parking lot that I paid for, had security, and cameras.  So if you drive here to go eat at tap I'd suggest valet to be safe",zuPpelMhTLyXM44X86G2ZQ,0,0,5,9IQz8UluNjuEuy-iB46efQ

I have always found it difficult to get good food in a sports bar in Vegas, but TAP has it.  We ordered the buffalo wings, pretzels and fried green beans.  All were tasty and I could have ordered a second helping of wings, they were so good.  
Great atmosphere as well, as I could watch the hockey game with other fans just out to have a good time.  (I find the Sports Books can sometimes be too serious)",5EPfjhwPo5fWeAIEB2o-vA,1,0,4,lmZ_Y_5F6qioqzhDKCs4IQ

Décor and atmosphere was warm and inviting, comfortable, and fun as a sports bar should. My wife and I were not that hungry but knew we should eat before the show so we ordered Kobe Burger with onion rings split for two and two Porters. Waitress had no problem splitting the order and even provided two additional plates. Meal was still so filling, we did not eat anything for the rest of the night. Food was served hot and obviously fresh.  Flavors were awesome and the burger cooked to a medium rare perfection as requested. Onion rings were super crunchy and full of favor and makes my onion ring top five list that I have ever had. Our waitress Margaret J, was outstanding. She provided warm friendly and professional service. Thank you, Margaret!  I only have one negative and it's not a bid deal, but the onion rings were service with a spicy ketchup and I don't like ketchup, never have, never eat it. I think its tastes is vile.

First off, I ordered the $12 Tennessee Betty cocktail, it was overly sweet and too much of everything except the alcohol. 

I ordered the corned beef short ribs and was told that they had changed the meat and instead of being corned beef they were beef short ribs. I was ok with that. When they came out the entire dish was different, all the sides were different not just the meat. It would have been nice to have been told this.

Our waiter also let us sit forever. He walked by to tables next to us multiple times before coming by to check on how things were, if we needed any drinks when our glasses were empty or if we were finished.

I will be sure to not visit this restaurant on my next stay at the MGM Grand.",3EIVv_r_24haTthgNuUQlQ,1,0,2,yf0ihLFf_95K_tyfvSgFGQ

Yes, prices can be high but it's Vegas! We actually were there on the first of the NCAA play-off weekends, some places were charging up to $400 minimum food/beverage per person tab to sit and watch for the day. Taps was only $75 for the day which our party of 4 quickly met, plus Taps wasn't doing a ""per person"" minimum but a party minimum which was huge as I cannot hardly eat / drink as much as my male counterparts.

Between the four of us we sampled the wings, a burger with fries/onions rings, Taps signature pretzel, Caesar salad, chicken sandwich and chicken strips with a side of veges. All served up hot and delicious. Really cannot complain about the food. 

I'm a little less judgmental of food as, for me, ambiance and service can make or break an establishment. Taps is a solid 5 on both. Huge screens to watch a plethora of games / events from any angle. As we sat there ALL DAY we went through 3 servers. A bit of a delay in service between server #1 and server #2 but Jeff, the manager, quickly stepped in and made it right by personally taking our orders then continually ""checking in"". Really fun guy to talk to, at one point our conversation turned to the various mimosa concoctions and Jeff not only described a ""breakfast"" mimosa he treated our entire party to one. 

Needless to say, I found our day (literally) at Taps extremely enjoyable and would definitely recommend it as the place to be during Final Four Festivities or anytime in between.",ueeW9IM3zMWufqh0DWPznQ,2,0,5,nGEAhKn8CEW5hzeflbrgKw

Didn't have time to order mains but had drinks and appetizers before our show. Ordered off the specialty drink menu, and man they were good. I got a raspberry cocktail that was delish and hubs had a margarita that was solid. Warm pretzel appetizer was so good. It was served with pretzel nuggets and a creamy white cheese with mustard.

But here's the real deal. The nachos. Hubs & I are obsessed with the big, messy pile variety of nachos and not big lovers of the neatly arranged plate of a dozen moderately topped round tortilla chips. The big pile at TAP is as good as it gets. We got ours with chili, and that chili is so good! Big chunks of beef that just fell apart with the fork, perfectly seasoned. They are fully loaded with sour cream, guac, pickled jalapeños, and basically all the stuff you expect on a big pile.

And yep. It's a sports bar. Woohoo! Screens visible from every angle. We'll go back just for football next time we're in Vegas. I'm watching football now and wishing I had a pile of those nachos to go with my game.

I spied a $40 for a New York Strip and a Beer deal that peaked my interest and after discussing the idea with the very adept waitress, I knew I had a great strategy for dinner. Add the NFL action on the countless screens and this was a stone cold lock.

How was the food then? Righteous. The steak was broiled to a perfect medium rare and topped with butter (think Ruth's Chris) the served with ""smashed"" (mashed) garlic infused potatoes and vegetables. The included beer didn't hurt the value proposition either. Not a bad way to catch a game and get some work done while having an agreeable meal.

We were staying at the MGM during the Pac-12 Men's Basketball Tournament.  The wait was surprisingly not bad, and the hostess the first time was very friendly and gave us a requested high top so we could have a good view of all the games (with which 2 massive TVs showing about 4 games on average, you can't go wrong).

Our waitress suggested the nachlos--no.  The cheese was hardly melted and the whole thing was just blah.  My husband and I picked at them and that was it.  The loaded fries are better.  Decent price, and we got to spend time watching several games.

The second time we stopped in to watch the ACC championship game before going to the Pac-12 Championship game and managed to snag seats at the bar.  HUGE mistake.  First it took 15 minutes just to get the attention of the bartender, Rico.  Then another 5 minutes for him to finally get our beer order.  Then he disappeared.  People started sitting around us and were getting the same service.  Finally the bar manager was called over by the men next to us who remarked at the bad service.  The bar manager completely blew it off--no bueno.

We finally got our food in, and we got burgers, which were decently good.  But the service was just awful.  It got to the point that the ladies by my husband saw another manager and surrounded him like flies talking about the service.  Magically 4 bartenders appeared right after that--telling me that management wasn't doing a great job managing their staff.

They have a great beer selection, but drinks and food here are VERY pricey.  You can upgrade any beer to a liter which is a ""good deal"" relative to their own prices, but will still run you $15+ each.
While we were here our table service was very good.  Never out of beer, many orders of apps, and some fun.  We did notice it was inconsistent between servers, so I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not.

Food was good burger was excellent good wings too. Service was fine no issues. Plenty of TV's. Also location is prime across from sports book.

All was good until Sunday. Sunday myself and my friend arrived right before kickoff at 10:00am after placing some bets in the sports book. We sat in two seats at the bar ordered our drinks and were in NFL heaven surrounded by the TV's and our betting tickets. Our wives decided to meet us at TAP for some food and we asked the hostess to put us in for a table as we sat at the bar. This is were the problem started.  We were not allowed to put in for a table because all parties weren't there. I thought that was weird because it was 45 minute wait for a table and our wives were planning on being their well before that. So while not really accommodating I can somewhat understand the rule and I wasn't upset about that at the time. What really upset is what  came next  once our wives arrived. Knowing we now had all parties present I put in for a table again. That's when I was told that the only way we could put in for a table is if someone from our party left the bar area and waited directly in front of the hostess station. 

All I wanted to do is watch football at the bar while we waited for a table and they wouldn't do that. By this point I was $100.00 in for my bar tab plus $150.00 I spent two days before for  lunch at this place. Give me a break. We instead walked out and rang up $500.00 Tab at the PUB at the other side of the casino who was more then willing to let us hang at the bar until our table was ready. Maybe it was the hostess screwing up or maybe it's how the place is managed I don't know. All I do know is every other restaurant I've ever been at allows you to put in table and wait at the bar until your table is ready. Seems like restaurant 101 and common sense, but not at this place.

   So my fiancée and I decided to have dinner here so we could watch the basketball and hockey games.

Before even answering his question she snapped at him "" you'll have to finish that beer before you come in"" to which he replied ""OK so how long is the wait?"" She replies to him annoyed "" about 10 minutes, but you'll have to finish that beer."" The beer wasn't even half full so he replied"" no problem""

The wait was short only about 15 minutes to be seated. It took us 10 minutes to be greeted where we ordered both our food and drinks. From that point it took 15+ minutes to receive our cocktails by which point we had already received our food. One item didn't come out so we asked a manager if he could inquire where our chicken fingers were at which point he says ""I need to tap another table first"" and walks away. As someone in the service industry that was the rudest thing I have ever experienced. He finally comes over and he tells us he is sorry and that the chicken is on the house. We told him one of the cocktails didn't taste right and if he could just remove it from the bill at  which point he rolled his eyes and said yes and walked away.  Fast forward to finishing the meal and going to pay the bill every item on the bill was increased by up to $2 from the price listed on the menu. We asked to speak to a manager again and the first one whose name is Ryan comes back over and trys to say we got their weekday menu and that it was the weekend prices we were being charged. Which seems farfetched considering we were sat with 3 of the same menus, I also grabbbed a menu from the service station which also was the same and the table across from us had 4 of the same menus. It was just a very shady discrepancy to have and I said so. Ryan tells us I'm sorry again and that he will fix the bill. We paid the bill and left no fuss. I am just shocked at the sub par service of this restaurant perpetrated by the managers. It might be a good idea to re-train the staff. Now I know not to frequent this establishment and Ryan if you are reading this I would definitely work on your people skills. You do not treat your customers as you did us and try overcharging us and then fumbling for an excuse once you were caught.

-Decent selection of beer, although nothing that unique or special. A lot of the usual suspects when you think mainstream craft beer.

-Good presentation and big portions. 
 
Cons:
-I ordered one of their signature burgers. It was fine, but you can get phenomenal, life-changing burgers on the strip. If you want a burger, go somewhere better. This burger was very average and a bit dry. I also ran out of bun well before the patty was all gone.

I am proclaiming a bit here -  I have other reviews of ""fish and chips"" - Tap - fish and chips -THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD, so ignore my other reviews of fish and chips ANYWHERE, if I posted one.  I think they use Panko bread crumbs for their breading - it is the BOMB.  Light, flaky, tasty.  The presentation is great.  Their tartar sauce has a hint of green onion, that is just fantastic.

With it being in the heart of MGM and the fact of it being a sports bar attracted quite the line. We waited roughly around 40 minutes for a table, but from observation people were taking their time in there watching the games so I mean you either accept that as the norm or honestly find somewhere else to eat. It did actually go fast when you,occupy yourself with people watching or conversing amongst your group.

The restaurant itself is quite huge and does seem to accommodate quite the mass of bodies. Staff wise, they were very tandem with procedures and did seem to be on top of things which seems taboo at times in Vegas eateries.

As for the food their were a couple different options that called my name, but in the end I set my sights on the Philly cheesesteak. It is served in the styling of three mini sandwiches which at first glance seem like you'll leave with an empty stomach, but was very misleading as I struggled to finish #3. The bread itself was lightly salted pretzel bread, but was surprisingly soft (definitely a high point) through each bite. The steak itself was thinly sliced sirloin I believe, but was actually tender and a perfect spice to it as an added bonus. To top it off (as seen in the picture) the cheese was abundant to the point where it was borderline overpowering although who doesn't love the whiz? All in all a well put together cheesesteak, but does it beat an authentic one from the East? Yeah right..Haha

I would say Taps for both bar food and drinks? Yes. Taps for a casual dining experience? Maybe not.",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,2,0,4,D6FS76id5JaO2Xf0ZD7M8w

First - we get there right after a concert on a Friday night to get some food. 
We told the hostess chick we were there to eat. She then says ""the bar has the full menu."" 
Ok - no problem. Sounds cool. 
Then we sit down & the bartender/server comes up to take our drinks. We asked for the food menu & then he says ""we're already way past last call for food.""  We then looked at each other & he could sense the frustration & says - ""if you want to order a quick appetizer I think I can get it in but you have to order now.""
We quickly ordered something. 
Then we order our drinks. 
Guy asked us about four times over what drink we wanted. 
Dude could barely understand Englidh and if course he gives us the wrong drink. 
We just kept it because our efforts would just be wasted. 
We're easy going people so we'll not make a fuss but later just not go back. 
So here's a question.... Why did they tell us we could eat the whole menu if they were already past last call? 
Second question... Why the hell do you close your kitchen by 11:00 on a Fridsy night?  - that's just stupid. At a minimum just switch to a bar menu. 
Honestly this place sucks.

We think it was maybe the buffalo chicken sliders we ordered because either the slaw sauce on it went bad, or the chicken was undercooked... the portions are generous but still pricey for a sports bar.

We honestly came here as a back up because a certain celebrity chef-who-will-not-be-named's restaurant at the Tropicana stopped serving food at 9:30pm at night (what?), but that's irrelevant.  We braved the cold temps and ran across the bridge to the MGM grand and found this place super easily.  We were seated quickly and after a little bit of consideration, we ordered the chili in a cornbread bowl and the captains burger.  

Our server was great!  She was friendly and helpful, chatty but not too much and she got our food out to us in a timely manner.  I've never seen a cornbread bowl before, but I'm convinced that that should be the only way chili should be served from now on!  The captains burger was also amazing, cooked perfectly with great flavors coming from the toppings that just made the burger out of this world.  

I'm glad we ended up here.  it might have been a little pricey, but man  way it delicious and we were absolutely stuffed when we walked out.  Great choice!",0fKmCIvKlkXwBZU44D0umg,3,1,5,s8aLLmLJXiCVUBAk0C-L6Q

2999711,2015-06-07,0,80Lkm305ZOkQdMEIvOy_lw,"I recently visited Vegas, for the MayPac fight . My husband I went to Tap our second day there. They had a wait, which was understandable due to the large amount of people in the MGM. The wait was only about 15 minutes or so, oppose to the 30min the hostess had stated. Upon being seated, we weren't very satisfied with the table, it was right by the window where people were waiting to be seated. We asked to be moved. The hostess was very nice, and moved us immediately. Once moved, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she returned, we ordered our food. We didn't order anything major, Tap Nachos w/chicken, and beef sliders. The waitress left, she was gone for about 20 minutes, we started to notice people that were seated after us were already enjoying their meals. I was starting to get a little annoyed....... Then another waitress showed up and introduced herself! We were confused, and asked ""where was the other waitress?"" She informed us, that she was off, and going home! I then asked about our order, she informed us that it had been put in by the previous waitress. Ok........ We were now hitting the 45 minute mark, and guess who comes back to our table? The very first waitress that was supposed be gone for the day! Wow! I immediately told her that we had been informed that she was gone for the day, she snapped back responding that she hadn't left yet because she was waiting on our food! Really..... Lol, she walks away, we get up and leave. Wasted a whole hour of my Vegas trip!
      So believe it or not, 2 days later, we gave TAP another try. This time was much better. Very nice waitress, we actually received food and service. We pretty much ordered the same thing, but I ordered Chilli instead of Chicken on my nachos. When the food arrived, it looked great. My nachos were awesome, big portion, great Chilli and cheese combo. My husbands burger sliders look great too, with big homemade fries. Only one thing, the meat was medium rare. We informed the waitress, and she stated she told us that was how they are prepared. Only problem is that he wanted them well done,and That option was never offered. The waitress took them back, and had them prepared to his liking. Once they came back, they were great. I guess I would go again, it's convenient if you are staying at the MGM , and has very nice sporty atmosphere.",8cUk-txkl6YAe2g5Brqplw,1,1,3,TcfE79baRXmqKm-SibIOJA

Since I took down a couple of liter beers, I made sure to take Notes in my iPhone just in case I might not remember how wonderful the meal was the next day. These are the notes I came up with:

1. Ranch dressing YUMMM. 
2. Cheese curds were nice and hot and fresh (they were probably the best damn cheese curds I've ever had).
3. Liter beer was icy - some people might have a problem with this. Me, on the other hand, like this because I can sometimes be a slow drinker. 
4. Huge burger. HUGE. And a huge thing of fries. Robert couldn't even put the burger down because he was afraid he wouldn't be able to pick it back up. It looked delicious and he said it was. 
5. Franks in a blanket - lot of hot dog and light crispy bun. Just right for a girl who needs food in her tummy when drinking. 
6. Contemplated getting onion rings or more appetizers but wasn't sure if we could finish them so decided against it. Wise choice.
7. Fried s'mores so amazing crispy outside soft inside of chocolate and marshmallow with a side of chocolate OMG so good!!!!!
8. Awesome menu assortment of all my favorite appetizers I want it alllllll - onion rings, hit dogs, sliders, cheese curds it is so hard to choose.

I kid you not, I'm sitting here salivating thinking about their cheese curds and fried s'mores. Like I said at the beginning, it is a bit pricey but it's worth it.

3083311,2018-03-25,2,80Lkm305ZOkQdMEIvOy_lw,"TAP is a typical Vegas sports bar, with premium prices, average beer selection and a wall of televisions blaring in the background. Casinos rely solely on gambling to turn a profit, so it's rare to find a comfortable, hospitable bar on the Strip. TAP is no exception, so expect a hard stool with  a $12 Dos Equis, served up by a rotating cast of part-time bartenders. 

Above all else, don't expect to connect with anyone over a cocktail. The basic purpose of these bars is to ice out the drunks and refuel bachelor parties, so meaningful conversation is unlikely. If you can hear your voice over Journey, Bon Jovi or Nelly, it's unlikely anyone else can. So why even try?

Alcohol is ubiquitous in Nevada and cheaply available off the Strip. What's more, public consumption is tolerated in tourist areas within reasonable norms. Rather than waste money in a casino bar that passively resents you, be kind to yourself.

The prices are also a bit high.  Going beyond the nachos or chili, and you're getting into $30+ for a burger, fries and a beer.  There are plenty of better restaurants for that rate (or much lower).  The location is convenient, but not sure I'll be back soon.",554mVwZqwlZdPL-RjqJ5CQ,2,1,3,kuk07v-yUPGOqUEc8OTnUQ

After trying to get reservations or walk-ins at some of the restaurants closer to the concert corridor, my partner and I were pleasantly surprised to land here. Definitely would recommend starting the evening on this side of the hotel before a show or concert, here in this fun sports br.

Our first welcoming was plenty of open-seating and lots of large televisions with varieties of games on to entertain. Yay! Second was the warm hospitality from our server, Choy- she did an awesome job recommending dishes and giving us all details on drink specials (and then later keeping speedy service to get us on our way to the next event.) They had some decent drink specials and their barfoods-centric menu has everything from sliders and wings to ribeyes, ribs and fish/chips.

We went for the Mini Philly sliders- they were awesome! Chopped steak, roasted onions & red bell peppers, all mixed in melty-cheese and then piled into buttery Parker rolls. I'm not kidding, we were a happy bunch! Add fries for a couple bucks and this dish is plenty for 2 to share (the fries were also delish.)

The Cheerleader (Absolute, maraschino, pineapple and a large orange wedge) was overly sweet, so we ordered the shot-&-a-beer special ($12) --a good deal, as a plain shot is $11-- and mixed the shot to the drink, which balanced out the sweetness. As she brought our check, Choy read our minds and dropped off plastic cups for our drinks to take back on down the way to the MGM G.G.

This was the shortest wait restaurant we found on a busy Saturday night at 11PM so we decided to ask for a table for 2 and accepted the 15 minute wait.  We placed a name and initially experienced brief irritably from the hostest but didn't pay any mind to it because there were several people in line and everyone has their moments. 

We took a few steps back and waited 20..25 minutes right in front of the host desk then I asked my date why it was taking so long and he proceed to ask the hostest when our table would be ready. She was currently in the middle of a heated argument with other customers who she had supposedly called their name already but they didn't answer. She rudely told my date the same thing, that she had already called our name and gave away our table to someone else.  

The thing I didn't understand about this situation was that she was looking at us the entire time we were waiting and if she called us, and seen us there, I get that it's a busy night but if you can't remember the order of your waiting for customers, there is a problem. Secondly, she should never have been unfriendly or rude with any of us customers even if she was right and she did call our names and we just stupidly ignored her.

3562598,2018-02-12,0,80Lkm305ZOkQdMEIvOy_lw,TAP Sports Bar has to be one of my oddest and amazing stops I've ever had. We made two stops and everything was completely different. On our first stop the service was excellent. We ordered wings with a side of the ghost chili sauce and they were delicious but pretty freakin spicy. We also ordered nachos and they were also good not too cheesy and not too dry. This is where things get complicated....we were waiting for my cousins to get to Vegas via their flights from Seattle and they arrived two hours after our dinner. After they arrived they were hungry and also wanted drinks so we stopped at TAP again. On our second trip that night everything flipped. We had the rudest server I've ever had in my life. She was unhelpful and gave the worst answers when we had a question. When my cousin asked her what she thought of a beer she just said no I don't drink that and just didn't care. She took our drink orders and three members of my party ordered food. Now things got weird five minutes later my cousin wanted something to eat and she just told him no the kitchen is now closed. That's fine although usually they give some sort of warning the kitchen is closing. Now things get even stranger a different waitress comes to our table and she asks us for our drink and food orders all over again. Apparently the first waitress just couldn't be bothered with our order anymore. I thought wow she must have quit or something but nope she was still helping other tables or maybe helping or just being useless. I wrecked my brain trying to figure out what her problem was because we weren't rude and the bar wasn't closing for another 3 hours. I guess she was just in a horrible mood or maybe she's just a horrible person but who knows. Our second waitress was actually the waitress who helped us on or first trip so service was much better.

They've got televisions everywhere in every sports channel you could think of so this just might be that go to spot to watch the game and down a few drinks with the boys. This also looks like a good place to take clients for business meetings. It's casual but decent and presentable so it helps give that inviting vibe to easily start conversation.

They're offerings look good as well. I ordered the chicken strips, but even those I was impressed with. When it comes to chicken strips, the tenderness of the chicken and the breading tells all. Their breading is so different, it is crunchy just like how you'd like it but the texture and flavor is nothing like the typical. It kind of has a different taste to it...maybe beer battered? But I'd recommend this one.

*The reuben sandwich
*Fish and Chips

-Philly Cheesesteak sliders: not good. hawaiian roles, dry meat, american cheese, ew.

There was not a wait (it was a Tuesday night around 9:30 PM) so we got right in.  We liked the atmosphere and abundance of large TV screens.  Their menu contained typical bar fare (hamburgers, onion rings, etc.) along with a couple of surprising items like fried s'mores.   The difference between Tap and other sports bars was the prices were a little higher higher than a typical bar.  I would not expect burgers to be between $17-$21 in another sports bar, but this is the MGM.

Even though they were not very busy, service was slow so we had plenty of time to peruse the food and drink menus which were attached to wood boards, a cool idea.  After ordering a couple of beers, I picked the Tap burger on a pretzel bun with grilled onions and a fried egg and halfzies (half fries/ half onion rings)- $21.  It seemed a little pricy for this meal when I ordered, but it really was fantastic so I didn't care.  The burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned well and the onion rings were a devine treat.  The burger was pretty huge, I finished almost half.

The BF got the Bratwurst- $12 with kraut and spicy brown mustard on a pretzel roll.  He said it was delicious.

3874701,2015-04-24,1,80Lkm305ZOkQdMEIvOy_lw,"So, I've been debating this review for a few weeks now. I made the journey up to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 Championship Tournament (Go Cats!) which was hosted in the MGM Grand Arena. Now, knowing how ""large"" each casino is and the fairly limited sports bar options here, TAP was really the only place to keep watching basketball between sessions, so we actually went here more than once AFTER poor service, but if you can, try and avoid this place.

First visit: If you walk up to this place, you'll notice the ""open air"" concept they have. Unfortunately for them, it allows you to see how many open tables there currently are. If half of the table are open, you'd assume that you can walk right up and get seated. Not the case here. And actually what's worse, is we waited roughly 45 minutes to get a table. Now, when someone confronted the hostess about this situation (given, this man did not take the best approach), he was then surrounded by security within five minutes and followed around by these thugs until he went out of sight from us - hopefully there was no scenes from the movie 21 that occurred. The meal was actually really good (food and waitress were awesome), but when I told the on-duty manager (more calm than the first guy) about the situation and that it's actually troubling to watch another patron complain and get intimidated out of the casino, he could really care less. Typical Vegas.

Night two: Like I said, few options we found to watch basketball and get beers between games - However, we were actually seated in a timely manner. This time, our waiter was actually horrible, not rude, but just lacking any service skills. Our group of roughly 12 people request split checks up front and he responded, ""We don't split checks here.""  I proceeded to tell him the waitress yesterday actually did for the exact same group - again, more attitude. At this point I gave up, ordered a beer and dinner, only to find he brings me the wrong beer. I ate my open-faced steak sandwich, bolted, watched the Cats win the tournament and am glad I only have to go to Vegas once a year.

Seriously, try and avoid this place if possible - get a tallboy somewhere and stand outside to watch the games.",NkWnOwSTrIrLdFUi3MrD5Q,1,2,1,HEJyj_BpM7qar7WmAdjBig

He threw down our plates for the appetizers and never checked on us. At one point our waiter, Eric, was even arguing with the manager in plain sight. How unprofessional! This man never smiled the whole time we were there. He also was being rude to the other customers. At the end, he added gratuity that he didn't deserve. When we told him we weren't paying that and explaining why, he started arguing with us with an even bigger attitude. Yeah, horrible service.

It has a nice busy atmosphere, in that there are a ton of TVs, a ton of fried food options and a ton of beer. Your experience however highly depends on your waitress and the manager who's on duty.

We decided to spend a solid 5 hours at TAP for March Madness, totaling at least $275 in total tab. While our first waitress was excellent, our second waitress wasn't as accommodating. The manager on duty seemed clueless about where to put the March Madness games on - why would a division II basketball game take up a prime TV spot? Makes no sense. Then I have a small complaint about not opting for a high-end projector, rather a TV wall that takes away some of the clarity.

If you happen to be in the area and you need a sports bar, TAP is good. But don't go out of your way because it's nothing more than a re-branded bdubs.",tGvJAy7uzAHJsPneHxd_rQ,1,0,3,viFB9KoITP2Y8xpPEjcmdg

I'm one of these people who use the app but don't comment often, but felt this time was warranted. I consider myself easy to please but the customer service at Tap Sports Bar is absolutely horrendous. They asked me not to bring in my outside beverage, which was a brand new drink I just got outside the door to the restaurant. After I obliged and threw away my new drink, we sat at the bar and asked if they would be showing a specific game, to which they stated they would switch it to the TV in front of us. We ordered beers and an appetizer, then the waiter asked us how we would like to pay cash or card, before we have had a single bite. After about 10 minutes of watching the game on my phone he informed me they do not get that channel for the game. Why didn't you tell me that ahead of time?? We paid our tab without eating or finishing our beers, as they did not seem to care. Staff was not rude, but just did not seem to care about anything and was not personable at all. Luckily, as I walked out of the restaurant, the sports book had it on 4 of their 28 TVs, including one of the two giant screens, as it is a national broadcast.... Maybe they just had a bad day, but I would not recommend anyone come here to watch a game. Hope you all have better luck than we did.",fn0zW-gQzfY-u2TzE8Xa4A,0,0,1,IuAo6hCUsplyLgJZAVLpmQ

A very nice open space with lots of TV's to watch all the games in action.  Definitely a good spot to go especially if all the chairs in the sports book is full.

Instead of a hot dog I felt like I was eating a stick of corned beef wrapped with bacon.  Whatever though it was pretty damn good so I was totally ok with it.  It had a really tasty mustard sauce that came with it that I really enjoyed.

Margaret was so rude about her error, she read back the order and the asked ""well what's missing"". Everything was wrong. It was basically a burger between two slices of bread.

Environment: this restaurant/bar is sports themed. I think it is a pretty good spot to watch a game and they also played some music videos which was nice too. The mood was very chill, they had a center bar you can sit at or tables around the bar. The place is pretty large, and the food smells really good, also that fry-mess really forced us to have to get more food even though we just had dinner.

Service: it was a bit slow. The place was busy, but not exceeding their table limit. Our waitress did a great job initially, but it took a while to get the check. I think she ended up with a lot of tables needing things at the same time.

Food and drinks: again I only had their nachos for food. Obviously being on the strip, everything is more expensive, but sharing the nachos wasn't too bad. It was actually really delicious, the chips were warm and toasty, and the condiments, guac and really warm melted cheese topped it off perfectly. I would definitely not mind coming back for more. 
Their beer options were vast, and they had a 10percent beer which I had. It was strong, and dark, but pretty awesome to try. 

Overall, great spots for sports, kicking it with friends, good nachos, and a variety of beer. Only thing that would set it back is the price.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,0,0,4,xigrZzQxpHIcr-zhso0GSA

I stopped in and they had a special for salmon with finger potatoes and sweet corn for 25 bucks. That sounded pretty tasty and so I decided to give that a go. I'm really glad that I did. I enjoy nice fresh salmon and I'm going to be honest with you. This is the absolute best salmon that I've ever tasted. I've never had salmon this juicy and this tender. I've heard people say that they've had a meat dish that melted in their mouth and most of the time that has been hyperbolic in my experience but this is one of the rare occasions that I feel like that's an accurate statement. The food that I tried was delicious and melt in your mouth good. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly and accommodating. They are called the Tap for a reason and if you enjoy a cold beer they have about fourty different beers on tap and a big selection of wines in various sizes. I'm a big baseball fan and I was really enjoying watching all the action from the diamond on eight different sixty inch screens and about 30 other flat-screens. I was able to watch five games at once while I ate and this seems like the place to come in the MGM to watch games. Good food, fun atmosphere and tons of sports and tons of beer choices. I really enjoyed this place and would give it a really high recombination, particularly if you are staying in the MGM Grand. You can charge your meal and your drinks to your room and relax and watch all of the games. If you are in the MGM you can't miss it.

The four of us girls stopped in about an hour before closing and the place was dead. More patrons were going to the nearby club: I know it's Vegas. I bring this up because out of all the empty tables, the young lady wanted to seat us close to the door at the most awkward table. Needless to say we asked for a table close to the action and that we can people watch outside of the restaurant.

Since we were all traveling most of the day and hungry, we wanted quick but good food and lots of drinks. Drinks were a bit pricy without a kick. I mean, no hint of liquor or alcohol at all. Those went back and the second batch tasted better although not the best. Now for food: the pretzel with dipping sauces was good, the burgers not so good. Fries tasted like they were dipped in hot oil to make them appear fresh; they were crispy and chewy. Everyone's meals had a problem.

On top of food and drinks not being good, there was a BITTER AFTERTASTE to EVERYTHING! It was as if the food was sprayed with something to keep it fresh looking and it didn't burn off during cooking.

The manager waived off most of everything. We walked away disappointed, hungry, and an awful hand sanitizer taste on our tongues.

We literally walked all of MGM, called all restaurants for any available seating and at all costs wanted to avoid fast food.

Our server, was fast, efficient and detailed. We ordered and within 10 minutes, Dinner was served. Everything we ordered had huge portions and was super tasty and flavorful. I'd like to take a moment to brag about the Fried Cheese Curds. Crispy, Chewy and a cheese lovers dream.

Wisconsin Fried Cheese ($10): These are beer-battered and were surprisingly delightful. Served with their ranch dip.

Jalapeño Corn Dogs ($13): The menu said the housemade frank would be filled with jalapeño cheese, but there was oddly NO cheese. They were still okay. I really liked the Honey Blonde Beer Mustard served with it. There was also Spicy Brown Mustard, meh.

Frank in a Blanket ($10): Large housemade all-pork frank wrapped in a flaky pastry and served with that same delicious Honey Blonde Beer Mustard. The frank is a little boring without any kick or standout flavors. I also would have liked more pastry, but it was still nice.

Bratwurst Sandwich ($12): Housemade bratwurst, kraut, spicy brown mustard, and pretzel roll. This was just okay. I didn't care for their bratwurst; nothing exciting.

Porchetta Pork Sandwich ($16): Pork belly porchetta, spicy Georgia BBQ sauce, Kentucky-style slaw, on a pretzel bun. This was a good sandwich; the pork belly was nice. My brother opted for their beer-battered onion rings which were very crunchy and delicious!

Signature Fries ($7): These herbed housemade fries were yummy and I loved their special ketchup. 

Green Caesar Salad ($14): Romaine, Parmesan, crispy anchovies, egg, grilled chicken, and roasted garlic green herb dressing. I feel like it's always a gamble with salads at bars, so I was very happy with the salad. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was nice. Solid choice.

Fried S'mores ($6): Fried graham cracker exterior with melted marshmallow and chocolate inside. Served with dipping chocolate. I did not care for them. The marshmallow didn't seem so marshmallow-y and the exterior didn't taste like graham cracker or a decent replacement.

Service started out really great with consistent refills and check-ups. As the restaurant filled up, no one came around and it took a great effort to get anyone's attention. For this reason, it took over 30 minutes between trying to order dessert and getting the check settled.

Overall, the food was better than I expected, but nothing magical. I like that they're making a lot of things in-house and it's definitely more effort than your typical bar food. I really did like their cheese curds and onion rings, but these are not items I'm seeking on a regular basis. A return visit is unlikely for me.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,2,2,3,lHSjS6KmxshLXsa2dyTubQ

Let's start with the service - mainly because that was probably the best part. It was great! Our waitress came over just after the hostess sat us down. She was attentive, friendly, and had a wonderful smile.

I ordered the mudslide shake, and my friend had the Cadillac sized margarita. The mudslide was delicious, but went super quick.

As for the food, we split an order of the steak nachos. Wow! It was a huge plate, and it had a ton of meat and toppings. The flavors went well together.

The only reason this place doesn't get more stars is the price. Although my friends Margarita's we're strong, they were not very big for being Cadillac sized. The price tag one them was pretty steep as well. Based on the price we paid for our meal and drinks, this place should add an extra dollar sign on it's description. $100 for nachos, a mudslide, and two margaritas? Probably won't do that again.

It was obviously shift change and no one could figure out who was waiting on our table. The apps took forever and we saw half of the order sitting under the heat lamps for ten minutes before it got brought to us. Just a bad experience over all. This past Saturday night we decided to give it another try. We thought we'd sit at the bar this time because we should definitely get better service there. Unfortunately, we picked the wrong side of the bar. The bartender completely ignored us for a good five minutes (no eye contact or anything) and one of the other bartenders from the other side asked if we had been helped yet and ended up getting us our beers. Then we were stuck with our guy again who took forever to take our order and was just non attentive. He was pretty enthralled in a conversation with a couple from Australia. I think he was crushing on the woman because she really tied up all of his attention while they were there.

Located adjacent to the Sports Book at MGM featuring a clever menu crafted by Steve Barr the newly minted TAP Sports Bar seemed a good spot to meet with friends old and new for Game 2 of The Stanley Cup Finals and aside from a slight delay in seating incurred due to The Belmont Stakes I'd be hard pressed to name a better night of this ilk, a double overtime come-from-behind win for Los Angeles matched with great conversation and food that ranged from average to excellent at a wallet friendly price-point for The Strip.  Expansive in size with diverse seating options flanking a central bar as televisions and memorabilia decorate the walls the TAP experience is truly a sportcentric one as a well-trained staff of jersey-clad severs circulate to the sounds of the game as opposed to some hideous Journey ballad generated via Touchtunes and although both food and beer menus trend small the selections themselves prove both unique and well-culled.  Clearly featuring a West Coast bias amongst its patrons and showing the NHL on every screen it was with a trio of beers and five appetizers that our meal began and with cheese as a theme it was actually the meaty chili in a bowl of buttery cornbread that impressed most and although I'm told the Onion Soup was quite bad both pretzels and herbaceous curds proved competent while man n' cheese bites were surprisingly light and rife with sharp cheddar.  Moving next to main courses after a near-hour lull it was in a quartet of options that we invested and although the open-face sandwich was delivered both dry and cool to the touch while thinly pounded pork proved far inferior to that at Hash-House-a-Go-Go it would be difficult to find fault in either the smoky Sloppy Joe atop one of the city's best buns or the innovative Corned Beef-style short rib with ample spicing and meat literally falling off the bone.  With more beers, more chat, and a Gaborik goal tying the game it was finally in desserts that we indulged and although none of the options are prone to wow on the level of those at Lagasse's Stadium both the Guinness Shake and substantial brownie were plenty rich enough to share while the deep fried s'mores and sidecar of fudge are an indulgent mess well worth making.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,2,3,0nyW4WE-IbL7gVjwzvclTA

First, I was waiting on line and when we got to the front, the hostess came and got the people right behind us to take a seat. Seriously!? So when I asked about it the hostess actually accused us of cutting in line! I was so furious that I called the manager. When we originally got in line we make sure to see who was behind us, just to avoid this situation! When the manager came over he apologized and promised to seat us right away. However after they did it, it took over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. I watched table after table get service before they would even come in our direction. This is no doubt because the manager told the servers to not come to our table out of spite for complaining in the first place. 

A South African manager then came over to apologize. He was polite and said that wasn't the case, but I feel like the first manager did that on purpose. If a table is already upset, wouldn't you go above and beyond to make them happy? 

Bottom line, this restaurant had horrible service in that regard. If you eat here expect to be treated like trash and if you complain MGM will treat you even worse. So if you want to be treated like garbage go ahead and go here. 

The ONE redeeming quality is Nikki from LA. She's a great server and tried really hard. She cares and is the reason they get two stars (otherwise one would've been too many). She apologized for their managers (shouldn't it be the other way around??) and went out of her way to try to make up for it. So she deserves the credit. I hope she gets a promotion because she should be running the place.

Our server was blah and had no personality, she took forever to come greet us, forever to get our drinks and forever to take our order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (her recommendation) and it was not really pulled pork at all, it was like hunks of meat together and kept falling out of the sandwich.  Very annoying. And then it was supposed to be covered in BBQ sauce which it wasn't but it was dripping something, grease maybe? Instead of nice sauce. 

The friends I was with also were not very impressed  with their food, they said the portions were big  but not really tasty at all. One of them had the burger, another the Turkey sandwich and the last one the hummus. I will say looks are deceiving here because at least their food looked good,  But again no one really felt it tasted good. Prices are regular high casino prices  as well, for that money we could go somewhere really nice and delicious. That was not here.

5593832,2015-08-06,1,80Lkm305ZOkQdMEIvOy_lw,"Needed a hearty meal after spending most of the day at Wet Republic under 100 degree skies. We had tried to go here late the previous night but their kitchen had just closed. My friend Jeff T had his mind set on some nachos after seeing them on someone's table as we passed by the night before and I was in the mood for a burger. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated right away at a booth. It's a very modern sports bar. I like the way they did it up. Lots of iron piping. Lots of wood decor. The booth we sat in could have seated 6. It was a sizeable table. We were told the name of our server as we were seated by the hostess and within a minute he kindly came over and introduced himself and took our drink orders. 

As I said, I was wanting a burger and I decided to build my own. It's in the section of the menu called Game Day Burgers ($18). The opening lines is your patty and I went with a Tap grind patty. The under/over is the bread and I had the grilled onion roll. The teaser is the cheese and I went with good ole american. And the odds on favorite is their added toppings. Each one is $2. I added bacon. I really liked my burger. It was tasty. It was big. The ground patty was cooked medium like I asked and the melted cheese was great. It came with 2 slices of tomatoes, onions and lettuce. It was speared with a wooden pick with a pickle. No pickles for me... Good burger. It filled me up and I was starving at the time. The steak fries were good. All it needed was ketchup for dipping. Nice crisp fries. Lightly salted. 

My buddy Jeff T got the Tap Nachos and it was a big mound of a whole lot of food. He opted to add chicken so that was $4 extra. The nachos come with guac, sour cream, pico de gallo and jalapenos. Jeff T seems to think it would be best served with some beans. I tend to agree. Some refried beans at least woulda made this even better. Like I said, it was a big order and only half was eaten. The rest boxed up and taken to go for hotel room consumption.

I had to deduct one star for the lack of beans in the nachos and for my order missing onion rings because you can order halfzies which have both fries & onion rings with your burger. I was so hungry I didnt say anything. It was a regular sized side order so its not like I was lacking quanity but the variety factor was missing being that our server was the one that suggested it. I apologize that I do not recall his name. He was an excellent server other than forgetting that one thing. He checked in on us often but never bugged us. He refilled our drinks without us having to ask. We left him a good tip... I would certainly eat there again. Tap Sports Bar. Good food. Good time.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,5,3,4,MZMGVSfSXueibUmhH5E_9g

It had arugula, (what I think were) grape tomatoes, peppers, (get this...) watermelon, topped with feta and a vinaigrette. I would never have thought to combine watermelon and arugula but it was delicious and refreshing! Talk about a salad I'll never forget! I also had the chicken tenders after, which were also very savory and tasty. The customer service through out the restaurant was excellent. I was greeted at the front with a smile and my bartender was very attentive to my needs. I shouldn't fail to mention that Tap boasts flat-screen TVs that enclose the restaurant with sports feeds from all over the world. As a sports fan and someone who loves to eat, this place was pretty much perfect for me. But I have to say...

I probably could go to in n out and have a double double and be better satisfied. I guess it's the price for eating on the strip. They had a pretty wide range of beers on tap. Had a 32oz blue moon with an orange that hit the spot. The service was good and the wait was like 5 minutes. I'd probably recommend this place if you are looking to get an appetizer with a drink.

We went to a quite a few places to during our stat. We decided that TAP would be the best place to sit and watch football Sunday morning! We were so wrong. It was the worst experience we had during the whole 4 days! We had Jennifer as our bartender/server we were there pretty early. We sat down and we were given our menus we ordered some water to start with as we looked over the menu. We were then ignored for approximately 15 minutes or so. She finally comes back and says. ""Oh I should've warned you guys, it's going to get so busy here you should've ordered when I first gave you the menus"" we were completely taken back but proceeded to order. A little while later I asked for some more water and she responded with ""I'm doing the best I can"". The couple that was right next to us ordered after we did and they received their food first. The guy on the other side ordered after them and also received his food before we did. The food was mediocre. After we finished our food she came to find out what else we wanted to order. We said we'd take some more water for now. She then explains that if we weren't going to order anything else we would need to leave because the seats we were sitting in we're only for customers who continuously spend movie while sitting there. We had enough. We decided to leave. She said ""since you did order food I'll give you a couple minutes to get everything together"". Then she took a long time and couldn't keep our orders the same since my friend and boyfriend switched seats. It was a huge inconvenience for her. When we were ready to leave she didn't even come give us chance we needed to ask the bar back to do it so we can finally leave. Needless to say we will not be returning.

Actually last year we stayed at MGM and enjoyed this place so even though we were staying at Delano this time we came here.  Food is exceptional especially for bar/sports bar.  First trip I had a burger.  I don't usually like burgers.  This one was fantastic.  Juicy (even though I asked for it to be well done).  Onion rings are yummy (ordered them both nights).  Second night I had the pulled pork. Very good (maybe a bit messy but hey it's bbq). Buddy liked the Reuben so well he had it both nights.  We were initially disappointed to see they didn't have the fried green beans as app but tried the pretzel at the suggestion of waiter.  Wonderfully simple and tasty.  The dips are great-especially the Gouda.  So impressed we got it both nights.  Service is low-key but good.   Both nights a bit slow start but fine once underway.

5738733,2016-07-08,2,80Lkm305ZOkQdMEIvOy_lw,"At MGM for a convention and stopped in for lunch a bit before noon. A short line was forming outside and someone in the line directed us to check in at the hostess station. When I did, she re-directed me to get back in line and she will come and take our names. The line continued to form behind us and she stayed behind the hostess desk ??? A party passed us all and asked if bar seating was first come/first served and the hostess said ""yes"" so we immediately jumped out of the line and went in search of a seat around the bar.  

It's a square bar and many of the seats were taken but we were able to find two in the back in front of the kitchen.  It took one of the bartenders/our waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge us and ask for our drink orders.  They were busy but being acknowledged is HUGE for me.

We opted for water and since we had 10 minutes to mull over the menu, we already selected our lunch choices:  Build A Burger with grilled chicken on ciabatta, fries, mayo and the lettuce/tomato that comes with it and the Spicy Asian Chicken salad with the dressing on the side.   Tap water for drinks.

It took about 15 minutes for our lunches to arrive. The Chicken Salad was huge, just the right amount of spice but the chicken was rather dry.  Same for the hubby's chicken sandwich.  Fries were thick cut, hot but pretty salty.  

The most strange experience is our waiter presented our check BEFORE the lunches came and before asking if we wanted anything else AND then he came back about 5 minutes after he presented the check and said ""can you take care of this now""?   We've NEVER had anyone at a sit-down restaurant ask if we would pay our tab (especially at the bar) before our meals came and then ask again before the meals came.  That was a real turn-off for me regardless of the quality of the food so hence my 2 star review...plus the dry chicken.

They have a big LED screen and TVs all around, so I enjoyed baseball while the hubster watched soccer. Ambiance and decor was nice. 

Hubster ordered the wings which were crispy just how we like them. The waitress recommended the sauce on the side to keep the crispiness and she was right. The Buffalo sauce had the perfect kick and they give you a perfect portion of ranch. 

Hubster also ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl which tasted bland. Something was missing, flavor. 

I had a turkey burger with bacon and fries. Fries were delicious. Perfectly seasoned. The burger...for $22.50 was disappointing. Carl's Jr. turkey burger is waaaay cheaper and has waaaay more flavor.
