And with all the bad attitudes I've experienced here this one just had to take the cake. I went thru with my bf and my friend. And they heard me say my order not once but THREE TIMES. I ordered a meal for my bf and a large drink for my friend. Very simple. First window of course same old girl who always snuffs me and gives her attitude when I give her my money. After I get my receipt I check it and say she forgot to add the large drink. And so the next window I explained to the lady about my drink and this Mexican lady told me she couldn't do my transaction because she had no money in her register. I looked at her like seriously..? So I said um ok well I can pay with my credit card no big deal. She refused that payment as well before handing me my bfs order.

I could probably just order a small drink and this clumsy McDonald's would find a way to screw up the order.

Yet, they still brought the hamburger with the ketchup and pickles on it. I have spoken to their supervisors twice about the screw ups. I am also offended by the sign at the drink machine that says ""one refill only."" Soda is not that expensive and I pay WAY MORE THAN THE SODA IS WORTH!!! Although I do not usually get more than one refill only, I find this sign VERY UNFRIENDLY!!! Today, I ordered a Breakfast Burrito meal with a triple cheeseburger. There was nothing special about the order. It would take a world class klutz and a master of incompetence to mess up this order. However, once again, this McDonald's rose to the challenge and managed to mess up. They gave me ketchup packets instead of picante packets. They also forgot to put pickles on the Triple Cheeseburger and this was NOT A SPECIAL ORDER! I AM THROUGH WITH THIS MCDONALD'S!

1510252,2016-02-18,0,_0ZIFTvfcA3UETO_S_JTNA,"Hmmm
New thought. 
Can a fast food place get five stars?
It's not like I was expecting gourmet food. 
I was hoping for the best mc'ds has to offer. 
I mean isn't that what fast food is all About?
Getting exactly what the franchise wants you to get so you are happy.

I am happy. 

Although there was a small language barrier for me. We communicated.
My wife And I received exactly what we desired. 
A fresh, hot, neatly put together, bfast sandwich. 
The hash brown was slightly more oily than I think corporate might like but it was a solid b+

So yes. 
Fast food restaurants deserve 5 stars if you get what is marketed, and expected. 
( usually you don't)

Why can't they all be like this. 


Ps. 
Owner keeps the bathroom key under control. Nicest , cleanest, classiest customer bathroom I've EVER seen in a f food establishment. 

Great animal metal castings adorn the grounds, put your kid on a mini elephant.  

Great seat decorations. Not the typical yellow and orange designed to get you to leave.

Facility:  this is one of the best parts about this McDonald's.  It was obviously recently built or remodeled. It also had a safari theme, so the decor was cooler than any other McDonald's I've seen. The playground area kept the kids interest the whole time. There were lots of bronze statues of animals in and outside of the restaurant. 

Service:  rarely are the servers at McDonald's nice, but these folks were friendly and brought the food to us back in the playground area. 

Food:  fries were hot and fresh!  Yes!!!!!

Overall:  for a fast food spot, this place was top notch. I will be back, especially if I have any kids in tow.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,1,0,4,vYYIcTc0Ae5dfufqDISOvQ

There were so many cars but the line was going faster than I expected so I got to order a lot sooner. We ordered a vanilla latte and a McFlurry. It's not so hard to miss my order, yes?

We paid and drove off and I gave my friend her vanilla latte and it was a regular latte! She waa craving vanilla latte so bad and that's why we stopped by McDonalds to get it because she wanted one from here!!

I couldnt go back because traffic was bad and I felt lazy to go back and complain but I still dont understand why and how they messed up my order. In fact, I didnt even get a receipt! From the first window where I paid, I asked if I am getting a receipt and he told me in the next window when I get my food but they only handed me a latte and a McFlurry.

Then a member of the staff come, the one he was told NO ONION and asked me to leave because I was ""disturbing the other clients with those noises"". The staff member left me speechless.

5539299,2018-06-27,0,_0ZIFTvfcA3UETO_S_JTNA,"No real need to review food. It's McDonald's. But CUSTOMER SERVICE IS CRAP here. When my boyfriend(who rarely even wants McDonald's) and I wanted some late night ice cream and breakfast foods..we left so pissed the food didn't even satisfy. 
First off, I wanted a sundae. I'm told by the order person in a condescending tone that ""our ice cream machine is being cleaned."" Ok..after midnight in LAS VEGAS?!! Come on, management. Then my sweetie asks for a iced caramel macchiato and is then snarkily told ""All our drink machines are being cleaned. Everything that makes espresso etc is being cleaned from MIDNIGHT TO 5AM every night."" She says this like EVERYONE WHO EVER ATE AT MCDONALD'S should KNOW THIS!! Like, um, if it's common practice then PUT A F-ing SIGN UP SAYING SO!!! Because I know we aren't the only ones who want ice cream or a milkshake or whatever else after midnight. And if we knew that...we coulda went to JACK IN THE BOX. 
Except FOR FOUNTAIN?! machines.. now I'm kinda grossed out tbh because it's not like she followed up w when those get cleaned. 
BUT we press on and order what IS available. There's two order lanes, a pay window and 2 pick up windows based on if you order in lane 1 or 2. 
Apparently this all goes to shit after a certain unknown hour, because we sit waiting at the pay window for about 3 minutes before we decide that no one is coming AND there's like 5 people behind us. So we go to the first pick up window for lane 1(we were in lane 2 for ordering) & someone takes our money, gives change back and leaves. Another 3-4 minutes no drinks brought over(no motion beyond the glass) and we are confused..are we now supposed to go to the next window? There's lots of cars behind us and nothing is happening so we drive forward and he breaks his side mirror on the cement pole that is way far out from the drive thru window. NOW we are super angry and frustrated; this was supposed to just be a quick jaunt to happy tummy town. 
At the third window no one comes and I say F it and get out and go to the exit only door. Where a minute later, an employee rushes over like ""oh it's a good thing you stopped""! Ummmmm we didn't get our food because no one told us anything...stay here/go to this window/nothing. ""Oh the person taking your order should have told you!"" GREAT! Blame someone else. ""Oh it's awful you broke your mirror! I don't even know why it sticks out so far or why we even have it!"" GREAT!! 
It took TWO people after that to bring out our drinks because they didn't know we had 2 and we will NEVER COME TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN!!",efDWQZJ5QX_uGhpVRLjo-Q,0,0,1,841sJo2aH7KUzyjY-4j20g

Came here on the way home from Vegas to make a breakfast stop at 10:00AM. It was kind of busy, maybe 6-7 people around waiting/in line. I originally wanted a egg while sausage bowl, but apparently Nevada's menu differs from their Cali sister stores and they didn't have it. I opted for their 2 sausage and egg burrito with no cheese options, but I guess they heard wrong and only put me down for one (since the photos the burritos looked tiny) because all I got was one burrito. This was after I saw and heard that they had messed up on my order and needed to remake it, hence why it took so long for our order to come out (we were #110, #111-#118 orders all came out already). They took another chunk of time because they also messed up on my friend's order, she wanted sausage mcmuffin with no egg and cheese, but they gave her one with egg and cheese so they had to redo that order as well.

There's no napkin or utensil dispenser on the counter, rather you have to ask for them. I find that every inefficient. They also wouldn't give a man a fork to eat his pancakes with and he ended up having to eat with a spoon (after having an argument with the staff about not having forks in stock). LOL. The staff here just doesn't seem to handle rushes well since the cashier just looked very flustered and tired.
