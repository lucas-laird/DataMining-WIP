Food is good, I just wished I didn't eat so much at the buffet, by the time I was there could really order only two dishes.  Very cute waitress there. ;)",GT1cNT11MnJY9d-s9Fe7ZQ,0,0,4,ewwDzSTdoUN7Kg7AkdBVnQ

Love it!",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,0,0,4,ZSbiFcQ9SIkmE8T5-c-QrQ

However, I gave it a try during a winter month because I am always searching for good sundubu and pleasant panchan.

During the summer, there is an outdoor scene, but that was not the case with the temperature in the 40s. (For all non-LVers, 40 is to us as 10 is to NYC.) The inside was a bit frightening, as it is REALLY dark, and the seating consists of picnic tables. I was also freezing the entire time despite the fact that I was sitting inside. It is also a place that has ""specials"" on small pieces of paper wallpapering the walls, and this decor scheme freaks me out because I am always concerned I am missing the one tastiest dish that is on a piece of paper in some corner that I can not see! I experiences the same paranoia at Ichiza.

The menu is largely Korean, but they also have Japanese-style grilled sticks. I had the sundubu, and it had a good taste, but eating it in pitch dark was not enjoyable. PLUS, they only served three little panchan! Panchan are as important to me as the actual soup. I can't tell you how many times I have prayed to the restaurant gods to deliver a panchan bar, where I can go and pay a flat rate for just a bottomless selection of these treats, like Korean tapas. 

They do appear to have a very full bar, and they bring you your own carafe of barley tea, so, if it is 2am and you are craving Korean and more to drink, you might really love this place. (I think a lot of the reviews are from the perspective of a bar that happens to serve food, where as I was going for the food.)",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,2,2,2,g2v_wnezQLcjISPXn1QYSA

It may shock you, but this was my first time experiencing the Korean Soju drink w/yogurt! I'm not a drinker, but I tried it and it tasted just like those Asian yogurt drinks. Really good stuff! 

I especially remember the grilled corn w/mozzarella cheese. When my cousin first ordered it, I didn't understand what was so special about it. But, this is a MUST TRY!! I also tried the rice cakes wrapped in bacon. It was different, but tasted mediocre. 

When I'm back in LV, I'll probably definitely stop by. Service was decent, but its more my nostalgia that wants to bring me back.",CLmvJN5a3l9KutC-nF6LzA,0,0,4,4dfz56Z-TtZOTFBHt1fNeA
