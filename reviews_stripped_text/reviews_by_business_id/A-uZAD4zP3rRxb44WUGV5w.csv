They truly are artists.  The sashimi platter was stunning, and they charge only $35 for it.  It would be at least $75 at Nobu.  We had the yellowtail appetizer, the roast chicken, the A5 Japanese steak, Nigerian prawns, Toro, pork belly, and a couple of their speciality rolls.  It was all phenomenal.  The fish is all Nobu quality and a fraction of the cost.  I understand that the chefs all came from high end placed, but the rent is much lower on Jones, so they pass the savings onto the customers.

Presentation on the dishes was appealing, taste was on key.  I tried the Uni and it has been awhile since I've tasted good quality Uni..Delicious!
My friends were amazed on the flavors as the experience good Japanese food as oppose to the ones they've tried before.
Service was excellent.  The owner/chef came to our table and follow up on our meal and having a conversation with us.  Even offered to try a new appetizer.  Yuzu Steelhead trout.  It was a unique dish with thinly slices of trout, yuzu wasabi drizzled, topped with pop rocks.  It was divine.

We were honored to meet Chef John, and his passion for the products he presents his patrons with is very obvious. 

We visited Soho's twice while we were in town, and I think we went through the whole list of sashimi specialties. The husband doesn't like salmon, but the Wasabi Cream Salmon won him over. Next trip I really have to try the oysters and the miso cod, among other things.

Chef John has a team of chefs who create magic with protein, sauce & hocus pocus. Let Sheila take control of the menu and you will be amazed and surprised with every plate she brings you.

I hear they are opening a new restaurant on Sahara named Sushi Burrito. Must try this one next.  

Came back as I was in Las Vegas for a convention. This is a must stop for me. 

Oscar & Charlie guided us through the menu. The Escolar Carpaccio, firecracker roll, bronze broccoli & bakes mussels are excellent and available on the happy hour menu. 

As I said before the best way to experience this restaurant is to tell the server how much you want to spend and let them take control. This lets them cut loose and be creative. You will be truly amazed by what Tai', Oscar and the team will create for you.

+1 The staff is courteous, friendly, and attentive. Our server was very friendly, and the head chef personally spoke with each table dining. We needed transportation back to our hotel, and our server helped us arrange for it after our first cab bailed on us.

+1 Prices are excellent, and portions are large. Unlike strip restaurants, you'll receive 8 maki-rolls per order, and two pieces of nigiri per order. All of the fish we ordered was extremely fresh and tasted excellent. 

+1 Location is off-strip, and in a quiet section of Las Vegas. Restaurant is also very clean inside, and well maintained. 

+1 As I previously mentioned, the head chef meets with every table to ask how your food was. He is one of the nicest restaurant owners I have had the pleasure of meeting, and even provided our party with free samples of the restaurant speciality, a yellowfin tuna sashimi with jalapeños. The chef politely asked us to sample his newly received ""uni"" sea urchin from Japan against his current California urchin. 

+1 To top our experience, our server gave my party free sushi pens and a free sushi keychain.

hamachi Kama (the special of the day):  the hamachi Kama was awesome - Tender and with the sauce I was in heaven!  

yellowtail yuzu: the flavors of the yellowtail and sauce matched so well and the textures of the deep fried jalapenos and yellowtail are lovely together.

Seared tuna special: it was well seared, not too much and not too little. Excellent and delicious!!

The yellowtail and tuna were complimentary by the chef/owner!  What really impressed me was that he comes out and talks to his guest (each table) and makes you feel at home.  Relaxed and comfortable atmosphere with top quality food and service without the ridiculous strip prices.

A friend and I were in Las Vegas for a convention and decided and we VERY much wanted sushi. So, we took to yelp and (as per usual) we weren't disappointed. From the minute you walk in, the quality of the establishment oozes from every corner. 

The prices were incredible for the quality you get, and the selection was broad - encompassing more than just sushi, but also several styles of Japanese cuisine. I will admit, we ordered Gyazo but were unsuccessful as they were currently out. We instead ordered the Edimame as an appetizer and before we could come close to finishing it, were presented with our first 2 rolls. We continued to pack in as much of the delectable assortment as we could and threw in the towel after 5 rolls. This is a testament to the value itself as we're both avid sushi eaters.

We settled up the check and called for a cab. However, as there were 2 conventions running, we were told it could take up to 2 hours! Feeling defeated we walked back in and asked the staff if there was a better cab company to call -- they were met with the same response.

What happened next shocked me most. The owner actually allowed one of the staff to drive us back in to the strip! I was floored. The cab ride back was a 20 minute trip with the traffic and they were absolutely great about it! I couldn't ask for more in terms of customer service.

Thanks Soho for reminding me that some places still care!",2KmmTsMWSKmvnZKV06UIzw,0,0,5,qU8GLnu1gvz-VQFo2OCLfQ

Staff US superb and I find it hard to imagine a restaurant cleaner than this one - not talking of appearance but actual cleanliness!

Will most definitely return.

Its not Raku quality sushi and no sturgeon, blue fin etc.; so fine dining this is not. Also the decor and atmosphere is Ultra casual... like Mickie Ds style and doesnt match the price. The service was good but not great at the price point. It is not cheap we dropped $100 for two people lunch. What they do right is the non sashimi happy hour stuff. Like fusion sushi tacos etc. I think for an American style fast sushi (think sushi panda express) this is good, but I have had sashimi in LA and Vegas that puts it to shame for not much more $.

Chef John goes above and beyond to make sure your happy with your meal. He came out to our table and greeted us, which to me it says a lot, asked what we liked and were then surprised with his signature Yellow Tail sashimi which was absolutely wonderful! It was so good we had to re-order it.

We also had the tuna poke which again was amazing! Hadn't had this quality of sushi and sashimi since San Francisco so to find this place closer to home is so nice.

Oh and the TOSTADAS! I really can't stop raving about these! They are small but so full of flavor and addicting that you won't be able to just have one! I recommend the Hamachi, tuna, and the salmon one.

We had the white peach & lychee sake. You can easily share this.. each glass of sake filled 4-6 of the shot glasses. I recommend the white peach sake - it was infused really well! The lychee sake was good too.. but I didn't like that you could taste the sake more than the lychee.

During happy hour, we also had ika geso (fried squid tentacles), cajun albacore sashimi, avacado & salmon roll, firecracker roll (didnt try this one.. I can't do spicy :(), shrimp tempura roll & the tostadas!

Oh man, the tostadas were delicious!! There are four options: 
- Salmon with pico de gallo 
- Tuna with poke sauce
- Hamachi with salsa verde 
- Tako with kimchee 
We tried all but the tako. The tostadas are $1 each during HH.. we loved these! They are very light, refreshing & we kept ordering them!! Haha.. eat these right away! Otherwise the chip will get soggy..

Halfway through our visit, the owner came by our table and asked us how we were doing & just chatted with us. He told us he was going to send us a plate of yellowtail sashimi which will show us what they're all about: fresh, high quality sushi! & they nailed it! The yellowtail sashimi was a great example of that: fresh + high quality = delicious!!

Throughout our time at Soho, the wait staff was really attentive.. refilled our glasses, asked how the sake & sushi were & the waitress came by before happy hour ended to see if we wanted to put in more orders. We had to pass on dessert because we were all full, but we still got something sweet! Our waiter brought this cute tray of sushi keychains & we could take our pick! It may seem like a small gesture, but it was SO nice!

This was one of the best experiences I have had in awhile from beginning to end! My friends & I left with big smiles on our faces.. I can't wait to go back & try more food!",8kblFESkorfP00ryDTBuRQ,6,4,5,9SBZWpUjaw2Dr2_rpjZclg

My hubby and I are sushi fanatics who continuously search for a good sushi place.  Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, we tried Soho Japanese Restaurant for lunch and we were not disappointed.  Sometimes, yelp reviewers miss the mark, but this time they were spot on. 

We ordered the salmon and tuna tostada for appetizers.  The freshness of the fish which was perfectly seasoned (excellent blend of citrus, salt and oil) got me hooked at first bite.  The wasabi cream was smeared on the crunchy, flaky tostada, the salmon and tuna were topped with fresh herb that had a similar taste to cilantro/parsley which gave the concoction a refreshing twist.  

At this point, the chef/owner, John approached our table to introduce himself.  He was a very likeable guy who obviously wanted his customer/guest to be happy with the food selection.  He offered us a delicate dish of Hamachi layered on top of a mixture of garlic infused grape seed oil with hint of shoyu and topped with mild sliced jalapeno.  Again, perfection!  This was only topped by the fact that it was complimentary!  John surely knows how to woo his customers, and it definitely worked.

I had the rainbow roll which was equally good.  The sushi rice was cooked and seasoned just right and of course, the fish, shrimp and crab eggs were quite fresh.  Hubby wanted a chirashi bowl, but it was not on the menu.  They had a sashimi item on the lunch special menu but no chirashi.  However, because John was so gracious and accommodating, he made it happen for my hubby who was very happy and satisfied with his choice.  The service at Soho was fast and friendly, a worthy companion to the exceptional sushi creations.  

We will definitely be back for happy hour (4-6pm, Mon-Sat) with friends who would definitely love this place as well. Thank you chef John and Louie, our attentive  server.  We will see you soon.",ZDDp1IIHhK9vFqfEHfj2lQ,2,1,5,PG9ITVyK5hsQ5pvGwLCzXQ

* DONT LEAVE WITHOUT ORDERING THE creme brûlée IT IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. The flavor the texture it is the high light of our meal.

Everything we ordered I enjoyed but those are the top 4 must try dishes. Only bummer was because of the holiday special menu I didn't get to order oysters and the kani.

If you are also tourists like us, and want to look for something away from the Strip but of equal standard with affordable prices, this is it!

As we walked in we saw a very plain and quiet interior, immediately lowering our expectations for the food. However we were quickly proven wrong.

The highlights of the menu were the Yellowtail fish sashimi; the presentation was superb, while the fish itself was extremely fresh and tasty. The Cajun Albacore Sashimi was a complimentary dish from the head chef; the sashimi was seared around the edges, layered above a bed of radish, and soaked in a flavorsome cream-based sauce. The Beef Ribs were stewed for 8 hours, the texture was so tender and juicy that it detached from the bone effortlessly, and literally melted in our mouths.

After what seemed like 10 dishes, we could not resist to the tempting dessert menu created by French chef Leonard Phay. We ordered the Matcha Tiramisu and the assorted Mochi Ice Cream. IT WAS AMAZING. See photos below; words does not do it justice.

The house salad was tasty and i would recommend it as a break from all the heavy usual US salad. As for the tempura, the frying dough could have been puffier and lighter, but other than that this place is the bomb.com.

Sometimes the texture grosses me out and I don't like the flavor of most fish. However this place had rave reviews so I dipped my toe in once more.

My favorite dish, the Cajun albacore sashimi has really nice flavor, smooth and tender texture, and pop from the jalapeño. The firecracker was my second favorite as it's creamy spicy tangy and sweet and has crunchy and soft textures. Tapas were my least favorite. The kimchi taco was the best one.

As we walked in the staff was very tentative and were seated right away. As we sat we received our drink order and our waitress Julie ran us through the menu and listed out her favorites as she emphasized on the sashimi. We heard a lot of good things about Chef Lee and his attention to sashimi, so the wifie and I decided on the 15 piece sashimi plate along with some house favorites which were the ocean trout with pop rocks (pop rocks went well with the trout as it acted more as a texture touch rather than adding taste) and the yellow tail with ponzu sauce (clean fresh taste, ponzu paired perfect with the yellow tail).  

As the sashimi plate came out the first thing that caught my eye were the generous cuts of fish. Our plate consisted of three pieces of tuna, three pieces of scallop (light and sweet as this was the wifies favorite); three pieces of saba; two pieces of red snapper; two pieces of salmon; and two pieces of Hamachi kama (my favorite as it was so so buttery it left a silky feeling in your mouth). As we were close to finishing to our surprise Chef Lee greeted us at our table and ask how we were doing. He also brought out one of his special dishes on the house, sea bass with olive oil and truffle salt (very simple clean tasting in which every element went well together). 

Soho is one of my favorites. Personable chef and friendly staff with one of the best sashimi in town.",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,1,2,5,Vqraw-9DOKlW7jYj1aS6_A

I have to be open and honest here: I know the owner and some of the staff, yet had NO idea this place was even opening, as well as opening so close to where I live in SW Vegas...

From first hand working experience on the strip, I can say Soho has derived itself from the benchmarks of service and food quality set by elite Vegas fine dining, but at a third of the price. Real king crab in your California roll, big-chunk big-eye tuna in your spicy tuna rolls, countless specialty rolls, lunch specials, Locomoco holy sh*t... 

This is the best sushi off the strip hands down. I need to mention  the ONLY reason I got into eating sushi as much as I have in the past few years is because I got to try SOHO owner John Lee's sushi years ago, from a popular Vegas restaurant on the strip.

The interior is ok, I hope they upgrade the exhaust system since it smelled a little like a stinky-fried-food Chinese restaurant.  The first server we had was terrible, but it turns out it was his first day.  All the other servers are super knowledgeable and awesome. 

The prices are super reasonable for the quality of food.  The Chef used to be the Executive Chef of Social House on the strip so he knows all the vendors and gets top notch ingredients.  The hubby is super sensitive to uni and if it's just a smidge not fresh he will pick up on it and claim it to be ""fishy"" or ""too slimy"".  He RAVED about the uni here and even ordered himself seconds!  Trust, this has never happened before (not even at Raku or Kabuto or Yonaka).  The chef is dedicated to making sure his food is extremely fresh and clean tasting. 

We tried the yellowtail, the tostadas, beef tataki, angus gyoza, butter lettuce cod, and crispy rice tuna roll.  All were amazing, especially the yellowtail, tuna poke tostada, and cod (as well as some other nigiri and sashimi we had).  I would pass on the gyoza and crispy rice.  Gyoza was limp (and I guess I still prefer traditional pork) and a tad too greasy.  Crispy rice roll is a great concept, just didn't care for the actual crispy rice.  It was kind of stale and not crisp.  

Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu - they also have HH.  The toastadas are only $1 each.  I might just have to go and get like 10 of the ahi poke toastadas.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,0,0,5,yxrKkGUNGITvYHpjXThPuw

Just about every nation has some special dish to offer for different taste buds !
When I lived in Chicago for many years, I used to shop at Mitsuwa, a large Japanese grocery chain store.They sell fresh imported fish for sushi and sashami along with a variety of Asian groceries. Yummy !Southern California has several Mitsuwa stores, but none in Vegas. I had lunch at SoHo today! I must admit that it was a very pleasant experience!First, when you enter, it is the ambience of this cute restaurant will make you smile, immediately followed by the greetings of  wait staff as well as the Chef/Owner himself.This place is immaculately clean, which is a must for all restaurants, especially a sushi bar ! I orderd sashami lunch which was probably the best in as many years that I have been eating fresh fish !
The  fish was literally melting in my mouth ! Unlike mundane iceberg lettuce served in many fine sushi restaurants, the chef here serves my favorite colorful leaf lettuce salad, which itself deserves seven stars! But YELP allows a maximum of five stars. So what ? I will give my cute  little lettuce what I want!
It is my third visit in five days ! I was here for lunch last Saturday, then again on Monday for Happy Hour!Tuna and salmon tostadas were so tasty that you might want to savor a dozen of them, while sipping Kirin!What makes this sushi bar stands out among zillion restaurants in this food paradise called Las Vegas ?
Besides serving fresh seafood at a very reasonable price, it is the friendly staff that will treat you so well,as if they all have known you for a few years ! Ten Stars !
Like all chefs will say, if you had to stand outside and wait for an hour for sushi during rush hour, then it must be damn good ! Kudos to SoHo, the fish and the staff

Ambience- very nice, warm colors, soft music (not loud); hostess asked if we had a reservation but since we didn't, she said 'sorry, I don't have any table for you' (and it was half full!) She paused for a second and enjoyed our stunned faces, then smiled saying she was kidding. Hmm, you got us, girl.

Service- Hostess had a good sense of humor.  All the staff, I mean, the waiters/ chef/ sous chef, etc would yell 'Soho something' every few minutes in unison and said 'bye and thank you' to almost every person when they leave. A little over the top maybe? But we enjoyed it.

Food-
Twin dragon roll- excellent, large bite sizes. Reeeeeaaaally yummy (might add a little more e's and a's there)

Soft shell crab roll- good but not spectacular. Gobbled it up quickly. Still enjoyed it.

High roller roll- has Wagyu beef in it. Is it just me or did it taste ... hmm, weird? Never tried wagyu beef before. You know when your mind expects sushi taste but your taste buds give you something else? It was good- just wasn't expecting that taste. Wagyu has a little after taste. May have to try it again. I always give food a second chance. (Yeah baby. )

Mochi- can't go wrong with Mochi. It's always good. Liked the chocolate ice cream and the chewy outer layer (don't know how to describe). Trust me, it's good.

Each time has been wonderful. This particular time was a bit of a quasi disappointment. No knock on the food as the food was good but not worth the wait. We ordered from their omakase menu which had set items. We entered at 830 thinking their Yelp reservation confirmation at 845 was set. Come to find out it was not but they gladly seated us without delay anyway.

After ordering from their omakase menu (set menu) with additional items, the food came out at an average 18.75 minutes per dish. 8 omakase dishes totaling 2.5 hours. Normally this would not been an issue if it were our first time (no expectation) but unfortunately we been here before. To their defense the restaurant was at full capacity till 10 pm but half full at 10:15pm. We were the last to leave at 1130. We have done omakase at many places and this was very long. You tend to lose your appetite after awhile. Fortunately they broke their rule for providing us pitchers of beer.

Upon arriving, we were surprised at how busy the place was.  Every table was full.  That seemed like a good sign.  Luckily, we didn't have to wait as we came in just before the crowd.  The restaurant was decorated nicely, and seemed very clean.  

We ordered the Cajun Albacore, Mixed Tempura, Crispy Tuna Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Garlic Tuna, and the Chef threw in the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy.  Pricing was decent as the entire bill came to $57.  We thought that the sashimi plates were delicious and the Yellowtail was AMAZING!  I thought it was very nice for the chef to do this and I would have given Soho a 5 star rating, had it not been for the fact that they didn't have any rolls with Eel or they didn't have the regular crispy tempura topping on the rolls that most places have.  The crispy tuna roll was good and different.  It had fried the rice on the bottom instead of being rolling in the other crispy stuff.  The tempura veggies was by far the BEST tempura we have ever had.  If we are in the mood for tempura and yellowtail sashimi, we will make Soho the place we go.  Because there are no rolls with Eel, we will have to try other places next time.

This place, on the other hand, provide the best quality sushi, better than the most I had in the strip hotel restaurants, for much less $$.
I am very picky when it comes to sushi, so we decided to seat by the head chef for the chef special, and every plate and every piece of sushi made us speechless. They were perfect!

649507,2014-05-01,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"It's been a while since I've written a review as dieting has kicked in for me.  Hard to foodie it up while cutting the calories.  :)

Still, decided one random Thursday that sushi was going to be for dinner, as it had been a bit since I've had japanese.

Yelped a bit, since I decided our usual stomping grounds wasn't going to cut it, and found SOHO by accident.  Just so happens to be right around the corner from my place, so...off we go!

5:30pm on a Thursday and the place was PACKED.  I guess there's happy hour that runs here from 4-6 or something, so we got there just in time to pick a few things from that menu.  In particular, the mini-tostada things -- pretty dang tasty.  I only had the tuna one as I wanted to save calorie room for the rest of the meal.  But wife said they were all really good (at $1/ea, we ordered 2 of each for everyone in the family to share).

Before I go into the food, service here is excellent.  Server came by about 10 different times to refill our teas and waters.  Also gave some good recommendations on the dishes.  The place is very Yonaka-like in that the dishes are fusion and modern, but less saucy and faster plating (Hi chefs.  It doesn't take 30 minutes to slice 8 pieces of fish).

Couple of really outstanding dishes.  GET THE YELLOWTAIL JALAPENO SASHIMI - it is one of the the best yellowtail dishes I've had to date.  There's something about jalapeno, yuzu, and fatty yellowtail that just makes you go tingly all over.  The slight tangy acidity of the yuzu mixed with the creaminess of the fish fat, topped off with a twinge of heat from the fried jalapeno slices.  Ka-pow!  Order another!

Hydro bibb black cod - comes with a little piece of lettuce to wrap the finger sized appetizer in.  What's a hydro bibb?  Simply, it's hydroponically grown bibb (european butter) lettuce.  We originally thought it was some sort of science experiment, but went ahead and ordered anyway.  Glad we did!  One of the more savory dishes we had all night.  Tastes like eel, but without the bones, and all the protein of fish!  Tasty.

A few other dishes to touch on that stand out in my mind: 

-soho maki - basically a thinly rolled eggroll with chicken and spring veggies; the sweet chili sauce makes this dish worth while.  We saw another table order 4 of these things...

-king crab tempura - this was on the specials board that night.  Came with some sort of aioli dip that was to-die for.  Was probably some sort of mayo based sauce that killed my diet, but dang it was good.  Had to do doubles during the workout just to burn that sucker off!

-ika geso - this is on the happy hour menu.  Basically, little tiny fried squids.  For those of you on a dietary challenge, squid is high protein, low fat.  Little high on the cholesterol, but a few tentacles won't kill you.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little spot in a strip mall (next to a subway and family practice.  We will definitely be coming back for fresh fish another time!",2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A,0,0,5,ivYFxaYoZ7obQ_8bn_jY4w

The food - 
part one - sushi and traditional rolls. We ordered several types of sushi (mostly standards plus the chef gave us blue fin tuna). All were fresh, well presented, large portions. The excellent quality of the fish was confirmed as we ate our way through the platter. If I had to nitpick, the rice could have been more firmly packed under the fish, but that really is splitting hairs. 
 I also ordered (a few) salmon skin rolls. I try to order this particular dish whenever I go to a new sushi house. I think it's a very difficult item to make well. In short, they did just that. The salmon skin was perfectly crisped, the roll was compact and filled with fresh garnish, including avocado and a light sauce that, though I can't put my finger on the exact flavor, moved the roll from good to fantastic. 
Part two - The specialty rolls. We ordered several specialty rolls. One, the twin dragon was as delicious as it was big. It was the last thing we ate and capped the meal with a perfect sweetness.  We also ordered the crispy rice spicy tuna roll. In truth, that was the only downer of the meal. The spicy tuna topping was perfectly blended and flavorful, but the rice was severely overcooked. 
That, however, was the sole flaw in our dinner. 
When we received the bill, we were more than pleasantly surprised that our sushi extravaganza had cost about 40% of what we'd typically spend at sushi Roku and a quarter of nobu. 
Whether our meal was as good as at either Roku or nobu is debatable, it probably wasn't. However, the meal was excellent, the sushi was fresh and well presented, and the staff were wonderful. Given that, it will be hard to justify going to either of the aforementioned restaurants instead of soho. The price for marginally better food  simply does not seem worth it.",uwiwGGCfKNCQx0MMbddKbA,0,0,5,w-LAsrRA8-e9smLKm5_V8w

The fish is so fresh and so amazing.  I love the salmon avocado roll. The The avocado is always so fresh and melts in your mouth. I have three different tadas which are crispy wontons with avocado and fish on top. I've tried the salmon, tuna, and tako (octopus). Normally I love salmon, but in the tada version, I love the tuna. The tako tastes kind of like shrimp ceviche. That might be because of the pico de gallo that is on that tada. 

We also ordered the Cajun Albacore Sashimi which tasted awesome! The fish was just so fresh and so amazing. Everything melted in my mouth. My friend ordered the Hydro Bibb Black Cod. That was 2 really small pieces on a bed of lettuce. It was not that great tasting. It also tasted a bit sweeter. 

The one thing I would not recommend is the soho maki. It's like a really long egg roll. For egg roll fans, it'd be great. However, it's not something I would want at a sushi restaurant. It did taste great, and came with sweet and sour sauce, but I thought it be more fishy. The description mention shrimp and other things, so I thought it would contain more shrimp.

It did not disappoint! The staff was really friendly (Charles was GREAT!) and the sushi bar chairs were really comfy.
We started with edamame which was delicious because it comes out hot and flaked in big chunks of sea salt with a sweet chili dipping sauce.
We ordered the Salmon Sashimi with Wasbi Creme next and it was delicious. While we were still trying to decide what to get next, the owner and head chef John overheard us telling our server that it was our first time. He asked what kind of fish we liked and we said Yellowtail Tuna. He immediately sent out a complimentary Jalepeno Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer. It was AMAZING!

We ordered the King Crab roll which has all of our favorites; crab, avocado, cucumber, spicy tuna and FRESH HOT shrimp tempura on top. It was probably the best roll we have had in Vegas. Again, really fresh. I usually smother my rolls in sauces and jalepenos but this roll didn't need anything else! 
We also ordered the Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll and it was good, not as good as the first but definitely really fresh and delicious. 
They have small plates on happy hour too that are really good and really great priced.

Just had to experience that for myself on the recent trip out there.

On a Fri night, the place was packed, but after 30 mins of waiting, we got a table. 

The waiter was a friendly kid from Hawaii, who was able to recommend some of the favorites and specials. We ended up ordering prob more that necessary for two of us.. but we wanted to try various dishes. Plus the prices were oh-so reasonable. lol

Yeah, those 5 stars are well-deserved !

Everything from oysters to sushi was super-fresh and delicious.

The food comes out pretty quick, but in orderly and timely manner so your table is not full of dishes uneaten.

Customer service was ok. We had people coming by non stop offering my friend more hot tea that he had ordered. It was in fact, quiet annoying because I think in the less than hour ish visit, servers came by around 8 times to check on us and offered green tea refills... for ummm, just for my friend. I didn't need any water so I never asked for a refill. They came by to refill water once, so kudos for remembering us water drinkers. Then they probably come by 3 additional times to check to see if we were OK again. Gee, I didn't need to be checked on us every 3 minutes. 

It's 4am in the morning and I can't sleep. I'm thirsty and my tongue feels really nasty. I also had to apply ChapStick. Why? I think what I ate had a TON of msg!!! 

I live in Vegas and I frequent a lot of AYCE sushi buffets but knowing that I didn't have AYCE at Soho, why do I feel so thirsty right now like I had eaten at a buffet? It's not fair cuz I only had two snow crab California rolls and a grilled salmon mini plate. 

I just wanted to warn anyone who only eat cooked meat to be careful. You're going to feel thirsty. I'm just glad my 22 months old daughter refused to eat any of the food here because it wouldn't have been nice if she wants the one up right now lol.

My favorite part about this was it allowed to eat something in my comfort zone, but try something different as well knowing I wasn't breaking the bank for food I wouldn't enjoy! Their happy hour is Mon-Sat at 5-7pm, and they have the following dishes on the happy hour menu: 

Escolar Carpaccio
Cajun Albacore Sashimi
Angus Slider
Truffle Tempura
Baked Mussels
Crispy Brussel Sprouts
Bronze Broccoli
Salmon Avocado Roll
Shrimp Tempura Roll
Spicy Tuna Roll
Ceviche

They also have some drinks, and I would recommend trying some sake while you are there. Jelly sake was not on the happy hour menu, but I would recommend it because it's just really cool and tastes great (like a jello shot, but much less messy)!

My partner and I ended up getting the spicy tuna roll, salmon avocado roll, and cajun albacore sashimi. I would recommend all 3!

The atmosphere is wonderful, service is great (even though the place was packed when we were there), and much more bang for buck than eating on the strip.

Update! 
We returned with two of our friends and it seems as if they expanded the happy hour menu (no complaints here) and 4 of us were able to eat and drink for $70.

Chef John Chien Lee, owner and former Social House chef, is a master at his craft even after sharing a large sake (Orka ginju $60 very tasty) he didn't miss a beat.  Watching the staff behind the sushi bar was like watching a well oiled machine.  Nunu was to John's left (one time JJ gave Nunu the day off) and was the perfect team.

Ordered their Triple S Roll ($15 - shrimp, scallops, spicy tuna, tempura white fish and asparagus)  I also ordered nigiri - octopus, spicy scallops, akodai snapper and halibut.  Very fresh and not a puny cut.  They also have specials not on the menu.  I had their Monk Fish (yuuummmm) with ponzu sauce and taro root chips.  Everything served was fresh, great portion size and reasonably priced.

The have a special dessert chef bake specifically for them  My party had the Matcha Tiramisu ($7) which is a green tea soaked sponge cake (I took a picture and already posted it).  The menu described a ""Matcha sabayon"" which when I asked John what that was - he sweetly giggled and said he didn't know.  Cute.  Another catch was an item on the menu described as a ""field octopus.""  An obvious typo but also too cute.

None of that mushy fish and rice blended concoctions like those low quality All you can eat joints. Quality sashimi, delicious sauces. Not one of those places that serves 50 million made-up rolls mostly consisting of spicy mayo and other filler ingredients. The focus here is more on bringing out the taste of the quality fish, not overdoing it with the sauces. For instance, their California roll is made with 100% real crab meat!!! I never liked California rolls because most use imitation meat. I love crab so I will eat them here!!
 The owner and staff were very attentive and nice. The owner even gave me a free dish of sea bass sushi to try for free...and it was delicious. They had a green tea creme brulee that they are still deciding if they will put on the menu.....its a keeper...YUM!
The peach lychee sake is awesome and made in-house! Prices are good for the quality you get. Happy Hour menu has great selections and awesome is an awesome deal.

975882,2014-06-05,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"When I looked this restaurant up on Yelp, I could not BELIEVE its reviews. At the time it had 5 stars and over 300 reviews. I don't think I've ever seen a rating this good. With my adoration for sushi and impending trip to Vegas, I was dead-set on visiting Soho and thank god I did.

The restaurant was in a strip mall and the decor was fine... it looked like about 30 other sushi restaurants I've been to. I've learned that great things in humble packaging, but I was a bit underwhelmed at first. Silly me! As soon as we sat down, we were treated like absolute royalty. Not only was our waitress very helpful and nice, she was also relaxed and casual with us in a way that my boyfriend and I always really appreciate. We love to crack jokes while interacting with wait staff, and this girl was on top of it, joking right along with us! She was excellent. She then proceeded to give us the BEST recommendations for our meal. Everything we ordered was SO FRESH and just bursting with flavor. No fishy smell or after taste... this fish was fresher than fish I've eaten on both coasts. After we were done, we were so impressed that we ordered another round! I wish that I could recall exactly what we had ordered, but that's kind of irrelevant to my review because literally everything we tried was amazing. I feel like you seriously can't go wrong at this place unless you have a food allergy and purposefully order something that will make you swell up and die. So don't do that.

Dessert was excellent. We had the green tea tiramisu. I feel like if I gush anymore, this review might not sound legitimate, so I'll just leave it at that.

The real clincher was when our check was brought, the waitress brought us out an adorable little sushi keychain and a pen that looked like chopsticks holding a little rubber piece of sushi. I was in love. I wanted to wrap this restaurant up in my arms and fly it back to Colorado with me.

If you're a sushi fan in Vegas, do NOT miss the opportunity to visit this place. Don't let the fact that it's a tiny cab ride away from the strip keep you away, either... the prices and quality of your meal will more than make up for that $20 cab ride.",96ypk9RkivbaWJvNGCWwiA,2,0,5,E92bYa9LpWBNaqzRK8Ow3g

Soho serves serious QUALITY food at strip-mall prices. Residents in the SW are lucky to have this restaurant in proximity. Chef/owner John Lee and his crew execute fresh, creative and sophisticated fare. The room is casual; the service is attentive and earnest. The food will make you feel like royalty. This is not one of those drab AYCE places, so don't expect heavy sauces, gummy sushi rolls or chewy fish.

There is amazing talent in the kitchen that has access to the finest ingredients often reserved for restaurants on The Strip. A lot of care is taken in their preparation to highlight the ideal characteristic of the fish. The flavors clean, refreshing, silky, complex and complementary. That fish cradles your palate and melts in your mouth.

Order what everyone else says:
Yellowtail Yuzu Soy, Tuna Pizza, any of the Tostadas to your liking, Uni, Black Cod, Oysters, Snapper, Tuna Poke, Salmon Poke, Short Ribs. Take it all in. Ask what's good that day and just let them work their magic. You won't be disappointed (unless you're into heavy sauces, gummy rolls or chewy fish).

Once you've completed your indulging, you'll be equally delighted by your bill. C'mon, $2.00 tostadas! I don't need to go to the other sushi restaurant in the SW anymore. This is it.",MEhBmoVFiiv9LZVq5NTMGQ,2,1,5,iIoxNk-CdoNxR2bkk9GjgA

We were so curious, we needed to try it, We also thought its almost 7 pm and this is a 5 star restaurant then there is going to be a wait. We got there and parked and there was no line outside.  I told my husband it must be closed.  Nope it was open- of course it would be its Saturday! There were a few tables opened and we got seated right away! Charles was our server! He was great explaining the menu and making his recommendations.  He was right, everything on the menu is good! This is our new favorite place! Fish is fresh- its so fresh it just melts in your mouth! You forget what fresh fish tastes like when you eat at AYCE restaurants! No more AYCE for us! 

Salmon Wasabi Creme-hmm! So good! My favorite! Salmon is cut sashimi style, the roe gives it a salty taste, the creme gives a creamy taste! I'm addicted! 

Tadas- only $2 each! We enjoyed the octopus, hamachi and tuna.  All 3 were mixed with their sauce and placed on a wonton wrapper.  Good portion considering it was $2 each! 

Bone in Short Rib- if you are looking for a heavy dish then this was a good one to enjoy. The runner was right when she delivered the food as I was eating with my chopstick, do you need a fork and knife?, I said hmm. Then she said it falls right off when you eat it with your chopstick.  She was right no knife needed. It was so soft! The crispy onions made it more flavorful

Whole Aji- like sashimi style raw fish? This is a winner! I don't normally eat aji but I will here! It was another one of my favorite (surprisingly).  I don't even eat this at other sushi restaurants, but here, hmm, SO GOOD! 

Triple uni- it was a special on the board! I don't eat this but I will tell you what he said best uni ever! Be prepares there is no rice!

Was at Soho finishing dinner when they close the restaurant. The wait and cook staff were cleaning up without regards that customers were still present in the dining room. A girl (Asian, medium height and build) was singing/squealing at the top of her lungs and cursing  left and right. It was obviously a cry for attention from the sushi chefs. I'm pretty patient but after it continued for about 30 minutes I could not handle it any more. Casey, our server at the time, was great. He was polite and mild mannered. His energy did its best to offset that crazy lady. We tipped him 100% of the tab for saving our sanity. 

Basically, it's hard for local restaurants to succeed when they are competing against big named chefs on the strip. Soho definitely has the food handled, but they could really invest in hiring a restaurant manager to ensure that the ambience is maintained (especially when a customer called to ensure that it is not too late to get proper service).",gaSV8ZWNxOQh2XmIjM9A2w,0,0,2,wcYpgQk2kldlkm6cqSJOSw

All I wanted was rice, shishitos, tuna tataki,  and cajun albacore. In restaurants you have to be consistent,  it's not about being escoffier one day and a burger king line cook the next. If your consistent , eventually that consistency will turn into greatness. Unfortunately this place obviously has workers in here who do not meet the consistency accord and do not want to be great.

Sashimi plate (larger one) always fresh and the variety of sashimi is great (e.g. ahi, salmon, scallops, uni). Presentation is always cool (see shrimp stuffed in mouth of fish carcass). They'll fry the fish head for you too after you're done with the sashimi so you can pick off the meat or eat the eyeballs.

 Japanese A5 wagyu is awesome rare. Gold flakes may be a little over the top but whatever, it's A5 wagyu! Meat like butter! The ponzu sauces that came with it overpowers the flavor of the meat. Bypass sauces; a little salt and pepper is all you need.

We picked off the menu board and got the prime Angus filet with uni butter. Tasted great, but we made the mistake of ordering this after the A5 so prime filet was almost like eating a gristly piece of pot roast. If we didn't make this mistake, it would've been much more awesome in my mind.

Scallops with foie gras was cooked perfect. Best part was that the foie gras on top was not some flimsy piece; it was about half the thickness of the scallop. A little rich, but cutting the servings in half did the trick.  Hate over-cooked scallops but SoHo always cooks it to melt-in-your-mouth perfection.

Sushi rolls were tasty but as long as the fish is fresh, rolls taste decent just about everywhere. Presentation is always spot on here, though.

However, there's one part of John's creative genius that is not on the menu.  If you have an opportunity to spend $30-$40 per person on Sushi ask for the Omakase.  John will treat you to a Japanese feast like no other sushi restaurant.   Every time my wife and I go to Vegas, we have a meal at Soho Sushi.  And each time the Omakase is a feast.  On this day, my wife, sister and I were treated to the following 8-course meal:

1. Yellowtail with Yuzu sauce (Just the best way to open a meal)
2. Hirame with Uni
3. Ocean Trout with Ikura
4. Garlic seared White Fish
5. Hamachi Kama (The absolute largest I've ever had)
6. Bone in Short Rib (not Sushi, but succulent and tender)
7. Maguri Negi Toro with Black Caviar and Gold Leaf (Yes, you read that right...gold leaf!!!)
8. Green Tea Creme Brule with Mango Mochi Ice Cream

It's not enough that each course was an extraordinary surprise, but the best tasting food we had during this trip.

The cost was $30/person.  If you're ever in Las Vegas, this has to be a required visit.  The only other seafood restaurant we go to during our trips to Vegas is Aquaknox at the Venetian, but at that point it's $100/person.  I've eaten at Kabuto in Las Vegas Chinatown, Sushi Den in Denver, Morimoto's in New York and Hawaii, Katsu-ya in LA, and numerous other Sushi restaurants throughout the U.S.  Soho Sushi is number one in my list of Sushi Restaurants. 

You also can ask for special orders.  If John has it, he will serve it with great flair and quality.  The fish is fresh and tastes excellent.",6258XILAZC-ghTBJDiV09w,0,0,5,oiM4Oui8xRwLvq7NwkgDSA

I always feel a little bit guilty going to other sushi places as I feel like I'm betraying this joint LOL I also put off writing this review for the longest time, because my experience here was more than perfect and I just didn't know how to put it all into words. Did I mention the service here is amazing? I can honestly say that I have never received better service anywhere than I have here -- they really go above and beyond. 

The first time I came here, we had ordered uni (among other things).. just as I was saying how amazing it was, the chef came out with two more orders of uni for us because he didn't think the first order was good enough quality! The second time I came here and ordered Uni, the chef brought out more Uni from Japan so that I could compare it to the original from California! I am no uni connoisseur, but there was a noticeable (not in a bad way) difference! This was a very nice gesture, and I really liked that the chef takes time to get your opinion on the food. 

I never order California rolls because they are normally at the bottom of the sushi chain for me with that gross imitation crab meat & whatnot.. but OH leT me tellll ya .. it's SO DELICIOUS here! Huge lumps of real crab with avocado.. I can't help but crave their California roll sometimes being the crab lover I am. MMMmmm MMMMMM MMMMMMMM.

I also ordered the miso glazed black cod, and yuzu soy yellowtail along with some others that I forget. Everything was so fresh and delicious that you really can't go wrong with any item on this menu. My boyfriend has gotten so sick of sushi/japanese food since I always drag him with me on my adventures, but this is one place he WILL come with me to.. so that says a lot!

Everyone here is very friendly, which makes the entire experience that much more enjoyable. It really makes a difference when I go to restaurants because it sets the mood.. no one wants to start their meal with a debbie downer as it makes it hard to even enjoy your food!

It made my parents, who are traditionalists when it comes to Japanese cuisine, surprised and even a little impressed with the food and that you can actually go to a Japanese restaurant and not always have to order the same sushi/sashimi combo. Great place for family or dates. Will return as long as I'm in the area, for sure!",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,3,4,5,u4quUwtpyqNgdOqGP8te8Q

I really prefer simple sushi and nigiri that doesn't have a whole bunch of stuff piled in or on top, this place definitely caters to a simple sushi palate which is the main reason why I come here. Another great feature is that they have amazing portions a $15 sushi roll will have 10-12 pieces on the plate. I do wish they had an all you can eat but I don't think the menu is large enough for that. If you do stop by you should try the salmon belly nigiri it's so fresh and they bring a good sized sliver of it.

Fast forward to today. I met Chef Nunu. I think that's his name. Him and the other guys in the back were all cool. I have to say A+++++ for great customer service. Even the ladies are super nice and they remember everyone. Well maybe cause I'm there all the time LOL 

Today I decided to do something different and not order from the happy hour menu. I got the deluxe sashimi, ikura, chef special and green tea brûlée.

The deluxe sashimi had salmon, sea trout, tuna, scallops, and some other fishes. They have different types of fish every week. Well that's what the chef said. I'll sit at the bar next week and see what they have. Everything on my plate was delicious. Portions are huge too. I was full after I ate all my sashimi but still had a little bit of room LOL

The next thing I got was ikura aka salmon roe. It was like eating Nemo's brothers and sisters LOL the ikura is so good here. It has a sweet taste to it.

The last fish was salmon. I think they said it was Scotland salmon. It tasted buttery and super good. They topped it with ponzu sauce, avocado and hibiscus sugar. I thought combo was weird but it melted in my mouth. It was HELLA good. It's supposed to be on the new menu.

The green tea brûlée was better than the vanilla. You have to try it to believe it.

Warning: this place gets BUSY! They will have an hour wait on a random weeknight. During happy hour you must make a reservation or good luck getting a table. My only complaint is they typically don't have a lot of servers working so service does get extremely slow during busy hours. I've often had to wait a while to even be greeted by a server or have my food delivered to me. Plan to spend some time at Soho. 
It looks like a hole in the wall but it's gorgeous inside and a good atmosphere. They have TVs playing sports. It's the only place we can catch Dodger games around here! Also, though the same company I believe, don't mix this up with the sushi burrito place. That's across the street, and this is much better and different, in my opinion. 
Otherwise, the experience is to die for. The food is absolutely amazing. They even have one of the best lunch specials...so much food for such a good price. But happy hour is definitely my guilty pleasure. A menu full of $5 bites and drinks. The portions are pretty big, shareable among two. I love the carpaccio, the ribs, the rolls, the Brussels sprouts, there's really nothing I don't like on the happy hour menu. But please try the ribs, you won't regret it.

The Bone-In Short Rib was yummy as well...the meat just fell off the bone, the knife they provided was of no use! Haha.

Friendly staff who were very attentive and polite.  The owner came over to chat and gave us a free sample of the yellowtail so that we would have tried the raw fish and got to see how fresh it was for ourselves.  Roommate and I both had some of the bento boxes on the lunch menu and can I say I was pleasantly surprised.  The beef terriyaki bento box was a good size, not too large or small, came with salad and miso soup and the beef wasn't over cooked.  In fact it was almost tataki style (very red in the center).  I loved it!   The sauce came on the side which was nice too because I don't like when the terriyaki is just slathered on, I find that lazy.

The yellowtail was in a yuzu sauce that was just divine, and since it was my first time trying yellowtail and I enjoyed it, I am now a fan of that fish.

I would highly recommend this place to locals and tourists alike.  And I will be taking my boyfriend/friends here on future trips to the area.

I had a dinner date with two of my girlfriends and I chose this place for us. I was sure that we wouldn't be disappointed bc of all the positive reviews... But I was wrong! Kind of... Service was very slow. We still hadn't gotten our main dishes after thirty minutes... And we asked our server twice about our food.. She told us twice that she'd check... and then nothing. We did get our appetizers.. Slowly. Staff seems kind of all over the place..well anyway, after waiting... And we were starving, my friends got upset and wanted to leave.

Just sashimi..AND the restaurant was not busy! Well we decided to stay..(although we were in a grumpy mood by then) and then the owner of the restaurant came out and apologized for the slow service!

I only came back here bc the food was so good... But I do think the staff needs a little work. The owner seems to care a lot about what his customers think, which I think is wonderful.

1352455,2018-01-23,2,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Update to Soho's review was definitely needed. My friend and I had been wanting to come here for a while as we haven't been here for years. I randomly decided to ask her to come with me to dinner one afternoon and here this experience went. Lol Unfortunately, it was a day it rains in Vegas (as we all know, that doesn't happen often). I had got off work from a far hospital at 530ish, but due to the rain, it took a while for both of us to arrive at the restaurant. It was pretty busy at the restaurant and a lot of people waiting. I had asked the hostess what would happen if our wait for a table exceeds the time limit of happy hour (which was the main reason we wanted to come, and had come many times in the past), she had assured us that we will still receive the happy hour pricing, even if it passes the time. Great news as we would have been sad lol. I am not sure when they changed the times, but the happy hour now goes from 0400P - 0700P. Supposedly they take reservations now. Had i known earlier, i would have called. But as stated, it worked out anyway. 

After waiting a while, we had finally got a table maybe at 0645P. After we were seated, we had the happy hour menus. They seemed to have added some stuff since my last visit. Aside from the food, they offer beers/sake/sangria as cheap as $3 and wines at $5. 

SOHO Wings includes choice of garlic Parmesan, yuzu miso, or nutty habenero. I had asked for yuzu miso. Not as what i expected. It is mildly sweet with a very light hint of miso. The batter seems a bit ""thick"", not in actual thickness but it not being that light in texture. I'm still on the hunt for the best fried chicken in town, that can match the korean fried chicken in LA or Seoul. XD 

We had also tried the Firecracker roll because i had remembered there was a happy hour item that had crispy rice. This definitely was not it. Lol The firecracker roll states it includes deep fried, spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, and sweet onions. Neither of us like cream cheese in our sushi, so we opt'ed out of that. This was literally a deep fried spicy tuna roll topped with sweet onions and jalapeno. Wonder what the crispy rice one which resembles the crispy rice you get from like a dolsot bibimbap or those clay pot rice. Mildly weird with the sweet pickled-like onions on top. 

Typically our favorites from the old happy hour menu are the tostadas for a dollar and salmon avocado roll. Very simple items but yummy. 

The tostadas as previously made, were individual tostada chips with a good amount of toppings (salmon, tuna, octopus, or yellowtail). Now, the ""SOHO Tostada"" is a choice of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, or mixed seafood. They used to be simply made, with simple seasoning and ingredients. Tuna was very similar to hawaiian poke. Now, instead of individual topped tostadas, the fish of choice is placed in a small bowl in the middle of a plate with 5 tostada chips surrounding. You do get about the same amount of topping as you used to, if not more, but i feel like they add a lot of things to ""brighten"" it up like pineapples, etc. Still tasty but would have preferred how it used to be. Soho was known to use fresh fish so unsure why all the ""extra"" is needed. 

Best and simplest item is still the salmon avocado rolls. 8 pieces per order. Simply delicious. Nothing to be said. Fresh fish

Overall, glad they extended the happy hour but unfortunately even if I can get off at 4pm, most dont get off till at least 6. But i think happy hour runs into the weekend too, which i dont think they offered before (dont quote me on this, call to confirm....)

I used to get this ghost pepper chili sauce the owner/chef used to make. Unsure if this is still available. A previous time i had tried to ask for it and they said they didn't have it or didn't make it anymore. 

Overall, love their happy hour. Good for dinner or just a snack. XD (piggy)",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,4,4,v4z_2RFUVEgDTIWR62p46Q

The lunch set  menu is VERY reasonable. It ranges from $8.95-$10.95. It includes Soup (2 to choose from), choice of salad, soup, and main dish. For $2.00 more you can have a dessert with you meal. You can choose from Green Tea cheesecake or mochi ice cream. 

We got the sashimi set and the teriyaki salmon set. The sashimi were appropriately cut, you taste the freshness and sweetness of the fish. The teriyaki salmon was moist. The teriyaki sauce is played on a ramekins so you can control the amount of teriyaki sauce on you salmon. 

The baked muscles and oyster were just a good. The baked muscles were very meaty. 

The chef also threw in complimentary trout sashimi on a bed of ponzu . It was fresh with interesting texture from the pop rock. It's with the try.

My friend ordered the bento box off the lunch menu. The bento box came with rice, meat, salad, sashimi, and pickled cucumbers. The meat was perfect! Especially dipped in their sauce. 

We ordered the yellowtail yuzu soy to share. It was topped with fried jalepeno. I would definitely order this again!

I ordered the spicy soft shell crab. The reason why I only give Soho a 4 star is because it wasn't spicy at all. The roll had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, jalepeno, and spicy aioli.

Golden Ocean Trout, which is made with POP ROCKS on it. AMAZING!!!

Shrimp, Octopus, and Tuna Tostadas. Sooooo good. All of their tostadas are made differently. Extra variety!

Baked Mussels, not the best overall taste I've had, but the mussels themselves were fantastic.

Octopus Nigiri and Spicy Scallop Handroll were delicious. The Firecracker Roll was good. However my most favorite... Was that damn Crispy Tuna Roll. Holy crap.

Cucumber Salad, Miso, and Toban Seafood Soup were nice little side dishes. The chef also provides a free sashimi dish... You'll just have to find out what ;)

But.

To top it off? Dessert.

Green Tea Tiramisu. And Green Tea CREME.BRULEE. Jesus.

No really. Just Jesus.

I might actually have to pay a bit of money here"" and then you sit down and at the end of your meal they hand you the check and you're like.. ""wow that's a decent price!""

Granted that decent price only comes during happy hour or lunch time, but still! It's a very welcome surprise.

I've eaten the sashimi lunch special practically every time that I've come here and let me tell you... This is definitely the place you want to come if you want fish quality that's above average for a price that won't leave you begging for OT at work. Keep in mind that this deal is only available during lunch, but when you're paying a little over $10 for 7 pieces of sashimi, rice, salad, miso soup, and a random side dish? I'd eat lunch here every day if I could.

On the days when I'm feeling like a million bucks, I sometimes go out of my way to order the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy dish. It is AWESOME. Aside from that..

TOSTADAS: Tako is slightly spicy, salmon is delicious, Hamachi was on the plain side, tuna poke was the best. $1 each HH, regularly $2/ea.
HYDROBIB BLACK COD: delicate but flavorful, loved the soft texture of the fish contrasting with the fresh crunch of the lettuce.
FIRECRACKER ROLL: a favorite roll! Packs a nice punch of heat with spicy tuna and jalapeno, cools it down with a minimal amount of cream cheese and great texture and flavor of sweet onion. Unique!
SALMON AVOCADO ROLL: simple and delicious
CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI: BF's favorite, good-sized portion with a lot of sauce, served on a bed of crunchy radish.
IKA GESO: Tasty surprise! A bar-food take on fried squid with a dust of spice, served with a curry mustard sauce. The sauce makes it!
BAKED MUSSELS: Large, tender, and saucy.

Added the server's recommendation, YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI, their ""signature dish"". It was good, with generous slices of fish and light but flavorful garlic-ponzu, but not something I haven't had elsewhere.

Ultimately, I came here due to the Yonaka comparisons and was pleased with the fish quality and the great flavors but feel the menu is mostly great quality versions of common sushi staples- would love to see them add some more unique or inventive dishes, like the ika gesso.

I especially loved the Ocean Trout (Steelhead) Sashimi with pop rocks. We ordered it for the novelty of the menu description, but it was the stand out of our meal. Everything was wonderful. Chef Lee (formally of Social House) came by our table and spent some time with us, inquiring about our impressions of his restaurant and our preferences. He challenged us on Uni, probably the one sushi/sashimi component that I generally do not like. He generously introduced us to the EXTREMELY fresh Santa Catalina and other Uni that he selects. I have to say that even though I am not a Uni fan, I now think my hesitancy on Uni has been the fact that it is rarely presented as fresh and clean as what Soho offers. 

We explored the rest of this eclectic menu and every selection was outstanding. We finished up on a short ribs dish that put us over the top. Every minute of our meal was a favor fest.

First of all, we wanted to sample a variety of fish so we ordered like 5 types of sashimi. I usually steer clear from the pre-selected plates since I want to have control. However, our server Sheila said there was a large plate for much cheaper and basically she would get us what we wanted. Vegas baby!

So, we got some salmon, scallop, albacore, yellowtail and regular tuna. All outstanding. FYI if you have never had sashimi scallop, it's a must try. If it sucks then it's not fresh enough. This one was pretty good. These are large pieces too, nothing wimpy. Soy sauce was good. Ginger was fresh. Wasabi packed a lot of heat.

Then we got a handful of rolls--spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, twin dragon ... and did we get the firecracker too? Anyway, again all excellent.

A bottle of sake later, we decided to hit the uni. My friend and I have had limited and bad experiences with uni, either bad quality or tried so long ago just bad memories. Our server convinced us their quality was outstanding so we got some Catalina ones and she had them throw in some Hokkaido ones as well since we had trouble making up our minds. Wow! Ridiculously good--buttery, silky, no fishy or slimy nastiness.

As if that wasn't enough, we kept talking about coming back during this trip and she said we would have to try the wagyu if we do. We ask if they just have it for dinner? Nope, lunch too. Since we could die before the next time out, we decide to go ahead and get it now. Vegas baby! And as if we were not winning enough, $25 for 2 oz of rare Kagoshima prefecture wagyu. Wuuuut? I mean this is a steal!!! Makes up for the money I lost gambling. In most restaurants you are talking about $25-35 per ounce of this delicacy. Needless to say, it was outstanding. It was served with some sauces and salt, etc on the side.

I tell ya. We probably ate $400 worth but it was way below that. The service was awesome, friendly and the ambience was nice for a little strip mall joint. We are definitely going back on the next trip out. My friend's high roller friend says it's the best in Vegas.

Soho is opened by Chef John who was one of the executive chefs at Social House at Crystals.

I cannot stress enough how good the food is here. Especially the sashimi. I know it takes years to be able to master cutting sashimi. It's not as simple as just slicing a cut of fish. And Chef John is amazing. Plus he selects only premium quality fish.

First time we came here was just by chance. It was about 4pm and we were hungry. I had heard about Soho through some co-workers and so we decided to check it out. They were serving happy hour during that time and so we ordered some tostadas and a few rolls. We had noticed how good the tuna had been. Towards the end of that meal Chef John came out and was introducing himself to all of his customers. He came by and spoke with us for a little and then told us he was going to send over the house special Yellowtail Ponzu Soy.. pffft. BOMB. SO DAMN GOOD. It was melt in your mouth sashimi.

The service is not bad. It's not fine dining so don't expect them to be hoovering over you. Although they are still pretty attentive. The storefront is very misleading as it looks very generic and plain. But Chef John really puts effort into his restaurant. During one visit we came for lunch we got a small little sushi keychains when we got the check. 

YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE. If you can appreciate great sushi and sashimi then this place is for you. The sashimi melts in your mouth and the uni is the BEST uni I've ever, EVER had.

**side note: being from an island and having been to Japan. The quality of fish/sushi here is definitely not taken lightly.",q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw,9,7,5,0cgpgyGNIkdL4bLCFIaTBQ

Sorry I can't remember the exact closing time.  The menu is a bit different and the portions are a little smaller but the whole quality and commitment to excellence is still there.  The owner is splitting his time between the full service and their newer fast food restaurant platform.  But still people waiting to get in at 5pm so all good!! We had several things twice! We loved their scallop hand rolls. So much that we had two orders (each!) and 4 orders of Uni.  Delicious!!!! We also had the VERY BEST Salmon collar I think we have ever had I any restaurant.

Due to the uncertain work schedules of my friends, we weren't able to make a reservation anywhere on a Friday night in time for a celebration. However, stumbling on Soho's page with its boastful ""walk ins welcome,"" we decided to swing by there instead of gamble our chances at one of the busier AYCE spots up the street. Arriving at Soho though, which was pretty quiet with a few folks sitting waiting, we were quickly informed it would be a 45 min-1 hour wait... Um, where exactly are walk ins welcome then? Do you even understand what that means? The kicker was that they were holding three huge tables for reservations that hadn't yet come through. 

Looking through reviews now, obviously I should've realized this claim was baseless - many state that you should make reservations ahead of time. No idea why they think ""walk ins welcome"" is something that accurately describes their restaurant! The rub of it all is that we did end up at an very popular AYCE place up the street since it had only a 30 min wait.

Happy hour prices, portion and quality were amazing. We had the:
- Hydro Bibb Black Cod (nice big chunk of cod), 
- shrimp tempura, 
- spicy tuna roll (good quality, not masked by a lot of hot sauce), 
- fire cracker roll (inside was kind of mushy and flavors weren't distinct), 
cajun albacore sashimi (awesome fish quality), 
- baked mussels (LOVED the flavor. LOVED, loved, LOVED the sauce; mussels had a good texture) and 
- jalapeno poppers (way bigger than I expected). 

We also got the matcha tiramisu. It was DELICIOUS!! LOTS OF FLAVOR. (Unfortunately they were out of the green tea creme brulee.) The iced green tea was a little watered down (tasted like sugar cane water, couldn't really taste the tea).

I love that the happy hour portions are full sized/order. The quality is good and fresh. They don't use a ton of rice either (huge 'plus' in my book). The food came out fast and hot.

Service was reeeeally good. Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and tentative. I appreciate that she didn't treat us different or worse because we mainly ordered from the happy hour menu.

1597859,2014-08-07,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"My wife and I were in town from NYC for a couple of days and we wanted to get off the strip and away from the crowds.  We are big sushi lovers, and have quite a few favorite places back home.  After looking at Yelp, we chose SOHO. 

Wow...what an incredible choice.  It's a small place...intimate...without a lot of the glitz of LV.  That's ok...we've gotten our fill of that on this trip.   What we wanted was some quiet so we could re-connect and just enjoy some really good sushi

We got all of that and more.  From the time we walked in, the staff was incredibly attentive and accommodating.  Our server Angelica made some great recommendations...the yellowtail, especially, being one of the freshest and most succulent sashimi dishes we've ever eaten.  

We made three choices, and after we were done, we ordered one additional roll. I wasn't even that hungry, but the food was so good I felt obligated!   When we were done with that our server brought another plate over. My wife said ""oh, we didn't order that,"" and she said ""this is from the chef.""

It was ocean trout, which we'd never had before.  It was a deep red, like salmon, with a meatier taste.  Outstanding!  Later, John came to out table.  He's the chef and owner, and he explained that he thought we'd enjoy the ocean trout because he'd seen the other items we'd chosen.  Very thoughtful, and always a treat to meet the owner and the person who prepared our meal.

I think that's the true secret to SOHO...pride and passion.  Not only was John personally invested in us, but all of his employees clearly took steps to ensure we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  John and his entire team went ""the extra mile"" to please us, and they succeeded with flying colors.  

We would highly recommend SOHO. It's a little out of the way, but that's the charm, and it is WELL WORTH the journey.  Oh, and a bonus?  It's probably about 30% less than you'd pay on the strip for less flavor and quality.  Sushi lover?  Don't miss this place!!",qUq_6nzy-nQcTS7LImDidg,1,0,5,ca1WnZrv18uGbjMJOqlSuA

Myself and my date got there at 7:30 on a Thursday night with a 15 minute wait. Not bad at all, the hostess was very polite and took my name down. We had a beer next door and had a table 12 minutes later. Then this place began to shine. 

I ordered the same thing I ordered at every new sushi place I try. The common every day sushi items that are either sub bar, usual or extraordinary. Salmon and Salmon roe nigiri and a spicy tuna roll. This place blew my mind. The Salmon tasted like an Alaskan stream ran through the restaurant. The roe had the perfect consistency. An 'al dente' texture to its bite and a pleasant fresh saltiness. The spicy tuna was perfect. 

I was almost about to start popping bottles and shaking hands and then something bad happened. My soft shell crab roll didn't appear for 10 minutes, then 15 and then 20.

This was outrageous good service. I hadn't even complained yet, but they knew. ""From the chef"" he said. And walked away politely, then my roll came out.

1645944,2015-05-02,1,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Intro: My boyfriend and I love having a favorite sushi restaurant. After moving close-ish to the Vegas area, we weren't too impressed with what the strip had to offer because it all seemed overpriced and overhyped. We came here on a whim because we were hungry and this popped up on Yelp.

Pros:
-This place is absolutely amazing!!! The selection is completely unique!! What made our first visit to the restaurant a very memorable one was when the chef came out to say hi and recommend the ocean fish dish. It had an indescribable sauce (I think yuzu was in it?) and was topped with poprocks and I know that sounds strange but oh my god was it delicious!! Who would've thought? But I don't think we would've ventured beyond the happy hour menu if he hadn't suggested it.
-The happy hour is a REALLY good deal but only offers so much. Don't be afraid like we were to try other things on the menu!!
-There seems to be an army of people preparing sushi every time we go, which I feel reflects on how much priority they put on the creation of the dishes.
-Lychee or peach sake is so good! Again, we got it off the happy hour menu but I couldn't finish it by myself, they give you a decent amount. The glassware it comes in is utterly impressive too. I will have to take a picture and post it in the future....Looks like a bowl of ice water with a tulip bulb shaped vessel that sits in it. Guaranteed to make you feel fancy.
-The atmosphere is non-intimidating and feels cozy yet clean and modern. 

Cons:
-Getting overstuffed on so much awesome!!!
-It's not dirt cheap, be ready to shell out $25-$30 per person if you're really hungry. Maybe $20 per person if you're moderately hungry.

Conclusion:
This is a one-of-a-kind sushi establishment and the kind of restaurant everyone needs to try at least once. It feels like you're that person on food network trying that really amazing artfully compiled dish with the ""MMMmmm"" face.",plxPG1bueP94VGRSWxQMlg,4,2,5,9UTx9jBpwCfXrZr88YQAzA

Sounds funny but I can only take so much sausage and these are full kurobuta sausages. Ika geso is another one I could do without. 

For the good-the happy hour rolls, poke tostada, and the black cod lettuce wrap. 

Due to the good experiences the first 2 times we came back on a Friday night. It was packed and there was a long wait. They said 20 minutes but it ended up being about 35 minutes. The sashimi mixed plate was ordered and very good. I did not care for the scallop and I am usually a big scallop fan. It tasted fishy.

The place itself is nothing special with disappointing decor but it's all about the food and service so the good news is that both were great! We arrived a few mins after happy hour ended and our server told us the unfortunate news. Luckily the girl next to her saw me take out my yelp app and came right over to ask, is it your first time? We'll extend it for you...:) Woo hoo! We were thrilled because we wanted to try happy hour out first! 

Started with the tuna tostada, amazing! Sweet and fresh and the perfect way to start our meal! Also a very delicate & modern presentation. 

Next came the stuffed mushrooms, not a fan at all. The flavors were ok but the breading was dense and the bites were heavy. I didn't enjoy it.

Next came the Cajun albacore sashimi. My favorite dish of the evening. So fresh and delicate and very mild in flavor. Like butter...

Next the cod, my second favorite item. It was cooked perfectly, sweet & tender. 

Next the firecracker roll. Great combinations of flavors with sweet onions on top and over all a very well balanced roll. Crunchy, creamy, sweet & spicy.

Next the Ika Geso, octopus! It was tossed an a very addicting curry powder! 

And lastly a spicy tuna roll, filled with tuna! And a shrimp tempura roll. Both were great!

All this delicious food was only $40 for happy hour! An incredible value and over all a very good time! 

Hope someone comes in with some decorating skills or I'll do it on trade :)

This place is so awesome, we had to come twice on our short Vegas NYE trip. This will forever be my first stop whenever in Vegas!

This beats any sushi restaurant or buffet on the Vegas strip, so if you've stumbled across this restaurant like me, consider yourself lucky. The quality of sashimi is amazing! Everything melts in your mouth, and the prices are really decent. They offer amazing bento lunch specials, too. I love my sashimi so I got the sashimi bento both times I was here. They also have appetizers called ""Tadas"" which are little sashimi appetizers on top of crispy gyoza wrappers. Definitely worth a try! Or like me, order one (or a few) of everything.

Lastly, Green Tea tiramisu is not to be missed...that is if you still have room in your stomach. Can't wait to come back next time.",q841aGW6y2D3OwSRB6w6nw,4,2,5,ny6ZHNoHmGA8bKBesBb9ig

1710992,2014-06-25,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Finding hidden gems like SoHo Japanese Restaurant is why I love yelp!  I was scanning through the typical Vegas tourist spots for dinner when I came across SoHo.  Seeing a restaurant with over 350 reviews and a perfect 5 star score is a rarity so I knew I had to investigate further.  The restaurant is located about 5 miles off the Las Vegas strip, I believe the cab ride cost around $17 coming from Mandalay Bay.  It was well worth the drive! 

When we arrived it happened to be happy hour and SoHo has some GREAT Happy Hour Specials.  Everything is absolutely fantastic and fantastically priced!!

Among some of the standouts and must orders if you visit: 

Black Cod Happy Hour Special is a must try, you might even order 2 
Ahi Poki Tostada Happy Hour Special: you will definitely order 2
Yellow Fin with jalapeño - Fantastically delicious  
Golden Trout with Pop rocks (yep, pop rocks!)
Angus Beef Tataki - tastes as good as it looks
Soft Shell Crab Special - breaded and fried, served with three amazing dipping sauces.  If it's available (seasonal) get it!  
Bone in Short Rib - fell right off the bone.  Moist, tender and totally delicious.

Green Tea Crème Brûlée to finish off the meal - no words left to describe this except a heavenly finish to an outstanding meal.  

So now that I've listed almost the entire menu as ""must try"" I hope you understand the level of enthusiasm I have for this restaurant and it's food.  To add to the experience Chef John, owner and executive chef, came by to visit our table.  It was instantly apparent his love for what he does and his appreciation for good food.  His message to us was he wanted to take the Vegas dining experience off the strip and bring it to where the locals can enjoy.  I hope he plans to expand to Washington, DC!!!",gfd-COa4wX743CWNv3__xA,3,1,5,4HMBAxLo1WbRJ_5oiSkhQA

1738154,2013-12-12,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Parking (3/5):
I went to Soho for a Yelp - UYE event. Its located on Jones; couple blocks south of  215. Location is easy to find, but parking might be an issue on busy night. 

Atmosphere (4/5):
Average noise levels, very comparable to other sushi or AYCE restaurants. Good for a large gathering, etc.

Service (3/5):
This place was very accommodating with 15-20 people. All though it could be because they knew that we were with Yelp. It seemed like that their staff was not the most attentive or trained. One of the waitress actually managed to pour left over sauce over  one the my friend's dress. Which was an accident, but that just shows that they need to improve their Service.

Food (3/5):
Food was way better than their service. Restaurant actually made a tasting menu for everyone at the table. Here is what we had.

Seared Tuna with Tempura Jalapenos: It will be spicy. Seared Tuna was fresh, but I am not sure if Jalapenos go well with it. Also, there was lot of ponzu sauce.

Pot-stickers Meh... I would say avoid it, you do not go to restaurant like this for their pot-stickers. They didn't seem fresh and it seemed like they were adding them to our tasting menus cause they had bunch sitting around in the freezer.

Seared Yellow-tail: The fish was fresh and it was seared to perfect amount. Unlike the Tuna, they didn't over do it with sauce. Presentation was good to.

Oysters: They were not good. I do not like oysters drenched with sauce. Specially when its  sweet and sour. Oysters are enjoyed with light lemon juice. That's it. 

Short-Rib: Pièce de résistance of the meal. You will see lot of reviews mentioning this and that is with the best reason. It's the main highlight of this restaurant and they know it (~$20 for a rib). The meat falls of the bone and it practically dissolves in your mouth. The taste is exquisite. Some short ribs did have a lot of fat on it, but its up to personal preference. Some people prefer the flavors that fat adds to a meal. I personally don't enjoy it because it will add another mile of running to my daily cardio. 

Over all this restaurant is not bad for the location it's in, but if you have a choice of going to other place then I would highly recommend picking something else. The short-rib is the main attraction, but its not fully worth the price when you get a short-rib full of fat and less meat. Also, service needs a bit of a work.

Average: 3.5/5 - Being a man of science I round it down to (3/5), so other or I strive for more perfection. :D",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,7,3,3,fXcDXxVBLeIjrFAloip5JQ

1744631,2017-03-30,3,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I've given a lot of restaurants 5 stars, but if I could give Soho more, I would a thousand times over. It's not every day that I walk out of a restaurant touched by the service. I am definitely coming back here (for happy hour.....because I am a poor poor grad student). Their fish is fresh; and the price is amazing.

I went with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday early. We went around 4:30PM for happy hour, and I was surprised that there was a pretty big crowd already. It seems that you can make reservations during happy hour, so I will definitely place a reservation next time. They asked us if it'd be okay to seat us at the sushi bar, and we said okay. AND THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER. Thank you Soho for my memorable birthday dinner!

I wish I got the chef's name, but my bad. He handed us our wasabi/ginger right after we sat down. We also ordered directly with him; for the drinks, we ordered with the waitress. Since every dish on the happy hour menu was 5 bucks, we kind of went crazy with ordering. I don't usually like talking to the chefs because I'm awkward, but he stroke up a convo with us, and I'm glad I responded. He found out it was our first time there/we were there celebrating for my birthday.

Halfway through our meal, he gave us a yuzu yellowtail dish on the house just because it was our first time there. It was such a nice gesture. When we asked for the check, it took them longer than usual because they were prepping a complimentary dessert for my birthday. The whole staff sang to me as they placed the dish in front of me. I think I'm especially touched because even though I was just ordering off the happy hour menu, Soho did not skimp on the customer service. 

Food wise, at least on the happy hour menu, the fusion foods are where it's at. The best things we had definitely were the tostadas. They're kind of like a poke/ceviche mix that you eat with fried wonton chips. It was awesome. My boyfriend also loved all of the sashimi with sauces. (He has a thing for ponzu though) The JPOP alcoholic drink was sooooo good; it was just like drinking a soda, and I like sweet/fruity drinks. The karage was just okay--but for 5 bucks, I'm not complaining.

I decided to check out this restaurant because it had such a high rating, and being the skeptic I am, I was looking for stuff to critique.  However, the worst I can say is that their popularity has outgrown their dining space.  Even so, the wait was still less than half an hour for a table, and it was well worth the wait.

I arrived at 5:50 pm on a Saturday night, hoping I might catch a happy hour special, but the dining room was packed, and there was a wait list, so I didn't get a seat until 6:17.

The servers were surprisingly quick considering how busy they were, and they were definitely on top of the drinks and meal orders.  I ordered the Garlic Shishito Peppers appetizer, and it was quite tasty.  It had a spiciness that sneaks up on you, so the first several didn't taste hot at all, but eventually it kicks you in the face if you keep going.  After researching these peppers, I found that one expert claimed 1 in 12 is actually spicy whereas the rest are generally sweet.  I think my experience was about 1 in 5...  Even when I got a spicy one though, I'd still put them below jalapenos in heat, so if you have no problems eating jalapenos, these won't challenge you.  Also, for only $4, it's a must-order for those who enjoy spicy appetizers.

For my second appetizer, I tried the Hydro Bibb Black Cod (a good deal at just $7), which was possibly the most delicious appetizer I've ever had, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that.  The fish melts in your mouth, and the lettuce and garnish perfectly complemented the flavor that was cooked into the cod.  I just wish I had taken a photo before I devoured this dish.  If you only try one thing, make it this appetizer!

Next, I thoroughly enjoyed the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy Sashimi.  Like all their food, it was noticeably fresh, with perfectly flavored sauce, and as their signature dish is well worth the trip just on its own.  The only downside on this dish is that being sashimi, it is not going to fill you up, so you'll have plenty of room to order more.

I enjoyed an order of the edamame with my main entrees, and it was good, but nothing spectacular: standard boiled and salted soy beans (or squeezy beans as my 7-year-old niece calls them), and it came with a side dish of a sweet sauce although I prefer to eat them as is.

Finally, I ordered their signature roll, the Twin Dragon, which is definitely more of a filling main course (I couldn't finish all of mine, so I took it in a to-go box).  Its description is what you'd expect in a dragon roll: shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado, and crab meat, but it's definitely one of the better dragon rolls I've had, and the double shrimp on top with their delectable sauce made it clear why this is one of their most popular rolls.",7lDVosbPQq0qvTeHX0rd9Q,2,0,5,NBW3yc7-INcN5y5CwzTyew

I can't say Soho will make me go to my favorite sushi bars less but I may come back here on occasion.  We sat at the sushi bar which was awkward because you can't fit your legs under the bar. There is a slanted piece of wood that runs the whole length of the bar that prevents you from sliding your legs under.  The chairs are very big and comfy so that makes up for it.  It was also very cold at the sushi bar so bring a jacket or dress warm if you plan to sit there.  We were both dressed warm but we were freezing.   Our favorite was probably the lettuce wrapped cod-I forgot to take a pic.

Service was exceptional and attentive.  5/5
  
The prices 5/5 very reasonable for great quality and super fresh fish. 

Not a 5 star rating because I am not dying to go back.  Usually when I eat somewhere exceptional I want to rush back within the next day or two.  I will return someday though to try more menu items and I especially want to sample the desserts.

Their sashimi combinations always executed expectations. Front their traditional assortments to their contemporary interpretations.

1963211,2014-10-12,1,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"after eating at a bunch of overrated, overpriced places on the strip, soho was our last stop before heading to the airport. BEST DECISION EVER. 

soho's salmon wasabi creme is tied for 1st place in my experience as far as the fattiest, most buttery, melt-in-your-mouth salmon sashimi i've ever had. i am not a wasabi fan at all but the flavors balanced and blended beautifully. and extra points for presentation! my friend's fiance said this dish was so good he almost cried haha. 

next up was the yellowtail yuzu soy, which was also incredible. i'm a bit biased though bc my love for salmon trumps all else, but this was honestly the best yellowtail i've had. flavors were light and citrusy and the flavor of the fish still shined through. 

the twin dragon roll (alaskan king crab, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, avocado) was huge for the price we paid. local supermarkets where i live have dinky, terrible rolls for $8-12 and this was just a few bucks more and so so much more legit! this was my favorite roll at soho. 

the triple s roll (scallops, shrimp, and something else? i can't remember) was good but not too memorable. the twin dragon was definitely better! 

my black miso cod lettuce wraps came out after we had finished eating all the sushi and at that point i was pretty stuffed. i had an absolutely delectable miso cod dish at izakaya den in denver and was hoping for something similar but this was nothing close. the sweet sauce was too thick and heavy for the delicate fish and the hot fish on lettuce was just weird. 

trout sashimi with pop rocks (compliments of the chef) arrived at the end of our meal. it was perfect because we had been so curious about it when we were looking at the menu... i didn't know if it would just be an insult to the fish or somehow epic. mm it was more the first than the second. i'm glad i didn't pay $$ for it and it was definitely generous of the chef to give us the opportunity to try such a unique dish! (seems like they do that a lot-- so nice.) 

unfortunately, they were out of the supposedly amazing green tea tiramisu. next time!

and i'm serious. i am pretty much sick of the strip but i will come back to vegas just to visit soho! sushi that's hard to beat + super reasonable prices = one of the best of the best! :) :) :)",u2VHGBc2VkUZHIzdP0DtiQ,2,2,5,qo4ePoBmtwzQmwmURw_V6w

I have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word, starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)

Unreal! These prices are too good to be true... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running, not walking, to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.  

Took some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park! 

Some things that I recommend trying are:

Ty Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)

SOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)

Beef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite, pictured.)

Rock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeño aioli and the sweet banana sesame)

Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)

Soft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite, pictured)

Crème Brûlée (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double, she knows all about it! *wink*)

If there's something you usually order that is not on the menu, ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not. 

I would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself, Mr. John Lee, came out to welcome us. He made us feel like true VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best. 

I have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire, mark my words! 

I'm eating there again tonight. Yep, it is THAT good!

Update: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently, one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease.

We were visiting from out of town, and a friend (LV Local) suggested trying this place out. We were not disappointed!! We came during the evening of 5-15-14...

When I walked in, I was surprised at the casual / non traditional setting. Don't let it fool you! The fish was exceptional. We sat at the bar & asked the chef to surprise us. He quickly provided us with carefully paired pieces of fish; we had salmon, yellowtail, butterfish... Each one was delicious. For ""dessert"" I like to finish with either Toro or Uni; we tried 3 different types of Uni. The chef was super friendly and very kind. The Uni was fantastic (of the 3 options, the Japanese was our favorite).

Service is good but I would recommend sitting at the bar to enjoy the good company of the chefs! Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be back. Don't bother with the restaurants on the strip.... This is a quality sushi restaurant with great value. Our bill was under 100$ and we were drinking and had lots of food. Totally worth it.

I miss the lunch bento tray.  It made feel like I was eating a lot more food.  It was the same amount of food as previous lunches but in the round plates, but I was still feeling hungry.

2082263,2013-10-15,2,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I'm going against my own rules here (writing a review not only before I've tried it twice, but before I've finished the first meal!!), but this place is... Not just ONE word to describe it! This place caught me by surprise. Here's why:

When I pulled up to the front, I thought, it's nothing special to look at, basic strip mall sushi place. I walked in and the setup is modest, almost unsure of itself. I looked at the menu and saw that there weren't MANY options, but I stayed positive. I was meeting a friend there who had been there the night before and asked me to go with her tonight again so there must be something about this place...

She arrived and we began ordering our basic favorites. For me, it's just a simple Philly roll. She warned me that if I didn't like smoked salmon, to ask for fresh. When I try somewhere new, I like to try new things but I gauge how far I'm willing to go by the predictable. ""If I don't like the smoked salmon, I'll stick to the beginner rolls"" is what went through my mind. After the first bite of ""beginner"" Philly roll, I realized, this is the big league. Beyond fresh. Strip quality. Local pricing. I. WANT. MORE.

I ordered a Firecracker roll, which sounds like it may be spicy, but Sushi Chef John Lee (the owner and head sushi chef of Soho, previously known as executive chef of Social House at Crystals CityCenter, whom I also had the honor to meet and speak with at length) knows his fish pairings. The Firecracker roll was the perfect amount of spicy, sweet, crunchy, and smooth. It found itself somewhere between amazing and incredible on my scale of taste. Best of all, though, it was $9. I immediately had doubt that I would find anything better on the menu. BOOOYYYYYYY was I in for a ride!!!

My friend ordered a Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll because she only got one piece the day prior due to her party eating it all. Ha! Needless to say, I only got one piece of that one too! So I ordered my own as well. WOW. Normally I'm hesitant about soft shell. I've had a few questionable experiences with it and I feel like I'd rather just not take the chance again but this make... ""Speechless"" is what comes to mind. Trust me on this if nothing else, TRY IT. Take one bite and you'll understand.

Aside from the sushi rolls, we also ordered Angus Beef Tataki. I've had it before at another Japanese restaurant in Vegas and LOVED it. Sushi Chef John Lee creates all his own sauces, many which use citrus as an ingredient. He paired the beef with a mild but savory sauce that can only be described as succulent. Presented beautifully like all his plates, I almost feel bad that I destroyed it. :D

We ordered several more dishes (WAYYY too many to describe right now) and they're all borderline orgasmic. I toughed it through to manage a dessert as well due to a picture I saw on yelp of a Green Tea Tiramisu. Being part Italian and having lived in Italy for 4 years, I can judge harshly on any food claiming to be ""Italian"" or using ""Italian ingredients or methods""... I'll say it fast... Italy should take note... This dessert was shocking. Green Tea.... Tiramisu.... It's a combination that could rival the tastebud tickling that José Andrés has done at China Poblano at The Cosmopolitan. Not bashing him at all, I find him to be an incredible magician of food, but this sole dessert is something else. Something intriguing. Now only to avoid the mafia from here on out...

Just prior to leaving (we had stayed a measly 2.5 hours... NBD...), Sushi Chef John Lee asked how everything had been for us, to which we applauded and both agreed to write 5 star reviews. Then he said, ""Thank you, but all I want is for you to leave happy, having enjoyed the food that I can make for you."" So I replied, ""Well, I'm leaving sad.... But it's only because I have to leave."" He laughed and thanked us again and we departed.

Lastly, thank you Bobbi for taking me here! And if you'd like to ""duke"" it out for that crown, I'm all yours baby! ;)",2qcyv_AKAUnAF9IOSjezKg,6,3,5,PIVcr--PJ1NMLFZksCnGTg

I loved that they have options to add Uni and the Ikura on top of the Oysters. We did that and it was delicious. 

I personally loved the Duo Tuna that you can choose the kind ( fat or lean). The Duo was yummy!
The Shishito peppers was good but I expected to get some spicy one but got none. Hamachi Kama was very tasty. The skin was crispy outside and the fish meat was soft and tasty inside. We had it with the Ponzu sauce. 

For the price range compared to what we got, it was very good. We satisfied what we expected and felt it was worth the trip to swing by. The look from the outside of the restaurant could be misleading as it was in a general looking shopping complex. I think this was so much better deal than many places in the strip.

Service - Both times the service has been exceptional but this time the service is above par. The male server that I have the pleasure of serving me is not only friendly, but super funny, personable, and knowledgable. 

Food - Fresh is definitely the name of the game. I typically eat sashimi so I always know if a place isn't getting in in regular. I even tried the Miso Black Cod and all I can say is Yummy! 

Drinks - They only have beer/wine/sake but they have a fantastic bottle of Sparkling Sake for only $18 so it's perfect for me.

Went here last week at about 8 p.m. and had to wait 30 min for a table for a party of 2. My sister & I were starrrrving and our table couldn't have come any sooner.

Ordered:
1. salmon tostada & yellowtail tostada ($2 each). I love yellowtail but actually preferred the salmon one. They were still both delicious! I loved the avocado and chip thing the fish came on. The only thing I would change about this dish is I would make it at least two times bigger! So friggin tiny, especially if you're friggin starving and ready to eat a horse!!!

2. Spicy tuna on crispy rice. This was my first time ordering this and now I order it everywhere I go, hoping to get the same taste! The rice is crispy on the outside but perfectly chewy on the inside. I would definitely order this again when I go back.

This small, yet very homey eatery, captures the feel of higher end locations, and actually kicks their butt in the menu department. 

The service was great, I almost felt like a VIP. Starting with the lady who greeted us, to our very knowledgeable waiter Darrell, and the sweet lady assisting him, we got the royal treatment, and were quite impressed with the fabulous selections they recommended. Talk to Darrell and let him tell you what's up, we did and were quite happy.

 When one considers where this really is, it is even more amazing; not on the strip or in some high end casino, but in a small strip mall out in the desert. The values are here, but you can also step things up a notch or two if that is your party's desire. Nice place!",a9MXSQst1AHCzRJ6AVzGow,2,0,5,X5azw19BkHTtbv7MOpWUQg

2244808,2014-10-17,3,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Came across this place because of the high rating on yelp and because we were tired of all the subpar AYCE sushi that we always go to every time in Vegas.  Some times you just gotta go for quality over quantity.

First off, we were greeted very warmly and it was very evident from the get go that service is a priority at this restaurant.  She explained what the most popular dishes and specials of the day were.  We ended up going with a few of them and were not disappointed.

The highlight of the evening was the Hamachi with yuzu, shoyu and fried serrano chili ($12).  So good.  Hamachi was super tender, the yuzu, ponzu sauce was awesome and the thinly sliced serrano chili added a nice kick of heat, it's mild because it's so thinly sliced and also fried so it takes some of the heat out.  Everyone agreed it was the favorite dish.  Thanks for our waitresses recommendations!  I can see why its their most popular dish.

Big eye poke ($15) was excellent quality of fish but i thought there was too much sesame oil, i ended up dipping each piece in shoyu to cut thru it, so good.

Garlic Tuna tataki ($12) very fresh fish and tasty.

Tadas ($2 each) Their take on tostadas, nice little bites of raw fish on mini deep-fried wontons.  We tried the salmon and hamachi.  Wish i had tried them all, but theres always next time.

We also ordered 2 rolls ($15 each), the Twin Dragon and Triple S, mostly for filler since most of our items didn't include rice.  The Triple S  (scallop, shrimp and spicy tuna) was kind of forgettable.  The Twin Dragon however, was delicious!  King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and shrimp tempura on top.  It had a very strong shell fish flavor and a nice crunch from the 2 shrimp tempura on top.

After eating that we ordered the mixed tempura ($7), nice and crunchy and a nice selection, shrimp, broccoi, kabocha, shishito pepper, cant remember the other stuff.  We also ordered King Crab tempura too, which was nice, but pricy. a few pieces of crab leg lightly battered, Yum!

Garlic shishito peppers - it had a sweetness to it that i didn't care for, but one of my friends though it was the best dish of the evening.

The decor is a bit confusing, it looks a bit thrown together but the food is very good and very fresh, but what most stands out is the service!",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,4,3,4,kPT0AgPi_59bc-wjP5DtiQ

Service: 0/5
Food: 1.5/5
Organization: -10/10

There is no flow here. Workers are too busy dancing/playing or on their phones.

When we came in, we waited for a table. At least 7 tables were open, all 4 high tops were open. We were told to wait. Eventually girl 1 came to us and told us only tables available were the high tops and bar seats. We said the high tops were fine, they told us to seat ourselves. We sat ourselves and a different girl (girl 2) gave us our menus and walked away. After waiting a bit, guy 1 gave us water and walked away. We looked at the menu and waited for the server/guy 1 to come back. Waited a while but Guy 1 was busy bussing tables. We waited about 10 minutes. I was staring at the back but everyone was huddled up talking and joking around. Then Guy 1 went to the back. Eventually Guy 2 got the hint and came up to us and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered everything in one go. Sodas came. Food took awhile to come out as in it came out one by one. We tried to get our servers attention. Eventually girl 2 asked if i needed a refill... told her yes and my boyfriend needed a refill too. Waited for her to come back for 5 minutes but saw her come back to the front and just stand there. Eventually girl 3 came with my drink but my boyfriend's drink was forgotten. We were ready to leave by now. 

No one has a specific role here. It seems like they believe it is teamwork but there is a lack of  organization and consideration. Everything and everyone was all over the place. The food was nothing amazing or memorable. 

In my opinion, they need to figure out how to organize and work everything out. Everyone should have a specific role or everyone should learn how to balance everything. I worked as a hostess for almost 2 years. I understand there are difficulties and issues might come up but this was just terrible.",sKm057Fq1gJMKP4L99U8sg,0,0,1,rLteNtgigAhwBShkcWHP8w

Now you should prepare yourself to wait even if tables seem open...I know it sounds odd but this is a small place with a small kitchen so from what I can tell they seat based on the kitchens bandwidth.

I decided to dine elsewhere to save my sanity and that is one of the better choices I've made so far for the new year. The food is decent nothing that you cannot get at any other sushi bar.

Last but not least Hamachi collar with the cheek meat as well.... Perfectly cooked with a great dipping sauce and grilled lemon.

During both visits we took advantage of their happy hour offerings and were blown away by the taste, generous portion, and inexpensive how bill ended up being. Honestly, it doesn't get any better than this. Below were the items we sampled. 

**Note*** Items listed were from two separate dinning experiences, but some items ordered did overlap
       

HAPPY HOUR MENU (4pm-6pm)
-Cajun Albacore Sashimi ($5): Thin sashimi slices with a mayo based sauce is a great way to start your meal.    

-Ika Geso ($4): Calamari accompanied with a flavorful yellow curry sauce. It was cooked perfectly unlike many restaurants that tend to over-fry theirs. Definitely a worthy order. 

-Salmon Avocado Roll ($4): Chef John was incredibly generous with the amount of salmon he stuffed into these rolls and get this... you get 8 pieces. Seriously? That's like $.50 per piece. And no it's not anything like gas station sushi, this is high quality fatty salmon that just melts in your mouth. Excellent - we actually ordered two servings (on both visits), and we'll definitely order this again and again in the future 

-Hydro Bibb Black Cod ($4): I'd like to think of this as a Japanese Fish Taco with the Bibb Lettuce acting as the tortilla and the grilled black cod as the protein. The fish just melts in your mouth, it's soooo good. Two thumbs up!   

-Tada Salmon ($1): Guacomole, salsa, and salmon over a flat chip. It was good, but I think you'd be better off ordering the Salmon Avocado Roll.  

-Baked Mussels ($5): Also good, but to be honest I can't remember much about it.    


REGULAR MENU 
-Golden Ocean Trout with Pop Rocks($11): It's like a full blown party in your mouth. So if you're fearless this is your ticket to super stardom and the salmon was so fatty and delicious. Love!    

-Flying Fish Roll ($15) - This was a simple tuna and salmon over sushi. The presentation was modern and taste was solid.  

-Uni Duo w/ Santa Barbara and Catalina ($20): To be honest, I am a novice when it comes to uni. I really liked the Santa Barbara, but I couldn't say the same for the Catalina. The Catalina is a bit more gritty, whereas the Santa Barbara was much smoother. Nevertheless, both were very fresh. 

-Kumoto Oyster wiyh uni ($6): Hands down the best dish of the night. The oysters were so incredibly juicy without tasting fishy and combined with the roe and uni - it was magical. I'm at a loss for words. Just order it!  


SUMMARY
Food execution was spot on, service was great, and prices- OMG, I still can't believe the bill. About $50 (not including tip on each visit) for two patrons at a nice Japanese joint with high quality fish. Completely Un-heard-off...  

Soho has now become my favorite place to dine in Sin City and on every trip from this point on, it'll always be on the Vegas itinerary. Thanks Chef John for the wonderful memories and delicious food.",vc4mkEa6Ug5cQudS0EfytQ,18,9,5,koB5BR0_xq1tCMjT6EoE9A

Yes Chef John Chien Lee and the staff are pretty awesome.  I could easily give Soho a 4-5 star rating.  Everytime I've been here I've been impressed more than the last. I'm sure if I was to go tomorrow I would also be impressed. 

When coming here you need to know that their dinner menu is a lot better than their lunch mainly because a lot of the must have items are served during dinner.  If you do come here for lunch they have this Lunch Seto for under $10 and it includes one from eight items which includes Salmon Teriyaki, Loco Moco, and Sashimi and it's served with yummy salad, rice, and miso soup.  It wasn't that bad. Here's my Sashimi Lunch Seto http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=7DpWBN02wkQ1TrtPkHVt0A#7DpWBN02wkQ1TrtPkHVt0A They also have a few sushi rolls, salads, and appetizers served during lunch.  One thing you should do is ask if they can serve any of the dinner items. I've asked twice and both times they were willing to make an item off the dinner menu. Just ask, the worst you'll get is a no and you order something else.

I have many favorites one is probably the bone-in short rib, it is a must. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=j8BK5DiHa-eVduVUKJFmXA#1xEgn9UQF6V3E9rtMvs2-w It is so tender that you can cut it with a chop stick and so delicious that you'll probably want more after eating your entire order. It is a little fatty and just melts in your mouth. I'd order some rice with it but you can eat it on its own or with a sushi roll.

For apps one of my favorites are the Garlic Shishito Peppers http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=j8BK5DiHa-eVduVUKJFmXA#lKya5IUtF4FBqA7I2wr0gQ they are good and I have to have them each time I'm here. They're like candy.  Another of my favorites apps are the edamame http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=j8BK5DiHa-eVduVUKJFmXA#VtxviC2KrM4-pOYMYGdz9A it's the first time I've had it with large salt crystals and really made a different for me.  Another is the Hydro Bibb Black Cod, it is basically a marinated miso cod topped with wonton crisps in a lettuce cup. It's light and delicious.

I only had one of their sushi rolls which was ok but have had majority of their non-sushi roll items, this is clearly where they excel in.  The chef is very creative, if you order ahead he'll make a very nice platter of various sushi and sashimi pieces. 

They have a nice big screen TV and very comfortable chairs. Sitting at the bar is a bit awkward, I kept banging my knees on the underneath parts of the counters. Spacious but does occasionally fill up. This is not All You Can Eat unless you have lots of money.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,8,5,5,3r3gFrQZSfqH07hYdZ5psA

Steak, salmon and sushi samplers were all around us, there was so much food it could only with the uttermost care fit on our table. We also got two rolls, the double dragon and albacore. I felt these were well made because they had a thinner rice covering than is usual but other than that they were the usual sushi roles I have come to expect at regular joints.

We ordered the seabass lettuce buttercups from dinner menu $12, super delish!  My husband ordered the sashimi lunch special for $10.95 and it came with soup, salad & good portion of sashimi.  I ordered the Teriyaki chicken lunch special for $8.95.  The chicken is white meat and the sauce is served on the side which I liked.  The chef owner brought us the seared Garlic Tuna on the house.

While everything we tried was fantastic, my overall favorites were the Cajun Albacore Sashimi, Tadas with Yellowtail, and the Shrimp-Avacado roll. 

The tadas were the most ""fusion"" like thing we tried. A mixture of ""ceviche like"" spice accompanied with tostadas and touch of lime, I ordered two plates to myself!

The cajun albacore sashimi....can I drool any longer? I loved the light cajun seasoning idea. This dish, along the with others at Soho, doesn't take away from the idea that I'm eating sashimi. Some places fuse dishes together to make something completely new altogether, which usually turns into a sad ""miss"" from me. 

We received a recommendation from our server Boris to try the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy off the regular menu. Oh boy oh boy oh boy!!! I've gravitated toward yellowtail and albacore of late, and this recommendation was right on the money. Our servers, Boris and Candice, were extremely attentive and spot on on their recommendations based on questions of what our palettes gravitated to.

We also shared an a Sashimi salad which comes on a pretty large portion of greens and a decent amount of fish. However the Sashimi Bento is just a mini version of the Sashimi salad + the other things that come with the bento so it was kind of a double order. 
We also tried the lettuce cups and the fish was tastey on that as well.

Baked Mussels - So good 

Truffle Broccoli - Fire

Tempura beans - really good!

Escolar Carpaccio - Sooo good!

Yellowtail tadas - Good

Salmon tadas - Fire

Tuna Tadas - so good

Seared Albacore - Amazing

Grilled Octopus - So good!

Rock Shrimp - Love the sauces

Short Ribs - Bomb

Scallops - Amazing


Sushi Rolls:

Volcano (Fried, no cream cheese, no jalepaneo) - Fire

Flying Fish - Bomb

Nutter pillar Roll - bomb

Twin dragons - ok

High roller - ok


Definitely go here! So good!

2412776,2014-05-12,9,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"A standout in the Southwest, Soho truly is a great option in Vegas for sushi & Japanese small plates.

Soho is a clear-cut 5 Star location for Happy Hour!  Just skim the reviews for HH and you'll see tons of rave reviews.  The value is incredible for the quality they are putting out!  This is seen again in their Lunch Specials.  Even void of the HH/Lunch pricing, they are still creating some wonderfully balanced and fairly inspired dishes though.  

I always check out the specials board when entering Soho as some of my favorite dishes have come from there.  Their signature dish is a Yellowtail Sashimi that comes with  a slice of Tempura Jalapeno, some Micro Cilantro, and is finished with Garlic Oil & Yuzu Soy.  It has quickly become a Soho classic and elevates the Yellowtail without distracting from the fish.  In fact their have been multiple moments that my tongue has longed...yearned...I don't know...maybe lusted for a little tempura jalapeno slice.  This can sometimes be awkward when it happens during the day and excessive amounts of salivation is accompanied.  It can be easily avoided with fairly regular visits however.

I am also a fan of their Tostadas...they make for a well composed bite (or two) and come in multiple offerings.  Their are plenty of other tasty options including Hydro Bibb Black Cod, Blue Fin Tuna Specials, and Ocean Trout Specials.  The later two of which also work well simply as Nigiri.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,17,13,4,fAdyTU4EWqD_wjl2pd-UlA

Soho lovingly shares some of the best sashimi and other japanese treats I've enjoyed anywhere in the world.  In a strip mall.  Even our cabbie who's been in Las Vegas for ten years didn't know about it.  

I'm going to tell everyone I know about Soho to and beyond the point of being obnoxious, it's that good.  I don't like Las Vegas, but I'm going to make sure my whole family comes here just to go to Soho.  It's that good.

The service was fantastic - thanks Sheila!  You can tell the whole team is having a good time with this project.  It's that good. 

The signature hamachi with a light ponzu sauce is a must-have.  As is the garlic softshell crab.  As was the crispy spicy tuna roll.  And don't forget to ask if they have Wagyu when you go.  It's not on the menu, but they did have it and it was heavenly.  I could go on and show what piggly gourmands my business friend Tom and I were, but something should be left to imagingation.  I doubt there is anything less than wonderful on the menu.  It's that good.


There are plenty of excellent dining establishments on the strip, with much fancier decor.  But they don't deliver the quality and the heart and soul like Soho.

1. Their happy hour menu is amazing -- you get all the best things are discounted prices which mean you can order twice as much for the same price!!! Yes!

2. Cajun albacore -- I don't usually eat raw fish but when I do it's only here and it's only Cajun albacore. This comes with this amazing sauce, jalapeños, and is out of this world. Oh and you can order it at happy hour so...score!!!

3. Cucumber sake -- this is the most smooth sake I have ever had and we drank 2 bottles the first time and 2 again ever subsequent time...so try it!!! 

4. Their waitstaff -- they work as a team so you're never waiting or wanting for anything! Someone will be there to refill your water or add to your order without saying ""oh let me get your server"" I like when people work together. 

5. Sheila's recommendations -- if you aren't sure what to order, ask a server!!! Sheila is my favorite but as I mentioned above, they work together so no one will steer you wrong!!!

2606632,2015-06-05,8,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Vegas has so many world renowned chefs with outposts on the Strip that surprisingly, the best sushi in the city might be found off it. Pretty hard for me to believe myself. 

As my friends were spending their money on $35 drinks at a pool/day club on a Saturday afternoon after paying $40 for their ticket to see Alesso, I opted to find a good place to eat by myself. I polled friends on Facebook and got great recommendations like Raku, Sweets Raku, Piero's, L'Atelier by Robuchon, Taste of Siam (I had already been there before), but some of them weren't open for lunch.  I found Soho Restaurant on Yelp, then found that it was also listed as #3 in Yelp blog's top 100 places in the US for 2015.  

I took a seat at the sushi bar. A server and one of the sushi chefs asked what I liked eating. I started with a couple of sashimi plates, added a roll, then finished with live sweet shrimp.

This nerd was really enjoying watching them at work then I spotted that they had uni. The chef asked if I liked sea urchin and explained that they always tried to carry two varieties. I'm savoring my sashimi and a couple of minutes later, the chef places a small plate before me. ""Since you like uni, here's some uni with snapper for you to try!"" 

As I was finishing up my sashimi plates and about to start on my roll, the chef places another small plate in front of me.

Chef: Do you like beef? Do you eat meat?

Me: Yes, of course, I love beef!

Chef: Ok, good! This is just a little bit of our Wagyu.

I didn't realize what I was eating until I bit in. WAGYU A5! Who gives away Wagyu A5? It was so tender, so fat, so juicy with just a magic dust sprinkle of sea salt. He had just finished prepping some beef dishes and there was an ounce or two left over so I benefited. 

Eventually I finished my roll. I was about full, but was able to squeeze in live sweet shrimp for my last dish, a perfect way to finish it off. 

Yellowtail Yuzu Soy (w/ Tempura Serrano, Micro Cilantro, Garlic Oil, Ponzu, Garlic Dust) - You can't go wrong with any of their sashimi dishes here, but the Yellowtail Yuzu made my mouth feel like a kid at Disneyland. Happy, alive, and full of wonderment. Fresh fish with a citrusy, yuzu ponzu, topped with a deep fried serrano pepper slice. Very tender, crisp, and clean. The tempura serrano made this next level. This was my favorite of the dishes I tried. 

Golden Ocean Trout (w/ Freeze Dried Miso, Chives, Lemon Ponzu, Pop Rocks) - Barely a half-step behind the Yellowtail Yuzu is the Ocean Trout. A bright orange trout (almost looks like salmon), it was an evenly marbled cut that made it slightly buttery. The lemon ponzu and sweet crackling pop rocks was a contrast that complimented everything well. Based on personal preference, you might like this better than the yellowtail. Both are phenomenal.

Santa Barbara Uni with Snapper - My sample plate of this was the same as the regular sashimi dish. The snapper is subtle with allows the fresh, rich uni to shine.

Twin Dragon Dragon Roll (Alaskan King Crab, Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Tempura Shrimp) -  Yes, real Alaskan King Crab. Avocado chunks. All of this good stuff, topped with roe and drizzled with sauce. Loved it.  

Wagyu A5 - Best way to describe this dish is to say... Wagyu A5. If you don't know what that means, well, that means baby soft well marbled beef that just melts in your mouth. The way they cooked it was perfect... A simple preparation, medium rare with just a touch of sea salt, allowing nothing to distract me from a gorgeous piece of meat. 

Live Sweet Shrimp (Amaebi) - For my shrimp they used a large, live shrimp, so I'm not sure that it's true amaebi. Smaller amebi that I've had in the past have been sweeter. The single shrimp was prepped three ways for me. They removed the head shell, then cut the head from the body, and then plated the body and while the head was split, half deep fried while the other half was cooked in a miso soup. There is something very pure and primitive about eating something raw minutes after it was alive. Yes, we are a sick peoples, but it's so good. 

Have you ever been to a restaurant for the first time and they give you uni and Wagyu on the house? I'm still in awe. Thanks to John, the sushi chef who helped point me in the right direction and created phenomenal dishes. He was the one that noticed that I was really enjoying my food and gave me more just for the heck of it. I didn't know he was the owner! If you see a guy behind the sushi bar cutting jokes with his staff while making sure the fish aren't alive, that's John. 

Only $48 (before tax and tip) for all of this? If I didn't order the last shrimp, it would have only been $38. This same meal would easily cost you double on the Strip. And they have Happy Hour deals too. Only ten minutes/five miles from the Strip, Soho Restaurant is worth the small detour to have some of the best sushi in the city!",NOs3g2KLfNvuc9dDWy3syg,14,12,5,plkTw8ktEzNOyCjyaFSxfA

Owned by Chef John Lee with his wife who also runs the dining area of the restaurant, the place seems to have something note-worthy going on. The quality of the ingredients they use are phenomenal, not to mention the exceptional freshness and grade of their fish. Like many, I value service that's genuine and efficient as well as a price tag that doesn't break the bank. This place has it all.

ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA ($9) started off our meal with 3 dipping sauces that accompanied it: wasabi aioli, sweet banana sesame, and garlic ponzu. If there was one dip we fought over who gets to lick the last bit of it, that'll be the sweet banana sesame. 

SNAPPER w/ UNI ($13) initiated our cold sashimi orders. The presentation was so beautiful that all we wanted to do was stare at it. The inevitable was bound to happen and gladly we savored each bite appreciating how the uni did not overpower the snapper. Delicious!

SALMON WASABI CREME ($11) was highly recommended by our server and we took heed since we are big salmon fans. Clean flavors with a climax on the wasabi creme that sang melodiously altogether, this was easily my favorite out of all the sashimi dishes.

YELLOWTAIL YUZU SOY ($12) was served with ""compliments of the chef"" says our dear server. It was after all one of his most popular dishes and I completely understand why. The tempura serrano, cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust all worked harmoniously for the benefit of the fish. 

BIG EYE TUNA POKI ($15) which was a special of the evening had a lusciously melt-in-your-mouth texture that only proves how fresh the tuna is. A much bigger portion compared to the sashimi dishes was a plus.

MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18) was cooked to perfection and was probably the best thing I ate here. So much for sharing but I'm getting an entree all to myself next time. Buttery yet flaky, black cod to me is the version of a grade-A Wagyu steak in fish.

TUNA TADA ($2) would be poki tuna on a tostada shell topped with avocado and cilantro. The contrasting textures of the crunchy shell to the tenderness of the fish and creaminess of the avocado was superb. For $2 each, can I have one more please? 

SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ($9) seemed to be popular but this did not wow me in presentation, however, looks can be deceiving and I'll say it was very good. My daughter will vouch for it, too but I'm sure the spicy version of this is much better.

FIRE CRACKER ROLL ($9) was my least favorite as it had cream cheese in it. Not their fault, just my preference. This had spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried. Everyone else enjoyed it.   

TWIN DRAGON ROLL ($15) won me over despite how stuffed I already was at this point. All the dishes we shared between 4 people but we all can't deny this roll was truly something with Alaskan King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and tempura shrimp. Without a doubt this was the best out of the three rolls we had.

MATCHA TIRAMISU ($7) ended our meal with a sweet note. Green tea soaked sponge cake and matcha sabayon topped with whipped cream were all there was to it but let your imagination run wild as to how heavenly scrumptious this really was.

The place was already filled with people but they seated us right away. No waiting :-). The hostess was quick with bringing us water and the waiter came to ask what we wanted. I told my sister about their awesome lunch special so we didn't take long deciding what we wanted. I ordered the lunch sashimi and she ordered the lunch sushi. Its a nice spacious restaurant and can fit a good deal of people. There's no fancy decoration but it was simple and all about the fish. Next time we might sit by the bar to meet the owner! 

Sushi special: You definitely get your moneys worth!!! Cucumber, salad, miso, and fish for $8.50?! The quality of fish was really good, though I didn't care for the tuna. Miso soup was better than expected, full of flavor and.... TOFU! Most places skimp out on this and it's quite disappointing. The salad dressing was decent and the cucumber I ate in between to cleanse my palette. Out of all the fishes that they plated for the special I didn't care for tuna it the rest just melted in my mouth. Weird to say about fish. 

I ordered a beef appetizer the one with pineapple (forgot it's name) since I remembered I enjoyed it a great deal during my first dining experience here. 10 minutes later our waiter Charles told us there wasn't enough to make a plate and I was extremely disappointed. He definitely made it up to us and made my experience a happier one :-)

Yellow tail... O my. It's just as I remembered the first time refreshingly tangy! Of course delicious! This is an absolute must when coming here, the fried jalapeño gives its an amazing crunchy texture.

Considering how busy it was with two waiters the service was excellent. Charles was great and sweet! As we were leaving he opened the door for us :-) we definitely felt pampered during this visit.

2662668,2014-06-21,1,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I was so excited to try Soho but like all things approached with high expectations, there is room for let downs.  First let me say that I enjoyed everything - from the comfy chairs to the friendly service to the quality of food.  It's great all around.  The kitchen is even willing to cater to your specific needs, even if it is off menu.  I love this kind of accommodation.  As for the food, there were some hits and misses.  Sorry I forgot to take a photo of my chicken katsu lunch seto box and shrimp tempura, but these were the items I was quite disappointed with.  The breading on the tempura wasn't great, as well as the chicken katsu.  It was dry and the coating didn't stick very well.  The miso soup had great flavor but was extremely salty (and I have a salty palette).  

The exceptional items were the green tea tiramisu (although I wish it was served more chilled) and the sushi which had good quality fish and great ratio of fish to the rice.  The Cajun albacore sashimi was also of good quality, but the sauce I didn't enjoy very much.  I think it would appeal to folks who love fusion ingredients and sauces in their sushi.  I prefer more traditional flavors.  If you love fusion sushi, you will adore this place.  And if you are more of a sushi conservative, I'm pretty sure you can still get what you want if you ask them to make it.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,2,1,4,v1yIn8juKBTgs3Tou1jbmg
2668558,2015-10-08,3,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I'm being honest here, don't hurt me, okay?  The food here has been consistently good the couple of times I've dined here with my wife but in terms of value for the money, it's not there.   When I leave similar Japanese restaurants and paying similar prices, other places have me going, ""Wow.  That was really good... AND I got my money's worth.""   Not really the case here.  

In addition, there has not been any 'stand out' dish for me.  The sake (salmon) and the hamachi were pretty good but they won't make you go ""DAMN!"" like Yonaka's sake orenji or Sakana's hamachi sashimi might make you involuntarily do.  Their oyster selection is pretty limited and more pricey than Other Mama's superior selection in both taste and price.  

The free-range boneless grilled sliced chicken we had for dinner this time around was nowhere near as good as the short rib we've had in the past.  The chicken and the dipping sauce was fine and came with just a side of broccoli drizzled in ponzu sauce.  Strikingly a plain dish for such a well-rated restaurant.

I will give it to them that their service was quick and the food came almost as soon as we ordered.  With similar establishments doing what they do and better though, I think Soho needs to revisit their menu and step it up or else fall behind to some rising establishments.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,12,3,3,YBXh67mYLedvKUcY1TCtpQ

We were constantly on the hunt for a good happy hour that had good food, good drinks, and strong prices. One day, we stumbled upon this place. We actually ended up visiting three times during the three weeks we were in town! 
The first time was just for happy hour. The food and drinks were great! Favorites were the carpaccio and the bronze broccoli. 
The second time we went for someone's birthday. They recognized us from the first time and the birthday boy got a free dessert! The service was just as good as the first time, if not better!
The third time however took the cake. There for another birthday, we were immediately welcomed with appetizers when we sat down. After we had ordered, they brought out a complimentary bottle of sake. The waiter explained the flavor and we cheersed for the birthday boy. When our food came out, the house actually gave us two plates of their specialty - yellowtail with ponzu and other garnishes. Amazing! The birthday boy also got a free dessert. 
Yes the goodies were nice, but it really was the true prices, incredible hospitality, and quality of the food that made this place so special. 
If you go here expecting special treatment and freebies, don't. We had really connected with the team since we ended up having repeat visits multiple times within a week and a half. If you go here expecting good food, good prices, and great service, then you won't be disappointed.",uXcGuBDBRu7f-nXz890cZw,3,0,5,5zR70tQsYD4i0NfsGZ9ajA

Although it wasn't on the menu, I ordered an eel roll.  If you don't see something on the menu, just ask, they may have it!  The eel was so awesome!  Usually when I order eel, it is tough and has tiny little bones.  Well, this eel practically melted in my mouth, no joke!  I summoned the owner over and he asked how everything was and I asked him how his eel was so good, while others were not.  Apparently they only use a certain part of the eel if I remember correctly.

We decided to start things off with a couple of appetizers. I highly recommend the Ahi tuna tostada ($1 during happy hour). The fish tasted very fresh and overall the crunchiness of it topped it off. All of the rolls and sashimi were all fresh and presented in a beautiful fashion. I highly recommend the yellow tail!

My friend had the rolls and the salad. I like the salad tastes very fresh probably enlightened from the vinegar. I am not big fan of sushi or sashimi. But my friend liked them a lot as well.

The green tea cream Brulé and  green tea tiramisu were interesting. I probably would not order tiramisu again because it tasted just like a sponge cake.

The chef owner is the former executive chef at Social House and has brought his fusion-style of cooking to the 'burbs. That means Strip-quality food at off-Strip prices.

The strip mall location is nothing special and the interior is quaint and understated. But, it's the food that shines at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with the yellowtail yuzu soy ($10), tuna or hamachi tostadas ($2 ea.), or the angus gyoza ($5). The miso marinated black cod ($18) is as good as any I've had on or around the Strip (including the one at Nobu).

The variety of rolls may be limited, but the quality and execution is solid. This is not an all you can eat place, so expect to spend a little more for a higher end product.

The subtle sweetness and silky creaminess of the vanilla creme brulee ($5) was a great way to end the meal. If chocolate is your thing, try the chocolate mousse ($7). It's the perfect balance of sweet and bitter chocolate with cocoa crumbles and cookie pieces to add variety in texture.

The chef/owner stopped by to chat, which is always a nice touch to show that he cares about the diner's experience. With beautifully presented and well crafted food, Soho is a welcome addition to the local scene. For people on a budget, like myself, it's just another reason to dine in the 'burbs instead of the Strip.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,25,20,5,TzemIivHlbgNdsxsMUn1rw

Sushi that we chose were the Spicy soft shell crab and the Twin Dragon, both delicious.

Happy Hour is from Mon-Sat 4pm-6pm. The HH menu is pretty damn impressive. Prices range from $1-$5. Regular menu prices aren't too bad either. Today I only experienced the HH menu and I couldn't get enough of it.

Infused Cold Sake ($4)- you can choose from Lycee or White Peach Flavored. I went with the Lycee. It was sweet and comes with about 4 shots. When the workers would see your shot glass empty they would fill it for you, which I thought was pretty cool.

Tostadas ($1)- you can choose from Salmon, Tako, Tuna, and Hamachi. These are probably my favorite thing on the menu. I had to order more than one. I couldn't choose which one was my favorite. They're all my favorite! 

Spicy Tuna Roll ($4)- Only item that didn't really stand out. Very plain.

Fire cracker roll ($5)- has spicy tuna with jalapeños, cream cheese, sweet onion & is deep fried! MUST HAVE! It's literally heaven in your mouth. 

Salmon Avocado Roll ($4)- the amount of fish and avocado overpowers the rice which is appreciates. I love when the rice/fish ratio favors the fish! 

Cajun Albacore Sashimi ($5)- the beau's favorite! Had to order more than one. The aioli sauce that it's swimming in is so delicious and the fish is so fresh.

Jalapeño Poppers ($3)- BOMB! 

The owner of the restaurant was kind enough to come say hello to us and see how we liked the food. He even gave us complementary Yellowtail Sashimi which is one of their specialities. Our server, Sheila, was the greatest. Very helpful with the menu and extremely nice. She told us that they just opened 6 months ago and have been extremely busy due to the Yelp community.

Roughly 10 minutes later, when there were at least 5 tables open and only a few with guests we were told ""sorry, we have reservations at 6:00, but you can come back in 2 hours at 7:00"".  The hostess and Manager poorly dealt with this situation and easily could have sat our party.  They were rude and due to their level of service we will not return.  We left and went to Oyshi sushi, we were promptly sat and funny thing is we were out of there before 6:00.  If I was the owner of this establishment, I would take a deep look into how operations are run and re-evaluate management.  This is a service city, and in the 13 years of living here this was the worst service I have ever seen.  Their current staff is going to run what could be a good local spot into the ground.

Tried the fresh uni, Hydro Bibb black cod, salmon wasabi cream and green tea tiramisu. Everything was good if not stellar. On one occasion, I ordered an octopus salad, one of their specials of the evening. The server claimed that the octopus was from Spain and that they were testing the dish to see if it should be a mainstay. They were asking for their customer's opinions. The octopus was tender and the vinaigrette was sweet and spicy. In other words, I hope that octopus salad becomes a regular dish.

They also serve affordable lunch specials even during the weekends. At under $9, the sashimi box set is a steal. The restaurant is Strip quality but strip mall affordable.

2880252,2014-10-31,5,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"This review for my personal favorite Las Vegas restaurant is long overdue. 

Chef John and staff are doing everything right - fresh fish, amazing sauces that are so thoughtfully executed, all at moderate prices with attentive service. You can find us here at all times of the day. Their lunch menu is affordable and my husband loves their take on hamburger steak + gravy. I love coming in during Happy Hour (4-6pm) and getting a sample of everything. The usual suspects being the tostadas (hamachi being my favorite), shrimp tempura roll, cajun albacore sashimi and the miso cod lettuce wraps. If we're here during dinner, we're getting the short ribs with a side of rice, although the potatoes that come with it are really tasty too. The lobster tempura and  the rock shrimp tempura are not oily and come with really tasty dipping sauces. If you ever want extra of any sauce, don't be shy, the staff is happy to oblige.  

I've never really been too big on raw fish, but Chef John does it right. We've sampled a lot of the other sashimi and fresh fish offerings here, and have yet to be disappointed. Flavors are always complex and we love that Chef John sends us new dishes to try. Even our friends from out of town ventured out to eat here and were really impressed. This place is getting more and more popular, so I would recommend making reservations. 

We also recently dined at Sen of Japan and were very disappointed with the food and experience (should have listened to Antonia R.'s review!). During that meal, all I could think of was how much better the food is at Soho, and how much better value you are getting for your money.

As far as my liking, I am more comfortable and relaxed in a less stuffy atmosphere.  So I mean that utmost positively.  The quality of the meal here itself deserves a 3 piece suit.  

The sashimi is 'to a T' exactly what the other reviewers have wrote about.  Sans repetition, I will agree that the fish is top tier at Soho.  

Cajun Albacore had a mini taste of spice accompanied by a smooth cream and in the middle of it all was the tender melty meat.  Yes.  4/5

The Black Cod luttuce wraps' flavor and texture were delicate, umami & fap worthy. 5/5

[As a test of their standard fare, we ordered a traditional sushi joint roll.]  

The Temura Shrimp Roll came as a surprisingly delectable entree.  I can tell that all the rice I've ever had at all the AYCE sushi restaurants before were done wrong.  No sog and definitely not a bland choice.  Go ahead order one & see for yourself. 4/5

An Uni Tasting Platter of 3 different regions (30$) with 4 pieces of each was the knock out of this lunch!  Santa Barbara was the usual beige toned uni that you may be familiar with.  A bit more sea floor with this one.  Mmm.  The next was the more orange kind (I think it was from Catalina?) This was sweeter & creamier. Mmm.  Last was the real deal from Hokkaido Japan!  It was a darker reddish tone almost blood hue.  They were smaller and slighly undertone flavored.  I think there was some subtle nuances to it that I am not experienced enough to pick up on.  Mmm.  All three of us favored a different region uni.  Heh, different strokes. 500/5

Lastly I'll mention the Tadas.  Ahi & avacado or 3 other assorted chunks atop a light crispy rice flat. Serious twist and seriously good with a silly cheap price.  5/5

They told us we have to check out the actual SOHO Sushi restaurant where they make all the sauces. My wife and I had to visit and we were blown away. Chef Aaron took care of us and was just an awesome cool white guy which is unusual for a sushi chef. Great personality and he recommend some sushi that we that had never tried before. I am not surprised very often but flavors and quality of fish were off the charts and different from anywhere we had eaten before. The next time we visited we got a chance to meet Chef John the founder of SOHO. Just a great guy that has really extended his passion and personality to his whole staff and company. Chef Tate also amazing showed us the freshest 40 pounds of tuna just flown in from Japan. We sampled it and so amazing.

Easy to access, right off the 215, Soho has never disappointed. If you're a tuna crispy rice (crispy tuna roll here) and yellowtail with ponzu regular at Nobu, Soho's is more than comparable. Also love their rock shrimp tempura and shishitos. 

The stand out here in my opinion is their cold dishes, the first listed on the menu. For Sen regulars, I think this is what puts Soho a step above, as well as the slightly smaller, more digestible menu with all the necessities. I sample several cold dishes (all sashimi style fish) every time I come, either by myself or as share plates with others. The chefs love to experiment and usually always hit the nail, so don't be cautious, I swear they won't disappoint. The yellowtail yuzu and seared garlic tuna are classics, but I'm a stickler for the golden ocean trout and cajun albacore. Last time I had a great dish with truffle too!

Other than that, no complaints about my dining experience here.

Happy hour here is legit! Rolls are 6-8 pieces and they offer sashimi and carpaccio for only $5. 

Baked mussels: mussels were on the bigger side and I thought they were average. At least they weren't over cooked and super chewy. 

Cajun albacore sashimi: one of my favorite dishes but it seems like they add daikon? on everything and the sauce was a bit too much. Nonetheless, still a good amount and I usually don't like albacore but I enjoyed this dish.

Kalbi ribs: would not order again. It was one rib cut into 4-5 pieces and was a little on the burnt side. Flavor was still good though, but I'd rather buy it at Greenland market and grill it myself.

Ika geso: 3 pieces of grilled squid which my friends enjoyed but I didn't have any. 

Spicy tuna roll: average roll but it was super spicy! My friends can usually handle spicy but they even commented on how it's on the spicier side. 

Crispy Brussels sprouts: would not order again. The Brussels sprout was practically falling apart so we got more leaves than the actual Brussels sprout. I wasn't a fan of the sauce because it was a bit on the sour side and I felt that the sprouts weren't crispy as we had hoped.

Mixed tempura : crispy tempura pieces which came with 2 shrimp tempera and 3 other veggie pieces. The sweet potato piece that I had was still undercooked so it was on the hard side. I probably wouldn't order it again.

Salmon carpaccio: another one of my favorites. 5 pieces of salmon with some toppings and arugula on top. Again, they overdid it with the sauce but luckily the sauce wasn't too overpowering or salty. 

Seafood dynamite roll (with no cream cheese): I think it's a deep fried roll with a ton of daikon and arugula on top. I wasn't a huge fan because I could hardly taste any fish.  Probably will not order again.

Salmon avocado roll: average roll. I think their rolls  are a little smaller than usual rolls but it's because they don't pack on a ton of rice. Salmon to rice ratio was perfect and they didn't skimp on the avocado! 

My friend also tried their uni, 2 big pieces ($10), he said it was one of the best he's had.

The hostess was friendly and fast. She quickly acknowledge everyone who came in. Our server, Gabriel was on it. He was quick to service us, on top of it, and even brought me treats for my birthday.

you know how shishito peppers are like a game of russian roulette? most of them are blanks, but approximately one out of every five is like someone snuck a ghost chili pepper in there to screw with you? these were all like ghost chili peppers. i nearly died.

4 glasses of water later, the golden ocean trout (pop rocks! love them!), kumamoto oyster with uni and salmon roe, and angus tataki were the highlights of the night. the tuna and salmon tadas were really tasty as well. 

the miso black cod was a huge disappointment. it was overly sweet and not at all flaky like at nobu. it was actually rubbery and kind of chewy. even my non-foodie bf was like, aw hell no this is wack. 

the rock shrimp tempura was ok, nothing special. i've definitely had better.

finally, the cajun albacore roll was my least favorite dish of the night. the combination of flavors was confusing and just not good.

overall cost was $114 for two including a couple drinks but not including tip. i think the sashimi platter here is probably a good deal since the fish is quite fresh, but unfortunately we didn't order that. there are definitely better places that cost less though (sugarfish! robata jinya! oh wait those are in another state). i guess if you're in vegas it doesn't hurt to try this place out.",HODxLhIMSvB2b7TzQ230UA,3,2,4,tSPbHol9dq1TTDB-81xZ8w

Plus the bathroom in the women's room-- well it's bigger and has safety bars, but accessible it ain't. I had to leave mom's wheelchair outside of the stall in order to her situated. I don't think the restaurant says they are wheelchair accessible-- yelp does, so no knock on Soho for that.

I really enjoyed my meal so I would come back-- just not with my mom unfortunately. The sushi pieces were huge, but not obscenely so (you know those places) and well priced. We went for the Uni Duo and wow, that was worth it. Other than sushi we got a beef tostada that was really delicious and had great texture (although a little heat would have been nice!), and my husband really enjoyed his yakitori.

Chef John literally delivers a strip-like Social House experience for a fraction of the price in a neighborhood setting.  A well-known friend chef of mine not to be named told me they took almost the entire menu and brought it to Soho - he frowned a little upon this but I have no issues with it.  The locals benefit from it and they put out one of the best happy hours in town.

The dollar tostastas are so addicting.   I feel like a child ordering 6 and 12 pack taco's from Taco Bell but this is obv much more refined, elevated cuisine.  My favorite is the salmon tostata but they are all good.  We got one of each as they offer 4 selections.   The rest of the happy hour has a cajun albacore sashimi, black cod lettuce wraps (YUM), and several roll selections.   The rice on the rolls were a little under seasoned but overall everything was good.  The waiter recommended the bacon wrapped kurobata sausages.  They reminded me of little smokey's.   I wasn't a fan at first but it was greatt paired with the pickled cucumber.  The rest of the HH items are all priced between $3-5 per item.  

As for dinner, I came on another trip and i was really impressed with their beef tataki.  It's 100 times better than Tonkatsu Kiyoshi's version and a level or too better than Kyara's.   I love their ocean trout topped with rock salt - love the textures and freshness of the dish.   We also ordered the beef short ribs, a Yelp favorite, live uni, oysters, and on my most recent trip i sampled their king crab topped with a little butter and hint of garlic.

Everything here is great!  For dinner you won't find your yum yum roll here - This is more about the fish.  Chef John says that he gets his fish from the same supplier as most of the sushi spots on the strip so you literally are paying a fraction of what you would at Social House!",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,14,10,5,s6Li1o9CqBRbqJW1ljDKxg
3098021,2014-03-12,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Soho was suggested to me by a coworker who loves sushi and I had drove by it a few times so I was curious to find out how good it would be. 

The food was amazing and the fish was of best quality and fresh. I would give the food 5 stars. I was expecting it be because the owner is Chef John Chien Lee, former executive chef of Social House at Aria. The service wasn't the best at least for me with the wait staff and I expand on why later on. 

First the food. We ordered baked mussels, seaweed salad, the spicy tuna roll, the salmon and avocado roll, and the salmon wasabi creme (the dish I was excited to try the most). The appetizers tasted the same as they would any other Japanese restaurant nothing special. I love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and paired with avocado in a roll. The spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the fish, but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it. In the roll, the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big chunk, which was very appreciated. Mid meal, the Chef and Owner, John Chien Lee, came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming. He saw that I had a thing for salmon and asked if I would mind to try something similar, but not salmon, compliments of the chef and I said sure! He brought us out the house special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious! I never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and I enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had top it off! 

The service would get a rating of 3 stars. It wasn't till the chef talked to us that the waiters had a bit more urgency to serve us, which was just two people. It wasn't too busy when we walked in, but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the waiter also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment. I think that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us, they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the house, which we did not receive. Though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout! 

The ambiance of the place was okay. It was like top 40 with house music playing, similar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness. Decoration was okay, could have been more, but will do. I did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up! 

All in all if your looking for fresh fish at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well known sushi spot on the strip, without the pricey cost, this is definitely a spot to try! Happy hour runs Mon-Sat. the days they are open from 4p-6pm.

The first impression when we walked in- friendly staffs, nice & clean open kitchen, cozy atmosphere.  

We knew we were in for a good experience when we could tell that the place was filled with locals.  There were families, large groups and couples and all looked like they were having a wonderful time.

Now let's get to the main point of focus:  THE FOOD!  WOW!  Simply THE BEST!!!

Everything was FRESH and DELICIOUS.  You could taste the freshness and the quality of the ingredients with every bite.

On top of it, all the prices were very reasonable, especially for this area.  Hello~ we are in Veags, baby!  If you are willing to pay more $$$ on the strip, by all mean!  This is not a fancy restaurant with 3 servers standing next to you.  This place is cozy, family owned, with Michelin starred restaurant quality.   I sincerely think the quality I'm getting vs. what I paid for, it's totally under-priced.       
 
I found a local magazine quoted this newly opened restaurant ""Nearly Perfect""!!!  wow~    

This place is a hidden gem in the neighborhood.   I want to keep this as special secret, yet I also want to shout from the rooftops.
  
I even came eat here twice in a row within 3 days.  That's rare for me to do!    I hope that next time when I visit, it won't be a long line...

Not being a huge fan of raw fish I was hesitant to come here because I know this is where the restaurant shines. But I came with an open mind and ordered a dish from every section of the menu.

I tried the yellowtail sashimi; shrimp tostada; hydro bibb black cod; rock shrimp tempura; cucumber salad; albacore; fire cracker roll; soft shell crab roll. The standouts for me were the yellowtail sashimi, shrimp tostada, shrimp tempura, and the fire cracker roll. A lot of the time I am not a fan of sushi because of all the soft elements but both the shrimp tempura roll and the fire cracker roll had a variety of textures. The shrimp tempura was lightly fried with the right amount of breading. Might have been the best shrimp tempura I have ever had. The yellowtail sashimi was also very good with the jalapeño tempura on top giving it the crunchy element I look for in dishes with raw fish. The two dishes I was not a big fan of were the hydro bib black cod and the cucumber salad. The black cod tasted fine but it was missing something and the piece given was extremely tiny so the lettuce took over. Cucumber salad had no flavor so I added a little extra soy sauce. Nothing I put in my mouth was bad but a few dishes needed a little refinement. 

Best Japanese I have had in Las Vegas and prices are ridiculously affordable for the quality of fish and ingredients being used.

The quality of their fish is simply the best you can get, and this is Vegas baby. The service is always outstanding and make sure you treat them well because they deserve it. Don't bother reading haters reviews, they are just unhappy people that are jealous and trolls.

    The Calamari, Salmon Roll, Albacore Sashimi, Black Cob Lettuce Wraps and Tadas  were the highlights from the Happy Hour menu.  The Maki, stuffed mushrooms and stuffed Jalapenos were not very good and we never ordered them again.   We have ordered several of the sushi rolls on numerous occasions and really have enjoyed them.  I do like that they use fresh fish and quality ingredients in their sushi.
   We had their Miso Black Cod, numerous sushi rolls and the Angus Bone is Rib for a dinner party.  The Miso Black Cod was truly the highlight of the night.  Everyone loved it along with the sushi.

3188786,2014-01-14,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"My initial experience at Soho when it first opened was not very pleasant. The food was good but the service was a total mess. 

I decided to come back and give it another shot last Saturday night.

The restaurant was busy but we were able to get a table right away. I noticed that the servers were more attentive and accurate this time around. The server took our beverage order immediately and followed up in a couple of minutes for the food order. 

We ordered the following dishes:

Hamachi Yuzu Soy (5/5) - I liked how he used a Serrano pepper rather than jalapeño. Also, the Serrano pepper was deep fried. Something different. The fish was very fresh. 

Mixed Tempura (3/5) - I have mixed feelings about this dish. The batter was not what I was expecting. It was not crispy and light. For me, one of the gauges for a good Japanese restaurant is the tempura since it's one of the least complicated dishes to make. One good thing they did with it was to add some salt after frying it. 

Toban Soup (3/5) - Basically it's a soup made out of dashi and mushrooms. Nothing special just the presentation. It was served to us in a tea pot with tiny tea cups. This soup needs a little revamp. 

Sunny Roll - seared salmon, spicy crab, lemon and tempura asparagus (4/5) the roll was good, fresh ingredients but for me it tasted ordinary. Nothing that made my palette jump for excitement. 

Hamachi Poke (4/5) - this was a new dish that the owner is trying out. It had onions in it but surprisingly, for you onion haters like me, you can hardly taste the onion. The fish was fresh and the flavor was good. 

Chocolate Mousse Cake (6/5) - this was the highlight dish of the night. So far, Soho is consistent with its desserts... Always the perfect ending to a meal. 

Let's go back to the service. I want to emphasize that the owner did a great job improving the service of the restaurant. I must say all the servers were very helpful and sober (compared to my last visit).  I had my drink refilled several times and the owner stopped by our table 3x to check on the food. 

I will definitely be back. Hopefully the owner has a new addition to his menu that will make my palette jump for joy that I can give this restaurant a 5-star rating.",tGnRCFvDip0lerDKtRSa6A,1,0,4,tnUrpkpYSsFqtt0WXVXnvw

I've had the sashimi lunch special as well as the chicken katsu lunch special.  the sashimi lunch special portion is very good for the $10 price tag.  you get a couple pieces of salmon, tuna, and Hamachi.  pretty good value.  not to mention rice, miso soup, and a salad.  the katsu lunch also has salad, rice, and miso soup.  the portion for me was a bit small.  wish they gave a little more katsu.  but the flavor and crunch of the katsu was unbelievable.  i've honestly never had katsu this good before.  i don't know what it was, but every bite i took, I kept asking myself if this was the best katsu i've ever had.  and I'm thoroughly convinced it is.  

for happy hour, i can't say enough about the ahi tostadas.  i could eat 10 of these.  the hydro bibb miso black cod is so flavorful, delicate, and delicious.  one of my favorite menu items.  hamachi sashimi is wonderful as well.  the sauces and oils the chef adds totally enhances the Hamachi and the flavors dance in your mouth.  everything is so complimentary and the fish is always the star.  rock shrimp tempura was very good as well.  sweet and juicy shrimp in a pillowy tempura batter was quite delicious.  firecracker roll has a lot of fish in and on top of it.  the sauce was spicy without being over powering.

Food: excellent. We had the tostadas of yellowtail, tuna and salmon. Sashimis of Cajun Albacore, yellowtail yuzu, salmon mascarpone and salmon avocado creme. The mascarpone pairing was interesting and unexpectedly delightful. Standout was definitely the Cajun albacore: bomb.

Their service definitely deserves the five stars. They apparently have an excellent happy hour, for which I came about 30 minutes before it was ending. Our hostess said our table would be done in 20 minutes, which it didn't so she said that if it goes past the 6PM mark, she'd let the server know to still give us some time to order some happy hour dishes. 

Most of the food was pretty good. I had a whole variety of things. The stuff on their HH is pretty standard, nothing too special, like spicy tuna roll, salmon avocado roll, and this cajun seared ahi. Nothing too 5 star worthy, but still well made and pretty standard. Also ordered the mixed sashimi platter. Some of those cuts were pretty darn good. The scallop was sweet and fresh. Their salmon was nice and fatty. Their fish roe has a seaweed bite which made it taste great. I'm not a fan of some of the other cuts, like red snapper, but they were still enjoyable. Also had their warm octopus salad or something..that's not something I'd recommend to anybody. I like octopus but not only was it good, the flavors didn't match with anything else on that menu that we had ordered. It was very off.

I didn't get to try their Omakase, but what we ordered was pretty good, so I think I will come back and try that one day.

yes, the portions are decent.  yes, the prices are dirt cheap.  but come on, there's more to rating a good sushi spot than just price.  the QUALITY of the food was average at best!  

i ordered the sashimi lunch combo, the yellowtail with yuzu sauce and a few pieces of hotate nigiri.  the miso soup was super bland(served us miso soup with a spoon), the sashimi was not very good quality.  you could tell it had been frozen for awhile because there wasn't the usual firm texture to fresh fish.  the hotate came out really brown and was super mushy.  definitely not fresh.  

soho japanese restaurant really caters to a more americanized pallet offering rolls with a ton of sauces and deep fried blah blah in it.  wasn't my thing.  for REAL authentic sushi, please drive a little further away from the strip and spend a little bit more at sen of japan or kabuto.  it is worth your time and money.

Took my boyfriend here for Valentine's Day.  We had a fantastic dinner.  Every item we ordered was delicious, and fresh, fresh, fresh!  The food, atmosphere, presentation, and staff are all 5 stars.  One of the waitresses came over to talk to us while we were waiting to be seated and recommended several items on the menu.  The main chef came out after our meal was over to ask how we liked our food.  They even gave us souvenir sushi-style keychain charms on the way out, which was cute and a sweet gesture.  Will definitely be going back, we were very impressed all around.  The yellowtail sashimi was probably my favorite.  (Be aware this isn't an AYCE sushi restaurant, just order what you like, sit back and take your time to enjoy).",_JrGKMNojtUHKFhvjGtyDQ,1,1,5,HLk9BSWMYuNejYsvSQkC0A

My only complaint was the wait.  Otherwise this place was perfect.  It's located pretty far off the beaten path but you walk in and you get a great jJpanese meal.  Every dish is great, the waitstaff is helpful, and the prices are surprisingly good considering the quality.  

We had the brussel sprouts, vegetable roll, tuna roll, egg roll, and mis soup.  We coupled that with the house saki.  The brussel sprouts were outstanding - one of the best dishes in Vegas.  The tuna roll was awesome as well.  The saki was great, too, especially for  $7 for a full serving (hot or cold).  The vegetable roll, miso soup, and egg roll were solid, but I will try something else next time.  

Come during Happy Hour (ends at 7) if you have the chance.  The dishes we ordered were mostly the classics and they go for $5 at Happy Hour rather than $8-9 off the real menu.  Our total bill was around $55 which is unbelievable in Vegas.  Soho is top notch.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,rJwnZHFBtryJnk4a26Guag

1. The food is really expensive. They don't have AYCE, so you'll easily be spending $30 on two rolls.
2. I wasn't expecting to see real crab in the California roll. I think that's great, but it was really dry and didn't have the texture I'm used to.
3. My soda tasted flat or watery.
4. There's only one soy sauce option, and be careful because it's salty AF.

I left rather unsatisfied and disappointed because I couldn't even finish my food.

**Update**
I have recently visited this location again because my friend raved about their happy hour menu. I really like their happy hour menu because select items are $5. 

We ordered the sliders, firecracker rolls, calamari and a few other rolls. 

I loved everything I ate and paid only $30 for like 6 items. The happy hour is the way to go! I go here more often now.",-PXJEs_9T0lRKpssxf3otg,0,0,4,7lq_85JGsfLOWAXmJ3qwxA

I had my friend order, as she had been to Soho many times, and claims this spot as one of her all time favorite spots.. and I dont blame her!

Their Ocean Trout, out of this world.  who makes sashimi with pop rock candy... chef john does!  Yes, it sounds a bit absurd... but pure genius!  It was literally poppin and rockin in my mouth! 

Four words... Hydro Bibb Black Cod.  Amazing!  Its marinated in a miso glaze, so it gives the fish a sweet finish!  They're serve in little cute butter lettuce cups. A definite new favorite!

Yellow tail sashimi was PERFECT! Its served with little tempura jalapeno , and set on the sashimi.  Each bite, pure heaven!

All of their sashimi is the freshest I've ever had in Vegas! Coming from Hawaii, I'm a bit picky when it comes to where I eat my sashimi, because I'm used to freshly caught fish in Hawaii. At Soho, its clear that their motto is QUALITY!

What draws me to this place, other than the fact that their food is AMAZING, is the customer service.  We were personally approached by the Chef/Owner himself.  He reiterated our order, and by that he was able to get a feel of what our taste buds were like.  He said that as a courtesy, he was going to bring out a complimentary sashimi dish, on the house.  It was a black sea bass w/ truffle and olive oil. OMG. it was soooooo delicious! First of all, he didn't have to do that... that was truly nice of him to do!

The omakase ended with a matcha cheesecake and macaroons as desserts. I also go here a lot for happy hour, which is from 5-7 PM. Get there early as this place is always busy. $3 sapporo draft, $3 house sake, and a variety of food items for $5. Such good deals!

3362030,2014-03-21,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I'm visiting from LA, where we may have a good sushi place or two.  But I found this restaurant on Yelp, and off I went, thinking I'd look more toward meat items, as I'd eaten at another sushi restaurant the night before.  When I pulled up to the restaurant, admittedly I was a bit worried, because the signage made me think cookie cutter strip mall Japanese restaurant.  (Usually, when I think Japanese restaurant in a strip mall, I feel more comfortable if it looks like a dive.)  But generic outside appearance aside, this restaurant holds its own with some of the top restaurants of its kind in LA, and brought to mind restaurants like Wa and the original Katsu-ya.  I began with a house specialty, yellowtail sashimi with just enough tempura jalapeno in a garlic and yuzu-based sauce, before moving on to beef tataki, seared to a beautiful texture with a garlic chili oil.  Both were delicious and perfectly tender.  From there, the chef came out--it was wonderful to get such personal attention (and the restaurant was quite busy)--and we discussed what I might want next.  He suggested I try a white sea bass he had just gotten in, and then a trio of taro tostadas, each a combination of a different fish, spice (as in heat) and avocado cream.  They were fabulous small bites.  I finished my meal with the signature miso marinated black cod, perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful, accompanied with a yuzu-based vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly.

My primary server was quite attentive and personable (as were all the others), the setting is unpretentious and comfortable, and I didn't know until the end that Chef had graciously given me the white sea bass and tostada tastings.  That was just the cherry on top of an exceptional meal.  It won't be the cheapest Japanese meal you've ever had (though the prices are very fair for what you get, and there are good deals to be had at happy hour and lunch), and if you're a quantity over quality person, there are probably better choices, but if you appreciate top quality, extremely fresh ingredients handled deftly by a talented chef, this is your restaurant.  Even if it were in LA, Soho would still be a standout.  Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be at the top of my list.",BYsmhaj1NGPuhvtInL6Kbw,3,1,5,QLuXFCOEyLYDeJzIZ8gq2Q

If I remember correctly it's Monday to Saturday from 5 to 7 for their happy hour menu. It was basically about 5 bucks a plate. Some varied but the stuff we ordered was in that range. 

Didn't take a photo of all our food. Since it's happy hour the portion is a tad smaller so we ordered about 5 plates to share. 

Mix tempura: red bell pepper, two shrimp tempura, onion, and I think a zucchini. This was good. I didn't notice an overly extended amount of batter. 

Baked muscles: these were good! They had Yuzu sauce or some ponzu sauce in it that made the flavors balance out and it didn't feel as heavy because of the sauce. 

Crispy brussel sprout: yummmm!! The mixture of textures, nice n crispy, they had some nuts in it for a bite. And the sauce in the middle, not even sure what it was but it was BOMB. 

Spider roll and spicy salmon roll. I like how they put these little crunchy balls on top of the rolls. I'm not sure how to describe the taste but added crunch. As always fish is fresh! 

Can't forget that Infused sake! Lychee is my favorite one. Mmmmm. Their lunch specials are pretty good too. Love the variety.",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,1,1,5,GO7dFb97krl8yog110NJ3w

We initially requested for some dishes suggested by a friend, and was told they would make it even though it's no longer on the menu. So, don't hesitate to ask because they'll make it for you! And lastly something I learned from my husband today is to ask for fresh wasabi. They do charge $1 for it, but it does make a difference in taste.

I also tried the amaebi, or sweet raw shrimp (not on the HH menu). They told me that I could get *live* shrimp--so I went for it! It was the freshest tasting shrimp I've ever had.

I like the ambiance here--it's a true neighborhood joint. A lot of people came to the sushi counter to talk to the sushi chefs, and the waiters seemed familiar with regulars.

The important thing is that their food is just one of the best sushis I've ever had. They really have a punchy flavor and it never fails to satisfy. I do admit sometimes I am disappointed that they don't have more types of sushi rolls on the menu, but they make that up for how amazing their sushi tastes. At the same time, I like how simple their menu is because it is not overwhelming like other places. It makes ordering go by quicker. Service is good as well. Sometimes I like sitting at the sushi bar because I get my food wayyyyy faster.

The mochi here is also really great as well. When you order mochi, it comes in 3 and you can choose from mango, strawberry, green tea, and black sesame.

The interior of the place is really upgraded! I noticed that they changed their chairs to these fancy brown executive looking chairs (much comfier too). The ambiance of the place is very calming and romantic. They have fake candles on each table and some dim colored lights along the walls. I also like that they frosted the bottom windows so that if a car pulls up in front of the place with their lights on, it doesn't shine bright through the place. That way the customer doesn't get bright lights shined in their face while their eating. They pay attention to a lot of detail here.

After having dinner here during my trip in Vegas, I wanted to eat here again the next day. Sadly, my friends decided to eat at other places. 

We ordered so many food while we were there. We just simply wanted to try everything because everything we ordered was very delicious. They are known for their sashimi so order from their specialty selection if you are there. You will not be disappointed. When I had the ocean trout (can't remember if that's the name or something else since we ordered so many dishes), my mouth was in heaven. The fish is topped with poprocks. Yes, POPROCKS!!! It definitely added a nice touch to the fish (and childhood memories of eating poprocks). 

The waitress that served us was very attentive. She recognized from our voices that we had tried to call in earlier to make reservations. All her recommendations were delicious and she provided great customer service. We ordered hot sake but were given cold sake instead. She returned and gave us a bottle of hot sake and told us the cold sake will be complimentary.

I also like that they are open to modifying our philadelphia roll with hamachi instead of salmon. Overall, I have experienced wonderful customer service and the best sushi quality here at Soho Japanese Restaurant. If the owner of Soho Japanese Restaurant is reading this review, can you please open a location in San Francisco, CA? I'm dying for your sushi. T_T

I found Soho House using yelp and google and I am so happy we decided to give them a try. The attention to detail, freshness of the fish, and amazing customer service, made this our best dining experience ever.  I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world, on nearly every continent, but have never had the combination of amazing food and service like I did at Soho house. Imagine my surprise when I found out that Nobu and Soho house have the same seafood purveyor! I'm really kicking myself for spending $$$$ at Nobu last year when we could have gone to Soho House instead.  Well, you don't know what you don't know.  Now, on to what I do know.

Sushi Chef Tai is brilliant!  Every dish we tried was so perfectly balanced. The only word I can think of to describe the flavors is: BRIGHT.  No one ingredient overpowered the next, but they all complemented each other so well.  I also appreciate his attention to texture.  I realized immediately after taking my first bite that the boring, overly soft rolls back at home are not going to cut it anymore.

The food alone is a good enough reason to visit Soho House but the level of service we received nearly left me in tears.  Gabriel went out of his way to make sure my husband had an amazing birthday dinner.  It was because of him that we decided to return two days later for a second meal. We had the pleasure of being helped by Sheila, who is the head server.  She is so sweet, warm and smart. She really upped the ante with her superior customer service and left an indelible impression on our hearts.

All the sashimi MELTS in your mouth. Maybe it's not authentic with my sashimi topped in pop rocks and swimming in ponzu sauce. I DON'T CARE.

...and will I ever be able to regain my sanity?

I am told that a great work of art is never truly finished, that the work never ends. After just one visit to Soho Japanese Restaurant, I now understand what that means.

Clearly the great Yelpers of Las Vegas have collectively cried out the praises of this understated little gem in the southwest valley. Not only does it rank top among sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it ranks tops among ALL restaurants in Las Vegas. That little tidbit has to be making some of this town's ""legendary"" chefs red in the face. Someone should tell those people at Michelin they are dinosaurs - no wait, never-mind, let them figure it out.

You see when it comes down to it, it's quite simple - if you do something great, people will notice. And it's clear, Soho does great better than anyone in Vegas.

The first thing you notice when you walk into Soho is that no world renowned restaurant decor consultancy group was brought in to ""class the place up"", like they do in most 5 star restaurants. Soho is a simple, friendly, comfortable and welcoming environment - a 5 star restaurant that won't make you feel like you're not good enough to be there (what a concept.)

The staff are regular people, just like you and me. But management is obviously treating these people with a little respect because it's quite clear they all love working there - it shows in absolutely everything they do. Imagine great service at a 5 star restaurant from friendly people who don't look down their nose at you (are you guys starting to see a trend here?)

But you really don't appreciate how good you have it until the food arrives. It's easy to get so comfortable here that you can forget you are about to partake in one amazing meal. All that changes once you take the first bite. For us it was the Uni Trio - just Wow! (Thank you sir, may I please have another.)

I know what you're thinking, what does a boy who grew up in Fargo, North Dakota know about sushi? Wouldn't he be dead last on the list of people you should trust on the subject? (Hey Buddy, you forgot to cook this!) 

Fair enough.

The truth is, you're just going to have to decide for yourself. No amount of banter from me is going to change your mind,so I'll leave that up to the marvelous people at Soho, they are better suited to the task.

Chef John Chien Lee has set up shop on the Southwest side of town and is fast becoming a favorite spot among the Yelp Community and you can see by the rave reviews!

Our few visits have been during happy hour, and this is one of the best HH spots around town IMHO. On our first visit, we tried the Soho Maki, Tostadas(All 4 kinds), Beef Tataki, Albacore Sashimi, Firecracker Roll, Ika Geso,  Cod Lettuce Wraps, and all were delicious with the exception of the Soho Maki which is essentially annorexic spring rolls in a glass. That item as well as the Firecracker Roll was forgettable.

Our Second visit, we arrived just before HH which allowed us to try one of their lunch specials. If I had to suggest one, The Soho Moco where Chef Chien pays homage to the Hawaiian Loco Moco is pretty bangin'!  A nicely seasoned burger patty with rice, a perfectly fried egg, and Chien's version of a gravy comes with a side salad and miso soup...All that for $8.95? Stupid, right!?!? Oh, the components are presented seperately in a nice bento box style, but to totaly enjoy the Moco, dump out the rice and make little bed, on goes the burger, on the burger goes the egg, then smother the whole thing with the gravy. Cut in to that bad boy letting the yolk ooze all over, and KILL IT!...;9  We also redeemed ourselves during dessert as we finally got our hands on their popular Green Tea Tiramisu (They ran out during our first visit) That was a great ending to our meal.

The service here is some of the best as well. Servers are very personable, and are quick to offer recommendations of popular items as well as their personal favorites Chef Chien himself even stops by to each table to see how everyone's doing and even lets you know of upcoming events and menu additions which I thought were pretty cool. Soho is closed on Sundays so that Chef Chien and his employees have quality time with family...Awesome boss points right there! If you haven't already, come by and have yourself some Soho action!

Food Quality: The salmon was flavorless.  The spicy tuna roll was good, but unbalanced.  The soft shell crab tempura roll had no crab taste.  Overall, I was somewhat disappointed given the reviews.

Value: Exactly as expected.",w-abC5X7aep6FBRydZAa4g,2,1,3,LtxbfU_LnuiwW_pnlzjhIQ
3617566,2014-07-19,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,I have one word to describe Soho and that word is phenomenal! I have been to many different sushi restaurants in town and Soho by far has the freshest cleanest tasting fish. We were going through the menu and saw Ocean Trout with Pop Rocks. I know we thought the same thing but we're feeling a little daring and it was so worth it. Ocean trout looks like salmon but tastes 10x better and danced with the tingly sweetness of the pop rock candy. The Garlic Shishto peppers were out of this world. We were lucky enough to be checked on by the chef who was amazing! He recommended we try a dish that was Jack Stripe fish with Uni and it was outstanding!!!! My wife is not the biggest fan of Uni but once she tasted Soho's Catalina Island Uni she was sold. We finished off the meal with the Green Tea Tiramuso refreshingly delicious!  We have already made plans to return. We definitely recommend you come and try Soho. You will love it just like we do!,HRQ1N9XtHVwS2Fjqjq1HbA,0,0,5,ot1Z3ri-0OHBve7Wo4ebTw

It came out, and I was pleased with the thick cuts of sashimi and tempura sushi. I was quite full when the hamachi kama (I forgot we ordered) came out. HOLY COW! Literally, it was a cow. Thick piece of yellowtail collar, basically the size of a T-bone steak. I was so impressed because I've only ever seen small size of collar.

Being the outspoken and outgoing person that I am, I'm already glad that our server had a great sense of humor and definitely played along with my outspokenness. He was so accommodating and was more than happy to let us order off of the happy hour menu even a little after it was over. 

Now, the small trick to knowing if their service is ""on point"" is if they refill your water when it is empty without having to call for me to refill it. They most certainly refilled my water every time I took a sip out of glass of water, and refilled my glass every time I took my shot of lychee sake. Not only that, the Chef even came out to introduce himself, and offer a couple of complementary chef plates. It was DIVINE! I love their service here, and I can definitely see why they merit 5 stars.

Here are my faves:
HYDRO BIB BLACK COD - served in a leaf of lettuce (like a lettuce wrap). That nice butter texture with a slight smoke to it. So good I could even do without the lettuce.

STUFFED MUSHROOM - as any stuffed mushroom is. DIVINE! 

**FISH TOSTADAS - truly one of a kind and really the reason to come eat here. You'd want to buy 2 of each tostada during Happy Hour FOR SURE. It's fresh, and their tostada tastes like sweet panko crackers. Yum!

**UNI FROM THREE SEAS (thank you chef!) - AMAZING. Thank God this Uni was what I experienced my first Uni moment with. It comes from three seas. Santa Barbara, Catalina, and (if I am correct) Hokkaido, Japan. You start from SB and work your way towards Hokkaido (yes a journey right in front of your eyes). For a first time UNI-eater, I truly love the sweet taste to it.

After 1 soho maki, 8 fish tostadas, 1 fire cracker roll, 1 stuffed mushroom, 2 hyrdos, a sake and a creme brulee, my tab came out to around $50 for 2 people during happy hour. I'm pleased.

We made reservations for dinner which I would highly recommend. When we walked in four top was waiting for us and we were seated immediately. The staff recognized it was a birthday dinner and welcomed our first time visit.

Our server was Boris who is over the top with his service and demeanor. He walked us through the menu, made some great suggestions, he was attentive. A keeper.

2 - Shrimp Lollipops
1 - Baked Mussels
1 - Salmon Roll
1- Fire Cracker Roll
1 - Cajun Albacore sashimi
2 - Escolar Carpaccio

1 - Snapper with Uni and Roe (Not on the menu but you can ask for it)

All under $200 for 4 of us.

We came here wanting to try something different than the normal AYCE places. 

The cold dishes were really the spotlight of the menu. We tried the Yellowtail Yuzu and Ume Scallop.  I fell in LOVE with sashimi scallop in Austin and have been on a hunt in Vegas ever since. This is the first restaurant I've found that had scallop and it was a table pounder!!! So fresh and delicious. I love the texture of scallop because it isn't like the normal fish that kind of melts in your mouth. It has this harder chewiness to it (best I can describe is Filipino pineapple jelly but a little softer)  For those who have never tried scallop, this is a must!  We wanted to try the entire cold menu but will come back for that. We also had some of the tostadas (shrimp and whitefish) which were also really good.  For dessert you cannot go wrong with the matcha tiramisu. The matcha flavor was good and it was super creamy just how I like it.

Best part of the night was having the chef come out to the table.  Chef John was very personable and you could feel the passion he had for his restaurant by the way he spoke of it. He also offered us a cold dish on the house of some special trout (can't remember the name) but it was similar to salmon and sooo good! 

We missed the specials because it was at the front of the restaurant and we couldn't see the sign. I mentioned it to him that the waiters didn't let us know and he said that he didn't want his patrons to feel like they were upselling us. I thought that was quite admirable but gave him a recommendation to move the specials where more people could see it because we probably would have ordered off of it. He said that he would take that into account and welcomed all recommendations. 

Not only was the food good but the chef really makes the place. It's only been opened for three months but seems to be doing well. I would definitely recommend this place. Not only for the food but the chef as well. He's the type of person that you hope has much success!!!",1IQ_d1RuMj8iIpcF2CDohA,2,1,5,VHNaetyJ1X-3XGm3GClxsg

The fishes were all exceptional quality! The FLAVORS..??? To die for!!! And for the price, it was surprisingly reasonable considering the food was the same, if not better, quality than Andrea's at Encore hotel. The owner and the servers were really nice and friendly. The servers were very knowledgable as well when it comes to the components of the dishes. The owner was thoughtful enough to come to our table and ask us what we particularly liked in our food and recommended certain things to us that I absolutely loved!!! 
I definitely recommend ordering the yellowtail hamachi, seared beef hamachi, the ocean trout special, Japanese snapper with uni ponzu, fresh uni, shishito peppers, tuna poke tostada and miso black cod..

I especially like the firecracker roll. It has spicy tuna, cream cheese, and jalapeno lightly deep fried in tempura. I normally don't desire deep-fried rolls, but the tempura casing is more crunchy than breaded. 

Chef Lee is absolutely friendly and makes time to meet his diners. I've been on more than one occasion and he makes it a point to remember his diners. I really enjoy this personal touch.

I have been searching for some new great spots on the southwest side of town and sadly, there aren't many. So naturally, when I read that former Executive chef of Social House (John Chien Lee) opened his own restaurant, I was thrilled!! 

I have always loved Social House but think their prices are outrageous for the portion sizes you get. The Sashimi Sampler at S.H. was my favorite but the fish was cut so thin and skimpy and was $28!  BUUUUUTTTT not at Soho! The Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer was only $10 and the yellowtail was cut THICK and was out-of-this-world delicious!!  DO NOT miss! I repeat: DO NOT MISS!! (I wanted to order 10!!!) We also ordered a simpl spicy tuna roll off the Happy Hour Menu and 6 Poke ""Tostadas"". All very very delicious and very inexpensive!!!!

The rolls were A-MAZING! We tried the Dragon Twin, Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll, the Sunny Salmon Roll and goodness.....the quality of the fish is SO FRESH! I have to admit, its been a long time since i've had such fresh fish in Las Vegas. Oyishi is usually my local hang, and though I love it... I feel as of late, the quality of fish has really gone downhill at points and its totally bummed me out! (That's why I've been on the search for a new spot!) 

One nice touch is that they also offer a hot brown rice Japanese tea and its complimentary, which is a nice alternative to the traditional green tea and its really really yummy!

To top off the whole experience, Chef Lee came out and asked us how our dinner was! He was so kind and actually mentioned that he takes the freshness of his seafood very seriously! To which I replied... ""It's the first thing I noticed!"" followed by... ""I'm your biggest fan and telling everyone I know!!""

Without a doubt this is going to be my new spot. I want to eat here every night of the week! Ohhhhh, I'm drooling just thinking about it.....",N_8Ad4o7pgBbHDG7AC11wA,2,2,5,hrqJt-LTNpigVegXO3B8Vg

Soho was amazing. Hands down!
We got there at 5:50 and put our names down... About a 15 minute wait. When they were ready to seat us, they apologized for the wait (unnecessary, but appreciated) and they offered to extend happy hour just for our first order (again, unnecessary because happy hour had ended at 6, but very much appreciated). 
We ordered several items from the happy hour and regular menu. My favorites were the Cajun Albacore, Firecracker roll, and the Sunny Salmon Roll. 
You HAVE TO TRY THE SUNNY SALMON ROLL. I can't even put words together to describe the delightful surprise of flavors that you taste, so you're just gonna have to take my word for it and try it yourself. 
We also had the cold peach saki which was delicious!
At the end of our dinner, the head chef came over to us, introduced himself, thanked us for our business, and later brought over a complementary sashimi dish of yellowtail, which was fantastic.

My guy and I came by on a Saturday for Happy Hour -- offered Monday through Saturday from 3pm to 7pm. We arrived around 4:50pm and didn't have to wait. By the time 5:30pm rolled around, though, there were several groups of guests waiting for a table. Apparently, making a reservation is the way to go around here. 

Right away, we knew we'd have a great meal. We arrived famished and fell in love with the dozens of options on the Happy Hour menu. Rolls, carpaccios, appetizers, and drinks are all up for grabs. All of the food items are $5 each -- and great sizes! -- and most of the drinks are $5 or $6. 

A few things to keep in mind -- this is a place to go to if you genuinely like raw fish. A lot of the menu features raw items and creative garnishes, so this might not be the place to try something completely out of your element. Also, expect the sashimi slices in the carpaccios to be small and thin. Fresh, but skinny. 

Lastly -- I have to say Soho has the best sauces ever. Seriously. You won't find basic ponzu, eel sauce, and spicy mayo junk at Soho. Instead, you'll enjoy the likes of Yuzu mascarpone creme, creamy ponzu, avocado creme, and truffle oil. 

Here's what we ordered...

TROPICAL SAKE, PASSION FRUIT MANGO
- $6 for a small-sized carafe. 
- Sweet and fruity, just how I love it. No strong sake taste. 
- Cold, alcoholic drink.  
- Guava flavor is also available.

GINGER HAMACHI
- Yellowtail with slices of jalapeno and fried pork rinds. 
- Never had crispy pork rinds on raw fish, but I loved it. I've been missing out. 
- Not on the happy hour menu. 
- One of my favorites of the evening!

SALMON CARPACCIO
- Features Yuzu mascarpone creme, shallots, and diced tomatoes. 
- The flavor just works, and I was so weary of cheese and salmon. 
- Fresh, light taste. 
- So good, we got it twice. 
- Another favorite of the evening. 

ANGUS BEEF TATAKI
- Seared steak with shallots, chives, garlic, olive oil, and ponzu. 
- Tastes a lot like seared tuna tataki. Similar texture, too. 
- Compared to everything else, this was the least memorable. Everything else we ordered was just so much better. 

CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI
- Comes on a bed of daikon radish, soaked in sauce. 
- Creamy ponzu sauce is unlike anything I've ever had. So rich and flavorful. 

SALMON AVOCADO CREME
- Dressed up with avocado creme, pico de gallo, cilantro, and ponzu. 
- The avocado is subtle, but offers an excellent sweetness to each bite. 
- Cute take on ceviche. 

SALMON AVOCADO ROLL
- 8 good-sized pieces. 
- Basic item, but yummy and filling because of the rice. 
- Can't go wrong with a classic!

SPICY TUNA DIP
- Basically, a spicy tuna tartare with taro chips instead of wonton chips. 
- The spicy tuna is a legitimate tartare mix, not the average spicy tuna that goes in a roll. SO GOOD. 

INFUSED COLD SAKE, WHITE PEACH
- $5 for a small-sized carafe.
- Stronger sake taste, but still a nice fruity flavor. 
- Cold, alcoholic drink. 
- Lychee flavor is also available. 

BAKED MUSSELS
- 6 large pieces. 
- Yuzu dynamite sauce with ponzu, scallions, and tobiko. 
- Great, easy option to share. 

Overall, an excellent meal. My guy and I agree that this was the best Happy Hour experience we can remember. 

Bonus -- ample parking, as the restaurant is situated in a plaza. Also, the employees are great and helpful. There's a dozen people working in the open kitchen, busy creating masterpieces and shouting ""Soho!"" at incoming patrons.

Shiela gave us free sake and free dish. She did this because it was my birthday and they didn't have a couple small items. Probably because everyone loves this place and doesn't have enough for everyone that comes. Very popular joint. I can't say anything bad about this place.

Jones & Warm Springs for one of the best hh deals around town Mon -Sat, 4-6pm. Soho emerges from the former Ambrosia Cafe occupancy.  While Soho is a perfectly good name, in my mind it just didn't fit for a Japanese restaurant, possibly why I kept forgetting about this place despite some of my fellow yelpers' high praise.  The name just seemed like some new, trendy little spot until I made the connection that Chef John Chien Lee is the former chef from Social House.  Therefore, depending on historical events, I'm guessing that the name 'Soho' can only mean 1 of 2 possible things, me love you long time or suck it b*tches.

We tried the many of their happy hour dishes with great success.  My favorite dish is the black cod lettuce wraps.  Other high points included the variety of sushi empanadas for $1 each,  cajun albacore sashimi, firecracker roll, and stuffed mushroom.  The only low point of the evening was the dry and overcooked ika geso, aka the fried calamari that came with a curry aioli dipping sauce.  During hh they offer $1.50 - 3 beers.  I enjoyed the Asahi @ $3 while he happily sipped the $1.50 Coors Light.

The atmosphere is nice but small, .  It looks exactly the same as it did when Ambrosia occupied the space; same layout and color schema.  Service is excellent!

Halfway through our meal owner/chef Lee came out to great us and treated us to a complimentary yellowtail special, which was absolutely delicious!

Originally I had been wanting to visit this place after seeing so many rave reviews on Yelp from my fellow Yelpers.  I came here for lunch and I base my reviews on service, quality, presentation, and lastly taste.

Service - We had seen two servers helping everyone throughout the restaurant and they were really on top of there game.  Food came out immediately despite how busy it was.  Refills happened without me having to ask.  I happened to spill the wasabi from my meal on my tie and the server noticed right away and brought water and napkins for me.  That's the real deal right there.  Kudos for the service!

Quality - Fusion food is a rather new concept that is slowly becoming an emerging market.  They didn't go cheap on any part of the meals we were served.  All freshest ingredients and healthy food!

Presentation - I couldn't believe how much food I was staring at for the incredible fairly priced items.  My braised short rib looked amazing and I was a little nervous about the wasabi, but shockingly it was AMAZING!  The presentation looked like something mom used to present for dinner when I was a kid.

Food - I think by now you get the jest of my overall review.  The braised short rib was cooked tender and to perfection.  It literally melted in my mouth and it was GOOD!  That wasabi sauce was not spicy at all and I definitely have now bookmarked this place to try more items.

3928307,2014-01-15,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Although I don't EVER write reviews, I felt compelled to write a review from my experience here. Our group of 5 share in this bliss with me.

After a failed attempt to go to Bachi Burger (closed for maintenance the 1 day we wanted to go) we decided to Yelp another location. Randomly jumped back on Yelp as I started driving; light turned green, car started moving, executive decision whip a majorly illegal U-turn. Nonetheless we got there.

First thing we (at least the males of the group) noticed were the $4 drafts of Asahi Dry. Done and done.

Expecting this to be a normal sushi joint, we just order a few things to gauge the sushi quality. Our 2 friends decide to ask if they would do omakase, and the waiter said he'd ask the chef/owner if this was okay. Let me tell you, those 2 made the best decision of the trip.

Having heard that we wanted omakase, the chef/owner John decided to pay our table a visit (he visited almost every table while we were there dining). Asked what kind of dished the guys would like, but mainly we just left it up to him.

2 of our group shared the tostados and were amazed how good they were, so I decided to order all 6 that were on the menu. These little things were packed with so much flavor in various forms. No two were the same and they were just great.

For the rest of us that didn't get the omakase, here's how we ended up
Tostados 
Hamachi
Tako
Albacore
Philly Roll
Angus Beef Tataki


I love my philly roll for some reason, and right when I ate the first piece, I was confused. The fish quality and texture alone were completely different than anything I have ever had. Maybe I'm still a n00b to great sushi, but I have definitely not had that texture from DC, Cali, NYC, Boston or anywhere else I've ever eaten sushi.

The rest of the sashimi was just as good and at that point we knew we were in for a treat.

Tuna poke that was special reminded me of Hawaii. The flavors were nice and acidic with that mellow undertone of sesame oil.

Tuna, sliced beef, fish, oysters, uni, EVERYTHING we had was good. For some odd reason there is a beef short rib on the menu, and even that was good. The guys got that as part of their omakase and it is normally a $30 item at any ""fine dining"" place. They had about 6 or 7 courses in their tasting.. the grand total $40 for their omakase. Simply amazing.

By the end of the night we were wanting to throw money at the owner. Literally. They forgot to include the omakase in our bill at first, but we felt so compelled to pay them and told them to correct our bill. Sub $250 bill with beers, 2 omakases, a ton of other dishes for 5 people. Can't be beat.

Chef John even prepared a few special things not on menu for us to all try. Simply amazing. Seriously, if we didn't have a flight to catch, we were all in agreement we would've just stayed there and said, here's $100, do what you can. Having had tastings from some of the best chefs in the US, this one would surely be right up there with all of them.

Don't like the food, just fly back into Vegas, and I'll go again with you to taste it again. Chef John Lee, kudos to you sir. After 3 months and the reviews of this place are already pegging your restaurant as one to look out for.",uHYzFz7omb5vLxmKd09vGA,4,2,5,GNs-oKRQzVPWGq9Qsz9JmQ

I ordered three items: the angus gyoza which was delicious - the dipping sauce went perfectly with the dumplings. The Sunny Salmon Roll was also great - the lemon really adds a great twist of flavor to the roll. The tuna box sushi, however, I found bland.

Just had dinner there tonight for the first time after wanting to try a new place and reading the yelp reviews. I am so happy I went and tried this place. When I first walked in, we were greeted by the friendly staff. We sat at the bar and the gentleman asked us for our drink order. Being a big fan of beers my attention was quickly drawn to the cooler. I noticed they had some unique craft beers that I've never seen before (which is a surprise in a sushi restaurant anyways), but i was sold on a Japanese beer that I've never before (great beer by the way, forgot the name but has a white label, almost looks like a sake bottle) and a craft of lychee sake, which had to been some of the best I've had!  The the gentleman went on to explain some of the popular items on the menu, such as the sashimi, rolls, short rib,etc. 

  After we ordered a couple of recommendations we met the owner John as well as some of his other chefs. Do yourself a HUGE favor when you go, put the menu away when you look at it and let John and his crew hook you up!!! I can't describe how epic the dishes where they were creating for us. And don't worry, prices here are VERY reasonable!!! We ate a ton, majority off the menu with lots of booze and our bill was about $100. The short rib is an absolute must and hands down the best on the planet. They braise it for 8 hours and glaze it in a homemade veal  stock. The fish is so fresh, no cloudiness or weird texture. Just really amazing and everything is made in the restaurants from sauces to deserts. 

I can go on and on about Soho but you have to go. I went based on a yelp review and I'm so glad I did. Hopefully you'll have an opportunity to experience this culinary marvel as well!!!

I came here on the on set of happy hour and we ordered a variety of items including, the Cajun Albacore Sashimi, Salmon Roll, Black Cod Butter Lettuce Wraps, Spicy Tuna Roll, Fried Calamari, and Kurobuta Sausages wrapped in Bacon. All items were between $3 and $5 during happy house, not to mention the $4 ice cold draft of Sapporo. 

Both rolls, where great. The spicy tuna had a nice kick and tasted good, and the salmon roll's salmon was very good, rich in flavor and with a good amount of fat. The avocado pieces were perfectly ripe and creamy. The Albacore Sashimi was very good and the Cajun rub brought on some unique flavors. The Albacore was mild in flavor and the garnish of thinly sliced jalapenos went a long way. I liked the sauce underneath, but I wish they would serve it on the side, because it was a little heavy handed. 

The fried calamari was lightly breaded, thick, and tender. It also looked very appetizing with light honey color, but its sweet flavor was king and soft tenderness just right. The Kurobuta Sausages were bliss and were the perfect appetizer to eat with the cold Sapporo. The sausages were crispy, exploding with juice once bitten, and packed with a great meaty flavor. The crisp and chewy bacon just added to the goodness via its flavor and texture.

The Black Cod lettuce cups were pretty good. I expected a little more flavor from the cod, but it was good. The fish was light and flaky, but the cups needed some kind of sauce drizzled on top to moisten them up. 

Service was great and provided by a great young lady named Candice. We were lucky to have her with a enamoring personality and friendliness. No doubt, this was a great start to my Vegas visit.",WG3w_73scm_JUWJ_3Lgn0Q,9,10,4,QhYjicTcOywkc8-0xZfJ2w

Chefs, thank you so much for making my trip to vegas worth it! 

I've never liked sashimi before but my taste has changed after eating here. Had the white fish ponzu, salmon wasabi creme,  yellowtail yuzu, and the yellowtail soho tadas. Everything tastes sooooo fresh and the sauces were well-paired. Items were beautifully presented. Tadas are $2 each and the sashimi specialties I had were $11/$12. Worth every penny. 

Hot sake was served in a roundish bottle so the heat stayed in longer than the tall long ones usually served at other restaurants. 

My friends had the sushi lunch special with some spicy tuna rolls. They were happy with their choice as well. 

Desserts: also delicious we're matcha tiramisu and GREEN TEA CREME BRÛLÉE!!!!

Exceptional service and great food that will blow your mind, located on Southwest of Vegas. We came here on a Wednesday night after seeing some great reviews on Yelp and this restaurant had exceeded my expectation. 

Things we tried:

Golden ocean trout- Ordered based on server's recommendation off of appetizer and this was my most favorite dish out of everything I tried. It was ocean trout cut up sashimi style with ponzu and pop rocks drizzed on top. Yes, pop rocks. It added to an interesting sensation that kept me wanting a bite after another. Refreshing and interesting appetizer that I would highly recommend for everyone to try. 

Toro/otoro- It was off of their menu board by the entrance. You can order this in either nigiri or sashimi style. We ordered this in nigiri style and it came with gold flakes on top. Thick cut of toro/otoro with just enough rice. Simply delightful dish and easily one of my favorite. 

Tuna lover roll- One of their specialty rolls that comes with crispy kanikama, avocado, passion fruit soy and roasted spicy aioli. It was on the spicier side with their spicy aioli sauce that tasted like sriracha. It wasn't mind blowing but still was good and filling. Based on other reviews/photos on Yelp, seems like the firecracker roll is a popular choice for specialty roll. 

Crispy brussel sprouts- I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts in general but this was fried very crispy and cut up in small pieces which makes for a great appetizer to share in groups. Just a ""ok"" for me. 

Hydro bibb sea bass- miso-marinated sea bass served in lettuce cup. I'm usually not a fan of lettuce cup just because it's usually messy to eat but this was different. I ate it like it was a taco...haha. Sea bass is marinated and cooked well. One of my favorite dish.

I brought my parents and a friend visiting from New York here for dinner a few nights ago and we were not impressed. Had the restaurant not received raving reviews, I wouldn't have had such high expectations, but we were unfortunately disappointed from the moment we stepped inside. Here's why:

-Hostess did not greet us when we walked in- she said ""one minute"" which turned to five minutes before she asked how many were in our party.
-She said the wait was going to be about 15 minutes but it ended up being closer to 25.
-Food was less than stellar. The rice on the rolls were cold. Some of the rolls were EXTREMELY salty. And aren't all of the rolls typically supposed to come out and be served together? These came out one by one so we couldn't feast like we wanted to.

There were a few other gripes we had but I won't list them all out. I just needed to say my piece cause I don't think we got the value we paid for and we felt the Yelp reviews were pretty overrated after our experience here.",wwr-V0x5Li7uSywDcNuvWg,4,1,2,mQ3cxzoRPaMQww-lyXFBtg

I just want to give a shout out to the staff here. From the chef sending us a dish on the house to the servers who were always around it was just a great experience.

I came in gym shorts and a sweaty shirt, but the establishment is far from that. I love the yelling when a patron enters, I love the glasses they use, I loved the warmth of the staff.

Chef John has put a lot of thought into his menu.  You won't find a million choices like some joints but everything is prepared with great attention to detail and presentation.  I regularly get the Chef's sashimi platter if I am with a group.

My favorite roll is currently the Diabla Loca Roll ( a newer addition to the menu), but my ""favorite"" depends on the day of the week.  I am also a big fan of those Japanese pickles.  So salty and tasty.  A perfect compliment to the fresh fish.  I could go on and on about the quality of the food and the attention to detail that goes into the preparation, but I might run out of space to mention the great service.  All the servers are genuinely welcoming and provide excellent service.  Sheila is my favorite, but probably because she remembers us as the OG regulars when this place was not a rockstar on Yelp.

I started off with a beer. I'm not a saki drinker. The beer I had ordered was no longer available, but instead of the waitress just coming back and delivering unfortunate news, she had actually brought out a different beer that was comparable to the one I had ordered. She told me the chef had suggested this Kagua Rouge Belgian Strong Dark Ale and I went ahead and got it. The beer was delicious, had the hit of an IPA but replace the bitterness with a nice flowery taste. 

The place is known for their tadas, which is basically for the lack of a better term, a toasted chip with your choice of tuna, shrimp etc. on top. These are delicious and cheap. There are a ton of other great dishes to sample. We tried the Cajun Albacore which had a bit of kick to it and the aioli was not too overpowering. They have some golden ocean trout and the kicker is that they include pop rocks on the bits of fish so it pops in your mouth. It was a bit of a novelty but still delicious and who is going to say no to pop rocks? We also had firecracker rolls and the volcano rolls and they were both delicious.

To top it all off, the waitress also brought us some of the yellow tail free of charge. I thought this was a nice compliment to the meal. She already had shown some great initiative with the beer compromise and now the place was offering us a free yellowtail.

I had heard that the chef really wanted everyone to be fully satisfied and you can see that mission throughout the restaurant. The service is swift and goes above and beyond. The food is delicious, presentation is excellent and the food menu is a bit innovative (pop rocks, tadas). This place is a definite must go.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,2,5,AS6Mor7D-E8kkslaSnNgDQ

4105834,2016-09-10,6,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"This is another great restaurant in the Southwest that hasn't received too much attention lately, judging from my Yelp friends. Fortunately, my IRL friend didn't forget.

One of her favorite local restaurants is Soho Japanese Restaurant, and I was honored that she invited me here on her farewell tour before her relocation to a new city. They're a great modern/fusion restaurant with a menu full of raw fish. If this sounds familiar, that's because there are definitely other local places doing something similar. But I still think this is one of the most affordable, as demonstrated with their happy hour menu, while not sacrificing quality.

I'd heard that they'd taken away the happy hour menu for a while, but they brought it back recently with a vengeance. Five drinks and eleven food items are available for $5 (with the sole exception of tyku sake at $10) starting at [UPDATE 9/12/17: 4pm, don't have to wait until 5pm now] and ending at 7pm every night. We mostly stuck to this menu, save for one ear-catching special of the night mentioned by the server.

Escolar Carpaccio (5 pc): EVOO, Italian seasoning, chives, white ponzu, truffle salt. The fish most commonly served elsewhere as ""super white tuna"" gets a full array of delicious complements here. If you're a fan of super white, you'll be a fan of this. I really liked the smoky charred seasoning on each bite. We ordered seconds of just this dish.

Cajun Albacore Sashimi (5 pc): serrano chili, red onion, spicy garlic, creamy ponzu, shredded daikon. In retrospect, I wish I'd ordered it again because that luscious albacore melted perfectly in my mouth. It's not too spicy overall either.

Crispy Brussel Sprouts (many pc.): citrus butter, roasted pine nuts, more shredded daikon. The sprouts weren't quite as crunchy as I'd hoped, but the pine nuts helped and the citrus butter is my newest addiction. The acidity is subtle, but the richness is front and center and needs to be in every bite. Just soak up that heavenly juice.

Tadas (5 pc): the tostadas may have lost a syllable, but they've kept all of the flavor. We tried the mixed fish order first, which had a huge array of fish and veggies, and then the salmon, which I'm pretty sure is the same old Japanese-influenced pico de gallo mixture. My only issue was the need to portion it out onto the fried wontons ourselves, for which they provide a serving spoon and a reasonable portion of yuzu avocado spread. I'd rather have it pre-portioned in roughly equal amounts as in the original version instead of having to do work and guess.

(Well, one more regret: I did write that I enjoyed the tuna tostadas the most in my first visit, but I forgot about them tonight. Until next time then...)

Amberjack salsa ($14, 6 pc): when the server described the special dishes available tonight, I _figuratively_ jumped out of my chair at the word ""amberjack"" and my friend seemingly did the same. What a fantastic fish. I could've eaten the delicious kanpachi alone here. Appropriately enough, all of the accompaniments were so subtle and indistinguishable to the taste (even the cherry tomatoes) that I may as well have been eating just the fish. It's ironic that, as a composed dish, this was the least impressive order. Perhaps it's one of their experiments that they're conducting for their seasonal menu change (which the server mentioned briefly).

After the removal and return of a revamped happy hour menu, Soho still stands as one of the great local restaurants that happens to be a tremendous value during happy hour. I'm gonna have to come back soon, so as a note to myself, the top of my ""whoops, forgot about that"" list are the tuna tadas and the hydro bibb sea bass. The rest will fall into place easily.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,13,5,HTOOwVQShwE8sxo0CAhKIA

The crispy rice is amazing with the perfect crunch to the rice. The Miso Cod is amazing and always fresh. They have their own signature tuna spice which is a mix of Cajun and some other great spices. The owner and chefs take great pride in the product they serve to their customers here. They do not serve any fish with a sheen or shininess to it. I never fear when I go hear that I may get sick. I feel great every time I leave Soho which is always a good sign when going to eat sushi. We are against going to all you can eat sushi because those places don't serve the best quality sushi. Another great sign is that they do not serve bay scallops which are super cheap. They serve the good sea scallops and they actually aren't crazy expensive for this my wife orders the umami scallop hand roll which is only $5 probably one of the cheapest items on the menu and most places charge $7-8 and they are most commonly bay scallops which are less expensive and have a fishy taste normally with more sand grit in them. The scallops they have here are silky smooth. I cannot stress enough this place again is some of the best sushi you will eat.

I am from SF and was in Vegas for a business trip. Found this place on yelp and when we got there, we were skeptical in the beginning because of the neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant. But I am soooo glad that I found this place because their food is just the best!! The fishes are really fresh and the service is really good. We were told that the Chef/Owner here used to be a sous chef at Aria hotel in Vegas and he always uses fresh ingredients. We ended up going here 2 times within 5 days during our trip. Our favorite dish was special appetizer yellow tail sashimi with soy Yuzu sauce, Miso marinated black cod, Fire cracker roll.

Some of the highest quality fish I have ever had, incredibly creative rolls, and highly accommodating to restrictive diets (I am gluten-free).  First, our server Casey, was extremely observant in identifying that I had asked our drink person for gluten free soy sauce when we were seated and let me know he was more than happy to accommodate.  Then the chefs were great in meeting those needs!

For example, I ordered a roll that is normally deep fried but that does not work with a gluten free diet.  They were willing to skip the frying for me but warned me it probably wouldn't taste the same.  I was so surprised when they brought me the roll to find they had rolled it in gluten free rice cake instead since I couldn't have the tempura fry!  It was so creative and thoughtful to give me as much of the original flavor as possible.  I felt that I was truly valued as an individual!  

Soho, you have earned a customer for life.  And since I come to Vegas every year for a sports tournament, that will be for a long time.

My friends and I (group of 13) went there for a birthday dinner and 5 of us ended up sick the next day.  Throwing up all night and having to miss work the next day.  Best part is we ordered different dishes... 

Yes I know large groups are harder to serve but other restaurants manage to do it just fine, so why not Soho?  To clarify, my group of friends and I are very nice individuals, that do not make large scenes, or loud obnoxious conversations that are sometimes associated with large groups of people getting together. 

We started the evening with a super grouchy waitress who really didn't like answering questions about the serving sizes of TWO MEALS!  Yes, I asked how big the salad and gyoza was.  She gave me an attitude, ""Just order it you will be find out.""   and left without taking our orders.  Upon return she went around the table asking if we were ready, if we were not, she didn't say anything and just rudely turned to another person or different table entirely.  This was sure fire way to a zero tip fast but with large groups we're forced to pay tip obviously, even if it was undeserved.  
Throughout the dinner she would avoid our area and wait on other tables.  We had to ask another waitress for water refills who was actually nice, sorry dear, you have a horrible co-worker to bring this atmosphere down.  
Back to the original waitress, she acted as if we were disrupting her time to flirt with the sushi chefs at the bar.  I could see her from my seat going from the cash register to the bar laughing and giggling then upon turning out to the restaurant she immediately made a disgusted face.  Enough ranting about the overweight rude waitress. 

Now to the food.  Yes presentation was GREAT!!  If there was a section on just presentation you guys got 4.5 out of 5.  
BUT TASTE.... OMG HORRIBLE.  And I mean truly horrible.  
The only thing that tasted ""OK"" was my cut up tomatoes, and the sauce poured under the sushi.  The Angus Gyoza which said Angus was actually sour tasting and could've been lamb maybe?  It had a distinct lamb flavor to it and I'm pretty sure the cows didn't eat any lamb before being slaughtered.  I could be wrong though...  But i'm pretty confident here.  Either way, one piece then the rest sat there waiting to be eaten by flies.

The fish was very bland and broke apart easily before being transported  from the plate to my mouth by my skilled chopstick skills.  I had one piece and left the rest to be thrown away.  I shouldn't smell a fish when i eat sushi, sorry that's just the #1 rule of good vs bad sushi.

Overall, i'm sitting here with diarrhea and puked twice this morning.  Texting my friends who have the same issues.  Five different dishes gave us this and using simple math because I personally didn't share any of my disgusting food can narrow this down to at least two different dishes that night caused our issues today.  

Avoiding this place from now on LIKE THE PLAGUE!",QKvslBvYk9qbd75UGFebNg,0,0,1,odmSjjnnJaBDHWEgH2FvAw
4213783,2014-07-14,1,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"most of the time my friends and I would eat at all you can eat sushi spots, trying to maximize our bang for the buck, usually sacrificing quality for quantity and price. With that said, Soho Japanese Restaurant is one of the best sushi places i've ever had, not only in Las Vegas, but anywhere. Just to get other logistics out of the way, the staff is friendly, prompt, and the Sushi Chef was highly knowledgeable and very catering to our requests. 

The fish is unbelievably amazing. every cut, whether it be sushi or sashimi, was excellent in taste, texture, and ""freshness""  We tried four different Cold Sashimi dishes, all which exceeded my expectations. As well, I am not usually a Uni fan, but after listening to the Chef's explanation of different kinds of Uni, and trying his specific Uni, i realized I never liked Uni because no one ever knew how to prepare it before. the uni at Soho is GREAT. 

The tostada chips are perfect in size, and great on taste. Highly recommend the Mackrel as well. Currently, there ivory salmon is in season. Chef hooked it up with a great  portion that I highly recommend. 

The pieces of sashimi you get for 5 dollars is outstanding. Definitely recommend getting that over sushi. For how good the fish is, I feel like I'm ripping chef off for only paying 5 bucks for each fish. 

Happy hour has great deals (only 1 dollar a taco, asahi draft for 3.) 

Overall, I just can't stop raving about the quality and taste of the food here. Easily my favorite sushi spot in vegas, maybe anywhere. If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.

We ordered some uni and toro from the specials menu...verdict...uni sashimi was on par but the toro was yuck! At $10 a piece you would have thought that it would be some awesome toro but $20 bucks went down the drain (at Kabuto toro is $7 a piece).  It was firm and the texture was not the melt in your mouth toro. I know everyone loves it here but I feel their quality of fish is hit or miss. Obviously for me it's been miss. 

Service was great in the beginning but then we didn't see our server for a good 15-20 minutes after we got our food. Overall, I'm really disappointed about the toro.

That is exactly how I ended up at Soho for happy hour and spending an extra day in Las Vegas! I was excited to finally check off another bookmark from my list of places to try off the Strip.

The wait for 2 on a Tuesday night was estimated to be about 30-40 minutes, but we probably ended up waiting about 20. Not too bad for such a popular place. When we were seated, the menus were pretty overwhelming, but we got to ordering right away to get in on those happy hour prices.

FOOD:
--------

HH Menu:
* Baked Mussels - Everyone raved about these in their reviews, but we honestly didn't see the hype. Maybe I just can't distinguish between different baked mussels because of all the creamy sauce.
* Cajan Albacore Sashimi - One of my favorite dishes of the night with just a tiny kick, nothing too spicy. Note: I'm a huge fan of Albacore so I usually fall hard for it.
* Yellowtail Tostada - Fresh chunks of fish with tasty chips. 

Starters:
* Crispy Brussels Sprouts - A little bit too crispy! They were overcooked in way too much oil, such that the Brussels sprouts were no longer in round form and all the leaves had fallen off. 
* Hydro Bibb Sea Bass - This miso Chilean sea bass served with lettuce cups is super flavorful! It made me crave the rest of the fish.

Rolls:
* Flying Fish Roll - Recommended by our server to be his favorite, this roll did not disappoint with its soft shell crab, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, and creamy ponzu. Although a little too saucy for me, it was still really delicious.

Special:
* Bluefin Duo - When this dish was grandly presented to the next table over in a huge bowl and with something tall curiously sticking out of it, we couldn't help but eye it and request one for ourselves. The special came with one piece each of Akami & Toro, so we ordered 2.

Dessert:
* Green Tea Creme Brûlée - I've had this dessert at other Japanese restaurants and rather enjoyed it, but this version surpassed all the others due to the deeper, more intense green tea flavor. Mm mm mmmm!!!

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-----------------------
Our server was attentive and provided great recommendations. He didn't try to make us over-order, which would have been ridiculously easy, given how hungry we were. Instead he told us we'd ordered enough, and being the gluttons we were, we kept ordering. 

The place is relatively small, so get here early (or arrive later) to avoid the long wait. 

TIP: Get there on time for HH!

We had all their specials that were posted on the board, their unis and oysters were probably one of the freshest I have had in Vegas. They are totally worth whatever they charge you- even though we were charged only 1/3 of what we expected to be charged. They add black truffles and caviar to their sashimi dish, and other dish as well- which are probably the best quality and decoration you can find in any local area-and even strip.

I was certainly part of that demographic, and was only drawn to Soho by their Happy Hour menu, which boasted over 30 small plates for $5 each, along with over a dozen drink specials.

With that many options, I also couldn't help wonder if it was one of those ""quantity over quality"" type of deals, but I had faith in the exceedingly positive Yelp reviews, which were absolutely on point!

A few Happy Hour dishes and infused sakes later, the other menu items started to look more and more enticing (who could resist the allure of Hokkaido uni?!). We ended up venturing beyond the HH menu, adding several nigiri sushi, Kumamoto oysters, and the Firefly Squid to our order. I'm all about trying new fish and got to try akamutsu (black sea perch) sushi for the first time!

Excellent food at reasonable prices, friendly and attentive service, plus a fantastic happy hour are all hallmarks of the Soho experience. I will definitely be returning on my next sojourn in Vegas.

TLDR: One of the best Happy Hours I've had, and the regular menu delivers some pretty solid sushi as well! Don't forget to make a reservation or be prepared to wait.",oy-K-bNNFy2O9rwKC3dteQ,9,6,5,kEUqDVwz6gOs_Y8hM2AU5g

This place has a great vibe. Poppy music playing overhead. I loved the view of the kitchen and sushi bar. That view made me really appreciate the hustle and the amount of people working there. Excellent service all around. 

Here is what we tried: 
Tuna tadas- loved the blast of cilantro and the crunch. I feel like I could snack on those all day. 

The roll with the pop rocks- fun but I guess I like tuna sashimi with just a touch of ponzu or nothing at all.  Don't need to detract from a beautiful cut of fish. 

Firecracker-lots of heat. A warm ""comfort"" type of roll. 

Cajun albacore-was very ""beef like"" because it was seared. 

They brought ought a nice little sample, just buttery/melty piece of sashimi tuna. Wow, delicious and an awesome touch that puts this place above and beyond. 

Someone at a different table was having a birthday while there. They came out with a cake that the family brought and they even cut up and sang for them. Nice touch!",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,3,1,5,3zsi1oIOxBv6KWjiwb9fqw

Surf and turf roll
Salmon carpaccio 
Spicy tuna carpaccio 
Beef carpaccio 

They even hooked up my baby with fries and chicken katsu.

But this visit was different - we found Soho and fell in love.  Both of us felt it was the best overall Japanese meal we've ever had.

Each of the dishes we ordered - and I'd have to say there were really too many - were superb. The highlights - the salmon and the whitefish sashimi and the Twin Dragon Roll.  There are simply too many good things to say about each of the dishes but suffice to say, it was the best.

The service matched the food - terrifically casual, friendly and knowledgeable server with the willingness to let us know what she liked as well as what was popular.  We took her suggestions and were ecstatic!

I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant - get there soon before they move up and out because they definitely deserve to.",9ZBYELd4YhsZxrDGshVRvw,0,0,5,cN3zf_cXHjAfcO-NL7uzPQ

While he worked on the crispy tuna roll, I was having a Harry Met Sally moment with my Salmon Belly - OMG!  Creamy, buttery bliss!

4293795,2014-05-30,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Wow. You know when you see a 5 star place with 10 reviews, and you're like...I wonder if those are legitimate? Well, with over 300 reviews and averaging 5 stars, you know this place is legit.

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday, and it only took literally a few minutes to see why this place was 5 stars. For me, what typically makes a 5 star restaurant is that the food is absolutely delicious, and the SERVICE goes above and beyond and offers true customer service. This place exceeded my service expectations the moment we walked in, and the food was incredible to boot!

Angelica was our waitress, and she was so nice and down to earth. We chatted with her for awhile, and some of the first things she asked were ""is this your first time?"" And ""are you from around here?"" Which in my opinion is great customer management and a VERY good indicator that they're looking to take care of their local regulars. 

We ordered off of the HH (4pm-6pm everyday) menu because it was just priced so damn well we couldn't help it. While waiting, numerous waiters came by asking if it was our first time, and they were genuinely excited for us to try different things on the menu. We felt like guests of honor even though we were 1 of maybe 7 tables. 

We also were a bit chilly because of the AC, so when I was in the bathroom my girlfriend ran to the car and got our sweatshirts. We put them on, and then I noticed our waitress and another waiter walking around the restaurant together. She came back a few minutes later, and said they were really sorry, they realize the AC wind was pretty strong and they turned the system down. Talk about the details!

Now for the food...

We had the gyoza, which I thought were delicious mostly because of the sauce they used. Their was a heavy lime taste to it,  and it was addicting! The stuffing inside was pretty good, and it was fried perfectly. 

For sushi, we got the spicy tuna, firecracker roll, salmon avocado, and shrimp tempura. Next time we will definitely do some sashimi as according to others that's his specialty.  All the rolls were very good and fresh, and the spicy tuna actually had a bit of a kick to it! Usually spicy tuna is barely spicy, but it was spicy enough my girlfriend didn't want more than one....more for me :)

We also got the tuna and salmon tostadas and they were DEVINE. I can't believe it's was 2 for a dollar in HH, REALLY!?

The chef even sent over their yuzu yellowtail special, and it was incredible!!! The tempura jalapeño, or whatever that spice crunch thing on there is, was unbelievable. Amazing spice to balance out the sweet sauce and butter like fish. Truly worth the trip for. 

They finished it off with adorable sushi and bento box key chains for my girlfriend and I, I have NEVER seen a restaurant do that. Key chains?! Now we both have them as a constant reminder of that awesome meal. Brilliant. 

We will be back again....many many times. It's just too good, too fresh, the service is too friendly and too considerate...I just can't NOT eat here regularly. This is how a restaurant should be run. 

Thank you again Angelica, you really made my birthday extra special!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,0,2,5,oB3BdA81dJ-_TM_tx2BJdg

Despite any transportation issues, the meal was completely worth it. We went for lunch and sat at the sushi bar as all of the other tables were taken. We started with a couple basic rolls as well as salmon nigiri. Each piece was excellent. A fresh as promised. I took the advice of the either reviews and tried the tuna tostada. The single best thing I ate in Vegas. The tuna was expertly cut and just the right amount of sesame. We each had a salmon teriyaki bento box. The salmon is grilled and the sauce is served on the side to allow you to choose the amount of teriyaki. The bento box includes a slaw, salad with ginger dressing, steamed white rice, vinegar cucumber salad and miso soup. Each part of the meal was lovely.

The restaurant interior is very basic. The kitchen is open to the dining area and you can watch the sushi chef prepare orders. Despite how busy the restaurant was, our food came out quickly. Our server was polite and attentive.

Driving there and driving up to the place didn't help. It's about 20 minutes to what seems like the middle of nowhere. It's in a nondescript strip mall. The place looks like (in a previous life) it might have been a Five Guys burger joint or Denny's with a new paint job. 

The people could not have been nicer or more cheerful. They highly recommended the sashimi specials so we went with the flow, tempted as we were to just stick to our sushi staples.

Wow! Just wow! The first garlic tuna was really good. Next, they brought us the yellowtail. One problem, we didn't order yellowtail. The waiter was like, ""Dude, you gotta try this!"" The verdict - more yellowtail and make it snappy! We ordered four things off the sashimi menu and when we were done, ordered four more. We could have said, ""surprise us"" and I'm 100% certain we would have been surprised and delighted. How many places can you say that about. And it was very reasonably priced (there's NO place on the strip you can say that about)

We were pleasantly surprised about the happy hour menu & started our order w/ the albacore tuna sashimi for $5 which was explained as the happy hr version of their signature dish of yellow tail sashimi. Unbelievable! After the first few pieces another was ordered immediately. We also had the crunchy shrimp tempura roll, amazing... We continued with an order of their signature yellow tempura sashimi, which was absolutely unbelievable delicious! Spicy Salmon roll, awesome! Beef tadas, so good & ended w/ the chefs specialty steelhead trout sashimi, special belly cut served w/ pop rocks, and I have to say, I am officially in love with Soho! The reviews say it all!!!

4407143,2015-11-01,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Super good. Nice servers. I was really craving sushi when I came in here. And when I say sushi... I mean 5 star 'katsuya Hollywood/ Sherman oaks' type sushi and sushimi. 

I'm not a huge lover of rolls, I always prefer sashimi. I ended up trying this place because any place I lived close to had terrible reviews and this didn't seem too far. 

I ended up driving about 15 minutes... It is pretty far from southern highlands. And I went solo. I had planned to get some work done... But it was pretty busy the week night I went and the hostess took about 10 minutes to acknowledge me, then another 10 to seat me. I'm not docking them for this... Because it was super busy and the wait sign was a bit confusing. 

I was sat at the sushi bar. My server came up quickly to take my order and I got yellow tail sashimi and a water. The sushi bar chef came right up and took over my order and experience. Extremely personable... Made what I was waiting for right there and gave me another 2$ appetizer which gives you about 6 fresh selections to come on a thin crispy wonton with avocado and fresh cilantro. I want to say I order a yellow tail or tuna and this was by far the best and most refreshing thing I ordered. In total I ordered this, yellowtail sashimi which gave like 6-7 BIG pieces and some tuna dish. 

The only area I could tell them to improve is the vibe between my sushi bar server and my actual waiter. Because I ended up tipping my server the standar 20% and tipping the sushi chef 20% in cash because I didn't know who received what. The sushi bar chefs were a lively bunch and handled everything from that point... And once my server let me sit when I was waiting to cash out... The sushi bar guy handled it. 

Portions. I am an athletic female who is tall, and I can eat at times. I came in extremely starving and could only eat 3 bites of the yellow tail, 2/6 bites of my tuna and one of the crudo wonton apps I ordered. I ended up giving the rest of my untouched meal to a lovely couple sitting next to me... Who no joke had about 8 dishes and hadn't even had their main dinner yet.. And they were smaller than me. True sushi fans who I briefly spoke to.. They had nothing but great things to say of the place... And the chef continued sending them other free items.. Something I just noticed. I really appreciated that they gladly accepted my left overs and dug right in!! (I have good taste... No all you can eat rolls here!). 

I am a rare sushi eater that craves higher end sashimis mixed with other fress ingredients. I'm not a huge fan of the all you can eat buffets of tired rolls that are all over town... So if this place serves something like that.. I am just unaware because I just prefer sashimi plates. 

Hope this helps. No place is EVER going to be perfect... But the food was good enough, the atmosphere good enough and my experience good enough to give them a 5 star review because I would highly recommend the place to all sushi lovers!!!!!",T-gxHfxtweNGSIKj1eDIsg,3,1,5,naRy9Xh3JtcqRAk9V4xJsA

4411220,2014-01-02,1,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"My inlaws live right by this place so we decided to check it out.  There were 6 of us, so we were able to try a plethora of items off their lunch menu. Started off rocky with the server not being able to give us a sashimi menu and proceeded to tell us that two people were on a honeymoon. (From a consumer's standpoint, they don't care for excuses.). They should just say they don't have one available at the time.  Let's get to the menu!

Here's what we got to try out:

Garlic shishito pepper-  tasty and if you're lucky spicy
Salmon pico de gallo/ tuna poke sauce- comes on a fried wonton shell and served like a tostada $2 for one and was told $1 during happy hour.. Definitely worth it...happy hour it off and try one of each (there's a few more on the menu)
Big eye tuna poki- literally a poke salad (would have preferred big eye tuna sashimi)
Yellowtail Yuzu Soy-  delicious appetizers and served in thin sashimi pieces
Salmon Wasabi Creme-  served in thin sashimi pieces but the Creme was a little off.  Seemed like wasabi flavored Creme cheese.
Mix Sashimi 12 pcs- overall the sashimi is very fresh and beautifully presented (posted a pic of it)
California Roll-  only ordered this because it was served with real king crab
King Crab Salad- not worth it for $15 opt for the California roll instead

The owner and chef came over to introduce himself and even sent over complimentary uni (picture posted)- which was of course fresh and delectable!

This is probably going to be a new place for everyone to come back to.  We will be back for happy hour when we visit again!  After we had the food their hiccup in the beginning changed their review.

4417569,2014-06-09,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"It's pretty rare I get excited about food. I'll eat it, I'll assess it, I'll write a Yelp review. But rare that I get an emotional reaction from it. This Saturday that all changed!

My girlfriends and I went here - one of whom had already been and was talking it up; she was right because It did NOT disappoint!

I was revealed that the atmosphere was chill, laid back, friendly, and welcoming. Not like the stuffy sushi places closer to the strip. Our server, Charles, was friendly, funny , and prompt with our orders. There was a lot of confusion and talk about what to order. He quickly stepped in and made the suggestion that the chef could present some cold and warm dishes at his recommendation until we were full. Sold!!!

Since I can't find the menu online, I'm going to recall the dishes as best I can:

Yellowtail Yuzu Soy - Texture like butter. So fresh, you wouldn't think it was fish. Love the tempura jalapeno on top. 

Gyoza - I HAVE to get gyoza at sushi time. Love this gyoza. Beef was fresh and moist. Not dried out and greasy. Very well done! 

Mussels: I can't believe more people that wrote reviews didn't try this dish. Don't be afraid people!!!! These were incredible

Live soft shell crab - not actually live, but very very fresh. Crab was fried served over a bed of fancy salad (""fancy"" meaning it wasn't just crappy iceberg lettuce). The sauce that came on the dish with this was incredible. Spicy but not too spicy. This one had a perfectly balanced textures and flavors. 

Salmon Sashimi - It had pop rocks on it!!!!! So weird, but really amazing. 

I wish I could remember everything we ate. The servers were great. They kept checking on our appetite level. He wasn't pushy about desert or drinks, which was nice. The price for all of us was incredibly reasonable considering the quality of the food. We walked away paying about $45/person. I consider that a steal for this place.

I had such a great experience here. I have been blabbing about it to everyone. I CANNOT wait to come back and try some new things.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,4,1,5,KE7pQ2yl8ULvxtMMcEy8Mg

4457037,2014-01-25,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I adore Soho. My husband and I travel to Vegas on business twice a year for several weeks at a time, and lately I have found so much delight in the gems located off the strip rather than on. Soho was one of the best finds we stumbled upon. The quality of ingredients at this sushi restaurant are top-notch. While ALL sushi restaurants really need to ensure their food served is of the utmost quality and freshness, sadly this isn't the case. But no worries with Soho. 

We ordered several appetizers (including the rock shrimp with dipping sauces, omg!), seaweed salad, edamame, miso soup, sashimi and then a bunch of rolls for our dinner. While a ""veggie roll"" is not very exciting nor is it ever really worth mentioning - theirs was so good I nearly fell off my seat. The asparagus used inside the roll was SUPER crunchy and I honestly thought they executed this normally bland roll perfectly. Also, the crispy crab roll was one of the best I have ever had in my life.

I would also like to mention that the owner/chef was by far the nicest gentlemen I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He came by our table several times to ensure we were having a good time -- he sent the sashimi compliments -- and he also came by and asked us if we wanted dessert on the house.

We started with the Yellowtail Yuzu Soy cold appetizer which was a beautiful and succulent yellowtail sashimi. Melts in your mouth. This was hands down my favorite menu item of the evening. I *LOVE* yellowtail.   

We also tried four different kinds of soho tostadas, salmon, shrimp, hamachi and tuna. SO GOOD. It is very unique and flavorful, you have to try it. It's only $2 each for a two-bite taste, delicious. 

The seared tuna tartare was delicious, as was hamachi poke salad and albacore. The last item we tried was the philadelphia roll, which tasted much different than regular philly rolls because it is made with smoked salmon. Every bite was awesome. 

See my pictures - words cannot alone describe the beautiful presentations. 

Overall, the quality of the food and the presentation is what makes this a 5-star review. No AYCE menu, they don't need it - this is again about quality, not quantity.

4557162,2014-04-05,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"This is quite possibly the best Japanese restaurant I've ever experienced. The chef/owner used to be the executive chef at Social House in Treasure Island and I'm assuming he kept all his connections because the fish quality is on par with the world class sushi joints on The Strip, but you're paying normal prices. 

A few things are worth highlighting as to why this place deserves nothing less than 5-stars:

First, Chef Lee is incredibly passionate about the experience. If he has the bandwidth, he'll personally visit every table in the place just to find out how you're enjoying the food. I've never seen another chef do this as frequently or with as much enthusiasm. Also, he'll take note of commonalities amongst your orders and make recommendations for other dishes he thinks you will like. His recommendations to us have all been things we've never heard of, like engawa and sawagani, but have been soooo good and worth ordering again. 

Second, in case you glossed over it above, the quality of his fish is on par with the best restaurants in town. Further, he designed the menu to include unique dishes you won't find anywhere else, such as the tostadas. Ask him about his specials if you want to get your hands on the one-off buys that he doesn't list on the menu.

Finally, SoHo won't break the bank. If you go all out for dinner, you may spend $50 per person (not including alcohol), but we usually end up around $35 per person. If you go there for lunch, you can get an entire meal for $8.50. Pretty awesome.

If you're a fan of Japanese food or just like trying new places, you would be out of your mind not to give SoHo a try.",hAn8Y_EWYxOSUnaZt72h4w,3,1,5,RtiA5a6VyMmTsZPk6CP5tA

4573187,2014-07-06,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Do yourself a favor, don't bother with the sushi rolls.  They are pretty bland and are not very interesting.  The Firecracker roll was surprisingly bland given its jalapeno content and the other couple rolls we tried were just meh and we get way better sushi rolls at our regular place.  For that reason, this restaurant does not deserve to be the #1 restaurant on Yelp.  

Everything else - WOW!  The quality and cuts of fish are excellent - you cannot go wrong with the sashimi.  The tostadas are a good little value at only $1 each during Happy Hour - the Salmon and Hamachi are the best ones and they taste awesome!  The mussels were very good and used uzo so they had a great citrus punch.  Don't skip dessert - we loved the matcha tiramasu because it was the perfect little size after we stuffed ourselves with sushi.

Even during Happy Hour, you will end up spending quite a bit of money.  The service also was only 3/5 on the night we went but they were quite busy and the people were pleasant just scattered about and not that attentive.  I enjoyed eating here but it did not blow my mind like Kabuto and it is also not as convenient and cheap as my regular place down the street from me.  Maybe if they rotate the selections on their Happy Hour menu I would go back, but probably not for any other reason.

This place IS THE BEST restaurant in Vegas, hands down.

I just went back recently and everything - I mean EVERYTHING I had was DELICIOUS - OK??!!!

The thin, crisp, succulent tempura is good enough to knock your socks off. Twice. California rolls were dainty and appetizing. Even the soy sauce was served in soy pots, and the ginger had a nuance I've never tasted before. Here's where it gets interesting: the triple S roll was delicious with a little kick. I thought it would be my favorite, but things only got better from there. Chef brought out their specialty yellowtail dish, which was beautifully cut, topped with a subtle-tasting micro cilantro, and thinly sliced tempura Serrano. The light dressing had a clean taste, and this will no doubt be a favorite of mine when the heat strikes in summer. Chef also brought garlic tuna tetake, which was perfectly seasoned and had a delightful crunchy garnish. It all was so good, my mom and husband, who don't eat much fish, liked it. My dad ordered a rainbow roll for dessert (also excellent). The real dessert menu was refreshing for a Japanese restaurant. We shared a chocolate mousse cake, and that was a mistake; sharing, that is. This caliber of food is something you'd find in a Michelin star restaurant. However, the prices are affordable. The atmosphere is welcoming and pleasant, not too fussy. The staff and chef made the whole experience all the more enjoyable. They were very accommodating with our two small children and offered to rearrange the chairs to ensure our comfort.

One of my friends raved about SoHo and suggested we meet here to catch up. If you must know, I've been keeping a close eye on restaurant hygiene after a few unpleasant creepy-crawly incidents in Chinatown over the summer which allowed me to notice that the place was spotless, simple and minimally decorated. The last time we went, they seemed to be short on staffed so we did not really mind them taking a while on the orders. 

What they lacked for in their service that day, they made up for in their food. I ordered the seared tuna salad, a little pricey for greens at first glance but you would soon understand why. It is served as a bundle of microgreens with a special citrusy dressing, tuna sashimi seared perfectly to crispiness on its sides and sprinkled with deep fried onion pieces. I was in salad heaven! For such a healthy serving of vegetables, it does not fail to impress and I just had to go back again earlier this afternoon to order the exact same thing!

On the other hand, my friend ordered the tonkatsu curry - my usual bento favorite - from the lunch specials and she had great things to say. It came with miso soup, a small bowl of vegetables and rice. (For options such as salmon teriyaki, an order also comes with edamame and a delicious garlic sauce).They closely rival the bento boxes at RA on the Strip in portion size and price but SoHo clearly has a larger pool of options for lunch which makes it a more attractive spot.

I chose to have an omakase here on my birthday. The wait was a bit long. They have a fusion take on sushi, with many of the dishes infused with ponzu sauce and other non-traditional accompaniments. The price was very reasonable. Significantly less than my last omakase in San Franacisco. Better yet, you could to get an omakase a requested price.

The wait times, with a reservation, were within 5 minutes. They sat us down this is where they began to lose a bit of their steam. They asked us for drink upon sitting down and brought them, however we didn't hear from a server for a while. They came and asked for our order which by then are water cups were half way empty for most of us and they never came back to fill them, until after we began to get our food. The food times were decent, but servers wouldn't come by often to refill drinks or checkup. 

Judgment of service: A bit slow
 
   Food Quality: Most of the sushi tasted amazingly, some of the sashimi wasn't amazing, but almost all the food had a nice taste. All the fish was fresh and was prepared amazingly. Plus, the food times were great. We never had to wait long for anything we ordered, always had something to eat while enjoying our conversation. The presentation above all was the best part of the meal. The chefs worked quickly and gave attention to detail with all plates. Making the food look more delicious than it already seemed.  

Judgment of food: Amazing
 
   Cost: The cost seemed quite fair for the quality and presentation of the food. They take the time on each order and it shows. However much the services may lack, the food easily recovers for them. You are for the most part looking at about twenty-five to thirty-five per person for a decent meal.
Judgment: Average
 
   Atmosphere: The restaurant was very small, not giving much room between tables. Which took away from the food. It made you feel enclosed and didn't offer the privacy and comfort you would have expected with the quality of the food. However, the atmosphere was light and opening. The noise level was a bit above average voice, but you could still easily talk to your friends or date. This seems most of a party environment than a date because of the slightly more open and louder environment.  

   Judgment: Average

Over all it was a nice place with amazing food. The price is quite respectable for the food they are giving. I wouldn't recommend for a date night, but a great place for a small group of people.

She's been talking about her previous visits for the past three years, and has compared all other Sushi restaurants to Soho since her first visit and now I totally understand why. We sat at the sushi bar so we could watch the chefs create their magic. I'm amazed at how quickly they worked, and how much fun everyone was having. You know it's a great business with great employees because everyone was laughing and cracking jokes all night long. When everyone behind the counter works at the same level and in perfect harmony, that quality is reflected in the end product. After about 4-5 happy hour appetizers, we ordered a few entree rolls. The standout or all of the standouts was the Double Dragon roll. The perfect balance of hot/cold and well as texture, this might be the ""perfect roll"".

We focused on the Happy Hour menu which was simple since there were so many wonderful items on it! The prices made it even sweeter (everything ranged from $1-5). 

I'm a big fan of fruit-flavored cold sake, so I was immediately drawn to their Soho Infused Sake with Lychee and White Peach options. A small carafe was just $4 (reg. $8) and enough for 6-7 shots. I was floored by the amazing deal and it is delicious. You could tell that it was made in-house with a natural flavor and light sweetness. We tried both flavors and White Peach was chosen as the favorite.

We tried a couple sushi rolls: Firecracker Roll ($8, H/H $5) which has spicy tuna, jalapeño, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried; Shrimp Tempura Roll ($6; H/H $4) with avocado and cucumber; and Salmon Avocado Roll (H/H $4). I didn't really care for the Firecracker Roll, but I also didn't realize it was fried (I'm not a fan of deep fried rolls or cream cheese in my sushi - fail on my part for not checking descriptions). The other two were fine, but really nothing special.

Other appetizers: Ika Geso (H/H $4) and Cajun Albacore Sashimi ($11, H/H $5) served with Serrano chili, red onion, ponzu aioli, and spicy garlic ponzu on a bed of julienned radish. Both delicious!

""SOHO Tadas"" (Tostadas) are $2/each (except the Beef Tostadas) and during Happy Hour, the Salmon, Tuna, Hamachi, and Tako are just $1/each. A thin ""tostada"" crisp is topped with avocado creme and micro cilantro before being packed with delicious raw seafood. The Salmon is served with pico de gallo, the Tuna is made with Hawaiian poke sauce, the Hamachi is tossed in a salsa verde, and the Tako is served ""kimchee"" style (tossed in chojujang). All of them were delicious and refreshing. I love the variations of flavors and I think it is an amazing value for the amount of quality seafood! These are a must for your meal. I can't wait to try the beef, white fish, and shrimp ones!

Mr. Lee (owner and former executive chef of Social House at The Crystals) was so kind to welcome us (since it was all our first time), chat for a bit, and offer us a complimentary tasting of their signature dish! The Yellowtail Sashimi ($12) served with Tempura Serrano, micro cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust was absolutely delicious. 

The whole night pretty much went like that. Amazing service from several servers in the form of constant water refills, attentiveness, and just all-around kindness. I asked the server for a pen when I realized the one I keep in my purse had died and instead of just allowing me to borrow one, I was given a SOHO-branded pen! Then, as we were preparing to leave, the same server presented a plate of adorable sushi key rings and phone charms!! What restaurant gives keyrings to their patrons?! Just, wow. Everyone was so, so nice to us! We couldn't stop talking about it even as we exited the restaurant!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,6,4,O6K01UVxeILuwz34WDgz_w

That Yellowtail was the best tasting Yellowtail sashimi I ever had before! Thank you Chef!

Ever since, we returned many times and the quality of food never changed.

It was a timeframe when the restaurant was open for dinner only, and I didn't like it.
Now, I am very happy SOHO is open for lunch again! Also Happy Hour is back, too!

Last time we were here, we tried the Lunch Prix Fixe ( available from Monday to Saturday, Noon-4pm), either for $8.95 or $10.95 ...
I choose the Teriyaki Salmon with white rice. It was including a Miso soup and a mixed greens salad ($10.95).
The portion was very sensible but satisfying.
Dessert was available to add for additional $2.- and I choose the Mochi Ice cream, 2 pieces (one green tea and one mango flavor) ... Very yummy!
Also ordered a glass of Sangria ($3) and a glass of Iced green tea ($3) ... 

Noticed that the restaurant got very comfortable, new chairs! I really like the way it looks!

While I don't remember the specific name of what we ate (it was a special) the fish was fresh and melted in your mouth like butter. In fact, we did not need to chew any portion of our meal except for the sushi (barely!). We were seated right away with reservations, and the staff was so pleasant.

We ordered the Mio sparkling sake which went great with the seafood options. Everything including the fish and sake were affordably priced.

Had the lunch special that came with a salad, side of cucumbers, steamed rice, 4 piece of spicy tuna roll (by the way the roll dimension was the size of a quarter. Not exaggerating)

There was nothing spectacular about any part of my lunch at all.  

Service was terrible.  Walked in, waited at the front, not sure if I was supposed to seat myself.  Waited for anyone to even make eye contact but all the staff seemed too busy to even notice. Finally walked up to one of the servers and she sat me at the bar.  Took a while for a server to come take my order.  Once I ordered it.  Took a while to get my food.  They dropped off my food and not a single server stopped by to see how I was doing.  No One!  

I ate everything, because I was starving.  Was up for 5 hours running errands and didn't have anything to eat.  Everything was below average.  Fish did not seem fresh to me. Salad and cucumber was tasteless, miso soup tasted  like all soy sauce based.  The steam rice was good. But I wish I had ordered the Chicken Katsu lunch instead.  Was still hungry, but  I can't eat just steam rice plain.   Why would you serve a bowl of steam rice with sushi anyways?

To sum it up...this place is FAR from 5 stars.  It's lacking in every department.  Oh and I their credit card machine was down so the server told me that she had to write down my credit card number and enter it later.  Geez. 

There isn't any reason I could think of to bring me back here.

Goyemon is and has always been my favorite.  I just wanted to see what all this 5 star rating hype was all about.  And I'm sorry but this is a completely misleading...5 star?  More like 5 NOs!!!!",-Q4lgMSfhoSiVj62dvzUPw,5,3,1,d6Y3pCwVRygoVXWB7aYbsQ

So what better night to try SoHo than anniversary night? Based on its fabulous reviews from fellow yelpers, I wasn't worried and certainly was not disappointed! 

From entry to exit it was an excellent dining experience! One of the best I've had in a long time. From the food to the service, everything was rockin'! Our waiter was on point, friendly and funny, attentive but not pushy....perfect! 

Food....delish!!!! We ordered so many things I don't know where to begin. It's almost like Japanese tapas being as the servings are so small. We had the yellowtail sashimi appetizer- I've had this citrusy yellowtail and jalapeño creation many times and at many different restaurants and its by far my favorite thing to order, but it was also by far my favorite here at SoHo!!! They made it different by frying the jalapeño in a tempura batter I believe which gave the dish a slight crunch and made it different than other establishments! Well played SoHo, well played! Onward.....tostada's, think we had 10! Tuna, shrimp and hamachi all delish. Angus gyoza, cod lettuce wraps, and crispy tuna all phenomenal. 

Nice touch...the chef came to our table and spoke with us, even brought us a special dish. Hawaiian tuna poke, which was so light and delectable I wanted a second order but was too stuffed to go there! 

This may very well be my favorite new sushi spot. We will know the next few times I go, but from first glance it's a winner.",f3ptgbODfNoKMDnSxOCj8A,6,1,5,sY15s7urgIPtoLT6knYtBg

Three words, order ALL the tadas. We couldn't decide which was our favorite since all 6 tasted phenomenal. We also ordered the Cajun albacore cold plate, soft shell crab appetizer and twin dragon roll...all were AWESOME!

Our server recommended the green tea tiramisu and it did not disappoint. You definitely need to save stomach room for this. 

I don't think we can go back to the other sushi place.

The waitress (Patty) handed us the menu and mentioned it's still happy hours. After a minute looking at the happy hours menu,  we decided to ask the young sushi chef (Aaron) what he would recommend because we didn't really know the menu but want to take advantage of the happy hours (which we didn't know or expected from a highly rated restaurant). Aaron asked if we like sushi or sashimi more and we said Sashimi. He recommended a few and we ordered as recommended. Aaron said not to worry about the happy hours cut-off and take our time. His attitude was very cool and made us feel very welcoming. Aaron  prepared some awesome dishes for us and they were very good.

We invited Aaron to drink Sake with us and eventually got John & Oscar plus Patty to join us... it was like celebrating our anniversary with a bunch of close friends and we had such a fantastic time with them.

The bill came out to be much less than expected and I honestly thought they miscalculated because a sashimi dinner like what we just had and the many bottles of Sake we drank,  I was expecting 2x or 3x the amount.

Now the food: EXCELLENT QUALITY, INCREDIBLY TASTETY, AND BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED.

I particularly like:
The yuzu yellowtail
Cajun albacore
Hyrdo bibb sea bass
White peach sake

The hydro bibb used to be black cod but honestly the sea bass tastes the same to me. (Though in my case I only eat here maybe twice a year while visiting.)

Other notes:
Small restaurant,  expect to wait during peak hours
Try the green tea tira misu when they have it in stock
Ladies room has two stalls, which is a nice surprise lol

Though Soho seems to be more of a $$$ restaurant than a $$ restaurant,  it's actually quite affordable for the quality of the sashimi you get. Ordering a roll will help fill you up. I think the white peach sake is a great deal, you are getting a small bottle of a strong yet sweet sake for only $9, which would normally get you one watered-down cocktail somewhere else.",P4W8wQEfASsc-yCVPclqjA,2,0,5,24_SWr2YkI-TuvfpfQhfCQ

I had been wanting to try Soho forever since the reviews look great but never really got around to it.. So when my gfffffff told me I definitely should try it out because she loved it, I dragged my mom there to grab an early dinner.. We actually came during Happy Hour so that was an added bonus! 

There was a about a 10 minute wait because a large party had just left so the tables had to be broken down..no biggie! But when we were sat it was almost like we were forgotten.. Our server ended up being Sheila who was just fantastic! She was so sweet and informative. Definitely suggest sitting in her section!

-HH Cold lychee sake - served in a nice sake glass.. Not too sweet and went down smooth.. I really liked how Sheila would refill my sake cup since that is not something that is practiced at all neighborhood sushi joints..
-HH Tostadas- the yellowtail, salmon and tuna ones were so good and fresh! The kimchi Tako one was a little on the salty side.
-HH Firecracker- I usually don't like deep fried rolls but this one was good and not oily!
-HH spicy tuna roll & salmon avocado roll.. Fish was fresh but the rice was a bit too sweet
-HH hydro bib black cod- 2 in one order.. My mom loved these.. Don't know if you're supposed to eat it like a lettuce wrap but that's what she did lol
-Ume scallop- so fresh and delicious with a little bit of yuzu, tobiko and salt... mmmmmM the cilantro goes perfect with it as well
-Yuzu Soy Yellowtail- at the end of the meal Sheila brought out this dish on the house since it was our first time and this is their signature dish (they did this for my gfffff too). The fish was good but it was way too cold almost like it was just defrosted.. I really appreciate them bringing out this dish for us and it says lots about their customer service! 

I will definitely be back! HH is awesome and their lunch specials look good too!

They tasted so fresh and full of flavor. I actually loved the simplicity of the rolls because I am so sick of the typical sauce-drenched rolls masking their mediocrity behind pools of spicy mayo and dollops of eel sauce. In stark contrast, you could taste the fresh fish of each of these rolls, along with whatever crisp or tender veggie it was rolled with, and perfectly cooked rice served at just the right temperature as needed to taste the balance of the subtle rice vinegar. 

We sat at the sushi bar and watched the chefs create all of their masterpieces. It was mesmerizing. Even while there were extremely busy, they were always friendly and helpful and found time to check on us. The chef saw my friend give me a birthday card and they sent out some Mochi with a birthday candle and the whole restaurant sang happy birthday. It was the nicest thing ever!

a.  You have to really enjoy real Japanese food, seafood, and the infusion of subtle flavors in order to really reap the full benefits of this restaurant.  

b. The only other restaurant now that I would say is close to this would be Yonaka over on the west side.

c.  Here is what I have found to be extremely consistent:

- Value - The place is an amazing value for the quality of food and the uniqueness as well!  Previous to Soho and Yonaka, I would get my fill of really unique Japanese from Nobu. I would easily pay 150.00 plus per person and while having a very good meal, I would feel like I did not get any great value.  Here at Yonaka, the value is amazing. From Uni to Hamachi Kama to Hydro Bibb, the prices, value and the quality of food is spectacular!.  You can pay for four people about 150.00 including tip if there is no alcohol or dessert.

- Chef - Chef John Chien is absolutely creative, welcoming and passionate about his craft. He is extremely consistent, very adventurous and is involved in all aspects of his restaurant.  He will wave at you and make you feel at home. Who doesn't love going home.  There is no place like home!

- Food - Everyone has already posted all the different menu items, the choices, menu and etc.  All I can add is that I am always excited to come here.  I am looking forward to ordering the same things, new things and what is on special.  The same things seem to always be unique and better tasting than the last time.  The new things are always such a wonderful delight and the specials are always so darn creative.

d.  Groundhog Day - Do you remember this Bill Murray movie where he lives the same day over and over again?  My favorite quote from this movie is ""I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank pina coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over.""  If I had to live a day over, it would be dining at Soho every day.  It just gets better and better.

e. Quick hints - Always busy, off hours are going to be best, but still busy.

First - you will be welcomed genuinely. I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef chatted me up through the meal, as did the peeps next to me. This is a locals place in the best way. 

Second - value. From 5-7 M-F they have a great happy hour. Beer, sake, apps, some Sashimi plates are just $5. The regular prices are a BARGAIN people - I live in MKE and let me tell you, it's not a high roller sushi town (big surprise right?) but I would expect to pay at least 50% more. On the Strip? For this quality, you should pay triple! The sushi chef said they get people bitching about their prices and I have to be honest - what????? This is some top quality shit (aka Nobu) and amazing preparations.

Third - sashimi. Yes, please - all day. The chef specializes in it, and the cold sashimi dishes are where it's at. Started with Cajun albacore ($5 HH) which was wonderfully peppery, then salmon wasabi ($11) - a ton of lovely fish. After that - yellowtail (comp'd) - fucking amazing, then ocean cod w/pop rocks ($12) - must have, so creative! Finally - escolar carpaccio ($5 hh), and raw fish Italian style followed by one bite tuna tartare with gold leaf. Does that sound like a lot of raw fish? Too bad!! Don't judge me - I've been dreaming about a return to Soho for 2 years. Let me have my moment. My bill? For all this perfect fish + 2 sakes???? $46 - what?????????? I can't even - that is crazy. 

How this place doesn't have a line out the door and around the block, I don't know. I do know that many of the local chefs from the Strip get their sushi on here and you should too!",PLOYtrCMUFPHQe2IbYAd5g,7,2,5,NP5v63IQKMZJqVmd00tYvw

We went for lunch the very first time and let's just say I was not too thrilled about the whole experience.  It wasn't even worth writing a review in my opinion because lunch was boring.  I honestly had no intention of returning, but Soho's reviews just kept getting better and better.  This time, we made a point of coming for dinner because that's where all the unique offerings happened.  (Since our first visit, I think they do offer more of their exciting menu items during lunch time.)

The Lunch Experience:

The Husband got the Loco Moco Lunch Seto ""Soho Blend Seasoned Hamburger Patty"" ($8.50).  

* Sashimi Lunch Seto ""Chef's Choice"" ($8.50)

The lunch menus offered were disappointing and they didn't look that special either.  I went to check it out during its first month when all the rave reviews were happening. I was very disappointed, especially when only up the street is an awesome Japanese bento lunch special that I truly love.  

A few months go by and Soho is still blowing up, so we decide to give it a try and make sure that we make it over for dinner. The whole experience was a complete 180.  The dinner menu cannot compare to the lunch menu at all!  Lunch is a 2-3 experience and dinner is a 4-5 experience.

The Dinner Experience: 
We ordered mostly from the Special Cold Dishes and what a treat they were.  Yum  yum.  

The owner was about to come to our table during our first visit, but a bunch of his former colleagues all walked in and he never had a chance to return.  This time he chatted with us and sent over a comped dish and just made the effort on building a more personal experience and customer base.  I really appreciate the effort.

I think their lunch offerings have since changed and they are allowing you to order other things besides their basic lunch menu.  Thank goodness.  Would hate for people to judge this place based on their original lunch menu. Bleh.

These are the yummy dishes we ordered: 
* Salmon Wasabi Creme ($11)
* Yellowtail Yuzu Soy ($12)
* Ume Scallop ($12)
* Miso Marinated Black Cod ($18)
* Sea Urchin Sashimi ($9)
* Spicy Salmon Handroll ($4)
* White Fish Shiso Pesto Tostada ($2)
* Wild Saba
* Hamachi Salsa Verde Tostada ($2)
and two other specials that I can't remember the name of but it looked and tasted awesome.

Presentation is definitely something to write home about and everything tasted fresh.  It was just a really great experience coming for dinner. We definitely plan on going there again during dinner time!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,26,16,4,GPhftruvC2wk9WaecDbGcw

We had uni, Tuna Takaki salad, cucumber salad and just about everything else and ended with fresh mochi and a green tea Cree brûlée. Right??  

I'll just make a long story short. After driving 8 hours, being 9:00 at night it was the perfect way to end a great day.

For instance, the HH menu seems reasonable bc everything is 3-6$, but for what you get, a bit pricey. 

I.e., 
-Sashimi tostadas are a dollar, each. the hamachi salsa verde tostada was delightful, interesting flavors, freshness of fish was average. 
- Black cod lettuce cups are 4, for two cups, which are basically a bite each with a piece of cod the size of an eraser.  I'm used to tender, buttery whitefish at home (chiliean sea bass, cod, etc), so I wasn't super impressed. Tasted for the most part-- salty. 

I'd def go for the cold sashimi plates, the waitress said it was their specialty.  The cajun albacore was fresh and tasty, not super pricey, but not a great value either $12. (see pic) 

** I have yet to try the typical sashimi fishes, so I can't comment on the freshness of fish** 

Can't vouch for any rolls except their spicy tuna roll ($4), and was pretty disappointed, flavorless and super mushy.  

Uni was tasty. not super well versed, but it was 12$ for 4 pieces of the Santa Barbara Uni Sashimi. (cheapest type)


The service was super, you could ask anything there to help you out, and they were laid back and not in your face.

So good, I noticed they had an average of 5 stars with over 250 reviews! WOW! That's amazing. I'm always up for new places, especially ones with amazing reputations. What I didn't realize was how amazing this place was going to be!

This restaurant is located on the Southwest side Las Vegas in an up and coming area. New homes and business are opening every single month. Soho is located in a strip mall a couple of blocks south of the 215. Once you enter, you'll notice a very small location. A few tables in the main dining room and a sushi bar around the corner. The prominent color in this joint is red, but not an obnoxious shade, more of a warmer color. From the chopsticks to the seats, to the service, this place really takes the time to focus on their customers. Our server tonight was Sheila. She was definitely on point. Super personable, super accommodating and very efficient. By the time we were finished with our meals, I felt like I was hanging out with a friend. I really enjoyed her as a server! This place truly takes pride in their service as well as their food. Here's what we had tonight and here's what I thought:

Yellowtail Yuzu Soy for $12: Sheila said this was their signature dish so we just had to try it! Sliced Yellowtail sashimi topped with tempura serrano peppers, garlic dust and micro cilantro over a bed of Ponzu sauce and garlic oil. WHAT AN AMAZING DISH! The sashimi was super fresh, the serrano, dust and cilantro brought a  clean crisp taste and texture to the raw fish and the oil and sauce enhanced the overall flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!

Mixed Sashimi (15 pc.) Special for $25: One of my friends tonight recommended this  dish to share. I'm so glad she did! This huge dish came with various cuts of sashimi: Tuna, salmon, 2 kinds of snapper, yellowtail and scallops. Each cut was super fresh and not accompanied with a super fishy smell. The garnish made the plate super easy on the eye, but the food solidified it's beauty. Definitely a must try!

Tuna Box Sushi for $12: This was a cool roll! Tuna, Spicy Mayo, avocado, shrimp and rice crackers all formed into a box shape. The flavor was insane! First, I'm going to keep reiterating the fact that the proteins are so fresh! What I really liked was the crunch from the rice cracker balls. The crunchiness really brought a nice texture to the overall roll.  You have got to try this one!

Spicy Salmon roll for $6: So good, we ordered 6 of them! Spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber in a roll. What stood out was that there was a lot of salmon in this roll! Definitely worth the price and the salmon had a really good flavor to it. I loved it!

Man, I'm so glad I was able to try this place. It's become such a huge favorite spot within the Yelp community and I can definitely see why! Our party was really treated with the most respect and I truly appreciated it. Reviewing a place involves your opinion in multiple areas including, but certainly not limited to, the atmosphere, the service and the food. In other words, the entire experience and let me tell you, Soho has exceeded my experience expectations.

My boyfriend wanted to get sushi as we had a huge dinner the other night at Sushisamba (review upcoming). I start looking for sushi restaurants in LV and Soho comes up. My boyfriend checks it out and says ""nah this doesn't look like sushi, look at the pictures"". The pictures were showing a lot of rolls and I had already decided that I wanted the rib (somehow I was pretty hungry even after the big meal) as it had great reviews. Also, the pictures could be deceiving as they have changed their menu slightly, so the pictures of the menu here are outdated. We decided not to go there as he wasn't that hungry. To be honest, even though I love rolls, I prefer sashimi or sushi, way less filling and delicious. Previously we had gone to an AYCE sushi place where we learned that they didn't serve sashimi and they complained when we left some rice. 

Anyways, he was not that hungry to try another AYCE given that they never offered sashimi and we waited. I was starving so eventually he felt sorry for me and we drove to Soho. As soon as we were parking we noticed the amazing lunch deal: $8.50!!! We had to check that out. 

We went inside, were seated and the waiter asked us how we found the place. I said Yelp and he said ""well the food reviews are always on point, the service has been up and down but we'll try the best"". I liked his honesty. We were given the lunch menus and one dinner menu. We both ordered the sashimi lunch which was 7 pieces of nigiri plus a bowl of rice, salad and miso soup. I ordered the ribs ($19) from the dinner menu (the one that is here is outdated) and waited.

The lunch boxes came first. I really have to say that this is the best sashimi lunch I have eaten EVER. First, the price was only $8.50, second, the pieces were big. And I mean big, I was pleasantly surprised. Many people think that you can not get full from sashimi lunches because it is only fish but trust me, you can.

As for the rib, it was delicious as well. It fell off the bone, the sauce was good, the potatoes great, everything awesome. 

As soon as we were done with the food, the chef approached our table and introduced himself saying how pleased he was that we ordered the sashimi and the rib. He then asked us if we were full. We said yes (because we were). He then asked again that if he were to send us something, we would eat it. Of course we said YES!. A couple minutes later, the waitress brought us a plate from the chef. He sent us a couple pieces of Yellowtail Yuzu Soy which she said was their #1 dish. The pieces were delicious. 

As for the service, it was great. The waiter that seated us said he had to go and pointed us to the girl who would be taking care of us from then on. 

Really great and surprisingly affordable lunch!",WvZY3wu2TaiqxkD_5ec5BA,1,0,5,2_nX7l5er8LpzoNHL8G6FQ

A few things we ordered were the soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura roll, california roll, short ribs and the seared tuna and they were all AMAZING. The sushi here is so fresh and hand made by the chef himself. The short ribs were extremely tender and mouth watering. You didn't need a knife to cut them because it was easy to tear apart.

Aside from what we ordered, the chef actually gave us yellowtail sashimi on the house!!! It was such a nice gesture and it tasted fantastic!

I came in thinking that it definitely inflated as there isn't really anything else like in in the area. I left feeling pleasant after a good meal so while it may be inflated, I am a believer that the food is good.

We were in the neighborhood and decided to come by for lunch. 

The fiance and I share a few plates - 

Beef teriyaki set lunch - I like that they use sliced steak for this and not thin shaved meat. It's much better quality than most offer. It comes with a mix green salad (not just iceburg), miso, pickled cucumbers and rice which were standard, but solid. 

Spicy tuna roll - just wanted something simple and this filled the request. It was cut and made well. 

Soho -tadas get a lot of buzz so we both got a yellowtail one. This was yummy, I enjoyed the avocado cream on it. 

Compliments of the chef we got yellowtail yuzu which was great quality fish and I enjoyed the texture of the fried jalapenos and use of coarse finishing salt on it. 

So based on the food, they are an above average Japanese food spot, but what really stood out for me was the service! Our drinks were topped off in such a intuitively quick manner which was appreciated on this hot summer afternoon. Both guys checking on our table were friendly to boot and was personable cracking jokes with us. The chef/owner came out to check on everyone which I always feel is a nice touch  and he seemed genuinely humble. 

On a second visit it was raining and our server (guy with longish hair and glasses) took his apron off and covered customers and walked them to their car. That is a absolute gentleman going above and I really respect that. 

I am enamored with the friendly staff and enjoyed my lunch both occassions that I most definitely will be back when I'm in the area to see more of what this place has to offer.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,2,4,CLVmSz4odsNhTlWXwlWL7A

Been going here quite a few times even before they had the happy hour menu. Every visit so far was great. Food is always on point! 

During happy hour I normally order my favs which are, salmon carpaccio, beef tataki, angus sliders and truffle fries. 

Never a disappointment with each visit, that's how it should be. I only leave reviews after I've eaten to a restaurant quite a few times and SOHO is definitely one of those fav restaurant.

Their fish taste fresh as fresh! Lol amongst all though, I love the salmon carpaccio and amberjack with apple. 

Tip:
When you sit by the bar they give you little treats or surprises for you to try. Well at least when we sat by the bar for the 1st time, one of the chefs let us try 2 complimentary dishes! Wonderful!

And this restaurant is a true epitome of a restaurant that knows what they are doing. Me and my wife try all their happy hour menu and absolutely adore their miso black cod.

One thing you should know about me is that I absolutely love miso marinated black cod! Soho does an excellent version of this and you cannot beat the price! ($18)

Some of my faves: 
-Miso marinated black cod
-Yellowtail yuzu 
-Salmon w/ cream something
-Tuna tadas 
-Salmon tadas

These are just OK:
-Twin dragon roll - Alaskan crab, shrimp tempura. Sounds exciting. It wasn't all that jazz. I'm not really a ""roll"" type. ($15)
-Rock shrimp tempura - Comes with three sauces. Two of which are useless. Go with the banana sauce. Trust me. ($9)
-Nigerian prawn - This one of the specials. It was just a single, but large prawn. Hard to eat. Knife and fork style. Flavors weren't mind blowing either. Next!

Pinch me, I must be dreaming, maybe I am considering that I am writing this at 4 in the morning, but...there is happy hour from 4-6 PM? Where was my invite? *Ahem* $1 tadas? Dolla dolla bill y'all. I'm there.

FINALLY I get to cross off Soho from my bookmarked places. Got off work early on Friday and with no solid dinner plans, I told my husband I wanted to try Soho's HH. It lived up to the hype, the service and quality of food was top notch. Our server Julie was very knowledgeable, giving us the background of the place, its specialties and dishes and Chef John. Although I've read here on Yelp most of the info that she's given, it was very much appreciated that she took the time to go above and beyond. 

The dishes that we tried were deliciously satisfying and melt in your mouth goodness, it's nice to know you can go to a place and have 5 star quality without the price. We ordered all the tadas and of which I liked the tuna and octopus the most. The firecracker roll was a favorite as well but the star was definitely the yellow tail sashimi with yuzu soy that Chef John sent for us to try, it was so fresh and flavorful and melted like butter. I wanted to order more but I was stuffed and wanted to save room for dessert. We got the green tea tiramisu and green tea crème brulee, both heavenly but the crème brulee stole my heart. No doubt we will be back to try everything else on their menu. Kudos to Chef John and staff for doing such a great job!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,4,3,5,pAh7S2cpkth4jikzAjTYqg

Imagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined, pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.

Small selection of relatively fresh, everyday seafood.  The sushi, AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.

Two standout ""raw"" fish dishes, the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy, drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapeños and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.

Also noteworthy, the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde, salmon with pico de gallo, and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.

Nobuesque tempura (rock shrimp, king crab, assorted veg and shrimp), all not oily but over battered, masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso, yuzu aioli..

Finally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.

Friendly, off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.

It's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,28,25,4,iPW_O5tHBL4RTANIZYR24g

We came the second time and sadly will not be reuturning. We ordered the more expensive sashimi platter, and somehow we got less fish than the last time whe we ordered the less expensive platter. Not only the quantity of the fish, but the quality of the fish went down too even though we paid more this time. We got albacore on the more expensive sashimi platter, and honestly albacore is definitely not my favorite fish and I usually see albacore on standard combinations not special ones. Last time we ordered, we got salmon belly and ocean trout! How come with the more expensive one we got even less premium fishes? We had also ordered the salmon ceviche which tasted just okay even though last time I came the ceviche was my favorite part of the meal! And this is not the biggest deal, but I asked what the market price was for the sweet shrimp, and the server didn't know and gave me a random number, but it ended up being more expensive than he said and he never came to let us know he gave us incorrect information. The reason for the downfall in this updated review is mostly due to the disappointment of the sashimi platter, the food just tasting average, and the time I felt was not used wisely since I had such a high expectation.

I went with the Sashimi ($8.50 Lunch): which includes rice, miso and house salad. Fresh fish and good value during lunch!  There were about 8 pieces here, with great QUALITY fish to boot.

Eva tried the Salmon Teriyaki ($8.50 Lunch): Includes rice, miso and house salad. Good flavor and good value here!

The house salad was good!  Comes with the lunch specials, and I think a yuzu dressing if I remember correctly...ate up every bite!  The miso soup was just ok.

We supplemented our lunch with the Yellowtail Sashimi ($10): Tempura Jalapeno, Micro Cilantro, Garlic Oil & Yuzu Soy. This was very good, fresh, and tasted great with the slight citrus flavor from the yuzu. Recommended!

Also tried the Ocean Trout....outstanding! Had micro pop rocks for a fun consistency, and the yuzu soy really works well with this fatty / buttery fish. Highly recommended!!  I'd come back JUST for this dish!

We loved all the dishes that we ordered in the first round so much so that we ended up ordering three rounds of dishes!! If our stomachs could fit anymore food we probably would have ended up ordering at least one of everything on the menu.

What we loved about the food at Soho was that it was prepared well, not overly done with sauce and garnishes, and the most important part was that all the ingredients were fresh! 

Another reason why we liked this restaurant was because it's super low key and relaxed but the food is something you would expect on the Strip in a fancy overpriced restaurant! The restaurant itself is not super fancy either, it's located in a stripmall next to an ice cream/boba place (which is also really good too). The restaurant is nice and clean. We came during lunch, midweek so we were able to get a table without any wait. We even enjoyed their selection of music playing in the background, stuff you'd listen to while hanging with your friends on a weekend. 

All the staff was very nice and well versed in their menu. 

Here's what we enjoyed: *All sashimi was super fresh!
-Golden Ocean Trout sashimi: suggested by Julie, it was our first time trying this, which is pretty crazy because I love sashimi and feel like I've tried it all. This was awesome!
-The Hamachi appetizer: I'm usually not a big fan of Yuzu but it definitely was not overpowering in the sauce
-Fresh Scallops dish
-Crispy Broccoli: One of our favorite dishes, so simple but executed well. We had to order this twice because it didn't stand a chance the first time
-Miso bass: wish the portion was a bit larger because it was so good. We asked Julie beforehand and she let us know what to expect, that's why we ordered another dish. The fish was so tender and the miso was not overly sweet like some places can prepare it.
-Short Rib: also super tender, the meat came right off of the bone. 
-Dozen Fresh oysters: also prepared well, shucked nicely with a complimentary light drizzle of sauce on top

If we lived in the area we would definitely frequent this restaurant for sure. I had to give this place 5 stars because of it's overall value and quality.

Each time we went, we did enjoy their 'happy hour' sushi specials.  Each of us ordered three specials as well as some saki and we were able to be full and happy for under $25!   

The Decor is modern asian and really was nice.  It was clean and the staff looked happy to be there.  Once seated, our server explained the specials and we all ordered from that menu.  The items started coming out only after a few min.  They all don't come at the same time which was fine since we started to run out of space on the table!  

Everything was fresh and tasted great!  The presentation of each dish was also great.  It has to be one of the best sushi place I have ever been too.  I don't say that lightly either.  My fellow co workers also felt the same way.  

The server was so nice and asked who we were and our what were our names.  When we were done and walking out the door, the entire staff behind the sushi bar said good bye and thanked us for coming in!  The next two times we came back in, they greeted us by our names!  The service was the best.

The Angry Dragon Roll had Shrimp tempura and cucumber inside, eel, avocado, spicy mayonnaise and eel sauce on top. Another prefect amount of flavors and spice. 

For dessert, I had Mochi ice cream. If you do not know what that is, it is a small, round dessert ball consisting of a soft, pounded sticky rice cake on the outside and an ice cream filling on the inside.

The Kumamoto oysters were very fairly priced ($3 each!) and yummy as they should be. The service was great - attentive but not overbearing.  And that braised short rib... definitely drool-worthy.  Really really good.

For take-out, we ordered 4 of their lunch specials: salmon teriyaki, steak teriyaki, Soho loco and tonkatsu (each lunch special was under $9!). The steak teriyaki was definitely one of the best. Typically, the meat most restaurants use for the steak teriyaki tend to be tough/chewy/stringy, but Soho's was great. Could have cut through it with a spoon. My husband had the tonkatsu, which came with a curry sauce and he ate it, even though he's not normally a fan of curry. The Soho loco was.. different. Instead of brown gravy, it came with a unique sauce. But the meat, like the steak teriyaki, was very good.

A lot of the dishes are very similar to Nobu, but at this price point I was thrilled to see them ! $2 for sashimi tacos that go for $15+ at Nobu? Yes please! I adore Ocean trout and was pleased to see this as a sashimi offering (with pop rocks, which were really fun). I also loved the black cod lettuce wraps for only $8 (wow). 

The only slight let down was the twin dragon roll - it was large and lacked the refinement the rest of the food we ate had (the crunchy tuna roll on the other hand was a pleasant surprise!). 

Service was friendly and gave us a free sashimi platter to welcome us to the restaurant. I'll be back every time I come to Vegas !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,3,5,v64K4GAYL7gIcelh7pDrhw

I don't remember all of the things we got but the pics can do the talking! The yellowtail sashimi w/the gold edible flakes was the most memorable and prettiest dish there! There was an older couple next to us who ordered the omakase (sp?) and we thought the gold flakes on some of the nigiri pieces looked so pretty with how they presented the dish!

First time: excellent service with gratuitous additions of sashimi to sample. 

Second time: overall fine, but we had that questionable experience where one sashimi dish is super cold and the other is warm. It makes you hope the fish wasn't cooled to mask poor flavors/quality. 

Third time: good food, but horrible location. The tiny bistro table near the front door is 1) too small to enjoy food and 2) too close to the door when there is inclement weather - and such was our night.

In the end, the sashimi here is delicious and the combinations of flavors are impressive. I could eat ""yellowtail yuzu"" for the rest of my life; ponzu and cilantro are brilliant together. Another favorite: the ""salmon wasabi creme fraiche.""",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,1,1,4,x9evS6PKoDmeNMFwNvkhhA

We were extremely disappointed with the sushi offerings on the strip - small, overpriced portions with questions on how fresh the fish was.  We had settled on this place in the Hotel/Casino we were staying at when I decided to check yelp one last time and found Soho Japanese Restaurant. Needless to say we walked out of the place and I'm happy we did.

Having the opportunity to travel the country due to work, I have had sushi in various major metro cities and SoHo Japanese Restaurant ranks in the Top 10!  I can't commend them enough on how good everything was. The service was fantastic, and the sushi was even better.  I can't remember the last time I had sushi and sashimi this fresh!

The portions and prices were right inline if not just awesome considering the quality, freshness, and presentation of everything.  Highly recommend the Yellow-tail Sashimi and the Twin Dragon Roll.

During our visit they had asked to re-seat us to accommodate a larger party.  Since the service up until then had been been great and we aren't jerks, we obliged to help them out.  Needless to say, we weren't expecting anything in return at all.  Not only did they bring out a nice bottle of Saki for us, they also gave us an additional Sashimi dish, both on the house.

Stand-up establishment!  Again, best service I've had in a long time.  Next time I am in Las Vegas and I spare time, I will definitely be back!

Extremely fresh, and decorated in a way to rival a $30+ platter at another establishment.  We actually ordered two (for a party of 3) among other dishes because the sashimi was THAT good.  It included tuna, salmon, yellowtail, squid,  and another I cannot recollect.  

Anyways, a breakdown of what we ordered (spending upwards $200 at the end of the night):

* Sashimi Platters - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#lRndlLck8p7kFRYKUOGLpg As previously mentioned.  BEST DEAL HERE.  Highly recommend.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, but the second time around the chef included salmon from Japan.  And yes the freshness and clarity of the fish was palpable.  

* Uni Trio - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#A-cEeA7g_oBrHePLhVYqHw  the BEST uni I've had in my life.  Tasted uni from Santa Barbara (my favorite, most creamy), Hokkaido (lighter in taste), and Santa Cruz.  Obsessed with uni now.  Highly recommend to order here.

* Black Miso Cod - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#mkLPaL6yBH25O4j9LBU_fA  Having been spoiled with the black miso cod at Nobu (OMG) this cod was still good but not the same, obviously.  This one was sweeter -- less flaky, but still delicious, nonetheless.  I'd order it again.  Good price as well.

* Tuna Box Sushi - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#B8cYzwavrjey4z4lYijV6g cripsy rice on the bottom, ebi on top, with tuna, avocado and cucumber in the center.  Delicious!  Love that cripsy rice.

*Angus Beef Gyoza - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#K4BF-OMDtLNtSE8AZDEBxg Came paired with a tangy orange fusion gyoza sauce; the meat tasted like pork and wasn't flavored enough.  Crispy gyoza skin however

* Edamame - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#jiZ3cajCe4KnyS-UNwLpUg For $3 this is a steal; though it is painfully typical the edamames were hot, fresh, crunchy, and perfectly salted.  Came paired with a dipping sauce as well

* Yellow Tail Tartare - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#TGhWeKEhDZEV_0anzOoK2Q BURSTING with flavor, it didn't even need wasabi.  Beautifully presented as well.  Craving it right now

* Tuna Tartare - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#VytauQePvWEGvPbMcLQ-wA  strong tuna taste with no negative connotation.  Spices blended well with the fish

* Blueberry Cheesecake with peanut butter brittle - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#5aTrN0Hc64-0aSaLG7UukA Unfortunately tasted like something you'd purchase at Costco (supersized, in that case).  I'd pass.

* Tiramisu - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soho-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#lJRio-aBk1Yhl5uH9fkVKQ so delicious; light, fluffy, fragrant, and strong chocolate tones that taste authentic and not chalky

Service is excellent, seating are is on the smaller side but you can always sit at the bar (which is what we did).  Definitely coming back!  A RARE 5-star review on my end!",4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw,1,1,5,myFKAkdX6sJdD0n3SYgW3A
5339806,2013-11-16,9,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I feel like I just started dating someone and I KNOW he's going to be my husband.. It's one thing to have great sushi. It's another to have great sushi down the street from your home... but it's another to have great sushi, down the street from your home, AND behind a Chevron gas station. Think Lotus of Siam in proximity to the Green Door.

I read the reviews of my trusted yelpers so yes, I was pretty confident I was going to have a great meal with great service. I didn't, however, expect to have my tastebuds orgasm from my first bite to the last sliver of dessert. I love great sushi but I've become lazy in my years. It's easier to train my palate to accept good AYCE sushi then train my wallet for the $$$ and gas to drive 10 miles for top quality cuts of fish. So after just one amazing dinner at Soho, I'm beyond thrilled that Strip Sushi at Local prices now truly exists.

I started out with the Yellowtail sashimi - with tempura jalapeno, micro cilantros, garlic oil, and yuzu soy - I was told this was a chef signature dish.
WOW really sums it up. I would have paid at leasst 20 dollars for that plate but it was only 10. Next up was a salmon tostada, rock shrimp tempura, and the tuna box sushi roll. The tostada was delicious... at 3 bucks a pop - I know that I could order like 5 of those things and be deliriously happy with myself. The taro tostada was light (be careful it may break) but just perfect and the avocado cream and cilantro sauce mixed with the freshest salmon I've had in a long while --- all of this adds up to Ahhhhh-mazing. The box sushi was just the cutest. Oh, and it had the perfect combination of textures and flavors.  The little crunchy rice cracker balls on the bottom combined with just the right amount of rice, tuna sushi, avocado and topped with a layer of shrimp. It's mouthwatering just to write about again.

Do you have a non-fish eating loved one in your life like I do? Well, the jidori chicken is ""the best chicken dish I've ever had"" says my non-fish eating husband. He is going to try the spare ribs next -- I'm so glad that the non-sushi items are just as good because that is the dealmaker in this household.

Soho's service is top notch. The chef owner John Chien Lee is just a delight to talk to. His visit to our table really added a nice touch to one of my most memorable meals.

If you love sushi, if you love strip sushi, if you love all you can eat sushi, if you love sushi but haven't been able to afford Kabuto, Nobu, Kumi, Koi, Okada, Yonaka, or Sushi Roku ----- whatever part of town you are in --- put this on your list of MUST-TRYs.... You won't be disappointed. You will have a great experience that you'll tell your family, friends, coworkers, fellow yelpers, and just anyone who will listen.

If I wasn't married,  or if you actually could marry a sushi restaurant, I would be married to Soho with children by now...it's that good.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,6,5,5,MTt971V0VU4wol9CO5aFBw
5349085,2014-11-15,5,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I've been here a couple of times and it was all during their happy hour except for the one time, we had it during lunch. You know what that means?! This review is solely based on those times! Happy hour is everyday from 4-6 pm and for lunch, they have pretty good specials available. 

First and foremost, I do suggest sitting at the bar. I normally prefer sitting at tables but the bar at Soho is amazingly spacious. It was perfect. I'm not elbow to elbow with some random ass creeping stranger :P! 

I've had their salmon avocado roll, firecracker roll, some appetizers, and their tadas. Their tadas are quite interesting cause it's a fusion mix of flavors on top of crispy rice and they're $1 each during happy hour so you can potentially try them all. The fish on those aren't particularly that great. Sometimes, they're actually mushy ...So they're nothing really all that special tbh but fun to try.

They put a good amount of salmon in their salmon avocado roll, which surprises me. It's so simple yet so delicious. I mean, for like $4, I'll take it! The firecracker roll has a really nice blend of flavors ranging from a little sweet, a little creamy, and a little spicy. One of the most memorable moments was when we ordered one of the rolls and we requested it to be spicy, the chef gave us some of his house made ghost chili sauce. I LOVE spicy foods and boy did this sauce hit the spot. Just a tiny dab with the chopstick is all I need to set my tongue on fire....it burns so good and so delicious. Try it if you dare ;) I swear...ghost chili is sweet. 

Another favorite is their black miso cod in lettuce. It's pretty good except sometimes, I feel that their cod gets a little overcooked...still good nonetheless.

5361256,2014-03-26,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"**Summary**
       - Specialty - Their specialty is sashimi with different sauces on top. Each plate is around 10 dollars and has 6 slice of fish. They are a bit more inventive than your normal sashimi dishes.
       - Decor - The outside is in a strip mall that's not too great to look at. Inside however, it looks like a trendy hot spot, much like the soho part of it's name suggests.
       - Price - The price will set you back a bit and the portions are tiny, but this place is more for the experience and tasting new things.
**Ordered**
       - $18 Miso Marinated Black Cod - Easily the best piece of cooked fish I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of miso sweetness.
       - $12 Chicken Salad - Chicken was grilled pretty well. Moist inside with a grilled outside.
       - $10 Yellowtail Sashimi - I love their twist of making the jalapenos tempura style. 
       - $11 Seared Tuna Special - The ponzu sauce was complimented very well with the slight sweetness of the onion & the sweet green sauce.
       - $11 Ocean Trout - By far my favorite. It tasted like really fresh salmon. When you put it in your mouth, the pop rocks, yes, pop rocks start popping and it's a very different experience. The sweetness of the candy works with the freshness of the fish to produce a very different and delicious experience.

5362089,2014-09-04,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"So excited to find this place. The positive reviews are spot on; thank you Yelpers.

Top quality, fresh fish with sashimi platters to rival the best. Looking for the classic Nobu style dishes (like yellowtail  jalapeño, miso cod, etc.) for literally less than half the price as well as dishes with a unique twist. The trout sashimi with all sorts of goodness including a sprinkling of poprocks was fantastic.

The Chef-Owner made the rounds chatting with folks. When he came to our table he spoke with such passion it's no wonder the food is so amazing. We even learned something new from him. He shared that mackerel (Saba) mate in the summer, so by nature their fat and nutrients are stored and used for biological purposes. Which by default makes them  less flavorful. He indicated he will be bringing in Japanese Saba come fall when mating season is over. Who knew?


Decor wise expect your typical trip mall restaurant, but the friendly, attentive staff and amazing food make this spot worth visiting on a regular basis. We will be back; likely once a week.

We ate and drank like kings (including alcohol) for ~$70 for two people.",8i1Tzvy_B660ffvaDAmiYA,1,0,5,O9x_uhDzZJtISJqdR-cUNA

If you have ever eaten at Tao at the Venetian, not the nightclub but the restaurant side, and ordered their omakase wishing you could get the same quality for half the price, I bring you SoHo!!!! As a sushi guru, I worship fish, not just the taste but the presentation and experience. Upon trying SoHo I was nothing but surprised and astounded by the quality, friendliness and overall satisfaction. The fish is the freshest I've tasted short of the finest on the strip and selection is to die for. This place will rival and destroy any sushi restaurant you know. Also a cool tip, the owner gets his fish shipped from Japan so I've heard.

Also, they have a great lunch special menu which ends at 4pm. Whatever you decide to choose, it comes with rice, soup, and salad. The portions are perfect. You can still order off of the dinner menu during lunch, but all in all, the quality and taste of the food is satisfying. For dessert, I recommend trying the green tea tiramisu. It is to die for!!!! Just some quick tips, if you're a sashimi lover, you will just taste the freshness and high quality of the fish. If you're a California roll lover, they use real crab instead of imitation crab.

The whole staff is awesome. The owner, John, is super friendly and welcoming. Every time that I've gone to Soho, he comes up to the table to ask how everything is. You can tell he's very passionate with what he does and wants to make sure that you're having a good experience.",_tjEaaTXE4M0Z7uK8Y11cw,2,2,5,JdXxeCBcw5fMMUbDMRpEbQ

5401096,2016-12-08,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"I would actually give this review 4 1/2 stars. What gives this such a stellar review is, to begin with, the excellent service that we received when we went in. The tables were full and we were given the option to order drinks while waiting. When the table was ready, we were served quickly and the staff is very friendly.
The last time that I came here, quite a while back, I was somewhat disappointed with what we ordered. At that time, the sushi that was being ordered was not that impressive to me. I can say that that has completely changed. We started out with the yellowtail sashimi appetizer, in ponzu sauce, that was delicious. The Shishito peppers were good but quite spicy. We ordered the Seabass appetizer in lettuce wraps which was absolutely delicious and we also ordered the vegetable tempura platter. This, without a doubt, is the best tempura I have ever had. It was perfect without being overly greasy. We then ordered the rainbow roll which was delicious and I would recommend it any day. We also ordered a twin dragon roll that looked interesting on paper, having shrimp tempura with spicy tuna and a combination of a California roll all in one. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was the most popular roll ordered. This is why I did not give this review five stars. I found the role to be quite distasteful and it was not pleasant at all. My friend agreed. I would not recommend this role to anyone. How it is the most popular role is beyond me.
For dessert, we tried the green tea crème brûlée which was interesting.
The lychee sake was amazing! This is an absolute must for anyone that likes lychee.
The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. I would not hesitate to go back but, likely next time, I most certainly will not be ordering the twin dragon roll or the Shishito peppers which I found way too spicy.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,2,0,4,YY3Yyc6o4FqtihV2TjwvnQ

We are from the Boston area and were in Vegas for a quick lay over and sought out sushi for the 1 night in town. Based on Yelp reviews we ventured out of the strip area and sat at the sushi bar at Soho. It was by far the BEST experience and sushi we have had in a very longtime. We were immediately greeted by many of the sushi chefs behind the bar. Their welcoming and obvious banter and laughs while they were working hard to keep up with the demand of the full house was infectious. Obviously the owner treats his staff with respect and it shows in the love they have in what they do, working right beside him.   We ordered a couple of rolls and Toro sushi which all blew us away. While chatting with one of the chefs he inquired what we were particularly fond of and moments after informing him that we both like spicy/jalepeno, raw fish type entrees and rolls we were presented with the most delicious complimentary hamachi that had been soaked in a garlic, with what tasted like a hot spicy sesame oil...delicious.

I had made reservations for my fiancé and I earlier in the day, which was a good idea because this place gets packed fast. We were seated right away upon arriving, and the vibes were friendly and casual.

Service was a bit slow but good. Our server was nice and checked on us often. He took our drink orders right away and gave us a lot of time to look at the menu.

We ordered the following: Carpaccio; Golden Ocean Trout and Salmon with Avocado Creme, Premium Sashimi Platter, Kumamoto Oysters with Uni and Ikura (not on the menu), Multiple Nigiri Pieces, Braised Short Ribs, and Hamachi Kama (not on the menu).

The Golden Ocean Trout was the best Carpaccio style sashimi I have ever had in my life. The way they prepared it was just incredible. The flavors and mouthfeel was out of this world, this is a must order! The Salmon with Avocado Creme was good too, very fresh. 

The nigiri pieces and sashimi here were generously portioned and very fresh. A few of my Maguro were a little chewy but other then that everything was good.

The Kama was excellent. Buttery, tender and juicy. It was just cooked and flavored so well, some of the best we've ever had. We were so excited to eat it we didn't even take a picture! The Kumamoto oysters with Uni was good, not the best I've ever had but definitely delicious still. The short ribs had good flavor but were quite dry.

Overall we had a great time here. The service was a little slow but they always made sure we had what we needed and they were very nice.

Quick and easygoing service, great happy hour prices (Mon-Sat 4-6pm) and great food. We had the Soho Maki, Salmon Avocado Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Firecracker Roll, and the Baked Mussels. Everything was perfect. 

The Soho Maki is like a long and thin eggroll, $3 for 3 of them. They also come with a very delicious sweet chili sauce. 

The Salmon Avocado Roll was pretty good, also goes great with the sweet chili sauce from the Soho Maki, but I personally think there was a bit too much avocado in it and it made it just a bit greasier than it should be, but it was still great. 

The Spicy Tuna Roll was good, really no complaints, I love how spicy it was, not too spicy, but just right.

Now, the Firecracker Roll. What can I say, amazing presentation and the flavors just explode in your mouth. I loved it and it was definately worth the Happy Hour price (not that the others aren't worth it). 

Finally, the Baked Mussels. I hadn't had mussles in at least 9 years, and Soho really delivered. They were delicious and cooked perfectly. 

Also, the owner came up to us during the meal and introduced himself, and at the end of the meal we got a free dessert (I dont know what it's called, like icecream wrapped in dough, delicious). And he also gave my little brother (6) a chop-sticks helper thingy. Very friendly owner, and he is an excellent chef.

The happy hour items are $1-5, pretty much a steal for the quality of food you are receiving.  They have $1 salmon, hamachi, tuna, and tako tostadas.  The only one I didn't try was the tako, the other three were delicious in flavor and the fish was extremely fresh.  The hydro bib black cod is essentially miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The miso cod is buttery smooth in texture and the flavoring is a good salty sweet combination.  The stuffed mushrooms are fried little balls of delight with an aioli dipping sauce.  I could have eaten 3 orders of these little mushrooms.  All the rolls and the baked mussels are your normal fare at most sushi restaurants, so if you want something different I would order the other items on the HH menu.  I did like that the spicy tuna roll, since it had more of a spicy kick to it, rather than being overwhelmed with mayonnaise.  Another favorite was the cajun albacore sashimi, incredibly fresh fish and quite a large portion given the price.  We also tried the ika geso, which is essentially squid karaage with a great aioli dipping sauce.  We also ordered the sashimi platter which was a generous portion for $25 and all of the items were extremely fresh.  The chef did pop over to see if it was our first time and even sent out a complimentary dish of yellowtail yuzu and a fresh uni portion.

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the ""Seared Tuna Special"" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out of the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.

Unfortunately Soho is around the corner from where I live and the first time I went there was when I was exhausted from working 12-hours straight. They were also almost closed as it was late. 

I was so tired that I just told my waitress Mika to give me anything. I received a cooked Hamachi shoulder part I believe for a mere under $20. Oh Boy! the taste and flavor was out of this world and I just realized I have not even tried any sushi yet.

Next trip I came in during happy hour on a weekday and though it's not even 5pm yet. Had to wait 10-minutes and decided to just eat by the counter. My big mistake was I didn't eat breakfast, nor lunch today as I was over working again. We ordered everything on the happy hour menu and not a single one disappointed. I asked the sushi chef what was good and affordable. He made us a sashimi platter to die for but unfortunately I was too hungry that I forgot to take a picture!

The first times, they screwed up the soup.  Had to send it back it was extremely salty.  Second try, the hamachi was under cooked. Rice was undercooked on my third try.  

After third visit, I finally concluded, I don't like the rice.  If it says SOHO Asian restaurant, I would not expect sushi rice to be served.  

I find the rice undercook during all visit for my taste, then I found out from the server that they don't use Japanese rice at all.

We missed happy hour by 55 minutes. Agh! The HH and lunch specials looked decent and I may come back to try them but this review is for dinner only.

We were stuck in the back corner by the register. Waitress told us about the menu, how we should order something from each page rather than just order rolls so that we don't end up hungry after an hour. I thought that was super bizarre to mention that their rolls aren't adequate for a meal. 

Tom ordered a bowl of Miso ($2) and gyoza ($5) and we picked three rolls: Spicy Tuna ($6), Spicy Salmon ($6) and Soft Shelled Crab ($9). Our waitress told us that we should really order the spicy soft shelled crab ($14) instead beacuse it was her favorite and the rolls that we ordered we could ""get anywhere."" Again, I found this really off putting and we decided against getting the spicy crab as it was a $5 difference than the roll we ordered.

Miso came out, then gyoza. Do not waste your time on the gyoza. $5 for 5 potstickers that have zero flavor. They might as well be from Costco (but Costco's do have some flavor.) Serious waste of money.

Spicy Salmon and Spicy Tuna were not spicy and without the eel sauce that Tom asked for, were bland. The sushi rice was devoid of any flavor which I also found odd. The soft shelled crab roll was great and I'm glad we tried that one. 

While we were eating, other staff were trying to tidy up around us which was uncomfortable. I don't want people straightening menus at the table I'm seated at while I'm in the middle of eating or sweeping.

Between the two of us, we threw down $15 a piece before tip. Meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I'd skip dinner and just check out the lunch in the future.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,2,3,A86J8yNEyPORisRFmXD6uA
5659559,2014-03-10,0,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"Came here spontaneously (seriously, we just apparated...didn't even drive) for lunch! I've seen many good reviews and enticing photos on yelp regarding their lunch setos (only $8.50!!!!) so decided to finally try it out. SO WORTH IT.

Service was friendly and casual with smiles from the attentive employees all around. Atmosphere/decor was modern and casual with a lot of open space. Very clean. The kitchen area is half open for customers to see and from what I could tell, there were so many employees. Maybe they're preparing for when it hopefully gets busier in the near future!

Now let me tell you about the food. It looked exactly like all the yelp pictures I had perused, which is quite a testament to how consistent they are, especially for a newer establishment. My boyfriend got the chicken katsu seto and I got the sashimi seto. The side salad had fresh greens and the perfect amount of dressing. The miso was standard and always a welcome addition. There was a side of thinly sliced cucumber in some vinegar-type sauce as well, which I definitely enjoyed. 

My favorite of course, was the sashimi itself. It came with 7 thick slices - two salmon, two tuna, two yellowtail, and one snapper. All were succulent and so so fresh, probably one of the freshest I've had in Vegas.

They provided my boyfriend with this house hot sauce which was so good and addicting. I alternated dipping my sashimi between that and the soy sauce! The little itty bitty mug of green tea was adorable and perfect for my tiny hands - normal mugs are way too large. I appreciated this detail immensely.

The icing on top of the cake was that the owner/chef himself came to check up on us and offered us a complimentary dish - this popular yellowtail sashimi with micro cilantro, fried jalapeno, and some kind of ponzu sauce. It melted in my mouth, not gonna lie. We later found out that the dish amounted to $12.

So why give this place 4/5 instead of 5/5? Am I just being a hardass? The only reason I loved this place was because of the lunch set value and quality and the comped dish, which I'm pretty sure doesn't happen all the time. Looking through the menu items, they seem to be quite pricey, so I want to come back and try them before really deciding that it's worth it.

We had to make some requests for changes on our rolls (for a shellfish allergy) and they were less than accommodating, even bringing out one item which was entirely crab. Other requests for additions or changes were all around generally ignored and you will probably have to walk outside to the gas station next door to get your water refilled before a server happens to drop by and top you off. Definitely a cool ""hang out"" place for some, but it's social not satiable.",n07_7NVp-V-cHBABNhOX5A,0,0,2,oC1VAcPsTVabUC72jO7qRw
5725566,2014-06-20,2,A-uZAD4zP3rRxb44WUGV5w,"This is my first attempt at writing a yelp review so please bear with me! 

I don't have an explanation as to why I haven't been to SoHo sooner, being that I only live about 10 minutes away and have had multiple friends say with conviction that they won't hang out with me until I do. I'm also a huge sushi/sashimi/Japanese cuisine fanatic so I'm almost glad there was an hour and a half wait at Goyemon (my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant), which factored in my decision to try out SoHo instead. When we arrived on a Saturday evening around 6:30PM, they told us the wait would be about 45 minutes but 30 minutes later, we were able to sit at the sushi bar, which is where I prefer to sit anyway. So, ""Yay!"" for the actual wait time being shorter than the anticipated wait time. 

When you first pull up to SoHo, hidden by a gas station, you might think that you're just pulling up to an average sushi joint but they prove that looks can be deceiving. The venue isn't too large, but I think that's a positive for local, off-the-strip sushi restaurants. So don't judge this book by its cover!

After being seated at the bar, we were greeted by a very enthusiastic, outgoing server. After telling him my drink of choice is either good beer or whiskey, he recommended a light, sparkling cold sake. I was surprisingly happy with this suggestion since it wasn't too sweet and was very, VERY easy-drinking. Chef John, the executive chef and owner was behind the bar and that was a huge plus. You can tell he truly cares about his restaurant and his passion for this Japanese artwork is present throughout your dining experience. I heard that he used to be the Executive Chef of Social House at Crystals so I'm guessing that may have inspired the name, ""SoHo"". I could be wrong though so feel free to tell me if I am. 

If you're looking for AYCE, this isn't your spot, but worth the extra bucks for a la carte sushi. SoHo features fresh specialty fish like Striped jack with a mild flavor, but firmer, amazing texture, similar to amberjack or yellowtail. And they had the freshest uni I've seen in Vegas. I've tried uni (Sea Urchin) before and wasn't very fond but I'm assuming that's because I've never had properly prepared/fresh uni. When I had it at SoHo, I found a new must-have! If the uni looks like a firm tongue, that's when you know you've gotta try it! When you bite into it, it reminds me of biting into raw liver, as far as texture goes. Maybe, it's a ""Hawaii"" thing, but I LOVED it. Chef John also brought out the exceptional Hokkaido uni straight from Japan. It was life-changing and the presentation was strip-worthy. It made me kind of wish I was on a date rather than a friendly lunch with a girlfriend (Sorry Tiff :P). We also tried their Kumamoto oysters - real Kumamoto oysters. The shells were about the size of a dollar coin (random, but the only thing I could compare the size to) and were pretty deep with a nice, plump oyster. The texture was perfect and partnered with their light house-made mignonette, forcing the sweet flavor of the oyster to come out and say, ""Hi!"". Other must-haves are the yellowtail yuzu soy (I'm a yuzu-whore) and the truffle white fish (I'm also a truffle-whore). In total, our bill was about $100 for the two of us, which is awesome! They also included a complimentary little green tea latte hard candy for each of us, which is always a nice gesture, especially for whoo-girls or yay-girls (if you have one of these as your girlfriend, you know what I'm talking about). 

Stay classy Las Vegas & thanks for stopping by.",PjKQInHMkNLT1cnCwCVl4g,6,5,5,4ypMzGEhPa1b4O0Hjdil9Q

The owner will come around and engage with his guests usually. He'll recommend stuff and he made us a complimentary raw scallop dish. Everything tastes so fresh and nice :D. 

Try the uni with red snapper (forego the ponzu sauce). The salmon avocado roll is a personal favorite for me. ^^v Yums. 

The tostadas are $1 during happy hour so it's a good value. Speaking of which, 4-6pm is happy hour. I also liked the firecracker roll but beware non-spice-peeps, it's spicy! Flaming for me. :0b

Every single thing I've read and head is true. He place is just superb. The staff is super attentive and probably the happiest, most friendly staff at a restaurant I have ever come across. I ordered just about 4 dishes at the sushi bar. The first thing was the uni sampler of 2 different types (mind you I've never thought of uni as being something I'd like because of the texture and I use to step on those bastards when surfing in hawaii) both were very fresh, smooth, and tasty like I'd never expect by looking at it. The second was the Cajun albacore on happy hour that the server, who was very friendly and sweet, suggested and was very good, not too spicy, not over seasoned. Third I got the sashimi sampler of about 8-10 pieces and wow, the presentation was great, the fish was super fresh and he cuts were huge compared to other places. Third I ordered was dessert and my god the green tea tiramisu was recommended and highly appreciated! I was so full and yet I stayed to eat every last bite of what was obviously prepared with love and skill.

Depending on your timing you may have to wait, it's really popular with locals and tourists follow so try to get in early, especially when going as a group. 

One tip, if you're going for lunch, you can ask for the dinner menu to order the more interesting dishes. 

If I had to make a criticism, the ambiance needs help as it took over a restaurant and inherited the questionable decor. Also the arrangement of seating on the space can be improved, like the useless reception area could be replaced with a 4-top.

I see why now.

I came for lunch on a Saturday. The place is very unassuming and doesn't try to be hip or cool. There was no wait at 3PM, and it definitely doesn't feel like you're in Vegas, which is fine with me. The quality, presentation, and flavors of the food were quite another thing. The lunch boxes are a STEAL, and even the specialty rolls and sashimi are competitively priced, especially for what you are getting. We ordered the standard recommendations from other reviews and loved everything. The cherry on top is that Chef John is SUPER NICE. He literally does come to all the tables, say hi to everyone, and then offered you specials on the house after asking about your food preferences. I don't think the Tai and Uni he brought out for us was even on the menu, he just made it because Tai was fresh for the day, and we said we liked sashimi and uni. Wow. 

To get: Tadas, lunch sashimi, Scallop ume, Sunrise roll, anything that comes out of that kitchen really

Before we left, the Chef brought us another complimentary dish (we felt beyond special at this point), this time beef tartar. It was a thick cut of beef unlike any beef tartar I've tried, and it was expertly sauced and oh so yummy.

I (and my table of 6) am beyond impressed, and we would highly recommend all you weekend warriors (new word I learned!) from LA to drive your asses off strip and check out this place. 1000000x better than a buffet. You won't regret it.",W6iqpnFvnKUtQGY4kfHOaw,10,5,5,mzywCnzUzRh964cnFFzKsw

I rarely give five star rating especially on sushi category since its very rare that there are really good sushi restaurants and to top that off in the dessert hundreds of miles away from the ocean. Now im rating this on sushi, that means nigiri and sashimi not rolls. Lets begin to start this place is way out there in henderson i think but still worth the drive. The atmosphere is nothing special which worried me especially when my friends told me this is one of the best sushi spots in vegas?! The service here is spot on, as good as it can get, water topped off, knowledgable waiter and very friendly staff, mirror of a 5 star restaurant. Now to the good part the food

Starter
-Salmon and tuna tostada [MUST HAVE]

I don't know what else to say; wait for the best part all that food and more plus drinks $100 this place is a definite must try when in vegas, if you looking or craving sushi and want 5 star quality sushi at insanely cheap prices SOHO japanese restaurant is your one stop shop cant beat that and for that I will be back again and again",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,2,0,5,EvC-VdZwoUToLcjUtcntqQ

Wait was also SUPER long on a late Tuesday evening-about 45 minutes long. 

Upside: 

Hostess and waitress were both super and attentive and helpful and friendly and refilling my green iced tea and making convo so that was nice.

Food was good and fresh, just slow. Long wait for everything. After waiting so long to be seated and then waiting so much more for each course/roll order, it was just a very long dinner experience. 

We tried their most popular rolls-see pics and the sashimi. We also had the shrimp and veggie tempura, the edamame and the miso soup and that was all very standard/average.

The one thing I didn't like: we told the waitress we were celebrating a birthday and she didn't do anything for us but the table next to us had singing and the works. Kinda bummed me out at the end.

A tip is to try everything on the happy hour menu! It's affordable, so pace yourself over several trips. I would have given 5 stars, but there rolls are a distant second to the rest of the lunch and dinner menus. A true sushi restaurant should master rolls, sashimi, and nigiri.

This is my first updated review cause they really deserve a re-rating. 

We ordered several kinds of carpaccio, sashimi, and rolls (diablo was delish). All were excellent and reasonably priced. The salmon kama was especially surprising, perfectly grilled, mouth watering, with a slightly sweet tangy glaze. The Pork belly was disapointingly small (2 skewers)and under-seasoned.

Waited a little long to be seated but, the place was packed and everyone was busy. So it was understandable. 

I had the Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll, Fire Cracker roll, Yellowtail Sashimi (which had deep friend jalapeños on top!), and Garlic Tuna Tataki. All of the fish was very fresh. But I think my favorite of all the dishes I tried were the tostadas, salmon, hamachi, and tuna. My favorite being the tuna but all bursting with flavor!

I'm from Alaska so I'm just a liiiiiiiiiittle snobby about seafood. The experience and food was great. The fusion take on dishes were creative and well executed. I became a fan and so I returned. My second experience was just as good and Chef John even went the extra mile and introduced me to uni for the first time--on the house mind you!  It was soft buttery and sweet as people always had told me uni was supposed to be.  And then it went downhill from there. Couple more times I've tried to come back and either the wait was long or the host was extremely unorganized. Sometimes both. It's not good if both I and the employees are flustered. But the food had never wavered. My boyfriend insisted on trying this place with me since I had always talked so highly of it. We came for dinner, calling ahead, and trusted Chef John with omakase. I'll give credit for presentation, but unfortunately, both mine and my boyfriend's palette wasn't agreeing with any of the selection. It wasn't anyone's fault but I was really hopeful. There was an array from mackerel, scallops to tuna, but we weren't digging any of the flavors. With a couple bottles of hot sake the bill came to around $140.

It looked like something had been sitting on top of it and squashed it down. Blech.

The rolls are really tasty though, like the Spicy SSC (yummm!). The sashimi plates are also all great and very unique, such as the one with uni. Our group had quite a bit so I can't remember all of them, but do check my pictures :) 

Lastly, we actually stayed til Happy Hour to try their popular items, and if you like black cod, then you will definitely like the Happy Hour black cod lettuce cup thing.

What probably was the most wonderful was seeing Chef John and Michelle again, and of course their entire team. I've been coming here for about two years now, every 6-8 months or so, and every time I'm greeted like family. What makes this place great, aside from the amazing food the Chef Tae puts out, is the warm and friendly service and how happy everyone seems to be when working there.

On to the food. Ask for live sweet shrimp! It's a little pricey ($9.00 per order) but they literally kill it in front of you (or at the sushi bar if you order at the table). How much fresher can you get? It's also my girlfriend's favorite, which was way more worth than the more expensive, less delicious versions they sell on the Strip. But for me, what stood out the most this time around was some type of salmon dish with pop rocks. It gave a very interesting texture and experience that you don't find in many restaurants. The fatty salmon sashimi was beyond delicious and my stay would not have been complete without my regular Macadamia Nut Dragon Roll and (recently added) Truffle Tempura Beans. Come for happy hour and order them, it's a super good deal and really nice to munch on in between raw dishes.

If you want a drunk, get the MIO Sparkling Sake, it's Michelle's favorite and goes really well with their specialty drinks. A special thank you to Sheila for always being wonderful and I'm so glad to meet Julie as well.

My only regret is not coming back hungrier as I did not have room to enjoy the Santa Barbara Uni or Oysters that I got last time. Well, I'll be back in a few short months, and I will not make that mistake again!",llv82wOgwY1UePkjhyNQ2w,2,2,5,ZGPZZ2bEi80-PhCnvFYimw

The Alaskan King Crab tempura was too greasy and had too much batter. The batter was just so overwhelming, I couldn't taste the crab! I had one piece and let my friend eat the rest.

We had 2 rolls that I can't recall.. but they were just ok.

The hamachi kama was also just ok. I felt it could've been grilled a bit longer, and I didn't like the dipping sauce. Normally, the sauce that comes on the side is just ponzu  but theirs tasted like something is added to it.

I loved that they gave me a little sushi pen at the end of my meal for a souvenir.  At least I hope I was supposed to take it.....",OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,1,0,5,UtT1fJuDO4A7r2C5qS2D1Q

The service was great and the waitress was very attentive. I like how she was able to have an input on our order. It really made the experience so much better. 

We got the tuna, salmon, & yellow tail toastadas which was yummy. 

The firecracker roll. I did not like the gingery top of it, but once I eliminated it the taste was better. 

The jalapeño poppers were just the right size and not overwhelming

The hydro Bibb black cod was okay. The cod was small and the lettuce took over the taste but from what I had tasted it seemed to taste good. 

Last the waitress suggested us to try the creme bruleé. This dish is hard to perfect as it's my favorite and I've tried this dessert at many sushi places before!",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,4,P4UwnFNZy443szECa7rdoA
