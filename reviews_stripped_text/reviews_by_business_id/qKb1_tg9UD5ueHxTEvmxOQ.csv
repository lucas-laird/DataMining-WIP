The daily seafood was lobster risotto and salmon. Its not 5 stars, but with real pieces of lobster it was well worth $19.
Server was nice but sucked. When asked what is ""this"" (pointing), he said sauce. When asked what kind of bread came with a sandwich, he said it changes. Nice Guy but probably stoned. By the way the restaurant is beautiful.",03NRSwsey4oLxQ6O0_pMrw,0,0,3,sLXQqbjqwt73TuvT_ppp_Q

The food is pretty forgettable, its not bad per say just nothing that wows you. The cobb salad is.... a cobb salad. The burger is a generic but good burger. Get my drift? No culinary delights, just decent tastes with decent portions.

I noticed that they recently dropped their prices, maybe in response to the feedback here. From memory I think the burger used to cost $15 and it is now $10 or so. They are also running a pretty serious happy hour, its like 3-9pm (dont quote me on that), probably trying to drum up some business.

The reason I always come here for business lunches is that it is always empty and the tables are comfy, making for easy conversation.",v5E6ALS5AajIVKEU07e2Eg,4,2,3,Hi8Wx3kp9XHRiTIdqBlbwg

The waiter gave it to us as the fish of the day, I should have asked the price, because when I got the check it was $19 (when most lunch entree's were $15) and it was a salad with 4 shrimp on it. REALLY!
Besides my lettuce was swimming in a very spicy (for me) vinaigrette dressing and the 10 slices of kalamata olives-how do they charge $19. That was a rip off. My girlfriend has the lobster hoagie, it was just ok.

The decor is nice. This place is huge with lots of seating and has a nice bar area with several flat screen TV's that don't distract from the overall atmosphere. The service was very good but I have to keep in mind that we were one of four tables in the whole place during what should have been a dinner rush on a Wed night.

The food was where the disappointment came into play. The menu made things sound much better than they actually were.  The salads are decent but nothing to get too excited about, the kobe beer sliders were dry with no 'fixings', fish tacos were pretty good just really small.  This biggest disappointment was the wonton nachos. The menu says is comes with sausage and brie. We asked for no sausage and it ended up being fried wontons with cheddar melted on top. When we inquired about the brie we were told that the sausage was in the brie and that is why we got cheddar. Ummm... maybe you should have told us that when we ordered?? Not at all what we were expecting.

Upon walking into the restaurant I found the decor and ambiance to be very nice.

UG has a very open feel to it.  The dining area is close to the bar.  Not so close that it interferes with the dining experience but close enough to observe and chat about it's goings on.

The menu is small.  Sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes not.  Good for this evening as it made for an easy decision.

From an appetizer the GF and I split some nachos made with wonton chips, brie cheese, sweet italian sausage.  It was pretty darn good.

I chose the buttermilk fried chick.  It was served with a brown mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes and carrots.

My GF had the salmon which looked dry but was very most and delicious.

For desert we split the bread pudding.

Unfortunately I didn't check the reviews on this ""restaurant"" before coming in.  It was a spur of the moment thing... went to go have dinner at BJs next door and noticed a flyer on Urban Grill saying they were broadcasting the Pacquiao-Bradley fight - for free!  Sold.  

We went in, were seated promptly and advised they were going to do a raffle for a pair of seats to the fight at MGM, only catch is you have to buy a $20 5-beer bucket.  Sold again.  We didn't win the raffle.  Anyways, our beer arrived in a bucket of ice, two were cold and the other three felt like they were baking in the sun.  Who gives out hot beer?  That's just wrong.  We nursed the two cold ones until the other three were bearable to drink, didn't have an option anyways because 30 minutes passed before the server arose from the deep.  

After ordering, our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time (not by the server) and for the next 90 minutes our server was MIA.  The server decided to briefly stop by and see how things were, then disappeared for another 60 minutes.  

The saving grace here was the food, which was good.  Not unbelievable, but pretty good.  We were entertained by the fight during this time so that kept us preoccupied from the absence of the server.  

We absolutely will never visit this place again.  Obviously there's something wrong here that no one is addressing, and that's unfortunate because there is so much potential.",Z05O_EuzbHwXgPcs77hH8Q,3,1,2,Z7K3rR_KngGQ6_Ws1Wvk7g

The ribs were chewy, overcooked and tasteless. My daughter ate the pulled pork sandwich but has had better at a ball park.

There is a beautiful red sculpture in the middle of the dinning room that I really liked. The booths are comfortable with good spacing. You're not sitting on top of the people next to you. They also have a patio that looked nice and an outdoor fireplace. I would sit outside on my next visit except I won't be going back.

The food was less than awesome. The soup of the day was a really good cream of mushroom. Good consistency, great flavor. The salad was iceberg lettuce with a few cucumber slices and tomato wedges. Pretty standard house salad, decent vinaigrette. From there we split a lobster hoagie  with arugula and paprika remoulade and the pan seared Pacific salmon with wild mushroom risotto. I substituted asparagus for the french fries that come standard with all the burgers/sandwiches. When the plate arrived in front of me, there were only 3 short, fat stalks on my plate which is a shame because I really love veggies.The risotto was the only other item worth mentioning or maybe it's just that I really like mushrooms. Anyway, the risotto was good, but not good enough to make up for everything that the other food lacked.

The restrooms here are ridiculously small. The door to the stall opens inward so you literally have to step back between the toilet and the wall to pull the door back toward you. Seriously?

The boyfriend and I went there for drinks and a bite. The drinks were a bottled beer and house wine, so there's not much you can mess up there. But we ordered a few appetizers as our meal, and it was not good. At all. 

The bartender recommended the nachos. I saw that it had meat (bonus) and brie (double bonus). However, they came on wontons, which threw me off. I ordered them any way. The wontons tasted like old oil, and the meat and cheese mess on top didn't have consistency or a distinctive flavor. 

The second appetizer was a fried, wrapped asparagus with some sort of hawaiian pork in it. They were obviously fried in the same oil, and that was all I could taste. Old fryer oil.

The last appetizer, some sort of sweet and spicy chicken wings, were fried in...yep...you guessed it...the same oil. The sauce was decent, sweet with a little heat, but we couldn't get over the old oil taste.

There's nothing inherently ""wrong"" with this place, but there really isn't so much that is ""right"" either. You see, the staff are all extremely nice and attentive (expect your beverage to be filled at least 12 times) but the prices and the food quality kind of ruin the overall experience of dining here. Jorge and I ordered ""The Works"" burgers and Shewchuk ordered the Thai Beef salad. We were all satisfied with the portions, but there was much to be desired in the taste department. Shewchuk's salad looked, for lack of a better word, boring. Nothing was going on with the plate at all. It was literally iceberg lettuce with thick strips of steak layered on. The burgers were a weird combination of undercooked while also being charred and the ingredients just didn't flow well. The french fries matched the burger in that they were a little too crispy on the outside while being almost raw on the inside. The pickles were alright though.

The funny thing about dining at this restaurant is that we all felt like food critics afterward. I eat with these guys almost every day and we never sit around and discuss what we ate.

3647947,2011-09-07,2,qKb1_tg9UD5ueHxTEvmxOQ,"To piggyback off Ryan B's review, there's nothing specifically wrong with this place in theory, but the food leaves much to be desired. 

Ordered ""The Works"" burger, which is a cheesburger with lettuce, tomato, sauteed onions, mushrooms, aoili and, oh yeah, bacon. Sounds like a winner, and while there's nothing particularly awful with the burger, it simply doesn't stand out at all. It just tasted like ""food.""

I don't really like to over-think my burgers, but this one was simply so bland and average (crazy, when you consider the burger's ingredients) that it stood out in my mind all day.

By the way, I actually forgot about the bacon while writing this review-- how the heck do you forget about something as amazing as BACON!? Seriously, this burger was memorably forgetable.

The fries were relatively crisp on the outside, but a bit mushy and undercooked inside. Prices seem a bit high for the quantity when there are comporable lunch specials around town for a few bucks less.

The service is fantastic and the staff is very attentive, and the ambiance is pretty cool, though I wish they'd have a bit more variety on the sound system. The food just needs some work. Of course, this is a new restaurant, so I'd be happy to give it a second chance in a few months as they tweak their recipes a bit.",Zt1omWYQ9yOlbmwzNgE3Vw,2,0,2,_1JAE7Qj3-eN24-KZMjuLw

I decided to give it a chance because I drive by it everyday and have Republic's menu memorized :) I was awkwardly seated by a hostess that didn't seem sure of where I should sit and she asked me several times if my table was okay. The waitress came out immediately, gave us the specials and asked for our drink order. It took 15 minutes to get my glass of wine and another 20 on top of that to get my lackluster appetizer of (2) deep fried risotto balls that tasted a lot like burnt popcorn and one hockey puck sized crab cake that was tasty, however certainly not adequate for the price and delay. Our entrees arrived about an hour after we arrived. I ordered the shrimp scampi, as reccomended by the waitress, and was surprised that they would serve something so garlicy, cold and runny. The best thing on my plate was the garlic bread. My companion ordered the rib eye which, based on its appearance was actually a New York strip. His cut was mostly fat, overcooked and underseasoned. His sides were 3 large burnt asparagus and a soup bowl of fried potatoes. The entire time we were eating, something was obviously burning in the open kitchen. I couln't wait to leave.

The waitress was incredibly nice and helpful.  She assisted me in picking out a wine, since I hadn't tried any of the cabs listed and her choice was great.  She also suggested a cocktail for my friend, when he asked (also another big hit--it was a specialty cosmo).

For dinner, I ordered the blackened chicken.  The sandwich had a little kick to it, which made it very tasty.  The chicken was cooked great and the fries were very good as well.

My friend had the burger and he was very impressed.  His burger came with standard fries, but they allowed him to swap in the garlic fries which he enjoyed.

While we ate, there were two singers who were switching back and forth.  They both had great voices and contributed to a very pleasant atmosphere in the restaurant.

I am from Boston so I have had my share of Lobster Rolls!! It was VERY good. It was loaded with huge chunks of Lobster meat. I highly reccomend it.

They just started a Sunday Brunch which we happened to catch and they have some kinks to work out in getting organized for this, so for this review, I will say it was average.  

I ordered eggs over medium and they were well done, the steak was overcooked as well.  The hash browns, looked like mine I make at home (this is NOT a compliment).  For the food they serve and what we have had in the past at this place, I expected a LOT better then what we received.

Normally I would give this place 5 stars, but on this visit, 3 is pushing it.  Now, if they can get a better system in place for the Sunday Brunch and a better cook who does not over cook the food, then they will have a winning combination on Sunday's.

I will give this place some time and try the Sunday Brunch again as like I said before, we have been to this place a few times since reopening and we do like the food and the experiences we had in the past and I believe this does deserve another chance.  

Oh yes, if you like mimosa's and bloody mary's, during Sunday Brunch it is all you can drink for $10.00, so that alone should be an incentive to get you in if you like those drinks.  We would return and this is a place we would recommend so you can be the judge and jury to base your experience on return or not.

They just opened a few weeks ago so it was quiet inside only two other tables. We started off with the Crispy asparagus roll($9). It was Kalua pork, cream cheese around the asparagus wrapped with a fried phylo dough side of lime and sambal...delicious. 
Next the chicken lettuce wraps($10). Not going to explain because it wasn't anything special, it was not good.
However my fried egg grilled cheese brought me back home to the islands, I think one of the chefs has to be from hawaii. Imagine mozzarella grilled cheese with tomato, sweetness of the bacon, ahhh and topped off with a perfectly cooked fried egg...yum, and only for $10.
My Bf got the shrimp caprese pasta ($14). I thought it was ok just needed a little more love in the dish, but hes a chef and was totally not having it. Needed salt, acidity, and yes love.

A few friends and I tried this place out for happy hour since none of us had ever eaten here before. First off, the waitress tells us that the bar is reserved for a bigger party and so she would seat us in the dining area where we would still be able to order from the happy hour menu. She comes back and places the happy hour menu on our table (because that's what we had asked for) she takes our drink orders and after bringing them out, she says that her shift is over so another waiter would be taking over. While he's taking our food order, we are reading and pointing to the items that we wanted off the happy hour menu. (we ordered two orders of the chicken wings and the nachos) He comes back with our food and we were all discussing how the proportions weren't too bad for the prices. Later when we get the check, we find that the waiter had charged us for the regular, non-happy hour, portions for everything, along with the drinks. When we tried to ask him about it, he said that we weren't seated in a designated happy hour area. A couple of my friends had to get up and find the manager..although the manager was pretty nice about it, the waiter was just rude and uncooperative. The rest of our party saw him hiding behind the wall, while our friends had to complain about the check. He never came back out after that. 

Overall, their food isn't bad but definitely not worth the price. And the main reason we won't be back there is because of the horrible service. Shady and not at all apologetic.",Q36qyXxLAkBFRfhij76CZQ,0,0,1,EkLDDUpAn7lwm2cOTLCquw
5586741,2011-06-27,0,qKb1_tg9UD5ueHxTEvmxOQ,"Met a girlfriend for an early lunch on a Friday afternoon (read: 11:30a).

The service and attention were great. At first it was because I was - literally - the first patron in the place, but over the course of the meal it was apparent our waitress had a head on her shoulders. The waitress, Paris, was knowledgeable, helpful, and very accommodating. She was accurate in her descriptions and spot on with her wine suggestion. She was frank when I asked about items on the menu (either because I needed to make a substitution or was curious about the creative wording; the carpaccio has shaved parmesan... it does not say that the beef is shaved). 

The cream of mushroom soup was really tasty and Paris's breakdown of it was perfect. It was exactly as she described and quite good. A definite high spot and, in a slightly larger portion, possibly a meal in and of itself. 

The ""Caesar"" salad was not a Caesar, being made from mostly iceberg lettuce with only a few romaine hearts thrown in and hard, stale parmesan shavings (I opted to have them remove the croutons ahead of time). The dressing was thin and bland. The fresh ground pepper was helpful, but it should be an augment... not a savior. I was told it was a ""new salad guy,"" but you don't need to be a salad guy to know the basics of a Caesar, especially in a professional restaurant environment. Salad fail; I sent it back.

The Twisted Nachos were lacking in both taste and ingredients. The brie was barely whispered into a weak cheese sauce and the meat portion was lacking. There was an odd disparity between the thin cheese sauce and sausage as heavier ingredients versus the brightness of the tomatoes (very fresh), black olives, and crisp pepperoncini. It *wanted* to be a tasty combination, it really did. The idea is there but something is missing. (Suggestion: use actual brie and complementary cheeses instead of the sauce. It's a start.)

The bright stars were the Thai chicken lettuce wraps, spicy and sweet and a great portion size. I only wished the chicken was chopped more; but the dish was fresh and bright and most delicious. 

The 2 pots of French press coffee we shared were fresh, aromatic, and done very well. Presentation was also done very well. 

---

I went back Sunday for a glass of wine during the farmer's market. Empty again, but the waitstaff was fabulous and the wine they helped us choose was perfect for what we said we wanted (i.e. flavor profile).

Will I go back to eat? Maybe for happy hour with friends. The food and drink prices are good and the wines they have (at least at the moment) chosen for their specials are ultimately happy-hour drinkable, even for those of us who like to be picky about our wine.

I was sick to my stomach the rest of the night and into the next morning.  The fried shrimp were the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a while.  They were battered and fried in old fry oil, so they absorbed a lot of brown grease.  Also for some reason they through in some non-battered zucchini and squash.  Right into the fryer!  Why?  They are very pourous vegetables and absorbed so much oil they weighed as much as silver dollars!  Bleccch.

Likewise their asparagus was awful.  Paired with some kind of meat (hello?!?!  Wrap it in cream cheese and pancetta?!?!?!) and there was no evidence of the promised cheese in there.  Then they were wrapped in some kind of dough and appeared to be thrown into the fryer.  Heavy heavy heavy.  Limp, grease-soaked asparagus.  Absolutely disgusting. 

We felt bad cuz the waitress was really nice and we were talking so much s### about the food every time she came around to the table.  We ordered a lot and ate almost none of it.  The sliders were okay.  (Enough with the sliders already.  Jfc.)  The tacos were meh at best.  The lobster roll was way too tarragon-y and came with gross frozen, battered Oreida-style fries.  Make fresh fries.  You're supposed to be a trendy restaurant.

No discernible change in the decor from the 2 previous tenants, both of which were ill-conceived ""grill"" concepts.

The music was weird 50's stuff piped through cheap, tinny speakers.

Sorry, Urban Grill.  I wanted to like you.  You're doing the no-longer-trendy updated junk food and comfort food thing which has played out in every other city but Vegas.  You're menu is strikingly similar to your neighbor, Republic, which also sucks.

I wanted to but I didn't.  In fact I hated you.  One extra star for the nice waitress.",xymN6nkSGPL4A2D3C2DuaQ,3,1,2,bZkwM6gHmPiIVkMi88UfxA
