All of the diners (including us) were singing along (loud, proud, and off-key) to the 80's & 90's music videos playing on the big screens. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food and drinks are worth way more than the price said everyone at the table. I only snacked there while my friends / family ate full meals. The following are items I sampled:

Daddy's Chip Plate - The salsa, guacamole, and queso were perfectly seasoned.

Daddy's Buffalo Wings - May I have these every Sunday?

Tortilla Soup - This is the only dish I was not a fan of. It wasn't bad. I just prefer my torilla soup on the thinner brothy side.

A delicious mango alcoholic beverage - Yum, Yum, and more Yum.",nvST5G7qEvVCf5v64Ll7Ww,0,0,5,267rQXXOjyYxyfJxbZcKoA

First off all they start with a homemade flour tortilla that is lightly grilled to perfection , they proceed to stuff it full with juicy marinated steak , mozzarella cheese , roasted anaheim salsa and then top it off with cilantro , it also comes with refried beans and Mexican rice . This Supreme Taco is very moist and sooooo amazing . It's definitely my favorite menu item . I've also had the Seasoned Ribeye , and OH MY GOD , it was perfectly seasoned and so tender that it melted in my mouth . They are not a steak house so I was surprised as to how delicious the Ribeye was . I'm going to say its one of the best I've ever had here in Las Vegas . 
The local vibe here is great and the service was perfectly on key . My drink is always kept full and the staff is very personable . You must come by and try this place out !!",lV1LSay-bxw4iYMCZ-QKYA,0,0,5,OKg6pEgCbv0y7cL7Eb8vBA

Food: margaritas were great. White peach is way better than the house original. 
The appetizer ordered was the extreme tostada nacho. They were great. Real tortilla chips. Ground beef. And cheese. Great cheese. And it comfortably fed four hungover people. (Big plus on that)
I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. The chorizo was mild and not what I find in a Mexican supermarket. 
My girlfriend ordered the green enchilada. She loved it. The sauce was the most notable. The refried beans however, should have came from a different can. The rice was good. A little crunchy but the enchiladas made her forget. 
The big day burrito was fucking good, said my friend. He ate it all. 
The big daddy bowl was excellent. 

My opinion, if you were raised in America with parents making Mexican food, you'll love it here; it's great Americanized Mexican food. If you're an immigrant, you might want to stick to the hole in the wall down the street.",Q9LWFcJ1GYf0Mt0HoClwpQ,0,0,4,_aP4ommH1baWNMY-68Yrvw

468596,2017-05-19,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,How disappointing all I can do is shake my head... we are huge fans of the Nacho Daddy location in Henderson they do an absolute amazing job and it's one of our favorite places. Therefore we thought going downtown it would be even better we were wrong. Let me preface this review by advising management not need contacting me to make the situation better as addressing my concerns should been done at the restaurant. Unfortunately we had Ryan as a server who tended more to the smaller brunette Hostess then his tables along with our table. We were unattended for so long when it was not even busy that we went to the bar to get a drink. Since we already had a table the bartender with the dreads assumed that I would not tip her because I was not sitting at the bar so I was giving an attitude about ordering a drink from her. Lucky for her I'm a decent human being and I understand that this is a service industry and tips need to be given as I was a bartender for four years. After convincing the bartender she can give me a separate check for the drink I went back to the table and watched Ryan from afar at the hostess stand. In the end I see there is a lack of management at the restaurants as if a manager was on the floor they would notice the lack of activity from their server. Training also needs to be established you should call the Henderson Property and see how they handle their staff then maybe you wouldn't get a review like this.,VmtrxQppfuZLQCi6pduV1Q,0,0,1,6NhrqdjepPBeK09Q7wkzJA

537857,2017-01-08,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"This was one of the biggest food let downs I've had in a while. I was really excited about trying their Nachos, expecting something unique that would set them apart from typical Nachos at any other bar/grille. 

They were certainly short handed, because we ordered our drinks and then after what seemed like forever, we had to find our server to make our order.

I ordered the Enchilada Nachos, my wife ordered the Vegan Nachos, my daughter ordered the chicken fingers. 

It was alright. I kept thinking that I could have done far better myself. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item, but my wife absolutely hated her Vegan Nachos. So I tasted one of hers and the cheese tasted horrible. She almost asked them to take it back, but we couldn't find our server for so long that she ended up forcing down half of it by the time he came back around and it didn't seem right.

My daughter's chicken fingers were very good! At least they got that right.

So, if you're looking for nachos that make you say, 'meh', get the Enchilada Nachos. If you are starving and long for cheese that tastes like melted plastic, get the Vegan Nachos.

But if for some reason you find yourself in this average restaurant and you aren't the 'risk-taking' type, ask for the kid's menu and order the chicken strips. They are called 'pull my finger'.",0nqAFV6--WRfhvKMG5ok7w,1,0,2,5khOj86kfKgylt9Jel79NQ

We were also in the mood to have some margaritas so we figured perfect! We ordered our fiesta nachos and the nacho burger nachos or something like that, both of which were super yummy. We had a super nice server named Luis who gave us great service and sold us on not getting individual margaritas. He said we'd be better getting the pitchers cause we could get 4-5 margaritas each for less price so we were like done! Took 2 pitches between 5 of us. When he came out pouring the first pitcher it only filled up 4 of them just over half way. He had to use some of the second pitcher to fill ours more but then stopped half way through the second he realized we were clearly being shorted. He left with the still half pitcher and came back with it filled back up. In the end we all only had 1-1.5 drinks each. One of my friends asked for a manger and explained to him the situation and just felt like we were a little shorted and we were really nice about letting him know. Honestly we probably could've gone without even mentioning it and leaving barely satisfied with the situation but we decided let's just let him know. The first thing out of his mouth when we explained to him he said so you only had 1 1/2 drinks each? That's hard to believe. Ok no big deal. We just elaborated and he seriously did not care AT ALL about it. He was like well I sent you out a whole new pitcher and we were like well you took the half filled pitcher back first and just filled it with ice. After the shortest discussion ever he literally said ok well have a good night. I work in a customer service industry as a manager and it's our job to, even if there's not much we can do, to make sure the customer is happy. I'm not exactly sure how he was trained as manager or if customer service is of ANY important to Nacho Daddy but that was my first experience with the company and it's left a sour taste in all of our mouths because of it. The managers name was Rob apparently and I can't express the extent of how he just could not be bothered with us and in no way were we ""those"" kind of customers. We just wanted to let him know and he gave two shits about it. I don't know if any of us will come back, who knows.

644052,2013-12-18,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"I went here a couple of weeks ago for lunch. We dined at the down town location. Cute name. Clearly marketing to the tourists as there is a bar that opens to the street. Medium sized dining area. What put me off almost immediately is when I went to the website lunch specials were listed. However, when I went there the waitress new nothing about it and asked the manager, the manager then came over and explained that the lunch specials were only for the Henderson location and not downtown. I will own up that it was my mistake upon review of the website again when you download the menu it states Henderson menu and when you scroll down to the very bottom then there is a cover sheet stating Las Vegas menu that does not list lunch specials. Nonetheless, this left a bad taste in my mouth. 

As to the food, a bit pricey in my opinion for what you get. I will admit that I am a nacho snob - I love nachos and if I am going to splurge they better be darn good. I like traditional nachos piled high with gooey cheese (love the nachos at Big Dog's) and avant-garde nachos such as the asian nachos at Grand Luxe. The nachos sounded good, we ordered the cheeseburger nachos and bbq pulled pork nachos. The queso sauce was smooth and creamy and the pulled pork was sweet although not great bbq but I didn't expect that from here.  Cheeseburger nachos, well, were like a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, ground beef etc. They were approximately $10 each. They were good but again nothing phenomenal and for the price not a whole lot there. I was full but had I been any hungrier would not have been. And I am pretty sure other people in the group were not full. There were three plates of nachos shared among four people. 

They had one of those new help yourself Coke machines with the different flavors. Overall I have mixed feelings about the Coke machine. You have to get your own drink which I am okay with but if there is anyone standing at the drink machine you may be in for a long wait as they ponder their drink selection.

And I have no idea what kind of beer was used since the waitress didn't ask me. The filet minon nachos were ok. Nuthin to write home about. The meat was not as tender as I had hoped. Crab & lobster street tacos were ok, they stuff more corn in it than the crab/lobster. But they were tasty.

Well, here's the specifics.  The margarita I ordered was not bad nor was it great, i.e., it was merely an average, ordinary margarita.  The grilled fish tacos were bland which constitutes neither bad nor great, i.e., they were average.  Finally, the beans and rice were as average as you would expect from a chain restaurant.  There was nothing distinctly favorable relative to the flavor of the margarita, the fish tacos, the beans, or the rice.  This place isn't bad.  This place isn't great.

819427,2015-07-24,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Let me start off with how AMAZING the shrimp nachos are, best part of the meal/experience

The staff? Bartenders, not so friendly, we felt ignore for majority of our experience. They got us drinks & our food order but then..
Nothing.. I work in restaurants, I hate when people have to flag me down.

We started with the amazing spicy shrimp nachos, hands down some of the best nachos I've ever had, piping hot & full of flavor 

Then.. We waited.. 

Ignored by the guy bartender while the girl bartender ate food in plain sight. I understand you have to eat but in front of customers?

We continued to wait.. With empty waters (we were having cocktails too) 

When we received our fajitas, they were cold. I shouldn't be able to touch the cast iron they're served on. I had to be that person to flag the one bartender down, not sure of his name, he had a small curly rat tail hairstyle. I told him they were cold, he looked surprised, they weren't sizzling like fajitas should be, so he took them back. They brought out what I assume we're the same fajitas just reheated somehow. They were ridiculously greasy & lackluster. 

The salsas served with the chips were delicious and spicy..


Highlights- shrimp nachos/chips & salsa

downfalls- bartenders, ignoring us/ cold fajitas

After 10 minutes, we were finally approached. We were told they are not accepting customers to be seated until 2:25pm because the ""kitchen was backed up"" and was trying to catch up on orders, however when we asked if we could sit at the bar, it was ok...Didn't really make sense but nonetheless, we found some seats available at the bar. I was already somewhat annoyed by waiting around but was so hungry at this point, I just wanted to order some food. There was only one bartender on staff at the time, and after another 7 minutes of waiting, the bartender apologized and said she'll be right with us. Nice gesture, however it would have been nice to have some menus to take advantage of the time we were waiting.

Finally, we got some menus, ordered some drinks (they have a free margarita with yelp check in) and ordered grilled wings and nachos for appetizers. The margarita was on the sweet side. Some of the wings were extra charred. I must admit, they do have several nacho options that all sounded great! We got the crab and lobster nachos. Flavors were there, but wish there was more to each bite. That being said, we would order this again. We ordered the baja seafood combo (fish taco and the lobster and crab enchilada with beans and rice), and the signature Taco-enchilada combo. Both of these dishes were extremely filling. Tortilla for the taco's were delicious and the enchilada was really good too.

Had a bloody Mary that was fine. Checked into Yelp and got a coupon for a free house margarita. There's a reason it's free. Lemonade would have been better. 

Smoked wings were tasty, but rubbery. They need to fry them after they are smoked to crisp them up. Breakfast slider, tacos and enchilada rancheros were good.

1409419,2017-04-01,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Came here on the night of St Patricks Day after going around Fremont for a while. When we had arrived around 12ish 1am, the hostess told us it was about a 45 minute wait for a table but seeing there was room at the bar, we sat at the bar immediately. As with most places in downtown, the establishment is kind of old and dirty and it being a bar, it was kinda dark too.

The bartender tended to us almost immediately after we sat down, giving us food menu and asked us for drinks. We had ordered some margaritas as well as use the check in offer for a free house margarita. We ordered 2 items of food to share as well. 

Supreme Tostada Nacho - seasoned ground beef, cheese blend, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapenos, lettuce, avocado lime salsita, sour cream & guacamole on top of house made corn chips - despite the price of the nachos, it is probably one of the better if not best nachos ive had. Granted i don't normally get nachos but with the few places i have, this is much better. Lots of toppings. Ground beef seasoned well. If anything, there was more toppings than chips. After the first initial chips, we started having to fish for chips. By the end, we asked for some forks to help eat. Lol 

Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cob - basted in seasoning, cojita cheese, cilantro, garlic mayo and fresh lime - small pieces of corn. Maybe 1/3 the size of a normal corn. 2 per order. Expected more. Flavor wise was pretty decent. Would have been nice to have more cheese. 

I personally ordered the Blood Orange Margarita whereas a friend ordered the White Peach version and another had the free House Margarita with yelp check in. Apparently mine was the strongest? but since i drank mine first, the other ones didn't taste much different. LOL except sweet :3 I'm a fan of blood orange drinks, be it alcohol or non-alcoholic (San Pellegrino). 

Service was pretty good. Got immediate attention as soon as we sat down. Got waters. Got drinks. Food came pretty fast. Pretty attentive staff. Not bad besides the location.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,1,3,ySFrM4kuEMJhfyyOFZ6zCQ

Turned out to be a good place to grab a solo lunch. I came in around 12:00 pm on a Monday and was just about the only customer in the place (save for the woman on her laptop at the bar, I really was it). Surprising, so I was instantly concerned the food must be bad. Or you'd need to be liquored up with a bunch of tequila to be happy here, which wasn't on the menu for me. Fortunately, the food did not disappoint but more on that in a moment. 

Let's talk 'bout yo daddy...

Nacho Daddy is larger inside than it appears from outside. There is a spacious wraparound bar and a separate dining area with plenty of seating. There is also outdoor seating with umbrellas, although they had to take them down while I was there due to excessive winds. 

Server Nicole was down to earth and cordial. She was training a new guy and he seemed to be catching on quick. The manager came over to say hello to me, his sole customer. : ) Nice touch. 

Oh and the food. I had the chicken taco and can honestly say, it was one of the best taco's I've ever had. They mix some kind of pesto sauce into the taco that complements it very well.  I commented upon this just before leaving and they weren't sure what it was, but were glad I liked it. Well now, I'm glad too. 

The manager's cool. The staff nice. The food excellent. The environment very comfortable. I'm not sure why it was empty both before I arrived and after I left. Maybe it's just a quiet Monday. I'll bet the place lights up at night. 

Definitely worth a visit if you're downtown. Lots of options on the menu. And if you like tequila, this is your place.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,1,0,4,cTBwyZGeSrOi1ExuviVK2g

Been here many times. The our last view was a real treat!
I had been craving a chimi for years and the sweet server said he would go back and ask if they could do a vegan one....of course they could! I ordered a bean and cheeze and avocado chimi :D I wish I took a pic of it it was soooo yummy and gooey and ridiculous :D I asked for black beans with mango salsa on top as my side. 

Anyway, this place will make you just about anything you want. I even requested the kale salad be put into a wrap before and yep they did it.

Service is slow sometimes but always pleasant. The owner is a sweetheart, glad he left what he was doing to open his Nacho Daddy's ;) 

We had a Yelp event at the one at Henderson and after that we tried Hendo location again after that....ummmm we are not a fan. 

We have had some yummy veggie fajitas here also (don't know if they are a menu item). You can't beat their nachos. I wish they had a cauliflower buffalo vegan nacho like I have made at home then I would truly be in heaven. My fav item is still the kale salad. It's that dressing, that grilled corn, delicious. 


That spicy tofu burrito is out of this world but wow it's freaking spicy I don't know how my bro in law nor my hubby eats that. They always inhale theirs.

I'm not a fan of adult drinks and hubby is allergic to tequila (in an oopma loompa turning orange type of way) so not really sure about their margs etc but my friend said her special tooty fruity marg was super yum and super strong.

Decided to give this place a try. It's hidden a little bit off of the Downtown Vegas path. Dark on the outside a little hard to tell where to enter. We found it and were greeted and quickly seated. It was busy, so the servers were running around trying to keep everyone happy. 

Got our drinks ordered, and asked our server for recommendations.  He told us to get one of Nacho choices and the 2 most expensive were their most popular ;). 

Thanks to checking in with Yelp I got a free margarita, although in retrospect, I think it was virgin, because it just tasted like mix, no scent or taste of liquor. 

The food arrived in the expected amount of time. I got the Enchilada (chicken) Nachos. The portion was big, more than enough for two people. All of my buddies also got big servings and soon we would all be full, and feel like adjusting our belts to a more forgiving notch. 

The service was good. Like most places in Vegas the restaurant itself had dark floors that were a little sticky. The food was good and plentiful. Considering bang for the buck and without a 30 minute wait on Presidents' Day weekend we were satisfied.

1625680,2016-04-19,1,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"After strolling around Fremont on a rainy day, we were ready to dry off and get a bite to eat. At the suggestion of our friend and local Las Vegas guide, we headed over to Nacho Daddy. I honestly think that had she not suggested it, I never would have noticed it. Not only is it off a side street near Fremont but it's also not flashy like many Vegas restaurants and we almost walked by it.

The inside is simple but what the restaurant lacks in decor, it seems to make up in quality of food. Everyone was pleased with their dishes, from quesadillas to burritos to nachos.

While I was tempted to order the nachos, I knew that I could never finish a plate of nachos on my own. It's too bad that they don't offer half orders of the nachos. Instead, I chose the chicken quesadilla. It was one of the best quesadillas that I've ever had. It was filled with gooey cheese and juicy shredded chicken and served with a side of sour cream, guacamole and pice de gallo. Had I not been on vacation, I would have been content to eat half and take the rest to go but instead I forced myself to finish the quesadilla and was pleasantly stuffed for quite awhile. 

Two of my friends shared the Fiesta Nacho and managed to clear the plate between the two of them. These nacho plates are definitely something to share with a friend though, unless you're a super heavy eater. Another friend ordered the vegan burrito and I was impressed that a Mexican restaurant offered several vegan options. 

Compared to places on the Strip, prices at Nacho Daddy are very reasonable. My quesadilla cost about $12 with tax and tip, which isn't much different than what I pay in San Diego. The nacho plates ranged from $7.50 for cheese nachos to $16ish for nachos with meat and lots of toppings.",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,9,4,4,Zlxsi-_Q4jp_izhJ4_nlRQ

Walking in on a Saturday evening we figured it would be busy.   There were seats open at the bar so we snagged them up.   I wish we didn't.  The service around the bar was absolutely horrid.  First off it took them ten minutes to acknowledge our existence to take our drink order. Since we already knew what we wanted to share, we put in our order right away before she left.  That was the last we saw of our original waitress.  45 minutes later our food comes out.  It was delivered by another waiter and he asked if we needed anything else.  I politely asked for hot sauce as well as our plates and napkins.   Did we see him again?  No.  Was our waitress in sight? No.  So we are sitting there with our drinks empty for the last 25 minutes without regular place settings to eat.  My friend actually went back to the kitchen to see if we could get any assistance. He got their attention.

As we started to eat our so called Nachos, it was abundantly clear they were inedible.  The flavor was way off.  The entire bottom of the plate was water.  I would like to refer to these plate of nachos as nacho soup.  As if those weren't bad enough, the fajita sandwich tasted as if it was made the day before and sitting under heat lamps.  Was I in the twilight zone?  I just want to also mention we did not see our waitress during this entire time.  

Eventually we were able to flag down another person to pay our bill.  We wanted to get out of there and never look back.  Just a disappointing experience.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,9,2,1,C4yX33_g_ZVmS1wG18ZN1Q

We also ordered 3 street tacos as an appetizer, I;m not sure how long those were sitting there, but it was a huge let down. Obviously, we left and felt bad about not paying for our water glasses. As we were walking out, the waiter had the nerve to say, ""thanks for coming in"". Thank's for not serving us.

This dish was made up of refried beans w tender and juicy chicken breast, jalapeños, sour cream,salsa(red or green) and crispy tortilla chips. Let me tell you, the green salsa had a spicy bold flavor that just seeped into every bite of this dish and made it ohhh sooo good!

A friend had the ground beef enchilada dinner with rice and beans and she had no complaints. Street tacos along with chips, salsa and hot queso were amongst other dishes at our table and all were equally delicious.

Liquor was good. Try the scorpion shot or the buttery nipple. You won't be dissapointed.

Me: Well, I found this place nearby that's dedicated to nachos. Y'all want some nachos?

Fam:  :-0   Uh, fuck YEAH!

Boom. Nachos for Christmas dinner. Not just any nachos, but damn good nachos. Nachos supreme, cheeseburger nachos, thai nachos, and vegan ""chicken"" nachos? Double-fuck-yeah!  

This spot is owned by a few former Zappos employees, and while it borders on cheesy (in the figurative sense), the (literal) cheesy goodness overcomes all of that business. The nachos here are seriously tasty. Each portion is sized for one very hungry man or two moderately hungry people not my size. Eminently shareable, these platters are a crowd pleaser. Easy to order a few different styles and throw down on a table full of goodness. 

They have numerous non-nacho options, like burritos and enchiladas and such, but why bother? Come here for the nachos. Or the surprisingly robust vegan menu. Usually vegan items are an after-thought, but any vegan would be very happy with the selection here. 

They have a check in offer for a free house marg with purchase of an entree, which is cool, but the main specialty marg is where it's at. They also have corny ""scorpion shots"" and merch so you can boast about eating a scorpion. But we didn't go there. 

5-star nachos, excellent service, fun atmosphere... if the whole thing weren't so cheese-ball this place would get a full 5-stars from me.

I had the nachos and a taco. Let's start with the nachos:

The only reason I cant give this place 5 stars is because there are a LOT of bare chips on the pile of nachos they bring you. In fact, when I received it I was quite surprised to discover how many NOT covered chips there were. They could have done away with about two thirds of the chips, but they basically use the chips as a way to present you with a pile high plate, even though the good stuff is not as plentiful as it could have been. Still delicious. Just not as ""Oh my God"" as I was lead to believe.

Now for the taco:
I had the barbacoa taco - Now this deserves the ""OH MY GOD!!"" It was DELICIOUS!! In fact, I wish I had ordered a couple more and NOT gotten the nachos. The meat was seasoned PERFECTLY!! And the tortilla was a thick one, that had been slightly grilled and delicious.

Literally everyone working walked around without a smile on their face. I'm not expecting a welcome choir when I come in, but at least look like you wanna do your job.
Our server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it.
Then Debbie comes to the table and without saying ""hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy"" or ""hey, how's it going"" or even ""hi"", she says ""what can I get for you?"" She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos.
She brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables.
And then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, ""she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now.""
Even if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.

I don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it.

I made a reservation two weeks prior for 20 people. I called that afternoon to confirm the reservation. (""yep, we have it, no problem!""). When we arrived, no one seemed to know what we were talking about! Luckily, they weren't super busy, so they were able to set something up for us, but that definitely put a sour taste in my mouth to start.

Secondly,  the menu is NOT the same as what is posted online (only the Henderson location  posts their menu). This was especially disappointing because I'd already planned out what I wanted, but lo and behold, it wasn't on their menu. The menu of the Downtown location is much more abbreviated. 

I ended up ordering the BBQ nachos, which were good, but the sauce was very strong, and there was a lot of cilantro. We also had chips & salsa. The chips were great, and the salsa very hot. 

I also had a Raspberry Margarita, which was super sweet! I like sweet drinks, but this was even too sweet for my taste.  

We also got an order of the s'mores nachos to share and sing Happy Birthday to me! They were okay. Just beware that the marshmallow sauce is REALLY sticky! Just passing it around the table, a girl got some of it stuck in her hair, and I know I got some  on my face and it was hard to get off!

The service was very friendly and casual, but I think they were a little strapped for servers (it looked like they might have only had 2 and 1 or 2 bartenders?), so they didn't come back to check on us and our needs too often.

However, the service leaves much to be desired...We sat at the bar and had chips, salsa, guac and margaritas. It took FOREVER for EVERYTHING!

The salsa was mediocre and the guac was underwhelmingly plain. The chips were actually pretty good. The margaritas were also mediocre. 
And then we had to go through this cycle again of trying to find someone to give us the check. We were going to pay with credit card, but it took so long that we ended up just paying with cash and leaving. 
Ambiance-wise, this seemed like a pretty mediocre Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican joint. Also, they had some interesting choices for their TVs surrounding the bars.

+ Killer mexican grub, great portions, delicious drinks, good atmosphere, great service
- Seating area can be a tad cramped, maybe a wait YMMV

Órale!!!  As if the name wasn't enough...this place is no joke.

Visiting LV and some friends and I were deciding on dinner.  Tossup between here and somewhere else. Glad we chose Nacho Daddy.

Service:
Seated promptly, served quickly.  Mark was our server and he was incredible.  Great recommendations on margarita flavors, food options, checked back often enough to make sure we had all we need but was never overbearing.

Food:
Food was great.  Friends had vegetarian nachos, a HUGE burrito that looked like a baby swaddled in a blanket smothered in sauce, and I opted for the street tacos.  Started with chips and queso.  Queso warmed at the table via candle and that was a nice touch as who the hell likes cold queso?  Other restaurants, step it up! I'm tired of slamming my chips and queso because you serve me lukewarm cheese that turns to Lake Placid before I'm even halfway through the chips.  Lock it up, ya'll!!

Portions, needless to say, were huge.  Street tacos were *la bomba*.  Nachos looked to be delicious and although the burrito was massive, my friend finished it, so plus on not having to lug a to-go box around.

Bevs:
Got two pitchers of margaritas, the mango and blood orange.  Both had equal portions of flavor and booze.  For sure thought we'd get shorted on the tequila, but after the first pitcher I knew that was a lie.

Overall this place is a huge win.  Will definitely make it point to come back next time I'm in LV.",0IdfzFwxhtQd0Trs5DWWSw,1,0,5,tsK96CjC2HGRDzj-ULumiA

And free drink they did. I got the house margarita with my check in offer and the vegan quesadilla. When I ordered I was surprised to hear a fellow next to me say, ""I'll have what she's having."" To which the bartender said, ""you know she got the vegan quesadilla right?"" 

*cue 30 minute conversation about every Netflix health documentary*

We both enjoyed our quesadillas and margaritas. As the drinks flowed, the less processed/fake it tasted. By my second strong margarita, I was convinced. 

Would I recommend making your farm-raised cheese loving grandma try the vegan food here? No, it's not that convincing.

I'm kind of wavering between 3 & 4 stars here, service was lacking, but the food was good. 

The place feels a little divided, with the bar & bar dining on the other side of the wall from a more open, ""brunchy"" feeling dining area. We sat away from the bar but I wish we hadn't, it was much livelier over there!

The menu offers tacos, burritos, chips, guac... I honestly didn't look over it too long because we found what we wanted right away. We split the guacamole, chicken street tacos and pork burrito. Everything was very tasty and reasonably priced.

Our server was a bit inattentive, forgetting things here and there, taking awhile on the drinks, etc. We weren't in a big hurry though so it wasn't a huge deal.

Classic tale of how bad service can ruin your entire experience.

I frequent the Nacho Daddy in the Henderson area, to the point where the servers pretty much know what I am having so I was eager to try the downtown location. I went in on a Saturday afternoon. The menu is completely different than the Henderson location, but they have an awesome happy hour and everything tasted good. I was with a party of four, and we decided to split our checks. I offered to pay for our appetizer, and didn't think too much when my check came in a little higher. When I got home later that night and cleaned by bag, I realized that I was charged for than double price for my entree. I called the next morning hoping that the problem could be corrected via phone. I was told that I had to physically go downtown, which is a hassle from Aliante. I asked for gas for the inconvenience. Anthony, the manager, proceeded to call me a liar among other things.. just completely unprofessional.

I was later allowed to come collect the difference. The server confirmed her mistake. The assistant manager was just as rude as Anthony, and not once did anyone offer an apology. 

I can say with great confidence, that I will never step foot in another Nacho Daddy. If you're in Henderson, check out Zabas or Chipotle nearby. Downtown there are plenty of substitutes that won't try to rip you off.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,6,2,1,QnDwgpfUCgnPbo6CC6_eog

Had our first lunch in Vegas here. It's about a 15min walk from our hotel the Monte Carlo. We ordered the enchilada nachos and the buffalo chicken nachos. Both very good, but the enchilada one was amazing. Consist of Green salsa with pulled chicken refried beans and of course cheese. We ate it so fast I didn't even take a picture. 
The buffalo nachos needed more queso blanco, I had to order a side of it because it felt like I was just eating chips covered in buffalo sauce. 
The strawberry margarita was very tasty. I def recommend.

We were greeted inside and it was a beautiful day out despite the wind so we opted for the patio seating.  He said no problem and immediately noticed the table needing to be wiped be cause of rain and dust in the air recently.  He quickly got a rag and took care of the issue with out us requesting.  
Good eye Ric.  

He took our drink order promptly and brought them out at the same pace.  We were not in a rush by any means but ussually we like to get service going quickly because of the kids and there short attention span.  Ric followed up for our order when he could. There was another group asking him what seemed like 1000 questions but like I said I understood the circumstances.  We were just enjoying the weather andthe kids were coloring because Ric was ontop of it and brought us the color pages and crayons.  

We began to inquire about food options at Nacho Daddy regarding portions and veggie options and he informed us they had an entire page dedicated to Vegan eating.  Sweet! Mom said.  This was our first meal of the day even though it was 5 in the afternoon.  So Ric quickly brought us a great bucket of chips, two salsas, and cheese dip like queso fundido type thing.  All were very good. Salsa tasted fresh and homemade with a little bit of heat.  Cheese dip was good also.

Mom went with the Black Bean Burger and could not decide between garlic or sweet potato fries, Ric quickly responded with I can split between both if you like.  Awesome job again my friend.  I went for the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos, which had very good flavor and a huge portion.  My one issue with this dish is that it tasted like the pork had been sitting in the hotwell all day so the meat was very tough and chewy.  My jaw bones seriously hurt after finishing this dish.  I am not one to complain but that issue did not stop me from killing the entire plate.  I give the dish a 3.5 star out of 5 because of the chewyness. Mom had no issues with her burger and fires she had no trouble crushing this dish either.  

Overall great first experience.  Ric made it 5 stars.  He is possibly one of the best in all of DTLV.  We had to speak to the manager to let her know about how great Ric was.  We will be back to visit Ric soon.  The food was also good enough to come back and explore the menu further.  Thanks for the good time.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,7,3,5,e7_u3jrHC_5OKTGQN7nitA

Dining options were rather slim when we were strolling between the Fremont Street Experience and the Mob Museum. We noticed too late that Tony Gemignani opened one of his pizzerias, Pizza Rock, smack in the middle of the area, and we were already in shock over the sight of the Heart Attack Grill where they let people weighing at least 350 lbs eat for free. We were grateful we didn't meet that threshold.

By comparison, Nacho Daddy seemed like a downright demure dining destination in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. It's really just as much a bar as it is a place to eat although the menu is pretty robust with not only nachos but also breakfasts, burgers, wraps and other Mexican dishes. Jamie W. was hungrier than I was and ordered the $13.50 Vegan Burrito, which was a flour tortilla stuffed mostly with wild rice with bits of Cajun-spiced tofu, black beans, vegan cheese, diced peppers and onions, mushrooms, fire-roasted corn, avocado salsita and pico de gallo (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZiHHn2).

It was quite a pile in there, but it wasn't overly flavorful for all the ingredients. I just went with the $9.95 Flour Quesadilla which was just a flour tortilla with mozzarella cheese melted inside accompanied by a mini-scoop of sour cream and pico de gallo (photo: http://bit.ly/1RZtC8F). It was alright though something I could have made on a dorm hot plate a hundred years ago. We noticed the place start to fill up with regulars mostly around the bar, but I have to give props to the manager whom I think was the one serving us since the younger server was keeping busy entertaining the bar patrons.

2737656,2018-04-10,7,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Sorry as this review is a little on the late side. We must of driven by Nacho Daddy a million of times from Downtown Fremont Street to the strip and never even thought about stopping in until one morning when we were looking for something to eat and turned to Yelp for suggestions.  At that time they were running a promotion for a free house margarita when you check in and bam that caught our eyes.  In a city where liquor prices are up there and to get a free margarita just for checking in???  We had to at least check in and get our free margarita. We found street parking right there on 4th Street. 

We walk in and this place looks like a legit Mexican biker bar straight out of the movies and we liked it. After getting seated we were looking through the menu and our waitress came to take our orders so we showed her our check in for margarita and she smiled like she never saw that before and told us that it will take a little while as they are short handed at the bar. Short handed was right.  Our waitress was also the bartender, server and bus person. So yes our drinks took awhile. But when they came, it came in these huge glasses so we thought that no way they could taste good but one sip and we knew it was worth the wait. It was one of the bigger and best tasting margaritas we ever tasted. While they don't have that promotion when you check in, you can go to their Yelp page and you can click the 1 free margarita to be sent to your phone.  Yes sometimes you have to work for what you want and trust me, it's worth the effort to get it. Hey it's free and good and huge.

On to the food. My nephew got the Breakfast Burrito ($10.95). You have a choice of sausage or bacon. Of course scrambled eggs, melted cheese, hash browns and ranchero sauce. It came with it's own house made chips and salsa.  He couldn't contain himself as he dug into this behemoth of a burrito. I asked him how did he like it?  All he could do was nod his head and give and give a thumbs up. 

My better half got their Steak Omelet ($13.95 +$2 for egg white) and was happy to hear that they could make it with all egg whites for an extra charge. The steak was a nicely marinated, with pico de Gallo and melted jack and cheddar cheese. It was came with salsa and hash browns. 

For myself and yes I shared, I got their Supreme Tostada Nachos ($17.50). A big pile of nachos that came with seasoned ground beef, they got every cheese in the house and sprinkled it all on.  Refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, you name it and it was on there. 

It was only 9:45 am and we were stuffed and pre-gamed all in one sitting.  Great chill atmosphere, good service considering they were short handed, great food and drinks.  Nacho Daddy, we will come back and conquer your delicious food and drinks and we will say who's your daddy!

Starving from all the calories, we burnt walking; we decided to stumble into Nacho Daddy's to satisfy our hunger. One of the main reason we came here is that one of our friends is a Vegan, and they have food she could actually eat. I had a good experience with their food at Motley Brews last year, so I knew they would not disappoint.

We ordered our food, I got the enchilada plate, and it was perfect. No complaints, and what was awesome was that the staff is really fast and attentive. I will always come back here when I need a Mexican food fix on Fremont",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,4,1,5,cpsH934MdZvHVGIxVDRj8g

Food was just ok. No free chips and salsa, have to pay for those. The crispy taco shell was not homemade, a little stale. We were charged an extra $1 for a small dish of salsa because the meal came with about 2 tablespoons of salsa. The chicken enchilada nachos were so-so, could have been better.

Our server was really friendly and energetic; no issues there. The problem was the service times! We started out with drinks that took a bit of time to get to the table. We then placed our orders and waited FORTY MINUTES for our food. Our server came over at about the 30 minute mark and said it would be out shortly. After 40 minutes I would expect some acknowledgement that the wait time was insane and maybe a comp'd serving of chips and salsa since they aren't supplied for free. 

The Nacho Average Burger Nachos were tasty with melty nacho cheese, ground beef, thin crispy chips, bacon, red onion, lettuce and tomatoes. They let us know that the portion would be enough for 2 but because I love to eat, I finished it all on my own. They serve breakfast all day but my sister's breakfast burrito was sad. When you think breakfast burrito, you expect something massive. Hers was small, and filled mostly with eggs. She had to dig around for the bacon and they forgot the avocado that she added. It was a disappointing dish for her, but everyone else was pleased. I'm not sure if the 40 minute wait time was a one-off thing but I hope they adjust that soon.",gZHCbDOkHdHIk2d02FN3kw,18,17,3,kOQW8eiK69gPK0_9KLBdZQ

2931268,2018-03-26,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"A clutch place for the gluten free crowd, their menu is loaded with clearly marked gluten free choices.

With specialties of nachos and margaritas, you really can't go wrong stopping in for a lunch and beverage while visiting Fremont Street.  Their menu contains several other options including breakfast.  If I'm going to stop at a restaurant labeled Nacho Daddy, it's a certainty there are going to be some nachos in transit through my digestive system.

I stopped in once myself and another time with my wife, giving me ample opportunities to sample their nachos.  The filet mignon nachos are fantastic, and I highly recommend having them.  Their four cheese and ""cheeseburger"" nachos are also amazing.  Keep in mind that their servings are large, so one order might be adequate - depending on your appetite.

Their margaritas are a great combination with their food and can be purchased as a single drink or in a pitcher.  When I visited, there was a free classic margarita with the purchase of an entree for checking in on Yelp!, so have your app handy.

The service was good during my visits, especially from Allie who was very sensitive about the food allergies that my wife and I bring to every dining excursion.

If you need something that hits the spot, be sure to stop in at Nacho Daddy. You're guaranteed a full stomach and a great accompanying cocktail.",MZuvl0oUK3QSv7faGx9i5w,3,1,4,r4jid4B-CjzhGzyrnNuCuw

Also, their whole delivery system for chips and salsa is terrible. They start by asking you which salsa I want as if I knew my options, so I ask for all at once so I can decide. Then they give you a basket of chips with these tiny little, smaller then a shotglass, cups of salsa. The chip barely fits in the cup.

Tonight we found ourselves out and about downtown for our friends birthday, and inevitably end up here to do this ""Scorpion Shot.""

I asked our server Aerrick what the spirit was in this shot, he replied ""what ever you like"" - well I tequila. The other 4 had Mezcal.

The whole time Aerrick was super awesome, he was friendly and didn't seem annoyed by our obnoxious birthday boy. He frequently fist bumped and was most definitely attentive. 

Our waters came first, as expected. Beers and margaritas to follow - and just after the food order we had our shots delivered. 5 shots down & A few entrees later we receive our bill. 

All of the Mezcal shots were $20 and rang in as ""scorpion"" something. And then there was mine. ""Don Julio 70"" FOR $29.

$29? Are you kidding? I drink 1942 at Goldspike for $25. Let me tell you that it isn't the price point that has me bothered, it's the fact that our server failed to mention the bump or that Don Julio 70 was all he had. I would've swapped it for Mezcal. 

I work in the industry and this is completely unacceptable. Lesson learned for this place - ASK PRICE POINTS AND CHECK RECEIPTS.

We also ordered chips & guac. I loved the guac, it had a great flavor. We also ended with a margarita. They were very large and fairly strong! Three of us ended up sharing it. 

If you're strolling around on Fremont, stop in. It's priced well and I mean how can you go wrong?!",-j2chivlY1ky_txq3PAA2g,0,0,5,KsEb2dPsEv-N8XOBj0yKbg

3085482,2016-02-28,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"I need to compliment the management at Nacho Daddy. 

My friends and I walked in to have breakfast at 9am after the Color Run. The restaurant was basically empty. We ordered about 5 minutes into arriving. The server was not ready, willing, or cordial from the moment we walked in. I ordered a coffee and my friends ordered breakfast. She said she would be able to make my coffee, but not right away. She would later just forget (thank god for the manager who came over and made it for her). After ordering, the restaurant filled up with runners from the Color Run. 

As service slowed to a crawl, our food came out. Well, only some of it. And it was the wrong order. 30 minutes later, our order still was not complete. 40 minutes had passed, we gave up and we asked for our check. The server eventually got us our check but charged us twice for the food we never got. After correcting that mistake, she failed to give us back our credit card. It was time to leave to avoid more and more errors. After a morning of below average service, we left. 

Here is the good part. As this was rare service from this location, I went back later to discuss it with the area manager. She was very apologetic and kind. She wanted us to return and make up for the errors from that morning. She said she would discuss the problem with the server and see if there was a systems failure during breakfast times. 

I appreciated the proactive nature of the area manager. Serving can be a tough job and some days are better than others. While our experience was below average, it was corrected by a manger willing to listen and correct the errors.

The restaurant is pretty small, a fully stocked bar sits across from a stage next to a separate dining room. Nacho Daddy regularly features musical performers and artists which really helps reflect what DTLV has been focusing on for the past years.  The food is similar to the Henderson location, but seemingly in smaller portions. The street tacos are delicious and the Thai chicken nachos are a great twist and a must-try dish. Splurge on the deep-fried ice cream, its worth it!  The bar gets extra points for serving up margaritas in mason jars! Though the food is pretty good I thought it was overpriced; $14 for nachos? $10 for margaritas? Meh. 

Service was pretty friendly on our visit though the bartenders seemed to be slacking on the drinks. Our margaritas were too sweet and they weren't that generous with the tequila.

The good: 

*Super cozy atmosphere reminiscent of local Seattle pubs I'm used to. Cute decor includes separate bar and dining areas. Small retail items such as t-shirts for sale a smart idea for tourists. Funky coffee bar a nice touch.

*Music, diverse crowd, diverse menu and awesome cocktails make me want to camp out during Happy Hour and people watch.

*Everything I have tried is pretty good. I suggest splitting everything so you and your group can try more items.

*Vegan menu amazing!

*Restrooms are clean...a rarity in Fremont.

The bad: 

-Any expert nacho maker will tell you to put some toppings on bottom. We were disappointed no meat or beans under first layer. If I'm gonna pay $17 for nachos ""placement"" is important! lol...I'm a snob I know.

-Meat can be a bit dry, maybe if stored in its own juices it would lock in flavor.

-Parking only on street at meter's.

- Small and dimly lit. If you need personal space then don't come here at night.

My questions: 

Would I brave the scorpion cocktails or the Thai or dessert nachos? Not sure but they look cool. 

Was the rancho sauce really homemade? It was awesome and waiter said yes but I wonder...?

My answers:

1)Put the queso on the nachos instead of plain cheese.

2) Get there before noon for lunch.

3) Don't be in a rush.

4) Expect to walk a ways if street parking is full.

Nacho Daddy is located in the heart of Downtown, Las Vegas, just a couple blocks down from where I work. I've tried several of their dishes and have never walked away with that ""wow"" factor. Their nachos are very satisfying, and they come with a heap load of toppings to ensure that every chip has some kind of yumminess on it. The BBQ nachos are the best, in my opinion. 

I've tried their filet beef street tacos. The beef is cut into very small pieces, and then topped with a sprinkle of onions and cilantro. The food is then placed on two mini corn tortillas. The tacos do the job, don't get me wrong, but the meat was a bit overcooked to my liking, and I had to add a bit of hot sauce to keep the tacos moist. Again, not a terrible meal.   

My favorite thing on the menu is their fish tacos. This is definitely a dish I would go back for!! The fish is slathered in herbs and spices and then thrown on the grill for good measure. The well flavored filet is then topped with cabbage and a little salsa, but the best part is the thick handmade tortilla it comes on. Everything works together well, and two of these babies will definitely leave you with a smile. 

The service at Nacho Daddy is okay, and the environment is relaxing with a nod to the famous 90's bands playing on the TVs. All in all, I'll be back.",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,0,0,3,PLYRC1RzkiSPSl7-FOkvRw

Shabby, not chic, Nacho Daddy's a restaurant that feels and appears rundown. Music videos from the early to mid-2000's serenade diners as they crunch down onto their exotic nachos. 

Kale Salad ($6.95): What a way to make someone feel like a heifer digging in the grass for the ""good stuff."" This is an enormous bowl filled with kale and sparse toppings of avocado slices, chunks of grilled corn, and cherry tomatoes. Too much kale and not enough toppings. The dressing, which was an oily citric concoction, didn't add flavor. 

Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos ($16.95): We paid 16 bucks for some bland-ass  nachos. Though they were loaded with guacamole, pico de gallo, refried beans, cilantro, and ""filet mignon,""  these were disappointingly flavorless.

The service was ok. They were really friendly but it took a long time for us to get our food. 45 minutes to an hour which is quite long. 

I got chicken enchiladas which I typically get at the Henderson location but they were not good. The tortilla was too thick, the chicken wasn't even shredded, more of chunks and the flavor tasted like it came from a can. The rice was hard and nothing to be desired. 

Chips were good but you can't really mess that up. Waiting for our check took a while too. Clearly we were ready to go and our waiter walked passed us multiple times without a check in his hand.

They have kid cups which seems minor but I can't tell you how many times down waiter had attempted to hand a big, open top, glass to our toddlers. 

The food was amazing, the kids loved  the chicken fingers and BBQ nachos. My husband and I devoured the dip sampler, he has tacos and I had the Mexican burger. It was excellent.

My wife ordered a chicken chimmey changa and it was massive. With the size of that order the chicken was perfect and the crispyness of the changa was perfect.

Overall I would tell anyone who wanted to try our something more then your average run of the mill eatery to give this place a try. It was welcoming to my family and the food was delicious.",WJ3zVAquKfM-mooNVKwK-w,1,0,5,34S0SOTPtE96k35y6m2Jvg

Nice buzz afterwards. We ordered the chicken quesadilla and spicy shrimp nachos. Substituted the cheese for the yellow nacho cheese on the nachos. One word amazing! Have to eat em pretty quick so the chips aren't as soggy but they were still good. Probably have light salsa on em next time too.

The spinach chips kinda killed the taste.. I also got the triple dip. The salsa taste like water tomato paste, and the chips were WAY over salted. The queso was super good though.

We came up to check in and were quoted a 50 minute wait. No biggie...from all of the great things my husband had read we figured it would be worth the wait. My husband had literally been talking about Nacho Daddy before we even got to Las Vegas. 
Shortly after we checked in a flood of people also checked in. Really. So. Many. People. Multiple small and large parties. Great I thought! It's going to be AMAZING!
40 minutes goes by and I'm pretty annoyed because ALL those people were sat before us. But whatever we were quoted 50 minutes. Then 50 minutes goes by.. an hour.. so we check in again with the hostess. She informed us that she was waiting for a larger table to seat us since we needed a high chair. Okay fine. We finally get seated an hour and a half after we checked in and we were seated at two tables pushed together. One table so wobbly they had to overlap it with the other table to sort of stabilize it but it would slowly inch apart and be wobbly again. The hostess said the manager would be over to fix it. He or she never showed. I was literally seated between the two tables and couldn't even keep my plate level. 
We waited a good while before a waiter and a trainee come to ask about what we'd like to drink. We order drinks and appetizers and then wait even longer to order food than we did to order drinks.  Our queso came out wrong (we asked for the toppings on the side) so it had to be remade. 
The food eventually came and it was good but didn't really satisfy us after such a sour customer service experience.

That left 4 of us to get something to stuff our faces with. We went with Nacho Daddy which turned out to be an awesome decision.

It was not crowded at all on a Monday night, so we were sat quickly and placed our appetizer and drink order. We went with the pulled pork BBQ nachos, which turned out to be phenomenal. The pork was good (not the best I've had but this ain't dixieland), but the sauce and queso made this spectacular. Their BBQ sauce was very tangy, with just enough sweet and a little kick at the back end. The white queso was interestingly underneath the pile of chips and toppings but it works well as it keeps the slimy chip situation to a minimum.

Our margaritas took a while to obtain but were good. Mine was the house rita, which was a tad sweet but mixed strong enough and with fresh lime juice.

Everyone at the table ordered various iterations of Gringo and Street Tacos. I personally got the steak filet ones which were great. I would have preferred shredded cheese to queso, but it turned out ok. Others in my party were really impressed with the shredded pork tacos. Refried beans were on point as well. The Spanish rice was unimpressive, it was a bit overcooked but had the right flavor.

The only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because the bar was a little too slow in getting drinks out. Our server was awesome! We were given great recommendations and he took a few pictures of our group since we learned he's a serious photographer!

They sounded like they would be tasty from the menu description. My expectation was that the chicken would be shredded, since that's how it always is in enchiladas. Instead, there were little cubes of dried out chicken. I expected some enchilada sauce to be mixed in with the chicken, but instead the nachos were a wet, greasy mess. Enchilada sauce had been dumped over all of the chips. I ate about a quarter of the food. That was all I could stomach. I ended up having a ""sour"" stomach for nearly three hours after the meal.

My friend had what she always has - the Big Daddy burrito. She loves it. When it came, it was obviously smaller than what it had been in the past. She stated that they must have changed the recipe because it just didn't taste the same. In the past, they always had brought a small plate with sour cream and lettuce on it, too. She asked to speak to the manager who came over after we had completed the meal.

We came in on St. Patrick's night and the place was quieter than every other restaurant on the Fremont Street Experience, which should have been our first warning.  We ordered a pitcher of White Peach margaritas and the ""average burger"" nachos for me, Daddy's Supreme chicken taco for him.  Then we waited patiently, expecting the drinks to come out first.

No such luck - here comes the food.  I look over at my husband's plate and see this really sad-looking taco shell with a bunch of filling in it.  There was more plate than food, and I had a nasty feeling that the rest of the experience wasn't going to be much better than this.  My nachos, at least, had some substance.  But... they were just okay, not great.  The cheese sauce tasted like reheated Cheez Whiz, there was no bacon whatsoever to be found, and the onions were minced so finely that they just disintegrated the moment they touched my tongue.  I was bitterly disappointed.  

To make matters worse, the margaritas came when we were nearly done with our food.  Bad, bad timing.  We were pretty much ready to pack up and leave by that point.

Once the drinks came, the experience was slightly better - but, hey, I got drunk.  If it takes getting me drunk to improve things... (and my husband will tell you that he has never seen me tie one on like that, ever)

Final insult:  the bill was 53 dollars, making it the most expensive meal we had in Vegas over the course of a week.  It wasn't close to being worth that.  My husband honestly didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I convinced him otherwise.  

It never did get any busier while we were there.  I see why it didn't now.

The only reason why 2 stars - the food was edible and the drinks packed a punch.  But that's it. Servers were polite but in the end did nothing to improve our experience here.

Rico was our server he made a few suggestions but we had our minds set.
Wife ordered quesadilla and daughter ordered enchiladas and I had american tacos.  My wife and daughter ended up swapping entrees after their first bites.
I wasn't too particular for the seasoning on my beef tacos kinda reminded me of taco bells beef.  I decided to finish my daughters quesadilla and tackle the tacos later.
Overall experience was great the chips were homemade and were awesome with the queso and the side of refried beans served with our entrees. Our server was attentive to our wants and needs and offered great hospitable customer service.",ct67EP7aAkPmvMhqvZXBTw,0,0,4,hyk_j6kfyIntvu_ks1R7Kg
3948678,2015-08-25,2,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Came to this place specifically for the scorpion shots. And of course. They were OUT OF SCORPIONS. I was so disappointed that we traveled all the way downtown just to be told we couldn't get what I wanted. Oh well, we ordered food anyway.

The food itself was pretty good. My cheesy nachos had delicious queso, though it was lacking the amount of jalapenos we would have liked. We asked for a side of them extra. But, our server/bartender forgot and we had to ask again 15 minutes later.

My boyfriend also ordered one of the burritos. He really liked it, and it was a generous size. He gobbled it all down. I didn't try it myself, but I trust his judgement.

We also had to ask for refills for our water, which was challenging because she spent most of her time talking to a couple and group on opposite sides of the bar.

I'm pretty set on trying these scorpion shots. But next time I will call first.

EDIT:

Just added another star to this review because I was immediately contacted by the restaurant owner to apologize for my experience. I was offered a comp and to be contacted when scorpions come in. I'm very impressed. And I am hoping very much that I can give them another try when I come back to Vegas next year! :)

I ordered the Anaheim taco which consists of Anaheim chilies, sour cream, sautéed onions, a blend of three cheeses, a slice of avocado all placed on a taco with scrambled egg.

The taco was not a flour one.  It was more like a pastry crust rather than a flour tortilla, but it was very good.  The menu says that all breakfast tacos are served with potatoes or refried beans and rice.  I was offered neither.  I did have a choice of mild, medium, or hot for the salsa and I chose hot.  It's mildly hot if that's not an oxymoron.
Breakfast was good and the server refilled my coffee when he saw I was getting low.

This place just opened a month ago and they're still doing work on it.  This morning, they were installing a garage door in the bar area that can be raised in good weather and serve from a counter on which the door rested today.

Part of the fun of eating here today was watching my server change the Coke cartridges.  The syrup now comes in super concentrated containers that look like copy machine cartridges and it was interesting watching him switch out two of the cartridges. The change in technology was interesting.

I parked underground in the Neonopolis garage and there was no charge.  I don't know if it's because of the time of day or that I was there less than an hour, but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wished me a good day and opened the gate.

So I used my Yelp app to find this restaurant and noticed that it was on the Food Network. This place has a great atmosphere good for watching sporting events they have huge TV screens. A great drink selection and even food and appetizers. They're known for their shots that have a scorpion on the bottom of the glass I didn't try that because I was too scared. I'm giving five stars for the food not really for the service that could have been better. Maybe it was kind of busy but our server hard we came to our table and if you have to request something it took a long time.

My wife and I were going to a concert nearby and wanted to grab a bite to eat before the show. She was in the mood for nachos, so coming here was a no-brainer. 

Upon entering, we were thrown off by having to seat ourselves. It was kind of packed, so finding a table in the back took a minute. There was a large party in the center that seemed to be taking up everyone's attention, so it was about 5 minutes before we even got menus and another 5 before we got to speak with our server.  Fortunately, that gave us time to decide what we wanted to order, so we ordered as soon as he arrived. 

It took nearly 45 minutes to get our food, but again, that was due to the large party in the center. The food was fresh when it arrived, but was mediocre at best.

 Her nachos were over-saturated with this extremely spicy salsa. The amount of cheese on the nachos gave the impression that ANY cheese on there was merely an accident. It was primarily a plate of chips and salsa, garnished with chicken and a few vegetables. 

 I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was amazing. The fries were great while they were piping hot. However, as soon as they cooled down, they became hard as a rock and hazardous to my health. I couldn't finish even half of them (and there weren't a lot to begin with).

 The part that gives this experience 3 stars (and not 1 or 2, as the food was quite a disappointment) was the service. Our server was Danny, and the little amount of service the party in the center allowed him to give us was excellent. 

Overall, it was a decent experience. Not one I intend to repeat any time soon, though.",1UHhBKRRS4gfwmD3lt1zGw,0,0,3,c6Wkuxou0EbP8UR8MU3LDQ

I dined here with 3 other adults and one baby on a Sunday evening. The dining area was pretty busy, we were told to seat ourselves at the only available table and a server came over fairly quickly to inquire if a highchair was needed (it was). 

We started out by ordering drinks, I had a moscow mule which was served in a silver mug (I should dock Nacho Daddy one star just for that BS). For an appetizer, we got the triple dip which is queso dip, guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was chunky and looked great but lacked seasoning, and queso dip came with sliced jalapenos in it however no heat could be detected by anyone in our group, which became the standard for our evening. 

My husband got a combo which was a 1/2 a sandwich and a bowl of the ghost pepper chili. My brother in law had the ghost pepper chili nachos. Both commented on the lack of heat in their meals. The shrimp bowl I had was fine, as was the quesadilla that my sister in law had. Nothing was exceptional though.

I was a little disappointed as the downtown location is much smaller and the decor is super urban. There is a small seating area of 2-4 person tables (about 10) and a wall that seperates the bar area with counter height seating. It fits the downtown scene but I don't find that seperation comfortable. 

The menu is not the same as what's online or what is at the Henderson location. This menu has less items which was disappointing because I was raving to all of my friends about their delicious quesadillas and it wasn't there. We were also told by the staff that there were items available at the bar were not available on the menu. In the end we got our quesadillas but it was confusing. 

Our party was about 13 people and the servers were very good at getting our food and drinks without too long of a wait. I had the burger nachos which was delicious and a raspberry margarita which was a little too sweet but good. My boyfriend had steak fajitas and a skinny margarita and was very satisfied.

The staff is very personable and service was quick. Not bad for a full restaurant and a Sat night. 

There's also several margaritas and tequilas to choose from. I eyed out getting either a guava margarita or a blood orange or the Thai basil one. But I copped out and got a Moscow mule as I was craving some ginger beer. It was good as well.

Yeah yeah, you get the point.

Come here for one of their special margaritas. When it says they are hand crafted, I absolutely shit you not they are COMPLETELY TOTALLY ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT HAND FREAKING CRAFTED. Total love and care go into each special glass, in addition to decent mixed-drink tequila and house-made mixers. And they are super delicious! Totally worth the price you pay. Even the simple house margarita blows all others out of the water, by far.

Our bartender was a god among men. He never EVER stopped working -- from fulfilling table orders, to bussing areas, to restocking and cleaning the bar area, to serving our awesome drinks. Just a stud.

Yes, btw, I did the Scorpion Shot for a discounted t-shirt. LOL and managed to crack myself up scaring a few out-of-towners in the process.

4191664,2014-02-01,1,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Stop 2 on the Holiday Progressive dinner tour: *stop one below at Double Helix* 

Criteria for the Progressive Dinner was 6 people 3 ""couples"" - 3 different restaurants/bars in 3 different areas of Vegas. Total bill for all 3 not to exceed 600.00 total or 200.00/couple. 

All 6 of us have been to & loved the Henderson location so when Nacho Daddy opened in the DTLV it was our 1st choice to go to for dinner. 

We arrived still a bit sated and slightly tipsy from our last stop. *not to worry we who live in Vegas make sure not to drink & drive* 

When we arrived *slightly late but we called* they had our table all ready & waiting. Our server was Chris who was amazing at keeping our glasses full. 
We started with a round of Lambics - just to clear the palate. 
Followed by a pitcher of perfect Margaritas. Normally not the best idea because for some reason in other places we've found that the pitcher method loses some of the quality of the actual cocktail. Not in the case of the Big Daddy's. consistent tot he last drop. 

For food - we decided on 3 different types of nachos

Florentine: Chicken Spinach & asiago cheese. 
very light & different from the nachos we've had previously. Excellent choice for a vegetarian as they will make them - the chicken. By far my personal favorite. Kind of like a nice spinach dip with the chips already in. 

Thai Chicken:  not my personal favorite but everyone else loved them. Basically it was a nice pad thai on nacho chips and very SPICY. it was very flavorful but I was enthralled with the Florentine.

Fiesta Chicken Nachos: Closest to what is expected in a traditional American nachos amped up with the addition of the diablo sauce. One of the ""boys"" tried to lick the plate. 

Speaking of ""boys"" the urinal block is hysterical. yes I looked. 

We each had an order of corn on the cob & shared 2 bowls of the queso dip. 

Food:  consistent with the Henderson location. 
Service: Exceptional. Chris gets 5 ***** (for vegas, someone that attentive to a large party is very unusual) 
Fat Friendly:  All seats were armless so no hip issues. also spaced far enough apart that we didn't have to sit back to back with our neighbor. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night in off season, but there was ample room. Doubt that would be the case during Life is Beautiful or EDC. 
Ambiance: much more cosy & conducive to conversation than the Henderson location. 

Total bill including tip: $206.00

With all of the excellent food offerings in the downtown Las Vegas area, it is extremely important to put ones best foot forward on the food scene.

With the menu having been studied for at least that long, we were ready to order. The waiter breezed up, took my drink order for ONE BEER and left without getting the food order. The waiter breezed up with the beer, took the food order of filet mignon nachos and an order of shrimp ceviche. The sad nachos arrived to the table with very little cheese, drowned is a terrible sauce, low presence of steak, and sad looking guacamole. The chips were fresh. The ceviche was a no. All around...a no. No flavor, nothing, period! The avocado was fresh. Oh yeah, I wanted another beer, no one ever came back to the table. Once done with dinner, we waited, and waited, and waited for the bill. Finally it shows up and guess how much 1 beer, 1 plate of nachos, and 1 ceviche appetizer cost...OVER FIFTY DOLLARS!

This world where everyone's favorite food group (that's right, FOOD GROUP) is not only featured, but the focus of their menu. How awesome is that? Could it get more awesome? Yes it could (if they put one in San Diego) being in Vegas is pretty amazing! 

Located in Downtown Fremont, it is pretty convenient, especially if you're in the Nacho mood. Patio seating with an aircraft hangar style door, also a great centrally located industrial concrete bar, and warm sunlight. 

Because we seemingly don't know how to settle for a stock off the menu selection we went with the Supreme Tostada Nacho, but asked for the pico on the side and also a side of the enchilada sauce, but without the lettuce (cause that did seem weird, right?). First, how awesome was the bartender? They brought out our order and he immediately noticed the presence of lettuce and threw up the stop sign. All apologies, it was returned to the kitchen and a fresh prepped replacement was brought shortly thereafter. Second, these were the best nachos ever!!!! Ermergosh! Such a great blend of flavors and I was halfway through the order, before I remembered we had the sides. Unfortunately, I had waited so long that the enchilada sauce had cooled before I got to it, because I'm sure warmer would have been better (still pretty good). 

I digress, let me finish this thing.

First, the worst margaritas in Vegas. They are so incredibly sweet, it's actually undrinkable. I can't believe they claim they are voted the best in town and I am shocked they haven't changed the recipe after the feedback I've heard from other people that have had them. 

Secondly, it seems they always have the giant front roll up door open even on extremely hot days. If your going there between may and August, be ready to sweat! Not the best environment for enjoying a nice lunch or dinner.

My friend and I met up here after work for a bite to eat. The place is small and cramped, and I think they could have alleviated that problem by making the bar just a bit smaller and instituting some smaller bar seats, as the seats take up to much room in the walk-ways. 

Happy hour consists of $5 margaritas and $4.50 Mexican beers they have on draft. Not the largest selection for a HH, but not bad. There is food on the HH menu as well. I ordered the shrimp tacos and out they came as fried shrimp tacos, which I would have liked to have known and wish the menu would have pointed that out.

My friend and I also shared a nacho platter, ahem, since we were at a place called NACHO Daddy I had great expectations. They arrived in no time and were placed on our table. As I looked at this platter of nachos I questioned many things in life, ""When a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it make a sound?""... ""When I am at a place that specifically has Nachos in its' name and I am unimpressed with the nachos... are they really nachos at all?""

We got the Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos. I have reservations on whether or not the meat was actually filet mignon. I also have reservations now on ever ordering a $16.95 priced plate of nachos, which I expected to be bigger, and better.

My friend thought they would bring us chips and salsa but no, it was $3.50 when the menu said it would be $2.95 so that is my first problem with this place!!  Then I ordered the Vegan guacamole and mango salsa tacos.  I am sorry to say they were very unpleasant.  I am not sure if it is not ""mango season"" or what the deal is, but the ""guacamole"" was a misnomer--it was not full of guacamole like you might expect because there were no animal products-it just seemed like an afterthought.  My second problem with this place is that a diet soda is $2.95.  Come on, seriously?  you serve it in a little plastic cup.  Nothing fancy.  I will not be back here.

I was so excited to try some of their nachos and loved the variety of options like buffalo chicken, BBQ chicken, hamburger and enchilada. I opted to go with the enchilada nachos with green sauce. Overall these bad boys were delicious! I'm glad I made the green sauce choice and the toppings were definitely not sparse. The only thing I didn't care for was how quickly the chips got soggy. I'm not a soggy chip fan so that kind of crushed my spirits.

We had the filet mignon nachos and they were meh at best. First, the filet was overcooked and tough. 

Secondly, there was so much beans they overpowered the other toppings and made the chips soggy. And although our waitress asked for extra cheese there was hardly any and it was all dropped in one spot, so basically on like three chips. 

Third the toppings are only on one layer. For this price point, and considering nachos are the main schtick, you'd think they could sprinkle and melt some cheese on the bottom layer. 

The guacamole and ranchero sauce were good and so was the service, but overall I left feeling like I had just had poorly assembled, overpriced bar food and not a specialty dish of a restaurant with a main focus on nachos.",0hEwhQ0VywSngpSLWCmMuw,1,0,3,4WAI8JnoHUtdySF3cW57_Q

We ordered a few house margaritas from the happy hour menu as well as some nachos and chicken tacos. It's always annoying when places advertise their happy hour menu to get you in the door and then the servers seem so displeased with you for ordering from said menu. After we placed our order, we barely saw the bartender for the rest of the time we were there. It took us about twenty minutes to flag her down and get the check when we wanted to leave. We were forced to hang around even longer because she ""mistakenly"" didn't charge us the happy hour prices for our drinks. She made sure to make several other customers drinks before fixing our receipt. If you aren't going to treat all of your customers well, you should just get rid of happy hour.

The house margaritas were unsurprisingly mostly simple syrup. The chicken tacos and nachos were fine but not particularly memorable.

* NACHOS + BOOZE CAN'T LOSE
:::: The Nachos -- The perfect BOOZE FODDER! Nacho-greatest example of gourmet Tex-Mex, but PHENOMENALLY SATISFYING when you're 2 beers and 2 shots deep, and about to take a video of your poor homie chewing up and swallowing a dead scorpion on a dare. Please be courteous and vomit outside!

* PARTY PALAZZO
'Palazzo' means PALACE in Italian, as in watch your PALs get drunk off their ASSes! This is VEGAS BABY, so get STUFFED & get TRASHED, and this is a great place to do both! Rush in with your new crew of friends you just made Downtown & go 18-Dummy off their grande Tequila selection (60 varieties) while deep-throating MORE NACHOS (gross)! Watch the game on one monitor, or hilariously tacky old 70's and 80's music videos on the other, in between scorpion-shots and INSTAGRAM-selfies!

* THANKS FOR THE MEHmories
I will never in my life forget this meal. I walked into a big, fun space for lunch, was waited on by a super-cool server named Elicia, devoured one  disappointing MEH dish after the next, and finished with an unforgettably bad Las Vegas decision--the Scorpion Shot! My life on this planet has been made slightly more significant by this wacky bit of suffering.

Don't walk in by yourself as a foodie because you'll feel like a fool :) Let's find out why...
:::: Carnitas Tacos -- Utterly Bland. If you've ever experienced eye-fluttering ecstasy from expertly crafted tender-juicy-crispy-salty carnitas tacos then DO NOT order them here. It'll MEHk you sad.
:::: Battered Fish Taco -- Decent. Best thing I ordered. Great texture, good flavors.
... So then I tried to redeem the meal with what I thought would be a guaranteed winner, but it was even more MEH!
:::: MEHxican Roasted Corn -- Like a disappointing Tinder date. She seemed so hot until we MEHt. Too little mayo, too little cotija cheese, no chili powder, no lime, and the corn was wet roughage--not sweet enough. Complete fail.

- SCORPION SHOT: MASOCHISTS ONLY!
Probably the go-to hazing ritual of UNLV fraternities. On par with eating a rotten shrimp head from the bottom of a Panda Express dumpster. Chewing into the guts of the scorpion, realizing that its half-decayed organs were all over my teeth, and then washing it down with a shot of tequila was a 5-second NIGHTMARE. I almost threw up my entire lunch. So why did I do it? The server picked up on the gray glow of my meal disappointment and hit me with a brilliant up-sell. ""You know what you should try that's pretty good?"" she said with a wink, ""The Scorpion Shot! Come on, you have to do it, you're in Vegas!"" She smiled pointing to a black t-shirt they sold with '#GOTSTUNG' printed on it.

I would of given it a 1 star had the salsa not been so good. I wish I would've just had a drink and chips and salsa. Then I would've left a very positive review. But me and my wife both felt horrible the remaining of the day also. Just kind of recurring burps of the food all night. I didn't want to eat my burrito, but at $15 for the burrito, I ate it anyways. I would've rather eaten at chipolte.
It ended up being worse for my wife. She spent all day on the toilet and puking. Then off to urgent care. Food poisoning is considered the most likely cause. I felt pretty bad after eating there but at least I wasn't doing as bad as her. $70 later for a crappy dinner and kind of ruining our trip to vegas. 1 star now.

And no, it is not a nightmare, because the nachos here are so good I can't think of a better place to perish than in the gooey goodness of a soggy, cheese-smothered tortilla chip from Nacho Daddy.

So the chicken fried steak breakfast nachos are in my top ten favorite dishes of all time. I was even inspired to make a version for my friends on a few occasions to great success, but I haven't come close to beating the original.

The one drawback to this place is the service. When we did get service it was great, but the waitstaff/bartenders were spread thin and trips to our table were few and far between.

Even so, you neeeeeed to go here if you find yourself in downtown vegas. Back to dreaming about the next time I get to visit here.",kC8nybKxZVLwYVtd4VjSnA,2,0,4,zOzNz4-I2L88FrkBp07mAg

The food was really good. I got the chiliquilles. It came with eggs, tortilla chips, sauce, chicken, pico, beans and rice. And guacamole! Yay! The only thing that's missing was a crunch factor. The whole main dish plus the beans just makes the whole thing soggy, but that's the nature of this dish anyways so I'm not too mad. My boyfriend got the loco mock nachos. It was really good. Everything was really filling though. We were straight up so full after we left. And we were going to explore DTLV so we didn't want to carry take out boxes with us. So if you're going, it's good enough to take back home. 

The atmosphere was great. The servers were really nice. The food came out relatively quick. The music was a little out of concept but it's fine. It looks like they have really good drinks, wish I tried some but it was 10am and I couldn't haha. This is more of a lunch/dinner place, but it is good for breakfast.

4811468,2017-04-03,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"I'm going to start off with the rating. Most reviews give it 3.5/5. As much as it pains me I have to agree with the rating. The saving grace in this restaurant is the incredible food. It was our first time there so we have no clue to wait for a hostess or just sit where we please. It has the potential to be a very hip hangout if they didn't shove their merchandise down your throat. After we found a table in the small eatery we finally got to order, our choices were the beer battered lobster tacos and the fajita cheese steak. The lobster taco was on point. I was surprised that even smothered in sauce the lobster stayed crispy and delicious. Covered in fresh avocado, corn and lettuce it comes with beans and cheesy rice. 

The fajita cheese steak is tasty but very greasy ( those with sensitive stomachs eat at your own risk) the bread was soaked with queso so it was difficult to eat. It only comes with fries but they were amazing in my book. I love a good pile of crispy fries. I would have liked to try the drinks and shots but unfortunately most are over priced. They have huge portion sizes but you end up paying for it. 

As for the service it was not great. The waitress acted like she hated her job and didn't want to be there. Not to mention alot of things were left unclean and dusty. Like I said earlier I agree with the 3.5 rating. Perhaps in the future I can change my review. Love, Bug",rNiXIpG4HapgxQ8HEkXRBQ,0,0,3,EXmWmFvO9gboHxYAuSYE1A

We went around 8 at night. There was a good crowd but it was not too crazy. The service was not the greatest. It was incredibly difficult to find our waitress and order food. Once we finally did, it took 35 minutes to receive our food! We ordered the queso dip (which we asked to be brought before everything considering it is an appetizer), but it came with everything at the same time. Also, the three tables that were seated at least 15 minutes after us received their food far earlier than we did, which did not make sense. The queso was good, but only when it was hot. After that it had some sort of funky after taste. The kale salad was incredibly bland and disappointing. The fiesta nachos were okay but not anything close to what I expected them to be. Overall, we left nacho daddy with queasy stomachs and had to end our night there. Definitely not how you want to spend Vegas.",8F6dEHIQmLOWFsp2LRpQ7w,0,0,1,Z53vTWdYtEhwFmBYc6nIbw

Once we got back to our Airbnb I sobered a little more and got to try a little bit of their nachos and OH MY GOD best nachos ever. I'm not really a big fan of nachos, but DAMN their nachos are literally the best nachos I have ever had! Yes, they are on the pricier side for nachos, but they're so worth it!! 

Fast forward to tonight. While we were walking around downtown Las Vegas, a few of our friends got hungry and had no idea where to eat. We saw Nacho Daddy and decided to go there to eat since we remembered that the nachos were amazing. There was no wait and our group of 11 got seated immediately. Jose was our server and he was excellent. We got the same thing and ordered two orders of the crab and lobster and two of the filet mignon nachos. Our friends we brought there for the first time also agreed that they weren't too huge of fans of nachos until they tried these. We demolished those nachos and didn't leave a single chip behind.

5042202,2014-04-10,5,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Working downtown gives me the luxury of bountiful options for happy hour.  So when a Tuesday night craving randomly arose, I decided to choose a place close to my job that offered a little bit of happy hour libations and good grub. Since they've opened, I've visited Nacho Daddy a few times. For someone who hasn't really put Mexican cuisine at the top of their list, they must be doing something right for me to continue coming back!

As successful as the Anthem location was, Nacho Daddy decided to open up shop last year in Downtown Las Vegas. This semi-hole in the wall gem of a cantina is located on 4th St., between Stewart Ave. and The Fremont Street Experience.  If you get lost, just look for the bright red and yellow neon sign accompanied with a Nacho chip man dressed in a Sombrero.  When you enter in the restaurant, you'll notice a few focal points. The first thing I noticed the partition separating the restaurant from the bar. Covered with pictures of various tequila brands, the partition really holds true to the type of restaurant this is.  There were also two garage style rolling doors offering a lot of fresh air ventilation which I appreciated on this warm evening.  

Entering the full service bar, I immediately noticed the square bar top that took up almost the entire space.  Big screen TVs and projectors allowed me to watch multiple games and networks.  On my visit, Tyrone and Rick were the bartenders helping me out.  Tyrone was the one who actually took my order and stood out to me the most.  He was not only easy to talk to, but super attentive and really took the time to show me I was a valued customer.  Now that's customer service!

The partitions made me realize that margaritas were definitely in order! Call me a lush, but since this was also an important review, I thought it was only fair to try an array of flavors! So here's the deal: their margaritas run anywhere from $8-$11 depending on the flavor.  All margaritas are served in a cool mason jar and garnished with a lime wedge and salted rims. On my visit I wanted to stick to one brand of tequila, so I chose the Sauza Hornitos Plata for its spicy taste and agave origins. Here's what I got:

Blackberry Acai Margarita for $10: Acai liqueur, muddle blackberries, agave nectar and homemade sweet and sour.  This drink was a bit too tart. You can definitely taste the sweet and sour flavor with a hint of the agave but the stars of the show were the blackberry and acai.  Chunks of blackberry offered a nice textured pulp and the sweetness of the acai balanced some of the tart flavor.   

White Peach Margarita for $9: White peach liqueur and puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour.  What I loved about this one was that it was a lot sweeter.  Sometimes sweet and sour can get a little to tart but this drink was subtle and full of flavor.  Like sitting on the banks of Georgia!

Guava Margarita for $9: Orchid guava liqueur, guava puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour.  This margarita was set up exactly like the white peach. Full bodied from the puree, the guava nectar really shined through.  I felt like I was on the beach in Waikiki!

Mango Thai Basil Margarita for $10: Thai basil, agave nectar, Mango Schnapps, mango puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour. I was pleasantly surprise about this one. On one hand you have the fragrant taste of a mango.  On the other, you're hit with a hint of the basil herb, breaking up the sweetness in an awesome kind of way.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this eclectic drink!

After trying all of these amazing libations, I needed something to balance it out. Remember folks, Nacho Daddy serves food! Tyrone was nice enough to suggest the Taco Tuesday deal: 3 mix and match tacos for $3.33. I was at the point of no return. I had to take advantage of that and I'm sure glad I did. Like the margaritas, the tacos are well prepared, well-seasoned and ultimately well received. I got the pork taco, stuffed with cheese, the chicken taco stuffed with onions and cilantro and the breaded shrimp taco stuffed with cabbage, cheese and pico.  All were super flavorful, filled with the protein and delicious!

When it's all said and done, I will rave about this place for a long time to come. I'm a huge fan of local businesses opening downtown.  This place has truly brought their success in Anthem, to the heart of Las Vegas. Whether you're in the mood for a happy hour drink, late night libation or even a brunch brewski, make your way to this awesome place, Nacho Daddy!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,7,5,4,ZsCnxyM3RAfYfrDrEyFtpw

We paid $50 before the tip for two entrees, a 24oz mug of beer, and a margarita. While it's a bit pricey compared to a standard Mexican restaurant, it's very understandable once you see the portions. They don't skimp on anything here! I ordered the four cheese nachos and they were the best nachos I've ever had, and I don't think that was the shots talking ;) There wasn't a dry chip on my plate and the chips were strong enough to hold all the cheese and jalapenos. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas and it came with refried beans and Mexican rice, also looked great. The peach margarita was perfect. We went for my birthday and our server offered me a free shot, which K9 looked like straight tequila; it would have been $7 if it wasn't comped. I made a reservation on OpenTable, where their site redirected me to, and it looks like I made it for 9pm instead of 6pm, when we went.

The food isn't bad.  They have a selection of salsas that are pretty good.  There look to be some awesome nacho platters.  I had their enchiladas one day and those were good, and tacos another day that were also pretty decent.  The fajitas both looked and smelled awesome when I saw them.  One person in my party had a burger that looked good.  

The atmosphere is pretty standard for a decent sports bar.  Family area to keep the kids away, large bar area with tables.  There are quite a few great beers on tap and they also make some unique blends with the beers as well.

So far this sounds like a 3 and 1/2 to 4 star review, I know.  But this staff took care of me during a recent stay while my mom was in the hospital up the street.  I was staying the night at the hospital and these guys knew my name, knew my drink, and offered their best.  They also let me hang out by outlets a couple of days to charge up my laptop, phone, etc.  The staff here is definitely second to none.

5158516,2017-05-18,2,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"After giving a 5 star review to the location on The Strip, it pains me to have to do this. After thinking it over, it's really a safety issue. So I am giving 1 star for this reason alone. And it's definitely a solid reason.

Why in the heck do you have a Gluten Free/Vegan menu if your items listed are not truly gluten free and/or vegan??????? And that's me asking nicely. Because I'm actually super ticked. My 4 year old has food allergies. He carries an epi pen around with him. We took him here SPECIFICALLY because the vegan portion of the menu had vegan/gluten free cheese on their nachos. I am glad I double checked with the waitress, Alex (who was really the shining star in all of this), who double checked with the kitchen. The kitchen said they mix their vegan/""gluten free"" cheese with regular flour- making it NOT gluten free.

If I had trusted Nacho Daddy to be true to their menu description, my poor 4 year old would have had an allergic reaction that would have lasted for days. DAYS... D-A-Y-S, Nacho Daddy. I know it's a joke and irritating to some people in the restaurant industry to have to cater to food intolerances and allergies, but that gives you no right to be negligent and misleading with your menu to entice an entire group of people to patron your establishment- some of them have zero choice in the matter, my son included.

Aside from that, I ordered a Daddy's Marg on the rocks with no salt- it came with salt and was really lacking in the tequila. I don't drink heavily- rarely socially, as does my girl friend that went with us and had a sip, and we both agreed it was weak. I may as well have ordered a $10 limeade. 

Her Cheeseburger Nachos were decent, the guac was good, and the ceviche was ok, pretty small for $10.

Side note: When I checked in here, a yelp notification came up saying that there are multiple reviews from the same IP to boost their rating for this specific location.. Kinda shady.


Update: Since writing this review, Taylor reached out to me and provided an explanation. Instead of sending a manager or someone from the kitchen staff, they said they mix their cheese with flour so we wouldn't order it at all. There is a chance of cross contamination, which I get. It's usually like that at a lot of places. I really wish someone would have just talked to me for 2 minutes instead of lying about it and causing distrust. There is a venue down the street, Chef Stacy Dugan's spot, that has Vegan/GF nachos and can instantly and accurately help you avoid specific allergens.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,8,0,1,tjim7ZsZR13x231aaFepWA

5181036,2017-10-14,1,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Vegan nachos review.  I don't eat meat or beans and have a sensitivity to dairy. This totally takes the fun out of eating nachos. I'm a little (or a lot depending on how you eat) picky about my food. The nachos I ordered were not loaded with all of the fixings. The bartender was surprised when they came out. I was happy. She got my order right. Score. 
So here's my review: 
These were not the best vegan nachos that I have ever had but, I ate them all. In fact, I enjoyed them down to the last few bites. The nachos are more toppings then chips so eliminating th beans made them a lot smaller in portion. The chips are house made and perfectly seasoned although, a little oily. The vegan cheese was creamier than any other vegan nacho cheese that I have tried but, not as thick. I prefer my nacho cheese to be thicker. I don't like raw onions so I ordered them sans pico or the salsa. The salsa was really good and not too oniony. I didn't touch the pico de gallo. Overall, I enjoyed this greasy treat. I wish there was a little more cheese. I was in awe looking over at other people's orders. The ones with all the fixings are a sight to see and look delicious. 
Now for experience. I sat at the bar. The bartender wasn't the most friendly but, she was efficient. I was not put off by her attitude but, could tell that other customers didn't quite understand her vibe. Still, she did her job and earned her 20% tip from me.
So the big question is would I go back? Absolutely! This is a heaven for nacho lovers and I'd love to try the different versions when I am feeling adventurous.",wanEXC9K88Bxt0kQiBS3Bg,2,1,4,XvlhQYhgj9faXcOdXKNw4Q

I got a burger and my boyfriend got a sandwich the chicken sandwich is really dry and lacks flavor the chips and salsa are $3 for bottomless but the sauces are way too garlicky. I really enjoyed the theme the ambiance. We didn't see out server much & when we tried asking for the check the guy was busy talking to what seemed like another co worker that stopped by he did t have a uniform but he was behind the counter and it took us a while to get his attention.

A restaurant that serves nachos and tequila open the breakfast? This definitely looks like a place for late night boozing. Attractive, young waitstaff and 90's 'nostalgia' music that I clearly remember as a full grown adult. Nothing will make you feel your age faster than nostalgia that you're too old to care about. The drinks section takes up half their menu. Bar food makes up the rest. We got the nachos because it's in the name so you'd think they'd be good. They were pricey but plentiful. This is a good place to go if you've got expendable income and you would rather blow it on a night out with friends instead of something sensible like video poker. Not my kind of thing but I'm not their audience. If you want to spend your paycheck on shots of tequila and tortilla chips then you might love it.",sV5mnBoYod1LVNksODplQw,0,0,3,4e4mjhQrLOMppIJv40pGHw

The Vegan Nacho was a MOUNTAIN of ingredients including grilled peppers, onions, corn, salsa and pinto beans. There was veggie patty crumbles that I'm pretty indifferent about however the amount of mushrooms seemed to be minimal compared to the ratio of other ingredients. I also wish it had more guacamole but that's more of a personal preference. I was impressed with the amount of cheddar and mozzarella Daiya. Jalapeño chips were stacked pretty high and I was happy to see that the ingredients weren't just piled on top of the chips but layered within the dish. $15 may seem pricey for a plate of nachos but this place makes a genuine effort to make the price worth it. http://bit.ly/1Ic9mRg

The meateater BF had the Buffalo Hot Nacho which he devoured. I think that means he liked it.

Service was friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I appreciated that this place wasn't overly cranking the AC like most places do. I understand that Vegas weather is hot but it's inconvenient to have to carry a light sweater just to stay warm indoors.

Overall, I'm a fan! I predict that we'll be back to check out other items on the vegan menu :)",53dkR4-xyhjsCVHfrwiGaQ,9,9,4,ClhonuMvzkcXeiNlIo9-XA

If you have the Yelp app on your phone, be sure to check in! You get a check offer for a free house margarita! 

My friends and I decided to share the Supreme Tostada Nachos that pretty much had everything and we also shared the Mexican corn. As for drinks, I had their house margarita while my friends got a white peach margarita and blood orange margarita. 

The nachos were very delicious. The flavor of everything blended together very well. The corn was okay. I've had better elsewhere. As for the drinks, to be completely honest, they all tasted pretty much the same to me. They all tasted like sweet and sour mixed with tequila. I couldn't really distinctly tasted the difference much. There were fruity flavors to them but the flavor was really light. 

The only thing is that Nacho Daddy is a little bit on the pricey side. $17.50 for a plate of nachos with everything? Yowza. The margaritas run about $11-12 per. Granted, you're on Fremont street where it's mostly tourist so it's pretty much standard.

We ordered two Nachos and ate family style, the Nacho Average Burger Nacho and Filet Mignon Nacho. Wow, these nachos are absolutely loaded! We all had our favorite, but mine was the Filet Mignon Nacho.

Piled high and evenly covering the chips so you never ate a chip without topping. That being said, it was absolutely forgettable. Almost flavorless for me. We kept eating because we still had our drinks. I would say we left over half of it there. It's mostly a 20-30 year old crowd, so maybe that's part of the 4 stars.

Answer was yes. 23 minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered 2 shots of Julio 42 and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order.
Really piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx Earle

We sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had $6 Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos 
Later that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered 3 Titos and service was really slow ""different bartender""  took forever to pay.

SEE?!?  Weren't those things awesome?  In any case, I am a fan of that particular selection, although their burger nachos and chicken fried steak/egg breakfast nachos are no slouch either.

A decent little location just across the way from the Neonopolis, and nestled well within Fremont Street, I liked the low-key vibe there, with their poppy music videos on the TV, and a pretty tasty Bloody Mary (also of note, their coffee selection is excellent).

The service is friendly and keeps tabs on you.  Prices are reasonable, and portions are BIG.  Come hungry, for they will hook you up if you are suffering any sort of nacho deficiency.  

In any case, I took it upon myself to visit this location four times over two weeks, if that tells you anything, and now that I'm thinking on it, some buffalo chicken nachos do sound remarkable tasty right about now.

My comrade and self decided so seek shelter in a place called nacho daddy. We parked our steeds outside and approached the two far end seats of the bar ""it was near empty in there"". I started off as any self respecting male would. With a water on the rocks ""of which I was heckled for by the bartender, but I didn't care because I was parched of my vast travels of the sema auto show."" Anyway, After looking at my menu for all of 37.4 seconds I knew the tostada nachos were the meal to warm my near lifeless body. The friendly female bartender had enough of my shenanigans after I placed my order and slid me a Miller lite across the bar and said drink up. Little did I know this Miller would be the beginning of the end. As I finished my beer my comrade decided the remainder of the night would be spent with shots. ""Jameson and pickle juice"". After several shots ""more like 7"" along with everything else I had pre gamed with at a city called New York New York. Where we traded beads to a man in a type of chair with wheels and no legs in to get directions. l knew I had fucked up. The nachos were transported from the kitchen to the bar in a backhoe that somehow they made fit in such a tiny spot. I'm not a big person by any means so these nachos made my hand look like that little person from Austin powers. I didn't know how to attack this battle without making a huge mess or drawing attention to myself. I somehow managed to rig myself a harness from napkins and straws to suspend myself from the ceiling as to not make a mess on myself. 

Lol now that you've probably read the majority of this review I'll take a second to actually say the bartender was attentive, friendly/assholeish ""in a good way"" and the food runners were awesome as well. I recommend sharing the mound of happiness they call food with the duggar family because I barely made a dent in it.

Nacho Daddy did not disappoint, there was such a wide variety of options to choose from. I got the enchilada nachos and they did not disappoint. The portion was HUGE and the flavor was incredible. 

As for the location itself, the servers were extremely attentive and made sure we always had water. In addition, there's TV located all around playing either sports or music videos. We were seated next to a music video tv and my friends and I had a lot of fun guessing the name of the songs/artists since the videos were older. 

From the food to the atmosphere, it was an incredibly fun and worthwhile experience. I would come back to Nacho Daddy in a heartbeat.",mNCxkxJJcFB_MKq8iX5EEg,0,0,5,Q_g7c1vt8eAQcfDNi24qqA

First, they do not hold back on the portions they give you. I got the Filet Mignon nachos, and while the price might scare some people, it was totally worth it. Usually place load you up with crappy chips and tons of 
 store bought salsa, but not here. They loaded it up with tons of fresh, real home made salsa, tons of meat and fresh chips, and cheese.

The service was great as well. Our server was on top of things, checking up with us, bringing out food out quick and getting our drinks refilled before we could even ask. 

You can tell that they have been doing this for a while and perfecting it along the way. I would highly recommend stopping by here if you're ever visiting downtown vegas!",7sAY-38vCX9l7ihDIbHydw,0,0,5,Ijvp5JhCEvvAGwAm51Qujg

Food is more than a fair price, happy hour almost every day of the week.(3-6) and on top of that its VERY good and original, you won't find the same exact recipes elsewhere. Only problem you might have is the waiting time. People are usually rushing through while in Vegas so I understand why that could be a problem for some people

Lastly, there was a man best up across the street and the staff quickly checked on him and called the ambulance. Something they did not have to do.

The menu is abbreviated from the Henderson location, but the offerings are still classic Nacho Daddy with, I think, some new surprises? 

I dare say I prefer this location; the layout is cozy and more conducive to socializing,  it's warmer and more welcoming, and, hey, you're downtown! Aaaand, the open garage-style windows = a form of my beloved al fresco #patiolife! 70* on a January day? Perfect!

Looking forward to checking it out more often!

 No, I don't think all the items on their menu are spectacular, I've ordered both BBQ and Thai something nachos and they were meh. BUT, the burrito bowls never disappoint, the spicy shrimp nachos are spectacular and my friend swears by their carnitas. 
 The house margaritas are delicious and if you wanted to try one of those weird Coke flavors from a fancy machine- they've got that too. 
  Sit at the bar or in the dining room and you encounter a hilarious mix of mismatched couples on an awkward date, girls of the likes that dance in party pits fresh off their shifts, deer in the headlights tourists, younger crowd having a good time bar hopping,  and an occasional local like myself. Cause. I was downtown and so Nacho Daddy. 
They are open later than a lot of other food serving place in DT (short of a casino coffee shops) and there are times of day you can actually park in front of the place, I believe it's before 10pm. 
 The crowd and the vibe is very all over the place, you never know if there will be a drunk girl throwing up in the bathroom or if someone will slap you on the shoulder and ask about ""what's good here"", but if I didn't like that, I'd live in Henderson.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,3,2,5,2_2yDCTgfFXWPhoQp2BLRw

5612302,2018-02-14,2,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"Short review this time because hubby and I just stopped in for appetizers.  They do have a 'free house margarita' when you check in with Yelp; however, it's only with the purchase of an entree.

We started with the unlimited chips and salsa, and asked for both the mild and medium salsa, which was not a problem  We also ordered the chips and queso, which is a white queso, with pico and jalapenos (on the side please).  Hubby ordered a regular margarita with salt and I opted for a frozen without salt.  They're served in these little mason jar things and were surprisingly yummy (and you could taste the booze).

We had originally planned on ordering an entree to split; however, by the time we put a dent in the chips, salsa and queso, we were full!  Next time, nachos or bust!

When we told our waitress Perla M. that we were too full to order an entree, she explained the free margaritas with yelp check-in required an entree purchase.  Completely understandable (and still a very generous offer) and we said 'hey, no worries, we understand' and she said she'd try to 'help us out'.  She returned a few minutes later and said she was able to get our drinks comped for us!  That was completely unnecessary but very much appreciated!  We will definitely return when we're back in town and I highly recommend everyone give them a shot - if for nothing else, the customer service was amazing!",EI9KXua8lVbiHvCE32qzEQ,3,1,4,m9r8hyJa6FYvhupkS7FtzQ

We ordered; Enchiladas, Mexican Burger, Guac & Chips, and Coronitas (Margarita with Corona tipped in)

Burger & Enchiladas were alright.

What do you call cheese that isn't your's?  Nacho cheese!  *ba-dum-tissss* Thanks folks, I'll be here all week.  

After sampling some of their delicious bbq nachos at the last yelp event, I was eager to go here.  I finally got my chance yesterday 11-15-15 at 11:30 AM.  This restaurant is located on 4th street which is right smack dab in the middle of the fremont street madness.  We parked in the fremont parking garage and it cost $2.  


$35.74 got me a bloody mary, a triple dip appetizer, and a barbecue pulled pork sandwich.  Our server, Jon, was very attentive and brought us a high chair, crayons, and a kids menu for the boy.  

The bloody mary experience was unique to me....it was a bloody mary DIY bar.  For $8 they give you a mason jar with ice and Absolut in it, and then you go up to the bar and make it the way you want it.  They had bloody mary mix, pickles, celery, hot sauces, cucumbers, olives, lemons, etc. I thought that was pretty neat.  

The triple dip ($11.95) consisted of white queso dip, guac, and salsa, and it came with the world's saltiest chips (see photo).  That queso dip....oh wow....I wish I could fill up a jacuzzi with it and drink my way out.  It was heavenly.  Their guac, however, was yucky.  It tasted like the kind you can buy at Wal-mart.  I would have given this place 5 stars if their guac was good and I didn't have to wade through smelly street performers to get there.  

The pulled pork sandwich was awesome...so juicy and messy!  It came with piping hot fries that I really enjoyed dipping in the queso dip.  My only critique would be that the pork was in large chunks and I prefer it more shredded.  

Yay! I'm a fan.  Next time I'm getting the buffalo nachos and street corn.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,10,7,4,iSDltlb7cTey6GdbLoIVGQ

5716361,2016-03-25,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"It's a dive bar with great food!  The place can get a little packed, as those annoying trolley pubs have this on their route and dump 20 people off trying to get shots, but it's worth the trip.  The location in Summerlin is definitely nicer, but I like the atmosphere of this place.  If you live downtown, it's a great spot.

They have vegan options on every section of the menu.  My favorite are the vegan nachos!  A real treat.  The guacamole is good to start out with and I recommend asking for the same chips that come with the vegan nachos.  You can't go wrong with the tofu fajitas either.  The portion sizes are absolutely incredible and can easily be shared.  

If you're not faint at heart, you can get a tequila shot with a scorpion in it!  Not my thing really, but everyone should try it once.  There is some good merchandise for sale.  Have a scorpion shot and get a shirt that says #gotstung!!!

Like I said earlier, the place can get a little packed, so don't expect to get your food in 5 min like most tex-mex places.  It's worth the wait.",2tMBAV9EY9dKFD2oQ8EY9Q,0,1,5,4OqcS8BX2CeVnvhKCXohNA
5716963,2018-04-15,0,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"I wish I could give it a zero star since we didn't even get to try their food. 
My husband and I live only an hour flight away so we visit Vegas quite frequently.
This time, we decided to explore what's outside of the strip, and went to experience the Fremont Street on this past Wednesday.
While debating on what to eat for dinner, I was super excited to find out about this restaurant because I LOOOOVE nachos.
We got there a little before 6 o'clock, and the hostess said that we didn't have to wait if we'd like to seat ourselves at the bar. 
However, when we walked into the restaurant, we instantly became invisible.
We sat right in front of the bartender who was finishing up with the customer right by us. She then walked past us, collected all of the menus on the bar (at this point I thought she was going to give us one of those menus because she obviously did see us come in and sit), walked to the other side of the bar, put all of the menus back on the pile, then proceeded to chat with another customer for over 5 minutes.
Thinking that there must be someone else who's in charge of the bar area, I walked outside to the hostess and asked who is taking care of the bar customers, which she answered, ""the bartender"".
I went back inside, saw that the bartender was still busy chatting with the same customer, so I chased down another bartender who was prepping for something else and asked for the menu.
She gave us the menu and asked what we would like for drinks. 
Since we didn't even get a chance to look at the menu, I said we will start with some water.
She gave us the water, threw some napkins at us (yes, she threw the napkins), and started to chat with another customer who was sitting next to me.
We decided what we wanted to order and waited for her to finish her conversation with the other customer.
We were sitting there and waiting for her to finish up the conversation and acknowledge us.. and we were just looking at her like idiots and waiting... and waiting... and when the clock hit just over 6:20, we finally realized that nobody in this restaurant is interested in serving us and decided to walk out of the restaurant.
We were there for little over 20 minutes and didn't even get to order our drinks, when there were 2 bartenders in sight who obviously acknowledged us. How RIDICULOUS is that??
We've never felt so invisible around so many people! 
We've been trying to figure out what was wrong. Maybe it's because we looked young and broke since we came out right after swimming? Or is it because we wanted to start off with water and she thought we weren't going to order drinks? Or are they only interested in serving old male customers?? Bottom line, were they discriminating against us in some way?? Because neither of the two clearly wasn't busy and it is so obvious that they were aware of us.
The bartender was asking this old male customer next to me if he would be coming back the next day, pfffff (which he answered he's leaving the next day). Well, I can tell you for sure that WE won't ever be coming back. And yes, we've been sharing our experience with our friends and family. I hope nobody else will have to experience this horrid unreasonable ridiculous service. I guess one star can go towards the hostess. She was the only one who treated us like real existing people.",m5DgMl5LzafxOoNkbCUA4A,0,0,1,yBnLuVPdt6EPnP13zkCbDg

They even turned the sound of the game on for us. So having a decent time. But then, she came in like a wrecking ball. An off duty nacho daddy bartender with fire red hair that was a 1 person megaphone! Annoying, loud, obnoxious. Almost put her finger in my beer and musta thought we were all there for her cause she was at the top of her lungs the whole damn time. We moved to the other side of the bar and what do ya know-she followed us. We could not escape. She was gonna blow our eardrums out and with only 2 min left in the game we had to sit there and take it. Then, to our rescue, one of the bartenders seeing our despair called firey red to the other side of the bar. But she only made it halfway before she found someone else to scream at. We woulda enjoyed it much more as the staff girls were nice and lots of tv's. But lil red ryder blew our time to hell. Since she works there we prob wont go back as i assume thats her watering hole to. Wont discourage anyone from going, but when you get to the corner of 4th & fremont, and you here a loud obnoxious sound coming from nacho daddys, keep walking cause someones getting their firetruck on and wailing away",BA1cvK6jvpZaXODjUMHhYQ,0,0,2,CWK9Ng3T8DtopZv1nmjWUA

The reviews were quite positive and I was impressed by their expansive menu, so we stopped by.  When we arrived, the restaurant was occupied, but definitely not full or too busy.  Our server was friendly, but extremely slow.  

We ordered the $20 bottomless mimosas and stayed eating our brunch and watching some basketball for probably about 2 hours.  In the span of the 2 hours of being there, we only got 3 mimosas.  Every time the server checked on us, we asked for another refill and it would take an extremely long time to get another glass.  The mimosas were probably 3/4 orange juice, 1/4 champagne.  I would say go for the beer and margaritas (which I guess should have been obvious, but I can't pass up mimosas after being hungover).  The beers came out in huge mugs and I believe were only $8 or $10.  

My friends that ordered traditional breakfast items said the food tasted oily.  My vegan chick'n nachos were pretty good, though the fake chicken was hard to chew.  My boyfriend loved the shrimp nachos he ordered.  So the overall take from the table was that the food quality was okay.

It's a good spot to hang out, albeit a bit dark, but not a bad spot to catch a game with some beers and nachos.  Just don't expect fast refills.",WY-dxBebjszi4lZeZQ_GUw,1,0,3,IisBGxbOOsvGWU2yoxeGKA

The bartender, Anya, was not very helpful, didn't seem to have time to make recommendations, never came by to ask if we wanted more margaritas, and was just generally indifferent. We had sloppy joe nachos, street tacos, and house margs. It was a disappointing experience compared to the strip location. The only redeeming part of the evening here was that the margaritas and food were good. They didn't even offer scorpions in he tequila shots.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,0,0,3,QhbeVi9gCpfkb3AzrHGj7g

I'd like to give an impassioned thumbs up or thumbs down but it's really middle of the road. I enjoyed the Henderson location, and being a downtown denizen, I expected to love this location, which I do....sometimes. I say meh because this place is literally hit or miss. I've had times when I can barely touch the food they give me, and three times when I'm scarfing it down like Gabriel Iglesias on taco Tuesday. This applies to both food and the drinks. There are some bartenders that if I see working I immediately know that I need to stick to my cervezas since they can't mess that up. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great. It's just workable, I'd just like consistency. The Henderson location has always been pretty good, I've heard good things about summerlin, and I liked nacho daddy when they had a booth at LIB. Fingers crossed that this place gets where it needs to be",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,1,3,2,PKzpv3kEWzk7TJ66O3jPFw

5950565,2018-03-07,1,eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw,"We came in on a Saturday night so we expected to have a long wait.  But a 30 minute wait wasn't bad.  This place is loud and cramped!  We didn't mind the noise but feeling cramped is never a good thing.  
Going through the menu, there were a lot of dishes we wanted to try.  They have a large a menu so we needed extra time to order.  In the meantime, we ordered a Daddy's Margarita and a White Peach Margarita to help us decide.  Both were really good and plentiful.  I loved that it wasn't watered down and you can clearly taste the alcohol. 

We finally decided on the menu. For starters we ordered the ceviche.  This was pretty good. Not too salty and ingredients tasted fresh (minus the shrimp).  What I didn't like was that the ceviche to chips ratio was way off. Too much chips, not enough ceviche.  It seemed you had to stack 3 chips together to get the ratio right.  For our main dishes we ordered the Cajun Nachos and the Baja Seafood Combo.  These portions are huge!  The Cajun Nachos could have easily been split between 2 average eaters.  This nacho dish has shrimps, andouille sausage, and cajun spices. And let me tell you, Nacho Daddy didn't skimp on the shrimps and sausage.  This dish literally overflowed with them. This dish ended up being too rich. It was hard to finish this because the spices became overwhelming.  But I think that if this was shared, it probably wouldn't have been that rich.  Another thing I didn't like was the shrimps were the frozen kind.  They did little to mask that.   The Baja Seafood Combo  definitely a better choice between the 2.  This dish consist of fish tacos and lobster/crab enchiladas with rice.  This too was rich in flavor but better balanced.  I would definitely order this again.  

Our server did a good job managing the packed house.  The only complaint I have was that he forgot to put my credit card back with the receipt.  We walked out thinking that one of us grabbed it.  It took him a while to find it but eventually did.",d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg,0,0,3,Q4ajSmZWWuE3cLA2yU7KJA

The place is fun lot so great if you have an ugly date;) lol the salsa is insane no baby ass hot salsa here 10 points for griffindor! The chips and salsa are bottomless which makes this the best place to eat on the downtown strip HANDS DOWN! I really appreciated my waitress making sure to ask if I would like water because it's so easy to forget out here!

So I came to yelp and found this wonderful establishment- it literally was walking distance from Fremont Street.  I will tell you walking up to this location and walking in it looks like a dump, but man oh man was I wrong. Arrived and was seated right away. Service was good nothing magnificent but the food OMG.  Lord was it good. Great flavor and so many selections. I for sure will come back here hands down. Do yourself a favor and don't eat that crap on free mint walk a few steps to nacho daddy!!

In NACHO DADDY, I BELIEVE! haha...no really Jennifer, Tyrone and Rick took excellent care from before me stepping in to the place. The service was overly on point, and not just with me and my guest, but with everyone. I had the Mango Thai Basil Margarita and the Raspberry Margarita (Tyrone's suggestion) and both were the bomb. We partook in the Supreme Nachos sin jalapenos (I can't do spicy) and they were delicious. The guest I took rarely ate and in fact prior to eating said he'd just have ""a lil sum sum""? He ate most of it because it was so good. Rick was very attentive to his bar guests and Tyrone was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.

Although they were nice enough to seat us after arriving 10 mins before closing time (2am), they were giving dirty looks, specially by the host, who apparently was not happy to serve prior to closing (which I do understand, but nonetheless, his attitude should have been adjusted, as he is serving costumers). I walked in with a drink from another place, and he rudely told me to take my drink ""out"". I was with a group of friends, and I was not going to hand him my drink (since I had just bought it). The way he wanted to take my drink was not polite at all. He was not a good server. (Bald headed guy). Nevertheless., I will not return to this place only based on costumer service.",2mjlLtcaP0TiAZa8ca65cg,0,0,2,PKnVRp6PHxgcTvFVt9h2VA

I had the Thai chicken plate and our server, Dezi, happily substituted vegan chicken for the meat-eater variety,added back beans, and subtracted the jalapenos.  My goodness - so good. 
And the staff is so friendly. We met the manager and the head cook. We really hope this Vegas local restaurant (actually 3 in this area now) will come to Plano/Frisco, and Georgetown/Round Rock areas in Texas.
Nothing quite like this gourmet Mexican restaurant with a whole Vegan section in Texas.

The only reason why I gave this place a 4 and not a 5 was because the hosts were extremely rude! It looked like they didn't want to be there and they gave us the impression that we were interrupting their conversation when we were trying to get a table! Besides rude hosts the food is really really good!
