Easy service, and food that has been consistently great or at worst very good every time we've been by. $3.50 Hawaiian, and $5 pastrami: just the right seared crust on the patty, and just the right softness in that bread.

A part of me would like to give 4 1/2 stars for unimpressive drink options, or the kinda sketchy local experience ? today we had a guy walk in and work some hustle trying to sell cheap perfume to diners ? but even with those little reservations, I just plain love this place and always look forward to coming back.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,5,0zm0tww8gPG1iWpK3ux_uw

124323,2012-11-13,0,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"To be filed in the 'shady part of town' category, I recently visited Fat Boy Restaurant in the north east part of town. You can thank me now; I risked life and limb to increase my cholesterol level and try one more burger for you all to read about. I came across Fat Boy in a recent Yelp post about burgers along with a few other oddball places that are high on my list to try. It's not very often that I drive into the depths of North Las Vegas for anything, let alone a burger, so this better have been worth it. Was it?

The restaurant itself is small, with only 6 tables and a counter that separates the dining area from the twice as big kitchen area behind it. Do not expect anything fancy when coming here, but I doubt you would after what you've just driven through to get there or by opening your eyes and looking at the half-deserted strip mall it resides in. The owners decided to play off the word 'boy' in their menu, which is in everything from their boyrritos (burritos) to boygers (burgers). The menu also has wings, pizza, Philly cheese steaks, and almost anything else you can think of.

I thought I would keep it fairly simple and ordered the double Boyger meal, complete with everything: mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish and mustard. Now it may be the relish talking, but if there was a contest to replicate the Fatburger burger this would win hands down. The patties had great beef flavor, not quite as peppery and crispy as a Fatburger would be, but still very good. The bun was a bit thin but grilled nice and crispy, and proportioned perfectly. The toppings were all fresh, well-proportioned and complemented each other, a lot like a Fatburger would be with everything on it. Overall this was a surprise meal based on my surroundings and the loud Mexican accordion music playing in the background.

My fat fries were good; seasoned with something I couldn't quite identify, probably a typical fry seasoning. They were mostly cooked well, with a couple slightly soggy ones as often happens with fat fries. The portion wasn't that big, probably the only downside to the meal. The price for a combo meal comes in at $6.98, which is probably half of what it would have cost for the same thing at Fatburger. If you love that exact flavor and are willing to take a drive then definitely come check this place out. If you've had enough of Fatburger and don't need to try the same thing, or just don't want to risk getting carjacked, you may want to avoid Fat Boy.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,rD2TpFUMsCqlkW4TY036vA

I am a glutton for punishment so I once again decided to have a double monster boyger with cheese and bacon. This time however I added an egg! If your are faint of heart do not attempt to eat this entire burger, as it should (could) be shared.

308939,2015-06-16,0,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"So, after reading reviews of this place on yelp I decided I had to try it. I have been trying to find the real best burger in Las Vegas and I know it ain't on the strip. We entered and were greeted by a nice young man who immediately took our order. We got 2 bacon cheeseboygers and shared an order of fries.  The meat in the burger was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and seasoned perfectly. The bacon was crispy and all the ingredients went well together. The burger was reminiscent of a Fatburger with regards to toppings and the way it is put together. 5 stars.  The fries were hot and had seasoned salt on them so they kind of reminded me of Farm Basket fries, another 5 stars. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they offer chili verde on their mexican food but didn't know what a green chile was when I asked if I could have one on my burger. I had to go on and describe it as an anaheim chile then my gf said Ortega chile and the lady knew what we meant but sadly no green chiles for the burgers (kind of makes me wonder where they get the chili verde from if not from green chiles). I would totally recommend the burgers and I will go back to try the chencho fries (fries with green chile, cheese and chopped chicken) and have already recommended them to friends.",02Qbod85rFWE1xZrvUdu6w,0,0,4,eeeQKs8wNfIDHIKcAl7W-w

I had a cheese boyger with bacon and an egg (perfectly fried over hard) and fat fries combo for $8 something. It was definitely a 4 star burger for the price. About on par with the Fatburger chain, but a Fatburger combo with bacon and egg is like $13 bucks. And that makes Fat Boy a spot-on 4 star! The owners/workers were prompt and friendly and know how to do burgers on a flattop. But the dining area is small and lackluster which drops the overall score down. But the food is what you'll go for, and this is definitely a worthy stop if you're on that side of town.",OKdLRP7nWMXHVHqPrkJUyA,0,0,4,kZHwyikfyk2u0rTqtxpXSw

For $1 extra to add cheese on each burger you order, just do yourself a favor and order an extra burger and put on the cheese yourself at home since the burgers are small.

1634429,2013-10-06,10,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"I sort of dread that time of time of day when the ever so mass thought provoking is asked....""So, where are we gonna eat?""  Such a question can often result in an indecision, disagreement, waffling, hate, depression and sometimes joy and happiness.  No one really ever wants to be responsible for decision of that magnitude.

I threw out my choice and attempted to stick to my guns but then something strange happened....What's this!  My boss, a non-yelper (but enjoys the benefits of reading the reviews of others) pulled out his smart phone and fired up the oracle that is yelp and said, ""How about Fat Boy?""

Rarely do we make it over to this side of town and because he yelped it, I could not refuse and it is a damn good thing I offered no resistance.

Fat Boy is a small and somewhat obscure business located in the Northeast corner of Stewart and Lamb.  God, knows I would never of found it or had the pleasure of dining there had it not been for yelp and my bosses determination to not dine at another establishment.

Be WARNED!  The inside is rather small but then again so is the pearl inside inside an oyster.  One might want to call ahead to know if it's busy inside.  We arrived at or around high noon and were able to get a table for five, as another group was leaving.  I noticed there a lot of take out action occurring.

The menu has much to order in way of traditional American i.e., burgers and such.  There is also a few Mexican items to order along with pizza.

I went with the with double cheese ""boyger"" which consisted of two (what appeared to be) home made patties.  I also threw on a fried egg along with some bacon for goos measure.

This burger is on the top of my list of BEST burgers I have ever eaten.  Everything was super fresh and an absolute JOY to eat.  I watched friends devour the monster version of this ""boyger"" and was initially jealous and wanting more.  However, on this particular day, I was happy with what I ordered.

The ""Chencho Fries"" were a nice compliment to meal.  Steak or skinny fires smothered with a sort of green sauce with chicken and cheese.  Delicious!

FB has been around for five years and because of yelp, I have only recently discovered it.  If I had been aware of existence when it first opened....I am sure I would have already had my first and possibly second heart attack.

I am destained to tempt such a fate again in very near future.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,11,7,5,E-L-kDaqGCkl27BJ4VSsew

Today I was unhappy bc the chencho fries were practically normal fries. Hardly any sauce, cheese or chicken.  Upon leaving I ordered 2 sides of ranch which I was charged .50 each for even though I ordered fries (I feel like the condiment goes w my food). And esp now that I have lots of dry fries being that the chencho is not at all drenched in goodness...I def need ranch and shouldn't have had to pay extra for it. 

Finally my Adams burrito had no onions or cilantro, which is on the menu description...and part of why I even ordered it in the first place. I was craving asada w onion and cilantro...it's just not the same flavor.

She was in the mood for a turkey burger, so I opened my trusty Yelp app, searched nearby places and voil√†...Fat Boy! I, too, am kicking myself for not knowing this culinary gem existed sooner.

She got the turkey boyger and a Caesar salad, I got the monster boyger combo and upgraded it to the chencho fries. Hers was well seasoned (she deemed it very yummy) and the salad was simple, not too strong and swimming in dressing like some Caesar salads tend to be. My monster burger was also seasoned well, tasted homemade, and all the toppings were perfectly balanced with the size of the patty and bun.

Those fries...oh how dangerous they could be...were scrumptious! I am a fan of green chilies/salsa, so if you are too, you will love them even more. I opted for the fat fries (steak) instead of the skinny fries, because I am a steak fry fan. They were too hot to eat as soon as they hit the table, so I let them cool down while I munched on my burger. During this time though, they absorbed the juices from the green sauce, so when I did get to dig into them, they were full of the green chili flavor - YUM! They weren't over cheesy, which cheese lovers might view as a bad thing, but I think it was a plus because you get a balanced forkful of goodness in every bite.

The burgers were so good that as soon as we swallowed our last bite, we wanted another one. So, being the gluttons that we are, we ordered another turkey boyger and a pastrami boyger ToGo, looking down on our phone like we were reading a request for food by hungry people at home...as if!

I have to give them a call before heading out, closing at 7 pm on a Saturday night seemed weird, and it was almost 9 luckily they were open till 10.

I kinda knew we was going to enjoy the food just from the many pictures of happy customers all over the walls. I ordered Guacamole Boyger and sis ordered the Guacamole Boyger meal with fat fries. While waiting I keep reading Fat Boy yelp reviews and one thing that came up a few times was the Chencho fries (fat/skinny) and of course I couldn't have left without ordering some. The Guacamole Boygers tasted really good and I especially loved the beef patty, I'm pretty sure it had jalapeno peppers or some think spicy in them.  The Chencho fries with cheese and all the additional ingredients were skinny fries which was good but because my sis had ordered fat fries I just stole some and made my Chencho fries great.  You should really order the Chencho fries fat, it takes another 5 mins or so but better than skinny. 

I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews, maybe the location is out of the way for someone like me, but it is definitely a place to try.

Four of us had the cheeseburger combo while one had the wings.  Everyone liked their food.  The burgers were simple but tasty.  The fries are steak cut fries that were seasoned well.  There was enough fries, but I wish it came with more.  There is something for everyone on the menu as they had burgers, pizza, burritos and everything in between.

In fact it was in an older neighborhood, that some may consider beneath them. But the truth is that it is on the corner of two main streets, it is a very clean center, with no sign of people loitering. Me and my girl felt very safe, and I had no problems leaving my convertible Mercedes in the lot. Now to the good stuff! The food! Their is a lot of items on their menu, and the seating area is pretty small. However the food is great, our burgers were cooked to perfection, and the flavor was excellent. Even the fries which I don't ordinarily eat were seasoned and cooked to a golden hue. Delicious! The service was better, and the price was shocking low. 

I always check the kitchen out from cleanliness, and it was near spotless. The employees were constantly cleaning when they were not cooking or taking orders. This is always a good sign for me!

It's lunch time so I check my bookmarks and what do you know? Fat Boy is right down the street. So off I go!

As I come in I hear Mexican music playing in the background. While looking at the menu on the wall, the lady behind the counter greets me in Spanish. I dont blame her cuz I kind of look like im Mexican. For a second there I almost ordered Al Pastor tacos. LOL.

So I ask the nice lady what was good since it was my first time. She said to go with the combo of the single Boyger, Chencho Fries and Small Drink. CHEN WHAT? She smiles at me and says, ""Chencho Fries: Your choice of fat or skinny fries topped with cheese, chicken bits, and a green sauce."" Ok! Combo it is!

I take a bite of the Boyger. I had to do a double take. Am I at Fatburger or Fat Boy? It tastes just like theirs but I paid 6 bucks and some change instead of 10 bucks or more. Now that I can get with. 

As for their Chencho fries, its basically an enchilada but with potato sticks instead. What I found out was that you should eat it right away because it tends to get soggy over time and it doesnt matter if you get it with fat or skinny fries. So if you are into green sauce, this will sure hit the spot!

Besides burgers, these guys have wings, chicken fingers and pizza. Not to mention sandwiches, boyrritos, and combination plates. Their pizzas must be good because when I was eating my food, this lady comes in and picks up 5 pizzas to go.
 
The minus 1 star is for their location. They are situated in one of many suites of one big building. The part of town they are in is kind of suspect. I can only assume what characters may come out at night. 

Some random info: They take cards and from what I noticed, there is no minimum. They have a decent soda fountain so you should be able to get your refills' worth. They got I would say about 6 small tables so if its packed, dont let it discourage you. You can always take it to go. There is a bathroom but you have to ask and then walk through the kitchen towards the back. Kind of awkward if you ask me but if you gotta go, you gotta go!

So whenever I have a Fatburger craving, im yelling out ""Fat Boy!"" because nobody  wants to eat at ""Skinny Boy"".",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,10,4,4,6tIzJ2kWmMmYirYSEJwTJQ

It's not made until you order it and everything here is made fresh, that's another thing I really appreciate. If it's your first time here, I'd definitely recommend the pastrami boyger or a Hawaiian boyger paired with their signature chencho fries. The pastrami burger is a burger topped with pastrami and it's always oozing with a white cheese. The Hawaiian includes all the typical burger ingredients with pineapple and barbecue sauce, it's exploding with a medley of flavors. The chencho fries can be ordered with fat or skinny cut fries and they're topped with cheese, green pepper, and little pieces of chicken; they're amazing but you have to eat them before they get soggy. The Philly cheesesteaks, pastrami sandwiches, and chicken fingers are also delicious. I've never ordered anything here that didn't make me proud.",cJr-hmFCCQFhRHFtsyNB-A,1,1,5,hornvUMAQJI5BsMn4YzK6Q

In any case, I'm adding a star for this visit because Fat Boy earned it on this particular stop; also, I notice the Yelp sticker on their front door.

I was born and raised on the East side, when a new food spot opens, I know about it. Plus they were/are big supporters of car clubs, and the local neighborhood in general. So yesterday while cruising around the old hood, it was one of 2 choices for me. Fat Boy won. 
Right off top they remembered us, AND what we usually order. Please note its been anywhere from 8 months to a year since I have been here. My bf and I brought his friend with us who was a newbie. I told him the entire menu is good, but a solid choice will always be a burger. EXCUSE ME, a BOYGER. Many choices, Cheeseboyger, Pastrami boyger, Bacon boyger. All come standard with mayo, lettuce, pickle, tomato and onion I believe, but they will customize it how you want. (my 2 favs are the bacon or pastrami) They also had no problem switching out my fries to a side salad in the combo. 
However, if you're a first timer, I say go for the chencho fries. I know some other yelpers weren't too impressed HOWEVER I think they are crazy and these fries are golden! You have the choice of fat or skinny. I always go with the fat, as they load them up with chile verde sauce, chicken, and melted white cheese which I believe to be jack but not 100% sure. They are better if you dine in, as they tend to get a little soggy in an unvented togo container.
The pizza is decent. They make the dough from scratch. Pretty much everything is made that way here. 
I personally haven't tried it, but a good friend said the beef mix plate is one of those things you eat and go home and take a nap after. The wings and fingers are also bomb, don't be a pu**y and go for the hot sauce. It is also made there and has this special tang to it.

Don't be fooled by the lack of decor or the tight dining area that only fits 27 consenting adults. The extremely friendly and outgoing staff greet you and help you make your decision to wage war against the American Heart association. Reviewing the menu alone caused my overall cholesterol to jump up 27 points. I ordered the double cheese boyger with all the fixings. That means a fried egg and a generous serving of bacon perched on what is already a bohemith burger. Made to order and served with brevity. The instance the boyger hit my mouth I immediately forgot where I was. eating the double cheese boyger was like reading an amazing book you didn't want to end. Every bite was full of flavor you can only find in places where the cooks truly cook with love and lard.

The price was extremely inexpensive and came in under ten bucks. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. If I may offer some advice, don't wear a white dress shirt with a fine tie.

3167865,2015-01-24,2,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"When you first walk in to Fat Boy, you might not expect much. With less than a dozen seats and maybe 4 or 5 tables, the place seats only about a dozen people or so. There's nothing fancy in here, just a menu board on the wall, a little 19"" TV and a soda fountain. But this tiny restaurant on the East side of town, just off Lamb & Stewart has got something way more important than that...killer food at crazy good prices! 

One of the other great things about Fat Boy is that it's also a family run business. On our last visit the owner was behind the counter taking orders and cooking, with his son running food out and busing tables. You can really tell they enjoy what they're doing and working together, and the love they put into their food shows. We've been here a couple times now and have gotten nothing but friendly, fast service.

The menu here has got a quite a few things on it. Some of the items are cleverly named with the restaurants theme, like the boygers and boyrittos. But that's just the beginning of a long list of things offered here, including salads, pizza, wings and fingers. I've been here a couple times now, each time having a burger and fries, but we've heard good things about other stuff on the menu. They even offer family meal style things like a 4 pack of burgers with fries and soda for a just tad over $20. It's hard to find this quality of food at the price. All the burgers are handmade and never frozen. 

I usually go with a pastrami burger and get the larger monster patty. For about $6, this is easily one of the best burgers you're going to get in town, especially at the price point. I normally like to have my burgers done medium rare, but I don't believe different temperatures are offered. Even still, the meat is tender, juicy and seasoned well. The pastrami is sliced evenly and piled on high. A slight toast to the bun gives a nice little crunchy texture to the whole thing. I also like that they just top it lightly with a bit of mustard and onion so that you can taste both, but it doesn't overpower the flavor of the burger or pastrami. They also have pretty decent fries and it's a huge plus for me that they let you choose between skinny or fat fries. We've tried both the chencho fries and pastrami chili cheese fries, both were ok, we just weren't huge fans of either. I like the fat fries the best and they are good enough on their own if you ask me.

All in all, Fat Boy is a super solid 4 star option for a great burger, sorry...boyger. If I lived closer, I'd probably go here over most fast food burger joints in town. And with such a large menu, I'd imagine you could host an awesome football party or something similar without spending a lot of dough either. Even with as far as we live, I wouldn't hesitate to come back. The foods great, the service is great and the prices are great.

My answer is, ""I will eat Fat Boy boygers from now on please."" If you haven't had a burger from Fat Boy, and you think you've had ""the best burger in town"", you're wrong. You haven't had the best burger in town until you've had a Boyger from Fat Boy. It trumps em' all. 

We've been coming here for years, and we never tire of it. For Fathers Day, this is where I want to go each year. 

It's a hole-in-the-wall mom-n-pop shop and is family run. Able and Co. are ALWAYS pleasant and friendly, who does a great job in juggling business and family. It's nothing to be in there on a Saturday and see Able come in with the little ones in tow, having just come from soccer games. He remembers us by name. 

The Boygers are amazing. Flat grilled, fresh, and juicy. Their veggies are always fresh. I love getting bacon on mine. If you don't like your bacon crispy, be sure to let em' know when you order. Otherwise crispy it will be (which is just they way I like it!!)

I have had the Pastrami sandwich, the Pastrami Boyger, their chicken fingers, their pizza, and their Hawiian Boyger. In all the years we've been coming here, I still haven't had the Philly Steak, but only because I lover the Boyger and the Pastrami so much, I have a hard time ordering anything else. Everything we've ever had here, is out of this world. It's the one place, literally, the one place, we can go as a family, and there is something that all of us can order and be exceptionally happy. 

Like fries? Their fat fries are BOMBER!!! And they are always too hot to eat when they bring them out to you. I'm a fry snob, and I love these fries!!

Being from the East Side, we really try to support East Side businesses, espically those that are local owned. As long as Fat Boy is here, we will be there with them.",LXLpxQAUz2Nu4o_OjOWl_A,3,0,5,jHBcDgAUqByLzg7kGLmc7A

Location: Shit location in a shit part of town. I don't care. I think I'm tough even though I am a short white girl who cries at Kodak commercials. Get real. Any neighborhood could be bad at any given time of day. This place is JUST FINE. 

The burgers taste like a backyard burger straight off the grill done RIGHT. Perfectly seasoned and the patty is not smashed or too thick. Both my biggest complaints about a burger. They don't even call it a burger because it's so cool. They call it a Boyger. Yeah boyeee! It's really nothing fancy, but it's exactly and I mean exactly how I like my burger. Please don't come here if you are expecting fancy. This sure ain't no supper club.

The fries. I swear the Chencho fries deserve MAD love. Like Quentin Tarantino movie love. Uma could order them and be eating them and then BOOM a huge ass ninja fight! Or cowboy zombie fight! I don't care, but some fight with the fries and the green chile sauce and melted cheese flying through the air in slow motion. I wouldn't wait for Redbox for that shit. Do it proper if you order these. You have a choice: Thin or thick fries. I went with thin and asked for exra crispy to hold up with the toppings cuz that's how I roll. PROPER FUCKING FRIES, SON.

Okay, I'm done. Just make the drive because it's cheap, it's real and even though I only went once I have thought about going back 100 more times....",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,20,20,4,WYPCsqaygLom6cKioIvC1w

After all the hype about how good my burger was the first time, my son chose a carne asada burrito. It was good, but if you are going to Fat Boy for the first time, I recommend a ""Boyger"". The burrito was more on the ""Americanized"" side, but good none the less. The ladies got burgers and were very impressed. 

I kept my word and saved room for a milkshake this time. We got a chocolate and a vanilla and split them four ways. Definitely enough for four people. They were both outstanding. Even the milkshakes here are some of the best I've ever had.

We arrived around brunch time on a Sunday and there was absolutely no waiting. The service was as friendly and efficient as last time. A few customers came in to pick up their phone orders while we were dining. Phone orders would be a great idea during the week, especially if you are under the gun with limited time for lunch.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a ""BLT Sandwich"" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for ""Chencho Fries"" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a ""Pastrami Boyger"" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on ""Pastrami Sandwich"" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14"" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,37,27,5,oAmOjb1mBDTB_ABVpcdeCg

The place itself is pretty small but there's enough room to eat where you don't feel squished by each table/chair.

I wasn't really hungry but I did order 8 hot wings. Can't beat the price! They are a mix of buffalo and Tapatio. Did not expect that but it was very much enjoyable thought I needed a few cups of water while getting through it.

The ladies looked busy, but still greeted us and at the same time, a whole group of kids came in for a bite after soccer practice. Next thing you know, the soccer coach is taking our order!?!?

He happens to be the husband/owner with his wife(and also works the evening shift at Fat Boy) who is busy busting out the kids orders, and her other worker is also family, and its also her birthday, so everyone starts singing Happy Birthday which truly brightens her day. I just love businesses that display a strong sense of family/community on top of serving up good, honest food.

I went with the owners suggestion of their popular Pastrami Boyger, and Wifey went with a Bacon Cheese Boyger, and we shared an order of fat Chencho  Fries. 
The fries were good, but not something I'd order again. The burgers alone are what I'd return for. They don't have crazy toppings and add-ons like the trendier burger joints, their burger meat is well seasoned and fresh, never frozen, and burger buns are delivered fresh daily. The price points for their items are crazy cheap too!
Went back the following weekend and tried their Guacamole Boyger and that was just as good!

Other reviews cap on their location but hey, they seem to be doing fine right where they're at, and being in business for five years, they must be doing something right!? I base my restaurant reviews on two things: FOOD and SERVICE atmosphere and location aren't an issue for me. It shouldn't be for you either, if you're looking for solid burgers and great service.

3784404,2015-12-28,0,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,Stopped by yesterday since we were on that side of town. It was amazing just like the first time. I ordered the chencho fries and the pepperoni calzone. The fries were the best as always and the calzone was really delicious. They were really generous with the pepperoni and the crust was out of this world. I do have one complaint. The calzone was pretty greasy. That doesn't matter though. I enjoyed my experience at Fat Boy and will return soon.,f2PQMfpf1We6QnkXQLv_OA,1,0,5,nWvlOKtp82M6YhB0yjQZmg

Now normally this is one of my fav spots....the burgers are soooo delicious and you have to try the Chencho Fries also, the owner is always super friendly and just a really nice guy.  But, they got a new cashier and she is HORRIBLE!!!! She NEVER smiles and always has an attitude.  Everytime i see her in front i know its going to be an additional 15 minute wait because she has no idea what she is doing and cannot multi task.  I am pretty sure she overcharged me today too.

I was reassigned a different location for work on Nellis so it's pretty much on this side of town. Finally came in on my lunch break and I ordered the burger and fries. I ordered ahead of time since I only have 30 minutes. To be honest, I was underwhelmed. This burger tasted homemade and to me that's not a good thing if it's something I can make at home. There was nothing special about it at all? No special sauce, typical hamburger bun, shredded lettuce and tomato. Umm did I miss something from all the reviews on how awesome the food is here. Although maybe I should of tried the checo fries or burrito? But the pictures look underwhelming as well. The inside is definitely a mom and pop shop, so it can use some upgrades or if they had the budget for it a major facelift would be even better. I'm not sure if the family that owns this place was working but the woman who rang up my food was friendly. If I give them another chance I'll be sure to ask Melissa Y. what to order since her review raves about this place.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,1,0,3,jMnMM-NVavAf8DDS2PjXzA

Chencho fries: fries in salsa and cheese, we got an egg on top too. It was an interesting concept, different from anything I've tried. I thought these were alright. The person at the register said people like to put pastrami. I think it could have used some meat and maybe some sour cream

Turkey boyger: very flavorful and cheap! I really liked it. It was juicy and I enjoyed the sauce!

1. The vastness of the menu! This joint has something for everyone.  They have burgers, pizza, chicken, and Mexican food all on their menu.  If you an't find something you like on the menu, you are definitely missing out!

2. The burgers (boygers) are yum-tastic! I  They are all super tasty and some of the best I have had in town.  They are also a great deal for the price point.  $3-5 for a freshly made burger is a-ok in my book!

3. The fries are great!  They have the thick, steakhouse stye fries.  A regular order comes with a fun season salt mix on them that tastes great.  You can also try their chencho fries that are covered in a green chili sauce and cheese.  They are a fun dish to chow down on for sure.

4. The prices are fantastic.  Your money definitely goes a long way here.  You can get a yummy lunch and be full all day for under $10 out the door.  They also have family deals like 4 burgers, 4 fries, and a 2 liter of soda for $18.  Not to shabby.  I always love great food for cheap.

Bottom line, I really enjoy Fat Boy and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty lunch.  If you are on that side of town, go check them out to make your belly happy!

Super, SUPER glad I finally got to finally try them out tonight.

My girlfriend and I went in at about 7:30p - with four people already at tables eating, the place seemed half full; there's not a huge amount of seating in there. It's very much a hole in the wall, but not run down or even remotely divey. It's very well-lit, and the dining area is kept very clean. The menu is posted on the wall, but we were quickly given printed menus at the counter, which contain a few items that aren't on the wall menu. The burger prices may seem a tiny bit steep at first, but when you compare them to fast food they really aren't that much different. The clerk/cook was very friendly, and quick to apologize for our short wait.

I ordered a Monster Boyger, my girl ordered the Double Cheese Boyger combo, and we shared an order of the Chencho Fries; I also had to indulge in a bottle of Mexican Coke to wash it all down. Everything was just stupid delicious. I've already told a few people that the burger is my favorite in town; seasoned well, stacked but not overloaded with toppings, and HUGE. You can definitely taste that they're homemade. The Chencho Fries were just as good, though next time we may add some bacon or something just a little salty to the spiciness.

I can't give it the full five stars, as I haven't gotten the chance to try any of their pizza or other sandwiches; if those are as good as their burgers, that extra star may get added sooner rather than later.

They forgot my ranch, which is ok because my fatass doesn't need it.

I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5, or a 7 out of 10, or a 49 out of 70 or a 77 out of 110. I'd recommend it if you live on the East Side/Sunrise of Vegas.

It was good, but it was alright ya know. It's like watching a good movie on Netflix on a really boring night. It's like the 2nd Fast and the Furious movie. You're like, ""I think I've seen this before."" But can't really point it out.

4655262,2017-06-14,7,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"When it comes to variety and delicious food, Fat Boy tips the scale. This is the original Fat Boy that has developed such a high reputation for its delicious food that recently they opened a second location in Henderson. 

Although this would be my sole visit to this Fat Boy, I had visited their Henderson location three times. These visits exposed me to tasty comfort food that included the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, pastrami sandwich,  monster cheeseburger, and fat fries. In similar fashion to a Beatles tune, everything was off the charts good. The Henderson Fat Boy is another review for another time. In perspective to this review, it was important to relate to the fact that I was so impressed with the food and service that I would try the original one when I was in the area. 

  It was a few Sundays ago when I was driving with an appetite on the east side of Las Vegas on my way home from Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge. A mental bookmark illuminated. It said ""Fat Boy."" 

  This mental bookmark was erased when I pulled into an old shopping center at the northeast corner of Lamb Boulevard and Stewart Avenue. It was a short walk to the original Fat Boy. My first impression was that if I was a Fat Boy I'd have trouble maneuvering around the place. It is a small space with a couple of tables and just enough room for an overhead menu above the few tables on the right. Having dinner in this small space, I observed that there is a need for a restroom. The small dining area is the antithesis of the large dining area in Henderson. The food is just as grand. 

  Decisions! Decisions! I decided on their Monster Cheese Boyger (they call burger boyger) combo. The kid asked my name. At Fat Boy they call your name when it's ready. At the Henderson restaurant they had said ""Bye Daniel""  whenever I left. The kid would tell me that it would be ready in about fifteen minutes. This brings up the point that Fat Boy is not fast food. Regardless that the setup is similar to a fast food restaurant, here the food is made after ordering. At the time I exchanged $8.24 plus tax for the Monster Cheese Boyger combo that included a fountain beverage and fat fries, they started cooking the food. 

  The fifteen minute wait was worthwhile. The Monster Boyger agreed with my taste buds. Two white buns anchored a thick burger covered with chipotle, mayonnaise, tomato, onions, lettuce, and ketchup. Sharing the same plate were the fat fries. This was a meal requiring napkins. I'd have to venture a couple of steps to the counter to ask for napkins. 

 By the time that I was in my car turning onto southbound Lamb Boulevard, it was with a satisfied impression of the original location. Fat Boy truly tips the scale when it comes to variety and good food. Ultimately when it comes to the Yelp scale, in my estimation the original Fat Boy weighs four stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,10,4,GwVQNnfpOA5MluUArMspew

Fat Boy is a tiny little restaurant that is hidden in East Las Vegas. The place seats about 15 people - it definitely has this homey, only-for-locals kind of feel to it. 

I had a guacamole cheeseburger with fat fries, and the boyfriend had a chicken burrito with chencho fries.  I was half expecting the food to be overrated, but I was amazed at how fresh my burger was!  And how much I love my fries!!! I ADORE FAT FRIES!!!  The fries have these seasonings on them that just make them super yummy!  And they were FAT and huge!  

The Chencho fries were covered with a green salsa and onions and cheese; it was yummy enough - a bit fattening though. 

I have suggested to return to this place numerous times after the first encounter, and that is pretty rare for me.  Enjoy!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,13,10,5,i2iJ_Mx_U3o6YHvanxFajg

5000858,2016-07-17,0,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"FatBoy is an excellent culinary experience here in Vegas. It is located about 10 minutes east of Downtown, in a small strip mall. It's a pretty small restaurant, where you order at the counter for take out or dine in. They accept cash and card, and there are no credit card limits (praise Jesus!). The sitting area sits ~20 max, and it looks out to the parking lot and open kitchen. Nothing fancy, just a classic mom-and-pop burger joint arrangement. 

I came in on a Saturday night about an hour before closing. There were about two other couple in there with me, so not busy at all. The cashier/""waitress"" (she brought my food to me) was a friendly young woman who provided great service and was very attentive. Food was prepared and presented in a very timely manner; about 7-10 minutes after I ordered it. So they were obviously preparing it fresh, but still attentive to their customers.

The menu is where they really shine. It's American/Mexican/Pizza which doesn't sound like it works, but they made what I ordered excellently.  I got the Boyger combo, which came with a burger with all the fixings (shredded lettuce, tomato, chopped onion, relish, pickles, mustard, and a special mayonnaise), steak fries, and a drink. It reminded me a lot of FatBurger, but less greasy and more affordable. It was excellent, and I'm wildly tempted to get another one right now after writing about it. They have a standard soda fountain with Coke, Diet, Sprite, orange, lemonade, and the Dr. Pepper knock off. It wasn't too overwhelming with choices, but not as limiting as the Costco fountain. Also, their Coke is almost as good as In-N-Out's, which is very high praise in my book.

The one thing they could work on (but not enough to knock off a star) was clarity on their menu. The menu is this huge printed poster that takes up most of one of the walls. It lists all of the options and the prices, but lacks a bit in descriptions. For example, they have a burger combo listed on the menu, which I correctly assumed was a burger, fries, and drink. But they have both classic and steak fries, which I was unaware of because it's not listed on the menu. They also have a bunch of different burgers, like a Monster, Hawaiian, etc. But there is no description as to what is actually on theses burgers. You can obviously ask the cashier for more clarity, but having a more descriptive menu would prevent lots of hemming and hawing when ordering. Like I said, small, petty nuisance, that doesn't affect the rating, but annoying enough that it stuck with me. 

Regardless of menu presentation, FatBoy is an excellent Vegas gem. The food is amazing, service is great, and ambiance quaint. They're expanding to a second location in Henderson, so definitely give them your business if you can't bring yourself to make the 20 minute trek to Downtown. But trust me, it's well worth it.",5lI9bnqtUC2pHkTspM4gOw,2,1,5,1BDUoOf04KmNwZthP8CmWg

We went around 12:30pm on a Sunday and wow they were packed. We were very lucky to get one table for two that we quickly converted for three. 

My husband and I both got the same thing, A Pastrami Boyger and their famous Chencho Fries. The burger was juicy and huge. It had a pile of pastrami and saut√©ed onions. What a great combo! When it came to the Chencho Fries we got them skinny, but for sure go with the fat fries next time. The fries were covered in a green chili sauce, little chunks of chicken, and jack cheese. All served with a fork. They were yummy. A very nice meld of flavors! 

My Dad got the 16 piece Hot Wings. He loves hot things and these had his eyes watering a little. He was very happy and said they were quite tasty.

Pastrami boyger: soooo so good. What I love most is you can taste the quality (no copyright infringement intended, in-n-out) because they use fresh foods & are made to order. 

Chencho fries: pretty yummy. I would recommend an add on or two. Their options are bacon, ham, or egg. Pastrami would probably be bomb on there. I'm still pretty satisfied with it though. 

Wings: I'm not crazy about their wings but I like that the hot sauce is actually hot & their bbq is pretty flavorful. At least you know there's no steroids in the chicken so that's always good.

I had been on the hunt for a family owned, divey burger joint and this place would come up over and over in conversations with friends and family. I finally decided to venture into this place when I moved to the east side. 

At first site, the establishment does not look that inviting because of the surrounding businesses. When you walk in, a very lovely pleasent aroma of hamburgers and pizza fills the air.You are greeted warmly by the staff everytime and if you come often enough, they remember your name and order. The menu has a good variety of burgers, hot sandwhiches and pizza. Also, they have the notoriously delicisous Chencho Fries! You get to choose from skinny fries or fat fries which really amazed me at the fact that I had a choice. They are covered with green chili and melted cheese which makes for a delicious flavor profile.

The burgers are fatty and juicy, just like they should be.  There is a nice crisp to the edges of the burger that add flavor and consistency...same with the bread.  It is most similar to In N Out, at least in comparison to other burger joints IMO.  They have a real home cooked taste. and it is very enjoyable.  Check out the pic :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-boy-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#9wpGkgWHLEg4sOX5uNnFaw

Ordered the chencho fries since everyone said to try them.  Sorry, didn't do much for me.  They come with chicken, cheese, and green chili on top of them, but the chicken is super tiny, and not grilled or anything, so they get lost in the sauce.  Grilling the chicken would add a nice consistency to the meat, but this is more like chicken in a can style.   I really like green chili, but I guess I don't really enjoy it on my french fries, and they got soggy pretty fast.  They weren't bad, but I wouldn't order them again.

Also, I asked for no lettuce/tom/onion on my burger, and they forgot about it.  Not a huge deal, but I haven't had an order wrong for quite some time.

And the neighborhood blows.  I won't hold it against them, but I doubt I will eat here after sundown LOL.   I will definitely be back when the sun is shining though!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,7,4,4,W49VqejkLzC8UpC83hJSWQ

The kind that taste totally different from a Red Robin burger and more than 3x the tastiness. I had myself a pastrami Boyger--super delish! I'm not a mayo fan,and even though I saw some of that gooey sauce Caucasian ppl go ape for, it was not a problem! The pastrami had a nice thin texture, but there was so much of it--I'm sure it made half the weight of my burger! AND OMJIZZLE GUYS!!ZUCCHINI STICKS!! they looked like little cheese sticks,so they were probably a little more processed than the ones you'd get at Farmer Boys,but their crunch and flavor was addicting! I'll go back for just those fersure! Alex grabbed a monster boyger, which was a typical burger,just more meat, but man oh man,I'm took a bite before I had a bite of my own burger and for a few seconds as I enjoyed that mouthwatering goodiness, I regretted my choice.

I ordered the double bacon with cheese, I know it sound like a lot, but I love burgers!  It was cooked medium well but remained very moist, with the juices running down my hand, in between my fingers as I took my first bite.  I love the addition of the tomato, pickles and shredded lettuce.  

Of course my husband had the monster burger and had to order the Chencho fries.  The thick cut potato strips where cooked crispy, lightly golden, and then smothered in green chili, chicken, and cheese.  All melted and gooey.

I was on the phone with grubhub for over 20 minutes but they did refund me. That's not the point though. As a paying customer I don't care who the F*ck it is you need to treat people with respect.

It's your typical in a strip mall place. Maybe 4 tables so take out is what they specialize in. They have a nice selection of burgers, pizza, and some mexican food. 

We ordered two guacamole boygers, and 2 cheesesteak sandwiches. I added a strawberry milkshake for $2.99 (good price). 

The boygers were ok. The meat is freshly pressed, but not seasoned much. Unfortunately, the cheesesteaks were not good. Small, little flavor, not much cheese. I would not order these again here. Very disappointing.

A very nice lady took our order, and the place is very clean. They weren't doing pizza yet at noon. Prices are very good and fair. You will probably find some items great here. Just not the cheesesteaks.

5837897,2012-06-03,3,95CCHowiE0W_ovv5-9lQAQ,"After reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a photo of a dripping Cheese Boyger, I was eager to try the food at this little eatery.  I took along Diane, another male friend who is always game to try a new top burger, and his burger-loving wife.  Even though the establishment wouldn't make any burgers medium rare, all of us were very satisfied with our burgers.  My Cheese Boyger with everything featured a quarter-pound beef patty prepared medium well, cool pickles, lettuce, a large slice of fresh tomato, relish, mustard, chipotle mayonnaise, and melted American Cheese on a soft bun, and I added some available Heinz Tomato Ketchup.  There was little American Cheese inside but the burger was still quite tasty.  

I also enjoyed Chencho Fat Fries that contained chopped chicken, Green Sauce, and melted Mozzarella Cheese spread over the fries.  I noted that the soft fries themselves absorbed some liquid from the other ingredients.

But I was really most impressed with my Wet Boyrrito with Beef, Red Sauce & Beans on the inside, and Mozzarella Cheese and Green Sauce on the outside.  This was one of the best burritos I have had outside of Southern California.  The Green Sauce was real good and zesty but not too spicy, small cubes of steak inside had a grilled flavor, the beans were small and tasty, and some of the Mozzarella Cheese melted nicely on top of the fairly large burrito.  I will likely come back for this.

So, while the Cheese Boyger and Chencho Fries did not blow me away, the Wet Boyrrito was a nice surprise.  And, I liked that the friendly cooks were willing to prepare a Boyrrito just as a diner would like it (e.g., with or without rice, beans, beef, or chicken, and with Red Sauce, Green Sauce, or no sauce).

The place is a small and unassuming storefront situated in the middle of a strip mall.  But it is comfortable enough, and free refills are allowed for fountain soft drinks.  Above all, the freshly prepared food is excellent, which should count the most.

We tried their one item carryout pizza special for $5.45, let me tell you, you get what you pay for. The pepperoni and cheese were so skimpy and non-existant. I ended up scraping the toppings onto TWO slices, the rest of the pizza/ scraped off dough were thrown out.

Fortunately, or so I thought I still had a BLT, the bacon consisted of little bits here and there. What happened to the fresh bacon? The long slices of bacon? Or plenty of bacon? They weren't in my sandwich, that's for sure.

Checho fries, yeah we got an order. $2.99 for a little to go box doesn't seem worth it. When I was there I saw a basket being delivered to the table next to me, I thought that was more like it, so unless you're eating at the restaurant pass on the Checho fries.

What caused this review to lose one star was the pastrami sandwich I had. It was a better than average and quite tasty. It was a little too fatty for my tastes. If they upped the flavor a little and got slightly better cut of meat then I'd go gaga overt it.
