The pork belly in the Bao was way too fatty...like...was there any lean meat? A good Bao should have a good balancd between lean and fatty. The short ribs burger didn't taste like short ribs, it's probably like a shake shack burger or something like that but not worth the price and I rather have the burger at a burger place. The crispy duck rice was the worst, crispy duck was not crispy, and had no flavour, it tasted like it was chucked into boiling water for 10 mins and that's all. Not recommended, at least to Chinese people like me.",kZDHtr8x4asoqwu0Wkub8Q,1,0,1,PdsxfacMNdUWV7lixzUp3A

-fat choy burger: I honestly like bachi burger better than this. This is just a regular burger with an egg added. If you're going there to try their burger, I recommend to go to bachi instead.

124320,2013-02-18,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"There seems to be a trend in Vegas where a slightly unique restaurant opens in town and everyone goes nuts over it for months on end. Case in point: Honey Salt, Eat, Poppy Den, any Gordon Ramsay Restaurant, and pretty much half the places on the Strip. And from my experience so far at some of these places, they're all overrated and honestly nothing out of this world. If you were worried that there weren't any new ones, along comes Fat Choy to kill your worries. On top of their 'famous' bao buns they're now offering a trendy burger to please the masses, so I headed over to see what all the hype was about.

Fat Choy is located inside the Eureka Casino, an overly smoky, tiny, awful casino in an older part of town. And when I say smoky, let's be clear, it's completely awful. Upon walking through the doors you get smacked with a wall of cigarette smoke the likes of which I haven't experienced since the last time I went to the Double Down. The building is tiny; the formula of a small space and a group of depressing looking old people smoking endlessly at slot machines makes this for the perfect whirlwind of awful. This smoke doesn't end in the casino, for when you walk into the Fat Choy restaurant space this smell doesn't dissipate. In fact, at one point while I was waiting for my food I marveled at the fact that I couldn't smell any food cooking, just more cigarettes. I didn't spend any more time in the casino itself other than walking through it to get in and out of the restaurant, yet my throat was noticeably sore by the end of my visit.

The restaurant itself has 5 bar seats, 5 booths and a handful of tables in a generically-decorated typical casino café style. There were 3 or 4 TV's in the space each with a different show on, and unfortunately the audio that was chosen for us to listen to was an episode of the Kardashians. Major points taken off for that. The menu is extremely simple: almost all Asian-themed items from potstickers, bao, rice & noodles and even the burger. There's also a breakfast menu with about six items on it that are as basic as you can get. We love a great pork belly bao sandwich, so we had to order them before our burgers. It was really good; the pork was extra crispy which I loved, and the peanuts were sparse but added a nice extra crispiness to them. Still, as good as they were I can't say they were worth going out of your way to try with several other bao options in town.

As for the Fat Choy Burger, it comes with 1/2lb of Angus beef, short rib, bacon, fried egg, cheddar and roasted tomato. Upon first bite you immediately notice how incredibly messy it is, maybe because of the short rib grease. The rib had really great flavor though, as did the super crispy bacon. The patty had good flavor, but seemed to be a bit of the generic pre-made variety. Still it was cooked very close to the medium rare I ordered. The egg was very large and had good flavor, with a bit too much lettuce as usual. I didn't notice anything special about the roasted tomatoes in the burger unfortunately. The bun was a bit thin for all this stuff, but fresh and fit well with everything else. Overall there were really good flavors that differed from bite to bite, but something about it felt like I was in a dive café in a dive casino, trying to out-do itself and make a tasty cult burger. I was, and for all their noticeable efforts I don't think they quite got there.

The fries were incredibly undercooked to the point that most were inedible. They were of the frozen generic skinny fry variety but I tend to like those if they're overcooked just right, and not completely raw like these were. In all I don't know if I get all the hype around this place. The bao was good, I'm no pro by any means but I've had better. The burger was certainly good, but nothing that stands out as being worthy to go into this awful smelly building ever again. My meal could have been made better if the fries were decent, but not enough to change my mind too much. So once again I've been able to experience a restaurant that everyone raves about yet I've walked away completely unimpressed and not willing to revisit. Maybe I missed something as everyone seems to think I did with Poppy Den, BurGR, Honey Salt and probably a few others, so venture here at your own risk.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,10,0,2,DvzV1kfqLuoxhSoONeLIkQ

When the very friendly waitress gave me the menu my heart fell. This is not an Asian restaurant per se but we were tired and starving and I was not in the mood to find another place. 

The menu is small (which is my preference) and offers a few starters, a few Asian inspired and a few sandwiches. We ordered potstickers while we were figuring out what else we wanted and they were quite possibly the best potstickers I have ever had in my life (handmade daily from the chef's grandmother's recipe).

I ordered the Duck with rice, my son ordered the pork belly sandwich and both were delicious. Seriously delicious!

211918,2013-04-30,5,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"I've been to Fat Choy 4 times now and have pretty much worked my way through the entire menu.  Rather then bore you with painstaking descriptions of each item in an attempt to sound like a connoisseur I'll make this brief; this food is crazy good, the service is charming and the location is ....the Eureka Casino.  I've read some complaints about the prices but I really don't understand it.  Given the quality of the food and a menu where entrees are all around $10 I'd rate Fat Choy as an incredible bargain.   I guess some of the old regulars might miss the $3 breakfast specials but  that was a different restaurant and this is a completely different level of cooking.  As for the Eureka casino the place is a dive but that's half the fun.  When you march your out of town guests through the casino to get to Fat Choy most will try to bail and head to the nearest Applebees.  But after dinner they'll be calling their friends to tell them about their adventure and how they discovered one of the best insider secrets in town.  Seriously the casino is smoky but they seem to be managing things pretty well in the restaurant.

Let's just get this out of the way: the only thing I did not like about Fat Choy was its location. Like many Yelpers have stated, the restaurant is located inside of the Eureka Casino & it is SUPER smoky! Maybe having a door would help? 

Aside from that, the food & experience blew me away - in a very good way! Our waitress Jenny was so friendly, attentive & gave great recommendations! Based off of her recommendations & my friend's prior experience from Great Bao, we ordered the pork belly bao, fried pork sauce noodles & grilled shortrib grilled cheese. The pork belly bao was so yummy! The pork was bigger than the bao (I'm not complaining!) & the pickled greens, cilantro & hoisin sauce tasted great! My friend had the fried pork sauce noodles where the noodles were cooked perfectly - not too hard, not too soft - just right. I might have to order it for myself next time! As for my order of the shortrib grilled cheese.. just think of a grilled cheese sandwich but better. Better as in, with meat! The shortrib was nice & tender. I am definitely a fan!

When we walked in it looked like a burger diner. Red shiny diner seats and booths on the side. Had a cool soda machine, it had push buttons on the machine for different sodas and such. Seemed like they had 12 different sodas. Pretty awesome to see haven't seen that much.

Tried a little of everything and tried as many dishes as we could:

Shrimp toast with egg was amazing. A simple dish but done perfectly and i was highly impressed

Roasted marrow with toasted bread was cooked perfect. They leave it in the bone of course and its a good serving size especially for marrow. Its not healthy so don't want too much anyway. It tastes amazing on top of the toasted bread.

Pork belly and duck boa were both great. Bao's were perfectly cooked and i really can say they did a great job with both dishes. Duck and pork belly were cooked to perfection and flavored just the right amount.

Sesame noodles was our last dish and it had the right amount of ingredients and the sesame oil was just the right amount. If you have ever cooked with sesame oil, you know that a little goes a long way and cooking with it is not easy. Dish full of veggies so made me feel a little better and if had the marrow and shrimp toast...healthy eating?

Would have been a 5 star but to me you need that WOW factor and i didn't get it as much as i think a 5 star deserves. Like i said strange location but bring you glock and go enjoy some great food.",BuyhJjFRLIXhp6WrTJfTUQ,1,0,4,KFXLucom-mVTK58ql2FvIg

do not order your main dish w appetizers .. the waitress we had said the food comes out when it's ready meaning apps w entrees! 

order ur app then when it arrives say u wanna order somthing else aka ur meal!! 

so i order a salad & the server says do you want chicken on it .. i say no bcz i'm going to get the chicken teriyaki .. w no rice double vegetables.. server doesnt tell me the vegetables in the chicken teriyaki are the same salad i just ordered!!!! wtf so she brings a salad then brings a salad w chicken on it-we are like wheres the steamed vege she says those are vegetables theres cucumbers & carrots and lettuce ya.. vegetables. i go the menu says vegetables shes like you want me to get you a menu? (says market vegetables) im like so you asked if i wanted chicken on the salad i said no bcz im getting teriyaki chicken- if you knew i basically ordered 2 salads why wouldn't you  tell me that.. shes like oh i dunno no ones ever ordered it like that before"" wtf! then my bf orders the duck n rice shallots on the side.. gets a bunch of shallots all up in the rice .. shows her after he ate some of the duck she's like oh.. he paid 2.00 for a fried egg on the rice & didn't eat it bcz of the shallots & she took the plate and charged us for the whole thing.. omg to make matters worse we understand fresh food takes awhile but we ordered pot stickers she says "" we are out"" so we order the soup as a appetizer.. 10 minutes after waiting i say i bet she's bringing the soup w the salad & all the dinners at once (hate that) so we tell her can we hv the soup n salad b4 the meal she says it's made to order you get whatever comes out when it's ready- so then she tells the cooks is there a soup back tgere i need a rush ( are u telling me they make each bowl of soup from scratch lady?? and throwing some lettuce n carrots together takes as long as a burger to cook)
she brings the soup & salad of which my little boy isn't having any and she leaves his burger & my bf's meal in the window w heat lamp w a lid  so after seeing the food sitting in the window for atleast 5 minutes i ask if that's my kids burger and she says yes & brings the food over instead of f'g asking when it was ready if my 9 year old wants his cheeseburger !!!

The dumplings were delicious but that's it. The Peking Duck and Pork Belly Bao was the worst I've ever eaten. Seriously. The hamburger was flavorless and greasy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is due to the dumplings and the service staff who recognized how disgusted me and my friend were and removed the items from our table and check.,wNeeZSfJRCJY7DeYt5eP0g,2,0,2,dOjieA59qyJ1hVup83h96A

507367,2013-07-06,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Went here for a late lunch Friday afternoon.  Had the duck bao, pork bao, and the grilled cheese.  We wanted to try the bone marrow but they were 86ed.  Both the duck and pork bao were delicious.  All the ingredients were super fresh and you could tell there was a lot of love putting them together.  The meats were juicy and perfectly cooked.  There was delicious duck fat dribbling down my arm when I took the first bite.  YUM!  The pork fat was melt in your mouth good.  
The short rib grilled cheese on the other hand, was disappointing.  The menu said cheddar cheese but to us, it really tasted like Kraft American slices.  I'm pretty sure I can distinguish the difference between cheddar and American.  Onion jam you say?  What onion jam?  Couldn't taste it.  The tomato dip on the side should be renamed ""warm jarred marinara"" as that's exactly what it tasted like.  I thought since there was so much TLC poured into the baos that maybe the owners would have done something unique for their fries.  But nope, they're just mass produced, store bought, frozen. 

Service was fine, I was expecting to have to wait for a long time after reading others' reviews, but maybe it was because there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant when we were there. 

The ambiance and location SUCKED!!  The restaurant is located in the Eureka Casino and it's an open door leading into the restaurant - It was seriously like sitting in an ashtray while trying to eat.  The smoke was overwhelming and it was hard to enjoy our meal. 

I'm not sure if I will be back - don't get me wrong..  the bao were sooo good!  But being a non-smoker, I'm not sure I can handle sitting in a gross old building with second hand smoke as my complimentary side.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,0,0,3,sFpyAGn4gC1ywfiY8yJu4w

531190,2013-04-10,7,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"If you're into cars, you're familiar with the concept of price-independent vs. price-dependent reviews.  For example: is the new Corvette better than the current Ferrari Italia?  On a price-independent basis, pffft, not even close.  But the price-dependent verdict?  Absolutely!  Is Fat Choy a better restaurant than, say, Joel Robuchon?  Uh ... NO.  But when you factor in price, yeah, I'll say yes, it is, because the average tab per person (tax and tip included) at Fat Choy is $15-20 whereas the average cost per head at Joel Robuchon is 25 quadrillion dollars (OK, slight exaggeration).

The quality of the food at Fat Choy is very good.  When you consider the bang-for-your-buck, Fat Choy is off the charts.  Where else in Las Vegas, or anywhere in America for that matter, can you get roasted bone marrow for $8 or duck confit for $12?  Those are the two menu items that I put in the gourmet category; the other two categories are Asian fusion and American standards.  I'm not a big fan of bone marrow; it's just a bit too rich and the flavor too strong for my tastes.  That said, I did think the one bite I got when my cousin ordered it was pretty good.  My cousin (who finished off every last bit of the marrow) was flabbergasted by the price, insisting that for a bone that large, he would expect to pay $20 at least.  But I am a huge fan of duck confit, and at Fat Choy, it's as good as I've had it anywhere else, with the bonus of an astonishingly low price.

In the Asian category, my favorite is the pot stickers.  It always baffed me that pot stickers are on every single Chinese restaurant menu in America because I've never much cared for them.  But wow, I love the pot stickers at Fat Choy.  The wrapper isn't gummy or rubbery like in every Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in, and the filling is leaner and more savory.  My other favorites are the sesame noodles and the fried pork sauce noodles.  The sesame noodles feature some mushrooms (I forgot which variety) that add a delicious layer of flavor to the sesame.  If you let the fried pork sauce sit for a couple of minutes, the noodles absorb all the deliciousness of the fried pork.  Both baos are great, pork belly and duck.  For a foodie on a budget (describes me to a T), the Peking duck bao is a real gourmet treat.  Again, how many places in Las Vegas, or anywhere else, can you enjoy gourmet quality for seven bucks??

The menu category I don't much care for is the American standards.  Don't get me wrong, they're done OK.  It's just that I don't like that kind of food.  But if chicken wings, spaghetti & meatballs, and cheesesteaks are right up your alley, you'll be satisfied at Fat Choy.

Much has been made of the smoke issue inside the Eureka Casino, which was described in a local magazine as the kind of casino where chain-smoking gamblers are surgicaly grafted to their favorite slot machines.  To borrow from the immortal wisdom of Bart Simpson: It's funny because it's true.  Fat Choy recently got a smoke-eater system, which has helped tremendously with the smoke issue.  I'll admit, I used to get pretty bothered at times by the smoke blowing in from the casino.  If you're extremely smoke-sensitive, the smoke-eaters might not be enough.  Actually, if you're extremely smoke-sensitive, you'll never survive the walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.  But for me, the smoke issue is now a non-issue.

The very short walk through the smokey casino is well worth it.  Besides great food at astonishingly low prices, Fat Choy has a passionately committed executive chef, Sheridan Su, and a terrific, warm, and friendly (genuine warmth & friendliness, in Las Vegas?) staff headed up by general manager Jenny Wong.  For any foodie, a trip to Fat Choy is a good idea.  For a foodie on a budget, it's an absolute must.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,11,11,5,lvXVV3ra-iQcmYHiQDwceQ

If I remember correctly the tofu & mushrooms were cut up but this time they put a slab of tofu which I prefer it cut up & mixed in with the mushrooms. The duck bao didn't taste as flavorful.

Avoid the short rib fried rice at all costs.  The beef was tough, and the rice, well, it was just white rice.  Not fried at all.

The best thing I tried was the short rib grilled cheese on sourdough.  The short rib was better in this dish because it had been shredded.

- duck baos: next time I would just fill up with these.

Our waitress Michelle told us how everything was cooked (both the techniques and the timing), but honestly I was so distracted by something going on at work that I didn't really internalize it; plus my expectations were so low. But man oh man, the bao was pretty solid, the short rib grilled cheese was pretty much heaven (not super hard to get right, but the short ribs were done really well, and short-rib-anything is such amazing comfort food), and OMG the duck rice. Super flavorful rice/sauce topped w a confit duck leg w a ginger/garlic sauce. All served w fries or salad. 

Will be back for sure. Bao $7, grilled cheese $10 I think, duck rice $12+$2 for egg.

907190,2014-04-13,1,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"So, I've been to Fat Choy three times. 
First: my husband and I ordered the famous bao, pork belly and peking duck. We both like the pork belly better, it's really really delicious and deserves 5 stars!

Second time I went alone and had Zha Jiang (ground pork sauce) Noodle. It was ok, not bad but it was too greasy and could use a little more heat.

Third  time I went there and bought the PBBLT to go. It was all good until I saw a HAIR!!!!! Could not revamp my appetite eventhough the burger was really tasty!

Long after that incident, I was in the area and decided to go again. This time I ordered Sunday's special which is Fat Benedict. It's 2 poached eggs, crispy pork belly, rosted english muffins with hollandaise. Sounds good, right? Right, except that the benedict never made it's way to me. I waited for around 10 or 15 minutes before Jenny came and told me that she forgot to put in my order but the benedict will be ready pretty soon. So I wait and I wait for another 15minutes. Then Jenny and the other waitress came up to me and admitted that there's been a huge mistake & they gave my benedict to another customer who just came in. She told me that if I wait again, she'll give my meal for free. Hell no, I don't have the time! So she wrote me a comp voucher ($10 value) instead. 

So between that last bad experience, the hair in my food, and the delicious bao; the question remains; will I go to Fat Choy again???",SHs7Nhjet02N-uVhblVzrA,3,0,3,ItDTVNQTLIJG1m4BJ4QI9w

992528,2013-06-18,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"One of the hottest restaurants around is located within Eureka Casino on East Sahara. Before Fat Choy, Chef Sheridan Su (former executive chef at Comme Ca) was serving Great Bao in the most unlikely place; a nail salon. I never tried it back then because I have an aversion to the smell. Dining with salon fumes never seemed appetizing in the least bit. I never tracked down the food truck, and it's taken me sometime to travel to the eastside, but I've finally done it. The Eureka Casino was nicer than I expected and I had heard interesting characters patronize the casino. However, on Sunday afternoon it was clean, quiet and no characters in sight. Not sure what it says about me, but I felt right at home. We strolled back to Fat Choy and took a seat. 

The waitress brought over menus; they had a limited selection and no rice or noodle dishes. We selected the duck bao ($7), and the tofu mushroom bao ($6) after she suggested it over the pork belly ($7). We also ordered the short rib grilled cheese ($10) and the nutella roti ($6) for dessert. We chose a plain old diet coke and diet dr. pepper from their new soda machine with dozens of flavors. Our bao came out first. Duck and pork belly were brought out. The order was wrong, but we stuck with it. The buns are steamed to perfection. The pork belly was fantastic, the fat rendered perfectly so it was rich, tender and filled with that wonderful pork flavor. I loved the freshness from the cilantro and greens, and the texture of the crushed peanuts. This was indeed great bao. The duck was delicious too. The hoisin sauce was light and didn't overwhelm the duck at all. Now, I'm curious how the mushroom and tofu bao would be. Tasty, I'm sure. 

The short rib grilled cheese comes with provolone and cheddar, onion jam and a side of marinara sauce. I'm a purist when it comes to grilled cheese; I'd prefer it with only one type of cheese. I thought the two cheeses made it a bit greasy, the sourdough bread grilled beautifully and the short rib was tender and flavorful with the onion jam. The marinara was thick from the tomato paste. Again, not my preference, but still all the components make and enjoyable sandwich. My husband liked it just fine. My tastebuds just didn't concur. There was nothing notable about the fries. 

The Nutella Roti had me intrigued, nutella, mascarpone, honey and walnuts on roti... what's not to love? The wait, as it turns out. We waited and waited and waited. We would've cancelled had our waitress been around. She conveniently disappeared. We waited and waited some more. It was ridiculous. We asked the other waitress and she said it would be right up. We waited and waited. Finally, the pancake topped with goo was brought to the table. The pancake was incredibly greasy, aside from that the flavors were pretty good, but definitely not worth the wait. I could be more forgiving if it were busy, but we were one of three tables. I'd hope they weren't that far in the weeds with seven diners.

Our patience wore thin; we refused to be held hostage for our bill so my husband went to the counter to take care of it. The eats are pretty darn tasty. I'd return for more bao and I'd love to try the duck rice and potstickers. I certainly hope service will be improved.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,8,3,3,MeX5kVSQa_F2i8R_PRGSyA
1020993,2013-06-23,2,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Went here for the 3 for $10 bao special and the fluff ice was an extra added bonus. I enjoyed the 3 baos, duck, pork belly, and the crispy soft shell crab. My favorite was the soft shell crab, so unique with it's soft sweet bao texture, then the light and crisp crunchyness of the soft shell crab. 
I also tried the Fat Choy burger. It was cooked perfectly medium. The patty is quite thick and beefy with the yummy shredded short rib meat on top of the patty with crispy bacon and a runny fried egg. Perfectly delicious. Also the fries were cooked as an art form!  They were skinny fries that were crisp on the outside and nice and buttery on the inside, like eating a fat fry, only it was a skinny fry. This chef really knows how to make fries. 

Fluff ice guys are only here for a limited time, at the time of this review fluff ice is leaving on 6/23/13 to go back to Cali:  Then for dessert I had to have a fluff ice drink with egg pudding. I usually get my fix in california, but hey, if the egg pudding comes to you in vegas, why go to cali?  I got the large egg pudding and lychee jelly drink which was a little sweet at first because I didn't mix it. Once you mix it, it is a great balance of sweet and savory. They should team up with Fat Choy and make a Fluff ice with crispy bacon, that sounds good. 

To adress it being inside the Eureka casino, there is a guard in the parking lot, and the casino really wasn't that smoky on a friday night. Inside the restaurant I couldn't smell any ciggy smoke at all.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,6,5,5,72M3CEJGqq2mZ2PwhKKYHQ

1057586,2013-02-27,1,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"The stars don't tell the whole story. I know people look at three stars and assume ""Oh, it isn't worth my time."" Not true. Yes, this place is a dive. Yes, it is filled with smoke. Yes, the location isn't...ideal. But folks should still check this place out. in spite of the reviews. And yes, in spite of the smoke. 

We only had three items on the menu. We had the short rib grilled cheese, the duck bao, and the pork bao. 

The food was very tasty. The bao was thoughtfully prepared and the meat in each was seasoned well. That crispy skin and moist meat drew me into both bao options. They were solid. The grilled cheese sandwich was gooey and flavorful. And the bread was toasted perfectly and the meat inside was generous and just sweet enough to cut through some of the heaviness of the sandwich. But it was too greasy for me. I was good at the first few bites---I should have stopped there and tried another dish. 

Here is the part that you might not understand about this place--there is a heart to the food that cannot be dismissed on the basis of grease, and location, and even smoke. Even without knowing the owner's story (see other reviews) you can taste the thoughtfulness and energy in each bite. These dishes were not thrown together in an attempt to get doors open. They were crafted and tweaked to achieve a specific balance---even the greasy grilled cheese (which was very well flavored, by the way). 

I cannot imagine the pressures that a small restaurant has to endure in that kind of setting (small locals casino). I saw people wandering in during a break in their slot play to have a burger followed closely by what looked to be Yelper hipsters looking to try the newest location.  Fat Choy has a diverse audience to consider and I am willing to cut it some slack in its efforts toward making their new location work for their customer base.

I think this business is worth the trip to the Eureka Casino. I think it's worth battling the smoke and stepping over some colorful locals. I admit something about the story does appeal to me.

This time around, the prok belly bao was delicious, but the duck bao and the potstickers were mediocre.

I was actually surprised at how nice the space looked.  this might be due to the fact i was at Eureka several years ago and the place looked like a dump back then.  Maybe it was a slow day since there was little in the way of smoke.

I went with the short rib grilled cheese and based on the servers recommendation, sourdough bread -  $10 includes fries.  My buddy went with the cheesesteak.  Chuckled at the diet coke served in what had to be a 32 ounce glass beer mug ... do they serve beers in those mugs ?!?

The grilled cheese was decent - my only beef ( get it ? ) was the short rib meat - it tasted great but it was not spread evenly on the sammie - in fact, almost all of it on one side  - strange.  Fries standard frozen out of a bag and into the fryer.  Have to ding a star for the price .

The cheesesteak was average but then again, who goes to fat choy for a cheesesteak ?

1231999,2015-05-02,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Vegas is full of hidden gems, and this is one of them. Nestled inside the small Eureka Casino is a cute American-styled diner wirh a decidedly Asian flair.

I had two ""snacks"" as my entree: a pork belly bao and a Peking duck bao. Both had perfect ratios of fillings to steamed buns, and while I thought I would prefer the duck, I actually liked the pork belly better. There were two baos per serving, so these four small sandwiches were a perfect portion size.

My husband had the Fat Choy burger. He lives by the credo of ordering a restaurant's namesake dish, and his gut served him right again. That was one delicious burger, topped with bacon, short rib, cheese, tomato, and a fried egg. It was one of the sloppiest burgers I've sampled, but also one of the best. And, surprisingly, the hit of the meal for me was the side of fries that came with the burger. Thin cut and seasoned with salt and pepper. Get a little burger drippings on 'em, and you're good to go!

Our waitress was super friendly but not overbearing. And while the drinks were kind of pricey, a table of nearby diners grabbed a couple of pitchers of beer from the nearby casino bar. Savvy!

A combination I never thought would taste so good and to my surprise became my favorite snack item. Unfortunately this dish was only temporary and is no longer on the menu, but I really hope they bring it back! The chicken teriyaki rice was another great dish. Lastly, The Fat Choy Burger my favorite of all. This consists of onion jam which is soooo good, fried egg, and of course bacon!! It's so messy but so worth it!

It will take a GPS to find them if you are a traveler.  They casino was not very noticeable with brown camouflage color and a rear entrance.  Fat Choy did not stands for a fat Chinese guy named ""Choy"" found this place, it translates to ""Getting Rich"" in Chinese.

Since they called themselves fusion, we got things from the two world...  Pork Belly Bao, Peking Duck Bao, and a Fat Choy Burger.  The baos were excellent, I think I like the pork belly one much better.  The peking duck one was good in general, but it just reminds me of the false peking duck dish that used the wrong bread.  Burger was great, and the egg really enhanced the overall flavor.

I failed to see how anyone could hate the drink selections, they got a freestyle coke machine here, I wish it is a self-serve instead of having to wait for the server, and it was a bit inconvenience to ask them to switch up the flavor every time they refill my cup.  (eg. Peach flavor first time, Grape the next cup, and Orange for the third)  Service was excellent, the Chinese lady that served us was a bit aggressive in getting feedback from us for unknown reason, probably because we told her we found this place on Yelp?",B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw,2,2,4,ewqxDb_xXqFPIO1JZp-MJQ

Went inside and this was my first time to a casino with no hotel connected to it so there were only slot machines- no table games. But there was a good variety of machines. 

Went toward the end of the lunch crowd so our wait was quick we just had to wait to for table to be bused. Out waitress came right away to take our drink order and she was able to answer our questions about nuts in the kitchen since my daughter is allergic to tree nuts. Drinks came quickly and she took our order and answered our questions

Food took a little while because of the Fat Benedict since everything is made to order. My duck rice was delicious and I cleaned the plate. The duck had excellent taste - not a game taste like some duck has. The duck went perfectly with the rice but next time I will have them add cilantro. 

The Fat burger was excellent my son shared a small bite with me since he cleaned his plate also.  The Fat Benedict had a little to much of a cheesiness taste for me but the combination with the pork was excellent.

Fast forward to 2016, where Great Bao became Fat Choy and I'm pleasantly surprised to experience that all the great things I heard 4 years ago are still true: tasty food and super nice owners.

My favorite bites were:

-grilled cheese short rib: I know, those are two rich ingredients and I had my doubts at first, but wow, the combination together is just heavenly, and surprisingly not super heavy at all. The stand out was the housemade ""ketchup"" which reminded me more of a thick tomato soup flavor. It was perfect with the cheesy sandwich

-sesame noodles: a tie for my favorite dish on the menu. It's hand pulled egg noodles tossed with vegetables and delicious sauce. For being a noodle dish, it's extremely light and they can even make it vegan using udon noodles

-pork belly bao: the name sake for the truck and it was bomb

-potstickers: a great starter and comes with a housemade soy sauce dipping sauce

Lastly, the super nice owners, I had a chance to sit down with co-owner Jenny Wong for an entrepreneur interview and she is kind, welcoming and truly passionate about her business. It's her livelihood and she cares about the customer experience. Definitely go check them out. Don't be off put by Eureka Casino.

The patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and there was an egg on it, but that's about all I can say- visually, yes, there was short rib, but it didn't have any flavor. The other ingredients mentioned on the menu, bacon and roasted tomato? So sparingly applied that I didn't even detect them. Niyen's original description includes onion jam, and that is now missing from the menu altogether, but that bright bit of acidity would have cut through the fat and added a pop of flavor. As I ate this burger, I was asking myself why I was continuing to eat it. That's how underwhelming it was.

The bao aren't noteworthy either, though. Everyone does a pork bao so I opted for the peking duck and the tofu-mushroom versions here. Visually, the tofu-mushroom is already unappealing, with a square sheet of tofu falling out of the bao and minimal stringy mushrooms. Taste wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about this to any of my vegetarian friends. And the duck meat on the other bao was dry, accompanying sauce was unremarkable. Everything was very one-note.

Service was polite. I'll add that if you sub a salad for your side of fries (with the burger), it's literally a handful of spring mix salad blend: no tomato, no cucumber, nothing else at all added. 

If using a card, payment is processed through Square (or a similar product/service), and you are presented with a tip percentage page- I'm kicking myself for selecting a $3 tip for absolutely zero service and mediocre food to boot. Never again.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,4,2,2o250V9vZ2Z2qdfZr6_ghA

I just had a salad wedge tonight with dessert.  The salad wedge was much more than I anticipated.  The bacon was very generous and thick.  What is not good with bacon?  I ate most of the salad.  I even ate some of Tom's fries when he wasn't looking.  

For dessert, I was not going to be satisfied unless I had chocolate.  So I ordered the Nutella which is somewhat like a little dessert pizza with hazelnuts crumbled on top of the nutella spread.

SOFT-SHELL CRAB BAO!

Now, normally that's all I would need to say concerning this matter and just walk off leaving this review just like that.  But, it bears emphasizing that not only did Tom create one of the most unique sandwiches I have ever eaten, but he also created an experience that I never had before. The lovely Emily, the server, who very promptly greeted me upon entrance to Fat Choy located inside near the back of the Eureka Casino made sure I had a nice seat at the bar and there my feast began. 

I actually came in here to grab one of the legendary Pork Bao sandwiches along with an order of the Short Rib Grilled Cheese sandwiches to go.  But, my entire plan got spun around when Emily suggested that I atleast try Tom's tender, delicately crunchy, and generously meaty Soft-shelled crab creation. Yes. You heard that right. It was a perfectly cooked SS crab stuffed mercilessly inside a freshly steamed bao bun.  And baby, it was out of this world!  Easily the best 8 BUCKS spent on a sandwich that could probably sell for 10-12 on the Strip.  Say what you want about the neighborhood, the casino, and the 'decor', but......these people sure can cook at Fat Choy!

Just instruct the waitress to separate the salad from the braised beef and rice so the balsamic vinegar doesn't cross over to the tender beef! Kudos to the friendliest waitresses especially Tammy .

Service was so great. The waitress had great recommendations and was enthusiastic.

Who wanted taste all of the selections. I asked if we could have one of each in the set of 2"". Which I was positive I had it that way before, (I come here at least twice a month). Val advised that could not be served like that the chef is adamant about that. I told her I was confused because just last week I was there and she served me and we had duck and pork belly Bao . She went on to tell me with not so nice attitude that she has worked there for 2 years and never has she served me this way. My friends were so offended with her attitude. That they decided to leave and have lunch else where. Service is everything to me, that adds to the experience. Last weeks lunch mate made the same remarks about Val's service.

So one day I was looking through Yelp and stumbled upon this place of super good reviews and thought, why haven't I heard of this place before?! I absolutely love and sort of Asian fusion so I got super excited as I read through the reviews and looked at the photos - I bookmarked it right away and told my bf we were coming here for dinner! 

We followed the directions and winded up at such a random location - Eureka Casino  (a stand alone casino in a not so great part of town) hahahah. But we were like we gotta see what this hype is about!!! So we went into this small casino and there it was, Fay Choy. It looked like an old, diner-style restaurant with old school diner booths. Interesting ambiance to say the least. Anyway, the waitress handed us menus and we could decide what to get cos there was so much I wanted to try. We ended up getting an order of the Pork Belly Bao (YUM) ugh so nommy. The bao was perfectly made. Some restaurants mess up and make the bao a little too dry, or flaky, but here it was perfect! We also got the Braised Short Rib Grilled Cheese..... Omg my love for grilled sandwiches got even stronger after this one!! I mean, I LOVE short rib and I LOVE grilled cheese so when I saw this as one thing I had to get it!! My boyfriend got the Fat Choy burger, this was good too but not the bessst burger in town, still good tho! Our experience was great, service was awesome. Definitely will be coming back to try more!!

One bite of this crispy, cheesy yummy goddess will send you to fat boy heaven. Ask for some their ranch (which is so good) and you won't believe that you are eating something so good...yes it exist!

1975919,2014-02-07,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"A bright gem tucked into an otherwise dark space.

I almost did a double take when I saw where this restaurant was located - tucked inside the Eureka Casino just on the edge of the commercial center.  Its certainly not the nicest part of town (and that is putting it nicely), but in a way this is something that I liked about the space.  Its in the heart of the city, and like any city not all of it is pretty and glamorous.  Also, rest assured, the parking lot is well lit and there is a good security presence such things go awry.

Once inside Fat Choy, it does a decent job establishing its own unique brand outside of the normal casino cafe.  The room has personality that matches its menu.  Our waitress was nice and had a lot of knowledge about the menu.  She recommended the Pork Bao, the duck fried rice, and the special - bone marrow.  I happily ordered all three.

The Pork Bao, a delicious piece of pork wrapped in dough and smothered in relish and peanuts was something out of food lover's day-dream.  The moment I took my first bite I forgot everything about the seedy casino we were sitting in.  I was instantly happy with my choice to dine here.  And I quickly asked for another order as soon as she could bring it.

The duck fried rice was a wonderful mix of rice, perfect duck leg, and salad greens.  I ordered it with a fried egg on top, again from the waitresses recommendation.  Really good flavors.

Lastly, the bone marrow.  I'd read you had to order it when it was on special, and I followed direction.  It was much better than I though, a half-ox bone cooked well and smoothed in sauce.  It comes with a side of fresh toast to spread the marrow on.  It was meatier than I expected, with FULL flavor.  Surprising and unique.

I plan on coming back just for this bright gem.  If you want to try something new, brave the location and give this a try.",3Apvsrrf4wJuG4NdwIfXwA,5,0,4,E3JOZhL8IPAzynjGO26gLA
1983463,2013-09-04,3,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Fat Choy is a hidden gem of a restaurant located inside the Eureka Casino on Sahara. We have been here a total of three times now, twice dining in and once for a takeout order. The first time I ate here with my husband and friend (she had no idea what to expect but she trust my judgment). You seat yourself I try to get the back booth because the smoke is pretty heavy in the casino, but I've never smelled the smoke in the restaurant itself.

We started off by asking the waitress about the soda machine. She pretty much told us that you could get any soda flavor combination you can imagine except for cream soda. Our soda's came out in HUGE 32oz glass beer mugs with free refills. We ordered two servings of ""Grandma's Potstickers"" My husband and friend ordered the Fat Choy Burger, and I ordered the Sesame Noodles, and Short Rib Grilled Cheese.

It takes a while for the potstickers to cook, so be patient. Our waitress served our potstickers and said, i quote ""I'm so excited for you to try these!!"" They come five to an order, with a side of ponzu sauce with garlic, green onion, and a hint of balsamic vinegar. The first bite just blew my mind. The outside was perfectly pan seared in sesame oil, and great pork filling. By far the best I've ever had!

Next the entrees came out shortly after. My husband's and friends Fat Choy burger came out. It comes on a soft bun with perfectly cooked medium rare sirloin beef  (if requested), short rib, bacon, cheddar, roasted tomato, and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, which my friend commented ""It looks like an eye staring at me!"". LOL!! It was huge, juicy, and sloppy. One of my husband's favorite burgers.

We shared the Sesame Noodles, which came with roasted wild mushrooms, cucumbers, carrots, peanuts, and sesame vinaigrette which had a bite to it with Sriracha. One of my favorite dishes. Very addicting. My friend was saying she didn't like noodles too much but she was sure stuffing them down like nobody's business. LOL!!

The Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Onion Jam, Provolone, and Cheddar cheese was good but not my favorite dish on the menu. I will say the Onion Jam was interesting, never had it before. My third time here I tried the PBBLT, with pork belly, bacon, tomato, lettuce, sriracha mayo. Huge portion of pork belly!! Can't wait for my  Father-in -law to try this!!

My husband and I keep craving this place. We came here the next day for takeout (I would recommend eating it fresh however) The food is top notch 
for a small establishment. The waitstaff is friendly, the prices are very reasonable for the large portions you get. Till next time Fat Choy!!!",nOIaazW2_RJ08O0U79SeWg,5,4,5,2L157p7zsnXujSEgHnCkyg

Next we had the sesame noodles with an egg and chinese sausage which was suggested by Tanya. That dish was just as tasty as the pork bao. Last we had the short rib grilled cheese on sourdough.

There are no shady characters.  People writing all that are just babies. I hate cigarette smoke, hate it.  And after reading these reviews, I was prepared to hit a wall of smoke and smell like I was in a casino for eight hours when we got there.  Soooo, not the case.

The parking lot is fine?  Lighted, security guy, it's not the ghetto, people?  Grow a set, will ya?  Park in the lot, go in the back entrance and the restaurant is on the right.

Everything was delicious.  Not only was the chef on Diners Drive In and Dives, but Chopped too.  And he rules.  Everything was so good.  The noodles had a spicy kick - and I could eat them every day.  The Bao, with their steamed buns - so fresh, so tasty.  They are listed under the ""Snack"" part of the menu - you get two and it's a great start for the huge bowl of noodles you get or the serving of duck fried rice.  Great portions.

The sesame noodles were a tad over cooked and a little soggy but overall pretty good. The shortrib grilled cheese were quite tasty with the short rib definitely the star of the dish.

We had no problems with the service. Tammy was attentive and gave recommendations to our dishes. 

The biggest issue I had was the cigarette smoke. Now keep in mind I'm from Boston and definitely not used to smelling cigarette smoke at all nonetheless inside.

Don't expect anything classy there. It's a super small yet super clean joint, with a short menu (which I always like since it usually shows they're not just using microwaves to prepare the food). If you want anything alcoholic, just go to the casino's bar and bring your glass back in. They don't serve alcohol inside the restaurant.

Like most everyone says in their reviews, it is located in a pretty random spot. I've been living in Las Vegas for most of my life, and have never even heard of Eureka casino. I've driven past it quite a few times, and yet never noticed it. 

To say the least, i was pretty disappointed in the service that I received. The waitress had come to our table, asked for drink our drink orders. My friend and I both ordered a coke. Five minutes later, she brought 1 drink out. What?! She set it down without acknowledging us and walked away immediately. Why she thought that only one of us wanted a drink, I'll never know. It's not like we had waters on our tables or any other drinks with us. She finally came back about 7 - 8 minutes later to take our food order. I ordered the Pork belly BLT as well as ordered the shrimp toast as an appetizer. The waitress came back probably another 10-15 minutes later, and informed me that they can't make shrimp toast anymore. Why it took that long to inform me, I'm not quite sure. There were only two other diners in the restaurant, so the kitchen couldn't have been that busy. It shouldn't have taken them 10 minutes to realize that they couldn't make an appetizer. 

Food was decent. The pork belly on the sandwich was amazing. The only downfall to the sandwich was that my bread was rock hard, leading me to believe it had been sitting in the pass for quite some time. Disappointing to say the least. 

Three stars for the food, and the food alone. Wish i could give it more, but rock hard bread? No thanks. Bad service. Bad experience.

We had the Chicken & Waffles and the Three Little Pigs. The fried chicken was wonderfully seasoned and crispy. And the crispy pork belly, was of course, a pleasure to put in one's mouth. But, and this is a disappointing ""but"", both the pancakes and waffle were confusingly chewy. This, we could only guess, seemed to be because they were not made fresh? Not sure.

2290102,2014-08-07,4,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"I'm not too sure why this place has a 4 star rating and some great WOM recommendations.  

The decor of this place is like a diner.  If I blind folded you, sat you down at the table, and removed the blindfold, you'd be ready to order an omelet with an extra side of bacon and sausage.  

Fat Choy describes itself as Asian-American fare; it has very traditional Asian foods on the menu and then it throws in very traditional American fare such as burgers and chicken wings.  I really don't get this ""synergy"" if any, but whatever, it's not a plus or a minus really.  Maybe you want to get some bao and you can convince your friend to come for the burgers and wings.

We ordered the pork belly bao, the shortrib rice, chicken teriyaki rice, and 2 orders of Grandma's Potstickers.

Pork Belly Bao:

The wrap itself was good, the flavor of the pork belly was great, but the pork belly was dry as it was a bit overcooked.  Overall it was decent, but not great.

Shortrib rice, and chicken teriyaki rice:

I lumped these together because they both had similarities, although the styles are supposed to be totally different.  The similarity here is that they both came with a salad with balsamic vinegar WITHIN the dish.  Wtf, this does NOT go with the flavors of either dish at all, and a salad wasn't mentioned on the menu for either dish.  If I had known it came like that, I would have ask for it on the side.  No veggies were mentioned for the shortrib rice, and market vegetables were mentioned for the chicken teriyaki rice.  The shortrib itself was actually really good, but the rest of the dish was mediocre.

Grandma's Potstickers:

Nice pan fried crust.  Definitely a fan of that.  But the filling?  Yo, if my grandma came out with this I'd tell her to get back in the kitchen and work on the damn recipe because yo, where's the flavor?  Kidding, my grandma would slap the dumpling outta my mouth and make me wash the dishes afterwards.  But seriously though, very disappointed in the filling as this dish was hyped up and it was only OKAY.

All in all, this place gets three stars because the dishes are just okay, and the prices are commensurate with what you get in my opinion.  Would I come back by myself?  Nah.  But if a friend wanted to try it out anyways after I tell them how mediocre it is, meh, sure why not, might as well try out the American side of the menu.",0ge1098FnaWkVQ2IQuXNbA,1,0,3,6s2LE4pWPWjqyM8hiCNqYw

After recommendations from my sister and how she kept stressing how good this place is. I've decided to go here for breakfast. Located inside the casino, so it smells like cigarette. 

It looked like an American diner. The lady in front greet us and said we can sit anywhere. So we sat down and look at the menu. There wasn't much to choose from but my sister recommended the pork belly bao. I love pork belly so of course I would order the pork belly bao after hearing raves about it. I also ordered the Peking duck bao. My boyfriend order the fat choy burger. The burger wasn't anything special. It was okay. The Peking duck bao was delicious. Though I love everything pork belly I enjoyed the Peking duck bao more when I don't like duck as much. 

If I'm back in vegas I would definitely stop by fat choy again because I love their pork belly and Peking duck baos.

2360892,2014-01-02,5,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"After parking your car and before entering the Eureka Casino take a deep breath, pinch your nose, and hold it for about 5-10 secs or at least until you take a seat in Fat Choy.  The smell of smoke from BBQ is good, the smell of smoke from cigarettes/casino is bad. I never made it to the tiny Great Bao location so this was first experience eating any of the chef's creations.  I remember seeing him on TV and enjoyed his story so I felt like I had to try his food. 

On my 1st time the bad casino smoke did a number on me, my eyes were irritated, I had a bad taste in my mouth, and my nose was stuffed. I sat as far as I could away from the entrance but it still had the smell. I originally went with some short rib dish which was about $14 but then I saw that there some pork belly tacos on a chalk board menu for $7 and had them change it.  It was 3 pork belly tacos, slaw, salsa, and fries. I wasn't a fan of any of it, maybe it was the smoke still messing it up. The pork belly pieces were pretty dry and tasted just like cooked unseasoned pork belly. The slaw tasted like the one from KFC which I didn't mine but expected more.  The salsa was bad and fries came out almost at the end when I was almost already done.  Actually I didn't feel like I would ever be back after this visit. 

The 2nd time here went better, joined some friends for dinner. I went away from their special chalkboard menu and ordered the fat choy burger. Most of the tables went with their various signature dishes which included the fat choy burger, short rib grilled cheese, bao, etc. The fat choy burger was enjoyable but I wasn't wowed. It was a 1/2 burger, short rib,  bacon, a fried egg, and the burger usually ingredients between a bun. You'd think with ingredients like that in a burger it would be a freaking amazing but it wasn't for me. I've had better for the similar price. I think it was about $10.

The 3rd time, whenever it happens, will hopefully be the charm lol. I won't try the short rib grilled cheese, don't think I'll like it but not a big grilled cheese fan and it didn't look I'll like it. Maybe I'll stick with their money item the bao, which for some reason I still haven't had even when I've been meaning to try. The only difficult part is I just have to decide on which baos I'm getting. I also have to remind myself to hold my breath while walking through the casino.

Their menu and the pictures posted look good. The staff is friendly and the environment is good, besides the smokiness which I heard has gotten better. But for now I have to give them a 3 point something, 3 1/3, 3.33333 with the bar on top Star which is still good, it's Ok and a lot better than that 2 star meh.

There's some drawings on the wall, it's not fancy but includes things of their past. Double check for specials either on the wall or social media, I'm sure they'll let you know but just in case they don't.

Thinking about it I believe I already been here for a 3rd time but I don't remember it. lol",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,6,7,3,yisCNFfzxb8Yp9kQdiCXYQ

The fries were so nasty we couldn't eat them. We also ordered the Shrimp toast. It was super fishy which I like.

It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night around 7pm and we were able to sit down immediately. Both of the waitresses (I think one was an owner, Jenny, actually!) were warm and gave great service throughout our visit. They didn't mind that our entire group of 4 wasn't present and allowed us to order some appetizers while we waited. We ordered the pork belly bao, the pot stickers, and iced tea. I had been craving unsweetened iced tea and it had great flavor, FYI- totally satisfying. The pork belly bao was better than Momofuku and pretty much every other bao we've enjoyed in the valley! I can't wait to order it again. The pot stickers were also enjoyable.

Once our friends arrived, we ordered and our food came out in decent time (aka not too long of a wait) and everything was delicious! Our adult friend ordered the Cheesesteak sandwich and said she wished she could order another! My husband and I shared the duck bao and wonton soup with noodles. While I preferred the pork bao, the duck was good, too! We thought that our soup broth had a wonderful depth of flavor and enjoyed the vegetables and every component of our soup-- so good!

The dessert case had been staring us down all night, so of course we HAD to order some chocolate (double chocolate?) cheesecake! OMG. It was divine and we enjoyed every bite!

Overall, we received great service and found that we got a lot of bang for our buck! We will 100% return. Thank you.",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,1,1,5,fdSP2IbLHEIj2OsNon2BUA
2389065,2014-05-03,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"I was surprised to discover this place is located in a casino.  But I don't live in Vegas.  My sis, who does live there, is a fan of their baos (I find always find it funny to hear white people say ""bao""), and since Fat Choy was listed as one of the 38 must-go restaurants in Vegas by some website, she took me there on my recent visit.

We had the duck bao, pork belly bao, and short rib rice.  Both baos were delicious. However, I'm from the Bay Area where we have constant access to Chinatown so bao is not a unique thing.  You can't really ever go wrong with roast duck, so while the duck bao was great, it was no better than any other duck bao I've had throughout my life.  A generous piece of delicious boneless duck in a steamed chinese bun with a bit of greens, drizzled with hoisin sauce.  Yummy but for $7 for 2 pcs, the price was kinda ouch.  I can get half a roasted duck at a chinese bbq restaurant for less than that.  Still, for the non-Asians in Vegas, I can understand the hype if you've never had something like this.  And I do definitely recommend trying it if you never have.

I was more impressed with pork belly, but that's only because that's rarer where I come from.  It was done so well.  Exactly what pork belly should be and far superior to the pork belly dishes I've had at higher-end trendy Asian fusion restaurants.  

The short rib rice was great as well.  I wouldn't call it generous but it was enough.  The short ribs were incredibly tender and seasoned wonderfully.  I was afraid it would taste like nothing more than pot roast (which we make at home all the time in the crock pot and which similar beef entrees at a lot of restaurants end up tasting like even though they call it fancier names).  But the ribs surpassed my expectations.  Came over white rice with a side of salad (with the fancy greens--not the cheap lettuce) and some chopped pickled mustard.  That pickled mustard added a lot to the dish for both my sister and me.  If you're not familiar with it, I'm not sure that you'd really appreciate it though.  

I honestly don't know that I would go back myself because, as I said, I have access to similar types of food here in the Bay Area and at much cheaper prices.  But I might if I lived in Vegas.  One downside is that since it's in a casino, you can smell the cigarette smoke if you're sitting close to the entrance, and it can be pretty bad.  I am so glad California is more prissy about smoking.

The service was really friendly.  Both servers were sweet.  Another yelper said there is a mandatory 15% tip, but I don't think that's true.  When you pay on their tablet credit card swiper, there is a button you can press to add 15%, 20%, or 25% tip, but you don't HAVE to press any of them.  

They also had a nice selection of dessert, including root beer floats!  I bought a red velvet cake home for my white boyfriend.  I didn't try it but he liked it. He said it wasn't as sweet as other velvet cakes he's had.",q-2OL8n6bvGi_CHFJOXGDA,5,2,4,x2SlqjQ6t0641IuoBttvtQ

All be it I knew that it was in the Eureka Casino, never been there, but its a small hole of a casino on the east side with a more local flavor...yea.  Coursing through the smoke filled floor assaulted by the dinging and toothless chatter of the patrons desperate need for lady luck all wrapped up in a frenzied tornado of weirdness, I spied my destination.  Lets just say not what I expected but hey, good things sometimes sprout out of strange places right!!??  I made my way to the bar as I always do, (it lets me get friendly with the locals and staff and often times I have a VIP front row seat to all the good stuff that is going on in the kitchens...or maybe I'm closer to the tap...Ill let you decide.  

I was greeted immediately by a friendly woman who took my drink order and left me to peruse the limited lunch menu.  Now when I say limited, it was just not like all the other local haunts that have a book full of greasy goodness and slapped together traditionals.  I first started to look for the Shrimp Toast I had heard so much about and well...come to find out it is a special and not on the menu all the time...DAMMIT!!  I moved on to the Crispy Garlic Chicken wings...BAM foiled again, also not on the menu!  So I continued to work the placard menu in hand and try not to be disappointed while the monitor above my head teased of dishes that were, you guessed it, not on the menu.  I was crying by this point into my Stella and the server came with a tissue and said buck up little butter cup you will not be disappointed by the bao.

Whoa daddy.  I had the pork belly bao and the crispy duck bao, (two per order), and I pretty much drooled all over myself just trying to get it all down as fast as I could.  Pretty bomb, folks, with a perfect not spongey bun, the belly was the perfect fat to meat consistency, the crispy duck was a bit stingy (or im just gluttonous), and i rounded it all out with gyoza that was ""asi asi"" nothing special but had good flavor and was prepared correctly.  I neglected the rest of the menu already deciding that I would come back because I had to order another round of Pork Belly Bao.  What? Don't judge me!

If it wasn't for the guy who just lost $6,000 samolies but still had time to yell into his ""brand new"" apple watch and listen to Iggy Azalea at full tilt, I-G-G-Y, I-G-G-Y, while carrying on an absent conversation with me throught six teeth, that couldn't quite handle the wedge salad with a caraf of blue cheese he ordered on the side, it would have been a perfect little lunch adventure.

We were staying at the Stratosphere, so this place was a quick walk from our hotel.  We went for lunch at about 1:30PM on Saturday, April 15th.  This is located in a corner of a small local's casino called Eureka Casino on Sahara ave.  I don't believe there is any kind of sign outside -- so you just have to know about it!

What a lovely lunch we had. This place is small; however, the care shown to the customers was amazing. The food was great as well.

We had an excellent server by the name of Tammi Jo.  She was quite possibly one of the friendliest human beings we have ever had the pleasure of having in a restaurant.  Now, don't get me wrong, everyone else was also very nice.  In fact, they worked as a team and sometimes another server would come over and check in on us.  The service was amazing.

We tried and shared a few things. We had the Duck Bao, the Duck Rice and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  Duck Bao - Great; Duck Rice - Pretty good and the Grilled Cheese - Out of this World amazing!

I would definitely return here again. Next time, I will add a little variety and try something new -- except the grilled cheese. That one will remain a staple for next time.",GkoESM9G3qJC3PTLgCif8A,2,2,5,vvTNevm91QEKuBRnYqJVQg

My only complaint is that they close too early during the week. 10pm during the week is way too early, especially for being in a casino. When I want some late night grub I have to go somewhere else.

There was no one there and they were preparing to close. So I asked if it was still ok, I don't like to keep people, there were 5 of us and I already knew they'd be staying after closing. The waitress was nice and the she said that they were still open and to just sit anywhere. The cook just jokingly said they would charge us 3x the price, haha funny :-)

We ordered the dumplings x3 cause we all enjoyed this. The 2 boys has cheeseburgers and they were both satisfied. 14yr old ordered the sesame noddles but couldn't finish it, he was too full from the dumplings but had it for lunch today and he finished it with no problem. My husband and I ordered the duck rice and it was surprisingly good. My husband always talks about craving for this, to which I on the other hand, never do. But there wasn't much menu choices so I gave it a try. Duck was crispy and soft on the inside but the rice with the egg on top was tasteless. Dessert we ordered to go, peppermint cheesecake. I only took a couple of bites and it was awesome.

The servers (2 ladies) were very nice but that doesn't make up for how late our food was. We were very patient, but an apology for the lateness would have been nice.

When we arrived, the place was about 1/2 full. Cute little diner inside an old casino (Eureka Casino)... As you walk into the casino to get to the diner, there's like a wall of cigarette smoke that hits you... Not like the newer casino/hotels, but fortunately the diner wasn't so bad. It's pretty clean, cute decor with a few booths, few tables and some bar seats.

The menu is a mix of American diner foods and Chinese  foods. I heard about this place from my brother so wanted to check it out. We ordered coffee (which was really good), duck bao, fried duck rice and sesame noodles. The sesame noodles came out first. It's a vegetarian dish but you can add meat if you like. We had it veggie style. It's peanuty and has a good amount of veggies in it. However I did think the noodles were a bit over cooked. Still good though, but not spectacular.

The duck bao came out next. They tasted a lot better than they looked. The fried duck rice came out last. We both stared at the dish in confusion. We thought it was a fried rice dish but was a duck and rice place with a side salad. We got a fried egg with the plate, which was a bit over cooked. This dish was just ok. The bao was definitely the best out of all the things we ordered.

Overall food was ok, nothing spectacular and just took waaaaaaay too long to get to our table. If they continue this way, might be hard to survive. Seemed like there were issues in the kitchen. Like I said servers were super nice but no apology for lateness. Not sure if I'd travel off the Strip to eat here again.",9GpMrHTbb_1lQuVB5UF4qA,1,1,3,S7aqGQBSnlACGfToyyIs4w

But the rest of the food was lackluster. Got the short rib rice with a fried egg which the waitress said was the best they had besides their buns. The dish very colorful looking almost like bibimbap at first. The hot meat made the spring salad warm and soggy tasting. The meat fell apart nicely but the sauce (I assume sugar and soy sauce based) compared to an instant microwave Chinese frozen meal. The portions were nice.

2641309,2014-10-07,12,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"I'm a bao that life.

In a city that loves a good bao. The Pork Belly Bao ($7 for 2) is a solid option - It has pickled mustard greens, cilantro, crushed peanuts, and hoisen sauce. The only gripe I had, was that some parts of the pork belly was too tough and dry to get my teeth into. Other than that, it was a tasty bao and the best thing I ate here. Flavor rating: 4/5

We also tried the duck rice - It comes with a crispy duck leg (not so crispy), cucumber salad (basic spring mix with a light soy sauce dressing?), fried shallot, and ginger scallion sauce (the best part!) for $12, we also added a sunny fried egg (their egg needed work - it was too slimy) for an extra $2. The duck rice wasn't too shabby, but I think it was missing something; It tasted rather dull. Then it dawned on us, you need to eat it with the ginger scallion sauce it comes with (by the tablespoons), in order to wake the dish up and give it some character. The overall dish reminded me of Hainan chicken and rice, but with duck. Awesome concept, but it didn't blow me or my tastebuds away. Flavor rating: 3/5

The sesame noodles ($8) were a big fat NO. The entire dish was terribly bland and tasted like it came straight from the market's prepackaged and refrigerated isle. The menu advertised roasted wild mushrooms, yet we see sautéed cremini and canned straw mushrooms (from biglots?) Don't get me wrong, I love canned straw mushrooms (I'm asian, I know all about it and use it in my cooking.) But the ones used in this dish, were like a weird-tasteless-knockoff brand. To top it off, I didn't taste ""roasted,"" let alone any of the ""wild mushroom"" earthiness or nuttiness in the dish - this was the reason I ordered this dish and it was all a major lie. Also, the peanut sesame vinaigrette needs work, lots of it; It was not flavorful or exotic, it was uninteresting and weak. I was extremely turned off by this lackluster dish and after the second bite, I refused to eat any more. Flavor rating: 1/5

Would I come back? There's a 50% chance. There are many restaurants in Vegas offering a good ol' bao nowadays (BURGR, Bachi Burger, Jinya Ramen Bar) and there is nothing that makes the bao here stand above the rest. Although, I might return to give their burgers a shot.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,10,9,3,G8E6i4mKANjhq-cwuD9GJQ

2648605,2016-01-29,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Absolutely obsessed with Fat Choy. Has great Yelp reviews and is written about on Eat Local. I was lucky enough to be staying just down the road so I decided to try out this funky restaurant. 

It's a complete hole in the wall inside a small smoky casino. Went here on 2 different weekdays and never had to wait for a table even though the restaurant is relatively small. Waitresses are so kind and attentive. The menu is condensed but they clearly have tasted all the food and can give you a great recommendation. 

The first visit I tried the potstickers, duck bao and sesame noodles. The potstickers were good although the sauce was a little harsh for me. I really enjoyed the duck bao, clearly the chef has spent time finding what additions and condiments compliment the duck best. The sesame noodles were basic but not in a boring way. A nice hearty dish that's good after a long day of work.

My second visit I tried the pork belly bao and the short rib grilled cheese. Both of these were absolutely delicious. The pork bao is savoy and the crushed peanuts are a unexpected welcome addition. What can I say about the short rib grilled cheese? AMAZING. Overly decadent in the best way. You can tell that they take pride in this dish.

If you're staying on the north end of the Strip, pull yourself away from the casino long enough to enjoy a meal at Fat Choy.",n-xzBTN7iUmqHAN-Pyw7gQ,0,1,4,wr9kNTARHQcT6KdqCZA_yA

Bao down, when I'm westward bound.
Bao down, because I ain't a hater like you.
Bao down, because I eat a little greater WITH you. 

Through the haze of mixed smoke and shady characters.. a bright light shines greater than those of the video slot machines and beady eyes glaring right at you.. in Eureka, at some point, you'll find yourself wandering towards the only restaurant up in this shindig.. a lil' spot in the cut called 'Fat Choy'.

The inside is diner-esque with a few booths, a bar top, a few tables floating center, a dessert case and some TV's. The wall near the entrance has a brief artsy history in regards to Fat Choy. It turns out, the owner(s) are from the SGV (626) which is essentially where I grew up.. so naturally I was immediately intrigued.

Attention: Bao is my new favorite treat, I'm convinced. I could easily eat 3 orders of the Peking Duck Bao without question. I pretend I'm full around other people, but the fat boy inside me yearns to continuously eat and eat. *Wrapped within a fluffy n' soft sweet bao bun, covered in a thick hoisin sauce, cucumbers and scallion; the duck is layered and cooked to a crisp with a succulent inside. Every bite was thoroughly relished. Equally impressive is the Pork Belly Bao, which is covered w/ chopped peanuts, cilantro & pickled mustard greens. The pork is a little fatty, to my liking, and too has a juicy inside that leaves your mouth watery and wanting more.

Short rib rice bowl is a must - the dish can easily serve 2; them short ribs are braised with a tender bite. A knife is not needed, as the meat cuts smooth like butter. Mix that with some white rice and a fried egg, pop open that yolk and let it run! The greens in the bowl don't mix too well with the heavy BBQ section, so you can just shove 'em to the side if you're like me. Aside from that, the meat-y yolkish part was tremendous.

I've found Fat Choy an ideal place to share a few small yet fulfilling dishes with friends just a little off the Vegas strip. We were able to try most of the menu upon my last two visits; both times the service was great, the food had my taste buds tinglin' and I left with a satisfied stomach.",jbOJV077QCGzduE6zFYO_A,21,22,5,GwhpfGTvVb5ZQYLHdq4GFg

As a bonus, Fluff Ice was there as a temporary pop up to see how people will react with the Fat Choy collaboration. We ordered a medium halo halo and a chocolate crunch. Just the sheer silence of my kids told me that they approve of the fluff ice!

5 stars for all of the above mentioned. Minus one star for the glaring issue they need to address. THE FREAKIN SECOND HAND SMOKE COMING IN FROM THE CASINO! If I was asthmatic, I would not be able to eat here, which is a shame, because the food is that good!

on our way out of vegas, we drove to eureka casino and pulled right into the parking lot (there was no maze to follow; it was like pulling into a strip mall parking lot.)  

we ordered the peking duck bao ($7 for 2) and pork belly bao ($7 for 2) and a coffee (less than $2 for a medium/large) to go.  there was a $1 to-go charge.  the 2 ladies running the front of house made the experience 5 stars!  they were so helpful/chatty and one of them even went to look for me when my coffee was ready and i had not returned from the bathroom.  nowadays, it's so rare for people to go above and beyond without being asked!

the baos were the perfect delicious snack to get us through an afternoon of hiking.  the pork belly bao was more substantial at about 2x the size of the peking duck bao.  at $6 per order, i think these snacks would be all the craze.

Pot Stickers (4/5)

Seriously, some of the best pot stickers I've had in this city. Each plate comes with 5 large pot stickers for $6. Unlike many other places, these pot stickers were not soggy at all. They were nice and crispy and full of flavor!

Braised Short Ribs (4/5)

Check out the pics for the portion size! Very generous portions here! The actual meat its self was very tender and juicy. Our server informed us that the teriyaki sauce is actually made on site. The sauce was tasty, but not overpowering. Very filling portion!

Teriyaki Rice (4/5)

Again with the large generous portions! The chicken was tender and the rice was cooked perfectly! For the same price as a Teriyaki Madness bowl, you get so much more! You get a much larger portion in addition to a much tastier bowl, IMO.

Service (4.5/5)

Our server was outstanding! Outgoing, gregarious, and accomodating, she was a gem and we were fortunate to have her help us on our first visit! The only reason it wasn't a perfect 5 was because of a slight lag getting refills, but the other server took care of that as soon as she noticed. Great service!

Room (4/5)

It's a pretty small space, but with a lot of quirky charm. You really have to check it out!. Plus my friend noticed they have a small little section commemorating Guy Fieri's visit here. (""Hey Look! that fat guy with the white hair was here!"")

I like this place a lot. Even though the menu is a bit small, the service and food will certainly guarantee I'll be back for multiple visits!

It was in some casino we thought had shut down long ago, and when we pulled up I wasn't sure if the entire spot was the restaurant, or if the tiny building actually housed a restaurant AND 200 slot machines lol.

HOWEVER - hubby gets major points for this gem of an eatery.  That pork belly bao was like nothing - NOTHING - before.  I've had great pork belly on its own.  I've concocted my own bao's when we ate out.  But this - with veggies on it?  Did I eat that whole thing?  You betcha bao I did.  Even hubby was surprised.

You MUST get.  I think I convinced him enough to try the duck with me the next time we go.

I love that the server explains the food to you as its served - it definitely adds to the experience.  The burger was delicious and the grilled cheese with short rib was just the right amount (we both even used the tomato dip ... crazy!).  But the BAO is WOW.
(Sorry, too cheesy!)

Great service.  Sounded like they had good desserts, but we were too stuffed.  Also, bonus for having the coke machine with a thousand gazillion (I may be wrong in the math) combos - why can't all restaurants have this?  It's a small perk!

Gahhh, let me go search my players cards for discounted rooms - I don't want to wait too long before grubbing here again!

Other things:
- Not too much seating, but that wasn't an issue when we were here

American and Asian fusion is the type of cuisine served here but when it comes to ambiance, you definitely get an old school diner vibe. The layout of the tables and the counter top bar screams old school diner. There is a wall however with drawings and writings that gives a wink to the Asian fusion portion.

I ordered the grilled cheese thinking I was going to get a crazy mix of flavors like what I'd normally go for when trying anything Asian fusion but what I got was quite the opposite. The grilled cheese was as simple as it gets and it was delicious.

The bread was buttery, the provolone and cheddar was gooey, the short rib was savory, and the onion jam tasted like grilled onions. The sandwich was nothing extravagant and I'm ok with that because as simple as it was, the taste was enjoyable. The tomato sauce given was a nice nod to the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. It looked like marinara but was more like a chunky tomato blend that worked well for dipping. 

The waitresses were friendly and offered great service. In the end, I got exactly what I came for...a lite lunch that I enjoyed before my long drive back to LA. This place proves for me once again that you can find good food outside the Vegas strip and I'll be more than happy to stop by again for other items from the menu.

So I made it the next day to the Eureka Casino and my  observation  it was a very quaint very clean neighborhood casino so, I made it inside the Fat Choy and,  it too was very quaint and very cozy atmosphere.

 The server was very attentive and very nice as she greeted me so, I  told her that it was my first time there and that I heard the Fat Choy Burger was poplar and she agreed with me and went on to tell me burger ingredients with such enthusiasm which to me it sounded really enticing so, I ordered it along with a Buddha Beer. 

Shortly my order arrived and I was pleasantly surprised how big the burger was. The burger is 1/2 pound of  Angus beef and consisted of the following toppings of boneless short ribs, bacon, cheddar cheese, roasted tomato and , a fried egg on a fresh bun. 

All I  have to say the burger didn't last very long on my plate it was Deeeeelicious!! After devouring my burger treat I also noticed on their menu they had pork belly which I  haven't tried before so, I ordered a small portion of  pork belly slices which shortly arrived and  it had a fatty kind of bland flavor but, with a little tobasco on it I woke up the flava.

Anyway to sum it up the food was great the server was friendly and the place was clean.

Fat Choy has an excellent fusion between American eats and Asian dining, along with intermixing fine dining elements (pork belly) for a great taste of food.  In particular, the layers of flavor that come with its dishes will first hit you with a bit of Hawaiian flavors from the teriyaki coating, followed by thousand island, and then just the fatty richness of the meat.  Of course, I'm describing the Fat Choy burger, which is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Additionally, I'm a fan of the pork belly buns that have all the elements of the traditional Peking Duck, but with the added goodness that only pork belly can deliver. 

All in all, Fat Choy is a clean simple restaurant with excellent food and service (thanks Emily!).  I enjoy bringing friends to try Fat Choy, as it quickly becomes a favorite.

I had the spare rib grilled cheese. There was nothing amazing about the sandwich, but for $8 or so it was a good value. I did have a hard time picking from other items on the menu, always a good sign.

I have been a fan of Great Bao since the beginning. I was a bit dispirited when I found out that they were being kicked out of the hair salon (kind of an awkward location anyway, but that's beside the point.) Good thing they had their truck. I enjoyed visiting their truck almost every time I went to Vegas in the last year (about 7 times.) Nonetheless, when I heard that Great Bao was starting up a brick and mortar restaurant, I was stoked.

My favorite thing about Great Bao was the fact that they had so many different specials / food choices. Those specials were what kept me going back. Those changes in his menu were kind of a reflection of what he wanted others to taste.
Chef Sheridan having this restaurant somewhat represents the big canvas that the truck and salon just did not have for him to fully express his art in cooking. The menu here is simple, and every dish I tried had so much thought put into it.

I wish I could go into detail about everything I tried, but I'm just going to keep this short and simple. The shrimp toast is a MUST - t'was my favorite item of the meal. The Fat Choy Burger - cooked perfectly medium and SO juicy. The dressing on the side salad is AMAZING. The bone marrow is perfectly cooked, and I like the fact that the bread is grilled. The duck rice, so smokey and tasty. The sesame noodles are quite good as well.

Writing this review is making my mouth water...

I can't wait to go to Vegas again so I can try their pork sauce noodles and pot stickers!

The service and food make up for the lack of ambiance.  Don't get me wrong - the restaurant is clean and the seating is comfortable and casual.  I'm afraid people could be somewhat turned off by the location, but if you want delicious Asian/American comfort fusion head over ASAP.

My husband and I first visited about a year ago.  We always get the pork belly bao ($7), a menu must have.  Thick pan-seared pork belly on soft bao with peanut sauce and pickled greens.  The pork belly is a melt-in-your-mouth crispy delight and the bao are the freshest  I've had. Short rib grilled cheese ($10) is another must have for my hubby.  Generous amounts of tender meat, cheddar cheese and more delicious BREAD.

The other item I was delighted with was the shrimp toast.  A generous portion of shrimp atop a delicate toasty slice of French-ish bread, a tiny fried egg, Chinese sausage, drizzled with aioli.  Much, much different than your Chinese restaurant variety.  Alas, the server told me it wasn't very popular and it is only served as a special now. :(  Same with the bone marrow, not enough orders to keep it around.

Consistently good, fresh, well-cooked food and the friendly and knowledgeable servers keep us coming back.

Short Rib Grilled Cheese was the best sandwich I've had in my life. Period. The way the meet and cheese melted with each other was decadent and while the meat and cheese was gooey, the bread was nice and crisp.  We also had the shrimp toast, which the paste kind of tastes like a Vietnamese bean curd shrimp cake but this was served was bread and an egg on top. Very good.

I went solo on my first trip for a lunch break. Wow was it crowded. I sat at the bar, which gave me a peek into the kitchen so I didn't mind. I ordered Gyoza which came with a fresh garlic sauce. Next time I will order them well done the crisp would add what was missing for me. For my entrée I ordered Sesame noodles no peanuts. OMG I was in heaven and ate the entire dish!! 
My second visit my friend and fellow yelper Allison S. joined me for lunch. Between the two of us, our table looked amazing. Even the house salad and dressings were homemade and on point.

Not really but I wish it was!! It melted, I didn't even ask Allison, I simply cut her a piece of my sandwich and said EAT NOW! She agreed it was heaven. I loved the thin cucumber slices in my rice, it went well with the sauce. 
At the end of the lunch, the coolest thing happen. Chef Sheridan came over to check on us and our food. He totally remembered me from the food truck game. That made my day!!

We sat down at a booth where there were four other tables and a 6 top taken.  For this place with one cook in the back, it must have been very overwhelming, because our food took 42 minutes to get to us.  That being said, our table remained piled with dishes, drinks were never refilled, and after a TWO HOUR DINNER at Fat Choy, most of that time in waiting, I waived the white flag and approached the counter to pay for my bill while we waited for our last order of bao to come out.

The bao this evening was slightly different, heavier on the pickled greens, folded in cold bao instead of steamed bun, fingerprints of sauce on the buns from the cook, and it lacked the crushed peanuts on top.  Our potstickers were more greasy than our first two times at Fat Choy, and those took an additional 30 minutes because the server failed to write our order down properly the first time.  

With that being said, we will seek out another bao place in town.  Service is everything to me, and after last night, this place is not worth returning to if the service and quality of food can be that inconsistent.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,0,3,hNtuI2oCngOW4qXcv5ovag

I had never stepped foot into the Eureka Casino, however after tonight I know I'll be going back..

I'm just going to list the items I had and my thoughts, spoiler alert...They're all good!

Pot Stickers: Hands down the best  pot stickers I've had, the filling was meaty and they were cooked to perfection.

Shrimp Toast: This dish is not something I would ordinarily order, but it came highly recommended, and did not upset.

Pork Belly BLT: Yes this is exactly what it sounds like, a BLT with Pork Belly (pork on pork...the way it should be), and sriracha mayo. I think this dish was made for me, anything that combines Bacon and Pork Belly can never be wrong!

Shortrib Grilled Cheese: This was probably the dish of the meal (I will be having of these in my future). The Shortrib is cooked to perfection, with enough cheese to balance, but not overpower. And the onion Jam served on the side complimented the sandwich perfectly.

Fried Pork Sauce Noodles: Noodles with pork belly. The noodles had a bit of spice to them, and the pork belly was cooked to perfectly. It was a touch spicy for me, but still a great dish.

Duck Rice: Hands down the best dish of the meal, A quarter duck (leg and thigh) served with rice. The duck was succulent (they told me it's a 2 day process for the duck to be made), and the garlic rice goes well with the richness of the duck. 

The Location is not too big (but way bigger than the old shop), there are a bunch of TVs, and a bar as well. I highly recommend you check it out! Well done Chef Sheridan and crew.",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,27,19,5,GbJjYb-Il3m3wrFbsjhBeg

The potstickers had a nice crispy fry on them, but I didn't care for the filling (utterly forgettable) or the dip (mostly balsamic). The shortrib was wonderfully cooked to perfection as was the rice, but the sauce was the flavor star and the dish needed more of it. I wish the side was something more exciting than a salad with more balsamic. We had the basic hamburger and it was perfect and very flavorful. the Chef has hamburgers down pat, perfect crust and it got to Mom exactly as she asked. It really tasted fantastic too, they don't put much sauce but the patty was so juicy. The fries were also great, thin and a nice mix of crispy and softer ones. they have ranch easily available which I love as a fry dip. 

Service was great, very friendly and very attentive with drinks. The location is kind of fun if a bit seedy inside the Eureka, one of the diveier joints near the strip. I gave it a high score because of the perfection of the meat in both our main dishes, kind of wish we had tried one of the bao apps or the grilled cheese instead of potstickers though.",PnDtQ77YbzjBL6e9tIRVOQ,0,0,4,x43bj6feNOxhFPiLJeYRmA

3087727,2018-05-22,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Fat Choy wins just for the randomness of what it is. Owners of one of the most talked about restaurants (Flock and Fowl) have a diner serving Chinese food inside of a tiny casino near Commercial Center? We've exhausted most of the Asian restaurants in the direct vicinity of our house and decided to finally check out Fat Choy. At first you think the casino is bigger than it is, but realize the mirrors are playing tricks on you and the only place to go is straight ahead to the diner in the corner. 

The restaurant is decorated like a Happy Days diner with Chinese influences - red lanterns, bamboo wallpaper, Lucky Buddha centerpieces. When we arrived late on a Saturday all of the booths were taken except one. The waitress served us a couple Kirins promptly and we started off with the Tofu and Mushroom Bao, Sesame Noodles and Shortrib Rice. 

I was a little disappointed and surprised they only served one noodle dish. I was expecting a lot more sesame oil flavor in the noodles but it seemed to taste more like shiitake mushroom broth. The noodles themselves were a lo-mein variety and seemed a little overdone. The short rib rice was phenomenal. I was skeptical about the salad in the bowl but it provided a freshness that I really enjoyed. The tofu and mushroom bao was decent, the tofu was a bit oversized but we ordered the pork belly after we finished and it was awesome. Crispy pork with peanuts that went really well together. 

This spot is super fun to go to and fun to Instagram about and make all of your friends wonder where the heck you are! Definitely a good option for casual late night comfort food where you can dip into a booth and not worry about crowds.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,Zx0M_7k9Qau77NPIxxHylg

Pork Belly was tender, juice inside and crispy outside. Peking Duck was also very well seasoned and worthy to keep chewing in my mouth. Honestly I did not expect this much high grade taste, and it was a pleasant surprise.

Pork belly had a nice flavor and the bun was fluffy. Potstickers greasy and the pork inside was very bland. Sesame noodles were light and well cooked. Short rib rice came with two small pieces of short ribs and no sauce so this dish tasted unfinished to me. The teriyaki chicken rice tasted Americanized and the sauce did not taste house made and was bland. On the menu it stated the chicken teriyaki rice came with market vegetables and the short rib rice came with mustard greens. Both actually came with a side salad which was not listed any where on the menu and it made up half the dish. I told the waitress and she said that's how we do things here and the chef thinks it goes better with the side salad instead of the vegetables. I found this response to be odd when the menu said nothing about either item including a side salad.

We have just read the 9 May 2013 article in the Las Vegas Weekly for the 10 Best Burgers.  OK, we live close so lets give the noted Fat Choy Burger at try.  We go to the Eureka often prior to eating at the Lotus of Siam so we knew the place and thought we would out try this highly regarded chef's new restaurant.  

Well.... Monday nite May 13 

-  We waited ~40-45 minutes and did not get our Fat Choy Burgers.
-  There were 5 tables in the whole place that had seated customers not exactly a sellout.
-  Wait staff was 2 young girls who tried their best but the food was not coming out
-  We noticed a plate being returned to the kitchen as being cold from one of the 5 tables that had gotten served
-  We were told the kitchen was a bit backed up about 20 minutes after being seated
-  Finally, after seeing the returned dish and what appeared to be lack of production and expertise in the kitchen, I went left my seat and confronted the wait staff and found out:
   1.  the plate was indeed returned for being cold
   2.  the chef on duty was ""new"" (first timer) as the regular chef was not in the kitchen that night.

That was enough information to pack up and get out before we were given a version of the 10 Best Burgers made by a ""new"" chef.

To use a baseball analogy, you will not win the World Series if you only have a good starting pitcher (i.e. the regular chef) without having a competent bullpen of backups to finish the job.  Especially after getting such a review in the local paper that would expect to draw in new customers.  

Sad amateurish performance.  We were so hoping this would be a great place to return to as we love the bartender and the casino.",4EsjumlAU0eSg3AvaRFGFg,0,0,1,-Ujm_Jqg7M1ktAQ5FY83QQ

Pork Belly Bao
Soft Shelled Crab Bao

Sesame Noodles
Duck quesadillas
Shortrib Grilled Cheese

The food, again, fantastic - making me wish I had a larger stomach, or another for additional nomming.

One great thing about Fat Choy is that it's almost never closed. It was opened until 10PM on New Year's Eve!!! It's a 10-min walk from the last stop of the Monorail (SLS stop). Service was good, our waitress was nice. 

+ Good selection of alcoholic drinks (it's in a Casino duh!!) 
+ The pork belly bao was pretty good , tender meat (fatty but that's how I like it) with good flavor. First thing I noticed was that there was no ground peanuts (stated on the menu and in the show). 

But things went downhill from there because the other dishes were disappointing. 
- Out of duck fried rice
- Mushroom noodle with Chinese sausage and a fried egg was drenched in a super sweet sauce. I know I'm eating Americanized Chinese food but still I can see how people can enjoy this sweet sauce with little flavor.
- Grilled cheese with short ribs (highly recommended in the show!). It came with a lot of shredded beef, but I didn't taste the onion jam (which the waitress informed me was mixed in with the short ribs) and the flavorful was just not there.I asked for dressing on the side for the small side salad but it came drenched in dressing (again, too sweet cuz it was balsamic). 

I hope my experience was just an exception because it was the last day of the year and people who were working just wanted to go home early.

The restaurant is in a pretty sketchy part of town where the parking lot isn't secure with guards.  You step into the Eureka Casino and all you smell is cigarette smoke.  But then you walk into Fat Choy and find a cute diner with diner servers.  

Our server was incredibly friendly and nice.  I was initially concerned that both servers were older American ladies who didn't look like they really understood Chinese food, but they certainly made up for it with their friendly service.  

Interestingly the owner was walking in and out of the restaurant but she completely lacked any personality.  We were sitting between two tables who were trying to compliment her on the restaurant and some chef award that he husband won.  It was shocking to see how disengaged she was with these fans.

Fortunately the food was tasty.  We had several orders of the duck bun and an unbelievable pork bun.  The grilled cheese was pretty good too.

Food was awesome, the American food fusion with Chinese fusion. Their significant short rib sandwich was good but a little too oily for me. A bowl of rice with short ribs was very good as well. Our friend finished his whole plate of salad with burger in five minutes.

3400218,2013-07-02,1,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Hmmm... We've been here twice, and if I had posted a review after the first time, it would have been 4 stars.

  We tried the short rib grilled cheese (good), the pot stickers (very good), the Fat Choy burger, & the PBBLT. Now, I consider myself a professional porker from the old school, but in order to be considered a contemporary ""foodie"", one has to venture out into the brave new world of exotica featured on the Food Network, and since ""pork belly"" and ""bacon"" are considered practically synonymous, I was actually anxious to give it a try. I am no longer anxious. It's not that it tastes bad, it's just that it's a little pork with a lot of creepy, greasy, mostly raw fat. How is it that the fat layers on bacon fry up crispy, chewy, and delightful, and this just seems like the stuff that would make you refuse to eat until your mother trimmed it off your meat for you? Yuck. Don't know what the fuss is about, but I'm not blaming it on Fat Choy. I assume this is the way it's supposed to be, and it's just not for me, along with blue-veined cheeses and anything with the word ""tartare"" in the title

. Anyway, what we did have was hot and fresh, and the service was fine- one obviously experienced waitress named Tammi who was working like crazy and appeared to be training a younger one who seemed a little lost. All fine.

 However, we returned this week and had brunch. Dropping a star because the hollandaise on the Eggs benedict was salty, runny, and I expect pre-packaged, and the eggs were overdone. The potatoes on, the other hand, were golden, crispy, and delicious. Most everyone else's food was fine, but one poor Sad Sack ordered waffles, and they were so limp and pale you would believe they were cooked by an Englishman. They boil everything! However, it should be noted that the waffles we saw being served a little later to neighboring diners looked brown and toasty. So go ahead and order them, but first ask yourself if you feel lucky today

. Added to this was the fact that they weren't that busy, Tammi was still plugging away, and the no-longer-new girl was still lost. While as a fan of The Walking Dead it was kind of fun watching her wandering around, bumping into walls with a vacant stare and a thin trickle of drool running down her chin, it was pretty much impossible to get a refill from her. Must have been hired for her looks. On the other hand, maybe not.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,1,1,3,3ifJGzUvtePOPe3eZjRDIw

I was super bummed as I had been craving bao buns the entire day!  Opportunity presented itself again.  Looking back I can't help but feel that the cosmos was trying to intervene and keep us out if this place.  I have to agree with the reviewer who described the smoke gauntlet you had to pass through at the Eureka to get to Fat Choy.  Upon entering we saw an Asian man in a chef coat leaving.  We guessed that was Chef Sheridan.  Uh oh...

Our server was friendly was patient as we tried to figure out how many of each thing we needed to satisfy our ravenous bao cravings.  We settled on two of each duck bao, pork bao, bone marrow and short rib rice.  We also ordered the potstickers and the sesame noodles.  The good: the potstickers and the pork bao, although according to the video of menu items showing, we were missing some key garnishes.  The bad: The bone marrow was not bad itself, but the floppy sourdough (why sourdough?) that came with it was a huge miss.  I've had the bone marrow at Comme Ca where Chef Sheridan came from and this one pales in comparison.  It was like the Walmart version.  The duck bao was not only missing all the garnishes, they seemed to be missing the duck.  It was a hoisin-like sauce and crispy skin.  That's it.  Not even enough skin to make it worthwhile.  Next up the short rib rice.  It came out cold.  Also it was missing the pickled mustard greens, which were substituted terribly with mixed salad greens and I'm pretty sure, straight up balsamic vinegar.  According to some of the other reviewers pics, we were missing some other garnishes too.  I was so jealous when I looked at those pics because that is not the food we got.  I wish the server had told us ahead of time that they were out of these items.  It's not like they were busy.  It was a Wednesday evening and two or three other parties were there.

Not sure I'd give this place another chance.  Chef Sheridan, you need to let the bottle blond with the neck tatoos go, 'cause she is not doing your food justice!",DUySH_Nyo5BRHIhdxsCDAw,2,2,2,uMy-x9Lx4Bu7fdx0KgQh3A

The duck and pork belly bao are always a hit, but there are other items just as worthy of being ordered. The short rib rice dish is comprised of two large chunks of boneless beef sitting atop the fluffiest rice imaginable. No knives are needed. The beef easily falls apart with the slightest poke. If you need a little grease, the short rib grilled cheese is the way to go. Plenty of beef fill this sandwich along with an onion jam and provolone and cheddar cheese. The acidity of the tomato dip puts this dish over the top. For more subtle, but equally excellent flavors, ""Grandma's potstickers"" delivers. The crispy seared bottom to the dumplings serve as a sign of quality before cutting into the pork and green onion mixture within. The location (inside the Eureka casino) may not be the best, but the food is well worth the visit through the smokey environment.

The latest time I went and ordered a burger plain -- I was very specific about it only having meat and cheese, no lettuce or anything.  The server (there are only 2 that I've ever seen there in 4 or 5 trips) was clear on that and then when my order was put in she made sure to tell the chef just meat and cheese.  

I get my burger and it has some sauce on it.  I ask the other server (who happens to be nearby) what that is and she says ""I think it's thousand island"" and I point out I asked for it with meat and cheese only.  She sends it back, my original server comes over to talk to the chef and I overhear her tell him ""Just put a new bun on it"".

No, not in a million years.  What makes you think it's OK to just scrape sauce off when I was very clear that I didn't want it?  At this point I got up and left.  I will never, ever, eat here again, and there's also a good chance that I will rarely, if ever, visit Eureka Casino again because of it.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,2,0,1,1kz9D4Xzzr05Ho9odwc9wg

First off when I think of ""short ribs"" I think of bone in ribs. I was a little surprised when I saw something else. The beef short ribs weren't that good. It was nice and soft but it wasn't worth ordering.  The Sesame Noodles was actually good. The only problem with the noodles was that it was way too spicy that we couldn't finish it. The dumplings came with a salty sauce which made it even more salty - not good. The chicken teriyaki was good but nothing special or out of the ordinary compared to basic chicken teriyaki you can order at any other restaurant. The only thing that was good was the Pork Bao. If I would ever come back to this place (which is most likely never) I would only order the Pork Bao.

The service:  LACKING.  We came in a group of 7 and they didn't refill any of our drinks until we were done with our food and ready for the check.  We had to flag the server for refills which was almost dumb because the place is small and it wasn't busy when we were there. 

Overall, the food isn't enough to make up for the pathetic service that was provided to us. Also, beware of the smell of smoke.

Saw them at the Foodie Fest....They had to close up shop for no hot running water...Darn!

Two strikes and counting, but wait......Great Bao has transformed into Fat Choy, and are inside the Eureka Casino....EUREKA CASINO!?!?!?!? Well at least they now have a brick and mortar location, and I know where to find them.

 After reading all these reviews 3 words seemed evident....FAT CHOY BURGER. So we ordered that medium rare, AKA the ONLY way to enjoy a burger, and oh, lookie here..what's this??? a special, that week only 3 bao and a drink special for $10? SOLD! Choices were Roasted Chicken, Tofu, Pork Belly, Peking Duck, and Soft Shell Crab. Not really in a tofu mood, and having pork belly'd well over 50 times, I'm a sucker for soft shell crab, juicy roasted chicken and perfect peking duck, so we went with those.

It was also my first encounter with the dangerously cool freestyle coke machine. With endless combinations imaginable I came up with a Vanilla Root Beer, and Wifey got a Peach Mello Yello(ask Jenny to make you a Gummy Bear!)

The Fat Choy Burger did not disappoint and is in my top burgers category. The 3 Bao Special was also great with the crispy skin from the roasted chicken and peking duck, but my favorite bao is the soft shell crab and I would take that over the pork belly any day.

GET THE BAO. All of it. The servings are slider size so it's either meant for sharing or buy 2 for a light meal. The pork bao are probably the best I've had and the same goes for the duck which is easily on par with most joints in the LA Valley area. 

The slow cooked short ribs were super tender and the pickled garnish was a nice touch. Add bacon and eggs to help with the flavor. 

The pot stickers are fresh tasting and home made. The wonton soup was very deerrricious as well. 

The daily special was a pork belly BLT which was pretty amazing as well. Didn't have a bad dish at all.

Don't let the neighborhood or the exterior spook you. Located inside the Eureka casino, Fat Choy was much smaller than I expected. But we were seated right away in a booth in the corner.

There were so many items on the menu we wanted to try ... so we did! We ordered the potstickers, wonton soup, and order of pork belly bao, and an order of softshell crab bao. The potstickers came out first and had a wonderful dipping sauce to accompany them. The wonton soup came out next and had great flavor. We added a side of noodles to our soup for extra ""filling."" The broth of the soup was tasty and brought the whole thing together. The pork belly bao were everything I hoped they would be. 

But then things went a little south from there. We placed our order for the softshell crab bao after we placed our order for all the other food and it took almost half an hour to get our softshell crab. 

The waitresses kept apologizing and saying that there was a new cook in the kitchen and that is why service was so slow. Because the food was so good and we weren't in a rush, I'm willing to forgive the slow service.

The noodles were absolutely my favorite. Not greasy at all. Sauce is not overpowering but delicious and consistent throughout. Wild mushrooms make this dish earthy and hearty.

I added an éclair to the end because I was so amazed by the quality of everything that I felt like their desserts would also be to par. (I was right.) So good! Go!

3877231,2018-04-19,3,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Fat Choy is the prototypical old school Vegas diner hole-in-the-wall, but with an Asian twist. It's the type of place you want to go after a night of gambling and drinking. Regardless of if you've had a great night, or a downer of an evening, you can also end it right with a pork belly bao, or a juicy burger. 

As I've been a huge fan of Chef Su of Flock & Fowl fame, I had to try his original brick-and-mortar spot. They have a bunch of bao offerings including the pork belly, peking duck, and tofu and mushroom for you vegetarians. Unlike Momofuku, you get way more bang for your buck with two baos per order. The peking duck bao had great flavor. And you can't beat that crispy duck skin.

As for the sandwiches, I couldn't pass up trying the shortrib grilled cheese sandwich. The onion jam with both provolone and cheddar melded so well with the short rib. Tomato dip included because it's a grilled cheese after all. Very reminiscent of the best grilled cheese you've had from your school cafeteria, but elevated.

My fiancé tried the duck rice, which should more aptly be renamed duck and rice. I think we were both expecting a roasted duck fried rice, but it was more so a duck leg with rice. The duck itself was sort of bland, and I didn't care too much for the spring salad. After you get past the ginger scallion sauce, the dish mostly lacked flavor.

Sesame noodles: I kind of expected the flavor to be a little more subtle. There's actually a lot going on in this bowl. Once you start eating it, it gets a addicting and you just want some more.

Short rib grilled cheese: I was probably most excited for this one. I really liked the combination of the buttery bread and salty meat, but I do think tht the meat was a little too salty.

Duck bao: I absolutely love duck. It looks very simple but when you bite into this one, it's something else. The duck was a little too crispy, but it was still great and really went well the the outside part cause it was so soft.

The service: our waitress was so nice! She made sure we were satisfied and added little tidbits. I really loved how friendly she was. She gave a great vibe.

The beef was gorgeously grilled and flavorful. The eggs were the perfect compliment.  The dish comes with potatoes, toast or salad; I had salad.
Along with a pot of delicious green tea. 
I was in heaven.

First of all, my server, Jenny, was an absolute delight.  She asked me about being there before and if I had any questions about the menu.  She was very helpful and very personable.  I was the only customer on this slow Sunday evening, and she had extra time and she spent it checking back with me a chatting.

I had looked at the menu online and I opted to try the bao.  I've never had Vietnamese bun bao so this was a new experience.  I ordered the duck and pork belly bao.  The duck bao comes with thinly sliced cucumber pieces, scallion, micro greens, and hoisin sauce.  The pork belly bao comes with one side of the pork seared, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, hoisin sauce, and some crushed peanuts.

The sandwiches were great!  The duck was my favorite because I simply love duck.  Jenny had brought me Sriracha and a small plate for putting the Sriracha and then using the plate as a dipping area.  It worked quite well!  The bun was very tasty.

Then the option came for dessert.  What's a person to do?  Ask Jenny for advice and certainly follow it.  I got the peanut butter cup which has a chocolate cookie-like bottom, then a layer of peanut butter mousse (my words), topped by some bits of crispy pieces.  I got it à la mode with vanilla ice cream.  The peanut butter is excellent.  Soft, creamy, and very rich!  I'm a fan--big time!

The restaurant uses the app Wallet so you can pay without pulling out the plastic and they'll email you a receipt if you want.  

The only drawback for me was the smell of smoke.  The restaurant is open to this small, locals casino and there's a smell of stale smoke as soon as you come in the door from the outside.  This permeates the restaurant and detracts from the overall experience.  I wish they'd put up some doors after scrubbing the place down and trying to get rid of the smoke smell.

Warm sesame noodles were well-seasoned and garnished with wild mushroom, cucumber and carrots. Paid extra to add pork belly.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  It's the pictures, not the reviews, of Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich that got me to bookmark this place. I didn't know much of Fat Choy or even the Eureka Casino until Terri R. mentioned it during lunch a couple of weeks ago.  I read a couple of reviews and thought maybe.  But after looking at a few pictures, I knew I had to eventually pay a visit for their Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. 

Yesterday was perfect.  I was in a meeting in California and just experienced a really bad lunch.  In the middle of my presentation, I get the text from Terri R. to meet at Fat Choy for dinner when I get back in town. If you read Terri R's review, she mentioned she dragged me here.  Not even close.  No one has to drag me to anything that equals me eating. Remember, my favorite food is seconds. 

The service was really good, but also expected since we were 2 out of only 4 customers in this joint.  Of course I had the short ribs grilled cheese w/fries and Terri had the same.  The sandwich is as good as advertised.  Imagine a perfectly made grilled cheese sandwich and a couple of pieces of tender fall off the bone short ribs.  Then put those together with sauce that isn't overpowering and not too much of it.  That's what you get with Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  It's worth another visit and if I was still a drinker, this would make the perfect hangover meal.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,13,11,4,GCdQIPjoNP5H7dOrGjElTA

Fat Choy Service:  Our waitress was so friendly and attentive from beginning to end.  She gave us great suggestions on the menu and was really sweet with my friend's 5 year old girl at the table.  Excellent..

Fat Choy Fusion: We stayed on the Diner fusion sandwich side this visit.  The Fat Choy Burger: Angus Beef, Shortrib, Bacon, & Fried Egg all came together well for a very tasty and heavy burger.  This something to order when you're hungry af and that burger craving kicks in.  The Shortrib Grilled Cheese was another nice Asian/Diner Fusion sandwich, but I was hoping for a bigger serving.  

Fat Choy Ambiance:  Red is the main decorative color which is evident in the bar top seats, booths, lighting and the Chinese lanterns hanging. Memorabilia of when Guy Ferreri visited for ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"" is posted.  There is definitely a diner feel to this small and intimate restaurant but it's very clean and great for casual dining.

This 67 maximum capacity foodie diner is in the Eureka Casino. This is a tiny local casino in a very old part of Vegas right off the trip and probably one of the last places you'd find this type of fusion restaurant.  The service is great and the food is tasty.

I came here by recommendation of Eva L with a group of our friends while in Vegas. It's located inside of the run down Eureka casino. The diner reminds me more of a Ruby's burger versus an actual Asian restaurant.

For $7 you can get 2 baos. We went with the pork belly and the peking duck. Both were pretty solid; however, for $3.50 per bao, it's way overpriced. I used to think KFC snackers were a rip off but this place takes the cake.

Peking Duck Bao

There is a coupe of bad technical flaws. One, the sin of not-crispy duck skin. Two, crumbly stale smelling frozen bao.

The flavor itself is pleasant. Five-spices-accentuated hoisin gave forward round tanginess. Cucumber neutralized and cleansed the palate. Nose was the same albeit a hint of unwell-rendered duck gave some gaminess. Texture was off due to improper rendering. No skin crispiness and meat was a bit chewy. This place used to be good. 2.5/5.

Sheridan's food deserves lots more recognition.  He's hardworking and committed and I love that -- I also like that it's a family affair.

While Sheridan's locations aren't the traditional mainstream -- from beauty shop to smoky casino floor, it's still a tremendous opportunity for him and we wish him all the best because his food is truly made with love and care.

I've been wavering with Fat Choy for a while now, and while it's not the best, it's a good restaurant that I'd recommend for pork belly items. Otherwise, the dishes tend to range from OK to pretty good. For example, the Fat Choy burger (which I finally tried last year) doesn't compare to other similarly priced restaurant burgers that I've eaten in Las Vegas, and the rice dishes that I've ordered didn't dazzle my taste buds either.

Today, I visited specifically to try some of their lunch specials. The soft shell crab bao ($9) was the first order. While the namesake component was certainly a delicious and crunchy treat (and might-I-add visually impressive), the sauces were uninspired and the ratio skewed toward bready. I can't help but contrast this with the mouthfuls of meat in Chef Sheridan's other creations.

I was going to try the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, but instead I went with what turned out to be the last pastrami melt ($10). I hope they didn't skimp because it's definitely not one of those sandwiches piled high with pastrami, or cheese even. The ingredients all tasted great though, and the crunchy bread was essential for texture. The massive side order of fries (included in the price) was pretty good, although I suspect that the broad salt flakes created an uneven seasoning situation. Overall, it's at least a notch below a great sandwich-focused shop that recently reopened in the Arts District.

Fat Choy is still a good restaurant to visit from time to time (for pork belly), but it's clear that Jenny and Chef Sheridan have brought a better game with their chicken-centric lunch spot Flock and Fowl just a few blocks away.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,6,4,zP9chn5GD2UTxGQehtj2pw

I tried both the Pork Belly and Peking Duck boa. I liked both. The meats were tender and juicy. Were they worth of my journey via the monorail and a half mile walk to a divey casino (Eureka) that cabs don't like picking up from? No. I've had comparable pork belly and Peking duck at other less inconvenient restaurants.

From the posted pictures it looks like the same vegetables go into several dishes--broccoli florets, julienne carrots, sliced mushrooms, green onion and sprouts.

Came with a bowl of fried wonton wrapper slices.

The duck skin in the bao was crisp, but the meat was a little tough, and the dough was a little dense. I still enjoyed them. The potstickers were pan-fried, not deep-fried, which I always appreciate, were flavorful, and had a good sauce.

The only negative was the service, which was really slow (they did apologize).

It also wins the dubious award for very-best-food-in-the-very-worst-location. I mean the Eureka Casino is a wretched old haunt with decades of stale smoke and failed dreams layered into its sad old casino floor. Hold your breath and walk straight into the restaurant, where the Fat Choy gang has done a fine job creating a fun, retro vibe. Indeed, the charm of the place is its comfy throw-back appeal. The menu is straight up comfort food--some of it Asian (baos, dumplings, noodles), some of it not even close (burgers, grilled cheese). I love that there's no attempt to ""fuse"" the two together or come up with a clever concept for the coexistence of east and west dishes. The menu is simply a list of wonderfully soulful and homey dishes, end of story. What matters most, of course, is the execution, and Fat Choy gets it right. The pork belly bao is perfection, a brilliant combination of fluffy steamed bun, succulent pork, crispy skin, and a nice bit of tart mustard gremolata. Whoever knows knows that whoever put that together knew what they were doing, with all the parts working together to create a mouth bomb of tastes and textures--soft, luscious, crispy, and bright. The duck in the duck rice has been confit'ed to a melting buttery softness. The short rib grilled cheese may be the absolute ultimate in stoner comfort food. You could fall asleep in that thing and never wake up. I haven't tried everything yet, but everything I have tried has been spot on. I just wrote a review of ""eat,"" where I complained that it over-promises and under-delivers. Fat Choy under-promises and over-delivers!

Everyone and their grandma has been raving about this place, so I thought I'd better go check it out. I've been wanting to check out the Eureka Casino anyway....one of those solidly un-pretentious little locals' dumps that will doubtlessly be imploded any day now. Well, after having checked it out...IMPLODE AWAY, I SAY!

Everything in this restaurant is coated in/soaked in/bathed in/wallowing in grease. My friend and I shared the pot stickers as an appetizer -- they were OK, although also glistening with gratuitous grease. As far as pot stickers go...they were like any other potstickers. Except greasier. All the better to slide down your gullet, I guess.

Next, I had the much-ballyhooed Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. BLEECCCHHHHH doesn't even begin to describe this monstrosity! I thought the pot stickers were greasy -- this beast was OFF THE CHAIN GREASY! It was like eating a heavily-salted Jheri curl sandwich!! I don't like wasting food, so I managed to choke down half of it before giving up -- but it was G.R.O.S.S. It was SO salty it was almost like they were trying to cover something up. Also, the grease had a weird sort of stale aftertaste, like they use the same fry oil over and over. YUCK! 

The fries that accompanied the sandwich were similarly greasy. I know, I know, French fries are called FRIES because they are FRIED -- but these were ridiculous. I've had better fries in the employee dining room at Caesars Palace! The fry grease had the same gross aftertaste as the sandwich, which totally killed whatever was left of my appetite.

Now, you might chalk all of this up to my being a veggie-eating commie bastard -- but guess what? My friend, who is most definitely NOT a veggie-eating commie, had the Fat Choy burger...and was similarly grossed out. He reported that it, too, was astonishingly greasy -- although he did finish the whole thing, so it couldn't have been THAT bad.

You might blame me for not having ordered something less greasy than a grilled cheese -- but the menu is extremely limited here (one page only), and since I don't like duck or pork, I didn't want to get the highly-touted bao or any of the rice dishes. I'm willing to bet they are just as greasy, anyway :-/ In fact, there wasn't much of anything on the menu that grew out of the ground -- it was all lard, grease, carbs and meat.

What really sucks is, I came in here fully expecting to adore the place -- being as it's located in such a solidly unpretentious dive. Speaking of which.....

After I gave up on eating, and had sopped the grease off my face with no fewer than thirty napkins, I went out into the casino to have a drink at the bar, thinking I could salvage the evening with a little people-watching and a rum & coke to cut through the grease still coating my tongue. But even that went sadly awry.

First of all, it's a cash-only bar, and I didn't have any on me. So I had to get raped by the corner ATM, and pay a $5 surcharge...which brought the cost of my drink up to Strip prices anyway. If I'm paying Strip prices, dammit, I want to at least be able to ogle drunk bitches with fake tits, etc. But all I got was a depressing, smoke-filled room full of methheads, with Kenny Loggins playing somewhere in the background. That kind of ambiance is OK if you're in a certain mood....

...but when you're already on the verge of vomiting, it ain't no fun! I finished my drink and got the fuck out of there, probably never to return. 

I never thought I'd say this, but...there are some places that DESERVE to be imploded. You hear that, Tony Hsieh?!! Blow this bitch sky-high and have at it -- even an elitist members-only dog park would be better than THIS!!!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,14,8,2,7X9y2DL3gw5tWMYiO8NN5Q

At the price Fat Choy charges for appetizers I decided against that and ordered the Cheezesteak Sandwhich. I should have just ordered a single Shrimp Toast. The Cheezesteak was not even mediocre. I left more than half on my plate. I didn't even bother to take the rest home.

On the bright side my Dad did better than me with the Fat Choy Burger. It did look good and he said it was excellent. After I paid I left feeling like I might as well have gambled my money in the Euraka or ate somewhere else. Really disappointing.

We chose different items from their snacks section of the menu. We chose the potstickers, chicken wings, shrimp toast and the duck and pork belly bao. The potstickers were really good, so were the wings, although they are like wings you can get anywhere else. Maybe a ranch/sriracha sauce to accompany them would be nice. The meat on both baos was good, but we thought they could've used something moist in them. Neither my husband or I are experts on baos, we've only tried the twice, so it could be that we aren't used to them. The shrimp toast I did not understand, maybe if I would've eaten it as soon as we recived it, but by the time I tried it the egg was kind of cold. My husband really enjoyed it though, and he is picky when it comes to runny eggs. The service is very attentive and friendly, so that's a big plus.

Fat Choy is inside of Eureka Casino, a tiny casino some where on Sahara. The only bad experience I had was having to endure the lovely smoke filled casino.

On the table: Pork Belly Bao, Duck Bao and a noodle dish whose name escapes me but the flavor doesn't!

I'm not a fan of duck bc of the gamey-ness  but I tried the Bao anyway, though I am still not a fan of duck, the Bao was quite tasty! As goes the same for the pork belly, that'd be the one I devoured! Between my husband, son and myself we had a total of 9 Baos and the noodle dish and our bellies were pretty darn content!

My go to sandwich is the pork belly BLT. Pork on top of more pork. Can you say heart attack? Pork belly is fatty and rich while the bacon is crispy and salty. Explosion of flavor in my mouth. It is on the greasier side, so prepare to use a lot of napkins. I'm glad I have turned a fellow yelper, Tom F. on to this sandwich. 

The vibe is upbeat, depending on who you go with. The service is fast and friendly, also depending on who you go with or if the restaurant gets crowded. I will return, but only after a few gym sessions to work off this sandwich.

Tip: take a deep breath before entering the casino and you can exhale once you enter Fat Choy. The cigarette smoke is pretty strong, unless you want the black lung, then that's cool too.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,10,11,4,P2XGYr5RCekxl_1g9k2oyw

4286038,2016-07-24,2,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Fat Choy is another promising restaurant from Sheridan Su but at least with this first visit, I'm not sure I was totally sold on the concept or the food.  

The restaurant itself is a weird mish mash of items from a really classic diner feel mixed with some food truck trappings.  Perhaps it was the location itself (the Eureka Casino) that also didn't help - Fat Choy is tucked away near the front entrance's left corner, but the really smoky interior and odd smells make for an odd first impression.  

Menu-wise, there's a mix of diner and Chinese food here from breakfast to late dinner.  There's also some beer and wine options available with some dessert as well.  I opted for the Fat Buddha beer and the short rib rice bowl.  The beer was about $5 and the bowl was about $14.  The bowl came with the short rib, some mixed greens (with a choice of sauce), rice and a choice of an added egg for extra.  There's another sauce mixed in here as well which probably had the best impression - being tangy and a little sour.  The rest of the dish however was just okay.  The short rib tasted a little off to me for some reason (not that tender) and the bowl dish from the rice to the salad were fairly bland.  The egg helped the most and I wish I mixed the yolk in more with the rice for instance to make for a better dish.  

Service was also a little hit-or-miss for me.  I waited in the front for about 10 minutes before being helped (didn't see any staff) although after being seated, service seemed to be smoother with a shorter wait on food.  

I'm totally wiling to give the restaurant another try (after trying the really delightful Flock & Fowl) but at least the first go-around was a little ho-hum.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,3,1,3,Ho1d8s5s5bGrvDOCcEP8Lw

The pork belly bao was delicious! You get 2 pieces for $7. The pork belly is accompanied with relish, cilantro, and I think peanuts. It was an explosive medley in my mouth and definitely something I'd come back for. 

Next came the entrees: short rib grilled cheese and sesame noodles. The short rib grilled cheese was accompanied with fries and tomato dipping sauce which tasted like marinara sauce. It wasn't anything to write home for, just plain ol' grilled cheese and meat. The sesame noodles left me in a state of confusion. Although it was flavorful, the dish was lukewarm which had me question whether it would've tasted better hot or cold.

ONE WORD: Memorable 

Still one of the best Pork Belly Baos I have every tasted in my LIFE*, I dream about this because it's sOOo good it makes me want to eat more. I can't describe it. It's crispy on the outside and the pork fat is so flavorful bursting with unimaginable bliss of joy with every bite . The amount of dedication invested in the preparation of this pork belly speaks for itself. Fat Choy really hits the spot when it comes to perfecting their boas. You can tell there was a lot of work put into the pork belly alone to make its so flavorful.  Coming from the San Gabriel Valley area, a place known for one of the best asian cuisines in California, I can say nobody can beat what they have here. I'm a food junkie and chef myself the boas definitely hits my weak spot transitioning from vegetarian to a slow transition to meat. I highly recommend this place because of the heart and soul poured into their dishes. I can definitely taste it with every bite.

There were about 2-3 tables that seated 6+ so if your party is bigger than that, you might end up splitting booths/tables so just be ready for that. Very cozy feel. What threw me off a little was that they had Asian decorations while playing country music. Then again, it is an Asian/American fusion. A few big screen tvs so you could watch sports games and what not.

I had the Fat Choy burger, cooked medium, with fries. It's your basic burger topped with bacon, brisket, fried egg, and onion jam. The burger was delicious and decent sized. The fries were really good, and they gave a pretty good amount, all for $11.99. The staff was extra nice and seems like they knew the regulars on a first name basis.

The Fluff Ice was there on the day I visited and their ice creations was also good.  However, there seems to be only two employees working the front of the restaurant and the place was busy. Perhaps, it was unexpected for a Sunday but the place seems very busy when I arrived. The two employees working the front was the waitresses/hosts/bus boys/cashiers and I felt bad for them.  I do not know if this is normal for Fat Choy but if it is. I hope Fat Choy seeks out Robert Irvine and his Restaurant Impossible team to get them organized. I do not think Fat Choy is losing money based on the crowd of people on Sunday but I am sure they can make more.",Aw0x_dXz8rQbP6ZoYE8Y0g,1,1,4,Z3rPvvOBIEtTw1BRpzJzkQ

4529989,2015-11-06,1,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Experience:  came with a large group of friends. I have been wanting to try this place for a very long time, and finally made it. It was a Thursday night at 6:00. 

Facility: The restaurant is located in a mediocre casino called Eureka. It looks like an American diner, almost 50's-ish, but at closer inspection, it has some modern Asian influences too. Fairly clean and pretty small. It has booth seating, tables and chairs, and bar stool counter seats. Unfortunately, the smoke from the casino leaked enough into the restaurant to make my hair smell like old smoke when we left. :/ 

Service: Well, this is hard to say nicely. The service was ok, but our waitress seems a little confused. That's a nice word. Confused. Anyway, she was nice enough, and was awesome at remembering the drinks for refills, which with their 100+ combinations of sodas, that's impressive. Yeah Diet Dr Pepper!!!!

Food: I shared everything with my Girl, so we had 3 dishes. 
Pork Belly Bao - 4/5 - yum!  The meat was good and the condiments accented it nicely. The bun was fresh and soft. 
Duck Bao - 5/5 - This was my fav. I really loved the cucumber topped onto the salty, rich duck. It was so good!!
Short rib grilled cheese with fries - 3/5 - this was a good sandwich. The grilled cheese portion was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp to the bread. The filling was shredded shortrib, melted with cheese and topped with an onion jam. I did get a few pieces of onion peel that were inedible, but it did add some sweetness to the sandwich. There was a side of tomato jam that more resembled marinara sauce. I used it for my fries. Fries were average tasting, but they are hot and fresh. 

Overall: This was a good restaurant. I would come back again with friends. I will make sure I have nothing to do after a because of the smokey hair and clothes. 
But the Bao is yum!!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,2,3,o9qWw31LjHfRQ6Q6JzHU3Q

Staying on the strip has really skewed my view of vegas. Could not get over the guy who had a foot cast and was bleeding (!!) through the cast and onto the floor....or the guy who was standing in front of the slot machines in only his boxers (!!!!!!!!)

All of this did not sway me, nor did it detract from my enjoyment of my meal. It was THAT good. We went to Duck Pop in Santa Monica and had to come back for more. You got us, Chef Su.

Being an SF native I couldn't fathom paying $7 for one bao, so I just got the duck rice. It was like hainan chicken's more delectable grown up cousin. A nice duck leg over a bed of rice with a fried egg, yolk gloriously spilling out? Delicious.

4657306,2013-12-27,3,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Eureka Casino? Where's that? Fat Choy still retains the diner look of its predecessor but it's definitely an upgrade from Sheridan Su's former location in a salon. 

I've been craving baos all week made worse by a friend who posted a photo of homemade Momofoku-inspired baos. After being turned away at Bacchanal, I turned to Yelp in search of baos.

We ordered both the duck & pork belly baos (one order is $7 and codes with two baos). I love the duck's crispy skin with the special sauce (the recipe is actually displayed on the wall). The pork belly is braised overnight for 6 hours and is perfectly tender. It's served with mustard greens. My fiance doesn't typically like sour notes in his food but he found the mustard greens to be the perfect counterpoint to the sweet sauce. 

We also ordered the Fat Choy burger which comes with a half pound beef patty, shredded short rib, bacon, and topped with a fried egg! I only had a bite but it was pretty heavy with fatty goodness. 

This is one of the best surprise meals I've had in a long time. I wish they simplified the decor to something clean and classic but the shiny red diner seats won't deter me from going. And it doesn't seem to deter other Yelpers. The food is just so good that I'd love to see them expand.

Our friendly waitress told us that they have the Freestyle machine (the Coke machine where you can combine flavors to make like a 100+ different drinks), so I opted for a raspberry coke even though I rarely ever drink soda.  Our sodas were served in huge mugs and the raspberry coke was so good.  

We ordered the Shrimp Toast ($8) & Peking Duck Baos ($7) to share.  She ordered the PBBLT ($9) & I ordered the Fried Pork Sauce Noodles ($9).  The Shrimp Toast was a piece of toast topped with Chinese sausage, herbs, Sriracha mayo and a beautiful over easy egg.  This was delish!  I love Chinese sausage, Sriracha and an over easy egg done right...so how could I not like this dish?  Just wish there was more!  ;-)  The Peking Duck Baos were made well, a big enough piece of delicious duck (not too fatty) and the hoisin sauce in between the pillowy soft buns.  I think these were better than Chairman Bao's.  I ordered the Fried Pork Noodle because I looked at the Yelp pics and one of them showed it with what looked to be slices of fried pork; however when I got the dish in front of me it was ground pork.  It was like the minced pork and cucumber noodle dish you see at Shanghai restaurants, but the sauce is lighter here.  I still enjoyed it and it was a nice alternative to all the breads we've had in the meal.  Her PBBLT was good too, the belly was cooked a little more though and the mixed greens salad served alongside was pretty darn good for a plain salad I must say.

This isn't my first time here and it will not be my last.

Pork belly bao and Peking duck bao:  They are both very good and flavorful. I do prefer the pork belly bao over the duck because there's more meat on the pork belly. I've had the tofu and mushrooms bao in the past and it was pretty tasty for a vegetarian dish.  If I could eat a lot of these, I would in a heartbeat.  The bun is nice and soft, there's enough sauce and lots of different textures in the dish. I love it!  

Sesame noodles:  I was surprised that I liked this dish. It had a great peanut sauce/flavor. The noodles were cooked nicely and had a great bite to them. There was a good amount of chopped up vegetables and sauce in this dish. It was enough to share as well. 

Pork belly BLT with fries:  the fries were excellent - crispy and soft. If that's even possible. There was enough pork belly and bacon in this sandwich. The sourdough bread was amazing. It was buttered nicely and it was crispy. Overall it was a really good sandwich.

This place is tucked away in a casino that you have probably never heard of. It's a bit out of the way, but well worth the visit.

I've been here a few times and sampled almost everything on the menu. Nothing was disappointing, but the bao really stands out.

If you come here, you have to order at least one or hopefully all of these dishes:

Pork Belly Bao
Roast Duck Bao
Soft Shell Crab Bao

The proteins in all three dishes are cooked to perfection.

The pork belly is marinated for hours and then slow braised, then finished off on the flat top where it gets caramelized and crispy on the outside. The duck gets similar love and comes out crispy as well.

The meat is served in perfect little boa pillows with a delicious sauce and some micro greens and/or cucumber.

The soft shell crab bao is equally good, it's like eating sushi tucked into a cloud of bao goodness.

First time, we went with a group of 4, and the second was just two of us. I love the duck bao, and will definitely go back just for cravings of that one wonderful bite. It's in the Eureka, and if you don't know what you're looking for, you might have a hard time finding it from the outside.

The prices are great, and it's a perfect place for a lunch/brunch/snack while you're a bit busy, but refuse to be rushed. 

Pros:
- The food is great, and the prices make it affordable to come back, and try something new often.
- Cozy little restaurant that's not pretentious or fake. 
- Really friendly and helpful staff that are great with suggestions.

Cons:
- I reaaallly wish there was a location that didn't share air with the smoky old casino. Blergh. They do a really good job of keeping the restaurant free of the smoke, but still. I don't think I'll ever get over the smoke in vegas casinos.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,2,0,4,wu2q6933H-ZSHm7PZ2erCw

Veruka learned her lesson well since we last went out - she decided that, from now on, she's going to order whatever I order. The Tofu and Mushroom Bao was pretty tasty. The kid got the Kalbi Steak and Eggs. The order was pretty large, so he ended up taking home leftovers. Cool, no need to cook tonite! Our waitress, Michelle, was new there. She did a good job of serving us and keeping our drinks full, and also put that 100-flavor soda machine to good use. Her and the other lady that was working behind the counter said that it was the first time they made a real suicide soda.

their baos are their starter signiture. their pork belly and short ribs are braised n marinated for 24 hrs which made them so tender, juicy and just pure awesome.

the fatchoi burger is one of the best gourmet burger i have ever eaten. with a nice thick juicy patty, fried egg, cheese, and shredded short rib... it is a flavor orgy in your mouth!

if you like ducks, they actually cooked their duck legs right! so tender it will fall of the bone, not gamey, and crispy on the outside but melt in your mouth juicy on the inside.

for breakfast, they have their fusion eggs benedict, not with ham or canadian bacon, those are for the weak hearted! theirs are paired with a nice thick cut of pork belly!!!

As we exited the cab, a security guard came running out and asked our taxi driver if he could take a fare who was drunk, how drunk? Pretty drunk. Is he barfing?  He's already barfed it all out.  Well, I'll guess I'll take him.

Ugh!  Nice convo to hear as we are about to go in and order lunch.

We had the duck bao for a starter (which actually arrived way after our entrees were served) and it was excellent. Our favorite item.  The duck portion was itty bitty tho.  Maybe the size of a half dollar!

I enjoyed the seasme noodles.  The short rib and Mac and cheese grilled sandwich was good but the short rib had no flavor

The chicken teriyaki was not edible.  It was way too salty.

The restaurant is a cute little ""diner"" - and the service is AWESOME... so friendly and the FOOD - so GOOD...we were there on Valentines day and got their ""Fat Rice"" Special - it was jasmine rice with pork belly, garlic and two fried eggs.  That jasmine rice - I've NEVER had it so fluffy and the jasmine was very prominent... wonder where they get the jasmine rice from...  and you add it to the crispy little pork belly with the creamy egg yolks and whites form the fried eggs...  Was hard to stop eating....  We typically don't fill up on ""rice"" but this combo was the BEST!

We also had their short ribbed grilled cheese sandwich - it's a DELICIOUS grilled buttery sourdough sandwich stuffed with tender short rib with a mix of provolone and cheddar, with a onion jam that you dip it into and it's SO GOOD!  We devoured it or did we inhale it - let's just say it didn't sit on the plate for too long!

OH and their potsticker - so simple and delicious - I like how it's so crispy on one side - the filling is light - but dip into that one of a kind sauce - it's a symphony in your mouth... LOVED it!

I only wish we had a FAT CHOY close to home - noticed they had a lot of take out orders - so it's definitely a local favorite.

I will say also the prices are SO REASONABLE!  For all the food we had it was about $28!  And did I say the service was AWESOME...  So friendly and upbeat - was a nice fun and delicious Valentines Dinner!! :)",5SEhyIUZzJMDDPASMjXgNw,1,0,4,tNJfAVeQmhm0Fs_sOWimiA

This time we split the Duck Bao. The duck was tender and had a little piece of skin! Can you say PERFECT! It's so hard to pick what you want here. Cause I want ALL the things. I went with the special, which was the PBBLT. It was Pork Belly with Bacon, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli on Sourdough Bread and a side salad. 
Joel got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Fries. He can not stop talking about this sandwich! He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!
My Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg.

After checking Yelp, I was surprised to see that many of my Yelp Elite friends have already visited this place and have given them top notch reviews. I really trust the opinions of my Yelp comrades, so I knew I was going to love this place. 

I was surprised to find that this place was located in the middle of a run down casino called Eureka. Walking through the casino, I thought I was going to have a disappointing time. When we entered the diner, my spirits lifted. Nice read diner booth seating, bar tops and tables were ample for all sorts of parties. Our server was very thorough. When she carded us for the alcohol ordered, she asked us questions about our ID's. It was different, but appreciated. She also went through some kind of spiel about the place, but talked so fast, I wasn't able to catch what she was saying. 

For our meals, I decided to get the two recommended items: Peking Duck Bao and The Pork Belly Bao for $7 each. HOLY EVERYTHING THAT IS HOLY! These baos blew me away and really surprised me. The Peking Duck Bao: duck in an open faced steamed bun, cucumbers, scallions and hoisin sauce. The duck was perfectly cooked and flavored nicely. The cucumber and scallion brought a nice crunchy element and the hoisin brought a nice BBQ sweet flavor. What an AH-MAZE-ING dish. What's more amazing was the Pork Belly Bao: Fried pork belly, pickled mustard greens, cilantro and crushed peanuts. The belly was marbleized and perfectly fried. The peanuts helped to break up the marbleized meat. The cilantro and greens helped to bring an herb and very slightly bitter element. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE BAOS FOREVER AND EVER! 

WOW, what an awesome culinary experience. I was more surprise that this gem of a place was located in an older casino building. It truly is your treasure to find. I'm definitely coming back. VERY SOON.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,9,8,5,5Cb4jmPi88P4wOvnORs-JA
5051019,2013-01-23,1,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"The BF and I striked out at trying to go to a Japanese place with a siesta so we thought about all the things on our shortlist to try. Funny enough same thing happened to Bobby, Misti, Mamie and her hubby that they were here too! Hey! 

What a funny name though. I know most people will think Fat Choy as in the Chinese New Year greeting ""Gung Hay Fat Choy"" or maybe a cheeky nickname for someone chubby but I think of the literal translation ""hair vegetable"" which is a type of moss put in some Chinese foods. Not as cute, but also pretty tasty.

The menu is solid sounding, it was hard to decide on what to try. That is promising to me that the whole menu is well thought out I couldn't zoom into just one thing easily. We settled on sharing two things as we had a early dinner to catch though I would have loved a appetizer or dessert. 

Short rib rice bowl - this was braised bone in and was tender. They gave us two generous ribs that cooked in a sauce that reminds me much of Filipino adobo. It was a tiny bit salty for me, but I don't think it is ridiculously so. They give you a bit of salad with balsamic dressing and pickled mustard greens to go with it. It was good, but I don't know if it was $14 good. This doesn't seem like a neighborhood that drops that kind of money so I don't know how this will play out with the local patron traffic vs the foodies who will seek this out. 

Pork sauce noodles - I really liked this. The ground pork and diced tofu mixture is cooked in a hoisin-ish type sauce and thrown with some shredded carrots, cucumbers and sprouts. It reminds me of dan dan noodles, but I think I liked this better. I would definitely get this one again. 

Service was nice, but wasn't the best. The BF ordered soda and really thought it was stale tasting and let the server know and she just took it away and never offered anything else and I still had to pay for it. They give you a bottle Eureka water for free if you ask for ice water, but I never got a refill on my empty water. It took a while to be able to order and had to walk up to the counter to get our check and be on our way. It wasn't really busy and there were two ladies working the floor so I feel it should have been a bit better. 

 I wouldn't ever think to come to the Eureka and is still kind of a weird bare cafeteria-esque space, but this is a more comfortable spot than their previous incarnation in a salon in that there is seating. I am not overly smoke sensitive, but the smoke smell is strong on the casino floor and the restaurant opens out so it may be bothersome to sensitive noses. 

I see some promise of well made eats so I will be back for more Fat.

First off it's located in Eureka Casino and since the casino is so small all the smoke comes into this little restraunt which can be really bothersome to those with allergies or asthma. It was still bothersome to me even though I chose the last booth in the back of the restraunt. 

We had our hearts set on soft shell crab bao since we heard good things on yelp about them but were informed that they were seasonal and were not currently on the menu. Also as stated on yelp they didn't have a 3 piece bao combo. Talk about a buzz kill. I already knew I was going to order shortrib grilled cheese ams we would share both the bao and sandwich . Since they didn't have the soft shell crab we ordered the Peking duck bao which comes with 2 buns with meat cucumber and sprouts ? Don't quite remember but my taste buds have also forgotten them. I feel that the meat was lacking flavor and it was boring. Didn't taste fresh. 

Shortrib Grilled Cheese - our server suggested it on sourdough so I went with her opinion. I feel that the sandwich is very heavy so they serve it with a tomato jam to cut the heaviness but the tomato jam I feel didnt quite highlight or compliment the flavor of the shortrib. It was a bit greasy as well. The fries were crispy and cooked perfectly. 

Our server  Jenny was very friendly attentive and helpful with the menu  and explained how the dishes were Prepared and cooked and talked about the ingredients so forth. So this place gets 3 stars.",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,8,6,3,ffZ5m6XwqWdZQdsRKEeHaw

After some convincing, I got my husband to come with me. Eurika casino is located off the strip and the area does not look very appealing. The parking lot to the casino was decent sized for its establishment. 

The casino itself smelled so heavily cigarette stained but I raced with all my might to the restaurant. (Thanks to whoever posted the front entrance of the restaurant). 

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a kind lady. I approached the counter and looked at the menu (not sure why since I was only there for the duck bao). The same kind lady informed me there was a $1 charge for to go option but the wait would still be around 30mins (at least). I said no problem and ordered two orders of duck bao. When I have her my card to swipe, she said she would wave the dollar charge since the wait will be a while (so nice of her). The iPhone transaction thing auto texts you the receipt post payment (cool!)

We waited on the side benches and saw a signed cutting board by ""Guy"" from the food network  show. The nice lady who helped us was also in the photo with him and the owner (who the little mascot is based on I assume). 

Twenty minutes later, I received my to go box and was instructed to quickly consume contents to ensure freshness. The nice lady kept on apologizing about the wait which was not a big deal but dang, service sure is great. 

My husband and I steadfastly went to the car and opened the magic lunch box. OMG omg... They looked amazing and smelled delicious. 

I took some pictures and then in my mouth it went. Oh M g mouthgasm. The crunch of the duck skin. Tender meat. Delicious sauce and nice added cucumber crunch was simply amazing. My husband is the most picky Asian food eager and even he was like oh my god this is good. Needless to say we scarfed them down in less than 6 minutes.

You can read all about Sheridan Sui here, http://fatchoylv.com/press, but simply put: this guy knows how to make bomb food in the most random of venues. Prior to Fat Choy, located in a less-than-impressive Vegas casinos, Sui was cooking up buns in a nail salon. And people lined up out the door to taste. It's gotta be good, right? 

Don't let the smoky, seedy Eureka Casino fool you... this is gourmet Asian fusion. With a few American staples still on the menu from the coffee shop who used to inhabit the space. It's very odd to see old, trucker-looking dudes hanging out here. But it's a dichotomy that I'm willing to wrestle in exchange for a gourmet bowl of sesame noodles, plate of shrimp toast (with egg on top), bone marrow or PBBLT (pork belly, bacon, lettuce and tomato). Gluttonous and divine.

Check out the menu: http://fatchoylv.com/food, by most people's standards, this food is CHEAP. Depending on the time of day or how busy the kitchen is, there could be a bit of a wait. But really, you can't rush noms like this. Just order a Kirin from one of the waitresses and she'll bring it to you in a tall, frosted mug. 

Definitely not part of the sexy Las Vegas strip, out-of-towners should call a cab to get here. Sure, you could walk but the heat will likely do you in before you make it in one piece. And you won't want to drag a food baby back with you, either.

The pork belly in the bao was dry. Like it had been sitting around all day. The chicken bowl lacked flavor.

I've been to Vegas a few times and hit up my other options but this time I wasn't too far and had time to kill. A few of local friends recommended the spot and gave me plenty of warning as I like to gamble. 

Located in a small time Casino off Sahara Ave, the restaurant itself to me is the crown jewel. The Casino has all electronic machines ranging from penny slots to more, a bar and that's it just in case you have to wait. Don't come expecting dealers and crap tables. This is truly a local spot. 

The restaurant setup reminds you of a simple diner and that's what I liked about it. Staff was friendly and easily answered all our questions and provided recommendations that helped. We order a few things despite being only 2 of us I thought we order a bit much, but it was a splurge. We got the Pork Belly Bao, Peking Duck Bao , The Shortrib Grilled Cheese, The Fat Choy Burger... Me and my buddy split the Bao as it comes with 2 and we couldn't decide which one we like best but both agreed they were great. The Shortrib Grilled Cheese on Sourdough... BOMB!!!!

When in Vegas, my best friend (who is a Vegas native) is always tasked with taking me and the boyfriend on obscure, off the strip dining adventures.  When she and her husband picked us up from our hotel, and drove us to this casino named Eureka, I was skeptical.  First of all, the Casino looks super sketch.  It's tiny, and it's next to a tire center.  They were also remodeling, and they had the bathrooms outside in trailers.  I was ready to get back into the car, and say ""forget about it...""  They insisted that we would not be disappointed.  So we ventured into this dark and drab Casino, and walked to a tiny restaurant in the back.  I was still skeptical when we got the restaurant, because it looked like it was going to be one of those crappy diners that are open 24 hours, but serve bad food.  It was also empty.  

Anyway, on to the food.  We ordered a variety of things:  The Fat Choy Burger, pork belly bao, short rib grilled cheese, and wonton noodle soup.  The winner of this meal was definitely the short rib grilled cheese.  I know, I know..a grilled cheese sandwich, from a sketchy wannabe Chinese restaurant, at a ghetto casino off the strip...but TRUST me, it was melt in my mouth delicious.  The boyfriend ordered it, and I was green with envy as I watched him polish off the entire sandwich.  The porkbelly bao had these thick slabs of the most tender and juicy porkbelly that I've ever had.  It was also topped with pickled mustard greens, and the flavors just blended so beautifully.  I personally ordered the wonton noodle soup, and when it came out I was disappointed by its appearance, but the moment I tasted the soup, I could tell that this stock was made from bones.  Like, it was some legit noodle broth.   

Now, when I plan my next trip back to Vegas (at the end of this month), I will have Fat Choy on my list.  I must have one of those short rib grilled cheese sandwiches, and I must stuff my face full of porkbelly bao!",kNbngGqDVQddsKWDc5AIRQ,2,0,5,ceKnsJk55KuVTgMKgoZ45A

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.

I. Ordering
Between the 5 of us, we ordered 3 Fat Choy Burgers -  1/2 lb. certified angus beef, shortrib, bacon, fried egg, cheddar, onion jam ($11.99), which includes fries or salad. We ordered ours medium rare; 2 with fries, 1 with a salad.

II. The burgers
The burger patties were really big and were cooked perfectly to order. They were very juicy and obviously cooked on a grill (you can taste the char), but could have used more meat flavor. The burger texture was a little monotone; maybe pickles or onions would have helped. The flavor was also a little one dimensional. It needed a sweet or acid note. Trevor mentioned that his burger was inconsistent in flavor from bite to bite. The egg was gorgeously cooked. The bun fell apart a little bit because the burger was so juicy. 

III. The fries
The fries were really good! They reminded me of McDonald's fries, which is extremely high praise. Dennis said they were a smidge too salty for his taste. Sumana really enjoyed her salad that was drenched in balsamic (gave her that acid note the rest of us were missing).

IV. Miscellaneous
Fat Choy is located inside the Eureka casino, which is a little bit off the strip. The ventilation in the casino is not very good so the smoke really permeates everywhere, including inside the restaurant. The restaurant itself is really cute and has some fun decoration. It was pretty chill and didn't have a lot of people there (surprising given we went during lunch time on a Saturday). They had good music playing, and our server (Tammi) was really great. Super friendly! This place is pretty easy to get to and has plenty of parking.

V. Value
Again, there was some debate regarding the value of this burger. Some of us thought it was a good value considering it comes with a side. Others of us thought it was priced a little high for what it was.

VI. The verdict
Decent burgers. I'm really curious about their baos, which are their specialties. I'll have to come back for one of those. The ratings: 3.2, 3.3, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1.

Beginning as a food truck called 'Great Bao' before migrating to the unexpected environs of the Eureka Hotel Fat Choy had been getting a lot of press preceding my trip to Las Vegas and with an all day Sunday brunch menu I decided to pay Sheridan Su's Asian Fusion spot a visit for some early evening dining; second hand smoke be damned, anyplace serving bao, roti, and waffles on the same menu warranted my attention.  Located in the corner of a space best defined as 'questionable' and more appropriately 'seedy' I was admittedly impressed at how separated Fat Choy seemed from the casino and how well the smoke from the slots was excluded from the dining experience and after getting past these issues I was even happier to find the service aspects of the restaurant far better than the typical ""Chinese restaurant"" and actually on par with many high end places on the strip.  With a small crowd of varying ages and ethnicities I made a simple inquiry about the shrimp toast (not typically on the brunch menu) and was assured the chef would be happy to prepare it and although each dish I ordered was good the funky sausage juxtaposing shrimp and tinged with spicy mayo all melded together with a fried egg was undoubtedly the 'must try' dish of the meal.  Opting next for a crunchy waffle topped with somewhat mundane chicken and a bit of Sriracha spiked syrup alongside the signature Duck Bao - a great rendition with pillowy bread, crisp skin, and snappy pickles all playing for center stage - I think it is safe to say that sticking with less ""American"" food is in one's best interest, though the fusion focused crisp roti topped nutella, rich mascarpone, smoky walnuts, and ample honey makes me think that perhaps something like a Korean style chicken and waffles could be just the right thing to add to the menu.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,4,8CfpVaRUsaDZMMznFhbK7Q
5308173,2013-01-13,3,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"I am most conflicted. I have met Sheridan Su and he is a great guy. But the restaurant Chris and Joseph went to recently was nowhere close to the restaurant I ate at. Hey it's great to have friends write puff reviews but in the long term it truly does Sheridan a disservice.

First, the good- the Pot Stickers. Yes, they were good and tasty. But once the order was placed they took 30 minutes to come out  and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant.  Plus I saw Sheridan AND another cook in the kitchen.  Does this neighborhood really support five small Pot Stickers selling for seven bucks?
 
This is my major beef with Fat Choy, there is a total disconnect with the menu and the neighborhood. Examples: They open for breakfast at 8am...this is a working class area...the working class is at work at 8am...also, pancakes and eggs sell for eight bucks...again maybe that works but not here. How about a breakfast special to draw people in...this is not Robuchon's...

Back to the meal. I ordered  beer and I believe they brought me something close to a 40oz...I laughed...largest bottled beer I have ever had with dinner...who came up with that...

Pork Belly BLT....I was excited to try this, unfortunately the pork belly was more like bacon bits...there were hardly any there...I asked for extra sriracha mayo and there was not enough to even taste...and the bread was totally soaked in grill grease...absolutely brutal execution...

Please understand I want nothing but success for Sheridan. But I have never walked out of a restaurant feeling the owner had such a disconnect with concept and presentation as what Sheridan has done with Fat Choy.

About the food...we got 2 orders of pork belly bao since the duck bao was not available today (boo!), bone marrow and shrimp toast.

Pork Belly Bao:
For $7 you get 2 pieces of bao.  The pork was crunchy but super salty (hello, hypertension!).  They could've added more sauce to neutralize the saltiness 3.5/5

Shrimp Toast:
$8 gets you a piece of toast with shrimp, Chinese sausage and a fried egg on top.  It was good.  But not $8 good. You can get shrimp toast at most Chinese restaurants for half the price  3/5

Bone Marrow:
$8 of fatty goodness with good onion jam on top.  5/5

I usually don't pay attention to the price when it comes to food.  But today I had to.  I think Fat Choy is overrated and overpriced for what I get and where I'm getting it from.  I can understand paying $8 for shrimp toast if I were in Bellagio or Wynn.  I can get 3 pieces of bao from somewhere else for the same price.  The concept is great but needs to be improved before I can come back again.  Maybe next time, I'll just order food to-go...oh wait, they charge $1 for that!

It looks like the next review I'll be doing is for a hospital...",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,4,3,QwYY1YleYjsuJ6aQB5LtmQ
5320548,2015-05-10,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Inside the small Eureka Casino, Fat Choy's is a perfect blend of American Diner meets Asian comfort food. 

When we dined there it was a rainy Saturday night, which meant the restaurant was pretty empty. People don't go out in the rain I guess. From my yelp research and with assistance from the server, we ordered the short rib grilled cheese, pork bao, sesame noodles, and a wedge salad (to be 'healthy').

The grilled cheese was by far the stand out. It was exactly what I wanted it to be. It had that good 'merican taste combined with rich short rib. It came with a side of tomato dipping sauce to cut some of the richness. Maybe it's the Asian side of me, but I would have preferred a pickled veggie on the side, like some kimchi or cabbage to cut the richness. I guess I needed more vinegary than what the tomato-y sauce offered. 

The pork bao was delicious! The bao were nice little fluffy pillows on which the pork belly could rest. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the sesame noodles. It was a pretty big portion and I got tired of them quickly. I wanted them to have more sesame oil on them and I thought it also could have benefited from more veggies like cabbage or sprouts to contrast the noodles. But, they weren't bad and I could see why people like them.  

I had a great time at Fat Choy and I'll be back for the really friendly/enthusiastic service, short rib grilled cheese, the bao, and whatever other creative menu items might be on for the day.",gMuoaaZZ2BsBiXuVCHh5zg,2,0,4,H1P-cyHWJl9t_B1fTwdMBw
5322906,2013-11-01,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Fat Choy, you stole my heart today.

A friend told me about this delightful establishment and as any faithful Yelpers would do, I bookmarked the spot. I happened to find myself on the East side of town with a friend and we got our FC on.

Fat Choy is located in the Eureka casino. It's a cute little coffee shop tucked in the corner. The place was clean and had bright red, Asian decor in the space. Put waitress was over in a Jiffy. She handed us menus and took our drink order, they have a coca-cola freestyle (a million flavor combos, y'all). My friend and I decided to order a few different things and split them. Our waitress informed us that everything is cooked to order. It takes a bit longer to get the food (nothing excessive), and it's totally worth the wait.

Round 1. Grandma's Potstickers and Wonton Soup.

The potstickers were fresh and I don't remember the name of the sauce that came with it, but it was divine. Light and with fresh herbs. I can imagine it will go well with just about anything. The wonton soup was also super fresh (you will hear that a lot because it was super, duper fresh). Big pieces of brocoli, thinly sliced carrots, and other yummy veggies, as sprinkled with fresh herbs. A definite must try!

Round 2: The Short Rib Grilled Cheese and Duck Bao.

May we please have a moment of silence for the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. 

This is one of the most decadent sandwiches around. Gooey cheese, succulent tender shredded short rib. Mouth-gasms, y'all. I recommend sharing this bad boy, it's very, very rich, but oh so good.

The Duck Boa was served in a deconstructed style; instead of being steamed all together in a bun. The bun was steamed and then folded in half, with crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. Delightful, light and filling. 

I recommend going with a friend and sharing a few items. Everything is reasonable priced (about $6 to $10 per item). I cannot praise Fat Choy enough. Great atmosphere, amazing customer service, and top notch grinds. Fat Choy, I'll be seeing you soon.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,5,4,5,-Biypdg103SEqXBm_kwhnA

5361306,2013-04-03,2,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"**Summary**
       - Food - Everything I've tried thus far was beyond my expectations. The waitress told me the owner put everything he liked to eat on the menu. I guess this owner has some pretty good tastes.
       - Area - So this place isn't in the greatest part of town. It's in what use to be a diner in a rinky dink casino. The casino is smokey, but the dining area isn't too bad.
       - Decor - Once you get to the restaurant, it feels very cozy. It has a diner feel with Asian decorations that seemed like an afterthought.
       - Food truck - I believe this restaurant is owned by the same owners as the Great Bao. I never actually tried the food truck, but there's paintings on the walls that point to this fact.
**Ordered**
       - $10 Fat Choy Burger - I don't even know where to explain how great this burger is. Braised short rib, bacon, egg, and special sauce on a burger patty. The braised short rib they put on the 1/2 burger patty is the perfect saltiness that it almost renders the bacon redundant. Yes, I know. I said it. It was better than bacon. It is the perfect blend of salty meats, juicy burger, gooey yolk, and sweet Asian sauce to make me want to come back again. It came with fries, but the fries were just ehh.
       - $8 Shrimp Toast - First time I've had this anywhere and it's hard to describe. It's egg, chopped up sausage, and some kinda sauce on top of a toast. It sounds super weird, but once you bite into it, it all makes sense. It's like those seafood toast things at buffets, but way better.
       - $7 Peking Duck Bao - They come in pairs and they're just like the Peking Duck you'd get at an authentic Chinese wedding. The only difference is usually it's mostly duck skin. This is a lot more meatier. It's delicious.
       - $9 Pork Noodles - Dry noodles with chopped up pork on it for flavor. They were excellent. The minced pork was just salty enough to complement the slightly sweet noodles and not overpower it.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a unique Asian Fusion place. It's a hole in the wall, but it's also a gem.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,11,9,5,mgzXNjMw7hvp4bhWa9ILsw

We knew we had to try the bao and the burgers so we ordered both.  When the bao arrived to the table, they both looked so appealing, making my mouth water.  

The pork belly was a big strip of pork  which was decent in size, with a layer of fat and a crispy skin.  The cilantro and pickled mustard greens with peanuts pulled it all together.

The Peking duck bao was good with a hoisin sauce and cucumbers, but it was the pork belly bao that stood out.

We ordered their Fat Choy Burger which made the top 10 burger list, but we asked for the egg over hard, I don't care for runny yolks. The angus beef patty was juicy and cooked to perfection and the braised short ribs were so tender it almost melted in my mouth.

You can get better duck in Chinatown. But I did love the grilled cheese with the short ribs it was so cheesy and they didn't skimp on the short ribs either each bite was filled with meat and cheese. If anything I wouldn't explore the menu and just come back for the grilled cheese to take out.

I normally look at new restaurants that have a good rating on here with a little bit of pessimism, friends and family padding the rating.

But yeah it's the real deal, amazingly good food at a great price.

Pork Belly Bao, very nicely done, it could of done with just a touch more cooking time, just to bring out the flavors in the pork belly, but that may well be a personal thing.

Shortrib grilled cheese.....This may well go down as an all time great, seriously, if you can't decide what to eat, just get this.

Fat Choy burger, another great dish, the egg cooked to perfection, the burger cooked as ordered (an amazingly rare thing in Vegas), the short rib added a nice taste to the burger.

Tirimisu cake, mmm not sure it should really be called tirimisu, it's more of a cake with a coffee flavored cream topping.

Red Velvet cake, wife loved it.

The service was excellent, drinks refilled quickly.

Negatives, only one, those darn frozen french fries show up again, seriously, can understand where it may be easier, but fresh, home made fries are so much better and really, a chef of this talent as much as he may not like having fries on the menu, could do so much with them.

THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!

First I went alone and had both of the Bao and the bone marrow. The Bao were pretty good but the bone marrow was not cooked properly and I swear as God is my witness the grilled bread that accompanied it was half of a HOT DOG BUN!

Still, gave it another try with my Girlfriend. We again ordered both the Bao and they were pretty good, the potstickers were very greasy and under filled, better to buy the frozen ones from Trader Joe's.

Then the sandwiches:  She ordered the short rib grilled cheese and I the Fat Choy burger with crispy fries. It was not busy but they took forever to arrive. The grilled cheese was dry with very little flavor except for a slightly rancid odor and taste, my burger which was ordered medium rare was also dry and overcooked, the fries were limp and greasy. Every dish was highly oversalted as well.

Our server, I believe her name was Emily, was charming and very efficient but she could not make up for the slowness of the kitchen. I was given a properly cooked burger to go and it was marginally better but there is a limit to what can be done with a cheap ready-made patty.

There must have been a fair amount of Kool-Aid drunk by many Fat Choy reviewers and it helps no one, not the owner/chef or the potential customers. This place could be fixed, it's a good concept and menu but the execution and cooking are pretty dreadful as are some of the ingredient choices.

As it stands now, Fat Choy is a 1.5 star experience, sadly it's less than a mile from my house. Bachi Burger is more expensive and over 15 miles from my house, we choose Bachi every time.

The waitress was very nice but she must have misunderstood us and only gave us one order of the duck bao instead of two orders. It was near closing time so we didn't want to say anything. 

The duck bao is definitely something I would get again on my next visit. It was very tasty but small, I guess that's why it's listed under snacks on the menu. Two pieces of bao come in one order so the boyfriend and I shared. We also shared the short rib grilled cheese, and OMG, I want all my grilled cheese sandwiches from now on to taste like the grilled cheese sandwich I had from here. The meat was so tender and tasty.

The restaurant is small and very casual, and is located inside the Eureka Casino which is a small, smoked-filled casino on East Sahara. I don't usually come to this part of town so I had never even heard of the casino until I read about Fat Choy.

And, then to add fluff Ice to the mix... forget it!  Can it get any better, I think not.

It took me about 10 minutes to get to the Eureka Casino, where Fat Choy is.  Here's a tip.  Not the best part of town, so make sure you lock your doors and set your alarm.  But, they have a security guard near the parking lot making sure things are kosher.  

Met a group of people and we walked through the casino to get to Fat Choy.  It's a small casino and has a bit of smokiness to it.  Not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but noticeable. But, not at all noticeable in Fat Choy itself. 

We enter Fat Choy and Jennifer, who waited on us, already had a table set up for us.  She was awesome too.  She wanted to make sure we were all happy and went the extra mile.  

We waited for the rest of our group to show up.  There were 10 or so at our table and we also took over a couple of booths.  We totally took over the place.  

So, Jennifer came around and took our order and went over it to make sure everything was right.  Told you she went the extra mile.

I had the Fat Choy burger.  Incredible.  Look at the picture I added just for the drool.  I was also looking at the other choices others have made.  And, I will be back to try those too.  

And, then the fluff Ice came out.  What a great way to end a meal.  And, we even got a complimentary coffee flavored fluff ice.  Extra mile by everyone at Fat Choy.  5 stars for sure.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,19,18,5,Zs6yBHRiidJpsmsbDOORLA

The duck rice was a little bit of a disappointment. I got a lump of soggy rice with some kind of sweet and sugary soy sauce on top and there was not enough sauce because while the duck leg  was nicely cooked, it wasn't marinated well so it was a little bit bland and definitely needed some dipping sauce.

We ordered the pork belly bao, soft shell crab bao, peking duck bao, wonton soup, chicken and waffles, eggs benedict with pork belly, and a pancakes and sausage breakfast. For 5 of us the bill came out to be $75 including tip! Oh and we ordered coffee too.

This place is located in the back of a pretty bad casino in a pretty bad area . .no complaints there, it's a true dive and cool to see a standout spot!
The diner is definitely in nicer shape than the casino, and all the waitresses were extremely friendly, fun, courteous, and sweet!

Taking a look at the menu, we chose the following - (also shown on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives) 

Pork belly bao: two to an order, soft bao buns with thick, yet soft tender juicy pork belly slices, a schmear of hoisin sauce, topped with peanuts, mustard greens, and cilantro. These were so good!! The highlight of the meal and really happy to try them

Short rib grilled cheese - on sourdough and a side of crispy fries, the bread was toasted so well, nice and crispy! The Sandwich looked so cheesy, and it was, but it seems they were out of cheddar and provolone cheese as stated in the menu . . all I tasted was American cheese, unfortunately. The short rib was soft, juicy, but not too flavorful. I didn't taste any onion jam, and the tomato dip tasted like marinara. 

Sesame noodles - these were alright, again nothing special and they came out cold. The noodles were thick, juicy, and had a good bite. the combination of flavors was good and a slight kick from the sriracha with a bonus savory flavor from the bean curd, but it just didn't ""wow"" us",iqsUoSxTpzAxt8AX8OgSZA,2,0,3,5Pnk726dCRBH1gdWweFmKA

 The waitress was sweet, there was zero wait on Saturday at 10pm, it has a cute look of a 50's diner with a few Chinese decor accents. And the fries were tasty. 
 That's about it. The food is heavy, fatty and greasy. Most of the flavor seemed to come from fat. Pork belly bao, to be fair, should be exactly that- fatty pork belly, and it was. 
 Fat Choy burger patty was fatty and juicy, but not especially tasty or well seasoned, and short rib topping overpowered everything else.  
 Lastly, short rib grilled cheese- again, fatty and greasy with no amazing flavors to speak of.

5609915,2014-01-12,0,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"This started off as a quest to find the Great Bao Truck street vendor with the great reviews on Yelp. It turns out the truck has temporarily disappeared and has instead morphed into a diner style restaurant called Fat Choy in the Eureka Casino.

The Eureka Casino is an unusual location for the vegas Mecca of Pork Belly goodness. It is a tiny smokey third tier casino filled with just slot machines, most of which are penny machines. It will take you decades to blow your retirement at a casino like this with penny slot machines. It seemed that many of the patrons were doing just that.

The second thing you should know is that it is not exactly on the strip. It is on the corner of 6th and Sahara, which at certain times of days is more difficult to convince a cab to pick you up than the middle of Death Valley National Park. Don't come here unless you have a car to get back to your hotel. I spent over 90 minutes and a dozen phone calls trying to convince a cab to come out here.

Once you have dealt with these two hurdles you can look forward to some great food. Fat Choy has Great pork belly and Peking Duck Bao. These are their two signature dishes.

The Pork Belly Bao is a Taiwanese classic, and Fat Choy does a pretty authentic version. Great asian steamed bread, lots of slow cooked pork belly with the crust of cilantro peanuts and sugar. I prefer a little more sugar crust, but these are the best Bao I have had in Vegas.

The Peking Duck Bao was also surprisingly good. Perfectly cooked fally duck, with just the right amount of spring onion and Hoisin sauce.

The Eureka Casino is a very unusual location for a foodie gem like this. I would have expected a Popeyes Chicken or Burger King as the resident restaurant. I guess its synergistic; for the chef the kitchen is more roomy than what you find on a food truck and for dinners, you have tables and a roof. I just didn't see many of the retiree patrons fully appreciating this Taiwanese Pork Belly Mecca as they feverishly work down their 401Ks in the smoke heavy air.    

If you are a fan of Taiwanese Pork Belly Bao and can survive the journey to a smoky little casino in the middle of nowhere, you are in for a food treat.",kpL9GJYRkE_DYV6dsM-Y_g,5,1,4,-N209L2-4Ya0OC_OxGkqmQ

5778785,2013-06-20,1,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"So I've been here a bunch of times and I still really like their food, but this place definitely has some issues. So far, we've only been there for lunch, and been pretty empty each time - there's never been more than 3 other tables filled. I'll give restaurants leeway for being slow and inattentive when they're understaffed and busy, but there's always been 2 waitresses and 2 or 3 people in the kitchen.

I think the asian waitress that came over from Great Bao is amazing - friendly, knowledgable on the food and really on it. The other 2 or 3 I've had....not so much. They've given me the wrong order twice despite being it empty, and only having a total of 5 burgers/sandwiches to choose from. This time they got the right food, but they forgot to add the egg to my pbblt - there's always something w/ this place.

We usually eat there, then I get 2 or 3 separate orders to bring back for my coworkers. Today my VP noticed that the receipt said $9, then magically the total became $10 - see pic. Leave it to a finance guy to notice something like that. 

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3yRadq4tgXdb_zjDa4KwPA&userid=dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA

So evidently Fat Choy thinks it's ok to charge $1 for each to go order without telling anyone about it up front, or even listing it on the receipt. With fees - it is what it is, and I have no problem paying it. But I think it's way sheisty and deceitful to slip it in without informing anyone AND hiding it on the receipt. 

It's not printed on the menu and despite what the person on the phone said, no waitress has ever mentioned it to me at any point. I was told that it was clearly posted on the cash register. Which nobody really even pays at because they have waitresses and nothing is ready made, so you end up sitting and waiting for your food regardless of what you order. 

Yeah it's just effen $1 but since I get separate orders for my coworkers, that has added up over time. I've never understood to-go fees anyway - is it because they don't get tipped for take out orders? It's not about the cost of the box, because you're never charged to take home leftovers, so why would you have to pay $1 for the privilege not to have also dirtied a plate, silverware and cup? 

So whatever, next time I'm just ordering everything for eat in, dirtying plates, then making you bring me boxes for them. And please don't spit in my food because I still gave you 4 stars even though you guys p*ss me off sometimes....",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,4,1,4,hPsMeDvTAfqTuY0YoVqGsg

I actually walked out just to double check I was in the actual Fat Choy restaurant. 

The restaurant is small, very small, with a 50's diner fill. Two tv's on the wall and a mix of hip hop and 90's surfer/skater punk rock. The menu is small but it seems as though you can order off the menu. They offered two different specials today but I went with an off the menu Pork Belly BLT. A mix of Bacon, Pork Belly, Tomato, Iceberg Lettuce on top of two slices of sour dough bread. It was creamy, and delicious. The pork was fatty but super tender. This sandwich is super rich, I would rather share it than eat the entire thing myself.

I also enjoyed the pan fried potstickers which were awesome. I was told these were the Chef's mothers recipe and were a perfect way to start. They were crispy fried on one side adding great texture and soft on the back. This gave the potsticker a really nice chew, one of my favorite potstickers to date.

I'm excited to try some of the other options on the menu in the future. This food is not for the health conscious, and I think it's intentional. It's about packing Big Flavors inside a little restaurant, inside of a little casino just off the strip.

Open til 10pm Sun-Thurs, midnight Fri-Sat you'll find a clean and dazzling place to crash, recover and certainly chow down with a menu amazing with flavors and well thought for the cultured pallete.

Usually the place fills up but I was lucky to hit it late night and it's so comfortable. You have a counter, tables and booths. Big screens with sports and the Food Network. Staff are fast,friendly and love to describe the dishes and the quality they put into them.

For what you see being served, you pay half of what you would find in fancier spots on the strip but get ALL the taste and portions. Expect to spend from $7 - $14 depending on appetite; My bill with tea was $12. 
They even have one of those 100+ Coke mix machines! I ordered the Fat Choy burger with fries: 1/2 lb burger made with (over night marinated) short ribs, bacon and a perfect sunny side up egg.

The Chef Sheridan Su is a perfectionist; even the fries were perfectly crisp and light. See, a cook moves out food; a Chef will not put anything out UNLESS it is something THEY would eat. They stay in control of the prep, purchasing  and delivering the finished product. He put in time at some of the best places on the strip and has struck out on his own with this; you should take advantage of it and avoid fighting the strip to ""eat gourmet at a Denny's price"". If there was one thing I could ask for it would be for Chef Su to teach a class for other restaurant cooks on how to correctly make bacon.

short rib grilled cheese:  Nice crunch to the bread, and the gooeyness of the cheese goes well with the short rib.  Comes with fries or salad.  Fries were just meh.  Salads would've been a fresh spring mix.  About the reviewers who complained about the grease factor here:  I didn't think that even a plain grilled cheese could be termed ""health food.""  Throw in some short rib and...well, what did you think you were ordering?!

roasted duck bao:  Bao part was perfectly moist and textured.  Duck was good, too.  I would have preferred more fillings though.  I know it normally comes with the duck sauce and green onions, but I expected a little more creativity for the cost.  You only get two.

shrimp toast:  Good.  Even better with the runny egg yolk.  Def a must order.

Fat Choy Burger:  Reasonable price for a burger on the strip.  Still just a burger with short rib.  
 
PBBLT:  BLT with rib that tasted like a simple BLT.

Duck Rice:  I thought this was good and a must order.  My husband was not as impressed.

Fried Pork Sauce Noodles:  My least favorite.  Sauce was too thick on the rice noodles (?).  Would not order again.  

Service was likely the best part of the meal.  Jenny, our server, was the only one working and she made sure everything ran smoothly.  I saw mostly locals there, and even a table that probably only came to Eureka Casino for Fat Choy, like us.

5863120,2014-01-20,3,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Tough decision but the Fat Choy burger is my new #1 burger.

I did a search on Yelp Talk in Las Vegas for best burger, and from the multitude of recommendations, I chose to try Fat Choy.  Their burger did not disappoint...  If you fancy yourself a burger aficionado, you must try theirs!

Fat Choy is a Chinese fusion diner tucked away in the Eureka casino.  The unassuming ambience did not undermine my experience...

What is in the burger?  1/2 lb burger patty, braised short rib, cuts of bacon, subtle sweet sauce, fried egg, and a sweet bun (?).  Also comes with lettuce and tomato.  

Enough short rib but not overpowering the patty--good balance.  

Crispy cuts of bacon adds a crunchy texture on some bites.  Many burgers that come with bacon don't serve crispy bacon.  Instead you take a bite and hope you shear of a clean piece of bacon, but what usually happens is you can't bite off the bacon and end up eating almost the entire strip of bacon in that one mouthful.  Fat Choy cooks the bacon to a crisp and cuts the bacon into squares.  No need to battle with the bacon for a bite sized piece.  While  bacon is not listed on the menu description of the burger, I found the crunchy texture to be a wonderful surprise.    

The color of the bun was either a potato or a sweat bread bun.  Bun--sweet and soft.  My favorite type of bun...

In many ways, a perfect burger...

Service was terrific. Diane was friendly, outgoing, and charismatic. Askd many times how i was doing...  

I am definitely returning to Fat Choy on future visits to Vegas.  I might even try other options such as the pork belly bao which is highly touted in many reviews...",vNqJm3mlYnqxFrLBi_NViQ,14,10,5,2-M9Fhmt2NEhr0vD5mJgfA

However, they recently changed their fries and what they have now is the basic, thick, bland potato wedge. Not impressive. That aside, the service was great and everyone who works there is extremely nice and helpful. Will definitely consider coming back again.",eV6wMkE_VIJDUrRTHOnTVQ,1,0,4,mqQ4Cw0nk3L9OO6LVIkE9w

Arrived at Eureka around 3pm on a sunday and the place was empty. Same goes for Fat Choy: only me and a couple inside a booth. 

Ordered pork belly bao as appetizer and short rib rice as entree. both were terrific!! Bao was so good that I could've eaten 10 of those.  Short rib was also amazing. So tender that I had no problem eating with chopsticks. 

I left as a happy customer, really. Food was great, service was fast and friendly. I didn't have a problem with the casino at all -or the smell of it, as other yelpers have pointed out-. 

I will definitely be back. Great new place.",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,11,10,4,RYogGjWoprMWVDgDao9-IQ

Man no need for a cigarette after dinner just breathe and you'll get your nicotine fix!

I don't know thee history of Fat Choy but I am assuming that it's a cooperative effort as they had Great Bao items on the menu and desserts by another chef. 

Anyhow 
I've always been a fan of Great bao back when I had to get my nails done to get their buns (joking!) so getting Peking duck bao's were a no brainer.. 
They were just like I remember them except for the smell of nail polish remover. Hmm thinking about it now, I should've brought a little bottle and opened it up while I ate them for nostalgia purposes... 

Since it as a 2x kind of day we also opted for the fabled grill cheese (on sourdough) and the Fat Choy burger.

OK people I'm Not going to lie and say that the Fat Choy burger blew my mind. The little hamster in my head was all giddy when I read that there is kalbi and bacon in a burger. When I think of Kalbi I think of Korean short ribs so naturally I was thinking I'd get a nice slab of BBQ goodness in the bun. No the case here, the kalbi was more like bulgogi or Korean brisket. It was tasty but not what I was expecting so it didn't taste right in my mind. Don't get me wrong, the burger was decent just not what my brain and taste buds had a major conflict. Thinking about it now, I am not too sure but I didn't taste any onion jam or secret sauce either. I recall some thousand island (oops) dressing on the bun though. 
Like I said no major wow factor on this one for me. This one didn't kick me in the mouth nor make me wanna slap my momma.. 

For some reason my brain and taste buds got in sync for this one. 
The grilled cheese was AWESOME! I am a sucker for sourdough sandwiches and for a grilled cheese deluxe. I think I may have to dethrone Babystacks' Kalua Pig Grilled cheese and make this concoction king of grill cheese in my mental kingdom!. 
The marinara sauce on the side was a great touch. I'll have to remember that next time I whip one of these up. 


Here's the breakdown:
Great Bao's 4*
Fat Choy Burger 3*
Kalbi Grilled Cheese 4*
Dessert _______ To be continued
Service 3*

3.5* for me but I have to say it was more of a 3. 
We will be back for the grilled cheese  and we will make sure that we have dessert and that will decide the last stars fate...

Till then

5915711,2013-08-02,11,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Who knew that you could find good solid eats inside a small casino off of Sahara on the east/central side of town?

The menu and set up is simple - just take an American diner and serve it with good ole Asian eats mixed with just a little Americana. 

I wish I could easily say that you have to come here and just try the one thing that absolutely rocks but in the end everything is good. From their tacos, to the bao, to the burgers and pot stickers. So I guess what I am saying is come hungry and come more than once. 

Their bao's are my favorite. No matter which one you order, they have a perfect balance of flavors and textures. Their tacos are mini sized but full and bursting with the flavor. The burger will make your tongue slap the insides of your mouth. (My mouth is watering. I am ready for another visit just writing this review).

And something as simple as fries they do just right. Crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. My two year old is a picky, picky eater even when it comes to something like fries and we had to sit and wait for him to finish every single last fry.

The servers now serve the food and describe to you what you are getting. Or at least on my last visit they did. It's food foreplay. Just tantalizing your taste buds before you take your first bite. 

I will be back soon. I have got to try their bone marrow and I am sure based on my past two experiences, I will not be disappointed. Maybe I will see you there!


P.S. A definite plus I might add is that my first visit they didn't have high chairs, now they do. :) You can bring your kiddos.

And I meant to take more pics on our last visit but we just started eating and then it was gone before we knew it :(",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,19,14,5,IKZX6isKV4fbrHry0mct-Q
5922244,2014-03-30,26,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Yo Imma let you finish but Fat Choy has one of the best burgers in all of Vegas!!!!
Have you ever had a meal so surprisingly good that you had to go full kanye? Well Fat Choy did that to me. Now I'll be honest, fat Choy isn't a place I would've found normally because it's inside the eureka casino, which is one of those off strip casinos that seem to be filled with the same group of anonymous gamblers. 
The decor is interesting. It's diner style, lots of interesting pictures and a chalkboard with the daily special
Now about that food. There's the pork belly BLT, it's exactly what it sounds like, a BLT with pork belly that's so soft and tender that it's  slap yo mama good. The duck bao was money. I found out after that they started off as a food truck selling that, which makes sense. The piece de resistance is the eponymous fat Choy burger. Im gonna just roll call the ingredients, please try to not drool on the screen: half pound patty, short ribs, bacon, egg, onion jam, plus all the regular burger fixings on a soft bun. I demolished that burger quicker than usain bolt does the 100m. 
Long story short, this place is filthy good. I love this place, everyone I brought here loves it. Odds are if you read this far you'll love it too",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,25,21,5,KM47VTYPffKLB9ZXUpPJxg

It's not in the best area of Vegas so please beware.  I was a bit thrown off by this, but I wanted to try it for lunch. It's a real diner with vinyl seats. The servers were extremely nice and patient with me as I figured out what I wanted. I ended up ordering the pork belly bao and the fat choy burger, which were both amazing. I could have filled up on Baos but had to try the burger. The price was also good.  I can't say that I would come again as there were a few issues with patrons in the casino that I witnessed while waiting for my taxi that were disturbing or at least I won't go by myself again.

5951246,2013-11-26,2,HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,"Our locally-based friend and Las Vegas Weekly didn't ""steer"" us wrong when recommending this Asian American restaurant. 

We enjoyed generously-sized tender beefy hamburgers inside the tiny non-descript Eureka casino. Secret sauce recipe is on the wall! The burgers were so juicy, we needed extra napkins to wipe our fingers and wrists. We also tried the pork belly bao buns, which were a tasty novelty. The pork belly had a good fat to meat ratio and had a nicely crisp exterior. We brought an order of the duck baos for my friend's two kids and they scarfed down the baos so quickly we didn't even get to try a tiny bit! 

A few of the positive things about Fat Choy aside from the damn good food - it wasn't pricey (average price for a great burger), there was no wait, the server was experienced, parking was super easy and we didn't get lost once we were inside the casino. The negative - there weren't a lot of customers, so the server disappeared into the kitchen for long stretches of time. I needed a water refill and extra napkins. I ended up draining both glasses of water on the table, before she came back. Since the food we ate was pretty damn good, we would definitely go back and try some of Asian items on the menu!",UiGjeRQyDE8rxgE-0hisaw,3,4,4,ET8zRlW_pc84P1rZD0TtYw

Seems like they are consistently understaffed. They have the Coke machine with a million flavors but are always out of classic flavors, what's up with that?
Mainly only come here for the burgers since they're delicious and a great value. The ranch is bomb as well. I like the bao, but anything else I try is not to my liking. 
Fat Choy started out strong, the experience is just inconsistent now. But I definitely bring my friends here because it is worth it to give it a try.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,6,1,3,y-NrssXFG9JEwPR8611QVQ

This place is a hidden gem, literally a hole in the wall (and they own up to it in the menu ha)! Don't let the sketchy casino steer you away. It is an americanized diner with Asian influence of flavor and accents of lanterns in the interior. 

The meat is cooked to your liking - which I prefer to have as medium rare, and I suspect they make their own patties, because it does not taste as if frozen. Very flavorful but I don't mind a bit of Sriracha to spice up my life! if you're in the area or near the strip but don't want to pay strip prices for just as good of food try it.
