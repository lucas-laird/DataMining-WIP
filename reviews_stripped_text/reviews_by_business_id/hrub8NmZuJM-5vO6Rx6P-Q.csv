Rod Stewart was playing at Caesar's Palace, this hotel is close by. 
The room was ok but old, the long walks thru the casino to get anywhere was full of smoke from smokers. 
We asked the clerk at the checkin counter where there was a fine dining restaurant, she advised the Cortez Room, there at the Gold Coast Hotel. 
The meal at the Cortez Room was hands down is the worst meal we have ever had in Las Vegas in the 35 years traveling there. We had to send ever item back, change our order, because we could not eat what was being served, The menu it self was very old fashioned, nothing healthy. The staff just kept taking it back. 
We observed numerous tables doing the same. There was nothing served fresh, only frozen and microwaved. The manager only comped half the meal. 
We also complained to head of the food and beverage department. 
This manager took our phone number and said he was going to contact us the next night to make it right, but never contacted us. The price of the meal was very expensive for this horrible menu. I even got sick the following day.
I will never stay at the Gold Coast Hotel again.

The two of us had dinner there that evening and we were very impressed.
The Chef came to our table and helped us order a cake for our special evening.
We brought our own wine and paid a small corkage fee-- very small compared to other restaurants in Vegas.
One mishap--the grooms dinner plate with his order of halibut on it was dropped as it was leaving the kitchen.  They asked us if we wanted them to hold up on the other nine orders until his was ready--we said no.  So he drank his wine while we ate.
He said the Halibut was worth the wait.  Also, they removed his charge from the bill.

The service was awesome. Seeing that a lot of their staff was Filipino, I played that card being Pinoy myself and they took care of my friend and me like we were royalty. They may treat everyone that way but I'm just saying ...

The hostess made sure to take care of the little things like my friend's birthday dessert. That was so good that my friend saved a piece to take to go.

Located inside the Gold Coast, you'll have to walk through all the smoke, all the slots, and people just drowning in their gambling debts. This place is old school gambling compared to the newer places built on the strip. But, the food at the Cortez Room has been one of the better places I've eaten in Vegas!

I've tried food from the most expensive restaurants and buffets to the cheapest and lousiest dining places in Vegas. I can tell you, steak here is not as good as I've had at N9NE or at any place that marks their meat from $30-60, but it blows Ellis Island out of the water (Ellis Island being the worst place to eat in Vegas). 

A 10oz prime rib dinner, with salad, and a side of potatoes will cost you $15. The meat was juicy, tender, and cooked exactly the way I expected it to be: medium rare. My only complaint goes to the salad. I ordered my salad with the house dressing and my salad was swimming in a pool of dressing. It was so sour, I couldn't finish it. But the complimentary bread is great especially with the dips they give you.

As for the service? They were sweet and attentive but that might be because they knew people we were dining with. It's nice and cozy inside with old school decor. I'll be coming back here when I'm in need of an inexpensive food and good service!",5ZhwDuvwhghCYFKTrH_kDA,1,0,4,JnZ6SbcIZNT717EnE_662Q

My cousin and her hubby are from Vegas and said they hadn't been there in years, but remembered they had good prime rib.  Since time was an issue (son and I had tix for Absinthe, make sure you check out my review) and the Gold Coast was right across the street from Palms Place, we said it sounded good.  Indeed, it had been years, as apparently the Cortez Room had moved to the other side of the casino since they had last been there.  

The other 3 with me ordered the queen cut prime rib with son and cousin's husband adding the crab legs.  I got the chicken oscar.  The queen cut was supposedly a 10 oz serving.  Well, the kitchen must have been feeling quite generous, as they received easily 16 to 18 oz portions.  They all raved about the prime rib, with the horseradish being a real highlight.  However, the crabs were watery and not very fresh.  My chicken oscar was above average and also a generous portion.

In summary, you can probably get prime rib for less in Vegas, but you may compromise quality and portion.  So I would have to say if you are close to the Gold Coast and want to have a nice meal, give the Cortez Room a shot.",OSclLOcMhf2QrktIAL9O7Q,1,0,3,RKmHU8EWpmlprcnRvRvdsg

It was fantastic with a merlot that was recommended to us by the waiter. For dessert, they had a cheesecake dish that tasted like it was homemade. The service was impeccable here and I could see why the locals come to this place a lot.

Next came a huge bread basket of piping hot bread and three different butters.  I liked the pesto one the best.  Also a tomato/garlic dipping sauce that was really good also.
We ordered the filet 6 oz with baked potato.  It was delicious!  I had a salad and hubby had the steak and potato soup which was glorious.  Most places will charge you for sides or soup and salad.

Okay well let's make this easy and start with my favorite thing about the place, the bread. LOL it's sad how serious I am. When bringing out the water, they bring out an assortment of bread and thin crisps along with this pico de gallo sort of concoction of tomatoes, along with a side of butter. I usually hate tomatoes but that side dish was DELISH. We literally asked our server to bring more at least 4 times. 

For an appetizer, we ordered crab cakes, which pretty much tasted like something you can find in the frozen food section of Costco. We also opted for the soup of the day which was an asparagus cream. Again, you could probably find it at Costco. Salads were typical, nothing to rave about, then again it was just a Caesar so there's not a lot you can mess up there. 

As the main course, my parents went with the steak...very fatty but still good. I decided to be healthy and go with a fish dish. It was mediocre, that's all I could remember from it. 

I say, go with the shrimp scampi, my dad has brought it home before and it was okay, very cheesy and greasy though. It's not the food that has lead me to decrease my rating, it's the service. First of all, every table is given two servers, one being the main one who takes your order and serves you courses, and the other acts as their assistant, constantly making sure your glass is full or if you need any extra items. With this type of service, you would expect it to be a high class restaurant with AMAZING service, you're given two afterall! Our main server would walk by our table yelling out the status of our food, as he walked to the back or to another table. He did it several times, after the 3rd or 4th we realized he was actually talking to us. The assistant was great, we honestly wanted to sneak him the whole tip but felt like he might get some trouble from his buddy, so we decided to be fair. 

As far as the overall ambiance of this 'steak house', it felt like a Golden Corral.

2 orders of prime rib( we ordered the 10oz queen)
a side of order of spinach
1 bowl of soup
2 glasses of tea total was like $40.00 and some change.
The meal comes with soup or salad and a choice of potato and tons of bread.

We had reservations for 5:30--not needed as it turned out--but there were more people there than I had expected.  We were quickly seated, brought menus, and our drink order was delivered.  We then ordered and the server split the order into two checks as we requested.

My wife ordered the Chicken Cortez and Jack and I each ordered prime rib.  Each dinner comes with soup or salad and choice of starch.  I got potato leek and a baked potato.  I asked for my prime rib to be blue and the server said very rare to which I nodded.  We also ordered a side of scalloped corn with prosciutto to share.

Bread was brought to the table along with two plates of pastry piped butter.  There didn't appear to be any difference in taste among the three.  The lavash was not as flavorful as some I've had and the pretzel roll was somewhat dry.  It seemed like the bread was a little on the old side.

The soup was good.  One of the bus people came to grind fresh pepper which was a bonus.  There was a good separation between courses so we could chat and catch up with what our friend had been up to since we saw him a few months before.

Our mains arrived.  The prime rib was red as I wanted and Jack's was a medium rare which was what he ordered.  Andrea's chicken was, well chicken with cheese melted on top and some avocado.  My baked potato was large but needed a bit more baking time.  I got the normal accoutrements--butter and sour cream and the waiter left extra horseradish if we wanted to charge up the creamy horseradish served with the prime rib.  All three of us liked our meals.  The scalloped corn was very good.  Creamed corn with lots of cheese baked until the light bread crumb top was browned.

For dessert, I got carrot cake which was quite good.

The Cortez Room is OK.   Service was OK if not a bit nonchalant.  The price was good because the casino had mailed a BOGO to my wife and we used points to pay the balance.

The place appears to have undergone some updates in the decor.  The overall effect is still that of an 80 year old's summer house, but hey, you are at the Gold Coast!  

There are two negatives: It's in the Gold Coast and the lack of ambiance.  However, there are many positives: 6 people + drinks + wine + prime rib + filets = $197 (what a deal).

The first time i came here was before they relocated to their newly remodeled location. The service was so terrible that I didn't return for over 4 years. 
When i did return after about 4 years the food was..... decent. It wasn't fantastic, you're only paying $14 for a 10oz prime rib so I guess you get what you pay for. They try to have a fine dining environment with dimmed lighting and serving your food off carts and stuffing your potato in front of you.
I've visited the newly located and remodeled Cortez room twice now and both times the service was not terrible, the people were very friendly, but it was VERY VERY SLOW. Expect to be waiting, and waiting. 
Something i don't like about this place is if you're using a credit card, they make you fill out the receipt first.. tip and all and sign it before they swipe your card. I don't like that at all. I think it slows the process down [with the already slow service] and I like to keep my tips a mystery until I leave. 
It'd rather have prime rib from the Red Rock Casino cafe than this place. Cheap and Good.
The waiters suck. The bussers are awesome.
Overall the food is pretty acceptable for the price, but the service continues to be poor over the years [5/7 visits were poor service] Expect a long meal time. Make reservations on weekends.",hkHkvgNklP236_fs4d9iCQ,0,0,2,FavcFYcwGbw_ouQP-In1RQ

We walked in on a Sunday with no reservation and had no problem getting a table. It was busier than I expected for  Sunday. Oddly we were seated, and then had to be moved to another table for some reason. 

Prices are good for a Vegas steakhouse. Meals come with soup or salad. We both had prime ribs with baked potatoes, one potato soup and one salad, and two glasses of wine. We were out for under $90 with tip. 

The steaks are grilled over open flame and they do have a strong char-broiled flavor to them. I like it, but it could be too strong for some. Steaks were cooked just as we asked, medium rare. Baked potatoes are good size and come with what ever garnish you want. Salad was fresh and firm, potato soup was creamy and tasty. It's easy to fill up on bread, salad and soup before your steak. 

Overall a great option over the more expensive (and apparently not any better) steak house next door at the Rio. I'd go back again.",gcMmEpmuUY6mLPHl-6Ct7Q,2,0,4,Up5ZmizbEtXV3ITtDXJpew

Setting: A bit old school, but well kept and elegant. Hostess pulled table out so that we could slide in easily (something that I only remember having done for us at Morton's). When we realized that we had been seated directly next to one of those big-mouth let everyone in the restaurant hear all of you stories type of people, we asked to be moved - and were w/o any challenges or issues to a much nice, and quieter table.

Service: Warm, friendly, and attentive - without being invasive. Our waiter and his team made sure we were happy, our water glasses never saw empty. I asked for a creamed horseradish - and they brought me a little bowl of sour cream and a second bow of straight horseradish - so that I could brew my own blend! Being that it was my wife's b-day, they brought an excellent ice cream sundae (no charge) and actually sang to her (in tune, I might add) using her NAME. Nice touch.

Food: We both had the ribeye steak ($22 w/ salad and huge baked potato). I have had better ribeyes, but not by much and certainly not at that price (think Ruth's Criss). It was cooked just right, nice sear, lots of juice and had a nice degree of tenderness. The dinner salad had lots of nice crunchy veggies in it -- and the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. The dressing was chunky with cheese, but not TART like most - it was quite mild and had a delightful flavor. The potatoes were well cooked with a nice degree of tenderness

All in all, I'd go there again without a doubt. Our bill for the two of us, prior to tip was under $50 (didn't do any alcohol). I've paid twice or more - for less.",F11XB5EZXBhhEu-4mh4nNg,1,0,4,A1nyIXFEWXQo7cBduAWd0g

The service was terrible and took forever to take orders from drinks to appetizers to main course. At the recommendation of the waiter I and the president of the company ordered Bone in ribeye steaks
It took about 1 hour for the dinner to serve and the restaurant had 4 tables total. All dinners came in except the one for the president. The waiter said that it will be couple of minutes so everyone waited.10 minutes later and no food for him so I told all to start eating. During that time with his back to us and chatting with another server the waiter never bothered
I called him since we are half way and the plate is not served so he came back with excuses and the he said that that he forgot to order it and not sincere apology. At that time the president told him to forget it. He went to a manager and came back saying the this meal will be free candy after we finished dinner the ribeye came as it was defrosted in the microwave full of vain and cannot be cut so it was left alone
At no time a manager came to explain or apologize. My steak was not any better. All across it was embarrassing dinner that made me look bad and forced to pay 18% gratuities for such bad food and server

OK, it didn't get five stars THE FIRST TIME because my drink seemed weak (I had to get a double), but my drink was very stiff the second time, so it's back up to 5.

+  It was the best 6 oz. filet mignon I've ever had, on par with RuthChris, and better than my steak at Morton's (Las Vegas).  Perfectly cooked, juicy, and not a sliver of fat, with salt, pepper, and garlic butter.  I order the 9 oz. the second time and it was just as perfect.  

+  Though the overwhelming gold and yellow theme reminded me of Trump's grandma's apartment, the place was open but cozy, peaceful and nicely dark. It felt like eating in a Tequila Sunrise. 

+  The salad may have been basic and small, but well-presented and good.

+  Good service.  Huge bar.  

+  The wife's garlic roasted chicken!  Oh my god.  My wife peeled off the skin and I devoured the crackly goodness.  Juicy without being slimy, with the texture of turkey.  Brussel sprouts, baked potato, and mashed potatoes also great.  

+  Cute little mini-me skillet with rolls to start.

+  The tiramisu. We had it for Easter, but it's not on the menu. Ask for it.  If they don't have it yet, just roll your eyes, or shake your head, or knock a roll onto the ground.

so We came here to meet our family friends who are from Nevada and love this place.  When I heard we were going out for steak I got all excited.  I thought ooooh nice place I can yelp later!! then We drive down Las Vegas Blvd..pass all the hotels goodbye venetian, farewell ceasers, so long bellagio...,TURN ON FLAMINGO hasta la luego rio...hello........GOLD...COAST?!?!?!  interesting....

so we walk in valet tells us the Cortez Room is all the way in the back and as I walk in it reminded me of downtown lv.  I was still excited though because I thought this place MUST be awesome for locals to love it and want to come in here for their prime rib!  

We meet the rest of our group and we have water and veggies on the table.  Eventually bread arrives.  Then our server comes by 15minutes later.  one of the men at our table is irritated by his tardiness and comments that we are hungry so we order asap.  We ordered a variety of MEATS from prime rib, filet mignon, porterhouse, ny, etcetc.  We all also got a salad to start.  When they roll the salad out I realize its a little weird how they have the salad on the top shelf of the plastic cart, forks in the middle, and dressing on the bottom.  The dressing is served to share with whomever ordered the same one as you.  The server ended up pouring some dressing on a jacket at our table.  He didn't really jump to apologize or help but offered to get the manager or something.  The lady went to wash out the jacket and the manager came by.  He asked while the server wasnt there if we would like security to come to file a report. WTF?? for spilled dressing??? just apologize weirdo.  He eventually said one of our bottles of wine would be on the house... thanks? what about our other 2 hehehe...no? fine...

  Then he had this loooong talk with the waiter next to out table and I started to feel a little bad I mean it was a genuine accident I think it was just the way everything was handled.  He then came by and offered to put the womans meal on his tab but we denied his offer that would soooo not have been right.  The night progressed we were all warm and happy from the wine and our steaks were rolled out and served to us.  My prime rib looked yummy and with chunky and creamy horseradish (wtheck the chunky was SO strong!!) and the side of sweetpotato I couldnt wait for it!!  However to my verrrrrrrrrrry strong disappointment the cow was cold. I mean my meat wasnt just warm it was prettttttttty cold. not RAW cold but cold for meat that was supposed to be cooked right then and there.  What a disappointment and yes i am a beeyotch when it comes to stuff like this but, come on! the waiter had sooo much to deal with tonight already so I just sucked it up and ate my food like a big girl.  

The food was still yummy and after all the meat plus icecream and coffee everyone at the table was pleasantly stuffed. 

Not worth the drive away from the strip.  I am sure in a city with such amazing chefs we could have enjoyed this meal for the same cost anywhere else!!",KavG2RBt77vRLqG1_6RBvQ,2,4,2,xLV2zaGr8m1QhhX2sc8WLg

I shared the Porterhouse with my wife, I think other orders were ribeye & prime rib.

The entrees come with either a salad or soup and a baked potato, sweet potato or mash.

The salad looked like something you could pour out of prepackaged salad from the grocery store. We asked for ranch on the side, but got blue cheese instead.

Our entrees seemed to take a long time to arrive (we were the second table sat in the restaurant as it opened).

The Porterhouse didn't look anything like the 22oz it was quoted as on the menu - if I had a scale with me I would have weighed it! - it was cold and most shockingly of all it had absolutely no seasoning on it, at all, nothing.

The sweet potato was cooked to almost a ""mush/baby food"" consistency.

We were eating with friends (who had suggested we go here) and so I didn't want to make a scene and send the food back - but if we had been there in a smaller group I would for sure have sent the food back, it really just wasn't good at all.

It was not a gourmet, elegant type of experience but it was welcoming, satisfying and relaxing. My waitress, Patricia, was so sweet. In fact, all of the staff were, including Patricia's assistant, Hiwot (forgive me for the spelling if it is wrong). 3 kinds of bread were served: I think it was sourdough, a cracker bread, and a scrumptious pretzel bread with 3 kinds of whipped butter. I started with a lovely glass of Cabernet and Oysters Rockefeller. The oysters were prepared with a generous amount of spinach (the way I like them), bread crumbs, cheese, and bernaise. Superb, a meal in themselves. I then chose the King Crab legs. The meal came with a salad which was mostly iceberg but had a nice mix of greens and arugula. It was really good. (Iceberg is all the rage, you know, now that it's been elevated with the wedge). Dressing was home-made and packed full with blue-cheese. Choice of potatoe included as well. Now you can't go wrong with crab, but what I so appreciated about the crab here was they split the legs in half so the meat was easily accessible. It was a simply delicious, unpainful and clean process. All I had to do was dip it in clarified butter. 2 pounds for $58 (market price) and the oysters were $12. More spendy than the Buffet but, hey its also about getting served, right? And you can't take buffet home. I had plenty of leftovers for my morning breakfast.
