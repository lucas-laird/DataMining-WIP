Swordfish was a very thin cut and the salmon was a thicker than usual cut...I'm thinking they threw it on the grill and didn't adjust times for thickness of the cuts.  

They need to work on consistency.",Bhg3OZxwkiwz7DB2DjwRoQ,1,0,4,x05DhOYRo245Yd5VjwtpnQ

LOCATION
Good location on the corner of a strip mall in between Target and Chase Bank.

DECOR
The decor is clean and the interior is bright and airy with organic colors that give off a relaxed and refreshing feeling.  Perfect if you're looking for a quick, healthy and informal dining experience.

SERVICE
Friendly and caring.  The waitresses were welcoming and efficient while the owners were engaging and helpful in answering questions about the menu.

FOOD
I ordered the Baja Salad with Salmon, Grilled Chicken Tacos, and English Clam Chowder.  The Salad was amazing as the portions were generous and ingredients were fresh!  The Salmon that came with the Salad was from Loch Duart in Scotland (I noticed this on the menu) which is a high quality brand that complemented the Salad well.  The Tacos were tasty as the chicken was tender and moist with a slight char which added to the flavor.  The clam chowder had a good consistency (not too thick or watery) and came in a bread bowl.

OVERALL
The food tasted great, the portions were satisfying (I couldn't finish everything and still had food left over on my plate), the plating (food presentation) was pleasing to the eye, and the prices were reasonable for the quality/quantity.  I am looking forward to returning and trying the other menu items as there is good variety to the selections that should satisfy all appetites!",UKSurmj1snomv_EqebOzPA,1,0,5,qC1uTD6TETex0teXt-2StQ

As us Las Vegan's know, it's very hard to find a healthy place to go eat at that's also delicious. Finally there is a fish grill here in town and not only is something that Las Vegas has needed. The service, food, presentation, ambiance, is all top notch. I eat here 5 days a week and eating here has helped me get my healthy lifestyle back on track.

Friendly staff that introduces you the menu if its your first time :] little +1 for that so you dont stand there clueless =X 

Chopped Ahi Tuna Appetizer - piled in the middle with a ring, surrounded by some crispy chips, its a nice appetizer to try. Tuna was fresh and tender. No chewy bits. Chips were nice and crispy. Great to eat the tuna on top of the chip. 

Salmon Tacos - Two soft tortilla tacos with sour cream, guacamole, and a sauce (tomatillo? green tomato?) on the side. Salmon was a bit dry, more on the cooked side. My preference on cooking salmon at home, would a crisp sear on the outside, and the inside is still borderline raw. Keeps it nice and tender and moist. Overall, the taco was delicious. Will try a different fish next time ! 

Orange Roughy Fish Plate - BEST of the 3. ok a little side story. prior to this, my friend and I had seen Orange Roughy at a restaurant we ate at before. Didn't know what it was but had google'd it up and what not. Since then, we've been seeing it everywhere. Finally got to try it. Had ordered the fish plate with a side of sweet potato fries, comes with a cole slaw, and we were given two different sauces (indecisive and the one who took our order said she'll give us both to try). The sauces were a mango salsa and a garlic butter. The fish was nicely grilled. The texture of the fish was tender but not flaky like salmon. its more... stringy? iunoe how to describe that. medium texture, not soft like bass but not firm like salmon or tuna when fully cooked. The garlic butter is, like garlic butter. Very butter, with a hint, not too strong garlic flavor. The mango salsa, OMG you can give me a bowl of that, i can eat straight up or with chips or something. So bright and refreshing. Paired on top of the fish. SUPER WIN ! Squirt some lemon juice on top, and take a bite. its like a symphony of flavors. 

Will come back to try other fishes as well. Been recommended the fried cod tacos. Next time ! :D",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,0,4,NhQac7O4VucgBvhxAS4CsA

We wanted to try a few things and probably ate more than we should have but it was worth it. Here's what we got and our assessment of them:

Crab cake 4/5

Clam chowder 3/5 (it was just ok...)
Baja salad w/ grilled shrimp 5/5

Very clean, friendly service, great decor, reasonable prices, great menu, lots of seating, and parking spots.  The fresh cajun seared Ahi is delicious.  They gave me a trio of sauces to sample with my fish because I couldn't decide which one I wanted.  IMO the mango sauce and the garlic butter are wonderful choices for your fish.  They also serve China Mist Iced Tea and Fiji bottled water which is a huge plus for me.  The cole slaw is one of the best in town. I dined in and got a few things  to-go both times.  The to-go packaging is neat and the food still tasted superb.  The chowder in the bread bowl is great.  The Kale Salad with the strawberry dressing is also a must try.

I'd like to mention that they have 2 T.V's on the wall if that is something that's important to you.  I know a lot of gamblers in Vegas like to watch sporting events or at least see scores. Thumbs up for a sparkling fresh ladies room.  Check out their Facebook page and spread the word.

I've been there 4 times in one week, that's how good it is! So far I've had the fish tacos, fried catfish, seared ahi, and the crabcake sandwich which is by far my favorite thing on the menu. Just a heads up, they sell out fast. Everything there is made fresh to order and the sides are just as great as the main dishes. I highly recommend the kale salad. Funny thing, the only reason I had it was because they messed up my order and gave me the salad instead. I'm not one to be a picky eater and mistakes happen, so I kept the salad. Best decision I've ever made. From then on, I always get the kale salad. If you get any of the fish plates you have different options of how it's prepared; blackened, grilled, seared, and fried. I'm not a big fan of fried food anymore, but how they fry their fish doesn't have that greasy taste to it and tastes really clean, which I love. The best part of this place is the price. So fresh fish and other seafood options, this place is so cheap and the portions are just right. I found a new favorite lunch spot.",ro8lGoWMsa49B3tWLaWwSA,1,1,5,fDoglRFC4tYpjZFfMrMuUw

2720010,2014-01-02,3,e3P9dVUNlTuhlnFOZH3vAw,"Me and the wifey were craving fish so a search on Yelp lead us here. Seeing that some of my trusted Yelp buddies have already done a review on this place, I would say the decision to come here was a good one. With that said, I just found it ok. I may not agree with the reviews, but I respect their opinions.

First off, the prices here are a bit lower than what you would find at a higher end seafood place so that's a good start. Their menu options are pretty simple to understand. I opted for the Tilapia Cajun style. Comes with Cole Slaw and one side so I opted for Kale Salad. Im not into Cole Slaw so I substituted it for Grilled Veggies, which was a dollar more. My wife went with the Seared Ahi Cajun style with Kale Salad and substituted Brown Rice for yet another dollar more. 

The Tilapia was decent. It was nice and flaky but I thought it could of used more seasoning. Since I had it Cajun style, I was expecting a bit of a kick to it, which I found none of. The grilled veggies were really good. You got sliced carrots and red bell peppers cooked just right with that little bit of crispiness to it. My wife's Seared Ahi was just ok. Again, hardly any of the Cajun flavor was evident. The Brown Rice was just ok.

Notice I didn't mention the Kale Salad. It's because that salad is worthy of it's own paragraph! Now I have never been much of salad eater and when I do, kale is definitely not my first choice but after experiencing it here I was hooked! Their Kale Salad by itself is worthy of a 5 star rating. From what I recall, it had sliced strawberries, almonds and carrots. As for the dressing, it had a strawberry infused poppy seed vinaigrette type of taste to it. I kid you not if this was all I had for lunch or dinner I would be satisfied! So whatever you get here, make sure the Kale Salad is a part of it or your trip is going to be a waste!

Because of the tasty Kale Salad, that is what prevented me from giving this place 2 stars instead of 3. Why you ask? Well I am spoiled by my favorite fish place called California Fish Grill that has several locations in Southern California. Memo to the owner: Check these guys out and you will know what you are dealing with. Their prices are a bit cheaper, the portions are a bit more, and when you get the Cajun style flavor, you actually get the spicy kick you are looking for. You also get different salsas you can put on your fish at no additional charge. 

So overall, I still need to find a place that is comparable to my favorite place in California. But for awesome Kale Salad, this is my go to place.

2778528,2014-03-07,1,e3P9dVUNlTuhlnFOZH3vAw,"I'm a fan of fast-casual restaurants that offer healthy and fresh options. I don't always have time to cook at home and I don't have the deep pockets to constantly eat at higher end spots. So, there's plenty to like here. They specialize in fish cooked to order with your choice of seasoning or sauce and a side. Soups, sandwiches, salads, and tacos are on the menu as well. And, the place is kid friendly. They've got a few options for the rugrats, too. 

The downside, at least from my singular experience, was that I could smell the fish coming to my table. It wasn't awful, but it was certainly the smell of a not-so-fresh fish. It was still edible and I liked the mango salsa on top of my orange roughy ($12) and had no qualms with the brown rice. But the fish itself could have been better. Obviously, at these prices you can't expect fish to be flown in daily. You'd have to go to Bartolotta or other high-end Strip restaurant for that.

The kid's chicken tenders ($5) appeared to be house-made, so they should get some credit for that. Unfortunately, it was too bland, even for my kid. 

Conceptually, this place is great. But their execution and quality of product might be in question.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,1,2,J4Lt7lwWc23FKwr1-jan-A

Decided to try this place out because my co-worker raved about this place. Plus it was just down the street from my job. The whole restaurant is quite adorable. Two of the walls are glass walls so it added a really cool effect to the place, lighting up the whole room up. 

The menu is pretty condensed but I kinda like that. Also everything is a pretty decent price. I asked the hostess for her opinion on what was popular and she was really helpful. I ordered fried fish tacos ($6) & wanted a side of kale salad because of all the positive buzz it gets! I just substituted the beans w/ kale salad which was $1 extra. 

I ordered my food at 12:00 & did not get my food until about 12:30. And, it was not even busy. So I suggest you order your food before you arrive. I honesty think 30 minutes for 2 fish tacos is a little too long. A few of the costumers were also complaining of the wait. 

Now the food. The fish tacos were pretty good. Honestly nothing special about them but nonetheless they were good! The kale salad-- sorry, But I honestly did not like it. I was so excited to try it from all the buzz it got! I thought it was dry and it had a odd after taste. But maybe I'm just not a kale fan lol.

I have been here 3 times with some co workers literally once a week for the last month. Every time i have had the opportunity to be served by nice and funny women working up front.  They definitely did a good job hiring these ladies!

On to the food... what can i say  it is AMAZING!

First time i had the Tilapia plate , brown rice and veggies ( substituting the coleslaw is 1$ more ) with Garlic Butter Sauce.   It was excellent, lots of flavor.  Had a nice char on the fish edges. Sauce was to die for.   For the most part a very healthy plate of food.   For 11 dollars + tax... Holy Crap!  CHEAP!

Next time was the same as above except i added the New England Chowder.. a little watery than i enjoy , but had very good flavor.  Will definitely repeat.   Oh its served in a buttery bread bowl  YUM!  

This last time ( Less than an hour ago ) i ordered the Salmon with the same Garlic Butter sauce and veggies..........  O M G.  Probably one of the biggest peices of salmon i have ever been served at a restaurant and the flavor was excellent.  Some salmon has a slight fish taste to it .. this one did not.    15$ +tax WOW! CHEAP!

I entirely recommend Manhattan Fish Grill and hope that they continue to be spot on with there dishes day in and day out...   There consistency is a major selling factor for me to continue to dine there. 

Keep up the good work guys!",-B731Wh1510uXX9eC1orQQ,8,2,5,QOXuAegrFPnn6A4ig7nnww

She was very helpful and friendly. She provided me with suggestions from the menu and had no problem describing the dishes. We ordered crab cakes, crunchy fish tacos, orange roughy, grilled zucchini and lava cake. The crab cakes we baked perfect with a nice crunchy outside and the sauce was fantastic with a nice tangy spice. The grilled zucchini was excellent. Not over grilled. When I took my first bite the juices exploded in my mouth.  Every bite after with the same experience, I felt like I was in zucchini bliss. The crunchy fish taco is to die for. There is a nice citrus flavor that was totally unexpected. The thickness of the shredded cheese was a great twist. The pico was homemade and fresh. The orange roughy was was cooked to perfection. The chef did an amazing job. The grill marks were great. It did not break into peices when I cut it and it did not have a bitter fishy taste. The garkic buttet cream sauce on the top took it over the top. Great job on this ocean fish masterpiece.  The lava cake was nice not too sweet but had a nice flavor of strawberries that occopany this wonderful desert. My advice is jump all over the orange roughy. When we left they thanked us for coming in and sent us off with a warm farewell.",lsl_Le9iVqmt17IcRPEzGA,1,1,5,zGD-x8Cbdbj7hHo4NDor4w

Manhattan fish grill caught our eye with their swanky modern interior. We decided to give it a go for lunch. 

The food was great. Everyone was pleased. I had a grilled fish plate with orange roughy topped with mango salsa and kale salad. It tasted fresh and flavorful. The kale salad was excellent. They have lots if tasty sounding sides to choose from. I sampled the New England clam chowder as well. It was good but overly salty.

My girlfriend loved the grilled orange roughy.   I was impressed with how white the catfish was (my father would approve!) As well as how fresh it tasted.  Good catfish is hard to find.

The salmon was cooked to my liking and the garlic butter was to die for. The rice pilaf and mixed veggies complimented the dish well too. 

I will definitely be returning to order the salmon again and to try the clam chowder served in a bread bowl. :)",XNvmkt1nNWO9ZxoHuYyugA,4,0,5,j5hoIipDy_hJsEIywdUalw
4491035,2014-01-09,2,e3P9dVUNlTuhlnFOZH3vAw,"Manhattan Fish Grill offers a healthier option to fast food. It doesn't taste like fast food though.  They take great care in preparing their meals.

I had their crab cake sandwich . It was tasty and was nicely held together. This is important because in many places ordering a crab cake sandwich means a crumbling mess! It came with a side of crispy fries. The sides are not gigantic but it is just enough not to make you feel guilty about what you ate.

Speaking of guilt I also tried their brownie . It was bigger and fluffier than most. It didn't feel heavy or greasey. 

The second visit I had their Kale salad. You can add fish, chicken or shrimp for a small fee. It is a big portion and I  loved the berry mix that was in the salad.

If you eat in during the winter months it is best to come bundled up because whenever the door opens it can get chilly!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,3,4,_m4vfwaFKXzNQpTw_K57zQ

4842568,2013-11-11,0,e3P9dVUNlTuhlnFOZH3vAw,"Perfectly cooked fish, fresh cut fries, delicious salads, and vegan brownies. What's not to love about this place?

The prices are very reasonable and the food is awesome. 

Choose a sandwich, salad, tacos or plate. Choose from a respectable selection of fish and sides.

You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The dining area and tables are spotless.

We got both sweet potato and regular french fries. Both were so good it's hard to say which I prefer, but I think the french fries win out by a narrow margin.

Sweet Potato Fries 5/5
Fresh cut, well seasoned and perfectly crispy. These are excellent.

French Fries 5/5
These are also fresh cut and perfectly crispy. They seem to have a bit of citrus in the seasoning which tasted amazing, especially when paired with fish. Highly recommended. 

Kale Salad with Mahi 5/5
Raw kale can be heavy. They add just enough shredded cabbage, fresh apple and romaine to make this salad light and crispy. It comes with fresh strawberries and dried cranberries,  tossed in a strawberry vinegrette.  You can choose from several fish options with the salads. I tried the Mahi  and it was cooked perfectly, very tender and juicy.

Crispy Fish Sandwich 4/5
The fried cod was crispy and delicious. Together with the bun it was a bit dry. This sandwich could use some fruit salsa or sambal of some kind, but not bad.

Vegan Brownie 4/5
Tasty and impressive for being vegan, but not overwhelming in any way.

I'll definitely be coming back to this spot when I want some fresh and well prepared fish that's easy on the wallet. Very happy to have found it, thanks yelp!",5rL-YgU3CXHbQA3Txzdd9g,6,0,5,pfAXW-CKykBCahfphQJfrw

The Catfish was good, but the fish tacos were cold (are they supposed to be?).  I don't send food back ( we all know why).  The fish tacos were not great anyway.  Ambiance was inviting.  The waitress was pleasant, although didn't seem to know anything about the owners, business, etc.  Unfortunately this is just another fish place that can't seem to get it right in the desert.

5529174,2013-12-20,12,e3P9dVUNlTuhlnFOZH3vAw,"The top two things to like here are the quality and price.  There is definitely some bang for your buck to be had.  Well known spots like McCormick and Schmick's would feature these entrees at much more than these guys charge.  They also offer a discount for LVAC members.  

We started with the ""New England Clam Chowder"" which was served in a bread bowl with plenty of oyster crackers for some elegant carb on carb action.  The soup was delicious and the clams were plentiful.  This was a steal for $4.50.

I got the ""Seared Ahi Tuna"" plate which came with a side and cole slaw.  You can see from all the pictures that you get A LOT of tuna for $15.  The tuna was seasoned in Cajun spice and it was terrific.   I paid $1 extra to get another side and opted for the quinoa and kale salad.  The kale salad was great and the mix of strawberries, almonds, carrots, jicama, cranberries and more made me feel like a walking antioxidant afterwards.  I will most likely just order the tuna and kale salad combo next time which is a couple of bucks less but you get the same size tuna and more salad.  

My wife got the salmon with garlic butter sauce.  That sauce was so good that we asked for an extra side of it.  It had the consistency of tartar sauce and was a welcome change.  The salmon was grilled well although the pieces were not as big as the tuna.  

It's definitely a casual atmosphere since you're ordering from the cash register. I imagine they get a lot of take out orders for lunch.  This is another solid choice for lunch if you're leaning towards the healthy side of things....or not since the fried catfish in their pics looks amazing too.  The only thing I felt was missing from dinner was some wine.  Not sure if they plan on serving it in the future.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,29,21,4,3-LAKL9lvvjlHLvTq_hA5w

We also tried the calamari which was not the best calamari I have had but I enjoyed the light coating and the dipping sauce was excellent.

The others enjoyed their meals too and the 5 of us ate for less than 80 dollars.

Aside from the tacos they've got a bunch of other stuff as well as fish plates, claw chowder, and so forth. 

I've had these types of seafood restaurants in Cali but I think this is the first time I've discovered one in Vegas worth trying out. :0) So far, I'm a fan!

Interior looks quite nice. The cashiers also will periodically check up on you so that was nice. It's solid for me as of my second visit :0).",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,1,4,4sir2_O45yfPuMLoYdTKcw

I went in and ordered the tilapia with mango salsa and grilled veggies. After 20 minutes of waiting my food finally came out. The mango salsa was more of a hot purée of something yellow but it didn't tastes like mango at all! When the waitress came over to ask how my food was simply asked if they had changed their salsa or chef and she said yeah we have a new chef and he's not that great.  She gave me a refund and that was that. Apparently this had been happening a lot.
