52697,2014-10-30,0,SuugmVDsQ8YhfdOJYSuSmw,"We came to this Outback to have a bit of normal among the myriad of new foods we had in Vegas. We love Outback at home and so we thought we would go get food we know we love. This location doesn't have the same menu as others. We love the chicken artichoke flat bread and couldn't get it here. Not enough room to store all of the ingredients? Ok. I can understand that. Vegas is compact and I don't know what else they use artichokes for. 

However, what I don't understand is being told that they aren't offering the current Outback promo of Steak and Lobster for $14.99 but we can get a steak and add a lobster tail for a total of $35 instead. AND being told that other locations in Vegas and on the strip do offer the promotion doesn't help. So I'm not sure if this location is just cheap or what.

Our waiter also had a bit of an attitude when we expressed our disappointment by the lack of our favorite offerings. He took about 20 mins to bring out our bread and we only saw him a few times during the meal. He was much happier serving other guests.

On the plus side, the steak was excellent quality (which the waiter made sure we acknowledged) and I was ""forced"" to try a new side (Aussie Fries) that I did end up liking and may order again. I also very much enjoyed the baked potato soup.",i4P5n_c58VwuGE_iD17y7w,0,0,3,y2-TbcrOYbO6cThvT-CEWQ

1- Server acts as if the customers are there only for her not the other way.
2- 25 minutes sitting with drinks on the table, then comes the blooming onion and salad, blooming onion barely warm and under cooked.
3- She acts like she is doing me a favor bringing the bread about 2 minutes before the burger arrived. I declined the bread stating clearly that there is no sense of having the bread 30 minutes after sitting down, her answer was ""OK"".
4- Burger barely warm as well, 
I have to mention, this was at lunch time on a slow Friday.
I have to check another location before I say goodbye OB. So far, 2 locations in Las Vegas suck.

For the uninitiated -- the only entry is by a glass capsule elevator on the bottom of the 'Coke' bottle symbol (which is a sign for the said bottling company's museum and merchandise outlet on the strip). This is right next to the M&M museum as well. Once you get in -- you are assured quick seating and a cheerful enthusiastic staff swiftly catering to your cravings. The decor is nice  enough and you can look down from the fourth floor perch (if you choose window seating) to observe humanity float by and get accosted by canvassers.

We ordered a Steak as well as a 'Mushroom and Swiss burger'. Beef in both were juicy. The complementary black bread was fresh and tasty. Our servers were super nice and friendly but non-intrusive. We did not feel hurried although this place was on the strip itself.

Overall: Salty. (Probably even more salty than Olive Garden, which is quite a feat.)

Free bread - Best part of the meal!  Soooo good.  It's some sort of dark brown bread that's super soft and has a light honey flavor to it.  I should have just eaten three baskets of that and saved us some cash.

Baby back ribs - Came with virtually no sauce.  Dry and salty were the only two words that could possibly describe this horrible dish.  The fries that came with it were soft and mushy.  Ewww.

Ceasar salad - Salty. The croutons and the chicken were good, but a salty salad is still a salty salad.  Another reminder to always order dressing on the side at restaurants.

Coconut shrimp - Don't know if all coconut shrimp is like this, but I didn't like the coconut shreds.  They were too tough and didn't add any flavor.

Shrimp on the Barbie - Only decent dish that night, and I only say that because it wasn't too salty.",8vIK6ndl8yzIdmSDnGp0tw,0,0,1,AZOKaLfVWRdhYEoLNULaig

I had the burger topped with their 'bloomin onions' and fries as a side dish.
My friend had the ribeye and baked potato and a side salad.
Our food came at a reasonable time.
I noticed that both our dishes were inordinately shiny (translate to - greasy!) but I didnt think much of it. I didnt finish my burger (ate about a 3rd of it and boxed the rest) finished my fries and my friend polished off her plate.
Then we had coffee and key lime pie.
After dinner, we headed out to the mall to ""walk off"" all that grease we had consumed.
But as soon as I left the restaurant, I felt my mouth dry up. Thirty minutes after shopping, my friend wanted to go get a long cold drink of soda and so did I.
We were both so very very thirsty.
After much thought, we were thinking about what could have possibly triggered such voracious thirst in both of us.
Sodium.
That restaurant served our food laced with maximum doses of sodium. 
I realized, my body reacts to MSG, and that what happens to me - I get very thirsty and  a bit swollen. Sure enough~! 
I will never eat there again - ever! 
Dont bring your kids there although I saw very many families with young ones gobbling up the food.
They put too much sodium, cook with way too much grease.

The one we visited this evening was in Casino Royale and the place is quite depressing inside and is in need of an update,  there is however, a really cute guy who works there who always reminds me of Brandon Flowers so at least that is a bonus.

Prices are reasonable (especially compared to the equivalent in England) and service has always been good although there tends to be a mega wait if you get there after 7pm.

Prime rib- oh my... fatty, chewy, not tender but mushy. I opened the container and was immediately turned off. 

Lamb- biggest mistake of the year. Worst lamb I've ever had. The wine sauce was also clumpy. The whole thing was just a salty chewy mess. 

Burgers- these were probably the best items if the night, but who can screw up a burger? Got a bacon cheese and mushroom Swiss. I didn't taste them but I heard they were ok. 

Fries were mediocre, garlic mashed potatoes were just meh, the baked potato soup was par and the Caesar salad had more fake Parmesan cheese on it than lettuce. Overall my meal was way over salted and way under flavored.

We sat at a table at the bar, because there was no wait. Our server was friendly enough at first, but that changed as soon as he surmised we weren't the Whales he had hoped for. 

After he made his pitch on the top-line steak specials, my friend replied that we were actually big fans of their burgers. It was a nice comment, suggesting that he would have completely sold us on the steaks, if we had not already set our minds to the burgers instead. It was the kind of statement polite people use when they want to do something other than what you suggested. 

He just stared at us with this look of disgust and said ""I think the burgers here are crap."" In a mater of seconds, the waiter's demeanor turned completely in the other direction. All of a sudden, it was if he couldn't get away from our table fast enough. He coldly flew through our burger orders like he was auditioning for the role of Flo in Alice.

Some other guy actually delivered our food, but as he approached the table he proudly proclaimed ""Welcome to Burger King."" If we didn't now any better, we would have concluded he was auditioning for the same role. He literally 'dropped' our burgers, then turned and walked away. 

We dug into our burgers, still wondering if anyone was going to bring us some silverware and napkins - oh and some ketchup would be nice too. Not surprisingly, we had to stop yet another server to get the silverware and our ketchup got dropped off some time later. The ketchup hit the table with such force it almost spilled onto our fries for us.

My friend and I were so involved in our business discussion that night - it really should have taken no less than a naked cowgirl floatin' across the ceiling to get us to pay attention to anything else, but amazingly enough, the piss-poor service at this place got both of us dropping our jaws in disbelief.

I have never been to an Australian restaurant before and was looking forward to a unique Las Vegas dining experience. 

I don't know what I was expecting.  I thought that they might have Kangaroo & Crocodile steaks, but it turns out that Australian food is pretty much the same as American food, but it was still very exquisite. 

We started with some sort of Australian onion thing made with a seasoning & orange sauce that probably came from some Australian herb or vegetable.  Very exquisite! 
This was served with a brown bread & butter tray.  I've never seen this in America before and must be some type of traditional Australian delicacy bread.

For the main course I had some ribs that the menu said came from Down Under.  Likely from an expertly raised Australian hog.   It was exquisite.  My date had a cheeseburger.  She's just as not as adventurous an eater I guess and wasn't ready to try Australian cuisine.

We went in June 2015.  Waiter was a good enough guy, service was decent.

I ordered the cobb salad which listed ""mixed greens"" and I got iceberg lettuce.  Should've known better.  Probably the least exciting salad I've had in a long time.

While hotel rates are dropping,  food is not.  While I revel the number of choices The Strip offers, the spiraling economy always makes me think of the tourist trap.  I had an unfortunate experience in a not-named (but reviewed) Japanese restaurant earlier that week.  I was on a business trip while fellow colleagues visited rather posh restaurants.   With my family with me (and no, I did not expense their meals!) I demanded at least one nice dinner during trade show week.

I was in a mood for a decent steak place, anticipated paying a little more, but trying to keep the tab under $100 for three.  One of the complaints about this Outback is the $$$.   It's deserved.  But like me, it is a corporate franchise name in a convenient location, with many patrons not spending their own money.  Welcome to Las Vegas.  

Walking inside the Casino Royale and finding the somewhat secret elevator we found the creaky floor lobby of Outback.  There was a wait, but not terribly long.  We were given a table near the bar and I ordered a rare cocktail.  Our server offered a pleasant suggestion for an extra $1 for an extra shot of the dizzy juice.  After a long day stuffed in a (monkey) suit, its good advice.  With bread, we did resist ordering an appetizer.  Wanting to experiment, I went with the Prime grade fillet while the wife went with the Choice.  In a mood to splurge, I ordered a lobster tail.  

Prime versus Choice: The prime is more tender than choice but unsure if its that noticeable or worth the extra dollars.   

The Lobster Tail: That was incredibly good!  My daughter went to my side of the table to make it her meal.  And it didn't need any butter.

Desert: Giant brownie cake and ice cream on top.  Though there was no cake *under* the ice cream, a form of cheating, there was enough there for three.  

The Service: I was very pleased and relieved to be treated well.  Though a busy night, our server found the time to make sure we were okay and our water glasses not empty.

First off I want to say that I was not impressed by the service.  I don't want to believe it, but Im pretty sure our server (Marquise) forgot about us half the time we were there.  It took almost 15 minutes just to get water onto our table after sitting, and note that they didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink...We had to ask them ourselves. Apart from that, our server didn't check up on us, we were out of water majority of the time. Maybe it was because we were in a corner, but that is still no excuse. 

Our food took a long time to come out, there was a couple who sat maybe 20 minutes after us and they got their food before us... However I really did enjoy the food.

We are traveling business men and/or bachelors and I GTD you I eat out more then 95% of the people in your rest.  I HATE being treated like a third class citizen because I'm traveling solo on business. 

I used to also eat regularly at a popular BBQ REST. once the forced me to sit in the bar when I specifically requested not to.  I haven't been back to any of their rests since - now 3 yrs ago. 

It's simple. I requested NOT to be in the bar and you put me there because you think I'm stupid and didnt know the table your seater gave me was actually 'open bar seating'.  I won't be back.  There are WAY too many choices on Las Vegas to be treated like this.

We parked over at the City Center and walked over to the this location which in the 2 years I have been in Vegas I had never been here. Despite the group of people waiting when we got to the top of the elevator we walked in like we had an Aussie access pass or something. 

The whole experience was fast track, If I finished this review the way our meal went it would go something like this.

I know you think I exaggerating but it's true, I wrote it here on the Internet so you have to believe it. 

After our lightning fast seating and greeting and the quick stealth like drop of our bread the waiter is upon us. Welcome, what would like, how would you like it and could I get you anything else all things thrown out to us. After ordering our meals the salads hit the table, all fresh and crisp. The next part of the experience could be considered good and bad; before our salads were gone or even half gone the expo was standing next to our table preparing to put our amazing steaks in front of us. Now, for me i am not a fan of that but in this case it was okay because the inner carnivore in all of us at the table began to take over as the salads were pushed away and the knives were drawn. 

the steaks was amazing, no fat, perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection, the outback hit a home-run.  This place changed my outlook on the outback, the food lived up to the hype in this case.

The prices were ridiculous. I know it's the Strip, but it's also Outback. We could have eaten inside at a nice place for what we spent here. A soda is $4.50! WHAT??! 

My mother ordered the Ribeye. $39.00. The waiter said he advises we order the bone in because ""it tastes MUCH better"". The bone in was $10 more. My mother said not worth it. When the steak arrived it didn't look like a ribeye. After a few bites, my mother said it was definitely was New York strip.

Can count on getting your hang for buck. Large portions and reasonable pricing, especially when going with a large family. If you're not a steak fan they have plenty of alternatives that's also what I like as well.",00qRXEvBa-zDe3VywJAVFg,1,0,3,VXgaRyGVvB7-afE3xeWMSA

For diner sharred a lobster and filet mignon.   The filet was so tender you could cut with a fork.

5723659,2012-02-12,0,SuugmVDsQ8YhfdOJYSuSmw,"I admit, I love Outback normally. However, this one? SERIOUSLY disappointing.

This location is meant to be the busiest Outback in the world. I cannot even beging to believe this considering we went in on a weekend evening and were seated straight away (and there was a lot of empty tables).

So what was good about the experience. Oh, Nothing. 

Firstly because the location is on the strip the prices are suddenly increased. The steaks are much more expensive than in any other Outback we have ever been to. So instead hubby had pork chops and I had a burger. We started with the onion bloom.

No bread was given to us- guessing that because we decided not to have steak we werent seen to be worthy of it. Whatever.

The onion, it was greasy very greasy and I am sure the oil they used was old. It also didnt taste great. 

My burger was ok, fries were meh. His food? it was ok. but then he is always ok with his food. I must be picky.

Whilst the place was quiet we had to wait ages to get the bill. The service was not great and the place didnt seem clean. I wont even go into the state of the restroom :/

This place needs a refresh completely. Its not a wonder it was so quiet.",yMxcK-tnPDq0tDnBAhDDOg,3,0,1,rYgEl7xnB4YkJjA2_gJ7cQ

If your servers name is EARL...RUNNNNN!!!! He's rude, argumentative, and kinda a tool.  He told a customer across from us, who clearly had a really thick accent and was a tourist,  "" here in America....."" Really?! Just awful.

I sent my first steak back because it was a Frisbee, and just as tasty.....that turned into a whole discussion with the waiter who tried to convince me that because I ordered my steak well done it was acceptable for it to be a hockey puck.  I ordered ANOTHER cut, this time medium well.....and it came to the table still bleeding, mooing, and making milk. I was done! Earl then asked me if I wanted them to ""Cook it longer"".

The saving grace was the manager Patrick who was insanely awesome and attempted to rectify the train wreck that was my meal.  

There are numerous steakhouses in Vegas, so save yourself time and energy, and don't eat at this one.",3YgM2qhXCHS1Hy9j3eGioA,3,1,1,GChcOnoGEinEs3DrpjNuwA

Its always crowded as its good value for the money and nothing fancy as most ""Yelp-people"" know. 

Me and my dinnerdate shared a victorias filé and new york strip 50-50 to get two differnt kind of cuts. The filé was lean and tender at medium but the ny strip was really tasty. Not as lean as the filé but so much more steakflavor. This is the steak i will come back for! 
The ceasar on the side was ok but nothing more but the sweet potator fries was a real treat though a bit on the ""sugary"" side. 

Too bad this place cant offer anything else in sauce accept the A1 since most steaks taste even better with a pepper sauce or wine sauce. The sautéed onions as a side is a must. 

The service was fast with a smile and the cold Foster beer didnt dissapoint with the steak. 

The total check was around 180 $ for 4 with tip wich was good. 
This is not the best steak or the most beautiful restaurant but you get what you pay for and to get Vic & Anthony class dinner/steak its a different pricerange that is roughly double up from Outback and some more.",qFKZoe-_3qxk-iCKp1qfaA,0,0,3,674PNcJOvBdMsER7luKalA
