Thus place is so BAD I had to return my overcooked taquitos, BURNT, served with runny guac. Ugh.  My Chile relleno burrito could have been made better by 9 year old white girl.

The guys seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else. Too bad.. it was convenient to have a Mexican place near me.

1356867,2017-03-23,3,ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA,"We were so excited for this new location to open up, closer to home and with a drive thru. But it's been a hit and miss from opening day. So, I guess we'll stick to driving a little further down on Blue Diamond and stick to the location located between Buffalo & Cimarron (with no drive thru)...even though we're literally at the corner of Durango & Blue Diamond and this is our closest location. So since day 1 that it opened we've had some hiccups with our orders...but this particular day a few days ago was the last straw for me. Came through the drive thru on Tuesday March 14th ordered the 3pc taquitos with guacamole and cheese.. make it home which is literally around the corner open up my food and first reaction I'm like WTF?! Like are they serious? Who in there right mind prepares and bags up something like this for a customer. Like come on! I was so infuriated that I drove back through all the construction that is currently going on, on durango (if u live in the area, you know it's been a nightmare) I ended up going into the restaurant and there were a few gentlemen inside (Caucasian) so I didn't want to make a big deal even though I was upset. Myself being Hispanic...the lady at the counter/cashier immediately saw that I had my bag which she had just handed to me not more than probably 10 minutes prior...asked me what I needed...no hi..how can I help you. Not a good start considering how bothered I am to begin with. So I tell her, that I just came through the drive thru ordered taquitos with guacamole and cheese...got home opened up and this is what u all gave me. I open it up to her and she looks at me and responds...okay so what's wrong with it? I'm like are you freaken serious, that infuriates me even more. I ask her to look at the picture behind her on there menu..and ask her if my order looks like that....she now rolls her eyes at me and starts arguing that, it's not going to look like that because that's a professional picture. Okay, I get it...I don't expect it to look just like the picture but come on, so I ask her in Spanish ...again because I'm trying to be as discreet as possible. If she thinks that packing up and order like this to a paying customer is acceptable. I ask her if she wouldn't be upset if the tables were turned and she was the paying customer and received a dish like this if she would be content. Instead of offering a quick solution like a simple...we can make another order for you..she just continues to argue with me. And now in Spanglish, there's some English and Spanish in there so I'm like okay, you obviously don't care and see that I was trying to be discreet with you as to not draw any attention from other patrons. Because I'm not trying to feed into the stigma that unfortunately is sometimes placed upon hispanics. But her ignorance just feed more into that. I ended up just asking for a refund and will just stick to the other Don Tortaco location further down the street.  I ended up going to the other location got taquitos and it was night and day difference as you'll see in the photos. The 3pc was from the Durango/Blue Diamond location (next to McDonalds) and the 5pc from the location on Cimarron/Blue Diamond (Pizza Hut shopping center)",WwJ4AgyHLc4JVqhnTO884Q,5,0,1,xTPyvJIW8vuiFWHrCn9JfQ

I was patient but the people who had been waiting a while to even place their order were definitely annoyed.  I ordered a Bean and cheese burrito to keep it simple and it was delish! Took a while, but was fresh and the tortilla was fresh and a little flakey- nom! Also, the place is super clean- no fear of food poisoning here! Lol

1534092,2017-08-28,0,ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA,I love eating here normally I go to the one down the street because the customer service and food is always on point. Unfortunately I went against my gut and wanted to use the drive through on blue diamond and Durango. I asked for no meat because I am a vegetarian and literally they were so rude at the window. When I received my food my bag was sealed tied at the top which makes it impossible to open and keep everyone behind me waiting so I head home come to find out my fries are FILLED with asada. I'm just mind blown my whole meal is ruined and I don't even have the energy nor do I want to go back to tell them they made a mistake. I'm all about understanding mistakes do happen in the F&B industry but it's sad I don't even feel comfortable telling them they made a mistake bc of how rude they were in the first place.

I promise myself that I'm not gonna stop for chicken tacos on my way home, but I can't help it. 

Myfitnesspal says they've got similar nutritional info to a Quest Bar, only they taste like actual food (tacos are actual food). 

The taco Tuesday deal is out of sight too. Chicken tacos are $.99 on Tuesdays. 

I could eat 5 of them (and I have). 

The late night guys are so nice too.

3365892,2017-12-21,0,ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA,It's like the fast food version on a taco shop. The food is good and prices are cheap but it's not your good  authentic Mexican food.

3482850,2017-06-06,0,ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA,"I've visited this Don Tortaco several times for midnight food runs (they're 24/7). It's your average fast-food Mexican restaurant with everything you would expect: tacos, burritos, carne asada fries, etc.

In the handful of times that I've gone, I've never had any problems. They can be a bit slow at midnight, but I imagine they only have a couple people working, so it's understandable...especially if the line is multiple cars long. 

Overall, if you're craving good, fast Mexican food, Faustos is vastly superior...but they close at 11PM. Well done, Don Tortaco.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,3,Xqg5lbskOzrpUGqZ8BL2Bg

What is absolutely unacceptable to me is the horrific lack of customer service by the guy at the drive thru.  I've gone here a few times when he was working the window, and every single time he acts like a total (a) hole.  Tonight was the worst.  I truly have never come across someone so openly angry about doing his job.  I felt extremely uncomfortable bothering him by being a customer. 

If the owner of this store reads these reviews, please look at who was working the drive thru at 10pm tonight.  Someone needs to retrain him in appropriate and acceptable customer service, because I promise my family will never visit this location again if he does that to us one more time.",30bwgVuf6vX2za6yf1l0rg,2,0,2,3MI-GIVotmQiHzF_PzCeHA

It is unsafe for people with latex allergies and the fact that you don't tell people or act confused when people ask what kind of gloves you use is ridiculous.

4593336,2017-09-14,1,ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA,"Not sure why the reviews are so negative? Food is good, friendly service, no frills & 24/7.

I always, always get the California Burrito and it's consistently good. Asada, fries, with all the fixins neatly rolled up for your enjoyment, what's not to like? You got the crunchy fries, meaty meat, and cheeeese! The food is always really hot and comes out in a reasonable amount of time. The red & green salsas they have also adds a lot of flavor - only complaint is that the red ""hot"" salsa is not very spicy.  

Price is good and portions are on the large side. However, they do not give you the pickled carrots through the drive-thru, which is a bummer.

4720397,2018-02-25,0,ddplAthoA2pGLoSqhHpVkA,"I honestly have no idea why I always get the worst customer service here. I always tip good and am friendly. This morning at around 4:30 close to 5 I went through drive-thru and ordered two fries with guacamole, pico de gao, and beans. As I went up to the window I gave the cashier my debit card and about 10 mins later I get a notification on my phone from my bank that my card got charged twice. After the long wait, I asked the guy why my card was charged twice and he said ""because I took it off the chip reader too early"" .... ok? So I asked if it charged my card twice as it says on my bank account and he sort of stuttered and said ""I don't know"" mmmm ok. Then to top it all off, I asked if I could get some limes and he said ""you can't get limes through drive thru only red and green sauce"" what?! I just drove off at that point. This guy had tattoo sleeves and was in his 20's I believe. I didn't catch his name as he was really rude and rushing for no reason, it was 4-5 in the morning. Absolutely lazy and does not understand customer service. These type of things have happened to me a lot between this location and the one on Blue Diamond. Please do something about your rude and snarky workers. I do my best to tip more than average and still get the backhand. I think after this I am done with Don and I will not recommend it to anyone like I used to. And honestly, it's majority of your workers but he really put the icing on the cake. Please do something before you lose more customers. I now didn't pay two meals, I paid for four (only getting two).",ixqxz2nA98b2OeLj1e2zfg,0,0,1,mJyak-B-mbn2TnvBF-QjOQ
