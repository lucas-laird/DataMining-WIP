Why only 4 stars? The line (even for cabana reservations) was long and they definitely overbooked. We had a large group and had several things set up - a table, a lilypad, and an upstairs cabana and service was good, but not impeccable (and it should be for the prices you're paying!).

The table was comfy and was a good place to store your bags and shoes and you could order both food and drink. The Lilypad was a great place to be in and out of the pool at the same time .... but you can't order food or store your stuff (so luckily we had both the Lilypad and the table!). Service at both was good - but our hostess was definitely overbooked and it was hard to track her down.

The cabana service was top notch .... unfortunately, you can't be in the pool and the cabana at the same time which I think is good if your group is older and wants to stay away from the mess, but all we wanted to do was dance in the pool. For the price of a cabana, I think it should have some easy pool access (or some sort of mini pool, like Liquid Lounge) to tie the whole thing together.

Overall, it was a great pool party - our various hostesses were really sweet despite the crowd and we had an amazingly fun day.

As long a this doesn't turn into Rehab, I will definitely be back!",B1b-TtQ2tB8BhkJFB-Mnkw,0,0,4,dPP42LxrLgwHkgv4ULUA0Q

Got to the security and all of a sudden the security guard says he can't let me in, and asks another guard to check my ID. Coming to the pool party I did not bring any personal belongings with me because I didn't want to lose anything or get my phone wet. So they made me go back to my hotel (planet Hollywood, $20 taxi ride) to get my stuff to verify it was me and they still said it wasn't me! Long story short, they confiscated my ID for no apparent reason and rejected me from entering the pool party which we spent $200 on for tickets. They not only took my money and harassed me but they were completely inappropriate. They embarrassed me in front of people in the lines. Mind you we live in a country with freedom of speech. The only reason they took my ID was because someone said they need glasses. Never in my life has this ever happened to me! Their names were ""Gee"" and ""Jared"". I understand people need to do their jobs but that is not how you go about it. I tried talking to the manager but everyone said they weren't going to do anything about it so I didn't bother. After everything, I didn't get anything from it, not a free drink, refund, etc. It's very obvious these guards are hateful towards some individuals and not others. They should be fired for confiscating my ID for no reason",gVHXe3bzwI_ICYzwWQ2MiQ,2,0,1,TzeQmrT0ERajkXQemhlXDA

They found my 1 gram of cannabis, and after showing them my medical marijuana patient recommendation, they still wouldn't let it in the club, so I threw it out and went back into the club. 

On my second pass through security, they found and examined my bottle of GHB, and put it back into my purse and let me in.

97466,2012-05-23,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,I have no idea why people like this place so much. I was at the Encore casino gambling and decided to take a walk by the pool. I asked how much it was and they told me 60 dollars. Give me a break. Sixty dollars to go into a casinos pool and pay alcohol thats been marked up x 10 or more. Whats worse is that its not even topless like the rio's voo pool or bare or venus pool. The really bad part of my experience happened when I decided to skip the pool and gamble some more. The stupid security told me I couldnt go back in the casino. I couldnt believe it. I was being prohibited from going back into gamble. I guess some moron thought it was a great idea to prevent the pool party people from going in the casino. I'm sure all the gamblers inside would hate to see attractive girls walking around in bikinis. What a stupid idea that is. So after some complaining to another security guard they let me into the casino.So keep in mind that once you're at the pool there are no ins and otus and they wont let you into the casino. The crazy thing is I wasnt even part of the pool party. Ughh what a stupid place.,vceNZbXaJH1vvxsChvcUyg,0,0,1,h888rG1Nj3xezUXvL7O6kg

Once we got inside I was definitely taken back by how amazing the venue was. The pool was in the middle with daybeds surrounding it. There was also a pole in the middle of the pool for ladies to. um. perform.

You are more than likely going to end up buying a table unless you want to stand all day in the sun or stay in the pool..no shade...not my cup of tea. Waitress's are nice & pretty...however it was sooo crowded we barely saw her, but the bar back was pretty on top of bringing us ice & picking up trash. Don't get a Lilly pad when it's crazy crowded unless you want people all in your space, walking onto your Lilly pad to get across the pool or want  dirty pee water splashed in your clean drinking ice :-) They kept the bathrooms up-to-par considering all the wetness & messiness going on in there . I feel the service was wayyy better at Marquee Day Club (a couple of years ago when we saw Kaskade) even though smaller, especially the $$$$ that you spend for a VIP spot. Anyways only plus really was that we were staying at the Encore so it's gets A+ for convenience.

222055,2014-07-29,9,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"This place might have been tolerable except for the fact that there is nowhere whatsoever to sit down if you don't feel like shelling out an obscene amount of money for a cabana. I arrived very hungover at the behest of a friend and wanted nothing more than to lie down for an hour or so and just bask in the sun. Instead I was (very rudely) asked to move by snotty, bitchy staff whenever I tried to lay out my towel. I ended up having to lie down behind a couple of trash cans just so I could relax enough to not want to drown myself. Seriously disgusting and a rip off; get some fucking lounge chairs.

Additionally, the bitch who kicked me out of my first resting spot suggested that I take some Tylenol when I told her that I could barely function and really needed to lie down. Mixing acetaminophen with ANY quantity of alcohol, even residual, is very dangerous. If you seriously think taking Tylenol for a hangover is a good idea, you have no business working at a club.

Lack of seating aside, this place is like a convention for the Vegas douchebag population. Everyone has an attitude, and no one is interesting whatsoever. The people are hot, but they look like they came out of some kind of cookie cutter mold, and it is thoroughly uncanny and repulsive.

Only upside was a short term period of free mimosas for ladies (normally they cost your first born child), but unfortunately you do still have to shove your way through a crowd of basic bitches' asscheeks slapping up against you to get to and from the bar.",W7LKFIr5KGvoKauG5p7WAQ,2,4,1,-CeIr2hH-X68ORseHKiduQ

Drinks are typical Vegas fare so come prepared. Towels are provided which is nice. The bar can get pretty crowded when the place is jumping off.

I'd ACTUALLY get in the pool unlike rehab and wet republic. My cocktail waitress told me that they spent tons of money on that pool to keep it clean at all times. I went to the nightclub portion of it the night before, but it felt like a completely different party. Besides the structure and design of the place, it seemed to me that 90% of the crowd was there just for kaskade (DJ)  Service was great, but we waited awhile on our first order because they were slammed but all in all, everything came out on fair time.  

The cabanas are relaxing and perfect to host a party. My girlfriends and I got lucky and landed a cabana for kaskade on a sunday for 3bottles. (because we were an all girl group..I guess its normally a 2-3k minimum  ) 

Had some trouble with my original reservation so my casino host at the wynn referred me over to Ashley (A host over at the beach club) She definitely took care of us. She worked up front so we didn't have much problems at the door like most clubs

The music is the main reason, of course. Their lineup is unmatched by any other pool party and their focus on EDM is spot on. Whether the DJ is Tiesto, Calvin Harris, or David Guetta, they all make regular appearances at EBC.  The pool is also very big, certainly big enough to hold a critical mass of people. The layout is great and the security does its job without being overbearing.

If you plan to do only one pool party in Las Vegas, EBC should be your first choice. Saturdays are usually better than Sundays but really the DJ lineup is the most important.",btYnwrjAQPKrURHDbbwEQg,0,0,5,DPzdjyFnEX30pzlsyz4CnA

Got to the place and was told that all the tables for $1300 had sold out ; this is after having confirmed a reservation. Some short douchy little wannabe surfer dude with a clipboard came and said, well we can still get you a table if you give me $300. Wasn't happy to hear all this and he's like while you think about it you can get out of the line. We decided to just say F it and pay the 300 but now he's telling me to get to the back of the line, and that with an attitude like he's Steve Wynn himself.

Long story short, it's a awesome fun place, great dj's. BEWARE of the staff as they will try to drain every single dollar you have to get you absolutely nothing. I'm sure I'm not the first or last person this has or will happen to. 

Buy tickets in advance and stand in line. Way cheaper. Don't worry about bottle service unless you're willing to spend upwards of 5k.

All in all, I ve been here twice (Surrender at night) and it was decent. The only complaint is that it was packed with a lot of dudes. Even though I was there with my girlfriend, I don't want these drunk clowns smashing into me every 5 seconds trying to get to the bar. The drinks are also wayyyy overpriced. $12-20 for mixed drink. Don't know how much beers are, but I can imagine $10 a pop. They should have some local specials

While it was Sunday, this place is still very nice and definitely upscale. Steve Wynn makes a killing off of this place. Next time, I wish it wasn't as packed.",52P_VuuvtANwbr7vSiMp8A,1,2,4,_LijERQB_TkXoSz2hKvHiw

Some of the best EDM DJ's in the world.

The women here do not really exist and just appear from thin air to come party at EBC.  Then they disappear back into non-existence.

No hassle to get in if you buy pre-sale tickets or you're on the guest list.  For you nobodies, pre-sale tickets are highly recommended.

If you're rich, you can get a cabana, daybed or table.  If you're not, general admission for you.

We got a VIP table.  They charged us $1500 the space which included a bottle of Grey Goose and a bottle of  Petrone.  Whatever, on that.  It wasn't our scene and we decided not to stay right away.

What's the harm?  We weren't taking up their VIP space any longer and we paid for it all.

583005,2017-07-04,0,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Let me begin by stating that I have been to this party numerous times. It USED to be my favorite pool party in Las Vegas. The atmoshhere is great, but it comes at a premium. It is usually around $100 to walk in the door, and mixed drinks are about $65 each for their 'party' type cups (around 32 ounces probably) you are inside. This is not outlandish for seeing a top DJ at a pool party in Las Vegas by any means, but it is still a tad more expensive than anywhere else. I am okay with that since I really used to like this pool party. This particular time, my trip to this pool party probably ran me somewhere near $500 in total. After leaving and barely getting out the door, I realized I left my phone in the $75 locker. This meant I couldn't get an Uber back to Mandalay Bay where I was staying. Mandalay Bay is also the furthest possible hotel on the strip from where we were at. Within a minute or so after walking out the gate, I asked if i could get back in just to get my phone. This is where things started going downhill fast. They refuse reentry as a policy, which is understandable. I could either try back hours later in the night and see if they found my phone, pay $100 to get back in, or get treated like total crap trying to convince the man at the door to let me back in. After being talked down on and sworn at by the manager/bouncer, I eventually gave him the finger and was escorted off the premises. Keep in mind this didnt happen until well after being respectful and just seeing if the man could help me out after an honest mistake. All of my friends were back inside still by the way. He would not grab one of them to get my phone for me or anything. After this scumbag swearing at me and berating me after asking how he would feel if he were in my shoes, he basically did everything but get physical with me. They could really try being a host for people spending a lot of money there and be understanding, or they can treat people like garbage. After this whole experience, I was eventually escorted off the property for giving him the finger after this whole debacle and being treated like trash. This is super disappointing since I really do like the pool party, but they will never receive my business or my friends' business again. The absolutely inhumane treatment I received here was absurd. Thankfully, my friends were still inside and grabbed my phone when they left. Save yourself the lacklustre treatment the management is willing to provide if anything goes less than perfect.

The night swim is great if you don't want to dress up but want to party! They have floaties out to lay on and is a blast!

The day swim is also a blast. What I love about it is that there are three pools. Most other day parties only have one pool and it is too crowded. This club has a lot of room to stand, a lot of shady areas to stay away from the sun, and a ton of famous people play here.I would come to this beach party over Marquee any day.

This is definitely a tourist attraction where people are willing to drop hundreds if not thousand of dollars for a day of fun in the sun.

Beautiful venue, nice clientele, cool vibe and a good mix of music. I always find the Lillypad to be the best option as its right in the action but offers a 'base' where you can leave your stuff.

I have been 3 times and the amount of girls there always heavily outnumbers the guys, there is a reason though. The girls get free daybeds/bottles whilst the cheapest a set of guys can pay is $1300, however some will argue its worth it.

The only thing stopping this place getting a 5 star is the rude security, excessive amounts of lines and the volume of staff acting the part but doing nothing. sadly thats generally the downside of Vegas.",-DwzUfVMUlueZq-zocPl6w,1,0,4,r_HF4KCXvQ3yYIKamSWL8w

Got pre-sale tickets to Avicii because that was our main reason for going to Vegas and didn't want to risk not getting in waiting in line. On our way to the airport to get out there, we got an email from the ticket company saying that Avicii (although already retired but finishing his residency in Vegas) decided to cancel the rest of his shows and we were the first week that was impacted. 

Email said we could still go (obviously) or use the ticket for XS to see Skrillex. We were staying at Encore (and the hotel knows nothing about what goes on at the clubs) so we went to the concierge and told them I just wanted my money back. They didn't care and said it was a 3rd party we booked thru so there was nothing they could do and gave us a phone number to try to call (which didn't work)....even though we bought the tickets on the Encore website.

So, my suggestion is to get your tickets at the concierge and not risk buying them ahead of time in case someone cancels. It might be a few dollars more but worth it because from everything I heard, the Beach Club is amazing.

And FYI - stay at the Encore...it's incredible.",uvjN5IjPNbch0lze1G-4sQ,1,1,1,owl-4u559CylrmuCIxTrbQ

We were concerned about what the lines might be like, so we arrived well before the club opened at 11:00 a.m. We were the first in line, and got a primo spot next to the pool with a great view of the stage. There wasn't much of a line or a crown until after 12:00 p.m. You are allowed to put your towels down next to the pool to hold your space, but a word of caution...they get soaked!

The drinks are delicious, the service is impeccable, the server's outfits are even more impeccable. 

Some places dump a  party in a plain looking pool (wet republic) or a pool that's too small for my tastes (tao beach).  They are all successful in their own way but EBC does it all right.  Sometimes you tell people you went to vegas and attended a pool party and they don't understand why you had to travel X miles for water and people and music, things you could find at home probably.  

Showing them pictures of EBC will silence them without a word.

Even with the place at capacity, it still feels like you have elbow room. The bartenders and staff are very friendly and very attractive. The whole place emits what a vegas pool party should be like. 

A plus with EBC is a large gambling area behind the pools. For those who want to gamble or watch a few sports games, that is an option at EBC. You can always expect big DJ names at EBC with a fun environment and good crowd. I've never seen a single fight or drama at a pool party. 

The only draw back (which should be expected at Wynn/Encore) is the prices. Tables, cabanas, day beds are going to run high and drinks at the bar are right up there as well. One red bull vodka is $16 to $18 last time I checked. But, if you are there to party and enjoy yourself with friends, EBC should be a first stop without a doubt.

The DJ booth was amazing, and the water felt amazing compared to the hot hot summer sun. 

We fell into some people's amazing generosity and were invited up to the top tier VIP cabanas with bottle service and a really great cabana girl. She was pouring shots for everyone and all liquor, mixers, and waters were restocked all of the time. They had this huge bed where you can lay and look over the entire pool from the balcony for some serious people watching, though being in the pool was a better people watching experience.

By the end of the day the pool was PACKED. SOOOO many people. Thank goodness for the generosity of others because if I had to stay in the pool without anywhere to go... I would have left.

A young lady and I were getting it on a few times and as soon as we were about to ""put on a show"" the little boy lifeguard keeps telling us to stop.. I kept on asking ""what was your F'ing deal.? You should be rooting for me""  But I got no answer. Last year I did that and more and no one stopped me at all. So it gets 1 star less now, but over all it was a good time.

My belongings were all searched extensively in an inappropriate way.  The person doing the search removed and examined all items in my bag, even going through my wallet and all of my credit cards- forcing me to even throw out my banana.
The worst was my medicine. My name is on the bottles and I was told that I could not bring them inside. It was embarrassing to put the medicines out for everyone to see.  Apparently if I was in the normal and not the expedited line I would have been allowed to bring them in? 
I understand the need for more security in these venues but there has to be a consistent non-harassing way of doing it.

They beach club is big and they have multiple pools so there's always room in the pool when I'm there. The drinks are pretty outrageously priced, but I usually go because they have great headliner DJs.

My one complaint about this venue is that the floors are VERY slippery when wet...which is why they constantly have staff members sweeping the water away.

My group was running late and missed our promoter walk-in (boo) and got stuck at a table at the bar across the pool from the main stage with just a single drink ticket. The drink ticket was worth one drink valued up to $19, but obviously the bottle service we would have had would have been much better. 

I ordered a nice lemonade style cocktail that had St Germaine, a fruit flavored vodka and another liquor. It was extremely refreshing and I would have loved to have another but I didn't feel like emptying my bank account just to get a buzz. I bit the bullet at one point and got a $20 cup of Moet champagne. 

The club itself was awesome. Great music by the house DJ and Zedd was evening spinning later. That definitely caused a crowd. It took a while to get into the club- probably because they were checking inside everyone's wallet. As someone that doesn't hit the club scene often and does not do drugs, it was very off putting. 

The pool was crowded and my group took turns dipping in as we didn't want to get a locker or leave our stuff out. 

This probably never happens in Vegas, but it started to downpour for a good 45 minutes. Our table under cover came in pretty handy at that point.

Fridays are my favorite day to go since they do the giveaways and have been supplying most of my summer swimsuits (and I mean designer ones that typically cost $150). Security is pretty nice, the staff are helpful, and I've actually seen the lifeguards doing their job instead of standing around talking and not looking at the pool.

Do you know those movies where people have wild parties? Those spring break type movies, or maybe even Straight outta Compton?  When I watched those types of movies, I always thought ""man, real life cannot possibly be like this. No one parties like they do in the movies"".

Rest assured that Encore Beach Club is just like the movies...and even better. Top name DJs (the day I went, Chainsmokers were there); attractive crowd; dancing; imbibing. You name it, this place has it. 

I would go on, but at the risk of losing my Yelp Elite badge, I will keep this review family friendly. Yes it's expensive for guys. Yes it's crowded. Yes if you get there late, the lines are long.  Doesn't matter. Just go.

Protip: buy a waterproof phone. Trust me, it is worth it. My Galaxy S8 was a champ that day.

Protip: the big name DJs usually come on mid afternoon...3ish?  So you don't want to get to the club super early. I think if you aim to get there 1130-12 you should be ok. 

Protip: bring an empty water bottle - they will let you bring it in, and you can refill it at the water fountain as often as you want. 

Protip: if you see everyone hurrying out of the pool...there is probably a very good reason, and you should follow suit.",tejGH-sqC2iRz2ZQTZgsqw,9,2,5,DPRshSEqtloGAhULE49pnw

High end cabanas will run you anywhere from $10-25k

A bit ridiculous I must say. Drinks are $20-50, depending what you get. A small Fiji water bottle was $12! Ouch, Vegas!

I honestly don't get what all the hype is for EBC. SUPER CROWDED and ""Chainsmoker"" doesn't even come out until 3:30-4pm for about 1-1.5 hour before the day club closes. Eh, I pass. 

I actually USED to think day clubs were better than night clubs, but I may have to rethink this. 

Day Club:
1) HOTTTTTTT, freaking HOT in the summer (be warned--hydrate yourself. Heat + Alcohol can be a bad combo, so be careful!)
2) Not much shade
3) Pool water is so dirty 
4) The female bathroom has a HUGE line, so be prepare to wait for easily 15 minutes before your turn.

First time we went was for TJR 8/21 and then we went to Kaskade 8/22. For TJR we were on the guest list and got in for free. The line went fast, prob 15 min. We stayed for 3 hours and only had one drink because we had plans for later in the day and didn't want to get too drunk. It was so nice in there the setup and pools are beautiful, there are multiple bars and the staff is friendly. It was crowded for TJR but not too crazy, plenty of room to walk around and hang out in the pool comfortably. Saturday for Kaskade was a whole other story. We got there around 12:30 to make the guest list. The line was already huge. We waited in line for I'd say close to two hours because they reached max capacity and weren't letting people inside unless there were people coming out. When we finally made it in we had to buy a ticket because we missed the time frame with free entry for girls so we ended up paying $30 each (guys were $125, holy shit). Even though we were totally bummed we waited in line for 2 hours in the vegas heat, it was totally worth it. Once your inside you are having so much fun that you completely forget about how miserable you were in line. I honestly met a lot of cool people in line and they at least provided water coolers while your waiting. A lot of people brought beers with them that they were drinking while waiting which was really smart. The inside of the beach club was insane while Kaskade was playing. It was crowded, everyone was so hype and me and my girl friends couldn't help but feed off the energy. We ended up in a cabana with a bachelor party so we were extremely lucky to not have to pay for drinks. Drinks are extremely expensive so if you can afford it I highly recommend getting a table or cabana or if your a group of girls being extra friendly and meeting some guys with bottles. Cabanas are also nice because you have somewhere to put your purse/shoes/cover up. Other wise you have to get a locker or take a risk and hide your stuff somewhere inside.

1319446,2012-02-07,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Best pool party in Vegas. I was impressed in soooo many ways. I went to Surrender and thought it was ok, but as a daytime pool party Enocre Beach Club is off the hook!

I first attended the pool party the 4th of July weekend last year and was appalled when I was asked to pay cover. Moi and my girlfriend? Cover? I complained but sucked it up, forked over 30 dollars (they were charging guys 100) and 20 minutes later was glad I did!

Stripper poles in the water help with potential slippage and make for good pictures you won't post on Facebook. KASCADE spinning was the BEST! Everyone was happy, friendly, and had a killer body. Ladies: wear your high heels with your snazzy (think gold metal rings, shiny metallic colors, bedazzed sequined) bikini to lengthen you out. Don't worry, a cover up and a few drinks will take the edge off the social comparison if that's more your speed. 

As a note, the last time I went here I had to drive back to the OC after, and had only 1 drink. Even so, I still had one of the best times of my club-going life! The music and crowd is so good, you can get your natural high (wait, is that even legal in Vegas?) on and maybe even save some money on drinks.

A must-visit during pool party season! Cough up the cover and dance your bikini off (well, maybe keep it on while you are actually AT the pool)!",dB9AKxJx-d-vtMjuffYang,5,2,5,YqJvjgwuWMY3Wp9TkvX7Mg
1319732,2012-08-20,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Best high end pool party venue in Vegas hands down. I believe it is also the largest pool on the strip. I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...

Entry:
I can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it. 

Environment:
Unlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well. 

Food/Drink:
Drinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go. 

One complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us. 

EBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there. But Marquee is way smaller, super cramped and crowded and the drinks cost just as much.",qhqYQ0vbhjBFZN4fU93M9Q,4,0,5,Pmh_X_nK1eMd0oNcQGqoIQ

We asked for an explanation and they said it was private property and they did not need to disclose anything to us. My friend was coherent and civil. Even the servers agreed with us and told us not to pay any gratuity. We even spoke to head of security who sided with that asshole.

The music is always great with appearances from top DJs (depending who you buy tickets to see). What more do you need? Great music, good company and great drinks!

Tips: 
-Get ready to spend a pretty penny on drinks. They're not cheap.
-Get tickets beforehand. They tend to sell out and a 50 dollar ticket can turn into an 80 dollar ticket.
-Try the night time beach club once or twice, not as crowded but still great music and fun people.

1388444,2011-06-01,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"YAY! I am definitely a fan! 

Admittedly, I am not the coolest person on earth, especially when it comes to knowing the right people in the club/party scene and/or regarding what's hot or not in Vegas. You would have to ask my friends for that kind of covert info.

But thanks to those friends and their special connections, we were living it up at the Encore Beach Club with 2 bed booths and a pool cabana so needless to say, we had a blast! 

The Encore Beach Club and the XS Nightclub are both at the Encore Hotel & Casino - one is the day party and the other is the night party. I'll be reviewing the latter next. The overall hotel is quite impressive and luxurious; and everywhere you look, it's eye candy galore. That's to be expected in Vegas but in some places, the ratio of ""easy on the eyes"" viewing is much greater than others. 

For example, Encore Hotel versus Circus Circus. Ha ha wait, is that place still around? Actually, a more fitting comparison would be the Wet Republic versus the Encore Beach Club. The Wet Republic had gorgeous people everywhere but as one of the most sober people there this past Sunday, I'd have to say that the Encore Beach Club on Monday had 3-4 times the amount of amazing sights to behold than Wet Republic. 

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I am just calling it as I saw it. Plus, my opinion is based solely upon the female population at both day/pool parties. As much as I enjoy watching the Jersey Shore, gorillas, steroid enthusiasts, and full-body tats don't do anything for me; and neither do guys who have more alcohol and/or drugs flowing through their veins than actual red blood cells. To each his own, right Babe?

Sorry for being harsh (especially since I was in Vegas) and my intention is not to be mean but like I said earlier, I was one of the most sober people there AND guess what? I still had a spectacular time!!! All I need is music and a little bit of foot room, and I am happy as can be! 

The Encore Beach Club was awesome! Since we had 3 reserved areas, our group of 24 people didn't have to wait in the gnarly, long line. In fact, we were pulled-off to some side, artificial grassy area where we were carded and stamped. Next, they led us into our reserved area and started bringing-out the non-stop bottle service. 

Again, as I mentioned earlier, I am truly NOT this cool but we were celebrating my sister's birthday during Memorial Day Weekend and in Vegas, you either Go BIG or Go Home! 

The guest deejay was DeadMau5 and he definitely lived-up to his hype. His music was fantabulous and I think I danced at least 90% of the time; which when looking back, explains why my feet were so sore when we left. We arrived around 10:30-11am and left just after 7pm. I had a lot of fun at Wet Republic the day before but the Encore Beach Club was hands-down the BEST day/pool party ever!

My reviews have become quite the mini-editorials so on that note, I think it's funny that those of us who were neither shirtless nor thonged, stood-out in this crowd of swarming au naturel (or not) bodies and barely-there bikinis. And yes, there were plenty of guys sporting ""barely-there"" bikini bottoms who thought they could get away with them.

No complaints here but my eyes were so overstimulated that at some point, I became numb to the sea of nakedness. In fact, I think only a handful of people stood-out to me that day and it was because I couldn't see their derrieres, washboard abs, or glorious bosoms.

So we bought tickets to Dillion Francis. We found the line and asked if this was the line for pre sale. The lady told us this is the line and that it will move fast since this line is for people who purchased tickets. Well 2 hours later we get to the entrance. Yes two hours later! This was ridiculous. And once we got to the front there was people who still haven't bought tickets and were purchasing them! Why would there not be two separate lines. What was the point of buying them in advanced then. 

Once we get to the front the lady who was checking tickets was so rude. She was yelling at us and just seemed like she was stressed out. I understand it can get crazy but there is a certain way to conduct yourself especially at a business that is going to be taking you hard earned money. 

Once inside I don't know why we had to wait for so long, yes it was packed but nothing extreme. I understand trying to make it seem like the club is popular the hot spot to be , but that's why you have guest list lines.

Expanses of crystal-clear water, poles for dancing (holler!), 2 bars, infinity pools, card tables, huge orange beds, cabanas - just wow. There is a walkway right down the center of the big pool that also just begs to be walked over to either the Encore Beach Club bar or over to Surrender. 

Unfortunately when I went, it was a bit windy and the crowd was ridiculously mellow, but it was so beautiful. I definitely want to come back to see this place in the day and soak up some sun and take a dip in the pool which looks absolutely divine. This literally is the size of a beach and is just so pretty.

In town for a friend's bachelorette party 11 girls and I had breakfast with a side of Jell-o shots then rolled down to Encore. We weren't sure what the line would look like (even though we were on the guest list) so we got to Encore at 10am. There was already a line but there are water coolers, large umbrellas and fans at several stops along the line so it wasn't too bad of a wait. At one point there was a cooler full of mini water bottles so we grabbed a few thinking we could bring them in...Wrong!  All beverages must be consumed before entering, even the water bottles they just provided. 

We got a day bed along the pool with bottle service and are soooooooo glad we did. I kid you not there had to be 1000 or more people at the height of the festivities. If we didn't have the bed to leave our stuff and escape from the heat at times we probably would not have made it.  Our waitress was very attentive. 

DJ Snake performed an AMAZING set. We danced for his entire set and loved every minute of it. 

We were forewarned not to bring too many valuables as people sometime take things. We experienced this firsthand. We each had matching old navy flip flops with our initials in rhinestones as a part of our bachelorette swag bag. We all wore our flip flops to Encore then when it was time to go we noticed 2 pairs were missing. A couple of us walked around the party to search for them and sure enough we found them (one pair halfway across the party and another pair in some random girl's hand). Why anyone would want to steal Old Navy flip flops is beyond me.

Then when I was up at the front of the DJ area dancing, and security asked me to step aside so a VIP person could take my place. WTF. Then I complained to the manager who said my boyfriend and I could go backstage. Once he left another security person threatened to kick me out very aggressively because he said I couldn't be back there. The staff was insanely rude.

Definitely have to be on the guestlist to avoid lines and sorry guys you have to pay $40! Dayam! At least girls on the guestlist get in for free.

They are super strict about what you bring into the area, and will search every nook and cranny of your bag. They made my friends trash bottled water, snacks, Visine, any type of medication - even allergy or heartburn meds (They say they get a lot of drug use there, which I believe). 

Pretty crowded so there was no room for us 7 girls to put down our towels. Some of our purses got completely drenched because we had to lay our bags by the pool. Cabanas start at $3000 I heard and you have to pay for the lily pads to sit on as well.

The pools are shallow kiddie pools, not something you can swim in, but it was nice to just sit in the pool and get some sun. Decent atmosphere with decent music, but probably won't come back again.

The food was so good, especially the steak nachos and sea salt fries.  I wanted to eat more but I was trying to keep the salt off my abs.  I don't want to be a ""stick out"".  We had bottles but we also ordered strawberry daquiries and they were delicious.

I docked a star because the door goons were being shiesty.  They were trying to make some extra bucks in their pockets.  And when we said no thanks, they threatened to pull our guys out of the line or hold them back in line.  Wack!

1521586,2013-08-29,0,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Best pool ever! I enjoy Vegas but I'm not a fan of clubs so I found the Encore Beach Club to be a surprisingly good compromise to clubbing with a twist. There were so many things about my visit that made me fall in love with this place and count the days until my next visit.

Their service was spectacular! I sat at the gambling tables between the bar and the pool and had the nicest sweetest waitress, Shelly, wait on me hand and foot. I wasn't sure what to order and she gave me several delicious suggestions and made my time at the tables more enjoyable.

Two of my favorite things about Vegas is gambling and enjoying the warm summer evenings since we don't get those in San Diego. But at the Encore I don't have to choose between the two since they have gambling tables at their Beach Club I was able to enjoy the warm weather under the stars, gamble and when I got too hot I went for a dip in the pool 10 feet away. 

The pool, the pool, the pool. Wow! Magnificent! Wonderful! There are plenty of nice cabanas surrounding the pool but since I was there in the evening there was no need for a cabana, thank goodness I don't get moonburn, ha ha. There are awesome comfy lounges, lily pads, in the pool all along the sides you can reserve and get bottle service. This area is my favorite because there are seats that are in the pool with a table slightly raised and it is simply fantastic.

The pool is slightly heated, not like a hottub but just so its comfortable and not cold. This made it feel as warm as bathwater I never wanted to leave. In fact, it was just like a giant bathtub with all my favorite toys to play with. There were a ton of fun toys, floaties, tubes, etc. There's nothing like a grown up pool party when all the ladies are wearing floaties around their arms and tummy. There is also a stripper pole in the middle of the pool for ladies only and the stripper pole has a dresscode: bathsuits/bikini's required.

And just in case you are worried about there being to many people, there are 3 different pools and countless cabanas so it was very spacious!!! 

The music was fantastic, the DJ played the best songs, I danced/swam all night long. We showed up around mid night and partied until 4am. I've never been in a pool so long I was wrinkly for days.  

Overall it was one of my best experiences in Vegas. So many of my needs were being met at the same time and in one location. I don't know why anyone would leave this place.",e5nNwIh3M_5eMhQ-AKa3GA,3,3,5,GdDo9lEi1ZuPNYJ-rK_TRA

I recommend buying presale tickets or getting a table. The guys in our group bought tickets online and only had to wait about 20 minutes and they were inside in the AC. After all our drinks and admission we spent well over what we would have on a bottle. We should have gotten one! Don't be like us.

They also have daybeds on a second floor area where those who chose to drop that kind of cash could gaze loftily at the dancing peasant monkeys below. 

There was a stripper pole or two as well next to a few other collections of wicker couches. There weren't any professional dancers there that night, but people had fun dancing on the poles themselves and taking silly pictures.

They have food that runs $16-18 per item and consisted mostly of greasy fried food. We got the chicken fingers and waffle fries but it was too greasy and we ended up throwing half of it away. 

Cups of tap water were $5 each, but there are water fountains next to the bathrooms that you can refill them at. They also sell bottles of Fiji water barely the size of your fist for $12.

Otherwise, $20 for girls $30 for guys. 

Came here on a lazy Sunday, slightly windy but still very sunny. Came here early for the free mimosas and it was pretty empty and then picked up later on. During the night, the beach club is Surrender, so there is a DJ/dance area space. BEAUTIFUL pool, sparking with cleanness with lots of classy day beds and cabanas. The staff was SUPER nice and  attentive. Maybe a little too much..kept arranging our shoes. Haha, nonetheless very nice especially bartender Dave, saved us from our sobriety. Big shout out to him because he took open bar mimosas seriously and was very generous with champagne. 

Other drinks. The kind Samaritans got a pitcher of Raspberry Lemonade and Mojito. Both DELISH but the obvious favorite is Raspberry Lemonade. We bought them a pitcher, which was pretty pricey ($85) but a good time with new friends is priceless!

It might be a good idea to get a table/day bed/cabana because there were a lot of people who just had to leave their things by the planters, which isn't ideal in my opinion. Kinda pricey- I think the girls dropped around $700, but just talk to a promoter. Day beds are so awesome...

Huge DJ booth and dancefloor in front of it if you want to get your dance on.

You gotta pay for everything to truly enjoy yourself here.  If you want to relax by the pool you must pay for a cabana, daybed or lily pad.  If you want to sit for free you gotta sit in the pool or come early enought to find a concrete seat surrounding the palm trees.  No complimentary lawn chairs were available as in some of the other pool parites.  I saw a few girls trying to lay on their towels by the pool but they were asked to get up and move because it wasn't allowed :(  Bought a few drinks at the bar and was disappointed that they couldn't provide ice and water in a cup...you had to buy a $7 bottle of water.   

Not sure if the objective of this place was to have people lounge around and sit in the pool the entire time.  If the DJ wanted to get people live and dance he should've got the hint by switching up the music and playing something most people were familiar with (the only time I saw people get excited and dance was when he played Ne Yo's Give Me Everything, but for the rest of the time the DJ kept playing same boring electro beat).

All in all I'm glad I came to experience this pool party.  I wouldn't definitely recommend this place and come back.",lqpMr1u15v20pfanPq-qlg,1,0,4,OqcQ6eR_rswGPvJPI-ccZg

I was skeptical. The night before we went, I had lost my phone at Marquee, so I was in no mood to party, but I decided to walk with my friends to EBC even though initially, I wasn't planning on going. But when we got there, I just couldn't help myself and hopped in line with them.

Definitely do NOT regret that decision. 

This was hands down one of the BEST experiences from that Vegas trip and I would go back in a heartbeat.

We went with a large group, so booking a lily pad (""table"") was definitely a must. We racked up quite a bit in charges, but again, so so worth it!

Random thoughts:
- The water looks ""cleaner"" here than it did at Drais. I don't know if it's because the people here are cleaner (lolsies) or if it's because they do a better job of cleaning the water, but there was a noticeable different between the water here and at Drais-- the water at EBC actually looked clear...
- Go early because it gets crowded and make sure you stay hydrated! One of my friends got heat exhaustion from spending so much time in the sun!
- The bag-check line here is relatively fast compared to some other places, though that being said, it's still a pain and slower than I would like.
- I love the ""lifeguards"" here. While they are probably actually legit lifeguards, part of me still believes that they are just attractive models who have been paid to dance in the lifeguard chairs.

tl;dr: EBC gets 5 stars from me because I had such an amazing time here! But seriously, if you're going to go to any day club during your visit in Vegas, go to EBC! No regrets!",aSUmRlQxraEBVRnhpx9l9w,5,1,5,80UFmRv3fzi_-piYn6fpKg

Showed up around 12pm on a Saturday afternoon and the staff was very helpful at directing you to the appropriate line.  The wait to get in was about 10 minutes and we just breezed through security.

Keep in mind that you will go through an extensive security check, but once you are in, it's totally worth it.  Once inside, you are instantly greeted by a fine looking crowd that is ready to party and have fun.  The wait to get a drink at the bar was fine. If you have been to Vegas as much as we go, you know that you better get your pre-party on before coming if you want to avoid paying $18 a drink...but then again, hey it's vegas, so it's expected!  Be ready to swipe that card if you want to keep the drinks flowing all day.  There isn't anywhere to sit, but then again, you are at a pool party, so it wasn't a problem.

Word of advice, if you want to get in the water, go early in the day since as the day goes on, the water gets warmer, more murky and filled with empty cups, straws, and PEOPLE! lol but if that's your thing, then more power to you.

The music was awesome. The crowd was friendly and ladies,  it's vegas! I was a bit apprehensive thinking of how I was gonna look in a bathing suit around all these strangers when there are soooo many people that are built like chiseled statues, but once you get in and start drinking, all that anxiety goes away. There were both women and MEN letting it all hang out, and some in a good way and some in a bad way. In the end, who cares, it's vegas and you probably wont see these people again so YOLO!

I originally had a deposit in for a Lily Pad, but I had my host upgrade us for free to a daybed, front and center (You can't order food on the lily pad since it's in the water). Our view of the DJ booth was insane. The daybed was right behind the water couches, which is what I originally wanted, but they sold out weeks earlier.

The opening DJ was really good, considering he had to spin for almost 3 hours long. We ordered pitchers of some cocktail, bottles of vodka, and a bunch of food for everyone in my group. Our waitress was prompt and continuously checked in on us. Once Avicii came on the place went nuts and everyone was jumping up and down.

I can see why EBC is considered the number 1 dayclub in Vegas. It has that touch of sophistication and an amazing party atmosphere.

If you're thinking about getting a table/beach couch/cabana/daybed/lily pad, I recommend you go through a host instead of their booking website. You'll definitely get a better minimum spend on the location going through a host.

I can definitely see why they say this is one of the best pool clubs now.

First of all, girls are free before 12am. I heard its only the first 300 girls who get in for free on guest list. I highly suggest getting there and being in line by 10AM!!! Line gets super long super fast. (Guys - BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE AHEAD OF TIME!!)

Lockers are $25 and then an extra $5 for every time you want to get something which is crazy ridiculous. but whatever , its vegas right? So best to bring least as possible unless you have a table or cabana.

Cocktail pitchers here are $99 !!!! It was more than we were expecting but it tasted good and was great for pictures. We had the strawberry lemonade cocktail. We poured it out into cups and it was enough for about 4-5 drinks.

The water felt great and by the end of our stay, I could still see my feet in the water so im glad it didn't get disgusting.

I can honestly say that its so much easier to get in the crowd in the pool then a crowd at the club. There's always somewhere to sit or stand. And everyone can get a view of the stage/dj.

Overall, i had a blast here. Definitely would come back again.",V-FI5ytm8ZAe8Lo6wdTdBg,7,1,5,pQmpZ6sNcWFHXfc7SdY9nQ

My advice: book directly through the venue, pay a little more, and avoid the hit-or-miss drama that comes with a Host/Promoter.

Andre the host arrived at 12:30p.  My gf and her friends were waiting at 10:30a in line even though they had reserved a couch.  Unresponsive via text.

Cmon bro, I know you ""just tryna hustle n grind"" but let's at least show up to work on time.  If not, please tell your clients what time you do plan to show up so they don't stand in line for 2 hours.

They even had to grease him for $200 to ""get in"".  LOL.

Fortunately the Door staff (thanks Saleena for being a friendly face and Armando for delivering my hangry Gf her food), Bag Check staff, Security, Wait staff, and David Guetta were all 5 stars.  We ended up having a blast.

Lesson: Book direct thru the venue.

Yes - beautiful, and big, but if you dont get that like an hour early there is no where to sit, put your stuff, and just relax. A couch was $650 - not happening. If you are in the pool, you constantly have to watch your stuff. Towels at the side of the pool do not stay one bit dry - thank god Vegas is like 100 degrees so you can just get out and air dry.

Sound system was good. Kinda snobby crowd, but mixed. Drunk and sloppy girls all over the place - so guys get your move on. I think I saw about 5 girls try and be cute by dancing on the pole in the middle of the pool and broke their a$$. One guy even took this poor girls money because for some reason a lot of people here think their money is safe just tucked away in their bikinis.

 The beach club was pure bliss.  It really was a club in a pool, there was even a waterfall like cage.

My brother, cousin and I decided to go to Encore Beach Club on 9/2/2017 thinking that we were going to the best hotel  in Vegas. Well, that was the worst decision we've ever taken as our time of fun became a nightmare. 
We paid around $300 total for tickets. We paid $75 dollars for one day rental of a locker thinking we were going to keep all of our items secured. I mean for $75 a day and with a code to open, it's fair to think so, right? 
We were in the pool having a good time. NONE of us have ever used drugs thank God. We are good people who were looking to have a good time like any other tourist in Vegas in a pool party. We ordered 1 beer for each of us and after the beer we ordered 1 cranberry vodka for each of us and that was it. We never left our drinks unattended. We were together as a family the whole time having fun. Well, that was enough for me to not remember anything. Right after I finished my vodka cranberry, I blacked out and next thing I know I'm waking up in the ER. My brother got kicked out by a security guard because some guys were fighting. My brother was NOT fighting with anybody he was just coming out of the bathroom. They didn't allow him to get his stuff from the locker. He was kicked out to the strip in the 100 degree heat with no shoes and no shirt no I'D, no money, and no phone. My cousin who was coming out of the bathroom right after my brother was taken by a police officer and put in jail for ""Obstructing an officer's way"" and given a ticket of $1000. The three of us can't even remember most of what happen after we were taken. I don't even remember how I got to the ER. I only know that I had to be CPR due to being really intoxicated. Again, all of these happened after finishing those vodka drinks from the bar at Encore Beach Club and again never leaving our drinks unattended. To top it all off, the next day we came back to retrieve our stuff from the locker. On the phone, when I had called in the morning, the lady from Lost and Found told me that they were only $260 dollars cash in one wallet and $324 In another one. We had a total of $600 cash in the locker. When we got to pick up our things, they only gave us back $324 dollars and NOBODY was able to help us with what we were missing. Also, our clothes were stolen which included a pair of really expensive Hugo Boss shoes. All of these iteams were locked in a ""very secure"" and expensive locker. We tried to file a report at Encore and guess What? The report writer had us waiting over and hour and when he finally got to us he made us fill out a form and told me that it would take him 10 minutes the most to create the report and that he was going to come back with his manager so we could talk to him. Well, he never came out of the office had us waiting for another hour at least and we never heard from anybody. They sent us from the Wynn to the Encore and from the Encore to the beach club and vice versa. Nobody knew what to do in a situation like this we were told. One would blame the other one but nobody resolved anything. Excuse the language but they only bullshitted us and were very rude to us.

I AM SO UPSET THAT I WAS EVER AT THIS PLACE AND I HOPE OTHER PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY GIRLS/BOYS THINKING TO GO THERE BY YOURSELF, IT'S FUN FOR A MINUTE UNTIL SOMETHING AWFUL HAPPENS. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST, STEALING AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF TOURISTS. I'M NEVER EVER COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE. ALL THE MONEY YOU PAY FOR THEM TO STEAL FROM YOU. 

I still have no idea what happened to me or if someone did something to me in the time I passed out. I really don't wish this to anybody.

Problem was the staff at the bag check in. Its not our fault that you had to work on a holiday weekend. Doesn't mean you have to steal from peoples wallets. They put your stuff in a big plastic bag and tie it up. Theres no locker. If I had known this I wouldn't have brought so much cash in my wallet. Hopefully I was only one of the few unlucky ones, but I think for such a supposed high end place, I am extremely disappointed that they have such lousy, entitled, poorly trained in customer service staff.
If you truly want this to be the best pool day club, create a better bag check in system (for the amount of money the establishment gets from drink and ticket sales, I'm sure they could afford LOCKERS) or, hire honest people.

My friend got us on the guest list so we didn't have to pay cover. The place is huge inside!! And it's not ridiculouslyyy crowded like Tao Beach. You still have a lot of room to sit, stand, walk, dance, breathe. Music was really good too but not so loud that you feel the beat pumping through your entire chest. I guess that could be a pro or con depending on your preference. 

I also had one of the best drinks of my life here! Do yourself a favor and go to the bar and get a WATERMELON 21! It's on the cocktail menu. It's a little pricey at $15 but we all loved it!! It's so refreshing, you can barely taste the alcohol, and it comes with a salted rim even though it's not quite a margarita. Yummmm! I want another one right now! 

The only downside about this place is there's not many beds which are all reserved, so if you want to tan and lay out, you just have to find a spot near the pool and lay on your towel. 

Overall, it's a really fun pool scene, perfect for young people to come and have a good time whether you wanna go crazy or just chill at the pool. Highly recommended!",53-0CIUo-pd5ysfvHXb2yQ,8,5,5,Qhe2A2Z2MjunM3vUTY0lYQ

Myself and my two buddies had a GREAT time here.  We utilized a 3rd party company called Good Times VIP for our tickets and although we were warned about doing this it ended up being the best idea of the trip.  Not only did we bypass all the lines but we paid about $100 for 3 guys to enter.  Usually for guys, tickets are going to run you about $50 per.  The individuals who bought tickets through Encore or had whatever hook up from the random promoter on the strip that still lives in his parent's basement were in that line for a LONG time.  Check in is pretty intense but I had no problems bringing in my book bag with all of our stuff in it.  Right after check in we checked our bag.  It is $25 dollars to check your bag and you can get it in and out as many times as you want.  Then with your money, cell phone, or any other valuables you put it in a plastic bag they seal in front of you.  The wrist band they give you has a series of numbers on it that matches the sealed bag.  No this will cost you $5 to check and re-check throughout the day.   This isn't a shocker but drinks are expensive.  We drink beer so buckets of beer were $144 but it was for 12 beers which last a little while.  My only complaint is the water situation.  I did not see any available for free and when you order water at the bar you get this fancy 4 oz bottle of Fiji water.   What the hell am I supposed to do with that?  I think after we took turns buying buckets with 3 waters our total each time was $177.  The place is beautiful and it is definitely on the bucket list if you are doing the whole pool party scene.  Music was great, we were there for TJR and it was busy but not as crazy like when some of the mega star DJ's spin that sh*t.  I thought everybody looked like they were having a good time and I saw all kinds of different people at this event.  I think Encore would like you to believe that only people who are models and don't eat carbohydrates are allowed in but that is far from the truth.  Trust me I saw the same people I see at the Flamingo Pool at this spot.  All different shapes, sizes and colors.  Most of the people that are beautiful work there and I am pretty sure they are computer generated holograms.

First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. 

As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. 

We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). 

Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. 

Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best.

I went for a holiday weekend and it was $50 to get in. It appears that its better to book ahead of time to get a small discount as many people already had tickets. It's a pricey day; a drink is about $15. Even without a cabana, the pool side is very fun. Try to come without any bags or anything as there's no appropriate place to store things.

The bungalow, however, made my experience at EBC quite tolerable, and even fun.  I don't even want to know how much my friends spent- the bungalow was beautiful, they had a private pool, a daybed, food, bottles, drinks, and they kept on coming. The bungalow also had its own bathroom, server, and even a balcony overlooking the strip.

Luckily, we arrived just in the nick of time.  We arrived at 1:45, and they closed the pool at 2pm- SOLD OUT.  So, I'd definitely suggest getting there early. 

Looking out from the bungalow, there was a SEA of people.  I could barely see the water- it was just people packed, wall-to-wall.  If I were in that mess, I think it would get really old, really fast.  

The music was pretty standard Vegas electronica/dance/club/house. I'm not sure who was DJ-ing, but it was fine.

But I do love the layout of Encore Beach Club, and the fact that they're doing EBC Nightswim is definitely enough reason to compel me to come back here. So when EDC Week threw up darkWATER at EBC, I had to come back here.

Layout-wise, this is probably my favorite venue in all of Las Vegas (and this does consider XS, my favorite club). There's plenty of space here even when it's packed as hell. It feels super luxurious with the rows of cabanas in the back. The pool is LARGE and is nice to hang around (but I'm good on going in it, obv). Bathrooms are always clean. And there are padded seats, if you can manage to snag one.

EBC isn't perfect though. The ""dance floor"" in front of the DJ booth is TINY, and it's always a dangerous place to be since foot traffic is very prevalent there. Drinks, as to be expected, are ridiculously priced. And the biggest issue I have is that security literally takes FOREVER before you can get in. Even for Vegas security, EBC security takes it to a whole another level. No, I don't think waiting 30 minutes in line for security is normal smh.

Although it's not without its flaws, it's definitely one of the best venues in Vegas. If the music is right, I'll come back for sure.

P.S. There are water fountains near the bathroom in the back. If you don't want to pay overcharged water, definitely make a pitstop here.",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,4,3,4,PRZMGo9LYeGcwzWpYDlICA

If you complain about paying $15 for a beer, you should probably just go play the penny slots at Circus Circus.  It costs $30 to get in and drinks are expensive. This keeps certain people out (who should not be there for various reasons). The regular pool is free, go there if you don't want to spend money.

Now let me warn you, that my experience is from being in my early 20's with a group of only girls (both huge factors when you're out in Vegas)

The first time I went here, we were on the guest list with a promoter that we didn't know too well, and he conveniently forgot to mention that we had to be at the club before 1 in order to get in for free. We had friends with a cabana inside, so we coughed up the money ($30!) and got in.

Once in however, the place was a blast, good music, lots of people. ( We went to another hyped up beach club, and it wasn't nearly as fun because there weren't as many people and therefore it wasn't as much fun)

We went a second time and got in with a promoter that we knew a lot better, he met us outside and walked us in, which was amazing, though not everyone is going to get this kind of treatment. Just be sure if you're on a list, to know what time you need to be there by, and it always helps to have one person be the contact with said promoter.

This time we made friends with the group that had rented the Ultra Lounge (great decision, free drinks all day) 

Now, reading some of the comments, the drinks are expensive and so is the cover. But make friends! If you're with a group of girls, I promise you it's not that hard to find a group of guys that are willing to get you a drink. Hang out in the pool, have fun, and the rest comes naturally.",MvdsDEtz7MfafjPrPpk6IA,0,1,5,_KrBJxnHs9UQL3lovPZ6xg

-the bathroom has long lines
-there is barely any room to sit, let alone put your stuff anywhere; so you're basically wading in water the whole time. (there are lockers that you can pay to leave your stuff though)

So unless you get a table/cabana, it's not very comfortable. Don't get me wrong, the music was awesome and I had a lot of fun with my friends, but the layout needs work for us lay people who cant afford throwing around money for a table.

I liked that they did have good music- even though the DJ was not a famous one. There were also inflatable rafts and toys to play with.

I personally like a lounging area where people can mingle and walk around and hang out. I hate being forced in a specific area at a club/pool party.

Also wtf is up with no contact in the pool?? You are scolded and forced to back off from the opposite sex if you are in ""making out"" distance. What is this, elementary school?! People are supposed to hook up at a pool party, thats why people come to vegas right? This only applies in the pool but people can apparently dry hump on land. Bizarre policy. There is a staff that hawks the premisis who literally go around and prod you with a stick like cattle if you are too close. Beautiful venue, but I am an adult and I'll do what I want. It's vegas!

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

Encore Waitress: ""Are you ladies okay?"" 
Us: ""Uuhhhhh yeah. We just need a minute to take this all in.""
(Proceeded to pick our jaws up off the ground)

The truth was it took about 15 minutes for us to take it all in because this place is ridiculous. My girlfriend and I decided to head to Encore Beach Club on our first day in Las Vegas as she got us on the guest list. We expected some people hanging out by the pool and what we got was a movie called: BIKINI DEBAUCHERY 2. There must have been at least 1,000 people at the pool on this day and it was packed with half-naked 20-30 somethings. If you can't swim, don't worry, there are lots of flotation devices (aka fake boobs) everywhere. We decided in order to acclimate ourselves to this party we really needed a drink or two. 

Be prepared to pay through the nose for drinks and food. My friend's Bud Light was $12 and my bloody mary was $19. Holy tomato juice Batman! We were starving and decided to split an $18 burger from the Grill but surprisingly it was one of the best burgers I've had in my entire life! Worth it for sure! 

If you have the chance, order one of those waterproof cell phone/credit card holders off of Amazon. That way you can put your phone and money in it and swim with it around your neck. Why would you want to do this? Uh, because it's $15 for the bag check. 

Other than the price tag for everything (let's not forget the $20 cover for guys), this was one of the best pool parties I've ever been to in my life! The DJ was amazing and there's just something super fun about partying in waist deep water in the hot sun. Although it probably would have been more fun if I was a 21-year old single girl, the people watching is extremely entertaining. I was here for my bachelorette and it only gave me more proof that I making the absolute right choice in getting married. But if you're ready to party like a  single wild thing then this is definitely the spot for you!!!",fgwI3rYHOv1ipfVfCSx7pg,30,30,5,Io69_21TL8-qoa-GalfoSA

Anyways, it was my first time at EBC, and it was the highlight of my trip! The venue looks much better in the day, and I love the color scheme; red and white, very luxurious. My girls and I were on the guest list, and we also got access to the free mimosa bar. Yay for being girls, sorry dudes lol. 

Honestly though, a club is only as fun as you make it, and who you surround yourself with. The music plays a part too, and it wasn't all EDM. It was mix of bay area hip hop, top 40's and some EDM; just the way I like it. My friends and I were able to listen to Zedd's set, but we didn't even realize it, because we were having too much fun within our group of friends and strangers, LOL.

I'm giving EBC a five star rating simply because I HAD A BLAST here. It was so much fun, and what I think is the true definition of ""fun in the sun,"" alcohol and swimsuit style!

TICKETS: My fiancé bought tickets online but now I see here ladies should get in free but he paid for my ticket online so might wanna hit up some promoters if you're going to see if you can get in free or at least discounts for guys. They say you gotta be there by 11am but we came later and still got in. Of course you gotta wait in line because they gotta check ids stamp your hand check tickets and check your bags. 

MUSIC/DJ: Loved David Guetta. The music is definitely loud if you're in front of the DJ area. Music was great I absolutely love his music and mixes. 
Casino area available accessible connected to the pool area but high minimums. 

CHECKIN: They check bags beware you cannot bring eye drops they took mine which sucked because my eyes get dry especially when outside in the sun. Also can't bring outside drinks not even water bottles. No medicine not even if it's in the labeled packaging. And no you can't get anything they take from you back at the end
. 
DRINKS: Drinks are expensive of course. Grill snack bar and only a couple tables to stand at I wish they had more tables. 

PEOPLE: Crowded for sure and no seating area unless you paid for it so we had to opt to sit on the ground on towels near the edge of the pool as people walked by us. Upper areas with paid for pool beds and suites. 

OVERALL: Overall good pool party not too rowdy and more classy compared to Rehab at Hard Rock where people are off the wall crazy drunk and leaving and pouring cups and drinks in the pool. I'm upset they took my eye drops but rules are rules.",ECjfeIqrQj6e7VXVCTOleA,17,9,4,KB9ZDeyTXfiWKoxIg_6BNg

Get your tix online, especially if you're a dude, unless you really want to pay a few hundo for admission at the door.  Even with a GA ticket, plan to wait online for a bit or arrive early when they open to avoid the wait.
We went here earlier this month and Guetta was spinning.  We were thinking of getting a cabana for this event (came to Vegas for a Bachelor Party), but with a $5k min price tag we opted out.  Another offer was to have a ""lily pad"" for $3K.  Lily pads are crap so I'd advise against this option.  
Best option in my opinion - pregame AND THEN head over to Encore. Then maybe a couple drinks/shots while you're there.  Shots will run you on avg $20 and drinks are NYC prices, but it's Vegas so you expect all of that!

Probably my favorite Day Club, I just love the Wynn and Encore in general and I still haven't tried their buffet yet. Comparing this to Wet Republic is like Night and Day.

The pretty life guards dances to the music as well when compared to other Day clubs.

 The crowd is a lot more mix than other clubs with more asians than other clubs (other than maybe TAO with the older asian crowd)  I hate the fact that they make you buy a bottle of water for 10 dollars rather than just have water cups though. At least there's a fountain so you can refill

They absolutely get a 5 star rating when it comes to the huge POOL PARTY vibe. 

Why I am rating them at 3 star....

1.) Drinks are outrageously over priced. $21 for a drink in a small plastic cup is abominable! Its either this or a $65 drink that is made up of #4 small drinks. If you want water... you must pay $14 for a 330 ML (11.2 oz.) bottle. This was PREPOSTEROUS!! I even asked the bartender for tap water and he laughed in my face.

2.) Service was horrid! There is no customer service. Every bartender was rude.

3.) Getting into this place is difficult and expensive. You need to arrive hours early to get in for free and you must be on a list through a promoter in order to get in. If not, you pay $60+ to get into this place. 

The plus side is there is always some sort of big DJ that comes to perform. For example: David Guetta was there the last time we went. 

This place is always busy, packed, no personal space. If you don't mind this and just want the pool party feel, then this is the place for you. Just make sure you bring lots of money with you for all the expenses.",KJRRbmhf8bRLbTcoeb98tg,1,0,3,uAjaVJjQIq3DROugCsrqkg

Also, the system I use at work is down, so... you know. 

All the previous times I attempted a Vegas day-rage experience had been a complete and utter fail-- TAO Beach was overly crowded, extremely douchetastic, and had absolutely TERRIBLE customer service; the pool at Wet Republic smelled strongly of semen, sweat and human desperation; other times, our group, valiantly fighting to uphold the stereotype that Asians are late to everything, did not get to the dayclub in time to claim our free daybed and decided to reaffirm the other stereotype that Asians are terribly cheap and went to the pool instead.

We had to deal with a lot of the same Vegas BS when we went to EBC.

WE DON'T NEED TO COUGH UP OUR DOUGH TO HAVE OUR LADYPARTS IN YOUR CLUB. Alas, we did, and that good ol' Asian stinginess was about to kick in again when our friend reminded us that we had dragged ourselves out of bed specifically to come here, that we'd been wanting to check out EDB forever and to stop being such cheap-o beezies.

Point taken. So we waited in the sweltering Vegas heat, steadily sweating out our morning buzz, as the line inched slowly forward, frantically texting our promoter the entire time.  We finally did make it in and had to wait in even more lines to get drinks, but after that, the par-tay definitely gets going!  ENCORE BEACH CLUB IS LEGIT!  It's hit-or-miss at night as Surrender but EBC is as fun as a barrel o' monkeys.. or a barrel o' vodka...

The prices weren't too bad for vegas either. Even though it was 75 plus taxes to get in it was well worth it. Definitely coming back once I get the chance to come to vegas again,XBm-4vk_M7PnenCWwUfSzA,1,0,5,YFuQwnFBdFaQ06HUPjwQmQ

The only reason this review is a four star instead of five is because of how many pool floats they had in the pool. They were being thrown around the entire night, hitting everyone in the face. The amount of floats in the pool were so excessive that it was baring on unsafe for everyone swimming. The aesthetic of a flamingo float was not worth getting hit in the face multiple times",gLtaVZoAfUSn4DKJScaD3g,0,0,4,t4WyuPzLHoegPfTaCN4bGw
2598195,2010-08-25,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"This last weekend I went to Vegas for my buddy's bachelor party and got to experience how he and some of his friends do Vegas.  Traditionally, when I go to Vegas, I'll catch a show, eat at buffets and nice restaurants, play a little poker, and walk around the strip with my wife and friends.  They do Vegas in a completely different way.

We got in Friday afternoon and checked in to the Palms Place hotel.  We then went to Ditch Friday and got trashed.  The rest of the day was spent in recovery for many of us.  But Saturday, we went to Encore.

We had reserved a cabana for the 13 of us on the lower level with quick access to the stairs leading to the pool.  The cabana had a HD TV, ceiling fan, volume controls for music inside, a long couch with some accompanying ottoman chairs and tables, a fridge, a safe, some lounging furniture in front, and a balcony facing the strip in back.  I don't remember what the minimum was for the cabana...I think it was $2000.  We ended up spending over $4000 because each bottle is about $1000.  $1000 for a bottle of vodka!!!  WTF?!!!

Again, this is not the Vegas that I know, so the outrageous prices for the bottles blew my mind.  Accompanying the bottles is a constantly replenishing set of mixers (OJ, cranberry, tonic, pineapple, etc) and ice brought by very attentive staff who are dedicated to your cabana.  

The food and bottled waters were average normally priced.  I.e. a chicken quesadilla is around $10 to $12.  A burger is around the same.  We all got food early on when we arrived around 11am and the food was good.

Now let's talk about the reason why you come to one of these places: the pool.  I will say, having been to Ditch Friday and Rehab (the next day), Encore easily has the best ""scenery.""  The pool is not huge, but they don't stuff lots of people into the beach club like they do at Rehab.  I don't know how they maintain ""scenery"" control, but they do a good job.  Lining the pool are bars, cabanas (some with private pools with a glass wall that faces the main pool), a grill, and a bunch of chairs/lounging furniture.  One of my friends there bought two vodka tonics at the pool bar and paid $60!!! $60!!!!  I'm so cheap.

The club closes down at about 6 or 7pm, so you can be there for a good 6 to 7 hours, but they keep it bumping the whole time.

Summary: Great staff.  Good food at decent prices.  Great beach club ""scenery"".  DJ is good.  Cabanas are nice and amenity-filled, but bottles are $1000 each.  Prepare to spend a lot of money on alcohol. Period.  Will never go back there probably because it's just not worth it to me, but they do a good job with making the club fun for the guests.",mrPUDzaxNQDc-JXG3JmuFw,2,0,4,qIZ7Vki3PO2931muG4N_8A

They informed me that the negotiation down to a $2,000 minimum for my table made up for the $500 we spent on tickets, which was not the deal. We were at all times told that this would be separate. This is pretty pathetic service that I would not expect to receive from any Wynn hotel, particularly the Encore. I am in shock at the lies being told to us and the hoops they are making my friends and me jump through to get out hard earned money back. I don't think I can return to an establishment that scams its customers like this again. See full story below


This place scammed my friends and me. They offered us a table for $2,000, and when we asked if they would credit our ticket purchases of $500 (four at $125), we were told that the money would be refunded to us instead of a creditif we called the club after with the receipt information on hand. When we called, they told us they didn't do that, and were unwilling to refund us the money. 

This is not the level of service I've come to expect from Wynn resorts, and the Encore resort in particular. This was very crooked behavior on behalf of the club, and just downright low because we ended up spending well over $2K at the table.",3fF0_WKBp30qkhRS84kzJA,6,2,1,0abzaZs_NwmDGDbbbU2Gdg

So, this place packed, like usual Vegas day clubs. Everyone around us were laughing, filled with energy, and it definitely rubbed off on us. We could not wait to get inside. However, all of this happiness and excitement changed when a security personnel, aka rent a cop, decided to give one of our friends a hard time. I didn't catch his name, but saw the letter ""G"" on his tag. This guy was definitely on a powertrip, we didn't know what his deal was and why he felt the need to overly harass our friend. He was not quiet about it either, the crowd around us also felt very uncomfortable. He killed our vibe, not cool.

After the harassment was over, which seemed like forever, my boyfriend was greeted with a very thorough ""TSA"" style search. I don't know why, he was half naked and only has one pocket on his shorts. However, my girlfriend and I got in relatively harassment free.

We tried to ignore what happened and went to the bar for some drinks. Omg, $20 for a half a solo cup of a mixed girly vodka drink! This place just keeps letting us down.

The crowd here... very ""ghetto"". We had people walking all into us, not even saying, ""excuse me"". On top of that, there's no shade, and it was extremely crowded. The water...its cloudy and kind of warm. Don't get that stuff in your mouth. We had an okay time I guess...

Then, right when we were about to leave for EDC, guess who showed up...Alesso!!! He was amazing, my favorite DJ, but...everyone just kind of rushed the stage. We had a very tall guy in front of us, flailing his arms everywhere. Again, killed our vibe. Definitely no sense of ""PLUR"" here.

Will we return? Probably not. I was pretty annoyed here, and it's a pool party in Vegas where temperatures were over 105 degrees. Thank goodness EDC was that night.",C_Y5dfZgHpFzBrnWTNj0KQ,4,1,2,gVfMQk93OdgXLKq7d5usvQ

I went and saw Steven Angelo! It was awesome! I love being able to dance in the pool. Theres room for everyone in the pool! It's not as small as Marquee's day club. :).

The drinks are decent! Sometimes there are bottomless mimosas for girls (free until a certain time) :). It depends on the day though.

I also went in early April and there were no DJs performing... It was just okay. I definitely recommend only coming when there's a DJ performing (which is all the time since it's summer!) Don't come when it opens for the season haha.

Another big benefit to this pool is many of their daybeds are actually in the water or even have their own personal small pools. 

There are several bars scattered through the place.  They all made great mohitos. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes even though it was packed.  They have a very nice bag check for $10 that you can go to as much as you want (at Daylight they wanted $40 for a small locker).

Don't worry about having to walk through the casino because the day club entrance is right outside of the parking structure.

There's ground level and 2nd floor cabanas. Half naked people everywhere. It's some ratchetness but it's fun. There were even gaming tables by one of the bars. Skrillex was playing when I was here. 

Drinks are ridiculously expensive. My friend ordered 2 vodka sodas and a margarita and wasn't sure how much the bartender said the tab was. ""Did she say 57 or 27?"" She asked the bartender again.

Got here around 1200 pm and the line was ridiculous. We told them we had a reservation but told us to get in line. Like I said before, I dont do lines. Went to the front, dropped a name and whats this? the ropes opens up and we are in :D

There are beautiful people all around and the atmosphere is pretty chill compared to Wet. Security is really on top of their game about guys getting onto the stripper pole, why the hate security, maybe guys just want to take a shower there!  Once Kaskade came on, the place went bonkers.

I highly recommend to make reservations for a chair/couch/daybed etc since cover for people not in the know is $30 for women and $50 for men.  When FB mins are as low as $150, why not make a chair reservation?

I'll start off by saying that I had a few connections so my review is a little scewed, but I think its still accurate. My boy Jay Shaun  at the door hooked us up with a day bed for half the minimum tab we were suppose to run, Sweet. I just took care of him. The day bed can comfortably fit anywhere from 4-6 people. We were suppose to get a day bed and a Lily pad but I tried to show up fashionably late so Some high roller paid 10k for my 1k Lilypad, silly rabbit. Anyway if your going to reserve a spot, and want to be close to the action get a Lilly pad, Its like having a bed right in the water. 

Pros: Great scene, great music, clean pool, lay out of the pool was top notch, people were classy and seemed a little more upscale, think Marriot Vs. The 4 Seasons Hotel, when compared to other pool parties. 

Cons: Drink were pricey, and very weak. We ordered Mojito Pitchers all day (85 a pop) and it tasted like they put about 3-4 shots in the whole thing. 

Overall I love it, its a good time for girls and guys alike, enough candy to go around. Also they have gambling too if you want to literally lose your shorts off, lol.

There's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good. 
Just grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music. 

If you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men. But generally, girls get in for $30 if you can't get in for the promotion price.

Oh, and if you're worried about fitting your lunch plans prior to pool time, they have a grill there that serves food.

Drinks are fairly expensive, as they regularly are in Las Vegas clubs.

The only thing to complain: I know the pools are heated, but the water is slightly too warm for the amount of people, which makes me think that the water is warm for other reasons :(

But I definitely would do this again on my next trip(s),

Unfortunately in this review I can tell you nothing about the pool party. There was no way that bald headed punk bouncer Don was going to let three mexicans in even though we were literally standing in the front of the line for over an hour. 

His excuse was the ratio was not what it needs to be. As the minutes passed we saw Don let in countless guys without ladies (all white not that I am implying anything) as well as huge groups of ladies. 

Don must of missed the chapter on ratios because there were plenty more girls then guys. An hour later we are still invisible to that little coochie. In the end he said it is to difficult to let three guys in with no ladies. 

So unless you are a jersey shore cast member or your skin is just the right color don't bother coming to this place.

EBC enforces an awesome party and they know how to do it well.   The venue is large and spacious - they have cabanas both upstairs and downstairs (although you miss all of the action if you're upstairs...) and all of the daybeds/couches are evenly spaced from each other.  They bring in big name DJs (we were just there recently on 6/21 for Kaskade) and the girl/guy ratio is pretty even, if not more girls!  The table service is the best that I've ever experienced in Vegas - their cocktail servers are friendly (our server mixed a drink and brought it out to the pool to me!), their cocktails are delicious (cucumber water is a must - you can't even taste the alcohol in it!), they had a mini birthday celebration for my fiance, and everybody in our group had a great time!

2980557,2017-06-25,12,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Yo! It's that time of year for a Vegas pool party, and you're like, ""What the hell do I expect?  What do I wear?"" Here it is, start to finish, including tips on how to prevent the worst hangover of your life. Save yourself from that blackout until 4AM the next day, wondering why you've got ketchup between your toes and underpants on your head... wait, what do you mean those aren't yours?

First off... Please DON'T EVER PAY to get into a club without first asking a promoter if you can get in for free!!!  Text Jessica at 702.544.1057, and you might even be able to score some free drink tickets for the ladies. 

Okay next... biggest, baddest pool parties in Vegas are going to be EBC and Wet Republic. I'm personally an EBC fan because the vibe is awesome, the place is beautiful, and the staff at any Wynn property club is always going to treat you with more dignity than the staff at a Hakkasan club.

- What do I wear? Dudes wear swim trunks. Some girls will show up SUPER fancy in wedged heels, perfect hair, and perfect night club makeup. You can also just show up in flip flops and a cute swimsuit, but most people turn it into a fashion opportunity.
**I highly recommend bringing sunglasses and a hat with you, whether snapback or IG vacation-style hat. Don't forget your sunscreen and a cover up. 

- Parking: Free. Park at the *Wynn* parking garage for the shortest transit to the outside walkway. If traipsing butt ass naked through a hotel is your thing, park at the Encore garage.

- Waiting in line: Guest list line can get longgggggg. Honestly, I'd show up before noon just to avoid this, but I'm also impatient AF. You'd rather show up earlier and be drinking inside than waiting in a line when it's 115 degrees, right? 

- Bag check: If you're thinking about packing your birth control pills, Scooby snacks, or other shenanigans, brace yourself. EBC does the most thorough search of any club I've been to in Vegas. They'll check your chapstick, throw out opened packs of gum, etc. Nightswim (same location) is no different.

- Where do I put my stuff? If you are a total commoner like me and not getting a cabana with bottle service, you can check your stuff, but you don't get access to it after that. It's less than $20, but try to consolidate the group's stuff into one bag to save money! 

- Drinks: It's a 5-star hotel in Vegas. A mixed drink is going to be $16-20. If the tables are open, go throw down some $15 hands of blackjack and order yourself a few FREE drinks that way. Drinks while gambling are FREE. (You can tip cocktail ladies in chips or cash, of course.)

TIPS: 
- Buy a waterproof phone holder for like $7 so you can throw your phone, credit card, and ID in there. Girls everywhere will be panicking over a lost credit card that fell out of their swim suit about four cherry vodka sours ago.
- ****DRINK FREE WATER. Save your damn cup, and go to the bathroom by the back where they have water fountains. This will be a crucial lifeline to protecting you from the worst hangover of your life. Vegas sun shows no mercy.
- Vegas pool parties are kind of disgusting, but do you really care anymore when you're lit and jamming out? (Nope.) There's about 20,000 gallons of piss in that pool, and the dirty water gets squeegeed back into the pool to make it extra juicy! So please don't ever put your head in the water. Now that you've got that visual, I promise you'll have an excellent time! 
- Don't splash. You'll get your ass kicked by the pool cops since you're throwing piss into everyone's face.
- Towels are provided.
- Please make sure to tip the wonderful people working as bathroom attendants. They deal with a lot of... shit... at these things. People tend to go really hard and get messed up badly from severe dehydration. 
- I wouldn't ever recommend planning a day club + night club on the same day. 95% of people don't make it since they get too messed up from the day club. I'd do a night club on Day 1, day club the next morning.

Once again, major perks to be a girl!! FREEEEEE for us!! We bypassed the line with ease and got into the club within minutes.

This place is beautiful and glamorous.  I love the bright orange,red,yellow colors that Mr. Wynn designed with.  2 stories full of Cabanas and day beds available.  Some cabanas come with a back view.  If you aren't splurging on these bad boys, have no fear!  You can sit along the side of the pool! Drinks here are around $15 and up.  For some reason, Wet Republic's drinks were more worth it. (alcohol content-wise). I had several of their drinks, and some of them tasted like no alcohol was mixed in.  The Strawberry margarita,  margarita on the rocks, and watermelon drinks, which were tasty and refreshing.  The vibe here is definitely different from Wet Republic.  It is more chill but at the same time a good relaxing time.  All you keep doing is looking at all these hot bodies passing by you.  It's ridiculous! One girl sprained her ankle and had it wrapped but still pushed herself to wear heels!! The things people do to look hot for one day!

The grill, for quick food, is available at the end of the club.  Spacious bars were available.  The service is quick and enjoyable.

My girlfriend and I came here sunday of memorial weekend because we love Kaskade so there's nothing better than to check out the new pool and enjoy great music. We came around noon-ish there wasn't much of a line yet, but being two girls it wasn't hard to get pulled out and shuttled in. 

As soon as you walk in it's as impressive an entrance as walking into XS. It looks like an oasis. Like previous entries there are sophisticated dancing poles lol with water raining down them there are about 3 of them at the entrance, middle and at the other end. When you walk in they hand you a towel right away and offer to walk it to your destination!! I like that kind of service although we did deny lol. There aren't any beach chairs that take up unnecessary room there are are beds both in the pool and outside of it. There is a second story with cabana rooms similar to XS and for once I wouldn't want to be located there away from the pool and the wonderful sun. 

There is 3 pools but it looks like one big one but has 2 walkways so you can check out what's going on and cut through to the other side. Ohh and most importantly the pools are heated so no worries on headlights and shrinkage, can't ask for anymore than that!! One side of the pool is where the DJ is located and the other is where you can gamble etc. 

Anyway, back to the main point I dunno how they managed it but seriously I have never been to a place where it was a ratio of 90% beautiful people, 8% normal and 2% uglies. The day we came could really give a girl a complex whether it was about lack of 'twins', tummy isn't flat enough or the bikini was covering too much skin! My girlfriend and I ogled at both guys and girls lol. It was fun and definitely the fest for the eyes! Management I love how you let people in you did a great job! And to note they didn't pack this place it was full but not crowded or uncomfortable. My friends came here at 4pm and the doors were closed they were no longer letting anyone else in. Ohh and there is re-entry here like at XS. 

The music was fabulous of course,  dancing in the pool and enjoying the sun is my idea of a great time!! This is the best pool party I have been to, it totally redefines my expectations of pool parties!! I will be coming back here as often as I'm in Vegas this summer which I hope to be at least 2x a month this summer!! 

Ohhh btw, I had a great watermelon margarita make sure to try it!! And they had a stoli blueberry lemonade that looked yummy but never made it to the bar to order it.

All my friends thought this was just XS opened during the day no it isn't it's a whole new other place and XS is still closed during the day just in case you were curious.

It was soo crowded inside, took awhile just to find a spot to put our stuff down. I recommend if youre gonna go here (or tao beach/wetrepublic) try to bring as little as possible with you. its more convenient and safer for your belongings.

Prob wouldnt have had that good of a time if we didn't get invited to a table. the guys werent very cute but you dont have to ask me twice to sit at your table and drink your drinks, I am happy to oblige.

water felt great because it was soooo hot. music couldve been better, less house and more hip hop please.

it was fun to sit in the water and people watch too cause drunk middle aged white people are funny. the crowd is a little less guido/fake tan/fake tits than the crowd I saw at wet republic.

If you are looking to have some fun during the day in Vegas, you will not be disappointed if you end up here. It is a target rich environment for both sexes. 

My friends and I got a poolside couch. We were a party of 6 dudes, so it seemed like the best way to get in. I believe we had to order three bottles, and our bill came to maybe $300 a piece. It was well worth it. Our feet were basically in the water the whole time, we had great views of the entire club, a smoking hot waitress keeping our drinks full, and a very cool security guard looking out for us. 

The scenery was unreal, the music was good, a couple of celebrity sightings (if you are into that, I'm not, but they were there) and the warm sun, and the day just got better as it went on. 

My only negative comment would be that they charge $30 for sunscreen, so bring your own. You will cook in that hot Las Vegas sun if you forget your sunscreen and refuse to buy theirs.",FPggU_u2Es0YOTNM_8Xucg,1,0,5,rrE_81yNiZnO36I3SzZgYA

What on God's green earth can I possibly say about EBC that hasn't already been said about two dozen times?? Nothing, I am not that eloquent to come up with anything new. Huge area, amazing guest performers, drinks are expensive, pool can get murky, yada yada yada. I am, however, adequately outfitted to give some tips. Get on a promoter's list. You don't need to be built like Barbie to make this happen... be friendly, take a little pride in your appearance, but above all things, if you look like you're enjoying yourself people will want you to party with them. But yes, being a group of all girls is helpful. Once you're in, check anything that you don't want to lug around... it's $10, people. Worth it to not get your things stolen (which we actually saw happen in one of the bungalows, regardless of having a safe... leading to the advice to not invite actual strippers to your bungalow, gentlemen! Newsflash.... they don't actually like you! LOL sorrynotsorry). Another item: it's always a good rule of thumb to pregame, but try to add a few waters in there too... do you really want to be one THOSE people getting wheeled out of there? No one does.
Long story short, it is what you make of it. Come with people you can have a great time with, be it in the pool, in front of the DJ booth (DIPLO ftw) or in your new friends' cabana... and a great time you shall have. :)

3076264,2017-08-08,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Is it expensive for a drink? Yes.
 
If you get a table is it expensive? Yes. But you're getting a table, so you're not THAT worried about money if you're going that route (which I didn't). You can a pitcher of cocktail and it'll run $100. 

Are the lines long? Yes if you go with a promoter and you get there late after the time they told you to get there. If it's the day party, and your promoter tells you to get there by 10 a.m., they mean it.

Is it fun as all hell? YES. I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy it, but what's not to like about dancing in a pool during the day with a bevvy (albeit overpriced drink) in hand? 

My group was actually leaving after we saw the line at 11:30 a.m. but as we were leaving one of the main club manager's said ""we were missing out on the best day party"" and when we told him it wasn't worth the wait, and we started chatting about how I had a preggo cousin in tow from Australia nonetheless (true story) -- we found ourselves accessing the club from inside the casino. Yay! Once inside, we had a blast. Diplo was supposed to come on but we were there until 3:30 p.m. and he still hadn't come up. 

We were able to put our small purse next to a lifeguard stand and stayed there the rest of the afternoon. 

***NIGHT PARTY***
We came back that same day for night swim thanks to promoter Kenneth C. We joined a couple of other ladies where we had a bed/seating. It was nice to be able to sit! 

The house DJ was on fire that Saturday night!! I loved his mix of old school r&b. 

AND THEN MARSHMELLO was the featured DJ that night. I had never even heard of him until that night. He is fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed his set.

I now prefer day-clubs over nightclubs largely b/c of this place.

You just don't know until you've been there.  

Buy tickets early or cover goes up to $100 for dudes...and tickets still sell out.  Also get there EARLY.  If ""guy"" tickets have sold out, keep checking back b/c sometimes they temporarily suspend guy ticket-sales until the ratio of sold tix evens out.

I'd recommend a long night of fun and chillin' spent here, way over a loud, congested, sticky floored night club. Then again it's best on a warm summer or autumn night. Hopefully next year I'll make it back for another vendor event.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,26,30,4,XSvSGN7ds83zFN_GTXcY9g

My favorite is the lily pads which are like little beds by the water.  The usually let you get 10-12 people in under your table and mins are normally $1500 or so depending on when you go.  Vegas prices have risen exponentially over the past few years but its not just EBC its pretty across the board with all clubs.  Bottles are now around $800 plus additional fees and grat.  Its getting pretty ridiculous out there but its Vegas soooooo.  The food they can bring you out goes towards your min which is nice.

Round 1 - We booked our spot weeks prior -- specifically asking for a shaded spot. I have a history of skin cancer and this was addressed with them. We showed up and had a shaded spot for about 20 minutes until the sun shifted. We asked the staff to move an umbrella. (Note that said umbrella very much had the capacity to be moved and would have only helped everyone around us.) The staff refused and said it was against policy. I told them I asked for a shady spot initially and the staff could have cared less. Mind you, it is August so when the place is fully equipped with misters that would only cool everyone down in a 105 temp, why wouldn't you put them on? 105 seems to scream out ""mister time"" to me. 

Round two -- they force you to get a bottle at a table which is fine, but they push you and push you to make your bottle order so they don't have to go back and forth with you from your table to the bar. If I am paying $1,500 for 2 people to have a table so you can fetch a handful of pitchers for the two of us. Also, the bottle we did get was $700 (which showed up 1.5 hours after we ordered it). When we went to Marquee two days prior that same bottle was $395. SMH. 

The service was terrible. We were probably the most lowest maintenance table and we felt like we were putting them out for the 2 of us. Essentially, they seemed very understaffed especially having a headliner like Chainsmokers.

My boyfriend decided to have my birthday party at Encore for Cinco de Mayo weekend. We got a fabulous King Size daybed right alongside the pool. Our waitress was not only hot but super sweet and all of the employees were so attentive and served us hand and foot. They ensured that when were were at the pool, our stuff was secure. We were never without a drink in our hands and the food was delicious. I had the steak salad as I was trying not to get too bloated with food....but people in my party ordered nachos, quesadillas, sliders, fries etc and it was all very good and filling. 

I heard the daybeds run anywhere between 1000.00-1500.00. It depends on the location of the bed and of course the day you go. We had the choice of getting a lilly pad right inside the pool but you cant order food there so the host recommended the daybed and it couldn't have been more perfect! We managed to get it for $450.00 which was insane bc we had a party of 10 (6boys, 4 girls). It included front of the line passes, entry, and we just had to ensure we spent minimum of $450.00 in drinks and food which was not so difficult at all! We ended up staying there all day and having TOO much fun so we racked up the bill pretty fast and reached 1200.00 in drinks. The waitress was so great that we decided to tip her a nice chunk of change but she wouldn't accept it. She said that it was too much and she just couldn't. I thought that was really sweet of her. 

ALL IN ALL- Encore Beach is NOT ridiculously crowded. You have plenty of room to walk, dance, and just breathe. The place is filled with good looking classy people. The music is great too. That day Calvin Harris was playing and he was so great. He really pumped up the crowd!
I honestly had the time of my life!!!! The service is unmatched by very good looking people.

Get there and no more drink tickets...okay whatever right? I figure it's free anyway so why not check it out. The line took forever first of all. Then they made me throw away my gum and my allergy medicine. Or the other option was to pay like $25 to check it in. My friend really wanted to go in so I just agreed for them to confiscate it. We got in and all the seats were reserved. We got hungry and got loaded fries for $24. That's right. Fries with some cheap cheese and chicken on them. We were starving so me decided to get them anyway. Then guess what? All the seats were reserved ans we had nowhere to eat them. We had to stand while eating our $24 shitty fries. We ended up going by the trash can area to set our plate down for a second to get napkins a and stuff. A worker comes up and says we can't eat by the trash can within seconds of us getting there. We ask another worker where we can eat our food. They say ""any non reserved area."" We say there aren't any. He shrugs and says sorry. He then proceeds to point at a table where people are standing and suggests to wait for that one to open up. 

I get it that we got in for free but I would be happy to have paid for a better experience. We were so annoyed we had wasted money on the terrible fries and had our stuff confiscated all over nothing. We ended up leaving and going to a different beach club where we had an absolute blast!

One of my friends was told by a man named Timothy that he needed to return with proper swim trunks, and that upon our return we could go to the front of the line and be let in immediately. He agreed and headed all the way back to the other end of the strip to our room at the Excalibur to change shorts while I got back in line. As soon as I got past the red rope, the same man, Timothy, motioned me to get out of the line and - after just guaranteeing my group and I entrance 5 minutes prior - told me to get out, that we were not welcome, and that he had never promised us anything. After my friends and I returned an hour later with the correct attire, we spoke to numerous management officials who all authorized our entry into the club only to be mistreated and embarassed again and physically pulled out of the line by a different employee just before showing our tickets. We were ultimately turned away and were basically told that the staff has the right to disrespect any guest because it is private property no matter the circumstances.

*HOT BITCHES - They were everywhere and they were abundant. Tanned, fit, and beautiful. Yes, every single one of them.

*KASKADE - One of my favorite DJ's in the world and he was phenomenal. Loved the DJ podium. Accessible and close to the audience.

*GOOD FOOD - The chicken nachos and chicken tenders from the Grill were both good. Better than most of the other pool establishments. And yes, very pricey. The wait was 30 minutes.

CONS:  You need to be cashed up to go here.  Entrance fee is high, and drinks are expensive.  We had bud light the whole time.  For about $25 a pop.  

Also, this must be a challenge with having vegas clubs that people from all over the country attend: in a way its a pretty random mix of people.  Was also surprised that 80%-90% of the attendees were hispanic or asian, which is fine, if you're into that.  

Towards the end somebody got the idea to throw a bunch of dollar bills up in the air all over the place.  Fun to see how a bunch of drunks chase them.

Came here to see Steve Angello on Saturday. Arrived around 11am and there was a short 10 minute wait to get in. Very organized! 

We had bottle service for a group of 6 people (4 guys, 2 girls) and did 4 pre-sale female tickets. The service was great! There was a bit of wait time when it got busy, but that's completely understandable. I swear, they must have changed our ice every 20-30 mins and our mixers were always topped off. I was thoroughly impressed.

What I really enjoy about this venue is the ambiance. It's large, beautiful, and you can actually enjoy the pool. I never had to wait in line at the restrooms, bar lines were decent, prices were average for any place in Vegas, and they had a grill window that served lunch food, which was also pretty good for the price.

Music was heard well throughout the venue. The dance area in front of the dj is small, but you really don't even need to be near there to get good sound. In fact, it was a bit TOO loud near the dj booth, so I'd suggest taking your drink to the pool instead.

Lastly, the waitresses and waiters are GORGEOUS! I've never seen so many great looking people working in one dayclub before. Definitely a great spot to scope out eye candy!

Our promoter Anthony Khotsikian was excellent. He came by our table to make sure everything was okay. Table service was definitely worth the money we put down.

I appreciated the various water stations, fans, and ample shade while we were waiting, as it was incredibly hot. I would recommend getting here even earlier, at least on busy days like Saturdays.

If you have cigarettes, vapes, pain pills, gum etc. - don't bring them. I saw a lot of these getting confiscated at the entrance/security. They search your bags and pockets. 

Once you're in, it's pretty packed. There's rental lockers if you need to put away your things, but most people seemed to bring their things near the pool. I would just make sure to stay nearby so you can keep an eye on it. There's umbrellas/some shade, but you need to stand. Only those who rent the cabanas get to sit on the couches. There are also some areas in the pool where you can sit, but it can get pretty packed.

The energy and vibe here is pretty fun, everyone is laughing and having a good time. The music is top 40/EDM remixes. 

I would probably come back, especially since there is free parking. I can't really comment on the prices since I didn't spend any money, but I assume it's pricey. If you're a girl, definitely get on the guest list for free admission!",37GTo06k6YUmjRgBqVaZBw,1,1,4,tsN2aXBiJk_7slQz9SfQZQ

I like how there was an option to dance either in the pool or on land closer to the DJ. There was also a lot of space to dance or walk around! We danced close to the stage and got to see Diplo's beautiful face, I believe we were in his snapchat also.

Drinks will run you about $20 bucks a pop so get a pitcher of Mojito or a bucket of beers if you aren't dropping money on a Cabana.  The Cabanas were full of a whole bunch of old Italian mafia guys.  That was kind of creepy.  The scene was pretty wild but full of a much of meat heats and fake women but what else do you expect in Vegas.  

A few notes:

*  Pay someone to skip the line.  $20 to $30 bucks per dude should do the trick.  Absolutely worth it even if you have a ticket
*  Purchase a ticket a few weeks in advance if you can.  It can save you $50 bucks or more if you wait until day of
*  Double fist.  Lines for drinks are crazy long so you want to minimize bar runs
*  Post the leaving the beach club go to the Wynn to catch a cab.  The impromptu cab line they make for the Beach club is stupid long and has very little cabs waiting

It is visually stimulating in every way possible - from the décor, to the people, to the overall vibe.  For those who have never been to a day club in Vegas, OMG it is so much fun!!!  I've never had a bad time at Encore Beach Club.   It's a pretty sizable space, with great artists performing all the time, and the scene and clientele are just delicious.  Ladies usually get in for free if you are A) on a guestlist or B) get there early enough or C) y'all just look damn HOT!  Guys, unfortunately, do have to pay (I think most of the time), and it can be as much as $100 per person.  Might be a good idea to get a cabana?  Of course, it is a given that drink prices can be quite steep, but it's Vegas afterall.  On the bright side, the pours are pretty heavy so you get the best bang for the buck.   
 
To answer some simple questions I've heard:
 
-Yes, it's a pool party, but people don't swim here.  It's 3.5 feet of water or something.. and usually super packed.  You drink and you dance and you flirt.  That's the premise.
-Looking for a chill place to just bask in the sun by the pool?  No, this is not your place.  You can bask in cabanas, but it's a day club, so there will be loud music, and maybe even some foam.  It is not the place to relax and take a nap.
-Lastly, yes you should still look cute here.  This ain't your neighborhood pool.  Dress to the nines, people!

(plus its against the law for them to have anyone sign anything under the influence) when we refused to sign the paper they called 20 more security guards and even the owner came up. keep in mind were all calm and confused. when the security guards came they just started pushing yelling shoving it was humiliating. i have the whole thing on video and the more i watch it the more i regret not pressing any charges. the security guards were 19 male and 1 female and the male guards were pushing us women around but at the same time they want us to pay the fee and they wont let us leave. at one point they threw my brother down and pulled off his diamond cross from his neck i had to run and grab it because they were trying to steal it. this was a nightmare i couldn't believe what was happening. i cant say all the guards but most were assholes. our phones were stolen our lv sunglasses were taken we had a missing watch. they gave us no time to take any of our belongings. they arrested 5 of the guys (which they released earlier because metro showed up and couldn't understand why they arrested them in the first place)... long story short we paid the fee which i regret till this day. turns out they do this often its like a setup they corner you. they arrest you make you pay a ticket along with the nice fat bill and they still kick you out and they rent out the place again within ten minutes for another $6,000..... i will never return here. i will never wear or take any expensive jewelry/accessories to any kind of club.

So I was ""Chasing Summers"" here last weekend, because what better way to visit Encore Beach Club than to see Tiesto perform?! 

Surrender nightclub at night, Encore Beach Club by day, what's not there to love about summertime in Vegas? Good party spot, good people and most definitely good music, this is one of those places that you need to party in when you're here. 

The club itself is quite large, with one HUGE pool full of half naked people boozing, schmoozing and having a good time. The party doesn't really get started till around 3PM, but even before that, it's pretty packed. Want a drink at the bar? Better get comfortable, because you're going to be waiting for a pretty long time. 

My main complaint is that getting a drink at the bar was a pain in the ass, since there were just way too many people and not enough bartenders to go around. I ended up double fisting it because I didn't want to keep going back to the bar for more drinks. At least the drinks were strong...really strong. Heh.

And really, where are the lockers? There were no places to drop our stuff off, so I ended up having wallets, tickets, credit cards, IDs and what-not stuffed in my purse, because I was the only person who brought one. Luckily, some people were nice enough to let us put our clothes under their cabana.

But besides those buzzkills, I had a great time partying here. There was plenty of room around the pool to stand, dance and sit and the music was just blasting with the bass down low. Tiesto was awesome, as expected, although I wished he played some of his older hits. But that's a different story. 

If you really want to make your daytime special, then this is a good place to visit. If you're looking for a quiet and relaxing place to tan by the pool, then this is not the place. People are here to party all day, everyday and then do it all again at night time!",AsUvXYx9ZVn3IMJmAIwhYw,3,1,4,Nv5MmU3m1iCLGil5Xmy4qw
3652197,2016-05-23,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Encore Beach Club is my first day club experience in Vegas and it was a blast! Before heading to the club, I thought I would be feeling rather self conscious of my body since I never attended a ""club"" in bikini wear before, but you instantly loose that feeling when you are there. The combination of the Vegas heat and seeing people in all shapes and sizes makes you stop caring. The dress code is obviously swimwear ( one piece, two piece, etc) for girls and you are allowed to wear cute coverups and shorts with your bikini. 

Don't forget your sunscreen even though the girls bathroom comes stocked with sunscreen/lotions/perfumes for use if you tip! I never seen any bathroom likes the ones in Vegas clubs before. They are like mini makeup counters where you can freshen up with the products they have laid out on the counter for a price. I wonder if the men's bathroom is the same way? 

Also, buy yourself a waterproof cell phone cover from Amazon if you want to bring your phone to the pool to take pictures. Those things are quite useful and they can even serve as your wallet to keep you credit cards/ID/cash. Ladies/Dudes, don't brings purses/wallets to the day club unless you have your own private cabana.Even though my friends and I have a couch and small basket tables for ourselves at the day club, it still didn't feel safe to leave our items out in the opening when we wanted to dance in the pool. We ended up stashing them under our basket tables and hoping they won't be jacked. 

Ladies, make sure you contact a promotor and see if you can get a free couch/day bed/drinks when you head to Encore. Freebies are always fun and no body wants to pay thousands for a table anyways. 

The music at Encore Beach Club is mainly EDM and it was great. My friends and I were a bit disappointed when we heard that Avicii canceled his event for the Saturday that we were going, but we still had fun jamming/dancing in the pool to the substitute Marshmello.

Got in, item check, and off we went! It was really nice, and Calvin Harris was performing that day. We overheard that their cabanas are 6k. I'm sorry but..holy fuckin shiz..that's ridiculous. They have these SMALL circle couches there as well, and that is 3k. And if you want to have a seat at the bar that's only yours...1k. RE-DONKULOUS. Sorry, I ain't ballin' like that. 

Anway, we make our way to the pool, and it felt good once you get in...but after sitting in there for a while, it's a little disgusting. It's just luke warm because of all the other people chillin. I felt a little uncomfy just standing in the water.

Chances are though, if you show up during the peak summer months you already know what to expect and you are drunk off your ass before getting here.  They usually have big name DJs who will play entire sets.  Definitely worth it if you have presale tickets, otherwise may not be worth the entrance fee (especially for guys).  Crowd is relatively diverse, a bit more Asians.

Love that they have tables in the confines, so you can keep throwing your money away.  Also love that the servers are all incredible eye candy.

Now the line was not long at all and instead of waking back to the casino we stepped under the ropes.

Price - $50 for guys, even if staying @ hotel. We got a cabana however. It was really nice with a big couch, safe, tv, and fan. There was a $4,000 minimum tab for the cabana, and only 10 people are allowed to have a bracelet allowing them in. You can bring friends or girls up to the cabana with you if you walk them up through security.

**FYI -- the cabana girls will try to UPSELL you. we ordered a bottle of tequila and they brought out the best (read: MOST EXPENSIVE) bottle and our thoughtless friend ok'd it without thinking.....it was $1,450!!!! As Napoleon Dynamite would say......idiot....god!!

The scene at the pool was good, plenty of attractive women for the eyes to enjoy, not a trashy scene like some pool parties are. 

On a bad note there were a whole bunch of Joey Boombatzs and Paulie Guidos who looked like they were in the locker room with McGwire and Sosa in '98 shootin up the roids.

Other than the loud club music, there's not much difference between a ""beach club"" and a regular hotel pool. Except you actually have lounge chairs to place your stuff and sit in, while at a beach club, you can only do that if you buy a table/bottle service, which is dumb imo.  If I had to choose, I'd pick a plastic lounge chair + book + personal iPod, over loud club music + lounge couches + stripper poles in the middle of the pool to dance on.

Tables start off at $300, reaching up to $1800 for a cabana, which the club suggested we get since we had 8 people.  $1800 for a cabana LOL do we look like we're made out of money??

3749812,2011-09-19,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"We enjoyed our first day of LDW 2011 at this pool. I previously had only seen the club at night and it's pretty amazing!! I love the red theme the hotel carries throughout the entire resort.

It has a modern vibe and definitely one of the nicest of the larger pool complexes in Las Vegas. We didn't get a bed or a cabana and during large events that can be extremely frustrating. There is really nowhere to put your belongings or sit down other than in the pool. Someone needs to be watching your stuff at all times, as there is always crowds of drunk people walking around the pool. Not exactly carefree partying in my mind.

We didn't have to wait in line as we were on a list, but if you aren't getting a bed or a cabana which require you to be there early, it seemed pretty easy after 1pm to get right in. Not sure if it's as simple for both men and women. Sorry guys usually have to pay and it's always harder to get in unless you know someone.

The music  by DJ Steve Angello during LDW was incredible, but I recall it being good in the night club too. The only drawback is not enough bar tenders during peak hours. On several occasions it was a battlefield to get to the bar and the wait was at least 20 mins or more. Talk about buzz kill. I recall the bars on the west side of the pool were faster and less crowded, but who knows if that's the norm.

The only saving grace while waiting at the bar is people watching. It's amazing to see what some people will do thinking no one is really paying attention to them. Not sure whether is pathetic or funny. 

Another kind of irritating thing is I don't think we ever saw one server come up to our group the entire time. Can't blame them if they are working a private cabana or bed, but there should still be some roaming servers. We did get some free Heineken beers. They must have been sponsoring the event that day.

Beware it does get extremely crowded. Which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Definitely, save your pennies because drinks are super super expensive!!! Expect to pay about $16 for cocktails and about $10 for beers. It's Vegas and that's normal at most of the nicer pools. I draw the line at $15 dollars for one shot of premium liquor. That is a joke!

Would I go to another party at Encore for sure if we had a cabana, but I much prefer the service and the scene at the Encore Euro pool in the late afternoon.  The music is just as upbeat and there are far fewer drunken musclebound or bimbo idiots parading around the pool like they are hot sh*t!

3778919,2017-08-06,20,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Things have changed, and not for the better.

I've been coming here since the day this place opened many years ago. I used to recommend this place to all my friends whenever they're in town. The day cup and the nightclub used to be the coolest thing. Recently I had some friends in town who wanted to party here for the day clubbing.

Sadly, the whole experience was very mediocre. We had gotten one of the most expensive bungalows so we could be comfortable and have drinks and food and some privacy. We arrived a little late and the bouncers at the front entrance still gave us some hassle. 

The whole place was completely packed to the brim and we had a hard time trying to dodge people in order to get to our bungalow. The pool water looks really disgusting, very cloudy and full of drunk people. Of course it's no fault of the club's. Our servers were very nice in addition to being pretty hot. The cleaning crew was sweeping the floor as things are dropped, but they never came to clean the bathroom and as time went on our bathroom got really disgusting. We did have a rather large cabinet and a safe in our bungalow to lock up our wallets phones etc. and there is an outside patio area that was shaded with nice cushy seats for us to hang out. We had our own small private pool that is shared with the bungalow next to us.

The music was great! However one of our friends got kicked out for smoking a vapor, yet the club allows cigarettes which is way more disgusting. After a couple of hours we decided to leave. We made the mistake of leaving our hotel key in our room, since our friends were back in the room. Because of this they wouldn't let us back into the building. And we had to walk a mile all around the perimeter of the hotel outside in 120° heat to enter through the lobby and then walk all through the casino to get to our room. 

Honestly it's such a hassle to party here that it's not really worth it! Especially when it costs an arm and a leg.",8ZryN_S-n48g6rsa3W3QtQ,27,21,2,wQ9RQRCsFlUFIbSv3C-oGQ

3800897,2018-05-19,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"My first time being in a beach club and I had no idea what to expect.  My bf and I were first in line because I wanted to make sure that we got a place to sit (I anticipated that this place would get super packed) and a locker to store our essential personal items.  

Things to note.. 
1) Renting a locker cost $75.  Alesso was the dj that day so the prices must've been jacked up.  Needless to say, this was worth the money because once the place gets packed with hundreds of people, it's tough to find your things and having a place to store your wallet, cellphone, change of clothes, and other items was worth the peace of mind.  
2) Even though it does not say it on the prohibited list of items.. DO NOT bring sunblock lotion.  They will confiscate it.  You are allowed the sprays though.  Additionally, if you forget to bring or get yours confiscated.. you can always buy some from the towel window or go to the bathroom and use the items in there, just make sure to tip the person 1 or 2 dollars.  
3) As expected, drinks and food are super expensive.  You're not allowed to bring anything in and there is no re-entry once you're in, so if you're going to be hanging around the pool for hours, you are bound to get hungry.  We got a hamburger, chicken fingers, and a gatorade.  Total cost: $55.  That's like one entry to a buffet?!?  Drinks on the other hand.. $65.  What?!? And the most expensive alcohol they have is like SKYY Vodka.  Good for them for really making money!  Although they are a bit heavy handed with their drinks.  I personally cannot drink alcohol if I can taste it and so to me, it tasted like drinking gasoline but everyone else around me seemed to enjoy it.
4) Seating.  I would highly recommend getting a table or a cabana with shade if you are in a big group.  The cheapest table is like $1.5K but it includes alcohol.. so if you divide that up amongst 10 of you compared to the cost of the drinks.. it might be worth the money.  Plus you have a set place to keep your stuff.   If you are like us who came just as a couple so $1.5K is just a ridiculous price to pay for two people, there are places to sit around the palm trees.  Just know that It gets so hot and there is not a lot of shade.  We were able to find a place to sit but unfortunately through the day we lost our shade and it just got hot.  We ended up spending most of the time in the pool.  
5) There's no schedule of events.  We got there at 10:30, people thought Alesso would be on at 1pm, after 1- they said 3pm. He eventually started to dj sometime between 3:30 and 4:00pm.  
6) Security: I had both a good and bad experience with them.  First the good, they actually go in the water and make sure that people are ok.  Bad: My boyfriend lost his flip flops (or someone took them) in the midst of the hundreds of people there.  I miraculously found mine-- after someone had taken it at the beginning of the day.  We asked the staff where we could buy new ones, they directed us to the shops at the Wynn.  We ended up going to the Wynn and I felt really appalled at the security staff there.  Mind you I was completely sober, but because I happened to not be staying there during this time (I am a red card member), they literally blocked our entrance to come in because my boyfriend did not have slippers (which happened while we were on their property). I tried to explain the situation and I said I could go in to buy shoes/slippers for him and my bf could wait for me outside but they were really rude and condescending (and if you know me, it takes a lot to get me upset) and would not let me in either.  Never in my life have I experienced this type of professionalism or lack there of and being in a service profession I never would've treated anyone the way I was treated.    So if you don't stay at the actual hotel, expect the security staff to be less than pleasant with you.  This problem would've been avoided if the staff would've told us to go to the mall across the street instead of directing us to the Wynn.  
7) Atmosphere: It was really nice coming in and it was empty but by 1pm it's so so crowded that i takes a long time to get  out of the pool to get drinks or go to the bathroom, so I pretty much stayed in the pool unless I really had to get out.    Everyone's pretty nice and chill but once the drinks kick it, it gets a little crazy.  There were a group of guys that kept throwing stacks of cash in the water.  Also, i met a group of people who my bf and I hung out with who were really friendly and cool.  Also, don't get intimidated that it's a pool party because you'll be out and about in your swim wear. I know I was but everyone's out to have fun and once i let that go, i had fun.

Overall, would I do this again?  Ehhh.  It was probably a once in a lifetime thing, unless I get a big group of friends to go and we get table/cabana service. I would rather chill at the pool with friends and family and have a stereo playing in the background.",cMALU7n2M_RIpI_TPllvBA,5,0,2,XbI3I-S6WJys9zWvNzQXgg

Beautiful set-up. 2 different pools (that aren't attached, but super close together) There are cabanas and lounge areas, but of course you have to pay for those. 

The only downfall was there is basically no where to put your stuff. You always have to have someone watching your things/on patrol because you will have to leave it by a planter or something, unless you want it getting drenched poolside. Also, the places to sit & hang out are very limited. If you get their early you can snag a spot along the edge of the pool, if not....plan on finding a party to sit with, stand/sit in the pool or just dance around like no ones watching.

First of all, forget coming here as general admin. Seriously if you think about all the alcohol and food you will consume throughout the day, why not pool together on a couch with 4 others? A couch can fit 5 people, and I m sure $500 FB is very easy to blow through over the course of the day. Dave Pappas is the contact for all your EBC needs. Please pm me or Peter if you guys need the info. 

Now the pool party itself:  Kaskade Sundays is simply amazing. He pretty much tore the roof off, and I can not think of a better pool venue aside from Wet that is good for house DJs.  We got in a little later than normal because of check out day, but one of our buddies was able to hold our couch for us. The location was absolutely excellent. I believe it was (#503). This is right across the center stage dance floor and next to the gambling area.  Pretty much prime territory as far as location goes.

The service was absolutely outstanding. I couldn't help but notice that EBC has more staff working the pool venue than any other pool parties I have been to that weekend. There is also no room for shenanigans. If you are guy trying to get up on the water stripper pole, within seconds you will be warned and tossed out. Also there were sweepers all around the walk way areas drying off the floor so people won't slip.   Our waitress was also very friendly in answering our questions and delivering our orders accurately and on time.

To summarize everything, EBC is definitely focuses on the class factor of pool parties. I can quote Dave P that they don't welcome the steroid tatted out jersey shore style crowd. The party itself does have its moments, but even on a Kaskade Sunday, it's not as wild as Wet Republic.  I personally think this is a good change of pace. In Vegas we officially have a 1A (Wet Republic) and 1B (EBC) in pool parties, and I would go to either depending on what I m feeling that day.",nTcMFBHZV2vPnig0XLk-Hw,6,3,5,ctTIKBk0CAgoy2Ev5Zw7yg

I also got access to a cabana thanks to a good friend of mine, so I really didn't spend all that much money or deal with the ""crowds.""

$15 for a mixed drink is a bit steep in my opinion, as was the $15 for chicken strips and fries (which were fairly bland but hit the spot when I was wasted) but it's all relative, especially considering we didn't pay entrance or for the cabana.

The pool itself is pretty sweet and they had 2 stripper poles, both of which I went on but I can definitely admit I don't have the skills to pay the bills up on there...

The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.

I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)

So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:

There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???

The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.

If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.

Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.

Yes, It gets crazy packed! and No, you cannot swim in the water!  but it is not made for that!! If you are looking for a place to chill and relax by the pool, this is not your place!

Encore is merely an outdoor, daytime club with a strict dress code of swimwear only! They serve food and drinks which are both moderately priced and there is always a dj. The music is always Techno/house. I'm not a fan but I forget all about the music once I've had a couple of drinks. You need to arrive early to secure a place to sit if you haven't reserved a daybed or lounge chair. Girls are usually free if you get on the guest list (find a promoter) and as long as you arrive prior to the guest list closing, you will have no problem getting in.

I have never been to Rehab because the line is just wayyy toooo crazy. Fortunately, that is not the case at Encore Beach Club! For the most part, the wait is never unbearably long. Saturdays are the best days!",ZdkzBEMzY1DL4-snIRZThQ,3,1,5,IbLo5lVPETNf-RvWOjZyjA

We went through the guest list/general admission line. I bought my boyfriend's ticket online ahead of time ($35 + fees), so we moved along really quickly without a hiccup.

Their security check is quite thorough. They unzip every possible zipper in your bag to make you're not hiding anything. (They even unzipped and searched my wallet!) We had our empty Fat Tuesday bottles thrown out sadly. :(

We got a towel upon entrance then my friends and I put our stuff in the lockers that are offered for $10 each. The workers were good at judging what would fit in the lockers (since they put our stuff away for us) and we ended up fitting in about 2 medium sized bags each. (There's an option to try to fit whatever you can in a small black bag too.)

The place got crowded throughout the day, but I still felt pretty comfortable being there. Once Zedd came on, a group gathered right in front of the stage. I don't think I'll ever be able to get such a good up-close experience again!

We bought the guy's ticket ahead of time since he wouldn't be able to get discounted admission anyway. Luckily, they let him through the ""Invited Guests"" line too, so he did not need to enter through general admission.

They are pretty thorough, and strict, with bag checks. They threw away our empty Fat Tuesday Yards even though they were empty! Towels are provided. Lockers are $10 each. Amongst 5 people, we managed to rent 2. They also have black bags where you could try fitting as much as you can in each. They then give you a wristband for you to redeem your items later. Lockers are not one-time so you can go back for your stuff, though the line always seems to be long, so I wouldn't advise doing so. Definitely try to bring as little as possible!

The restroom/shower area was gorgeous! They even provide hairspray and body spray in the women's restroom. The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!

We got in around 1:15 pm. I came in free with my boyfriend only being $55. We were told $75 by our promoter, so that was a nice surprise.

The place is big, but there were still huge crowds of people. We stole a seat on one of the planters and people watched.

We ordered drinks but they were majorly expensive. $25 for a redbull vodka, $10 for a bud light. But that's where ALL our money went this trip, to those drinks. Because we both, especially my boyfriend, proceeded to get sh**faced. 

Then Deadmau5 came out - who we traveled all the way out to Vegas to see. He was awesome, and there was a crowd of people to watch him, but it didn't get out of control like it sometimes can at clubs. It was awesome but semi-mellow at the same time.

We made friends and got invited back to a cabana. That was cool, I loved how it was setup. There was a balcony to overlook the people walking outside the hotel. We had a great time and scored some free drinks from them too.

You may be familiar with this place if you've been to Surrender.

They have a bunch of people on staff walking around the entire time. I like how they have people mopping the floors so no one slips from people getting in and out of the pool.

Anyways courtesy of another hookup we got in for a discounted price. Otherwise I think it's $20 for girls and like $30/$50 for guys depending on the day. Anyways walked in and groups of mostly young ladies and groups of older guys (in their 40s and 50s). Weird. And it's not so much a club as a pool where people drink and smoke and talk. Otherwise you're just sitting there trying to get a tan. Music was good but hardly anyone was dancing. Not sure I would call it a day club. Also it's a pretty small area - mostly pool and the exclusive cabanas everywhere. No place to just sit though like no lounge chairs. Everyone who didn't have a cabana was in the pool or on the edge of the pool or sitting on the concrete planters around the vegetation. Pretty views from the property and it's décor is nice. Noticed the exclusive infinity hot tubs - those are cool but again looked only available to those with tables. At least two huge bars on either side of the pool and they actually had open bar for an hour. I don't think anyone knew about it but our promoter friend told us. Only girls could get free drinks and the free drinks were either mimosas or mixed drinks with skinny girl (diet?) vodka (like vodka cran). Free is free - can't complain.

3996693,2015-06-20,3,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"This is my favorite pool party in Vegas. For a point of reference, I've been to Rehab, Marquee Day Club, and Liquid (at Aria). But I don't really need to go to all the pool parties in Vegas to know that this one is one of the best -- I come here almost every time I come to Vegas in the summer - it's been consistently good for years and I never have a bad time. I don't know if classy and Vegas pool party ever go together in the same sentence, but I think this is the classiest of the pool parties, if a thing ever existed.

The lines can get super long and crazy, especially if there is a good DJ playing. If you know are going to come here, stay at the Encore and buy tickets ahead of time so that you can skip the line. Cover will be around $40-80 depending if you're a girl or a guy and who is playing (bought via the Encore concierge) Get there early, around 11:30 am or 12 pm to avoid the craziness and crowds - sometimes if it gets too crowded, they will stop letting people in.

To me, this is way more fun than the clubs at night - no heels that you have to wear for hours, sunshine, good music, and hanging out in the pool in 100 degree weather (usually). There's no hiding what anyone looks like here, in broad daylight and bathing suits, you better hope you've been working out.

I recommend not bringing anything to check in (no phone, no purse) because the bag check is $25. It's certainly better to pay that than to stash your phone somewhere and get it stolen, but $25 bag check fee is pretty ridiculously high. 

Drinks are expensive, around $10 for a beer and $16-18 for a mixed drink, but pretty normal for Vegas. They also serve food if you get hungry which is pretty awesome - they have chicken fingers, some salads, sandwiches. There's probably 10 things on the menu. Food is decent and will run you $15-20 per thing.

The party usually gets pretty busy around 1 pm and the main DJ plays around 2:30-3 pm. The party usually starts to wind down around 5 pm. There's a stage with a pole with ""rain"" that is in the middle of the pole. It ends up attracting either girls that look like ex-strippers who will sometimes get dollar bills in their bathing suits, girls who shouldn't be up there to begin with, girls that are too drunk, and/or girls grinding on one another. Whatever is up there is pretty entertaining and it's one of these things where the girls think they look sexy, but in reality it's more like a trainwreck where you can't look away.

All in all, it's a super fun time and one of the bigger pool parties with a better looking crowd of people that most the other pool parties and good DJs. Fork over the money and deal with the lines and crowds - it's worth it.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,8,1,5,ndwyv2pqPvkYrIWiJrf9yw

There are multiple bar locations. Drinks can be pretty pricey. A pineapple vodka was about $20 already. If you're friendly, they might give you more alcohol and less juice lol. Those big plastic containers are $65 and a big pitcher is $100. So I guess it's ultimately up to you and how much your friends can drink. 

I wasn't sure if I could bring sunblock and I didn't. (Of course I didn't even check). But the sun was blazing on a hot day in June and I told myself to just go buy sunscreen instead of getting sunburnt. The small bottle of sunscreen was $38. Yes, I'm not exaggerating, $38! 

We stayed there until 3, but the DJ didn't even show up yet, boo. Maybe I won't drink too fast so I can stay longer lol",RqurJWeLYgt_-fDr_g5Fxw,4,1,5,Y3RBBX5wNI3R1lxlXojxcA
4066075,2011-06-14,0,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Encore Beach Club is my favorite pool party in vegas for many reasons. 

Not only is the pool cleaner than most in Vegas, the people are cleaner. The crowd at Encore Beach was awesome (good looking but most very friendly). I went on a Sunday for Daystars Calvin Harris and reserved a lilypad in the water for a $500 minimum. It helps to have a promoter set this up or they will try and charge you $1000. I advice you to spend the 500 on a bottle rather than mixed drinks, which are usually very watered down. With the bottle purchase you get a ton of mixers. You also have a personal waitress and pool attendant. Very luxurious.

Calvin Harris was great as was the set up of the pool area. It never seemed too crowded and the energy felt right the whole day into the night. I would advise coming early and buying tickets ahead of time if you do not plan on purchasing a daybed/lilypad or a cabana (which are pricey)

Its a much more intimate experience than Rehab or Wet Republic but the opposite of TAO Beach, which I find dirty, cramped, and too loud. Everything at EBC is great...even the BBQ chicken wrap!",Qol3htarDOkFGNeT3nuGIw,0,0,5,VcqCrZqxa7sB2wSrPfzr8A

This is where you come for a Vegas style day party! That means it's over the top, girls wear heels, and it's most definitely a party scene! If that's what you're looking for, read on.

Encore Beach Club is my favorite out of all the Vegas beach clubs! That doesn't mean there aren't cons, but I always have a fantastic time here!

PROs:
-Amazing music! They often bring in the best of the best in terms of DJs.
-Spacious and nice layout
-Awesome cabanas and daybeds (for a charge)
-Delicious drinks
-Small casino in case you want something more to do than drinking and dancing
-They do a pretty good job staying on top of keeping the bathrooms clean. Being by the pool and accommodating so many drunk people, that's a pretty impressive feat!

CONs:
-It gets crowded and it can be hard to get in. Make sure you get here early if you don't want to pay that much or wait too long to get in. As with all things Vegas, the higher your girl-to-guy ratio, the easier it'll be to get in. If you have a lot of guys in your party, I highly recommend getting a table, buying a bottle, or tipping the bouncer.
-SUPER strict. I couldn't even bring in Aleve.
-Drinks are EXPENSIVE. Expect to spend a pretty penny.
-Pool can get a bit dirty, but after a few drinks you may not care.
-Bartenders and bouncers are pretty unfriendly.

Encore was much more organized and although there were more people you could still find space to move around and take a dip in the pool. Girls are free on guest list but guys have to pay full cover at a ridiculous price of $52. I'm really not sure why the beach club would cost more than the night club but i'm sure glad i'm not a guy!

EBC is the only dayclub I've ever been to in Vegas, but no doubt both times were pretty awesome. Great music and great crowd make this dayclub the place to be.

From what I can remember, the good:
- Spacious and awesome lilypads: worth the extra $$$ if you've got a big group
- Free guestlist for women if you know who to contact
- Complimentary drink vouchers for women - pretty stiff!
- Great headliners. Are you gonna stay the night? ;)
- Bathroom lines move quick, even women's
- Cute girls and guys. Summer bod, anyone?
- Sandals accepted and encouraged! We ain't about that stiletto life here

The bad:
- $25 for locker/storage bags?! DAFUQ, but you get to keep the drawstring bags. $5/each time to access the clear plastic bags, on top of the $25 fee is ridiculous
- Pool water is full of body liquids, liquor, chlorine, etc. Jungle juice you shouldn't be drinking

-Spacious - even for this sold out event
-Quick service for drinks
-Great overall performances by all the DJ's

Cons:
-Security involved with all the lines were rude power tripping assholes
-Servers for the cabanas were racist and rude
-Security on the inside were assholes literally pushes people around that were simply trying to enjoy themselves

This club was beautiful and filled with beautiful people.  The only drawback, AND THIS IS A HUGE ONE, is that the people in charge of both keeping the peace and keeping the patrons happy were COMPLETE ASSHOLES.

Around the entrance to the pools are cabanas that expensive as fu**, and rightfully so especially since it was a dope lineup for the show.  When people pay so much money for a prime spot, it's understandable that they want their area for their people and for other people to stay out.  My issue isn't with the fact that these spots are exclusive, my issue is with the way that the servers were handling it.  I was walking into the pool to cool down and the entrance was right between 2 cabanas.  This was a common entrance and EVERYONE was using it. When I tried, the server came up to me yelling in my face saying, ""THIS IS THE LAST FU**ING TIME I'M GOING TO TELLYOU, STAY THE FU** OUT OF THIS CABANA AREA OR I'M GOING TO KICK YOU THE FU** OUT!!!! ""
I responded by simply saying, "" I understand what you're saying, but there really isn't a reason to be so rude about it.  This is the first time I'm hearing this and it won't happen again.""
He then responded with, "" I'm sorry but I've been telling you people all day and to tell you the truth, all you asians look alike. ""
My jaw literally dropped when the guy told me this.  I couldn't believe this came out of this guys mouth.  My friend saw the disgust in my face and came over to figure out what was going on.  And before I could gather myself to respond, my friend got me out of the pool and I went to my ""respective corner"" in this verbal boxing match that I didn't even have a chance to throw a response too.
After talking to my friend, the server repeated how all of the asians at the club look alike and how he "" didn't want to be that guy who says stuff like that. ""  by "" that guy "" I'm sure he meant another racist white guy.  The cherry on top, was that when he was telling me friend how many times he had to yell at people to stay out, he pointed to my black friend and said especially that ni**er over there.  This is when my friend simply walked away because not only was my black friend no where near the area he was ""patrolling,"" but I'm sure that if he he said that he wasn't that he would just say that all black people looked alike too.

So after that I just stayed out of the pool altogether to avoid anymore racist comments.  Instead I stayed near our groups stuff stashed by a nearby tree that was near the pool.  After hanging out there, completely out of the way, I felt someone pushing me out of the way.  Not like a little nudge like an excuse me, but literally pushing me from the back into the tree.  When I gathered my feet and looked back.  It was red shirt security guy that said that I needed to get the fu** out of the way.  What was I in the way of???  No one was walking by, no one was complaining, no one was doing anything wrong except this douche trying to push his weight around.

Last issue I have is with the security in charge of the entrance lines.  This was a SOLD OUT event so our entire group got on the guest list weeks before to ensure entrance.  Our group isn't new to the party scene, so we knew that we might have to wait for a while, but we knew the show would be worth it.  When we got to the front of the line, they decided to let in the people who purchased presales first before they let anymore guest list in.  This is understandable and our group of 13 girls and 7 guys waited patiently.  During the wait, we had a birds eye view of security getting greased by line cutters left and right.  The velvet rope served no other purpose than a source of quick income for all of the security guards.  We thought to ourselves ... ok this isn't an issue, it happens everywhere.  So we shut out mouth and continued to wait patiently.  After a couple of hours, the main security guard ( I only think this because he was yelling at everyone telling them what to do ) said no more people could be let in through the ropes and this must have pissed off some if not all of the security guards that feed off this extra income.

So, after waiting in line, at the top of the stairs, under the Las Vegas Sun ... We were getting ansy and decided to ask the person in charge of our line if we were next to get in soon.  His response, to this very simple question, that was not said in a rude fashion of any sorts was, "" You're gonna get it, but if you continue to give me attitude, I'm going to kick you out! ""  Once again, we had already invested 4 + hours now, so our group simply shut their mouth.

4187487,2012-08-21,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"This is still one of my favorite pool parties, but I wanted to update with some recommendations for bottle service since I didn't have that great of an experience.

-Make arrangements in advance; table reservations can fill up quickly during the peak of summer.  We were expecting to get a table near the pool area, but got stuck with one in the back near the bar because the other tables had been booked already.  The tables basically cost the same, so avoid getting ripped off.

-If you're gonna splurge for bottle service, you might as well get a lily pad or cabana.  Especially in the heat of Vegas summer, you're gonna want a location with shade and/or the pool nearby.

-Get to your reservation relatively early if you have a big group.  I really hate when the VIP line is longer than the general admission/guest list line.  Even worse, sometimes they ""hit capacity"" where they don't let anyone - even people with bottle service - in unless you previously bought a ticket.  One of my girlfriends was supposed to meet up with our group after work and they turned her away at 2pm because they hit capacity, blah blah blah... no matter how many hook ups you have with the staff and promoters here, you still might get turned away if you show up too ""late"" and there's some big house DJ performing.  Lame, but I guess those are the rules of the game.

Overall, I still like EBC a lot because I love the set up and music.  However, I don't think bottle service is worth it unless you really go all out.",tduMSflg1bhAFDgWOr4MPg,2,0,4,6zeImMkSqwa1erq_z-CJng

I bought a table, 2 girls in my group had to get in guest list, so we broke off into two different lines, my line was the table reservation line and there line was the guest line. 

I was thinking since I've spent so much money on the table that I would have got in a lot faster. Absolutely not.

Not only did I wait an hour- an hour and 15 minutes to get into the line, it was under the hot sun in 100 degree weather. I literally felt like I was going to pass out at one point. There was no shade for the table line, no water, nothing. 

But the line next to me which was general admission was all shaded and going so fast.

AND my 2 friends who were on a guest list, waited maybe 5 minutes in line before they got in and got in for free. 

How is it that someone who paid a couple thousand dollars for a table has to wait over an hour to get in while people who are getting in free, don't have to wait at all.

Also known as Surrender during the evenings, Encore Beach Club (EBC) is hybrid between three elaborate, expansive pools and a world-class, Vegas nightclub. When thinking about EBC, don't even think about the standard hotel pool; because it's far from it!

Last Saturday, I went to EBC to celebrate a friend's birthday with a big group of around 20 people. Getting into the place was a breeze: when we checked in, we felt like VIPs/High-Rollers. My host greeted us at the entrance, introduced himself to our group, and then escorted us to our table... RIGHT IN FRONT OF the DJ booth [Diplo was performing] (check out my photos to see how close we were). As we were getting seated at the table, I could tell that people standing around us were a little bit jealous; heck, I would be too!

At the table, we were introduced to our waitress (Winter was her name) and our runner (Anthony). The two were extremely friendly, talkative, and funny, and they also catered to our every need. Whenever the birthday boy needed something, they handled it quickly. Now while our table was nice, the real reason why we came to EBC were the pools. 

There are about three pools at EBC, and they are all pretty big. The main pool sat right in front of our table and in front of the DJ booth; this is where everyone chills and lounges in. Surrounding the pools are two floors of Bungalows and Cabanas (they have their own tvs, balconies overlooking the strip, and restrooms). I've been in these before, and they are great; however, kinda expensive (on Saturday, they were selling for $2,500 for a cabana and $4,000 for a bungalow). EBC also has about 4 bars, six gaming tables, and a full-service snack shack. I ordered chicken tenders and fries, and it was about $20 for four pieces of chicken; but hey, that's Vegas for you. 

Honestly, I love EBC. The vibe, ambiance, DJ selection (just about every major EDM DJ has a residency to perform there), the service.... pretty much there defines why Encore Beach Club is a truly great, exemplarily, and outstanding place.

Friend: We're going to a pool.
Me: So... We can swim?
Friend: You can float. 

No, no you can not swim here at the Encore Beach Club. I strongly advise you that if you are going into the pool, please keep your head above water at all times. Packed group of people + everyone drinking + the urge to pee = PLEASE. Not only that, but heaven forbid you make a splash and melt off some girl's makeup. 

The main point of this beach club is to admire (or be disgusted by) the variety of body types and beach-wear ensembles. As a people-watching enthusiast myself, I would give this place top marks. Apparently part of the beach club is of the club Surrender, but does it matter when you are busy trying to find a place to sit? We hid our stuff by a tree near an empty table and hopped into the pool. They have shallow edges around and in the middle by the dancing island, so a place to sit should not be difficult to find.

Drinks are expensive. Perhaps I've been spoiled by pre-gaming but ordering a Bloody Mary for a friend and a shot of Goose for me turned out to be 28 without tip. Phew. On the plus side, the DJ really feels the vibe of the audience and plays great music the whole time.

And this will be old news, but dancing in the water is harder than it looks! It seriously requires all of your concentration to not look like a walrus flopping in/out of dry land.

So kudos to the bartender she came through on her end and my pockets came through on my end. Overall, it was fun to experience, but it wouldn't be my go to every time I am in Vegas. I still have a sore spot for daylight and wet republic as a second.

1. We bought general admission tickets ahead of time online to see Diplo on a Sunday and arrived at 1pm. Two hours after opening, only had to wait about 5 minutes to get in. I don't think buying expedited entry tickets are necessary.

2. Come hydrated. A small 12 ounce water bottle costs $12. There are no free cups of water.

3. Renting a locker costs $50...ridiculous, I know. But you do get to open and close it as many times as you want so I guess that is a ""perk""

4. Those fancy drinks served in yards? Not even close to what you pay for the ones sold on the strip. You'll need at least $65 (depending on what kind of alcohol you want in it) if you want one of these.

5. Do not go on the pool stage if you are a drunk mess. I saw a bride twirl on the pole and fall on the side of her body (ouch) and it was all over Instagram. Not cute.

This club gets crowded but there was plenty of room to walk around in and outside of the pool. We were there from 1-3:30 though, so I can't speak for later in the day.",2Bcq1i1ndSyvYDS8Zn2Oew,4,1,5,d-QI8yrQzjVSpTrgCa_2tA

Your girls will thank you when they only have to walk 2 minutes in their heels to the entrance instead of 8 minutes. Or better yet, don't drive so you can get drunk off $20 drinks in the oven they call Las Vegas. 
EBC seems to have become the unofficial club for the Asians of Los Angeles. Beach clubs seem to attract a significantly younger crowd than regular clubs as well. 
There is plenty of space for those without a cabana or lily pad. The lily pads are cheaper than cabanas, but end up being more fun. Get a cabana if you want your own space and don't want people coming by. The lily pads are in the water and allow you to be more social. 
There are lockers to put your stuff in, but they are extremely pricey. Do yourself a favor and get a waterproof phone bag for your ID and money and don't bring anything else in. I've seen way too many people lose a phone after dropping it in at EBC and it'll save you the locker money :( 
There are tables for gambling and two bars for drinks. Drinks are what you would expect at a Vegas club. The day clubs are what you think of when you hear EBC, but don't forget about their night swims. It's less hot, just as many people and just as famous of a DJ.

Much cleaner and less ratchet than Marquee and Wet Republic. Probably 'cause it's more expensive. Never expect guys to get in for free here. My friends split up the ladies and gentlemen so ladies get in free (usually with drink tickets) while the gentlefolk purchase tickets. Depending on who the DJ is, expect tickets to be anywhere from $40 - $100. This past weekend, lockers were $45 but if everyone in your group wants to go in the water, it's a great investment. 

The bartenders are super chill too. Even though drinks are $$$$, most of the bartenders I dealt with poured pretty heavily.

I had a wonderful time at this pool party when i went out with a buddy of mine for his birthday.
This place has a feel of fame,luxury and beauty.It is a newer hottest spot, a wonderful play ground.
I think it out beat hard rock party ""detox"" that once was the place to be on Sunday.
The cost of the club cost to mister Wynn almost 68 millions to build that paradise of party. 
The 3 pools are surrounding by cabanas and bed, dancing poles and palms tree ,you have bars on each side of the pool and a huge selection of liquor and cocktails.
The deejay booth is in the center and their surrounding sound systems top notch give you some of the pure sound.
Some of the world's best deejays come and spin here. 
The high end clientele give you one of the best fashion show of bathing suit,high heels and fancy purse. 
People are very friendly and willing to party their soul away. 
It is at the level of Saint Tropez and Ibiza parties.
The drinks are reasonably priced but if you rent a cabana it will cost you a few thousand dollars.
They have a matusalem of Cristal ""6 liters of fine champagne"" on their price list going for $50000.
Like the Vegas say, it is a fact. No money,no honey.

I think I'm just too old to thoroughly enjoy the beach club scene.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy it as general admission (I don't know if I would have enjoyed it when I was 21 either) so my party opted to make reservations several weeks in advance for a cabana.  We got a ""deal"" through a VIP host but were still shelling out a hefty sum to have a bit of shade and respite from the crowds.  The contract said to arrive by 11:30am to honor our reservation and also stated that if we didn't show, we would be charged $1500 for a missed reservation.  The majority of my group showed up at 11am (when they opened) and proceeded to wait in line for almost an hour.  The line wasn't that long but the promoters outright ignored us and attended to people around us.  When someone finally acknowledged us, our reservation was completely messed up and in order for us to get something similar to our original reservation (but still a downgrade), we had to pay an extra $1000 over our original price.

I nearly lost it when they continued to make us wait...I vocalized my frustration and we were finally escorted to our cabana.  What a disappointment!!!  The cabanas range from $3000 to $10,000 and it's basically just a room and an adjacent day bed overlooking the beach club.  I was grateful to have a cool place to rest when I couldn't handle the heat any longer and didn't want to risk catching an STD in the pool that my friend deemed ""people soup.""  We ordered copious amounts of food, drinks, bottles of water, ice cream, magnums of champagne...everything we could to meet the minimum and cover our cabana fee.  It was the definition of opulence and wastefulness.  I felt a little bit like Marie Antoinette.

Our VIP host found me after we were settled in our cabana and apologized for the confusion but could do nothing about the extra $1000 or the down-graded cabana.  It was an empty apology.  She was contrite with me but gave my husband attitude, saying that she was embarrassed because we ruined her relationship with the people at the club.  I found this to be completely unprofessional and if she had just shown up on time, she could have saved her own relationships.

I really expected better service from a hotel like Encore.  This experience really left a sour taste in my mouth and I would check out the beach club at Marquee over Encore in a heartbeat.",qahEbl4cbKX3tz_smwOf4w,8,1,1,ozCY5v3ihOtgXjU8O3iTJg

We arrived around 12:15pm and there were quite a lot of people already but it wasn't too bad. My friends and I were on the guest list so getting through was pretty quick. The security check was very thorough. They unzipped all the pockets in my bag. Security even checked my wallet and my glasses case! We had our empty Fat Tuesday bottles thrown out, so sad :( 

My friends and I had a couple of bags with us and no way were we going to leave our stuff out and risk having our valuables getting stolen. Luckily they had lockers and were $10 each. We had the option of putting as much stuff together into one bag, to save money. Of course it had to fit into the lockers. We had about 4-5 bags and we ended up getting 2 lockers..not bad. They also provide towels upon entrance.

I was amazed by the women's restroom because it's the first restroom that I've seen that provided body spray, lotion, hairspray. Anything you need is there!


Later on in the day it started to get more crowded but there was still enough room for you to roam around so that was good. Before Zedd came on, the world cup final was playing on the big screen and everyone was just watching the game together. But once Zedd came on, everyone got out of the pool and ran towards the stage.

(Well, to be honest, I've actually only been to day clubbing in Vegas, so I can't speak for the one's in Europe or South America, but this is easily the best day club on the strip).

It's like the adult version of Disneyland. You have to wait in a long ass line and pay premium prices to get in, but it's all worth it once you finally get inside.

The music is always banging as they have some of the biggest house DJ's lined up. Even trance and hip-hop heads can't deny that house music is exactly what you wanna hear when you're completely wasted and fucking shit up in the pool.

Compared to all the other day clubs, Encore is extremely spacious and the crowd is noticeably more attractive. Yeah that sounds a bit shallow, but I guarantee you'll notice it and how much of a difference it makes to your day clubbing experience. If you ever hear people at your gym talking about how they're working out for day clubbing, I'm almost 100% sure they're getting ready for EBC.

1) Drink prices are the norm for Vegas clubbing
2) Get a locker if you don't want your phone getting wet
3) Arrive early or else you won't get in

Blazing hot, scantily-clad beautiful women and men, expensive but weak drinks, and not a place to sit... unless of course you reserve a cabana or daybed.  Fortunately for us, my fiancé knew the promoter so we all got in for free (including him) and had a huge reserved area to ourselves! *score*

I'll admit... I love to be poolside but not inside the pool. ;o)  Especially when it involves sharing the pool with 100s of strangers!  However, the water was clear & appeared clean.  My friends got in the pool but I didn't.  I covered myself in sunblock and still managed to get a tan. (I hate getting darker bc I'm dark enough as it is!)  

Be prepared to drop serious $$$ on drinks.  Like any other club, bar, restaurant in Vegas they aren't cheap.  My girlfriend bought the 1st round of drinks - 2 cocktails and 1 beer. Total was $42.  The bartender was SLOW and tended to other patrons who arrived after us.  And she had the nerve to say she couldn't make a mojito bc she had no mint leaves.  We saw a tub full of mint leaves a few feet away from her. WTF?

The next round was on my fiancé.  I asked for a double bc my 1st drink was totally weak.  Total cost for 2 double cocktails was $60.

Overall, I had a great time.  Lil Jon had a personal cabana across from us & that was our only celeb-sighting.  

Encore Beach Club is a beautiful & relaxing pool party option.  Super chill and I loved seeing the ladies in bikinis paired with heels. Sexy!",fMBA_z1hwURKp9uArgSmKA,14,16,4,f8QgK0vfPNwvf5WCUdHlXg
4505624,2014-10-12,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"Definitely the BEST dayclub in Vegas.  I drank at the open bar, and then ran around the pool while piggybacking my girlfriend until the skin off both my big toes peeled off and made wearing heels the next night a total chuckle/sob fest.             

Encore is still the best.  I love the open dual pool layout, the glamorous vibe, and the stripper pole floating area that makes me SO SCARED for any future daughters that I may have. I am so entertained by this area, especially when the lifeguards will whistle their hearts out when any dude dares to approach the poles, the sanctity of which is apparently reserved only for women.  Makes me snort on my drink/filthy pool water every single time. 

It gets crowded and hectic though, and the line to retrieve your personal belongings trails in front of both the bathroom and dayclub entrance.  It's such a mess. I honestly wish I have waterproof sexy fanny pack (what an oxymoron) coming to this place so I don't have worry about my personal belongings so much.

4508312,2016-07-18,1,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"My friends and I have never been to a day club in Vegas before, so we weren't sure what to expect when we went on Sunday, July 10 (Zedd was the DJ). I went in with low expectations because I thought it would be extremely hot (in the upper 90s and 100s) and overcrowded, but I surprisingly had a great time! Definitely want to come back again :D 

The whole area was pretty big; there was plenty of room to go around in the water and also a decent amount of free seating for those who did not pay $$$ to reserve something. 

I can't comment on prices since my friends and I (all girls) were on the guest list and didn't get any drinks past the two complimentary champagne drink tickets we got as part of the guest list, but here are some tips:

-They have a very strict security policy. They very thoroughly checked our bags and even threw out a small pack of gum from my friend's bag. I was really surprised they were so strict. I have a picture in my review of their sign that lists out what isn't allowed, but here are some of the things I remember: real cameras, outside food/drinks, over-the-counter medication, gum, eye drops, and selfie sticks.

-They give you towels for free. You can go back and grab more.

-Bag check is $55 per bag and lockers were $75 on the day I went, so if you want to spend most of your time in the water, I would recommend either bringing a water proof pouch to stick your valuables (phone, ID, money, etc.) and leave the rest of your stuff at the various seating around the pool. We circumvented this by taking turns having someone sit with our stuff at one of the cushioned seating areas in the shade. Some people also left their belongings by the side of the pool wrapped in a towel.

-Speaking of seating, it was all cushioned and super comfy! I really appreciated the comfy seating as part of my group ended up sitting for most of Zedd's set. Some of the seats are in the sun, but there are definitely some shaded spots as well. Especially once Zedd came on, most people went into the dancing area or the water and the seated areas were pretty empty, so my friends and I were able to easily snag one of these spots. It was still pretty hot in the shade, but nowhere as hot as it would've been under the sun.

-Zedd came on at 3:30 and played until 5:30 or so. We didn't realize this, so we came kind of early around 1 pm.

-The dance area right in front of the DJ stand is right in the sun and doesn't get any shade. Bring sunscreen if you're planning to spend most of your time in the pool or dancing.

-One of my friends mentioned there was no free water. Instead they charge you $10 for Fiji water. No thanks!!",epPsJevS8chv-tvxYDCSew,10,0,5,-ZEKzlZ04fHT4AiCm7XQLQ

Apparently we came on the most crowded day of EBC they've had this year so far (6/6/15) but we still had ample dancing space in the water & in the shade near the bars, so that was really great. 

Walking through crowds took a little bit of time, but just be patient and don't be that rude individual that pushes and yells at others. It wasn't that bad. 

Lines for the restroom can be a little long once mid-day hits, but you'll get through it. I do wish there were more bathrooms though. 

Vibes are generally chill (with the exception of one guy who accused us of stealing one of his water bottles when we had just gotten back from a 20 minute trip to the bar--he eventually apologized after pulling a security guard over).

Drinks are expensive. $20+ each for a gin & tonic. But they were appropriately measured & poured. Tickets are pricey, but I gladly would've payed again to avoid standing in that ridiculous line in the hot sun waiting who knows how long to get inside.

Some quick tips:

- Park in the Wynn self-parking structure and walk across the pedestrian bridge on the 2nd floor to save yourself from walking through the Encore casino
- If you have a ticket, walk across the lines (security will usually direct you) through the doors into the building; you don't have to line up outside in the heat (thank goodness)
- Line will move fairly quickly. From around the corner to the entrance of EBC, it took maybe 30 minutes
- The less you have, the quicker the bag check will be. If you have a wallet on you, be ready to open it up.
- Towels can be picked up next to the restroom by the entrance
- Bar next to the stage is less crowded than the bar on the side and the line usually isn't as long
- There's another restroom next to the bar on the side
- Find a nice corner in one of the planters to stash and pile up your group's stuff. Don't be disrespectful of other people's belongings though.",q36T1j7w_XUKjVaV7q4rYg,7,2,4,FLr7CAh-bOGvsW0-WwSxFw

Pros: 
1.The place was HUGE and actually accommodates the amount of people they actually let in, did not feel sardine-y whatsoever. 

2.The water remained clear through the whole course of the day which was quite impressive. 

3. Zedd was playing this past weekend and threw a good mix together! 

4. Bouncers/ workers that I encountered were really easy to work/talk with which was nice and made my life a lot easier. 

5. Mostly good vibes, but will explain the rest below....

Cons: 
1. I met a lot of people this past weekend that were totally sending me good vibes but I also met some dicks as well (pardon my language). For some reason these two tables just felt super entitled because they had a table. Uhh first off I was not there to leech and secondly you should thank me for wasting all my sunblock on your sunburnt a$$es! SMH!

2. Drinks are freaking expensive! One cup is $21 before tax and the reuseable cup was $99 before tax. My heart literally broke into pieces when I heard that. 

3. Locker/ storage room is managed by employees of the club. The initial cost is $25 but it is an additional $5 every time you want to get something out. Better off paying for the usual ones in my opinion, but that's not even an option here :(

1: The looks: It's beautifully appointed and the decor is in line with the swankyness you expect from a hotel like the Wynn. They make the Vegas pool party shitshow classy. Yes, it's possible. It's clean, and doesn't get too filthy by the end of the day. The bathrooms are well maintained throughout the day. The beautiful people play here-get those wedges and itsy bitsy bikinis ready girls. 

2: The service: it's outstanding! We had a lilly pad for the day and our adorable server was attentive and went the extra mile. We misunderstood the details of what is and isn't allowed on the lilly pads and what was included with our prepaid tab-like no food! Damn! She was awesome, and between her, the management, and Red Carpet VIP, they let us order anyways. She set up our orders nearby on a tray table and was a total sweetheart about it too. The pool boys set up our towels and waters and even straightened our long line of wedges on the edge throughout the day. The bouncers are on point but fun, they'll take a pic for you if you ask politely. 

3: The Menu: Our group consisted of ladies with many a food allergy. Encore provides an awesome allergen menu. Allergic to gluten, dairy, shellfish, and nuts? Well one of our besties is too, and she was happy as a clam she couldn't eat with this option. It was actually one of the main reasons we picked this pool. When all the girls in your group are happy, it's a better day by far! 

4: I saw a guy wearing Hulk Hands. Nuff said.

I bought some of the ""expedited entry"" for ladies tickets for the show, as when I called to ask what that was, it was so skip the lines, and they can be 2 hours long to get in. 
We get there, and no line. So I paid extra for nothing. What a rip off. The girl on the phone obviously didn't know what she was talking about. 

First of all, the tickets state the show/open doors is at 10:30am. Doors didn't open until closer to 11:30. They search people quite thoroughly which is good. But they confiscated our sunscreen! Who goes to a pool party and is not allowed sunscreen?? We got there and hung out in the pool and it was not too crowded which was a good thing. Drinks are insanely expensive (and not very tasty I might add) and the female bartenders in bikinis had a bit of an attitude. We wanted to rent a locker for some of our things but they wanted $75 for a locker!!! We laughed out loud at the craziness of it and said no thanks. You do get towels which is nice. One thing you don't pay for at this place! Bathrooms were maintained and nice and clean. There is nowhere to sit unless you come early enough and grab a circular couch seat, otherwise all daybeds and cabanas you pay for. 
I was not impressed in the least by this place. Which is too bad, because the Wynn hotel itself is one of my favorite in Las Vegas.

First part of the evening was being shuffled in and out of the club and repeatedly searched while security tried to figure out how to scan tickets, give out wristbands and stamp hands for the event guests. About 4 of us just kept getting told to leave and start the whole line process over every time we got to the front and were missing a piece of the puzzle... despite being escorted in and out by different security guards. Total lack of organization going on. 

I was the last person of the 4 to FINALLY get in. Then, as I was walking down the steps from the gaming area to where the beer stands were, the group from the line saw and waved at me. I looked up and waved back and BAM, ate it down a couple unlit concrete steps. Super dark in that area. Twisted my ankle, scrapped up my knee pretty bad. Got wheeled into the back, given ice, told they'd like to send me to the hospital in an ambulance (no way jose). When they found out I was local they said they usually just take people to the front and leave them to get an Uber after something like this but they would be ""cool"" and let me call a friend to get me and wait with me out front as well. As I couldn't walk or stand on my foot, I was grateful for the being ""cool"" that's for sure. 

Encore... please puts some lights on your dark concrete steps at the beach club. Pretty dangerous at night. And dear God, maybe have a security meeting before you open so that everyone knows what the protocols are for letting people into events you're hosting?

Edit: Due to questions about Item #6 I've added a bit more detail. 

1: Your best bet to get in without dealing with the bad attitude security staff is to find a promoter and let them do the work for you. Look on Yelp and you'll find good ones that can make getting in a breeze. 
2: When you go here, don't take anything that the security people could think is suspicious. Eye drops, Tylenol, even prescriptions will have security either tossing it or giving you a major attitude. In some cases I've seen people flat out turned away and if you protest, your exit is pretty much assured. 
3: Once you're in your best deal is to get a day bed or a cabana. Otherwise it's a PITA to keep track of any personal items you bring in. And space becomes almost non-existent fast. When a big name DJ is there, you'll be thinking this is what being a sardine in a can feels like. 
4: Bottle service. It just saves so much hassle. Pay up, do it, you won't regret it.
5: Don't think you can do your best Michael Phelps imitation and swim at EBC. You're eye candy and really nothing more than a 2 legged ATM to them. Float in the water, check out the people, enjoy the experience, and try not to annoy the ""lifeguards"" who use their whistles to spoil your fun with any chance they get. 
6: SERIOUS FYI: Beware of the cuties. That cute woman you're staring at that comes up to talk to you and gets you to blow half your Vegas budget at the bar? She could be an independent contractor, one of approximately 50, yes I said FIFTY different women, hired each day / night for the express purpose of being fun eye candy to entice you to spend money at the bar and on amenities. The women doing this work can make VERY reasonable money doing so, and all you get at the end is a lighter wallet and no chance of anything else. This isn't a sour grapes thing, I know some women who work here and know how it works. I'm just a local sharing what I know so that maybe you can save some money. Don't say nobody warned ya. 
7: Don't gripe about drink prices. EBC pours some STIFF DRINKS for that $17 you just dropped, and don't forget to tip. 

Overall, EBC is one of Wynn's cash cows. They continue to find innovative ways to extract maximum revenue from you and if you don't want to cough up the cash there's a long line of people that do. But if you go in knowing what to expect and adjust your expectations you can have a blast here. Just don't expect to get that hottie's phone number.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,10,2,3,Lnku-pR0VypsXHr8pWggJA

Ok I should probably say that this review is probably skewed a bit because of our awesome promoter that we randomly meant on the strip, Richie Palou. He hooked us up with no cover, minimal line, and access to a stretch of several cabanas/day beds to hang at. There was also free mimosas for ladies until 2. In addition, he wouldn't even take my measly 10 dollar tip and just said to enjoy ourselves (but not to say that you shouldn't try)! Such a sweet guy. So with that said, I didn't pay a cover or for drinks so my experience was probably different than for others (especially guys!)

We went on a Sunday (which I was told was the best day to go). And guess who was the DJ...none other than Lil Jon! He was really good too. The place itself has a fun ambience with a lot of palm trees and the cabanas are adorable with red curtains and day beds. The cabanas had balconies that opened up to the street. They also were stalked with towels and glasses. Coat check is only 10 per bag so we just put all of our smaller bags into one big bag and split the cost making it really cheap. The water wasn't murky like others have complained. I would recommend getting there by 12 (1 at the latest). Try to get the hookups if you can but if not I'd definitely recommend this.

Seems like the reviews are either totally in awe, or in complete disdain of this place. I think for the majority of those who gave this place poor reviews, they simply aren't familiar with Vegas/pool parties or didn't bother to educate themselves a little before coming. Let me explain why this place is top notch in my book. 

It's expensive. Like, really expensive. So just know that and accept it out of the gate. Don't go to the best pool party in Vegas and then give a crappy review because the waffle fries were $12 and you think that is an abomination. You know why stuff is expensive? Because it's WORTH it. Supply and demand. A place like Encore Beach Club is pricey - but don't view it as a bad thing. That keeps the riff raff out. I prefer to organize a group to split the costs and do my homework ahead of time at a nice place vs going to a less expensive place with a rougher crowd.

I also read a LOT, and I mean a LOT of complaints about the front of the house. The security staff. Etc. So, I was extra observant as to how they treated patrons, VIPs, etc. And let me just say, even beginning my experience with a somewhat tainted view of security and staff, they blew me away with their professionalism and courtesy. Yes, there are lines. Yes, do your homework ahead of time and figure out what is/isn't allowed. But don't write a bad review because they threw your gum away or wouldn't let you bring in medication. Again, this ensures a classy and safe time for ALL the people who spent an arm and a leg to have a great time. We had a daybed, so the line was much faster to get through than the general admission. We had several questions, flagged people down, and this amazing thing happened - when we were courtious, the staff was courteous right back! Special props to Channing - their staff was so respectful and amazing I even remember their names after all that alcohol and debauchery. 

The venue inside is top notch. No splashing like other day clubs allowed (thank God). Serving staff was amazing, and yes food prices were steep - THIS is Vegas people! Again not a shocker.  We got to watch Kaskade do his thang, and the vibe was AmAZING. Best part of my three day weekend for sure. Ladies, bring a nice swim suit. If you have a nice body, this is the place to flaunt it and not be ashamed if it's skimpy. Guys were all really respectful and classy - don't come here to be a perve or rub up on girls. I was with a group of large tattooed men so it wasn't a problem for me.

Overall, I definitely hope Encore keeps this a classy, high end day club. If they do I will definitely be back.",b5CTGS0BNvTWb5FoR8PzLA,2,1,5,URwqTpDXAonPfeaCfbrFbg

Deadmau played for no more than 45 minutes and only put on his signature helmet for 1 song. The first half of his set was boring and sounded like the elevator music played at the Encore. The next song was good then it went back to a boring repetitive beat. So disappointing. 

We purchased ticked weeks in advanced and paid close to $200 for one of the most DISAPPOINTING concerts I've ever attended. 

Now let talk about the good. The Encore has great employees. They will meet you with a smile and get you anything you need, provided you pay it. Most of their own employees  agreed with me that the sets player by their DJs was almost amateur. 

I talked with the assistant general manager after Deaudmau's set to express my disappointment with the entire experience. He pretty much said ""were you able to get drinks? (At $22 dollars a piece), then we did our part"".

Some of my fave in the beginning were Moorea Beach (european tanning) and the Palms pool when GoVentures started hosting Love/Fab fest on the big holiday wknds. I have not been to the Wynn or Encore but once, to try and get into XS but the line was EXCESSIVE so we decided to pass. Anywho.... it was 4th of july wknd and since we did the 3 day thing for EDC (and I wasn't off on monday) we were going to lay low. However, I won a table to see Tiesto at the Joint on Saturday night and we decided to keep the mood going with a daybed to see Afrojack on the 4th. I had 5 people with me that were going to assist with the bill so we had thought this would work out. 
Bottom line, I spent WAY more than I had intended, but Afrojack was amazing, the vibe was excellent and we even got to see Steve Aoki and Lil' Jon up close and personal. That's probly the best part about this pool- the DJ booth is so close, you can almost touch them and I guess if your big pimpin', or just got alot of money, you can even get a table right there next to the stage to party at.
Its expensive here. Holiday wknds make it even more so. Im looking forward to checking out the dippin thing they do at night on Thursday nights to see if its possible to enjoy this place on a budget.
I have to say in general Im sorta bummed that we as locals, who can support the places more so than the occasional tourist... don't really catch any breaks. Groupon anyone? lol
Some points to remember:
*best to get in line early if you don't have a daybed/cabana (guests of the hotel do not get any perks as far as getting any prior to anyone else)
*I would think guys would be better off going in a group and getting a daybed or lilypad and splitting the cost

Things to know:
*****
I. EXPERIENCE: To do EBC right, don't go cheap. Pay for the bottle service/ lounge area in order to bypass the obnoxiously long, sun-oppressing General Admission line. Even though I don't often participate in basic bro stuff, I have to admit, it felt nice. Sure, it's a mortgage payment and then some, but if you're going to buy a Lexus opt to pay extra for the CD Player (or now-a-days aux or bluetooth function). Your experiences will be vastly different depending on how much money you put down.

Everything felt like a music video. I saw gorgeous men and women everywhere and lots of debaucheries in and out of the pool. Some firsts include the following:

- Pole dancing in my swimsuit.
- Being asked to participate in a bridesmaid's orgy (which I declined). 
- Witnessing champagne liberally poured on partygoers like super soakers. 
- Naked pyramids.
- Just more naked people than I could ever see at a strip club.

I don't know much about pop music, but someone named David Guetta spun this past Saturday day. (I seriously didn't know who he was.) I arrived around 10 am with ten others, and the party filled to the brim by the early afternoon. 

II. PRICES: This exclusive party experience comes at a premium. General admission is $50, but if you have a large party, again, consider getting a booth. One bottle is $750, but each drink at Encore, at least, is starting at $20. (Crazy stupid, I know.) But for paying JUST a bit more, you'll receive a more comfortable experience aka more partying and less waiting.

III. LOCATION:
Wynn Las Vegas hosts Encore Beach Club. You can't wait in the front of the actual location -- because security will tell you to move -- so if you're meeting people there then do it next door at Wynn Poker. 

IV. OTHER TIDBITS:
- Man, I didn't want to eat at the pool party, but they offer some of the best chicken tenders ever. Haha.

- Bring a swim suit that doesn't easily come off of you. 

- If you're not paying for a booth, don't bring your phone even though you want to post on Instagram or Snapchat. You will probably lose it. 

V. OVERALL: The Grand Canyon still ranks as the most amazing thing I saw during my friend's recent bachelor party, but Encore Beach Club comes as a close second. 

Best party in Vegas, hands down. I'm still recovering from the party of a lifetime.",pnTiEaqM4slogpY97n9Kvg,16,14,5,KzygZZSEEL1u3R2GZO0AKA

Our promoter hooked us up with a cabana and told us that they were giving ladies complimentary mimosas from 11:30am - 1pm, if I remember correctly. When we arrived, he instructed us not to get in line, rather, to wait in a weird grassy area down a set of stairs. We ended up being corralled with large groups of other girls who were apparently told the same thing by their promoters. It was hot and there was barely any shade. We were all waiting for about 45 minutes before we were finally lead into the venue.

Turns out, cabanas weren't given to individual groups, there were only 5 available and it was a free-for-all once we got in. Luckily, we hit it off with another large group of girls (who were also from northern Cali) and happily shared a cabana with them. Once we got our first round of mimosas (which were surprisingly strong), the initial aggravation gave way to a happy buzz.

My best girlfriend and I were floating after our 2nd mimosa and decided to take a stroll around the pool. We observed gorgeous people everywhere having fun in the sun. Some really nice guys struck up a conversation with us and invited our entire cabana to share their table and pool-space. They kindly offered us drinks, but those darned mimosas really finished me, so I simply enjoyed chatting with them while cooling off in the pool.

One of the staff members had mistaken me for a popular import model, lol, no harm done, really! We all left later that afternoon feeling mighty fine. The place was pretty poppin' for a Friday morning, but not uncomfortably packed. Some of our girls returned the next day, Saturday, and told us that it was super-crowded and the pool water was warm and full of all sorts of nastiness.

Encore Beach Club doesn't have that raging, dancing party atmosphere like Wet does, which I think it's due to the fact that all their pools are pools and not places where you can stand and get your feet wet.

4952248,2012-05-16,0,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"If I could give 0 stars, I would...  

Not sure what the 5 stars that everyone is giving is for - thinking that some of these yelp reviews are rigged by promoters trying to get more people to go here...

Anyway, I got hooked up by a promoter with the bachelorette party of 6.  We were told to arrive at noon and we would get in for free.  Sure, why not?  It's free!  That was the only good part of the entire party - the fact that getting in was free.  If it wasn't, I would have been more pissed about my whole experience than I am now.  Here is why:

1) our bags were heavily searched when we walked in.  I totally understand the reasoning for this as people could bring in dangerous objects, but I saw one of the guards opening up someone's Carmex tin can and checking it by running her fingers along what was inside.  That is just ridiculous....  Ironically, they never found the flask of vodka I snuck in.  LOL

2) we all had water bottles on us since we walked from our hotel to the pool party.  We had to all confiscate our water - which was I was irritated by since I just bought mine for $6.  ugh..  My friend had hers in a fancy Nalgene bottle and had to check it in.  She then had to pay $5 just to check it in! what?!? That makes absolutely not sense to me.

3)  Since we weren't crazy enough to spend hundreds (if not thousands) on a cabana, we were told we could sit alongside the pool.  The six of us found a spot in the sun and decided to lay out and people watch.  This was fine for about 5 minutes before we got scolded and yelled at for the remainder of the two hours we decided to stay there.  Here are the reasons why we got in ""trouble"" (which is just ridiculous to me since Vegas is the place where no one should really get into ""trouble""):
a) eating near the pool.  We had to go sit at a planter and eat.  WHAT?!?! I'm sorry, but if we just spent $20 on a pint sized set of nachos, we should be able to eat wherever we want.  We were obviously sober and not going to make a mess
b) being too far to the pool's edge. HUH!?!?  We were told that we could sit there! 
c)  laying down to tan ourselves.  We were told by a lady two times to move forward (closer to the pool).  Ummmmm our butts were practically in the water!!  The lady had the audacity to tell us ""What didn't you understand the first time ladies?""  WTF.  I'm sorry, we were doing nothing wrong!!  
d)  leaving our towels out and not sitting on them.  WHAT?!?!?! Maybe we wanted to sit next to each other for some time and then save our spots to sit there again in a few minutes.  I just did not understand their dumb, made up rules. 

With that being said, we left, got our water bottle back, and laid out in peace and quiet at our own pool in our own hotel.  ughhhh TERRIBLE.  I would NEVER RECOMMEND this party to anyone.

Now people will argue that my experience sucked just because I didn't get a cabana.  Well, I was able to get a lot of people watching in and everyone else that got a cabana was not having a great time either.  They weren't drinking much just because drinks were just ridiculous and no one was getting cray cray like all the other reviews were saying.  Mind you, we were here on Cinco de Mayo, which is a day you would expect it to be cray cray... and it just wasn't.   UGH. NEVER AGAIN!!!!",9M9JmaJ3uWQABX0HN8IF8A,5,1,1,oqHyyp5U3A8tnm3GqTuazQ

I forget her name, but she's a gorgeous brunette.  We originally planned on visiting this beach club on Saturday, but we couldn't turn down a lily pad with no minimum ($500 min food/drink order to reserve) so we shifted our plans.  Needing a few hours of recovery time before a second night of partying, we made the right decision in choosing this spot over a super loud and crowded pool party.

Entry: not sure how much entrance fee is; find a promoter for free or discounted entry

Atmosphere: pretty chill on an early Friday afternoon (see pics); might be more happening later in the day or on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays since those are the days the photographer posts pics on the website

Space: large pools to frolic and dance to the music; nice wading areas surrounding the lily pads for staying cool in the water; plenty of cabanas (two levels), lily pads, and lounge chairs; indoor dining area with tables and chairs for those seeking shade

Food and drinks: ~$15-20 per item; food was tasty and portions were large (only finished half of my turkey bacon wrap); frozen drinks were refreshingly delicious (see pic; get the Watermelon 21 and Frozen Mojito)

View: beautiful bodies, clean water, and sunny blue skies

Specials: FREE mimosa bar from 2-3pm on Fridays (in July, hopefully ongoing)

Note: this place closes at 7pm and becomes Surrender Night Club at 10:30pm on certain nights

My overall impression is that Encore Beach Club is a classy pool party that doesn't get overcrowded.  I'd come here again for relaxation time and, hopefully, free mimosas!",RIZe3gi79Ko28xgG3dyzNQ,4,2,4,J8sucjzDcINOHPzTcMIRsg

They give you free towels so you won't have to worry about bringing your own. I was a little bummed that they didn't have free mimosas, but I guess it makes sense considering it was a really busy holiday weekend. Also, don't bring in any medicine (tylenol, ibuprofen...) because they'll just make you throw it away. LEAVE THOSE THINGS AT THE HOTEL!  

We got there early enough that we were able to find a spot along the pool area. The weather was generally around 77 degrees and not some ridiculous 100+. We ended up buying ourselves a drink (AMFs and Tokyo iced tea for me), which were about $17/drink.  Yes it's expensive, but what can I say that's Vegas for ya. Their drinks are CRAZY STRONG which will definitely make that $17 worth it. I definitely got a nice buzz and it wasn't even noon. One of my friends and I stayed inside the water for most of the time because it was a lot warmer than sitting out in the cold breeze. We ended up staying until 3:30 and got nice and tan!

They have water volleyball, gaming, lilly pads for lounging in the pool, bungalows with your own private pool, cabanas with a balcony view of the Las Vegas strip, the best looking ladies and gentlemen in Vegas partying their a$$ off, and the best DJ's in the world. This place is the best!

Drinks are standard Vegas prices with beer being $10-$12, mixed drinks $12-$20, and specialty drinks $15-$25. I believe the pitchers are $65 and you get 5 small drinks in 1 pitcher. No free tap water so expect to pay $8 if you ask for water. 

There is no open chairs at the pool. All adult Vegas pools want you to pay a food/beverage minimum for a lounge chair, table, daybed, or cabana if you want a place to lay out/party.

Pros: 
- By far the CLEANEST day club
- Good service
- Spacious
- Good food

Cons: 
- Um...none?

In A Nutshell: 

Encore Beach Club is by far the best day club that I've been to, although this is subjective (e.g. I highly dislike Marquee, therefore I automatically assume their day club sucks).  

First off, EBC is CLEAN. By the end of the day, the water is still clear and there are no cups, bottles, straws, crap, etc. floating around in the water.  The restroom floors are constantly being mopped and dried for those of you who like walking around barefoot (GROSS, but I digress).  

EBC also has a lot of space for people to roam and sit, especially those who don't order table service.  Wonderful, considering most clubs today make your life miserable if you don't happen to want to shell out $10,000 for a table.  The pool is also large enough to accommodate many people, making it easy maneuver through and to duck out of the way in case anyone wants to play chicken (which security won't let happen, but you never know...it's Vegas!).

Lastly, when you're drunk and starving, they have a bar area that serves great food.  Get the chicken fingers with waffle fries.  After 16 drinks, it's the best thing you'll ever eat.

GO. TO. EBC. Buy presales online and get in line early.  Doors typically open at 11am and run until 6pm.",76KhFc5QVTPyoVeTOWDJAw,2,0,5,GkjLQzyBfqj7o3NP9_NhCw

To ensure you make the most of this pool party on steroids, you gotta do a few things...

Reserve a cabana, lilypad, or daybed.  If you go with a large group, it's definitely worth it. Otherwise, pick a bench near a planter and hope for the best.  

Get there early.  We had a hook up and got there well before noon to meet him.  If you get there early enough, and don't like your spot, you may be able to talk to the host and snag a more prime location.

Lastly...drink, drink, drink.  I'd order food at your cabana, but drinks at the bar.  The pitchers of alcohol seem like a good deal, but they are weak as hell.  Find a bartender you like and keep going back.  

Eye candy for days.  I've never seen so many hot bods in one place before.  The waitresses and servers were all extremely friendly and HOT!!!

The bouncers and ticket collectors here were impressive. Professional, courteous and efficient despite the massive amount of people here. Lines moved very quickly everywhere. I'm really impressed with the beautiful bartenders here. The girls were constantly smiling, moved the lines quickly and efficiently, were very calm despite the massive mobs everywhere, made great drinks (not too strong which was a bit disappointing, but good) and very very professional and good looking!

Encore Beach Club maintains that exclusive, sexy, hip vibe by hiring beautiful staff, but they are beautiful staff who really know how to treat their customers. Excellent! Great service!

The Beach Club is large, beautiful, clean, promotes socialization andddd there's nowhere to sit unless you want to drop a lot of money. Literally, not even a wall or bench to sit on.

-The music is top 40 stuff BUT remixed with house/EDM whatever you want to call it. I hate straight EDMy stuff, but I do enjoy the music for the most part
-If you are a girl, get on the guest list! Scour #vegas, #encorebeachclub, etc on Insta and you can easily find 100 promoters. Just be prepared with confirmations. 
-The guest list line is SO LONG if you get here after the promoter tells you do. If you get there super early like 11-11:30ish the line is fine, but any time after, you are standing there for over an hour in the blazing hot sun. NOT FUN. 
-You're not allowed to bring anything in.. no liquids (including travel lotions, etc) and you don't need a towel or anything. I would keep your belongings to a tiny crossbody purse. 
-I think the pool is gross and it probably is gross so I don't go in.. 
-Drinks (the large ones that has the name on it as a souviner) are a whopping $70. They do use top shelf alc, and probably have 4-5 drinks in them. Regular well drinks  (that are quite large) are $20 and again top shelf.

Not feeling Surrender, not really agreeing on its decor matching/meshing with this outdoor area.  They're connected- arent they supposed to be coherent? Beach Club I really like and will be back for Steve Aoki on Fridays- of course, I'm going to be outside the whole time. 

Yeah crowd was very mellow. At least for us, we were mellow more because of the DJ. BF and I sat down to listen and nitpick. If you are music listeners like us and have DJ gear at home, you would see that there was some that was not working nor was the song selection the best in creating a ""mood""....it was scattered. There was moments where we liked what we picked, but it was shortlived as something usually, the song choice or mix in that we were not feeling.

I know Steve Aoki well and if it's one thing that guy does well is create a coherent set and works crowds like no other so the vibe will change once he is here. I know I will be found in the forefront by the DJ booth going apeshit. He's a little dose of home and the club scene in LA I love. Oh and Kasade is the resident for Sunday afternoons. Thats a pretty big lineup they have going here and am excited about. Fuck Paul Oakenfold Perfecto.

i must say, sometimes it sucks to be a guy. the ladies get in free everywhere, especially if they know the right people. knowing the same type of people only gets you to the front of the line. at 50 a head, you'll find two types of guys here: the rich, older men with photo-shopped pecs [because it just doesn't seem natural], and the extremely well-connected people. i don't fit in either. you suck it up, bite the bullet, and enjoy the scenery.

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall ""cages"" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

They're making so much money on table/cabana rentals and alcohol sales -- they really can't make it easier for people to get water? There are like two water fountains tucked away in the back near the bathrooms, nowhere near the action. It's really irresponsible of the owners/managers to not make it easier for people to have access to drinking water.  Security is a little insane, which I get honestly and did make me feel safe -- but to go through all that trouble to have tight security so no one can bring cannabis or drugs in for safety and then make it so difficult for people to drink water is oxymoronic. I saw the staff was really trying to keep up with litter on the floor, but it was hard with so many people inside - I felt bad for people walking around without their shoes on stepping on grossness.

Right after my and my sister got in, we went to the bathroom. Because the line was long, my sister went into the same stall as me. But I want to stress that EVERYONE had multiple friends in the stalls, not just me and my sister. The stall next to me and my sister were extremely loud and banging on the walls.

But at least give a warning about it, not just kick us out after waiting 1.5 hours in line to get in. ALSO why didn't they kick anyone else with 2 people in the stalls out, who were being extremely loud? My sister and I were literally going to the bathroom, nothing else.

After paying $50 for tickets and waiting in a smallish line at 11am on Friday, we got in. It was beautiful! We instantly were attended to by a friendly staffer who took our towels and then proceeded to tell us we were free to put them on the ground or on the concrete benches surrounding the plants. Wha? No lounge chairs? Well, if you want to spend a $150 drink minimum for the lounge chair, this place might be for you. I couldn't do it. We had just come from a beautiful pool over at the Wynn hotel with quite comfy, free lounge chairs and nice music. 

So, we grabbed a seat near the water on the concrete next to another couple that was equally as pissed about the lounge chair situation and just sat there and people-watched for about 4 hours. We did grab some food- I had the Asian chicken salad which was phenom. At least that was worth it!

The pool itself was gorgeous with beautiful decor. You just know it is a Wynn property from start to finish. Attention to detail was all there. Gorgeous. That being said, I also enjoy the Hard Rock pool and Palms pool immensely and feel like I have definitely had more fun at those two venues than I did at the Encore Beach Club.

You definitely need to claim a spot the moment you get in, because the place gets packed pretty quick.  It was our friend's birthday, so she made sure to get all the arrangements together before we even got there.

The drinks here are strong, which is good because so are the prices.  But with the help of a little pre-game and a couple drinks from the bar, you should be straight.

The music is awesome!  That is if you like House Music.  But honestly, if you go to Vegas and not expect to hear House, you're freakin' crazy!  The DJs here have some great remixes.  If you want to see a bunch of people go crazy in a pool to some bumpin' music, go to Encore Beach Club!

If you're not getting a cabana then show up early and claim a spot by the planter boxes or the pool sides.  People essentially lay claim to places to sit by throwing their towel down by the planters or along the water edges.  Smart move for anyone not in a cabana.  Bring credit, cash or krugerrands gold coins.  Seriously, bottled waters $21 each.  A friend got a bottle of grey goose for $950, also ridiculous, but when in Rome yada yada.

There's a gift shop in the back that sells sunblock, cameras and accessories.  The cafe has basic food items on the menu, don't expect much, you're not there for fine dining.  It also doesn't hurt to blend in by having a Jersey Shore tan and washboard abs...apparently everyone there has a crazy amount of free time to tan and hit the gym.

Water is $7 btw. ALSO, print your tickets to get into the venue! I went at 11:15am and there was a short line. 

WHAT TO BRING&NOT/LOCKER SITUATION:
My BF and I ended up bringing a backpack with extra clothes and our personal belongings. We rented a locker for $40 . We had access to come back and forth to grab things. There are bag checks for $30 but you can't go back to get your stuff, which was ridiculous! If you happen to find an area to sit, you can put a towel there to hog the seat area with ur sandals or shorts/tank. If you don't intend to go into the pool, you can part and hang with ur purse with you but I got a locker so I could go into the pool and not risk getting my stuff stolen. You can't bring any liquids including eye drops. Sunscreen is okay. 

TIPS: Make sure you hog a spot with the free towel you get from the venue. You won't regret it. 
Bring waterproof cases for phone and camera.

On that level, I'm fighting a losing battle with places like Encore. But if you take it for what it is, and are willing to play the game, you can still have a great time. There are lots of suggestions here in the reviews for making the most of your experience here if you don't already have the fabled Vegas hookup.",hVXJ8ag9djpzQqvd6jvNTw,3,4,4,n2Kl42mrCnLQhGS5DrkwZQ

Make sure you have no candy/gum and such at security, they will make you throw it out. There is also a locker room area if you want to lock up your valuables while you go party in the pool. 

We came here one Saturday afternoon and Kaskade was spinning. It was a really chill Saturday after a very long Friday night out in Vegas. There is a ""stripper pole platform"" in the middle of the pool with sprinklers to encourage the ladies to shake it in front of everyone- just remember to keep your clothes on-- but don't worry, the staff will stop you from going ""crazy"". 

The Beach Club here gets super packed. It's a fun and laid back club where you can get some sun and good music in. The drinks here are pretty standard Vegas prices- so prepare to spend some $$$. We ordered cold mojito like drink and it was very delicious- we really liked that it came in a closed cup so we could bring it in the pool too. Overall everyone here is super chill and fun. Ladies, just watch out for the aggressive creepy guys, but hey that's pretty standard at any club or Vegas establishment.

- you can get food, and it's actually not that bad.. considering that you'll prob be hungover when you get to EBC anyway

Pro:
Do you like pool parties? This is the place for you. It's huge and visually attractive, with loud music and a lovely pool. 

Con:
The drinks are absolutely absurd, and that includes water. The drinks themselves are way too stiff and sweet, and several people collapsed due to dehydration in the pool. The alcohol and pool water make you feel like you are fine, when you are actually dehydrated or about to suffer heat stroke. One of us got a virgin mojito (same price as a regular) to keep ourselves hydrated.

As for people, there are attractive and unattractive people there, so if you are looking for a particular crowd, this might not be what you are expecting, or as easy to spot as you'd hope (for either gender).

Finally, the DJ of the day (The Chainsmokers) appeared hours late. It was particularly shitty because it was absolutely sweltering and we had been waiting to see them, but literally could not stay due to health risks.",muNBd72RI-WhHLlwIYaWRA,3,1,2,A-hTwQ-rvgHL-giEMyFYnw

-------------------
You have to hand it to the Wynn empire.  He has figured out a way to print money, aside from the casino, the buffet, the hotel rooms.

Why would anybody want to pay extra to sit by a pool, drink $12 Dos Equis, and pay $2000 and up for a day bed?
Because there is a lot of talent, that's why.  A LOT of talent, if you catch my drift.

Our hostess was perfectly bronzed and toned, and she would frequently check on us and make mixed drinks for us.  Of course, this was for our buddy's bachelor party, so if he wants to go to a dayclub, eat and drink on a day bed, and check out the talent, then so be it.  

It was basically like spring break, with talent dancing in the ""dancer's"" pole / rain shower islands, and Redfoo from LMFAO rockin the crowds. 

I will say, we all had a pretty good time (some of our party had too good of a time and had to be snuck out before they were escorted out by the bouncers).  That is, until we had to settle the bill.  So the way it works is, once you get the daybed, they're gonna charge you the $2000 anyway, and you order any combination of food and drinks.  The problem is, they don't tell you when you hit your $2000, and unless the cardholder cuts off your group and requires prior authorization, the bill can keep running if anybody in your group keeps asking for additional food / liquor items.  Hence the $5000 tab.  

All in all, it was fun, but don't forget what I told you (the cardholder has got to demand prior authorization for additional items once the $2000 limit is reached), otherwise no happy ending for you.

Positives:
- It's super fun when the beat drops and everyone splashes in the pool
- If you're hungover from the night before, this is a great place to just relax in the hot vegas sun, especially if you come earlier before the crowd gets in
- You don't really need to prep much for Encore (okay maybe a couple months of intense work outs at the gym), but just put on your swim suits, lather up on some sunblock, and you're set, even if you're a girl. 

Negatives:
- Ordered 2 AMFs each $17, and lets just say, I wasn't saying Adios to anybody. :/

They have three pools with round beds with umbrellas in the shallow area to reserve.  In and near the pools are islands with poles for girls, or guys I guess, to dance on that also spray a shower down.  There's a hot tub with a water wall.  The pools are surrounded by lounge chairs and beds that are available by reservation.  Along the west side of the Beach club are two stories of cabanas.  They are away from the crowds to get your privacy, but close enough to still be a part of the action.  I saw three bars and two sets of bathrooms to alleviate the normal ridiculous lines you get elsewhere.  They also have some blackjack and craps tables set up in the elevated bar area that's air conditioned but still open.  There was a sort of snack bar area you could walk up to and order salads, sandwiches, wraps, etc and not have to try to flag down a waitress.  The setup was well thought out and addresses the issues the other pools lack in.
The service was outstanding!  I was blown away by how friendly and helpful the staff was.  The bartenders had no problem blending up frozen drinks (another bartender at another pool told us this weekend he couldn't do that for us since it was busy even though its on their menu).  When we walked in, every single employee told us welcome, or thank you for coming.  It felt really nice to know that they were appreciative of the obscene amount of money we were all about to spend there.
What is even more awesome, they have Kaskade playing there every Sunday.  If you don't know who Kaskade is, he is an established house music producer and dj.  So expect to hear some dance music when you come here and not hip hop.  The opening dj played more of top 40 remixes.

We got in no issues and, because we're not ridiculous enough to lay out thousands of dollars for cabanas or pool lounges, we just left our stuff in a little area near one of the many palm tree circle lounges in the club. I strongly suggest you purchase one of those waterproof pouches for your valuables and just carry them- otherwise your shit might get pilfered or lost.

I went with a group of girls for a girls' weekend. On the bright side, it was an experience I'll never forget and am really glad we went. That being said, once is enough and I wouldn't go back. 

The good: 
- The pool truly is beautiful. The waterbeds are so cool and offer shade.
- The pool is heated. 
- Despite how crowded it was, there was never a long line to the bathroom. (Well, hopefully this was good assuming everyone was actually using the bathrooms.)
- Good, friendly service. I accidently left my visa at the bar. I called the next day and it had been returned to Lost and Found. The Wynn was really helpful in returning my lost card. I was so grateful! 
- Some of the best people watching ever. 
- The food at the grill was pretty good. We had chicken strips with fries, ceviche but it didn't come with chips and a chicken quesadilla. They had a decent menu with fresh salads and more. 

The bad: 
- Long lines to get into the pool.
- There aren't any lounge chairs or chairs available unless pay for a cabana or waterbed. This holds true even if you eat at the grill, you will have to wait for high-top table. There aren't chairs with the table. 
- The bathrooms got dirtier and wetter as the day went on. 

And the ugly: 
- The price - it was expensive to get in about $30 for girls. I heard it was much more for men. A canned beer cost $12. There is not a discount for purchasing a bucket of beer either. 
- Crowds - as the day went on by about 4pm, it was so crowded and loud. It was difficult to even find a place to stand in the pool. It was packed full of people everywhere. 

Tips: 
- Get there early - by at least 10:45 am. It's less crowded the earlier you get there. This means you can pick a better spot before all the people get there. Also, when you get there early there not lines at the bars. 
- If you bring your purse, clean it out - gum, medicine, snacks, drinks are not allowed. Security will take your gum, cough drops, cold/allergy medicine, etc.

We were enjoying our time by the pool, when we noticed the crowd began to have some fun by splashing some water.
We met some nice people by the pool, one of them started to play with her man by splashing a little water on him and accidentally splashed some water on one of the lifeguards. the amount of water was minimum, close to nothing, but the lifeguard was not pleased by it. She rudely asked them to get out of the water. (DO REMEMBER we are at a pool, and the lifeguard should always expect to get wet. also, it's a pool. Am i suppose to just stand there and NOT touch the water?)
The lifeguard instantly got down from her post, and started to approach the woman aggressively asking her to step out of the water. The woman who was told to get out of the water agreed to leave with her friends, and as they were walking out we noticed the lifeguard lady rushing her! RUSHING HER! This lifeguard (I believe her name was Liliana Silva) ran towards her as if she was going to hit her! The woman was leaving with her party, she was cooperating with security so I was amazed that the Encore would allow their staff to act so rudely. The woman did throw a shoe in her at defense, which a lot of us agreed we would've done the exact same thing under those circumstances. If she would have not defended herself, the lifeguard would've really hurt this girl. She looked so young too!! This made me feel really unsafe about the security of Encore. They were so rude to the woman and her friends when they were clearly not doing anything bad! They did not defend their guest as much as they backed up their staff. We all clearly saw the lifeguard girl acting extremely rude and unprofessional, and they tried to hide it by putting the attention on the actual guest! MIND YOU, THE WOMAN WAS NOT DRUNK AT ALL! As I mentioned earlier, I had made friends with her and her party and took it upon me to make sure they were okay.... well that wasn't possible since the Encore actually kicked them out of the hotel in general!! I would not recommend coming here. It is a very popular hotel, but the security sucks and so does the staff! The lifeguard was extremely aggressive and seemed violent.

My last review of EBC was a few years ago when it first opened and things have slightly changed. It's still a solid pool party but here's the rundown if you decide to get bottle/table service.  The prices all vary depending on your promoter. You're best finding a staff member of EBC to get you table reservations, they have so much more pull with what they can provide you as it's a first come first serve when it comes to location of your table service.  Minimum this weekend was $1k tables and those were for couches far away.   We opted for a Lilly pad (and were quoted about $3K) and lucky for us one of our friends had come early and reserved it. You can choose to get bottles to meet your minimum or you can just do total food and drinks. Patron Silver went for ~$700. Bottles are poured into carafes and then placed into the ice buckets. The mixers were flowing and the ice was changed out often. 

You have to be your own bouncer when it comes to your table/Lilly pad area. Security walks around more than takes care of the reservation areas.  So many bottle rats/leeches, it kinda got annoying.  

Music was ok.  The headliner was actually a nobody (she was an opener for a headliner I saw back in OC 2 weeks prior) and she didn't get on until 4pm.  A little late imo. Be careful of what you do in the restrooms, they got their eyes on you like a hawk!",GQwiY_PvTUtdtnt8cCjmfQ,3,4,4,Vq9sutzDIoRoxN4nQ6hknA

first, you have to pay to get in, thank GOODNESS we didn't have to pay but 20 bucks for a cover? R U serious?!?!? 

second, getting in is one thing then you gotta PAY for everything. there isn't a SINGLE beach chair/space you can sit without paying. R U serious?!?!? so if you don't feel like spending $$$ you end up either sitting on a sofa which is inside (so you cannot get tanned) or just lie on the ground (which some ghetto folks decided to do). 

lastly, i don't think rump shakin' and a pool mix. (mind you these folks CANNOT dance to save their lives and their swimsuits always fit one size TOO small) what's up with poles in the middle of the pool? i get it, it's vegas, but do i really have to look at your ass? 

only thing that saved my day was free mimosa at the bar, liqueuring up definitely helped my tolerance.

next time, i will skip this joint and will be hitting the ""regular"" pool where it's FREE to get in, plenty of FREE beach chairs, and NO sagging ass rump shakin' working the poles.",6kJ-nm1RlbwWF6PMJ7oWJg,4,3,1,s3dTwoyF_xHhMDnJYl9bnQ

Pros:
-Nighttime = no sunburn. For pasty peeps like myself, rejoice!
-Lockers available to store your stuff (no long ""coat check""-style line like at XS during Night Swim). They are $50, have chargers inside for just about every modern phone model, and easily can be shared with a group for saving some moneyz. We had 5 people and it was plenty of room for small purses/outer clothes.
-Pool toys!! From pizza slices to flamingoes, there are all sorts of fun things to play on.
-Staff is proactive with regards to safety and helping out.
-Fantastic DJ line-ups if you like EDM.
-Far bar (past the entrance to the Surrender ""proper"" area) never got crowded and always had fast, friendly service. Huzzah.
-SO MANY MORE RESTROOMS THAN SURRENDER = much more manageable line. 

Cons:
-Water is hit or miss. Last night it was very comfortable; previously it felt tepid at best. You don't always realize how much wind is in LV unless you're wet, looking for a towel at night in skimpy swimsuit. Yikes.

Lines are long for promoters, short for tickets. Come early if you're impatient like me - you'll only have longer to enjoy more pool space!

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.

5463754,2017-06-27,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone.

I miss EBC sooooooooooo damn much. 
Honestly, I don't remember the music at all. I remember hearing some things I can sing along to, then everything just became a blur. 

Here, I find the guys aren't so scary/creepy compared to.. well I can only compare to Wet Republic. It honestly depends where you go but when I was here with a bachelorette party, everyone seemed very nice. I mean yeah, some guys are here to get some, but at least they weren't overly creepy about it. My friend says that people at dayclubbing are not as scary because ""everyone can see everything so they have to have confidence to walk up to you"" LOL I guess.. ehh whatever, point is - this club is just super fun. I LOVED the stripper pole, however the floor is hard to spin around on because of course, they don't want you landing on your ass.

I paid $17 for a strawberry daiquiri, and since I had nothing but chips in the morning, it was able to produce a slight buzz. Yay for my lightweightedness!! I'm not sure how much tables were, but I do know I was drinking out of people's vodka bottles, and those produced a slight burn. So that wasn't Ciroc. The orange juice I remember contained some pulp so that was cool.

The food was pretty pricey. I didn't eat however for a $15? hotdog meal (hotdog/crisscut fries) they give you a good amount - definitely shareable.

I don't remember much about the girls, but yeah this dayclub had super.wonderful.eyecandy the day I went. One of my dares during the bachelorette was to find a woman with fake boobs and ask to touch them. I have problems finding women with fake boobs, so I enlisted the help of a hot guy (which was super easy to find) to help me. I was a happy camper August 3rd. I completed my dare!

The line to get in is hectic and so disorganized, which was the most frustrating part of the experience. You will wait in a line regardless of being on the guest list or having pre-sale ticket. Our bachelorette party had to wait almost 45 min to get to the door.  We were in line to get in, but security kept re-organizing the rope and our group basically kept getting pushed back to the end of the line.  Once inside, your bags were searched and checked. I recommend not bring anything more than your phones, ID, and cards. They also make you throw away packets of gum.  

The venue itself is very spacious and well designed. There is a large pool in the center of the venue, surrounded with daybeds, cabanas, tables and a stage in front of the pool.  If you get there early, there is no need to buy a cabana or daybed, as there are plenty of spots to lay your towels and flip flops around the pool (granted if you have a friend to guard your spot all day!). Towels are provided and you can purchase a locker for $20.

It doesn't take a genius to see that it's actually one of the more efficient methods, unless people are REALLY THAT cheap, but online tickets were only $30.00 for girls and with purchased tickets you're always guaranteed to get in unlike getting on a promoter's list-- which is a 50/50 if it's a trending DJ. The pre-sale ticket line is also always no line (because apparently everyone just wants to get in for free at the promoters line). Also, come early around 10:30AM so you can have the pool to yourself for at least an hour or so.

We were there for The Chainsmokers (we came at 11AM, left at 3:30PM and still the Chainsmokers weren't on) and forreal, they let in more people than necessary that I eventually felt like a sardine in a can. It was hard to walk without being stepped on, bumped into, drink spilled on, etc. and there's little to no shade for patrons that didn't purchase tables/cabanas-- which is usually 90% of the crowd. The security wouldn't even let us put our stuff on the floor (near an umbrella because honestly it's hot AF, a little shade is nice) because apparently it belongs to the cabana/tables area within the 20 feet around it so they kept kicking people's and our stuff to the edge of the pool (even though the cabana table wasn't even purchased yet, it was empty).

The only area that's shaded is the bar and because of that, that area gets crowded AF and gross. The bartenders were very diligent and efficient though having to deal with SO many people. Shots were $21.50 per shot + $5.00 tip. DENG. Shit was ESSPENSIVEE!

You know it would be nice if the club just provided more FREE shade for the rest of the people that's attending the event. The guys in our group had to pay $110 (even at online presale tickets) to get in (poor male species at Vegas LOL), you think that would be something to consider for whoever owns Encore.

I mean Encore is ridiculously nice already but to open this pool party area that has 3 different pools, a bunch of bars, a food section, cabanas, and a sexy pole you really can't go wrong here. 

We were on the guest list because my friend knew someone that worked there- of course always trying to get the hookup anywhere in Vegas and we we got there on a Saturday afternoon all the girls got in free (6 of us) and our one guy friend paid 20 bucks.  Not bad at all considering other pool parties general admission is usually 40 bucks.

Its a very tame pool party tho- drinking beer and just chillin.  There was an area by the pool that we could sit so just because we didn't want to pay 100 bucks for a single lounge chair we weren't assed out. 

I had a really good time people watching, drinking, splashing in the pool.

You dont go to Vegas pool clubs for a relaxing afternoon with the new Nicholas Sparks novel.  You go to Las Vegas pool clubs:  to galk at scantily clad skanks and their douchebag male counterparts, get shit faced on the most impossibly expensive drinks this side of Dubai, get a tan, and drunkenly splash around whilst wilin' out to pretty horrible pop/hip-hop/house.

Thats it, and there is no nicer place in Vegas to do just those things. Service is unmatched, the facilities are amazing: it is huge, so big that it doesnt get crowded, and overall was a shockingly good time. A sheer luxury oasis tucked in between Vegas' two nicest hotels.

We ponied up for a pool side cabana, and the service was impeccably provided by outrageously hot girls with great bikinis. 
The crowd was friendly, and exactly as douchey as you'd expect. Be prepared to drop at least $2k on a a cabana (but that is just drinks and food, no fee for the actual cabana itself)

If you want to go to THE Vegas pool party, this is where you want to go.",1hJJXtCULGN8NT2dQtYbMg,3,3,5,lzdmRCnWuyfn6gZJ9MJrTg
5593905,2016-09-29,3,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"EBC... World famous right? Well, they need to take a cue from the Hakkassan group in how they organize their pre-sale ticket lines cause it was no use buying pre-sale EXPEDITED ENTRY tickets when there was no advantage to that at all. We still had to wait in a ""guest list"" line. The wait was about an hour for EBC at Night featuring Marshmello. It was a bummer for sure. No one knew where to direct us where to go. We asked several staff and some security and the answer as to where to go was vague. Even the group behind us in line, who had the same type of tickets, had the same issue on not knowing where to go. Staff except one person that finally noticed our ticket type got us in but at that point we had been waiting in line so long that our IDs had been checked twice already... SMH. The general admission line was moving faster than ours. That should never be IMO.

I've been to almost all the Vegas clubs and mega clubs so its just not sour grapes on my part. They really need to organize theirs.. I know EBC is probably the biggest capacity pool party but still. It was unacceptable. We have friends that work/dj in some of the well known clubs in town and when I told them the wait time, they were shocked... That's what happens when you dont get bottle service for once, I guess... But that line wasnt moving much faster than ours either.

It's a big space. Lots of room to walk around. Sound system is great. Marshmello was pretty dope. He def brings the energy and gets the crowd moving. But the experience of the line was such a hassle especially when you pay more for EXPEDITED ENTRY which turned out to be more DELAYED ENTRY than anything.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,3,3,3,YW__rLLgHDWyXOtmgrVMCQ

There's nothing to hide here people, it's all hanging out in the open for everyone to see. Whether it's real or fake, jiggly or not jiggly, you'll see it for what it is here.

Pool parties in Vegas are awesome. They are a hella (whoa! i just said hella) good time and I honestly prefer to get chocolate wasted at the pool than at any crowded nightclub in Vegas. Of course when you make a weekend in Vegas, the plan is usually to party all day then party all night. I tend to not make it out 100% alive after a day at the pool, but this past time I managed to do it. 

It was my friend's bachelorette party and we had about 18 girls with us. We all got in for free and partied in a cabana which had a balcony with a great view of the empty lot that was once Stardust. It didn't matter, it was nice to have to place in the shade with couches and free alcohol to drink. Some guys our girls knew had a cabana and allowed all 18 of us to hang out and drink their Goose. I drank in the cabana, partied in the pool, and don't remember much of the walk home. 

EBC is really nice compared to some of the other pool parties I've been too. It's crowded, which is a good thing, but not the point where it's uncomfortable. The pool is clean, the area is clean... I wouldn't expect anything less from a nice hotel like the Encore. We got there at 12 and it was already jam packed so I suggest getting there earlier than that.

Day drinking in Vegas is AWESOME! Even if you don't make it out at night, it's okay. Nightclubs are overrated. Pool Parties are where it's at! ;)",3jjiY5D7oIlKeiCIZGHQew,12,6,5,qoPd-bfoX873LxTI-hOtYw

5622624,2016-05-16,5,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"For as much as we love both Vegas & dance music (a match made in heaven), it nonetheless took us quite a while to visit Encore Beach Club - which by & large seems to be touted as the gold standard for daytime partying in LV. 

The experience was mostly thumbs-up, with a few observations for improvement:

_____________

+ Even in less-than-stellar weather, the venue itself is very beautiful. It carries the same cream & red color scheme found inside the Encore casino and extends that same aesthetic into an outdoor venue. The feel is very upscale & posh - a significant upgrade over the ""rebranded YMCA pool"" look featured at Wet Republic, EBC's supposed rival. 

+ There's a fair amount of plush seating to lounge out at, regardless of if you've got table reservations or not. These seats are comfortable & well-padded, too, and other partygoers were more than willing to make room to accomodate our crew and I, which I greatly appreciated. Surprisingly, this minor touch of practicality is a major upgrade over virtually any other dayclub in Vegas except Drai's; (again looking at you, Wet Republic) more often than not, free seating is nonexistent altogether.

- While I'm on the subject of practicality - I was a little disappointed to learn that Encore doesn't offer complimentary tap water to club patrons. Marquee & Drai's remain the only two dayclub properties to offer this common convenience - and honestly, it shouldn't be that much of a debate! If you keep people hydrated, they're only going to be more inclined to drink more alcohol...and more alcohol = more profit! Given, these kinds of places are all about the bottom line, so I doubt this policy will change in the near or distant future.

+ On the flipside of things, EBC does provide complimentary towel service, which slightly offsets the financial hit that you'll take from dropping wads of cash on drinks & Fiji all day. Not an equivalent savings, but I suppose that it helps...

Beers were about $12 each. I suppose that that's standard Vegas party pricing, so not much to complain about on my end. 

_____________

- It was a pretty big shocker for our group to learn that Alesso wouldn't be performing as scheduled (and this was quite an unfortunate turn of events given that we planned pretty much our entire first day in Vegas around seeing him). Through a brief chat with the club's staff, I learned that it's really not uncommon for headlining talent to cancel at EBC...sad to say the least.

The DJ who subbed in for him did an okay job, but we had already shifted our focus away from the dancefloor. Thus, I can't really comment on the overall experience of seeing a headlining DJ at EBC. 

_____________

+ We had the fortune of befriending some cabana-goers during here; the cabana experience really felt like the royal treatment, to say the least. 

For one thing, they're quartered off separately from the rest of the venue. Looking for a little privacy? Boom, you got it. There's even balcony access, enabling you to indulge in a view that overlooks the street traffic passing by Encore. Due to the casino's position a bit away from the core of the Strip, there's not much to look at out there - but the fresh air and elevated view really make you feel like you're getting the VIP experience. 

Drinks were seldom left unfilled, and the cabana had a steady stream of liquor/beer/bottled water at all times. Service was very attentive and prompt. The cabanas also feature plenty of plush, comfy seating for when your tired legs need a breather from the dancefloor. 

____________

This really feels like a grown-ups' sort of pool party. Minimal shenanigans, good vibes, and a sophisticated approach towards dayclubbing. We'll be back...just not on any day when Alesso's scheduled to perform!",Hv3vaKQGK71sLei7hQs9og,9,4,4,HjdPw_fvpLda9x2RmsgIkA

Dayclub
- Free on guestlist before 11:30AM for men, and 1PM for ladies, however the main DJ doesn't come on until 3:30-4PM, so if you don't like waiting around listening to repetitive house music for hours, it's probably more worth it to just pay general admission and come closer to when the DJ comes on
-Cheapest table option is a lily pad which is about $2000 including gratuity
-Don't forget to wear sunscreen or you will get burnt!
-Beer starts at $14, liquor starts at $20

Nightclub
-Don't assume EBC at Night is the same as nightswim, we found that out the hard way; EBC at Night means its just a regular nightclub and the pool is closed off, if the title of the event includes Nightswim in it online, then it's a pool party (we got confused because our promoter called it nightswim so we showed up in casual clothes)
-Girls usually get drink tickets which can be used for vodka or champagne until 12:30AM

Attended a Kaskade afternoon show at the Encore Beach Club.  First lets get this out of the way, its EXPENSIVE!  if you don't feel like you can drop a few hundred dollars, go somewhere else in your price range rather than going to EBC and complaining about it.

First off, tickets get more expensive as the date gets closer, so if you plan ahead and purchase tickets for a show when you know you will be in Vegas get the tickets early.  When I first looked up the cost for Kaskade tix they were $60 for men.  People who bought at the door the day of the event it was $150. Plan ahead!

Get there nice and early, grab a few drinks and find a great spot on the side of the pool so you can just hang and keep your feet in the water and enjoy the show and the sights.  Tip- sit nearby a bar and open a tab when you first get there, introduce yourself to the bartender you open the tab with and get to know them. Go back to them every time you order and they will hook you up big time when it gets packed and the bar is 6 deep. They will see you in the back of the crowd and with simple eye contact you can get your drinks before anyone else. Our bartender last weekend was Mike, did a fantastic job.  Don't stiff them on the tip, they go out of their way to hook you up, so pay it back with some cash.

Warmup DJ did a nice job building the music as the crowd started to fill in and then started to get loose with their drinks. By the time Kaskade came on the place was ready to explode, which it did.  Kaskade did a great show, played off of the crowd and mixed in a wide variety of music.

It was a LONG day, so make sure you bring sunscreen and drink some water (not just booze).  Also, they are very strict about what they allow in, so just bring a bare minimum. I had sunglasses, my phone, 1 credit card, license and room key. Read the website before you go to make sure you will not lose anything (there are some strange things not allowed, like eye drops).

We had purchased our tickets online specifically to see Zedd who had canceled, which was not even as upsetting to us as was our experience with a security guard named Jason at the door.  We drove out from California at the crack of dawn straight to Encore Beach Club and upon arrival, unbeknownst to us, my sister's ID was expired and we were told by Jason that the only way in is with renewal verification from the DMV.  Understandably, we pulled away to the side and handled the matter through the California DMV's online services and printed the necessary DMV verification at the Encore hotel business center.  We then went directly back to Jason, while another security guard, Michael, stood next to him as we provided Jason the necessary documentation to allow my sister in.  Jason, without hesitation, rejected us while Michael believed it was sufficient verification and took the documentation with him to a manager to further verify.  As we waited, we told Jason Michael was very nice and for his efforts we planned on tipping him and then jokingly told Jason he wanted us to ""bend over backwards"" for him, meanwhile, Michael had obtained approval to allow us in.  Because of Jason's lack of sense of humor and probably upset that we were tipping Michael, he told us we weren't allowed in and impulsively, through his radio, notified the rest of the crew not to allow us in.  I'm very upset that for no other reason, other than Jason being a complete ASSHOLE (for lack of a better term) we weren't allowed into the venue.  I understand that there are policies and procedures to follow, but when they involve managers being on board with a security guard being an asshole to the business' patrons, that is perhaps something upper management should look into.  Worst experience ever in Vegas!  We ended up going to Drais beach club where they didn't even ask twice about the DMV verification and we had a blast, which only goes to prove that Jason was just a jerk.",HPuOtoYO0fD-FXC2VeYIWw,6,4,1,FYJivvKkk-6qNQe4aCoAIg

Ladies can get in for free if they get on a guest list and wake up super early to get in line. This can be quite difficult if you were partying really hard the night before. I suggest that if you are coming to EBC, that you don't really party too hard the night before. Also, get your tickets really early gentleman, as they sell out and are more expensive at the door. So my ticket with fees was almost $90 purchased online. I feel like as though I purchased admission to Disneyland.

There are several different lines to this venue. Look for the signs.....I was neither VIP or renting a cabana, so I ended up in General Admission. Since my lady friend had to line up in the guest list line, I was there at EBC super early. The gates open at 1030am. If you have a ticket, they just scan your ticket at the door. Then, they search you and any bags that you may have. Eyedrops are not allowed and will get confiscated. You should check the list of prohibited items that are not allowed before coming here.

The first thing you should do is get a place to sit immediately! All the prime spots will be snatched up quickly. Since I was there super early, I was able to find a prime location. However, people are quick to encroach in your spot after a couple of drinks. I was here to see Kaskade. He didn't disappoint, although it took forever for him to play his set.

Drinks are ridiculously priced. Water is not complementary either. Drinks were $19 each and water was $10 for a tiny Fiji bottle. I think you have to at least experience EBC once while in Vegas.",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,7,2,4,aziNHvClP4BMG4LvJiKWyw

So there I was, this past weekend: properly liquored up and inhaling some pretty delicious chicken quesadillas (yeah, I go to dayclubs for the food).

5840345,2016-06-26,8,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"I would give this place a negative million rating if I could. My friend and I purchased pre-sale tickets several days in advance. We arrived at the club almost an hour before midnight so we could get in for sure and scope out the place before it gets super packed. We wait in the security line and get searched, have our ids and tickets checked, and got all the stamps and everything. We are then granted entry into the club and all seems good.

My friend and I then go sit in the pool for about 10 minutes, then we decide to get a locker for our belongings. We walk over to the locker area and begin buying a locker at the payment kiosk. 

During the 90 seconds it took me to complete the purchase of the locker, my friend disappeared like a ghost. I walk over to the locker to put my phone in but then realize my friend is nowhere to be found. I start calling him and eventually we talk on the phone and he says he got ejected from the club.

I walk over near the exit which is right next to the payment kiosk to look for him and we wave at each other. He is indeed outside of the club maybe 20 feet from me being denied to return to the club. I start enquiring as to what had happened and why my friend had been ejected as I was standing right next to him and there was no commotion, violence, or anything.

At this point the real fun began. I asked if I could speak to the manager as there must be some kind of misunderstanding. We got through security, had no weapons, no contraband, didn't yell at anyone or hit anyone, we just purchased a locker and somehow my friend was ejected before I had a chance to take a deep breath.

As I began to enquire more what had happened and if I could speak to the manager. The security gentlemen at Encore Beach Club began yelling at me that I had to stop asking questions and either go further into the club or they would eject me as well. At this point I was just baffled. I continued to ask them what had happened and to speak with someone higher up. They were not having it, and they began grabbing and yanking on my arms and my shoulders vigorously without my consent as they shoved me out of the club. I couldn't believe that I was being assaulted and battered by several security staff at an establishment I had paid for and had not been at for more than 30 minutes. 

I know what you're thinking; they don't just kick people out for nothing. You guys must have been doing something, yelling, smashing stuff or something. Well you'd be sadly mistaken. I have never experienced the kind of disrespect and inability to resolve simple customer disputes as I did that night at Encore Beach Club. What happened to customer service? What happened to ""the customer is always right""?

I'm sure some people have a good time at this club but knowing the mentality with which they operate it now, I will never be returning to here or anything under the Wynn name again. 

My advice is to not ever go here. They are willing to take your money, take more of your money, then eject you without reason or explanation and CRIMINALLY ASSAULT and BATTER their peaceful, paying customers. 

These people are a disgrace to the Wynn organization and the entire hospitality industry. I was criminally assaulted and battered by their personnel. They will be hearing from my attorney to say the least.

5862193,2012-08-27,3,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"I apologize for the length of this review, but accurately explaining their appalling lack of courtesy and organization is no small feat. An experience at the Encore Beach Club can only be explained as an expensive, infuriating trip through airport security.

Maybe I was spoiled by the amazing service everywhere else during my stay at the Encore. Maybe I'm the unreasonable one for expecting a consistent level of service throughout the same company. Everywhere else in the Encore (including the other clubs) has amazing service. At the Beach Club, it's a borderline police-state.

Me and my girlfriend spent the previous day at the Encore's European pool and had a blast. We also went to the Encore's nightclub, XS, the night before and had a great time there as well. I expected the Beach Club to be a hybrid of these two positive experiences, but the end-result was the worst of both worlds.

When we showed up at 2pm, pre-purchased tickets in hand, we were surprised to see that there was only two lines; one for cabanas, one for all other guests, no expedited line for hotel guests and/or ones with advance-tickets. We had to wait in line for almost an hour.

There is only one sign while you're in line which warns you of the pool's policies: ""no illegal drugs allowed"". In case you can't read, the manager, Alfonso, reinforces the point with an indiscriminate TSA-esque verbal berating of everybody waiting in line. There were no other signs posted about any other policies.

Once we got through that line, we encountered an unexpected baggage inspection of my girlfriend's purse. This is nothing like the Encore's nightclub, XS, which had no bag-inspection whatsoever. The inspector said that the purse had to be checked at the baggage claim for $10. We had to wait in line at the baggage claim for about 15 minutes to do this.

It should also be noted you basically can't have any pills in your bag. If you're on any medical regiment requiring pills being taken at a specific time of the day, you're out of luck. It's easier for them to assume that everybody is addicted to opiates than to show any level of accommodation.

We finally get into the party. It looked like it might have been fun, but honestly, not fun enough to overcome our frustration with their whole set-up. The place was crowded, and was composed of over 75% guys. What few girls that were there would segregate themselves into their own cliques and there was very little interaction between the two sexes; very similar to a middle-school dance.

We get to the bar (15 minute line there). I order a round of drinks and ask to charge it to the room. The bartender says I need to show my key to do so (out of all the Wynn bars where I charged drinks to the room, this was the only place to require my room key; of course, no warning of this inconsistency posted anywhere). The key was left in my girlfriend's purse in baggage claim, so we had to go back there and wait in line another 10 minutes to get the bag. Out of frustration, we left after this.

On the way out, I asked to speak to the manager and was referred to Alfonso, who was socializing with a content group of girls. When he saw that I was waiting to talk to him, he asked what I wanted. I said ""I'd like to talk to you when you have a minute"", in a polite but clearly irritated tone. He told me to wait by a nearby tree. He then walked off with the group of girls and continued their trivial chit-chat (my girlfriend overheard their conversation and confirmed it didn't regard a serious matter whatsoever). After unsuccessfully waiting 15 minutes for their conversation to finish, I finally gave up and left for the European pool.

All-in-all, I wasted $60 and two hours for the privilege of waiting in countless lines and being treated like a felon. No drinks were ordered, no music was enjoyed, nothing.

I understand that this event was open to non-hotel-guests and it creates the potential for undesirables to enter. However, why create the illusion of exclusivity if you're not actually going to be exclusive?

The Wynn is supposed to be better than this. Instead of being a follower trying to emulate the Hard Rock Hotel, it should be a creating an experience strictly aimed at its target demographic. Until then, the Beach Club is simply a bastardization of the Wynn brand.",Fg_7ryqQo4nYXy_uWMIUXA,33,3,1,UdlH2bfEaHGOq1NvxGNZuA

Tip: If you know you are coming here and don't want to deal with long lines, consider purchasing pre-sale tickets.  You get in a quicker, shorter line and the pre-sale price is usually cheaper than at the door.

5884589,2015-04-24,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"We had the BEST time at Encore Beach Club seeing David Guetta perform last Saturday. We purchased our tickets a few weeks in advance to ensure seamless entry into EBC. The club is glamorous, and you will be surrounded by young and beautiful people (especially the lifeguards and hostesses) who are all down for a good time. That's right ladies... it's time to take out that cute and sexy bikini that you've been hesitant to wear to your family vacays! We met some friendly people and chilled with them throughout the day.

+ Arrive EARLY: I cannot stress this enough. There is very limited room for general admission ticket holders - you have the option of either sitting poolside or on one of the few circular benches. There are lily pads, daybeds, and cabanas that you can rent for an insane fee - I'd probably only rent one if I was going for a bachelorette party. We showed up at 11:10 am and there were practically no empty poolside spots. We walked around a few times and were super lucky to find a spot. I honestly don't know how other people who came later in the afternoon even found a spot; it was crowded like packed sardines. If I were to go again, I'd be in line a little before 11:00 am so that I could be one of the first few in the club.

+ Checking bags: They thoroughly search bags and WILL throw out any food and liquids (even my small contact solution bottle). The security guy who was checking my boyfriend's slim backpack told us that the have to check our bag. We went over to the window and I asked the girls how much it was, expecting it to be $10 based on other Yelp reviews. However, they told me it was $25. I asked if we could just take our bag in instead, and they said it was fine. Once we got settled by the pool, I noticed that it was pretty much only girls who had totes or purses. No other guys had bags. It could be possible that they allow girls to bring their handbags, but guys are forced to check them. Bring as little as possible and don't bring a cute bag that you don't want to get wet.

+ Towels: EBC gives a towel to each guest. This towel pretty much will serve as your butt cushion and seat saver when you sit on the edge of the pool. Don't expect it to dry you off at any point during the day, as it will be drenched from water overflowing from the pool anyways.

+ Waterproof phone pouch: I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase a waterproof case for your precious phone before you leave for Vegas. You can get one for ~$10 online. Not worrying about your phone getting wet and being able to take photos while in the pool was amazing, especially if you are like me and take a gazillion pics. 

+ Food & Drankss: Drinks range from ~$15-$20. They do have a little concession stand, but you have to eat your food in a designated area. Our chicken tender platter with fries was $18. You might have to tag team and watch your friends' belongings as you take turns to grab a bite to eat - you don't want to risk someone taking your spot near the pool (patrolling security remove drenched towels aka seat savers later in the day).

+ David Guetta: He did not come out to perform until about 3:30 pm, even though the pool party started at 11:00 am. Everyone went wild and was dancing once he began his set! So much fun. I loved that you could go close to the stage to see him.

Checkin' out EBC when there is a headliner is a MUST while you are in Vegas! After all, who doesn't want to party it up and feel like they're in a music video?",X74Y5LEa4IIczmAfo1ggWg,18,4,5,08j0EFptsifJx58RirYuww

First of all, the layout of a day club is very important--yes, it's a pool party but you need enough space for ""regular people"" (people who don't have tables and cabanas) to rest and chill as well (cough Marquee cough ugh). EBC is huge and you have the Cabanas at the back (two floors), tables in the middle area, and then the lily pads on the poolside. I inquired about the prices for Zedd (Saturday) and the bottom floor cabanas were about $8000USD, tables about $5000USD, and the lilypads about $3000USD--the prices vary depending on the location of your table, time of the year, and also the DJ, obviously. Even though it seems like a lot of money, the money actually counts towards your tables' minimum spending, so technically you're just required to spend that specific amount of money or more on drinks/food/etc, so at least you're spending it for yourself. I love love love the layout of the club, it's gorgeous and super friendly to everyone. Free towels are available. Bag check is available sometimes, which sucks if you're only here with a friend or two, but the larger lockers ($75 for the day) is a good option if you have a big group. The drinks here are super expensive (about $18-20 per mixed drink), but if you just want some water you can get a free plastic cup and fill it up in the water fountain in front of the back bathrooms. 

A sista also got hungry once during the day club and coped herself some chicken fingers and they weren't too pricey but they were freaking everything--honestly I was so hangry these chicken fingers saved my life, LOL. 

The worst part about all the day clubs is that the DJ doesn't come on until 2-3:30pm...usually with guestlist we get in by 12pm and by 3hrs we're sober. So usually the plan is to try and find a table and drink their drinks XD HEH The DJs here are on point, though, you get random ones occasionally but the music is generally pretty good. Lastly, yes, I know tickets can be crazy for the guys (girls are usually able to get in free through guestlist), but hey, you're in Vegas to rage and have fun, don't be cheap, just have a good time.",A06QtUzeJSiDW6MSWp3Jdg,6,2,5,-xQFc4ZIEeeXIZlSP-dLEQ

Basically, one of the bouncers here (Josh) snapped one of our friend's ID's bc he thought it might be a fake. Unfortunately, this was NOT a fake ID. And this friend was visiting from out of state. But not only did he damage a government issued ID, he tried to brush it off as if it was not a problem and told us that the TSA would still let them fly, but we couldn't come into the club. When we asked to speak to the manager of the club so that we could get a written statement, some random guy who was NOT the manager but said he was (Christopher), came over to try and work out the situation. Ultimately we went to the hotel staff and spoke with the general manager to try and work out a solution. It took 2+ hours to get written statements and supposedly Metro was contacted but never showed. The whole experience just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

Here is ultimately my problem. Not only did this guy damage property that was not his, there were NO repercussions, and not only that, there was NO SOLUTION. First off, there is no reason that he should have broken the ID. I mean, aren't there scanners that can check for fake IDs? But fine, it happened. Then what?!?! You're just gonna leave it and NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? We didn't do anything wrong, you did. FIX IT. There was absolutely no accountability on the part of the staff at Encore.

The pool isn't as swampy as other Vegas pool parties in Vegas- thank God! I can't wait to go here again! We arrived there around noon and didn't end up leaving till almost 6pm.

5936008,2014-07-09,0,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"I'm a fan of the pool parties. The  place is huge and the pool is amazing. I really enjoyed the night pool party with all of the fun inflatable toys. Definitely felt like a kid again! The day pool party was really fun, too, and the atmosphere was completely different from night to day. All of the party goers were very friendly (bad crowds always ruin potentially great venues). It was also awesome that they were showing the World Cup game on the big screen before Macklemore came out. Another great thing is that you are given free towels! Every person got 2 free towels for the night party and 1 free towel for the day party. It's nice to know they don't charge for that. Also, great security. It does slow down the line when girls needs to get everything thoroughly checked, but at least I know I'm safe.

Three things I have to complain about. 
-They don't give free water. It's $8 for a tiny bottle of Fiji water (why the fancy water anyways?). I hate when clubs make you pay for water especially when it's 115 degrees out. Marquee gives free iced tap water which I'll totally take over fancy bottled water. 
-The staff working Encore were bitchy. One woman who worked the lines gave attitude when I asked a very reasonable question. The people at bag check were rude, too. Customer service is everything, and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I meet people like this, but I try to not let that affect my experience with the pool itself.
-I was at the night pool party the night before the day pool party. When you check in bags, they give you a trash bag to put your stuff in. The goal is to make sure the trash bag can be closed up or else they will make you pay double for an extra bag. Here's the catch: The night pool party gave me a giant bag, and the day pool party gave me a noticeably smaller bag. The 6 of us were able to fit all of our things in one bag at the night pool party with tons of room to spare, but had to get 2 separate bags for the day pool party. Also, they make you close it up in front of them, and if you cut it close, they stand there and contemplate for a good 10 seconds whether or not they want to charge you $20 instead of $10. 

Overall, I had fun both times, so I'm just going to the let the little things I complained about pass. I've heard from many  people this is their favorite pool, so I'm glad I got to check it out at different times of the day!",vRRZbOGmmO2bi7IPLeurvA,3,0,4,vhnQfZFiz3THrEK7DuRC4w

The place is super clean and all the waitress's are gorgeous and sweet... except for one girl, and unfortunately we had her as our personal waitress.. first she ignored us and made us feel small, she rolled her eyes and was extremely snotty when we asked her to make us a drink she made one drink then left for 30 mins.. We spoke to a manger and asked for a new girl and was first bitched at by the manger telling us we made his waitress cry and we were too demanding.. we never said one word to the girl since we only saw her once then she stayed at this table filled with men and never came back, but still he listened since people are dropping thousand of dollars here and got us a new girl.. we were given Courtney M. She was AWESOME! So beautiful and sweet she was on top of our drinks and was so fun yet so professional. We also had Ryan S. helping us.. this guy was badass! seriously 112 outside and this guy is running around taking care of all tables on our side of the club, he was also very very nice and helpful. The ONLY reason I will be going back is because of those two. They made the 2 hour wait to get in, the insane heat and the bad start.. well worth it! You guys were so awesome!

5941811,2017-04-27,3,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"I've gone here many time and it's always a blast because of the DJs that put on a good show and the crowd who are always so lively and happy. So I can't give it a perfect 5 stars for two reasons - jerk bouncer and expensive drinks. So here's a few things about this place: 

1) Security: If you're a girl, you will likely have NO problems getting in with whatever you're wearing. If you're a guy, you'll probably be fine as long as you read their dress code. If you're a black guy, watch out for the racist asian security guy. He kicked my friend out for wearing cotton shorts. Did you read that correctly? Yes...his Cotton Shorts. They were his swimming trunks that met right at the knee and were apparently didn't look good enough to get in. Mind you, this same friend was let in by two other bouncers (two white males) before reaching the asian male bouncer (his role was to check our tickets? or our purses?). So instead of letting him in, he directed my friend to a swimwear store where the cheapest swimming trunks for men were $85.  Mind you...this is after having waited in line for an hour. People in line actually sympathized and told the security guy that he was being an unreasonable jerk for not letting my friend in. My friend was embarrassed and didn't want to cause a scene so he went to buy $85 shorts (that were basically shorter than mid thigh)...waited in line again, but this time for 30 mins. In the meantime, I was already inside with another friend and we stood by the security line to observe the same security guy...out of curiosity. And what a surprise - in the 30-40 minutes we waited for my friend, no one else was kicked out except one other black male and guess by whom?? Yup by the same asian security guy.  Unfortunately, I wasn't close enough to hear the reason so it may have been a legitimate one...THIS time. But the point of this whole thing is - if you're a minority, try not to give them more of a reason to get rid of you. It's ridiculous, but apparently you do have to be extra diligent because there are still crappy people out there. If you see that asian security guy, be OBSERVANT of him and make sure you make him accountable for any of his wrongdoings. 

2) Drinks/Bartenders: Keep in mind drinks, just like everywhere else in vegas, is approximately $20 a piece, even shots. Unless u get something in one of those souvenir cups, which are DAMN delicious, and that's about $65. I finally ordered one of those this past weekend and it was some kind of blue concoction. Holy cow it was sooo good. It's definitely a must have.  The female bartenders closest to the stage are such sweethearts. I usually expect female bartenders to attend to guys first (because it happens soooo often), but these girls were mindful of everyone and treated everyone equally.  There was a lady with long dark brown hair, somewhat tan (not the asian woman or the blonde woman) didn't catch her name but she was extraordinary.  She was so pleasant and she made amazing drinks that were never watered down.  Definitely tip her well if you see her because she deserves it. I wish water was free (at least allow us to order tap) because when you're there, you're likely to get dehydrated especially considering how long you'll been dancing in the sun. Sodas should be reasonably priced.  They make enough money from their alcohol sales. No need to be so greedy. 

3) Atmosphere: Encore beach club is a super fun place that you HAVE to go to while in vegas. I've lost count as to how many shows I've gone to. Not once have I been disappointed.  Even if u dont get a cabana and stuff, it's still a blast.  Everyone is so social and so much fun.  I guess because the EDM DJs tend to draw a much friendlier crowd.  Even if you see people who seem stuck up, they're really not. Everyone is beautiful and everyone is awesome.  And if you do encounter jerks, trust me...they're nobodies. There are plenty of other people you can party with. 

oh and the bathrooms are super clean. Don't be a douche (you too ladies). Tip the people who are there to help you. $1 wont break your bank.",anKK-Ad5YoYlI2anPMcFxA,4,1,4,NHW9oOipAFyoBMPB_C75gQ

When I finally got inside, it was packed. I had a hard time walking by the DJ area to get to the bar. But the music was great and even though I was there later in the afternoon, I had an awesome time for the couple of hours I was there. Next time I'll make sure to get there early enough.

Someone stole my sandals. Good thing they only cost $15 at Target.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,1,1,4,py1dnq6vMKglEgHZoDgXKg
5965351,2012-04-25,0,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"This is the best pool I've ever been to. I stayed at the Wynn on April 21st and paid $100 for me and $50 for my female friend for tickets the night before. Sunday was opening day with Tiesto. We showed up half an hour before the opening and had a private line for pre-paid hotel guests, ahead of everyone else (who were in a massive line). We were the first ones in at 11 am. A host showed us to a perfect, free spot right along the pool facing Tiesto. Within a couple of hours the place filled up. It was the most attractive crew I've ever seen. Half of the girls looked like models, and my friend was drooling over the guys. We met a great group of people and were able to get within feet of Tiesto to dance. I went to Rehab last year and this blew it away. Far cleaner, nicer, and much more attractive people. I had a huge amount to drink and my total bill was $225. So for $325 (including entrance) to get wasted at one of the best parties I've ever been too....more than worth it, as a special occasion.

fucking love EBC. the line is long as fuck, the cover charge is crazy, but its all worth it. 
One of the best day pool parties in Vegas. It's a must go when you go during poolparty season in Vegas. 

Encore Beach is located in Encore LOL obviously, but also used as Surrender at night. There are multiple pools in the area and a mini casino by the bar and the infamous DJs that play there are usually in front of the pool that is in front of the bar section. 

Pros: 
-Pool is usually refreshingly cool and not freezing 
-bottle service/day beds/ cabanas are plentiful and seated in great places 
-bartenders are gorgeous! 
-lifeguards are pretty amazing too haha 
-chill people to meet 
-music is pumping and amazing everywhere 
-drinks are strong .....and
-THEY SERVE HENNESSY OMG EXTRA STAR FOR THAT I swear no where else in Vegas has it, I almost cried from happiness

Cons 
-the wait in line to get in can be almost two hours long 
-cover charge is ridic, but get on guestlist and get there early , big apologies to the male race lol
-Uhhh literally everywhere is wet, no dry place to put your stuff unless you wanna pay for a locker . Meaning squishy towels ... Forget drying off, your towels will be wetter than you by the time you're done! 
- packed as fuuuuck to the point where I feel like I'm about to fall off walking the pathway to the bar , but whatever more people to meet, right?? 

Overall... Yeah I'm DEFINITELY coming here again.. But way earlier hahahah. I think EBC gets packed rain or shine",5re8RQ-2-Mkz7LC4ftYfHw,17,18,5,InERoXXRm0jui62WWqHBlg
5993131,2015-06-02,2,YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ,"***NOTE*** Unless you plan on buying a table, your good. If not, DO NOT GO HERE!

I'm somewhat indifferent with this place. Only reason I went because a good DJ was playing. (Thats all) First off, GET there early or you will have nowhere to sit whatsoever. Literally, you have to pay to sit almost anywhere here. You cannot even bring in your own sunscreen. If you want sunscreen, you have to pay $30 for it from them. They are very picky on what they let you bring in when they ""screen"" you at the front. They even confiscated my buddies vapor so he couldn't vape. (Not allowed I guess, but cigarettes are ok) It's almost worse than dealing with the TSA agents at an airport.
A bacardi and coke cost $22 and a water cost $11. The place is big and the pools are huge, (towels are FREE) but once again, Don't expect to find anywhere to sit unless you buy a table or lounge day beds for major $$$. 
The pools are really dirty as I opted out not going in them. Cigarette butts, empty beer cups and just trash floating around. The bathrooms are even WORSE! (and thats being nice) I had to walk over puke just to use the bathroom. 
This place is really nothing spectacular to be honest. Overhyped and not all that. I personally think Marquee pool is much nicer (cleaner for sure) and drinks are much cheaper ($14 for Bacardi & Coke compared to $22 here) Nicer staff too.
Overall it was fun hanging out with my friends, but our attitudes were a mere ""MEEEHHH!"" afterwards, nothing impressive about this place.

***UPDATE 6/20/15*** - I was just in Vegas this past weekend for my buddies 30th birthday. He really wanted to go to this place. Being his birthday and he wanted to go here, We went to Encore beach Club at night (Thursday) I wasn't gonna complain as it's a lot less crowded than Friday's and Saturdays. Well guess what? I got Tinea Versicolor (skin fungus) most likely from the dirty rafts in the pool literally the day after we went to this place. Against my instinct I KNEW I shouldn't of gotten in the pool. Now I look like a smurf with a blue antibiotic on my body to kill this fungus. Just CONFIRMS why I hate this place. I did have it at 3 stars, now dropped it down to 2.",iJZz6mZeFqJpetx1wiCIlg,4,1,2,4esqM-NLE6wPAjDWlXPr5w
