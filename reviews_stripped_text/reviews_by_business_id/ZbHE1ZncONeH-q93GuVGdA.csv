I ordered 2 hard shell tacos - buy 2, get one free..now I know why.  The shells were either under cooked or old...tough and not edible.  The tacos were more like  lettuce tacos - it had an abundance of lettuce - little of anything else.

I found a hair in the radishes at the salsa bar which finished off an already bad meal for me.  The salsa bar appeared to be rather dirty..lots of drips and spills.

Surprisingly I've only been to Roberto's a handful of times. One other time I had a Carne Asada Burrito that was delicious and huge. One time I had Rolled Tacos (aka taquitos) another WINNER!

1.  You charged me for something i had asked not to put in.  She then went ahead and said there is no nacho cheese.  You fucking sell nachos there and you tell me you dont have nacho cheese?  Ill be calling the owner about this.

2.  And if you fucking put in something i had asked t take out in the first place why the fuck would you charge me 92 cents to put it back in

Also i asked her whats in the carne asada fries.  She didnt tell me there were veans in it.  If you dont fuckin know whats in it.  Turn the fuck around and ask the fuckin cook.

Carne Asada burrito: size was good. I could not finish all of it. The meat itself was good in flavor and tenderness but the burrito was dry. I was surprised that there was no sauce on or in it.

Carne Asada chimichanga: It's a good amount of food, my wife couldn't even finish half of it. She liked it. It came with sour cream and guacamole on it.

On tonight's drive-thru I asked again (I always ask) and the dude just shook his head no and the automatic window closed. Why is it so hard to have jalepenos in the kitchen for customers who want them.

There are 3 things that make me very happy about this restaurant:  1) you can custom design the ingredients of your burrito, and it still stays cheap;  2) their chicken is shredded and marinated with a light broth, which keeps the chicken meat moist and tender;  and  3) I like their self serve salsa bar, lots of variety of add ons:  sliced radishes, cilantro, onions, jalepeno & carrot mix, limes, green onions, and even diced cucumbers.

This place is just like that. Like other locations the carne Asada is never crispy and a little on the salty side like I like then and the Asada fries....I am forming a sad face now the fries no matter how many times I ask them to fry the fries just so it's more crispy it still comes out soggy when they serve it, with now taste. I think they should salt the fries a little before adding the topping.

This one seems to be upgraded for the area it's in.  Southwestern colors on the walls, tables and chairs that aren't bolted to each other, and an overall aura straight out of the Qdoba playbook.  Staff ability is limited in the English department, but they make a damn good carne asada burrito and rolled tacos topped with guac and cheese.

This Roberto ' s (let's face it Don Tortaco is a silly name) is one of the cleanest and better maintained of the chains. 

People who give this place 2 stars and below because of how loud the place was or how poorly the cashier understood their English are obviously oblivious to the fact that they are not at the Aria's Sage. Don't expect a server that explains your every meal and pairs your horchata with a certain type of meat, that's not what they are, that's not their appeal. Their target demographic is wasted partygoers who cannot function well enough to eat with cutlery and a napkin on their collar. Their goal is to offer food to those at home who can't think of anything to eat and that goes out on a whim (wearing probably  shorts, slippers, a baseball cap, a shirt from target, and a pair of sunglasses) just because greasy fatty food is better than a serving of microwaved leftovers which 's nutritional value has probably long hit the road.


tldr: Kathy P got pissed off about the sound of the COOK chopping FOOD in the KITCHEN, and I had to write a positive and insightful review to counteract her overdramatic and over exaggeration of the negatives of this restaurant.

P.S. DON'T TIP WITH CARD, THE OWNERS SNAG THOSE, WORKERS DON'T RECEIVE ANY OF IT. W T F RIGHT??


Update:
Their service has gone down drastically. I used to frequent this place but now I seldom consider it an option. One of their newest hires is the most bitter and cold-spirited persons (yes that word does exist) I've seen work anywhere in a while. 

Don't get me wrong, I would dread the job as well, but I wouldn't hold the customer at fault for providing the business required for her job to have existed in the first place. I feel like every second I spend deciding what to get as I walk into the door she gets more and more vicious looking. So menacing. 

Anyway, food quality has tanked as well. I was generous with the 4 star from my previous review, and I'll be generous yet again and put it down to 3 instead of the 2.5 I believe they deserve. Enjoy.",Cu3bBnJ8c9a5Fnfn8Cznvw,6,4,3,emhC6ALCIHuxtYmt7Vz37w

Pros:
 * Asada Nachos are still killer!
 * well-kept Sauce stand... It seems like their green sauce was a bit spicier than what I remembered at Roberto's... Score!
 * I don't know if the standards at Don Tortaco are higher than Roberto's, but this location seemed to be really clean.  
 * I liked the selection of drinks.. self serve soda with Horchata and Jamaica too!
 * Lengua and Cabeza on the menu... oh yeah!!!!

Cons:
 * I stated No sour cream (even on my receipt), but low and behold, when my order came out, Escrema was present!
* No Agua De Fresca 

Verdict:
  This place is good for late night eats.  We ordered the Asada Nachos with No sour cream, but they failed and piled sour cream on it anyhow.  Nonetheless, I gave this place a 4 star because it didn't fail to satisfy my late night cravings for cheap Mexican food.

It's a weakness!! I'm a huge fan of the carne asada nachos. They are so big and delicious but I can't order them a lot. It's too much food for me and day two isn't as good.

We have taken our food to go both times and I appreciate that you can pack up your little containers of salsa and limes in plastic baggies so you don't have a big mess by the time you get the food home. They also do a nice job wrapping the tortillas up so that they are still warm when you eat. 

Now onto the food. Not being a fan of Roberto's I was hesitant to try this place but was pleasantly surprised with the carne asada plate I had the first time. The meat was tender and flavorful. The rice and beans are decent, they just need a pinch of salt and a dab of salsa and they are a good side .  The only thing I didn't like was the massively ginormous flour tortilla that came with it. I thought it would be 2 smaller more manageable ones to roll and wrap.  I ended up tearing it into smaller pieces and was good to go. 

This last visit I ordered the pork carnitas plate and had the corn tortillas. Again nice tender meat and the tortillas were very fresh tasting.

     I was in the mood for salad, so I ordered a taco salad. I got carne asada which is beef. It comes with sour cream and guacamole, lettuce, pico de gaillo and beans, some cheese also. Very tasty indeed. The flour tortilla shell was fried in fresh oil, so it didn't have any after taste. To drink I got a Sidral Mundet, it is natural apple soda. I later ordered a Coke. Both are bottled in Mexico. This Coke is special because it is made with real sugar.

They are not selfish with their servings here. I ordered a carne asada fries and burrito and let me tell you, they did not miss even a millimeter of space in that box!

Service here is nice and very clean environment. From what I've been reading on yelp that other Roberto places arent as nice as this one.  Best thing is it's mexicans making mexican food unlike another place i went to where it was asians making mexican food and the other way around.

I waited around 30 minutes for my food and i understand some thing take longer to cook than others, but i saw people walking in and out the door. I went up to the counter to ask how long it would be and then they proceed to hand me my food. I check it and it turns out they're 2 cheese quesadillas. First of all, I never ordered the quesadillas. Secondly, it doesn't take 30 minutes to even make quesadillas? I begin to tell the girl that this is wrong and she argues with me and says she heard quesadilla, which doesnt add up because my boyfriend was with me and heard me say enchilada clearly. People make mistakes I get it, but she didn't want to fix the problem. I'm willing to pay the difference, but then she starts speaking bad about me in spanish to the chef? I know that I appear caucasian, but I am actually hispanic myself and speak spanish fluently. Then they throw together 2 cold enchiladas in less than a minute and i didn't even get the combo which I asked for in the first place. I left unsatisfied with nasty food. Never coming back again. Ever since they changed owners this place has gone down hill.",N1-bfPu1_hUr6nMCg9DOfQ,0,0,1,zAOqNJL51vODMkHi2m8PRw
5659357,2014-04-17,3,ZbHE1ZncONeH-q93GuVGdA,"Don Tortaco is within spitting distance of my place and that's really the only reason I've been here a few times. 

I'm pretty sure this place is exactly the same as Roberto's. Are they owned by the same people? I have no idea, but their menu is identical.

The few times I've been here, I ordered the same thing that I get at Roberto's: chicken nachos. It's a few coins under $7 and is definitely enough for two people... or one person who is down with leftovers. 

I don't know, there's something that is in these nachos that always kinda cramps my stomach so I generally don't eat here unless it's a food emergency and I'm legitimately starving. They're open 24/7 so... it works in a pinch.

It does get insanely busy because they're next door to some sort of school-type tutor place, so be prepared for a wait at certain times.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,4,3,SklSTSehNuknZlXy1ihnzw
5674333,2016-06-24,1,ZbHE1ZncONeH-q93GuVGdA,"Called this place around 7am to order a breakfast burrito. Called 3 times to no answer. It's right around the corner, so I drove there in 5 mins. Two people were working, one cleaning the chairs and one the kitchen. No customers. So I figured they just didn't want to answer since they didn't want to have make food. I ordered anyway, since they are open and getting paid to serve me. They took my order and I tried to pay win my card. The cashier turned the card reader off, I watched it, then swiped my card and immediately looked up to me and said, ""Sorry, we can't help you. The card reader isn't working."" Not asking if I can pay with cash, just ""can't help you."" They REALLY did not want make any food! Very annoying! Just don't be open if you're not going to serve food. Stop wasting people's time. 

Food is pretty good when they serve it though, so I'll give it two stars. Service is horrible.",jkdMtyXTD0o78FzPBZzrxg,3,0,2,5HS0ZWxgbqOnhd7MePJRZw

A few of my favorites are carne asada fries, chorizo and egg entree, and chicken enchiladas. Also every time I've ordered at the drive thru, the customer service has been fantastic. Welcoming every time. The menu is huge for a little place, and everyone is sure to find something to satisfy their south of the border craving.",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,0,0,4,lcqZwP221-gVznAugnCiKg

However, when I got home, I had beef. It is too much of a hassle to go back in there and deal with them. So I'm just deciding to stay as far away from there as possible.

I make up my own taco because I'm a vegan. You should have at least 1 vegetarian option. And the lady had a attitude. You shouldn't overcharge like that. I will NOT be back or recommending ANYONE.

Food is almost bland no real flavors as I think they want you to dump salsa or peppers all over it. 

Taco Bell is right across the lot if you are desperate but you will have to really have a taco craving that cant be satisfied for that.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,0,3,nnHYez6YFFoawjr1rjexaw

(at other locations) Was higher prices by $2 bucks.  I stopped going  to Roberto's because they raised their prices and bow Don's too?  Well idk if it was just this location but the breakfast burrito although good is to small for $5.,XE2Me7TKYBgNwXCgaRrDFg,0,0,2,_JI9gVehICgC8Hg2wkqjYQ
