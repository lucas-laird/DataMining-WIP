I believe they make the bread right there, and it is excellent;  some of the best Mediterranean I've had in this city.  The baklava was sweet and tasty. 
The staff are very friendly, and although the food is cooked while you wait, it is a very reasonable wait. If you like Mediterranean at all, this is a must try.",m305_uyUl6G65VXYJGCv0w,1,1,5,7l-20QL2Zfow-p6YUak82w

272713,2011-11-13,0,K3wUWHOPhAmIJ5naMVzylA,"This place is GREAT! I sometimes eat it almost four times a week. I absolutely love it.

I usually order the Chicken Shish Kabob combo, the number 5, and it tastes just as delicious every single time. The quality of the chicken is phenomenal and it  is SO tender. I love squeezing lemon on my meal and adding the green chutney. So lemony and yummy! 

The rice, chicken, and pita bread combination is out-of-this-world! The pita bread is also freshly baked, so it does take a bit longer. I rather have to wait 10 extra minutes and have quality pita bread than microwave heated pita bread!  I've ordered this meal for my entire family and they all enjoy it as much as I do. THE CHICKEN SHISH KABOBS ARE A GO! I will definitely keep visiting this place again and again. And again...",i-y3RYc1uTk7XlVFxdQrzw,0,0,4,if8mCWKEjw2p7jPD8QgEWQ
356648,2012-12-12,0,K3wUWHOPhAmIJ5naMVzylA,"Is it closed? I went here about a month ago. If it is.... GOOD!  I went there because my kids have been there with their dad. I have always wanted to try it and they begged me to take them. Needless to say, it was extremely disappointing. I LOVE this kind of food, and have been to places that knocked my socks off. This was nowhere near. I placed my order according to what I saw with the pictures on the menu, getting a chicken plate, lamb plate, and beef plate. All total was a little over $30. It took FOREVER (about 25 minutes) to cook my food. We were the only ones in there. Should that have been a sign? FINALLY they finished, and we were hungry because it smelled so good. When I got home and opened the boxes, I was shocked. I watched these guys cook my food. I should have watched them box it up too. OMG there was literally 6 pieces of meat in each container. When they were cooking, each skewer was about 18 inches long and half of it was meat. Where was the rest of the meat that they cooked??? And even my kids looked at it and said the same thing. They go there a lot and said that usually the container is full. UMMM yeah. Even if this place is not closed, I will NOT be going there again. I got totally ripped off!! They were not busy, so maybe they were trying to save a buck.  But I have four kids and I was taking them out for a special treat. We don't eat out that much and they really wanted to go there.  I even left a tip in the jar. Now reading the other reviews, I wish I hadn't.  I am a waitress and it will be a cold day in he-- before my bosses keep any of my tips for themselves.

The girl who took my order (I phoned in) was pleasant and understood me perfectly, as I her.  When I left a $2 tip in the tip jar, she proceeded to tell me those tips are going to the boss. I found that odd and asked why the tips weren't split among the employees and she just smiled and said that's the way it is. I was going to take the $2 out and give it to her. Looks like greed just finds it's way... Anyway, the food was decent. Steak tender with great flavor; rice was colorful, light , and flavorful; baba ganoush DAMN GOOD! The hummus could be a little creamier, but has a nice amount of oil to keep it smooth. Also has a nice roasted, smoky flavor and a little darker than regular hummus. Sliced olives on top a nice touch. 3 stars until I try more food.",1JNqxJr8cDb689up53NGig,1,0,3,j5uCNhHK60ogb1QKqZsTeg

I had the chicken kabob and my boyfriend had the beef - both very tender, flavorful and was just the right amount.  The food was served on a half piece of bread, with colorful rice and lettuce on top of the bread.  Not quite sure how to eat it properly, we just dug in and tore off and ate.  Great service, the food took about 5-10 minutes to come out but I am happy to wait knowing the food is made to order.  We will be back for more!",2lp6FZxr_d_njts1KQks8Q,3,2,4,5uPlnPJmEu057hToPn57WQ

1039355,2010-03-22,0,K3wUWHOPhAmIJ5naMVzylA,"Pretty good. When I walked in the owner was standing in front of the cash register and was talking on the phone, he then got off the house phone and onto his cell phone. All the while, I'm sitting there waiting SEVERAL minutes while I watch my 30 minute lunch break widdle away. I was about to walk out when finally, after literally 5 minutes, the owner finally found time for a customer rather than arguing with a vendor on the phone.  Although he still seemed rather annoyed I was there. 


I ordered the ground chicken kabob and the shirazi salad. The kobob and rice were good. I like Kabob Grill on Sunset & Pecos better, although the portions here were much bigger. The flat bread is made fresh in house, which is a bonus, but the customer service from the owner sucked.

UPDATE 9/10/10:

My coworker loves this place so I figured I would give it another shot. We went in today and both ordered our lunches to go. She received her lunch wrapped up to go in about 10 mins which is normal since everything is cooked to order. Since I had ordered before her I figured mine should be coming up any minute. I waited. and waited. and waited. 

At this point I checked my receipt and it had been 20 mins from the time I had ordered. The manager who had handed my friend her to go bag (different from the manager before) walked towards our table; I figured he was going to give us one of those ""your food is coming right up"" but he walked right past without saying anything. So I waited. and waited.

Clearly my food had to be coming right up since the manager knew I was waiting. I looked to my left and saw a group who had ordered after me all enjoying their food. The manager then returned to the kitchen. I was still waiting. 

After 25 mins I went back up to the counter with my receipt asking when my food would be ready. The girl who had taken my order gave me a look of confusion, blankly looked around the kitchen and then at her manager. The manager also gave a look of confusion and blankly looked around the kitchen. He turned around and there was my food, all wrapped up in bag ready to go, just sitting there. No one had called out my number or bothered to let me know it was ready. They had just set it aside and left me waiting. 

When I said to the manager I had been waiting 25 mins (which he had plainly seen himself) he didn't seem to care. Food is decent but their customer service sucks!",xicLYs-5BIHLKQv8Hhq_ow,1,0,2,nqr6kbV6XR1ycQjMuMHDnw

When I eat any of their beef, lamb or chicken kababs, the first bite into the juicy flavorful meat makes me close my eyes and savor every morsel of it! Don't forget to try their Humus and of course the rice is super good too!

The Middle Eastern family eating close by seemed to enjoy the food as well. This place is looking to branch out to a chain(thus the chain feel) but this is the only one...so far.

I now order the #9 which is a Beef Kubideh wrap.  You can also get in chicken.  It is very similar to a Gyro but must more heartier as the rice is wrapped up in it.  It is important to consume your food as quickly as possible because as it cools the flavor and textures do change.

What I enjoy most is chilling out with an iced tea, eating my meal, chit chatting about whatever and watching the planes land at LAS.

Today I used a restaurant.com voucher.  $25 towards $40 worth of food, however, read on for the unethical practices the owner of this restaurant put in place when attempting to use this voucher...  The restaurant.com voucher is a joke.  The restaurant automatically includes 18% gratuity on top of the bill.  This establishment is strictly counter-service, who is the tip for???  Also, specials are not allowed as part of the voucher redemption and most of what my party wanted was ""considered"" a special.  I felt penalized for trying to use the voucher.  I will never recommend this establishment for their unethical practices and because they made me feel like a piece of trash.  The fact that you have to spend $40 on a $25 voucher is one thing, but to not allow specials and factor in an unethical gratuity of 18% at a restaurant with no servers and strictly counter service shows that this owner has ZERO dignity as a small business owner and he should think twice before trying to lure patrons into an establishment that only allows ""one"" serving of it's special sauce per order!

A man who grabs a hold of life like Tiger Woods does a white slutty breast.  I have dry humped this planet and no amount of trying to shake me off has worked yet.  I have survived it all.  Faberge Egg addiction. She-male mother figures. Waking up in the morgue 5 times. Two attempted autopsies. 3 years tied up in Rick James's basement. 4 years tied up in some Austrian guy's basement with his daughter and their 4 kids. Crippling Endust addiction. 4 minutes of a Paulie Shore stand up performance. Driving to Delaware with Artie Lange to score heroin. Tongue kissing Madonna (I was sick for 3 months.) 

Where do you go for sanctuary, you ask? How do you escape the fate that has tossed you around like Charlie Sheen does a hooker in a hotel room?  Easy. The kindest, nicest place on earth...no...not Disney World...those midgets will knife you for almost no provocation. One comment about them being cursed by the Devil and an attempted exorcism to help them grow and suddenly they go all Jeffery Dahmer on you. I was lucky to escape.  No. I go to Tripoli, Libya.  I walk around. I listen to the happy sounds...the children playing their favorite ""who looks more like Gaddafi/Kim Kardashian Without Electrolysis and a Fat Butt contest."" I came in 3rd two years ago. Magical.  If you listen really closely you can hear the sound of the secret police torturing a man for saying that things just aren't all that great. Infidel. The smell of spices and dissention filled the nostrils.  I met Gaddafi once.  Interesting fellow. Spent 11 hours telling me how he should have been casted as Joey on Friends.  He blamed the ghost of Ethel Merman. Kept screaming about how she told him to ""just be himself.""  At least the food was good.  The lamb kabob's were amazing. I thought about them a lot. For reasons that I can't fully explain...a mix up about what my ""Camel Riding"" business really was forced me to leave. The recent news made me think of all the great times...and the bad...like how no one showed up for my Briss.  It was the worst 37th birthday I ever had. Me and a guy who claimed to be a Moyle holding a machete.  He looked a lot like Tom Arnold with a beard...but I doubt Tom Arnold could book that kind of gig anymore.   Anyway...I thought 
about the food.
 
Well...I can finally have peace...well...let's not get crazy. I still have other issues...but I can get go to a good Kabob stand.  It isn't perfect. It isn't Tripoli in the summertime...the sound of the stadium filled with beheadings and Bee Gee's music...no...not that good.  What about the food. Well, the Gyro is spectacular. It is really the best thing on the menu and it is like 7 bucks with a drink.  The lamb kabob is excellent, but the beef kabob is poorly seasoned and ends up tasting like a well done hamburger.  The chicken kabob is very good but often a little dry.  Stick with the lamb.  The hummus is good, but not spicy enough for Rex.  The tabouli is spot on excellent.  The free chutney is so flavorful it is a perfect complement to the kabobs.  The shish is just like the kabobs...lamb great but the beef is better than the kabobs.  One complaint that I can't forget...the rice goes from bad to awful. It is ALWAYS overdone. ALWAYS!  I can't understand it. It's rice. They flame broil meat like a champ...but damn is the rice bad. I don't get it. Great portion sizes of everything, just the rice is really brutal some days. Crunchy rice is never right. Ever. (Don't say  deep fried rice balls...they are horrible.)

The atmosphere is really good and at night you can see the planes land and the view of the strip is perfect.  There is a car park for the airport and I often ""acquire"" a car and park there and eat my food.
  
The owners are a little squeamish about self flagellation...but that is how I mark the Day of Ashura and if they don't like it well then they can take it up with the dude we all pray to...Captain Kangaroo.

3406827,2011-03-25,3,K3wUWHOPhAmIJ5naMVzylA,"I have driven by Flame Kabob countless times in the course of dropping packages off at USPS, but the timing just hadn't worked out.  Last night, we were heading out to drop off some packages and were looking for somewhere to eat afterwards.   I pulled up Restaurant.com and found a $25 off $35 for Flame Kabob - just what I was looking for!
The restaurant is well-lit, stands out on the corner of its building, and is spacious.  The design is...  let's use ""eclectic"".  Assorted granite tabletops and faux rock wall decor lend to a Mediterranean feel, as do the bumpin' beats laid behind sultry ""Arabic"" vocals (I barely speak Spanish) playing overhead (at an interestingly reasonable volume).  

On the large Flatscreen TV which manages to not look TOO out of place, CNN aka The Anderson Cooper Network was broadcasting news of the Libyan uprising.  It strangely juxtaposed with the music, making me wish all news were Autotuned for our enjoyment.

The help was... well, helplful if not all that personable.  He seemed a bit irritated with us although we were the only people in the store and still ended up spending $40 for 3 people (after coupon, but also after the 18% grat was added, which wasn't really a grat, but just more income for the restaurant... meh.)

On to the food:

We ordered Hummus ($2.49), Baba Ghanoush ($1.99), Tabouli ($1.99), and uhh... the yogurt and cucmber sauce/dip (Mast-O-Khiar - $2.49) along with some extra bread ($1.99) to start .  Our ""appetizers"" came up within about 8-10 minutes and we were off to the races, stuffing our face with as much deliciousness as we could, and it was all delicious!  The hummus had great flavor, and I actually ate Baba Ghanoush and Tabouli, neither of which I normally ever touch.  Even the bread itself was notably tasty, a rare treat and much appreciated!

The main courses were (we all shared):
Ground Beef Kabob plate ($6.99)
Ground Chicken Kabob plate ($6.99)
Ground Lamb Kabob plate ($7.99)
Tenderloin Chicken Kabob plate ($8.99)

ALL came with a giant pita (half of a 12""), tons of what they underwhelmingly call ""Saffron Rice"" (which is actually some of the most attractive, subtly flavorful, and well-cooked rice I've ever had... there's got to be a name for that!  ""Wicked Awesome Rice"", perhaps?)

Both chicken plates got gobbled up before anyone could discuss  how they'd be divided (Fork Wars!)  On to the beef, which was perfectly seasoned (not OVERseasoned as is alllll too common in Mediterranean places).  Everything was tender, perfectly cooked, and seriously - I can't say enough about their getting the seasoning right.  Finally, a place that doesn't think ""Brian needs another cup of salt in him!""

It was late in the day, so I'm going light on the lamb... Yes, Lamb is gamey, but done right and perfectly fresh, it's not as gamey as what I ate (I had to eat most of it - I'm our ""garbage disposal""... 

After fulfilling my disposal duties (the lamb wasn't THAT bad... just full of lamb-y flavor!),  on came the dessert - Baklava ($1.99).

How good was it?  We bought phyllo dough, butter, pistachios and honey before we got home after being reminded just how much Baklava can DRIP WITH DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Yes, I licked the honey out of the container - what about it!?

For our $10 tip, we didn't really get any ""service"", but this isn't that type of place... the open kitchen (awesome) was quick to let us know when our food was up (also awesome).  We considered leaving our disposable everything on the table but opted to haul it to the trash ourselved (darned morals - although we did leave a good bit of rice on the table). 

On the way out, we walked past a few bags of trash which hadn't made their way to the dumpster just yet... Nothing ""shocking"", it was late, they were nearing closing, but really... you can't just take the extra steps to the dumpster when almost no one's in the restaurant?

Overall, great place, good specials (not available with Restaurant.com coupon), a little in the middle of nowhere but if you're on Sunset by the 
airport, there's few places to eat and this is a reaaaally good one.

3 stars = fresh persian bread.  Yum!  It comes w/ all the entrees and they give you a nice big portion to eat with your food.  I love bread!

4 stars = for the fixings that come w/ your entree; lemon, roasted tomato (great addition to your meat), fresh onion - especially because I love onion, and rice.  Rice could be a little more tastier.  

5 stars = for the meat!  As soon as I took a bite, I was in heaven; the meat is so flavorful and so tasteful!  I loved every bite of my Beef Kubideh Kabob.  Such a simple kabob, but tasted to so good!  It was even good with the green salsa they provide.

However, we were pretty burnt out by that point on the whole strip experience, and walked from our hotel to what we hoped would be the type of Vegas experience that the locals have.

Hello, Flame Kabob.  Clean, friendly, and homey, with a local Iranian family visiting with the servers and owners for an early meal.  We ordered our meals (a kubideh for me and a chicken kebab for Hubs) and brought ice cream back to our hotel room for later.  This place offered excellent food for cheap, and while it wasn't gourmet food, it was fast, tasty, and filling.

My lamb kubideh was delicious, flavored with full coriander seeds (the other reviewer that suggested the sauce was right on the money - it has a little kick to it but also has a little mint in it), and my husband's chicken kebab turned out moist and perfectly cooked.  The meal did seem a little carb heavy, but the flatbread was quite nice.  All of the entrees come with saffron rice, onion, a small mixed salad, and a grilled tomato.  The only downside was that the rice was a little unevenly cooked.

Finally, we took home a bucket of the Persian ice cream, which was pistachio and saffron.  Definitely a unique flavor, and while it wasn't quite to our liking, it was a window into another culture.

Four stars for the excellent value for the money, the clean, cafe-like atmosphere, and the tastiness of the food.",t3uLASRxd7vxnpHmeMwVwA,1,0,4,Rxzdyj4A5zpXSA7060S6Pw

Instead we were handed 2 plastic cups and were expected to get our own water from the fountain and clear our paper plates from the table. Clearly they wouldn't expect a tip from other customers, but due to a clause in the certificate designed to help people, this owner saw an opportunity to make some extra cash. Even the sauce had a sign that said only one cup allowed per order. (The cups didn't hold more than a tablespoon.) The whole thing just gave us a creepy feeling. We wouldn't pay 18% gratuity to eat at a burger joint just because we had a coupon, but we could have spent $5 extra per person and gotten a rack of ribs and a sit down dining experience.",hDMH1j2fycQ-MHM8daKcJA,2,0,2,AggMEV2XqqH4EeON9rg4hg

Being Persian ourselves, we were hoping for some Persian fare, and this didn't quite meet our expectations.  We ordered the number 10 beef combo (one skewer kubideh and one tenderloin) and weren't impressed with the taste, especially considering the price point. ($15!!)

My parents' first reaction was that this place isn't Persian but rather Arab, referring to the combination of spices they use.  Arab recipes tend to use spices like cumin while Persian recipes lean heavily on onion.

We did really like the fresh baked bread and the two yogurts -- maast-o-khiar and maast-o-moosir -- the yogurt was creamy and flavorful.

Service was good.  We got our food fairly quickly, and the staff was helpful and kind.

When the Flame is on, you can look forward to fresh, tender meats on sticks, piping hot fresh taftoon made in a special oven, and what I assume to be a tomatillo chutney that seriously kicks the butt of most tomatillo salsas I have experienced. Oh, and the Persian iced tea! The hummus is thick and tasty. The tabbouleh is nice. For me, the baba ghanoush is a little too smoky and tad oily. 

When the Flame is off, the bread loses it magic. It is served not piping hot and under a salad which makes it soggy. Definitely request the bread on the side. On our second visit, the lamb lost its tenderness. I had the BBQ chicken, and it was good, but the rice was a little bland. Plus, the Persian iced tea had been replaced with Gold Peak! NOOOOOOOOO! Okay, maybe the Persian tea is there somewhere, but I did not see it.

I have read some of the good reviews about the one on Eastern and decided to try this location. Unlike the former, the latter does not do the $3.99 lunch special. That is ok, because their $5.99 gyro was still a good deal.

While I was ordering, it felt like the cashier was trying to pressure me into ordering more food than I needed. I might everything and often, but I know that a gyro is more than enough. Luckily I stuck to that mindset because the gyro was gigantic. The gentleman working the grill was generous with the amount of meat he shaved off. The sliced meat is then thrown into a frying pan. I was unable to identify if it was oil or a broth to finish the cooking process. I have a feeling that it was the first because the meat came out darker and a bit crisp. After it was finished it was thrown on top a pita with a liberal amount of tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of onions. The meat was salty, but the yogurt sauce, lemon, and their green sauce helped even out the flavors.

The concept of this restaurant is more like a fast-food joint than a lunch/dinner place. For some reasons, I have a hard time assimilating fast food to Persian food. There food is fresh and the bread is homemade.
Atmosphere 3/5: They built this restaurant in a way we feel like in a fast food joint. I like the windows to the kitchen so you can see the preparation of your order. The meat are prepared in advanced and left in a fridge. The atmosphere isn't bad, it's just not my favorite place to eat Persian food at the premise.
Food 3/5: Food is fresh and good. I wouldn't give them the price of Best restaurant in town though. It's a great concept if you're looking to eat something cheap and fast. They have a quick turn around and the meat is halal.
Service 3/5: I give them 3/5 because they are nice people. The restaurant is sort of self service so it is difficult to judge the service on that end.
