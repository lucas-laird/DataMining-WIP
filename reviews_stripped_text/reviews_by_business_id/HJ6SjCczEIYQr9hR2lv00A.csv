Terrible food! Awful customer service! Waited over 45 min. For 2 sandwiches! Moldy bread! 
Today I ordered 2 chicken parmesan sandwiches, an order of fries and onion rings. The chicken parmesan sandwiches were chicken, tomatoes and lettuce on dry bread. I called to notify the manager that the sandwiches were wrong. I was told by the girl who answered the phone, stating she was the manager,  and that I should've asked when I ordered to have the toppings; peppers, marinara sauce and parmesan cheese added to the chicken parmesan sandwiches. After quite a few minutes of arguing over the managers rationales to why my chicken parmesan did not have anything on them that the menu stated was on them, I was finally offered replacement sandwiches. At this point, I didn't feel I could trust the integrity of this business and decided to keep the dry sandwiches I didn't order. I won't even get into the issue of the burnt chicken and mold on the bread. Needless to say; I threw them both out. 
The 99 cent donut was the only reason I give this business any star at all.",tOE0jOQRNecIAQhdC9-axw,2,0,1,uA5OukKlB9Eep9T6vvyR5w

So much better and for the money you can't beat it. Great, fresh donuts. The only donut that isn't so good is their apple fritter- and there are usually many sitting in the glass case at this location.

The other donuts, are super good.  Only bad experience was with a 30-40 year old Caucasian man who worked there- he just had no personality, and hardly cracked a smile. There was another younger woman working there a few times I went in and she was nice and easy to deal with.

Very quiet and mellow place to eat breakfast or get your fix for donuts.

Highly recommend if you want a good donut. Skip the overpriced Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts. You won't regret it.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,0,0,5,kDDHmcwQARm5m97iSDsv-A

They offered us and my kids a free donut each and that was much appreciated. The donut was very good. They said they are still adjusting the ingredients and may switch back to fresh meat.

I had been begging my boyfriend to take me here for about a week because I wanted to try a cronut. When we came in there was a hold up in line because a woman was using a groupon and adding donuts one by one to get up to her total. Annoying, but not the businesses fault. 

The girl at the counter who as obviously new and every question that the guy in front of us asked, as well as our questions was met with an ""I don't know"". The donuts and cronuts are not labeled, so good luck figuring out which one you want. That is, if there are any left. They were out of glazed, which it what I wanted, so  asked if there were any more coming. Of course, new girl didn't know, so she asked the other lady working the counter, who said ""No, what's left is all there is"". My boyfriend and I ended up with the last crusty two cronuts besides 3 reject flavors. We would have probably gotten 2 a piece had there actually been options. Then when we were leaving, we heard the lady that said there were no more say that she was going to make some more. We would have happily waited 15-20 minutes for a fresh cronut in a flavor that we actually wanted. I also heard a man get annoyed that they were out of coffee as we were leaving. 

The cronut itself was just ok. I don't want to make an opinion on something that was made early this morning and has been sitting in a case for hours. I was hoping that this would be a regular place for us, but sadly, I don't think that we will be back.",HL5OVMGKrncyGr8qbbw-Cg,1,0,3,tS0oRspKF4cRSjpmsJwuXA

We rolled in and met with Dominique, the very nice lady behind the counter.  She happily explained and kindly acquiesced to what we were seeking.  I ordered up a Cheesy Bacon Doughnut Burger (not on the menu) with a hash brown.  My buddy ordered up an omelette with cheese and some kielbasa sausage.

Coffee was straight out of Keurig but if your gonna consume more, I was told they can brew a pot.  Opt for the smaller cup.  I am sure that particular serving size won't be as watered down and lack body as a large does.

Other items consumed were a mini apple fritter and a raspberry Kronut.  What is a Kronut?  Well, it's as if a croissant and a doughnut had a baby. The fritter was described by my buddy as being ""airy.""  I totally agreed but it was not lacking in anything that makes an apple fritter an....apple fritter.  These two pastries were delicious.  I bought a big fritter to bring back to the boy.

When they meal arrived, they were small in stature but enormous in flavor.  Particularly the doughnut burger which was split two ways.  My mouth and what I have left for a brain had NO idea what what my taste buds were attempting to communicate.  This little bastard was a six star experience!

Got the ham sandwiches fairly quickly but they were a disappointment. Bagel wasn't toasted. Too much egg to ham ratio, all I tasted was egg. Just had one flimsy piece of ham.

Also I bought a Groupon for a dozen kronuts and I went in a Saturday to get them but the cashier said that she want allowed to accept Groupons on the weekends anymore (which doesn't state anywhere on the voucher) so I came back on a Thursday and the owner came out and told me he could make me a dozen mini kronuts and I can return, even though the voucher was for a dozen regular kronuts, when I questioned him about it he said he was doing me a favor, because he wasn't accepting them anymore. After I refused the mini kronuts, he said I could take my Groupon and get out, and continued to complain about Groupon and the customers that come in with the Groupon vouchers.

(Despite trays of glazed filled donuts on the counter behind the case, they apparently weren't for sale!) Plain glazed donut was just average. They need more signs to indicate what flavors are in the case. We rang the bell for service, still had to wait a while for someone to come help us. A patron waiting behind us gave up and left. The biggest annoyance was some employee's child was sitting in the dining room watching a video full of expletives. I don't think I've heard the f-bomb so many times in a restaurant.

I ordered a veggie wrap. The owner, Al made it for me. It was very colorful and the sauce he used to grill the veggies was tasty, but it came open, like a taco. There was no wrapping done to my meal whatsoever. So with every bite I took, I lost more of my veggies.
Customer service was a bit off. The lady seemed very confused about the order before me and ringing my order up. Then while I was eating I heard her talk (IMO) rudely to another customer about not being able to scan a printed out coupon. It was her tone of voice and the way she was speaking to them that really got under my skin.
Part of the restaurant had a divider up and it looked like supplies were being kept there. Kind of odd.  
Another employee took 3 trays of donuts out to her car, I am guessing for delivery. But they were not covered in any fashion and while she was carrying them, I noticed her shirt was touching the tops of the donuts. Not sure what rules there are for transporting donuts--but I would guess putting them in boxes would be a good start.

3167813,2014-06-11,5,HJ6SjCczEIYQr9hR2lv00A,"A few weeks ago, I had a pretty disappointing visit to the other Al's Donuts near UNLV. Unfortunately, their new location, which is a collaboration with Café Burgers, was just as much of a let down.

For starters, this new location is inside the Tenaya Village center off of Tenaya and Azure. They are located at the far west side of the plaza and have a fairly big sign on the outside of the building. Inside the restaurant, you'll find a counter to order food at and the donut display cases. They do have a decent amount of seating as well for those who wish to dine in. 

We ended up calling in an order and right off the bat, things went downhill as I found out the online menu wasn't updated with what they currently offer. While extremely weird sounding, I actually wanted to try the Maple Bacon Kronut Burger listed on the site. That burger, as well as 2 other burgers we had hoped to order were completely removed from the current menu. They've also changed a few items and some of the burgers descriptions don't match what's actually being served. 

When it comes to the burgers, I sadly can't recommend anyone come here to get one. Everything is straight out of a package and is severely lacking in flavor. Buns are packaged. Patties are frozen. Sauces are bottled. I'm not even sure the onions on my burger were fresh cut. While the Classic burger is only about $5, some of the ""gourmet"" options are priced up to $10 and the quality is nowhere near worth that. Keep in mind, these prices don't include fries either. The fries by the way, also frozen. To top it off, the Buffalo Bill burger that I ordered, has apparently been combined with another burger on the menu called the Texas Smokehouse. It's an odd combination of ranch, BBQ sauce, buffalo sauce, onions, bacon and cheese. Even aside from the quality, I wasn't digging the flavor, or lack thereof.

Moving on to the donuts and kronuts, I can only suggest you check out my review of the other Al's location. Not surprisingly, the product here is exactly the same and I still am not a fan. However, I must say that I enjoyed one of the kronut petites I was given to sample as I was waiting for my food. What's odd is I actually took home a dozen pack of these to the fam, but they ended up being extremely dry. They were packaged in a separate to-go container, so maybe that had something to do with it. 

What am I fan of at Al's Donuts & Café Burger? The service. Aside from being slightly confused when I tried to order, the two ladies I dealt with were great. They were extremely helpful and friendly. I ended up being there for about 15 minutes while waiting for my food and they were kind of enough to keep checking on me as well.

As we all know though, service isn't all that counts and the food certainly won't bring me back.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,6,4,2,hSs8QLM5URTCxaKJFw1PaA

I would think Saturdays would be a huge donut days for families etc. They only had two style of cronuts to chose from and about 4 types of donuts. I have never tried a cronut so I bought one and it was pretty small but very tasty.

I picked the vanilla cronut which had a raspberry filling. It basically tasted like a raspberry filled croissant with frosting on top. Surprisingly delicious!!

I have cleared the first hurdle and identified my weaknesses. They are donuts and cheeseburgers. Well, that resolution is going to have to wait thanks to a good friend and the website we all know and love.

Any place that is bold enough to make a cheeseburger on a glazed donut is going to get rave reviews from me, regardless of what my cardiologist thinks. I looked at it, took a picture of it, and watched PW cut it in half yet still didn't believe what I was seeing. Then came the moment of reckoning. OMG. The combination of different flavors was incredible. Even if you don't want to eat an entire cheeseburger on a doughnut, buy one and share it with friends. You'll be glad you did.

I was also a kronut virgin prior to this visit, but not anymore. Full of flavor, crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. They come in a variety of flavors and won't disappoint.

Tips for improvement:
1. Invest in an espresso machine and hire a qualified barista.  Fresh specialty coffees are always desired over thermos coffee.
2. Better ingredients and balance in your breakfast sandwiches.  I don't want to be served something that looks and tastes like I can make it at home on a $2 budget.

I wasn't disappointed, same great taste and quality that I've had for the past 4 years. This location in particular has a cleaner and nicer atmosphere. Definitely would recommend. Only reason why I chose not to give 5 stars was because of customer service. A young guy working there was a little rude first greeting my girlfriend and I with a ""What do you want"". Not very polite for a first visit. But either way, if you just want your donuts or cronuts, this is the place to be!",0EiC1Qmt3rvb3q042jsTzw,1,0,4,_E4UdxvC5cEQOlVx5EK6NA

Kronut Petite - Raspberry, Chocolate and Cream, Double Chocolate, Peanuts and Chocolate, Cinnamon Swirl Raspberry

Every bit the ""only in 'merica"" mash-up of Centennial's Café Burger and UNLV stalwart Al's Donuts that the name would imply it was just as the doors unlocked at 7:00am that I entered Tenaya Village's newest tenant and although rather disappointed with my lone visit to Al's Southeast Flagship I must say the expanded menu, larger floor-plan, and general cleanliness of the space is unquestionably a step up.  Apparently concocted as a merger of two separate enterprises and generally keeping their goods divided aside from a bit of donut/bun fusion it was unsurprisingly to a full range of fried pastries that my early morning visit was met and although the friendly staff of two middle-age women informed me that the full-menu was in fact available I largely stuck to the carbs, a bahn mi or burger breakfast simply not my style when confronted with sweets.  Beginning with the tried and true in the form of a mixed box of donuts both classics and fancy I was immediately impressed by quality of the crumb in old fashioned while the fritter proved far less greasy than I remember from the spot on Harmon, a plethora of apples folded into the crispy, cinnamon-laced dough.  Moving on to things more novel it was not long before my breakfast sandwich arrived and offered at a mere $3.99 with two sugared kronut holes plus hash browns the ham, egg, and cheese were relatively standard fare propped up by a now-softened kronut and although the concoction arrived a touch soggy after a trip to the microwave it still proved a pleasant foil to the intense sweetness of a quintet of 75-cent 'kronut petite' showing off admirable levels of lamination while house-made fillings delivered far better balance in this format than the full-sized versions I'd experienced from Al's in the past.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,3,HIoiuLTHug645qDBXXNiKA

The burger was good and juicy compared to my wife's burger she got the Kansas City burger which came with a totally different meat patty. The Franken burger was juicy and fresh but the meat on the kc was dry and tough like it had been frozen. She couldn't eat it. Maybe everything would have been better without a Groupon.

They are not too light and not too heavy, very sweet, and very addicting. You can get a dozen minis for 7$, or a big on for 2$- kind of in the pricey range, but for an every now and then indulgence it is pretty good. 

So far I have had a lemon custard, and a raspberry and cinnamon Cronut in the big sizes (the raspberry and cinnamon was to die for) and their glazed mini cronuts which melt in your mouth.  I will certainly be back to try some more Cronuts!",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,2,2,4,BA-9ezK05yW5YS7rIFoFRg
5517446,2015-11-14,0,HJ6SjCczEIYQr9hR2lv00A,"We were having our vehicle serviced so we decided to stop-in since we were in the vicinity. Not to mention a friend of ours loves him some AL kronuts. 

It was a Saturday afternoon, the dining area was clear of any other patrons, and greeted almost immediately. I was quite surprised to see how much bigger it was on the inside. Driving by I always imagined it to be some small donut shop like Ronald's donuts on Spring Mountain. It also is modern in decoration. 

So the menu posted on the front of the store shows they offer banh mi sandwiches and other such sandwiches and burgers.  It was lunchtime, we just came back from our son's football game, so everyone was hungry. Thought how perfect that there was food options aside from donuts, cronuts, and burgers.

However, when we went to order they did not have anything we asked for. Sorry, we no longer sell banh mi, sorry we don't have the pork n slaw sandwich we just the chicken n slaw...just felt like way too much sorries in such a time span. But okay, option B...vegeterian sandwich for me, buffalo chicken sandwich for the boy, and chicken with fries for all the other boys. 

I actually thoroughly enjoyed my vegeterian sandwich which had red peppers, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro, and I even think there was a squirt of balsamic in there. Perfect! Loved it all. I think the bun made the experience even more enjoyable, it just seemed the bun was more on the gourmet side. Their chicken strips comes with two big pieces, two big juicy pieces, so my boys thoroughly enjoyed it. My other son enjoyed his buffalo sandwich so I suppose that was a good sign, or perhaps they were all starving that anything would've been deelish.

Now, you don't come here, realistically, for food as your  main goal. The husband ordered the maple bacon cronut. We were told anything which has chocolate or maple on top, Bavarian cream filled it is. I'm allergic to chocolate (the horror...I know), and bacon atop of a do/cronut isn't something that appeals to me. Soooo...I opted for the lemon powdered cronut with lemon filling. So good. Loved that. However, twas abit disappointing to see that there wasn't much selections in regards to their kronuts. 

I then decided to try ""bacon atop of a do/cronut isn't something that appeals to me"" because the husband offered for me to try his; besides, I need to live life on the edge sometimes (as if jumping out of airplanes isn't living enough).  

It turned out to be alot better than I imagined. I love croissants, actually. It being a ""donut""-- genius. I find cronuts being less sweet than an actual donut. I don't know why, perhaps it's the butter in a croissant that offsets the sweetness..but in my opinion, it just is.

I could only give them 3 stars for having items posting infront of their business, even inside their business, yet no longer offering them, lacl pf kronut selection, and for having a really gross bathroom. Nothing like walking into a bathroom seeing someone's explosion still on the toilet like shadows imprinted against the wall (proving how strong the explosion was). The dining room floor was pretty dirty too. I feel like a facility that is clearly slow should have no excuse as to why it is dirty. We hung out in there for a good hour and then some. In that time we were the only ones in there aside from another family who came. 

I'm not really one with a sweet tooth, I do enjoy sweet things on occasion...I crave a donut a couple times a year (seriously. Sometimes I don't crave it all). After trying Als, it not being a place out of our way, I can imagine coming back a couple times a year to satisfy such craving. It's worth a try and worth returning if you are in the vicinity or got a love for such. The cronuts itself, I'd give a 4 star rating.

Almost forget to mention the service was not bad at all. I could tell the girl working the front felt bad for no longer serving the items we were intending on ordering.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,0,0,3,C855N0oqLguaLoEn6clSVw
5549092,2014-11-25,1,HJ6SjCczEIYQr9hR2lv00A,"Burger review only.

Thank god for the BOGO coupon in the Sunday. No way these burgers are worth $7 and $8 each. The buns are too crumbly and soft. The burger patty tastes like from frozen. The cheese is shredded cheese and it wasn't even melted all the way through. I couldn't tell where bun ended and patty began. No texture contrast at all. Needed some crunch of onion, and tang of pickle. The lettuce and tomato on there didn't help much.

We got one Texas Smokehouse (BBQ sauce, bacon, cheese) and Cheesy Bacon Burger (3 cheese, bacon, bbq). Wait, isn't that essentially the same thing? But those were what you could get with the BOGO.

These prices are like Smash Burger, and I barely even think SB is worth that.",ub5yA93d2pWc0VMPE8Dn1A,2,2,2,1Pdb7J7dyTWCGi73QE-U4g

After yelping around my area for ""hamburgers"" I saw this place and figured we'd give it a try for the burgers. 
Located in a newer strip center of N. Las Vegas, on a Saturday at 6pm I was expecting several people to be in this establishment however, there was only 4 people! Not a good sign by visual judgement and quickly adding the very plain brown and cream colored walls with basic table tops and some goofy couch nested in the back I was quickly wondering if Al's was gonna live up to its reputation. 

This is a typical walk up and order type cafe. There is a desert display as you walk in that hosts all the Donuts and Cronuts available and while I was there at 6pm I certainly was not expecting to see pastries but there was a few and all still looking fresh even knowing they were from the AM. 
I ordered the Texas burger and gf ordered the Buffallo Bill burger. Fries were extra. We were offered to add toppings as the cashier did a great job explaining the burgers and pastries. She actually talked us in to a couple cronuts so I ordered the Chocolate covered bavarian cream filled with nut toppings and gf ordered Maple covered bavarian cream filled with bacon toppings! 
A standard soda fountain is offered for drinks as well as coffee and tea is offered. 

We sat down and about 5 minutes later the cronuts were brought to the table followed in another 5 by the burgers and fries. 
We were quickly surprised at how good the burger appeared and the basket of large cut fries. Biting into my burger was very tasty and followed the Texas burger description. Overall both our burgers were very pleasing and straight up, not greasy, or dry. A simple burger you think to yourself, I can make this at home but they never seem to come out just right. 
Cronuts were both very tasty as well although I felt the Maple was better than the Chocolate in regards to the bavarian cream tasted more fresh but they were both good! 

In conclusion I will easily return here for a simple burger and pastry. Remember the cafe decor is minimal and nothing at all to flock over so be ready for that, enjoy the food.",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,2,1,4,XI0JRGJogjEBzok9oEOfag
