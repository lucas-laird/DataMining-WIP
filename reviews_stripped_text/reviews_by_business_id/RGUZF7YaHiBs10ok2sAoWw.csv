817538,2017-05-31,0,RGUZF7YaHiBs10ok2sAoWw,"I feel so bad for the sweet lady that was our server.  I believe she is the mom of the guy (I refuse to say gentlemen) working in the kitchen.  2 coworkers and myself were here for lunch.  Lady took our order.  Soon after then cook started yelling profanities at the server lady.  I am not sure if she maybe messed up taking the order or what happened but he was in her face full of rage yelling at her.  I turned around to face them.  The guy calmed down and looked at me calmly.  He looked at me and I asked""is everything ok""?  He said yeah everything's fine and smiled.  He kept staring at me angrily after that.  I seen him a couple more times talking in a lower tone to the server but still very angry with her.  She looked so terrified of him it was disgusting!!!  I have never experienced this in a customer service environment.  The cook eventually walked out of restaurant for about 15 minutes.  When the server gave us our checks she was apologetic for the guy.  I told her she didn't need to apologise and that we were sorry for her.  I hardly ate anything because I was uncomfortable and untrusting that maybe the guy had done something to my food before he walked out.  Will never come back to this establishment.  Wish there was more I could have done for the lady.",KvXcwb-XF4R1sr3yn8Dkog,1,0,1,wjgKFH1z195jhKJf9go-dg

The only downside is I felt bad for the employee.  One lady was running the show.  She was the hostess, waitress, cook and busboy.  Because she was so busy we had to wait a bit for our food.

Turns out the place is entirely new -- new name, new owners, new chef, new server--and they were in the process of starting the business. Since we were hungry, my friend and I decided to give their burgers a try, figuring as usual that if they make a good burger, the rest of the food would be good. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED. The burger was tasty, hot, served on a big bun and done to order.  The next week, just to be sure, we stopped in and ordered a pulled poker sandwich. The result is: We'll be regulars there, for sure. 
If the two friendly chicks running the joint can overcome the location, they'll have people standing in line for their food.",S0bD36O8ekapzQm85D26ug,1,0,5,slrZ5KZya9fZQfEQSRBDTQ

One lady was running the place.  It's a small place. There are five tables or so, and they're chrome, shiny, and bright.  The owner / operator runs the place, cooks the food, chats with customers, and keeps the place running very well.  

I ordered the Gyro.  It came with fries.   I was so hungry and feeling rushed (not due to her, but due to having to get to my ceremony), that I ate my Gyro very quickly. It was warm, fresh, and tasty. The fries were delicious.  Because we had heard so much about them, we also ordered some onion rings.  She said that her son used to make them, but he's not working there any more, so she wasn't sure if they were as good as they had been.  To us, travelers who were hungry, in a bit of a hurry, and having had several other meals in the area, they were absolutely delicious.
