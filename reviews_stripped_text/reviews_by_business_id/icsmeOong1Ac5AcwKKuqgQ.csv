We didn't feel like spending $50 for an order of nachos and grilled cheese at the hotel so we decided to walk through the LINQ. We came across this place and ordered the #3 buta burger and #4 kinoko burger with jazz fries for about $22. Definitely worth more than a lot of places on the strip. I liked the kinoko mushroom burger,  the flavor was unique. . Just a little too salty in some spots and it is pretty ginger-y (just my taste though,  I don't eat ginger). I didn't try the buta burger,  but I was told it was good.  

As per the service,  it was very slow. . Especially since it is a fast food venue. There was basically one guy making all the food while all the last minuters came in before closing (including us).. We almost couldn't get a seat.",7BdMyjmgnNnVYFas6kqx9w,0,1,4,w4rFN5eNYJ4MhyqzCVOn-g

I had the Tamago Burger, an all-beef Fuku-patty with furikake, teriyaki and wasabi mayo, finished with crispy onion strings and a fried egg.

We were warmly welcomed and any questions we had about the menu were answered eagerly. Sandwiches are all $7.99 with 6 main selections and a few specials. We chose the Chicken Katsu sandwich with habanero kabayaki, instead of crack sauce. The spicy sauce is usually served on the Karai burger. The chicken is pounded thin and coated with panko and fried crisp. It sits atop a soft bun and it's topped with shredded cabbage and katsu sauce. We also ordered garlic fries which come with crack sauce. They give you a silly nick name for when your order's ready. Our order was up when ""Frank the Tank"" was called. Frank's mom was ""Lady Luck"" she ordered the Fuku Burger which is your traditional cheeseburger with wasabi mayo and fuku sauce. 

Our order was quickly prepared, it was fresh and tasty. We really enjoyed the Chicken Katsu with the extra kick. I've previously given flack to Fukuburger (truck) for not unleashing the heat on their spicy burger. I'm happy to see they've amped up the spice over time. The sandwich had great flavor. I was less impressed with the bite of the Fukuburger, because it was loaded with mayo. I'm not fond of mayo, hence the substitution of the habanero kabayaki. So it was just a matter of personal taste, Frank and his mom enjoyed it. They also liked the crack sauce. I didn't find it as addicting (again, the mayo) but I did like the garlic fries, even if they were light in garlic flavor. 

Overall, Fukuburger serves up a moderately priced quick bite that is served fresh. Which can be a tough find center strip. They've come a long way since late nights in Chinatown parking lots.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,1,3,rGyqt50O9XYwJCxfJcIfVw

1573546,2014-12-01,5,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"Haven't heard of this burger joint until today. Originally it's a food truck, but now they have a storefront!

Location: Located in the FAME at the LINQ (Resembles Univeral City Walk, but with the ""Worlds Tallest Ferris Wheel"" (550-foot High Roller in the background). Look for a big giant boba cup! :)

Service: Staffers were very nice and gave us the 411 on the must eats at this burger joint. Food came out fast!

Food: At first, I was terrified that these burgers wouldn't fill us up. They were smaller than other burgers you see at other burger joints and were more expensive at $7.99 a pop. Learned another valuable lesson today. Never judge the size of the burger by it's price tag. We tried three burgers and while you are at it... get some garlic fries! 

1) The Fuku-burger (Lucky Burger): Consisted of a fuku patty with lettuce, tomato, onion, and topped with American cheese and drizzed with Fuku sauce. Can't remember what was good about this burger, but it was one of their top seller. Burger ranked last!

2) Tamago (Egg Burger): Consisted of a fuku patty with furtkake and teriyaki, finished with crispy onion strings & fried egg. Mmmmm... muy deliciouso! Loved everything about it especially the egg and the crispy onion strings. Every bite comes with a surprise of running egg yoke and crunch. Oh so heavenly! Burger comes in first! :)

3) Buta-burger (Pig Burger): Consisted of fuku patty with miso glazed applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, onion, and pickled ginger finished with Japanese BBQ sauce. OMG! First time tasting a burger that has ginger in it! Loved every single bite of this burger and all the ingredients complimented the burger really well! Loved the Japanese bbq sauce which did not overwhelm the other ingredients. Burger comes in second!

I lovelovelove burgers and a big slut when it comes to eggs (as Mr. Bourdain would put it) so I was super stoked to find that you can add it (eggs) to any burger, not just the number two *_*_*_*

The place is in some sort of 'asian fusion' center that has a lot of side shows going on weekend nights (taiko drums, street dancers etc...) 

Service was super friendly. They cook everything to order, so if you're in a hurry you may not want to eat here cause it takes a little longer than fast food joint would. Burgers are cooked perfectly (medium to medium rare) so they are super juicy and the yolk jizzes down the center making my eyes dilate and mouth water with pleasure. 

Jazz fries are good if you want something extra however just getting the garlic fries (not that garlicy to be honest) with the crack sauce is satisfying enough (ask for extra!).

I got the number 1 : fuku 'lucky' burger and 3: buta 'pig' burger while my boyfriend got the spicy burger both trips. While they were all good I felt the number 3 had the most flavor..and spicy burger isn't so spicy, which is coming from someone who doesn't eat a ton of spicy food (however one of our friends thought it was really spicy...so if you're super sensitive maybe you should just skip it).

I am hooked on Fukuburger because one of the infusion of the Japanese culture, but beyond that it's just a damn good burger!

I went ahead and changed things up this go round and selected the buta burger (aka pig burger). It was topped with a hearty couple strips of applewood smoked bacon with japanese BBQ sauce/wasabi mayo and the odd ingredient that packed a punch: red ginger (yes, fact). They do prepare the burger medium rare unless requested otherwise which causes the beef to be so tender and flavorful. It does get a bit messy, but once your knee deep in beef that's an apple/orange situation trust me!

Also with honorable mention was the fuku fries seasoned with garlic salt and something else which I didn't catch, but I believe something of the japanese spice decent which did seem to tease my taste buds with a good time quite well and those are highly recommended to accompany the cow platter!

The price runs about $27 for 2 burgers, fries, and drinks which certainly leaves your wallet feeling like a ""grand champion"" and the staff was top notch..They were patient as we took our time with the menu and went well beyond their capacity to leave us feeling welcome then and certainly in the future!

I'm no Gordon Ramsey, but I know good food when it hits my palette. 

First off its great that it's accessible to visitors who can't make it out to the food truck, however there's just something about a food truck that makes the food tastes better. 

If you're a fan of edm this is the place to dance, drink and eat without paying the ridiculous price to see steve aoki press a play button (side joke). 

Food was amazing! The spicy burger was quite spicy that it took a second to go in for the kill. Because my tastes buds have been enhanced since being vegan for 3 years, the first taste is about 1 cup of salt. It could quite possibly be a combination of salt in the patty and the sauce. If you can take spicy and salty, go for the karai burger. If not, ask for avocado if they have any to cool the heat down. 

The place is great with an Asian food court style to where you know all Asians go to grab their savory foods. Here you'll find 8 vendors one of them being a boba counter. Don't bother with the boba because it's over priced. Get a taxi and just go to china town a few streets down west from the blvd on spring mountain. Get some pho too at pho Kim long while you're there.

2685924,2014-12-03,0,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"I was hesitant to try this place while in Vegas, because I figured I could have a burger anywhere. Well, I still ended up here and I'm glad I did. Fukuburger was definitely good.

What makes FUKUBURGER unique is the Asian inspired combinations in the burgers. It makes it different--but in a good way. Only of course if your palette is open to new things. I guess you wouldn't be a true foodie if it isnt. 

I had the KARAI SPICY BURGER, and let me tell you, it really IS SPICY! It definitely made me sweat. So if you don't plan on sweating while eating, do not order this. BUT if you are a fan of hot and spicy food, this is delicious and a great choice! But you've been warned on the spice/hot level. Again, I wish I didnt eat this with a group of coworkers and friends. Was a bit embarrassing sweating and constantly patting my head with a napkin and drinking soda.

The burger meat itself was delicious too. The other flavors they add on didn't take away from being able to taste the meat. It was cooked perfectly too. I believe the lady taking the order mentions they are all cooked medium? 

Now it can get a bit pricey when you add on fries and a soda. So expect to pay at least around $10 per person. The fries are good too though. They are seasoned and come with some dipping sauces that top it off. 

So definitely worth a shot. Like I said, it's different--but in a good way. Not the usual burger. Some may not like it, and that's fine. But if you are open to try new things and fusion of flavors, give this place a shot. I couldn't give it a perfect score simply because it seems a little pricey.",Qv0xMxEs9XHEqI_9zb8vcQ,0,0,4,33gGq5FfAPu-UXYoRkQ2NA
2688247,2014-08-14,3,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"It's hard to chase down a late night food truck when you have a little bugger.  But finally, I get to try Fukuburger!  Does it live up to the hype?

FAME at The Linq (where Fukuburger is located) is a glorified food court with lots of graphic art creating a hip and vibrant space.  Fukuburger is immediately visible with their faux truck in the corner.  I think the other tenants may be suffering from the lack of visibility or even a guide on what is offered inside.

Ok back to Fuku... Let's start off with the burger and togarashi fries.  Unfortunately this was a miss for us.  We got the Buta burger with bacon, cheese, pickled onion and ginger, bbq sauce and wasabi mayo.  The burger patty was small, and the fries were stale.  What we were served (and service took long even if the place wasn't packed) looked very different from the food shots I see from the Fukuburger truck.  Somehow the magic is a little lost in the permanent spot.

But the Naga Dog, wow, that was stellar, even if the bread was a little stale.  The hot link was smoky and savory and had a lovely snap when you bit into it because it is deep fried.  It comes with awesome grilled kimchi (which is a little wilted but the caramelization from the grill tames the tangy bite).  The stuff is spicy but exceptionally good!  It is complemented by the pickled daikon relish.  What a creative and successful alternative to onions!  Then the hot dog is topped with nori (which I wish I had more of) and wasabi mayo.  Mmm.  I read that it's supposed to come with kabayaki (eel) sauce, but I didn't get any on mine.  Even if I am not a huge fan of sweet on savory, I think it would have gelled beautifully with the spicy elements on the hot dog.  Still, I really enjoyed how they balanced all those elements successfully.  Maybe if I scoot over to the truck I'll get the perfect version.

For tourists on the strip, I believe it would be a convenient sop that does the job (even if it is pricier by around $2-3 per menu item).  But if you want a little more love on your plate, I'd hunt down that food truck.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,3,3,3,4_689hzUOrwyPjZwD-9vbg
2759590,2014-07-29,6,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"It's about time Fukuburger (pronounced ""Foo Koo"" for you noobs),  got a permanent location. Located inside the F.A.M.E. (which stands for Food Art Music Entertainment) which also houses other Asian food stands, it is a welcome site to visiting tourists and locals alike. 

For those that are new to Fukuburger, it started originally as a food truck by Colin Fukunaga and Robert ""Mags"" Magsalin. Thus, the food truck theme that welcomes you as soon as you enter FAME.

Now for the important part. The food. Their menu is plain and simple. Each burger has a number with a picture and a description. I have tried them all but for some reason, its always a toss up between the #4 Kinoko ""Mushroom"" Burger (which has an all beef fuku patty, grilled shitake mushrooms, pickled red ginger, teriyaki, and finished with wasabi mayo), and the #5 Karai ""Spicy"" Burger (which has an all beef fuku patty, pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and finished with habenero kabayaki). Sometimes when im real hungry, I get both. Most cases I get one and make it a combo with Jazz Fries (fries that have some kind of gravy/garlic sauce on top of it). Some call it crack sauce for it is very addicting.

As for some negatives of course the price you pay will be marked up. You gotta understand that the rent they pay here is probably ridiculously high based on the fact that it is on ""the strip"". So whatever profit they make is probably just enough to cover the lease and overhead. So they probably make just enough to make a profit. For lunch today I got the Spicy Karai Burger, Jazz Fries, and a medium drink for 17 and some change. That's with a dollar tip (when you do this, the hot looking chick that takes your order will scream out, ""TIP JELLY!""). Boy am I glad that the drinks are unlimited refills.

The one other negative thing which Fuku has no control over is that there is no bathroom in the area where you will be eating. It is outside about 50 yards down. I would say thats a fail on the design by the architects. What food court does not have a bathroom right there ready to go? 

Some random info: Yes they take cards. Their hours vary. Since they are still practically new, there is no set hours just yet as per the Yelp business listing. Rule of thumb; they are usually open for lunch around 11 and close late on fridays and saturdays. I recommend that you call first before heading out there if you think its late already. I had the pleasure of having a burger named after me. It ended up being called the Roger's free burger special (Refer to pic. Message me if you want to hear the whole story). Which reminds me, sometimes they have specials that are off the wall but amazing like the Ronald McFuku Burger, Chicken and Waffles (the Asian version), and even a longonisa burger (ask any Filipino what that is and they will tell you. Lol).

So in closing, you will be amazed at the flavor you will encounter after eating any one of their menu items here. Also dont be afraid to track down their truck if you dont want to make that trip here to the Linq.

Everything about this place was horrible.  We ate off the FAME menu and the FUKU menu.  The food tasted pretty bad.  Every item on the menu is overpriced.

Now to get to the food! I'm not much of a adventurous person, I like some Japanese cooking & my boyfriend raves about the food truck meets. He brings all his friends from out of town to try it. Heck even a friend of ours from Rhode Island visited and even HE said it was delicious. I know the food truck has quite a major following on their Facebook page!

I ordered a number one burger no tomato, onion, ginger. I added BACON & Shiitake mushrooms (additional toppings are $1.99 EACH). Togarshi Garlic fries have a little KICK to them, but nothing I can't wash down with a Pepsi (32 oz. 3.49). Togarshi Garlic fries come with a side of crack sauce, it's very addicting.

- I'm from the Bay Area & one of my cousins that live in Vegas highly recommended this place. A group of 7 went & it was a disaster. First of all, we had a waiter that didn't know the FukuBurger menu (Fuku is in a shared space w. another Asian inspired restaurant) & one of their waiters took our order..? It was confusing. We ordered & he even repeated our order back, but when we received it.. 
Well, my little sister got served a RAW burger. My Uncle got up right away & complained. Yes, we know they serve 'medium' but it was so raw, it could of Moo'ed. 
Then we realized we were short a burger. We asked the waiter & he started to make an argument about what we ordered. Oh, Don't even, sir. He then shut up & went back to order it. 
The rest of the burgers... They had all the wrong condiments on them.. No avocado spread (which is why my uncle & I ordered that specific burger).. My boyfriend literally only got a handful of Jazz Fries even when we saw others had more w. their burgers. All of the burgers had slaw on it which was only suppose to be on the chicken katsu one.. It was bad. By the time all these things got dealt w. & figured out our food was cold. No refills on drinks. No apologies. 

- All the other guests in the place ordered other food from the other restaurants. Maybe we should of done that.

It is bad because now their is a Fukuburger which is fairly easy to get to and I don't have to go chasing it all over town. This is bad for my waste line and my ever aging heart. Those Japanese have taken the science of burgerology and turned it into an art form. Bachi is till my favorite and true love, but Fuku is my guilty pleasure. It's that little thing I got on the side when I am feeling a little naughty and need something quick, messy debauchery. 

There is no way to describe the burger other than to say it is a hot mess of indistinguishable organic matter that somehow congeals into what I can only imagine ecstasy would taste like if you could make the sensation a flavor. And don't forget the fries. Gotta have the fries. They have a little spice so for those of you who are sensitive to the scoville scale be warned. They are not hot for the normal human, but I dined with someone who has trouble eating bell peppers and they complained about the spice. What ever burger you order needs to have a friend egg on it. That is a need, and should be a law as soon as I can get my bill through the state assembly. 

So why not five stars. Weeellllll...it's not the food. It's the surroundings There is no bathroom in the FAME whatever the hell it is. The bathroom is outside and about 70 meters down from the restaurant. That's fine except a Fukuburger is about one of the messiest things you will ever eat. You can't finish one without covering you hands in a sticky burger paste that is so caustic they should have used to seal up the reactor at Fukashima. It's not something you want to walk 70 meters in the Las Vegas sun hardening on your hands. Second thing is the FAME whatever the hell it is styles itself a night club so at random moments the stereo systems comes blasting out of the speakers until the DJ can get his/her equipment right. But rest assured once he/her gets settled then the music gets really loud. Tuesday night, 7pm, sounded like I was in a meat grinder on top of a iron forge which was built underneath a 747 constantly taking off in the middle of the Electric Daisy Carnival. It was stupidly loud. Next time I might just buy my burger and take it across the street to the Flour & Barley which has a great bar, great bartenders, and a pretty chill Tuesday night vibe.",6EdfElu9BdsecacShHIpTQ,1,1,4,B-Dam0JZFGtyk-n6WkOx-Q

There are 6 burgers from which to choose.  I ordered the Karai burger.  It's a Fuku patty with pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and topped with habeñero kabayaki.  I also ordered the Jazz fries mentioned by some of my Yelp friends.  They are garlic fries topped with a brown gravy and then topped with what Fuku calls their crack sauce.  When you place your order they ask you for a nickname, not your first name.  They want to have some fun with people making up sometimes wild nicknames.  I was going to use what my mother used to call me but then I knew they wouldn't call that out.

I was a little lost.  I got a cup for my soda but I didn't see the fountain service anywhere.  Finally, I asked a woman going by and she helped me.  I got my diet and sat at the high top counter seats and waited.  My nickname was called and I received my tray with a big smile from the cook who prepared it and put it on the tray.

The burger was very good and the fries were even better.  They are like crack.  I could go back just for an order of them.  The burger was juicy, spicy, and the kabayaki crunch on top gave some nice texture to the burger.

One drawback for Fukuburger and FAME is that there are no bathrooms so there's no easy way to rinse your hands which you will NEED to do after finishing your burger.  Your fingers will be messy from the sauces.  I asked for some wet napkins like casinos provide but they had none.  I was directed to the bathrooms down the Linq promenade past the Ghirardelli Chocolate store.

That's where I went after I had dried my fingers as best as I could and I pushed doors open like I was keeping my hands sterile for surgery.  Be forewarned--take some casino wet naps with you to clean your fingers.  It's a curse of eating at Fukubruger but it's a good curse.

4165368,2014-10-22,0,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"well during my recent stay in vegas, i was staying at the flamingo. i walked out of the casino and ran into the alley way with lots of shops and different restaurants to choose from. i looked on yelp and saw this interesting Japanese fusion street cart burgers which looked very appealing. i decided to come here and give it a shot since i was on a time hurry to rush to a show. This place was inside FAME with lots of other asian fusion vendors of food cart or truck style. 

the burger i order was number 6 the spicy burger. All-beef Fuku-patty with pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, finished with habeñero kabayaki sauce. the buns was very fluffy and crisp and surprisingly i ate it all of the buns. the size of the burger wasn't big or small but in the middle size. i was filled but not to the point I'm stuffed but i was feeling great without any fries or soda. i just asked for some water cup. in my burger i can definitely taste the habenero sauce with the creamy texture of avocado sauce. i was having some major foodgasm in some of the bites. although i did taste some sweetness probably from the pickled cucumbers. i also requested to add tam ago which is an over easy egg but the egg was kind of over cooked and it didn't make the buyer special or looked as good like in the picture they advertise but overall this burger was 4 out of 5. i was happy and satisfied and wasn't hungry at the end of the night. 

the service of the girl was nice and friendly and answered our questions that i had. i also asked about the option of the adding an egg to my burger but it was 1.99 for the over cooked egg which i was kind of disappointed.",gtJsj5RpF4dfE7uPVDRfDQ,0,0,4,NaF88k6vzQxqzkfy5MarWw

I was expecting something more for the price tag on the burger...more along the lines of STOUT, but it didn't deliver.  Even the togarashi french fries were average.

4440083,2015-01-05,2,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"A burger joint hidden inside a dim sum place. That should have been the first warning sign!  We were a pretty large party of 19 and everyone felt the same way.  The burgers were average, the service wasn't great, and fries were just 'meh.'

First off, the burger seemed a little undercooked. I mentioned it to the waiter, and he said that's just how they cook them.  The buns were a under-whelming. They were not even toasted, so for me, they seemed like plain buns right out of the supermarket.  My first bite seemed like it had decent flavor, but the taste of the burger just died after subsequent bites. I guess I just wasn't digging the 'Asian' flair.

The fries were okay, but with the price of the burger, you'd think fries would be included!  Hey, it's Vegas right?

If you measure service by how long between being seated, ordering, and getting our food,  service also gets 2 stars. Our waiter was new, and he had a good sense of humor, but it took 30 minutes to get our food!  It's just a burger!  

Anyways, we don't live in Vegas, so there's not much of a question about re-visiting this place. Many more places to try the next time we're in town.",rH5qfRuk_TbUFRcYxiGrbQ,0,0,2,_JH29b25A3by_NLr1XRZyg

i love a good, juicy burger and my friend who is a local said this place is BOMB. (thought my friend would know better since we've dined together and had great  meals around the area)  but WTF. 

$8/burger.  We ordered #1 (a regular burger) and #2 (burger with egg and lots of weird sauce).  I was hoping my egg would be runny, but it was overcooked, tiny, and really salty.  $3-$4 for the fries. Ordered both the garlic fries and the gravy fries.  MEH. I prefer IN N OUT over this garbage.  I think they thought I was a local or an employee because I got a pretty damn good discount on top of my order... whateverz...it was still nasty. lol

the only fun thing about this place is that you can get creative with your name by giving them a nickname.  so when your food is ready, they will call your ""name"".  my gf and i thought it'd be funny to be called ""hot mama"", so when our food was ready, they announced ""hot mama, your order is ready"" lol 

the people are super friendly and service is great... their food is just junk.",N4K69ZdyU-B8NzVYxwjK0A,13,12,1,62cJOs0cpf-wDKSw0BufgQ

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.

Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!",xsT4KZTu_KnOVavtuXn4RA,54,55,4,TEMSw_r9fVeuOz1Yo9CuXg

4583044,2014-06-20,0,icsmeOong1Ac5AcwKKuqgQ,"This was the first time I have tried a Fuku Burger. I have been hearing about the Fuku Burger food truck for quite some time now. I am not one as to be so inclined as to chase a food truck around town for a burger. If I did ever do it though, this would be the burger.

I was over at the Linq and I heard they opened a Fuku Burger inside Fame. It is over in the right corner of Fame. I stopped in and grabbed a few burgers to-go so I could try these famous burgers I have been hearing about. I will say, I was not disappointed at all.

I ordered the Kinko Burger, Kari Burger, and the Lucky Burger. I don't know which burger was which, but they were all very good. The one with the mushrooms was kinda sweet. I think it had teriyaki sauce on it. Which ever one was spicy was my favorite. They are not really big, so I could eat two with no problem.

Anyways, now I know why people are always talking about the Fuku Burger food truck. Excellent burgers. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a great burger.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,1,2,4,87Bn9eBNV5zg8dCYrAv3iA

* The Tamago burger was really yummy! Something abt the egg that made the whole burger a delicious one! And the crispy onion strips! 
~ The Buta burger was okay for me. The patty tasted a bit dry & the Japanese BBQ sauce seemed to overpower the taste of the burger. 
* The Jazz fries were BOMB. The gravy and everything made it soooo good. 

In addition the service was good. Think of a really silly name for your order & they'll proudly call it out when it's ready! LOL",eg5_UqSkU534qD7s3HuRZQ,1,0,4,HdC3zxDVwubWf6XKNWsB5Q

I placed my order and it took a really long time to get the food. They were spitting out maybe 1 order every 10 minutes. So 2 people and about 20 minutes later, I finally got my to-go order.

Also ordered some garlic fries. Horrible. No garlic taste whatsoever, and if you hadn't told me, I would've thought they were just regular fries. And soggy fries at that. Bummer.",uU2B1vrqkpWJI30xoooabw,0,0,4,Obd20n2TbRVPZaigwMaLjw

I had already tried Fuku before, so I knew it was dope. My date and I shared two burgers and some jazz fries. Have to share burgers so you can try the different kinds.
Price was good. little under 30.00 bucks for 2 burgers, jazz fries and one drink. 
DIY fountain drinks, love those... Love those even more when plain soda water is the option. ( hint hint) 

The guy taking our order was super funny and asked us to give a silly name, I love fun people like that, adding entertainment to the place.

The burgers range from about $8-10, but just for the burger itself. Everything is paid separately. If you get a drink though, you can get $1 off.
