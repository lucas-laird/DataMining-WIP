121170,2017-01-16,0,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"Decided to try something different as I haven't been thrilled with their curry (red or panang) lately. Used to like the pumpkin curry, but last time I ordered it I was only given 1 piece of pumpkin.

Ordered the Mongolian Beef.....won't make that mistake again. They gave me more white rice than actual entree, the beef was overcooked and dry. They loaded up the entree with sliced carrots, which aren't even supposed to be in Mongolian Beef (description says peppers and mushrooms).

My son and husband still love the Pad Thai and their rangoons are pretty good. But, that is about all I can say is good here. They skimp on the veggies, the curry is kindof bland, their larb not good, hot and sour soup also bland.

Pros: Excellent, authentic Thai tea.   Service is very friendly.  Willing to accommodate special requests in your dish.

Cons:  Inconsistent quality.  And when you ask for level 1 spice out of 10, it will often be the same as when you ask for 5 or higher.  Very little chicken (which is usually tough) in the chicken curry, which includes more carrots than any other vegetable, but also includes green bell peppers, usually wilted/bitter/aging basil, and then the usual ingredients in that dish that you would expect.  Pad Thai flavor is good, but often the sprouts are old and getting slightly slimy/funky.  Chicken is a little dry and tough in this as well.",5fTEVByUVKUhrS-hA4rRNQ,1,0,3,2Ht5ldtrZxldti0GwWPFcQ

The Pad See Ew is excellent, and  the combination beef soup is tasty and full of flavor because they use three different kinds of beef. The broth is probably made with beef bones but is really heavy broth. I have yet to try the Tom Yum Soup noodle. Thai ice tea one of the best I've tried.

The Pineapple fried rice was just as awesome as at the other location.

I unfortunately was not impressed at all. My order consisted of chicken satay, crab Rangoon and pad Thai chicken spicy. 

The chicken satay was made of chicken that had the texture of cardboard and was bland. The peanut sauce didn't do the satay any favors either. The crab Rangoon was ok, nothing special about it nor can I say it wasn't good. The sweat and sour sauce that came with it was watery. The main dish, the pad Thai chicken was mediocre. There is a distinct difference in pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant and pad Thai noodles from an authentic Thai restaurant, these favored Chinese, which was very disappointing. The spicy was rather weak and the chicken in the dish also had a cardboard taste.

The rad nar is lacking in the flavor department -needs garlic- and they tend to skimp on the coconut milk in the curry. It's a mystery as to why the noodle soups get cold so quick when eating there.

Me had chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Loved them both. We could have shared either dish because the portion size was nice. Not crazy large but a healthy portion. 

Although we didn't partake in desert they had a nice menu. Price was perfect. They don't serve fountain drinks. This usually annoys me but at 1.25 per can I spent less on drinks than any chain restaurant. I even had TWO cans!!!

They also did not offer me a place to sit. I just sat down. Maybe I just have different expectations? 

Their Pad Thai was weird. It was very dark and kind of clumpy. It wasn't horrible, but not the best I've ever had. My friend had Thai food from Weera Thai, and their Pad Thai was a lot lighter.

It was a Saturday and I was greeted right away which is always a plus, we sat by the fish tank, it kept the kids occupied for awhile. I ordered the papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad see ewe , and bbq pork. The papaya salad was good but a little too sweet for my taste. Tom yum soup was delicious as well as the bbq pork. My kids liked the pad see ewe but to me it was just ok. I would actually only rate the food 3 1/2 stars but the reason it got 5 was the service was great. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, and he was able to comply to all my special requests (since my kids are picky). it usually is hard to find really good service in Asian restaurants because they usually hire people with no personalities and don't speak that much, and I was happy to have a waiter that could not only conversate and make me laugh but more importantly make my kids happy.

The pad thai was a big clump of sticky gummy ramen like noodles you could barely chew let alone swallow, but the flavor was good they need a flatter noodle and the chicken was over cooked. The pad se ew had good flavor but the noodles were not wide the pork was tough.

The Pad thai showed up in a large clump of mushy noodles.  The flavors were all there, but the texture ruined the dish.  

The Fried Chicken wings had feathers on them.  Yes, feathers.  This should never happen, but clearly someone in the kitchen was rushing.  Either way, disgusting.

The Pineapple fried rice lacked the flavor many others have had, but it wasn't gross, just not very good.  It was on the light side which was nice, but still is not worth ordering.

I also got Som Tum and pork. This was just OK, especially the meat, which was a bit on the dry side and tasting slightly like liver. It came with two sauces and I preferred the one with vinegar rather than the sweet one although I'm not a big fan of vinegary tastes. The sticky rice that came with it was bad. It came in a bamboo container, I guess, to keep it moist. However, it was so tough, especially around the edges, that I didn't like it.

RECOMMEND: 
- TOFU PAD THAI: Stir fried small rice noodles with egg, ground peanuts, bean sprouts in pad thai sauce. (I ordinarily would order this with chicken, if I could eat meat!)
- SHRIMP YELLOW CURRY: Coconut milk mixed with white onions, bell peppers, tomatoes & potatoes, with side of white rice. 
- SHRIMP PAD SEW: Stir fried flat rice noodles and egg with broccoli in sweet black soy sauce. (I usually prefer this dish with beef, but like I said, lent no meat fridays!)
- SEAFOOD WONTON SOUP: Wonton soup with seafood and yoo choy in clear broth. Add noodles to it for $0.75! 

Everything extremely satisfactory and hit the spot! Service was good, venue was nice, and the portions were filling! New to the southwest area and I think we officially found our go-to Thai place! :)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,3,0,4,C_rY0JwrDcUvcA6ca5CEzA

I discovered this place via Yelp and was so excited when they opened this location closer to my home!  

We frequent this place and I've tried most of the more appealing items on the menu.

Must haves:

Coconut Water!  Try it!  It's sweet with chunks of coconut right in the glass.  Surprisingly good!

Thai style pot stickers...quality deep fried dumplings, but with a kicker.  Three different sauces on top.  Believe it or not, makes all the difference.  Amazing!

Grilled beef or pork salad.  Thai style salads are great!  Crunchy and tasty, TSNH makes one of the best.  It's a great combination of meat and veggies and priced well for the size too.

Roasted Duck Noodle Soup.  Sweet and plentiful.  You can choose your noodles, so I usually pick the thicker rice noodles and add wontons for extra heartiness.  Sweet broth goes perfectly with the duck and it's filling and good!

Tom Yum  Noodle Soup.  My friend's favorite!  Coconut base with a spicy bite.  That sweet and sour flavor is unmistakable and again, big portions, hearty and filling!

Khua Kai.  I compare this to it's chinese counterpart of fried rice noodles, but they serve it with a side of duck sauce that makes the thai version just a hair better.  Pretty simple dish, fried with scallions and egg with soy sauce, but when you mix it with the duck sauce...it's a perfect match!

Duck fried rice.  The duck adds a moist, more tender meat than your typical chicken, beef and pork.  Add that to a definite thai style of fried rice here, and it's just great fried rice!

Mangos with sweet sticky rice.  I grew up on sticky rice and this dessert runs $6 at the thai place down the street!  It's the same thing and always tastes better when it's less expensive!",u4Y-CDYvowTnNyBg8tTkrg,6,5,5,9f5jx4bDYb3nTWid3aFVog

I have been to both locations. I stopped going to the other because of sanitary reasons. I saw the dude cooking on the wok sneeze in to his hand, then continue cooking. I asked the waitress and she said, ""no he did not"" ... OK ... gross.

Then here ... previously, cheap and decent Thai food.

Until this week. Ordered food ... it came, the pot sticklers which are usually excellent were dripping grease and covered/swimming in sauce. Not a good start. The soup and salad came, and so did a little friend walking across the floor.  Actually not so little. A roach in the middle of the dining room. When I went to the manager/cashier about it, she said they have no problems - they spray all the time. I said then what about the roach in the middle of the restaurant, she said it must have come from outside. (After leaving the business, not one roach, anywhere.) I find this very hard to believe when on previous experience I had health concerns with their other location - in fact, I just learned the other location was temporarily closed by the Southern Nevada Health District last month. I think it is time for an inspection of this location as well.

For what it is worth, I offered to pay, I kept asking how much do I owe you - I kept asking, again, kept asking - yet she was on a very long conversation in Thai (I assume with an owner) about the roach issue. She did not make me pay, which in all honesty is what should have been offered in the beginning, since we did not eat and we were interrupted by pests.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,1,0,2,hUBCQOTyNpzp3pePNEI2Jg

Interior is what it is too, nothing super splendid but not shabby either.  They have the Thai channel on as you wait for your food, which can be entertaining at times to see the monkey dancing and other oddities.  Service is fine- quick and attentive.

But their food..  very, very nice.  There was only one other place in Vegas that had bigger portions of pad thai, but that place closed down.  Whomp whomp.  I've tried plenty of their dishes and it's only when I tasted their praram dish that I had to write a review.  It's a stir fry of vegetables and any choice of meat, topped with peanut sauce.  To my, peanut sauce is like an aphrodisiac, and this dish had PLENTY.  So.  Good.

I went here with a friend and I've been returning with more friends ever since.  I'm always hungry late night so an hour or two before they close, if I'm feeling hungry, I'll stop by the place and get something quick.

I ordered the Hot and Sour special soup with flat noodles. My roomie ordered the spicy basil fried rice with beef. The Hot and Sour soup was not as flavorful as I had thought it would be. It was definitely sour, though. The soup comes with multiple meats but my favorites were the ground chicken and pork (everything else was eh). I'm giving this place 4 stars because I ended up enjoying my roomie's fried rice more than I liked my own meal. 

Maybe next time I'll try something different. Will come back with hopes to be proven wrong about future dishes.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,1,0,4,BtrJOJjWxBSAOlzzcOLl_A

2188824,2016-05-22,2,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"I may not be the best to read a review from because I order the same thing every single time.  Yellow curry with chicken, no potatoes, no potatoes and extra chicken.   I think it's some of the tastiest yellow curry around.   Plus the prices are very solid (I think my meal is like $8).   Most places are at least a few dollars more for the same thing.  They are weak with the spicy.  When they ask what level of spicy I want from 1 to 10, I always say 20 and tell them I want it really really really hot.   To the point that I'll cry from the heat.   And maybe one out of 8 times it's as insanely spicy as I want it.   It's always tasty though.   As always they give not nearly enough rice as you need (but no Thai place does) so I just make more at home and usually turn my dish into 2 meals.  

I usually choose take out but sometimes I eat in.  The service isn't too great.  They get the waters to you pretty quickly and take your order fast but you hardly see them after they bring you your food.   Slacking on the water fill up a little usually but it's all good with me.   I'll go up to the counter if I need something which is slightly inconvenient.  

The place is modern and clean on the inside from what I can see (their chinatown location is pretty gross, I wouldn't eat there) but I never got a gander into the kitchen.   I've had the beef pad-see-ew (probably bad spelling) and thought it was a nice portion and tasty.   

If they could step up the spicy and have better service Id give them 5 stars.   If you want quality, nice portions, tasty and a respectable price point, give this place a try.",lzgEUPNFGboDm1U7aO8gTQ,2,1,4,PLfdj5jygef_VjTt4ecX6Q

I used to go to Archi's for thai food but after discovering Thai Style Noodle House, I have not stepped foot in the former. It's also a plus that this place is right next to my house. There is another Thai Style Noodle House location in chinatown but this one is about a 5-7 minute drive from my house. The portions are pretty generous for Thai food. If you eat a lot of Thai food, you'll know that the servings area always tiny. This place is the total opposite. The plates are always full and very affordable. ~$50 could feed my whole family (4) with left overs. Another reason I love this place is because it's very family oriented. Everyone here is really nice and they're always coming around to make sure everything is alright even though it's always packed when I go. It's nice to see how attentive they are, especially since their staff is very small.

My favorite dish here is the Pad See Eu with beef. MMM. I am salivating just thinking about it! A second favorite is the spicy eggplant with tofu. I usually get the spice level at a medium so it's not too overpowering. The duck fried rice is a good option too! Oh and don't forget the squid salad, potstickers, and last but not least... the mango sticky rice! It is absolutely AMAZING!! I could go on and on about the different food items that I love here.

The lady who took my order was neutral but courteous, and she repeated my order correctly without me asking. I ordered the Khua-Kai rice noodles, Beef Basil fried rice, the Choo-chee Chicken Curry, an order of potstickers, and two Thai teas. Everything turned out to be good and tasty, especially the Curry! I didn't even notice that the Basil Beef I ordered came with the rice on the side instead of everything fried together...actually I just thought of it now, so it was obviously that good! The potstickers came with a few sauces drizzled on top, which was nice because it was already prepared. Also, I usually order the Thai tea without ice, so it doesn't get diluted and when I get home I dilute the tea with some of my own tea because it is really, very sweet and I get a few more glasses out of it. 

I would prefer to dine-in because I think they are more generous with the portions as opposed to how much they serve with take out. However, it was still filling, delicious, and not so heavy!

I didn't have high expectations going in, since this was Plan B for dinner, so that's probably the only reason why I didn't give them a 1.

First off there was something wrong with the service, I don't know, it was the most MEH experience I've ever had.  The lady who served us only smiled once and this was when it was time to pay, as if she was only happy to see money. We all ordered water maybe that added to why we got that service.

The food we also received were complete opposites from what I've seen on the pics and what was described in the reviews.  One of the dish we ordered was the yellow curry.  The flavor in the curry was decent but there were very little ingredients.  It was mostly sauce and it was very watery.  Another dish we ordered was the chow mein, the noodles were dry and it was all very salty. And another was the fried chicken, HORRIBLE don't ever order this, it was rubbery and tiny like microwaved chicken.

I don't know maybe I went on bad night or they just sensed that this was my Plan B for dinner.  I probably won't be back.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,4,0,2,DYrTbFkZtpNkz078dkSkmg

We had duck noodle soup (I didn't get a taste, my daughter became quite defensive after her first bite), orange chicken and red curry with pumpkin and chicken.  Orange chicken was the bomb!  Tangy, crispy, and light - the breading enhanced the flavor rather than acting as filler.  Red curry was marvelous, with carrots, green pepper and basil.  I've had a lot of Thai curries and this was one of the better ones - light on the coconut milk, nice variety of textures and flavor.  I ordered it medium hot which was right for me and I eat spicy food.  I suspect the hot would be very hot.

We ordered the Khua-Kai, the combination Beef Noodle Soup (with glass noodle), and a dish not even offered on the menu.  Every single dish tasted just as good as the other Thai Style Noodle House, which is saying a lot.  Thai food is difficult to cook, and a lot of places have a disparity between the original chef and new chefs.  TSNH2 does not suffer from this hurdle as much as other Las Vegas Thai restaurants have shown in the past.

The Khua-Kai was spot on with the noodles and the sprouts and the homemade sweet and sour sauce.  We quite enjoyed it.  It was a nice balance to the spicier dishes that we ordered.

The combination Beef Noodle Soup is a must try at TSNH, as far as I am concerned.  The broth was just as rich and flavorful as the original location.  Most Thai places use a rather thin broth for this dish, but TSNH uses a thick and creamy beef based broth that cooks all day long.  Its just amazing.  I had this same soup at the original TSNH yesterday, and today at the new location it tasted exactly the same.  Loved it.

Overall, if you live in this part of town, this is the Thai restaurant to go to.  It is the most authentic out of the other spots located in this area, and it just tastes better.

Prices weren't too bad. $6.95 for a chicken pad thai plate. Couple bucks more if you want shrimp instead of chicken.

My boyfriend and I both got pad thai. Sorry...I'm original like that. I just can't go to a thai restaurant and NOT get pad thai. I would LOVE to try something different...but I could just never seem to do it.

I like spicy foods. Side note: not sure if everyone is aware of this, but on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the LEAST spicy and 10 being the MOST. Not sure if its different in other thai restaurants but I personally never knew that. Here I've been getting spicy level 4 thinking #1 was considered the MOST spicy. -__- oh geez. Sooooo....I ended up getting a level 8 spiciness. 

Getting back to the food, I really loved this place. My pad thai came out pippin' hot and the spiciness was on point. Definitely the kind of spice I was expecting. It has a kick to it without having to sip on water every 30 seconds.

The good:
Great prices (GREAT prices)
Good portions (not great)
Very good food with wonderfully aromatic and flavorful sauces

The bad:
As some other reviewers noted, the chairs need to be cleaned or re-upholstered
The place plays like a take out place that coincidentally has tables - as a result the service isn't amazing, its not BAD, but its just not great.  That said, for this price, you can't get amazing service, or the place goes belly up because the economics stop working with that additional server.
Staff is friendly and helpful.

The ugly:
We ordered vermicelli chicken noodle soup.  The soup was GREAT.  We ordered vermicelli because one of the people in the party had an egg allergy.  We asked when it arrived, and they confirmed it was an egg noodle dish.  They offered to replace it (thank you), but the definition of vermicelli (confirmed with wikipedia) is a rice noodle
The Red Snapper tasted more like Tilapia

We were soooo excited and happy that we found a Great Thai Food place with Great tasting and with consistency since we are absolute die hard fan of Thai and Chinese food. But on the third visit we placed order by phone for pick up. Upon arriving home and looking at dish we ordered (Mongolian Beef was one), food did not look anything close or taste anything close to Mongolian Beef which we had for soo many times. White color cooked meat in a runny watery beige liquid. Being one of die-hard fan of this dish and having it for past 25+ years I never seen a Mongolian Beef looking like this. Total disappointment. 
Today 8/28 my wife and I figured to give them one more chance. What a Mistake that was. the best part of the lunch was cold can of coke. Pineapple Curry which I ordered was sooo watery. My wife's food had totally different color (Same Dishes we both orders the first 2 visit) and tasted completely different. When asked why the food look  and taste so much different they could not give us an straight answer. Appears they use the earlier customers left over and mix few stuff to serve the new customers order. That seems the only explanation that we can come up with if the owner claims everything in the restaurant is the same as before. 
Bottom line going to this place is like rolling the dice. if you are lucky you end up with good food otherwise you are in for an experience which turns you off from any Thai food.",JXLe5olZU6ssfyTTs9TAqA,0,0,1,ZZ4mcas7S9BtcY5k5AfuBA

I'm glad I found this place as it is sort of on the way home from my daughter's school.

I ordered the Pad Thai and when she asked what meat I would like I told her I don't eat meat so she asked if I wanted tofu. It was not offered on the menu so I was pleasantly surprised. It's always nice to be offered different options in proteins instead of just settling for no protein at all.

The food was delicious. I had the Pineapple Curry Shrimp, but substituted the shrimp with chicken instead, which they had no issue with. My boyfriend had the Panang Curry. We also had the Chicken Satay and the Pad Thai with Beef to share. All of which was very tasteful. My only issue was they don't give nearly as much rice as I hoped they would. But, maybe that's just the Asian in me, ha. 

The service, however, was subpar. It wasn't very busy when we got there - maybe three other tables. Our first waitress was nice, but quiet. Which isn't really an issue. She took our order for food and drinks and that was that. The second waitress who brought our food out, wasn't very welcoming - sort of had a ""I don't really care"" attitude. She gave my plate to my bf's brother, even after I said it was mine and vice versa. We also didn't get our drinks, until we asked again, and when the waitress brought them out, she swapped them around again. No big deal, but there were only three of us at the table.

The menu prices are definitely a steal compared to other Thai places I've been to, and the menu choices are diverse ranging from classic curries to a variety of noodles (each with a description). 

Wanting something healthy, I ordered the Papaya Salad- crunchy julienned green papaya, peanuts and tomatoes tossed together in a sour, sweet, and slightly spicy (level 3) vinaigrette. The vinaigrette also had fish sauce in it, so if you're not a fan of fish sauce, I'd recommend something else. On the side of the heap of papaya salad were a few pieces of cabbage. The salad was refreshing and light. My only complaints are: 1) The tomato pieces on top were mushy; and 2) I wish they added more peanuts. The peanuts added depth to the salad, and cut the vinegary-ness of the dressing. Overall, however, I enjoyed the salad very much. I also tried a bit of the Green Curry w/ brown rice which was really yummy. Spicy, but not too spicy. Sweet, but not too sweet. Just really tasty.

I also am a fan of the water! They put slices of fruit (lemons, strawberries & green apples) in the water pitcher, which I thought was pretty and gave the water a nice taste. The server made sure my water glass was never empty.

Small, cozy little restaurant with a pretty big menu and really great prices. I had the hardest time deciding but I went with the panang chicken and some fried flat noodles.

The noodles came out first and I had planned to eat only half of it while the panang was coming out. Well, I've never been good on that portion control thingy and I ended up scarfing the whole plate of noodles down. It came with Thai sweet chili sauce and I added sriracha on top of all that. Very delicious, better than my usual pad see ew. 

The panang was simple, not filled with bamboo shoots and other veggies. Just a nice thick curry sauce and some red pepper flakes and of course the chicken. Although I don't mind bamboo and veggies I prefer my panang simply made like this. It was a little bit salty which may be bad for most but I loved it cuz I am a sodium freak.

I would love to come back and try all the other dishes. The Thai beef noodle soup and grilled meat dishes looked really good. The service was very friendly and attentive.

The great thing is that this isn't their only location. Phewww, cuz out of all 3 this was the furthest from my house. But if  this were the only location, I would definetly come back here.

3418405,2013-02-11,0,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. It's located in the same plaza as Sweet Addictions, right across from iHOP. Came here because a friend wanted to try it out, overall experience wasn't that bad at all. 

We decided to do it family style and get three dishes that we would all share. First up was the Papaya Salad, I've never had it before this, but it was good. Nothing too notable, papaya, carrots, peppers, tomato, and cabbage with a sauce that I can't really describe the taste (gotta try it again). I think we ordered a 6 as far as the spicy level goes, it wasn't overly spicy but you can definitely tell it was spicy. I think I was expecting something different as far as how spicy this was going to be, so it caught me a little off guard. 

We got a Green Curry Fried Rice with chicken, also level 6 spicy. This was pretty good, none of us have had it before so we weren't sure what to expect, but it's literally the green curry flavoring cooked into their fried rice. It wasn't overly powering, but you can definitely taste the green curry along with our choice level of spiciness. It contained the chicken, green bean, bean sprout, and carrots, don't recall if there was anything else in it. It wasn't dry at all, which was good, they didn't over cook it! 

And lastly we got the Choo Chee Salmon, which none of us have had but heard good things about. So this was the best thing out of all the dishes we ordered. I really enjoyed the sauce, which was semi sweet. I'll need to try it a few more times before I can figure out what was in it, but it was good and I will definitely be ordering this again when I go back! The salmon was moist and cooked very well. My friends and I all enjoyed it and actually wanted more, though we were pretty stuffed by the end.

The cost overall between three people was $10 each including tip, so it wasn't bad at all. We were all satisfied at the end.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,4,4,4,u6HuY9JlgcGi6fUAQ-KwJQ

3459593,2010-09-21,6,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"Actually Thai Style Noodle House #2, this is a sister/twin of Thai Style Noodle House on Wynn Road. I have written a review for Thai Style #1previously. 

The decor for #2 is much nicer than #1. It still has the feel of a local eatery and it's in a newly build strip mall. There is an ornate brass ceiling with chandeliers but the walls are plain orange with a few Pier 1 type art pieces hanging. Nothing too fancy or garish. Nice. The place had a steady stream of customers...not too crowded and not too awkwardly lonely either. A perfect lunch spot. 

The service here was also just as good as #1. One of the waitresses at #2 was the same waitress I had at #1. 

I was slightly miffed that they did not have vegetarian/vegan lunch specials (as I was told that by the waitress) and had to order off the menu. I ordered the Papaya Salad and the Spicy Flat Noodles (Pad Kee Mao on Thai menus usually). I liked that they had the option to get steamed tofu instead of friend. I opted for the steamed and have to say although let's face it, the fried is much better, this was rather good. I got my food within 10 minutes. The papaya salad was consistent with my experience at #1 and the Flat Noodles were also tasty. I didn't like the addition of white pepper on top of the noodles as a finishing touch. I might tell them to omit that the next time I go there. The flat noodles was sauteed with basil, garlic, steamed tofu, carrots, onions and cabbage. Not out of this world but tasty and satisfied me for lunch.

Papaya Salad + Spicy Flat Noodles + Diet Coke = $15. The meal will last me at least one more day. Not too shabby but would have appreciated a veggie lunch special. 

I'm glad these guys opened up something on this side of town. It's close to work and I can frequent when I have a Thai craving. 

PS. I tried to take pictures and make this the first review that I started picture adding but I don't know how to turn off the flash on my camera...currently all my pics are bright lights.

3592594,2011-08-28,0,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"The Ft. Apache location of the Thai Style Noodle House may be the sister to the Chinatown original, but they hail from a different mother.

To be sure, the food is almost as good as it's more popular sibling, but that is no surprise, assuming the recipes got passed along at birth. But that's where the similarities end with this western valley reproduction of a well-loved Chinatown eatery (which is sad news for those of us who live in the western valley).

In my review of the original, I bemoaned the absence of an accommodating server who could provide the suggestions I crave when on a maiden voyage. It is fair to assume the language barrier played a significant role in this, but the server did do an excellent job with everything else - and I had Yelp to help out with the suggestion portion.

The same could not be said for the Ft. Apache location. Not only was there no perceivable language barrier, but, as the only customer during the lunch ""rush"", the server was presented ample opportunity to showcase his skills. It is here where he failed -monumentally.

It's hard to describe the feeling of invisibility, especially if the reader has never experienced such loneliness or felt the overwhelming desire to do a Huckleberry Finn on the fence post. It is especially difficult to imagine being ignored when you are the only customer in the place. Suffice it to say, I nearly had to cry out in anguish EVERY time I needed anything, from placing my order to requesting a refill to procuring the check.

Not only did the server not care about my presence in his establishment, he seemed perturbed by the rare interaction he did have with me. To add insult to massive injury, his response to my credit card was (and I quote) ""Don't you have cash?"" (picture Paris Hilton discovering her rental choices did not include a pink Cadillac Escalade.)

I half expected the bill to arrive in some minimum $25 charge, as some restaurants are wont to threaten with their little placards next to the register. 

I was delighted to see that the server only charged my card the exact amount of my bill - it was, sadly, the highlight of my visit.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,3,0,3,hWEnfjFNzjYHD9Xj8_zIww

Their location in Chinatown is surrounded by Thai places and on Fort Apache theres an abundant amount of Thai places. I don't think TSNH is a knock out for the other restaurants its competing against, but its cheap.

The value of the items you order is a great bang for the buck and they have a large variety of noodles. Although it always weirds me out when I see a Thai restaurant sell won ton noodles. 

Sometimes the wait time is a bit long (I see an elderly thai lady working in the kitchen which is a good and bad thing). If you come here in a party, I would probably skip the chef specials, not because they're not good, but because you'll probably be waiting another 10 minutes or so while your friends are grubbing.

All item were authentic. 

Service was great. I believe the waitress came from #1. The restaurant is very cute and comfortable. The food came out really fast too.

I would definitely recommend this place over any Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Thai Style Noodle House #1 and #2 are my first choices! If you want the old school feel i would go to #1 and more modern would be #2... both same in taste..",jIRgbpHbalnlcHMLEFQ9fg,6,7,5,oWdik1cPQXVR257cRw2rtA

Cheap, straight forward Thai food. My only gripe is that they don't have Thai chilis in fish sauce as a condiment. It's not the best Thai I've had but satisfies any Thai food craving.

My go to dish is the spicy eggplant with fried tofu. My son loves the pad see ew (spelling?) with chicken. Their pad thai is also good. My husband likes the Penang curry. Their papaya salad I think is the most authentic in Vegas. We've had ginger chicken, steamed snapper, and tom yum goong as well. I think we've had other dishes, but we get the ones over.

If you're used to the traditional flavors of Thai food, then there's a possibility that you may not like this place. AND the reason why I say that is because of the pad thai & the ladnar (Sp?). These are two dishes that I ordinarily do NOT like at other places, there's usually a funky taste to them and I have no idea how to describe them, they taste almost spoiled to me...

I can say that dollar for dollar, this place makes the best Thai style steak salad in America. Is that too bold of a statement? Maybe. But for under $8, nothing can taste more amazing.

See, I'm in a good mood so I wrote a 5 star review, but like any restaurant you visit frequently enough, consistency can be their downfall. 4-5 stars based on the chef working there that day.

Another thing to point out is the level of spiciness 1-10.  But that's not their fault, it's our fickle diners. That's why I vote for a Universal Spiciness Barometer.  We need Thai style reform. We need to start here.",PAzgMhSXGokkOw2CMZUI1w,5,6,5,EeMgfPBBAZEYfpkfLhb5mg
4392574,2018-03-20,1,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"I dont know why I haven't reviewed this place since we've been coming here for about 5 years now. Anyway, to start it off, I'd like to explain that the 1 shy of star from a 4 star is due to the piece of hair i found on my Pad Thai from my to go order today and inconsistent service. The service in this place is almost always bad for both dine in and to go orders. But I wont complain too much since husband and I choose to come back over and over again. It's not the best Thai food we've had in town but it satisfies a good Thai food crave. We come back for the consistency in taste and price. My husband and I probably only cook at home twice a month so the rest of the days, we eat out twice or three times a day even. This place is one of our cheap spots. If you might wonder what's the best Thai food we've had in town so far is my friend's family home cooking lol jk. Im saying, I'm not Thai but have had good home cooked Thai meals so I know what to compare restaurants dishes to. I really like Archie's on Sahara and Fort Apache the best so far. And the worst would have to be Thai Place on Maryland and Flamingo. We've had quite a few different dishes from here over the few years and haven't really been disappointed. We've had some of the Chinese dishes as well, Sweet and Sour and Orange Chicken, etc, but I wont recommend them since...why would I when you're at in Thai restaurant? Kids love them though.

Dishes that we usually order on repeat and highly recommend are:
Pad Thai and Papaya Salad of course, Pad See Eu/Ew, Rad Na, Yellow Curry, Panang Curry, Pineapple Curry, Cashew Nuts rice plate, Spicy Basil Leaf rice plate, Grill Salad, and Crab Fried Rice.

Ok dishes:
Three Companion, Tom Yum, Khua Kai, Pineapple Fried Rice and Spicy Basil Leaf Fried Rice.

Would not recommend:
Pra Ram rice plate did not look nor tasted appetizing at all.

Their menu says Vegetarian options are available upon request on each items on the menu. If you are a true Vegetarian then make sure to ask about fish sauce on the dishes. I am a Pescatarian so I usually order dishes with Tofu (steamed sometimes fried) or sometimes Shrimp. My husband eats chicken and beef. All the dishes I mentioned above are good with all, chicken, beef, shrimp and tofu.

I love spicy food but am not a champ at it and my husband is not a fan. But Thai restaurant spice levels are nothing compared to home cooked Thai spice level. So most patrons should be safe here. I usually order spicy level 7/8 for a good heat and still enjoy or even 10 if I want a challenge since I need to drink lots of water since I didnt the past days lol. I can handle them but my husband's limit is 5.

TSNH 2 location is closest to us since it's on the outskirt of Summerlin South. We've also been to the one in ChiTown and Jones but TSNH 2 is better.",AkxF-Hc7e8iAQkcTcJHGiA,0,0,3,Lr_BsX4l-RCc2jwoHUCn9A

My wife and I ordered a well received yelp favorite here, the Pineapple Fried Rice, which was FANTASTIC! Throughout the fried rice were cashews and pineapple chunks which added such a distinctive brightness to the rice. The dish was flawless. I would go here again and again just for that rice alone.

We also ordered the Sliced Beef and Vermicelli Noodle Soup with Bok Choy. This was a perfect entree for this cold fall night.

I ordered the BBQ Pork Rice Plate which I would usually order in a Vietnamese restaurant.  It was brought out with a clear soup at the same time.

4479106,2012-08-22,0,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"Pin Kaow is my all time favorite Thai restaurant and I have always been a bit sketcy about trying different thai places due to recurring disappointment.
I noticed this place that is right up the street from my house and was really curious, I read all the reviews and most of them were really good so I decided to try this place for a work week lunch ( not to ruin my date night dinner, if I was disappointed).
Well to my surprise, this place was really good. 
I ordered the Shrimp fried rice #10 (as I always do)
I told my coworker that it was almost perfect, my only hold back was that the shrimp were a little on the medium/small side and were a little dried out but the flavors were DELICIOUS and they actually made it a #10 as most places don't think that I can handle it and usually make it around a #6 or #7!!!
Keep in mind that the shrimp might have been like that because I did get it to go and they most likely just kept cooking in the to go container.

I went home and told my husband about it and we made plans to go that Friday and he would test it out to see if he would like it.
Skeptical as I was, he was so surprised at how much he LOVED IT!!!! 
He oredered the Duck Fried rice #10, we split the Shrimp Pad Se Eww #10 and I again got Shrimp fried rice number #10. This time the shrimp were perfect, I think it makes a difference when you take it to go.
The pad se eww was delicious as was the duck fried rice.
The next best thing was the Price All 2 dishes came to just over $27.00. I couldn't even believe it. When we order those same 3 dishes at Pin Kaow it comes over $37.00. The duck fried rice is $5.00 more at Pin Kaow. 
That is what I really like about the place, no matter how popular they get they don't raise their prices and that will keep us coming back over and over again.

Like several other Asian joints, the service is probably not what you'd expect. Once in a while, they'll forget to give you a napkin or have to go back to grab your utensils and there might even be some miscommunication, but the food is well worth it.
Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but I love their duck fried rice and pretty much any of the curries. The portions are generous and the food doesn't take very long either.

They have all the Thai classics and then some, with some nice duck and seafood dishes that aren't on the menu at other places. Their duck dishes are a bit too rich to eat alone, but are so satisfying at the right amounts. The seafood dishes are fresh and speak much to the quality of the fish. There's a bit of an issue with spiciness, though - this is one place that could stand to develop a better spice scale, especially since they excel in other flavor categories as well.

The servers here are friendly and very efficient. They seem happy, which makes the whole establishment seem happy, which makes even the busy nights just more bustling than hectic. Again, a solid, familiar place for just good Thai food.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,3,3,4,uA8ZUbuebjbPz5s6DzWRWA
4620637,2010-10-30,11,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"I'm becoming a Panang addict. I have to try it wherever I go. Tonight was no exception. After reading Anthony M's ROTD, I figured this would be a good place to take my Dad for a little birthday dinner with my brother.

Panang Avocado with Salmon. Doesn't that just sound awesome? Well it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was pretty good. Honestly, I still prefer Archi's Panang overall, but I love the fact that it comes with ample large chunks of salmon and avocado. It's kind of a perfect little marriage. You take some salmon and avocado in with your rice on each spoonful. The combination works swimmingly.

As it turns out, my Dad no longer eats spicy food. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for him. He ended up going with the Seafood Wonton soup. It looked delicious and had plenty of seafood. I like the uber-wide bowl they use to serve the soup. My brother went with the Yellow Curry with Tofu. I didn't ask him how it was, but he seemed to enjoy it.

As a side note, it was strange that the place was basically empty when we got there, but within minutes, the place was full. It's like after we sat down, a constant stream of customers just kept walking in until all the tables filled up. Also, I found the TV programming to be interesting.

We sat down, and without having to ask, water was served (always a PLUS). The prices on the menu are more than reasonable...I believe almost all of the items were under $10 -- and the menu is EXTENSIVE.

I ordered my favorite item, Papaya Salad (medium spice) & my bf ended up getting Kung Pao Shrimp. The papaya salad was AWESOME SAUCE. It was a rather spicy, probably more than medium spice, but it was delicious. The kung pao shrimp was very good too. I loved the black bean sauce.

The restaurant has been called the best Thai Restaurant in Vegas (not Lotus of Siam),  so there is pressure for this restaurant to deliver if its to carry the Thai Style Noodle House name and it does!

@ NH Style Potstickers - This was a delicious appetizer taking a book from the Japanese drizzling spicy mayo, eel sauce, and some hot sauce. Sprinkled on top is some sesame seeds, white onions, and green onions. The only issue with this item was the wonton wrap was fried a little bit too much so it was hard, not crispy. I told the waiter and the manager thanked me for it and gave me the item half off. Yay! Hopefully in the future they'll fix this issue. 

@ Seafood Wonton Soup w/ Rice Noodles - This place sure gets you your money worth. Filling the noodles with wontons, shrimp, fish balls, sea cucumber,  clams, and fish. The chicken broth is a clean tasting and delicious. A good fulfilling and delicious dish for $7.60.

This place opened this past week and looks like they're getting some foot traffic already.  The decor is nice, doesn't look like the hole in the wall Chinatown version. The fake granite tables, copper ceiling, and simple layout makes this an inviting place to come eat. 

Service is very friendly and attentive. When I explained to them my concerns for one of their appetizer, they were genuinely appreciative. This is a rare thing to find.

[CUISINE]
Khua Kai: My current favorite item on the menu. If you've never had it before its like a seared noodle dish with egg, served with a Thai sweet chili sauce. LOVE IT! 

Three Companion: The pork had a charred, barbecue flavor, it was a little chewy, but it's pork.

Panang Avocado Curry: This used to be my favorite menu item, (I've ordered this about 20 times) but sadly something has changed either with the quality of the Salmon or the preparation of it. I would not recommend ordering it. The salmon is consistently bad quality or dry tasting.  I asked and they said there was no change. Tried it three more times before finally giving up on it.

[DECOR]
I love the decor here. It's a very small cozy restaurant, there is this amazing faux tin ceiling which is my favorite thing about the decor here. I find myself looking up. I like that they pay Thai television here too. The walls have are half stone. Very beautiful in a casual environment.

Thai Style Noodle House was a real treat.  This location is a few suites down from Waffles Cafe on Fort Apache.  During one of my visits to Waffles Cafe, I saw that the staff was ordering Thai food; within 20 mins the food was delivered.  After some investigation I saw that Thai Style Noodle House had recently opened this location.

Later that week I stopped by for dinner and ordered a chef special, panang curry with avocado and salmon.  This was simply...awesome.  For my curry fix I've been going to Archi's...if only I found Thai Style sooner!  The avocado was a bit hard, but the flavor of the panang brought a smile to my face with each bite.  I ordered it at a 5 out of 10 on the hot scale, and it was what I expected.  After a second visit, they've been consistent with their scale through the four dishes that I've thus tried.

Since then I've had the papaya salad, red curry, and the pad see ew.  After adding some chili powder to the papaya for a little more kick, it became a great side dish to the entrees.  The red curry was good, but I enjoyed the panang a lot more (they were out of panang this night).  And the pad see ew was a very pleasant surprise!  I've had this dish before at other restaurants, and it came out oily and bland.  But here the noodles were cooked perfectly and mixed in with egg and beef, creating a lovely texture with the soft egg and noodles giving way to the thinly sliced beef.  

I've been expanding my tastes recently when it comes to Thai cuisine, and I can't wait for my next visit to Thai Style!",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,11,11,4,mwO9huJ5MlUXz_waD-DNgA

It is very unassuming, but inviting. I decided to have the Chicken Pad Thai and I asked for it to be  level spicy.

The meal arrived after about 10 minutes, which was not too long to wait for someone eating alone. The portion was large enough that I could have split it into two if I wanted, always a plus. The pad Thai? It was fantastic. The seasoning, combined with the heat was just an explosion in my mouth! Definitely brought a smile to my face. The waiter kept staring at me to see if I could actually take the heat and I did! Ate every bite. 
The only reason that I'm not giving the place a 5 star rating is because I thought there could be a bit more chicken, but the overall flavor more than made up for it. Oh and the meal was super affordable at $7.50.

4974790,2010-12-11,6,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"Thai Style Noodle House was worthy of two visits within a week - lunch specials are a great deal here so we couldn't resist returning!

From 10:30 am to 4 pm, lunch specials are in full swing.  (This applies on weekends too!)  

For $5.95, you choose one item from their list and you also get soup of the day, steamed rice, and choice of appetizer (fried tofu, egg roll, or fried wonton).  For only two dollars more ($7.95), you can make it a two item lunch special from their list.  That's a pretty good deal already!

Soup of the day (on both visits) were an egg drop soup that had chunks of goodies in it and fried garlic on top.  A nice start to lunch.  

First visit, the Husband had the two item lunch special - Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef and the Panang Chicken with the Fried Tofu appetizer, whereas I had the one item lunch special - Yellow Curry with Tofu with the Fried Wonton appetizer.  With the two item lunch special, we thought they would give him less of each, but it was actually two full regular lunch portions.  Definitely a great deal!  They even asked if I wanted soft or fried tofu for my entree choice.  My curry was loaded with lots of veggies - carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and baby corn.  All their entrees were good and tasty and we were both pleased with our choices.  

On our second visit, we both got the one item lunch - the Husband stayed with his Fried Garlic and Pepper Beef Choice with the Fried Wonton appetizer while I had the Panang with Tofu with Fried Eggroll appetizer.  They did get our spices mixed up on this visit though.  I requested medium while the Husband asked for spicy.  His has no spice while mine had all the heat.  It was still good nonetheless.

Be sure to ask for the Thai condiments - sometimes they automatically give it to you while other times you have to ask for it.

Their version of Thai iced tea is pretty good and a steal at $1.75.

Service is fine - both times we went was after the lunch rush so we were attended to as needed.

Overall, Thai Style Noodle House ranks up higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area offering lunch specials.

I come here for the affordable price point and good food. Though it isn't the best Thai food I've ever had, it's enough to satisfy any pesky cravings and in my humble opinion they have the best sticky rice and mango dessert. I'm a sucker for those things so I always order it no matter which Thai place I go to. It is not a complicated dessert and I've even made it myself a few times before but there's something about TSNH's version that makes it irresistibly good and so hard to stay away from. Another favorite is the Tom Kah Kai, it's a delicious soup with your choice of meat, it has mushrooms, lemon grass, tomato and has a coconut milk base. It's sooo good and depending on your heat tolerance they can customize the spiciness. It goes for most of their dishes like any other restaurant would. The pad thai is worth ordering as well. The kids really enjoyed their orange chicken and the hubby likes the fried rice with a side order of fried chicken. I have yet to try their curry but I'm confident I'll enjoy it like I do the rest of their offerings.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,3,1,4,PZ0FCM6WMQGp7AA1P0D1TA

As for my boyfriend's experience, well lets just saw that he wasn't as impressed as he was the past two times.

I ordered the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup. They bring the spice on the side so you can heat it as you please. The duck soup had a salty earthy flavor I added to small spoon fulls of the Thai spice in the bowl they gave me. That added the bit of heat I needed and wanted.

We sampled lunch, and for some reason, I wanted to sample something different, so I didn't go for my usual curry. I ordered up some stir fried broccoli. Yes, American broccoli. I love it, and I wanted it. The dish was very simple and fresh. The green goods in a light sauce, which was similar to a brown sauce you might get at a Chinese restaurant. Of course, they have brown rice, but they do charge a bit extra now (.75). 

One thing that I did discover on this trip was the assortment of Thai condiments in little glass jars on the table. I had never used them before, but I decided, ""Why the heck not?"" Good decision on my part, as I am a big fan of the jalapenos and will probably add them on to all of my future dishes at Thai Style. A couple of those on some brown rice and I could be pretty happy. Yes, I am officially a cheap date.

Of course, the thing to note is the beautiful, new interior, which is very different from the hole-in-the-wall style of the original. Each has its own charm. 

Service was great. We even saw some familiar faces from #1. From what I can tell, they are going to be able to maintain quality at both locations. There were a couple of bumps while they were getting in new chefs for both locations, but based on my recent visits, both spots seem to be on the right track for tastiness!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,11,4,gDx3TxyNgwC1jnJyMRCs9Q

Mine was delicious but on the spicy side for my English pallet. They gave me a free Thai iced tea to sooth my mouth which was not necessary but very thoughtful. My friend very much enjoyed her dish and that says a lot as a vegan curry connoisseur. We will be back! And I will ask for less hot haha!!,3wsvTzxgrbNY8kmv6Vo_TA,0,0,5,Jq6f_MAcGDWrw_HK9LGqzw
5520640,2010-09-15,4,Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA,"I was really pleased with our trip to this spot.  The restaurant was really cute, the service was exceptional, and the food was great.  
The Tom Kha was probably the best I've had in Vegas.  The flavor was spot on.  The Pad See Eu really stood out as well.  It ties for my favorite with The King and I (at The Lakes).  
I'm removing one star because the dish my boyfriend ordered (a flat noodle dish, with chicken, and Thai style gravy) was really gross.  I don't know if it just wasn't our thing...but this was something else.  The gravy was...abundant, and slimy.  I tried to give this a shot after refrigeration, when the gravy ""settled"", but it still looked very visually off-putting, and really didn't taste that great.  
Other than the one disappointing dish, our visit went great.  I'm sure we'll be back.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,7,6,4,yIJuo-bYlcEvzJZUVFXblQ

And on rainy days, its even better. If you're thinking its like beef pho, it is not. Its much more hearty and savory. I don't know anyone else tried it and disliked it. Its also called a ""boat noodle"". Yum.

The hubby always orders his favorite dish too. The chicken and shrimp silver noodle. Its so refreshing. Light but full of flavor too. I highly recommend this dish as well. 

Their prices are also extremely decent for their quality. No need to go to an expensive Thai restaurant when you can get it all here.

The tum yum soup was also above average. I would of liked it with some rice, I liked it but wasn't blown away. I'm a big fan of pad thai but was unimpressed with the dish here. It wasn't bad but I had better at random Thai restaurants. The duck fried rice was delicious and my favorite dish of the night. Definitely a must try.

The first star was lost because our first dish with sticky rice was way too small for the price.. you would probably have to order 10 of those to get full. It's the dish photographed. It tasted great, just very small for the price. The other minus was for the service, I don't think the server we had spoke a word of English. She just came and dropped off stuff. For example when she came with extra plates for me and my friend she just dumped them on the table paired instead of placing them on mine and his side.

Noodle soup with chicken and bean sprouts in chicken broth - 5 star. I got it with flat noodles. Spice level 7. Delicious!

Crispy pork and chinese broccoli- 3 star. The pork tasted a bit off, and it could have been crispier. I've had better, but wasn't too bad.

I ordered the Pad See Eww- it was delicious, Fried Pork with Chinese broccoli- never disappoints me, squid salad and somtum was not what I expected. I always ask for the squid salad to be less sweet and more on the sour side but they can't seem to make it sour enough. 

As for the Somtum I requested it to be made Lao style with 1 Thai pepper which would be enough spice for me and asked for it to be extra sour. Well it wasn't sour, and I think they skipped on the pepper or didn't use real Thai chili pepper/prik ki nou. It really makes a difference on the type of chili you use.

He chose to spend his spare time cleaning the fish tank. Using his hands. I should have taken a photo of the fish tank, its water brown & murky.
