Saw the huge sign, drove to the Location on Eastern/Sunset, got there 30 min before closing, two employees inside were cleaning up, store was closed. Went back the next day for lunch, got there at 10:30am: Closed, they open at 11am. We tried the Sub place next door. Went back two weeks later, that was on 3/4 yes, yesterday: Imagine how thrilled I was to be there, it was open!!! I placed my order, was tasting that Gyro, .... then.... They refuse to take the only cash I had on me, a $50 bill, the girl said the manager was adamant about taking my $50... she refused to take my cash, I was left dumbfounded... I asked if there was a manager on duty, which could help my thirst for their food, and give me some change, I was begging... Well, that didn't happen... I walked away, drove next door to Carl's Jr to get me a great Chicken Burger... and they took my $50 bill... Oh well, that only meant one thing: for me to stay away from Gyro Time!...

My favorite is the Grilled chicken sandwich, with grilled onions and an order of fries. Everything about the sandwich is great--the chicken (which there is plenty of) the pita (which always is fresh) and the cucumber sauce. Their fries are always crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, which is good considering these are not skinny fries. As for service, the owner always seems to hire high school kids, but he trains them to be polite, efficient, and accurate. They do a nice job.

-Their sauces are really flavorful. The tzatziki has a very fresh, tangy, and cooling taste to it. It's also thick, not runny like others. Their feta dressing for the salads is also really good - I'd recommend it for the salad. 

-Fast service, but nothing is of poor quality.

-The gyros come with lots of meat, fresh vegetables, and they are NOT greasy. It's refreshing to get a gyro that's not dripping in grease, especially at a quick service place like Gyro Time.

Salad - very fresh and crisp. 
Gyro time sandwich - mediocre at best. The Pita although the correct type it was not properly prepared. Meat was not that tasty. Not Greek style for sure.
Grilled chicken sandwich- no flavor same problem.

Cucumber sauce - it is supposed to be made from yogurt, cucumber, garlic and vinegar. This sauce was sour cream cucumber and some salt. Far from nom nom. It was fresh and edible.

1059412,2015-01-20,0,upxEHDxnEPwuts9xY0ylng,"A bit of background: my parents, the most venerable Papa Hawk and Mama Hawk, started going here when it first opened in '78.  When I returned from my military-and-college world tour in '81, they turned me on to the place.  I've never known it to attempt to claim ""authentic Greek-style Greek food,"" but it's always been good, wholesome grub.  Now, I admit that I was a big fan of the ""pocket gyro"" (the regular sandwich fixings stuffed inside a pita pocket), and I was a bit disappointed when they took that item off the menu, but yesterday's meal was still the same good food I remember for the last 30+ years.  The meat is good, the fries are excellent (somehow subtly different than regular old French fries), the cucumber sauce an excellent accompaniment to the sandwich itself (and not bad to dip the fries in, either), and the baklava was good, the last time I had it (I was diagnosed diabetic in 2000, so I've not been ordering that for a while).

Fancy?  No.  ""Authentic Greek""?  Probably not.  Tasty food at good value in a friendly atmosphere?  You bet.  The Great Bearded Bird will be back.

1837009,2014-02-26,1,upxEHDxnEPwuts9xY0ylng,"I saw the billboards and drove past this place, thinking surely a place with a drive thru did not warrant this much excitement. Like other reviewers, I too expected this place to be equivalent to McDonald's take on ""authentic Greek food"". Oh how wrong I was.

GYRO SLIDER- a baby gyro, complete with tomato and onion, and a cup of the famously delicious cucumber cream sauce. It's about five bites, the perfect size for a large snack, or just grab two for a meal. Meat is overflowing and tender, just the right light amount of veggies to add balance, all wrapped in warm pita. Yeah, I used the entire cup of cucumber sauce on this little thing. And loved it all.
SPANAKOPITA- about $4 and easily the largest piece of spanakopita I've ever had, even comparing it to more formal sit-down restaurants. Well-priced for good value, and on top of that, it's freaking delicious: light flaky phyllo dough, tons of creamy feta cheese and spinach stuffing, very indulgent. This could be a meal in itself.
BAKLAVA- at $2, the price is on par with others in the area for this dessert. But it's two or three times the size of the ""usual"" orders elsewhere, and it tastes homemade with an extra kick of some sort of seasoning/spice to make it unique, though I can't place my finger on what it is; allspice or clove. Oh, and it's proportionally accurate with a good amount of filling, rather than being mostly flaky dough, as I've had elsewhere.
GREEK SALAD- I don't like the way it's packaged and how it consists entirely of iceberg lettuce, but their feta dressing is probably my favorite salad dressing ever.

I regularly hit the drive thru here for a midday snack or to grab an easy and cheap dinner. Food is always fresh, prices are really good, quality is higher than any other place I've been with a drive-thru.

EDIT: Dropping my rating. They no longer offer the spinach pie and if you order a gyro slider, they are now served on crappy store-bought flatbread rather than the fresh mini-pitas they used to use. Service is still good, but I go here a lot less now that the quality has gone down.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,1,3,3BBv0-EsPQf3JZbn342niQ

The gyro meat is to die for! It's perfectly moist and thinly cut. The thin cuts are so good on the sand which, they fill the sand which to the brim with gyro meat- making it more than enough and also giving each bite a light and layered feel. 
The staff is SO kind and always are so respectful and tentative to any needs you may have. The service is quick, and the price is very reasonable. 
My go to is the classic Gyro Time Sandwich, with a large cherry Pepsi, costing me only 10.50. 
This also comes with a huge side of tzatziki sauce, and they also have sides of hot sauce for free if you ask for them with your meal. They have a drive thru for convenience and on the go, and also accept call in- pick up orders.

The food was hot and good! I got the regular gyro and it was very yummy. The pita was fresh and the meat nicely spiced. Although I ordered an extra sauce it wasn't necessary.
I also got a side order of fries which were very good! I am sure they would have been hotter if this hadn't been take out so i was very impressed.
I got a piece of baklava for dessert and this was the only fail. It had a greasy feel and didn't taste of butter but maybe margarine? I am also used to having more nut meat in the layers.

I remember getting cheeseburger gyros and thinking they were the best thing ever. Sadly the cheeseburger is long gone.  Then I left for college and made sure to hit gyro time every timer I made it home for holidays.   And now as an adult I make sure to stop in every now and then.

I now order the gyro with no onions, add feta cheese, and throw some hot sauce on it.  Delicious every time...

The guy who I think is the owner is in there  about half the time I'm there. He is a nice guy who is alway willing to have a conversation and seems to enjoy being there.... I have tried the Cheyenne location (way closer to my house) but it just isn't the same for some reason...   I am going to chalk that up to childhood memories.....

Now for the condiment debacle. Gyro Time would have gotten a full 5 stars, but they decide to use a ketchup brand that is not Heinz. People, I am tired of trying to get my point across!!! If it ain't Heinz, it ain't sh*t!!!!!!!!!!! How people can actually use other brands and then go to sleep at night with a clear conscious is beyond me.

Once inside, the layout and everything was pretty straightforward. Interior is nothing fancy, just plastic seats and tiled floors. Very fast-food-y, but there's nothing wrong with that. It was clean, and that counts.

The food itself was pretty good. I had the eponymous Gyro Time gyro, and it came with a side of a really tasty yogurt sauce. There was a good portion of meat and veg in the gyro itself, so even alone without fries or any other side, the meal was still filling. They offer a water cup for free.

The only con I really thought needed to be mentioned is that I would like the option to have lettuce on the gyro.

I love that the sauce automatically comes on the side for the sandwich and salad.

Baklava is okay 3.5/5 but what I like about it is that it's less sweet than other restaurants, great for those watching their sugar.
