We had a bad experience the 1st time we visited.  HOWEVER, the General Manager reached out to me after I posted a review on Yelp.com.  He had apologized and insisted we return.  We visited again, and had terrific service from one of the servers.  We were there on a busy Sunday morning; and expected to wait but, instead the host asked if we would like to sit at the the bar area.  The server was very friendly; we got food fairly quick considering it was busy.  They had plenty of servers available.  

The seasoned potatoes were really good.  I would order those again.  We will definitely come back to try other other items on the menu.  They have a variety of breakfast items.",4b4tZehvmY1rOfXYXxjNnw,1,1,5,dEFRtmIf17zKOxT6xuc_FQ

89521,2012-04-13,2,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"My husband ordered New York Steak and Egg and I ordered Prime Rib Bene. I heard about the Prime Rib Bene and wanna try it and that's the only item I wanted that night off the menu.

So the food came...... my husband found a hair on the steak when cutting it. He got grossed out and I got grossed out. I wanna throw up after seeing that hair though the hair wasn't on my plate. So I went out to grab the manager and told her about it. The manager felt bad and took away the steak and asked the kitchen to remake it for him. 

Then I am not sure if I was simply grossed out by that hair or my dish was really having problem. There were couple bites that felt very sandy on my mouth. At one point I couldn't tolerate the sandy feeling anymore so I told the manager about it. But I guess she was questioning in her head whether I was making it up after seeing her comping my husband's dish. She didn't look very nice when I was telling her about my concern of the sandy feeling. (I told her it was so grainy and asked if this dish was supposed to be like that, maybe I didn't state the problem clear enough making her wondering) But I really didn't make it up. Just too bad that the feeling was in my mouth, I couldn't really pick out anything that seemed sandy for her to see visually. But she did offer to remake it and at the end comped my dish too. (I hope they didn't spit on my food when they remake mine)

It was a mix feeling. I felt bad for her needing to comp our meals, but I really couldn't tolerate that sandy feeling in my mouth when chewing my food, and my husband definitely couldn't tolerate eating a steak that had someone's hair on it. So we felt bad for the trouble they had to go through but at the same time it's really not our fault. The situation was a bit uncomfortable so we probably just won't go back, because we would just be worried if we would find anything again in the food if we go back there, and worry about if it will end up in an uncomfortable situation again....so might as well not to go back then.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,2,Azm6hc61fzS2J59aOmOGPQ

256154,2012-08-21,0,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"Extremely disappointed in this location! We frequent the Flamingo location and have always been satisfied. We went on Tues afternoon and were seated immediately in the middle of the restaurant, this is significant because no one took our order for over 20 min, tho many people walked by us. With our egg flipped a bus boy finally came to see what we needed and then sent a server over. The server informed us that we were not in his station but he would help us. Our food came promptly after that. As we were finishing our meal the hostess went around to all the children giving them balloons, but of course skipped our 3 yo. He started pointing and saying balloon, the hostess heard him, looked at him and ignored him. So I got up with him to get a balloon, as she was about to get him one someone walked up to pay and she made us wait to take care of the man paying, then FINALLY got my son a balloon. Just unexcepatable service. We will never go back to this location! 

As a side note: I ordered the tostada salad without the meat or sour cream, so it is essentially $10.25 for iceberg, cheese and olives. I asked for ranch on the side and was charged .75. Just another irritation, as I would think they could consider ranch a substitute for the chicken it comes with.",cmUeX1LeMHJrtDf7Kgm7ew,0,0,2,caf5KhJz5KwhoMvML20F_w

I love love LOVEEEEEE their banana nut muffins. Every time I go, I always have to get it. I find a entree that comes with banana nut muffin so I can get some banana nut muffin. LOL! Their muffins are really moist which probably means A LOT of butter so if you're on a diet BEWARE. These little devils are delicious!!! I would say not to order the simple dishes. I was trying to eat a little healthier the other day.. so I went with a simple eggs, turkey sausage and asked for hash browns. I love hash browns so I was pretty disappointment in my meal this time. I got two hash browns with two eggs and two turkey sausage patties. First off, the hash browns looked like they were from McDonald's and I wasn't even sure if the turkey sausages were actually made out of turkey. I guess that's the risk you take when you go out to eat though. I expect more from Egg Works I guess you can say. Another sad thing is my friend thought the hash browns at McDonald's were better! Hahah which I thought was a little funny but in a way it made me hate my meal a little more. The work potatoes taste a little hollow too and you can tell they're from the freezer. Each mean is around $10-$15 I would say. If I actually got fresh food, I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for it (Just saying). 

They have a bunch of other great options but not for if you're trying to eat healthy and out with your friends. At least I haven't found any I guess. 

I love their stuffed french toast and their waffles with ham and eggs (drools). They have a bunch of other options as well on their cool newspaper menu. 

I say the customer service is amazing because one time we waited for I would say a little over 20 minutes. The waiter for our table gave our party each a free muffin - there were four people at my table. We were pretty happy campers. I mean.. a little after he gave us those muffins, we got our food. I even remember the manger getting me water all the time. I must say that water is really what I use to determine if a place has good customer service because I drink A LOT of water. 

The parking isn't too bad since you can usually go on the other side of 7-11 and park. It gets really packed over the weekend but during the week you can find a spot behind the restaurant.  Also if it is over the weekend expect to wait a good 20 minutes or so.",5RZ7l8EqNJEssIhiEOtARw,0,0,3,S3FJUitW3RBSyrYFFMF_5g

Their banana nut muffin to start your experience is awesome! Takes me back to a place when momma use to make banana bread. Oh right, the restaurant....could this be true? We were sited within 3 minutes of walking in on an early Saturday morning! What!!! When you walk in, you are taken back to maybe when you were a kid and your parents sent you to summer camps. It almost has a dining hall atmosphere with the exception of an arcade and tvs! 

Vettles - the potatoes are similar to the ones you find at Cracked Egg. Actually it's almost exactly like the Cracked Egg. Glad I live close to both of them! Their Greek Scramble was incredible, I don't mind that my tongue goes numb eating the spinach but the artichoke, chicken, feta make it that much better.

As a breakfast fan, I highly recommend this place. We had to test the service by flipping the egg to the yellow side and the staff attended to us pretty quickly.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0,0,4,EE0QOgtlsPlVSvGh_Hy5xw

The food is great (my favorite is the homemade corned beef hash and eggs), and the service is superb.  

The only thing that has been bothering me lately is that every time I go (for the last 2 years), the only music that is played is country.  I like some country music a lot, but much of it I find boring, repetitive and depressing, the same sounds, rhythms and melodies coming out of barely different mouths.  When I asked a manager if they could mix up the music I was told that upper management wants only country music playing at all their restaurants.  I find this pretty ridiculous. . . Even if I lived in Texas, I wouldn't want to hear only country music every time I went out to eat.  Life and eating out shouldn't be that monotonous.

I usually get the classic (eggs, potatoes, meat, side of bread/muffin), which I did once again on my most recent visit. I asked to substitute the bread/muffin for a pancake and was told that there would be a ""small upcharge."" Cool, I figured, imagining an extra $2-3 on my bill since hey, it's a couple pancakes, I'm getting them in lieu of the toast/muffin I'd already be paying for, and the upcharge would be ""small.""

I was charged the full amount for a short stack pancake meal ($6.10 approximately). The manager would not budge on this, and I never received toast or a muffin to take home. This ticked me off because I'd effectively paid the full price for The Classic, didn't receive 1/4th of the components of the meal, and paid additionally for what was regarded as a full second meal on my bill. 

I won't be coming back. The full cost of another meal item is not a ""small upcharge"" and I absolutely should have been warned by my server after she'd spoken to the manager and found out about the immutable billing for as bizarre a request as a substituted pancake. I would have opted for something different or simply asked for the toast or muffin that should have already been included with my meal had I been sufficiently warned.

TLDR; Visit Egg Works if you want mediocre-to-passable quality food, but don't you dare ask for a modification to your meal. What's that customer service thing again?",fp0SyfFB8EKsQ4Qie8Kt3A,1,0,1,JZTFSkYeqQQfDHfZIGB9nw

The restaurant was very roomy with plenty of flatscreens with different sports channels or the news on. The menu was pretty extensive and styled after a newspaper( very cute!) The problem with me and new places is I love to read menus and if you give me a large one..could be a while before you get my order( plus i start to panic somewhat with the overwhelming amount of choices) so i buckled under the pressure and just got a basic 2 eggs over with bacon and potatoes with the banana muffin. Love love love the muffin! Came out warm with slightly toasty edges with great banana flavor! So yum. Hubby got a breakfast skillet with ham, mushrooms and cheese with 2 eggs over easy. Eggs were done perfectly and he seemed to enjoy it and said he would order it again. My eggs were also cooked perfectly and bacon was yummy (when is bacon not yummy?) the big surprise was the potatoes..diced very small and crispy with some seasoning i couldn't place right away. Then my husband said it tasted like bbq potato chips! Bingo thats what they tasted like! So so good. The service was also awesome ..very attentive. They have a cute little egg sign u flip over if you need anything and someone is over at your table in like 5 seconds! Love that! A neat feature to this place is they have a small arcade in the back with 3 pinball machines and a few video games. They had Addams Family pinball which happened to be one of my husbands favorites!

Their breakfasts are dull and bland. The menu is extensive, but their kitchen lacks the talent to create any interesting or satisfying meals. Why no hash browns at breakfast?

Kat was our waitress and she was amazing. She was both friendly and to the point, never failing to make us smile or to fill up our almost empty cups even though she had so many other people she was helping! Never even had to flip to a sad egg, but it was so cute and silly I woulda loved to.

The gf went with one of her usual favs - the chicken enchilada omelet ( about $9.)  Instead of toast she opted for the banana muffin ( the star of the show - moist, dense, warm, nice flavor .)  The omelet was ....boring ( i think it's simply played out )  And the one issue we always have with the savory breakfasts - the seasoned potatoes - presumably diced potatoes thrown in the fryer then throw on some seasoned salt - no thanks !

A first for me - i bought into the menu BS that the burgers were the best in town- i went with the patty melt - simply put, it sucked.  Small over-cooked burger, the smallest piece of cheese i've ever seen on a burger and no FLAVOR.  note to self, if i ever eat at egg works again - pass on the burgers !

We do like the flavored creamers for the coffee .... that and the banana nut muffin are insufficient for a return visit.  The SW breakfast choice are limited !

They are really organized or the cooks are secretly Superman or have some sort of secret powers. 
 

The food was awesome as always! I had the California Crepe and it came with their special potatoes. I call it special because its the bomb. 

My husband had the corn beef. I think it's called hashed something. That was actually really good. It was perfectly seasoned. It came with your choice of scrambled or sunny side up eggs. Oh and special potatoes.

My son had the sliced bacon and avocado omelette (well that's what my son thought he ordered. he couldn't remember the name) and I know it was good because he demolished it within 5 minutes. Not to mention those servings are HUGE!!!

My daughter had the Mickey Mouse pancakes which came with a child size drink. Their buttermilk pancakes are also as good as everything else on the menu. 

Overall the good is A+ and to too it off the customer service is on point. They make it point to take care if their customers. Their was a nice lady that came by our table and asked us how everything was going. Told her that our server Mary was awesome. I like that they do that. It shows that they do care.

I thought being in the dining area was hectic but I thought wrong. Sitting right in front of where the servers get their food from the cooks was so stressful to watch. We sat down to absolute chaos.

There were no utensils and only one menu on the counter where we were sitting. As we shared and read the menu together, many servers kept returning the food because things were wrong on them. We couldn't help but watch them stress over the food they erroneously brought to their customers and now they have to return to the cooks to re-do them or fix them.

After 10 or so minutes of watching this, we were finally greeted by one of them. She get our orders and told us, ""It might take a while, as you can see behind me."" Yeah, no kidding. Food kept getting returned one after another. It wasn't too encouraging and I hoped our food would be delicious & not messed up.

The wait for the food wasn't too long even with how busy it was. We had to ask for utensils and for a few minutes, the server couldn't find any to give to us. How odd. 

That banana muffin was to die for! I ordered Chicken Fried Steak & it was delicious! The seasoned potatoes were so good, not salty. My eggs were cooked well. Unfortunately, my boyfriend got the short end of the stick. He ordered Loco Moco because his Hawaiian bum was craving it but it was a miss. The server asked how he'd like the burger steak and he said medium, which is his usual. The gravy was delicious but cutting into the meat was a disaster. The outside was cooked but the inside was simply uncooked, cold, mushy and pink goo. We've always ordered medium & this was definitely not medium.

1409760,2013-08-29,11,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"Two things I uphold above all in my reviews:

Customer service & food (quality, taste, veg options)

When I first walk in to order food to-go door girl or Naomi from what I spotted greets me with a scowl on her face and asks if I want a table. No, ordering out. can I have a menu please? she says ""Order at the counter"" ... Can-I-have-a-menu-PLEASE?
""Oh, u want a menu.... here. "" she hands me a stack. I put the overflow back. She's still scowling. 

Finally, I decide what I want and approach the counter/cooking area. Sunny takes my order with a cheerful smile on her face and was extremely helpful in putting together a combo option for what I was ordering and directing me that when I was ready I could pay and pick up my food at the front where I originally was. I thanked her and went back to pissy pants. 

Door girl doesn't even smile, says ""You ready to pay?""... then as I take a seat in the waiting area, I wasn't sure if Sunny knew where I was sitting but I noticed her maybe 10 minutes later with an order looking around. 

I ask door girl if my order is ready and she literally rolls her eyes and says ""She'll bring it over when it's ready lady""

..... (these dots represent the angered pause in my head)

Finally, a different waitress approaches me and asks what I ordered and subsequently brought me the order as Sunny was held up with another guest. 

As I leave, Sunny had run outside to find me still in my car and politely said ""You forgot your strawberries!"" I thanked her and the 3rd waitress for their polite and prompt customer service. 

Sunny should be appreciated or promoted to show her level of excellent customer interaction. it was very pleasant!

Naomi ""door girl"" should be fired. In a customer facing role as the first person that guests see and that first impression that is crucial for return business, she is seriously offering a lack of enthusiasm and disservice. 

I am a return guest because I do love the quality of food here, and this location is close to my home and the hours offered for late breakfast! but customer service is about 50/50 currently with her as the ""face"" of Egg Works.",B7_4IcWNdRq2VZozF34BZQ,18,14,4,Vyt1pVmh3ukZei1PkrP7lQ

The food is good diner food. The selections are grouped by section (omelets, non egg, griddle, etc.). If you need service you flip over a sign on your table and any of the staff will come over to help you.
There are several rooms to be seated in. There are tables with armless chairs and some 1/2 bench seating with armless chairs. When it's busy it would be difficult for a scooter to get around. You pay at the front counter. It is a very noisy place. There are several tv on but they are on mute with closed caption running. It seems all the tv are set to sports channels.

1449816,2014-08-11,2,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"I probably will only dine here again if a friend invited me to join them. 

I never stepped foot inside of the restaurant because I was meeting a small group of friends and they were already seated outside when I showed up. This has nothing to do with anything, but I really wish I hadn't worn jeans and worn my hair down without bringing something to tie my hair away from my neck...it was only 9am and I was sweating...but at least our kids could run and play without disturbing anyone because we were the only ones with the ""bright"" idea to sit outdoors. SO ANYWAY, I have no idea what the inside of the restaurant looks like...nope, didn't even use their restroom while I was there. 

Although I had a good time being there because I was with my friends and it's always a pleasure to be in good company, I'm not a fan of this place because I wasn't impressed with the food. The prices were pretty standard and the portion size was fair but the presentation was sloppy. I ordered 'The Classic': two eggs cooked how you want them, breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, toast or a banana nut muffin, I chose scrambled hard, turkey sausage and the muffin. My eggs were definitely scrambled hard...overcooked for everyone else, but for me it was fine...my potatoes were over salted and a bit dry, I was given turkey bacon instead of the sausage I asked for but I didn't ask to fix the order because I like turkey bacon but it was overcooked and my muffin was kind of strange looking but that didn't bother me. None of my food came out hot...or even kind of warm for that matter. Not much to boast about this place.",UEKG996TTiwonMpXwH-ixQ,2,2,2,ZdpJeAuS-1UjF046iL8TDw

1479655,2015-07-07,2,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"I'm not a huge breakfast food foodie, but Egg Works has the best chicken fried steak I have tasted to date. 

Yesterday was my second visit to an Egg Works establishment and my first visit to this location on south Rainbow. This restaurant was very busy at 1pm on Sunday - for breakfast. It was nice to be able to sleep in on a Sunday and still go out to breakfast during lunchtime. 

When I entered the restaurant, it was packed. The hostess, who looked and acted like she'd seen a full shift already, took our name and told us to wait five minutes. She managed to do/say all that without once looking at me. The thought occurred to me to turn and run, but Yelping has kind of made me stick things out for the sake of the review! Within five minutes, we were seated in the middle section of this open restaurant at the end of the row at a small table for two. Since I knew what I wanted, I didn't need to look through a menu. My son, however, took about five minutes to settle on which omelet he wanted. Our menus closed up to signal someone that we were ready to order. Nope, we waited for another five minutes as we watched servers race by us one by one. We even experienced some servers' toss their tray by their side and drench the floor and our feet with the water that had rested on their trays from beverages. I forewarned one server who was carrying several heavy plates as he passed over this puddle next to our table. This gentleman did clean the floor by my ankles after returning with empty hands. Still no server for us to take our order! 

Suddenly, Bridgette approached our table. She asked if someone had taken our beverage order. I told her ""No!"" so she took our beverage order and then told us she would let our server, Lisa, know that our table belonged to her. Upon bringing back out beverage order, there was still no sign, apology, or eye contact from Lisa. I actually watched Lisa maneuver around our table numerous times. So, Bridgette took our food order. I ordered the chicken fried steak and my son ordered the chili rellenos omelet. After this order was taken, I saw Bridgette patiently waiting for Lisa to finish an order as she held a ticket in her hand. I had a funny feeling that she was planning to give our ticket to Lisa. So, I motioned Bridgette over to our table. Upon confirmation of her intention, I told her she took our order and would remain our server or we would leave. End of story!

Bridgette was wonderful and the food was excellent. The restaurant was a zoo, however. I understand busy, but patrons also deserve to enjoy their meals. I found myself protecting my belongings (e.g., purse, iPhone) from possible water damage. Honestly, I felt like I was watching an Indy 500 race and betting on who would fall on the newly forming puddle of water collecting in front of my table again! There was also something rather unprofessional looking about the Egg Work apparel in general - tight jeans even on hostesses and management.  I continued to watch as staff cleared tables clanking dishes into bus tubs that were placed on chairs and hostesses that dropped menus at tables without so much as a ""enjoy your meal"" before turning and walking away. 

Somewhere towards the end of our meal, I noticed a sign explaining how to obtain service. Seriously, it was a sign that educated me on the yellow sad face or the black happy face. If I was unhappy and needed service I was to flip and reveal the egg shaped sad face attached as an ornament to my condiment tray. If I was happy or everything was fine, I was to have the black egg shaped happy face on top. Really? Can I take a minute to rant about service? Too bad, I am going to do it anyway! What is wrong with looking at people? Is it really that hard to see that your customer is aimlessly staring at you for assistance? Is it that hard to ask your customers how they are doing? Would it be too much for servers to prepare a table for the upcoming meal (e.g., ketchup, sugar, silverware, napkins)?  Is this why I couldn't get Lisa to notice my table? Good thing Bridgette used her brain and wasn't self reliant on a yellow/black symbol to denote my need for service. 

Come-on guys, this has to be done better. You have a good produce for a fair price but poor customer relation skills. I may visit another location and see if this is an Egg Works philosophical way of doing business or a single establishment problem.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,1,0,2,CO670MeW7DUuniitzrgIgg

  As soon as I  walk in we are greeted with a big smile and warm welcome. As soon as we are seated our server  came over to take our drink order. By the time she comes back we are ready to order!    

They have a Black and yellow egg sign on the table if the egg is black you are good if you need something flip the egg over to show the yellow side and they come over to your table... 

 Being from Hawaii I am partial to the Hawaiian food part of the menu. Like the island favorite or the local moco and don't forget the Hawaiian sweet  bread French toast... I always get the banana muffin as my side. ( or you can get toast) Don't forget to check in on yelp they give you a free banana muffin.

 The island favorite comes with sticky rice, eggs and a whole Portuguese's sausage and a slice of pineapple. The loco moco is pretty good not the best that I've had, the gravy could use some work. They always bring out the banana muffin first and they warm it up so grab some butter which is already on the table and go to work!!! Lol I really recommend getting this as your side choice!

 They have a front counter area with a tv which is nice, it was on sports center while I was there sometimes it's in the local news channel.

  This place is always clean and the servers are really friendly, fast service and good food... The menu is pretty extensive and long so check it out and see what excites your stomach....... Happy eating",n_Vzepb6aEwmPDtz-ISshA,4,3,4,2Um9btoGa1jo1D5YgCzO0w
1555761,2015-09-23,0,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"Our Waitress was great, she deserves 5 stars, but the food and the manager was just ok. 

I ordered the breakfast pizza. it was soggy dough and runny eggs. I have had breakfast pizzas at other places and there is a way to prepare it where it wont be runny eggs on top of almost uncooked soggy dough. I ended up just helping my sister finish her strawberry waffles and leaving the pizza with a few bites out of it. 

I wasn't planning on complaining about it, but when the waitress returned she asked why i wasn't eating my food and i told her why, she said ""oh there has got to be something we can do"". She went to the manager and this is where it got quite interesting. He came over to me with an attitude as if I was bothering him with a complaint. First off, I didn't even need him to come over, I was fine paying for the crappy food and just leaving. The waitress was just being nice enough to try to make sure her table was happy. Second, he then proceeded to explain that the food was prepared perfectly and that is how its supposed to be since it is eggs, I said ""runny?"" he said yes since there is a lot of moisture in eggs. Which we all know is quite untrue because a quiche is made of eggs and it is firm if cooked right. He said that there was nothing he could do and that I would have to pay for it since I ordered it and took a few bites from it.  The most hilarious part of it all, he asked if he could bring a box so i could take it home... WHAT THE? I didn't eat it here why would I eat it at home. No I don't want a box so i can take it home thank you. The waitress seemed shocked and embarrassed by his response, but at that point there was nothing she could do.

I really appreciate her service and her attentiveness. I probably wont ever go to Egg Works again just because that manager was so completely unaware of how eggs are supposed to be prepared.

Pros- Great comfort food with large portions, casual atmosphere that is great for the kids, typically you get friendly service from the staff, you can call ahead and order to go if you don't want to deal with the crowds.

Cons- It's usually busy and there's a wait. Also, the parking absolutely sucks. It's hard to find a spot....

For this visit, I ordered an egg salad salad sandwich. The bread was toasted to perfection and the egg salad was delicious. My daughters French Toast was wonderful as well as our groups other two orders. I love the fries here! They're really skinny fries loaded with salty seasoning!! YUM! 

My tip for this place is to just call ahead your order and get it to go. Then you don't have to deal with the crowds. :)",UGlYryF2DKbmBhTa7kq5WQ,2,2,4,N0pSIzQKU6d3sqX2z0IcRw

I usually get a skillet, which is eggs, meat, veggies, some cheese and fried potatoes. It's delicious. I have a friend who tried their pizza and declared it absolutely horrible. Surprise! It's called Egg Works, not Pizza Works. Don't come here expecting mastery of baked goods unless those goods are dedicated breakfast items. Since most of their dishes revolve around the same ingredients as my skillet combined in new and interesting ways, I feel safe in presuming that since my skillet is good all the other things will be relatively good as well.

My biggest complaint against this place is that when you ask for an egg over-medium, you're going to get over-hard. It boggles my mind that a place that specializes in EGGS can't properly cook an egg. C'est la vie.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,0,4,L4_uo-TN02PD2zB7PhuJww

I ordered the bacon and avocado omelette and it was pretty good.  But the most amazing thing ever about this place was their potatoes.  mmmmmm.  Real good stuff!

The owners clearly dont have an ounce of designer in them and basically massacred what should have been a warm inviting interior by painting the walls bright white and ruining the beamed tray ceiling by adding stark ceiling tiles and fluorescents everywhere. If you want an ounce of ambience with your dining experience skip this place. We had a two for one coupon which actually only had a value of $8 which was a buck or two less than the cost of their breakfasts offered so not really two for one. i got the country benny and my hubby got the chicken fried steak. He liked his real well, my eggs were runny and the whites undercooked even though i ordered them over medium. The works potatoes were a disappointment too as the name implies loaded goodness but the actual side was deemed "" the chicklet potatoes"" as they were tiny square hard fried dry potatoes covered in paprika and seasoning salt. The one bright thing was the waitress who was cheerful and quick. I would stick to mimis or cracked egg both around the corner.",nBenF2ly5Ig285-9u_1EXA,0,0,2,AqvxyAwDCV8sCeQuvtaKOg

The menu covers everything from pancakes to crepes to French toast to omelets to sandwiches to wraps to pizzas to etc.... Yeah in other words lots and lots of choices! 

Ambiance is a no frills kinda place. Totally laid back with condiments already at the table so that you don't really need to ask for anything once u make up your mind. Use the egg on the table. Black with a smiley face if u are happy to yellow with a frowny face if u need something.

I've been here I don't know how many times.... But the service that I have received has been very very good. Is it perfect? No.... But for the style of restaurant that this is... Pretty good. (4/5)

I've had omelets.... I have had salads.... I have had sandwiches.... I've had the pizzas.... And etc.... They have all been consistently good!

Will I be back... Of course.... Will I recommend... Of course. :)

Tip #1 - if u are a Tabasco fan like me.... Ask... They have it but only if u ask. :)

Yelp said ""average"" noise, but I thought it was louder than that.  

Also, I ordered a chicken-salad sandwich that tasted fine but was a challenge to eat as a sandwich. It was a full 4 inches thick when served, and as soon as I picked it up almost all of the chicken salad fell out of the sandwich. I ate it with a fork, and was left with a lettuce and tomato sandwich.  Maybe the chicken chunks (nearly 1"" squares) need to be cut smaller to make it more of a spread.

Breakfast is my favorite meal at
Egg Works because there loads of choices. I typically order a veggie omelette (no mushrooms) with bacon and toast, but I have had lunch here too.  

The decor is typical for a breakfast joint. I personally like the Egg people etchings in the glass panels inside of the restaurant. They crack me up (no pun intended)!

The location is good and the staff is great. The food comes out fast, tasty and hot. What more can you ask for? 

There's one thing this place doesn't have and that's ample parking on Sunday mornings. Other than that, I say go have a big fat breakfast at Egg Works!",ssOoXFDC4ObeQKF2TvHNCw,0,0,4,5c7rITLWKwh_DHsfTEev1w

I know, I know, silly that this is my first thought on this delectable dining establishment, but my guest and I turned to each other at the same time upon entering to comment simultaneously on how bright this joint is. 

Make no mistake about it, you will not have trouble reading the menu in here.

Moving right along, our famished selves were seated in a prompt fashion and our friendly waitress came to greet us moments after our post butt-in-seats maneuvers.  

Our beverage order was taken and filled with a quickness, heaven forbid we wait long for our pot-o-coffee.  My mouth and I were quite pleased with the fresh squeezed OJ, and though the coffee was nothing special at all, just the fact that it was caffeine made me happy at that moment.

A mushroom and Swiss omelet and veggie eggs Benedict order later, we enjoyed discussing the decor while our breakfast orders were prepared.  Farmland murals as far as the eyes could see; hey, it's hard to miss anything in that joint with the light as bright as they are. 

I also quite enjoyed their happy or sad faced egg option on the table. What the #$% am I talking about you say? Well, instead of doing that whole pesky walking by to ask if everything is OK you can flip your egg to a happy or sad face based on whether or not you need anything! My antisocial self enjoys that, in fact, I think clothing stores should implement this idea. The days of being asked a million times by every sales associate in the store, ""are you finding everything OK?"" would be over!

Back to Egg Works: the food.

My omelet was covered in cheese, in fact, I'm pretty certain there was more cheese on my omelet than egg. Have no fear, I merely peeled back the cheese layer and enjoyed my eggy/mushroomy omelet underneath. The breakfast potatoes were tasty, a little heavy on the seasoning but a great balance of crisp and softness.

All in all, is Egg Works the most mind-blowing breakfast experience I've ever had, not really. I enjoyed the Cracked Egg a little better, but should I find myself on the West Side of town and craving a tasty breakfast eatery, I would most certainly dine at Egg Works again.

Good eats, great service, those two things all by themselves are 4-stars alone these days!",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,3,3,4,Hua_1Wh-_Y4LBigkwL7-ig

Mainly because I don't eat eggs, or sweet stuff, so that crosses out a lot of breakfast type spots. BUT a friend was coming in town, and he wanted breakfast so after looking at the menu, we decided on this spot and I will be back for sure! 

Because we went later morning, mid week, we were able to grab a seat at the counter where Heather waited on us. She is super friendly, made some recommendations off of the massive menu and checked back on us enough to feel tended too, but not too much. As my friend and I had tons to catch up on and some times, there is such a thing as too much service. But Heather was perfect! 

Our food came up quickly, I had the carnitas crepe and my friend had an omelette. The carnitas were tender and flavorful. The only thing that was missing was that they weren't crispy which would have been a nice balance of textures since the rest of the crepe was soft. The Habla Diablo potatoes were yummy & I got extra fruit since I didn't want a muffin. 

My friend's omelette was perfect, he was really happy with his meal too. Coffee was always hot, we never felt rushed. All in all, I will be back!",acXrjeN3UIHtySWU46Z-Lg,0,1,5,LuCaaL9vEsrxqM6hI9x3YA

I ordered a chili skillet with eggs and cheese. Girlfriend got a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta bread. Most of the plates here have these seasoned breakfast potatoes which were amazing and full of flavor.

The wife and I have been coming to Egg Works for years. The Brad's scramble is usually my go to meal but today I tried the carrot cake French toast and the wife had an Eggs-ceptional fresh veggie omelette. The omelettes are prepared with four large eggs, sand come with Hablo Diablo seasoned potatoes and toast or the mouth watering divine banana nut muffin. The veggie omelette is made with diced onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, green bell peppers and fresh spinach, topped with cheddar and jack cheeses. 

Gotta love the cute egg decorations and the metal egg flipper on each table to let your server know if you are happy or need service.

Sprinkle some hot sauce on the omelette and a little ketchup for the potatoes and prepare yourself for meal you won't soon forget 5/5!

The carrot cake French toast was good but very dense, it was served with warm apple compote and maple syrup 3.5/5. Personally I prefer more fluffy French toast but I did see many people trying it. Will be back next time for an omelette for sure.

Enjoy the pics and give an omelette a try with the best seasoned fried potatoes ever!

We skimmed over the part where they say they SMOTHER the Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise Sauce. To them, SMOTHERING means that the English Muffin is a soggy mess instead of being a toasty contrast to the sauce and the eggs.

However HUGE TIP- give yourselves at least 20 min to read the ENORMOUS menu. To tell you the truth it is a little overwhelming. I'm not even an egg person but I love the selection and variety they have here: to start off- classic eggs served any style, 5 types of egg Benny's, tons of specials with eggs served with the whole bandit of muffins, toast, crossionts- along with the savory toppings and sides of cheese, grilled onions with a side a bacon, ham or sausage, or steak. 20 different types of omelettes with every topping you can think of including the works or the sun dance special- spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts, Swiss cheese? Topped with feta and fresh tomatoes.
And to keep going (just onto page 2)- 5 different kinds of scrambled, 9 skillet breakfasts, 6 crepes and even my favorite the Hawaiian breakfast section with 2 types of loco moco and the island favorite of spam or Portuguese sausage and eggs plus rice. On top of all of this I didn't even mention the totasta eggs along with the 20 different burritos (ok may not have been 20) but a lot of burritos with eggs included of course. And of course they have a no eggs section of pancakes, waffles, and French toast/ parfaits options; also soups, salads, wraps, and sandwiches and lastly chilli (Cincinnati style-not sure what that even means!) 
Also if u wanna get your drink on (I mean it is Vegas) they have vodka red bull, mimosa, greyhounds, screwdrivers, and classic vodka cranberry. As well as beers. Too bad they didn't offer an unlimited drink options! That would make this place amazing for brunch! 
This place is average on price; 10-13$ for breakfast/brunch. But from what it seems the portions are large!
Also I forgot to add they have a brick oven menu with an array of stombolis, brick over sandwiches and of course pizza. 
We ordered the corn beef hash with white toast and 2 scrambled eggs, the omelette chili reyenos, and enchilada burrito",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,2,2,4,GMx-txtq6rjI7Y4y4r8YZQ

This is my second time trying this place and the plates I've gotten are amazing. Eggs are cooked to perfection, food is cooked thoroughly, toast is perfectly crispy and their banana muffin if off the walls! 

This isn't an extremely big restaurant but I would say it is worth the wait (20 minutes or so?) staff was very nice and service was great!

Our waitress however, was fantastic.  All smiles and super helpful.  As others mentioned they have that little eggy thing that you can flip over for help, but I honestly forgot it was there because there was a constant stream of employees in the area always ready to grab whatever you needed.  And smiling, friendly employees, something I haven't seen in this city in years.

We both ordered the stuffed french toast which is really just a french toast sandwich.  It had scrambled eggs and cheese in the middle.  I got mine with the Works potatoes which were fantastic - just the right seasoning.  My friend got hers with fruit instead.  The food was served super quick also.

Corned beef hash, eggs, potatoes
Meat lovers omelete. 

The omelete lacked flavor, don't ask how that is possible but this place did it. My corned beef hash was very salty, it was made in house but they should probably revert back to the canned kind. 

They have buckwheat pancakes which can be gluten free, when I asked the waitress about it she had no idea. I didn't want to take a chance so I let it lie. 

Food came out quick and it was decent priced. I am sure if you have their hispanic oriented breakfast it may be better. They do have a large menu, lot's of options to choose from.",cxbNoom5vXFvQZKHKtE_Dg,0,0,3,Xvb5HREGwTSNJjga7bw66g

The service can be friendly or you can also end up with a snooty waitress that tells you they don't do the frowning egg anymore. Well, why do you put it on the table then?

2911728,2014-07-07,6,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"What an eggs-ceptional experience!! 

See what I did there?? Huh?? See that??

Everybody who knows me know I love breakfast foods and love eggs especially!  A coworker of mine kept telling me that I had to check this place out. ""You can't go wrong here, Mike."" "" You'll love it, Mike."" "" This has you name written all over it, Mike.""

Damn, they were so right!

Egg Works is located right next to a McDonald's on the east side of Rainbow just south of the 215 freeway. As we pull into the parking lot this morning, first thing we take note of is that it is crowded as hell! There were no spaces actually at Egg Works, so we actually had to park behind McDonald's. Good news is that speaks volumes as to their reputation. On the flip side, how long is it going to take to get seated and how long until we actually get to devour some grub! We parked and figured we'd give it a shot.

We literally did not have to wait at all! A couple entered right before us and no sooner did they enter the door, a hostess was escorting them to a table. Just as soon as they took off before us another hostess appeared and walked us to our table. Wow! That was seamless! 

Sitting at our table, we noticed the healthy portions of food at the other diners tables. This was starting to look promising! Our waitress appeared and took our drink order. We had our drinks within maybe 3 minutes of walking through the door! 

After giving us a few minutes to make a selection, our waitress took our order and was off again. We noticed this place had a ton of people taking to-go orders with them. This place is wildly popular and I can't believe I'm just discovering this now!

When our waitress returned with our food, she actually apologized for the wait! We just looked at each other and laughed since it was literally less than 10 minutes from the time we ordered. 

Wasn't exactly what to try first, but I love me a good cheese omelette, so I figured that was a safe bet. The cheese was so much tastier here than at some other breakfast places I frequent. The dish came with 4 slices of buttered toast and seasoned hash brown nuggets. Very tasty! My friend opted for the Denver omelette and raved about his, as well.

On our next visit(which is a foregone conclusion), we agreed to try one of those skillets. Those things looked powerful good!

I'm also digging the little system they have set up with the happy egg/sad egg. If you are pleased with everything and want to be left to enjoy your food, just keep the happy egg up. If you need something or need to speak to somebody, just flip it to the sad egg. We only used this once to get a drink refil, and it only took about 15 seconds for someone to take care of the issue. This was impressive considering how packed the place was at the time!

This place is freaking awesome and we will be back. A lot. And often. And again. And you get the point.

Spoiler Alert: Mike F. will be checking in to this place a lot!

Today our group waited about 15 minutes to be seated, it was a busy Sunday morning. Our selections ranged from country fried steak to pork chops, chili omelets and fresh waffles. I chose the strawberry cream cheese filled French toast. It was tasty, but SUPER sweet. If you want to crossover dessert into breakfast, this is for you. Overall though it was berry good (sorry- had to.) Though it was busy, the staff worked together and made sure nothing was missing during our entire meal. The friendly atmosphere and creative breakfast menu make it a great place for anyone to enjoy. 
The negative: it was really busy, and there was a rush to get people seated. That resulted in our table not being as clean as we would have preferred (there were used creamers and butter packets left at the table, and it could have used a wipe down. ) Other than that it was a good morning meal for my family.",n4w6b2DSdXlgOj9G0ZeytA,0,0,4,UCAuo5Yn-RZ7ypA4cjguEA

The waitress we had wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. I knew that egg and I had booze just didn't know how much, after asking I was only shown half the menu and didn't find out til after my meal they had butterscotch schnapps. I order the huevos rancheros and didn't get any salsa. It usually comes with it so I just used the kind that was on the table.. Also was never asked if I wanted a refill on my milk or if I wanted anything else to drink. My friend order the cheese omelet and was pretty satisfied, just should have all the reviews first.

Speaking of the breakfast burrito... SO GOOD! I subtracted bacon from mine and added avocado, and it was the best burrito I've ever had. The works potatoes that came with it were great too.

Both of our orders came wrong - My friend ordered the Traditional Benny - eggs were wrong and she never got the muffin she ordered to start breakfast - I ordered over easy eggs.....they arrived overly scrambled.  The sausage links were dry & overcooked and the blueberry compote I ordered with my waffle didn't arrive the first time and after ordering it a second time, it came out looking more like blueberry Elmer's glue.  The 'fresh' blueberries accompanying my waffle had a horrible bitter taste.  While our server was very nice and polite, she was scarce after our food was delivered so we didn't have any opportunity to remedy the poor state of our food.  I was able to swallow most of my scrambled egg and some sausage in order to take my medication as it needs to be taken with food.  The waffle was left untouched sans one bite.  We never saw our server again until she brought the check.  We paid $36 plus tip for 2 meals - when asked by the cashier how everything was, I politely told her about what was wrong with our breakfast.

We were sat right behind the bench when people wait to be seated. There is a wide opening in the wall there between the bench and our table. One customer who was waiting kept coughing without covering her mouth, right into my bf face. So we asked to move. We told the hostess and just waited a minute to find an open table. They didn't make a big deal about it and were nice about it.....except for our server. 

He wanted us to move to a table nearby but we waited on the hostess to tell us where to go since we didn't wanna mess up any seating arrangement with the other people waiting.  He seemed mad we moved and we even saw him talking to our new server Natalia about us and shaking his head. 

Look, no one likes some random stranger coughing near their face right before they eat. Either get a glass partitioner or some kind of divider at the wall or don't seat people there so close to people waiting. As for the server he should of had some kind of understanding why we moved.

The gravy is so flavorful and it goes perfect with the fluffy biscuits! I practically closed my eyes while biting into this. It was a very generous portion, I couldn't even finish it. I ordered it with the potatoes but the seasoning didn't really go well with the biscuits and gravy so I gave the rest to my boyfriend but the eggs and link sausages were perfect.

I also love that they gave a pot of coffee so that I could refill myself.

The variety and selection of breakfast dishes is extensive and printed on a Sunday New York Times sized menu.  My wife selected the chicken fried steak skillet...it was yummy and came with skillet potatoes, sliced chicken fried steak, your choice of eggs, and a delicious pork white gravy. 

 I opted for the blackened Prime Rib Skillet, which came with skillet potatoes, poached eggs, spinach on a croissant (I substituted english muffins), and smothered with hollandaise sauce.  I was however,  very disappointed with the prime rib as the meat was dried up and the size of bacon bits...certainly not like the slices of prime rib that I had envisioned.

Service was prompt however and I think we will be back to try other selections (I mean they had sooooo many breakfast selections that I am sure there are ones to please us both).  I may have to try the stuffed chili relleno, or the stuffed french toast next time.

I really hate to give 1 star. You know how BAD you have to be to get 1 star!! I don't throw 1 stars around at all. Let me explain. I SPECIFICALLY asked the waitress about the VEGGIE burger. I am a vegetarian. She told me if was really good, lots of customers order it. So, I did too. It comes to me and I take a bite and I start getting worried. The end is PINK, and I've NEVER EVER had a veggie burger PINK before. I am staring at it and I see red and green specks, so I ASSUME it's red and green peppers. I take another SMALL bite. It tastes like meat. I call waitress over and ask, is this the veggie burger?? She says yes. I said, I've never ever had a veggie burger that tasted so much like meat. She once again tells me, yes, it's a veggie burger. I am STARING at it. I can't eat it. Something is wrong and I know it. About 2 seconds later the manager comes over and says ""I'm sorry. We made a mistake. That is a TURKEY burger. The waitress got confused. Lots of people order veggie burgers but they mean turkey burgers"". I almost PUKED. I haven't eaten chicken or poultry in TWELVE years!!! It makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH. I would have rather them give me beef than turkey. The manager comped the whole meal and gave me a 50% off coupon to come back. YEAH FREAKIN RIGHT! They are lucky I dont sue them. I am NOT kidding when I say I suffered mental anguish. The thought of turkey in my mouth made me vomit. I puked several times that night. I went home and was SICK TO MY STOMACH. LITERALLY. It was the attic and the basement (I hope you know what I mean). This was truly traumatizing. I still shudder when I think about it. I will NEVER EVER recommend them. I have been told to sue them, and believe me I'VE CONSIDERED it. I was mouth r*ped by a turkey burger. (Sorry to be so graphic.) But it's true and how I feel. Please stay away from here. NEVER EVER go.

The restaurant is easy to access and find. It is near Rainbow and 215 across from Arroyo Crossing Shopping Center. The restaurant is a good size and we've never had to wait too long even on a Sunday morning. A huge plus in my book is they are very kid friendly! They provided a car seat sling at our table, and we didn't even have to request it.

Service has been consistent every time. We've had different servers and all of them have been friendly and efficient. When I order coffee, they leave a coffee pot at the table so I don't have to wait for refills. Their coffee is always fresh and tastes so good. I like they provide different flavors of creamer too.

I'm not a banana fan but I love, love, love their Banana Nut Muffin! It is so moist and the banana taste is not overpowering. I have tried several items on their menu and have been happy with my order most of the time. The last time I ordered the Prime Rib Benedict and the hollandaise had way too much lemon. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak Skillet and that was to die for! Their potatoes are seasoned very well. Their serving portions are generous.

3535494,2016-01-14,0,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"If you're into ginormous breakfasts, Eggworks is the place to go to. On first glance, the prices for the items on the menu may seem a little high, considering how the main ingredient of most dishes are eggs, but the portion sizes here are big enough for me to stay full until dinner time. That is well worth the money. 

The service was flawless. Each table has an egg sign that customers can flip over to be smiling contently or frowning in need of service, making for efficient communication between the customers and the servers. 

Another thing I appreciate in this place is how casually welcoming the atmosphere is. As someone who positively despises having to wake up early to get ready, I love how this is one of the places I can walk into wearing sweats and a t-shirt without being judged.

I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Omelet, which comes with potatoes and either a banana nut muffin or a piece of toast. The muffin came out almost immediately after I placed the order. Although it wasn't warm anymore, it was still fluffy and delicious, which is all that counts. The tables are stocked with anything that one could need for breakfast: jam, ketchup, sugar, salt, and pepper packets are all readily available. My omelet did not take longer than ten minutes to arrive and was the most fulfilling breakfast I have had in a while. There was plenty of chicken in the omelet, and the sour cream added a nice touch to it.

Customers pay the bill right at the cash register, where a friendly cashier quickly cashes them out and wishes them a nice day. Definitely an egg-celent place to start the day out with!",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,1,0,5,fdcsu0IP1rsSJXnVFynGug

I ordered coffee and needed the spoon to stir in the cream. I didn't have anywhere to set my wet spoon, nor the fork and knife except on the bare surface of the bar. I don't like doing this because of germs and what not. The bar was wiped down with a rag, but how clean is that rag? I don't set my silverware on a surface like that. So now I have to do a little balancing act by propping the fork and spoon on the edge of my knife. I could have set it on the napkin, but I don't feel okay with that either considering that I will be wiping my lips with it. A place-mat solves the issue. They could charge local businesses money for advertising space on the place-mat. It wouldn't cost them anything. #2 - The breakfast potatoes are not cooked to order. In fact, them come frozen. They aren't dicing any potatoes in that kitchen. They come straight out of a plastic bag and right into a fryer. They might even be pre-seasoned. These potatoes are kind of like little fried children's snacks. A traditional, diced, breakfast potato with onion and peppers would be much better. These little frozen potato nuggets are not good.

The food - On the first visit I tried the Cincy Chili.  It just wasn't good.  On this visit, I went with eggs, biscuits, and gravy.  It wasn't good either.  You can't really screw up eggs, but the gravy and biscuits had all the thrill of cardboard.   To my server's credit, he noticed I wasn't eating much and did offer to replace it with something else, but I didn't have time as I had an appointment.  My dining companions got the egg skillets and also commented that they felt it was just average food.",TFfFBvt2GM7uj3LmLie_7w,0,0,2,edZNGUjC_eQFWQmlt3qygQ

I understand that I am pretty understanding when it comes to service since I am in the industry...

BUT...
That doesn't change the fact that Egg Works is great. They impressed me in my grumpiest state...which is in the mornings ...when I have to wake up and start my day ...*sighs* 

I've ordered pretty much something from every part of their menu over the years but my favorite has to be their eggs benedict...SO DELICIOUS...they serve their seasoned racheros potatoes with most of their dishes which is another highlight of the place.

All of their omelets are amazing but beware...their portions are HUGE. Which is probably the only reason I don't order an omelet every time I come. They will also do all egg white omelets upon request for a few dollars extra. 

A MUST HAVE...
Do not skip out on their banana nut muffins...I don't care if you're on a diet or you just don't like muffins...you HAVE TO get one...They are served warm,fresh, and delicious.

Egg Works is just adorable. The layout of the restaurant is great and the atmosphere is family oriented and kid friendly. One of my favorite parts is their egg sign on every table to notify servers that they need service. One side is an egg with a happy face if you are doing great and the other side is a sad face if you need something.",4zGUfXRDgbLktXsYf0sHjQ,3,1,5,He6kJMeLdKQEaQoT-xp2uA

I had Michelada and the Haolo Moco. I my go to brunch dish is the Loco Moco, first time here and so I am open to try anything new. It's basically country (white) gravy.

No additional order needed. Total with tip came out to $18-nod bad for the size brunch.

Marianne was my server and I must say she had the most friendliest vibe about her and so upbeat!  She was so nice and make sure I was taken care of.  She knew it was my birthday and gave me a complimentary warm banana nut muffin!  It was sooooo good!

I've been here and waited an obscene amount of time, and I've been here and seated right away. The menu isn't impressive. I swear it takes me longer to decide on what to eat than it does for them to prepare it. I've tried the Eggs Benedict and don't think anything of them.

I was craving banana walnut pancakes one time and I asked if they could make them, so I receive my pancakes with bananas and walnuts on top off the pancakes. What the heck?

Here's what we hate: The location stinks for parking (remember to bring your walking shoes!). The stupid black/yellow egg thing is a cop-out excuse for lazy servers (flip it if you need anything - Here's my first 'why are we tipping you?'). If you like more than one drink, forget about ever getting that refill. It ain't comin. Actually, when you order a diet coke, expect that not to come either (""oops, I forgot"" - Seriously breakfast ain't that hard, honey). You might as well forget your food too. Your dining partner may get theirs, but you'll have to wait 10 more minutes for yours without any type of acknowledgement; I suspect its normal because of the lack of reaction. The hostess' 2 out of our 4 visits acted as server assistants. The other 2, other servers brought our food. (Why are we tipping you, our server, when everyone else does your work?).  The cash register and hostess stand situation can make even the most non-claustrophobic person want to scream out 'stop touching me!' Crowded is an understatement.

The last time we were in the server ignored us the entire meal, never said a word to us (with the exception of 'what can I get for you?' to take our order), but as she dropped the check tried to start some half-hearted dialogue about 'our plans for the rest of the day' (woman, I don't know you.

Thus, the building is brick on the outside and looks much different than the other locations. 

That being said, the food is delicious and consistent with other locations. I always order the Sausage patty, egg, crack potatoes and toast or banana muffin (depends on how I feel that day).

The ciabatta bread was good and came nice and warm. It was moist with a bit of a chew and slight crust. The two fried eggs, like I said, were under cooked for my taste and under seasoned as well. I added some black pepper, but I only ate one half because I could not get over the runny yolk. The bacon was pretty good. It had good flavor and was well cooked. I took it out of the second half of the sandwich I did not eat and ate it. You can choose bacon, turkey bacon, or sausage for the sandwich. In addition to under cooked yolk, the sandwich was very basic and needed something to spruce it up, perhaps a sauce or sliced avocados would suffice.

The potatoes were little rectangular prism and were fried well to a golden brown. They were seasoned well enough and with a red pepper spice here and there. The tasted pretty good. Service was good and quite friendly and enthusiastic.",WG3w_73scm_JUWJ_3Lgn0Q,10,10,3,p6E-7ckJzMW-6vjOZDNBKQ

2 stars = wait staff.  They are always accomodating even for large groups.  They are always super friendly, courteous, and quick to answer to your egg of problems once you change your egg sign from happy to sad on your table.  It amazes me how they see it so quickly.

3 stars = food.  They have a wide selection of breakfast and brunch items.  A couple of my favorites are the California Crepe, the Chicken Fried Steak, and the entire Aloha menu; especially the sausage.  Yum!  I always have a good experience for breakfast here and always leave fulfilled.

4 stars = for their hazelnut coffee and banana nut muffin; when paired together with butter of course, it's breakfast in heaven.  Sometimes I get full from just this muffin.  An entree to share w/ a friend would suffice if you have this to start.

5 stars = because they have a new schedule and are open past 3pm to serve brunch all day to 8pm! Yaye!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,2,0,5,9aA50Q1KfJJrojGL6X-9mQ

I can't say how great this place was and how impressed we were with the service.

Our server, Amy, was enthusiastic, on top of things for our party of four and was great at recommending options.

Typically at places like this that serve cafe style breakfast I usually get a basic breakfast burrito, but in this instance Amy recommended the Santa Cruz Burrito.  The burrito had eggs, chicken, chorizo, cheese, green chile and was topped with a homemade ""Santa Cruz sauce"" which Amy described as a ""eggs Benedict style sauce with a Spanish twist"" and that's exactly what it was.

The burrito was sided with a bit of sour cream as well as potatoes and I finished every bite and was not disappointed at all. In fact, this was one of the best burritos I have had for breakfast and that's saying a lot considering I was previously a thirty year Southern California resident.  

Their prices are more than fair here, and another great touch is they have these little hanging wooden eggs on the table, one with a smiley face and one with a sad face. If you need service, flip the egg to the sad face and one of the staff will come over, basically eliminating the long waits for a server to bring you something that typically plagues most restaurants.

On a final note, we decided to stop by and see manager Maggie before leaving to let her know what a fantastic and above the norm job Amy did, and she was very pleasant and glad to hear about her workers great job.

Sometimes, that's just what you need.  There's something refreshing about a non-hipster breakfast joint that is not trying too hard.  From the country chic decor to the consistently good breakfast food and strong coffee, this place earns a regular spot in my breakfast rotation.  

I've had a number of good dishes, but my go to is the South of the Border skillet, half size, because the regular portion is humongous.  It's off menu but worth the hassle of asking for it, because it's just that good.  Chicken, potatoes, jalapenos, onions, green peppers cooked together and topped with tons of cheese and an egg any style.

4074400,2017-09-27,1,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"An old buddy of mine was in town and wanted to meet for breakfast so I suggested Egg Works. It's close to my house yet I've never dined there and it was about time. It's now become one of my favorite places to go if I'm with someone who wants an early morning meal.

I don't usually eat breakfast and I don't even like any breakfast items (I hate eggs, pancakes, etc.), and that's why I never go to a breakfast place. I was dreading my meal and I figured I was going to be resigned to sipping on a coffee and watching while he ate. Imagine my surprise and how thrilled I was to find that Egg Works also has lunch / brunch food on their menu! It's not just a sea of pancakes and omelettes! 

As you'd expect, there are a TON of egg dishes. You can get eggs just about any way you can imagine. If you're a fan of eggs, you will adore this place. Ditto for other breakfast items like french toast, hash browns, and more. I was tickled to find a large section of non-breakfast items that didn't just seem like an afterthought. They have a great selection of salads, sandwiches, burgers and chili. 

My friend ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it was huge, fluffy, fresh and delicious. I got a bowl of their supposedly ""famous"" Cincinnati chili. I'm a big chili fan and theirs is good but not great. They cheerfully loaded it with shredded cheese for me and as we all know, cheese makes everything better!

They have great beverages too, including alcoholic options, soda (Coke products), freshly squeezed juices, fancy coffees, and plain old watery American coffee. Service was super fast and efficient, and the atmosphere relaxing. 

This is the perfect spot if you're looking for a hearty breakfast and you have non-breakfast eaters in tow. I'll be back!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,4,3,4,vxWUxv-vQ2J_cQ_fCHWSog

We showed up an hr before close and our waitress forgot to put in our food order. We were pretty upset and on a time crunch but couldn't do anything about it. We flipped the unhappy face on the table and made it known that we were not happy. 

Marc, came to us to ask if things were ok.. so we told him our issue. He was very sorry, comped our whole meal, had the waitress come by to give us a genuine apology and also gave us muffins while we waited for our food. The food came after 5-7 min and he always surprised us with a carrot cake that was wrapped all pretty in a blue shear wrap.

My reaction was, ""wow!"" I've never had a person redeem themselves and represented the the quality of this restaurant as much as he did. I was floored by how he handled the situation. He smiled the whole time and was a true professional. 

We left a fat tip for the waitress and appreciated the the special treatment. We love Egg works always enjoyed our time at this location. We have been known to stop going to diners because of bad service and such. 

Egg Works kept my business and I wanted to share my great experience with others just to show that even in this busy diner, you can still get 5 star service and smiles from all the staff.. 

Thank you Marc for your amazing super service! Because you made a difference. People like you bring success to any service driven industry. If we owned that type of business, we'd have to steal you away from Egg Works.. You are a true asset to the company and i hope they know how lucky they are to have you!

I got the crazy chicken and my husband got the Brad's scramble. If you are a coffee seinker they offer flavor creamer BTW.

The crazy chicken at this location is more cheesy than the other locations. Mine was loaded with cheese and even had cheese falling odd the omelette. What I also noticed was they put probably half an advocado in there. I'm not complaining because it was so good.  They do offer an egf white version for an extra $0.95.  Note' the omelette is huge. Definitely a shareable dish. The crazy chicken has adovcado, cheese, chicken, and mushrooms and a dap of sour cream. Take each bite with sour cream and it'll taste even better than ketchup.

My husband got the Brad's scramble. He stated that it was also too cheesy. Although he took off most of the cheese he really liked it. The brans scramble has no meat. Very vegetarian friendly. 

Both dishses came with a side of potatoes and banana bread. Get the BANANA bread. And eat it with their soft butter. If you had to get one thing, just get the banana bread. If you check in, you'll get a free one. The potatoes has its own seasoning. It kinda taste like seasoning salt bit better. If you like it, they also sell it. 

This location is located next to a McDonald's and a large shopping cennter. Good luck trying to find parking in front or on side of the restaurant. The complex connected to it has plenty of parking and it's a short walk.

There's a bit more room to breathe in this location -- people aren't bumping their asses into you while you're trying to eat your bacon and the staff is ultra friendly and FAST!

We went this past Saturday, ordering an omelette and a classic breakfast. Before we even finished checking in online, our meals were in front of us -- almost TOO fast, actually. I hardly had time to enjoy my coffee. But we couldn't blame them for being efficient. 

We usually end up taking half of our breakfast home and making breakfast tacos for dinner with the leftovers, so it's a great deal at roughly $24 (considering we get two meals out of it). 

I do take issue with the frozen cubed season-salt ""homestyle"" potatoes they server (just like Egg & I). I wish they would make fresh hashbrowns. 

The parking can be a little tricky, but there's plenty of places to park if you're willing to walk more than 10 feet.  This is part of the regular rotation of breakfast joints now, for sure.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,1,1,4,tVdS6mW0-ChxTv41V2LGDg

I was pleasantly surprised to see they are the only Egg Works who are open for dinner. Their pizza is quite tasty. Yes, the bright fluorescent lighting is a little harsh any time of day - BUT - if you sit in the room to the right when you first walk in (has a fake fireplace) the lighting is dimmer and more homey.

Ordered a corona from the busser.  We had no menus yet, so I asked how much it would be. He said $3.50. Menu said $4.50. 

Ordered the cabo breakfast burrito and the eggs benedict pizza.  Both were barely edible. 

The chorizo in the burrito was so overcooked that is was like ground beef left out overnight and tasted nothing like chorizo, salsa was out of a jar or can, there was maybe a tablespoon of sour cream on top, eggs were wet and rubbery, tortilla was old and the red sauce on top was like the stuff you get with the dollar frozen enchilada meals at the grocery store.  $10

Pizza dough was not cooked through before the hollandaise sauce was put on so it was wet and rubbery. The sauce was lacking flavor and too salty. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Should have ordered three eggs. $13

Breakfast potatoes were cubed and rolled in seasoned salt. More dry than crispy.  NO HASH BROWNS!  They did however have those potato pucks that McDonalds serves.

Breakfast is our favorite meal and we often cook it ourselves at home, but when we are feeling a bit lazy, we hit up some breakfast spots.  We have only gone to one other egg works and this one is definitely busy.  So if you have a big party, expect to wait awhile.  Luckily, turnaround is rather quick.  

I usually like to get some type of Benedict, but on this trip I got the Works crepe.  I ordered the full order, as opposed to half order which is 2 eggs, because I needed my protein that morning.  It wasn't what I expected, however, since it was different, I could see myself ordering it again.  A comparison, its served omelette style, you just get your ""eggs"" served differently.  

One thing that never fails is the banana nut bread, its yummy and compliments your overflowing protein.  One thing I have noticed is that a lot of their menu items are pretty much the same thing served either separate, on a hot plate, or everything is cooked together.  

Their country fried steak is cut, not served as a whole piece, and so is their prime rib too.  That unfortunately is disappointing.

No surprise I got the loco moco here. But this time it was topped with country gravy. SO GOOD. They also had chili loco moco, but will have to try that another time. The gravy was thick and satisfying. My egg was a little overcooked (I asked for over medium, it got kind of well done). But the flavor and silky texture of the gravy over the rice.. heaven. It's like biscuits and gravy - but better!

The other dish we got was the chicken fried steak skillet. Unfortunately, it was a salt bomb. The chicken fried steak itself was tasty and fried nicely while still being juicy. However, those diablo potatoes were way too salty. Could have just been an accidental over-salting - but it was almost inedible. 

I'm giving 4 stars though because my loco moco was on point, -1 for the extremely salty potatoes. Their banana nut muffin, however deserves 5 stars. It was warm, crispy edges, right amount of banana without being overwhelmed in the nut department. So weighing all of that together - solid 4/5.

My favorite dish on the menu comes from their small Hawaiian menu: Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. They also have perfectly made loco moco as well as the haole loco moco. My second favorite would be the Spinach Benny (eggs benedict, served with spinach plus hash browns, which is also very tasty). They have a variety of dishes: omelets, waffles, toast, scrambled eggs, crepes, parfaits... and that's just from their breakfast menu!

Overall, I give this place 5 stars, based on their menu, their staff, and their location.",0nDeoyxAaWHcihihxiIa3A,2,1,5,isMT3jypsp9-Nm-3x_bdBA

I tried to get the cashiers attention and let her know how it was a great meal, but she did not acknowledge, she was a heavyset brunette with glasses.  I then asked if they had the local fire firefighter discount as my father was a fire chief, she smirked and said only while on duty, quite sarcastically.

She remained patient and friendly. 
Overall food is okay nothing worth raging about had the Classic, the mouse pancake, the kids pizza, and the banana French toast. The kids pizza would probably feed 2 6 year olds and is a really good size for what you get. Good food is you aren't looking for any frills or surprises. 
Hostess left more to be desired as I asked for a both and she ignored me the first time and when I repeated my self she pushed together a dirty table and a clean one. 
Best part of the experience was Twila noticing our daughter was sucking on a piece of cantaloupe and noticed she was tearing it to pieces and brought us another one. Even though she forgot to bring the toast we asked for id give her a solid 4 stars good service attentive and patient everything I want in a server, also she did not charge us extra as many servers would to go half and half on fruit and potatoes on the classic which was definitely appreciated and will be reflected in her tip.

My friend ordered the Stuffed French Toast, which is basically a sandwich made out of two pieces of french toast and stuffed with fluffy scrambled eggs, also a side of the works potatoes.

If you ever need anything from your server, the easiest way to get their attention is to flip over the egg on the table.

It seemed to be an unusually Wednesday by the looks of the parking lot but less than half of the restaurant was full. When greeted at the door it was more of an afterthought by the three hostess standing there.  I had to repeat twice that it was a table for one bc they were too busy talking to each other. I knew what I wanted when I came in (banana French toast) and found it on the menu and flipped my egg to yellow that I was ready for service.  The first girl came over and asked if she could help. I told her I was ready to order. She said she could take me drink order and disappeared to get me a hot tea. Two more gentlemen came over to ask if they could help me. Again I repeated I was ready to order. They said she was coming. The tea girl meanwhile brings back my tea and flips my egg back to black. I flip it back to yellow bc I STILL need to order. The waitress finally comes over to take my order. No apology that sge was busy or anything. I give her my order and she flips my egg back to black so hard the table shakes. Very disappointed.

It took an hour for us to receive our food (one of the worst feelings in the world is watching people who were sat well after you, receive their food first). They had apparently ""lost"" our ticket in the window. They did pay for our drinks (one mimosa and two orange juices), but overall, we were tired and not looking to wait around an hour for sub par food. Two stars for our server who was a nice guy and tried to make the situation tolerable.

4891701,2014-11-25,1,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"Wow! I'm so impressed! The food is great...but more impressed by our most awesome server Raul! :) 

Let's start off first by saying that the wait for a table wasn't bad at all for a Sunday morning Brunch. About 15 minutes. We wanted to try something not so Denny's or IHOP....we actually were on our way to The Cracked Egg but ended up here by accident...a pure mistaken identity for the other egg place (???...don't ask I just told him to turn in here...) It gets crowded and kind of cold in that little waiting area just inside the doorway but they do seat you as promptly as possible. LOOK and READ all of the specials they have on the chalkboard at the entrance before you go in! They have a pretty good spread for an egg restaurant lol! 

The ambience is a very cozy warm family friendly atmosphere. We sat down and was a little unsure of the menu...as we had no idea it was a menu at first glance...Lots of reading...so bring your reading glasses!...The Awesome Raul took our order...He was kind enough to run back to the front to tell me exactly what the firecracker(somethin...somethin...) was. I don't remember what it's called...but it's pretty much chili cheese breakfast nachos with potatoes on the side and choice of toast or muffin...yummy! 

The food came out and was all delicious and well worth the dollar amount...Raul was very attentive to all the patrons he served and what impressed us so much was his genuinity...he shows he cares about every patrons experience and doesn't stress under pressure. He is definitely management material! Hubs and I rave about this restaurant mostly because of the service and not just from Raul but from all the servers there as well! His name is the only one that stuck because we interacted with him most. 
So here is the score:
Restaurant cleanliness - Four Star

Menu - Four.Five Star (lots of reading little time before ordering lol)

Service - Five Star

Food - Five Star

Parking - Three Star (lot is kinda small)

Total score:...Five Star (yes my math is wrong...but it's soooooo right) 

Would I come back again...absolutely!
Would I refer to a friend...HYFR!
Would I go back to Denny's?...only if I'm not in Las Vegas and craving breakfast.",_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ,3,2,5,8218WzEfBn2KUzuBWNN5hw

Portions are filling, but not ridiculously overdone. If you order fruit as a side, you get actual large slices of a mixed variety of fruits. The banana nut muffins are good as homemade. (I won't say ""better than"", because I make great muffins.)

I've ordered the eggs and pancake combination, and the Eggs Benedict today. Both very good, although surprisingly, I liked the platter better. 

Service is both efficient and friendly. The wait staff acts like they enjoy their jobs, and their customers. Nice to get smiles and helpfulness!

i wanted 2 eggs over medium, toast, and potatoes, bc their taters are just so darn good.  i also wanted one chocolate chip pancake.  when i placed my order with our waitress she told me to get some combo that is the same thing but comes with a meat and 2 pancakes. that it would end up being cheaper. i dont really eat breakfast meat but my brother in law said he would eat it. so i got it. when my food came, my eggs werent cooked right. and, AND, there were no taters with my meal. which is pretty much the best part of their breakfast.  i didnt complain bc i was hungry and didnt want to wait, so i ate some of it but really just ate the pancakes.  the pancakes were good. overall i ended up spending $15 for 2 pancakes. i most likely should have complained.
i would go back to this location just bc it is the most convenient. but i'll watch out for the waitress, and send my food back if it isnt done right. and until i go back they are keeping the 2 stars.

So i decided to have breakfast here with a friend of mine on the rainbow location.
Location is great located near the 215 kinda far from me but a perfect meeting point for people that live on opposite sides of town.

The place looks great everything is clean that's what i normally look for before i enter an establishment. Place smells great, smells like breakfast, a great aroma.

The place is a little bit loud but, you are still able to hold a conversation with your party without screaming your lungs out.

I normally have the eggs benedict but decided to try something different. the Loco Moco. To be honest i was a bit disappointed. For the price i paid for the Local breakfast plate which included spam and eggs the serving was small. The plate cost me around $9+ and i was seriously disappointed! Well at least i know now not to order that plate, I hope someone from that restaurant reads this and makes changes to their Hawaiian plates. 

If someone from hawaii ordered that dish they will be starving after eat it.

Overall the service was great., The staff knew when our table needed attention, because they have those EGG markers , which indicate if we needed something. They were on top of that.

I still give this place a 4 star because aside from their terrible hawaiian local plate dish their other dish the eggs benedict was the bomb! and their racheros potato is really good too.

This is by far one of my favorite breakfast places and i still highly recommend this place if you are craving a good breakfast!

I have bookmarked this place for quite some time now, but being that I'm not a big breakfast person it has taken me a while to cross it off. Last Saturday was the day we finally decided to check it out. I was still apprehensive thinking that we most likely would have a long wait as this place appeals to locals and tourists alike. Surprisingly though, at around 11:30 there was no wait at all, probably because the morning rush had passed. Though the place was packed it didn't feel over crowded, the restaurant has a nice lay out. We were given a corner booth that was just perfectly sized and was kinda like your own private area.

Their menu is extensive and is creatively in a form of a newspaper. So cute! lol. I was glad I had my mind set on what to get as I perused the menu online ahead of time, or else I probably would've spent a good minute deciding as my husband did. 

I got the Spinach benny ($10.55), coffee ($2.75), hubby opted for Corned beef hash ($11.25), hot chocolate ($2.75), kids each got a kids meal: Mickey mouse pancake with added blueberries and comes with a strip of bacon and a drink ($6.25) and Buckaroo which is toast, egg, bacon and a drink ($4.50) All meals except for the Mickey mouse pancake came with a side of their famous Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes which judging by the name I thought was gonna be painfully spicy but thankfully wasn't, they were actually quite delicious! The food was very filling and satisfying, everyone was happy with their respective orders. Although for me, the hollandaise sauce on the benny was a tad rich and thick. I could only eat one. I can't wait to come back and try their omelets though.

Service was very commendable, Sandra was attentive but not overbearing. She brought everything we needed before we could even ask for it. We only had to turn our sign once and that was to ask for a to go box when we were ready to leave. Prices are reasonable for portions you get and comparable to most breakfast joints.

I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with eggs and bacon. It was freakin' amazing. It's possible that I could have been hungover and anything hearty tasted good. That said, I'd still come back to try out their other options.

Anyhow, there's no wait on a Monday, and the waitresses were very attentive and kind. Food arrived promptly and we were on away shortly after we scarfed down our breakfast.",Fm9zntNS_6n3j_yL73sbdw,2,2,5,DVAzpJHZAPl8qc9fXNfCSA

The menu is huge!! It's always a task to choose what to order. My go-tos have been the corned beef hash, Hawaiian style dishes, omelets, and the skillets. If you're one hungry, hungry person, you'll be happy with the portions. 

One of the must-gets is the Banana nut muffin! Usually it's included as an option with many of the entrÃ©es, but if not, be sure to check into yelp, and get one for FREE!! 

Recently, it was my first time at this location and I've been to other locations though. All have had good, friendly service. For warned, expect to wait, on average, 20-40min minutes on peak breakfast and lunch times as well as weekends*. But it's so worth it. It gives you time to look over the extensive menu anyway. You're welcome!

*Note: At this location, you give them your cell number and you can check status on the link they text you until they let you know your table is ready. Very cool!

The menu is extensive and, even with that, the restaurant is happy to make adjustments to your orders when requested. I had the vegetable omelet and added avocado. It was light, fluffy and delicious.

It was PACKED on a Saturday morning, but the wait time was estimated at about 10 minutes.

7 minutes later we were seated.

I'd been dying to try Eggs Benedict for weeks.  I found a recipe online that I want to try, but I'd never had it before, and had no idea what a hollandaise sauce was supposed to taste like. 

I ordered the Spinach Benny, which is the traditional EB dish, with spinach leaves.

I DEVOURED it.  It was so tasty!  The English Muffin was delicious, the Canadian Bacon was flavorful, and the eggs were poached to perfection.  I just love when the yolk oozes out nice and slowly...I love poached eggs.  So much.

The hollandaise was light, delicate and YUMMY!  I can only hope that my own turns out this good.

Came here on a Saturday morning, considering the amount of people, the wait was less than 10 minutes. They have outside and inside seating. The service sitting outside was not so great, but it's worth it if it's a nice sunny day :D 

Excellent breakfast spot. And great if your trying to eat light and healthy as well. The menu has a variety of options, eggs (durr) waffles, pancakes, breakfast meats, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, and the absolute best part MIMOSAS AND SCREWDRIVERS. I wasn't impressed with the mimosas but holy moly the screwdriver was served in a mason jar and deceptively strong :D

I had two eggs, WHEAT Banana pancakes, and a fruit granola parfait. The eggs were de-lish, especially when I sprinkled some of the provided greensauce on them. I admired how they made the pancakes with real cut banana slices cooked inside them. And I think the menu description ""short-stack"" is somewhat of an understatement, try HUGE ROUND STACK of three pancakes. Also, try sharing them with someone else, too much for one in my opinion- unless you're a beast. The fruit parfait was disappointing- too much yogurt, not enough granola or fruit. 

Of course this chain of restaurants is most famous for their banana nut muffin- and yes- have one, you won't regret it. Overall, great spot for an early breakfast with friends and fam.",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,0,4,COBWhN53vWCNWVhATFUAJg

After seeing the Board of Health reviews of Ellis Island, November 2012, I decided to go to a different stop on my next trip in Vegas. There are two locations for Egg Works. Here goes, the cliffs notes.
For breakfast I ordered the Italian skillet with a banana nut muffin, skipped the toast. The skillet was huge! I had my eggs scrambled hard. The were perfect. I can't stand runny eggs. It had potatoes, onions, peppers and sliced Italian sausage with a marinara sauce on the bottom. I would give it a strong 9/10. See the pics.The nut muffin a strong 8.5.

My wife had the corn beef hash. She like it but would like a bark on the hash. She also felt the potatoes were a little large. She loved the muffin. All in all, she gave it a strong 9/10. See Pics.

On our second visit, for lunch, I had the chicken steak sub with onions, peppers an provolone cheese and seasoned fries. The roll was toasted on the grill and buttered. Once again it was a lot of food. My wife had a burger with bacon, mushrooms, onions, cheddar cheese and lettuce. She too, had the seasoned fries. Both would receive a solid 9/10.

My server Tina was extremely friendly and went out of her way to make me feel special. She made great suggestions, my drinks were never empty, and I felt like family. I am going to always ask for her when I visit again and again.

The food was fresh and amazing. It felt like moms cooking and I loved it.

The prices are perfect for the tasty amount of food you get.

5396965,2014-06-03,0,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"Tried this place after reading the Yelp reviews of others and wasn't disappointed. They have a small outdoor seating area that I figured I'd take advantage of because in from Seattle and eating outdoors is very rare because of the rain. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food arrived quickly and the milk I ordered came nice and very cold. I tried the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet based on one of the pictures I saw on Yelp. The food arrived very quickly and was well presented. Eggs were cooked perfectly for my taste. The meal was very good and was fair for the pricing. The only small complaint I might add was the country potatoes in the skillet were seasoned with some type of seasoning that really overpowered the taste of the meal. For my taste, I would have preferred them without the seasoning and that way you could taste the gravy and chicken fried steak better. However, be that as it may, it was still very good, just not to my taste buds. I will try something different next time. They have a pretty diverse menu selection and there are many other breakfasts and lunch combinations that sound really good from reading the menu. I'd definitely go back and eat here again. Oh!!! Make sure you get one of their Banana Nut Muffins!!!! They are amazing as other Yelpers have mentioned.

The hash was a nice serving but it's fresh corner beef not canned....I actually prefer the canned and like when it's done crispy but this was still good! Haole loco looked good (but didn't try).  The banana muffin as always was very moist...yummy! We were overall very satisfied for about $20 and change. I'd recommend take out because their servers aren't very friendly and also not very friendly to kids (under age 5).  Both times we went there they just stuck us in a corner like we were an annoyance.  I must say that there are adults who are just as annoying of not more annoying that kids...so that's that.

The bottom had delicious potatoes, topped with chicken fried steak, country gravy, and two poached eggs. DELICIOUS!

My boyfriend ordered the prime rib benny. We were honestly expecting slices of prime rib, but they were just small pieces. It was good, regardless.

Plenty of parking, clean yet well loved interior, friendly and attentive staff, impressive menu, and loved the free banana nut muffin we got with yelp check - in! Freshly warm, super moist and fluffy. We woke up a bit late so had to wait 20 minutes to be seated on a Sunday, 1130am, for group of 4. Crazy busy so food took a while to come out, but we were fed well with hearty portions. One of our orders' eggs were wrong, but servers were efficient and quick to fix all our needs.

One of my reason for 4 stars: water tasted like tap, just a bit of personal pet peeve. Yuck. Encourages ordering drinks from menu, yes, but I don't like anything else, so I guess I'm just picky. Easy fix: perhaps get one of their juices by carafe, or get their bottled water (noticed this on menu after we left) 

1. Omelet stuffed French toast with their signature potatoes: for those who want both sweet and savory, dry crunch and moist fluff. French toast was dipped in maple syrup with one bite, hot sauce with next bite. Well done, egg works!!

2. Chicken mushroom spinach skillet, eggs over easy, with banana nut muffin: no complaints when melted cheese stretches 8 inches long! Nom nom all around, banana nut muffin was preciously kept intact to take home (since we gobbled up the freebie muffin) 

3. Works veggie Benny, ordered spinach sautÃ©ed, side of fresh fruits : average but solid hollandaise sauce. Beautifully complimentary flavors of grilled tomatoes, cooked spinach, avocado, poached eggs, and creamy sauce. Full and rich, this is a hidden gem that may be  overlooked because it's a veggie dish. Fruits were edible and sweet, unlike most places where they seem to just be hard plastic  decorations. Nice variety of watermelon, orange, pineapple, two melons and grapefruit. You won my heart! 

4. Corn beef hash on skillet, eggs scrambled with toast and their signature potatoes: good flavors, we expected a portion of the hash grilled so a bit disappointed it was all moist. Enjoyed with their variety of hot sauces.",OYTJtPPyKpkY6J-8lL4qsA,0,0,4,7xh_704tsni7_2M75qXXeQ

Last time I was here I suckered my self into getting the Prime Rib Benny, little did I know that the PR was niblets, what do I look like a child?  Real men eat fast slabs of rare+ PR, not scraps.   Never again. 

This time I decided to try something...classic,  chicken fried steak it iz.  Of course nothing beats Rise and Shine's CFS and that Country Cafe place in Mountain's Edge ain't half bad as well.  Mr. Mama's was aight or shop I thought, it's actually leaps and bounds over Egg Works sadly.  Again wroth the damn niblets!  Not only that, it was way over cooked and got me thinking that it was not made to order and most likely pre-prepped, boo!  

The wifey had the Works Crepe which was way better than what I got,  had we paid full price and not used the Groupon, I just might be cussing as you read this.  I love me some breakfast around the clock,  especially the simple dishes.  I think from here on I will stick to what I know and only go worth the fail safe items here from now on.

We came here for breakfast after doing some shopping in the area and saw we had a free banana muffin coupon available so we decided to give it a shot. 

The ambiance is so homey and very much reminded me of some of my favorite spots back in northern cali. 

My friend decided on the Santa Fe wrap, while i decided on biscuits and gravy with a side of toast (because it came with eggs and you can't eat eggs without toast!). Our portions were HUGE. I think we were a little shocked when our plates came out. I had one of 2 eggs, 1 of 2 biscuits, 2/4 pieces of toast and 1 of 2 pieces of bacon. Just writing this review is making my mouth water because the biscuits and gravy were so delightful. 

My friend didn't get breakfast, but his wrap was amazing! I don't even remember what was inside of it but it was like a caesar salad with additional seasoning. It was perfectly savory, but since it was a cold wrap it almost felt refreshing to be eating.

5653683,2018-01-06,0,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,Should be named MSG works. I ordered corned beef hash and my boyfriend ordered eggs benny. The corned beef and the potatoes should come with a health warning because of the amount salt they put in it. His poached eggs were over cooked and covered in a ridiculous amount of cold salty hollandaise sauce. When we brought it to our servers attention she asked if it was our first time and then informed us that we can ask for easy seasoning and that she should've let us know. It was a very disappointing experience,HTUnhtaQeGsjzkXeG-osOw,0,0,1,4q2F_lbvg9NGGortVmcqRQ

I had the California Crepe: ""Diced bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, guacomole and Swiss cheese. It is served with a side of Hollandaise sauce."" Hollandaise sauce was great, the crepe was REALLY stuffed full and I enjoyed it. It came with a banana muffin and home fries.

My sister had The Classic: ""Two eggs cooked any style with Works potatoes"" with toast. She ate about half of the plate and had the rest to go.

My brother had the blueberry pancake and our waitress, Nancy, upsold us on adding eggs and bacon so his meal came out to more than $9. My brother said his pancake tasted rubbery and that the eggs made his stomach hurt. Once he got home he said his head was hurting and ended up going to be bed early. I think he had a reaction to the blueberry sauce - I'm assuming it has corn syrup in it, which bothers him. 

My youngest sister had the kid's meal mouse pancake and she ate about half.

While it seems like my meal was by far the best and our waitress was great, our breakfast for 2 kids and 2 adults came out to $46 with tip. Yikes! Not sure it was worth that price.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,1,3,1jDxF1IJ_2rpLmIf3N59jA

It's like that. 

Ended up here for breakfast a good twelve hours after we had dinner at grimaldi's across the street. Haha, good thing it is so easy to navigate Vegas. 

Cute breakfast spot, reminds me of those local joints in SD, and SB. Not a diner but a place focused on eggs, pancakes, and all things breakfast. 

Worth a visit, good service and it's where the locals are! My favorite part was the ""happy face"" egg sign that you flip over if you need something. it turns into a sad face. Awwwwww. 

The kids breakfast menu has spaghetti for breakfast. How amazing. 

Would love a calm quiet place like this to sit and read over coffee and breakfast (that isn't ihop! ) cuz millbrae pancake house, stacks, and the like are not the place to lounge over breakfast.

I will say that the flavor of stuff is usually a little lackluster but I don't expect fine dining here.  Just know you might have to add salt or hot sauce and ketchup to stuff.  

I usually looove the banana nut muffin.  Warm with butter is the best.   This time we went the muffin tasted a little metallic and it was not warm.   Maybe because I got the free yelp one?

One of the more ideal places to go on the west side of town if you're looking for a full breakfast that has an over-abundance of sides, because for the price they offer, you get more than what you expect out of the portions (I would even go as far to say maybe even too much!)

Ordered the vegetable crepe without the swiss cheese, and got sides of wheat bread and seasoned potatoes. The vegetable crepe is HUGE and delicious, and they give you more seasoned potatoes than you can need! If you're a bread lover, they'll give you five slices in this meal! As delicious as it was, I could only finish half of the entire plate. Service was fast and friendly, and is even more so when you sit at the bar top when it's just for two (another reason why I enjoyed it... in and out in no time!)

I can understand how the unusual bright lighting could be a problem with enjoying your breakfast in that atmosphere (maybe they don't want hungover people enjoying too much time grubbing out in the mornings?), but the bright lighting didn't bother me whatsoever (and I appreciated it for waking me up some!)

Food is always awesome but lately the service have been ok to ehhh... I wouldn't say terrible but going to the fort apache location eventhough we live closer to this one, now their service is fantastic! From the greet to the server, and even the cashier. Just awesome! 
Our server today was Bridgette... She was ok but not very welcoming. She made us feel like we were asking her to do too much from the start. We asked her for some French vanilla creamers for our coffee when she came back to take our order and her response was ""ok do u wana order first""?? And when I told her that we had been waiting awhile and the coffee was kind of getting cold, she gave me an annoyed look and just walked away without saying anything. She then came back and gave them to me and even with the attitude she had I still said thank you only to get no response from her. That's one example and there were more. The only time she actually lightened up like she actually liked her job was towards the end she came to check up on us and handed us the check. Even with that kind of service we still added 20% gratuity since my father is a firm believer of tipping the right amount but I myself had second thoughts not to. My parents and I share our traditional Monday brunch from egg n I to other egg works location and some other breakfast places also. We were not as happy to say the least but we will still be coming back since the food is great!",tlAhD1bg5FBzQj4bdGW22A,0,0,3,O3FKwnA4OOfuvRNGhNwDQw

10 min wait and I came around noon.
There is A lot of selection !
Nice and cool inside on a hot sunny day.

I ordered the Spinach and Benny, nothing special. I like how they give a slice of watermelon and pineapple.

The banana French toast is not good. Too sweet, it sounds better than it tastes. They need pictures in their menu. I was expecting French toast with fresh cut bananas on top. 

Waitress was super friendly and never forgot about us. She was always there to check up on us and it was busy!

The GFs Egg Benedict was bland and just not satisfying. That may of been my fault for not building up the breakfast here and her craving Egg Benedict for over a week. 
 
My Omelet was good but it seemed like it was missing something; I think it needed salsa or refried beans it was a Mexican omelette after all.

It was the first time I remember having to pay at the door on the way out. I definitely didn't like having to get up after eating a big breakfast and stand in line at a crowded entrance to be allowed to leave. What if I didn't have cash to leave a Tip at the table and didn't want to put it on one of my cards? I'd have to go back to tip and fight my way out the restaurant... It was very inconvenient. 

Inconvenient is an understatement for the shard parking lot with a busy McDonalds and a fairly busy shopping plaza. Get there before the rush times and parking shouldn't be an issue.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,5,1,3,UgBwo7-EI2lkIKdLdPoaWQ

The customer service is the best and I felt like they were always there right when I needed them. Sometimes it is a wait, but it is well worth it. As far as the food, it is pretty good. You start out with the banana bread and you will not be disappointed. While I am not a coffee connoisseur, the coffee is on point. I have not had a single dish here that was bad. If you want a home cooked breakfast meal, this is your place!!!!!!!!!!!!

Cons - Hours of operation, wait on weekends.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,4,4,4,9ExwOY3x0lx_UNs2JMtnZw

The atmosphere is comforting and the decor gives me a welcoming feeling. Now the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the staff. Let me start off by saying I always ask for Veronica. Her service is flawless, whenever my friends and I come here we need her to serve us or it just won't feel right. Nicole was also one of my favorites, it's too bad she moved locations. I will have to visit her sometime! But for the few other servers I got while eating at egg works. Their service was not so flawless, I remember a young man with glasses. We had to wait a while to even be greeted by him. Did not refill our drinks till the very end. Also only checked on us once to drop the check. The other server I had was not very welcoming. She seemed to be rushing us the whole time but, when I saw her taking care of her other tables. She took the time to make sure they were okay but not us so much. Don't know why but that bugged me. Overall Egg Works is a great place to grab some breakfast.

5960002,2012-11-05,2,a0v7Si0DK4cIko7AQY4YXg,"One of the better Egg Works locations. The restaurant is more roomy and less crowded than others and I enjoy the ambiance quite a bit more. Even better, on a Sunday morning they were airing quite a few football games so my fella didn't feel like he was missing out too much by helping me satiate my breakfast food craving. 

There was a bit of a wait, but once seated we were asked by three separate servers in a 2 minute period for our drink orders, so I was already optimistic on the service. My fella and I both went with iced teas which they were refilled regularly. I ordered the sundance omelet and my fella went with the quiche pizza. The quiche pizza was tasty, although I probably wouldn't recommend it simply because I would prefer more egg and less dough in my breakfast. My sundance omelet was really good. Cooked exactly as I requested and had lots of veggies and cheese in it. I also got cottage cheese in place of the potatoes. I've never been a fan of their potato spices, so this was a great decision on my part. 

Overall, our meal was excellent and we both left full and happy. Service bordered on over-attentive, but I dare not complain about that as I would prefer that to servers who are completely inattentive. I don't see myself becoming a regular here, but with a coupon for Groupon, I'm always happy to come out for breakfast.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,7,4,eWTqNG5sU4bD29ceo8rCrQ

The menu was overwhelming, well for me since I don't know what I want half the time. Our server was nice, BUT I hate how I couldn't order the way I wanted. I wanted to substitute my ""house special"" potatoes for regular hash browns & she made it VERY DIFFICULT for me. So I COULDN'T order the way I wanted to and gave up. Honestly, that a big no-no in my book since I am the customer. She kept making excuses for me to not change it and I gave up trying to tell this ignorant server girl. Def didn't even want to leave here a tip !!!! But she was somewhat accommodating, but I waited a VERY long time to get her attention.

The food was brought out and it was pretty yummy. My food was just okay since I got a simple meal and it really wasn't as described on the menu. But ohwells ! The pancakes were good and my meal filled me up ! So that was good.

Everything was fair priced, food was food. Didn't find anything too special particularly and if only my server kept her mouth shut, then I guess they would have redeemed a few more stars. Haven't been back since.",pGmQFnXcAAXHWjKrRAcyhQ,0,0,2,6bRNMY2ZXfla5k88u7ciFw
