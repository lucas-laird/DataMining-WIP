The coupon stated that they had to be chicken, however it did not state that no alterations to the order could be made.

The total came to $20 and some change. Had we ordered regular bowls, customized the way we would like, it would have come out to $23. So the coupon saved us $3 when the coupon led us to believed we would be spending around $12 for our meals. We asked why it became so expensive and they stated it was because we had to order the standard bowl with no alterations. Because we didn't, they up charged us .50 cents-$1 for each change. We asked where on the coupon it explained that and she said it didn't have to say it and that it was how it was. We asked to speak to a manager because she was unable to explain it better. The employee said the manager was unavailable. So we escalated it to ask for the owner. They called the owner only for him to say that unfortunately the coupons were not accurate but that he would not honor the coupon regardless of the situation.

Teriyaki Madness


Life is full of disappointments, do you really need to add another to the list?  Teriyaki Madness is the equivalent of finding out a girl you like is going out with your best friend- and guess what... You payed for their date.  You had high hopes for this girl, saw her becoming a large part of your life, maybe introducing your friends and family to her.  She looked so nice in the pictures.

Don't be fooled by the ""madness"".  The only thing crazy about this place is how much ""average"" they can cram into a teriyaki bowl.

In all reality, the food isn't horrible, just bland and uninspiring.  I spent $10 on a salmon bowl with less flavor than I could make at home for $4.  However, there is something to be said for a nice, relatively healthy lunch option on-the-go.  For best results, temper expectations prior to entering.  And prepare yourself for flashbacks of the time you were an inch too short to ride that roller coaster as a child.",c1qnBMfMsGe4YUZxDGuC4A,0,0,2,bL92rLc8tAXCA7Sj26fHJg

2399898,2016-05-11,0,Y9oYrGHiMyRIRaudSWomzg,"Normally this place is pretty good, but if you modify your order you better check it. You also better make sure you know their terminology. They have my order history, yet constantly forget my extra container of veggies. Today I said I wanted an extra container of veggies, yet they took that to mean ""extra in the one container"". When I got to my car and realized there was only one container of veggies I went back in to ask about it and they gave me a very hard time. They even pulled up my order history and could clearly see that I always pay for two containers of veggies. She told me that because I didn't use the words ""extra SIDE"" and had used the word container instead that she didn't understand me. I will probably eat here again, but I will definitely make sure that whoever is taking my order is clear about what I want.

Update: Shortly after I got home with my meal, Dean (One of the founders of Teriyaki Madness) called me to personally apologize. I was very impressed. We discussed how they were going to improve training and he even put me in the system for a complementary meal.

We arrived, disappointed with the small menu, but continued to look anyways. I thought to myself, ""with those prices, it must be good!"" (Mistake number two). 

We ordered a regular sized bowl with orange chicken/noodles and a regular sized bowl with teriyaki chicken/fried rice. Almost $20, fine. The order was repeated back to us, no receipt though. 

Then our order comes out, both with brown rice, which neither of us asked for. We have to pay the extra dollar that was not charged in the first place for the noodles I didn't get, fine. We trade in our orders and are told it will be five minutes. 

Almost fifteen minutes later, the girl brings out the food asking which bowl had which side because they got it wrong. She had them switch it without asking first.

Ahh, finally time to eat. The chicken tastes that of cheap Chinese food, the vegetables were practically raw, and the noodles tasted like someone microwaved ramen for too long and threw soy sauce all over it.

I tell the woman what happened and she says ""I don't know, I punched in your order correctly."" Okay, the issue is not what you punched in but that the food I got was wrong. She repeats that she punched in the spicy breast bowl. At this point I'm frustrated bc why would I call if I had the right food order. What I have in front of me is a teriyaki breast bowl and I DO NOT care for it. 

I tell her, I'm not arguing about her punching the wrong buttons, I don't have what I ordered. She says in order for her to do anything she has to see the food. Why would I lie? I had no time last time to do that because I've been caring for a sick friend.

This is how ordering works: 

1. Select either the bowl or plate option.
2. Choose your protein, base, and side.

I chose the chicken katsu with a brown rice base and a side of veggies. The overall bowl could seem bland to some taste buds without  sauce, but I thought it was decent without it and the extra sodium. I also ordered a chicken egg roll for its ""exciting"" description, but it was the opposite and tasted like the frozen variety found at some buffets and fast food places -- what a bummer. 

Food is somewhat overpriced. A bowl costs over $8.00, and the egg roll was $1.99. To justify the cost, my main meal made me full, but I can't say that the egg roll was worth the price.

The service was good. I do like how orders are directly delivered to your table if you choose to dine in. There's plenty of booth seating, and the restaurant is clean.

3520239,2014-10-21,31,Y9oYrGHiMyRIRaudSWomzg,"My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as ""crazy good"" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,43,37,3,d5fAqa75mkfmtZ7t4k9eIA

I was so glad to see this location open. It's conveniently located right off the 215, on Decatur at the Winco and Target shopping center. The employees are great and inside is always very clean. 

I did hear a couple of people complaining because of the wait on the food. Um hello, it's fresh and cooked when you order. Each time I've visited,  I get in and out in no time and the food has been amazing each visit. Plus side to the wait, you can be more specific with the food....no sauce, extra sauce,  sauce on the side, meat cooked longer or not as long. You get the drift, it's worth the wait.   

To date,  the food has been on point. Chicken Yakisoba is comparable to some of my favorites around town. Yes it's that good. My go to has been the two proteins plate (available on plate only).

4155763,2017-07-09,1,Y9oYrGHiMyRIRaudSWomzg,"I really wanted to like this place. They have a very simple menu of protein, rice, and vegetable. I choose the large plate with two proteins: spicy chicken, beef, fried rice, and stir fry veggies. I loved the way the chicken tasted and it had a great sear to it. Rice was good but to me rice is rice and if it's not mushy it tastes fine. The beef, ehhh not so great. It was sooo sweat. Yes, I know it's teriyaki beef but it was so sweet it kinda made me cringe when I ate it. 

I don't think I would have been to upset that I didn't like it but it was kinda expensive. 3 people ate and the bill was almost $50. The order included: large 2 protein plate, regular bowl, large plate with extra meat, 1 egg roll, 1 crab Rangoon and no drinks. I mean come on for fast food take out that's a bit pricey for what we ordered. 

 I had a bit of heart burn when I ate and just dismissed it. But when I took my leftovers to work the next day and felt the same way I knew the food didn't agree with me for some reason. I just won't be back to this place.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,3,1,2,KanecMzhvC1aqg6xh7IcFg

I enjoy that this place is right next to our gym. But if not for that I'm not sure if I would travel far to get here. 

The chicken Katsu is crunchy and moist. The spicy chicken has a little kick and the teriyaki is sweet and smoky. My only complaint might be that 7-10 dollars is bit steep for a bowl/box of rice with a bit of meat. Between my wife and I getting a meal, an appetizer and drinks this goes up to 30 bucks pretty quick. The portions are enough for leftovers though so maybe not the worst.  

A good solid 3. Worth a try once. And every now and then if you are close.
