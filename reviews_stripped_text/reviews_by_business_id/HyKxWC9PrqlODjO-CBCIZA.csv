I was told it would be ready in 30 minutes.  Got my pizza at 1:30pm!!!  I counted 40 patrons in the restaurant with one preparer and one server.  The server was waiting on tables, taking phone orders, cleaning tables, and handling the register.  The preparer was throwing pans and told the server to stop taking orders. Customers were walking out.  So sad to see such a great restaurant implode over lack of staff.",tkP90IvtRJX2wqaYpQThYQ,1,1,1,mzYb8ykDiYW3lyURQuPQFw

The new cook screwed up my sandwich twice. I always order the Sal Italian sausage with mozzarella and hot and sweet peppers. Well I got a royal when I returned it the brought out a new sandwich wrong it was the same sandwich minus the lettuce and tomatoes but he left the coppicola  and  a bit of lettuce. So he was to lazy to make a new sandwich on top of that it took him 20 minutes to make it with only 3 other people there. So needless to say I will never step back in this location again, I will if I see Chris' truck that way I'll have my food made properly. Normally 5 stars but as long as the have the current cook zero stars. And I've eaten here 100 plus times, so a loyal customer no more.",CHXblPc4_Z4-VeoVcBFr5Q,0,0,1,F-FenGCwogILuQiK2M5GZw

I walk in and a short girl with long black hair takes my to go order. Customers come and go, 20 minutes later I'm still standing there. I keep looking over and making eye contact with the girl at the desk who took my order to make sure it wasn't ready. She's there having a long personal conversation with some guy. Finally about 5 minutes later (25 minutes or so later) she walks over to me and says ""excuse me sir but are you waiting for something?"". Are you serious? You're the one who took my order! So I tell her what I ordered (which was just a simple order of suicide fries) and she's goes and picks up the box that I saw the cook sit down 15 minutes prior and hands it to me. No apologies or anything. Her reply was ""well we had a lot of orders I can't remember everyone's face"". I'M THE ONLY PERSON STANDING IN THE RESTAURANT BESIDES THE GUY WHOS TAKING THE ATTENTION. AWAY FROM YOU DOING YOUR JOB! If my time isn't valuable to you then I won't bother. Everyone else at Naked City is awesome but it's a shame how one person can make you never want to return to a business again. Well I guess I can still go to the location inside Moon Doggies.",vh33AWm6Z743qPqwJD8jFA,1,1,1,YUJAmCqpKQ6f7rqrstEQWQ
212674,2014-06-29,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Yelp is my go to for recommendations, but this is my first time writing a review. This was hands down THE worst dining experience I have ever had! I know, I know... I should have listened to the others, so I really have no one to blame but myself, but we had an entertainment coupon and it was on DDD, so how bad could it be, right???  The first red flag should have been the guy alone PASSED OUT in the booth. The server said he was waiting for his party to arrive and acted like it was totally normal for someone to be sleeping, with their mouth wide open in a restaurant. Red flag number 2, besides him, there was only one other family in the restaurant, on a Saturday night at 5:45pm. We ordered our food (1 wee,1 not so wee, 1 salad, and 1 sausage sandwich) and then we waited. Red flag number 3, after we placed our order we had to give our dirty, paper menus to the people next to us that had just say down. I guess they didn't have enough to give them? Weird!!! After waiting 45 minutes we were starting to get really hungry and the restaurant was filling up. We asked about how much longer and the sever said any minute, but that they only had two ovens and there were a lot of orders. She laughed about it like it was a joke and when I said this is not funny, we are starving she said ""it's my job to smile"" in her snarkiest voice. This is when I started to lose my patience. My 4 year old was starving, (and at this point had eaten all of the snacks I had in my bag) as were the rest of us. When we ordered our food, we were the only table in the restaurant that had no food! The people next to us were already eating and I am pretty sure the guy passed out was not planning on eating. So why then was it taking 45 minutes to get our food!?!?  Finally 15 minutes later our salad came out, but we had no plates. Then one pizza came out, but not the other. The two other tables that came in after us got their pizzas before we got our second pizza and our sandwich!!! So half my family had no food! The other half couldn't eat anyway because they use so much cheese it took forever to cool off enough to be able to eat it. The service was terrible and my husband had to get up four different times to get napkins, knives, extra plates, and a box. The tables are also ridiculous. Every time one of us had to get up we had to move the table to be able to fit. We are regular sized people, but the tables are like picnic tables at a booth and the wood legs block you in. I have never had to move an entire table to be able to get out of my seat. When we were finally done no surprise the bill was wrong. They had said they would take off the sandwich because they messed it up (shocker) but it was still on the bill. As we got in the car to leave we all breathed a sigh of relief that dinner was over. I guess all you can do is laugh about it and of course ""yelp"" about it. Thanks for reading!",Y__9f-f6rM1NvVzsdvirkQ,2,0,1,D_4h-bUcWJPeecuYQ3b0ag

301668,2017-04-16,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Went there because of the great reviews, but could not see why they were so highly regarded in the first place. 

It says they're open until 3am, I got there around 11pm, and as I'm ordering, the lady tells me to make sure to get my whole order in, so I don't need to come back, because they'll close after my order... Um, OK. I said if my order would keep them from closing, I didn't have to place it, and she tells me it's fine. So I place my order, pay for it, leave a couple dollars tip, and there's not even a thank you. When I come back to pick up my order 15 mins later, it's not all correct, and rather than correcting it, all I get is a half-assed ""Sorry dude"" and not even a hint of an attempt to make it right. On top of that, the pizza I did receive was hard as bricks, and mostly tasteless.  My wife worked at Chuck E Cheese when she was younger, and commented that even their pizza is better, so do with that what you will.

483329,2015-12-01,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Unfortunately I don't get to review the pizza. Walked into naked city at 4:30pm on a Monday. Ordered two slices of cheese and was told it'd be five minutes. Sat down, 25 minutes later walked to the counter and asked where the slices were. I was told that they just put the cheese pizza in the oven and it'd be another ten minutes. I advised the people behind the counter that 35 minutes for two slices of cheese was unacceptable and asked for a refund, which was promptly given and I left. 

If a pizza shop sells slices (which not all do, which is fine) then there should always be a pizza on deck. If there isn't, then the workers in front should be aware. Regardless, if it's going to take 35 minutes for two slices of pizza, the customer should be made aware. 

It's a shame. This pizza may have been good, but the service and kitchen work prevented me from even trying it. When I'm served bad food, at least I get food.",WgY5vnpWHrL5r8a4EtxALw,0,0,1,20eTS796MnWvQEK1xZ4TvA

I decided on the garlic fries and the Guineas pizza! Both were excellent! The crust on the pie was so perfect ! By the time my food arrived at my table the place had pretty much filled up, with just the one gal working the entire seating area as well as handling take out and phone orders, she was outstanding and I give her a 10 stars out of five!

We ordered the chicken wing dip, rebel pizza and zeppoles. I was concerned at first about the wing dip because I'm not a blue cheese fan . They do offer ranch as a substitute but the waitress said that the blue cheese taste is no longer noticeable when baked. It was worth the shot, the dish had chunks of chicken and mainly tasted like buffalo sauce. Plus garlic pizza bread was tasty by itself.

The rebel pizza was loaded with tomatoes, sausage and ham. Personally it was a bit salty for my taste but after having a bite of their thick crust and gooey cheese... Oh man.. I knew I would be back.

You HAVE TO get the zeppoles. Warm powdered donuts with chocolate sauce. Do I need to say more? GET IT

Also had a slice of cheese pizza ( we do this across many pizza platforms to gauge quality ). A good mix of cheese flavors. Cannot go wrong with it.

Shared the 1/3 sheet guinea pie. Not overly garlicy and a good helping of their ricotta on the fluffy dough. The meat is also not super spicey (which I enjoy). A quality pizza with good ingredients.

I've ordered from this place before and I've never had such bad quality. Usually the pizzas are well cooked and they advertise ""cup and char"" pepperoni, meaning it's cooked enough for the pepperoni to get crispy on the edges.

NOTE: If you're a local and want to check this place out, please do so at your own peril.

The reason I make this distinction is that I saw a cab pull up with some diners, and I can only surmise that they were wary tourists who saw this place on ""Triple D"" and thought they'd try it out. If that's you, please save your cab fare (or at least spend it on a GOOD ""Triple D"" place, like Four Kegs) and go somewhere else. There are PLENTY of great restaurants in this city, but this ain't one of them.

I've never given a one-star review, and I'm sad to give this one, but it sure is warranted. My husband and I arrived around 6:15 on a Saturday. There was only one other table of customers, and we had to be somewhere by 8, so we thought we were in good shape. The waitress came by and took our order, and I should have known we were in trouble when it took us 10 minutes to get our first beers. I watched the waitress pour our drafts, and she was having a hard time with it. How hard is it to pour a draft?! And she brought them out one at a time, telling us she was ""still pouring"" the other one. (?!)

Then, we waited an hour to get our order: a ""wee"" portion of poutine and a ""wee"" Naked City pizza. I love poutine, but I'm not sure how mozzarella cheese and rosemary figure into the mix. Gravy on fries, yes, but the rest was just weird. And our pizza was certainly nothing to write home about. My husband is a professional cook, and he swears they used pre-packaged dough and canned or frozen toppings (pepperoni, sausage, and green olives). My palate is not that discerning, but I know a Tony's pizza knockoff when I taste it. SO disappointing!

The wait was annoying, but it also didn't help that I had an Entertainment book coupon that I was going to use on the poutine, and it wasn't applied to the bill. (A whopping $4 savings, but still...) We didn't get our food until 7:30 and we had to scram to make our engagement, so I didn't stick around to quibble over the bill. I also didn't stick around to eat much of the food, because it wasn't much worth it anyway. One piece of ""pizza"" and I was done. Thank God we only ordered a small...

The place filled up in the 90 minutes we were there, and I can only feel sorry for the other diners in the place -- especially the tourists who I hope don't judge our town by this sorry dining experience. I'm writing this review 9 hours later, and I just hope they're still not there waiting for their food...",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,5,1,1,g4IMjsvdkToHr4InuSD0Cg

We ordered a 1/4 Guinea pizza and a 10 pc wings-medium heat. Maybe this is just a good day to go. She told us 20-25 minutes, but we waited some extra because people here and on other review sites said they were very slow. We got there at maybe 6:45 or 6:50. The pizza and wings were ready to go. Not sure how long they had sat there but still were warm. So it had been ready on time. The restaurant was not crowded at all. So they did well on the service time.
We got home and had our wings, which were hot. I am used to heat, I do eat jalapenos and 'hot' wings so not a big deal. But if they didn't mess up, and if that is how hot and spicy there medium sauce is, then beware if you cannot handle the heat. Wings are the 'wet' style, so have plenty of napkins ready.
The guinea pizza was very good. We had sausage added as an extra, and I would recommend this. It is a white sauce pizza, garlic, cheese and meatballs too. Very good. 
For two grown men, the 1/4 pizza was enough food. We got too much, and ate too much, by getting the wings.

Since we hadn't eaten all day, the plan was to try multiple items and we definitely achieved that goal. Shannon, our server, was friendly and professional and took care of us even though it was clear we were over ordering for just the two of us.

We started with an orange flavored ice tea and a craft beer to wet our appetite.
Then, to the infamous suicide fries! Spicy and delicious!
Garlic fries with extra garlic? Yes, I believe we'll have that too! Unfortunately, it still needed more garlic! Or, could it be that we damaged our taste buds on the suicide fries?
A chopped salad without garlic or hot peppers to round out the meal? Why not? It was super tasty, with the addition of a bit of salt and pepper. 
A huge Guinea Pie to enjoy? El Freakin' Yummo in a uniquely-garlicky-kind-of-way. This pillowy-soft flavorful pizza has to be tried!

1614843,2015-09-13,3,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"I Want my money back

I got a turkey sub that included the additional cost of cheese. Fine but they put shredded cheddar no American slices. I was offered provolone and motz. I asked for mayo, onion, lettuce, banana pepper. They don't have banana peppers. They DO have ""hot peppers"" so I ordered those. I found them on the menu myself. Canned jalapeño and pepperoncini is what the ""hot peppers"" consisted of. And the cheese was stale!! The shredded cheddar!! If you don't want to make subs then don't put them on the menu!! 

I was also watching the waitress have a hard time entering my order into the POS system. She said ""I have to type a paragraph"" I didn't know if she was mad or not. Sorry the sub only comes with bread meat lettuce and tomato. No mayo! No cheese! Nothing else, so yeah people are going to alter their order because wtf kind of sub is that? I'm from buffalo and I seriously don't know how they could sell a sub like this. Also I've worked at Jim's steakout for several years when I was 16-20 and had no problems with using a cash register POS. 

back to the nasty sub I got...
They didn't cut the sub in half and it was seriously worse than subway. I'm not even eating it. I want to go back in and return it but the girls are busy (6-7 tables, 2 servers, 1 food runner) and I don't want to get yelled at. I waited 22 mins and paid $13 with a pop for this crap and I want my money back. I really don't even think the full sub is 12"" it looks more like 9 or 10. 

Pizza at this location is ok but arville overall is much better food wise. I've had a chicken finger sub from the other location and pizza that was good. 

One star for the pizza which if I was you I'd order from Arville instead. Good-Luck",q4S7dc56BuH0oY390tot8g,4,2,1,w51IErbSY4DuMaGEpoTFrA

With only four other parties in the restaurant, we waited more than an hour and a quarter for the one pizza we ordered to be brought out.  It was worth it, but I was prepared for it.

Other problems include the downgrading of beer, moving away from a solid collection of craftbeer to a handful of options.  Also a serious downgrading of the menu.

I didn't care for the sauce; it still had that ""aluminum"" taste (or maybe it's just me) that most places are able to mask a little better.

Pepperoni pizza: we ordered the 1/4 sheet, the smallest pizza they serve, and it was still a little too much for the two of us. I really liked the toppings and the crust; the crust was chewy, buttery, and soft, the pepperoni were insanely good and got that little bit of crisp around the edges. I almost bought some pepperoni to take home, but it was something insane, like $10 for a pint. Yikes.

The only tiff I had about the service was that the garlic buns and the pizza arrived within a moment of one another. I hate not having any time to enjoy my appetizer before my entree comes. It takes away from the appetizer. Everything was good, but not great.

1708655,2014-03-04,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"So, after trying Naked City Pizza at their original location on the other side of town, and having visions of the Guinea Pie dancing through my head ever since, I decided to try their new location on Paradise Rd.

Unlike its sister store, this venue does not share its interior with a dive bar; this is purely a pizza restaurant.  There is no smoking, and no bar.  They don't serve hard alcohol, just beer and wine.  When you enter, the friendly staff at the counter ask if you prefer to dine in or take out.  If dining in, they seat you in their small cluster of tables and provide waitress service.  If takeout, you place and pay for your order at the register and wait until it is ready.

The space is pleasantly appointed, but it lacks character.  It just feels sterile, somehow.  I guess you could hang out here with your friends for a while, but for some reason it lacks that comfortable hang-out vibe that fun restaurants and bars have.  Note, however, that they just opened a few weeks ago, so as they settle in to the space, perhaps that will evolve.

So the important question is: did the great Guinea Pie pizza survive the transplant to the new location?  Or is it a pale imitation of the original?

I am pleased to report that it is just as good as I remember it.

They also have a nice selection of microbrew beers; I was driving, so I didn't get to try any, but it looked promising.  

The parking lot is a bit of a mess; the spaces are angled backwards from Paradise Rd, so you have to circle around the corner to the entrance on Naples Drive (or, you could pull into a space backwards, I suppose).  Also, they share the lot with Office Bar next door, so it can get quite full.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,2,1,4,HaEeljRy6MSM342ONN1mmg
1732932,2016-03-17,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"After having awful tasting, overpriced meals on the strip we decided it was time to venture to high reviewed places off the strip.  Naked City Pizza fit the bill and we decided to stop by for dinner.  

Parking is a little odd here...don't try to park out front, it just won't work.  We watched two guys make a 323 point turn trying to get in and then back out when they realized it wasn't going to happen.  There is plenty of space available in the back.

As a lover of all foods spicy, the suicide fries instantly stood out.  We decided to do a full order of them and then a quarter sheet Guinea Pie.  We got some drinks as well and waited for our order.

The fries came out first...they were spicy.  I absolutely love all spicy food, but the habanero suicide sauce was almost too much for me to handle.  It was amazing.  I was sweating in places on my face that I didn't know could sweat...like right under my temples...it was crazy.  It took a while, but I built up a decent enough tolerance and was able to enjoy around half of them.  They were way too much for my girlfriend to handle.  These were amazing, anyone who loves really spicy food must try them out.

The pizza was good too!  The meatballs were really tasty, the cheese all tasted great, and the white garlic sauce tied it all together really nicely.  The quarter sheet was the perfect size for two, and we could have easily fed a third between the fries and the quarter sheet...this was a welcome change from the awful prices and small portions we were used to on the strip.

Overall it was a great meal.  Easily one of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  I'll be recommending this place to family and friends for a long time and look forward to coming back myself.",wxuVZTfo1pThbqfzz97uLg,0,0,5,kSsV9npTlC4iuLNnV2wifQ

So what makes this pizza so awesome? Well, everything basically. But really, it's because these pizzas come from the heart & soul of the owner & chef. I've read numerous articles and watched him on tv and he really does have a great story. He enjoyed great success as the youngest executive chef in MGM history. But it seems he gave it all up for... pizza!!!! How can you not love and respect that??? Pizza!!! Buffalo, NY style pizza! And he does it unlike anyone else. First of all he's making everything he can from scratch. Ricotta cheese. Meatballs. Sausage and so much more. So you know these are top notch, high quality toppings. The sauce is very understated. It's not dripping, it's not gloppy, overpowering everything...it's just good ol' back home sauce that's fuses everything together in perfect culinary harmony. 
But none of that means anything without the right crust. And this is the right crust. It's square. It's crispy everywhere it needs be and soft & chewy everywhere else. It's light & airy but hearty...it needs to support & hold all those delicious toppings. Here are a few of our favs; the Guinea. That house made fresh ricotta, house made meatballs, spinach mozzarella and a white garlic sauce. And the chicken finger pizza. The what??? Yea, I said chicken. And then I said fingers. They take their amazing chicken fingers...I order mine Sicilian style...and they put them on a pizza with blue cheese and mozzarella. The flavor is non stop. Every bite is better than the last. And then my other fave. The rebel. This is my everything pizza. Cup-n-char pepperoni, in house Italian sausage, ham, salami, marinated tomatoes, fresh basil, mozzarella & red sauce. The first time we ordered it we asked for no ham. They didn't listen. And we were so glad they didn't! It's a great pie! Don't skip any of those toppings.

I looked at the menu and was actually enticed by a few things like chicken wing dip and the pizza logs. I'm from Buffalo and just moved out here a couple years ago so I was excited I found a place that made those types of things. I ordered a delivery and saw the estimated wait time was 60-70min. I was like okay, no problem. At least it will be here by the time my other half leaves for work so he could take something with him.  Well, he couldn't even do that.  The delivery itself took over 2 hours which is ridiculous especially on a Monday. My delivery guy wasn't that friendly as well. No apology either.  I opened up my food and my chicken wing dip wasn't even close to being a dip. It literally was chicken fingers sticking on to burnt cheese and that's it. I couldn't even dip the bread in it. The pizza logs weren't logs either. They were just lumpy eggshells covered in grease with barely any filling in them. No pizza sauce with them either.  The only positive was my Philly eggrolls because I can at least see the filling on both side. I feel like I wasted 50 bucks and I couldn't even eat anything out of it.  I'm not impressed. I will not be ordering at the paradise location again.",SsxtDNWj81CRt32kFGoRvA,3,1,1,LRcZ_vHX7321iUOOgjFDNQ

2664943,2016-03-01,14,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Here's a shocker: The best pizza in Vegas is not on the Strip. Yes, I know you're gobsmacked, but it's true and Naked City Pizza is the proof. I usually don't pay that much attention to the Triple-D man, Guy Fieri, the man who single-handedly destroyed the Food Network, but occasionally some places he recommends are actually good. One was Broken Record back in San Francisco, but this may be his best find yet. This isn't the one he went to either as another Naked City Pizza, presumably the original location, is on the other side of the Strip in the back of a dive bar on Arville. Now that sounds like Triple D. Off the hook, dude.

This one is in a makeshift office building on the way to the airport which is exactly why Jamie W. and I ended up here. It wasn't crowded at about 5PM, just one ravenous family next to the window. The paper menu was a bit tattered, but we thought everything they offered appeared quite tempting. We decided the share the $7.50 Naked Salad, a bargain that combined iceberg lettuce, spinach, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, marinated tomato, and shredded mozzarella, all of it tossed in a housemade vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1RCNyjX). It was that tangy dressing along with the fresh ingredients that made this salad really hit the spot.

Because of the subheader description, ""Featured on Food Network's DDD"",  the Guinea Pie was our pizza of choice. It's made the old-fashioned Sicilian way in a rectangular, cookie-sheet shape with a soft, aerated dough that was quite amazing. The main topping was what they referred to as Grandma's Meatballs, which looked to be sliced and mixed with mint, accompanied by baby spinach leaves, heaping spoonfuls of ricotta, mozzarella and white garlic sauce. We decided to go for the $14.95 quarter sheet, which was plenty since it consisted of six hefty pieces (photo: http://bit.ly/1QoTOco). I think that dough could have handled any topping, but the white-on-white, Buffalo-style combination worked really well. OK, it was off the hook.

FOOD - 5 stars...genuinely exceptional pizza with a crust that really stands out
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing special but certainly clean
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...initially a bit icy but warmed up as we shared our praise of the pizza
TOTAL - 5 stars...really unique pizza well worth getting out of the casino for",m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,22,21,5,266hTehw2hLRPHN-zCICzw

When ordering, we asked how big the salad proportion was, and the guy said ""can serve 2-3 people,"" so my teammate and I decided to each get 1 slice of cheese pizza and share a Caesar salad. 

The slice of cheese pizza pleased me very much. It was a HUGE slice (looked like 2 but the other slice orders were just as big). It was delicious! The best part was that it was ONLY $2.75!

The Caesar salad does not feed ""2-3 people."" It's a good plate for just one person but probably still won't fill you up if you're hungry. Luckily, we ordered one too many salads, so my teammate and I ended up eating our own salad--best mistake we've ever made. The Caesar salad costed $8.50 ($11.50 with Chicken).

If you're ordering for only yourself, I recommend getting one slice and a salad. Perfect serving size for one!

The one con I'd add is the fact that the food took a really long time. We were in a bit of time crunch for our next game, so we were a little anxious for our food. Possibly, it may have also been because of our initial hunger and tiredness that made the 30minute wait drag on even longer. Plus, our group was big, so there's more understanding. However, I noticed on other reviews that their experience featured a long wait time as well...

Other than that, the place was great, especially for a large party. The others ordered a half sheet pizza, which filled them up.

The waitress was pretty dam efficient. Water was kept filled, came by frequently to see if we needed anything. Although I can see how she might be the one others have mentioned who has an attitude.
The place itself is pretty dam small and tight. Definitely not good for large groups.",ov4bm32qMFbdjgnjDkrhjA,0,0,2,EGhTueYaD-A8iTmEBw_zTw

The pizza and wings are really reminiscent of the pizza places I grew up with in the north town suburbs (Santoras, Picassos, Marvinos, Raymondos, etc).  ""Buffalo style"" pizza is unique and really hard to find outside of WNY.  I've lived all across the US and road tripped almost all 50 states and can't say that any other region has anything like it, but Naked City nails the crust, cheese and toppings (specifically, the little pepperoni that curl up when baked and act like delicious little oil cups).  I haven't tried much else beyond the pizza and mild/medium/hot wings & fingers (anything else isn't really a Buffalo Wing in my book), but I'll be back time and again just for that little taste of home.",G8sRZNgHz82iXn9gZQJozw,0,0,5,6yaqKGD7NZy9nV1r5ntx2g

3140302,2018-02-06,3,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Naked City Pizza on Paradise.. Sheesh.. Where do I start?! So I have been meaning to try this place out for quite sometime now and finally had the chance to do so when some friends came into town. Now this location is pretty much walking distance from the Hyatt Place hotel which was where my friends were staying. 

The night that we decided to give this place a shot there was pretty much no service whatsoever and what I mean by that is exactly what it sounds like.. No customer service... We called no lie about 4 times with no answer to the phone for a to-go order and finally maybe after the 5th attempt a woman answers the phone just to only place us BACK on hold.. If it wasn't for my friend being so adamant about wanting to have pizza from here I would've said screw it and went to one of the MANY pizza places in the area. The woman who came back on the phone was rather short and a bit rude because we had many questions about the menu. Oh and speaking of the menu the menu that they usually offer online wasn't able to be viewed because the website was down. SO yeah we of course would expect for some patience while we are trying to order food and give this business our money. 

One of the most rudest things a business can do is treat a potential customer with disrespect when trying to spend money at their establishment. Fast forward we ended up ordering the pizza, quoted the price as well as 30 minutes until the order would be ready. After arriving close to the time of what was told, while entering there was nobody at the front counter. A dim.. quiet place and after some minutes somebody finally came to the front who was the woman I assume was taking the orders. Told her my name and was then told the pizza still wasn't ready?.. How? It's a ghost town in here and furthermore you guys weren't doing anything but chatting back there..

Bottom Line.. Pizza was delicious but the customer service definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. Rule of thumb for me is I don't care how good the food is, if I'm not treated or welcomed warmly then I will never spend another DIME at your place of business.

What really stands out is the pizza. This is premium pizza with generous toppings. I've had the slice of the day which you can't get on the menu. So far I've had taco, chicken finger, chicken parmesan, and a couple of others but they were all excellent. I love love love the slices of the day but I also like the traditionals like pepperoni and sausage. The slices are so big and filling. I had only one type I didn't like, and that's cause I don't like horseradish. I can't remember the name but it wasn't too bad. 

The customer service can improve a little, but rarely do I come to Vegas and get great customer service anywhere. They have two locations and this location is much more generous with the toppings so I only come here. 

I come here each time I'm in Vegas because I haven't found better wings and pizza!

The seating is the worst I've experienced in a long time - super low tables. Every time I moved my legs I thought I was going to tip the table. It is no place for a full sized man.  I ordered wings and I asked for them to be hot, a slice of pepperoni pizza and a small beef, cheese and peppers sandwich. The wings were perfectly cooked with good crispy exterior but very under seasoned and under sauced too. I asked for hot and they were the mildest wings I've ever had plus very little sauce was on them. I noticed that the plate they were served on only had a few specks of sauce left on it when I'd finished the wings. The pizza was not at all for my taste. The crust was very bready and doughy, soft and limp. The sauce had a very nice bright tomato flavor but no other flavor - no taste of spice, herbs etc., one dimensional and bland. the cheese was abundant but rubbery and the pepperoni was warmed thru w/o any bit of char. It tasted like it needed more time in an oven or like it was microwaved. It was boring and bland. The sandwich came wrapped in paper which seemed weird for an order that wasn't to go.I had the sandwich last and I think the paper wrapping made the bun steam a bit. By the time I ate it, the bun was soft on the outside where it should have had some crusty texture. Was not appealing. The meat was grey, dry, featureless, unseasoned and the little bit of cheese seemed like an afterthought.  The sandwich as a whole tasted of peppers and little else, like the other two items, totally bland and boring. . I tried three items and all three were bland, boring, poorly executed.

All of us but 1 have never been here so we were all excited to try out this place our friend was raving about. Parking is scarce, so it was a good thing most of us carpooled. The restaurant isn't really big, but was big enough to have 2 parties of 10 and a couple of extra tables for other guests. 

Being a fan of the Food Network shows, I was pleased to find that Dining, Drive-Ins & Dives was here....so naturally, I ordered what Guy ordered. 

Suicide Fries:  Fries smothered in a hot pepper blend and habanero-garlic sauce. Topped with sliced jalapenos and yellow peppercinni. 
   I wasn't too thrilled with it because the fries were wet and soggy. I have to note that the sauce they used was the same sauce they used on their 'suicide' hot wings. The sauce had a nice heat and kick to it, with a nice, smoky flavor.

Guinea Pie Pizza: Grandma's meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella.
   I ordered the smallest one they had, the 1/4 sheet. Man! It's HUGE! I swear it can feed a whole family! I had about one slice which was really good. The dough is homemade and I was told that the chef grows his own herbs, which is a big plus! 

Why 3 Stars? 
1. The fries were soggy. Not because it was smothered in the sauce, but because the fries wasn't crunchy to start with.
2. The wait for a table. It was a long ass wait.
3. The restaurant was dimly lighted. The guy standing in the front, behind the register, didn't even have lights to see. It wasn't until we were about to leave(11:30pm) that someone figured out that they should turn on some lights for the restaurant!",yPVnXy6Zf3LefjcbjOABDQ,1,0,3,gtyan5dMfRqdAMxXjAaSzw

At less than $5 for a full on specialty and less than $ for a basic cheese, this place is a steal.  The slices are huge and preparation time is reasonable.

3751905,2017-09-10,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,I discovered naked city a few months ago and have been eating it at least 3x a month now. I always order the guinea pie. I have yet to receive a bad pie but it was bound to happen and it did last night. I can never remember what they call they're sizes so I've always asked for the middle size and it's never been an issue. Got to the store and received the small size 6 pieces. They were about to close and I was charged for the small as well so I didn't make a fuss. Once me and my family started eating we both noticed our fist pieces didn't have any meat. So we kept eating and more than half of the pizza was like that. Usually you can see whole circle pieces of sausage throughout the pizza but this looked as if there was maybe 3 pieces of meat crumbled across the pizza we were lifting the cheese hoping it was under there too it wasn't. I kid you not it was so bad I literally saved any meat I came across from my pizza and added it to my sons slices. Really disappointed... these are the cheapest pizzas. Still give 3 stars because I love the Arville location and this is the only issue I've had with naked city and I'm not sure if the small order is different than the larger ones as far as meat quantity. Will still be a loyal customer,XzcfH6aS6W80XlSQSTKpIg,0,0,3,0_X3kR9u-oqPqbMKRfwhpA

Well the pizza tasted good and the wings were just alright nothing to rave over

Now I'm guessing the wings were just alright, reason being most likely undercooked. Resulting in both me and my friend having food poisoning within hours of eating the only thing we ate that day. 

Hours later both shitting our guts out, super nauseous and then later in the night puking up everything left in our stomachs, couldn't eat for the rest of the day

3959231,2015-01-16,0,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"My boyfriend hails from Buffalo/Niagara Falls, NY, so we are always on the lookout for places in Vegas with pizza that reminds him of home.  We came upon Naked City, the Paradise location on Yelp.  Here is our interesting experience...

It was a bit hidden as other Yelpers pointed out, but we found it and parked in the dimly lit parking lot surrounded by dive bars.  My son, bf, and I went in and were promptly greeted by a friendly hostess.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, but not cramped at all.  Freshly painted and I loved their wooden tables, although my bf is over 6' tall so he felt the table a little low for his knees.  Great music selection playing, mix of oldies and classic rock and black and white photos adorning the walls. 

The server was warm and funny, we liked her right away. We ordered the poutine, the buffalo wings, and a half sheet of pizza, half with pepperoni, half cheese.  My man was glad to see they had Gennessee ale.  Poutine was delicious. Crispy fries, warm salty gravy, chunks of melty cheese, what's not to love?  My bf didn't, but he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Buffalo wings....wiiiiinnnngggss. Yum.  Perfect crisp combination of meaty wing and medium sauce that was enough to make me die happy.

 Now... here's where the story goes a lil south.  An obviously very drunk, loud man entered and sat down yup, right next to us. He loudly states to no one that he's waiting for a pizza to go with ""meat...all the meat!"" He looks over at us and says hi to my bf who gamely engages in small talk with him, during which he asks for one of our wings.  My bf politely declines. 

Now time seemed to stretch on into infinity with us waiting for our pizza and Drunkie Drunkface waiting for his.  In this time he continued to slur to my very hard of hearing son, learned some sign language, and insulted where I'm from.  Our pizza came first, and was fantastic.  Crust was thick as I read in other reviews, but a pizza with that much stretchy, flavorful cheese requires a sturdy, fluffy crust that can stand up to it and show it who's boss.  The sauce was good, and in perfect proportion to the cheese and crust.  Drunkie is staring slack jawed and unabashed at our pizza like he was gonna wrestle it from our hands.  I tell my bf to let him have a wing. He was so happy, munching away.  Once we were full (which was quick since we basically inhaled the pizza) we gave Drunkie the rest of our wings, and waited for the server to come with the bill. She didn't come. And I was so ready to be done. 

TBH, I felt like she was avoiding eye contact with us, knowing this guy was there and she didn't want to deal with confrontation.  Okay, I don't blame her... a lot. So we said our goodbyes and carried our remaining pizza up to the counter for a box and to pay.  I informed the server we had entertained Drunkie for our entire meal and asked if there could be a discount involved and she said, ""I know. I'm so sorry."" And discounted us 10% (which we incorporated in her tip anyway).  It was VERY nice of her to do that, but I would've rather enjoyed my delectable meal in mozzarella filled peace.  And that my friends, is the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars.  I would definitely do it again, maybe to-go next time, but believe me that food is worth it all!",3uPFvvFK9KNexbrArw2W6Q,2,0,4,ijIlmTWemVEMSozMlOLEOg
3970121,2018-06-23,5,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"7 adults and 3 kids gathered here recently and we shared a number of dishes.  Once again, Naked City gave us great food from starter Happy Plate to cannoli dessert.

We started with the Happy Plate which was a combination of vegetables, two cheeses, and olives served with some crostini.  Then came the pizza doughnuts which are not on the menu yet.  It's a combination of two cheeses and some pepperoni wrapped in a dough and deep fried and served with marinara.  You could pig out just on these.

Then came three Naked City subs--a pizza sub, a Matty P sub (a more traditional salami, ham, cheese sub), and a ham slaw sub which was the winner hands down.  The ham salad in the sub was wonderful.  This was a winner with the whole group.  We also got a bowl of hand cut fries with the sandwiches.

Next came the pastas.  There was penne a la vodka (the favorite by far), a creamy mushroom Alfredo, cappellini served with Naked City marinara, and the last was Naked City Sunday gravy served with house marinara stewed with beef and sausage.  To accompany the pastas, there were two large chicken parmesan breasts.

To cap off the experience and for the kids of all ages, we got the Buffalo pizza 22 with white garlic sauce, sausage, pepperoni, crispy garlic, hot honey, and mozzarella.  This pizza divided the group. I was taken aback when I got to the hot honey on the pizza.  It was supposed to be hot from red pepper flakes but I tasted sweet honey and although I liked the pizza, this flavor doesn't say pizza to me. I guess I'm too set in my ways.

If this weren't enough, we got a plate of cannoli for dessert.

A good old fashioned hero that you wont find anywhere else. My only complaint was that the dishes do not come out together.

Props for offering local (local Vegas and local Buffalo) beers, but with such a small selection, I couldn't really find one I liked.
Prices are good and they have really great specials during NFL games.
The tables are low and the chairs are high. So much so that you can't fit your legs underneath. Annoying.

We also got an order of wings with the Sicilian hot sauce on half and the put bbq on the other half.  We started it all off with the garlic cheese rolls. Think cinnamon roll only pimped out pizza style.  These were awesome and I'd recommend them to anybody.  The pizza is more of a neoploitan style with a thicker crust and made and served on a cookie sheet and cut in big squares.  They had a nice amount of toppings and cheese along with a tasty sauce and an excellent crust. The wings were cooked to perfection and served with a fair amount of celery and carrot sticks all with a really good quality blue cheese and/or Ranch dressing. Both styles were great but I thought the BBQ was outstanding. We quickly realized we could have easily gotten away with ordering 1 pizza and 1/2 the wings and had more then enough food.

4219173,2016-07-21,1,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Pizza= cold with an abundance of cold cheese and lackluster dough. A simple cheese slice with sweet peppers should have tasted better and at least been hot (in temp.). It was not. 3 slices and a starter of stuffed banana peppers came out in reverse order; slices  first?? Not only did this occur in weird fashion, but the slices were clearly made before the starter was finished so they just brought them out to prevent them getting cold....well that was a fail because I bit into huge clumps of cold cheese and lukewarm sauce on dough that had little taste. I believe the slice wasn't even cooked long enough because it lacked the browning bubbles that cheese gets when browned. 

When the starter finally arrived, it was stuffed Anaheim chiles and NOT yellow banana or Hungarian peppers. A big let down when the menu states what they were supposed to be and the two peppers are very different in taste. Moreover, it was clear that the peppers were charred quickly then stuffed, and not baked with the stuffing leaving the peppers still crisp/raw and not cooked enough. This was also a lukewarm item placed atop a bed of COLD ranch dressing? Supposedly white garlic sauce but definitely was ranch dressing. Gross. And two peppers for $9.50 is not pizza joint price.

Overall, the food was less than mediocre and the service was slow for being the ONLY diners.

Overall we sort of enjoyed our meal but the meatballs were not my favorite at all. The meatballs were too thick sliced and really dense for the Guinea Pie which made it odd to eat. When biting into the pie everything was soft and easy to bite into except when biting into a meatball. It was dense and hard and ruined the pie for me, I pulled most of the meatball off or avoided biting into it. Fiancé said the same about his meatball appetizer. 

Wings at most establishments disappoint me as we are very particular about very crispy well done wings, light on the sauce.  Even though we stressed light on the sauce they still were coated generously which resulted in flaccid skin wings. We noticed the table next to us ordering plain wings and they looked pretty crispy and regretted that maybe we just should've got them plain. 

Would I come back to Naked City Pizza? Yes I would, I crave Sicilian style pizza once in a while and they do make pizza well, I just will be more careful about the way I order.  Avoiding meatballs and getting the plain wings next time.",IGBilULpgNHfKitLfrs7Hw,3,3,3,nJTJbiXSY6M7THwM36SiyQ

4655073,2018-01-28,8,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"After hearing wonderful words about Naked Pizza, I finally had the opportunity to see why hours  before attending the Yelp 2018 Elite Badge Day at the Hofbrauhaus on January, 18. It was their Sicilian pizza that led me to write additional wonderful words about Naked Pizza.

   Born and raised in New York, I recognize exceptional pizza. In New York, Sicilian pizza is popular. However, in Las Vegas Sicilian pizza is limited to a few establishments. ""What is Sicilian pizza?"" You may be asking. According to Wikipedia:

     ""Sicilian pizza is used to describe a typically square variety of cheese pizza with dough over an inch thick, a crunchy base, and an airy interior.""

  According to this review, Naked City saved considerable money and time to savor two slices of Sicilian pizza. In lieu of an $800* round trip flight to New York City, it costed me $9.54 plus a $1 tip to savor the two slices of Sicilian pizza with mushrooms. It was $2.75 per slice plus 50 cents for the toppings. The glass of Coke was $2.50. And after chowing down the Sicilian pizza, I have something to shout out about. ""This hole in the wall pizza restaurant at the resort/ UNLV dividing line practically across from the Hard Rock Hotel gives the typical New York pizzeria Sicilian pizza, a run for their money. The one difference was that this cheese overflowing from the thick square corner slices onto the square white plate was whiter than the Sicilian pizzas that I know of in New York.""

  At the 3 o' clock hour on a Thursday afternoon, business was slow. Upon walking in from the one entrance that faces Paradise Road at the northeast corner with Naples Street**, the man at the counter greeted me. He told me to sit anywhere in the dining room. He brought me the one page menu (shown below). From reading this review, I assume that You would think that Sicilian pizza was my first choice. This isn't the case. If their sandwich menu included the eggplant parmesan sub (in New York called hero), I would have ordered it. After a few minutes, the man returned from the register to take my order. He would make a few additional trips from the register to my table to bring me my glass of Coke, my food, and my check. I rate the service as solid.

  The restaurant could be described as a hole in the wall. In my opinion it reminds me more of a College town restaurant at the periphery of a university. A couple of these College town restaurants that come to mind are the former Park Bench outside The State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Bally Hoo by Indiana State University. The reality is that Naked City Pizza is both a College and resort town restaurant. It sits off the Paradise Road corridor which separates the UNLV and Las Vegas Strip Resort District. At any rate, the gray walls are adorned with a flat screen TV, a Buffalo Bills pennant, interesting framed pictures that include family portraits, historic Las Vegas, football, and hockey. Hanging on the window facing Paradise Road is the 2017/18 Golden Knights schedule. Instead of sitting at a bar stool, I sat at one of the wooden tables overlooking the gray walls of pictures.

 It is encouraging to see that there are restaurants in Las Vegas that serve the same delectable New York foods that I grew up with. The two slices of Sicilian pizza that I savored in Naked City Pizza live up to those that the typical New York pizzeria had served me.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,18,20,4,uX85d3MdZbXCdfD9bPYLqw

You can deliver solid food, but if you can't deliver on service consistently then the food will only carry you so far. 

We came in and where immediately greeted by a female employee obviously suffering from a bad day...but from what I could tell from the other patrons we were not the only ones suffering from from her bad mood. Either way we were committed and wants to try out these pies. First disappointment 2 beers on tap? 2nd the appetizer we ordered the Philly egg rolls...these were Meh at best. Very greasy and not much flavor. But we were not here for the appetizers and here for the pizza. So after not too long of a wait out came the pizza...we ordered Guninea  pizza and the Margherita 1/4 sheets both were very solid choices. This is what we came in for but isn't deserving of a 4 or a 5 star just because nothing else really delivered.

Ok, maybe I'm biased but I think my hometown has some of the best food in the nation. Having wandered west I have struggled through some pretty horrific culinary wastelands. Still trying to get over the horrible food in Colorado where people think Olive Garden is good Italian (insert hard eye roll here).

Vegas, no doubt, has great food but Naked City just became a weekly spot for me. 

I came in just off good reviews. Looked at the wall - Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo Bills pics...hmm interesting.

Looked at the counter - Weber's mustard...hmm.

Next to the mustard, Chiavetta's marinade...hmm.

Sahlen's hot dogs? Ok what's going on here? It was like a Buffalo parade of foodie happiness. I ordered the suicide fries (yes not for the faint of heart), 10 hot wings and a half sheet of Naked City pizza! I figured I wanted leftovers!

After eating, I demanded to see the owner. Yes, he was from Buffalo. I hugged him like he was a long lost brother. 

AMERICA, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THINGS HOLY - stop asking for ranch with your wings. It's blue cheese. It's always been blue cheese. You wouldn't have a peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich would you? Don't ask for ranch - it's embarrassing - you should know better.

I saw Naked City on Postmates, and thought I'd give it a try. I'm happy I did. Their pizza has an extra thick layer of cheese, which I liked, but the sauce was a bit sweeter than I think it needed to be. the sausage was quite good and didn't have that artificial level of spice that some add. 

We ordered the big pizza, which is huge. We also ordered a bad of zeppoles, which were pretty good too. They come with a small container of chocolate. (If you like chocolate, ask for and extra container, the one didn't do it for the who bag).

5279112,2018-06-20,4,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"When Chris Palmeri announced a whole new menu at Naked City Pizza on Paradise it was only a matter of time before a visit was planned, Saturday's pre-concert meal proving a perfect opportunity to gather seven adults plus three children and taste eleven new items including one still in progress plus a couple old favorites.

Still working hard across multiple venues, Christopher stopping by briefly during a typically busy day but otherwise leaving dinner in the capable hands of Robert Chaney, it was with several tables pushed together along the near wall that diners sat with Soft Drinks in hand, Sinatra crooning overhead as the ""Happy Plate"" arrived featuring housemade Pickles plus Olives and two styles of Cheese, all of it quite good but a ""best bite"" a Floret of Cauliflower on toasted Bread with a smear of Chevre tinged in Honey. 

Going for the gusto next with the aforementioned work-in-progress, an ever-creative Chef planning new catering options with ""Pizza Doughnuts"" featuring Cheese and Pepperoni at the center of a crispy Fritter, suffice it to say that the table's self-designated ""picky kid"" devoured two despite poo-pooing several other items without even a taste, the Pizza Sub that is essentially a toaster-style French Bread Pizza converted into a Sandwich also making a good impression. 

Enjoying a big bowl of Fries along with two additional sliced Sandwiches, the Matty P stacked thick with Cold Cuts plus Vegetables slicked in housemade Vinaigrette and Ham Slaw living up to its billing as ""the best Ham Salad you ever tasted,"" it was next that four new Pastas would arrive, the Cappellini and Sunday Gravy both offering extra-thin Noodles topped in Sauce though only Vegetarians or those on a diet should select the former over that which is upgraded by slowly simmered Beef and Sausage. 

Hearing others state the Mushroom Alfredo was a bit ""bland,"" a lack of overwhelming Salt in comparison to many not unwelcomed by those who appreciate the flavor of Mushrooms, it was nonetheless that all present felt Naked City's Penne a la Vodka was the best dish of the night with Pasta still featuring some tooth tossed in Sauce that balances Herbs, Meat and Tomatoes elegantly. 

Never one to exit any Naked City location without Pizza, a Midwestern childhood built on thicker Crusts making Palmeri's Pies as reminiscent as they are delicious, it was eschewing the Back Home or Guinea in favor of one dubbed ""Buffalo 22"" that the crew got their fix, some not loving the Hot Honey as much as others but those who did grabbing extra slices before polishing off a sizable portion of Chicken Parm for just $14 and wrapping things up with Sin City's best Cannolis.

FIVE STARS: Always taking chances and usually coming up a winner Naked City Pizza remains a quintessential part of Las Vegas' dining regardless of location, though the place on Paradise remains the most well appointed with the recent menu changes adding yet another reason to visit.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,5,L4QDp7gueedWZoiP4j62Kw

When I found myself in Vegas i thought I would try this out because hey who doesn't love pizza?! So I decided to go with the wee guinea pizza but swapped the meatballs for their house made Italian sausage and a glass of flavored iced tea. The tea was ok initially tasted weird as I was expecting pain tea but it grew on me. 
Now the pizza. Oh the pizza. I consider myself somewhat of a foodie. I love good food and I'm willing to pay to get it. Initially I want too impressed with the pizza and almost asked for some dipping sauce but decided against it. Best choice I ever made. I slid that streaming hot piece of pie into my plate and hesitantly took a small bite so as not to burn my mouth off. Oh man, let me tell you, this pizza is amazing! The crust is thick ava chewy and cooked just right n the toppings do something magical and definitely check you onto the train to flavor town, express route! The homemade sausage is to die for! Very spicy but oh so good! And they put several large pieces. I definitely think two could share the wee pizza. 
I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas and next time I'm bringing a friend so we can split and try more. The fries looked fresh cut and delicious but I salt didn't have any room left to try them.

5560759,2017-11-15,1,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Guy Fieri sends us to another dive off the list of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives! 

We recently watched Guy visit Naked City Pizza and found out they opened a second location much closer to our hotel and the Las Vegas strip, so we walked down a few blocks to grow our hunger for some pizza!

The place is definitely a dive! Very sports-bar esque theme, especially since the guys seem to be Buffalo Bills fans and have a few TVs in the restaurant. It also isn't very big at all, very close and quaint. 

We came by on Sunday around 1pm and there were only two other tables dining in and one worker the front of house running plates and cashier, etc. The worker was very nice and friendly and gave a great run down of the menu, including the sizing stating the small portions feed about 2-4 people and the 1/4 pizza sheets are about the size of the menus. We were also glad to see the menu had notations of which foods Guy Fieri ate so we remember what to order from the show! 

For the three of us, we ordered small suicide fries and a 1/4 sheet of the Guinea Pie. 
These ""small"" fries are definitely not ""small""! 
Now, I get that these are called ""suicide fries"" and the menu clearly states how they are spiced with habanero and the likes. . . BUT I do wish the waiter had asked if we can handle spicy foods or if we would like ranch/blue cheese or something because these are damn spicy! We didn't even finish half of these but if there was some sort of dip or if the suicide sauce was put on the side, then sure. Overall though, the fries were very crispy and had great seasoning, and the habanero sauce was very flavorful! It had some true flavor other than just being suicidal in spice. 

Now for the pizza. This is some damn good pizza!! And the size was pretty big too, bigger than the menu for sure as he had mentioned before we ordered. The crust is thick like pan pizza or best comparison is to BJs restaurants, while also being buttery and crispy in a similar fashion! 
The Guinea is topped with house made ""Grandma's"" meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta, white garlic sauce, and spinach! These toppings combine to make such an amazing pizza! The meatballs are juicy and seared nicely, as you bite into them you can actually taste and feel the crust as they were just sautéed on a pan. The flavors are great and very well like grandma's meatballs! There is so.much.delicious.ooey.gooey.cheese. OHMYGOD. Every bite has my pulling the cheese from the crust i LOVE it! The garlic sauce is thick and creamy and has the perfect amount of garlic. The spinach brings it together for a fresh bite with the slight bitterness!

Overall, a fine establishment for food and alcohol pairings and to catch the game! I would love to come back for both the fries and pizza, but to be sure I get some ranch with those fries next time!",iqsUoSxTpzAxt8AX8OgSZA,3,1,4,8b6JFPuyL0i5mmJc5G1wPg

They even helped by pushing some tables together to accommodate our group. The restaurant offers a small selection of craft beers,  but you can also go to the bar next door (which is also super cool and has great specials).  

Our group got three 12 cuts and two appetizers. We tried two of the specialty pizzas (the names are escaping me but they were both delicious) and a pepperoni and mushroom. They came out piping hot and yummy! The dough and the toppings were all so good together. 

We also got the loaded potato fries and the stuffed mushrooms. While they were both delicious,  the mushrooms were my favorite! I would go back just for those!

We started with Garlic Roles and they are great. soft stringy cheese warm cheese inside and dip in sauce. 
We had the naked city a and Margarita Pizza 1/4 tray on each was more then enough for the four of us.You know a good  mozzarella  when it stretches more then a foot. All the topping are fresh tasting and full of flavor. Some might say there are not enough toppings, but their topping have a great full flavor you don't need it loaded. The crust was good and a perfect fit for the pizza, no issues here.

5708261,2017-11-11,1,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"We were staying at Hard Rock Hotel and wanted to find somewhere to eat that had supported the first responders and victims of the Las Vegas shooting. There is a long list of restaurants that have done this, but we chose Naked City Pizza because it was close to our hotel. We are glad we got to stop in here, after we found it of course. So there is a sign on the corner of Paradise and Naples that would lead you to believe the pizza place is in this tiny shopping center on the right side of the road, but all we saw was a cannabis store and a different pizza place. We looked across the street in the other parking lot which was dark, and it appeared to be the back of a cheap motel and then a small building that said Office Bar. We flipped a U turn and tried again. Frustration set in as we really couldn't find it. We turned back onto Paradise and I called them. This is when their customer service started to shine. The young man who answered, I wish I had his name, he walked me through the steps to get back to the location. Well, Naked City Pizza storefront actually faces Paradise instead of Naples, and my only complaint is their sign is pitch black in the evening! As we were walking up there was a guy outside that said this is the best pizza in Vegas, so I had high expectations. We walked in to a fairly small establishment and the guy at the counter I assumed was who I spoke to on the phone, he was wearing a USA hat. He greeted us and seated us. He got our drinks, took our order, and all with a pleasant demeanor. I would say there's less than 12 tables inside with an additional several seats counter height looking out the window. A couple TVs that were playing Thursday Night Football. Mellow crowd. 

Our pizza came out about 25 minutes later, I just had a slice of salami and mushrooms, the salami was in little squares, I liked it. I'm a round table pizza kind of girl but this pizza was good. Fiancé got 1/4 pan of the ""Rebel"" which was 6 giant squares almost too much for his 6'3"" 240 pound frame. His review: he's coming back. The crust and ingredients all standouts. 

Same guy that originally helped us was on top of refilling our drinks and answering our questions. when we were leaving we spoke to him and another guy about the reason we came to eat here. He told us more about what the company had done for the victims including other locations and fundraising.

5778739,2014-06-17,2,HyKxWC9PrqlODjO-CBCIZA,"Good poutine, good service, cheap greasy doughy pizza, really skimpy with toppings - that about sums it up, but keep reading if you feel like it. 

The poutine was pretty great and a steal for only $4 - fresh cut crispy fries with salty but good peppery gravy and generous amount of cheese. I could be wrong, but they seem to use mozzarella chunks, not cheese curds, which were also cold. The meal started out really well. Then came the pizzas...

We got small Guinea and Back Home Pies. Online pricing is wrong btw they were $13 each not $12, but even the wee size was pretty big. You can easily feed 2 with the wee because of how filling the super thick crust is. It was like an equally greasy, but not as crispy version of Pizza Hut pan pizza. 

They're really generous with the cheese, but stingy as hell with the toppings. This 2nd location recently opened, but don't believe the older pics from the Arville location or their online menu pics, it's super misleading. What they show on one slice is about what you get on half the pizza. The Guinea pie had MAYBE half a meatball on the entire thing, but was loaded with ricotta, mozzarella and spinach. Really dumb because the meatball is cheaper than the cheeses. The moisture from all that spinach also made the crust really soggy. The Guinea sounded awesome, but wasn't. The garlic white sauce also was extremely bland. 

Back Home was a little better - crust was super crispy in the beginning, but soggy after the first piece. Again, really generous with cheese, and short on sausage and pepperoni. It was better than the Guinea, but still not very good - soggy pretty quickly and literally dripping with grease. 

Service was great even though there was only 1 person doing the counter, phone orders and playing waitress. She was sweet and attentive. 

Also their tables are ridiculously small. Do not sit at a 2 top because the pizza pan takes up basically the entire table. They need to invest in the stands that most other pizza places have. 

I would return for take out on poutine and to try their loaded fries, and maybe the sandwiches. But I am not at all a fan of their pizza. I'd recommend this place if you're with a group and looking for value, but keep in mind that you're only filling up on bread and grease. I'd rather pay more for a smaller, better quality pizza.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,1,2,0fsQ-KCiNcqeNK0P4YFjVA

I called in at least 3 weeks in advance for my order. Of course I had to call back as they do not return calls when they tell you they will.  They're busy.. fine I'll let that slide.

2 weeks before I place my order for 3 full tray pizzas and a large salad, they said it's a large order they had no problem delivering it to my venue. Perfect.

Days before my event, I called to change one pizza from pepperoni to a more veggie white pizza instead.

I've probably talked to the same catering contact 4 times by now!

Day of my event, 7pm start time, requested delivery was set for 7pm.  I get a call from a CA number at 6:30 which I happen to miss because I of course  am too busy setting up for my party.  Another missed call at 6:45, same number. Finally i check my messages to find out it's the catering man. He wants my credit card to charge BEFORE he can come deliver. By this time it's 7pm.   I call back and pay so he can bring my food while my friends are starving. He arrives 20 min late and all my Pizza is cold. The Guinea (my fav) is also burnt looking and most people didn't even touch it. The salad I asked them not to toss dressing on was tossed anyways and inedible so that went straight to the trash. Of course I had a party to entertain so I called back to let them know how upset I was and hoping they would offer a credit or something, but nothing. He was busy also And asked me to call back... great chasing him down again, no thanks.

It was about 8pm on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty full, minus a few spots on the counter which was where we were sat. We were given menus and asked what we want to drink and all that jazz. The server was hustling solo and she made sure to check on us as we took our time ordering beer and selecting a pizza. 

I opted for a Joseph James IPA that went perfectly with the sausage and pepperoni pizza with a garlic crust. Did you hear me?! Garlic crust. Buttery, parmesany, crunchy, yes soft inside, (did I mention buttery?) garlic crust. I was in love. 

This isn't the best pizza I have had in Vegas, or in my life, but it's a perfect spot for a slice, or a whole pie before, during, or after drinks. So for that, I thank you Naked City.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,30,18,5,hkZnx2kGj43ZianQy7N6AQ
