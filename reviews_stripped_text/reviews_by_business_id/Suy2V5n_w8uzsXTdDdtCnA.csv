Prices are a bit on the high side but nothing unreasonable.  Ambience is a little lacking, just some tables and plain walls, but the service was good considering it was standing room only.

Portions were good too. Neither my wife or I could finish our meals. 

Be sure to try the Coxinha (chicken with the catupiry cheese), and ask for some farofa to put on your rice and beans. The dessert cake (chocolate coconut with condensed milk or something) was amazing.",VjA-zecRIqBUYUQQotToNg,1,0,5,j2r27aqAkf-AZNc8l_8CxQ

I ordered the steak dish and the steak was paper thin and extremely dry. It was like eating paper. The salad and French fries weren't that great either but were edible. I got the Coxinha, which was a surprisingly heavy fried potato ball, which didn't have much flavor and little bits of chicken in it. Then, I got one of the Brazilian drinks and tasted really watered down. Another major problem was that they were out of several things I wanted to order, and they were the true Brazilian types of dishes. This rarely happens when I go out to eat. The service was fairly good, and the waitress (maybe owner) was very friendly, speaking English very well. However, this place was big disappointment for both my friend and me. Since I've gotten to know several Brazilians in the past few years and heard much about their food, I was looking forward to trying some good food.

When I walked in, the lady told me she would be right with me and walked to the kitchen for a good 10 minutes. Then another customer came in and she took his order right away ahead of mine. Again, after taking the second customers order, she told me she would be right back.

Just when I was about to leave she comes back out and asks ""what do you want?"" I the rudest tone you can imagine.

I had a lamb gyro combo which included salad, fries, the gyro, and a drink.

I was surprised when the wait wasn't long since she made me wait so long already. Then I realized why it was so fast.

I'm not joking when I say the lamb pieces looked like microwaveable sausage patties. The fries looked like microwave food as well. I figured I should be open to all types of food, but this place has almost scarred me for life.

The menu had many options and was at a very reasonable price.  The service was beyond suburb and it was refreshing to see native Brasilians working there.  I forgot his name, but he was very attentive and friendly.

One of Worst Pies I ever laid my teeth on:

Medium Pepperoni Pizza: I watched them pull out the pre-prepared pan already stuffed and flattened with dough. Hmm.. I haven't seen this in a while.. Well, can't judge by that alone but I can judge it after I have it! Crust was as thick as a pizza hut pan pizza, more on the thick side but not real deep dish. The dough had an awful flavor and consistency was similar to those microwavable Celeste pizzas! Cheese didn't taste any better. Pepperoni were spread evenly and not loaded, also tasted cheap in my opinion.

I thought, Marcos Pizza was the worse pizza I've had But this place makes them look good?! Just telling it how it was.. (I did try this place a while ago, so maybe they changed their ingredients or recipe..)",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,8,0,1,xSHCbSg-9Iovif_vBFN2Qw

My wife got the feijoada special, while I tried the picanha. Everything tasted great and was very flavorful. The picanha could've been cooked a little more rare since it was nearly well done, but it had plenty of fat on it which still made the steak super tasty!

- beef or cheese pastels (an appetizer sort of like a fluffier version of an empanada)
- coxinhas (an appetizer sort of like tastier versions of chicken drumsticks)
- chicken milanesa (an entree, imagine a chicken parmigiana-esque dish)
- picanha (an entree, essentially a good cut of steak with great seasoning)

I ordered the chicken fingers with fries. Not the greatest chicken fingers, likely frozen, but the two stars comes from what happened after I started cutting my chicken in half to let it cool down faster. One piece was very undercooked so I put it off to the side to let the waitress know when she came back out. The rest seemed fine so I ate those while I waited; good thing, since my boyfriend was already finished with his gyro by the time she showed up again. When we politely told her that everything was good minus the undercooked piece of chicken (I showed it to her), rather than apologize and offer to get me a new one, she gave us an annoyed look like we were bothering her and instead got a plate for me to deposit my already-cut-in-half piece of chicken onto and she brought it back to the kitchen to be cooked more. When she came back, she dropped it off at the table with still no apology. What the heck??

The more traditional Brazilian dishes looked pretty good and decently priced, and we were thinking of coming back to try. However, after the off-putting experience of having a piece of chicken taken back to the kitchen to be recooked after I already cut into it and the lack of basic customer courtesy, we will not be coming back.

This is a really authentic Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas, so if you are looking for a cheap, good, authentic brazilian restaurant and all you can find are those gigantic and expansive stake houses, now you found your place. Boca do Brasil has authentic street food, that kind of food you can find anywhere, from padarias to small bars downtown Copacabana and in the center of Sao Paulo.

Boca do Brasil have brazilian salgadinhos, Guaraná Antartica, homemade catupiry, sandwiches,  pasteis, and a beautiful, comfortable, yet small environment :)

The service is great and they speak good English,  Portuguese and Spanish! Their waitress is super funny and she learned Portuguese while working over there. The owner is always there and their food is super fresh!!! You won't regret,  but remember that this is a very affordable place so don't rate it down just because it's not like ""Fogo de Chao"" and other super high end expensive brazilian stake houses in Vegas. This is not a steak house! This is a contemporary brazilian restaurant that serves authentic and fresh Brazilian foood.

They usually have Brazilians eating there so you know it's authentic and good! Their tv always plays brazilian channels and they always give you free ""Cachaça"" shots when Brazil scores during the soccer games.",J4sI9iOi0ZmB7Q1t1vSqPA,4,1,5,DAuCixZ1KrvxpWd62H9QrA

We were the only ones there but people started to trickle in for take out. 

Wish I took a menu so I could remember the names of our dishes. :o/

Our order: 
Coxitan: Tasted like a deep fried breaded mashed potato ball with chicken. Pretty good. The potato inside was warm but the chicken was just room temperature. 
#8 Steak and Eggs: So disappointed with this dish. The egg looked overcooked and dry and the steak was UNSEASONED! Come on guys, just a bit of salt will do the trick.
#9 Steak with potatoes: A bit better, but it really didn't even look the dish on the menu. It was just one potato, not even cut. Still good, but eh. 
#Gyro: I was expected nicely sliced lamb or beef. But it tasted like sausage? Breakfast sausage? Still I enjoyed this dish. The pita bread was nice and soft.
#X-Americano: Ham, egg, cheese sandwich (on a hamburger bun). Nothing special but I liked this better than the gyro.

Many people think Brazilian food is just what they eat at these expensive restaurants, without ever eating what people in Brazil eat every day. Unfortunately I think this affects their reviews.

I lived in Brazil for a few years, and since returning to the US I have missed eating what I ate in peiples hones every day. The coxinhas, beans, rice, meats, salads, and even pasta dishes that I craved butbcould never find here in Vegas. 

Someone told me about Boca de Brazil and I knew I had to visit. Im glad I did. Everything on the menu I have tried is absolutely amazing.  The Coxinhas in particular are made the same way they are in Brazil, and are huge. My in laws from Europe had their pizza during a visit and they told me it was the best pizza they have had in the US. 

I have always had superb customer service and the family that owns it are Brazilian. The mother recognizes me now when I come in and alwayd makes it a point to poke her head out of the kitchen to tell me hello. 

I woukd recommend any of their dinner and lunch plates, as well as their coxinhas and pastels.  Again, try the pizza, especially with chicken and catipuri cheese, you won't regret it. 

I hear they are contemplating another location. If it is on the east side of town I am going to get into some trouble!",z4PPQzMDaQZIjzYhcsniLg,1,1,5,Gh94yMSu_2s_vBbseWkG4w

The reason why I didn't go before was I had a bad experience here during my pre-yelp life.  But you know me - always willing to give it another whirl.  Especially since a lot of time had passed and they were touting new owners/management.

OK - so we get there and I see that not much had changed there.  They still had canned drinks only.  No drink fountain.  No fear, I did drink a lot of water that morning.  The single can of soda made me feel sad.  I would have rather had water.

It took a while for us to be ""waited"" on. Huh-huh-huh... No, not funny.   We were the ones doing the waiting.   When we finally got to order, we opted for the the $5.00 Gyro special.  It took a very long time for the food to come.  When it finally came I immediately started eating. Not bad.  I am a sucker for gyro's and fries.  

Unfortunately, service is part of the equation when I rate a business.  This place had close to no service.  I also felt ripped off because of the ""waiter"" service, I am obligated as a decent human being to live a tip. 

If this place would invest in a real drink fountain, some more focus on SERVICE and allow people to order at the counter and pick their food up at the counter a-la fast food style, then I think it would be a winner.

They also tout a Brazilian menu items here and it did seem to bring a lot of business for their Brazilian food while we were there. Waiting. Watching. Waiting...

Off of Fort Apache and Trop, right behind KFC, Taco Bell, and the neighborhood Roberto's.   

This place has a Brazilian pizza menu that delivers but I never once tried it.   

I come here for their traditional plates.   

Always delicious and filling.  Rice, beans, salad.   All very distinctly subtle with Brazilian spices.   

Portuguese speaking in the background.   Always full of Brazilian ppl.    Nice get-away until I make it back to South America.",Iw3Fi7wFhmy39CwbiW5GLA,1,0,5,TXuVJ1axULDz0pESzv30FA

Their cooks seem to have changed. The stroganoff is now lacking a creaminess that Brazilian stroganoff has. The flavors are just not there anymore. We tried the place 4 Times again before I changed my review.
What a shame, service is always very very nice though.

**********************************************************

I really don't understand why this place has bad reviews, their brasilian food is really good, after all, the name of the restaurant is boca do BRASIL!! They serve picanha which is a brasilian meat cut that is out of this world, if you want to eat this meat youll have to pay $50+ and go to a brazilian steakhouse. Here they have it well cooked, well seasoned for about 13 or 14 bucks. They have strogonoff which i really loveeeeee, they are sweet people, trying to run a business. Stop making it hard for them and stop giving bad reviews because they only have canned drinks. really??!!! oh and by the way, you have to wait for the food because THEY ARE MAKING IT FRESH. Their food really is delicious.",_q2lz0mNPM3rL_0EiCUEWA,11,3,3,K_0H6kFUOs5gfOZNNHkTkA

It's definitely more of a carry out type eatery than a sit down and eat restaurant, but I just can't get enough of it.

The lady behind the counter who usually takes my order is also very friendly.",-2pGJoexGJfLUjMbTGYoYg,0,0,5,LbDzvnHLskoUDMJamndDcA
5659306,2017-12-02,2,Suy2V5n_w8uzsXTdDdtCnA,"A little hole in the wall place with some very tasty feijoada for $16.95 a plate. When we first walked in, we thought it was a to-go restaurant as it has a tiny convenience store area. 

Place definitely is not a place where you need to dress up at all. It's very small, and could fit maybe 15 people inside. Obviously, this is not a Brazilian steakhouse, so don't worry about needing to shell out $50+ a person on dinner. Per person, with a drink, tax and tip, you're looking at about $25. I think that's a little steep for the atmosphere and location, but what can you do?

They also serve American hamburgers if the person you're with is too picky to try Brazilian food, but don't bother bringing a picky eater. The feijoada is one of the better ones I've had, but the picanha is way overcooked. Make sure to order it medium rare, as the default way of cooking it is well done. 

If I didn't want to go to a Brazilian steakhouse but was in the mood for a quick Brazilian dish, this place would fit the bill.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,7,3,3,a_M-yTZhK12oA_k4Zy5vfg

I got a steak and eggs meal. The steak was really really tough. The marinade or  seasoning was not good but it was edible. The rice sucked - really mushy. The beans were not good at all. The eggs were not bad. The 2 stars go just for the french fries!! They were great!! They remind me of NJ diner fries :)  I don't recommend going here.
