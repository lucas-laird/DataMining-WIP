Great brats, and i don't even really like brats all that much. Burger is just under in-n-out level, but like someone else here said, above mcd's and the others.

Also really like the sauce that comes with the chicken tenders.

Their homemade ketchup is more of a tomato sauce seasoned to taste similar to ketchup and is pretty damn good too. The seasonings they use to turn it into curry ketchup is just too damn good in my opinion and totally made the order worth it. 

Fries are VERY good. They look like ordinary regular fries but they taste totally awesome.

Dita's is a bit on the pricey side when compared to other fast food joints. I can understand that they need to charge more because this isnt Germany and some of the ingredients need to be sourced from different suppliers and some things need to be home made. Overall i would say the extra dollar and some change is worth it as you're getting something completely different from the normal fast food burger joint. 

I like it and would totally recommend this place for those who are looking for something different yet completely casual.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,6,4,4,IyEbOgngIgv_fUi6gQ534A

It's very clean, and while I think it should be far busier than it is, the service at Dita's was outstanding - warm, welcoming - and everything you would expect from a nice family-owned German restaurant.

The shocking part was the price. Less than $5 for a meal that not only filled me up but made me happy and comfortable too? 

It was pure joy biting into a fresh bratwurst nestled inside fresh brotchen.  When I saw the Currywurst  on the menu I immediately knew that this place was somewhere I needed to take my mom so she could savor the flavors of home.

This kind of goodness rarely happens in Vegas, so this one goes on my list of favorite places for comfort food.  ""So good"" is an understatement.",cqHqdupbqm7YPPK9Odnm7Q,0,0,5,91jtdcqaL1ok8SgM9TzMLA

I've heard comparisons between Dita's burgers and those of In-N-Out. My usual order at the famous drive-thru chain is a grilled cheese, so I asked Dita's to prepare a cheeseburger minus beef patty. It was pretty good, with the familiar thousand island ""spread"", but the slices of American cheese were cold and not melted. My husband ordered a house specialty, bratwurst on a German roll. The roll was crusty and fresh and resembled those from the German Bread Bakery. He really enjoyed the brat and the tasty German mustard accompaniment. Fries were fries, but the ketchup was cheaper than Heinz and weaker in flavor.

I ordered a cappuccino, which tasted more like instant coffee than fresh espresso. The flavor was good and the steamed milk had produced a nice foam. It was served in a cup with Nescafe and Abuelita advertising, so I may have to try a mocha next time if they really use Abuelita chocolate.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,5,1,4,Rpx4GAFsmnFivv7Hbu09WA

2786733,2012-10-22,0,svTDpnD6yj77h5iH9lDucw,"My menu selection was minimal so I cannot fully comment on the wider menu items. Restricted only to the Brats I will say they were some of the best I ever had, but that isn't much...  But still damn good. I had them with onions and bacon, but wil lminus the bacon and mustard next time. The meat itself was perfectly seasoned and the texture oh so divine. 

Had passed by several times, once at 10pm and they were closed, so this time decided to stop in. Was the only one in there until - a young couple came in for just fries, and then 10 minutes later two biker guys ordering burgers. This was a Friday night about 8 pm and really it was empty. I felt bad as its been open several months.

My wife doesn't like sausages really any kind except for Italian sausages with onions and peppers. Were from Brooklyn! She doesn't like hot dogs, polish sausage, brats, kielbasa, etc... So,I got one for myself while she sat in the car. The joke was on her... It was great!

I got to speaking to the owner, a German man, originally an attorney who worked for many years in Brazil where he met his wife, a Brasilena, who is the cook. He is a very nice man, very accommodating and friendly and we struck up a conversation about the business and how things were going. He said the lunch traffic was not bad but nights were quite dead. Not reflective of the 85,000 vehicles passing by peak hours. The drive thru though was busier than in store service at this time.

I got the brat, took it out to the car, had a bite,  and asked...no, pleaded with my wife to take a bite... It was burning hot and I scalded my finger and mouth but let it cool for a sec, she tried it and said to me, no ordered me to go get her one. She stated I should also tell the owner that that's how good she thought they were... The fact she wanted one, coming from someone who hates this type of food, was a comment on the quality and taste.  So going back in I threw caution to the wind and in addition to her order I also ordered the owner-recommended currywurst, basically just a brat sliced in curry ketchup... Bummer. I was disappointed with this somewhat although he reviews here seem to be good. Instead of placed whole on a bun, it's sliced and drenched in sauce and served with some dried bread on the side. I know that's how it's served in Deutschland but wasn't really my thing...

My bread was stale, I know it's supposed to be dried out with the Currywurst but a bit too much I think... I also think theres a difference between dried and stale...The curry sauce was way way to sweet, cloyingling so! It was ketchup and curry added...as is the German way but... much too much sauce. I would order it again if it was served whole on a bun with the sauce as a condiment,  OR sliced as it were but not served drenched in sauce...

My wife has already asked to go back, so this bodes well. The problem I see is he should be successful in theory based on the food, but the location is not ideal in my mind... I suspect just one block east on the other side of Decatur is a world away and would make a world of difference. I also think he needs to extend the German menu, as he seems to focus less on the German.. with only 2 types of brats. The rest of the menu is a knockoff of In & Out, and not as good from what I've heard here as well as the review snippet in the LV Weekly magazine. 

Maybe get some fried pork and chick cutlets or another types of schnitzel. Add other sausages like Bockwurst. Or how bout Kartoffelpuffer: fried potato pancakes served crispy and with applesauce and sugar or salt.
German Br√∂tchen: Is an open-faced sandwich served on fresh bread and topped with ham and cheese. Spaetzle as an alternative side to fries? Just some thoughts. I like the. Place and want it to succed. He needs to expand the Germanic menu items and increase the marketing and visibility. Maybe some Groupons, Living Socials, entertainment books coupons... I don't know. Coupons in the Sunday LVRJ? A lot of the business could come if he was open late if only people knew the place existed...
I am worried.

I saw that it was be reopened under the name Dita's, I have never heard of that name before and searching the web has no results, so I assume it's not a chain.

They have burgers, sandwiches, chicken fingers and German sausage specialties, of Brats and Curry Sausage.

I had a double cheese burger, fries and a small drink, $7.56 with tax.

The meat actually had some flavor and juicyness, so many places nowadays the meat is tasteless. It's served on a normal bun, with thousand island dressing, onion, tomato, lettuce and pickles. I took the pickles off, as they were sweet pickles, which I do not care for, others may like them. 

I found the burger good, not as good as In & Out, but better than McD, BK and similar chain stores. The fries were typical frozen fries, somewhere between the McD shoestrings and steak fries. The sodas were the Coca Cola genre, Coke, Mr Pibb, etc..

I found the staff friendly, also I thought the customers were bit over friendly welcoming me, until I realized the people I thought were customers were other employees, apparently they had a morning staff meeting, and they all hadn't left yet.

I was offered samples of the German sausage, I tried both, they were good, but I'm not one to judge, since I'm not partial to German food.

The bratwurst was perfectly cooked, and the mustard on it was very, very good.  The brochen (bread roll) lacked the chewiness of what you get in Germany, but it works well.  It is much less messy the way it is served at Ditas.  We enjoyed it very much.

The cheeseburger was juicy and had plenty of cheese.  It reminded me of a Fatburger without the crazy Fatburger price.  

The service was very good. The man at the drive thru explained that it would be a 3 to 5 minute wait because they make everything fresh.  We did not mind at all.  Fresh, hot food is certainly worth the small wait time.

I actually had the chance to try their curry fries which the GF, whose half German enjoyed and reminded her of the food she had as a young girl in Germany. Brats are great and flavorful however the GF mentions that you can get a much better over at Cafe Berlin which unfortunately I have yet to try. Burgers were good but not drive all the out of your way good. 

Probably the worst thing I did have was the Hawaiian Burger which was one of their burgers topped with pineapple, bacon and this nasty, over-processed artificial bbq sauce which killed it for me. Service was hit or miss, it was run by both the owners a former German businessman and his wife (Dita) who moved from Vegas to Brazil hoping to bring more German fare to Vegas. Unfortunately a few weeks after our first visit they shut down operations.. You could somewhat tell by their demeanor and the empty seats.

After driving by Dita's every day where the Del Taco used to be and upon a recommendation from two different friends AND the presence of a coupon we decided to give it a try. When we walked in the place was empty around 7 pm on a Friday, not a great sign generally but let's face it Las Vegans are not always known for their taste in higher quality fast food as I believe we now have seemingly 163 Jack in the Box locations and still 72 Burger Kings in town. 
 We presented our coupon for buy 1 Dbl Cheese burger  Combo(not bad - approx 7.50) and receive one regular hamburger free($3 value I believe) and it was happily accepted by the front counter man- who I believe was either manager or owner. We took our seats in the clean, bright dining room- comfy. The motif and tunes were mostly 50's drive in style which fit the burger theme overall. I was actually told I should have ordered one of their famous german brats or ""Curry Sausage""- some sort of speciality apparently- And I definitely will next time but wanted to use the burger coupon this visit.
 After about 5-7 minutes our number was called we grabbed our tray of food made fresh and it was good. Perfect crispy shoestring fries, a basic no- frills burger with a good, not great patty but very fresh and pretty juicy too. Adorned with the basic lettuce, tomato, american cheese and 1000 island condiments, this should appeal to fans of In- n -Out and/ or Five Guys. Can't wait to venture out to some of the sausage choices next time. The free single burger was also outstanding.

My young Austrian friend knows that I love German cuisine. So, when he told me that he'd treat me to some AUTHENTIC German food, I thought he'd take me to one of those few German restaurants in Vegas. Well, was I surprised that he brought me to a FAST FOOD JOINT called Dita's!  - And, after a great eating experience, I was very happy and grateful that he did! 

YELPIER DETAILS:

My friend ordered for us, ALL IN GERMAN: 1 order each ""bratwurst with kraut"" and 1extra order of ""currywurst with fries"" to share. Our orders came out looking very appetizing and tasty in every bite! 

The sauerkraut was a bit salty, not sour enough to my liking, but it was crunchy, the way I loved! The curry sauce was on the sweet side, but after we added extra mustard and salt, it was wonderful for dipping the sausage and fries! I wish the sauce had a little bit more kick with more and spicier curry. Well, even in Germany, almost no 2 curry sauces tasted the same anyway, so I couldn't be too picky.

My Austrian friend said, although he is not German, he knew enough German cuisine and culture to vouch for the authenticity of those tasty dishes. I myself had worked and lived in Germany on and off for a few years, and had grown to love the great variety of German sausages. What we had at Dita's brought back fond memories of my wonderful time in Germany, enjoying bratwurst and currywurst in various fast food places over BEER! Hmm, how I wish Dita's would serve beer! And I wish, also, they'd expand their GERMAN MENU.

We enjoyed our AUTHENTIC German meal very much this afternoon. I will definitely go back to Dita's for more, with or without my Austrian friend!

BTW: Dita's ""50's diner decor"" made an old man like me feel very comfortable. But, almost all customers today were young folks. The place is not big but spacious enough; clean, bright, and comfy. Its restroom is well maintained.

My husband on the other hand loves that German sausage, so to make him happy I put my dislike for brats aside and went in with an open mind. Lucky for him I was starving, and my pregnant belly was aching for anything at this point. So Friday night we mosey on over after he read some of the reviews on yelp. He ordered himself a bratwurst on a roll with some spicy mustard a side of French fries and the owner who is straight out of Germany provided some curry dipping sauce on the side. I ordered a cheeseburger combo that came with a nice amount of French fries and a medium sized soft drink for 6.95. My cheeseburger was juicy and very flavorful. It was soaked in condiments nor was it falling apart, it was pretty darn delish! Now my husbands bratwurst was served on what looked like the perfect kaiser roll, it was flaky on the outside and yet soft to the bite....the aroma coming off of that bratwurst was so enticing I had to have a bite, it was AMAZING. WOW! Now I could never eat a bratwurst sandwich all on my own, but a couple of bites of that sandwich was pretty much like a little taste of heaven. The homemade curry will leave you craving it, it's the perfect blend of spices, incredibly tasty. The place is very clean, and the owner is very nice.

When I entered the former Del Taco location, I was greeted by a tall friendly German at the register.  I had a pretty good feeling about the authenticity of the food because the worker was speaking German to a few customers.  That's a key indicator for authenticity.  You don't see much Italian being spoken at Olive Garden, or many Spanish speaking customers at the Michoacan joints in Vegas.

I really had no idea what to choose until I saw the curry brat on the menu. 

From what the worker told me, the curry brat is the #1 fast food in Germany and was  this restaurant's specialty.  So I ordered one on his recommendation...

Pleasantly surprised!  The Curry Brat is a sliced bratwurst smothered with a ketchup based curry sauce and it's pretty damn good.  It's also served with a heaping mound of fries that were very good (similar to McDonald fries).  

Would I go back?   YES
