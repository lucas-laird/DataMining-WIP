It helps that it is close to my home. 
I've been ordering 2-3 of the ""Small Plates"" as. Meal. They're great!

Today I had the Street Corn Wheels. They flavorful with the cheese etc. 

The Spicy Buffalo Chicken Lollipops are good chunks of meat. The accompanying slaw was a good balance for the buffalo sauce. 

The Cast Iron Turkey meatballs are my favorite. They are super tasty. The marinara sauce 

House made Ginger Beer is really strong, almost too much. Get it only if you really like ginger.  

I've had many other things on their menu and all were good. I highly recommend this place.",oYSIPRrkMYD-O9J8jPLdRA,0,0,5,754rJY8kOJoXDd8q0QaAwA

Thankfully Jason knew how to take care of a table properly. The one star goes to him for his attempted recovery. I had explained to him it was my friends birthday and our terrible service was putting a damper on the day. He took care of my friends food & took the liberty of ordering our dessert. I thought for sure the worst had past, but our wonderful server kept the shit show going. She brought out my friends birthday dessert, candle in hand, she put the candle on top of the dessert and walked away without lighting it.

We went here for a birthday dinner a week ago and our experience was fantastic. The food was great and great in variety, the beer selection good, we had a good time. We had the hummus trio (The green hummus is awesome) The Cajun fries (OMG DELICIOUS! The portions are huge and so filling and so worth it!) We got the Black & Bleu Pizza and honestly it was one of the best I have had. Order it asap.

My reason for the lower rating is because we went again last night to try out their happy hour and were a little bit disappointed. This time we sat at the bar and again got Cajun fries (had to) and ordered the edamame (Amazing. The sauce is so good.) and the pear martini was delicious. The downside was being ignored almost blatantly. There was not many people sitting there at all and we were patient and excited to be there again and it was just poor service the entire time.

UPDATE:
We have been here several times and the disappointment mentioned above occurred on 3 different occasions where we noticed poor customer service and attitude in general. After speaking with the manager, every time we have been back we have had zero issue. We have gone back with different friends and everyone loves the place. I appreciate a place that recognizes a mistake and then works hard at it. Kudos! Also Olivia is the name of our wonderful waitress the first time and we got to see her again recently and told her how amazing she is. If you are in her section then you are lucky!

769686,2017-02-19,0,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"Very disappointed in our first experience at this restaurant. I worked in the restaurant business for years and know things can get crazy BUT we were extremely disappointed with the outcome. When we placed our order for our entrees they came out in a timely manner for 3/7 people in our party. When the pizza came out, we asked for no onions and we were told the pizza with out onions went to the wrong table so we waited. Then my moms food still hadn't come out as well as our friend who ordered a hamburger. After about 20 min and no manager stopping by we waited and waited. The pizza came out and then my moms food finally right. We also waited on some other food for my friends child they just forgot. The biggest complaint I have is that our friend waited 35 minutes for his burger to come out and yes I timed it. We were all finished eating by the time he got it. Clearly there is something wrong in my opinion when you wait that long for a meal your paying at a nice restaurant for and you get no response from a manager until your done eating. It completely ruined our experience there and when we were handed a 10 dollar gift card we then even more realized we won't be back to this restaurant in the future. The only reason I'm giving this this two stars is because our waiter was so nice and felt really bad but action should have been taken from the very beginning.",_XFMw1T6uUdi909zvuDf6g,1,0,2,H9GLsAc9Sy9GtSxv1G_UeQ

We saw our server once - when he took our order - He was clueless on gluten free options - When he was asked about one of the meals being gluten free his response was ""I don't know"" - Not ""let me find out.""

The food was cold when it came and the only other time we saw any other server was when one sped by our table and dropped the check off without breaking stride.  Not even a water refill. 

This was the first time in my life that I have not left a tip - Our usual tip is at least 25% of our bill - Again based off the other reviews my hope for this place is we caught it on a ""bad night.""

We got there about 7:45 and sat in the bar area to watch the game. About 20 minutes later, nobody had so much as said hello. I finally went and told the hostess. A few minutes later(after I watched the hostess talk to him) a charismatic guy came over and acted like he just happened to notice that we hadn't been helped (my hero...) 

Anyway, we ordered our drinks and food which were good and came out pretty quickly, but I had to wait an eternity to ask our dude for some BBQ sauce (which I needed btw due to the Lazy Dog using French's ketchup for some god forsaken reason-they're a mustard company, not a ketchup one,there is a difference-get Heinz) at which point, he suggested some tapatio crema, which sounded delicious, but I'll never know, as I honestly never spoke with the man again. 

After waiting an absurd amount of time, I flagged down another server and requested the box and a check, which she promptly returned with (too bad she wasn't our server). The guy that looked like a manager was milling around the whole time and seemed about as lost as Dorothy in Oz. 

I honestly have NEVER written a negative yelp review before, but this was quite possibly the worst service I have ever experienced. That being said, I really do like the food. The breakfast was good last time and the grilled cheese that o got tonight was phenomenal.

We knew it would be hot outside, as it is summer time in the desert! ;) But, we were determined to continue family night with our two golden retrievers. We love that the location is in Town Square and you can easily get to and park. I went inside to get us a table and within 30 seconds we were seated. The first server gave us our menu and took our beverage order and appetizer order. The Grizzly fries sounded delicious, and upon first bite - they were undercooked which was a bummer. The server came back and immediately she apologized and took them to get a new batch together. When she returned she said they had been taken it off the ticket for the mistake. Very nice of her to do, but that's not what I was expecting. Once our meals arrived, which I might add were delicious! Parmesan Chicken and Chicken Alfredo, the manager came out again after apologizing once and brought us a card to use for a dessert or appetizer the next time we are there. They didn't have to do that, but it made us feel appreciated as a customer! We will definitely be making this our family night dinner place. Thank you, Lazy Dog for taking care of us. P.S. Our dogs thank you as well. And for those of you who complain that they don't take care of your dogs, read the rules before you go.

early October. The weather was beautiful for
being outside on this evening so a place like
this is highly appreciated especially when 
you are on the road with your pooch. 
This location has a very nice large outdoor
patio that is well laid out.  An extremely 
dog friendly place with a doggie menu.
Morris ordered the grilled chicken breast
(without the rice) from the dog menu. 
I ordered the bison burger, medium rare
with a side of spinach. Also had an order
of the cajun fries which were a Yelp check
in promotion. 
The dog portion of chicken was enough for
Morris to get two meals out of it. Extremely
good value and generous for a doggie plate. 
I had a couple of Michelob Ultras which were
chilled but I like them a bit colder.
The bison burger had only caramelized onion
and bacon jam on it as I had requested. It was
cooked perfectly medium rare as requested 
and was a decent sized burger. The side of
sauteed spinach was really good too. 
The cajun fries were overcooked and I felt
that the seasoning was a bit disjointed. 
Our server was excellent except for charging 
for the fries, which she corrected. 
The menu offered a nice variety of choices and
overall it was a pretty decent chain restaurant. 
I appreciated that the restaurant has posted 
below their dog menu a set of patio rules 
for dog owners. These are all common sense 
but as someone who extensively travels with
Morris, I have found that there are some dog
owners that just don't get it. With that said... 
All the dogs there that night were well behaved.
Morris got to meet a couple of them. Worth
visiting again when I pass through again.",50FWKnraAhuX8DOQt2pHSg,0,0,3,2QGCu4YjMi-S7F48tPdJgw

Dropped into Lazy Dog yesterday (05/25/2017) to celebrate a promotion. I've been to this Lazy Dog once before, and the Summerlin location twice before. All three times previous, fantastic experiences. Five star experiences. I bring my (extremely well trained) German Shep/Lab mix who never barks, yelps, or lunges at others on the patio. Of those three previous occasions, there's only been one example of a poorly trained dog. A bark here and there, no biggie. But there was a dog at the Summerlin location that would just not quit it. And the server kindly let them know that if the dog didn't behave it would have to leave. Which is exactly what was written all over the menus and also on signs ""Avoid the three B's: Begging, Barking, and Biting"", and the website's Dog Policy. 

Last night, we arrived at approximately  6:30 pm. From that time through to 8:30 there were no less than 5-6 dogs CONSTANTLY barking. Yelping, screaming, constantly. No quit. Ever been to your local pound? It was like setting up a dinner table in the middle of it, and paying near strip prices for your drinks and food. Everyone with well behaved dogs, or with no dogs, were visibly annoyed by it. 

At the Town Square location, the reference to the ""Avoid the three B's"" is apparently gone entirely. I didn't see it anywhere on the new menus. Nothing posted on the walls outside or on placards. Nothing. 

The servers did absolutely nothing. I even asked one of the bussers: ""Don't you guys have a barking policy?"" and he openly laughed at my face and said no, we've never had a barking policy. They're dogs, they can bark as much as they want. Well, you may want to update your website to reflect that your patios are now meetups for untrained dogs. Because the ""Three B's"" is still posted under your dog policy. 

I will give the Summerlin location another shot, as they seem to care about following their company's posted policy. Not going to drop another $100 for a meal and drinks for two at the local animal shelter at Town Square, though.",B301ufnpl7TUsY0Im88qrg,0,0,2,HTVtYvlwzl7Gwe2PPdTCSA

We sat for about 7-10 minutes before our server showed up to ask for drinks, sat for another 7-10 minutes just to get water for my dog. We ordered our food, spinach dip for appetizer which came out fairly quick. The main course took 20 minutes to come out I ordered bison meatloaf and son had cheese pizza and fries, they brought my food out but not my son but our server did recognize this and offered him some complimentary fruit. Now I have a large retriever and he quickly ate his food so I ordered him more again it took forever to come out.

First our service ... The gentleman was super nice and asked if this was our first time which it was and explained everything about the restaurant and that's awesome but at the same time was a little to talkative! That's not a bad thing but when you are having a family meal could be a little to much ! He was very informative and attentive to our needs the entire time ! 

From what we got out of him was that the son of the owner of Mimi's was the one who owns Lazy Dog and everything is scratched made in house ! 

Now both my wife and I started with a beer sampler of their own craft beers , and I must saying they were all very good !! We also like the fact that you can actually bring your dogs with you and eat on the patio and they will bring out water and they have a doggy menu !! Pretty cool....

As far as the food was not as impressed . My son and I both ordered the Ahi sandwich which was good but not great ! My wife had a pizza and I must say very low level and bland !! The grizzly fries were not bad but very sweet !! I feel that to many restaurants try to get to creative with sauces and that can hurt you in a way ! That was the case with the Ahi tuna sandwich! There were two types of sauce the Wasabi Ranch which I liked and a sesame sauce that was over powering ! 

The sweet sauce took away from the fries and did not go over well with my son ! We will give another shot !!",O7t9GbtERsewRDS-t9cv5g,0,0,3,1Crb8wBc_eOpJ5errXnesA

Located in Town Square, you can't miss their location on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd & Sunset.  The abundant seating area as well as pet friendly patio is certainly welcoming. We were greeted and seated immediately for an early lunch.  The service from Colleen was great.  She gave us some great recommendations as well as stellar service during our visit.   

The husband and I split the Chile Verde Chicken Nachos and the Pot Roast Beef Dip Sandwich.   This was definitely plenty of food for the both of us.  The winner between these two were the nachos.  The chips were fresh and warm topped with tomatillo chicken, black beans, cheese, jalape√±os and tapatio crema sauce.  They were deliciously filling.  

Our beef dip sandwich however had too much horseradish. I felt like it was oozing out of the middle each time I took a bite.  It took away from the good beef flavor.  They should really put it on the side or at least lightly spread it.  I think they use a ladle for the horseradish.  Ugh.  But the cajun fries accompanying were good. I love the seasoning and generous amount.

Verdict: Beefy delicious! 
All Natural - 
Grass fed - 
Durham Ranch Farm -  great quality comes out of this farm

Appreciate it when someone knows what they are doing when it comes to making specialty meats. They made it perfect here. Texture and taste. Fresh toasted bun and their own version of bacon jam, I was one happy Shirley B! And for exceptional quality, it's surprisingly affordable at 11.95 that's including one side!

Restaurant is huge, lodge themed down to the servers in plaid or buffalo checked shirts.. NOTE TO SELF: don't wear my plaid shirt again here so customers won't keep flagging for me in the bar area.. lol

Patio dining area is dog friendly. So you people who are easily annoyed keep that in mind if you want to dine out there. There's even a waiver you have to sign saying you acknowledge this and withhold restaurant and dog owners not responsible for your dining experience.

Service was good. Everyone was friendly. Got seated right away, server was attentive, orders got to us promptly, but the busier the restaurant got, the less we saw our server. She didn't touch our table for another 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes to get our check. Other than that minor hiccup, everything went smoothly.

Even with the crowds, though, we didn't have to wait and the staff was doing a great job getting food out and people seated. 

My party had fish tacos and fish and chips and burgers, and I had the grilled chicken, and everyone LOVED their food. Oddly, though mine was the least complicated of the group, it took about 5-10 minutes longer to cook than everyone else's.

I went for happy hour one night with some buds and although the service was good and the restaurant was a nice place to hang out, it was missing something.  Maybe it was because it wasn't busy and didn't have enough energy, maybe it's because I didn't bring my dog, but it's probably most likely because the food was not on par.  
Don't get me wrong, some things were good (the sauce that was on the edamame is ridiculously good) but most were just ehh.  The burger was super plain, the sausage and spicy oil pizza was mostly bread, the free Cajun fries with Yelp check-in, although awesome bc free and a good portion, were pretty boring.  The buffalo cauliflower didn't have enough sauce.  I also found it off-putting that the size of the happy hour dishes were considerably smaller than if you were to order it normally.  The point of a happy hour is to get the same food and drinks for cheaper.  That being said, the drinks, although normal size, weren't even discounted that much...
I will say I was quite happy with their beer flight, both price and taste.  I am disappointed overall because they have a unique, extensive menu and it seemed like such a gimmick when I got there.  I do want to go back and try it when it isn't happy hour but it will probably be awhile before I do that.

We got the Cajun fries from the Yelp app, and they were served warm,  not hot. My wife got a Cobb salad and had asked for bacon and dressing on the side.  She got neither.

I would use a 1/4 of a bottle of dressing on a salad that size. I got the chicken pot pie for 13 bucks. It looks nice,  but it was a Shepard's pie inside.

Not easy for wheelchairs.  Best to park in back parking lot, which gives you access to the sidewalk leading to the front door.  
Most foot traffic coming from parking area would not use the sidewalk, thus are forced to walk up about ten stairs to front entrance.  I wonder what the designers were thinking:  ""We'll put the parking area here and the main entrance up this flight of stairs""?
It was raining when we went, which made it a little more inconvenient.

We had a burger and an entree portion of the ancient grains/Kale salad. Only thing I could mention was that the fries tasted like they had been fried in oil that was also used to fry fish.

She explained that they were complimentary-as a ""thank you"" for coming in. Although my husband and I appreciated the gesture, we're not potato chip fans. We politely asked our regular server to take them back. She seemed very irritated and frustrated at this request stating; ""well now we'll just have to throw them out"". Finally, our food arrived but was less than impressive (as previously stated). Our server kept our drinks refilled, but somehow refilled my husband's plane iced tea with some kind of sweet tea.

The worst part is that the meals looked and tasted really good. They were cold, but very good flavors. The manager and waiter acknowledged the delay and apologized and tried to make things better by deducting some meals and apologizing for the mess.

We sat down and waited a few moments before our waitress told us that she'd be right with us. A few moments later she came and asked if we were ready to order our food and for our drink orders. 

My boyfriend ordered the Black & Bleu Burger with fries and also a side salad, they give you an option of what type of salad you want. Boyfriend chose baby greens with ranch. He thought the blacken seasoning was a little salty, I thought the bleu cheese was overwhelming but he liked that part. The fries were just horrible.

I ordered the Ginger Soy Salmon and a cup of Chicken Tortilla Soup. The soup was good. The glaze on the salmon was super salty, I flipped the salmon over to eat it and left the top that was drenched in glaze. The brown rice was good but of course, the stir fry veggies were super salty, too since it had the same glaze all over it.

2923357,2017-10-13,1,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"Granted, I had just spend 3 days in the backcountry eating freeze-dried meals before coming here, but man did their pot roast hit the spot. We were staying at a hotel by the airport and were looking for a restaurant that was more affordable than what we'd find on the strip, but didn't want to be eating at an Olive Garden.

I was very impressed by Lazy Dog. The decor feels like Yardhouse or Brick House (both large chains) but instead of a beer/sports vibe, it has a dog/sports theme. How could you not love the various forms of dog art on the walls. The whole dog theme seems a little odd, but if I lived in Vegas and could bring my dog to dinner, you'd bet I'd be here once a week.

Now for the important part....the food. With a large variety of options, you'll be hard pressed to find something you don't like on the menu. I indulged in the Campfire Pot Roast (I had just burned a ton of calories hiking, I'll eat what I want!!!), while my table mates chose the Pork Shoulder and Ahi Tuna. All of us were very pleased with the entrees and the assortment of sides that each meal came with were also pretty bomb. Considering this is Vegas where everything costs a portion of a mortgage payment, not only were these meals delicious but they have very hearty servings at an affordable price.

Pros:
-Clean, modern atmosphere
-Food that hits the spot without denting your wallet
-Service was fantastic and very attentive
-Large array of choices

Cons:
-Better food options in Vegas, but at a significantly higher price bracket
-Even though I liked it, you can't help but feel you're in a chain restaurant (which it is)
-My food came out luke warm, but my friend's meals were fine (they did replace my meal with a new plate that came back hot, so while I'd mark it as a minor negative, they made it right with me",Qz7uckzGIUOemeFTXnZrWA,2,1,4,1phvKtqghllq9Ay_J74nQA

Service was unbelievably bad... and we are certainly not the type of people to complain, given the fact that we spent a huge part of our day there just waiting for our food. About an hour after placing our order, we were wondering what on earth was going on. Our waiter finally came over and said he had ""no idea"" what happened with our food. He gave us each a bowl of soup for free, which was nice. But it was still another 30 minutes before our food got to our table. The food was piping hot, so I am guessing the whole order had just been forgotten or the order was misplaced, so then they hurried and made it. But nobody ever came over to explain that there was an issue. they literally just let us sit there for hours and did not care to inform us of any problems.

I am vegan but nothing was obviously vegan on the menu (think hidden ingredients). I asked the server about the teriyaki rice, veggie and tofu bowl. The tofu is normally dipped in egg or some other animal product but she checked for me (so nice!) and they could make it without that. Sold!

The menu is really cool, i loved the design and artwork on it. And the whole menu looked delicious, i wanted to try everything and i had a really hard time deciding what to order. Because i checked in on Yelp, we got a free order of cajun fries (which were really good). I ended up ordering the French Dip sandwich (it was delicious) and my man had the BBQ Bison Meatloaf (which was also pretty incredible).

OH and here's a little tip, they have a DOG MENU!!!! You are allowed to bring your dog if you sit on the patio and you can actually order dinner for your dog! How cool is that?!?! I mean it's genius! 

Our waiter, Jacob was so nice and knew a lot about the menu and the whole idea behind the restaurant, where they opened, how many locations and where they are located. He made sure to give us plenty of suggestions (at our request) and made sure to inform us that pretty much everything is made from scratch (which is also pretty amazing). Jacob was awesome!!!! And there was another gentleman who cleared our table and started chatting me up about the dog theme and then we started discussing our dogs and showing each other pictures of our dog babies. I mean, dogs bring people together! I love it! I will say that everyone that i encountered during my lunch here was SO friendly and had a great attitude!

We have gone to Lazy Dog twice now. The first time we were able to make it in time for happy hour, which has great drink and small plate deals! The first time we had the ahi poke jars, and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was really tasty. It had something on it that had a bit of a bite to it! The ahi poke jars were ok. If you are really into ahi poke this would likely not cut it for you. We both found the flavor to be underwhelming. 

On our second visit we missed happy hour so we ordered off the regular menu. I had the mahi mahi tacos, and sampled some of my colleague's brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were out of this world! They are rich so eating a whole order of them to yourself might take a lot. But I am sure that those around you would love to help you eat them. The mahi mahi tacos were disappointing. The fish was dry (overcooked) and bland. I would not order these again. Overall, I think that things are hit and miss here.

I ordered the onion ring poutine off the appetizer menu while my wife ordered the pork noodle bowl off the lunch menu and both items were right at $10.00!

3482825,2017-03-12,0,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"Lazy Dog is a ""jack of all trades"" type of restaurant. The menu has a lot of variety, and out of the several dishes that I've had, everything has been delicious. My favorite is the Idaho Trout, as the way it's prepared is exquisite. Some of my other recommendations would be the Lamb Shank (although this is seasonal, so keep that in mind), and the Prime Rib French Dip. The French Dip isn't as good as the one at Nordstrom Cafe (see my review), but it's still a satisfying sandwich for any meal of the day. 

One area where Lazy Dog can improve is their service. On multiple occasions, both busy and slow, it seemed like the wait staff would take an exceptionally long time to cycle around to our table. I can understand when it's packed on a Friday night, but when the places is practically deserted, I just found it a bit odd. There was one instance where we had to call over our waiter three separate times to refill the water cups on our table. Mind you, this was an instance where it wasn't very crowded. 

Overall, the food is what makes Lazy Dog a nice meal spot. If the food weren't so good, I probably would give Lazy Dog 3 stars due to the service, but the food is truly that enticing.

It wasn't busy when we went and even when I went inside, it wasn't terribly busy either. Anyways, we ordered the Idaho trout, Cajun fries, turkey meatballs, ahi poke jar and a chicken bowl for my pup. 

Our server was very slow and inattentive. It seemed like he forgot about us because we were in the patio. A lot of the other staff was more helpful to us than he was.  The manager (I think or supervisor or whoever) ended up helping us more. 

Onto the food:
* Idaho trout - It was just okay. My mom says it was too oily for her and I thought it wasn't worth the money. The menu says that it is $16.75 but they charged us $17.50 for it. At that point we were too annoyed and wanted to leave so we didn't say anything. (2/5) 
* Cajun fries - They were delicious and the sauce it comes with is really good. It's $3 on the happy hour menu but free when you check in so it's worth trying (5/5)
* Turkey meatballs - These were a lot better than I anticipated. Great happy hour option (5/5)
* Ahi poke jar - The concept is cute but this was a miss for me. The happy hour price of this was $8 which I thought was expensive. They give you a tiny little jar with a small layer of ahi on top. I would rather pay $8 somewhere else and get an entire poke bowl. The actual food wasn't terrible, just the pricing. (3/5)

All in all, this place is a solid 3 out of 5 stars because their food is decent. The only thing that stood out to me was the idea of having lunch with your dog but the service was not great, so I probably won't be coming back.",3mfYOXGi98d_heab6KZLtA,2,1,3,Ug-vyzIePgmLuYRJjamvpQ

Our toy Chihuahua would much rather go with us than be left behind in a strange motel room smelling of Fabreze. The dog-friendly filter for Las Vegas yielded a few places that looked like they might work for both humans and dogs.

Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar fit the bill. We went here for brunch after church and were promptly ushered to a comfortable, covered outdoor patio. What first struck me was the dog-friendly section was packed while the indoor tables were sparely populated. This place is a magnet for dog owners. Everybody seemed to get along. The owners wisely figured out that packing dogs too closely together could lead to territorial disputes.

We ordered a delicious hummus appetizer and the sunny side up pizza. Our dog slept through the hummus plate but woke up when the pizza arrived sprinkled with bits of bacon. I got through two slices before she wormed out of the shoulder bag carrier and had her paws on the table. I gave her a dish with some egg yolk, bacon sprinkles, and a bit of pizza crust. She was happy, I was happy and relaxed. I had ordered the beer sampler (they make their own) which I highly recommend.

Bugsy is a refined gentleman, who is accustomed to sitting on a chair next to mine or laying in my lap. We were told that due to health department regulations, he would have to sit on the ground. (We often dine out with him and this has never been an issue for us before.) Being a calm and sensitive rescue dog, the loud planes flying over head, constant stream of strangers stepping right next to him as they walked by and large dogs at nearby tables barking, he was very anxious, a little scared at times, and did not enjoy himself.

Bugsy really enjoyed his lunch from the dog menu, which consisted of chopped grilled chicken breast and brown rice. He was not given a water bowl, our waitress forgot his beverage. His face was covered in rice, and we were not given a napkin for him.

We really enjoyed the hummus plate and Cajun fries. My husband remarked that Bugsy had a better lunch than he did. He ordered a chicken and brown rice dish, his chicken had some chewy bites in it, but he choked it down. I ordered the cob salad, the lettuce was wilted and doused in a ton of dressing and the chicken also had chewy bites. The quality of the poultry is questionable and I was a little skeeved out by it. We were not offered drink refills.

The patio has a great atmosphere with a fire pit in the center. There were many beautiful dogs of all sizes, including a young Rottweiler and a wrinkly neopolitan mastiff puppy dining nearby, they were precious.

He was very friendly and very knowledgable about the restaurant and the items on menu.  He suggested certain items for us to try so we did and they were delicious. 
He is a very hard worker, very friendly. The service he gives is actually one of the best I've had.   The restaurant has a bar & tables outside and you can even bring your dog.  They have a menu just for your pet.  Food was all made from scratch,  wide selection from appetizers to deserts.   I'll definitely be back for his service & some delicious food & beverages when he works.",-OwCeB6zVq-5-n3Oq6DuNg,1,1,5,2hmV41olv6nqLWDJEyxZZQ

We got FREE Cajun fries (which was huge by the way) for checking in on yelp. 
I had the pot roast beef sandwich with street potato tots and it was really good. The bread on the sandwich was seriously delicious. My husband had the chicken curry with carrot slaw and he said it was awesome. We were so excited to eat our food that we forgot to take a pic for yelp... I guess we will have to come back!

3813346,2016-12-05,8,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"It was another guys night out with fellow Baristas. We have been talking about it for quite some time and decided to try it out. I personally knew about it but never got the chance to try it out even though their first Vegas location in Downtown Summerlin is much closer to my house.

Upon entering, the first impression was the similarities with Yard House and Claim Jumper with a rustic log cabin setting. A cool thing about Lazy Dog is the seating arrangement, makes it ideal for large groups. We had the pleasure of being served by Heather. She was very engaging and service was on point. The food was not mind blowing but good comfort food. A good option for a large group since there is good variety of food, from Italian to Asian dishes to please everyone.

For starters, we got the Cajun Fries. It was good just a tad bit on the salty side but the Chipotle Ranch dipping sauce was pretty good. Another appetizer we got was the Ahi Poke Jar, which was by far the dish we enjoyed the most. The fresh Ahi Tuna was balanced and flavorful with peanut like dressing and paired with crispy wonton chips was a cool concept from your usual spinach artichoke dishes at other chain restaraunts. A few of us got pastas, one got an Asian dish and myself went for the Sriracha Chicken Sandwich. We enjoyed everything including the fact we had a few drinks and shots with our meals to De-Stress from a week of working. 

Overall we had a great time. A cool place to hangout with friends. There is a saying that it's always about, ""Timing."" A cool thing happen on this particular night 12.4.16, when our group was included in a company wide mannequin challenge, which we all decided to hop on and was added to the video shoot. We were able to view the video and was told that it will be posted on Lazy Dog social media platform.

    Arrived at 5pm. Place was empty. Usually a warning sign for somewhere brand spankin' new. But I've had Lazy Dog in Cali twice and it's always been decent. So let's begin the hostess was great. Very friendly, robotic nature, cool it's expected in these kind of establishments (aka Chains). 
    We have a party of four and get sat at a booth (my preferred seating for 4 or more) great! Then our server comes by and she's happy well presented and friendly. My dad didn't really know what to order and she gave a load of great options. My dad took her advice on the Carne Asada. And he said it was good. All the food was good and nothing was bad by all means. But nothing was a ""Wow effect"" either. Good food for a god price. The dessert was awesome. We got the Warm Apple Crumble with ice cream. FLAME!
OVERALL: 3.5/5

Cons/Things I noticed:
- the table had crumbs on it when we sat down. Hostess scooped it quickly 
- someone else's food got dropped at our table but our sever came by quickly and said NO! Wrong table! 
- The plates they gave us for appetizers were very spotty and smudgy 
- they were out of big container to go boxes

The service here is always superb with some of the best bartenders in the valley. The drinks that they service always are too shelf and they are strong too. The server pointed the way to the bar and I seated myself there. The decor in the restaurant is so relaxing but upscale. The bartender came over right away and left the menu and took my drink order. The ordering process was excellent with no issues. The food came real quick too.

I absolutely love their menu here with so many different offerings it is the comfort foods that win here. Sitting in the bar area is very comfortable and the music selections that they play soothe any fire that one might have. It gets replaced with relaxing music and surroundings. It's a great place to eat and really enjoy the experience of the food in an excellent atmosphere.

I ordered the pink lemon drop martini who ever thought that pink lemons could taste so sweet. The Yelp check in I took advantage of as well. Thanks Lazy Dog for the Cajun boost with ranch.

4285813,2017-06-29,7,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"LAZY DOG DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PETS. 
They put onions in my friends dog dish and placed it on the patio floor. 
I did not order food for my dog. Only a water bowl. 

Onions contain an ingredient called thiosulphate which is toxic to cats and dogs. The ingestion of onions causes a condition called hemolytic anemia, which is characterized by damage to the red blood cells. Onion toxicity can cause the red blood cells circulating through your pet's body to burst.

Symptoms of this condition include breathlessness, lethargy, diarrhea and vomiting. 

Lazy dog did not research what can harm and possibly kill dogs before deciding to serve them - their management, kitchen and servers were NOT trained. 

Catching up with my friend over dinner - I look down and discover my dog is not drinking his water from his water bowl but instead in my friends dog food bowl which was pushed over to my side of the table by her dog. I keep my dog on a half length leash so he can't wander all over. 

I initially freak out - then rationalize and think ""well ok lazy dog wouldn't put anything in the dog bowl that could hurt them. It is a dog friendly restaurant"" 
I stated I do not feed my dog human food. 
This does not mean ""I was cool with it"" or didn't do anything to stop it."" 

Lazy dog has chosen to misinterpret my words into saying ""I was cool with it and gave him permission to eat the food"" I never verbally said I was ok with him eating the food. It simply meant I wasn't going to let it ruin my dinner and become angry. I explicitly did not willingly allow my dog to eat out of the bowl with my knowledge. In fact my friends dog was growling at my dog for even being near his bowl. 

My dog reacted severely shortly after and rushed him to the dog hospital. He couldn't breathe and was struggling to vomit. I notified a small piece of clear onion in his vomit. As a result of onion toxicity reaction - he aspirated when trying to vomit. This means vomit got in his lungs and would cause pneumonia. He was in the emergency room for 24 hours on IV antibiotics. 

The female manager was rude and did not care when I asked what they put in the dog food bowl. She showed zero empathy when I stated my dog couldn't breathe as I was rushing him to the er. I needed what ingredients were in the bowl to report to my vet ASAP upon arrival. Per their manager ""we will feed your dogs whatever"" 

Lazy dog did not show any empathy or concern over my dogs health. They did not call the next day to see if he made if through the night. 

Lazy dog then sends us to their claims adjuster from Argo group. 
To proceed with the process he states a recorded interview must take place. 

Their claims adjuster interpreted my words as ""I was cool with it! I have your recorded interview!"" Raised his voice with me, and stated I acted negligently and he would of done anything to protect his dogs implying I am a bad dog owner. 

I expressed my concerns to the claims adjuster the fact that their grills, prepping, and other cooking surfaces could be cross contaminated with several food items harmful to dogs given there was no knowledge or training. 

I asked ""how do consumers know the burgers for dogs are not grilled on the same surface as onions or garlic. How do consumers know there is not onion powder in the burgers you serve to dogs"" 

I expressed I wrote in to lazy dog corporate office one more time as I was disappointed to say the least and their claims adjuster exclaimed ""you will not be hearing from them! I am speaking on their behalf!"" I stated I didn't think I was asking for much to speak with them. 

Lazy dog chose to hide behind their claims adjuster who raised his voice at me, misinterpreted my interview, put words in my mouth, and acted aggressively in our conversations when I tried to make sure other dogs would not be harmed in the future. 

Joel acknowledged the staff was not trained. 

I secret shopped their location in summerlin 2 months after the fact and the waiters still were not trained as to what is toxic for dogs when I inquired. 

This incident took place in april. I secret shopped in may. It is now end of June. I have been biting my tongue patiently before writing this post to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. 

I have given lazy dog every opportunity to act with integrity and do the right thing. 

Technical legalities aside - I am NOT looking to sue for emotional distress or bank any extra cash. I am looking for my full vet bills to be compensated and a simple apology. Lazy dog is not capable of this. 

Lazy dog offered $1000 which does not cover all my vet bills in exchange for signing a contract to silence me and not allow me to speak about this incident with anyone. 

They covered my friends vet bills in full who ordered the dog food. 

I am not biting my tongue anymore.

Me: Yeah buddy! Let's go out and grab a few bites! How about that!
Dog: Yeah i'm down!
Me: What did you say?
Dog: :x

There is a restaurant where you can enjoy a few drinks and bites while your k9 companion can enjoy some food too! Talk about a cute place to hangout after the dog park with your friends.

Setting: It is in townsquare right by Las Vegas BLVD near the Flemings and Bonefish. The place is hugeeee and the patio area for the dogs is well spaced out. Right when you walk in, it smells like a new home had been built since it's only been open for.... 10 days but as long as it doesn't smell like dog i'll come back.

Drinks: Pretty standard choices for drinks and a happy hour! We went on Wednesday and HH was 9pm-Close. Some bites from $4 to $8. Bud light/coors light $3 for a 16oz and $1 drafts. 

Food: We got the poke jar which made my hawaiian native friend spin. It was a jar with sour cream, guacamole, bits of tuna on the top so a little texmex/hawaiian fusion going on. It actually wasn't that bad! Check in on yelp for free cajun fries that are served in a huge bag! The burger was $5 for HH but the patty meat was soooo thin.

Service: The gentleman that served us in the patio was fantastic! I can't remember his name but he was much better than the first server we started out with. He accommodated the friends that came in two by two and split the bill with no trouble. He was thin, tall and had some hair on his face. 

Overall: A cool spot for dog lovers and friends to come hangout. I can't say their happy hour beats brios but it was okay.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,6,7,3,dxQWOW6SI1xh_eo9luCIew

The location is large and easy to access. It's situated between Fleming's and Texas de Brazil in the Town Square shopping center. There is plenty of parking in front of and near the restaurant.

The service was great the night our group ate here. Even with about a dozen diners the service was attentive and quick. Drink orders were taken as each of us arrived and water glasses were constantly refilled. Our salads came out quickly and meals followed soon after.

I started with a Wedge Salad which was delicious. The portion was generous as well. There was plenty of bacon, blue cheese crumbles, onion, and tomatoes. For my entr√©e I had the Chicken Pot Pie.

Our server, I do not know his name, was super attentive and friendly.  Kudos on that.  Our food came out relatively fast too, so that was good.

4447912,2017-11-10,4,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"Lazy Dog in my opinion is totally underrated. Next to Brio, this is another favorite Happy Hour gem in Town Square! 

It's pretty cool that you can bring your dog here. There's an outside patio where you can be seated with your dog. I came with a friend once and he ordered a grilled chicken and white rice platter for his pup! 

Why I REALLY enjoy Lazy Dog is for their Happy Hour: 
- Mon - Fri, 3P - 6P and Sun - Thurs, 9P - Close
- A large selection of tasty apps ranging only from $3 - $8
- Drink specials from $3 - $6 (beer, wells, sangria, wine, martinis, etc) and a beer/shot combo for $4

My app recommendations: 

- Togarashi Edamame 
I order this every time I'm at Lazy Dog and to be completely honest every order has tasted different. The taste definitely isn't consistent but I don't mind because it always tastes good! I would best describe it as edamame wok fried/tossed in a special spicy sauce (maybe different chefs?)

- The Dirty Dog 
Portion is for one person - it's about a half of a Nathan's hot dog wrapped in bacon and served on a Hawaiian bun. The hot dog is topped with slaw, chips, and drizzled with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce! Super messy but also super delicious 

- Buffalo Chicken Lollipops
Small 4 piece naked tenders baked in spicy buffalo tossed served on a bed of coleslaw. Tastes great! Very small serving size though

I've also tried the below apps:

- Chicken Wings
Around 8 or so traditional wings tossed in a sweet/tangy buffalo sauce - served with a few pieces of celery and carrots with bleu cheese for dipping. Not your typical buffalo sauce yet still enjoyable 

- Chicken Lettuce Wraps
Tastes like average chicken lettuce wrap. Stir fried diced chicken and veggies served with lettuce, a tangy peanutty teriyaki sauce, and a side of cucumber salad 

- Atomic Fried Rice
Similar to the edamame - the taste is never consistent. The only difference in comparison is that out of my two times trying, the first time it actually tasted good and the second was completely bland. Large portion of rice stir fried with diced kimchi and topped with a fried egg and seaweed seasoning. Not exactly authentic tasting but it really didn't taste bad the first time!

- Wok-Fried Calamari
Not your typical calamari - basically large pieces of squid are battered and doused in a sweet and sour sauce and served on a bed of rice. Literally like orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken except it's squid, not chicken. Pleasantly surprised by the taste!

- Waffle Cut Parmesan Chips
Fresh, crunchy, house made chips. Simple yet tasty choice to snack on 

- Grilled Garlic Flatbread
Bread baked with garlic seasoning and cheese served with a side of marinara. Pretty decent app 

My friends really like the beer/shot combo since draft beer plus a shot of your choice of Jameson, Jack, or Milagros for $4 is a total steal. I personally like the beer here - there's a few Lazy Dog original beers on draft.

Don't forget to check in for a complimentary order of Cajun fries! It comes with a chipotle ranch aioli for dipping and the portion is the perfect size to share with a group. 
 
I've tried a few of their main entrees and wasn't ""wowed"" (besides their Brussel Sprouts which are crispy, charred, and amazing) but I definitely keep coming back for their happy hour specials.

This location is barely a month old, but of course is a carbon copy of the other venue, along with the freezing indoor temperature.  That's my main gripe.  But I dressed warmly in anticipation, and I wasn't disappointed.

Our friends ordered the ahi tuna and trout entrees.  The ahi was a beautiful presentation, and my friend thought it was a bigger piece of fish than what she usually is served at other places.  The trout was plain, but that's how she ordered it.  They both enjoyed their dishes.

The hubby and I had a coupon for our anniversary for a starter or dessert, so we ordered the chicken nachos.  It seemed even bigger than usual, and was even spicier than what we customarily get.  No complaints there.  We had also ordered a Thai chicken salad to share.  Normally, the nachos are more than enough for the two of us, but we figured everyone would be digging into the nachos.  Wrong!  Neither of them eats anything spicy (that's the E. Coast for you :).  But we didn't know that before we ordered a Thai Chicken Salad to share, so we ended up with an overabundance of food.

The kitchen took care of splitting the salad for us.  That was the good part.  The bad was that it was weird.  Terrible?  Not totally.  But there were no greens, and it seemed to be just chicken over coleslaw.  Or maybe all that white stuff wasn't cabbage.  There may have been peanuts, but if so, they were so chopped up we couldn't even tell.  We've had Thai chicken salad everywhere, and have never experienced anything like this.  We were extremely disappointed, and would never order this dish again.

Our waiter, Mason, was engaging and cute, even after we determined that yes, he had voted, but for the wrong party.  I can't help myself, I'm obsessed with asking.  And no, we didn't stiff him.

Despite our unfortunate salad, Lazy Dog is a good, solid addition to the expanding restaurant scene at Town Sq.  They just need to turn up the heat.  And I don't mean the jalape√±os.  They gave us plenty of those!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,8,4,uQwWb55IgdbQjtScTTY5fg

First time visiting was for a friend's birthday dinner. I got the pasta Carbonara. It was a pretty good portion, however, I thought that it was too salty. My friend, who had ordered the mushroom pizza thought hers was pretty salty, too.

I did like the fact that if you checked in to the restaurant you get a free appetizer, so we got a basket of their really good basket of fries.

The place was packed, considering we did dine in on a Friday evening; however, the service took a very long time. The waitress did not check in on our table enough, and we were a pretty big group. Also, since we could not get a hold of our server, it took an even longer time to get our checks.

They have a new cute menu! I don't think they have any new food items added but just made it more aesthetically pleasing. We ordered from the lunch menu, which is served daily til 4 PM. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my friend ordered the fish & chips. If you check in on Yelp, they provide you with a big order of cajun fries. The fries came out first & they kinda overdid it with the seasoning lol. It was a little like Cajun seasoning with a side of fries. It wasn't bad though. Our food came out maybe 10 mins after the fries did. The shrimp tacos were alright. The plate came with 2 tacos, rice, and beans. The taco was really messy to eat since it only came with one really skinny tortilla so it ripped easily & everything came out lol. I do like that they don't skimp out on shrimp. 

Service was alright. I don't quite remember our server's name but he did a fine job.

I'm not really sure how you would classify this restaurant, it feels kinda modern, hippy, with a bit of lumber jack ( weird I know ) . 

We walked right in and were instantly seated and given a brief run through of the menu. They have a decent selection of what I would call American food ( a little bit of everything). They have a large selection of beer and drinks , they make a variety of their own brews ( I stuck with the norm good old fashion Budlight) I did like the large portion size for the beer. 
The food, I went with one of my favorite dishes (fish and chips) and to me it was average, not very seasoned, good portion size , liked the fries, but not as good as I had hoped. My friend got a spicy Mexican style chicken sandwich, she was not a fan and actually returned it after finding it had dark meat ( we double checked the menu it does not indicate it will be dark meat chicken). My wife got a bbq ranch bacon burger she was quite happy and really enjoyed it.

Desert for me was the vest part,  I had the warm peach crumble, it was very good, tasted and smelled just like good old Midwest grandma made cobbler.  The wife had a nice chocolate cacke with ice cream. 

So all in all its an ok spot good for an average meal, the atmosphere and ability to chat and eat with no rush or over whelming staff is its biggest plus. Down side the food is ok its worth the money but not the driving factor in attending.",LrKg5LXV2ZUu0GEddeD0zQ,1,0,4,iBaYP9SowNFtd21n-Y1zsQ

The children's menu had the normal offerings and a few extras. My son opted for a burger and fries. He had no complaints. 
My husband ordered the curried tuna which was served over a mashed cauliflower. The cauliflower was so creamy one would think it was potatoes. The tuna was prepared exactly how it was ordered which is nice.

We ordered the Queso appetizer. It had some nice spice from the jalape√±os and chipotle. The cheese flavor was nice and bold. My issue with the dish we're the chips. They house made but they were underdone. That made them chewy and tough. The few that were golden brown were good, but they were few and far between. 

I got the Fried Chicken Sandwich. The meat was good, maybe just a little too thick for the sandwich. The brioche bun was fresh and flavorful but a bit too big. I thought the bread to sandwich ratio was too high. Nice spice from the fiery carrot slaw and jalape√±os. Just really big and a bit tough to eat.",y4O_c6UUAAtPb3Uk-T4t8A,0,0,3,EaeLNknrHMZBvxGZXmTZgQ

5181280,2018-02-13,1,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"This is the worst place I've ever dined at. I am not one to assume someone is being racist or profiling, but based on all of the information at hand -- that was the case today. 

I came in for a quick lunch after an appointment at PROJECT (tradeshow at Mandalay Bay five minutes away) based off of a coworker's suggestion. So I always have to give props where they are due -- the host was very nice and friendly. She seated me and made genuine small talk. After that, it all went to hell. 

I sat for 10 minutes and had to flag someone down to take my order. Please keep in mind it's the afternoon and not busy at all. Then I was told my server was training someone -- ok, great? But I still need service. So I tell the gentleman I flag down I'm ready to place my order and he says he can only write it down and pass it to my ""actual"" server -- Candace. So I see him walk over to Candace to hand her my order, he points to me (as he should so she can know where her customer is) and she makes a face of annoyance. At this point, she still hasn't come over to talk to me and I see her being friendly to everyone else in the section except for me. 

My drink finally comes over, and it's the server shadowing her who brings it over. Then my food comes out, the guy just drops it off and goes. It's actually the wrong bowl, but with how service has been -- I won't send it back and I'm hungry. So I start eating the food, it's of course not good. Candace (my actual server) still hasn't come by to ask how's it going, is the food good, nothing at all! 

At this point, I'm ready to go and flag down the server in training to grab me my check. She has to ask Candace to print the check. Finally! Candace walks over to my table. And she doesn't say hi, bye, cat, dog, how was it?....not a word. She simply drops it and goes. It's at this point where I'm fed up and can tell she has something against me and we've never met, so it must be that she has profiled me as a black woman and thinks something ignorant like I won't tip her -- so why do her actual job. So mean and cruel in 2018. 

I ask the server in training can I speak to someone. She brings over the manager, Jose. He is actually nice and even says he understands. Because he too is a person of color. He asks to take care of the meal. But I let him know it's not about the money, it's about the treatment. Regardless, I would've paid and tipped. It was actually a work lunch I could've expensed it and her tip was guaranteed. Even if it weren't a work lunch, I would've still tipped her. So to treat me in such a poor manner because of blatant profiling was sad more than anything else. 

It is 2018 Candace, don't be racist. It's not nice. You shouldn't treat people differently than everyone else because of their skin color or preconceived notions. There is no reason for that. 

Even though you were rude to me, I hope the Universe touches your mean spirit and allows you to be a better person. The year just started, you have time.",tAKRkqi5Goy7CC6EIdtUXw,4,0,1,RjIhUwgaOWeJNPo0_pwxQA

I've eaten here twice and still the same horrible service. Such a great place with such GREAT FOOD but service/training is lacking.

I took my dog with me to go eat, hearing that they serve food for dogs as well. But I had to wait a good 15 minutes just to be asked for drinks. With that time I already knew what to order. I ordered the chicken Alfredo and chicken with rice for my dog. The food came out Perfect, I just needed something to drink when they gave me the food. I had to ask three times just to get water during my meal,and the moment I got water was when i was getting ready to head out; Meal done,bill payed for and signed.
On top of that there was a big misunderstanding with other tables getting wrong checks (easily could of been a train wreck if those checks were charged wrong).
Also, I believe more attention should be given to the patio.

CAJUN FRIES: they were very good the seasoning was a bit much nut the flavor was there and the dipping sauce was a good match!

TORTILLA SOUP: This was surprisingly one of my favorite soups that I've had in a while, it had lots of flavor really enjoyable!

MY MEAL CHICKEN PARM WITH NOODLES (Don't know actual name sorry): I don't have any thing bad to say because I actually enjoyed this dish but it wasn't something I'd order again.

We arrived around nine in the evening on a Thursday and the restaurant was lively! Not packed but not uncomfortably empty either. There's happy hour if you sit on the patio (WHERE DOGS ARE ALLOWED) or bar area at designated times. We ordered primarily from the happy hour menu which included hush puppies, macaroni and cheese, buffalo chicken lollipops, and turkey meatballs. In addition, my friend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of cajun fries. Everything was a decent portion and satisfied our stomachs. We also ordered banana pudding for dessert and a white chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream to share. Despite the meal being on point, our server made the experience 10/10! Dominic was knowledgeable and honest about the menu items, giving us recommendations and letting us know that there was bleu cheese in certain dishes (since not many people are a fan).

My friends and I were looking forward to their cocktails- I ordered the pineapple mojito, and my friends ordered the white peach sangria. Our waitress was wonderful, I wish I remembered her name, and she asked us what we should take as recommendations, after we had given her an idea of what we wanted to drink. The menu itself was good- enough choices without being overwhelming, but the combinations were very different. I'm all about fusions, but it made it very perplexing to find what we wanted to eat. Again, our waitress came to the rescue. She recommended the fish and chips (perfectly moist, not greasy, and very flaky) my friend ordered the California burger (she said it was good, but nothing special) and my other friend ordered the ahi tuna salad (light flavorful, and the fish was lovely seared).

Right out of the gate, the whole staff made us feel extremely comfortable.  We felt awkward and just wanted to make sure the pups were out of the way. Everyone assured us that we were fine and they totally didn't care that we kept switching tables. They told us they wanted whatever was best for us and the fur babies even if it meant bouncing around.

Our server was great and brought us some complimentary waffle chips since we said it was our first time. Also, if you check in on yelp you get complimentary fries. We didn't take advantage of that since we were already getting fries with our meals. We both ordered a breakfast burger which was tasty and got the job done. They also have lots of drink specials they offer for their Sunday brunch. It was a nice touch as well that the manager came by a few times to check on us.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the location. Don't get me wrong. I personally LOVE Town Square. However, our big 80 pound pit was scared to death since it is right in the flight path to the airport and extremely loud for his sensitive ears. Poor guy was trembling and we realized how scared he was when he refused to eat the burger and brown rice we got for him. Luckily our other buddy is deaf and wasn't phased at all. So needless to say, instead of the nice leisurely brunch we were hoping for, we had to put a little extra wiggle in it and get Mr. Scaredy-Pants our if there. The good thing is they have another location in Summerlin that is hopefully much quieter.

It has a ton of different types of food so you are sure to find something you're in the mood for. Most restaurants usually suck at some different types of cuisines but this place has nailed them all down. I have yet to try something I have not liked. 

Before we get into the specifics of food, let's go over the ambience. It's really cool and rustic with a cabin feel. It's pretty big and there's a big bar in the center. 

For my drink I tried the sangria sampler and Oh. My. God. It was amazing. I slurped those things down like there was no tomorrow. I highly recommend them. I love all three flavors. I also ended my night with a snow cap that was pretty good! I'm generally not a huge fan of night caps but this one hit the spot in all the right ways. 

Food time. I ordered the pot roast beef tip and holy crap it was the best thing I've ever tasted. It comes with crispy fries, broth for dipping, and a delicious roast beef sandwich with melted cheese and caramelized onions. By far the best roast beef sandwich in town. 

My husband ordered the sweet and spicey shrimp and it was a million times better than PF Changs. And I'm a woman that loves her PF Changs.

For dessert I had The Simms Family S'more. It may have been family size but it was no match for me. I inhaled that bad boy. It could have used ice cream for some added texture but it was definitely delicious!

My food was 30 minutes late, order missing items  and no apologizes for not bring out my curbside meals after I called twice. Its called curbside but tonight it was pick-up for me. 

Neverless, when I walk in two hostess a young man and a young woman are just standing there with my order sitting on the counter. 

No apologizes at all. The restaurants wasnt busy so there is really no excuse. I got my order because we have had a long day and didnt want to wait any longer.

This is one of the reasons chain restaurants are failing, lack of decent customer service.",beGUxlgg9DJnryhKp3Eb8A,3,2,1,TfLC5bBZp3lnyPAOBS6-Nw

I guess its a seat yourself place but it was hard to tell when there's no sign. I wanted a booth but was told all the servers went home so my 5' 1"" adult daughter who had a bad knee from a previous ACL surgery had to sit on one of those 6 foot high bar stool/chair (felt super high for short people) waitress was kind but poor thing was the only server for a bunch of other guests. Drinks came out quick. Food came shortly after. Food was delicious and nicely dressed. My husband got the meatloaf, I got the chicken pot pie. The crust was great, flakey and my daughter is a vegetarian and there was alot of veg options. The butter cake was good too.

Starting with very poor access for my wife and her walker. You literally have to go down to the back of the bldg and back to access handicap ramp...handicap parking right out front, next to the stairs by front door.
Waitress was great. Atmopshere average, Cali location and Summerlin location much better.
Had to send her order back to be heated...my burger, asked for medium was more well done. Upon leaving, new guests received freebies for first visit and told to save room for a free dessert...wtf? To top off experience, as we walked in noticed they had a 4 ""A"" rating: but when exiting now have 3"" A's"" and a "" B"".

5827680,2017-05-24,3,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"This is a 5-star review. This chain restaurant deserves the 5-stars. Here's why:

*) Obviously a good training program implemented by management that encourages team work and employee engagement.
*) Most every employee seemed motivated, dressed in appropriate attire uniformly, appeared to have a heart rate above 90 (hard working!), and was pleasant and understandable .
*) Variety and quality and portion size of food and drink was acceptable for the price, served promptly (correct temperature...hot foods hot, cold foods cold, etc), drinks refilled/reordered with regularity, desserts were solicited, etc.
*) Well stocked bar with premium liquor and very large selection of wine and beers and custom, unique non-alcoholic drinks (and gambling)

Those of you who do not like this place are more than welcome to abandon the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area because this restaurant is the epitome of the culinary scene in Las Vegas: strong employee motivation, good price, good quality, plenty of space for large groups and throngs and throngs of small group... plus a dog-friendly patio and dog- friendly menu.

5884499,2017-04-14,0,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"I've been here a couple times both for lunch and dinner. It could get busy. Specially on the weekends but they do a good job on cutting down the wait time because the restaurant is pretty spacious and has plenty of seating.

The restaurant has a bar-type ambience but it's not too loud, just right. They have an outdoor seating if you want to bring your four legged friends.

The first still you will notice is the menu. The menu is really extensive, there are so many choices. They have American,Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and many more. It could get overwhelming trying to choose from such a large menu. 

The food is good, the service was kind of slow. We had a 9:30 movie time and we sat at 7:15 and we didn't get served fast enough and the food came out too slow that we didn't have time to finish our food. 

But overall, I know the restaurant business can get pretty busy and chaotic so it's not a big deal.

5911798,2017-07-04,1,rdE9gg0WB7Z8kRytIMSapg,"I've been here twice for brunch and so far it's been my favorite brunch place in town (available until 2pm). $15 pitcher of sangria... $5 mimosa or peach bellini... I'm in brunch heaven! *When you check in you can try out their awesome cajun fries which is super crispy.*

Fresh Strawberry French Toast
3 pieces of toasted bread, whipped cream, strawberry compote -- I really enjoyed this dish. It wasn't too heavy or too sweet.

Breakfast Burger
Beef patty, bacon, sunny side up egg, crispy hash browns, cheddar, homemade sauce and fries -- this is my favorite of all. The burger was cooked to my liking, the egg was perfect, and the flavor was so yummy.

Country Chicken & Biscuit
Crispy fried chicken, chicken sausage, two sunny side up eggs & a house made buttermilk biscuit, cajun gravy / spiced maple syrup -- never had biscuits like this! Super crispy chicken and is delicious with the sauce.

Housemade Carnitas & Tater Tot Hash
Braised pork shoulder, two poached eggs, country potatoes, sweet potato tater tots, roasted bell peppers, onions, American cheese, roasted poblano pepper sauce, fresh cilantro -- holy crap, just the description of this dish made my mouth water... the green sauce is to die for! One of my favorites. HIGHLY recommend!

Overall, our service was great. Busy both times but we were sat fairly quickly. They have patio seating and allow your furry loved ones to join you!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,4,2,4,g3b69lfOreFlqG32PPtR5g

I love the patio area with the fire pit. I bring my little diva with me and she enjoys seeing the other doggies. The dog menu is simple and fairly priced. I like coming here on a nice night to take out my pup. 

Most times, the service is speedy and efficient. But on more than a few occasions, we've had to wait longer than necessary for something as simple as a water refill. I feel that there isn't much coverage for servers on the patio. It always seems like they're running around, overworked. I come here when I'm not in a hurry. 

Anyways, the food and drinks are fine. Nothing too outstanding. Hopefully the service improves, or I'll have to give the summerlin location a try.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,1,3,DHuBuNNjenPCXeLFNaskRQ

The two employees I spoke with at this location had a bad attitude.
The first one being the blonde girl in the front. It seemed like I was bothering her by checking in for a table.

Then our waitress again just had a bad attitude. Every time we needed something we had to wave her down. Never got a refill on drinks.

Instead of being irritated with having to come back to our table multiple times for our order, she was understanding and patient with us.
