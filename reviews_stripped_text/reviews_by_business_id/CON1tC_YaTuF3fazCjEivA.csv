170521,2017-02-20,0,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,Just bought a 16 piece family meal I ordered 3 mash potatoes and cole slaw. When we get home we realize they only gave us 1 order of mashed potatoes and a box of fries. If you didn't have everything we ordered then you should have let us know that rather than just giving us whatever you had on hand. Then I call the restaurant twice to inform them of the issue and the phone just rings. After waiting over 10 mins for my food this is unacceptable.,OpevAnvx6iYjU_D8NZlyPA,0,0,1,yQ9c6COSpkqfC1YgiKj27g

336302,2012-12-01,0,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,"So, I ended up here at the Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, located at 6121 Vegas Drive after going to the location on Rancho.  They were busy.  On Tuesday, they run a .99 cent special which includes the leg and thigh pieces of chicken.  This is a Great Deal.  So here we are in line, waiting.  Despite the overwhelming crowd of customers, they are rockin.  The wait wasn't very long, for me maybe five minutes.  I ordered 3 specials, red beans and rice and green beans.  The food was hot, fresh and taste the same as always, just plain ol good.  

I didn't give them  4 or 5 stars for one reason.  Because they were so busy, they began skimping on the portion sizes, as my order of red beans and rice was about thee quarters of the way full.  Also, upon ordering the red beans and rice, we received mash potatoes and gravy, which I had to brave the masses at the front counter to trade in.  We also ordered the spicy chicken and received regular.  So in their rushed state, they made a couple of vital mistakes... Overall the food was awesome, and they where handling the rush pretty well.  I would say tighten up just a little.  Pay a little more attention to detail...",FR3yOFal7e5u93WRhML4NQ,2,0,3,8GGIawM_EUYz6bYD6_dKfg
574822,2013-04-17,0,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,"Dude this is the worst popeyes I've been to.  Chicken was salty and had no other flavors.  Kinda pricey for what you got and the service (not bad) cant make up for the piss-poor food quality.  Wish there was a Churches nearby because this chicken SUCKS.  If I can cook better at home without even trying, its not worth coming here to eat salty tasteless chicken.",5XMkhq_xbycJYlOtsSwCEA,1,0,1,3CB8ICqBN8v0vETNr7CuQQ

I am taking the time to post this that corporate managers can hopefully do something. 

All we want is our chicken. This is the only Popeyes in this this particular neighborhood. That's the ONLY reason we come here.",-W7E8KAhE_ssJgWY0RF-Ww,3,0,1,XS0lGa52LK6T_u34bV-nPw
3241096,2015-09-22,1,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,This is possibly the worst popeyes I have ever been to. Despite the bad reviews i decided to take a chance. Customer service sucked and my biscuit was cold on the inside like it wasnt cooked all the way. Nothing but kids working there. Horrible service. Then the manager hands me my box of food with no bag.

The girl that took my order was patience, happy, genuine, and professional. Love the interior design of the location.

It's fine that I had to wait 15 minutes  for my food but I had to go to the counter 4 times to get what we needed to eat.

3868180,2016-09-24,0,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,No wonder overall this Popeyes has two ... the employees tonight were rude and uncaring... one guy had been waiting 35 minutes and demanded a refund and left. My husband waited 15 minutes and when we got home there was mainly dark meat instead of the 3 breasts we ordered ... and only 1 wing... AND no biscuits! (8 PC meal).   Stay away from this Popeyes... next time Will go back to the one on Craig... they are busy as hell but prepared ! And give you a free Soda  if you are waiting more than 5 minutes!  The one on Vegas Blvd sucks all around !,YAur8kRg_1_k3JFPdZUNXQ,0,0,1,ks9Vd-fDCw4uAVJVtJKgug
3906650,2017-02-28,0,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,I came here on my lunch break 2/28. Used the drive-thru and was asked to pull ahead. Was not informed that my food would take longer or the meal my co-worker had ordered takes longer then normal. We sat in the parking lot for the greater part of 20mins before we called and asked what the deal was.  We were then informed that the food is taking a longer and that we would just have to wait a little longer ... i used my entire 30min break plus being 10mins late to get back work and no time to eat.... this could have been avoided if at the time of ordering they would have told us that the food takes 25min minutes to make... im pissed and have wasted my time for nothing... will never go back here,fE4RBXNMTxQHZ6NUjDInUQ,0,0,1,3AkOSQx8uo0hTsuwvF1Tpw

4577487,2011-07-05,0,CON1tC_YaTuF3fazCjEivA,For what it is it's expensive. Not that it's not good. Just over price. Not to mention there is a KFC right down the street. The place is clean and it's a great location to have a chicken place. The service is what you would expect from a fast food. Also I think the portion size could be a little bigger (once again overpriced). So with out being more repetitive I'm done.,3DjTbhg_HndAxtRnRBt0aQ,2,0,2,hZg2Yi__Cfoe7IELG9HZ2A
