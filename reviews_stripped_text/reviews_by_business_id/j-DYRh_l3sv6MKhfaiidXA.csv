So I started going here and OMG! The first time I got one of there burritos I was in love with them I haven't stop going there ever since!! I just don't like how they started adding carrots and corn to the rice that took the flavor from the rice away. Other then that i am 100% sure Cejas knows who I am now because of how much I go.,uypm_NWiacTqCtQGFlwNcQ,0,0,5,Y9EU4Fj1GeACBwxCduzWJg

The red salsa is bomb! The food is the big star here. I'll be coming back!",kE8q35ZlazK-6QGElyvCaA,1,0,4,J9lhrQeZmXuGdQhmTmiVFw

Came with free chips and salsa that had great flavor. No real ambiance its just a lil taco shop. No fountain soda yet. They are new so I suspect they will have some changes in the future. I would definitely go back.,xSswLVAmW9bZ1-aVCfJyww,1,0,4,L_2_1syPzdrYpfSjpi1rqQ

The crispy shell was fried to perfection with moist, succulent well flavored chicken inside.   Accompanied with fresh tomatoes and guac....yum! The lengua and the al pastor were just okay in my opinion.  The al pastor was a little drier than I prefer and the lengua was chopped very finely, when I prefer the large tender pieces.  But for a joint located inside a gas station....not bad at all.  No place to sit, just standing bar tables....best to get it to go.  Kinda sketchy neighborhood FYI.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,1,4,8fD4RpTS8mId4hxmSogSMw
