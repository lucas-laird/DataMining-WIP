2098504,2016-12-17,0,oBdseQ_SP2Du7oY6-0YUSw,"I'm giving this location a one star rating because of three reasons: lack of customer service, price and the quality of food. When I approached them, the team members were conversing amongst themselves. I felt like I was rushed to order what I wanted so they can carry on with their conversation. I did not feel welcomed at all and it was a lot of awkward silent moments as I was paying for my meal. Second, I believe this is much overpriced for just ""okay"" food. Third, one of the team members offered a free sample of the orange chicken and it was freezing cold. I immediately got the kung pow instead.",Ym7bOXL1F0w520gkL4FzDQ,0,0,1,nxZVtA4Woer8ygEgmMe_mA

Do not eat here, it is way overpriced even by mall standards. My Mom had a cup of soup and a water and it was $4.50 She did not even enjoy the soup. I had Kung Pao Chicken and it was just a salty sauce that had no pow. My Rice Bowl was almost $7. We all know mall prices are higher, but you better serve something that tastes better. There are other choices but next time I will just eat elsewhere till they stop price gouging at malls and airports, because no one ever said,"" I had the greatest meal at the mall or airport""",LgiBFHIsRWIduc7HTq2rkA,2,1,1,IFDmYHbwA5vW6HUuEg0EoA

4053433,2014-08-08,0,oBdseQ_SP2Du7oY6-0YUSw,Looking for something to eat real quick and not too pricy before we head to events and we came across this hidden gem. Hearty portions. We had the #2. Two choices is noodles. Bourbon chicken and orange chicken. If you check in you get 10% off. So win win. My bf and I shared the plate and we got full. Good place to stop for a quick and affordable lunch. The food itself was good too! I'm giving it four stars just because no free refills.,EzscKty-Eyz5kkSLlbQ6Ig,0,0,4,pg3Ivub9ynSJulTSHCQi4A
4178493,2016-09-26,0,oBdseQ_SP2Du7oY6-0YUSw,"I wish there was a ZERO star for this review. I have NEVER experienced a lady so rude and bitchy!! we ordered a China max bowl and it was going well, and then I said I wanted a medium CUP. I never mentioned what drink we wanted because we were still deciding. when I told the register lady that we wanted a lemonade drink, she said, ""do you guys still want your coke?"" Or something about a coke. I never said I wanted a coke. Maybe the other lady thought I said coke, but even if, you can just EASILY replace the drink to a lemonade. You misheard us. So it's your responsibility to kind of apologize and maybe say, ""I'm sorry I thought you guys said Coke, I'll give you guys the lemonade in a second""??? But she was just SO rude about it! shaking her damn head at me and slammed the drink there, are you serious? I work at a food place, I KNOW the difference between a rude customer and a nice one. I was never rude to her because I know how it feels like to be rude at an employee for no reason but she just treated me like I was stupid or something!! AND when we were at the register and I glanced at her, she was STILL shaking her head like she WANTED me to see that she's mad. At this point I was ready to write this review. We got charged extra for something that we DIDN'T want. we took it anyway because the lady serving us just looked like she was about to explode and wanted us out of there, even though we were nice to her the whole time. Needless to say I am never coming in here again. I do NOT recommend this place at all!!!! should've read the reviews here before we ordered.

I wasn't sure that the meat in my beef and broccoli would constitute as meat, sure didn't taste like it.

4751418,2013-08-01,0,oBdseQ_SP2Du7oY6-0YUSw,"This little mall quick restaurant was right by our hotel- and was a nice inexpensive break from most Vegas food. The two people working were very kind despite having no air in 100+ heat which is more than I would be able to give in that heat. The bourbon chicken and orange chicken were good. Fried rice was very bland.
Pluses: quick, good tasting, friendly service
Negatives: seating area was very dirty",TYfZrIzz08VGmvvvGZhqyw,0,0,3,qg-1hNaXjHEXpC_ywhVJcA
4896722,2017-05-26,0,oBdseQ_SP2Du7oY6-0YUSw,"I thought I'd give this place another chance. To start service is everything. During my last visit I was not greeted, i was giving the attitude that I was an ""inconvenience"" to the two workers there. I ordered fried rice, & mushroom chicken.  Rice was dry, not much flavor. The mushroom chicken was a bit better but yet I've had better. The cashier talked to her co worker and paid no attention while I waited to hand her my signed receipt slip. No thank you and she walked alway. Yes real pleasant. This was about 6 months ago. 

Now for today's visit...  There was again two females working at around 4PM. Still no greeting, still given that look as if they were interrupted again. She didn't ask if I wanted my meal take out or dine in but I did say take out. I ordered a bowl and she handed me my food without a lid. I kindly asked for a lid and she gave a big sigh like it's so damn had to put a lid on a bowl!  Walked on over to the cashier who was taking with that rude server. No hi, no do you need anything else, I asked for a bag and she just handed it to me. Yes it must be VERY difficult to bag my meal as well. No thank you. This place is seriously a joke. I'm going to do both these rude workers and myself a favor by not returning.  It's just a fair warning, unless you want to be served food that's less than average while being served by people with attitudes just as bad, I'd avoid this place. There's much better out there.",XZiJCW_VkWNdN_xt9jhrbw,0,0,1,wtexKGS_NTHwveDWfTuzwA
5007469,2015-08-15,0,oBdseQ_SP2Du7oY6-0YUSw,Don't go here. They served us cold food and then told us that it always gets cold fast. They did offer our money back right away but it would have been nice if they could have just served us hot food. Their steam tables aren't keeping anything hot. I'm not sure how they stay in business.,NFJMg9B6JyHMrT4FLHv9bA,0,0,1,aV_QseNIKl0eDJPsRzSPnw
