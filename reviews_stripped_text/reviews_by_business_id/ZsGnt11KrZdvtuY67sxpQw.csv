7335,2016-03-15,0,ZsGnt11KrZdvtuY67sxpQw,"Food is bad bar food. My friends Club Sandwich's toast was burnt. Kitchen staff should know enough to re-toast some more if it gets burnt. I asked for no bacon on my salad, came with bacon.  The worst part was the service. Waited 10 min. just for water, 15 min to place our order, 30 more min. to receive our food! The waitress knew the people at the next table and catered to them even though we came in before them.   Thanks to Anni, we will never be back, I have never been treated so badly.

It was not busy at all so we found no excuse. It certainly is a shame  because of the lovely atmosphere and view but we won't be back.,qp4hRJvDhhwt3e9ePfrFqw,0,0,3,7R09E26_v78bbcdQtrmerw
1853213,2017-05-15,0,ZsGnt11KrZdvtuY67sxpQw,"Went for Mothers Day buffet today for the third year in a row. We had 1200 reservations when we arrived were told our table would be ready in ""5 minutes"". 30 minutes later we were finally seated. No silverware, napkins or set ups of any kind. We went and got our food, which I will admit was very good. We waited another 15 minutes to have our drink orders taken. Coffee and water refills were very slow and mimosas ending up being selve serve from the bar. I understand Mothers Day is busy , but we had been here the last two years. When our bills came each of the 3 families were billed 23% gratuity!!!! I am in the hospitality business here in Vegas myself and I can say this was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. We will take our family of 12 elsewhere next year, not that Angel Park or Ninos or whatever new name comes in will care as they sure didn't today!!",GjBmRX9_tyRDy1fcq3sQxA,3,0,2,0s8wjCq_MdxtV9_-L1BG_w

The mahi was moist and cooked perfectly and the sweet potato fries were great.

Patron at bar just dropped a dozen F bombs. Bar is right next to dinning. Food is good, onion rings right out of the freezer. They were not good. I may or may not come back. Food is reasonably priced. Staff friendly but very unprofessional.

Then proceeded to seat our selves with no direction or acknowledgment of our arrival.  We then sat for 30 minutes before anyone even came to the table. She indicated that someone would be with us soon. We then waited for another 20 minutes watching other tables being served who had arrived after us.

2155311,2018-02-13,0,ZsGnt11KrZdvtuY67sxpQw,"Came here before a round of golf and after looking at the menu, was really excited to try the food.  The menu was extensive and for what we were getting, pretty cheap which is always a plus, especially on a golf course in that part of town.  
I got the ahi tuna sandwich with coleslaw which was divine although when I saw the coleslaw portion compared to my friend's fries, I was bit disappointed.  The rest of my crew got the ahi tuna salad which was really good, the club, and the Reuben sliders which were apparently amazing.  I wish this spot was closer to my side of town because I would come here all the time and not just when I am golfing.",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,1,1,4,ZfICUGU7hQEghdy1w5-q5g
2309055,2014-10-09,2,ZsGnt11KrZdvtuY67sxpQw,"I was invited to this cute spot by one of my myoho sisters. It is a PERFECT spot for lunch. The menu is simple but full of variety. I had the steak nachos with guacamole (I used the 50% off any starter coupon offered for first timers--super generous savings!) and peach green tea. The nachos were HUGE and the tea was perfect; ice cold and with just the right amount of sweet.
The best part about this spot is the view! The patio is the place to be. See attached photo. 
For golf course food it rates the best for taste and value for your money. The nachos start at $10 - but for the price you get what you pay for. 
The manager came out to thank me for using Yelp! It made me feel pretty good and my girlfriend was impressed. The waitress was prompt and friendly. 
I will be sharing for this spot with other girlfriends. It's perfect for socializing.",tijY6q1RKwXi3yG8ckF2EA,3,4,5,2VRFAjUAYdSF_IIjmNegzg

Came on a Monday afternoon sat outside on patio with friend. Patio overlooks the golf course with views of waterfalls and lake. Little bunny rabbits running thru the course and even up on patio. 
Service was spotty at first but then our server came out got us some drinks and the menus. Ordered the  sliders and their summerlin salad. Wow very happy with both and as I sat there looking over course I actually felt like I was not even in Vegas.
On the patio you can eat, drink and relax and even smoke. 
This is a very nice place with service and food to match.",II8eB5mYk200GW-m-wpsug,1,0,5,0lsXOCYusK_uNaCEwzr2FQ
2931055,2017-04-15,1,ZsGnt11KrZdvtuY67sxpQw,"Jeez, do they hate us?

Upon walking in there's no host/ess, but also no sign that says seat yourself, so we stood around awkwardly for a minute before deciding to seat ourselves.

Nobody attended our table for a bit, so we were looking around for any indication that maybe we were not supposed to be there, but finally went up to the bar to get the bartenders attention. She kept attending to her current patrons, and kept skipping us. It wasnt packed or busy.

Another patron handed us their menu after they were done and we went back to our table to look at it, when the server finally came. (They don't wear name tags but it seemingly doesn't matter which server it is, based upon the other reviews here in Yelp).

She told us the menu we had wasn't the right menu, nor was their online menu so she gave us the correct one. But still she was super annoyed we were there, which left us still confused if we weren't supposed to be there? But after awhile it seemed this was the norm for the other surrounding patrons. 

Food quality was similar to Dennys, but hey you get better service there. These people definitely do not want to serve you. So expect to feel that uncomfortable atmosphere.",p2DPOJbpG4WBtcS7Fzw3kg,2,1,1,Moc_OIXlD3R4MMuwbNDEnA

I had the delicious crab cake salad which was wonderful....full of excellent flavor and the perfect size.
My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich which was complemented with a delicious cole slaw on the sandwich and the best crispy fries!   YUMMY!
Drinks were a good size and the staff was friendly and accommodating .

The food is priced perfectly and the food is Good. Not Awesome but good. Perfect for groups or just a relaxing spot for one. The only thing I would change is the coffee mugs. They are glass and do not keep coffee warm. Other than that this is a great place to come and sit outside. (They have shade coverage).,vZ-MSIB-HMO3YGNwiJak9A,1,0,4,3dVFDxtXhNYTBLb8r5v5CQ

4484590,2018-05-16,2,ZsGnt11KrZdvtuY67sxpQw,"First, a disclaimer: I was here with a group from my neighborhood for the Tuesday Evening Patio Party, so the Happy Hour menu was on the bill.

The setting is magnificent: a very large patio fronting water and mountains. Our group got together at 6:00 p.m., and it was still sunny; I didn't see much refuge from the sun, but happily, it wasn't that hot, and by the time the sun set it was perfect weather.

I was a little peeved that my favorite wines, Riesling and Prosecco, or even a Cava, weren't available. I was obligingly brought a sample of two different Pinot Grigios, but they were too dry for my taste, so in a Sleepless in Seattle moment, I said ""I'll have what she's having,"" meaning my neighbor, who was sipping a vodka and cranberry with a splash of OJ. It turned out to be one of the most awful drinks I've ever had, really peculiar tasting; a waitress said she thought it might be the cranberry they use. I suspect I'm not the first to have sent it back. I ended up with the Pinot, anyway. It was a couple of notches up from that dreadful other one.

I ordered the shrimp salad, but this was no salad. There was an enormous portion of tasty shrimp. Had I known that it was going to be in a full bowl of SOUP, composed of what tasted like mayonnaise and ketchup with an almost imperceptible kick of spice, I would have asked for the dressing on the side. There was no way of getting most of the clingy sauce off any of the shrimp. It was also too much shrimp for one person to eat; between that and the dressing, it's a good thing I'm not having my cholesterol checked tomorrow.

After that, I stood up, and suddenly realized that the entire back of my pants was wet - REALLY wet. It looked as if I had done you-know-what. I looked at the seat, which had definitely been dry when I first sat down, and it, too, had a big, round wet spot dead center. A couple of guys who are regular golfers and diners there, who had come over to talk to one of our group, told me that this sometimes happens, because the seats get wet from the sprinklers, absorb the water, get dry on the outside, then spring a leak after someone sits in them. Lucky me! I didn't dry off during the considerable time we spent after that, even in the desert, and was really uncomfortable and embarrassed. My husband managed to find a cushion for me that had a plasticized exterior. Many of the other fabric ones had lots of bird poop on them.

My husband was still hungry after his chicken ""fingers,"" which were really bigger than any fingers I've ever seen (this is not a political statement), so he got the Margherita flatbread, which another neighbor was eating. It looked a little soft, so he asked for it well-done, which is the way it came out. It was good, though not exceptional.

The waitress (and the rest of the staff) did a fabulous job, especially considering the size of the group, our many requests, and the fact that everyone wanted separate checks, which were cheerfully provided.

Five stars for the ambience, service and the guitarist, who never seemed to take a break and played wonderful music that still allowed us to talk. Two to three stars for the food. One star for the trick fabric cushions. I might consider coming back, but surely not when summer in the desert ratches up.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,5,3,LCoOD4s-swcOqF5YJ1neww

My wife said Brazil???   she couldn't understand English. We asked what wines they poured after repeating the question a few times she thought about it and said we have Red and White.  Really!!!
