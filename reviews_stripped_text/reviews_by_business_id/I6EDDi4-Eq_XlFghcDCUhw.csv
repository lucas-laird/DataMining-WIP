Just like many classic steak houses, this place has good old fashioned service with good, expensive food. Unlike classic steak houses, the dishes at this place are kind of unique and interesting. I had a seafood salad that was very unique with lots of different types of seafood and even hearts of palm.

Sehr schön mit dunklem Holz in Bistrostyle eingerichtet. Bedienungen anfangs freundlich
aber mit Schwächen im Service. Wir bestellten César Salat der ganz toll war wie er sein muss. Dann kam die große Stone Crab Platte, bedeute gedünstete und bereits geknackte Scheren der berühmten Riesenkrabben aus den Florida Keys. Unglaublich frisch und lecker, feines Aroma mit sehr lecker Sauce zum dippen.

17140,2016-04-16,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I found this restaurant while shopping at Caesars on Yelp.  Not only was the food incredible and fresh but the service was first class! I rarely ever order crab on a menu because it is usually disappointing. Too salty and too stringy.  The king crab, however, was absolutely fantastic!  My husband and I followed the king crab as an appetizer with the wedge salad followed by our shared main entrées of the best fried chicken in the world and also the scallops. Our veggie side were the crispy brussels sprouts!  Based on recommendations on Yelp, we ordered the banana cream pie which was the most tantalizing combination of perfectly ripe bananas, cream, warm caramel sauce. The coffee is also something exceptional!  After you're finished eating, they bring you warm towels to wipe your hands with fresh lemons over the washcloths. It's the perfect duo of a fresh, real washcloth wipe with the natural lemon scent!  Many thanks to our server Steve G. for an overall 5+ star experience!",MhWJKA1ZzZyljCnnjxOpFA,0,0,5,zG-eKdKf5NlqNsw1e-qOfg

Best dish of the night was the crispy brussel sprouts. Now when you're at Joe's this should be considered a problem. Staff was nice enough but i came here to get my seasonal stone crab on, not to discuss why Vegas doesn't sell powerball tickets. Anyhow. I've finally solved the mystery. The reason why this is not up to par with Joe's is this is NOT Joe's. They license the name and use the same vendors. Think Donald Trump and how his name was licensed up the yazoo a decade ago...when he was bankrupt. Not during the current Presidential campaign. Yup. 3 stars is generous for this evening's meal.",XBikDsRVmM-pnHSHBzrWpg,0,0,3,a8r_l1Oc3etFxrjhdbDhUQ

Everything was up to Joe's high standards, including the service.  Watch out for the pretzel bread in the bread basket-- it may make you ruin your appetite it is so good.

Service is always professional and attentive and the atmosphere is great- we always request a booth.  They have a nice bread basket with this pretzel bread that my husband loves.  The stone crabs come in several different sizes, the difference being the price and the amount of work you have to do (larger and more expensive crabs require less work, and come 5 to an order).  They are served with a yummy mustard sauce and sides are a la carte.  They have a delicious creamed spinach with roasted garlic cloves, and a super sweet roasted corn.  I have also had the parmesan crusted halibut here, which is delicious and is served in a lemon butter sauce.  Their dessert menu is extensive, featuring every traditional pie (strawberry rhubarb, apple, coconut cream, peanut butter, key lime, boston cream, etc) and they have an incredible peppermint ice cream that comes with hot fudge sauce.  It is the stone crab and that peppermint ice cream that keep me coming back here.

We were there at 3:10 PM so we decided to have lunch instead of dinner. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fish tacos. The fish served with the fish and chips was horribly over cooked, there were 3 pieces of fish each weighed maybe an ounce each, they were full size pieces, just over cooked so badly that there was nothing left, the chips were just the standard steak fries that are served at about every nickel and dime restaurant across the country, nothing special. At $21.95 I expected something better than this.
My wife said the fish tacos were just ok, there were 2 tacos and some broccoli, nothing special, you can get better at Applebee's or Denny's for about $8.00, we paid $17.95 at Joe's. Add in $3.50 each for a couple of iced teas and our bill came to $50.70 less tip.

They have an entire vegetarian and gluten free menu (that you do have to request to see) and the vegan options are labeled! I was happy as a clam. 
Our waiter was Bradley - he has a wonderful sense of humor and service as well. He kept us laughing and made sure we were all taken care of. My husband and I had to dine pretty fast because we had reservations for a helicopter tour which Bradley did an excellent job of ensuring we made it out on time. 
Now the question I'm sure you're all dying to know the answer to... What did I order?! My appetizer was the All Greens salad - a very simple salad, with literally just chopped greens and a few tomatoes. However that's all this salad needs... The dressing is really the star of the plate! It was incredible. For my entree, I got the Cauliflower Steak. I was in heaven! It was absolutely outstanding. 
My husband got one of the crab plates, which I could tell he enjoyed since he didn't say a word while he was eating it. 
Overall, this was a wonderful experience. I'm so impressed that there was a vegetarian menu, I thought for sure I would only be eating a salad and a few sides for my meal!",c_eudHft3OL_6d_59thukA,2,0,5,pKGwHUsi7rUn8SxNUcFUng

As a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble I spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  Joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!   

We were given a private room with a fantastic server, Thomas.  Everything was absolutely fantastic.  We started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  It has Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Alaskan King Crab and Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche.  The seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  Next I had the Stone Crab Bisque, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of stone crab.  I ordered the Lump Crab Cakes which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.  

My bf had the Bone in Rib Eye which was quite possibly the best steak I've ever tasted.  It was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Others in my party had the Bone in Filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  Also, one other ordered the Dover Sole, which I highly recommend.  It was fresh and cooked perfectly.  It was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  The Stone Crabs are also very good.  They come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back the shell pieces and savor the incredibly sweet stone crab meat.  For dessert we tried the Blueberry Pie a la mode, the Key Lime Pie and the Banana Cream Pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   However, the Banana Cream Pie was a standout.  It was amazing!

I was having a really bad day, I lost my ID in the convention somewhere, and hadn't had much sleep since it was a work event and we were all up late taking care of presentation stuff.

Our server was amazing, pleasant and on top of it. We started off with the fried calamari, my friend got the filet mignon and I chose the crab cakes. This was THE best meal I've ever had and my friend agreed. The fried calamari was light and not greasy, the crab cakes had big chunks of crab and lots of flavor, and the filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly!

Unlike this taste violation, their baked tomatoes with spinach puree and cheddar is a wonder to behold, and worth the long walk from the Excalibur. Even their tea was terrible. The service was surly and getting a towel to save my fingers from terminal crabbiness took some doing. I had walked by this restaurant a couple of years ago and thought they must do something wonderful with crabs to name their restaurant Joes Stone Crabs.. Maybe in Miami.

The crab cakes are 95% crab chunks. And I mean chunks, none of those wimpy small pieces you get in normal crab cakes. The crabs they use must be huge! The meat was sweet and juicy, and the binding agent they use to hold it all together only added to the flavor. The cakes are roasted to a golden brown (not fried) and about the size of a tennis ball. One $16 serving comes with two cakes, making this an insanely good deal.

The crab bisque was very tasty and super rich, if a little salty. A small cup was $8, but it was so rich and filling that I could barely finish it.

The seafood salad comes with avocado, celery, asparagus, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, onions, and lobster, shrimp and crab meat. They were generous with the seafood,  and all the ingredients worked well together.

Clam chowder - no complaint

Stone crabs - 70.45 market price for 6 large claws. I've definitely eaten better crab claws that are meatier, juicier and more fresh elsewhere in the world; namely Japan and Vancouver. I think it's overrated and not worth the money.

Dry aged rib-eye - not bad, cooked to medium as requested. 

Service - waiter is attentive. However I don't like how they brought all the dishes at the same time when I clearly told him that we will eat the stone crabs as an appetiser. By the time we were finished with the crabs the rib-eye got cold, think it would have tasted better warmer.

Also, when I asked the server for extra butter, his reaction was as if I had just insulted him. I eventually had to ask a bus-boy for the butter.  Service was rushed and sub-par for this restaurant.

BF wanted to get some real quality Alaskan King Crab Legs and I wanted raw oysters

~ The Order ~

Alaskan King Crab Legs - $59.95
-  First, the order was huge..I mean I know it is only 1lb but damn..
-  He usually loves the crabs at the Wynn but these are so much more fresh, less waterly, and sweeter
- Waiter said they are flown in everyday fresh

Oysters on the Half Shell - $13.95
 - Small but very plump & yummy

Mac & Cheese - $7.95
- This was soo good..it was creamy and little crunch topping
- I forget ..it was a white cheese..think it was gorgonzola or something not cheddar

Half Peanut Butter Pie - $3.95
- if you love PB this is for you cuz it is very very rich and creamy
- best part is the half size is still pretty big & sharable

~ Other Comments ~
- Service was great
- Nice to sit in the bar area & watch TV and chill
- half size for most of their desert

I've been wanting to go to Joe's ever since I saw it featured on Giada's Weekend Getaways (although that was the Miami location).

I wanted to come here for dinner, and we had some trouble finding reservations on a Friday night (then again, probably shouldn't have tried to make reservations that day). We ended up taking a 5:30 spot, which is, not surprisingly, when they open up for the dinner service.

We ordered the Stone Crab appetizer, the crab cakes, and the rib eye steak. While waiting for our meal, we were served a basket of different types of bread. Hands down, the little pretzel bread was my absolute favorite. 

We were served the our appetizer, and we dived into the four claws that we were served.  They were soo good, succulent, and with a sweeter flavor than you find in the dungeness crabs I normally eat in LA.  The mustard dipping sauce was really good too; definitely not too mustardy. I would actually call it more of an aioli.  

Our entress were delectable as well. I ordered the crab cakes, and my eyes popped open when they were served I was expecting a couple disk-shaped cakes, but these were no mere disks, but MOUNDS.  The cakes had practically no fillers to it, but was just all sweet, delicious crab.  The steak was amazing as well.  It had a delicious, almost salty crust to it, and it was perfectly cooked. It brought to mind that I haven't had a good steak in, well, a long time.

But, after eating a few bites of the steak, I was craving the real star of the show, more of the stone crab, which were quickly inhaled at the beginning of the meal. 

Great service too I might add. We told the waitress we loved the cheese bread and she loaded us up with a bunch of it on our way out which made for a great snack on our plane ride home.",2mh_mBxmLBPHr49nlZYBZQ,2,0,5,i1lXCKl5E0-KHNpAro-9sg

The full was cooked to perfection. There were 3 in my party so we shared an order of roasted corn and spinach and a bottle of wine. Everyone really enjoyed their meal.

272737,2010-05-07,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I'm really not a crab lover, so my wife and I usually come here to satisfy her own unusual craving for crab. That said, we've been here three times now, and I think I'm finally beginning to understand the hype.

First - the service is great. To me, service is what makes or breaks a great dining experience. Even if the food is amazing, bad service can make you leave a restaurant feeling like it was terrible. That's not the case here. We're usually served by Brian (who was recently moved up to a somellier) - and he has been nothing short of helpful, friendly, and attentive. Honestly, my wife and I both waited our fair share of tables in our lives, and Brian has far exceeded what we consider ""good service"". 

Ok - so the crab - I'll admit that while it took me a while to get into, I'm starting to love it. The mustard that it comes with is quite nice as well. Really yummy stuff, and it feels good to eat something so out-of-the-ordinary when we're in Vegas.

I've also had their Filet - which was, to my opinion, a little too much on the ""Pittsburgh"" style for my tastes. I know a lot of Yelpers like it, but it didn't blow me away. Super tasty, it's just a personal preference for cooking style.

I had the pork chop most recently - the portion was HUGE - like a dinosaur pork chop - really yummy stuff. We also had the crab cakes, which were epic - almost nothing but lump Blue Crab - delicious in ways I never thought crab could be.

Finally - the dessert - Brian recommended the Banana's Foster pie to us on our first visit nearly 6 months ago, and we haven't been able to find a better dessert anywhere ever since. I've read the key lime pie is great, but I honestly don't know how on earth you could top the Banana's Foster pie. Decadent, creamy, with a homemade caramel sauce on top - there aren't many better ways to end a night in Vegas (ok, maybe a few ;)).

He took our order and their were a few specifics that my wife had instructed for her entree. I don't think he passed on the info to the kitchen. He dropped the food and hadn't offered to refill any of our beverages and we had to tell the busboy of any further needs that we encountered.You would think when ordering a $65.00 steak that there would be concern about how everything was prepared.He did not stop by once as he was pre-occupied by a couple right next to our table!!

Compared to other establishments of this caliber their food was a hit & miss for us that night. The filet was perfectly cooked, but the quality of the rib-eye wasn't that great. It was a little on the chewy & slightly stringy side. The rib-eye at Gallagher's in NY NY hotel was better. 

The chilled stone crab claws were pleasantly sweet & delicious, but we felt that they were quite overpriced (~$25 for two claws). The 1lb lobster tail was cooked well, but lacked the subtle charred/smokey flavor that I love from a grilled lobster tail. As for the sides of mushroom, asparagus, & spinach...all three were overly salty. They also forgot our bread basket which they immediately remedied as soon as we asked about it.

The only reason Joe's doesn't get 5 starts is some of their sides haven't been the best.  My favorite of the side dishes is the sweet corn. The Stone crab is always on point but I keep coming back for the bone in rib-eye.  Which is served with some sort of seasoning which just brings out the flavor in every bite.

Loved the crab bisque, assorted breads (especially the pretzel rolls and Irish soda bread), stone crab claws (tasty sweet meat) plus they do all work cracking the shells, Dover sole (prepared at the table), and the homemade desserts.  Desserts are big enough to share but you won't want to, we really enjoyed the Boston cream pie and just about the best Key Lime pie ever.

You must get the Stone Crabs (large ones if they have them)
They are Melt in your Mouth.
They give you a Mustard/Mayo Dipping sauce which my Mom said was incredible but I dont like Mayo.   So they gave me a Malt Vinegar and their
Red Wine Shallot vinigerette to dip the crabs in,  Both were sooo good!

We started with salads.
I had the Chopped Veggie Salad which had a ton of veggies and was great.
My parents had a Chopped Lettuce Tomato and Blue Cheese Salad which they loved.

My Dad did not get the Stone Crabs, he got Lobster Tail  Tempura.
I tasted it, and it was also Melt in Your Mouth.

Sides we got:
Lyonaisse Potatoes (I dont eat potatoes but they looked amazing if you do).
They were  dome shape, crunchy, and had carmelized onions on top.
Brocollini, which was simple with a garlic and olive oil, but very good.

They give you a good selection of breads beforehand that seem to be homemade.  
I'm not really one to eat bread before a meal, but they had these really think cracker like things with parm cheese baked in and some intersesting seeds that we couldnt get enough of.

Parents split the Key Lime Pie for dessert.   I didnt eat it, but it looked good, they said it was very good and the homemade crust looked good.

Waiter was great.  Very informative and nice.

I'd 100% recommend.

Service was fast and professional. We were given our drinks and a complimentary bread assortments right away. We ordered Crab Cake, Fillet Mignon 8oz, and Lobster Tail. 

The Crab Cake was really good, and it was a nice start to our meal. It was served with a creamy sauce with a little horseradish kick at the end. 

The Lobster Tail was exquisite! Our server, Thomas, was nice enough to mention that they have changed the style of how they cook their lobsters so that it is now more tender than it was before. 

The Fillet Mignon was good, but a little under seasoned for my liking. It came with a salt based seasoning on the side, but I wasn't a big fan of it and I asked for steak sauce instead. They only had A1 sauce, which was alright with me. Perhaps my opinion of the steak is biased because my last steak I had was real Kobe beef in Japan, which was hands down the best steak I'll ever have lol

712323,2010-07-22,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"4 words:  Terrible service, great food.
 
Well, I don't stick to 4 words very well, so here's a few more.
 
The restaurant itself is very nice.  We dined in the main dining room, which was comfortable and cozy.  We had a reservation and on a Saturday night, we did not wait one minute to be seated.  Unfortunately, that's where the good service ended.  Our female server was haughty and condescending, and reluctant to offer any suggestions whatsoever.  
 
So we decided on the Stone Crab Bisque, Bacon-Wrapped Scallops and Select Stone Crab Claws, with a side of mac n' cheese, which seems to be my current obsession.
 
With the exception of the mac n'cheese, the food was GREAT.  The bisque was better than GREAT, it was amazing!  Lick-your-bowl amazing.  The scallops were perfect, as was the crab.  
 
Dessert?  Who knows?  It was never offered and we couldn't catch our server.  This seems to be happening to me a lot in LV, a less confidant (or less thin, hahahaha) woman would start to assume that the servers think I don't need dessert.  WhatEVER, there is dessert available elsewhere, in the form of cocktails served a little later during the REALLY GREAT Matt Goss show over at Cleopatra's Barge. *separate review posted*
 
Anyway, not bad value for GREAT food, except for that bad service thing.  I wrote a less than flattering comment about it on Open Table, and received an e-mail from the manager.  I provided him with the requested phone number to reach me, and he did call.  Left a voice mail, which I returned and it ended there.  Not too impressed. 
 
Soooo, once again, a 5 star review becomes a 3 star review due to the bad service.",x9g-i1DsB-VjSDGVOdRonA,3,0,3,um-AdK1AIjMlphBosBEyjw

When we got there we were told there would be a wait, and we were concerned we would be late for our show. I told the maitre de that a few minutes later, and they were able to seat us at a small table immediately. 

Our waiter was incredibly professional and made sure our orders were expedited because we were in a hurry. I had a steak and hash browns and my boyfriend had the seafood platter. Everything was delicious and we decided it was one of the best meals we'd ever had. They gave us complimentary champagne as well, which was just the icing on top of the cake.

We sat in the bar/lounge area and was not disappointed at all. We had a reservation but when we arrived they were about 15 minutes behind so we decided to sit at the bar. 

I will admit, the two Hosts really need to work together and better their communication skills. 

What did we eat, too much! We ended up sharing a ceviche, crab bisque, crab cake, BLT wedge salad, Joe's scallops and the copper river salmon. The BLT was best. It was so good, I went back the next day for lunch with my friend and had it again. I love salads and I love it even more when the lettuce is crisp and all the ingredients are fresh. All of our food was delicious and the vibe there again was fun and young. The bartenders were great and I love a staff the can provide an environment when you can be yourself and also know you're in a fine dining establishment. Great job Joe's!

Ha, I saved dessert for last :) Joe's has some kicking pie too. Yes, pies. Please try and save room for the blueberry pie. And when you're lucky, they'll have a rhubarb pie that is so refreshing and such a fabulous way to end your meal :)

We started with a bottle of En Route Pinot noir. The wine mark-ups are high. We spilt an order of oysters Rockefeller and a Caesar salad.

Upon entry I was met by this uptight and rude host named Tim. Despite having a reservation and arriving 5 minutes early, Tim did his absolute best to make sure we were treated like and felt like complete crap. He was demeaning and talked down to us. I wanted to leave. Unfortunately it was the only place we had a reservation so we could not go anywhere else. So I just sucked it up and sat down. 

Our waiter was fine. He did a good job of explaining the various specials as well as making recommendations that fit our mood. While the food sounded good when he explained it, that was not the case when we ate it. I had the filet...YUCK. I'm not sure if they used old or bad meat but it tasted like an old shoe. It was over cooked and had no flavor. Disgusting. I also had the stone crab which was supposed to be an appetizer but it took forever to arrive. In fact, it arrived AFTER our main course. What a joke! 

At this point I was so fed up I did not want to bother with dessert. So I left. I know for a fact I will NEVER come back to this location...at least not until that @$$ hole Tim is fired. What a prick. 



Oh, and one more thing. After I complained to the manager about my experience, he LAUGHED at me in my face and refused to shake my hand after the whole ordeal. Disappointing and unprofessional.",yRDdpdh5Ilk0sY2O7Nh_fw,2,0,1,_K9Z-evCKOv8IRkLyhrp9w

One of my favorite items here is the Madagascar Shrimp. This is a large (and I mean large) grilled shrimp and they have a delicious key lime ailoi sauce. This sauce with the shrimp is heavenly. That is until you try the Stone Crab and Joes 'secret' mustard sauce. This is one of the best combinations ever.
The only thing I would say is make sure you get the 'Stone Crab' and not the 'Rock Crab' they tried to tell us it was the same thing and it's not. Besides that everything else we've tried is also good.
Make sure you call ahead or use open table to get reservations. This place is always packed and that is for a reason. They are one of the best restaurants in the country.",L8mt1u1DoxH1oA-IQhawbA,0,0,5,pTgp1X3BkPBUyPct0dquEQ

The jumbo claws they serve is only as big as the large ones served in the Miami location, and their large stone crab claws may not even pass the medium size test by Miami's standard.

As for sweetness of the crab claw meat, there is no comparison between the two places.  The location in Miami beats this place hands down.

My Buddy and his wife visit Vegas frequently and know many of the Staff at Joes. The rest of us had all been there at least once and were excited to go. The service was good as my buddy knew that waiter and he was very good to us. We all shared a few plates of Stone Crab and it was good, but not great. My brothers and I ordered Steak and to say they were all burn't would be an understatement. They weren't too bad inside, but the strong burn't taste on the outside took away from any positive flavor left in the steak. My youngest brother said something at the table, but my buddies wife made it very clear to him that he ""did not know anything and to not embarass her"". We all kept our mouth's shut and choked down the steaks. On a positive note my wife had Dover Sole prepared at the table and it was Fantastic. It's a shame as Joe's likely would have looked after this miscue, but we didn't have the chance to let them know and after we left none of us were inspired to return again on our next trip to Las Vegas.",xT3ZDTZBBsBVRjD8C0d3Kg,0,0,2,jKy_sXC_x02ot_2AvxHM_A

The service is amazing and the bread is great. I would also suggest making reservations either on yelp or call-in cuz it does get busy. I prefer sitting outside where the forum shops are.

I asked for our potatoes anyway (firmly but politely), and we never saw him again after he brought them.  He walked by our table several times waiting on others and never once checked on us.  Then after we declined dessert (due to his rudeness), it took him 45 minutes to bring us our check.  Unbelievable.  My husband also became very ill for 24 hours after having the seared scallops.

I had their specialty- the stone crab.  I like the idea that the crabs don't have to die for my meal... Because they only take one claw- and they grow it back.  But... I eat meat... So... One meal- eh- *shrug*.  My rating of the stone crab is... Get the crab legs!  They crush the claws- and there's a bunch of small pieces of shell in about 25% of your bites- kind of annoying.  The claws are served with mustard- which was good... But I prefer drawn butter with the crab flavor!  All in all- a great experience.... Get the king legs...

908341,2015-11-09,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Joe's is living off their reputation which may have been well deserved however it is a restaurant that serves mediocre food at very high prices.

My dining companion and I had stone crab and Alaskan king crab for an appetizer. The Alaskan king crab was delicious and easy to eat as the shell was split in the kitchen and the meat comes out in one piece. The stone crab was a different story as the shell was smashed in the kitchen and there were numerous small pieces of shell that were hard to see when you separate the shell from the meat. If you happened to miss a small piece of the shell you are in for a surprise if you bite on a piece of the shell as it is hard as.... well, a stone.

For main courses my companion had a filet mignon (ordered medium) and I had the grilled seafood platter, which consisted of Madagascar shrimp, lobster and scallops. We had sides of sauteed spinach and crispy brussel sprouts. The steak was raw in the middle and overdone on the exterior which is inexcusable when you are paying Joe's prices and there is the sous vide technique to ensure steak is cooked perfectly. My items were mixed with the shrimp tasting fine, the lobster was overcooked and the scallops varied from one to the other as to their doneness and taste. All of my items were grilled and there were black carbonized pieces that I had to separate from my food. There was an unpleasant sauce, which I think was a mixture of butter with a herb sauce, that completely detracted from the flavor of the seafood. The spinach was insipid and the brussels sprouts were overcooked.

We were celebrating a special occasion and received a complimentary dessert of ice cream with a brownie. The brownie was overcooked and only tolerable with the help of the ice cream.

The service was a strange blend of familiarity, camaraderie (the waiter commenting, jealously, that he would dine with us if he had the opportunity) and condescension with a touch of arrogance. Then there was meaningless attention such as replacing the generous stainless steel bowl for the crab shell when it was less than one third full.

There are so many choices of dining in Vegas and Joe's shouldn't be one of them. Chose a restaurant where the chef is prominently featured so you know that someone is putting their reputation on the line. Joe's is a stale restaurant with a menu lacking any imagination and relies on a clientele that is clinging to a time gone by and don't know they could have a far superior experience at over 50 other restaurants on the strip, and spend less at the majority of them also.

I have dined at many high end restaurants around the world and it continue to amazes me that places such as Joe's can survive when there are so many excellent dining establishments where ever you may travel.",SUmngKNMH0bTrwtPez6hgQ,1,0,1,3RTmjAAKDAnLhENhyGTxoQ
917185,2010-09-03,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Good restaurant to try, but don't think I will be coming back.  I've tried the Joe's in South Beach several years ago and remembered being disappointed by the stone crab claws.  But, I thought maybe my tastebuds weren't ""matured"" yet so I'll give it another shot.  The stone crab was better than I remembered, but still not worth the $ - my favorite part being the mustard sauce that they served with it.  

My girlfriends and I shared all three cuts of their bone-in steaks (NY, filet, rib-eye), sweet potatoe fries, mac and cheese, and sweet corn.  The only cut that really stood out was the bone-in filet, which was perfectly cooked and was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  

Overall, the dining experience was pleasant, but I do have one major gripe.  As other yelpers mentioned, it's not exactly the cheapest place to eat, which I expected, but for the same reason, I also expected a high level of professionalism and service.  By the time we finished dinner, it was only 6:30 so the restaurant was pretty empty.  It was obvious that nobody was waiting to be seated at our table immediately.  I was pretty pissed when the bussers started to clear our table while we were working on splitting the bill.  It led to us having to reach over them and they having to reach under us, just a big mess everywhere.  Couldn't even get my purse without having to dodge around them.

- jumbo Alaskan king crap: it comes chilled served with drawn butter. They also cut it so that it is extremely easy to remove the crab from the shell, there is no mess at all. The crab was perfect and buttery. It was delicious and look forward to eating this again!!! 

-the miso sea bass: seriously beyond phenomenal! I have had miso before but put together with the sea bass and the way they prepared it it was hands down the best we have ever had. 

- 16oz sirloin: cook medium, husband thought it was good and cooked perfectly. It was served with a sea salt herb mix on the side that was a great addition to a typical ribeye. 

- lyonnaise side dish: if I were to describe this in simple terms it is a large hash brown with caramelized onions. However, it was the crunchiest hash brown (outside only) I have ever had...in a good way. Then it is topped with an amazingly sweet caramelized pile of onions. In all honesty I won't be getting this again because it want spectacular like the other Items we had. However, I did eat all the onions because they were that good. Also just to mention the portion was huge! We probably are 1/5 of the side. Although I can see a couple eating 1/3 if they were really hungry. 

-key lime pie: if you have never had real key lime pie made from real key lime juice then this is going to be similar to what you have had except that I notice it was more sweet than tart. The crust was extremely rich and buttery. If you have never had true key lime pie then you have to try this be it is really good. 

-banana fosters cream pie: this was my favorite dessert between the two (but only because the key lime I have had at other restaurants that were equally as good) it was a banana cream pie that was more cream than bananas topped with thick Carmel and candied pecans. For both desserts they offered half portions and between the two pies it was more than enough.

We started with bisque and calamari ($14.95). Both were excellent! The bisque was smooth as silk and the veggies had a nice bite. It'd only be better with more crab. Because everything is better with MORE crab. The calamari was tender and lightly breaded, and the cocktail sauce had a satisfying kick from the horseradish. 

After we gobbled that up, the real feast began. We dug into large crab claws ($59.95), seabass with bok choy, mushroom mac n cheese ($9.95), mashed potatoes and sauteed broccolini. It was all delicious! The claws are always out of this world. I generally prefer a hard sear on fish but this miso glaze was wonderful - a pleasant blend of sweet and salty.

Hubby and I had discussed well before we left for Las Vegas that we would try new restaurants this trip which meant skipping Joe's, but as we sashayed through the doors of the Forum Shops, there was Joe's smack dab in front of us, and he was calling our name . . . we thought there was no way on a Friday night without reservations we would get in without a long wait, but we looked at each other, each of us with puppy dog eyes, imploring each other to break the rule we already made and try to get into Joe's. Amazingly enough, they had availability for two in the back dining room in an hour which meant shopping a little longer than expected, but we were entirely grateful for the extra time to spend more money! Ha!

We really didn't have to look at the menu. We knew that a plate of select stone crabs was in order. As many others have said, they come in sizes from small to large and then ""select"". We always get the select. We are never disappointed. The stone crabs, meaty and succulent, are the star, but the mustard sauce is the kicker. Oh how I love that sauce . . . so much so that when I ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as my meal, I asked for the mustard sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. Hubby had the Chilean sea bass. It was the best we've ever had in any restaurant. We also ordered the four cheese mac and cheese which was so delectable and creamy. As an aside, you could pick any item from their list of sides and be thoroughly entranced.

Atmosphere at Joe's runs the gamut and can please just about anyone. They have the ""outside"" patio which provides a casual experience and is perfect for people-watching. Just about everyone who walks into the Forum Shops from Las Vegas Boulevard walks past you. There is the bar room and can watch your favorite game while you drink, dine and root for the home team. And then, my favorite, the back dining room which reminds me of an old Italian steakhouse where your servers are dressed in tuxes and provide some of the best service in Las Vegas. I love the maitre d at the entrance to the back room. Even if he doesn't recognize you, he pretends he does!  That's a real art!",qxmdrMmjTzgQhyHXKuyy3Q,3,0,4,-6-olxcOy1bgnCP39AxP4g

We were able to make a reservation for 10 the day of on pretty short notice, which I thought was great, since when we got there it was completely packed. I am a huge seafood lover so I was pretty stoked to try the stone crab.

The Service:
The service we received from start to finish was really great, and definitely gave you the white glove type of feeling you want when you are eating expensive food. Our waiter did a great job catering to everyone's tastes and even able provide a vegan option (an awesomely crafted cauliflower steak) for a couple people in our group that were vegan. He was also great in making sure no one had to wait for drink refills, and made great wine recommendations. I was set on ordering stone crab as an entree and he was able to talk me through the correct amount to order and explain to me how to eat them. The service was great and what I would expect from a nice steak + seafood place.

The Food: 
They bring out a variety of breads at the beginning of the meal, from biscuits to flatbread and everyone seemed pretty pleased. We ordered the spinach mushrooms for an appetizer and we were really impressed by the size of the appetizer and how great the mushrooms tasted. My husband ordered the New York strip for the main course, which was great and we both enjoyed the flavor. I thought the stone crab was okay, but I was wishing I had just ordered the king crab. I ended up with 2 jumbo claws, and while I thought this was definitely enough food for an entree, it was a lot of work to remove the shells and I ended up having to pick some shell shards out of my mouth in the process. I am not sure it was worth the trouble, because I didn't find anything particularly amazing about stone crab, but it tasted fine to me. We also ordered some potatoes Louie which I would not recommend because it was like a large fried ball of diced potatoes with onions on top, and didn't have too much taste. Everyone at our table seemed to like their meals - one raved about the scallops, and the lobster tails were a big hit. Also everyone loved the Mac and cheese side!

Overall this was a great place to go with a large group, and the service was fantastic. They catered to specific dietary needs which was great, and the menu was diverse enough to keep everyone happy.",4mHn9Z3aK9amRSZnLP-jKw,0,0,4,jFpJrzrMA_PkzG9DwyawaQ

It's expensive, but that's a given for any fancy Vegas restaurant.  Service is awesome with a really attentive staff, and the food is of course high quality in a very traditional way.  If you want something new and exciting this isn't the place for it, but if you want fresh, classic seafood and excellent steaks in a nice ambiance for some event, this is a great pick.

The waiter was very helpful with making wine recommendations for a white and a red.

Our group of 10 shared 2 of the Whale appetizer, each of which serves 4.  It comes with lobster tail, cocktail shrimp, crab, and scallop and shrimp ceviche.  No surprises here, just great classic chilled seafood.  The servings aren't too filling, but everything is super fresh.

The ribeye steak was also excellent.  Maybe not the best I've ever had in my life, but still really, really good and top tier.  Not much to say, just a very normal but perfectly executed steak.

For 3 bottles of wine, a few beers, 2 sides, 2 The Whale appetizer platters, and everyone getting their own steak or seafood entrees, it was $100/person for 10 people.  Expensive but still reasonable, and it was a very enjoyable meal.

Nuances that were so compatible, subtle, but dynamic~ They don't pan sear them like most I think, Seems they put this scoop on a broiler plate under the salamander, and gave the out side little bits of caramelization~ And I couldn't discern any filler at all!

The food was delicious at both sittings. You can't go wrong with either the steaks or the crab. The leyonaise potatoes we ordered as a side for dinner were outstanding.

Service was quite good and attentive at lunch, but was far less impressive at dinner. It took 15 minutes to get a drink order in after being seated. The place was jammed, but this needs to be better.

The tab for dinner for the 8 of us was about $1900. One of our group had a rewards card, but management declined to apply any credit to the card because another of our group paid for the dinner, in spite of the fact that the person with the rewards card had eaten at this restaurant three times this past week, having spent a few thousand dollars there in that week. While I agree that this makes sense, it was not handled particularly well by the staff. The waitress stated flatly, ""I can't do that. I need to keep my job. I have two babies to feed at home."" The manager did not really do any better- he just said flatly, no.

I ordered the medium plate of stone crab claws (their smallest choice @ $34.95) and also got the cup of crab bisque to start.  
The soup tasted nice, but the texture was off.  It looked like the fat was starting to separate out of the cream soup.  I know bisque is fattening, but I really don't want to see the oil slick at the top of the bowl.
My main disappointment was in the stone crab claws.  The texture of the crab meat was wet.  Now, I probably should have guessed that they would have been previously frozen, but somehow I expected them  to have a way of doing this that wouldn't hurt the texture of the crab so noticeably.  
The shell on stone crabs is quite thick, so they pre-crack the claws for you.  I don't remember ever having this problem before, but  with about every other bite, I was getting small bits of shell in my mouth  that I was then trying to discreetly spit out.  It just wasn't worth the $50 for my lunch.  About half way through the meal I grew tired of the crab and didn't even finish it.

Regardless, I love it there and I eat there almost every time I visit Las Vegas.  I usually get a stone crab appetizer assuming its the proper season.  The crab is always delicious although this past visit there were a few small pieces of shell that I had to pick out as I removed the meat (maybe this is normal?)  For my main course I usually have some type of fish and whatever I've had always tastes fresh.  My dining companions had fried shrimp which was crispy and yummy and another companion had a steak which was also up to fine steakhouse standards.  Side dishes were corn (among the best corn I ever had) and two types of potatoes.  I had key lime pie for desert which tasted like what I've had in Key West.  I was told it was made with genuine key limes which isn't the case with most restaurant versions.  While ordering, our server gave us the option of having two 1/2 sides of two different kind of potatoes when she saw we were indecisive of which to order.  A small touch like this goes a long way.  On that note, something that differentiates this restaurant from the rest is the service.  The service here is always top notch.

     Let's start with the food.  The stone crab claws were really good, very sweet and delicate.  The Kumamoto oysters were good, but not great.  I've had better in Seattle.  My seafood platter was good, but not great as well.  And it came out luke warm and got colder from there.  My wife's crab cakes were tasty but once again, were warm and not hot.  When I go out to eat and spend $600, I EXPECT to be wowed...I was not.
     And now on to my motivation to post this review, the service.  Maybe our server was having a REALLY bad day.  Perhaps, her husband couldn't take her attitude anymore and she had just received a divorce text from him merely seconds before she greeted us!  When my wife commented on how fast the oysters came out our server said, ""Yeah, they're oysters."" In a not friendly tone.  And when I asked to speak with the sommelier because I had a question about the grapes used to make our bottle of wine, she looked at me like I was a complete idiot and walked away to get the somm.  The service was prompt, we never waited for anything and always had everything we needed.  But her attitude was HORRIBLE!!  She never smiled at us once.  She was the most unfriendly server I've ever had.

They crack the shell up pretty good and you just have to peel away the shell and eat. The waitress said to just eat it like you would a hard boiled egg.

Apparently, the fishermen catch these crabs, cut off one of the claws, and then throw them back. The claws grow back and then they later get caught again.

I do recommend starting off the with some stone crab claws.

PROS: I can't speak on the steak because I don't eat red meat but the fish here is some of the best I've ever had. Next, you will never have to ask for your server because the moment you glance away from your table, one is in front of you, eagerly awaiting your request. 

CONS: For dinner, you'll need a reservation to guarantee yourself a table, on any night of the week.

HELPFUL TIP(S): If you are or plan on being a regular customer to any of their restaurants, get their reward card! (Mon Ami Gabi, Maggiano's Little Italy, El Segundo Sol, Eiffel Tower, etc.)

Stone crabs = Great appetizer!

Im sure any steak would be good there. Had the 12oz filet, medium.  And guess what? It was perfectly cooked medium. I could use a butter knife to cut my steak!

Then, when you think it couldn't get any better, our waiter brought over some steak spices. Just a tiny sprinkle on top of your meat and the flavor explodes! From that point on I cut my steak into even smaller bits and savored each one for some extra time. We nicknamed the spices ""Steak Cocaine!""

C had a cheeseburger and asked for it to be medium but it came out a little closer to medium rare which I know he wasn't happy about. J and I had the Joe's Classic Lunch which is five stone crab claws, hash browns, cole slaw and key lime pie. The stone crabs were sweet and didn't really need the dipping sauce that came with it. The hash browns were super crispy outside and flavourfully tender inside. The cole slaw was less successful despite the tableside dressing it got from our waiter - it was better than KFC but still a bit underwhelming.

To my surprise my friend Karen told me that there was one in Las Vegas.  So being the foodie that I am, I had to check it out.  Joe's decor is reminds me of a NYC steakhouse. Dark wood tables, chairs and floors.  The stone crabs are definitely the star in this place, hence the name.  The stone crabs come pre-cracked so the all the hard work is done for you.  The meat is sweat and very flavorful and pairing it with the honey mustard sauce is genius!  I had the scallops and the gf have the crab stuffed sole.  The scallops came out alone with a little green garnish and a little greasy.  For me, it was too plain.  I needed something to go along with the scallops, maybe a mixed green salad wtih balsamic vinegrette.  The crab stuffed sole was great, especially when dipped in the sauce.  The onion rings were good if you like them thin and stringy.  The mashed potatoes with the fontina cheese is to die for!  Granted were on a low-carb diet, but you have to try it.

We were promptly seated at one of the ""outside"" tables that are in the mall.  Our server was named Joe.  I wondered if that was a coincidence given the restaurants name but forgot to ask.  Joe was super friendly and after some small talk gave us a rundown of the menu and specials for the evening.  He also told us that portions were large so sharing is recommended.  We wanted to keep it light so we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a side of sautéed broccolini to share.  While we waited for the food we were sent out a bread basket and everything was delicious.  Our favorites were the pretzel bread, the cheese crisp and the corn bread.  The corn bread was amazing, you could taste the freshness.  Our fish was cooked perfectly and the Asian style sauce mixed with butter yielded some decadent mouthfuls that were perfectly balanced.  The broccolini was seasoned well served as a good compliment to the bass.  I would have loved to try a desert but we needed to head out.  Before we left Joe told us about a shortcut to get to Omnia that saved us a good deal of time in life.

To top it all off the crabs come already cracked for you. No more man vs. crab, a battle I've lost many times. You practically just slide the shell right off.   I left with no chipped teeth and without any scratches yea-ah. 

Also had a nice ahi salad and the crab bisque. Both were delicious.  A nice light lunch except for the Bloody Mary.

Service - superb. Our waiter was John he has been there 13 years and was super personable. Recommended items that weren't the most expensive on the menu and even did a suggestion that offered us more food and bang for our buck. Not every waiter does that so I really liked that. He definitely knew what he was doing and the food!

Bread basket was great they offered everything from muffins, rolls, pretzel buns and even crunchy type bread. 

I got the seafood platter it included lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp. I hate scallops but husband does and he said they were so moist and fresh. The shrimp was amazing and it was huge - 6 pieces of shrimp alone! The lobster tail was divine! Although it was burnt to a crisp a little.. only bummer of the entire meal which didn't stop me from 5 stars.

The filet was incredible husband got a 12 oz so we split with my platter the steak seasoning they bring you is good pile that stuff on! It definitely adds a spice to the steak in a good way! It was so tender and easy to cut into! Definitely would have gotten the filet next time.

Their mac and cheese is just divine something about the taste of the difference cheeses they gave was delicious we literally cleaned the plate on those. 

This was different but they had a side of hashbrowns it's not everyday you see this so we decided to try it and it didn't disappoint. Crunchy on top soft and mushy on bottom just perfection!

Then to top it all off it took FOREVER to get our food in a place that wasn't even half full.

The flavor and tenderness of the dry aged is worth the extra splurge.  I know this place is called stone crab, but the king crab legs are by far superior and they are well worth it.  Best crab legs in town and the meat is so much more flavorful in comparison to the stone crab. Brussel Sprouts are crispy, flavorful heaven. Salads are so fresh and delicious. Hash browned potatoes are mehhhh.  Service is always outstanding here.  Do yourself a favor and make a reservation for this place the next time you're in Vegas!  It is our favorite place to celebrate special occasions when we are in town!  Plus, they have menu items for all budgets.

My wife and I went for lunch around noon and the restaurant was about half full.  We ordered our drinks/meals and everything was fine at that point.  That is when the trouble started.

First off, any Joe's veteran knows about the crack-crack-crack method for easily eatable crab when done correctly.  However, my order of stone crabs appeared to be just CRUSHED with a sledgehammer.  I spent almost my entire time removing teeny tiny bits of shell from each bite I took.  It was terrible.  Secondly, about the time our food arrived, the restaurant was completely filled.  Not sure if they understaffed on purpose or not, but that was the result.  Drinks went unfilled, napkins could not be obtained, and the check took forever.

Having been to Joe's enough to know the potential, this was a severely dissatisfying experience.  As a general rule, when I am paying a premium (and at Joe's, you WILL pay a premium) for my seafood, I expect a quality meal that simply put, was not delivered for many reasons.

While 5-6 snow crab legs didn't seem like a lot when we first checked it out on the menu, the legs are actually really meaty and filling! The sea bass was flavorful and tender, but the seasoning didn't overpower the buttery taste of the fish. 

As for sides, we ordered the fried asparagus and shrimp and grits. Let me just say that I am a huuuuuuuuuge fan of creole food. You can imagine how excited I was when I saw that they had shrimp and grits on the menu. I was not disappointed! This place has the best Shrimp and Grits in Vegas and believe me I have tried everywhere. While everything is a la carte, the side dishes are big enough to be shared by 2/3 people (particularly if you order more than one).  Foodies typically approach restaurants with a ""one and done"" type attitude, but I definitely would eat here again!

The ambiance is very romantic. When I made the reservation, I walked in to find that they had a huge, round, dimly-lit booth reserved for us in the back.

After a couple days of culinary disappointment, I found myself very glad to have Saturday night dinner be at my place of choice.

The bread basket, though cold, was still enjoyable.

Appetizer: Crab bisque was delightful; rich, creamy, and filled with chunks of crab.
I was thoroughly satisfied.

Entree: My 20 oz bone-in rib eye, per James L.'s recommendation, was the piece of culinary delight I had been waiting for since my trip began. I was even lucky enough to have at least two bites of that delicious, creamy steak fat with the crispy edges. I enjoyed the steak so much that I intentionally spilled some steak juices on my shirt so that I could enjoy my steak later that night. 

Tip: Use the salt seasoning that accompanies the steak very conservatively!
Our server offered me a side of bernaise sauce which complimented the steak rather nicely ^_^

Dessert: Oh my my...
Key Lime Pie is one of my favorite desserts and Joe's is the best I've ever had!
The perfectly balanced sweet and sour, lime filling was supported by the most perfectly crumbly graham cracker crust...

I moaned so loud that an older couple turned around in shock/abhorrence;
I guess they did not deem such pleasured moans appropriate within of confines of the restaurant. My server, Darrel, however, was more than thrilled that we enjoyed our meals.

My friend got the ""Havanna Dream"" which was Joe's rendition of a Tres Leches cake that was almost as orgasmic as my key lime pie.

My portion of the bill only added up to about $80ish after tip... :)

My wife ordered the Seafood Chopped salad and I ordered the Salmon. We received our order in a timely manner, my wife order was correct and had a nice presentation. I looked at my plate and wasn't sure it was the right item but I assumed it was prepared with a sauce that coved it. As I took a bite I realized I received the wrong item.

Crab bisque - on the salty side, but a generous portion and great with the bread assortment. we could have done without it. 

Stone crab legs (medium) - 1000x yes! I got the smallest ones due to the lowest price but I didn't have a problem deshelling these and I typically don't eat crab due to that hurdle. 

Pork shank - For a turf choice, this was amazing. Fall off the bone tender and the rich red wine sauce was perfect. 

Creamed spinach - Salted perfectly and exactly what I wanted it to be. They give a good portion so was probably a heavy choice given the entrees we ordered though. 

Key lime pie - Packed with lime flavor! It is really a great way to end the meal, though the sourness did shock me in the first bite. Subsequent bites got better. Even though I was stuffed to the brim, I was able to stomach about half of it, due to the tart light nature. 

Service was impeccable. Never had to ask for a water refill! I'm that person who drinks a few cups (or several) during a meal. The waiter was friendly and gave us positive reinforcement after we ordered which left me excited to try the meal and I wasn't let down at all.

Actually, I can't remember if they were prepared to recipe, but they were both delicious.  Also, I like the ambiance of the place.

I vacationed in Florida 2 years ago, I tried to have dinner at the original Joe's but they were closed. Unfortunately, we only stayed in Florida for 2 days so I didn't get a chance to try it. Going to Vegas, I had to bookmark Joe's.
We went for dinner and it was beyond what I expected. The food was delicious and our server was exceptional. I ordered the medium stone crab claws. My husband ordered a lobster dinner (forgot everything he had) and fresh corn. I truly enjoyed the stone crab-they are served cold but I asked to have mine heated a little. Since it was the first time I've ever had stone crab, I did not know what too expect. They were not sweet nor did they taste like snow crab or king crab-they are a completely different taste and texture. But in a good way. 
What I could not get enough of was the fresh corn. I am not sure what blends of seasonings they put on them but they were amazing! I couldn't stop eating them. 
Our server was pretty awesome too, he gave great recommendations and he gave us a generous military discount but I don't remember his name. I would recommend this place to anyone.",o_X5E3mB4UKzax5dcWhIWA,0,0,5,GEJ7XHSiBcsDOZ53teZ8KA

You can tell that these waiters take their job seriously and they are all pros at it - they move around the restaurant like a well oiled machine.  It's hard to find places like that anymore but Joe's is one of them.  The stone crab is delicious and we always get them as an appetizer.

I came here with my family for dinner and had such a great experience. With superb customer service and top notch seafood, I wish I could give this restaurants 10 stars!

Crab bisque- smooth buttery soup filled with crab pieces. Just perfect to share.

Ahi Tartare- chunky pieces of ahi that were not overwhleming or too puny. Perfect in size. The ahi just melted in your mouth; not overly seasoned. 

Stone Crab- How can you not get stone crab here? It is famous...you almost want to bypass it, but you just can't resist. We got the select size since it wouldn't be too small nor too pricey! YOU MUST TRY THIS!  The crab piece just fell apart and it tasted so flavorful. 

Crab Cakes- This has got to be the best crab cake or just in par with Boston's Legal Seafood crab cakes. I don't even know what to say, but it is just tons of crab pieces and not much of a filler. You hardly ever get that anywhere. 

Alaskan King Crab Legs- You can technically buy this at any grocery store, but I wanted to see how different it would be in a restaurant. It is basically the same, serve chilled with a complementary dipping sauce. 

Seared scallops- huge scallops seared perfectly with a slight crust on top! BAM. the potato puree was the perfect addition.

Sea Bass with bok choy- you can never go wrong with sea bass. Sea bass' texture is always flaky and buttery. The sea bass probably literally melted in my mouth with every bite. 

Filet Mignon- you definitely can't go wrong with the filet mingon! perfectly grilled. Just enough tenderness and a smooth cut everytime you poke your knife in it! Flavor was on Fleek!

Key Lime Pie- Basically couldn't decide on which dessert. We heard raving reviews on the key lime pie, but their signature was the boston cream pie. The key lime flavor had the perfect balance of sweet and sour. Not one side was more overpowering than the other! I can just imagine eating another slice right now. 

Boston Cream Pie- I usually hate all that creamy stuff, but this you will not regret! The cream was light and fluffy, the cake could have been smoother but all in all, every bite was consumed

We only saw the outer part of the restaurant, which was part of the Caesar Forum Mall. But when we were ushered into the main dining room was when we realized this was a fine dining establishment.

We just HAD to try the Stone Crab Claws, their claim to fame. However, at $10+ for each delectable claw, we thought they were a tad overpriced. Would come back for their lunch special though.

The single Crab Cake was also pricey, but one of the best we've ever tasted. The top value was definitely the Surf and Turf dinner, consisting of two Maine Lobster Tails and a Petite Filet for $55. We like this dish here even better than the one at Maestro's Newport Coast!  The Lobster was tender and the Filet gave Del Frisco a run for the money.

The steak was cooked perfectly and the sea bass had a delicious miso sauce. The best item was the banana cream pie! Save room for dessert or get one to go! If you normally don't like desserts because you find them too sweet/sugary - this is the dessert for you.

I always try something new when i come and ive had some misses but mostly hits. The branzino is out of this world but dont expect the whole fish brought to the table. it was neatly fileted and i ate every bite.  This time i had the fried chicken and i heard a lot about it so i had to try it. some people will swear up and down its a must try and its tasty and crunchy but super salty. i could only finish two pieces before i threw in the towel. the fish and chips were nothing to write home about. they are a good stand by and done well.  as far as sides id pass on the bland Joannes mashed potatoes.

1419487,2015-10-23,13,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"This was quite a unexpected surprise - There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas and I've been fortunate enough to have experienced a fair share of them over the years. One of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked Joe's for dinner one night. I really never had the chance to read the reviews so I really walked in blind. We arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible. 

Our server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. I started with my usual Ketel One Martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. Although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. The way I see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. I validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.

I ordered raw oysters on the half shell for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of Tabasco and a hint of horseradish. There was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  We had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - I chose the Pork Belly Wedge Salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag blue cheese crumbles. Again I can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. The pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical BLT wedge salad so common at so many restaurants. 

Once we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. The steak and seafood selections are amazing and I'm sure anything I'd pick would be wonderful but the Prime Cut Bone-in Filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. It's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food. 

The entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. I decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately I've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any Steakhouse. 

These Bone-in, Prime Grade, Filet Mignons are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.Trimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. Unlike a Filet Mignon on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples I've ever cut into. After experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, Joe's far exceeded any expectations I had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!",a4mO387_O77ebmv8AlQB3A,22,20,5,AGDdlr5lCWIQSAM_Z3TEyA

The service here is simply outstanding, they are just on top of everything and work as a team...awesome. The food was amazing as I expected it to be: king crab, stone crab and grilled prawn appetizers all done to perfection and a very nice bread basket too. Entrees (steaks and seafood) were prepared perfectly and everyone enjoyed, no complaints, but there were a couple of exceptions. The mac and cheese side was disappointing. It was very small as compared to the other sides, we had them all to share. It was not very cheesy either. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was not good. Not sure what the heck is on top (almost like sour cream), they should revisit that recipe.....others seemed to think they were ok. 

Let me just say I applaud Joe's for providing a Gluten-free and Vegan menu in the first place, however you better bring it. I was sitting close to someone who ordered the pasta with seasonal vegetables and felt extremely sorry for him. It was literally dry fettuccine with dark vegetables, absolutely no sauce. It was not appetizing looking at all. Obviously not enough thought was put into that dish and a huge disappointment even for those who sat nearby, this person who chose not to complain got down as much as possible before giving up. He made the most of the apps and bread, but actually said he would something later....shame, but I do say he did not give them a chance to fix it or provide an alternative :(

As I scoped out the surrounding tables, there were many tables of folks that were obviously visiting for conventions, etc. Lot of food and drink ordered, but there was also ALOT of waste. I noticed several times plates with a good amount of food being removed from the tables (the appetizers which are shared) only to go straight into the trash. I asked our waiter to box up our leftover apps and took them home. I have contacted Joe's asking them to consider donating to Three-Square as so many other restaurants and casinos do, this is simply terrible for all that food to go to waste when there are hungry people in our valley. I hope they will consider and by example encourage the rest of the Ceasar's establishments to do the same.

One last note: Only a few opted for dessert - the apple pie ala mode, holey moley that was a meal itself. The person who ordered it did a very nice job polishing it off and was almost successful at keeping others to a single forkful. It was huge and looked amazing, totally chock full of apples and seemingly very cinnamony, with a thin crust (YAY!!), with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream....wow, I would highly recommend that, but you have to give up part of dinner, there is just so much food.

1438116,2017-03-31,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Had came here for dinner with some good friends after two had been wanting to come here since the later half of last year. Originally we loved going to SW steakhouse but they had recently increased their prices of our favorite rib-eye by almost $20, it was time to consider another place to try. One of our friends was coming to town with his girlfriend to attend a bachelorette party, so on the first night, before people arrived, we had gotten together for dinner. Reservations were made for 7 pm and apparently are dealt with separately from the front/bar areas. Majority of the party was a bit late but we were promptly sat at the far back dining room as soon as we arrived to check in at the other counter, inside the restaurant. I had originally thought the restaurant was a bit small, with a seating area outside, bar area, and maybe another dining room upstairs but little did I know, besides the areas noted, there were 2 more dining rooms in the back, and supposedly banquet/party style rooms upstairs.

Our waitress had came to us almost immediately as soon as we sat down and had told us about the specials while serving us two baskets of bread. The bread baskets included a few slices of raisin bread, a type of cracker (never know what these are actually called), pretzel bread, and a surprisingly moist and soft but sweet corn bread. 

One of the main items this restaurant is known for is the stone crabs. The stone crabs is a sustainable food item where they are heavily controlled and harvested only within specific size requirements. Best thing is, the crab stays alive and can regrow the claw after its removed. The crab claws at this restaurant are harvested from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 

The stone crabs are served as a cold appetizer with a light mustard-type of sauce. Prices are as follows as of 03/17/17. Medium (7 per order - $40), Select (6 per order - $50), Large (5 per order - $70). Between 4 of the 6 people in our party, we had ordered 2 orders of the ""select"" size, by recommendation of the waitress for being the ""best deal and most commonly ordered"" and easily sharable due to the even quantity. 

Flavor-wise, to be honest, I really don't know why these are ""better"" than any other crab. Clean tasting with its natural sweetness. Texture-wise, its fairly similar to other crabs. Less ""stringy"". If anything, my complaint would be they cracked it too much and it was a pain in the butt cleaning the shells off before eating. 

Prior to coming here, I had a problem deciding on what to order, besides the crab. 

There was a lot of sharing with our party. Sharing between 2 people. The couples shared amongst themselves, of course. By suggestion of the waitress stating their bone in filet is a signature item, I guess that's what I was getting. 

The bone-in signature prime steaks are hand-carved by butchers in house and aged for 24 days priced at $57.95 for 16 oz. The size of the filet was pretty big and the bone was fairly small. I never knew you could do bone-in for filet's and I've always seen filet's extracted as a whole tenderloin, mainly either as a filet or as a chateaubriand. Typically I never order filet mignon or buy it but as it was a recommended signature dish, I decided to try it, as I usually cook rib-eye's a lot. The filet has a great crust. For a signature dish, I actually had thought they'd do an amazingly perfect cook with minimal gradient. I've never cooked filet so I can't say from experience but I know its difficulty. Seasoned really well and as said before, great crust. The center was a very cool and pink, almost closer to rare than medium rare. Great flavor from seasoning and the meat itself. When i got closer to the center of the steak, i had to use the provided side seasoning salt, but very minimal. Best filet ive had (not saying much since I haven't had much hahaha) 

Double-cut Colorado lamb chops w/ mint chimichurri ($57.95) - this is what my friend ordered. As we were sharing, we had split halfsies on our orders. The order is almost like a full rack of lamb chops with the cuts at a borderline 3 bone cut. They state as double-cut because they cut so close to the bone on the outside bones. Paired with a great chimichurri sauce and a grilled lemon, it brings a bright flavor to the dish. Like the filet, great meat flavor and seasoning. Totally been craving chimicurri sauce lately too. One of the chops I had, the center was definitely raw-rare. Oh well xD better than overcooking my chop lol

Overall, not bad in terms of meat. Crab claws, may be over-hyped and over-priced. At least i tried it once. Would like to try their rib-eye maybe if I were to return.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,2,4,TM2-IcMo6AMW8gVXuatD3A

I have seen on it TV shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought I was going to be in for a treat. Unfortunately I was sadly mistaken. I went with the big crab legs and we had the creamed spinach, pan roasted sweet corn, mashed potatoes, lyonnaise with some oysters on the half shell. The oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the stone crab was a flop. Now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case I will research and try them again when they are in season. What will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. We had two tables with a total of 15 people. For the two tables we were given one waitress who was VERY slow. Forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. Overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant.

For appetizers we ordered calamari and crab cakes. Both of the appetizers were fantastic! Even the bread basket was delicious! This included various types of bread such as dinner rolls, pretzel bread, and a type of onion bread. 

As for the main dish, I ordered the Filet Oscar which consists of a 6 oz Filet Mignon, Asparagus, and Alaskan King Crab Legs. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because I was disappointed with the crab legs. On the menu it says Alaskan King Crab ""Legs"" not ""Leg"". It was very disappointing that they only gave one leg, especially since the crab was so appetizing! 

We also ordered the stone crab legs. This was my first time trying stone crab legs and I didn't know what to expect. I thought the stone crab legs were pretty good. It was just really different from what I'm used to. It has a bitter kind of taste, I can't exactly pinpoint it. 

Another reason why I deducted a star was because on the bill they automatically add 18% for tip. Before we got the bill we were planning to tip more than 18%, but we were kind of disappointed when got the bill. I feel that a person should tip at least 10%, and if the service is excellent then that determines how much more a person should tip.",3zf53USnWVkoESWD-RswJA,1,0,4,n-WqatDImaUZJ8dM6KjoFw

The Las Vegas location is exceptional. The dining areas are upscale white table-clothed spaces with a clubby feel. You can go with a jacket or without and fit right in.

I had the famed stone crab for an appetizer. It was good, but I may have experienced a little chalky flavor/consistency at the extreme tips of the claws. I would attribute this to the fact that the height of stone crab season is January/February and I had my visit in April (frozen?).

For the entrée I had salmon drizzled with a maple glaze that jumped off the menu at me immediately. (I never would have thought of maple on salmon). It was very interesting - and good - with the salmon cooked medium (perfect). The table shared hash browns (for which Joe's is also known - and rightly so) and corn.

I am referring to our waitress who fell into the trap of thinking we couldn't afford the meal at hand. Her explanation of what would be ideal to order was a bit confusing. I did appreciate the story of the restaurant though.

A pretty nifty bread basket comes out before the meal started. We had decided to share the large stone crabs which was enough for 3-4 bites per person (total 5 people). Soon after, our entrees (I got the bone-in ribeye) came out with the delicious sides. The hands down favorite of the table had to have been the garlic spinach which had roasted pieces of garlic on top. The mac and cheese and the fries were good as well. Beware of the salt condiment that comes out with the steak, if you make the mistake of adding just a bit more than you need, your steak can end up like a salt lick.

I'd probably skip over the stone crabs and try their other thing they are known for (Alaskan king crab) and share my steak along with some sides the next time around. In any case, I enjoyed what I ate.",bW6VMyB5r05Yze44Ora0pA,0,0,4,dAA4TQEjijX5818wCKro_Q

Came here to celebrate a birthday dinner with a couple friends. Made reservations online and was running a bit late on time. But they were cool.  Also, this place is a little tricky to get to if you don't know your way around Caesar's. 

This easiest way to get here is if you take the metal doors from the ""emergency exit"" between the forum shops and casino on the left side if ur coming from the forum shops. Then you walk down what looks like the employee entrance exit and follow to the left of the hill. Once you reach the forum shops entrance on the ground level, enter through the side entrance and follow the signs to joes. Which is the first restaurant you will see once u enter * (out of breath)

Food is OK I guess. I felt a little tourist trappy here while eating for some reason lol. Not sure why. My wagyu was too fatty for me to enjoy fully and the stone crab legs were hard to eat and had no taste. IMO.

My companion ordered medium crab claws and was allowed to order fewer than a normal order.  She enjoyed them but did say it was difficult to get the meat out.  It was her first time to try these so she may not have been familiar enough!

I ordered said legs, and our waiter took the liberty of bringing me the smaller portion, with the explanation that he thought I might want to start with the smaller plate, as I could always order more if I wanted. He was so right, my eyes being much bigger than my stomach, even though the king crab was really excellent. (And nicely pre-cracked so I could maintain a delicate and girly demeanor while wielding the little crab fork.)

We shared a bottle of champagne, very nice, and the stone crab appetizer. Stone crab is the specialty and great, though I preferred my legs. Someone at my table ordered oysters, also very good.

I tried to get him to smile, but this guy was stone cold. We were dropping a fat wad of cash too, can you at least pretend to be happy that we are there?

The food was pretty bad. The house favorite, butter seared scallops were god awful. As was the veal. The fish sandwich looked like something you got at a fast food joint.

After reading all of the positive comments from fellow Yelpers and on Opentable, I finally decided to give it a shot.  

The host/maitre'd was such a friendly fellow that made you feel so welcomed.  He is perfect for his position.  He welcomed us in and offered us an inside seat or an outside seat - we chose inside, as I was  not into watching all of the shoppers on the outside.  Cozy setting on the inside.  

Was I wrong about this place.  It was so freakin' good.  The first offer you 5 different kinds of breads - who would think a place like this  makes their own breads?!  There was a ciabatta, lavosh, olive bread, pretzel roll and a dinner roll.  I was impressed.  

We had to try the Stone Crab - pricey - $10 a crab, we had the large size - server's recommendation.  You can order as many as you want.  Don't have to go by what's printed on the menu.  She said it fell off the shell better.  It was really tasty and the mustard sauce was really good.  I am not a saucey person, but it certainly complemented the crab.  

We had the Manhattan Clam Chowder and the Caesar Salad next.  Both were also very good.  I had the salmon next and it was outstanding.  It was a special of the day.  It was cooked to perfection.  

The best part of the meal was dessert - the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream was soooo good.  You can order a 1/2 slice of pie - my recommendation.  But the best dessert was the Peppermint Ice Cream with the Hot Fudge.  Hot Dang!!!!  This was the best ever.....  This hit the spot and made this my favorite place to dine.

Had a tremendous Englishwoman as our server. She was sassy and knowledgeable and provided impeccable recommendations (how many crab claws to get, suggested that I get my bone in filet medium as opposed to my usual medium rare to avoid a cool bone).

The large crab claws were impressive and generally amazing. The bone in filet had a wonderful crust. Even the chopped salad was really well executed.

It's easy to eat here when it's covered by work. Between the three of us, we dropped $600 (the other two fools kept on ordering quality scotch... I was super jealous as I wasn't drinking but that's another story). So yeah I wouldn't come here if you're looking to save a penny or two.

This place makes me drool just thinking about it. I love seafood, and with that being said, Joe's has ah-mazing crab legs. I've been here one other time a couple years back and remember the service being impeccable. (Literally, picked up a glass of water and by the time we set it down someone was there to refill it.)

This time we waited about 10-15 minutes after arriving right on time for our reservation at 8:30pm. We were seated in a cozy corner. Suzanne was the one who took care of us and she was great! She really knew the menu and gave us great advice on which wine we should pair with our food.

We ended up ordering a half order of the King Crab Legs as an appetizer, and they cut it fresh at the table. They were so easy to eat; all I had to do was lift off the outer shell and the meat fell out. It was so sweet and succulent. (Haha, another one of those dishes that I couldn't wait to eat, so there is no picture)

Then we had the 12oz Filet Mignon (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uMtv5iEcifz9Jz4yFgtbsA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw) cooked at Medium. They brought it out sliced for us to share (neither one of us were as hungry as we thought). We were also advised by Suzanne that the sides are very big so that we should probably do two half orders. We had corn and mashed potatoes (you see them both in the picture). 

Suzanne also had advised that the house wines were great choices, so we ordered a red and a white. (Pinot Noir & Sauvignon Blanc) Both paired wonderfully with our meal.

I'm not sure what they crusted over the mashed potatoes, pretty sure it's something cheesy. But whatever it is, it made the mashed potatoes to die for...

Lastly, for desert we decided to try the Havana Dream Pie (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=s_nMDYnX3GWgbQkpAthbWg&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw) I can't remember if she had said it's like or it is Tres Leches Cake. It was pretty good, I'm not big on desserts so it was alright.

1569310,2016-11-29,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"This review is for an event in the private room upstairs. 
The servers were overall very attentive and friendly. The food was excellent quality and quantity. Our mea began with The Whale served family style. This was comprised of Alaskan king crab, Lobster tail, Jumbo shrimp cocktail, and shrimp & scallop ceviche. The only awkward aspect was the lack of spoons to serve the cocktail sauce and ceviche onto one's plate. The quality of the seafood was outstanding, though :) The servers also came around with small silver carafes (like a little coffee pot) filled with melted butter to pour into little dishes at your place!

Next came two truly delicious salads. The Caesar salad was to die for delicious. But sadly there was not enough of it to go around our table. We also had a chopped vegetable salad very lightly dressed with a creamy vinaigrette. This salad was so delicious, too! It was mostly chopped veggies like green beans, jicama, carrot, cabbage, etc. The flavors and textures were perfect!

For the entree each guest had a choice of:
Herb Roasted Chicken (did ANYONE actually order this???)
Colossal Lump Crab Cakes (looked A-Mazing!!)
Salmon Au Poivre - orange, fennel & radish
Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon (This was the thickest tuna steak I have ever seen!) - crispy potato cake, spinach, mushroom, & red wine bordelaise.
Chilean Sea Bass - miso glaze, bok choy & shiitake mushrooms.
Petite Filet Mignon- 8 oz.

I had the Chilean Sea Bass and although the bok choy and mushrooms were seriously lacking, the fish (which is the star) was terrific! It was a generously sized portion, not over seasoned, nor over cooked. It was a treat! 

::vegetarian and gluten free options were also available::


Sides served family style were:
Jenny's Mashed Potatoes
Four Cheese Mac & Cheese
(There were three dishes each of these per table of 9, so there was plenty!!)

I skipped the Mac & Cheese due to the heavy dairy, so I can't rate it. The potatoes, however, were delicious. They did have a crumb topping on them, though. Something a person avoiding gluten would never expect. You've been warned ;)

The desserts were really just okay. A tray was brought out with small petite-four sized pieces of Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Fudge Pie, and Havana Dream Pie. I expected to have a dessert that would inhabit my dreams upon tasting the Havana Dream Pie, but it didn't. It lacked interest for me. It seamed like a sponge cake sliced with a pastry cream filling.

1598480,2013-10-30,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"As a person who has never had lobster bisque in his life, married to a woman who is allergic to shellfish, I didn't expect to be ordering a bowl of it and enjoying it so much. I can honestly say this is the best lobster bisque I've ever had! It's also the only, however, so I should clarify that by saying it was very very good, even if it was a poor example of what a lobster bisque should be. 

The wife had fish tacos, which she devoured so I will assume that means they were delicious. I had the fish and chips, which was absolutely excellent. I've had plenty of fish and chips in my life so I've got some frame of reference here. Very very good.

The absolute crown jewel dish of the night wasn't even a dish at all. It was the tartar sauce that came with the fish and chips. The tartar sauce was without a doubt, far and away, bar none, the best I have ever had. Without question. Absolutely and incredibly delicious.

The sides we ordered were also very good, the fries and potatoes we got were cooked well and tasted fresh. My only issue was the asparagus. The asparagus itself was good but came out covered in tomatoes which was NOT good at all. This was because of my personal bias against tomatoes in most things. The wife loves tomatoes and ate a few pieces with no issue. Although I expected her to eat more, so perhaps it wasn't so great for her either.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,0,0,5,uP2AkYsW7XXSTKjgwkrgww

Their steaks (the boys both had filets) are always cooked to perfection and the girls last night we each had ahi steaks. Which were also some of the finest tuna steaks around and again cooked to perfection!! My ahi was more customized for a more Asian flare upon request and my friend had the tuna off the menu and both were excellent!! We also both shared salads (which is easy to do as their salads are huge) so for the table we had a Joe's chop and a regular chop salad and both were perfectly dressed and delicious!

Main reason was due to the combination of both a seafood grille and steak house! We made reservations through Open Table for 7:30 on a Thursday. And we arrived 30 minutes late, why you might ask?! Because the dam can driver dropped us off in front of Caesar's palace and Joe's is located on the other side in the mall! With extremely sore feet the staff at Joes had no problem seating our late party. 

After being seated our waiter advised of specials and what stone crabs they had available. Just like many steak houses, items are served al carte and you can order side dishes to share. I settled on a Caesar Salad, Crab Bisque, and the 1 lb. of Stone Crab claws served with the famous Joe's mustard dipping sauce. Three people in our party ordered the bone in ribeye, while the other two ordered Crab stuffed Sole and Filet Mignon. 

With glasses of vino in hand we all chatted while waiting for our food to arrive. To our surprise our wait was very short! Salads arrived 1st and shortly after all our food was being served! Caesar salad was tasty, I always love it when it's served with anchovy...adds a saltiness. My crab bisque was sweet and savory, lots of flavor but could have used a bit more crab on the top. Stone Crab stone crab... Where have you been all my life?! My brother in law and I dove in, though my belly was getting full I had to eat this sweet wonderful crab meat. The claws come cracked so after you pull a few shells away, the meat is exposed and dunk away in the mustard sauce. The sauce was tasty but I preferred the crab with a bit of lemon. The ribeye and filet eaters loved the sear on the cut and raved about not only the tenderness but also the perfect way each was cooked!

Service was wonderful. Our waiter knew his stuff and checked on us often. Lol he earned the mandatory 18% tip for our table of six! And Whoop Whoop, he brought us complimentary deserts to share since it was our 1st time!!!

I had the Salad Nicoise, which was good but not great. My friends all had the seafood salad and raved about it. The best part of meal was dessert. Their pies are over the top. We had coconut, peanut butter, the chocolate (mousse?) pie and a pie/cake item that no one can remember the name  of, but we all remember how good it was.

Tops Morton's and even Mastro's.  It tops all my other Joe's experiences, also.  All the stars were aligned and EVERYTHING was perfectly cooked and tasted like a dream.  

1.  Kushi Oysters on a half shell - These are my favorite type of oysters.  Slightly sweet with a firm meaty texture.  They were on the smaller side size wise, but the flavor was great.
2.  Select Stone Crabs with Joe's Mustard Sauce - Stone crabs are always awesome.  They're already cracked for you and you dip it in their rich and creamy mustard sauce.  With it being so creamy and rich, it's almost as if they whipped it with butter and cream.
3.  Bone-in Filet Mignon - We ordered this ""rare plus.""  It was eye rolling fantastic.  Super tender and cooked to perfection.
4.  Sweet Corn (Pan Roasted) - the sweet corn just barely charred and tossed in oh so fabulous butter.  buttaaahhhhh
5.  Havana Dream Pie - This is not regular pie.  This is pie on crack.  It consisted of white cake soaked in sweet milk, topped with freshly whipped cream and drizzled with butterscotch syrup.  

Conclusion:  Joe's out did themselves last night, and I am floored.  Eye rolling good.  Usually they're already fantastic, but last night was exceptional.  Hope the future experiences keep up with this one.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,4,3,5,yyOT8bX4QCuvmBSx85Tyog

They have a fun assorted bread basket that comes out first and I always love that since I'm a carb freak.  The service was top notch, very professional and attentive so we appreciate that.

The drinks are pricey... $15 for a cranberry & Grey Goose... but they're stiff!!!  The food is rather reasonably priced for a rather high end seafood/steak restaurant in Las Vegas.  

I had the stone crab appetizer, my husband had the Joe's Cole Slaw, we split the 12oz filet and the Big Daddy's Potatoes (not on the menu so I'll describe... they're hashed browns sitting on a bed of caramelized onions then topped with loaded baked potato innards... must must must try!!!).  For dessert I had the Havana Dream Pie (white cake with a custard filling and an uber-thick drizzle of dulce de leche on top... again, a must must must try!!!)  and hubby had the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. 

Our food total was under $90 which is not expensive for the quantity and quality of food.  It was my birthday so they brought out a complimentary brick of flourless chocolate cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is then topped with hot fudge.

Service is always professional and you feel special. So it is perfect for impressing people or making it a memorable special occasion, such as a birthday or anniversary.

My favorite is the Grilled Madagascar Shrimp, one shrimp is like a meal in itself.   Creamed Spinach is a good side, I prefer their Snow Crabs over Stone Crabs, but you will not be disappointed with either, because they are by far the freshest you ever had. I recall having to ask for drawn butter one time, which they happily provided, but not sure they forgot it or if I really had to ask for it. 

The wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. The somm(s) are great.  While most Somms will not recommend a Reds don't go with seafood, we started with a fruit forward California Red that is delicious on its own as an appetizer, while waiting for your crab and seafood,. Of course if you get steak or other meats then by all means  get it a red with the meal.  The wines by the glass are excellent.  I prefer sparkling with seafood since it goes well with just about everything, except super spicy.

The waiter recommended the fish and chips for me while my husband got the seafood salad. Of course, we had to just try their signature stone crab legs. They were quite pricey for 2 legs ($7 per leg I believe) but the meat inside was very fresh and the sauce it comes with is awesome. I would recommend getting 1 each just for the experience but not a whole plate full.

The fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had. You could tell the fish was fresh and the batter very crispy but not overwhelming most of the fish. The truffle fries were also super tasty and my hubby kept stealing some. His salad had a good amount of seafood piled on top but for the price of $22, he would have been better off ordering fish.

Food:
Bread basket- great start to the meal since we really liked the bread basket.  We liked the parmesan crisps/sheets, and ended up asking for more.

Stellar Bay oysters- SO Good!  Another reason to visit Vancouver sometime soon.  Perfectly briny and extremely fresh, I could've had a dozen by myself, easily.

Dry aged bone-in rib eye- we asked for medium rare, and it was a little more cooked than we would've liked, but man, was it good.  Tender and juicy, we enjoyed it to our last bite.

Jenni's mashed potates- Can't go wrong with mashed potatoes. Yum.

The star of the meal, stone crabs- Delicious!  Succulent, meaty, and sweet!  Really liked the dipping sauce too.  We ordered the large, and it was 5 big claws for $65.  Pricey?  Yes, but you don't eat stone crabs everyday.

Service was top-notch - all the servers wearing tuxes were attentive and expert at breaking and pre-cutting the king crab legs.  Our main waiter Patrick was awesome and very sociable.  Here's a guide to having an awesome, memorable dinner at Joe's, especially with a party of 6:

1. Have them prepare an appetizer plate with 12 large stone crab claws and 3 king crab legs (break into halves).  Some of the sweetest shellfish you'll ever had, and still having nice texture.  Shells peel off with minimal effort.  When I told my family I booked Joe's at Caesar, they almost expected plastic bibs and wooden mallets.  LOL!

2. Ask for more cornbread!  The pretzel is also good but that cornbread is soft and filled with corn for sweet and jalapeño for heat.

3. Each person orders an entree.  My ahi filet mignon was truly massive, almost the size of a big fist.  Good outer sear and pink, tender center.  Mom got the lighter option with four sea scallops on potato cake.  Wife and Dad each got the Miso-Soy sea bass which was really good this time - still a bit rich but they eased up on the sauce which is good.  Sis and bro-in-law each got the Grilled Seafood Platter which is a solid choice if you want more shellfish: half lobster, shrimp, and scallops.

4. Share a few sides: broccolini (2 orders), sweet potato with praline butter (almost like dessert), and lyonnaise potato (like a gigantic hash brown with caramelized onions on top).

5. Lastly, share some pies for dessert.  We got the key lime (signature dessert) and butterscotch chiffon.  Since we were also celebrating dad's birthday, Patrick sent us a chocolate brownie ice cream cake with a lit candle.  Now that's service!  Be sure to enjoy with espresso or their black coffee.

It was our last dinner of our 3-night Vegas stay.  Between eating at Twist, L'Atelier, and Joe's you could say we went 3 for 3.",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,12,8,5,TMy-MjnLuPPgcyjK6R2T5g

I started with the crab bisque. It is served at the table with a really cool presentation. To be perfectly honest, it was the best crab bisque I ever put into my mouth. No hyperbole intended. Hubby had the BLT Wedge salad and it is full of wonderful elements, including delicious pork belly (really) and chunks of perfectly aged blue cheese. An accidentally ordered Caesar Salad was fabulous--again another to add to my ""most delicious"" for the evening. The Seafood Platter was filled with two lobster tails, big juicy shrimp and tender, moist scallops--all cooked exactly as they should be.

My dining experience can be best described as mediocre. Great intentions, questionable execution. I really wanted to like this restaurant but my expectations were not met. Two of the things I absolutely love is steak and seafood. When you have a restaurant that is known for both, you'd think this is food heaven. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. 

Bread basket- I usually don't talk about the bread but this one deserves it's own review. It is delicious. The variety is great. The pretzel mini loaf is really cute. 

Filet mignon- sadly, it is unimpressive. It had a slight off flavor to it and too salty. And a pet peeve of mine at steak houses is when I asked for steak to be on the rare side, it comes out dry and well done. 

Alaskan king crab- also quite salty as well and nothing special. Served with lemon and butter. 

Jennie's mashed potatoes- Not too bad but it also wasn't memorable either. 

Lyonnaise potatoes- Pretty good. I enjoyed eating it. 

Key Lime Pie- signature dessert was okay. Not my personal preference. 

Havana Dream Pie- Yum. This one is delicious. Might be a bit too sweet but still good. Served with slices of strawberries. It is soft, creamy, and sweet. 

Banana Cream Pie- This one is my favorite dessert. It is delicious. Not too sweet. Great banana flavor. light and airy. 

The service here is friendly and efficient. A tad bit unrefined and awkward at times. Slapping a spoon on a plate and served our side dishes cafeteria style. An elbow almost knocking someone out. And taking someone's eating utensils while they were still using them. Maybe I'm being overly picky but I'm comparing the service with other $$$ restaurants and it does lack a certain refinement.

As you guys can tell from some of my previous reviews, I am sure somewhere in there I have gone to AYCE buffets that have crab legs, and I will say I have honestly never had ""premium"" crab legs, and there is a difference. 

I also had the Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon, that was excellent.

The stone crab got me going though. The taste was superb. I never had them before, and was really impress...to the point that I just placed my first order for Stone Crab yesterday since it is now Stone Crab season.

The Crab Legs were great as well. The meat was so thick I go full off maybe 2 or 3 of them. Usually at the buffet I will have many many plates of crab legs, but for some reason I was stuffed off only a few of these, the Stone Crabs and my ahi tuna steak.

Overall, paired with some good wine and people, this location got me. I don't know what the bill was, I am sure it was a pretty penny with a few bottles of wine flowing, but I am sure it was up there.

One thing is to know about Stone Crabs, if you don't is that seasons is from October 15th to May 15, so me eating here in September, I must have had frozen stock or they pulled the stone crab legs from another vendor, not sure. It was good either way.",Px6w_kTNBuy0GceThHnccw,0,0,4,yk-wLIZbXHN7tKuDsS4_6g

We started off with the shrimp and scallop ceviche. That was amazing. Nice presentation and even better flavor. We then ordered our main courses. My girlfriend ordered the fisherman platter grilled and I ordered the petite filet with lobster tail and a side of sautéed brocollini. In the meanwhile I sipped on a Lagavulin 16 Islay Scotch. Very nice scotch.

       My son's shrimp and pasta dish were not only great tasting, but, unlike what happens all too often, filled with shrimp. My wife's crab cakes were almost entirely crabmeat, but still retained structural integrity. They were among the best she ever had. 
     I have to be honest-I don't eat seafood. I didn't want to be a party pooper, so I went along, praying I could find something-anything-palatable. I'm glad I did. 
     The New York Strip, medium rare, was among the half dozen best steaks I have ever eaten.
     If you want an entrepreneurial opportunity, buy their recipe for steak seasoning. I understand they do bottle it and sell it in some stores. Get it into Giant, Acme, Gristede's, Publix, Winn-Dixie and a few others, and you can retire. I never use toppings on steak. Am I glad I decided to try it tonight-it was amazing!
     The cottage fries took home fries up a quantum level. Shaped like potato chips but thicker, they were more seared as opposed to fried, trapping the moisture within. The fried tomatoes were out of this world-tomatoes layered with melted cheese and spinach. 
     The key lime pie convinced me I had never eaten key lime pie before. Every other piece in my life was a pathetic imitator of the magnificent creation on our table.A cleat, light taste of lime, not overly creamy nor too sweet, with a robust consistency-the recipe let the ingredients shine through.
     Our server, Perry, enhanced the meal, from his assistance with the wine selection to dessert and coffee. His stories about the restaurant and about Las Vegas over the years were wonderful.

The food was delivered quickly and this was arguably one of the best prepared steaks I have ever had. This review could have gone in another whole direction because my wife's barbecue brushed salmon had bristles that came of the brush that stuck to the top of her fish. I called our waiter over. He apologized, walked ever so briskly into the kitchen and resolved the whole issue quickly and with the most sincere apology. He even assured us that he went right to the chef and had all of the brushes removed and replaced with new ones. 

The salmon was replaced, my wife said it also was prepared perfectly, and without my asking, the restaurant removed her meal from the bill and also offered her a free desert.

We had some bread.. (ok, I normally don't eat bread so it was actually my partner who ate bread). It kind of disappoints me when some places serve cold bread :(. Well, it wasn't cold, but bread usually tastes better when it's warm in my opinion.

We got the Stone Crab appetizer I think. 7pc of deliciousness!! I wish I had some in front of me right now. I wonder, does the body of a Stone Crab taste good? Where is the body?? It'd be a waste of delicious crab meat if the Stone Crab body IS edible, yet not sold :(

Caesar salad was good. But it's just caesar salad.

My petite filet came out. It was a nice medium rare but for some reason I didn't like the sear on the edges of my steak, I think it was too tough for me or .. something. It was still good though. 

The partner got a nice hunk of meat! NY Strip! Holy moly this piece of meat was THICK!!!!! He looked very satisfied when he devoured it.

The server boasted that it was a big full flavored cab. The sommelier actually hid the bottle from us when she poured. Once we agreed that the wine wasn't turned, the sommelier ran off. Reading the bottle it was obvious that it was a blend and not a true cab. The server kept calling our wives ""young ladies"" which is fine if you don't repeat it about 19 times during the meal.

But be warned, they are all a la carte and run about 10 bucks each.  Enough to share though.  Sadly, the skirt steak prevents a 5 star review.  Underseasoned and just not up to the standards set by the rest of the meal. If course, that was mine and I recognize my mistake.  Skip the turf, stick with the surf and you should really enjoy Joe's. Bring your wallet, it ain't cheap but not out of line for the venue and the menu.  Finally, do not skip dessert.  We shared the banana creme pie with fosters sauce and it was outstanding(but there were a whole host of other choices we wish we could have tried).",tytLLwNx5uWW22ri-xK93g,1,0,4,mSutOEdEotFQOxo2j5HCTg

 you can choose from a series of sizes of crab, we went with the premium or middle-large size of crab. 

i've never had stone crab before but it is just the most sweet buttery delicious crab in the world, without any sense of brininess to weigh it down. it is simply heavenly. 

the steamed arms are brought out cold and cracked with big full pieces of crab meat in each joint of the arm served with a bit of mustard dipping sauce... no need for any sauce just take the crab flavor straight as is, it is just beautiful.

and just so you know stone crab are protected and only one limb is harvested at a time so that they can keep one arm to survive... and this does not kill the crab and their arm grows back with time. for you eco geeks out there that means that it is a sustainable food and good for the survival of the stone crab.

i cannot wait to go to florida to try it again near the source, one can only imagine how much better it can be!

as far as joe's of las vegas, there are two areas, more formal dining in the back and casual patio front both areas with the same menu.  we had reservations and were seated in the back room...it was very traditional and formal, all beautiful wood paneling and ultra lush carpeting and cushy seats...a tad too stuffy for my liking but i tend to enjoy more casual friendlier service and my dirty dives. we ordered prime rib along with the stone crab everything was delicious, service impeccable.  

joe's also delivers stone crab from florida you can go to their website to place an order. we received a gift set a few months after my first experience and it was excellent as well!",-VJNfbAXW-0He6iE0A6Qtw,0,0,5,IEuzZbeJsvt4l15f_mkgnQ
1974519,2011-07-04,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"This is another stop on my ""must see Vegas"" list. I really can't say enough good things about this place. If you were like me and had never even heard of stone crab before, then you have to come here. If you're a little more budget-conscious (if such a thing exists in Vegas) go for lunch because they are usually running great lunch specials where you can get stone crab, they're melt-in-your-mouth potatoes, a side of tomato and a dessert for a very reasonable price. If you want to splurge, check it out for dinner. Both times it has a great swanky yet casual vibe. But for either one...be sure to make a reservation.

I've been going for about 3 years now and it's always been the same host standing at the front podium. He even recognizes my mom and I when we come. The waitstaff has been the same for a long time too which is nice when you come back to a place annually and you see the same friendly faces.

I recommend the large stone crab (it's a bit of an effort to eat I warn you). But once you get inside those shells, the buttery deliciousness that awaits will make it all worthwhile. Order any one of their many kinds of mashed potatoes...there's nothing like them. And for dessert, everything is good but the key lime pie...WOW! It's the perfect refreshing finisher on a hot summer Vegas day too.

I started off with the stone crab bisque. It was quite tasty, so I expected everything else to be good as well, but it wasn't.

I had the grilled fisherman's platter. Getting a dish like this tells you alot about the quality of their seafood. There's no sauces, seasonings, or extra flavors to hide behind. Just cooked fish and maybe a little butter and lemon. Well, it wasn't good, the seafood wasn't fresh, and it wasn't properly cooked either.

Onto the roasted chicken. Somehow it was dry and greasy at the same time. I guess I shouldn't have gotten a chicken dish at a seafood restaurant.

Service was pretty excellent, but the food was a letdown. Stick with the stone crabs I guess, and you probably won't be disappointed.",1enE_XZSUwMzuDmxCNiWZg,1,0,2,v7KXH0QDTOi4n3-joK1ZzA

2008436,2009-12-07,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"We came here on a Saturday night in December, a party of 6.  We made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  It ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.

Decor: 4.5/5  Clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  We sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that I noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  The seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  Poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.

Service:  5/5 Service here was fantastic.  The waiters (I didn't see any waitresses) were all in Tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  Plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  Amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a Jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (Some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)

Surf: 4/5 I didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  The stone crab pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  The mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  I was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  I wouldn't feel the need to order that again.

Turf: 4/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the Petite Filet Mignon -- strangely I think only one of us finished it.  I guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5/5!).  The meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  I think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  The fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)

Side Dishes: 3/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  Ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) The creamed spinach could have been entirely skipped.  It was flavorless.  2) The Mac n Cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  If you're in the mood for Mac N Cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  Then again I think I've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my Mac N Cheese now... 3.  Jennie's Mashed Potatoes.  The crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  It was strangely dry though.  My idea mashed potatoes have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  Worth ordering  4) The sweet corn was surprisingly great!  I usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  I think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.

Dessert 5/5: We ordered the Key Lime Pie.  All their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a Florida restaurant -- we decided on the Key Lime Pie.  It was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best Key Lime Pie I've ever had.  I finished most of the pie even though I couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person I am!).  The coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but I think starbucks is good so I wouldn't know.  Sorry!

Overall, it was a great meal.  If I went back to Vegas I'd probably want to try a different restaurant but I certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  The meal ended up being a final cost of  $78/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine). 

I'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  Apparently, you can get Joe's delivered to your house.",mkxCw6GsMZDu-44_aCQTHw,0,0,4,KfIwx7Kt6l3D-knhpquNcw

One star for atmosphere, one more for the food. There really is nothing outstanding here and it's expensive. Perhaps upwards of $60 for a ribeye is standard these days, but to me that's a freakin' ripoff.

One of my dining companions, who lived in FL for many years and had regularly been to original branch of Joe's in Miami, said this did not stack up. 

The claws were decently prepared and the mustard sauce for dipping was tasty, but I've been to other similar restaurants that are far better. For $100 per person, including tip with an average of one drink and a dessert split by the entire table of 6, it felt overpriced for what we received.

While perhaps a few years ago, before the economy went south, it would seem that the prices being charged were symptomatic of a worthwhile premium for eating at a certain caliber of restaurant here in Las Vegas and simply having to pay the freight in order to do so, it now seems more like desperation borne of a need to squeeze every dollar out of customers in a city that has no real gravitas. 

Turn up the heat, Las Vegas, you can't be a world class city unless you mind the details and stop charging for the sake of charging. It's just not that cool here.",azupW8UYwIzcFGchoEz-Dg,2,1,2,R9H1oG5t4klKFTolkhZbqg

We finally had the opportunity to try this place since we were staying at caesars Palace. Since the restaurant is located in the forum shops, it is super close! It was totally worth it and so delicious! 

We made reservations they day off and it was the only time they had available so we got really lucky.

Really cool. He took us to our table and I was surprised how big the restaurant was.

We got the calamari as an appetizer and it was really good. Not too much breading where it was heavy with batter but just enough to be crunchy and perfectly cooked. The bread basket was amazing as well! All kinds of breads like corn bread, pretzel rolls, sweet rolls and some kind of crunchy flatbread. Yum! For entree I got the rib eye, my parents split the salmon and my sister got the seafood pasta. The steak was perfectly cooked and was seasoned perfectly and juicy. The salmon was perfectly cooked as well according to my parents and was already split per the restaurant. The salmon pieces were pretty big too! The seafood pasta was very impressive. Huge pieces of crab, lobster and shrimp all tossed in a pesto sauce with pasta. All the seafood was nicely cooked and very flavorful and fresh. Another huge portion! We also got a side of the mashed potatoes which were buttery and o so yummy!

This is the type of place where they switch out your white cloth napkin for a black napkin if you're wearing a black dress. Intimate booths, dark wood, and suited up waiters.. reminds me a bit of House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. It's a refreshing classic dining experience.

Started off with a beautiful assortment of bread. My favorite was the crispy cheese flatbread. I knew we were in for a treat when the amuse bouche arrived - hamachi and caviar. We ordered the popular Stone Crabs. I'm used to dirtying my hands for crab meat but these Stone Crabs come pre-cracked and didn't want to budge out of the rock hard shells. Kept us preoccupied for a little while. Fresh nonetheless. The Seared Scallops were perfectly cooked and came with some of the best bacon jam i've come across. The cauliflower mash surprised me, i thought it was actually mashed potatoes! Creamy and buttery, you would never know otherwise. I can rave about the chilean sea bass but i'm pretty sure every dish here is worth of 5 stars.

Best part, they offer half portions of pie slices. There's always room for dessert. Don't miss the coconut cream pie. The cream is almost marshmallow like in consistency and flavor.",hFCUoOVs1rA4FX9Vps9fsg,4,2,5,aylFulJgn3AcLhnAo1LMkg

I used opentable both times and this time the host - four years later - was super friendly with the welcome back greetings and gave us a great table.  The waitstaff are fabulous and very professional and friendly without being overbearing.  I ordered the filet Oscar and my boyfriend ordered the grilled seafood platter.  The steak was a perfect medium rare and came with huge chunks of delicious crab and asparagus.  I was asked if I wanted the bernaise drizzled over everything which I thought was nice and of course I did!  My boyfriend loved his seafood as well and the scallops were impeccable.

We had 8 of us and made a reservation for 5:30 PM. We lucked out and got a private room in the back and let me just say, it was perfect because we can get pretty loud, I mean there were 8 girls!

We did family style and found ourselves having to order duplicate sides because we enjoyed them and one dish was not enough for 8 people.

According to the menu, one crab claw was ripped from each crab on the boat, and the crab was then released. I'm guessing that the claw has to be frozen with this technique.

I am not sure why they have such a high rating. Service was really good and the waiter knew his stuff the price-point is a bit high but quality of food is lacking!!!!!! 

The bread they bring out as an appetizer was standard some pieces though tasted like hospital bread, you know the bread they serve in a plastic bag at the hospitals. NOT IMPRESSED. 

I ordered the Filet Mingon and I was not impressed more so disappointed ... I ordered it medium on the bone. Half the steak was cooked well and the inside was cooked medium.The filet was chewy at the end and not packed with that juicy flavor you suppose to get out of a filet. The ends toward the bone were very very fatty. POORLY COOKED FILET MINGON.
The swordfish was not good. Did not taste fresh and was a bit on the rubbery side. Just so wrong. The sauce that comes on top was flavorless. 

The stuffed mushrooms with spinach were very good and tasted great, perfect play between cheesy and crunchy.

I believe there specialty is stone crab but we didn't try it. Its supposedly these crabs that they tear off one claw and throw them back into the ocean....

My suggestion though is with a bill close to 160 dollars for food the quality of two entrees 2 deserts and a cappuccino did not deliver great quality food for value. 

THE ONLY REASON I WOULD GO BACK IS FOR THERE AMAZING PIE. WHILE THE BANANA FOSTER IS GOOD THE KEY LIME PIE IS JUST HEAVEN ON EARTH MADE BY THE KEY LIME PIE GDS. ITS BEYOND AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of key lime pie and this is in the top two best key lime pies Ive ever had in my life. GO THERE AND JUST ASK FOR A SLICE OF KEY LIME PIE. They have a baker that comes in every morning and specifically bakes THE PIES. It delivers freshness and this thick graham crust, its scary to say PERFECT.

IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE MAN THAT SITS YOU IN FRONT HE WILL SIT YOU AT TABLES NEAR THE BAR AREA OR OUTSIDE BY THE FRONT WHICH IS GREAT FOR LUNCH BUT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE EAT DINNER OVERLOOKING MALL SHOPS EXPERIENCE FOR LATE DINNER.  SO JUST HEAD ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK.... The place is huge and there is more seating options than what you see. They have an upstairs and a romantic dim lit back room.",qTcese4apYSlYZpSZyj6NA,5,0,2,eEMOwdhwMpB7Rvke9yJ3KA

I had the grilled seafood platter. 4 shrimp, 3 small lobster tails and 4 medium scallops. This was really good. Only issue was the scallops weren't cooked evenly. Two were perfect, one a little undercooked and the other overcooked. We tried the mashed potatoes and roasted corn. The corn was the best we ever had.

I've been eating here two or three times a year for many years now.  It's not uncommon to make a trip to Las Vegas just to dine at Joe's and turn around and go back.

Located in the Forum Shops at Ceasars Palace (did you know that there is no apostrophe used in Ceasars Palace because the owner when it opened said that all guests entering were Ceasar).  Joe's interior has the look of an old school but high-end steak house.   Booth's are located in dark corners; old photos of Joe's origin restaurant in Miami adorn the walls, low ceilings, ornate light fixtures and a sample of Joe's large selection on wine is displayed along one long wall as you enter.

Joe's has large and varied menu featuring a selection of prime steaks, crab, lobster, and salads.  Every thing is al a carte so sides are served family style and generally large enough to serve the table depending on the size of your party.

I've sampled the rib eye and lobster but the reason I keep going back to Joe's is for the Alaskan King Crab.  The dinner portion features a 1  1/2 lbs. of the largest crab legs I've ever seen.  Crab is usually tough meal due to the amount of work to free the sweet and succulent crabmeat from the spiny shell.  Once you're done leveraging your sheller and cracker you end up with a pile of crab flakes on your plate.  Not at Joe's they make it easy for you by cutting the shells open tableside.  It's a great show.  All you have to do is use your fork to pull out the meat, dip in the drawn butter and enjoy.  I've searched wide and far for other restaurants that serve crab in the same way and have failed miserably.  

Joe's sides and desserts are good too.  There is a large selection of potato dishes to choose from and vegetables ranging from roasted corn, asparagus, Brussels spouts and Sautéed Spinach.  The dessert menu features Key Lime Pie and pie of the month (April 2016 was Strawberry Ice Cream Pie), sundae's and other baked confections.  

The staff at Joe's is always friendly, knowledgeable and ready to help you make the right entrée or wine selection.  You will never lack for a refill of any drink.  Meals are delivered promptly and prepared expertly to your specifications.  If you are enjoying red meat you'll find the temperature is perfect (medium-rare is really medium-rare).  

There are a lot of dining in Las Vegas but for my money Joe's is hard to beat.",veUS1l3hes5PI3824b9MkQ,18,17,5,UXoZJJQhs_Enbckyw6lBXg

We were walking the shoppes at Cesar's and had seen this before. I was jonesin' for some steak (when am I not?!). The dining area looked full and we didn't have reservations. We thought we'd have to wait a while, which was no problem. We got seated right away. The seating is divided into 3 sections ( the faux patio, bar area, and main dining area). We sat in the bar area which I actually preferred. 

We each ordered a ribeye with creamed spinach and lyonnaise potatoes. 
The steak was the best I've had so far! It was like I was eating addiction! No joke! I've had steak from Ruth's, Morton, Smith and...., and numerous other places. This was numero uno! They also provided a tiny tin of their house seasoning salt. I'd forget about the high blood pressure anytime they'd bring this out.! It made the steak that much better! Just be conservative with it. What else looked amazing was the plate of stone crab the couple next to us ordered! I thought they'd taken those claws off some monster in a Godzilla movie. That's on the realz, homie. 

Our server was always on point. Like she was a Pre-Cog from Minority Report.

My sister & I wanted to eat a nice steak for dinner but since our mom wanted seafood, we settled for Joe's (we were debating between Lawry's & Joe's). 

Ordered the tuna tartare, seafood platter, filet mignon, bone-in ribeye, creamed corn & mashed potatoes. The portions were A LOT smaller than anticipated. Definitely incomparable to Lawry's prime rib & sides. 

Tuna tartare- 3/5 The appetizer was TINY with mediocre pieces of fish. The cracker? Used for the tartare was a bit like pork rinds without the pork. Was a good combo with the fish but definitely wouldn't order again. 

Seafood platter- 4/5 Came with maybe 6 pieces of scallop, 2 shrimp, and 3 lobster tails? This was a lot smaller than was expected as well. The buttery sauce it came with was delicious but nothing spectacular. My mom, however, was satisfied so thus we were as well. 

Filet mignon- 2/5 We asked for a medium rare but instead we got more of a medium, which was quite chewy. The steak was seasoned well but some parts were very salty. Definitely wouldn't order again. 

Bone-in ribeye 4/5 The best part of the meal. Asked for medium rare plus and got exactly that. It was juicy, flavorful & tender. Since we shared all our plates, this was the first to go. 

Mashed potatoes & creamed corn! 4/5 
Both tasted very good but again, small portions. The mashed potatoes contained some cheese and was topped with some kind of flakes that were amazing. The creamed corn was just absolutely phenomenal. DEFINITELY WILL ORDER BOTH AGAIN.

 Finally, dessert! Key lime pie & banana cream pie. 4/5 Key lime pie was sour but the crust was delish! And the banana cream pie had a lot of cream in it but it was good as well. Had to order it since it's like. Only my favorite dessert ever. Also ordered the coffee (from Intelligentsia!) but it was so watered down & weak. Asked for an espresso instead. 

Service 2/5 Our server was not very friendly and was quite slow to tend to our needs. He kept saying he would get back to us but seemed uninterested in serving us.

I got the Filet and Lobster-tail, Hash Brown Potatoes, Crispy Brussels Sprouts. He then introduced me to the best dessert I've ever had- the Havana Dream Pie. We also got Key Lime Pie and Boston Cream Pie. One thing they don't tell you on the menu is that you can get half slices of the pie. And the desserts are very reasonably priced at $4.50 per half slice. Everything we had was amazing with the exception of the filet that didn't really impress me. The hash brown potatoes, crispy Brussels sprouts, and Havana Dream Pie are all to die for!

With my parents in town this week, i decided to go again and also bring the wife along. 

For the appetizer we went with the calamari. In all honesty, the best I've ever had. The bread they bring out before the meal is exceptional. I'm not positive but it must be baked in house. SO fresh. My favorites are the regular roll, the pretzel roll, and the cornbread. You will not be disappointed! 

This time for the entree, I decided to go with the bone-in ribeye. It was definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had. Highly recommend it! My wife got the skirt steak which she really loved and I had a piece of it and can concur that it was also very good. My parents also went with the ribeye but without the bone. Again, we got the hash brown potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts which were awesome.

Havana Dream and Banana Cream again for desert. Half slices again, which are plenty. I can't even believe full slices are an option as big as the halves are.

We booked an early reservation because we had tickets to a Cirque show afterwards, so the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived.  Despite this, they seated our party of 7 at the worst possible table in the room, right outside the noisy kitchen.  That's one of my pet peeves about restaurants, and major points off for that.

But the worst was my steak, which was one of the worst-trimmed steaks I've ever had the misfortune to be served in a restaurant, rife with gristle that I had to spit out more than once, and then take care to trim around.  Their menu says they serve prime steaks, and believe me, this was no prime steak.  For $46 (just for the steak) I deserved a lot better.

They have a great bread basket but points off for the cold rolls in it.

Thankfully, most of the other food was fine and the service was adequate.  They screwed up a couple of the orders but it was a large table, and they corrected everything when we pointed it out to them.

Still, our table dropped $800 for dinner, wine, tax, and tip, and for that kind of money we believe we can do better.  So can you -- look elsewhere.",BAA_e00mzloij8N3W3_BpA,0,0,2,gjTb-0FHd_69-8wi2eyd7A

The house bread and rolls were very good, especially the pretzel rolls. We also tried two different types of oysters. I don't personally like oysters, but others from my party said they were really fresh and tasted like the ocean.

The seafood is excellent! We had a seafood platter. Everything on it was great. Of course, we had to get the stone crabs. Cracking and eating is very fun. They will even wash your hands afterwards with lemon!

If you have kids, bring them. Even though it's fine dining, they will have a lot of fun! For $17, kids can get a decent-sized filet mignon, plus a side and a brownie dessert.

I ordered the Dover Sole which is always good and my husband ordered a Ribeye.  The steak was cooked to perfection, he used a pinch of the seasoning salt and we both thought it was outstanding.  For sides I had read about the roasted sweet corn (it deserved all the hype) and the steamed asparagus.  We ALWAYS get the coleslaw - it is the best coleslaw around, prepared table side.

Service was excellent. Our server was chatty but not intrusive. He went above and beyond not once, not twice, but THREE times when we could not make up our minds--first by showing us and explaining the different sizes of stone crab claws, second by asking the sommelier when we couldn't decide on a wine, and third by suggesting we could get half portions of 2 desserts instead of choosing 1.

Food was excellent. The stone crab appetizer was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and this is from a person who doesn't usually care for cold seafood. For dinner, I had a huge piece of bone-in halibut that was seared to perfection. My husband had the bone-in fillet and pronounced it one of the top 5 steaks he has ever eaten. The broccolini we shared as a side dish was cooked just right--not too crisp, not too soft. For dessert, we shared half portions of the key lime and banana cream pies. The dessert portions were just right, not to mention the generous pot of coffee they left on our table.

Ambiance was what you would expect for an upscale steakhouse. The only negative--and I'm being very nitpicky--would be the attire of our fellow restaurant patrons. We are not prudes by any means, and we know Vegas is a big vacation destination, but this is Joe's, not Steak & Shake.

Otherwise, we might never have even met! The seafood here is incredible. My girls and I ordered a few drinks, appetizers and a few mains for us to share for a fancy lunch. Ummm Key Lime Pie Martini- where the hell have you been all my life?! Most delicious martini ever with a graham cracker crust around the rim of my glass!! Each sip felt like I was eating pie! I could tell right then and there that things were going to get better. For an appetizer I chose the tiger shrimp cocktail... pretty sure they were from the gulf but omg they were huge! Like 2 inches thick and 5 inches long huge! And so sweet! None of that shrimpy, fishy seawater taste at all. Honestly the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had in my life. For our main we split a few orders of the famous stone crab legs. Damn those things were huge!!! I was a little disturbed with the fact that these crabs are kept alive by only having one arm taken off at a time (as you know crabs can regenerate lost limbs) but once I put that giant piece of yummy, chilled crab flesh in my mouth..... all of that was forgotten. Well, until the end of the meal that is, haha. Guilt pangs came later. It was so delicious. Still... I can't believe that this isn't considered animal cruelty? I mean, I know it's a crab... but it's a living thing. Having your arm ripped off isn't a peach even if you can grow it back, I'm sure! Poor crabbies. Ahh why do they have to be so delicious?

First, I don't really like eating on the ""outside"" patio area. It's too tightly packed in and I felt myself cringing as people walked past our table. 

Our server was good, but tried to be a little too jokey/sarcastic for my taste. However, I wish I'd listened to his recommendations, because my friend did, and his meal was MUCH better than mine.

Not that mine was bad, but it was just nothing special. I got the shrimp cocktail and the crab cakes, and the cheesy mashed potatoes as a side. My impression was kind of ""meh. I really wasnt a fan of the potatoes- you can't really taste the cheese, and the breadcrumb topping was unnecessary and didn't add to the dish.

My friend got the grilled octopus, sea bass, and the steamed spinach, which were all amazing! I was filled with food regret and envy. Even my dessert choice, the Havana dream cake didn't wow me.

All together, including 2 rounds of beer, our bill was about $250.

2201689,2015-12-31,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"We chose Joe's specifically because of the reviews and awards. We left fully understanding why they have been in business for over 100 years. It's a simple plan really: Do one thing and do it well. Joe's knows seafood! And in our opinion, Joe's prices are perfectly matched to the quality of the product and the delivery of the service. Dining at Joe's was an experience, not just a meal. And we love when dining out is a complete experience!

Our visit started off on the right foot. We approached the Host stand and were greeted with a smile by a gentlemen in a black tux. I gave him our name and he was expecting us, knew we were from St. Louis and knew we had a dining club back home. Bonus points for being so detail-oriented and for paying attention to the notes I put in our reservation. His name was Gabe. He then directed us to a beautifully dressed table (The tables were dressed to the hilt and the chairs were very comfortable and conducive to a leisurely sit. A beautifully dressed table is the second sign of a good restaurant. Hint: the first sign is how you are greeted by the host/hostess) and handed us the lunch menu, special menu for the day and the extensive wine list. He informed us our server would be Perry and wished us an enjoyable meal. Well done, Gabe!

Even though the restaurant seemed fairly full (a great sign for a Monday at noon during the two slowest weeks in Vegas!), Perry was over in a millisecond to greet us. He was professional, efficient, friendly, was quick to give us a bit of background on the restaurant and their goals, and offered us bottled or tap water. I love it when the waiter, manager, chef, etc., take the time to give you some history and explain the restaurant's goal. It gives me an idea of what to expect and some insight into why the menu is the way it is.

To start things off, we ordered wine (Riesling, Dr. Pauly-Bergweiler, Noble House, Mosel, GER) by the glass ($8 - very reasonable and a deep pour), but we would have preferred a half-bottle, but there were no Rieslings offered that way. That was a bit of a bummer, but their wine list is extensive, so I feel most people would find many choices to select from. Bottle prices ranged from $40's to $7k with a lot in the $40-$70 range. With that, we received a bread basket with several fresh-made choices to munch while we made our selections.

This day was about shellfish! For our appetizer, we selected the Madagascar Shrimp ($17 ea). It's grilled and served shell removed, head on. The server finished the prep at tableside. It is hands down the largest shrimp I've ever eaten, much less seen! It had to be 8 inches long (no joke, folks, see the picture with reference to the server's hand) and probably was 6-7oz after cooking. We split ONE and it was plenty as an appetizer. It was grilled to perfection; I highly recommend this.

Our ""second course"" was the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab (6oz appetizer portion $22). It was served beautifully, over ice, pre-cracked, and garnished such that it was a sight for the eyes in addition to the taste buds! The chilled, drawn butter was superb. It was real, true drawn butter and it added to the crab, instead of detracting from it. Although, the crab did stand on its own.

For our ""third course"" we shared the Joe's Classic Two-Course Luncheon Special. It consisted of five medium Stone Crab Claws (I thought they were very large for medium claws), Hashed Browns, Cole Slaw and Key Lime Pie ($35 - an excellent deal for this price!). So, the Stone Crab - perfection! The meat is sweet, smooth and melts in your mouth. Seriously the best crab I've eaten. The hashed browns are very good, without being overly engineered. Now, the cole slaw. Oh. My. God. It comes out of the kitchen as cabbage, apple cider vinegar, Hellmann's mayo, sweet pickle relish, some pepper, salt and sugar. Perry mixed it table side and it was out of this world! The best slaw ever!!!

And lastly, the Key Lime Pie. It should be noted that I don't eat pie. But my husband had his first bite and raved about it, so I felt I had to try it...you know, for the sake of a complete review! Let me say, it was heaven! I'm fairly certain not all Key Lime pies taste like that, so I am not ready to call myself a pie lover, but I'd eat Joe's Key Lime again in a heartbeat! It's brightness was the perfect note to end on after the richness of our crab and shrimp.

At the end, Perry came by with lemons and a hot towel. He squeezed lemon over our hands, then laid the hot towel over them and rubbed a bit. We finished off the process and were super glad they do that since we'd certainly dove right in with our fingers for this delicious meal!

Overall, superb experience! Food, service, atmosphere - all excellent. And, in my opinion, appropriately priced for the quality of what you receive.",Vw-2QsrVJbxV6JryaxR7_Q,8,4,5,ngwN0PWrrZqNitJUxX7mNA

The service here is impeccable and the food is the epitome of what every restaurant should aspire to be. 

I started off with a peach flavored martini rimmed with sugar that was delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol and it went down so smoothly.

Our first appetizer was a 12-piece Rockefeller oyster rack. I am in awe at how fresh and tasty it was! I feel like they had just plucked the oysters from the ocean and brought it right to my plate. All of the oysters were perfectly chilled and the mix of sauces it came with made my mouth water. This was definitely the highlight of the night. 

The crab bisque is a must have! I loved every second of this soup. The flavors were so complex and at every corner I tasted a different flavor. It is creamy and hearty all in one. 

I ordered the pan sautéed branzino fish with lemon and capers. I enjoyed it. It's a healthy option and the sauce they use is drool worthy. 

We ordered the key lime pie for dessert and it was bomb! Tart and sweet with a kick ass crust. I salute Joe's for creating the best key lime pie in California.

Without a doubt I'd been looking forward to our 5pm reservation for a couple of weeks... 

Our waiter was a nice fella whose name escapes me...but he'd no doubt made a career for himself on knowing the specials and knowing them well. A little bit snoot, but still a whole lotta nice. 

We ordered drinks and I decided on one of the fancy schmancy specialty cocktails called ""Daddy's Key Lime Pie"" - a yummy concoction that yes - tastes like liquid Key lime pie and no doubt could turn deadly very quickly... (No wonder the recipe is top secret!) All I know is it's made with Skyy Vodka, half & half or some other cream, I'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. Bottoms Up! It was deeeelicious. 

Before I forget, too, I have to mention the bread basket! There is the OMGAH cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. I LOVES it!!!

Even though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. In fact, I ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because I didn't think I was hungry enough to justify that and an entrée. However, once I caught sight of the Jumbo Crab Cake I knew I couldn't resist.

That Jumbo Crab Cake was SO GOOD... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. It practically melted in my mouth! The next time I'm at Joe's I'm going to order the Jumbo Crab Cake dinner. (my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it!)

Rob & Jolene ordered the 2nd Mortgage, an appetizer that lives up to its name! A plate of Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Alaskan King Crab, and a Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche.  I tried some of the ceviche and it was flavored so nicely...light with just the right amount of acidity with chunks of scallops and shrimp... very, very good. 

Now... the main course... 

I knew IMMEDIATELY that I wanted the Bacon-wrapped Scallops. Have you seen them? Oh my goodness! TEN scallops in total; served in a ""pair"" of five since they are wrapped in bacon... oh my goodness...oh my goodness... heavenly! I could only eat five of them which worked out perfectly for me since I had leftovers for dinner last night! The scallops are fantastic. I didn't much care for the bacon itself but the flavor the bacon gave the scallops was FANTASTIC and they were perfectly cooked. 

For sides I ordered the Pan Roasted Sweet Corn, which I absolutely loved, and the Deep Fried Asparagus. How could I resist it? Even our waiter made a comment that they took a perfectly healthy vegetable and umm... made it unhealthy... and it was divine! Good thing the sides are generous in portion and can be shared easily between a party of even four, I'd say...

I tried the Garlic Creamed Spinach, also, and it was nice... but the Asparagus was the clear front runner. 

After our leftovers were boxed up, we ordered coffee... I really wanted dessert...but I had no room whatsoever. I was so stuffed I even considered for a second, sprinting to the opposite end of the Forum Shops to H&M to purchase a pair of elastic waistband pants... *tee hee* 

Two in our party of six did order dessert... I had a bite of both the Key Lime Pie and the Havana Dream Pie... which, oh yes... was certainly that. Both were decadent... I woulda needed a pair of elastic waistband pants AND a couch (a stretcher? and two strong mens?) had I indulged in a whole piece.

It was a lovely meal... with great friends that are near and dear to me... and a great send off for 2010...

The turkey avocado sammy is my fav(3.5) service is solid (4) value: depends on what you order.  Stick to the sandwiches and the 2 course lunch and you should make out fine (3.5 bump up to 4)

Just to preface this review -  Stone crab is not all that for me. Neither is crab in general. But we still make our way to Joe's for lunch to catch some of their other menu items. 

We usually go during the summer when Lettuce Entertain You club members receive coupons to dine in their local joints. Usually there is a coupon for Joe's which is a major score (yay!). 

We've tried different iterations of things but the true stand outs for us is the lunch menu which is way easier on the wallet than dinner. 

My perennial favorite is their turkey avocado sandwich. Served with real roasted moist turkey and a nice thick slice of bacon, it is a simple dish done really well. Love the combination of alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. The fried sweet potato fries are pretty solid but nothing special. For $16, this is as affordable for a place like Joe's gets. 

The hubs loves their sliced rib eye French dip with sautéed mushrooms and onions and a side of fries. ($22) It's messy/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. The french fries again are nothing special. 

The two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. Between the two options of Alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  I would opt for the crab. 

Really,  the crab is only okay in my books. Portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. Where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. The lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. Greasy but very tasty. The roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. Both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. It comes with Havana dream pie which is essential a Boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. If you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. All of this for around $28-29.

The steak option is okay - just the mashed potatoes are boring while the sautéed spinach is nothing special. 

Service is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. As soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. The bread basket is okay but I find myself partial to the Parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.

Overall, Joe's is nothing particularly innovative. But it is good food executed well generally. Value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,6,4,0vrkriO2sbBBwO3wg8rgIg

Our waiter recommended the roasted corn. I was skeptical about how good a side of corn could really be, but  our waiter was right! It was delish! The roasting really brought a wonderful smoky flavor to the corn. It was topped with clarified butter, cilantro, and a fresh squeeze of lime. 

 This was our first time eating stone crab, but hopefully it won't be our last! The stone crab was served cold which was a little bit uexpected but no less delicious. They cracked the claws before bringing them to table. The meat came out relatively easily, but we still had a few very hard slivers of shell that we unfortunately  ended up chomping down on.   The meat itself was succulant and slightly sweet. We would have been fine with eating the meat without any accompanyment but Joe's serves their crab with a very tasty mild mustard dipping sauce and fresh lemon.  The dipping sauce was flavored with with a hint of horseradish that paired fantastically with the sweet crab.  The meal was definately pricey but totally worth it.

So I was really excited to try Joe's Stone Crabs on my recent trip to Vegas (I never made it when I was in Miami last year).  

I first asked the waiter what a stone crab tastes like.  His reply ""a mix of crab and lobster.""  After trying them, I would say that is a fairly accurate description.  While good, I prefer blue crab meat, which is much sweeter but maybe I am biased.

The ambiance was very nice.  Much like a steakhouse, as opposed to some type of Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville type place I was originally expecting.  The service was excellent. Our waiter called me ""sir"" every time, which is a nice touch and took the time to answer all of our questions.  (There is nothing worse than having a waiter with an attitude)

The best part of the night: the key-lime pie.  For some reason, I could not stop eating it, even though I was so full from dinner. Perhaps there is better key-lime pie out there, and maybe when I go to Key West this winter I will find out, but for someone from the northeast, it worked for me.

Overall, a good place to try if you are in Vegas.",pUoFC1nE_gpPmfQnMi5tTQ,0,0,3,sEds5U-WB34oSCx_Zr7_-g

We ordered the Stone crab, and everyone got the Filet and tail.
WOWOWOW so amazing.  I never had stone crab before.. but dang it was awesome with some lemon and Joe's mustard sauce.

Next up was Kumamoto oysters.  I usually order kumamotos at my local oyster farm but these were bigger and had a stronger cucumber taste.. Delicious hands down.

Lastly, the filet and tail.. the filet mignon was so tender and they cooked it just perfectly.  I like my steak rare and they did a perfect job.  The lobster tail was also exceptional. Everyone ordered the same dish and it couldn't have been a better dinner.

Overall, this place was a home run for us.  I wouldn't hesitate to go again the next time im in vegas.  Good vibes, good company, great good, can't ask for more.",HWxtWHBfuu7umtJJb7J41w,0,0,5,iKL_jLB8NBOjjPZ9XaSzKw

My husband had crab cakes which were blue crab meat barely held together in a ""cake "" form, there being little or more likely no breading.  Just sublime crabmeat.  I had a fantastic idea in menu offerings -- lobster tail tempura.  Lobster meat -- 2 large tails.  Deep fried in tempura batter.  What in the name of all that is right and holy could be better than that?!  And did I mention the mojitoes?  We also shared their highly touted, rightfully so, cole slaw and french fried sweet potatoes and still managed to save room for dessert.

Has to be the best seafood place on the strip! Both because of the food and the service, our waitress leanne (sp?) was amazing!!! She provided so much interesting history about the restaurant since it has been around for awhile, also made recommendations and told us even not to order certain things because she knows her stuff and she was being honest.

Can I also just say the bread basket was amazing, I could've ate that all night. I seriously love bread and butter so much, the one with the roasted onions and cheese on it was my FAV!

Ordered a dozen oysters of course, which included some kumamoto and fanny bay, delish and super fresh (5 stars)

Also ordered some crab legs and they were the best I've ever tasted, so incredibly fresh, she told us they come straight to the restaurant unlike some other places where they first need to preserve them with a bunch of chemicals. That was awesome. (5 stars)

Stone crab claw (2 stars)- Our waitress actually suggested we don't order this because of the season they aren't as fresh as normal, my brother really wanted to try one since they're known for it, he did, and I def liked the legs better, so she was on fireeeeee!

I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Miso Glaze (4.5 stars)- DIVINE. The flavors were all there- my only mark off was that it was slightly overcooked. My brother got the same thing and even said so, too bad they made a mistake on mine. It wasn't chewy or anything so I ate it, but I do like my fish almost medium. 

Dover Sole (4 stars)- My dad and brother got this, they served this table side, I enjoyed the sea bass more, but this was still pretty good, the sauce does the trick ;)

Sides:

Roasted Corn (2 stars)- This is one thing I didn't enjoy- tasted way better before, they need to add something to make this stand out more. My brother makes a creamy kind of corn dish at home which is fantastic, wish I had that!

Mashed potatoes (4 stars)- Good some crunch goodness on the top too, wish there was some garlic in there though ;)

Dessert- it was all pies! I'm not a huge pie person, but you can order halves, which my brother did of the banana creme pie, pretty good and I think she gave us a whole slice and charged us for half which was nice and we tipped her very well :)

Word of advice- they have valet right outside the restaurant so DO NOT valet in the lobby, it's a long horrendous walk in heels, trust me. Wish we knew that ahead of time!",F-KA6dHxp2L_subuYam_kA,6,5,5,M-WsEQRZIB2UeRYcJ9sVIw

2434543,2014-08-09,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Joes is old-timey. It's an old warhorse of Vegas, and well....it might not be at the top trend of 'look how cool we are' but it still kicks ass when it comes to delivering a meal. I've only been once and that night was with my family and a few family friends. We'd started at the bar drinking and had spent the entire day drinking and continued drinking...so there might be a bit of a memory lapse here...because we ended up drinking at Casa Fuente right after too. 

Joe's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas thus far, and absolutely one of my favorite steakhouses I've ever been too (I'd say second favorite behind a Kansas City place). We did just about everything off the menu. Everyone save for myself got crab appetizers (I don't do seafood) 

By then, I'd had a few scotches in me and we were opening up the wine. This was a big trip for everyone; trade show for me, trade show for dad, youngest brother just turned 21. We'd been planning on this trip for over a year as it was the first time all of us had been together since last Thanksgiving. 

Joe's is the go-to place for many in workspace my dad is in; they've been going here for close to 20 years. Hilariously enough everyone in the industry basically was there, either eating on the 'exterior' area or in the actual restaurant. I'd wager some of the staff probably got to see really expensive knives :/. I was in town for SHOT, so I was exhausted as hell. 

This place basically propelled what was an amazing trip into one of the best family vacations any of us had been on, and that's including trips to the Caribbean and the EU. Why, you ask? 

Service put up with us because half of us were well-dressed inebriated mid-20-something kids hanging during trade show season on a Saturday night. Our server, who's name I do forget, was fantastic and she did her job well. Right up there with what you expect for this town, if not more. 

The steak is the best steak in Vegas I've had thus far. Sure, haven't been to Robuchon or Delmonico...but hearing anecdotal stories from family/friends most everyone continues to talk up Joe's. Every single male at our table ordered the NY Strip because that's how you do a damn steakhouse. We ordered about every potato option I think, and most of the veggies. 

Nothing made it out alive. I seriously watched my brother cry happily in the corner as we were all having a meal none of us were going to forget. Mind you, we're from KC and we eat out a lot....we've had it nice and it's hard to impress every member of my family. This place was nothing new to the older crowd, who were all having their favorite steak in Vegas already, but my two brothers and I were having an experience. 

Basically; Joe's definitely is one of the best steaks in the country. 

Going to Casa Fuente afterwards and then to some electronica concert at the MGM made this one of the best nights ever.

Rock crab claws:  Wow, I loved it! So fresh, sweet and juicy! I guess this place isn't famous for its claws for nothing! Each claw was huge and had so much meat and I think 2 claws per person is the perfect amount.  And they go perfectly with Joe's mustard sauce. It's so worth the $$! 

Seafood chopped salad:  Delicious salad! All the seafood - lobster, crab, shrimp - in the salad are also sooo fresh and sweet. It was so light yet so satisfying!

And because we were too full we didn't order dessert, but the waiter surprised us with a complimentary dessert -- brownies and ice cream!  And yes, we made room for dessert and it was a great way to finish a wonderful meal!

I had no expectations whatsoever but my mom was in a pissy mood. So we get here and the ""patio"" seating was currently closed off because the outside doors nearby were open and letting in a freezing wind and the patio wasn't heated. So we were seated inside at this tiny table sitting on high bar stool leveled seats and my mom threw a fit to our waiter venting how it was ""ridiculous that the patio isn't heated"" and how it was ""my daughter's 25th birthday and was supposed to be special"" giving off this snotty vibe like this place was just SO beneath her. I felt so bad and so embarrassed because it's not like it was his problem. But he apologized and brought his manager over and the manager handled my mom amazingly (bless his poor soul, ugh) and apologized and gave us a discount and completely surprised me by bringing me a complimentary alcoholic beverage AND an ice cream and brownie sundae with a candle and everything. WOW talk about amazing service, when he had every right to disregard my mom's horribleness.
Even with the discount and free stuff, our bill was over $300...to be honest I do not think the food was worth the price so i like to think we paid for amazing customer service.

But, this being Vegas, we took a gamble and won BIG time!  My husband and our friend got the steak (chop) & the lobster.  As our friend put it, the lobster was both sweet with just a tad bit of saltiness for flavoring; it was succulent, and when dipped into the butter, simply divine. So, they moved to the steak, both of them were skeptical that they'd be impressed at all well, they were wrong. As my husband put it, the steak was so tender you barely even needed a knife to cut it; you could've just used the edge of your fork. The steak was tender, savory, and made to perfection.  Wow, right?  
We also had the stone crabs because that's Joe's signature dish;  it definitely did not disappoint. Meaty and flavorful.  I had the grilled seafood platter with shrimp, scallops, & lobster tails. The one major problem with it was that I finished all of it and then it was gone. . I suppose it gave me a chance to dive into our sides:  mac & cheese, sautéed spinach, and stuffed mushrooms. Mac & cheese:  shell pasta struck the balance of firmness but not too hard, and the shape (I discovered) handily scooped up & held the cheese so that everything landed into my mouth. Stuffed mushrooms were also nicely done with the mushrooms retaining the flavor from the buttery stuffing & let's be honest, that's always a good thing.  And the spinach was my one vegetable, made extra delicious with seasoned butter-/or something like that. The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable, & engaging. She knew a couple members of our party were on a tight schedule so she got our order going quickly to get them fed and  out the door.  I have to say that I very much appreciated that, even after those 2 left, we were still made to feel welcome to sit and stay. There was no pressure at all to leave even though it was busy.

Thank God for the seafood platter--which contained three of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten. Honestly, I didn't care for the stone crab claws, I understand why they aren't served warm, but they were extremely watery and kinda bland.

It has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, I have been more than 30 times to the original in miami and the only thing I can say is that the one in las vegas is horrible in every way, for example In vegas the clam chowder was not only cold but we had to return it because it tasted like dirty laundry, then we ordered the wedge salad where in miami they bring you a huge portion witch most of times you have to share because it is so big, in vegas they brought me a 1/3 of a half, i returned it telling them that there most be a mistake on the portion, 10 minutes later they brought me the exact same portion telling me that in vegas is a different portion, then we ordered the stone crabs, incredibly they didn't had the most common size witch is the large and told us that they only had the jumbos that were priced about $ 85dls per order,  20 minutes later another person came and told me that they had ran out of the jumbo's but now suddenly they had the large ! so we ordered the large, it was not surprised that when the stone crabs came they were frozen and not good at all,  a fresh stone crab should not stick to the shell and this ones were a disgrace for what they charge, the sweet potato fries are completely different as well, and the signature key lime pie is also not made the same way and tasted nothing like the original. If you plan to go to Joe's Do not consider by any means to go to the one in Vegas, It has nothing to do with the original in Miami,  I keep asking me why would they change a great menu like the one in Miami to make a worst one? please some one tell me ! they should be ashamed to be called Joes stone crab.",EHnqYOK5quZ3C64yvOo9Ag,0,0,1,rz3VyE5Y2m0nO5z82ojTqA

I'm disappointed that I did not get to try the stone crab, but there were other things that caught my eye. I started with the crab cakes; it was a solid good mound of crab meat and it just fell apart in your mouth. It was delicious. For my main course, I decided to go with the bone filet mignon-- amazing. It was about 26 ounces; it wasn't fork tender as it needed to be cooked a bit longer because of the bone shielding the meat from the fire but the flavor was to die for. My partner did have the Chilean sea bass which was also super good. For dessert, we went with the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge and our server gave use a complimentary slice of the Havana pie, which were both amazing. It being my first time, I had dressed with slacks, button up, and a tie, but it was not necessary as you get all sorts of people from the strip in casual clothes coming in. I would definitely come back. I recommend calling ahead for reservations.",7WwBHkBQjj7qWgrGZu_qZw,1,1,5,nYfqbsV3shU_XiWFek5etQ

I've been to multiple Pharma dinners, including Joe's in Chicago, and they always leave the name of the company because an attendee may not know the name of the person who made the reservation.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab really is just a tourist trap with a few great options and a lot of okay items you are privileged to pay Strip pricing for...

If you do find yourself here just ignore the inflated prices and stick to what they're know for: Stone Crab Claws, King Crab Legs, Crab Bisque, Filet Mignon...even Scallops with Pork Belly.

I've been here three times over the years and every time I've tried to explore the menu a bit and share some items with the table. I keep coming back because what the do well, they really do well. But in the end I just think that you can get a better meal at a much better price. It's not that Joe's breaks the bank...just that most of the menu is 10-20% overpriced. I have no problem with spending a little more than the actual quality of the product calls for, but if I do, I want it to be really great food or good food in an incredible setting...Joe's doesn't do either of these well enough that I see myself continuing to come back. Don't get me wrong, it is good.

They crack the shells so it's easy to get to the meat.  You can eat the crab straight, with lemon, or dip it into a mustard based sauce.  Either way is great!  It's chilled which makes it soothing against your tongue.  This is a must try!

They no longer dry-age their steak.  They now wet-age their steak.  This new method of vacuum sealing their meat does not hurt the taste or change the complexity of flavor.  There still is a rich meaty like taste.  The bone-in is the best cut, especially when you get to chew on the bone.

We also got Brocollini and Potatoes.  It was okay, but nothing special.  Finally, the Key Lime Pie is outstanding!  It's cold and it's creamy.  The flavors of the tart lime, creamy whipped cream, and textured graham cracker crust work in harmony together.

-bone-in ribeye:  Yah, I splurged for the bone and honestly, I don't know if it would've made a difference.  I've noticed with other places that the meat next to the bone is usually a bit more tender than the rest of the steak but it really didn't matter here.  Every piece of meat I ate was just as good as the last.
-dover sole:  This thing was A-MA-ZING!  Cooked perfectly and the brown butter sauce on the side was so decadent.  My only gripe about this dish is that they took the belly, and all the tasty little bones away =(  My little heart cried when the waiter took that platter away ='(((
-swordfish with mint pesto:  This was a special that night and it was overcooked.  My friend really should've sent it back for a new one but she didn't.  The presentation was lovely though.
-creamed spinach:  This was very good.  It had a good spinach flavor and wasn't overloaded with cream.
-Jennie's potaoes:  Honestly, I don't see the draw of this dish.  It was just whipped potatoes and it seemed to have lacked butter and salt in it.
-mac and cheese:  This was okay, loved that they used shells though =d
-oysters on a half shell:  Their shucking skillz weren't too bad.  Only about 3 of the 12 oysters on the plate were stabbed to death and I had some shell shards in 1 of my oysters so that was good.  They were offering French Kisses and Kushis that night.  The Kushis defintely stole the show with a slight sweet buttery taste to them.  They also come with little Tabasco bottles that are uberly cute!  And a migonette, which was nice but a tiny spoon to get the liquid onto the oysters would've been greatly appreciated hah!

She refused to leave her unattended so they finally sat them on the patio as we arrived 5 minutes before our reservation time. We ordered for restaurant week, Copper River Salmon and Roasted beet salad. 

Server seemed a bit perturbed but whatever, couldn't discern why. The beet salad was so salty. I tried eating it but couldn't. He offered the other appetizer options, which I didn't want. He told me he already put my fish order in so I better hurry and decide as he walked away. When he returned I repeated I didn't want the fried calamari or raw fish so he said they'd make a new salad. That was salty as well. He took the plate and said the manager will taste it and he would charge me for the house salmon. Fine. No response as to whether the manager's taste buds were similar to ours.... 

The Copper River Salmon did NOT taste or look wild but as it was over cooked and the beet drama, I ate it. Waiter continued to seem annoyed until he delivered three amazing pies, not ordered by us, to the table. He said here are some pies for you. Want knives? Sheesh.

Now crab in itself is easy to cook. You can't really mess this up and they didn't. The crab was very good. I looked over their menu and saw steaks, salads and seafood. I looked at their lunch menu too. I saw a chef creation and got excited. It was called The Elote Burger. If you don't know what elote is it's Mexican street corn . It is roasted and covered in mayo, chilli powder, lime juice, cheese etc. One of my favorites. So I figured HELL YEAH and ordered the elote burger and left it up to the chef to decide best temperature and preperation. It reads that it comes with Mexican corn, cilantro, aioli etc. Sounds delicious.  I received the burger and it looked delicious.

There was absolutely NO FLAVOR to the patty. Not even a grain of salt. I expected multiple layers of flavor and SPICE!! Nope nothing. Not even close to elote. Was so unhappy.

While planning a great trip to the lovely Las Vegas area, Joe's crossed my list as one of the top places to eat--thanks to my fellow yelpers! I wanted to impress the hubby with a romantic dinner and amazing steak. And after much debt-- I decided Joe's would be it!

Let me say if you come in the main entrance of the Caesars Palace you are jacked and I hope you have on comfortable shoes! The restaurant is on the far end of the hotel and located in the shopping and eating plaza of the hotel. Make sure you ask somebody if you are not sure, or you will get an amazing amount of exercise before you eat. After our long hike from the beginning of the hotel to the restaurant, we finally made it to JOE'S (AHHHHH*** angel music in the background). There was a gentlemen hostess outside the restaurant behind a booth --who was taking seating request for people as they came up to the restaurant (there was a wait). Luckily for the hubby and I, I made reservations a few days in advance. The host escorted us into the restaurant and into a second check in area and a second dining room area for those who made reservations. This area was kind of sectioned off and I felt very exclusive! After the second host confirmed our name we were immediately seated. The set up and decorations of Joe's is so upscale, I felt like I traveled back in time to the early 1900s and dining at the classist establishment in Vegas. The lighting is dim and romantic and the waiters all wear full tuxedos. 

The hubby and I were seated in a cushiony booth and immediately given water and bread from the sub server. After a couple of minutes our waiter made his way to our table and went through the menu and what the day's specials were. I placed an order for a glass of wine and the hubby ordered water (not sure what wine I ordered--its Vegas and I had a few before I got there). The wine was very good-- I do know that much. Everything sounded so good on the menu, I couldn't decide what to order. I ended up ordering the King Crab Louis Salad and the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs. The hubby ordered the filet mignon steak. The salad was so amazing and fresh! It was the best crab salad I have ever had! The Jumbo crab legs I could have gone without-- the market price was 20 or 30 bucks and I only received like a piece of 2 legs--it looked like an appetizer--but I guess that's what is served at upscale places.

Joe's was one of the first restaurants that come up on my search.  With over 2,000 reviews and having a 4.5 star rating we decided to make reservations and give it a shot.  It's conveniently located within the Caesar's mall area and is very easy to find.  Once inside you don't even know you are in a mall.   The ambience reminded me of an old school steak house, dimly lit, dark wood décor and white table cloths.  One of the main reasons we chose this place was because of the Stone Crab.  We are big fans of crab but have never tried the Stone Crab.  We had the Stone Crab as an appetizer which was perfect.  They come in small, medium and large.  Your server will recommend the large because they are easier to handle but they are the most costly.  Speaking of cost you shouldn't go hear looking for moderate price tag.  It's a bit pricey (as is any decent steak house) but that's ok because the food is very high quality.  After the Stone Crab we were each served our main course.  My wife ordered a Petite Filet and I went with the Rib Eye (No bone).  We were both very pleased with our steaks from the flavor to how it was prepared to our liking.  I order all my steaks medium rare and my wife orders hers medium.  Both were perfect.  I had a baked potato and my wife had a sweet potato as a side.  Can't really mess those up and they didn't.  The only problem with our meal was the fact that we each could not finish our steaks.  We may have over indulged in the bread basket beforehand.  That's what happens when you starve yourself because you know you are going to have a great dinner.  The bread basket hit the table and like magic it disappeared.  Our service was pretty good although we kind of got the feeling our server was disappointed we didn't order a bottle of wine over just two glasses.  I could be completely wrong but that's the vibe we got.

2610613,2017-09-27,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Really disappointed with Joe's. Live in California and visit Vegas about once a year. Have made it a little tradition to stop by Joe's Seafood whenever possible. Each time we come here, we splurge. The last time we got to eat here, came with a party of 8, got a back room and went to town on steaks, crab, oysters, wine, the works. Didn't mind spending the money due to excellent service and food. This past visit, I arrived with my wife and 1 year old around 1:30pm. An older man greeted us at the entrance and asked how many in our party. I replied 2 adults and a baby. He said it would be at least an hour but that we could have been seated immediately in the bar area if the baby wasn't with us. I thought the comment odd and I could see that there were at least 3 open tables behind him, but didn't think much of it and gave him my name. We walk around the mall for a bit and my wife wondered if the guy thought we needed a table for four. Our baby is not found of high chairs so my wife usually sits him in her lap. We go back to Joe's and I ask the man if it would make any difference if it was only a table for two. He says it would not make a difference but sees me glancing behind him at the empty tables. He then tells me that we would need extra room for our stroller and the reiterates that if we didn't have our baby, we could sit at the bar. This makes absolutely no sense to me as I know that Joe's has room in the back for coat checks and our stroller folds up... and more than that, you want us to get rid of our baby to eat at your restaurant? 

At this point I could have made a scene, talked to the manager, yada yada yada. But did I want to fight with an old timer about spending several hundred dollars on lunch? (yeah, we go all out when we come here). I was about to thank the man but he was already looking past me to the next group of people. So my wife and I go upstairs to eat at sushi roku, which was surprisingly good and they were super friendly. The kicker is that after we ate, we went downstairs and passed by Joe's. The same tables were empty. 

The way he was talking to me I could chalk it up to a lot of things, racism (I'm not white), the way I was dressed (shorts and tshirt since we were on our way to the airport) or a couple with a really young kid (not appropriate for this venue). Bottom line is that he wasn't talking to me like a person but talking at me like an obstacle. 

Wouldn't be writing this but to say that Joe's has lost a customer for life. Go to conventions here every other year and our vendors give us a choice of restaurants. Used to recommend Joe's, but not anymore. Their food is good, sometimes even great on their on days, but part of the whole experience is the service. You can get good seafood and good food at plenty of places in Vegas. Number 1 rule is that you treat your customers with respect. I didn't get that here, and for me, that is enough to say never again.

2611771,2017-02-07,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"It was Friday night and we were meeting some friends for dinner, the restaurant was packed with both inside and outside seating. DEF RECOMMEND the outside seating- since this location is on the bottom floor of the Entrance off the strip in the Cesars palace- and from the outside seating you get the tourist people watching attraction (strippers, escorts, bridal parties, girls going out in super short dresses) 
The best is when sitting outside and the escalator is right there: when a girl in a super short skirt/dress walks by: all I did was watch all the guys try to get a peep. My back was faced toward the gotti shop next door and I knew every time when a girl in a short dress would walk by because every man (husbands and groups of guys) would stop what they were doing to stare at this girl going up the escalator. Super hilarious. 
Anyways onto the food: 

APPETIZERS
*** Assortment of Breads: What seemed like Pumpernickle, a lavosh- 2 kinds- a sesame seed one and another amber colored one (both were delicious), white bread rolls- all served with BIG CHUNKS OF Cold butter- recommendation- Ask for HOT drawn butter and dip your bread into that
*** THE Whale (SEAFOOD PLATTER- served cold)- Market value
- 4 legs of NON FROZEN Alaskan King Crab
-Avacado chunks/mini scallops/small chunks of Shrimp, red and yellow bell pepper with lime juice ceviche
-2 lobster tails cut into 4 pieces served cold
-jumbo shrimp cocktail
------The Whale comes highly recommended as per our waiter, the seafood on this platter is never Frozen. 


DINNER
1)green salads: very large portions with a light vinagrette
2)select stone crab (6 pieces): not recommended- yet it comes pre cracked and easy to eat but you can tell it is frozen. The meat on the inside was hearty but still lightly frozen and it just wasnt as sweet as the alaskan King crab legs
3) side of creamed spinach ($8.95)- NOT RECOMMENDED- tasted almost like it went bad- like sour milk- barely ate it and almost returned it
4) Filet mignon- 12 oz- $47.95- cooked rare plus- very tiny for the price
5) Filet and tail- ( 6ox Filet and 10z Atlantic Fire Grilled Lobster tail served with Drawn butter
-Very small lobster tail after its been fire grilled and truthfully much better served cold in the whale platter

DESSERT
1)Key Lime Pie- their most recommended dessert
-super super high quality lime taste, very tangy and refreshing with grahm cracker crust. Very buttery and delicious
2) Coconut Cream Pie- very sweet, creamy filling with whipped cream and shreads of dried coconut- not as good as the Key Lime Pie


Overall, the quality of food was EXCELLENT- Our server Steven was very high class and polite and prompt. He even saw that we were struggling with the dessert but knew we wanted some so he brought out the Key Lime Pie at No Charge. 
Although the service and quality of food was excellent- the price point was super high- Dinner for the 4 of us was close to 500$.

Top that off with great bread & sides (we opted for the garlic creamed spinach), and amazing pies for dessert (try either the banana cream or the key lime), and it made our trip to Vegas. No wonder this place was packed solid.

Back to the meal....I had a surf and turf offering and my husband the bone in filet. Side is creamed spinach-all his as I don't touch it! Baked sweet potato the size of 2 of my hands.

I checked in with the maître d' at 9:40 and I was the first one there. The staff was so gracious about saving our table until the rest of the guests trickled in. We finally had a quorum and were seated at 10:15. Please note that Joe's usually requires your entire party to be present to seat you. 

I started with an order of stone crab claws. I've been to Joe's in Miami so I was looking forward to that particular dish. The waiter brought me 4 instead of the usual order of 6.  Not sure if that's because they were running out of claws or he really thought 6 would be too many. In either case, it worked out and was less expensive. The order of 6 was $47 I think. I also had the large seafood salad as my entree. It was fresh, but unremarkable. I probably wouldn't order that again. I wish I'd had space in my belly for a slice of key lime pie! Had it in Miami and it was epic :-). 

Other highlights at the table were the crab cakes and crab legs. The portions are very generous. I heard that the steak and some of the sides were salty, but I didn't have them myself. Again, the service was top notch and the staff was very gracious. I look forward to eating at Joe's again.",oZ_pZtv8ARgBlfOWdEWlbA,1,0,4,3U_kryUscHCDf5X3O-0alw

Everyone employed here are friendly and informative. I've been going to this restaurant the past ten years and I still see a lot of the staff still working here so people are obviously making good money and are taken care of. 

When I come here for lunch, I generally order the lump crab salad and get a side or the mustard sauce used when they serve the stone crab claws. When I order dinner I order a couple of their massive Madagascar shrimp, tomatoes with cheese and corn. Every now and then I will get the Alaskan king crab or stone crab claws but they are also known for their steaks.

(1) it was lunch, and (2) I was filling a bit rough around the edges from the night before. The cheeseburger jumped off the menu as the perfect cure for what ailed me. I liked that they cooked it to order. I'm not afraid to order quality ground beef cooked to medium, and that is exactly how it came out. It was a bit messy, however, and I wound up using knife and fork. The fries were crispy and served in a very generous portion. With ketchup.

We asked for it to be steamed and served warm, & with lemon on the side since it was a little bland but tasted fresh!! They pre cracked it for us prior to serving which I thought was nice. We only had to peel the shells off easily. 

They gave us salt and pepper on the side for the stone crab and complimentary bread when first seated. 
The bread consisted of parmesan bread, salted pretzel bread, and other crispy wonton looking bread. 

Also ordered the 24 oz. Bone-in Ribeye $60 It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I asked for medium well. It was delicious. This serves 2 people so I shared this also with an order of the stone crab and an order of mash potatoes.  3 entrées was enough. 

Their Jenny Mash Potatoe's $10 has bits of crispy onion or was it parmesan on top. It was also good. No complains.

With tax was $118 including 18% tip it was about $138 . Not bad for a dinner date. 
My only complaint was the server was on the side talking to her co-worker a couple of times when we needed to get her attention. Also when we asked her opinion for which mash potatoes to order since there is 2 on the menu, she said both of them tasted good. The Lyonnais and the Jenny Mash. Hmm I would expect them to be more helpful.

Just outside an indoor fountain at Caesar's Palace that houses a Gelato shop, the restaurant looked great and elegant on the outside. We were seated immediately outside and ordered many appetizers, Single Malts (alcoholic drink), and main dishes.

The waitress was cheery and recommended a seafood appetizer sampler that contained oysters, King Crab legs, and Rock Crab legs. The oysters were very tiny, but the King Crab legs were absolutely delicious!

For the main courses, most of us tried the waitress-recommended Bone-in Rib Eye. Comparing it to the steaks we had at Mesa Grill (Caesar's Palace) and Bouchon (Venetian), this was our absolute favorite steak of the week-long trip! Bouchon, by the way, isn't recommended by us for steak.

My wife had the Cheese Burger. she said she preferred Farmer Boys Cheeseburger instead, so save your $$ and go to In n Out Burger instead.

Our table kind of shared a few things. I had some wedge salad, two different kinds of crab, and three different kinds of desserts. It's been a week or so now and I can't stop dreaming about the crab. The first crab I got was meant to be cold and it was just the claws. Had to work for the meat, but it was worth it. The second crab I tried, was meant to be hot and it was amazing and rich. I could only eat three pieces because it was that rich. I wish I remembered the desserts we tried because vise were also amazing. At that point, I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.

As mentioned earlier, the service was amazing. Any time my water started to go down, someone would come out of no where and fill it back up.

We showed up just at 10 o'clock, which is closing time, but were seated with no problem. Linda, our server, was warm and friendly and well informed about all the menu choices and steered us to some good options including the fresh roasted corn special  (side dish) which was delicious.

The New York strip was expertly prepared and had great flavor. The hamburger was terrific and the hamburger patty melted in your mouth. The stone crab was tasty, but we only got a few claws as an appetizer (better with cocktail sauce in my opinion than with the mustard-based sauce that comes with it).

I wish they had a little deeper selection of craft beers to choose from, but aside from that it was a perfect meal and we will go back... Joe's seems different to me than the typical Las Vegas ""flashy"" restaurant. They seem to actually care about your experience and food whereas a lot of the other restaurants in Vegas know they're only going to see you once and don't make much of an effort.

I had the crab bisque, which was excellent. Nice texture good flavor just the right amount of crab and good presentation. Then I tried their 9oz filet. I think it was cooked perfectly but to be honest was a bit dry. The loaded hash browns thing they make is excellent. Crispy and flavorful with those sautéed onions. The in season roasted corn and sautéed spinach also were top notch. I didn't love their mac and cheese but then again I'm not a huge Mac and cheese fan. The Havana dream pie was very well done. Sort of like a tres leches pie. Overall I'd definetly go back but might try their crab or lobster as the steaks are nothing to write home about.",f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,3,0,4,ZwnGUblEb8KGj6tvnBnlrQ

My only regret:  Not coming here sooner!  (I've lived in Vegas for over ten years!)

One order of the large stone crab to start was shared between my family and myself.  Throw away anything you knew about delicious crab.   This was the absolute most delectable, satisfying, piece of crab to have graced its way onto my tongue.  Paired with the mustard sauce, a.k.a. crack sauce, and you'll experience a high unlike any other and you'll probably wonder why Nevada even needed to legalize marijuana when this is so much better.

Next let's talk about that chilean sea bass.   What the hell?  Did this come from the sea or from the heavens above?!    It was so good.   I ordered this based on other Yelper's reviews and just ""wow"".   Topped with a miso glaze, the subtle sweetness is like a protective coating for the delicate fish as it discovers safe passage through your mouth, down your esophagus and into your stomach.  Perfect fish dish.  Truly on point.  10/10 will order again and again.

Now.  About that 24oz bone-in ribeye.   My body just almost shut down thinking about it's greatness.  It's almost as if I am not worthy to eat it.   Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned; it was the most juiciest steak I've ever eaten in a very, very long time.  In fact, I recommended Joe's to a friend and well-seasoned traveler/foodie from Europe last week and he messaged me almost immediately raving about how amazing his steak was.   It was out of this world good.  I'm almost convinced that this was the best steak I've eaten in my life.

I'm licking my lips and painfully strategizing my next 'special occasion' to find a way back to this restaurant.  It's pricey yes, but worth every damn penny.   The service was spot on despite how busy the restaurant became.  The food; truly 5 stars. It's as good as it gets.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,7,2,5,wd3nS28j--xAWwOMVxy78g

This was my first time having stone crab claws & I thought they were just so-so. The texture was a little like a flakey white fish, dense & less sweet than Dungeness crab meat (my fave kind.) At over $10 per Large claw (an order comes with five), a taste of Joe's does not come cheap. And the mustard sauce (spicy from the horseradish) was good, but I'm going to call 'overhyped' on their namesake dish. 

The three of us also shared a crab cake entree ($24, too much breadcrumb filler), a salad & the 'Second Mortgage' appetizer ($16) which was the best thing we tried. I especially liked the jumbo prawn & shrimp & scallop ceviche that was included in the appetizer. 

Service from everyone we encountered was five stars-- very professional, but given that I've had better crab cakes at The Palm a few doors down & the stone crabs hit my wallet pretty hard, I'm giving their food a lukewarm three stars.

Once seated, the drinks and yummy complementary bread and butter came out.  All of the breads were so yummy we asked for another.  For dinner, we weren't super hungry so we shared a Crab Bisque ($10), Scallops ($37), and Selected Stone Crabs ($50).  The Crab Bisque was out of this world amazing.  The bowl came empty with just some celery and other ingredients in it.  The actual bisque was poured in our bowl by our friendly waiter.  It was full of flavor and was delicious with our complementary breadds.  It's definitely worth getting and actually cheap for what you get.  I highly recommend it.  The Seared Sea Scallops came out sitting on some sort of potato cake.  These were also amazing.  I think there were about six of them and all of them were seared perfectly.  I would totally order this again.  And lastly their famous Stone Crabs.  I love that it was broken for you so you all you need to do is dunk them in the sauce it came with and eat.  Yum!  The meat was super sweet and super fresh.  So good!

If you have ""stone crab"" in your restaurant's name, I suggest you get on top of the availability of primary menu items.  I felt like a character in the Monty Python cheese shop skit.

My waiter informed me he would comp me for the scallops (which were pretty meh... 15 or more on the plate, too tough, too salty).  When the bill arrived, I was comped instead for a slice of pie (Marie Callander style frozen pie with cardboard crust) and a cup of coffee.

2807813,2017-01-04,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"This one is a keeper.  Let's start with our server - Linda.  She was friendly, helpful, and frankly delightful.  She has this lovely London accent, and it was very pleasant chatting with her - at length and on topics ranging far beyond the menu.  But she was also serious about wanting us to enjoy every aspect of our meal.  This was not the typical waiter mumbling ""is everything okay?"" as he speeds past your table.  Linda was seriously concerned that everything was perfect, and anxious to fix anything that wasn't.  She even told us about a shortcut that shaved 15 minutes off of our trek back to the Caesar's Palace parking lot, without having to walk all the way through the Forum Shops.  (By the way, we also learned that the better way to come by car is to park with Joe's own valet at the entrance off the Strip.)

As this was our first visit to Joe's, our first impression of the food was going to be the bread basket.  Check.  A very nice assortment of fresh bread, rolls, and flatbread.  I was not prepared to do the laborious claw-cracking that would have come with ordering the house specialty Stone Crabs, but I did want to try the crab so I started with the crab cake appetizer.  I don't really expect to find Maryland-quality crab cakes anywhere in Vegas, and I still don't, but this crab cake was quite good.  Plump lumps of crab without too much filler.  Still focused on the crab, my next course was a small cup of the crab bisque.  It was excellent.  Just the right amount of crab flavor.  (Actually, the small cup was not on the menu, but Linda to the rescue - she arranged for a cup rather than a bowl of the soup, so I could save appetite for the main course.)  Which was... Chilean Sea Bass.  A very nice piece of fish, perfectly cooked.  My only quibble is that the Miso glaze, although flavorful, left the top of the fish tasting a bit over-salty.  If I was awarding Michelin stars, this small imperfection might have been an issue.  But these are Yelp! stars, and I'm still giving 5 of them.

My wife had the seafood salad.  My wife is a bit picky about her ingredients, but there was Linda again - going over each component of the salad, and getting the kitchen to hold all the ingredients that were not to my wife's taste.  She loved the salad.  We also shared a side of hash brown potatoes, which was plenty big for two people - we couldn't finish it.  The hash browns were unusual - a mound of potatoes that was very crispy on top, but light and fluffy inside.  My wife and I both enjoyed them very much.

Joe's is very popular, but also very large.  Don't be fooled by the small bar area and patio, which is what you see as you walk in.  After 5 p.m. the main dining rooms open, with lots of tables.  Somehow Joe's does a good job of packing a lot of tables into their space, without making it feel crowded and still keeping down the noise level.  I found the decor to be very comfortable, without much decoration.  A mural-sized photo of the original Joe's in Miami, and a few photographs on one wall, were the extent of the adornments in our dining room, and that was fine for me.

Finally, price...  I thought our meal was a very good value.  Even with cocktails and wine, we were out the door for well under $200.  That's pretty good for a restaurant that Yelp! rates with three $$$.  There are a lot of good values on the menu, and you could easily eat at Joe's on a reasonable budget.

We also got their mashed potatoes and I figured they'd just be regular potatoes nothing special. But wow...they put all sorts of cheese on it and bake it i believe. I got the large size and it's way too much for two people. We had to take the rest home!

Excellent steaks, sides and appetizers. We always start our meal with an order of  stone crabs (3 to 4 per person of the medium is plenty) and their seafood salad. I love the spice mix they bring to the table for the steak. I love it so much that when I wanted to make a surf n turf meal for my family, I  emailed them for the recipe and got it. Talk about customer service!  During our last visit, we ordered the tres leches cake and the coconut cream pie. They let you order halfsies so you can try more of them.

We ordered the Filet Oscar which is an 6oz Filet and a piece of King Crab leg.  The asparagus was undercooked which is how they are so that part I didn't like but wife loved it which is all that matters.  The Filet was so so soft and juicy....definitely the best Filet I had.  Also ordered the stone crabs just to try and that is not worth it for the price is way too high.

I was leary of eating cold crab legs, but wow! It was the best tasting crab legs I have ever had. I had a half dozen kunamoto oysters, they were excellent - fresh with the usual accompanying dressings. I was in the mood for just a small serving of steak so I ordered the petite filet. It was cooked to perfection - pink in the middle and juicy. Something about the way they seared the steak created an amazing flavor and texture. It had a slightly charred character that made me crave the next bite before I finished chewing the current one. I was hesitant to add their peppercorn seasoning to the steak because I like to taste just the steak, but once I did, it was addictingly good. The mashed potatoes were covered in a parmesan crust. Delicious. Overall I have to say that this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. I highly recommend.

I almost forgot to mention, the manager, Tim, was incredibly helpful, cordial, and professional. His recommendations were spot on, and we could tell that he had a genuine interest in making sure we had the best dining experience possible.

2821316,2017-01-23,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I so wanted to like this place, as I am a foodie and love steakhouses. The reviews were very good, the restaurant was close and there was a good time available. As I was alone, I was given a small table close to the kitchen, which was understandable. However, I didn't really enjoy the constant parade of waiters brushing my shoulder every time they went by. Service from my waiter was a bit slow and he was indifferent. Whenever I try a new steakhouse, I normally order my favorite, tenderloin Oscar Style. To me this is a perfect way to see if a steakhouse is worth its' salt. With a name like Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab expectations were understandably high. I ordered it medium rare. When it came, it came with crab on top and sauce on the side, it looked like a beautiful piece of meat but was disappointed when I cut into the middle of it and it was RAW, as in the top 1/4"" and bottom 1/4"" were cooked properly but the middle 1"" looked blue. When I told my waiter that it was RAW in the middle, he started an argument with me by asking me ""I thought you ordered it medium rare?"", I said ""I did, but this is RAW in the middle."" ""So you don't want it medium rare?"" I said, ""That isn't medium rare."" ""You sure?"" as he made a big show of bending down and examining the steak and then giving a patronizing look. ""So you would like your steak cooked medium, then?"" I said ""Medium rare"" He eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and 20 min later came out with it again. The steak was now overcooked, the sides were cold, which means they didn't keep my plate warm, the crab was now off to the side and not on top and the béarnaise sauce was cold. I know I was a single table but I didn't deserve to be treated like crap. I'm sure most people get treated better than I but I cannot recommend this place to anybody. I've had much better food and service at the Charcoal Room at Palace Station and the Steakhouse at Circus Circus. Ceasers' deserves better.",mBvq0FTzh5FY8aQ-xJ4R2Q,0,0,2,Z8aMrvxqpflDYSISjWWeog

2825169,2012-11-19,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"OK, this is a review for their seafood - as I've never eaten steaks there before.

I used to love this restaurant. The last time I was in Vegas, I stayed for 3 month - I take a long vacation every year,,, about 2 years ago. I went to Joe's probably 5 times to eat king/stone crabs and shrimps and such. It was amazing. 5 stars back then.

This time I have been staying in Vegas for over 2 month already, eating out everyday and night - spending a lot of $$$$. Sadly enough, I have found quality of Vegas restaurant business has gone pretty bad. Maybe it's because of the depression. Maybe they've found easier way to get more money - like night club. Well, whatever the reason was, I decided to go to Joe's to refresh myself,,,, hopefully not to waste money anymore.

Service - Outstanding. They are the professionals.

Atmosphere - 3 stars as always. Not so special but it is all ok with me.

Food - 

Crabs - Not good anymore. They are pretty much tasteless. I don't know what happened to them. Simply tasteless. Not worth eating it even if it's $5.

Ceviche - Terrible. It was amazing last time, tho, this time it was like stuffing out of a cheap seafood taco made by hole in the wall type of place in LA. They don't even use cilantro and red onion. They made it with some sort of salsa. Shrimps and scallops didn't have any flavor. They were just chewy thing without any taste. TERRIBLE.

Lobsters - flavorless again. It doesn't even smell like a lobster. 

Oysters - It is OK. 2 years ago, it was MUCH BETTER, tho.

We have to walk away as soon as we finished drinking wines. All we order was just appetizer - ended up paying more than $100 for these small items. 

I was gonna rate it 3 stars for the service, but no,,,, I have to be honest because I don't want you to be disappointed. Don't get crabs and shrimps this year (they were saying it was very seasonal, fresh, and good. Turned out to be pretty crappy). Maybe next year, they may able to find good seafood.

i took my mom and my husband there. restaurant is located i. the forum shop mall at caesar palace. closer to the strip and across from the starbucks.
i made a booking on Open Table.
you have the little indoor patio (indoor because inside the mall) and a room that is more casual. menu remain the same one as the back restaurant room that is more chic, elegant and very classic. to access that room i will recommend you to call and make a booking.
our waiter was very courteous.
as i was going through the menu i had a firework in my brain! everything sound so so delicious.
we ordered a nice Moscato bottle to make my mom happy.
we ordered some oysters and a clam chowder
then some stone crab (large) but honestly go for the small ones. my husband is not a fish or sea food amateur so he got he Porterhouse (come hungry for it).
I ordered the steak tartare and mom had a aged chopped steak.
we finished our dinner by sharing their famous Key lime pie and some coffee.
Food network show made a big deal of the key lime pie - i was disappointed by it. nothing amazing at all just a key lime pie

Our waitress came over and got our drink order, and about 10 minutes later they finally arrived with some bread selections.  Other people have commented that their bread was warm, but ours was cold.  The selection of different choices was a treat, and the lavashe covered with melted parmesan cheese went well with my Bacardi and tonic.  For our meal my wife and I decided to share an order of 7 large stone crab claws, shrimp cocktail, oysters Rockefeller, and the Aged 16 oz NY Steak.  Everything, and I mean everything was top notch.  The oysters were filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach; the shrimp cocktail, while not quite Morton's grade, was  tasty and had nice sized shrimp, the steak was thick, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the stone crabs.....Words cannot explain how good these were.  Growing up in a Pan-Asian setting in Hawaii, there are very few sea foods that I haven't tried.  From Jellyfish salad, to raw squid, we have it all there.  I've had Dungenous, Maryland Blue, King, Snow, and last night finally, I got to cross Stone crab off my list.  While pricy at about  $60 for 7 Large pieces, they are divine.  Huge fatty pieces of perfect claw meat await you after taking off the pre-cracked shell.  Follow that up with a dip in Joe's famous mayo sauce, and you have the food that the gods were suckled on.  And oh yeah, we ordered a bottle of bubbly to compliment the sea food, and  cut the fattiness of the of the steak.  Overall, a great meal, and a great start to our Honeymoon in Vegas.  I would eat here every week if I could, but at $300 including tip, I wouldn't be able to make my car payment.  That being said, the service, although very friendly was slow, and I know that it was because it was so late, and we were literally the last seating, but I have been to places in NY and Chicago that were the same caliber of food, had a late res, and they took care of us the entire way.  Last night it felt like a great meal, but a little rushed.  Never a good feeling when you drop 3 bills for a meal.  So a little our fault, a little theirs.

Celebrated the beau and I 7 years anniversary on Jan 1st and made reservations. It wasn't too busy so if we didn't make reservations I'm pretty sure we would have gotten in quickly. They have a bar area and a fine dining seating. It was a very secluded area, kind of romantic, very elegant.

Upon seating we got a basket of breads, crackers, corn bread and butter. We were noticed right away by waiters and waitresses. They explained the menu in detail and even helped us choose what would be better for us. 

For appetizer we got The Whale which comes with Alaskian King crabs, shrimp, lobster tail and scallop shrimp ceviche. It is ordered by how many people is in your party. So the order was for two of us so it was about $24/person. This was really already a good amount of seafood but you know we weren't going to stop there.

We both ordered petite filet mignon which was 8 oz. That was like perfect size maybe even a an oz. too much for me and we also ordered a 1 pound of alaskian king crab which was A LOT! We didn't realize that it would be that much for just the two of us. The crab was so perfect though. It is already cracked open for you and it is sooooo meaty. So much crab in each bite.

Working with the folks at Joe's was super easy and they were able to accommodate so many of my unique requests and last minute changes to the set menu. Jessica and Khaveri were super professional and communicated so well with me. I had some sour experiences with trying to book through Caesar's special events (which Joe's is not apart of), so to work with people who understand quality and customer service was such a blessing during this hectic time. 

When it came to the actual reception, our service and food were impeccable. I've had to give up crab due to a shellfish allergy, so I enviously watched as the dinner guests dined on the stone crab. I chose the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and myself and the groom (also allergic to shellfish), both commented that it was one of the best takes on the dish that we've ever had. The bride and groom were so impressed at the spread. The bride was admiring the seasoning on her steak, and one of our waiters came out instantly with their packaged seasoning for her to take home. They even emptied and packed up the wine bottles from the dinner for the bride to use as part of a shadowbox for later. 

Even if you're not in need of a place to hold a reception, Joe's is great for lunch and dinner. I've dined here many times and have always been treated so well by everyone I've encountered. Most recently I took my in-laws here for my mother-in-law's birthday and our waiter Daniel Z. was so impressive! Not only did he offer up some great recommendations and made sure we made it on time to our 7:30pm show (offering a shortcut to us as well), he made sure to make my mother-in-law feel special on her birthday as well.

Just in case you are also having trouble finding it, begin entering the Forum shops from the registration lobby and then turn right until you reach the escalators leading down to Las Vegas Blvd. The restaurant is located there. 

The appetizers and sides were tasty and filling. The Tuna Tartar was the favorite among the group. It was fresh and you could also add the tuna on top of the chip for that fresh crunchy texture. I had the Chilean Sea Bass dish and I liked it. It was tender and flavorful with the miso glaze. However, I did find myself comparing it to the Season 52's Chilean Sea Bass dish from their 2016 Spring menu and thought that their dish was slightly better than this one.

After having our dinner here, I have decided Joe's is actually a 3-star restaurant hidden behind their parade of waiters in suits and their famous Stone Crab. 

In a city bustling with celebrity chef restaurants, Joe's fails to scratch at the surface of the upper echelon that consists of places like SW Steakhouse or Joel Robuchon. There's no single bad element that defines Joe's, but it was a combination of little miscues that diminished my experience here. 

1) mac & cheese was too runny for my liking. I thought gourmet mac & cheese would have more texture, but this side dish was slathered in Kraft-like liquid cheese.

2) Most upscale joints have their waiters/assistants scrap off bread crumbs off the white tablecloth onto a pan. Details like that are supposed to enhance your fine-dining experience. But this particular evening, the assistant to our waiter just scraped the breadcrumbs onto the ground. I felt that small detail made my dinner less-than-memorable. 

3) The complimentary bread was less than stellar. I have had better bread at lower $$ establishments. I liked that there was variety to the bread basket, but some of the choices tasted stale. 

Pops and I both ordered the steak & lobster dinner. Dinner tasted delicious, but it fails to distinguish itself from previous steak and seafood joints I have eaten at. Is Joe's worth visiting once in your lifetime? Yes, it has some good qualities. The mashed potatoes were very good and I enjoyed the custom-inked cloth napkins in the upstairs restroom.

Yet, i never felt  forgotten or rushed thru our meal.  

Our server Todd provided outstanding service.  His recommendations were spot on, and he provided guidance to our party of 8 on how to order and share our side dishes, without wasting food.  We had the seasonal roasted corn, loaded lyonnaise potatoes, and broccolini.  All three were flavorful and seasoned jut right. 

My meal started with a perfect martini served in a classic martini glass.  My least favorite item was the Ceasars salad; it was just okay. My husband's lobster bisque balanced out the poor salad; the soup was piping hot with superb blend of cream and lobster chunks. 

I shared a bone in ribeye with my friend, and I'm glad I did.  The portion was very large, and cooked perfectly to our request.  The steak was served on two separate plates, ready for us to dig in without having to cut it and divide up ourselves.  My mouth is watering thinking about it now. 

Todd recommended the key lime and Havana pies.  My husband and I shared the Havana pie.  Oh my goodness!  Perfect ending to our perfect meal.  Highly recommend.  

Last but not least, we were pleasantly surprised to learn the restaurant offered a VERY generous military discount.  This discount was greatly appreciated and will make this a repeat restaurant when we return to Vegas.  
Since our party of 8 is retired Air Force guys, we all were tickled pink when we got the discount.  We then went back to casino after dinner to see if our luck continued, and it did.

So I went through the cheaper route while dining here so I'm pretty sure I didn't get the full experience.  I ordered the filet mignon (6 oz) lunch special at I believe $27 which comes with Joes Grilled Tomato and Jennies Mashed Potatoes.  It also comes with a selection of a slice of pie, which I chose the Havana.  

The steak was cooked very well and they do bring out some steak salt to season to your liking.  Honestly, I would rather have the chef season it his taste so as the seasoning can permeate the meat better but not everyone would feel the same way.  The tomato was topped with their famous creamed spinach and topped with cheddar cheese under a broiler for a few seconds.  The spinach was very rich and I am glad I didn't get a full order of that.  The sampling was just enough for me.  The potatoes were also seasoned with bread crumbs and more cheese.  A very rich meal that relies on comfort food.  

That dessert though.... To sum it up, essentially like a dulce de leche pie made from the heavens.  They make their pies in house and you can definitely tell.  Each bite was so rich yet so good, coffee does wonders with this dessert.  My friend also got the same combo and ordered the key lime pie.  Damn. The dessert chef here knows his/her stuff.  Be sure to order a slice if you don't get the combo.

Service was very hospitable and welcoming, and the bread baskets will definitely fill you up if you're not careful. They serve about 5 different types of bread for all kinds of different tastes.  Although I didn't get order oysters from here, I was still very satisfied. Next time, I'll come back and try what everyone else raves about and also in their name, the stone crabs. :)",OKKfEypDO-42cBQaddaeQQ,11,12,5,QdH1OjLw_tgVT3-xoV8iOQ

I agree with Keith, the food is a bit pricey--those little stone crab claws are reaching for the loot.  Though, I think $36 for a 12oz USDA Prime filet mignon is a great deal!

Starting from the beginning, we were seated immediately (being a Tuesday evening, things on the Strip aren't too lively).  The wait staff are very neatly dressed in suits with white linen napkins draped over their arms.  We were told the specials and were even given recommendations from our knowledgable waiter.  Let it be known, he never tried to up-sell us or push menu items on us, which I think is very professional.

We share a caesar which was nothing fancy.  It consisted of the normal chopped romaine, croutons, and large thin slices of parmesan, all tossed in a very light caesar dressing (almost similar to a vinigrette).  It seemed like a small portion, even for being the ""shared"" size.

My entree was the 12oz filet mignon which was cooked to perfection--medium.  It was at least an 1 1/2"" thick!  Todd ordered the petite filet with stone crab.  This was the first time Todd has eaten stone crab and he isn't quite sure what all the hype is about?  While he had his own petite filet, he also tried mine and said, ""I think my steak was better.""  Overall, our entrees were plated very nicely but kind of lacked flavor.  

Our sides with our meals consisted of:
1) pan roasted sweet corn--simple, yet good
2) steamed asparagus with lemon butter--needed seasoning, bland
3) macaroni & cheese--very good, baked, light crumb topping

The steaks are always juicy and cooked to perfection especially with all bone-in choices, the stone crab claws are the best and fresh daily, and the last time we had the Alaskan king crab they were the size of my arm, and that's no lie, just ask Suzanne the only server to ask for, we let her select all of our choices for us and shes never done us wrong yet and we will continue to do so as long as we keep coming back.

I went to Joe's this past weekend to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  She loves crab, so I thought the perfect restaurant would be Joe's Stone Crab. Neither of us have ever had stone crabs before.  We had a 9PM reservation on Saturday night. After ordering, the waiter came back and informed us that they had run out of stone crabs. At first I thought he was joking, but then I realized he was completely serious.  I was initially shocked and then thoroughly disappointed that the special plans I made were now ruined.  So we canceled the stone crabs we had ordered, and the stone crabs that were in the ""Whale"" appetizer were substituted with a small piece of Alaskan King Crab (I felt they could have done a lot more than that).  Is a 9PM dinner in Las Vegas on a Saturday night really that late of a dinner - should I have anticipated this shortage? I don't think I should have. Let this be a warning to all that come for the claws - come early or else!

I understand that the logistics of flying in a perishable product fresh every day. I do get that - I'm a rational/logical person. It doesn't change the fact that I was initially very upset, which just turned into major disappointment on this special occasion.  I mean, it's called ""Joe's Stone Crab"".  It's in the freaking name!  How can you run out of the very product you're named after? (That's a tongue in cheek, rhetorical question by the way - I've already acknowledged understanding the logistics.)

For what it's worth, the food and service were good. Although my lobster was a bit dry on the edges (especially given the price), the sides and dessert were very good. The other food that I had sampled (NY Strip) was good as well, but if you can't cook a steak properly in Vegas, you may just as well shut your doors.  My friends all enjoyed their food and drink (although since I was footing the bill, they wouldn't have said otherwise so, who knows!). The highlights were the loaded roasted corn (excellent), hashbrowns, and the peanut butter pie (skip the banana cream pie).  They were nice enough to bring my girlfriend a dessert at the end for her birthday (although this was after we had ordered two desserts to share among five of us). I guess it was a nice gesture, but why didn't they offer that before we ordered dessert? We just took it with us, and it wasn't very good the next day.

The service was friendly and unobtrusive.  The waiter deterred us from getting two different versions of the hashbrowns as they portions are very large, and we were very glad he did. The restaurant added an automatic gratuity of 18% for our table of five, which I'm glad the waiter pointed out to me. I found this a little odd, because I think in the long run, automatic gratuity for small parties doesn't favor the waitstaff. I typically tip about 20% on the pre-tax subtotal because it's easy to calculate, so I wasn't taken back by it either.

I feel like I could have had the same steak and lobster type dinner at one of two dozen restaurants in Vegas, without the long walk through the Caesar's mall (ten-fifteen minute walk from taxi to restaurant) and the bitter disappointment at the beginning of the meal.  Would I have gone to this restaurant knowing they didn't have Stone Crabs? Certainly not.  Will I attempt to dine there again in the future?  Probably not at that location. I will wait until I make it to Miami so I can have reasonable assurance they will not run out of stone crabs.",fR_QfvcETUc0Hzih6fbQvg,4,1,3,CswA8fNFcViipOy8fi-Rcg

We were seated at a booth in their back room. Our waitor was fantastic. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.

We ordered calamari for an appetizer. I love calamari and order it almost anywhere I can. I'm from New England so I love seafood. This was probably some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had. It wasn't chewy at all, with a melt in your mouth texture. The seasoning was perfect.

My husband ordered the petite filet. It was, also, cooked perfect. Warm red center and didn't even need a steak knife to cut through.

I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. It was really good. Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but still really good. I do wish I would have ordered the petite filet after tasting my husbands, though. It was that good.

At first I tht it was more of a casual sports bar (front bar area)... but then I we were ushered to the back and brought right onto our table. Into a proper steak house . 

I had the bone-in filet mignon , my friends had the bison steak and the bone-in rib eye . Medium rare all around! And yes, yes you must do the stone crabs!!!! Now at $50 a plate for just 6... you might hesitate... but honestly. We ended up ordering 2 plates! They're that good. So just, treat yo' self!",eiF9AQS7QOZfYe6W6F_sxA,1,1,5,GFkuXgBY0XsJOHYqqdogng
2938282,2012-03-16,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I thought about stealing the container of salt from overseas so I could bathe myself in it later that night. I know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you sprinkled that happiness onto your perfectly cooked filet mignon, you'd want to bathe every inch of yourself with it too. Don't believe me? Try it. You won't complain.

We received a large gift certificate for being frequent diners at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants (see my review of Mon Ami Gabi), so we decided to try Joe's. Since we were starving, and all I could think of was cow and things that crawl on the bottom of the ocean, we dove straight in and ordered entrees...after 2 glasses of wine of course. The red malbec was FANTASTIC and went very well with my cow and sea creatures. My fiance ordered the fisherman's platter, fried, and I ordered the petite filet mignon and jumbo king crab. Our orders were perfection.

Fried seafood is difficult to make and to cook it well enough to maintain the freshness of the seafood and not the dry, overcooked nature of cheap frozen grocery seafood. Joe's doesn't fry their seafood. They lightly dip scallops, shrimp cod and calamari in an airy batter and then after brushing them through an oil bath they place them ever so delicately on your entree plate. They may as well just pop each piece in your mouth because that's what happens when the plate hits the table. This was not fried seafood, this was seafood done right with a blatant disregard for calories. I didn't even have to eat it to know that the look of content on my fiance's face had nothing to do with me.

Now onto the filet. Oh that filet. I love rare cow. If I am at a steakhouse, I will order the steak rare to see if they are truly a steakhouse. Oh yes, my friends, this is a steak house...more like a steak heaven. This petite filet was cooked PERFECTLY. No chewiness here, just soft, tender filet mignon drizzled in the salt mix (please see first paragraph for further loving of the salt mix). Even the waiter was doing a side glance of my cow, knowing that my senses were on overload. The crab? There's a reason they're known for snow crab, but their king crab made me want to do the Snoopy dance in the middle of the restaurant. No butter needed, absolutely no butter needed for this crab...but I did use some anyways because I can never decline butter. The crab was juicy, they cracked the crab for you so you didn't have to cut your hands open doing it yourself, and it melted in my mouth. That dinner was worth every penny we spent and then some. The service, hands down some of the best service I have ever received at a restaurant. Superb.

So while you go and go bananas on some crab legs and filet at Joe's now, I will go to bed and have sweet, sweet dreams of cow and crab. This can only end deliciously.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,2,0,5,N9jzQ7zTf-y9toEBHGW5SQ

Long story.

You have to order seafood or beef here that is what they do.

My husband ordered the rib eye sandwich and I ordered the maui maui lunch plate. My waitress suggest that I order a side dish because she thought it wouldn't be enough food so I ordered the heirloom tomatoes.

Someone soon brings out a bread basket, I do have to say that it was a very good above average bread basket with yummy pretzel bread, a cheese and onion roll and other breads.

We received the tomatoes and I do note that the tomatoes were stunning great tomatoes but I hated the vinaigrette because it had chunks of gelatin in it and I thought that was gross. My husband didn't mind the chunks of gelatin so some people might like it that way. I was able to eat the tomatoes if I scraped the gelatin chunks off.

We receive the meals and my husband said the rib eye was pretty good but had a lot of butter poured on it. My maui maui was nice and fresh but was DROWNING in butter. The jicama slaw that came with my meal was almost good but I couldn't eat it after I tasted it because it was totally oil saturated.

We started off the night with the special Stone Crab Claws. These are the famous claws from Florida that are harvested from the crabs without killing them. I saw an episode of Man Vs Food and put it on list of things to try if I was ever in Miami. Just think how excited I was when I learned that this restaurant was started by the owners of the Miami restaurant.

Back to the claws, one word - AMAZING -. Being Filipino, I have been exposed to some awesome seafood. The combination of salt water and sweet crab meat was incredible. Each of us has two claws each. I could have had more, but the meal had just started.

For my entree, I ordered the bone in Rib Eye ""Oscar Style"". Oscar style is when you add crab meat, steamed asparagus, and hollandaise sauce on top of your meal. The steak was cooked to order (Medium Rare) and the ""Oscar Style"" topped off the meal excellently.

When I finally narrowed down where we would be going for my Birthday dinner, I easily made a reservation via OpenTable and requested a table in the back (got this info from other Yelp reviews) and said it was going to be my Birthday. 

We took a cab to Caesar's after getting a very late start to the day, did a little gambling and then walked through the Forum Shoppes to the restaurant. We were escorted to the Host Desk for the back of the restaurant and were seated in a large booth looking onto the rest of the back room. Everyone was friendly and worked together as a team seamlessly. 

Our waiter was very reserved while still having a nice sense of humor. I ordered a Cosmo which was perfectly balanced and with a perfect punch. The bread basket was yummy with lavash to devour and an assortment of breads. Our favorite was a cheese and shallot ciabatta. We started with a medium order of  the Stone Crabs (less sweet than Dungeness but more meaty and tender). It came with a mayo based dipping sauce, but I asked for cocktail sauce and they also brought clarified butter). The cocktail sauce was awesome and had a nice kick on  its own, but what was so cool is that there was a dollop of horseradish on the side like a garnish, but to allow each guest to make their cocktail sauce a spicy as they want it. It was something I had never seen before and quite memorable.

We shared a chopped salad which was kindly split in the kitchen. It was underdressed and one of the items we wished we hadn't ordered. For our mains, the Husband opted for the Beef Wellington (as rare as possible) and I ordered the bone in ribeye- medium rare. For sides to share, we opted for the GreenBeans ammadine (not almandine) and the special of AuGratin Potatoes. My steak was beautiful. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned and truthfully probably the best rib eye I have eaten in a restaurant of any caliber (and I have had many). The Wellington was too rare for me to taste, but the husband loved it and we really liked the green beans. The only ""miss"" here were the potatoes as they were pretty unremarkable and missing cheese and proper seasoning.

I had been looking forward to the key lime pie I had been reading about as my birthday dessert, so when the waiter brought out a very rich chocolate brownie sundae with a candle, I was a bit disappointed. I am a peasant when it comes to chocolate (I consider milk See's the fancy kind I like), this brownie was so rich even my husband could only muster a few bites. When our waiter came by, I inquired about a slice of the key lime pie, and he asked if I wanted a half slice (who knew they could do that?). I was glad I spoke up and my half slice arrived promptly and was the perfect way for me to end a rich and satisfying meal.

Walked up at 7pm and it was a 2 hour wait for the ""restaurant"" section, and was advised to try the ""bar/casual"" area.... where we were sat immediately.
Same menu... Same food....No wait.

Happy to see that you can get a sandwich or salad... not just steak or crab.
And... they had steaks starting at $25.... which on the strip is pretty hard to do at a nice restaurant.  So, this was a happy surprise.  

Started with Bread... good bread too.  :)

Then we tarted with stone crab as an appetizer.  I was surprised at how sweet these were.  They serve it with a cream dipping sauce which is totally not needed as the crab is good on its own.

I had Bacon wrapped Scallops for dinner.  Something about bacon and scallops.... a great combo.  The scallops were tender and grilled nicely.

The husband had the special Stripe Bass which was moist and flavorful, and topped with yummy mushrooms.

Our friends each had a steak cooked perfectly to their order.  They looked really good and they both said they were really good.

For sides, we got the Mac n Cheese, Potatoes Lyonnaisse, Mashed Potatoes, Broccolini.
The Mac n Cheese was more creamy than cheesy.
I like the Potatoes Lyonnaisse better than the Mashed.... the Lyon one came with carmelized onions on top of cubed, hash brown like potatoes.
Broccolini was nice and crunchy which is how I like my veggies so this was perfect for me.

Service was good... our water glasses were refilled regularly.
Sitting in the bar area was nice since you got to people watch or watch a game on one of their TVs.

For 4 people... plus a bottle of wine, our total before tip was $295.  In Vegas, on the strip... for a nice steak/seafood dinner..to me that is reasonable.  I may be jaded but I like to eat out and try different places so I'm glad we went here.

We sat in their ""outdoor"" seating so we can people watch. Attentive service as per pro tool in any upscale Vegas restaurant. The lobster bisque was delicious. Tasty and not too salty. Creamy and satisfying. I opted for the seafood salad (but really I should've gotten the tacos). Small portions, lumps of cold crab and pieces of half shrimp with the shredded greens. I was not that impressed. The dish was pretty blah. We had a bottle of Rose to go with lunch. Not a bad deal for 60 bucks a bottle. The caesar salad was ok. Love that they use big fat anchovies with it. Though the salad was a bit on the tart side.

The prices were pretty steep. Our bill was almost 300 bucks, for lunch!! Thats pretty ridiculous. I could've gone to Per Se and gotten a solid meal for that price. It was ridiculous also considering that we ate salads! Wow. So personally I thick it's overpriced and overhyped.

FOOD
When in Rome, so I had the Stone Crab.  After that decision had been made, I looked for other accompanying dishes and found a few gems.  The bread basket had 6 different & delicious breads - my favorite being the pretzel that is pictured here on Yelp. The cup of Crab Bisque was buttery with just the right amount of salt - probably could have a whole bowl.  The Caesar Salad had just the right amount of dressing although wasn't something I couldn't have gotten elsewhere.  The Select Stone Crabs were meaty & tasty as was the mustard sauce it came with.  The Hashed Browns were just okay and probably a lot more than I needed.  (And that was a HALF order)   And the coffee was brewed very well - no bitterness in there at all.

Bread basket:  4/5
Stone Crab Bisque:  5/5
Caesar Salad:  4/5
Select Stone Crab Entree:  4/5
Side Hashed Browns:  3/5
Coffee:  4/5


SERVICE
My server, whom I know the name of however I will refrain from using it because of the comment at the end of this review just in case, was genuinely as good as it gets.  Prompt.  Informed.  Courteous.  Friendly.  Accommodating.  This is frankly as good as I can expect without him comping my whole meal.

He advised adjustments to the portion size of my orders (""half orders, sir"") to ensure that I'd have room for everything.  The staff was Johnny-on-the-spot with every plate and the bussing was prompt enough.  My glass was almost always full and I never had to ask for the check or the status of a dish.


ATMOSPHERE
This is a beautiful restaurant, with an air of class and a bit of authority.  The folks in the main dining room know that the immediacy of service is important as is knowledge of the dishes so the people that work there seem focused on making sure people get the right dish for their tastes and they are all dressed the part.

Make no mistake, this is a more formal restaurant expecting a relatively nice dress code.  Not exactly ""coats mandatory"" but jeans on men at least are probably discouraged.  Slacker attire does stand out amongst the well dressed servers, dark wood booths, incandescent lighting, and draperies.


VALUE
$65 for everything above sans tip.  Not bad at all, and that was with the higher end ""Select"" Stone Crab.  The reason you might buy the ""Select"" Stone Crab is to get larger claws so that you spend less time shelling the cracked claws and more time eating the big beefy morsels.


CONCLUSION
I'll be back for certain.  It's not quite at that ""irresistable"" level however it definitely warrants several return trips - especially with the wifey.  Another thing:  This restaurant doesn't belong in the Forum shops - it's too classy and deserves better than the be across from a ""Sony Style"" retail shop.  They ought to pull up roots and move to the Palazzo where Sheldon Adelson could use a good restaurant with good value.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

I called to confirm on 09/29 and to increase the guest count to eleven.

This morning, prior to lunch, Joe's called me to confirm my reservation for ten. I corrected them that the reservation is for eleven, not ten, two tables on the patio, one of (5) and one of (6).

Upon arrival, a long table of four-tops had been set for eleven people. Two people had to sit pressed together at the end of the table which was uncomfortable for those guests.

We advised the waiter that we had two $25.00 coupons which he declined, allowing one per table.

Maître d Thomas offered to reassemble us into two tables to accommodate the discount coupons, however we chose to remain seated as we were rather than create ruckus at the lunch hour.

Another reason for specifically asking for two tables was that it becomes a bookkeeping headache to breakdown a check of eleven people as most guests prefer to pay by credit card; this is essentially a business lunch.

Our waiter said separate checks are not allowed but that he could break the table into three checks.

The $25.00 coupon was applied to all three checks, the tip of course, was added to the total bill.

We managed to dissect the bill, figure the discount and the tip and make arrangements to repay the person who paid by credit card.

I had announced to the reservations person, Kayla, that we are locals, as she indeed could see by my phone number in Joe's records.

This is what the people in my party did, and the food was no less delicious for it.  To start, the bread was quite tasty.  For dinner, I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Sandwich and substituted sweet potato fries for regular (at no additional cost).  Joe's serves this sandwich akin to sliders, with three small sandwiches on the plate.  The tenderloin was excellent quality, and the bread it was served on was phenomenal.  One other person in my party ordered the Ribeye Sandwich, also from the Bar Menu, and was able to substitute a salad for fries.  This sandwich is served on a sub-type roll.  A very good quality sandwich as well.  We ordered grilled asparagus as a side, which I would say was the only disappointing part of the meal.  It's not that the asparagus was bad, but I feel they charge too much for the quantity given.  When it came time for dessert, the waitress explained they are all homemade.  I had several questions, which she patiently answered and described in further detail the desserts I asked about.  She also explained that each dessert is large enough to share, and they also have ""half sizes"" not listed on the menu.  I decided to share the Chocolate Fudge cake, which was heavenly.

First off the crab claws are awesome and meaty and the serve them with a creamy spicy mustard sauce and it all works real good. 

Ok now the reason I gave this place 5 stars is because they serve the best steak I have ever had (three times), it is there signature cut 16oz aged bone in prime filet. I mean big, super tender, and a great aged flavor. Being bone in it is more flavorful than others. Their sides are all the standards but all are excellent and of course plenty big enought to share. 

By todays strip standards this place has pretty good prices.  Sides are between 5 and 8 bucks and the signature bone in steaks between 42 and 49  so all considered this place is about as reasonable as a steak house gets nowadays.  They have a selection of regular steaks for under 40 plus other chops, chicken, and seafood I have never tried.

This is not some hoity toity steak house that serves duck fat fries or tuna tartare taco appetizers, this is a great traditional classic American steak house.

They include two sides and dessert and there is usually a filet and a stone crab offering.  To my dismay on this visit...no stone crabs.  As a big fan of this sustainable food,  I'm well aware of the national shortage due to the squid infestation so I understood but was disappointed since it was the reason I was there.  Instead they were substituting king crab legs.  Our waiter did a good job of explaining the situation and eventually convinced me to give it a try.

It was a very good decision.  Still not the stone crabs I was craving but a very good option.  The legs were already split and full of cold, sweet crab meat.  The sides included their delicious roasted sweet corn along with equally as good lyonnaise potatoes.  For dessert the crab lunch came with Havanna Dream Pie which is more cake-like as in boston cream pie but which I really enjoyed.  Two of us had ordered the crab lunch and the waiter was nice enough to substitute key lime pie for one of us.  Overall, an excellent meal.

Others in our party had the fish and chips and the scallops.  None were disappointed and everybody loved their meal. My 90-year old Stepdad called them  ""The best scallops I've ever had.""  Would I have preferred the stone crabs that I came for?  Of course! The meal did not disappoint though.  

As for the location in the Forum Shops, it can be a little tricky to find but they do offer valet parking right outside the Joe's entrance to the mall which is great and worth the effort to find.

Either way, it may seem weird to be a place with stone crab in the name and then not have it sometimes. Stone crabs are seasonal though so...the more you know. I don't think this place merits low ratings just because people are not aware of this fact.

Luckily we came right at the start of the season so we had our fill of stone crabs claws and Alaskan king crab legs. 
Service here was spectacular and we were seated at the most perfect booth off in the corner. It felt very private and secluded but we were still able to see the whole restaurant and were never ignored by the staff. 

Everything was brought out at the perfect time, at the right temperature and we had everything we needed. All the crab was well cracked and easy to eat, and that mustard sauce was as good as I remember it being in Miami. 

I would recommend the steaks or the sole with the brown butter sauce. They filet it at the table and it is absolutely delicious.

A Miami landmark for over 80 years, it has been owned by the same family all this time. I was pleased and suprised to see one had been opened in Las Vegas. I suspect that the famed ""Lettuce Entertain You"" group out of Chicago is responsible for opening this one in Las Vegas as well as, the one that is now open in Chicago. What a perfect match!
        I had a 24 ounce Australian Lobster tail that was magnificent!  My wife had a petite Filet with stone crabs. The crabs were sweet and the mustard sauce was the same as in the Miami restaurant. Her steak was cooked to perfection. the potatoes Lionaisse and the creamed spinach with roasted garlic were as good as the Miami store. Service was impeccable and without the need to tip the Captain's $5 a head to get a table (Joe's in Miami is infamous for this). The place actually takes reservations, how civilized. The wine list was very good and fairly priced for an upscale restaurant.

I was part of a party of 7.  We started our meal with the sauteed garlic spinach, sauteed broccolini, and green beans amandine.  The portions were large enough that everyone had at least a few bites of each.  They were all excellent, perfectly seasoned and cooked right. Even the spinach didn't taste like mush.
 
Next, we had the Madagascar shrimp, which was THE best I've had...period.  The shrimp was HUGE and very tasty.  It had the smell of being fresh off the grill.  Finally, came the stone crabs...one of their signature items.  Now, I know the place is known for their stone crabs, but I still think the shrimp was better. Anyway, we had a huge order of it, so we all dug in. Now, since most of the others weren't big eaters (more for me), I was able to pig out.

Hubby & I luckily got invited to dine here for my lovely YAYA's 50th birthday party!! We started off at the bar while we waited for our reservations & got to see gorgeously rimmed martinis & cocktails being made. 

We were placed inna private room since we had a party of 14 & I think one of the guests were also a frequent diner. I wish I heard the server's name but there was so much going on w/ people talking that I don't recall his name =[ but whoever you are... you know who you are & you were FREAKEN AWESOME!! o8.26.15 was the date so to managent give this server props! One of the guests said he wanted fruit loops cereal as a joke & this guy pops up out of NO WHERE!! w/ a box of mini fruit loops cereal & says "" your dinner is served sir"" OMG OMG way to give the birthday girl the best laugh & wonderment of her life 

LARGE STONE CRAB $M/P - We got one claw each as an appetizer & my yaya & I also shared the large order for our main as well. These were served cold which I am definitely usually not a big fan of... but man!! These claws just were so freakishly DERICIOUS I just could stop stuffing my face! 

BLT WEDGE SALAD $15.95 - This salad was simple yet so good & refreshing 

BONE-IN RIB EYE $59.95 - rib eye just has the most flavor. HUGE 24 oz. Bone-in rib eye is the way to go w/ the most flavor packed juiciness!! The steak was cooked to perfection

ROASTED SWEET CORN $9.95 - this side is the most ADDDICTING thing I have put in my mouth & just had to keep having more & more even though I was stuffed 

BAKED POTATO $8.95 - topped w/ roasted onions & some sour cream on the side. It literally did not look like your average baked potato... it was crispy & soft all at the same time. The roasted onions also gave it a hint of sweetness.

BREAD - complimentary bread was served at the beginning & my favorite one was the roasted onion bread!! I ate 3 loaves... also came w/ pretzel bun, plain dinner roll, slice of some kind of raisain bread?, & cheese crisp flat bread....

CHOCOLATE CAKE - the birthday cake once cut was served w/ a cute little scoop of vanilla ice cream & I ate two!! Ugh... the most MOIST cake you will put in your mouth & just thinking about it make me drool!

Our server Leeann was the absolute best and happily assisted my husband, since I abdicated complete menu selection to him. (There were simply too many good choices and I was not up to decision making!). 

She was so very friendly and helpful that I knew we would have fun, but the whole evening was one of the nicest nights out we have ever had. Eddie who was assisting Leeann was also personable and it seems like he company treats staff well, since many of them have been there for years. The diamond studded crab on Eddie's jacket marked ten years of great service. We even asked to speak to the general manager, Danny who was also very pleasant and took time to listen to our rave reviews.  Hats of to this place for excellent staff!

Now, about the food...DELICIOUS.  Started with a prosciutto and melon appetizer. It was a variety of four melons, my favorite of which was the Santa Claus melon, with thinly sliced prosciutto. There were also a variety of olives (no pits!) drizzled with some EVOO and red pepper flakes.

Next came the Stone Crab and Kings Crab plates.  Ungodly good. I loved that they were perfectly prepared but the way they serve them means you can still be dressed up and not have to worry about making a mess.   The crab was sweet and delicious.

Final dish was a New York strip served with a side of fried green tomatoes. Although I was close to full, the fact that we shared everything made it okay to have some of each.  Steak came out perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rare and was seasoned just right. Fried tomatoes were awesome and barely needed a dip in the dressing. 

A last surprise was a birthday treat, a warm gluten free brownie topped with vanilla ice cream. Leeann told me it was mandatory that you have at least a bite for birthday luck, so I had to taste it for her.  Never had anything gluten free taste that good.

If you are in Vegas, I highly recommend this place. Even though I would suggest asking for Leann and Eddie, I have a sneaking suspicion that given what I learned about the restaurant, other staff might be okay too!

It had great flavour and it was loaded with veggies and clams.  Now for my entree, I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon.  It might have been the worst steak I've had in a restaurant of this caliber.  The outside of the steak was completed charred and tough.  And I ordered it Medium Well, which usually means mostly pink, but not red.  However, this steak was very ""well done"".  I wanted to send it back and had I been the one paying for the meal, I would have.  However, I did not want to cause an issue, or embarrass the person paying the check.  So, I just asked for some Sauce Bernaise.  At least that made the steak bearable.  One of the others in my party had a Grilled Seafood Platter, which looked incredible and he said it was.  I'll be getting that the next time I go.  My sister had the Halibut, and it was beautiful and she enjoyed that.  For dessert, I split the Boston Creme Pie with someone else in my party.  It was incredible.  It is so hard to find these days, and I don't know why?!  It's such a great desert.  My sister had the Pumpkin Chiffon, which also was great.  So, if you're going to go here (and I recommend it), stick with the seafood and stay away from the beef.",gmYU_SLgpWgafgSejWdzTg,0,0,3,uR-R9t_gLwhnLwQ0JpIeoA

First night, we had just returned from getting married and taking a helicopter tour of the Strip and were starving! We shared the Whale, some fried green tomatoes, and the broccolini, I had a watermelon margarita and he had a beer. Everything was amazing right down to the bread basket. We finished with the key lime pie, which was rich enough that we couldn't finish it between the two of us.

Second night: My husband had the steak Oscar, I had the grilled seafood platter, we split some grilled tomatoes, he had another beer and I tried the mojito (which was delicious). Again, everything was perfectly done, timely, and well presented. 

Tip: Although I indulged in some seafood I did note that they have a vegan/veggie menu with several tasty looking options!",Rb4QUZN6QC92d_-nm5wlBw,2,0,5,O4DeiYZtmD7vwfv8RDSJWw
3278955,2014-03-26,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Decent service but good seafood and meat to satisfy your needs. Make reservations so you don't have to wait long to get seated. I made reservations and though I was about 10 mins late, we were still seated right away. Be sure to use the Valet Parking where the Forum shop is near Las Vegas Blvd. Easier to navigate right to Joe's. 

First came the free bread. None are the same and you get 5 different types to try. In my opinion, all were great. The one with sesame I liked the most. We started with a half dozen order of oysters and though the oysters were good, I've had better. We then ordered 7 Stone Crab claws to split with my wife. Great part about this is that they come cracked already and I definitely recommend getting it. Great tasting and fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  For the main, I got their Bone-In Filet Mignon. Priced around $55, this is definitely worth it. Nice huge sized filet mignon that's cooked perfectly and they give you additional steak seasoning on the side if you need it. Bad thing is that the $55 doesn't come with any sides which I don't think any of those do. You will have to order their sides separately. Good thing is that it's a large portion so it isn't too bad if you're sharing. I recommend ordering the mashed potatoes. One of the best I've had and yet it was so good and great serving, we couldn't finish it. Place is a bit expensive but it's worth the price. Service could be a bit better but wasn't too bad. Just that we waited for about 20-30 mins before our main dishes came out. I would probably come back again and try something else on their menu but can't go wrong with the bone-in filet mignon, stone crab claws and mash potato.",2j4FDQFkjGwjCREtUSJfsQ,1,1,4,N1bHJ74ZKbVMJY3eQJapZw

3288671,2016-09-16,11,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Two visits, ten years apart and 5 stars for both visits. Joe's is my favorite Vegas restaurant and for good reason. They offer some of the best and freshest seafood around and they offer one of the best seafood items in Stone Crab Claws. The restaurant became famous from their original location in Florida and has since branched off with locations in DC, Vegas and Chicago. Joe's in Vegas is an absolute must visit for their amazing food, their amazing service and their great ambiance. Unfortunately, with all three being an integral part of the success of the restaurant, the prices are on the high side but completely worth the splurge.

The food:

Stone Crab Claws- These are the reason you visit and they are exceptional. The claws are cracked three times making them easy to eat and they have a nice sweet flavor with a really nice meaty texture. The Joe's Mustard Sauce, which is basically a Remoulade sauce, makes the perfect pairing to the crab. Remoulude is kinda like a spicy mayo with herbs, Remoulade is my favorite sauce and it is magic with the crab. They offer three different sizes for the claws and I tried the Select and Large. There is a pretty big difference in price but I did like the Large the best. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=svdUJuyjnV2Th5mT9ocCfg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Colossal Lump Crab Cakes- I love crab cakes and these were perfect. I say this is either one or two for the best crab cakes I ever had with the other being Faidley's out in Baltimore, Maryland. The crab cakes were so perfectly moist with very little filling with a very nice outer crust. The bread crumb had a great texture with a slight crunch and the Remoulade went perfectly, but honestly, I don't even know if it was even necessary since the crab cakes were so perfect, as is. This crab cake had so much crab in it, it was heaven. This is a must get. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=42v3Dc8Wnocfe98Vso1Aug&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Half Dozen Kumamoto from Humboldt Bay, California- These were great, they had so much flavor and were so perfectly creamy and delicious. I didn't think I would ever say this since Kumamtos are my fav oyster but the previous two items almost made the oysters irrelevant, even though they were great. The above two items were just that magical. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9RdQSoZ4MulGnoaJp-ryOg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Key Lime Pie- Their famous dessert is their Key Lime Pie and it was excellent. I really loved the smooth texture and great mouth feel, I typically love crunchier crust so the one here was perfect for me. The filling had a good subtle tart flavor but I was expecting it to be a tad more tarty. The one thing that did surprise me was how god damn cold the pie came out, it was basically brain blacking out cold. lol https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rmUq6Fk1nhjF2zx7H4YyFw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA",Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA,18,11,5,Sn8U1BiMfwGCpFxkscMGjA
3290905,2010-08-10,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Ah.. Joe's.  I think this is home to perhaps the best meal I have ever had in Las Vegas.. second to Nobu.  

I try to visit every time I am in Vegas.  Their service has always been great and the restaurant is a little brighter (ie less romatic) so it's great for casual dining.  They also have a seating area that extends out the front into the forum shops so you can people watch if you want.

Crab claws are basically what they are known for but what makes me want to go back is the beef.  I always get a NY strip and it's always done to perfection.  Sides are great and perfect for sharing.  French fried sweets, roasted sweet corn, asparagus, it's all very tasty.  

Their banana cream pie is also a winner.  

The thing that sets this place above others though is the seasoning mix they give you to put on your steak.  It is quite simply the perfect blend of seasonings that bring out the flavor of your steak.

The stone crab is incredible! We ordered 4 large for two people and they were fresh! The sauce on the side is really good on the crab meat.  But they are good on their own as well.  All of our dishes were extraordinary. The seafood is fresh and the prime steaks are delectable. 

For appetizers we had Shrimp De Jonghe (Extra large shrimp roasted in seasonings) , Fried fisherman's platter (enough for 2 but too much for one) and Caesar's Salad. Dinner was even better.

If you drive to Caesar's Palace there is valet parking right at the front door of Joe's from the new Forum Shop entrance. If you are taking a cab, tell the driver to drop you off there or you will walk a long way from the Forum Shop entrance by the casino.

Located at the end of the newer wing of the Forum Shops it still had the feel of being within a mall, so dining alfresco really meant that you have a great view of the escalators.  Well, to our surprise, it was a tuxedo waitered affair with full linen service...

With our expectations in check, we were initially led to a table between the doors leading to the patio by a slightly stoic maitre 'd that we failed to impress.  That said we told him that we preferred a larger, more centered 4-top that was available, and so we were seated without a problem.  In retrospect, he may have thought that the tiny two-top was a more intimate seating, but no way, not between the doorway and it certainly would have been a problem with all the food we would wind up ordering...

I'm down for seafood, prime steak, and Stone Crab just like the man says;  but they weren't highlighting their signature Stone Crabs with their distinctive black tipped claws saying that they're not quite in season and frozen at the time of our visit.  Bummer.

One of the better crab cakes that we've had, it was meaty and succulent interior belittling it's perfectly crisp scone-like battered exterior (more on this later) prompting my wife to declare that this was the best crab cake she tasted, as good as Old Ebbitt's in DC.  The Caesar Salad (of course) was tossed and divided for us without even having to ask, the freshly grated Parmesan was good quality and had that slightly salty flavor...

Here at Joe's they have a set of signature Bone-In cuts and I was tempted for a moment to order the Filet Mignon with the bone because I've never really heard of such a thing, but for my first try I wanted to have a basis for comparison to others the tried and true bone-in ribeye cut.  The 20oz Bone-In Rib Eye is flown in just like everything else in LV from somewhere in the midwest, it was prepared perfectly with a good even outer sear http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#MYSVBsRccwc5b83vREBdkA.  Delicious and savory with much of it flavor from the extra marbling, it rivaled steaks at other places that sometimes cost more.

Although we didn't notice it much at the time since we were enjoying the salad, our crab cake appetizer was actually served after the salad because the kitchen burnt the first one and insisted on making another one before it came out resulting in an out of order but otherwise unnoticed delay.  Because of their faux pas, they decided to comp us two slices from their famous pie only dessert menu:  the Banana Cream Pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#z4g_Kdhogn6XqcjtyLEGXA and their signature Key Lime Pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#ZEw71UqTC2Y7ELYfUQYdQA.  I favored the former for its sweetness over the later's tartness, but both were fabulously fresh tasting...

The service was exemplary,  our waiter was chatty but delightful to converse with.  The food preparation was excellent and I appreciated that they felt that something was not good enough to be served without waiting for the customer to complain before doing something about it.

We shared an order of stone crab claws and these were easily the highlight of our dining experience. The meat was flavorful and succulent. The accompanying mustard sauce was also superb, not that you need it when eating such fine crab meat.

Started with Stone Crab claws (for those unaware, they're served COLD). Succulent and sweet, fun to crack & get the meat. Loved the accompanying sauce (mayo/ horseradish). Didn't know they remove the claws from the crabs and throw them back in the sea, where the crabs live to grow another set of claws. So no crabs were killed in the making of your appetizer!
Staff were excellent. Our server, Raul, did an outstanding job. Between courses, they come by and squeeze fresh lemon on your hands and give you a hot hand towel.

3327169,2012-02-10,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews Joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise). 

ambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. 
the wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. 

the food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the filet mignon i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from the shell before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place the shell on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the filet mignon and King Crab Legs. we were ""sold"" that they were HUGE legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.
given that i have had true alaskan king crab legs before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?

as we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, stone crabs, filet mignon with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.",PnBwDitaPUodtlSpN3ELJw,0,0,2,hTjFmJ50wACZ4AlBzHG7rQ

Start your meal with their stone crab claws. They're the best. Melt in your mouth, butter texture with great flavor. The sauce they serve it with is also excellent.

Now entrees. Chilean Sea Bass with a miso glaze. SO GOOD. Cooked perfectly to the point where the sauce caramelizes on the fish. Fish texture is great as well.

Dry aged bone-in rib-eye. Pretty bomb piece of steak. I'd say it is my second favorite next to Nick and Stef's. Comes with a dry seasoning composed of salt, pepper, garlic, and corriander. 

Filet Mignon. I'd stay away from this one. Wasn't that great in my opinion.

FINISH YOUR MEAL with the Boston Cream Pie. It is SO GOOD. Take my word for it, the main reason I came back was not the crab claws... it was this slice of heaven. Try it. Love it. Thank me. You're welcome.",vXvsRujK6L8K_aozSVmt_g,2,1,5,o5mWDBnrAFpqfb1vYPeNWw

They have a back room for that fine dining experience in the Forum and the outside and bar area for a more casual fling. 

I usually don't go to the high scale restaurants on the strip, but I happened to have a discount and decided to splurge. I went with a few other people and we decided to basically taste the entire menu, - drinks to dessert. 

Our total meal left us filled to the brim. Everything was great, while some dishes were simply outstanding. We began with calamari, oysters, tartare and some bread. The oysters came with some type of crystal horseradish that was simply delicious. The tartare was perfect. We then had a few salads to cross the bridge to dinner. Dinner handed us stone crab, king crab, and steak. I had never had stone crab and was actually a little disappointed in the flavor, but no doubt it was perfectly prepared. The king crab was just outstanding and the best tasting crab legs I have ever had. The steak was fantastic but I'd still go with seafood first and foremost. Finally to dessert. I don't usually venture to the dessert menu but when splurging might as well open up the belt bucket. The key lime pie, their flagship, was great. Get it - doesn't matter if you like key lime pie or not. And try one of their dessert mix drinks as well. 

Overall one of the best meals I have ever had, not just in Vegas. Perfect food, perfect staff, and pretty secluded at the bottom of the shops so you can people watch but not be thrown into the life of the Forum Shoppes like other restaurants in Caesar's. The bill will be expensive but for a nice meal you can't go wrong with Joe's.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,5,TGGWqg8jnMP0W7xGejZkPw

To start off, it's fancy. Don't show up in random clothes. The staff is formal, proper, polite, and extremely informative. They all know what they're talking about and help in every way. I would recommend this place to everyone, however, it's not cheap. You definitely pay for what you get! A good meal, at a good spot, with some great company. Make a reservation, save some time since they can get swamped with people. I ate here on my birthday and they even threw in some dessert no charge!

At this place, I've had many things but only listing what I can remember:

Bread: They serve bread once you sit. DON'T over-stuff yourself with it. I know it's beyond yummy but save your appetite, it gets better!

New England Clam Chowder: I'm not a fan of seafood whatsoever but I don't think this was bad. My bf loves this and orders it all the time. It's a nice portion and fulfilling. 

Caesar Salad: By far one of the best salads I've had. They split it to share if you ask and it's extremely light. The dressing isn't over-powering which I love, and they never drench it either. 

Crab Claws: Personally, I don't like them but that's only cause I don't like seafood too much. Once again, my bf LOVES them. They come with lemon to add onto them and bring you everything you need to eat them. I love how they bring out hot towels once you're done to clean your hands with. Big plus!

Filet Mignon: Ordered a Medium piece of meat. Wow! SOO good and they cooked it just the way I like it. It wasn't dry at all, very similar to Medium rare, without all the blood oozing out.

Mashed Potatoes: OMG! This is to die for! I ordered a half order, the portion is quite large with the rest of my meal. They layer them with cheese which gives it a little extra umph!

Parmesan Crusted Halibut: WIN! I LOVE this dish, everyone should try it. The crisp in each bite is to die for. My favorite thing to get!

I never know the name, but ladies, if you want some alcohol without it being overpowering and overwhelming, try ordering one of their special martini drinks. I always tell the server that I want their ""special peach martini..but I can't think of the name"" and they ALWAYS know what I'm talking about. The rim is covered in sugar and it is beyond refreshing and tasty. You can't even tell there's alcohol in there... based on the taste! I always get two when I eat here!

So when I found a stone crab restaurant I was excited to finally get to try it. I had passed this restaurant while in the Caesars Palace. It's not in the actual hotel, but in the adjacent terrace building, so it might be a little hard to find. I made a reservation because in passing I noticed it was a little crowded. Our waiter was friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards. I ordered the Select 6 Florida Stone Crab claws, a side of sautéed garlic spinach, and roasted asparagus. There were a lot of extra dishes on the table, and after ordering the waiter decided he was going to reach over me and remove them.... Bad idea!!! The poor guy knocked over my water all over the table... And not so importantly, all over me :( luckily it was just water, and I'm in Vegas having am awesome time, so no biggie!!! Our food came out, and it was pretty amazing. My boyfriend had half a slice of their signature  key lime pie and half a slice cheesecake and his face led me to believe it was nothing short of amazing. My only complaint about this restaurant is that it was filled with tables of rich douchebags who were being extremely rude to the waiters and busboys...

And the food was simple in presentation and solid in quality. Really enjoyed the pretzel bread, their bisque is spot on, steak is cooked well, king crab is fresh...but the highlight is their Havana Creme cake which is similar to. Tres Leches.
Our exceptional waiter - Raul - steered me towards that dessert but I only asked for a half slice. To my surprise this was the best creme cake I have ever had bar none. It was quickly demolished by the table so I had to ask for another half slice for myself to enjoy. Raul saw that I enjoyed it so much that he gave me a slice on the house.

Such a great portion, that I felt full.  

Main entree was the 7 medium stone crab claws served with mustard sauce.  I requested for a side of butter.  Crab was served cold.  Claws were a good size.  The portions were more than enough.

For about $27 bucks you can either choose filet mignon or alaskan king crab, two full size sides and dessert.

Portions are pretty big. I think two people can share one order. We ordered two and wasted a lot of food. The bread basket they give you is really good so you will fill up on that as well.

Stone crab just taste like crab but the claws have a lot more meat. And the shell is really hard, hence the name, I guess. They don't have the sweetness that the dungeness crab has so I do miss that.

They do run out of stone crab so go early and order early. The table that sat next to us came later and when they were ready to order, they already sold the last order.",ItuJ3KfxtoPUVW1XNtk-9A,4,2,4,5M4HbnawjCz8gdPuRaUHbw

The service was okay, if that. I always try to keep in mind that it may have been a busy night, but it doesn't excuse the total lack of service we received. Our waiter barely came by our table. Maybe because we're younger and they assumed we would not tip. Who knows.

The starter salad was mediocre but the bread was delicious. The steak was fantastic along with the brussell sprouts and mac and cheese. We tried the stone crab and I personally did not like it. It tasted too fishy to me and the cold turned me off. The dipping sauce on the side was good so thankfully we had that. 

All in all, it was decent. For the amount of money I don't think it was worth it. I can't say that I will be back, but I wouldn't turn people away from it.

3386838,2014-12-31,8,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Looking for eating options in Vegas and I can not tell you how STOKED I was to see this pop up on my yelp feed.  I tried Joe's Stone Crab in Miami, Florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  This is their sister restaurant.  AND NOW I HAVE ONE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE US! Ok, it's not quite in LA...but it's doable.  It's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the Caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  Made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.  

Service was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  The staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  And the food came out QUICK! I love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.

Now on to the food:
BREAD: You get an assortment of bread.  Our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  Load up on the carbs (:

HOT CHOCOLATE: It was so delicious.  None of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  Really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  YUM!

CRAB BISQUE: The size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  I love their presentation.  You're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  I don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. Flavor is nothing short of what I expected.

MEDIUM STONE CRAB: Our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  You still have to take off the shell of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  A MUST ORDER while eating here.

JUMBO ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS: Ugh this was amazing! Another MUST ORDER!! The meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. Dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. Too good!!

COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE:  This was the only dish that we ordered that I could have lived without.  It was good, but I just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.

ALASKAN KING CRAB ROLL:  I will totally order this again.  It's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  They stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).

SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD:  This is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  This salad comes with the Alaskan Crab, Lobster, and Shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  It's so good. Like wow good. Wow.

WILD MUSHROOM MAC & CHEESE:  It is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  One side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.

KEY LIME PIE: THE ONLY key lime pie I've ever liked was at the Joe's in Miami. And they serve it just as good here. It's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). Just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!

I can't rave about this place enough. One of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here. 

SIDENOTE: You can order from their dinner menu for lunch if you're interested! (:",GUCac_iRt07wvgwCt9Y3Fw,14,10,5,65Y1F43t3JoY2R6-6b6yvg

I ordered the rib eye, and asked for it medium rare. Out of all the cuts of steak we all received, mine looked the shadiest and it was overcooked. However, the server did her best to accommodate me. I got a new steak. While this one was cooked better, it still was noy evenly cooked. For a rib eye, this cut was more lean. While that's not a bad thing for those who would enjoy a sirloin, I ordered a rib eye and expected it to be more marbled and tender. The sides also left much to be desired.

This most recent visit at Caesars did not live up to this establishment's reputation for one reason and one reason alone: the stone crab claws were sub-par mostly because these bad boys are not in season and what was served was probably of the frozen variety which just does not live up to the billing. I would have expected the server to at least have reminded us that this was an off season item so I could take that into account in selecting my entree.

The free bread basket is artfully arranged and comes with 5 varieties of rolls and bread. My favorite was a thick, chewy pretzel stick....when I asked for another one our server brought us 3 more which I totally appreciated.

 It was about 100 degrees outside, and I was chugging water like a parched camel. They were wonderful about refilling our glasses quickly, and they brought me a little bowl of lemons to put in it. 

Although the bottle wine list is extensive, I  was the lone drinker at my table so a bottle was out of the question; I wish they had a few more options for single glasses. The Pinot Gris I tried was fairly good and paired nicely with my food, but it was the only option for Pinot Gris.I am not a huge fan of Chardonnay so I would have liked a few more options of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, etc.

The food was amazing though, which is why it still gets 5 stars. Craig is an unfortunately picky eater, but he absolutely gobbled up his steak sandwich. It came out beautifully grilled, and the fries were crispy and perfect. I ordered the seafood salad, and was impressed by the presentation and flavor. It had perfectly cooked juicy scallops, shrimp, and shreds of Alaskan King Crab on it, and the amount of dressing on it was just right and not overpowering.

3406967,2007-06-18,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"HORRIBLE FROZEN STONE CRAB. The main reason why people come to Joe's is the stone crab which is phenomenal when super fresh. When I got my order of stone crab claws last week, they were horrible and not fresh.

Basically it was a plate of 5 stone crab claws that had been frozen and thawed. They were still rather cold, there was no seasoning or special preparation except for a side of their mustard dip, and it purely sucked. SO FREAKIN DISAPPOINTING. Joe's should know better than to offer stone crab when the stone crab is out of season and serve it thawed from the freezer and still charge so much. 0 STARS FOR THE FROZEN STONE CRAB. There's a reason why Joe's Stone Crab in Miami used to shut down for months when stone crab was not in season. I believe the waiter should have at least warned us how much they suck frozen.

Luckily, the rest of the food was decent - the salad with seafood was good and had nice portion of shrimps, crab, and other seafood. However, I would have preferred the dressing to be less creamy and for it to be a lighter salad. The cole slaw was average. The key lime pie was pretty good but not as good the stuff you get from Joe's Miami.

Service was attentive and professional.

Bottom line: Thawed frozen stone crab claws = YUCK. Wait until stone crab is back in season. Rest of the food is decent with good service but there are better seafood places.",6mMk9hO_RAbdGMEGeg3oWQ,2,0,2,pR8zGHYzb7LCxtlfBNHfaA

They break one claw off and throw the rest of the crab back to regrow the claw so the harvesting is sustainable. They don't server other parts of the stone crab. The claws are very meaty compared to other species wiht a delicate sweetness unique and different from snow and dungeness. Stone crab claws paired with a Sancerre was a mind blowing experience. The flavors are different when chewing the crab with some Sancerre in the mouth at the same time. Changes the flavor of the crab. Excellent pairing. Without the wine pairing I wouldn't have enjoyed the crab. Cold crab claws with mayo based sauce wasn't that appealing to my palate. I echo what other reviews say about this. 

Signature Item: Sole with browned butter. Reminds me of the burned butter taste in creme brûlée without the sugary sweetness. Excellent sauce. Unique on fish. Never had it before Fantastic presentation. They have one person specially trained to debone the whole fish in front of you.  The server counts the bones to make sure they don't leave anything behind. Never seen this before.  I thought the sole was too salty. Couldn't eat it after a couple bites. 

Signature Item: Key lime pie: very memorable. Ordered from the waiter's suggestion. The serve it ice cold so it doesn't melt. Almost like a custard or panne cotta in texture signature item.

I also had a glass of Moscato which was smooth and sweet and very light just as I asked. (Additional notes on the food.... The sides typically come family-style, the grilled shrimp are huge, and the steak is especially tender!) 

Over all the experience was great. This is definitely a fine dining restaurant so have your wallet handy. Other than that.... enjoy because the food is quite tasty!!!",dgVJzkjTHapHRloRKYv4bA,1,1,4,Tv1CcqD67_Bz9YJadLgMuw

It was still fairly early at noon for lunch, which I'm sure half the town isn't even awake yet. We didn't have reservations, but there were plenty of tables available. The service was great, our server was fun, personable, attentive and sweet. We asked a bunch of questions about the Stone Crabs, since I've never heard of them. And they were really good at explaining what they were, how they were prepared and even brought out all the different crabs and sizes for us to pick the right order. 

We tried the stone crab, medium size with 7 claws to an order at $39.

The stone crabs were delicious. Already cracked, easy to peel and dipped in a tangy creamy horseradish sauce. Also from reading the menu, they explained a bit about the crab claws, how they are harvested and then released back in the wild, and apparently the claws grow back. I had no idea. 

We also tried an order of Rockefeller Oysters, which were also very good.

Along with the fish, we had a small side order of wild mushroom mac n cheese. It was very creamy, but just a tad bland for my taste.

I am too easily handing out 5-star reviews lately, but I really like what I really like. Joe's simply delivered last night and definitely deserves all 5 available stars.

A classy looking place which replicates an old 20's-era steakhouse in the Forum Shop area of Caesar's. Classic large bar with a great selection of fine spirits. My Oxley gin martini was a great way to start. Paired with Kumamoto oysters, this is the way to start a meal! Besides the usual accompaniments, Joe's served a semi-frozen version of mignonette that is unique and tasty.

The grilled octopus appetizer was tremendous. Hot seafood on cold beans and greens was simply delicious.  My wife went for a classic Manhattan cocktail and we also split a small cup of Manhattan clam chowder. While we both prefer New England clam chowder, this was quite good.

Main dishes were next and I was not disappointed that I strayed from my usual steak craving and opted for the Chilean sea bass. A sweet teriyaki glaze was perfect in bringing out the flavor. My bride opted for the small filet and huge lobster tail. Another martini and a glass of excellent Cabernet helped wash down the delightful dishes. We split a classic baked potato and steamed asparagus. All were excellent. Their famous key lime pie finished off the evening perfectly.

Service from Perry and the entire staff was on point all evening. The price point was on par with excellent dining options in the area but certainly not outrageous. A perfectly wonderful dining experience.",OHVhLKw_uIE7saIt_S-udw,4,4,5,fKKew09Mieu8-VTQHKDvzA

Fantastic ambiance, my man told the staff it was my birthday and  the 2 of us got seated at a huge banquet with a view of it all.  The waiter was fantastic until about 1/2 way through when he forgot about us totally.  Even the couple next to us got fed up waiting for him and demanded their check from someone else, stood up in the dining room and waited for it, announcing their frustration.  That's the reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 because the food was really wonderful.  I had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Chopped Seafood salad with Alaskan King Crab, Lobster and Shrimp.  Really generous seafood on the really yummy salad.  My man had the 16 oz ribeye which was cooked to perfection, he loved it.  The Key Lime Pie, top notch, maybe the best I've ever had outside of Miami.  

Disappointment, no mention of happy birthday from our waiter, and no desert or anything special besides the good seating.

First, he remembers people really well, even names, and always has a smile and some funny banter.

The bone in ribeye is outstanding and the Stone Claws are infamous with their mustard sauce.  I've also would rank the Black Cod as some of the best fish I've had in a long long time.

It's curious but the bar food here is just as outstanding as the dinner menu.  The burgers and appetizers never disappoint while the service here is outstanding.  This place is always packed but it is not difficult to eat here off dinner hours say 5pm or 8pm.

Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this place as it's reputation precedes itself.  Top notch food, wine, and service with valet right outside the restaurant.  Do not be put off by all the tuxedo waiters as this is in Vegas so jeans and a T-Shirt will get you in but you will feel a bit under dressed with mink coats and suits surrounding you.

Worth the money you'll spend and opt for the Large or Special Stone Crab Claws even if they do run you $55 for 4 of them.  Huge amount of meat on them vs the medium size claws.

As you pass all the shops in the Forum Mall, keep moving -- you don't need an Armani suit or a Breitling or whatever boxing memorabilia Mike Tyson is presently autographing in Field Of Dreams (plus, you don't give cash to rapists).  

Keep moving past a variety of pretty good restaurants, and just before you reach the doors leading out to The Strip, head down the curved escalator  In the basement of the Forum, you'll find Joe's.

I try to make a stop at Joe's during every Vegas trip, big winning or no.  Often times it's my last stop out of town.

A plate of Stone Crab here, naturally, is a wonderful thing.  I like to start of with 6 of the Select ones.  They come with a dijon mustard sauce, which is great, but drawn butter is available.  

I like to follow up the crab with a steak, usually a filet, medium rare.  While I recommend going during lunch for a guaranteed, immediate seat, I don't recommend the petite steaks served as lunch specials; get one of the thick, real cuts from the dinner menu.  I once shared an amazing porterhouse done black & blue style (blackened and pepper crusted on the outside, so rare almost blue on the inside). 

Crab and steak, that's enough to make me happy, but it's easy to get distracted by the sides here.  They're a la carte, and they can be addictively delicious, like the grilled tomatoes topped with spinach and cheese and the baked mashed potatoes.    

There's a variety of wine-by-the-glass available.  On my last visit, I had an excellent glass of Frog's Leap Merlot, which was soon followed by another.

Both the table and bar staff are attentive, extremely knowledgeable, and dressed impeccably.

There are at least 3 dining areas here -- ""outside"" in the mall, by the bar, and inside in the back.  But for lunch of solo dining, the bar is an excellent option.

I really enjoyed our evening at Joe's. I had never had stone crabs, and the claws we ordered were good, and the dipping sauce was completely addictive.

I ordered the salmon au poivre, and it was truly lovely. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the fennel and radish salad was refreshing and the perfect complement to the salmon. Other dishes at our table included two filets (perfectly cooked and seasoned) and one liver-and-onions. There's not a lot to be done about the texture, but the flavor of the liver and sauce was nice.

We decided on the pan roasted sweet corn, cole slaw, and celery root au gratin for the side dishes. The best part of the corn was all the smokey flavor of grilled corn without all the crap that gets caught in your teeth. The cole slaw is bright and vinegary, something I appreciated since I don't love mayo. The au gratin was a nice change from potato.

We concluded our meal with a slice of the signature key lime pie, which had one of the best graham cracker crusts I've ever had. 

It was a nice meal, and everything was satisfying, so why three stars? Overall, it was a delicious meal, but a few things stuck out. For one, the crabs were great, but I'm not sure I felt like they were worth the $60. The au gratin was definitely under-seasoned, and I suspect that the pie was previously frozen because it certainly seemed frosty in the middle. Our server was nice, but he seemed to be reading from a script at times, and I was a little frustrated in his answers at points.

3515720,2012-08-08,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"What an exceptional Restaurant!    I surprise my wife and take her out on a Saturday night.  Unfortunately it was the same weekend that the Billboard awards were in town and there was over a 2 hour wait.  Thomas, the Maitre D', humbly apologized, but there was no way to get us in sooner.  I explained to him that it was our first date night in a long time.  I surprised my wife with a sitter, we recently saw the Stone Crabs on T.V. and really craved it etc...He asked us to wait by the bar and he would see what he could do.  We figured we could see some industry people so we went to the bar and waited.  I think I see Carley Rae Jepsen here.  Darn, I have that song now in my head... ""Hey I just met you, call me crazy, so here's my number, so call me maybe...""  20mins later, Thomas comes by and says he could seat us and thanked us for the wait.  He knows how it was to get out on a date night and wanted to accommodate us.

From the start, we were given the VIP treatment.  As our server, Ashley, was placing the napkins on our lap, she noticed I had dark pants.  I usually request a dark napkin, but she immediately said ""I'll go and get you a dark napkin"" without hesitation.  Knowing and predicting my needs before requesting, sign of great customer service.  Another mark of an exceptional restaurant is that they left my wife and I alone most of the time.  This gave us the opportunity to talk and spend time together without interruption.  This is not to say they were not attentive.  They were more than attentive, but they did it in the background.   They worked as a team.  The person filling our water, the person bringing our bread, the person clearing out table, everyone was exceptional.  They knew exactly what was needed at our table and would rarely need to ask.  I would look down and have a fresh glass of ice tea.  Working as  team to help each other to make sure the client experience was exceptional.

Obviously we were there for the Stone Crab Claws, but Ashley made a suggestion of their signature table side Cole Slaw.  Cole Slaw?  She said we would not regret it and she would make it personally.  The Stone Crab was obviously amazing.  Sweet, succulent and delectable, with a hint of tang and heat on the back of the palate from their homemade mustard sauce.   When I die, I want heaven to be made of marshmallows, rainbows and Stone Crab Claws from Joe's!  And she was right, I absolutely loved the table side Cole Slaw. 

When the meal was finally over, Ashley comes over to the table and brings over 2 bowls with a hot towel and lemon in each bowl.  She squeezes the lemon on our hands for us and we proceed to clean our hands with the towels.  This was going above and beyond on the service.  As we were done with our dinner and leaving, Thomas asked ""Mr. & Mrs. Chan, where you happy with your experience here tonight?""  I explained how it was one of the most exceptional times at a restaurant I've had and would be telling everyone about it.  He handed me his card and thanked us for joining them that night.

And, of course, their specialty... stone crabs. We got an order of stone crabs to start. They're cracked before coming to the table, which makes it easy to dig in and eat. There wasn't a ton of meat, but the meat that was there was tender and succulent. Just don't expect it to be as sweet as king crabs or snow crabs.

I dove into the RW menu after that starting with a bowl of stone lobster bisque with plenty of flavor and a slight kick. The tiny bits of celery added a variation in texture that was refreshing. It came in a large bowl that would have been good enough to share. 

The 8oz filet was lightly seasoned, very tender, and slightly undercooked. The quality of the prime beef was evident, but it lacked the finishing touches that would have made it exceptional.

Sides of ""Jennie's mashed potatoes"" and steamed asparagus were brought for the table. The cheesy and chunky potatoes were a nice variation of the classic side and the breadcrumbs on top were an added bonus. The asparagus were standard. Nothing special, but I guess you have to have some green on your plate, right?

For dessert, I went with Joe's signature key lime pie. I love key lime pies in any form, so this one satisfied my craving. It was far from perfect, though. Too tart and a thick and uneven crust... maybe Joe should take hi name off of this dessert. I also tried my wife's dessert -- the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge.

After all the great food (Four Seasons room service and catering, Sonic) I wasn't sure what we were going to do.  The Girl had to make a return to the James Perse store so we made our trek after checkout (amen for having a rental car this time) to the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  It was insanely crowded being Saturday afternoon of Memorial Day weekend so we had to park pretty far.  We had about 2 hours to find something to eat so after much deliberation we decided on Joe's Seafood because it was near James Perse.

The wait was long but when we went up the maitre'd looked at me and said ""You look familiar, have you been here a few times?"".  Of course, me being the honest fellow but not wanting to upset the dood and just wanting to get a leg up on everyone else, I said ""Yes!""

They crack the claws for you so it's on hassle, just be careful not to inhale small pieces.  The bread is good as well and the onion strings are light and crispy and highly seasoned but insanely addictive.  We also shared a ribeye which looks amusing like Salisbury steak on a cafeteria plate but was decent.

Follow it up with the Oysters Rockefeller which is better than Acme Oysters and Drago's that you will find in New Orleans.

We started out with oysters (fresh and delicious, and they have a unique icy mignonette that was neat) and the Select stone crab claws, which were awesome, especially with the mustard dipping sauce. Our server showed us how to extract the meat, and it was super easy because the claws are already cracked. 

The bread basket contained a nice variety and the servers kept bringing out more whenever we ran low.

For our main, we opted for the bone-in dry aged ribeye (one is enough for 2!) from the specials and it was amazing! A perfect medium rare, charred on the outside which imparted a rich, smoky flavor. In comparison, our friends' regular ribeye ($22 cheaper) seemed anemic. 

My favorite of the assortment of sides we tried was the brussels sprouts. The ""big daddy taters"" were good too, although I thought we were ordering the Lyonnaise potatoes (not sure if they're the same thing?). I'd say skip the unremarkable mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.

Make no mistake folks, this is NOT them!

I've probably dined here at least 4 times a month for 3 years straight, mostly tending to  out of town clients coming in for a conference or a little R&R. The location is great simply because it's in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, which is on Flamingo, conveniently located halfway to everything on the strip. Lots of people watching, distractions, shopping, etc, just feet away. Valet is right in front of the restaurant, which is also another plus. Make sure to arrive and exit the back way onto Frank Sinatra drive, behind the casino, otherwise you will face the cluster F*** that is the main 4 way stop into the casino from the strip. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to this 4 way, as it is not optimally shaped, lacks signs or signals, and funnels you right into the main casino valet, taxi line, pedestrian lines, etc. No one really knows what they are in for going through this thing. You will inevitably play chicken with your vehicle. If you have a sick sense of humor,  you might get a kick out of watching the action and riot level tempers erupt up during peak weekend hours in and around this bastard...if you're into that sort of thing...haha..

So the rib eye is pretty spot on and on par with most fare of this caliber on the strip. But the real headliner (literally) is the Stone crab, hence the name of the restaurant... Orders come in 3 sizes, small, medium and large, and I usually order one plate of each size. Believe me it sounds like alot, but it really isn't. You might get 3-4 legs depending on the size of the plate you order. You will devour these things, and when you've just begun to exhale, they will be gone. Everything you love about the sea is well represented....cold, succulent, briny, smooth and slippery textures...wash it down with a nicely chilled grey goose martini and it's either the start or end (depending on the company you keep) of a great evening. And if there is such a thing as ""food porn"" this might qualify as ""food foreplay""..It's tough to put into words how delicious these thing are. I've had clients, after taking them to this place, call me mid day asking me the name of it, just to tell a friend of a friend to go there, so they can be ""that guy"" and reap bragging rights the next day..good food is truly unforgettable.",qmDuC6dwWvtWHFt-xNovag,5,3,5,UvByGDmJM0khhHL8rp9HfA

Quite overrated for what it is, a mall restaurant in an upscale mall. I'm not big into Stone Crab to begin with, but it was OK... They pre cracked them well so that was a plus (not too many shell injuries), but the mustardy-sauce for dipping was bland and tasted like Hellman's Dijonaise. There's not a ton of meat on the stone crab claw, and i personally don't see what all the hype is about. 

Perhaps it stems from the fact that when stone crabs are harvested, they just rip their arm off and throw it back to live on in the sea and re-generate another one in time. I suppose that makes it less cruel (Though I don't agree, sounds like virtual hell to me).

I didn't eat the steak though the fillet looked decent. I got Crab cakes and they were mediocre at best.

Biggest disappointment, when eating a $300 dinner for 3 (with a mediocre 4X markup wine), I don't like sitting at high-rise bar tables, even if they are disguised with a white table cloth and a napkin ring. 

If you need Stone Crab, try Del Frisco's instead! It's not a far cab-ride from Caesars, and the stone crab (which is not their specialty) comes with a WAY better version of the mustard sauce.

June 9th.  I wanted the surf and turf with the bone in filet rather than the petite and king crab legs instead of lobster.  No problem!

The steak (m-r) was tender, tasty and indeed 16oz.  It was not the very best I've had, that distinction is firmly held by Kinzie Chophouse in Chicago.  But this was very, very good. (A-).  The king crab was also great.  Expertly cracked, plentiful and served with drawn butter. (Also an A-).  We had onion strings as a side.  OK, but I recommend something else. (C).

Last dinner in Vegas and it was certainly THE BEST!

Ordered:
x Large Stone Crab Claws - soooo much meat in these things. Everything's already cracked and pretty much ready to eat. Unless you're my date... then you'll need help with getting the meat out in one piece :P The dip it came with was so creamy and delicious. Perfect combination. 
x Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - THE BEST crab cakes I've ever had in my life. SOOOO much flavor and SOOO much meat. Pretty much ZERO filler. Highly recommend for you crab lovers. This was probably my favorite of the night.
x Chopped Seafood Salad - refreshing with lots and lots of fresh seafood. Generous amounts of each ingredient and was the perfect crunch to all the mush we were eating. 

Tried to order the grilled corn, but was told it was out of season :( Will have to come back to try it in the summer!!

We splurged a bit for the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye, and let me just say... this thing is huge! The steak is finished with a beautiful, perfect crust that would surely make any home cook jealous.

The stone crab claws are sweet, succulent, and juicy and come with an amazing mustard sauce. The shells effortlessly fall off the claw since they're pre-cracked. However, I found the medium claws a bit too small for me, so next time I would probably get the larger, more expensive claws for more meatiness.

The key lime pie is another must. This thing is chilled to the point of almost being frozen, with a soft, elastic texture reminiscent of gelato. It's REALLY good, probably my favorite key lime pie ever.

Stone Crabs are  amazing creatures ( they're sustainable as the crab's claws grow back after harvest). If you have not had these large, meaty treats go and treat yourself.

We arrived a bit early for our reservation. We politely told the gentleman at the desk that we were a few minutes early. He barked at us to go to the bar and have a drink. We walked into the bar area but it was heaving with people eating from bar tables. It seems clear that the tables in the bar were set for diners, not people waiting on a dinner reservation just having drinks. The bar stools were all filled. We asked a passing wait staff if it was all right to sit at one of these tables and her response was equally rude: no these are all reserved, go ask the maitre'd. We then asked someone in a suit where we could get a drink and he barked at us, waved his arm dismissively in a general direction and said ""go ask the bartender"". No one was gracious or helpful. Only rude like they didn't care about customer experience. 

Very off-putting first impression. I guess because they are popular and fully booked they feel they can afford to treat customers with disrespect. And this was before we even got seated!  Every staff interaction was rude.

At this point my husband, who is normally a very mild mannered person, was starting to lose it.  I dragged him outside into the shopping mall where we waited. We discussed not going back in. 

We presented ourselves again at the appointed time of our reservation and were quickly seated in a very pleasant corner booth. Our server asked us, perhaps rhetorically, how we were doing this evening and we were honest with him about our earlier experience. 

While the food was pleasant, and plentiful, it was not extraordinary. We weren't concerned with price so much, we knew from previous visits that the place is expensive.  Our server was experienced, knowledgeable and professional. 

A glass of wine that we ordered was corked. We brought this to the server's attention, he sniffed it, and he agreed. But by the time we got his attention, the meal was over. 

At the end of the meal, after the check was presented and the credit card was taken away, the manager approached the table and said he wanted to hear more about our earlier experience. We are polite people but we were candid. He expressed surprise that we were treated this way.

Usually, at this point, in our experience, management would make some gesture of contrition and compensation. But none was offered. This reinforced our belief that Joe's won't try to make it right and doesn't care if a customer walks away with a negative experience.

We had an order of stone crab claws and king crab legs for the table to share. Call me crazy but I didn't see what all the fuss is about the stone crab. In our collective opinion the king crab legs were far more delectable than the stone crab. The stone crab was ok, just not as good as the king crab.

I had the seafood feast grilled (I hate ruining good seafood with breading) which was really good. Upon Laura's recommendation we had the sweet corn and several other sides. The mushrooms and sweet corn were the best sides in my opinion. And just in case you are afraid of the sweet in sweet corn, the corn itself is sweet but it is grilled and seasoned so you get a perfect balance of sweet and savory. Others at the table ordered the rib eye and a filet, both of which looked like perfectly cooked pieces of meat, and both men reported that his steak was among the best he had ever eaten in his life.

Service (4/5): We wanted to grab a nice meal before heading back home. Came across Joes and thought, ""why not"" since we didn't take the time to have a nice sit down meal in Vegas. The place was packed so the only available seating was located at the bar and we were seated immediately there. The service was extremely slow for our table even though other bar tables who sat and ordered after us were served their food first. Personally I didn't even notice but my friend was upset. After the waitress apologized about 3-4 times to me I realized we did wait quite a long time for our food.

Food:
Crab Bisque (4.5): We ordered a cup of the bisque to try. It had good flavor just was slightly too salty. It was served in a small bowl with some kind of veggie medley garnish. 

Wedge Salad (5/5): The wedge salad was as good as they get. It was large enough to share between 2-3 people. The crispy pork belly was a great alternative to regular bacon. The pork belly was cut into cubes so you get thick, squarish pieces. 

Seared Sea Scallops (2/5): It comes with 4 scallops, decent size. It is plated on mashed cauliflower with bacon jam. We were definitely anticipating this dish after ordering it but unfortunately it was a disappointment. The scallops were a little bit overcooked so they were slightly tough. And they were extremely salty. Fortunately, our server took it off our bill. 

Stone Crab (4/5): I would say this was good crab for crab being eaten cold. We ordered the medium size which came with about 7 claws. They were pre cracked and each claw was decent size. It was served with lemon and a side of a mustard like dipping sauce. My friend and I weren't a fan of the sauce.

Okay so now the food. Short and sweet-crab bisque (yum) and great presentation. I had scallops wrapped in bacon. Each bunch of 4 scallops were wrapped in bacon-so delicious.

We had them as an appetizer, but I suggest ordering a full order (we had never had them so we ordered just an appetizer)...if you like crab at all...order a full order...and I would order the medium size-get more meat.

We have been eating at Joe's for years, and it's always been one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas due to the excellent food and service.  My husband proposed to me there in 2010.  We went there last week (on the 4th anniversary of our engagement).  My husband told the maitre'd it was a special occasion, which he ignored and said ""tell your waiter"" (which we did).
We arrived at 7 p.m.   We were rushed to order.  Our food arrived within 5 minutes (we were having cold crab legs and hot sides).  It was faster than McDonalds.  We were never asked if we would like coffee or dessert and the anniversary of our engagement was totally forgotten.  We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m. 30 minutes after sitting down.  There were many empty tables, so the rush was very weird. Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap, either.  Won't be back any time soon",wtXsQCpetAZRkI_NJPOI0Q,4,0,1,BYYlWhmwB55ldAGlboBC_w
3742225,2015-09-18,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I was in Vegas for vacation of course! I took my family here for my mom's birthday. Now I must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater I know. I've taken her out to eat at many places. I was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place I've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! She went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!

We ordered 4 servings of manhattan clam chowder, 1 grilled seafood platter , 1 pound of the smallest stone crab claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. The seafood platter came with scallops, lobster tail, and Madagascar shrimp. WOW, this is the first time I've actually LIKED scallops! They were big and meaty! The stone crab claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! It was like a classier version of the Atlantic blue crab that I am so used to eating on the East Coast. I was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. Just some lemon juice was enough!

What I love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! If they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. Sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want filet mignon or crab cakes, these meals are a great price! I brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz filet mignon and the other mac and cheese. Joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and crab cake and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. Stay away from the $9 meals. The mac and cheese was total crap. Easy mac would have been better!! It was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. My sister couldn't finish it. The steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! Each kids meal also came with a free side. One sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion I paid $9 for if not bigger!! Seriously (look at the picture I posted). The only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. Each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! Needless to say, the sundae was delicious. Seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.

As for the more adult stuff, I don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. Everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. You must get the stone crab claws! I didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! The claw regenerates! Gasp! Do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? Is it the left or right one? I digress. I tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing I can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so I can't say I would recommend the steak over the seafood. Stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, I don't have faith in those dishes. Why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? 

Oh and the complimentary bread was crap. Olive garden probably has better. Again, I don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.

Service was good. Our waitress, Mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. She didn't seem super accommodating, however. My mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. It wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. Usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.

Oh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. My family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. This is touristy Vegas!

In the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. It was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! Yum!",_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA,2,2,5,OSNLxsmm0KF4dK5D7BRC4Q

We went here for a late lunch.  So because I was dining with a group this time, I got to try more food shared by others around the table.  I got to try their Hashed Brown and Fried Asparagus. Both were good and had surprisingly huge portions for side dishes.  I don't have any pics of them unfortunately, but the Hashed Brown was interesting since it was shaped like an armadillo.

The last two visits here had me ordering their Large Size Crab Claws.  This time around I was little more frugal and opted for the Select Size Crab Claws (http://bit.ly/2iy9cdN).  Even though it was just slightly smaller and one more claw than the Large Size, Select Size was still a good portion size.  But there was definitely a lot more labor involved in removing the shells.

One meal from Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab I highly recommend is the Filet Oscar. The Filet Oscar is a Filet Mignon with Alaskan King Crab, Asparagus in a Béarnaise Sauce. It was so flavorful! The combination of steak and crab topped with the creamy béarnaise sauce was savory and delectable. The crab was perfection.

If you go to Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab you MUST try the Stone Crab. All I can say is Holy moly guacamole! The best  crab I have ever had. This dish is a necissity when dining at this restaurant. (Make sure to squeeze a little lemon over it). You will melt over the perfection of Joe's Stone Crab.

Sunday, dinner: sat in the back dining area and loved the atmosphere. I've been to a couple of swank steak places and this one did not disappoint. Lots of wood and dim lighting. The atmosphere and the service were on point. Classy, but not pretentious. 

Apps: I had a shrimp cocktail and my hubby had raw oysters. The shrimp cocktail was great, big fresh prawns and a good bite of horseradish in the cocktail sauce, loved it. My hubby said the oysters were okay, fresh just 2 of the 3 did not work for him. 

Cocktails/wine: I had my standard - a lemon drop martini. Excellent. My husband had a couple of glasses of wine, he can't remember the type, but he liked it well enough to have 2 glasses! 

Bread basket: As fellow yelpers have noted, bread was yummy. Several varieties along with chilled butter. Pretzel bread, extra yum. 

Mains: Stone crab, I ordered the small plate of stone crab claws for my main and hubby ordered the mixed seafood grill. 

The crab claws tasted really good, fresh and sweet meat. But, as someone else noted, it can be difficult to avoid little pieces of shell. They arrived at the table all cracked and ready to be eaten, but seems they can be a little like shelling a hard boiled egg - at times it can be difficult to remove tiny pieces of shell. But, overall, glad to have them. Wanted to try the stone crab claws as it's a speciality for them. 

Mixed seafood grill: Tasted this and can report that the garlic butter seasoning on the seafood was great and it had a nice grilled flavor. Only complaint was that a couple of the smaller shrimp were a little over cooked. 

Solo lunch, Wed around 1pm: no reservations. Although I waited an extended amount to be seated, they were not that busy. The wait staff apologized when he arrived...ok. But, once I was seated, everything was timely. Sat in the front area near the bar and enjoyed that setting as well. 

Had the whale for 1 as an entree. It was my favorite. One big prawn, crab leg, 1/2 a lobster tail and a flavorful shrimp, scallop ceviche. $28 for the market price, still wonderful. Had drawn butter and an lemon drop martini (if it anit broke, don't fix it...) on the side. Oh, my, loved it.

After leaving Joe's the was happy with this choice and that's all I can ask for since it was his birthday and I wanted to make sure it was special. I on the other hand left unsatisfied but it was my own fault because I didn't order what I actually wanted for my entree. We decided to opt out of getting an appetizer because we never finish our entrees and my main plan was to get the stone crab appetizer and scallops as my entree but because we decided on no appetizer I got the medium stone crab as my entree. Every review talks about the stone crab so I figured we couldn't miss out on trying it. They were really good, the meat was sweet but I do recommend only getting them as an appetizer unless you want a cold entree. My boyfriend of course got the filet mignon and lobster and the filet was cooked perfect and as well as the lobster. And luckily he is a generous person and let me take a few bites of his plate since he could tell I wasn't so happy with mine. 
The service was great - once we walked in and gave our names the host right away turned to Cam and wished him a Happy Birthday. We had reservations so we were seated quickly. Drinks were never empty and our table was cleaned before they brought out the birthday cake (that is a huge pet peeve of mine - don't bring out the cake until our table is cleaned off. Nothing like a bunch of dirty empty dishes on the table as we sing happy birthday! Maybe I'm weird but it does bother me.)",Nh03alEHDnzEQwjpCAFk3w,0,0,4,_dJvpKuR2cXKXQx02yxeSQ

My gang decided to come here because we saw pictures and great reviews so we decided this was the place to go for our last night in Vegas. I was really excited about ordering pasta because I was craving it the entire trip. The only choice they have for pasta is the Seafood Pasta for $42.95. Never had I ever ordered pasta that expensive before but because it was my first time in Vegas since I turned 21 and it was the last day, so I said why not? My girlfriends ordered the Seafood pasta but decided to split between them. When the food came, the waiter told my girlfriends that he split the pasta for them and put it on separate plates to make their life easier. He, then, handed my plate and I was in shock. My full order pasta was exactly the same size as their split order. Are you serious?? I am paying $42.95 for pasta that looks exactly the same portion as theirs. My friends were also in shock when the food came and it was the same portion. We wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt by asking if my portion was split in thirds. The waiter said it was not and I have a full meal. I am assuming that he expressed our concerns to the manager because he came by just to see how everything was. The waiter then came to explain what happened to our plates. APPARENTLY, because my meal was a full meal, I received more seafood and LESS pasta while my girlfriends had an equal amount of seafood but MORE pasta. Honestly, I'm unsure if he realized how ridiculous that sounds because wouldn't the chef add more pasta and the same amount of seafood just to make my meal look as if I order a FULL meal?? I literally took like 6 bites (maybe less) of my pasta and I was still hungry afterwards. Taste of the pasta?? It was very weak. It did not have enough sauce and no taste at all. The seafood was terrible and bland. Overall, I spent $56 including tips on a terrible meal that was like 6 bites. I wanted to buy dessert at the restaurant but I was worried their dessert was not proportion LIKE their pasta. I had to go to a bakery to buy dessert. 

Would I go there again? Nope. I rather go to Olive Garden than go back there for pasta or maybe the food court that serves Italian food.",_rOf5lr9LMb5F5V3YlmczA,0,0,2,Ey8MmLJKVH27cLgNm59MYA

The service was excellent from the start. We had a preset menu so ordering was only for the entree and desert.

The Caesar salad dressing was the best I've had. It just made the salad amazing. The string beans amandine were excellent as well. They had a slight buttery taste but not overwhelming and were cooked perfectly.

I got my filet and it was perfectly seasoned & cooked (medium). Absolutely succulent and tender. I think others were so used to not getting a perfectly cooked steak that they ordered a different temperature to make up for it but ended up with exactly what they asked for.

I had assumed the filet was a larger portion but since it was smaller decided to add on lobster tail. I apologized for the last minute change (we had all been served the entrees at this time) and asked if I could add it on. The server came back once to tell me that it would be out shortly. When it finally showed up they apologized even though it was my mistake. That's an A+ for service.

The lobster tail was cooked perfectly. I shared a little with others who were under the same opinion.

Now for desert. I ordered a cappuccino (they use Lavazza) and the apple pie. The server wasn't joking about saving room for desert. The portion was huge. It was possibly one of the best apple pies I've tasted (and I know my apple pies since they're my favorite). Some of the apple slices were slightly under-cooked. These were thinly sliced apples not the larger chunks. But there were only a few like that and the rest made up for it.

Appetizers we had:
Calamari = Excellent, possibly the best I've had, and the table of four I was with was saying the same. Not soft and chewy, and very easy to eat. If you're stuck on what to get but want *something*, this is a good choice.
Crab bisque = first time I had it, and I guess I'm not a fan of it, because my friends thought very highly of it. 
Joe's grilled tomato = Excellent, another great choice for an appetizer. Perry said even as a someone not a fan of tomatoes he really likes it. As a fan of tomatoes myself, I also really like it. 
Petite 8 oz. filet mignon = I got mine medium, and I should have gotten it medium-rare, I think it would have made it better. They'll give you seasoning you can put on the steak which is quite good. Give it a shot. 
Stone crab claws = Friends thought it was good, not great. I didn't think much of it. Very pricey, too, but, it's one of the things they're known for. 
Chilean sea bass = Friend said it was excellent. Pretty sure they inhaled it because I barely remember seeing it on the table. 
The Sundae (not sure what the real name was -- ice cream on top of a brownie) = Very, very good. High quality dessert that we had to celebrate my wife's birthday. 
S'mores pie = Graham cracker crust, chocolate bottom half, roasted marshmallow top-half. This pie was the best pie we've ever had, the chocolate not over-powering or too rich, and the marshmallow does a lot to make this so good. As for me, this was the best part of the meal. It's so good that we're making plans to go to this place again just for the pie, and we were told this is a speciality pie only served in March. A different speciality pie for every month.

Crab bisque is always a good start and the steaks are always cooked on point. I like to have them slice the meat so the table can share some cuts and also try other items on the menu. One of which is their fried chicken!   I think this chicken is one of the best ive had and better than a lot of places that supposedly  ""specialize "" in fried chicken.  I always go with the in season side dishes and if they have it, the grilled corn is a must!

The pies are WHOA! Hands down the best key lime pie and if that is not your style go with the Havana cream. I promise you will not be disappointed.

The pie was so good, OMG, I want to go back for that alone.

I had the potato encrusted fish and my colleague had fish as well (cannot remember what it was). We both commented on how tasteless it was.

So after reviewing Yelp the whole ride there, we finally decided on Joe's and made our reservation. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and were seated immediately. Our waiter brought us waters as we browsed the drink menu along with a bread basket with a variety of breads and OMG the pretzel bread and corn bread was ahhhmazing. I decided to get a Moscow Mule, while hubby decided on a beer, both were refreshing. We picked the shrimp and scallop ceviche for appetizer, and seriously it was so damn good. We typically drench our ceviche in hot sauce, but it wasn't needed as the flavor was amazing and had a little kick to it. The chips you could tell were homemade with a lite dust of chile powder on them.... bomb!!!! For our main course I went with filet mignon which was served with mashed potatoes and a fried basil and cheese tomato. Hubby got the crab stuffed shrimp and we also got roasted corn and Mac and Cheese on the side. My shrimp was delicious as was hubby's shrimp. The corn was seriously so tasty and the other sides were pretty decent. The Mac and Cheese was good, but I'm a huge Mac and Cheese fan and I have to admit I've had better. For dessert we had the Havana Pie and it was literally heaven. It was lite, but yet very scrumptious and the whip cream was served on the side with a lite dust of cinnamon which was super yummyyyy! Over all the service was great, our waiter kept checking on us and wiped the crumbs off of our table each time it was dirty (the bread basket could get a little messy). The food and dessert was superb. We will definitely be dining here again next time we are in town. We might get two orders of the ceviche next time.

When I dine here, I generally get some stone crab and a steak. Yes, the steaks are amazing even though Joe's is more of a seafood restaurant. Don't miss the New York strip!

When selecting your stone crab claws, spend a little more and go with the bigger ones. They are much easier to eat!  They are served cracked, but they do take a little work to get the bits of shell off. 

Ask for Suzanne! She is a fantastic server and a riot! Super friendly and helpful if you aren't sure what to order.

First of all, I asked for a cranberry juice without ice and the drink came with ice.  Then my gf's coke and her sister's coke didn't come for 15 minutes.  What's up with that?

Now on to the food...

We ordered a few sides.  The cream corn was average and had way too many ingredients in it.  The hash browns were bland and over cooked.  We also ordered the green beens amandine which were good.  All of the sides you can order as half sides for $4.95 instead of $7.95 for a full order.  We had the wedge salad which was good.

For dinner we ordered the select 6 stone crabs, the surf and turf with filet and three stone crab legs.  The stone crab legs were very average and not very sweet.  I was suggested to order the 6 premium for $40 instead of the $30 for six medium.  Not a great suggestion at all.

We had the key lime pie and the havana cream pie.  The key lime pie came out too cold.  Get that thing to room temp first before presenting it to customers!

All in all, I had talked up this restaurant to my gf and her sister and we were very disappointed.  To top this, we didn't have any alcohol and the total bill came to $190!!!!  How did that happen.",DxQeJSiKJUmWIre2XGaKGg,0,1,2,J0Trq0CWFjQJqUiOTfN8pg

This is it folks! When you're looking for a filet that is so good it speaks to your soul look no further - get it at Joe's. I generally do not order filet mignon because they always seem to lack flavor. Delmonico's is a prime example of an over priced bland filet. Thank God for Joe's that a sista can finally enjoy a figure friendly cut of steak that is out of this world. I ordered the lunch special and for $21.99 here's whatcha girl got: 

Petite Filet - Awesome! 

Jenny's Potatoes - Not the greatest. I would never order this again. The hashed brown potatoes didn't look any better. They looked like an over-sized overcooked baked potato. 

Grilled Tomato - Phenomenal. Never had anything like this I'm my life. One slice of a grilled tomato covered with cream of spinach and then layered with baked cheese...don't knock it til you try it. 

Two Crab Claws - My awesome waiter threw these in for free to ensure that I at least experienced the famous crab claws. He was honest about stating they were not in season. They were a bit frozen, but still okay. I was glad I didn't order them as my main course. 

Key Lime Pie - The Bomb! The lunch special actually came with banana cream pie...once again my waiter went over and beyond to hook me up. 

The service here is the BEST. Everyone is there to ensure you leave extremely happy. My server went as far as to squeeze lemon juice over my hands prior to handing me a hot towel...OMG!!!

They didn't take reservations and it was at least an hour to 2 hour wait for a table. It didn't matter what your celeb status or fame was. You waited in line just like everyone else. 
Except for me thankfully. A distant cousin of mine used to be the Captain of that restaurant. The Captain is basically the main host and in charge of the staff. 
I ate there many many times whenever I would visit and Joe would even give me a box of some stone crabs packed on ice to fly back home which was NYC back then.
My friends and I would feast as soon as I got home...LOL... 

The reviews I've read sound like it's the same ownership group or a very very good copy cat of the original. 
The original Joe's was famous for the Key Lime Pie, crab cakes and other items mentioned in some of the reviews. 
I will have to check this place out for myself as I'm only living here 3 weeks now.
The original was always a 5 star rating and I would very very rarely rate any restaurant with 5 stars except for perhaps Peter Lugers in Brooklyn. Gosh....I so badly wish there was one here.",sry3QWzd-r1Tw2Ox9fuM7Q,2,0,4,p0iu0Uur6D2S62eNncF0OA

Lately I have been coming here for lunch, they have an amazing lunch menu, and my favorite is the Chopped Seafood Salad that has shrimp, lobster and Alaskan king crab. The dressing is amazing, not heavy at all. For $16.95 you really can't beat this! Oh and the bread basket, SO GOOD! I love the cracker with everything on it, my friend and I usually fight over it.

For cocktails, if you feel like drinking a days calories in liquid form, you have to try the Key Lime Martini, it has a graham cracker crusted rim and is made with the same ingredients they make the actual key lime pies. It's amazing. My other favorite is the French 75, served in a champagne flute, Bombay Saphire Gin, Prosecco, fresh lemon juice.

(the sucker was BLOODY!) yes, she sent it back twice, but for the price we were paying, the waiter mightve exercised the ""customer is always right"" policy rather than rudeness. now she's never going back and ill have to think twice.

3873277,2015-06-05,5,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"We visited Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab on 05/24/2015.  Both the food and service were above average.  1 star deduction is due to being seated at 7:40 PM for our 6:30 PM reservation and cold bisque.   The reservation system in a restaurant of this caliber should run more smoothly (in my opinion).

Items ordered and shared:

Crab Bisque: $9.95.  Lump crab brought out in a bowl and the bisque is poured over the crab table-side.  This would have been better if it was hot, but it was cold and cold cream based soup is not the best.

Colossal Lump Crab Cake: $17.95 Mostly crab, hardly any filler and very delectable!

Bread Basket: Dinner roll, onion loaf, soft pretzel stick, olive bread.  The soft pretzel was amazing, but the other breads were just okay.  That was fine with me, it just left more room for all the other marvelous items we had!

1 LB of Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs: Market Price, $59.95 that night.  Fantastic!  Pre-cracked so you just had to gently pry them apart.  Steamed perfectly.  Texture and taste were great, I didn't even need to dip them in butter.

'Select' Stone Crab Claws (6 per order): Market price, $64.95 that night.  These were very good, however they pre-crack the claws before they are brought to you, and the way they were cracked caused the shells to shatter like glass, so it was a little tricky to eat them without chomping on a shell fragment.

Petite Filet (8 oz): $35.95.  Quite possibly one of the best filet I've had in Vegas.  It was cooked perfectly Medium Rare.  Juicy light red in the center with a fantastic crust on top.  

Fried Asparagus: $10.95. Because why just have regular old healthy asparagus?  Let's bread it and fry it.  Okay, well, as much as I wanted to mock this when it was ordered, it was freaking amazing.  

Joe's Big Daddy Potato: $10.95 (not on the menu, suggested by our waitress).  We tried a couple bites of this, but had so much other delicious items to choose from, that we pretty much neglected it.  It was basically just a loaded baked potato and you can get that anywhere.

The night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. Mainly looking through yelp to find one. I didn't really want to get a buffet but I wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! I got what I wanted and called Joe's Seafood up. 

They said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. While walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in Vegas and I saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts. 

I did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. So off we went on this find adventure!!

The Order: 
Crab Cake- It is one large crab cake which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. The inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. The taste is amazing and I would say this is on my top 10 list of crab cakes. 

Stone Crab Claw- Had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. Just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. The flavor is nice and and amazing. I wish I could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!

Crab Bisque- Not my favorite thing on my meal. I didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. It tasted way too fatty for me and I just didn't like it. 

Parmesan Crusted Halibut- Need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. Also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. Love love it!! Must order if you come here. 

Half order of mashed potatoes- On the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. I can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!

Half order of mac and cheese- I see mushrooms yeah !! :) I liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. Not from Kraft and it does taste a whole lot better. 

Overall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. I know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..I can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! Most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! Everything was large and good !! The only thing I would suggest not getting is the crab bisque. 

But my experience at Joe's has made me want to come to Vegas more often to get a nice meal in!! See you soon Joe!",UQa9RqoJZWAawzqN-2pT2Q,2,2,5,fJIGkEMkn-YCTt4IYMse5g

It is confident, delicious, but not stuffy.  In Miami, Joe's has been around forever, but it doesn't suffer from the ""grand old favorite"" syndrome -- where everything feels tired and under glass.  This is classically-presented seafood, with exceptional service and stylish decor.

On a personal note, I still remember the delicious meal I had at Joe's in Miami, 18 years ago!  My mouth still waters.  When I discovered that Vegas had an outlet, we raced over.  I believe this is the only West Coast version of Joe's... so it's like a rare bird sighting.  Grab it if you can!

The crab bisque is rich and wonderful, with the broth poured over a bowl stacked with crab.  Yum!  The Caesar Salad is fresh and terrific.   The oysters are fabulous, with a fine selection, and the server quite knowledgeable about their different qualities.  And the piece de resistance... the reason to travel to Joe's... are those Stone Crab Claws.  Joe's has some special technique for harvesting the crab claws, then tossing the crabs back in the water to grow another one!  It seems like black magic, but it's quite delicious.  We honestly thought we were stuffed and couldn't handle this final course, but the claws are quite truly the most delicious crab you'll ever have.  We ate and ate.  They come with a mustard dipping sauce, which is terrific, though they're wonderful just plain, too.  I assume they fly these crabs in every day from Florida, because the texture and quality was absolutely perfect. 

Yes, this is a rave.  One tip: When I tried making an online reservation through Open Table, the system said the restaurant was sold out (a Saturday night on a holiday weekend).

Located in the forum shops at Caesars Palace.

First impressions,  it was packed when we arrived for our 6pm reservation and there is a lot of seating.  They have ""patio style"" seating, then ""bar style"" seating inside the doors, then the formal seating in the back.

We had reservations for a party of 13 people. The table they had set up for us was for 10 people, they said there was nothing they could do, as the restaurant was fully booked.  

I ordered: 

Charred Octopus - very good flavour and melt in your mouth tenderness.

Bone-In Filet Mignon - cooked exactly how I asked for it, but to be honest, the quality of beef at home is much better.

Sauteed Broccolini - very small portion for a side

Hash Browns (Big Daddy Style) - it sounded better when the server was describing it.  It's a huge portion, so I would share it with 4 or 5 people.  It's hash browns mixed with bacon and sour cream, covered in cheese and baked.

Service was good, other then the seating arrangement.  Drinks were always refilled, answered all our questions, gave us ample time to decide.

Sad to say, this time around I was very disappointed with the stone crab. I opted for the 7 pcs medium sized claws. One claw was still frozen and few were a bit slimey. All seven didn't taste fresh at all. I had to douse it in their famous mustard dipping sauce & lemon. Not sure when and how often they get new shipments, but I suggest you call ahead of time to find out so you can eat them when they're relatively fresh. 

The king crab louis salad was fresh, light, and tasted great. Only downside was that there were small pieces of shells in some bites. But my three stars goes to this dish.

I had dinner here on Sunday (1/22/12).  I made a reservation for 4 PM and was seated promptly.  I was asked by the maitre d' for my choice of watching football or watching people.  When I chose football, he showed me to a high top table in the front of the bar area.  Directly in front of me was a flat screen with the 49ers/Giants game.  During commercials, I could look out to the patio in the Forum Shoppes and people watch.

Since I chose this early time, the menu given me was the lunch menu.  I was told I could order from the dinner menu if I wanted, but the server didn't go to get a dinner menu.  It was just as well.

I ordered a cup of Stone Crab Bisque, the 12 ounce New York Strip Steak, and an individual portion of sautéed garlic spinach as my side.  For dessert, I got a half portion of their Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge.

The soup was quite good.  The cup was just the right size.  The steak was superb!  It was charred on both sides and very rare inside--just as I ordered.  With it, they brought a small container of seasonings--ground salt, dried garlic, and other spices--to add to the steak.  It was great!!  The garlic spinach was also excellent.  Finally, the server told me that they had half-sized portions of dessert.  That's what I got, and it was more than enough to finish the meal.

Two reasons for the 1/2 star deduction from a full five.  One, since it was lunch, I guess, the bread selection wasn't a selection.  I was brought 2 small rolls, something I could buy in any grocery section.  That was quite disappointing.  Also, I waited about 10 minutes before the server first came to talk to me about ordering.  Since I was in no hurry, and I was watching the game, this was no problem.  Still, someone should have stopped by to assure me my server would be along.

So, imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw the Las Vegas destination listed on OpenTable.  I made a note of this exciting fact and convinced my friend to try it during our trip to the crazy city.

The lunch hour brought a substantial crowd to the outpost at Casear's Palace, and we had to wait quite a while only to grab two stools at the packed bar.  Our busy and bland waitress/bartender did little to speed up our dining adventure.  We dug through our varied bread basket, each new roll or flat bread an exciting discovery.  

We each ordered the Seafood Chopped Salad, the dish that Joe's had won me over with.  The large bowl of mixed greens was topped with slices of hard-boiled egg, cubes of cheese, and various fresh vegetables.  Large succulent shrimp, flavorful lobster claw meat, and chunky Alaskan King Crab were scattered throughout the plate.  The shellfish tasted fresh from the sea, perfectly crisp and tender.  In terms of dressing, I had requested the Joe's Vinaigrette on the side, but was told that it usually comes with the creamy Italian instead.  However, the waitress offered to bring me a cup of each, which I was so thankful for.  The house dressing was more like an oily, garlicky salsa with chunks of ripe tomato.  The Italian vinaigrette was also delicious, with a light-bodied seasoning.  Since the Joe's version contained vegetable pieces, you could basically spice up your salad with drizzles of each.

The king crab and stone crab are amazing, and the Chilean sea bass is to die for. Patrick was our server and he was super helpful and probably the coolest waiter there is. 

This is on the fancier side, but you don't have to wear your nicest suit to eat here. The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. The prices are not over the roof, you get what you pay for though.

I've been to the Miami location and Chicago (is it even there anymore?). SO had never been. 
We ordered Pacific crab claws (completely disappointed that there were no stone crab claws...why do they keep them on the menu when they don't have them?) which were pretty good with the traditional mustard sauce, the 12 oz filet medium rare and the spinach. 

The filet was the winner this night. It was cooked well and the seasoning salt that accompanies it was delicious. 

We really liked the crab claws, they were tasty. We just wished for traditional stone crab as SO had never had them before and they are so hard to come by.

The spinach: frankly, I make better sautéed spinach at home. 

I loved that they had Albariño and Sancerre by the glass. The wine list was nice and not exorbitantly marked up like everywhere else in Vegas. 

For dessert we had peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. It was standard. 

Joes reminds me a lot of Ruths Chris but add crab and minus some of the more delicious sides like sweet potatoes. 

The service was excellent, as expected.

All in, it was $160 for two of us, splitting the filet, crab, 1 side, 1 glass of wine, a soda and ice cream. Pretty reasonable for Vegas!

Its a great restaurant if you aren't looking for the most favorite meal experience of your life  which you can also find in Las Vegas by just trying out your most favorite chef's restaurants.

The seafood here is too good to be true.  I went there this past weekend for my Valentine's dinner.  We had the medium order of Stone Crab, and the order of King crab legs.  The stone crab is kind of tedious to eat since the meat really sticks to the shell, but it tastes so fresh, you will want to make sure you get every single piece of meat off the claws.  The sauce it comes with is very flavorful too.  MM hmm..to die for!  The king crabs....are definitely KING.  They're huge!  They are not your average size crab legs you find in the buffet.  These are like 1 inch in diamater thick crab legs.  They come pre cracked so you don't have to deal with cracking them yourself.  Instead, enjoy them with your bowl of drawn butter.  So fresh, so good, so meaty, and well worth the $60 you'll pay for them.  

For sides, we had the steamed asparagus, and the pan roasted corn. The asparagus was bland, but the corn was delicious!  I've never had pan roasted.  I like the texture!

For dessert we had the havana dream pie and a cappucino.  The pie was super tasty and yummers.  A little too much custard, but I like the white cake it lays on.  So good!  Cappucino was of course excellent. 

Nice atmosphere as well, with nice wait service.  The maitre'd was super nice too.  I recommend this place for a fancy date dinner if you both love seafood.  I had a great time there! =)",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,1,0,5,PSTJW-xz7dFwYc9FmOWydQ

* Service/Staff - 10 out of 10 - Very professional and knowledgeable - couldn't ask for more
* Atmosphere/Cleanliness - 10/10
* Food:
     - Jumbo Lump Crab Cake 10/10 - Was the best I ever had...it was a real crab cake meaning it wasn't polluted with breadcrumbs and fillers it was FULL of delicious melt in your mouth lump crab. If you love crab/crab cakes please consider ordering this!
     - Scallop potatoes - 6/10 these were ok a bit over cooked but still not bad
     - Creamy spinach - 8/10 really good but nothing to write home about
     - Steak - 8/10 petite filet paired with a lobster tail was yummy no complaints here. the filet had a nice crust and yet was still tender. Good job! The lobster tail was one of the best that I have had. It was good in size and was tender! Nice to finally find a place that does not over cook the lobster.
     - Keylime pie 9/10 - no explanation here other than...good lawd I wish I had a piece right now...LOL The crust was perfection and the pie had the right amount of tart/sweet.
     - Lemon drop martini - 10/10 I wanted to gulp it down like a glass of water but since I was out on a date with the man I love and in public...I didn't. :-) It was sooo good! 

Summary: Will definitely dine here again. They are superior at seafood and good at steak. If you are a surf and turf fan like I am then this is the place for you. If you are purely a steak connoisseur like my fiancé then you may prefer Craft at the MGM. I enjoy both so this was a great choice. 

Recommendation: Probably a good idea to make a reservation. The resturant was packed yet the staff never made us feel rushed. I made our reservation and we were seated upon arrival.

We went for my husband's birthday and had a great time. Obviously their signature stone crab claws are excellent.

My husband had the steak and king crab, which was also very good. I might complain about the amount of king crab (it seemed like less than one leg), but we were so stuffed, we didn't even finish everything anyway. Our sides were the corn and creamed spinach.

You can't go wrong with Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab if steak, crab, and carbs is on your meal plan.  The gf and I came here for a Halloween dinner date.  This wasn't our original pick, but I'm glad we ended at Joe's for dinner.  From start to finish, the service was excellent.  We had reservations, which meant no wait.  Our orders were taken care of quick.  But most importantly, we were taken care of good.  

Like most restaurants, we started with a bread basket.  Their mix of bread and carbs didn't have a chance. We killed every piece of bread in that basket.  Then there was our meals.  I had their Petite Filet Mignon, but this was not petite at all.  Here at Joe's, they do everything big. A petite filet here is 8 oz and cooked to my liking (medium-well).  The filet was tender, juicy, and so so good. I'm not stating that this is the best steak that I ever had, but it's still good enough for me to want to come back.  My gf had their Florida based Stone Crabs.  You know, the parrot beaks that you see on the billboards off our freeways.  I think she loved it because she finished her plate. For our sides, I got the mash potatoes and my gf got the mac n' cheese.  And of course she did.  The mash potatoes and mac n' cheese, like the bread, didn't have a chance.  Both were good and a must if you're having steak and crabs. 

Overall (ie. long story short)...Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab has good steak, fresh crabs, and great service.  Prices are decent as well. 

Parking Tip:  Valet at Joe's.  If you're going through the main Caesar's entrance, it's the first right after the Caesar's and Forum split.  Sure beats having to walk through the Forum Shops to get here.  

PS:  I've been told that the Alaskan King Crab is the best at Joe's.  I have never been a huge Alaskan King Crab fan. But those that are, should give them a try.

Food pros: The food is delicious, fresh, perfectly prepared, hot, and filled with flavor every time! I love going during lunch for their specials. Entree, two sides and dessert! What more could you ask for? I am OBSESSED with their roasted corn side dish. It is my favorite thing on the menu. I have to have it every time I go. The lyonnaise potatoes are also at the top of my list for sides. Crispy hot potatoes with sweet savory caramelized onions on the bottom, yummmmyy!! Their crab legs are always amazing and fresh. I appreciate them being cut already. The dipping sauce is tasty and a perfect compliment. Their filet mignon is bursting with true beef flavor and always a perfect medium rare. They have the best bread bowl. The pretzel bread is my fave. I know they have a huge menu, but I always come back for the same amazing dishes every time. 

Food cons: None! 

Service: The service is beyond impeccable each and every time! I don't know if they have a special training just for their servers but you can't find better service anywhere. I wish I could remember his name, possibly matt or mark. But he was the best server I've had in my dining experiences at any restaurant. Fast but not too fast, attentive but not overbearing, professional but fun, and extremely accommodating. My mom and I love the pretzel bread in the bread bowl. We asked if we could have more. So he brought back another bread bowl filled with just pretzel bread! Plus a yummy mustard sauce. 

I will continue to dine at Joe's as long as I live in Las Vegas. It will be the first place I recommend to friends in town and the first place I take anyone for a delicious meal.

4059073,2016-08-26,32,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I have only had stone crab claws at a now closed restaurant in Newport Beach, so when I heard Joe's (originally from Miami Beach) was opening a location in the Ninth Island (Vegas), I had to hit it!  Joe's is located on the bottom floor of the Forum Shops near the main entrance.  Although their signature seafood item is stone crab claws, Joe's also offers king crab legs, lobster, oysters, and steaks.  

We started off with 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters ($16.95), the select stone crab claws (MP | $49.95 for 6), and fried calamari ($14.95).  In addition to select size crab claws, they also offer medium and large.  Sorry, only the oysters and crab claws are pictured.

First of all, the oysters were super fresh and briny.  It was a great way to start the meal w/ a savory steak to follow:  5 Stars.  Secondarily, the calamari was OK.  It was fresh, but I thought the portion was small for the price:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the crab claws were surprisingly mediocre.  I was expecting a mind numbing experience, but my cousin and I thought they were just OK.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong size, but we were not impressed:  3 Stars.

For our entrees, we ordered items like crab stuffed shrimp, filet mignon, surf & turf ($54.95), salmon, and bone-in ribeye ($54.95).  You know what I ordered, because it is the only entree pictured - LOL.  My steak was excellent.  It was huge, void of any unnecessary fat, and cooked medium rare as requested.  Additionally, it was seasoned to perfection:  5+++ Stars.

For our sides, we ordered french fries, mac & cheese, creamed spinach ($8.95) and broccolini ($9.95).  Sorry, but I was only able to take a good pic of the spinach.  All of the sides were very good, and reasonably priced compared to Mastros:  4 Stars.

For dessert, we ordered the signature key lime pie, coconut cream pie, and a brownie sundae (all $8.95 each).  You know what I ordered, because it is the only dessert pictured - Hehehe.  First of all, the key lime pie was sublime (get it?  Hahaha).  It was tart, and had a perfect graham cracker crust.  Likewise, the brownie sundae was excellent, and it was a huge portion.  My only rec is to offer walnuts on the side.  Lastly, the coconut cream pie brok da mout (tasted very, very good).  It too had a perfect graham cracker crust, but the toasted coconut put it over the top.  Joe's version of my fave pie is the best I have ever had!  I didn't mind the price, unlike overrated Pie Hole in DTLA:  All 5 Stars except the last item which was 5+++ Stars.

The service on Sun, 8/7 @ 6:30 pm from Mike V and his team was excellent.  He and the rest of the team were super nice, attentive, and just a pleasure to have as our team.  In addition, Mike was really knowledgable about pairing wines w/ entrees, and informative about the menu.  He really earned his 20% tip:  5 Stars.  Not to be outdone, the ambiance is fancy w/ a lot of dark wood.  However, it was not overly loud like Mastros Beverly Hills or Costa Mesa:  5 Stars.

I can't wait to return to the Ninth Island, and to hit Joe's again.  The food, desserts & service are fantastic, and the prices are more reasonable vs Mastros.  Dinner for 7 w/ no alcohol was $610 inc 20% tip.  I've paid more than the foregoing for a table of 5 at Mastros!!!",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,51,46,5,u5FWveGPJ6vOs1BuDlnRzg

The spinach was tasteless and boring. My objection is with the maitre'd. He likes to talk about off roading and how he owns a jeep. I know this because all he does is stand there and talk about that shit with random people. The last thing on his mind is seating you. He gives you no updates on your status and only when he feels you have waited long enough, he will talk into his secret service wanna walkie talkie and tell you, ""Ok. You have suffered enough. I will finally seat you."" Mind you... I was in a party of 3. As soon as we walked in, there were empty tables all around us. My recommendation: give this idiot a kickback.

I had the Alaskan King Crab and Fillet  (AMAZING) and my wife had the giant crab cakes.... she loved them. A couple of sides and desert... wow what a great meal!

When the app came out there's only one on the plate and I'm confused. So he apologizes for the miscommunication and brings us another crab cake, insinuating he will take care of the mistake and not charge us for the extra one. On top of that, he bought out a THIRD app, shrimp cocktail, to apologize for the mistake yet again, which we didn't ask for! When we get the bill we were charged $40 for the two crab cakes, even though it was his mistake for misspeaking about the portion size AND saying he'll ""just bring out another one"" without my consent!

Each claw is about the size of a thumb. The meat - perfectly chilled and just the right bounciness in the bite. The dipping sauce - creamy, tangy, flawless.

Everything else - The fish, salads, Stone Crab Bisque, steaks, the impeccable service - all top notch. I've visited the Chicago mothership several times and can vouch that the Vegas version stays true to the quality of its brand.

I had the Ribeye which was OK, nothing fantastic.  It was a bit on the small side for a Bone In Ribeye, but since I was still on east coast time so it was really late.  Sweetie had the Sea Bass and liked it.  The side dishes were also very nice we had the Lyonaise Potatoes, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, onion straws and maybe one other, all were tasty.
For dessert someone ordered the Peanut Butter Pie which was VERY tasty and to call it rich would be an understatement.  Since there was 10 of us they added a percentage to the bill for a tip, which is normal but then the waiter made a point to let the member of our party that was paying know that he had to share the tip with the other people who participated in our service so it was customary to add more so that he gets his fair share.

The waitress brought out a bill for 13 people, we all sat next to our significant other and thought she had been paying attention to the orders but the bill came and she refused to separate it. To make it even worse we were only then informed that they can only take 3 credit cards and the rest had to be cash. We were all from Canada and don't carry that much cash as we spent around 125$ each. 
We asked to speak to the Manager as there were 6 couples and 1 single that needed to pay and most needed cards. They wouldn't accept this and said there was nothing they could do about separating the bills. After 20 minutes of arguing with management one of our group members divided the bill into each member's total for their incompetent staff. We then had to figure out how to pay. After dealing with this absurd rule we eventually just told management we can only pay with credit for the most part and each group was separated. After sensing the frustration they reluctantly allowed more than 3 people to pay with credit. 
When paying the waitress said to one of our group members, ""you university students must not eat at restaurants like this much"" and that ""you just don't know how its done"". First of all, after refusing to separate bills a waitress is not likely a mathematician and the room had multiple doctors and university lecturers. No students.

It is usually customary to inform the guests that there is an automatic 20% gratuity with groups, We realized this after closely examining our bills but she was sure fishing for an extra tip. I am always happy to pay for good service, but this was an absolute nightmare. 

So needless to say all our other meals at ""nice"" restaurants started off with asking the wait staff, can we get separate bills and can we each pay with credit cards? To which the staff looked dumbfounded and replied: ""yes of course, why?""

For a much better experience go to Toa or anywhere else.

I have made sure to tell everyone I know going to Vegas to avoid Joe's. I'm sure it would be great for couples, but a group of any size should avoid it at all costs.

Joes is consistent, fresh, yummy, excellent, fulfilling, and fast....(i could go on longer but I'll refrain) I do not like crab. Ugh crab is just so foul, so what do you order when the place is known for crab... salmon! oh my goodness, I love love their salmon. Then again I love all salmon but there is spectacular. Do NOT get it with their buttery sauce, it is perfect with just a hint of lemon. Mmmmm. My father likes to try other things so I would nibble off his plate since I cannot stray from the salmon. I've had their steak, I don't know which kind but wow. For a seafood place they can make a steak. Let me explain: My dad likes to get steak cooked black and blue, literally only warm on the inside, disgusting, and when I still had a bite I was in love. I didn't feel that I was just eating a lab of undercooked meat, I was gourmet-ing. THe ambiance is nice, the food is awesome, the service is sufficient, the key lime pie is fantastic.

I made a reservation using Open Table and ended up in the very back of the restaurant which apparently most people don't know even exists.  Joe's is a very large place!  I started with an iced mocha coffee with nonfat milk.  Very happy because a lot of restaurants only offer hot coffee and since I do not drink alcohol iced coffees are my drink of choice.  I then had a blt wedge salad which I loved!  I was unsure I would like it because I like classic wedge salads but all the toppings and small cut bacon and eggs were very good.  I then had the $74 king crab legs.  I loved how the legs were cut for me to easily pull out the chunks of meat.  It was a HUGE amount of crab and sadly I could not finish.  The waitress offered to wrap the rest of the meat up for me but I was not going home for a long time so this wasn't possible.  I would recommend if you go to Joe's you share this as an entrée meal.  The sides were good and apparently you can get half-orders of sides.  I tried to creamed spinach which was about what I expected, as well as tried the broiled tomatoes.  You wouldn't know from the menu that broiled tomatoes are actually broiled tomatoes with spinach puree on top and then covered in Wisconsin cheddar.  I did like the tomatoes and would not have ordered them expect another person in my party wanted them.  My boyfriend had the liver which was wrapped in bacon.  He had never had liver before but we figured if he ever wanted to try it then here was a good place to try it.  He did like it!  I refused to try it.  I'm sorry I'm narrow-minded!  Since I am a local and my boyfriend is a local the waitress brought us each a slice of pie that we shared with the table.  I guess if you are a local and it is your first time you get a free piece of pie!  Yay!  My girlfriend, who was also stuffed with king crab, devoured the banana cream pie that had real banana slices at the bottom and caramelized nuts on top.  I had the chocolate pie and I loved it!

Yesterday I decided my treat was to get some crabs.

Ok, Ok, get your mind out of the gutter, even if I am in ""Sin City""  you know that is not where I am going with this. 

Joe's has a dark wood interior with a large patio and all the servers in their crisp black and whites, I felt a little underdressed in my no-makeup-tennis-shoe look.  This was not to stop me, however from getting my crabs.

For those that don't know, stone crab is only really in season for three months and usually comes from the Gulf in Florida.  It's a rare treat, these little claws of perfection, so you have to get them while the getting is good. 

I sat down and the server immediately came over. She was pleasant and helped me find an excellent medium bodied glass of white wine to complement my seafood. Throughout my whole meal she was attentive, polite, and personable.   

I chose an appetizer for my lunch, but this was no mere starter - this was the ""2nd Mortgage"".  A stone crab claw, a jumbo shrimp, a small lobster tail and a small portion of shrimp/scallop cerviche, all chilled with cocktail and mustard sauces for dipping.  This was a dish to relish so I took my time. All the seafood was cooked and chilled to perfection with that just caught fresh taste. I really wish I had just gotten a plate of the stone crab because that one claw was so good I am already having major cravings for more.

The total cost of one meal would be close to $150 per person at those places.  The quality is also good but nothing spectacular.

Joe's steaks, filet mignon, lamb chops, glazed cod, etc. are all excellent!  The prices are reasonable.  The sides are great.  The stone crabs are delicious as well.  The atmosphere is nice too.

Yes, we started off with 14 ""select"" stone crabs! 14 of them!!!! (120 dollars worth of stone crabs). This was delicious like I remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that I could dip anything in it! We also tried the Rockefeller Oyster which I was not that impressed. I didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....

I ordered the Bone In Ribeye this time and I shared it with my dad. I had it cooked Medium. Well, last time I had gotten the filet mignon and let's just say I was a bit disappointed with the steak. It was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all. Luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor. However, I was a really REALLY disappointed about my steak. The Jennie's mashed potatoes made up for it though as well as the garlic Spinach. I didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!

My other foodmates ordered the fried chicken (heard it wasn't as awesome as KFC's chicken, but he is a teenager), sea bass (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my Aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized). Overall, I think the food was enjoyable, minus my dry steak.

Now the service....I understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically. Since its a ""nicer"" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service. Maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars I think we deserve some good attention. It's not that we were getting HORRIBLE service, we just were neglected. I watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there. After my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away. In MY opinion, I think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab? Maybe I'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean I don't love Joe's...I just would ask for a different server. 

Overall, the Havana Dream Pie is to die for and I love their stone crabs. Next time I will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,6,4,4,EbrHIc60tulcpwgXdLr31Q

These babies are only harvested in the Gulf of Mexico and they take one claw at a time so that the crustacean can regenerate a new limb. The dipping sauce is what really makes this dish stand out as it has a dozen different ingredients. My friend ordered the Chilean Seabass which was glazed with miso.

They cooked the crab perfectly and the meat was sweet and delicious. Add some butter to that and talk about a great meal! The second dish we got was the fishermans platter, I wasn't super impressed with it, especially in comparison to the crab. But my brother and sister shared the stuffed sol with lobster tail and they were raving about it. My dad ordered oysters, and usually he'll share at least one with me because he knows how much I love them, but not this time. He devoured them in seconds! I looked over and they were all gone!!! 

We also ordered some sides, and all of them were great. If I had to choose just one, my absolute favorite would be the mashed potatoes.

Our server's name was Hope and she was great.  We started with a crab cake appetizer which was full of crab meat delicately seasoned. 2 of us ordered the Joe's lunch special for $24.95 which included a 6oz filet, grilled tomato topped with creamed spinach, Jennie's potatoes and desert.  What a great deal that was. The other person in our party ordered the fish & chips (with sweet potato chips) and a side dish of macaroni & cheese. The fish was very good with a light batter. He did not care for the sweet potato chips they were a little greasy and cold. The macaroni & cheese was hot and delicious. For desert we had the banana cream pie, tres leeches cake and the brownie sundae topped with ice cream. The banana cream pie and the tres leeches cake were both something we will have again. Our waitress was very helpful picking out wine and checked back frequently to see if we needed anything. Service was great and the food was great-
 We will definitely be back and will ask for Hope. Lunch is very casual, we all wore jeans and nice shirts-there were people eating in shorts. Dinner is much more formal and expensive.",535H0AVY41CWfHGjYhEoKQ,1,1,4,LDWaPTxu3JY9FBNvqWQSAA
4245985,2017-01-28,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"You guys. Joe's is AHmazing. Stone crab is perhaps the best crab I've ever had. It's meatier than Dungeness and sweet and alllmooost as good as lobster (and that's saying a lot)! And the horseradish mustard the crab is served with is absolutely perfect. I've never had crab with mustard before and it's a terrific idea. 

The service was also exceptional which was surprising because this is a tourist joint. I mean, it's right next to the fountains in Caesars Palace. A millions thanks to Neil & Eric for making our night. We were here for my sissy's whirlwind bachelorette party and we only had time for one nice restaurant so I'm relieved Joe's exceeded expectations. 

My only word of advice: don't get the steak. Trust me. I would complain about how dry my steak was if I wasn't so enamored with the stone crab. 

Oh, actually, I have one more piece of advice: Get the mac n' cheese. It's probably the best mac n' cheese I've ever had. Perfect balance of cheeses and the gooeyness is stunning. I'm dying for the recipe!",Zpdh9rHGEHkwJwrsTbHnyA,0,2,5,xk1xjsaU7fCntk88F_sBaQ
4246583,2013-08-06,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Sigh ... I hate it when I have to give a place a so so review because of service personnel and not the food.  I had a crab bisque, and my fellow eaters had a shrimp dish and an ahi dish .  We were all happy with that part.  It was the cocktail issue that had me like ... what?

In most places, bar, restaurant, arenas, wherever, when you order a double, you pay more.  Duh, makes sense.  But in VERY few places if any, does a double LITERALLY mean double the price.  Ask the people at the Cirque shows who will sell you a single cocktail for 12 or a MONSTER for 18.  Anyway, the point is, had the waitress been clear, we would have had no issue.  But when you say, ""You want a double?  You only pay a little more,"" you are misleading your customers.  One thing is 12 to 18; another is when you pay $1 under twice the amount for a double.  Really?  Who you fooling there?  I repeat, had you been clear on this whole thing, then it would have been up to us to take it or leave it, but don't mislead your guests with such nonsense.  At the end of the day, I can drink cheaper and better in 10,000 other places in Las Vegas.

4265106,2010-05-05,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"So the food here is amazing, the reason for the 4-Star knockoff is on it's way... 

I've dined here many times, and I love it, all I really order are the stone crabs and mashed potatoes. The stone crab is moist and juicy and oOoOo so yummy! 

Service, they treat you like royalty. Attentive, they have back servers so if your server is no where around they are able to assist you. It's fine dining, it's great. Our favorite server is the one they call 'Grandma'.

The reason for the 4-Star knockoff: 
On February 25, 2006 (yes I remember the date, you'll see why) we went out to eat, because we, my (now) husband and I, had become engaged just before heading over to Joe's and we had a reservation, it was a saturday, in the winter time, it wasn't busy. The ""outdoor"" seating area was practically empty and the indoor seating area wasn't busy as well. 

Here's what ticked me off... I walk up to the hostess counter, the guy behind the counter, the one with the green bow tie, has been working there, for, FOREVER. He doesn't know who we are, since we only go to this restaurant for special occasions, as this was... Anyway, we tell him that we had a reservation for a party of 3; myself, my (now) husband and my (then 9 y/o) son. The guy writes something down and tells us that ""It'll be a 10 minute wait"". Well, we were there for 34 minutes, yes I counted! There were people that were coming in, after us, that were being seated and we had been waiting there! I assumed that they all had reservations but when one of the people that were seated ahead of us, another party of 3, walked past me to use the restroom, I asked if they had a reservation and they said ""no"". I was FURIOUS, WTF, I just got engaged, I was so happy, way to tick me off!!! I don't know what it was, but my (now) husband at the time tried to calm me down but I used to be in the restaurant industry, I have never done this to anyone, why the hell would they?! They're a fine dining establishment?! I did not understand this crap.

I don't know what it was, could it have been that we had a child with us? (BTW, there were other children dining there, I tried to find some logical reason for this crap) Was is a racist thing? Heck if I know, it doesn't matter what it was, it was WRONG and the end result: because of that, even IF I love their food, they get a 1-Star rating. This situation really upset me, I cringe every time we go there and I see that DB.

Needless to say, this particular night, we ate at another restaurant and it goes to show, bad service can leave a bad impression that can last for YEARS.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,4,0,1,TGb3wplCEryuyrHpgUIREQ

The fillet itself was not particularly memorable and having not been particularly impressed with the Stone Crab at the Miami location, I figured that I would give it another try.  I was more impressed with the thickness of the shell of the crab, dumb I know, but I came away with this experience realizing that I did not have an appreciation for Stone Crab, I simply can't tell the difference between it and it's more simple sibling, the crab.

The only real highlight was the crab and artichoke gratin appetizer - quite rich and gooey and I would order it again if I opted to try stone crabs for a third time, but honestly, I think I'll pass on them for something tastier.",ntlvfPzc8eglqvk92iDIAw,0,0,3,C8MvZxXaVDBaYN6_hPRzDg

When we arrived the host commented on what a beautiful dress my fiancée was wearing (she had been getting looks all night). We were seated immediately for our 9 pm reservation. After careful consideration of the menu options we started with the half dozen oysters and a bottle of Red Spanish Wine.

The sides Joes grilled tomatoes and the 4 Mac n cheese. Everything was outstanding, cooked and seasoned perfectly.

Whether it's a light meal alone, with a partner, or with a group, Joe's Las Vegas never has failed to impress me. Patrick, Tim, Diane always seem to make it a experience vs merely a meal. I've discovered new wines and new foods here.

Always allow your server to select which stone crab you'll have. They generally know what's best on any given day.

I heartily recommend any of the bone-in steaks vs the standard steaks. Joe's specializes in bone-in. The Chilean sea bass is the only seafood I'll eat, and I was cajoled into trying it by Patrick at Joe's. As usual, he was right. I love it.

The $40 filet mignon which I ordered as medium rare came WAY over cooked, and when I asked for a replacement (at $40 for a piece of meat, it better come the way I ordered it), not only did the second steak come undercooked, it was completely cold inside...they took a steak from the fridge, threw it on a grill that was way too hot, and served it rare and cold. Who is in charge of this kitchen? Our waiter was not only unapologetic about it, but acted put out by their mistake and hurried us out. The stone crab was not worth the money either.

Their stone crab offering was pitiful I guess.  From San Diego, I can goto the docks and pickup stone crab for $2.50 per stone crab, and I eat the whole thing (not just the big claw).  Here they were essentially charging $5 per claw, and that's it.  

So ignoring the ridiculous stone crab, we ate this family style.  We came with a party of 10.  We ordered a few 24oz dry aged rib eyes which were very tasty.  They pre-sliced them into strips for us which was great for sharing. 

We ordered enough King Crab legs for everyone to get a leg and some knuckles.  

We ordered pretty much 1 of every side, along with some pork belly, shrimps and scallops.  We made quite a dent.  Someone had gotten lucky at the tables and paid for dinner, but I'm going to guess we spent about $100/head, and the food was great and we all left extremely stuffed. 

They comped us some free spring onions, which were also pretty tasty :)


From everything we tried, I'd definitely recommend the dry aged rib eye (although you can get good steak almost everywhere on the strip these days.. I'm not gonna lie and say their steak was better than what you could have gotten at CraftSteak, Carnevino, Cut, Delmonico, Prime, etc...) and the king crab was good.  For the sides, I wasn't a huge fan of the fried asparagus, but I did enjoy the spring onions and broccolini.

4369092,2018-05-25,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"What to add to all the excellent reviews - not much other than five straight years of pretty much dining perfection.  There is a certain professionalism at Joe's that says we know how to run a restaurant - trust us and your experience will be great and they are right.  The atmosphere is definitely upscale which can be strange with a clientele wearing everything from evening gowns to t-shirts - seriously folks can you at least try a collar but somehow it all works cuz' Vegas right?  Our group, which can vary from twelve to four, goes every year at a convention and the place just doesn't disappoint.   The bar knows how to make the classics because of course they do and the wine list far exceeds my knowledge but again trust your waiter to direct to a vintage and price point that works for you - ours was the Jordan Cab which may have been a little bold for my fish but I managed.  So you are at Joe's and you ARE getting crab but I am not getting Stone Crab - wtf you say - well as good as they are (and as expensive as they are) the Stone Crab is just not as good as the King Crab legs.  Where do they get them (I know water) but these put the King in King Crab and so many times when shell fish are larger they loose flavor (looking at you giant prawns and four pound lobsters) the Crab Legs are sweet with the bit of brininess and with the tiniest dip in warm drawn butter makes me a touch light headed - we had a pound and a half - I could have eaten the entire order - in fact have had clients that order the Crab as a meal after to have it as a starter.  I reiterate - do not leave the restaurant without trying the King Crab.  Also split a Caesar salad and while good - the lettuce chilled and fresh - it was missing the sharp lemon tang in the dressing and I couldn't find the anchovies at all - suppose I could have ask for some on the side but it is a large salad that easily could be shared by three.  On my visit last week I went with a friend that  suggested the Sea Bass - this is one of their specialties I just have never had (the had just run out of the Halibut Steak which is my all time fave but now that I have had the Sea Bass it is a toss up).  So the Sea Bass comes with a miso glaze that tops the filet with a golden sheen on the porcelain white fish that melts once your put it in your face - the filet is almost share-ably large (I didn't but did give out a few tastes) and was about as perfect as a piece of fish can be - served with boy choy and mushroom which were fine but the fish - oh my - the fish.  Another dining partner went with the filet - it is after all steak and seafood although I primarily think of Joe's as a seafood restaurant - I had one bite and get it - cooked exactly to medium rare - warm red center of juicy goodness - I would have been happy with the steak just not as happy as with the Sea Bass.  Also had a taste of the Scallops and while certainly good - just cooked through with a little sear on the top and bottom, I have had Scallops as good elsewhere.  We did three side - quick review - spinach was fantastic, maybe not a creamy as some but I liked it better than swimming in a gooey cream sauce, Hash Brown reached a new level in potato supremacy - dark brown char wraps close to mashed interior of creamy potato - wow, corn was more like an elote and I loved it - you could honestly make a solid meal out of just the sides - may be will next year (probs no).  As I mentioned above - service is super efficient, professional and friendly - these guys know what they are doing in every facet of the meal.  Over indulged on everything and could do dessert but they sounded great.  One last note - several people told me Joes' has the best fried chicken ever - we didn't try it but a bunch of people around us did - you may want to give it a good - I will stick with the Sea Bass or the Halibut Steak.

Food: They have a lovely bread basket of assorted rolls, bread slices, pretzels, crackers. c'est magnifique!

If they have it, always stone crab claws. Yes, they are frozen for shipment but still good. And you have to have their mustard sauce to accompany them. This last time they only had the large size. I only wanted a couple of claws and they were large for my appetizer.

If I'm there at lunch, I like to get their 3 course meals. They will usually have two choices - one with beef and another with seafood. I usually get seafood. This last time, they had King Crab Legs.

We ordered a Stone Crab appetizer for all of us to share. It was the first time for me having Stone Crab and I didn't think it was the greatest. But I knew what I had coming, so nothing was going to compare anyway. It probably isn't something I would order again. I absolutely had to order the table-side chilled Alaskan King Crab legs with melted butter. I died and went to heaven several times over! I normally prefer my crab meat warm instead of chilled, but who am I to complain if they're going to do all the work for me? It was so delicious I'm about to start drooling just thinking about how good it was. I normally make fun of my sister about being stingy with food, but I made the most food aggressive dog look tame with my crab legs. The side dishes were good too, which ranged from french fries to baked potatoes to macaroni and cheese to green beans. It was a fairly good list so I don't remember all of them. 

It is a bit on the expensive side (my crab legs were well worth the $60, though) so be prepared drop some bucks.

Entree - Large stone crab; Melts right in your mouth.  You don't need any dipping sauce or butter.  The taste is pure heaven.  Steaks - All steaks are perfecto.  They are lightly seasoned and then brought to the table with a side of herbs, pepper and salt for you to drizzle over yourself.

This particular location is quite random, very bottom floor the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace. When you walk it it leads to the bar area, which seems kinda fun but is mostly there for those enjoying happy hour. Dining area is either in the outside area where you can gawk at shoppers or in the back dining room where it's so dark, you might just fall asleep.  

The food selection is enormous. The wine list is so long, it's actually kinda intimidating, and the specialty drink list looks interesting (I opted for the Pomegranate Martini and ended up with nothing but a Welch's drink). Bread is not very good... they offer different variations which is a nice touch, but I don't know how you could possibly serve 7 different kinds of BAD bread? 

We finally decided on the steak and tails dinner: $49.99 each. Lobsters were small but the taste was truly decadent. Steak was OK - but was a little on the dry side. I did see a waiter debone a fish for another customer and I was truly amazed! He literally got every piece of fish off that bone and in record time, it seemed! Overall, dinner was a 4 stars (counting just the food). 

So, after we were done eating, it took a record of 20+ minutes for us to even flag anyone down to clear our table and bring us our check.

I won't say which one I didn't order, but the steak was the best steak in the universe, the lobster was huge and meaty and the stone crab claws (those poor babies!) were phenomenal. Add to that a special price on the Tattainger reserve and it was one heck of a way to bring in the new year.

The bread basket included several varieties but my favorite was the fennel seed, roasted sesame seed and Parmesean lahvosh. Stuffed mushrooms were excellent.

The service was prompt and professional and I loved how our server kept stopping by to ask us if he could bring anything for us _right now_; very fun. The menu tells the story of the restaurant, founded in Florida, and I remember it well; this location honors the original in proper Vegas style.",TYCkjEHPSJSnFb6m6GDluw,4,1,5,2obKRs4YAknPUWt26KaFUA

This was my second trip to Vegas and we were celebrating my best friends 21st birthday so we wanted to go somewhere special. From the moment we walked into Joe's we were practically treated like royalty. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the lobster bisque. This was seriously the best soup I have ever had. For dinner I had the filet mignon and king crab combo. The crab is served cold which was a bit odd but you can enjoy the sweet taste of the crab meat this way. They also crack the crab legs for you which makes it all the better to enjoy rather than wrestling with the shell. The steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth like butter.

I've heard of John Dori on Hell's Kitchen many times so when I saw it on the specials board I figured I should give it a try.  So I ordered it with their fried asparagus and for a potato to go with it I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said that Joe's is known for their hash browns.  I tought, ""Hash browns with fish?"", but the waitress said it was great.

The fish was served in a brown butter sauce that was quite heavy.  I think that my body being used to eating relatively clean most of the time meant that I was not ready for the richness of the food.  Butter sauce on the fish, fried asparagus and fried potatoes left me feeling a bit sick after the meal.

4428216,2016-11-29,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"The three of us took a meandering road through Joe's menu, starting with steak tartare, moving onto Dover Sole with a caramelized butter sauce for one of us, and a 24oz dry-aged ribeye for each of the other two.  To share, we got the creamed spinach and the lyonnaise potatoes.  Oh, and six of the stone crab claws, which came pre-cracked and with Joe's mustard sauce which was just a little bit mustardy, and really, really tasty.  Dessert consisted of coconut cream pie and their peanut butter pie.  The peanut butter pie, filled with huge amounts of mousse, tasted like someone had made peanut butter into mousse which ... is as designed.  If you love peanut butter, you'll love the pie.

The steaks were deeply red in the middle -- on the rare side of medium rare, which is how I love them.  They were meaty, and rich, and had clearly been sitting around getting older by the day before they got served -- exactly what I'd want from dry-aged meat.  The food was fantastic.  

But the service ... oh, the service ...

Start with the fact that about 3 hours before dinner we asked to change our reservation from two to three and they cheerfully acceded to our request.  Come to the fact that we were half an hour early and they sat us down when we got there.  

And our waiter, Neil? an on-the-nose balance of friendliness, jocularity, but also leaving us alone when we wanted to talk.  The service was IMPECCABLE.  Neil walked us through the menu, suggested a few things, and more importantly suggested to avoid one or two things.  Nothing I hate more than a waiter who claims everything on the menu is great, and telling me that one or two things aren't great builds a ton of trust.  

They paid close attention to us, but from a respectful distance.  I was drinking iced tea and they noticed what sweetener I used and proactively brought me more.  At some point, when I finished a glass of iced tea, I timed it -- it took them 23 seconds to ask if I wanted another one.

We were seated right on time.   Waiter was attentive and helpful.  Ordered a bottle of champagne and started with crab-cake appetizer and Caesar salad.  The crab-cake was very good except for one piece of lump crab that was slightly fishy.  Caesar salad was excellent.  However before we finished half of the appetizers they delivered our main courses.  As soon as our waiter noticed (he did not deliver the main courses) he came over.  We mentioned that never in all of our dinning experiences in up scale restaurants had we had our main courses delivered while we were still eating our appetizers.  By the way, we are reasonably fast eaters and were not dawdling other than to enjoy the champagne with the appetizers.  Our waiter apologized and took the main courses away.

Once we finished the appetizers he brought our main courses- the large size stone crabs and Joe's famous scallops.  The stone crab claws were excellent, the scallops uninspired.

We finished with one of their key lime pies and one of their coconut pies.  Both excellent.  Though we were surprised that no mention was made of our anniversary by the waiter nor a token candled cupcake as was delivered to a few nearby tables in celebration of birthdays.

So all in all an OK experience marred by the rush delivery of our main course.  Certainly not what we expect when spending several hundred dollars on a dinner.",vV7PUam3caKHYlZBgPesQQ,0,0,3,Y1rihOezl_cZCzFwwmovCA

It was the perfect spot to go to for some alone time as we did come on this trip with a group of our friends. It was already kind of late but luckily Joe's was open till 11pm.  We walked in and they were able to take us right away thankfully.

We got served a nice hot basket of assorted bread.  It even had cornbread in it with chunks of corn in it!  That was the best bread basket I've seen (yes bread is my weakness).  Our waiter let us take our time in our orders but was a little slow with serving us and checking on our table.  Not a big deal though.  The food was delicious!  I ordered a seafood platter which came with a lobster tail, shrimp scampi and scallops.  It was surprisingly a good amount of seafood.  My boyfriend got the filet mignon and crab.  Honestly, the portion size was smaller than I expected but it all tasted good so not complaining.  We also ordered a side of broccoli and their baked potato with roasted onion sour cream which was pretty damn amazing. Something about that onion sour cream.  

Their stone crab is what they are known for and honestly wish we had ordered it.  But we already had a pretty filling dinner.  I guess we'll just have to come back and try it next time!  The boyfriend and I enjoyed everything in our meal, including our dessert.  We opted for the gluten-free brownie sundae.  Sounds like an average dessert but it was oh so good and they give you not just 1 but 2 brownies!  It was very moist and chocolatey.. totally hit the spot :)  They also were very generous on the ice cream (I hate places that give you very little ice cream!).

Overall I enjoyed Joe's and would definitely come back here again if I were ever in Vegas again.  Yes this place is a fine dining restaurant but I thought the price was reasonable.

I came with a group of 4 and we were all starving so we decided to just order a bunch of food and share it family style due to it being all put first time dining here.

Food 

MAC & CHEESE - too cheesy imo and was mediocre at best. Definitely needs some hot sauce or something, but hard to eat just by itself. (NOT RECOMMEND IT)

SHRIMP AND SCALLOP CEVICHE - was pretty decent at first bite, but it has this exotic very strong tangy aftertaste that was too much for me. I'm not sure what flavors made it that tangy but it wasn't too delicious. (NOT RECOMMEND IT)

CRAB CAKE - this was simply delicious. has LOTS of crab and the flavors are amazing. only downfall is that the portion is small but I prefer quality over quantity at a higher end restaurant like this. Comes with their sauce and drizzle the lime on top to get the maximum flavor. (WOULD RECOMMEND)

STONE CRAB MEDIUM SIZE - these stone claw crabs, what they are known for, are not worth the price. It is abour $50 for I believe 6 pieces and it is not that good. Maybe it is because it is served cold, but I like my crab served warm. Taste is okay but would (NOT RECOMMEND IT)

RIBEYE STEAK - This is the holy grail along with the crab cake. It is about a $60 steak and it was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare and tasted 10x better than the stone crab legs. Steak is soft and does not need any sauce; just eat as served. (WOULD RECOMMEND)

TENDERLOIN SANDWICH - I was actually surprised by how good this was. The bread was tasty and the meat was extremely soft. Complemented by arugula and horseradish sauce, this dish was definitely my favorite if you consider price. For about $20 you get a delicious sandwich for a third of the price of the ribeye and almost just as yummy. (DEFINITELY RECOMMEND)

Lastly was the amazing service. Overall I think for the cost of the food doesn't match the quality of the food. Food wasn't so amazing that I would want to come back here. For how much I spent, I would rather eat at the Bacchanal Buffet for about the same price.

Notable was how fantastic the lead server, Erica was. She was so attentive and really took care of things so well that the Groom and I were able to thoroughly enjoy our entire reception. Oh AND, the bartenders kept my glass full with VERY generous pours! Cheers to that! 

The room set up was perfect and exceeded any vision I had. Nicole (the event coordinator) did a wonderful job bringing our wedding reception dreams to life. 

Everyone at the wedding is STILL raving about how great the food was, how much they enjoyed their time at Joe's, and how much fun they had. We had the Salmon, Filet and Chicken all served for our guests and everybody loved everything they ordered. I had the salmon and it was honestly the most perfectly cooked salmon I have ever had.

Not much that I can think of but the night we went, there were a lot of older men in groups. So if you're a group of single women, maybe not the best dining place to meet someone. But who cares, go for the food!",fvaconD88YvF2kxMvvurnQ,1,2,5,ROad0BKzPAVZGqklcf9GWA

The claws, tails, and crab legs were also top notch. The servers are very friendly, as is the staff at the door. Overall great experience. You must go here if you enjoy seafood.

4593299,2015-11-27,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"First of all, been dreaming of trying stone crab ever since I saw a feature on a food show! So when I had a chance to try it in Vegas at the very  restaurant I saw it on 5 years ago, (the original is in Miami ) I did not hesitate. Mind you this is my thanksgiving dinner,and expectations were quite high. We were greeted warmly and from the beginning treated like we were valued guests. Our waiter whose name is Perry deserves 6 stars because he was probably the best waiter I  have encountered in my life. He passion for food  and friendly advice made our experience unparalleled. Now let actually talk about the food.  They started us of with a bread basket which contains 4 different selections, the  best in my opinion was the cracker bread followed closely by the pretzel roll. We ordered spinach stuffed  mushrooms and they are amazing! We both had the select stone crab about  one pound,  and my God  are they delicious. Being from San Francisco I have always thought dungeness crab was the best . But as of right now I give the nod to the stone crab. It is served with Joe's special mustard which is great, but I asked for some cocktail sauce,  which hands down the best I have ever had. For  our  side we tried the lyonais potatoes very good. I really had such a great experience here that I  just had to post a short story of a review to give them the props they deserve.  Special shout out to Perry's bosses your boy  is doing exceptional work and should be recognized!

As a solo diner with limited stomach real estate, I was really glad to hear that I could order Joe's stone crabs by the claw instead of finding myself required to commit to an order of 5-7 based on size for $39.95+.

While I awaited my meal, they brought out a rather lavish bread basket of five different options at which I picked at selectively in order to not overstuff the belly.

That evening I dined lightly on a single large claw $13.99 and a side of sauteed broccolini $9.95.  The crab shell was quite thick, but fortunately they serve it cracked up for the picking.  For something labeled ""large,"" it wasn't actually all that large, so I was glad that I had opted for this size claw over both the medium and the select, which resulted in more meat for the same work exerted.  The broccolini was the first green thing I ate in Vegas and I found it crisp tender, garlicky and quite good.

I was seated in the dining area by the bar where they have a set up of tall round tables paired up with tall chairs.  At the end of my meal, a lemon water dampened cloth was brought over for me to wipe my hands.  For additional cleaning, the bathroom was up a flight of stairs.

4673947,2017-07-17,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"My girlfriend and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price

We went to Joe's Seafood while we were in Vegas for a friend's 40th birthday. 

FOOD

The food was really tasty.  We had crab bisque, seafood pasta and a Filet & Tail.  We were not hungry enough for sides but the rest of the table enjoyed the selection. 

The Crab Bisque was prepared better than the majority of restaurants. The only thing it was lacking was a little extra Crab.  I had the Filet & Tail.  The steak was prepared medium rare how I like it and had an excellent side seasoning which you don't need to much of but is good to bring the flavor together. The Lobster tail was good but a little over salted.  My girlfriend has the Seafood pasta and said it tasted too healthy.  That is not a real complaint unless you are anti healthy options.  The pasta had a subtle pesto flavor and was cooked perfectly. The Seafood was also prepared very well and combined with the pasta to bring the tastes together very well. 

Overall the food was about 3/4 of a star. I am taking a little off for the over salting of the lobster and lack of crab in the bisque. 

ALCOHOL

The alcohol was pretty good. We are big Bourbon drinkers and they had a good selection of bourbons and my girlfriend had Amador neat which was the first time we tried it and it was a great sipping Bourbon.  

I had an Old Fashioned which was made very well. My girlfriend found it a tad too sweet. However it was one of the better Old Fashioned I have had compared to other seafood and steak houses. 

Our friend had their version of a Cosmo and said it was very good.  

Overall I would give the restaurant 1/2 a star for alcohol. 

CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE 

The restaurant was very clean which is to be expected since it is a Seafood and Steak place in Las Vegas. Since I complained about the restroom in a previous review I will note that this one was very clean. 

The ambiance is great although a little loud but that is to be expected in a steakhouse with a large dining area.  This is not the romantic dinner for two stop.  

Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star. 

SERVICE

The service was great the waitress was excellent and gave good suggestions when asked.  She was also patient with me when I was breaking down the bill for three different payments.  Since I end up doing this at every outing, her patience was very much appreciated. 

Overall the service deserves one star. 

VALUE/PRICE

The restaurant is priced appropriately for being a Seafood and Steak Restaurant in Las Vegas. We had four drink, two meals and a appetizer and with tip the check came to $200 which is absolutely reasonable.  My one comment on this though would be for that money there are better options in Las Vegas.  If I was at their D.C. location I might visit again.  

Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star. 

In conclusion the restaurant is about 4 stars.   There are far better options in Las Vegas and I probably won't be back unless someone reserves there again. However, the food, drinks and service were very good and should be recognized and rated appropriately.",1oh9rKh3FBtpoV2We6JRNg,0,0,4,pdqpQMA5dGn2RIZ8l5PoZg

They get you in, seated, drinks and breads to your table, server goes over the menu, make your selection, minutes later the food is out, eat, drink, pay bill, leave. You could seriously have a really good surf and turf dinner in under an hour.

The seafood is fresh, easy to get out of the shell (sign of freshness) and best of all...sweet! The steaks; I ordered a petite filet and my wife ordered the bone in filet... both were cooked perfectly (medium rare). Quality cuts of beef! Not sure if they season the beef because they offered us a side of seasoning with our steaks. The seasoning was good, but I wish my filet was already seasoned with this stuff so it wouldn't need it.

The reason why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because that I wish our server had a little more personality. He was such a machine and gave us the feeling of being rushed since he was quick to do everything, including clearing our plates. My wife wasn't really done with her entree and he was ready to clear the table. The whole staff was very efficient and doing their assigned jobs though.

On a side note, my wife didn't necessarily love this place. She said the seafood was good, ceviche was not, she was disappointed in her mashed potatoes and she also thought her cut lacked seasoning (salt/pepper). She compared this place to a better tasting Outback lol",5aFBj0emFzoXsUcKbDQZiA,0,1,4,8rZCCvyJtW-E8XFOstpJUQ

Our server wasn't the nicest person...he didn't smile and never made eye contact. However, another employee who always picked up our food and cleared the table was seriously the best! He was so friendly and kind. 

We decided to try out the fried oysters. We are both not oyster lovers, so we decided to give it a shot. At first, it was ok, but the larger pieces were so soft and the fried crust was not crispy. It tasted like mush. If you're not a fan of oysters, I'd stay away from this dish. 

We, of course, ordered the stone crabs. They were pretty pricey, but delicious! I liked that the crabs were already cracked, so it was pretty easy to eat. There was a ton of meat in each crab. The crab was served with the house mustard sauce, which was ok. I would prefer something spicy - like Tabasco, but I did not ask for that. 

Our last course was the rib eye and a side of asparagus. The rib eye was cooked perfectly, and we requested that they cut the meat into slices to make it easier to eat. The side of asparagus was just ok. At first, it was weird because the asparagus was shaved, so it was white. I would have preferred more flavor too.

You have to order the stone crab because the dipping sauce that they use is the best dipping sauce I've ever had with seafood.  The sauce is a mustard type of sauce and goes great with the crab.  The Steaks are fantastic and don't forget to put some of the seasoning on that they bring to the table, it is a mixture of salt pepper and other seasonings.  My favorite side is the Mac & Cheese, WHICH IS THE BEST IN VEGAS!

We ordered Stone Crab as an appetizer to share. It was good but I think they over cracked it, every piece of meat came with a tiny piece of shell with it.

We ordered The Whale and Select Stone Crab for appetiser, very fresh seafood. The stone crab was cracked well enough for us to peel away the shell and devour the deliciousness! Best way to enjoy crustaceans is definitely with good ole lemon juice, there were plenty of lemon slices for us. Love and highly recommend both dishes!

Mains we ordered the Filet and Tail along with a seafood pasta dish, the past was pretty average in my opinion and bland. I needed to salt it quite often, I wouldn't recommend the pasta.

We begin the dinner with an appetizer of stone crabs.  If you have never eaten stone crabs before...think crab with a hint of sweetness.  The stone crabs are cracked, so you just have to peel away with ease and enjoy.  For our main entrees husband and I are all business and get steaks.  Please note that all menu items are a la carte, so any kind of side must be ordered seperately.  My husband opts for the ribeye cooked medium, and I get the filet mignon (also cooked medium).  I took one bite of my steak, closed my eyes, and I swear the restaurant went quiet. It was one of those moments. For our sides we share a serving of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic.  Both were very delicious and complimented the steak really well.  Lastly for dessert we were unsure of what to choose from because they had such a long list of pies.  Our waiter Ben suggested we share a slice of banana creme pie with fosters sauce (apparently his favorite).  Ben..if you are reading this review...you are a genius!

If I lived in Las Vegas I would be totally broke.  Not because I would gamble my savings away.  It would be because I would have a permanent seat at Joe's.

For entrees, two of us had the shrimp scampi over linguini while the third person had the fisherman's platter.  He loved it but was disappointed there was no cod.  Linda apologized and explained they had run out of cod so they gave him extra shrimp.

We started with a half dozen of raw oysters and stone crab claws. The oysters were juicy and delicious to the point I didn't want anything except a dab of the vinegar ice to go along with them. We had an assortment of oysters, and I particularly liked the Stellar Bay and Naked Cowboy. 

Our stone crab claws were also delicious. The shell was peeled away much like a hard boiled egg, leaving the juicy meat exposed for us to devour, which our group did pretty efficiently.

I had my sights set on the grouper, but our waiter made a gentle nudge to the Chilean Sea Bass, telling us it was flown in that morning. It was a great suggestion and I'm happy he recommended it, because it was outstanding.  It came by itself, but we ordered a variety of sides to go along with it, and it was plenty filling and perfectly prepared. 

One person at the table ordered the scallops, and I have to admit I had a little bit of food envy. I sweet talked her into giving me a bite and almost took her plate. I was secretly hoping she ate too much bread and wouldn't be able to finish her dinner, but she did.

My family and I made reservations since it was my cousin's birthday and she wanted to have it at a classy place. We were all dressed and looking fly!! We valid parked of course and went inside. This place is absolutely beautiful and the man who greeted us was beyond nice and funny too!! The hostess walked us to our table which was a great size for the 5 of us. What I quickly noticed was that there was a family of maybe 6-7 who were dressed very very casual, as if they were at a outside park softball game. The children had coat hoods and hats on at the table and didn't look very representable for a restaurant like this. I wish their waiter, or the manager ask the parents to have their children take their hoods and hats off at the dinner table. It brought the classiness down a bit. 

We ordered water first and then drinks. I ordered a glass of Rose and it was delicious and strong. The water was good too as if they used bottled water instead of sink water, lol. I ended up ordering the Seafood Pasta since it had all the yummy seafood in it and the all greens salad ($9.95). The seafood pasta came with lobster, Alaskan king crab, shrimp, and lobster broth and sound to die for ($42.95)!!! The salad came first and OMG...I split it with my cousin and I should have ordered it to eat by myself because it was delicious!! What was awesome is that the waiter knew I was sharing it with someone else and he had already split the salad between the both of us in two different plates. They also provided us with table bread that had 5-6 different choices of bread....I had the Hawaiian roll which was nice and soft. My food came, and the appearance was very beautiful and just enough for me.  I begin to eat it and to my surprise it was JUST OKAY....the pasta had no taste at all...no season, no salt, no pepper, no love at all. I added pepper, salt, and it didn't help. It was so bland, I asked the waiter if I could have some more pesto sauce, and he brought me butter.....ummmmm butter isn't going to help this dry pasta at all. My cousins (2 of them) also ordered the seafood pasta and we all felt the same way. I felt bad for the birthday girl because all she ate was the meat in it and nothing else. I ate the meat too after that I couldn't bear the bland pasta anymore. It could have been my southern roots, but I felt the chef in the back needed my assistance in the back with the pasta.  I didn't even waste my time asking for the rest of it to go because I knew I was just going to throw it away.

My other cousin ordered the Seafood Grilled Platter that came with Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Tail, and Scallops! I ended up digging my fork in her plate and her seafood was really yummy and grilled perfectly! I wish I would have gotten that and it was a few dollars cheaper. Lastly, my other cousin got the calamari and I was disappointed by the look because it seemed that the calamari came from a frozen bag. I tasted a few and there wasn't a crunch to it and it was soft....not good at all. 

After an okay dinner and paying a $375 bill plus tip, we left and had drinks at a Hotel bar and closed the night eating Panda Express and sadly that satisfied me more.

Cauliflower Gratin- This was cauliflower served with cheese and a little horseradish. I thought it was OK (I'm not a big cauliflower fan) but my Husband loved this too.

Macaroni and Cheese- So yummy! I really liked this and I almost finished the entire thing myself! A bowl of this is good enough for two or three people. Super cheesy with good flavor.

Tender Greens Salad- This was pretty much lettuce and dressing. It was good, and a huge portion. Vegetarians don't have too many options here!

Manhattan Clam Chowder-  My Husband's latest obsession. He thought this was amazing and put all the other chowders he has had to shame. Said the stuff that he buys in the can will forever be ruined after tasting this perfection.

Moscow Mule- Really good and mixed perfectly! I have never had a Moscow Mule before (shocking I know) but this was delicious. It tasted herbal. Yummmmmm.

Just how I like it!!! My side of sweet potatoes and rice was also out of this world! My husband had a french dip sandwich and that was also very delicious! Sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked!

I can honestly say after dining here last evening that this may be one of the best meals we have had in Vegas in many years.   Reservation for 8 People 7PM arrive 30 minutes early to this large multi room venue located 1st floor of the Forum Shops.  Saddle up the bar which is packed and have quite a bit of drinks over the next 30 minutes.  1st Nice surprise of the evening they are not Knee Capping you on Booze. Very reasonable priced cocktails across the board.    

With that complete we are seated promptly at 7PM in the back room of this clubby type feel steak and seafood establishment.  Its quite loud and bustling but I never felt crowded or pushed.   Menu's provided as well as special menu with today's market priced stone crabs and king crab leg pricing.  Considering they are flow in daily from Miami price points are well REASONABLE for what you pay much move for locally in South Florida and to be honest not as good.   Waiter Ryan states although we are famous for Stone Crabs steaks are their thing here as well.  So Off we go. 

1st off Basket of various homemade flatbreads, breads, pretzel breads etc with nice whipped butter await us as we sit.. Wine list is a bit. Pricey but vintages are accurate and a couple of Magnums later we are moving along.  

Crab Bisque is as good as anything as anyone has ever had.  

Chopped Joe's Salad is perfection while it's pretty tough to screw up a wedge they did not and a nice blue cheese dressing with amble bacon etc make all salads a winner. 

Some of us had orders of Stone Crabs for appetizers and they truly didn't disappoint.  Cracked to perfection, cold and clean and sweet made these as good as south Florida no question.   Large 1lb of Alaskan king crab cocktail $69.00 was as fresh and succulent as anything I've ever tasted. 

We could have stopped there but we rolled right into some Filet Mignons Petit $35.0 VERY REASONABLE.  Cooked to absolute perfection.. 

Sides Mushrooms not on menu were simply OK.... 
Onion strings Excellent
Sweet potato fries top Shelf
Garlic crusted mashed were good

Key Lime Pie for desert Sinful. 

Service was well PERFECTION... brisk without being pushy, helpful and one of our diners who was not feeling well left before eating and his order was gracefully cancelled. 

In Short This place does it right and you can see why it is absolutely packed.   For what you get in this very overpriced city it is great to see top shelf food, service and atmosphere with great pricing make it's way back here...

This is one of the few places I know that serves the Florida Stone Crab claws. The first time I had them I was amazed at how sweet and fresh the claw meat taste. I have eaten my share of crabs, and I think these claws are by far the best. They are served with a unique, sweet mustard sauce.

The stone crab claws are considered sustainable seafood. This means the seafood is harvested with consideration of the environment and the future of the species. The stone crabs are found in the waters along the coast of south Florida. Fishermen catch and release the crab after taking one of it's claws. The second claw is left intact so the crab can survive while it regenerates the missing claw. It is nice to know that steps are being taken to preserve the futre of stone crabs, and that a crab didn't die in vain.

This place is high end in decor, service and quality, so expect to lay out about $100/person for drinks, salads, entree, etc.  But if you have never had a stone crab (I hadn't), it was a great experience.  Had to go with the 4 piece appetizer crab, which comes peeled like a hard boiled egg.  Really superior crab and you get their secret or not so secret mustard sauce, which was so good, I wouldn't let them take it after the appetizer.  Plenty of other things to dip in that sauce.  I had their BLT Wedge for a salad.  Nice portion, great mix of tastes, highly refreshing on a hot Vegas night.  For entree, I tried the Coho Salmon, as it has a short season, so you can't always find it.  No room for extra sides for me, as the crab, salad and salmon did me in.  Wish I had room for one of their famous pie desserts, but had to run off to see The Who at Cesar's, so saving that treat for a future trip.  Top line service.  We did originally get sat by the kitchen, but after lousy tables all weekend (and we had reservations for all the restaurants), I wasn't going to put out that kind of money for a lousy table.

If you do not like scallops, this is the dish to change your mind IMO.

The Crab Bisque is great.  I am usually not a soup bisque person but I would definately have this when I come back.

Each piece is approximately a 1/4 lb, yes they are huge, and meaty, and well in one word, incredible. What I described is solely an appetizer, but I decided to make it my main course along with a side of their roasted Brussels Sprouts. 

I was too full to order dessert, but according to my friend, their pies are phenomenal, and the calories don't count if you're eating their pie because it's just so heavenly.

Although a variety of bread is presented in the basket, the bread lacks freshness and isn't served warm.  The butter was hard too.

My husband and I order calamari everywhere we go and this was pretty poor- small skinny pieces, chewy and nothing special or tasty about it at all.  The breading wasn't hot and crispy like one would expect.  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes from a box.  My husband got the dover, which was deboned tableside, but it was relatively tasteless.  He also had oysters and they were ""meh"" according to a guy who eats them often.  

I had scallops and shrimp as my main course and both were overcooked which really impacts the flavor and texture of those foods.  I let my husband try some and he concurred that they were overcooked.  It's pretty bad to get that wrong when you are a steak and SEAFOOD restaurant.

The service was good although our table remained covered in crumbs and even though I brushed the table off in front of the waitress, she never scraped the crumbs between courses or when clearing the table like they do in a lot of ""better"" restaurants.

I called the manager to let them know that me and my boyfriend believed we may have gotten food poisoning from there the other night. We both
felt ill the next day, and was pretty sure it was from the 2nd morgage appetizer. It was delish- don't get me wrong, I even took pics!  

Anyhow, after asking me a few questions, she asked me when was the last time I ate prior, and told her at Red Rock Buffet for breakfast. The manager then asked me ""How much did you two drink by the pool"". We are locals here- and I was highly offended. We live in Summerlin and went there for breakfast, you can't beat a made to order  ommelette  and
 coffee for 5 bucks! So I wrote a note to corporate, and the Las Vegas General Mgr. got in touch with me and stuck up for his manager. Poor customer service, every single person I ran this by also stated this was offensive to them as well. It is a shame, it was our first experience there.

I'm from Cleveland, been in the biz, and been to lots of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Chicago. I will not be back at any of them. I felt they treated me rudely and should have just called the health department!",FLZDQWWr2UCwuyFbfVKs8A,3,1,1,2pKGFVV1-X1g7whIjy7WTg

We immediately received menus, and were ready to order within a few minutes. About 10 minutes later we gave the waiter our drink orders (a glass of wine and a Manhattan). It took 30 minutes to receive our drinks. By the time this happened, another table (party of 6) near us that arrived after we did had already received their drinks, bread, and had ordered appetizers. It took another 20 minutes for our bread to show up, and an additional 10 after that for our waiter to take our order. At that point we just paid the bill and left. As we were leaving the table seating 6 near us was already eating their appetizers. It's also important to note that we saw the waiter BS'ing with bartender multiple times during this experience. If anyone cares, he was a heavy-set fellow, with a goatee; avoid this man. I'm not a picky person when it comes to restaurants, but when in a city like Las Vegas in an upscale restaurant where I'm going to spend $60+, the service should be decent at least. The highlight was that they make a mean Manhattan.

TL;DR: It took a half hour for drinks and an hour just to order food. Tables in other sections were getting their food before we even ordered. We left the restaurant only with drinks but without eating. The Manhattan was good.

Ok, what can I say about the crab? I'm a seafood and shellfish lover and I haven't yet had bad crab. Hallelujah to that! Yummy in my Tummy! My friend and I got the medium 7 piece.

My hubby really liked his fried chicken.  I found it tasty, but nothing special.  I would skip this dish.

One of my friends recommended this restaurant and made a reservation for our group. In all my past trips to Vegas and the Forum Shops, I somehow managed to overlook this restaurant, but to be fair, it's on the bottom floor of the more quiet section of the Forum. Once we checked in, I was surprised at how large this restaurant is with several dining rooms in the back. The restaurant was full-it was about 8:30pm on a Saturday. Thank goodness we had reservations! 

I had studied the menu before coming so I had an idea of what I wanted to order. I was in a party of 8 so we decided to share an appetizer and side dishes and have everyone order their own entrees. The side dishes here are a la carte. I ordered the seafood platter, which was a plate of grilled seafood-scallops, shrimp, and a small lobster tail. The seafood was tasty and just what I wanted with the exception of the lobster tail being over grilled. The calamari, mac and cheese, fries, and mashed potatoes were all very delicious! Also, they have an amazing bread basket here, I especially loved the jalapeño corn bread. We ordered two bottles of sauvignon blanc to pair with our seafood, and it was refreshing and complemented our meal perfectly. Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, although it would have been a nice touch if the restaurant provided our bride to be with a little celebratory dessert (I was here for a bachelorette party).

Sides were all fresh and plentiful. Creme Brule was outstanding. Not a single thing to complain about. Refills came quickly, ambiance was nice, service was top notch and what you'd expect from a fine dining establishment. Joe's has it's own Valet separate from the main Forum shops so make sure you find it and use it.

4886486,2017-01-16,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Our server ""Linda Demarzio"" (the one with perfect diction and precise grammar) was nothing short of amazing!  Fun, funny, witty, wonderful, charming, and chimerical!  Linda was attentive to our every need. Smart enough to see that we had a great sense of humor (so we had multiple fun exchanges). She bussed the table herself several times to keep things moving, and was very helpful with the menu and food suggestions. When the time came for the check, it came quickly. No pressure. The other wait staff was wonderful too. No fuss. No muss!

So, why only two stars?  First, ""Tim,"" the first person we met, was abrupt from the get go.  We arrived about 15 minutes early, it looked very busy, so I gently asked if there were any chance that we could be seated early. ""Tim"" responded with a curt, ""No,"" said we would be seated as soon as our table was ready, and with a dismissive snort suggested that we were out of our minds to even think about asking.  We walked around for 15 minutes & returned at our reservation time. I alerted Tim we were back, our whole party was there, and we were ready to be seated. He impatiently reiterated that we would be seated at soon as our table was ""ready."" Nonetheless, I heard him get on his radio and ask for a ""small"" table.  Ultimately, Tim spent his time focusing on the larger parties of six and eight, and we fell through the cracks.  15 minutes after our reservation time, I asked when we would be seated, and Tim proceeded to scold me about how reservations ""worked"" in a restaurant and said he was waiting for other people to leave our table before we could be seated. He then again got on his radio and made a new request for a table for two. Bottom line, no actual tables are reserved. A ""reservation"" to them apparently means you still have to wait for a table -- I guess it's just a shorter wait than someone who just walked in off the street. It was much like the Cheese Cake Factory business model, but without the vibrating and flashing pagers handed out so you can walk around The Mall as a distraction from the interminable wait. 

We were eventually seated 20 minutes after our reservation time & 35 minutes after we first walked into the place -- and that was only after I asked to see a manager. 

Second, the place is basically an over-priced (but leas classy version of) Red Lobster.  In a word, the food was mediocre. The calamari appetizer was soggy & doughy. We split the BLT Wedge salad. It was just average. I had the grilled seafood platter. The dish was tough & overcooked & skimpy at the price point charged. Even the bread was just ""so - so"".

My husband, cousins and I decided to go here for dinner while in Las Vegas (based on the Yelp reviews) to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary and it was also our cousins mini honeymoon.

It was a little hard to find from where we parked - it's on the 1st floor at the far end but we asked around and were finally pointed in the right direction.

Our server, David, was awesome!!!! Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, funny. Couldn't have been better. Our water glasses never emptied, he gave us excellent recommendations when we asked, he checked on us multiple times to be sure everything was perfect - he was just great!

We ended up ordering way too much food! The side dishes are separate from the entrees and, although we found out you can order 1/2 orders of the side dishes, they were still big enough to be shared between the 4 of us.

We ordered the Filet Mignon and King Crab, Filet Mignon and Lobster and the fried chicken. As sides we shared 1/2 portions of the Lyonnaise potatoes, Big Daddy potatoes, roasted sweet corn, Mac and cheese, steamed asparagus, fried asparagus with lemon sauce, creamed spinach. We had SO much left over but oh my Lord the food was SO SO SO good! We all agreed it was one of, if not THE, best meal we'd ever had. The food was excellent!!!! Every item was absolutely delicious!

David also talked us into dessert (even though we were SO full) so we ordered 1/2 portions of the Banana Cream Pie with Foster sauce and Key Lime Pie to share and he also brought us Brownie a la mode for our celebration. All 3 were excellent but the Banana Cream Pie was our fav.

This place is fancy but it's not overwhelming so. We all felt that, for a fine dining experience, this place is very reasonably priced. You get fairly large portions and the even the half sides are pretty large.

Reservations recommended. When we got there for our 6:30pm reservation, their next availability was 9:30pm.

I ordered the lunch special which came with five medium stone crabs, hash brown potatoes, coleslaw, and a slice of key lime pie.  It was a lot of food for $35 and a very good value considering Joe's prices.  The stone crabs were very fresh and tasty with the famous mustard sauce.  I liked the tangy wet cole slaw with slices of tomato.  The hash brown potatoes had a crunchy, deep fried crust and was a very generous serving.  I hardly put a dent in it.  The key lime pie was enjoyable even though I was so full.  Joseph, a fellow SoCal native, was the server and he was so nice, friendly, and engaging.  He was very attentive and personable.

Try the stone crab, what they're known for
Crab bisque is the best you'll ever find (ask for extra crab meat)
Steaks are massive, probably won't finish if you have an appetizer and been drinking for a while

The oysters are so fresh, delicate and tasty. There is NO question that they are extremely high-quality. I could've eaten a dozen more of these bad boys.  The chef split our soup up for us into two cups, which was very nice of him to do. It is silky, rich, and seasoned just right. I think a whole bowl would be too much for me though because it is very rich.

Our steaks were a bit more on the rare side, rather than MR but we didn't mind because they tasted so damn good. The lobster tail is grilled and split for you, and the meat was so tender and had a delicious buttery flavor. We also ordered creamed spinach, which I didn't care for but I'm not a creamed spinach fan. We also got a side of mac n cheese, of course, and it too was delicious.

I was a guest of my sister and her husband, as this was their youngest daughter's 21st birthday.  We had a party of 12, my sister having made the reservation 2 month's previously.  The place was very busy but we were 45 minutes early.  No place to wait or sit as the bar seating is on their ""wait list.""  Our entire party was present when my sister checked in with the host.  

Another man, who was there before us, was waiting for his party (all men).  Apparently, their table was also for 12 and the other 11 showed up after us.  They were seated first, almost immediately, at a much roomier table.  We barely had room for our group and my sister was not happy.  Her husband was at a corner that was clearly not meant to hold dinner service, but we made due, especially as we did not want to ruin our niece's special evening.  

My sister believes that our table was given to the men.  I think she is right.

Our primary server (a woman), was outstanding. She was efficient, funny, and once I made clear I was not the host (I said, when addressed as though I was making the decisions, perhaps because I was wearing a jacket?, ""I am sitting between two powerful women, my wife and my sister, and my sister is hostess for this party), she addressed questions to my sister.  Sadly, the server's backup help did not meet even basic courtesy.  One very tall man acted as though he could not hear my sister when she addressed him, but seemed capable of hearing me?!?  In general, he just came across as rude and very condescending to women.  REALLY?!?  What year is this?

The food was very good, and we ran up a decent tab. While I enjoyed the evening, Joe's has too much competition in LV to treat people this way.  I considered ordering a bottle of a vintage champagne to toast my niece.  I decided against it when I saw how my sister was treated.

Last summer, a larger party (most of the same people) that I hosted at Del Frisco's, was treated like royalty.  We visit LV multiple times each year and have 12 to 15 in our group.  We reserve early as we know how full restaurants can be.  In this case, Joe's disappointed deeply.

We can certainly choose to dine elsewhere.  Perhaps, that is the message we were supposed to receive?  If so, received and understood.  We can spend our thousands in other establishments that understand both customer service and common courtesy.",Z-GH1iazhm6rD5GCpnTUiQ,2,0,2,NQ9GldHE1FhdRI0RhUF_iA

5007618,2010-04-08,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"My GF and I took a long overdue vacation to Sin City and when picking out restaurants came across Joe's Stone Crab!  Both of us absolutely love stone crab and based on the reviews and history, there apparently was no better place.  Well, after eating here, all we can say is that the Yelpers and historians are correct!

Our meal started out with a velvety bowl of bisque which if I kept a list of Top 5 bisques, this one would be on it and likely top it!  

On the recommendation of the waiter, we ordered the Madagascar shrimp which was the size of a child's hand and could have easily served as the appetizer for both of us.  It was perfectly grilled and skewered with a sugar cane.  It was as succulent as a steak but light on the stomach!

Then, the main events came to the table and they left not one tastebud unturned.  My GF dined on the large stone crabs that were cracked to perfection for ease of eats and the meat was unbelievably sweet and perfectly steamed.  I have had stone crab at many restaurants around the Houston area including Truluck's and Pappas, and as much as it pains me to say this, the stone crab at Joe's made their stone crab feel like it was eaten at a chain restaurant.

I opted to have the stone crab for my appetizer and was definitely wow'd.  However, when a man is presented with a decision of stone crab or nearly two pounds of fresh Alaskan king crab legs, the choice it easy.  The legs were steamed, served cold, and hand cut tableside for ease of eating.  The meat was sweet and melted in my mouth and only needed a dab of the drawn lemon butter that was on the side.

And because our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs, our waiter, Andrew, recommended the pan roasted corn.  The corn was fresh off the cob cut into a pan with butter, salt, pepper, and cilantro.  It had a nice bite feel, yet still tender and juicy in the center.  The best part about this side dish is that it had an aroma of fresh popcorn as you ate it.  WOW!

And as good as the food was, the service was far superior to most high end restaurants where we've dined.  Our waiter, Andrew, was extremely knowledgeable and made that great recommendation and the bus staff was extremely attentive to our drinks, and cleaning our tables.

The only thing that prevents me from giving this restaurant a full 5 stars is the $6 san pelegrino and the 2 weak woodford and diets that were ordered!  Otherwise, we say thank you Joe's for one of the best meals of all time!

Top notch and professional. We didn't have a reservation, but they were fine with us, we were seated pretty quick with a party of 9 of us. 

Food 5/5
If you come here, you MUST order the stone crab. The crab comes chilled, when you crack it open the texture is solid and when dipped into the mustard sauce that it comes with, the crab just flat out tastes delicious. I ordered the fried seafood platter that had an assortment of different seafoods like mussel, clams, scallop, fish, shrimp, it was pretty good, the batter was great. Also had the steak cooked medium rare, and that thing was really really really good, cuts nicely, perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth. You know how people say the best tasting steaks are the ones that don't need sauce, this is that kind of steak

Starving for something delicious and meaty we stumbled across Joe's tucked just inside the Forum shops and decided to give it a go.

Although we were a little put off by the pricing, which was expensive at best, my hopes perked up when I checked out some earlier yelp reviews.  

In short ""food delicious, service not so much.""

I would have to agree when I was forced to pull out my trusty ""eyebrow raise/foot tap"" to call one of the hosts over to the front desk.  If am I preparing to spend over $100 on a meal for two lets at least get the front lines ready with a ""hello and how many?""

We sat in the bar at a high top table and were given with a small varietal bread basket to nosh on. We ordered two medium rib eyes, which came out perfectly cooked, and small side order of green beans.  The steaks had a delicious crusty exterior but were a bit salty in my opinion, as were the beans.  Instead of giving a side sauce they included a small ramekin of ""steak seasoning"" which I believe was just extra kosher salt mixed with dried shallot, oregano etc...unnecessary.

Was it good? Yes.
Will I be back? Probably not.

For all the hype that surrounds this place I would have expected something darker, more sexy.  The food was just ok and the old Frank Sinatra-ish vibe could have improved with some shorter tables and/or booths.  I wasn't unhappy but I wasn't completely satisfied overall.

On my last visit, the stone crab claws were a bit disappointing, but we tried them again because it was a first for my friends, and this time, they were delicious.  Sweet, tender, and a better deal if you order the select variety with an order of 6 for $45.  

Of course I had to get the Alaskan King crab legs, and they did not disappoint.  Lunch prices were $55 for 1 pound as opposed to 1 1/2 pound for $80.  If you want the dinner serving, they're more than happy to give it to you.  

Our party tried the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster tail tempura, oysters rockefeller, fried asparagus, sweet corn, and hash brown loaf.   All were delicious, except the hash browns.  I thought they were a bit overdone, and too salty.  They are topped with a ton of caramelized onions which at first sounded perfect, but they were way too oily.  That we wouldn't order again.  

We each finished our lunch with half slices of their pies. The flavors on the table were key lime, chocolate peanut butter, havana dream, and another flavor I can't remember.

My mother has a sense of humor and what's a bit of soda? No biggie. We just wanted to finish our meal. Our server was apologetic and there wasn't really a need. Accidents happen. Then the GM came out and offered us a personal apology, then came the chef. Incredible! They offered a complimentary dessert which wasn't necessary but appreciated.

5055358,2012-06-06,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I've passed by Joe's plenty of times on my many expeditions through the Forum Shops.  It wasn't until I saw a segment on the Travel Channel about stone crabs that I took interest in the restaurant.  When stone crabs are caught, one claw is torn off and the crab thrown back in the ocean.  It's mean but stone crabs have the ability to grow back their claw in about 12 to 24 months.

Three friends and I dined here on a Saturday night at 7pm for our friend's birthday.  The restaurant is more than what meets the eye, there's also a back room with a good amount of seating.  I'm not sure if it's for reservations only but making reservations is always suggested.

APPETIZERS:
*Oysters Rockefeller (4 pieces/order) - Okay.  Though the oyster shells were good size, the oysters were small and the creamy mixture overpowered the dish.
*Stone Crabs - You can't dine here and NOT order the crabs.  I though the crabs were delicious.  They were a bit on the sweet side and tasted perfect with the accompanied special mustard sauce.  The only downer was that it seemed the claws were cracked too much making it tougher to eat trying to pick out the tiny shells.  Do note: stone crabs are more expensive than your normal crab and will cost up to $10/claw depending on how you order (you can order medium, large, or select).
*BLT Wedge Salad - Good, but bacon makes everything taste better.  Our waiter was nice enough to split the salads so it could end up on each side of the table to be shared.  The salad consisted of blue cheese, onions, tomatoes, bacon, and topped off with a vinaigrette dressing.

 ENTRÉE:
*Veal Cutlets ""Oscar Style"" - Pass, I should've stuck to seafood.  The dish was comprised of two small veal cutlets which were breaded and fried, then sprinkled with crabmeat and chopped asparagus, and then doused with a hollandaise sauce.  The main reason this dish failed with me was the overcooked veal cutlets.  The crabmeat was deliciously sweet and the hollandaise sauce helped with the dryness of the veal.  

SIDES:
*Garlic Creamed Spinach - Delicious!  The dish was creamy and full of flavor.  I thought the garlic would be chopped into the spinach, but garlic cloves were cooked on top of the dish.  
*Sugar Snap Peas - Good and extremely fresh.  The peas were had a nice sweet crisp to them.

SERVICE:
Good and extremely professional.",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,5,2,4,oCsm3vCKNFFfs6EmoX8VWQ
5058040,2010-01-09,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"First of all, LUNCH. Surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the Strip: Joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu). 

A spin-off of the Miami legend, Joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant Forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (I also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the Strip and a elegantly old school ""Boardroom"" for private dining/meeting).

Coat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. It isn't surprising to run into both Casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. Tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.

The menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected stone crab claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, shrimp dejonghe (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), crab cakes and fish dishes, there is an excellent Chopped Vegetable Salad, good garlic creamed spinach and roasted corn.

The bone-in filet mignon was among the very best I've had in Vegas. And I have to tell you that I have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.

Our Dover Sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously sautéed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).

The fried chicken was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. Savory but light.

In season, the Alaskan king crab legs here are far and away the best I've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab. 

Their pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. I have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when I complained.

My 9 year old had 3 of their baked potatoes with chives and butter, they are good but then what doesn't taste good with load of butter? 

My older son scored!  his caesar salad was the best to me.  It had the perfect balance of flavors, delicious.  

I was the least lucky one for the night.  I had a TERRIBLE TIME!  All because I started with the half-dozen oysters, which were not what I had expected.  First of all, they tasted bitter! The flavor didn't improve after I dipped them in the sauce it came with.  As a seasoned oyster sampler, I know the good fresh oysters don't need any sauce or dipping, they are good on their own.

Secondly, they were tiny. I'm talking about the actual meat part.  One of them was the size of my thumb nail, no kidding.  

And worse of all, I had a very bad tummy ache right after I ate the oysters.  Ouch, ouch!

At this point I ordered their lobster bisque, thinking it might ease my tummy ache.  But the bisque tasted so weird, it was too salty, and too sweet at same time.  And my tummy ache got worse now, I had to let my son get up so I can lay down.  That didn't help, so I asked for some very hot water. Then another pot, and another.  I was sweating profusely after 3 pots of hot piping water by now, and I was a royal mess regretting ordering that wretched oysters.  But at least I could get up and walk back to our room at the end, thank God, we are not staying at Augustus tower this time, or I have to walk more.

I am thankful to that nice bus boy who brought me hot water. God bless u for ur sweet tender heart.  All this time, our waitress, a well-weathered one, witnessed my pain with such an indifference as if she has seen the world of suffering.  I think she was afraid if she admit i got ill from their oysters we may not pay her.  I know there are people who do that, but not us.  The bill was almost $200 with the wine, nothing was comped even with  my terrible plight.  She was very glad to take the hefty tip from us though.  

I have never had reactions like this to the oysters before, and oysters are my favorite food if u read my profile.  It was just not my night.

Since the rest of my family did have good meal, I am giving them a very generous 3 stars.  I would have rated them higher if the waitress didn't retort me bitterly after I gave her my feedback of the oysters and the lobster bisque each time.  Hey, waitress lady, everyone else may prefer ur tiny bitter taste oyster but I don't, is that a crime?  Also, please don't look aghast when I tell u I didn't care the lobster bisque as if I am not refined enough to appriciate ur ""fine"" dinning.

My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary here and our experience was absolutely phenomenal.  Food was delicious and service was perfection.

This is what we ordered:
- Crab bisque
I am so glad that I found another place in town that has awesome crab bisque because my favorite is actually a lobster bisque that I had once at Treasures (Yeah...not someplace don't find myself returning to just for bisque =P ) It is super rich and flavors are just right.  I loved dipping some of the bread from the bread basket in it. My husband had a few spoonfuls and loved it.

- BLT Wedge salad
From what I tasted, it was OK. Definitely had better.  Still love the ""bacon salad"" at Del Frisco's Double Eagle steakhouse though.

- Stone crab (medium)
You get 7 nice size claws. Definitely enough to share between two people.  The best part was the mustard dipping sauce!

- Copper river sockeye salmon w/ key lime butter
Ever since I had this kind of salmon in Alaska, I've been hooked.  It has just the right amount of fat and is not dry.  Mine was cooked to perfection at medium.

- Dry aged bone in rib eye
Delicious, no complaints here. 

After all of that, there was barely any room for dessert; however, we were presented with a complimentary anniversary dessert.  The brownie and vanilla ice cream was basic, nothing special.  We did ask our server about dessert recommendations for next time.  The key lime pie is a gimme and we were intrigued our servers description of the Havana pie (like tres leches!!).

I am not a big fan of potato but I just can't get my fork off the plate! And I don't mean ordinary potato dishes like baked potato or mashed potato, try Lyonnaise Potato or Jennie's potato! And considering how big the portions are with great flavors, it definitely worth every penny.

5095004,2013-11-04,17,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"October 15, Florida stone crab season OPEN!  Crab lovers rejoice!

Why?  Simple; sweeter than an lobster, tender, juicy, never stringy meat.  Dip them in a tangy mustard concoction and it's fireworks in your mouth.

The facts:
- Available October 15 - May 15.
- Sold by size (medium, large, jumbo, colossal), price increases with size.
- Size matters for texture not sweetness.  Buy the largest you can afford.
- 2013 harvest starting at the lowest in history.  Astronomical prices ($12/claw large, $25/ claw jumbo).

For other menu items, stick to basics; KISS.  Great place for a casual, shared meal with friends.  Solid preparations for grilled lobster tails, steamed jumbo Alaskan king crab legs, classic oysters Rockefeller, and pan seared diver scallops.  The colossal lump crab cake excellent, moist, sweet.  Almost all crab with lumps sticking out in all directions.  Pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  

Good selection of steaks.  Two grades, USDA choice Angus and USDA prime.  All prime cuts are bone in.  Cuts are gently trimmed leaving some of the outer fat in tact.  Old school, fat is flavor style.   Even grilling and cooked to temperature.  It's beef, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

Diverse side meant to be shared.  The grilled tomatoes are the perfect foil for the stone crabs.  Tart, acidic, blistered and  just warmed through.  

Save a little room for dessert.  Home made key lime pie.  They are known for it.  One of the best examples I've ever had.

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Whites perfectly target the clean seafood flavors from Spain, France, Italy and New Zealand.  Modest (2x-2.5x retail), Vegas resort pricing.

Casual, friendly, efficient service.

I had to wait about 10 minutes, but that was fine, surprised though at how packed the so-called patio area was (the couple in front of me was told it'd be an hour for the patio, or 5 minutes for the indoor dining room with the bar table seats). 

This place was OK. I had a big breakfast at Bouchon so I couldn't order the prix fixe stone crab lunch as I had hoped (which is $27.95, not $21 as listed elsewhere). I didn't want to leave without having some kind of seafood and pie though, so on my server's rec, I got the seafood salad. It was a pretty huge undertaking; well worth the $16 - a giant lump of shrimp/crab/lobster on top of a huge chopped salad. I had asked my server what was in it and she only remembered lettuce as being one of the vegs. It turned to be two hardboiled eggs, lettuce, avocado, palm hearts, asparagus -- all nice surprises, though I imagine I'd have a fit if I had a food allergy and wasn't told about any of it. I couldn't finish it, but I did want to save room for pie. As I was struggling to breathe, my server suggested I might try a half slice of pie instead, which was a brilliant idea on their part, and dumb on mine: $3 for a sliver. But that was OK, since it was key lime and possibly the best key lime I'd had in my life. Nice, firm and tart, though the crust on the bottom was a tad hard. 

I'll likely not eat there again since there's so many other options, but it was good. The patio was nice for people watching.",I3IDzhXx8Q6-BPP4vM-vKw,0,0,3,I7AWHfT5op4EHEdc-GrLGA

Maybe I didn't get enough sleep the night before, maybe it was the wait on the runway flying here that seemed like an eternity, maybe it was the taxi driver that took a super long route to get to our hotel, or maybe the stone crabs just didn't live up to expectations. 

The main reason I chose to dine here over other steakhouses for the night (also because Tom Colicchio's new Heritage Steakhouse at the Mirage, which was supposed to open in July, hasn't yet --- August 19th straight from his twitter *crossing fingers*) was for the STONE CRABS. Look at the pictures, they look soooo gooood. I called them earlier in the day and they said I had em, in which case I was excited to try these bad boys. It was fortunate I made reservations in advance, this place was packed. 

When it came time to order, we asked about the infamous stone crabs and were told that they were frozen and she suggested another type of crab legs. The fact that she recommended something else made me a little hesitant but if we came here for the stone crabs, we're gonna get em no matter what. Turned out to be a bit of a mistake, as they were served noticeably thawed and while they were easy to peel, they lacked the WOW factor I was hoping for. I was told before I ordered them that they weren't in season right now and I understood the risk, so i take full responsibility for us not having the best first stone crab experience. I kinda wish I knew when I called in earlier though that they were frozen...oh wells.

I ordered the salmon, which was okay and nothing special. The steak looked really good and the house sea salt mixture that they brought with it was supposedly 'game changing.' Unfortunately, I was just too tired from everything that happened earlier that day that I wasn't in the mood for steak and didn't get to try it. We ordered some sides as well but I don't remember what they were LOL (i do remember sweet corn...that was good) Almost forgot but the lobster salad was very fresh and was big enough to share.

The restaurant itself is nicely lit and was very busy, even as we were leaving. I might come back another day when the stone crabs are in season and I'll order the steak, as it seemed to be well prepared. For now, I am earnestly waiting to try Heritage steakhouse when I head back in September.",1rlB-SWvDU5TnDnym2qeDw,5,2,3,0LB_lDpZCCA9D2Z7QIJAUw

after getting a little lost walking around the forum shops at caesar's (30 mins late to our reservation)... we were ready to try these famous stone crabs from miami. i don't like eating seafood as the main course because it's very light and from my reviews... you should know that i like to feel heavy and full after i eat. so... i couldn't resist the bone-in-ribeye (surprise...  surprise). this was the third time i've eating the ribeye in the past 2 weeks (i'm seeing the doctor next week... might as well hear bad news since i'm expecting it). since i had mastro's (see my review) last week... i had it fresh in my mind and could say that this steak was not quite at its level. but overall it was a very good steak. 

my wife had the large stone crab (5 claws). of course i snagged a couple of them. very good i must say but was a little disappointed with the size. you only get the claws... that's it. i wanted the whole freakin thing. 

for our sides we got jennie's special potatoes and sweet corn. the jennie's special potatoes were twice baked mashed potatoes with garlic, parmesan cheese and asiago cheese. i loved the creaminess of the potatoes and then the crunch of the parmesan and asiago... definitely one of the highlights. the sweet corn was good but regretted not getting the creamed corn.  

a friend of mine got the fried chicken and since fried chicken is a top 5 food of mine i had to try it. the chicken was very moist inside and crispy on the outside but the crust (skin) lacked a little flavor. maybe fried chicken and fine dining don't go together?",wFfkTvSadtqyxhdx0oiGcw,1,0,4,rA5cAXrhsKOiTW5JybWtIQ

5218204,2014-05-21,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I LOVE Joe's. I was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. The service and food are both wonderful. Obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the Las Vegas Strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).

Our charming server (""Steven"" or ""Stephen"", he-of-the-Awesome-Bulgarian-Accent) suggested we start off with the Shrimp de Jonghe appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. Delicious. Joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend LOVED). 

We both ordered surf 'n turf: petit filet mignon (I chose the Alaskan King crab and my friend had lobster). We also split an order of the Hashed Brown potato and the grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce. My steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. However, the crab legs were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so I flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.

The presentation and texture of the Hashed Brown was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). But the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and I don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato Romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). The generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.

We finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). They were both about as good as dessert can get.

To reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). Service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect.",FcBDHJQEJ_n0RV4hZsJu9A,2,1,4,KoAhz6A75ZA7yLJ-PiwWhA

I thought the quality of the stone crab was not as good as the last time, but my husband ordered the Jonah crab and they were sweet and succulent. Also, don't miss the crab bisque...it is perfection in a bowl.  It is a rich, creamy crab soup that is perfectly seasoned! We also enjoyed the roasted corn, hash brown potatoes, and a well prepared Caesar salad, with Key lime pie to finish it all. Our waiter, Danny, could not have been more attentive.

She was very sweet & well versed in her knowledge of the menu. Could not have been happier with the filet lunch special! It was an excellent recommendation - great value for money!!!

My friends and I came here pretty late with reservations at 9:30PM. (PS: Make sure to have reservations). I'll tell you now, but this restaurant is in Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. For some reason, when we called the restaurant to ask where the restaurant was, I was told it was in the Cosmopolitan. When I called a second time, I was told it was near Planet Hollywood. FINALLY, on the THIRD call, (keep in mind I was in a taxi the whole time) I was told that it was at Caesar's Palace. Ugh. Come on now. You don't even know where you're working at!? The service, even at 9:30PM, was just alright, which is a bit disappoint since it is Vegas. We had to flag down someone several times to get our water cups filled and the food came out slowly. Our server looked and acted doubtful toward us as if he was judging us by how young we looked. (Asians just naturally look younger, but we ARE legal!!) 

The food itself is definitely high quality and somewhat small portions; on top of the fact that it is Vegas, the prices were definitely price-y. The Stone Crab was sold out (tip: come early if you want to try), so we settled for the king crab, six oysters, and salt and pepper shrimp. What I enjoyed was that with the crab, there was someone who would open the crab in front of you. Served with butter and lemon, the crab had a nice, sweet flavor with great texture. The oysters were creamy and came with a vinegarette and tabasco sauce. Lastly, our salt and pepper shrimp was fried and paired well with the creamy lemon aioli dip and lemon juice.

The ambiance is extremely classy and has an upscale vibe. The interior decor is beautiful and seems slightly antique. Suited for both groups or dates; it's both intimate and comfortable. It is dimly light, but somehow the room glows; I'm assuming the light bounces off the decor. 

Overall, would return to try Stone Crab and steak, in addition to their seafood selection; although when I do come back, I hope service to be better considering their reputation is of high quality.",5aBgQUMlBdan9TsjR4ZZZA,3,2,3,ugyv_pdFAIQ4dryez47xzA
5225894,2018-01-29,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Excellent service is what shines here.

It's rare that I give anyone five stars, but this place sets the stage for how customer service is meant to be handled. From start to finish the personal touch and extra mile are why this restaurant is one of the best around.

I've been to the Miami location (if indeed they are linked), and the original spot could learn a thing or two from this location. We were seated immediately, and given the usual list that all restaurants meant for this caliber use. The specials announced, the favorites communicated, and this seafood connoisseur had a hard time picking from all the items listed on Joe's menu. Also note that if you are saving pennies, then this menu isn't for you. Captain D's down the street would love to have you. This restaurant is for serious diners only. Don't complain.

The initial breads were good, but not great. Both the cornbread and pretzel breads were just OK, but that's not why I'm here, right? I'm here for sea-critters cooked in a variety of ways, so bread be damned. The crab bisque is served two-part, which allows the solid ingredients to stay together instead of being cooked into oblivion which adds a nice touch. Order it.

The crab and lobster dishes were cooked to perfection, and everyone from our group lauded their choices, and smiles were had once I was finished making a mess with my stone crabs. You can never have enough sea-critters murrrrrrrrrr'natin' in butter to satiate this fat-kid's needs, so order more than you need. It's the American way.

All-in-all, I can't see myself coming here more than once a month due to my dwindling paycheck, but a few times a year? You bet. Our service was on-point the entire night, and this alone is why I would save those pennies I talked about earlier to come back.",dKIMnuRMt0iaVJ2mc0G1yw,0,0,5,g_q-OrRYT1K6KYzLiQSAsQ

After walking through the forum shops at Ceasar's we decided on Joe's. The wait to be seated was about 10 mins...that was for a tall table in the bar area, not the outer patio seating which was packed with lunch customers. We expected the wait as all the reviews warned of how busy the restaurant usually is. 

Once seated, we were greeted immediately and our drink orders were taken. I had the amazing Bloody Mary while my husband had a Stella. Everything came in a timely manner...my Bloody Mary had a gigantic shrimp in it which was fantastic. The waitress then took our order and was very helpful in explaining the menu items and seasonal pricing. My hubby decided on the Fishermans Platter (he chose grilled, you can also get fried) while I had to have the signature crab claws. We both also ordered the side ceasar salad and a cup of lobster bisque.

The ceasar salad was good. Not amazing or anything but a well put together well dressed salad. Now, the lobster bisque was EPIC. Velvety and creamy...my hubby and I were licking our spoons and wanting more. I definitely recommend the lobster bisque to anyone (besides those with shellfish allergies of course). The main courses then came out and they were nicely presented, just simple seafood and simple condiments. My husbands seafood platter was fresh, light, and delicious. The stand out star being the scallops which were super sweet and grilled perfectly. My crab claws we're delicious...definitely a bit of work to get to the meat but well worth it. I wasn't a big fan of their mustard sauce they serve with the claws, so I requested lemons and clarified butter. No issues.

Definitely make a reservation for night, especially on the weekend. We sat in the entry part of the restaurant, which I like because you can people watch and it isn't as loud in my opinion as inside the restaurant. 
The stone crab claws are a MUST ORDER. They're a delicious appetizer and come with a mustard sauce that is very enjoyable. 
Back to the service, the waiter comes over with lemon and hot towels after you eat to clean your hands! That is awesome :) 
For dinner we ordered NY steak, cut into strips. We also ordered crab legs, hashbrowns, and fried asparagus. Everything was cooked very well and came out at once. One of the bussers cracked the legs for us at the side of the table which made eating it so easy! 
Wow. I can't say enough good things about this place. 
It's definitely pricey but worth the price. You get what you pay for here and everything we had was phenomenal. 
The only criticism I have is about dessert... Which was still good. I'm lactose intolerant and every dessert had milk in it of some kind. I can't have dessert at most restaurants, and luckily I was able to order apple pie without the ice cream, but I would have loved to have more variety.

5283954,2012-09-21,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"My husband and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary here. We weren't sure where to eat with all the restaurants in Vegas. It needed to be close to the Bellagio since we had to catch a show and I wanted fish, so we settled on Joe's. 

There are all sorts of flashy restaurants in Vegas, but what's nice about Joe's is it's classy. It's a classy fish and steak house with great service and food. I had the parmesan halibut and my husband a steak with a shared side of broccolini. I could tell the fish was fresh. The parm was a little overpowering, but I scrapped a bit of it off and it was still quite good. And the steak was melt in your mouth. 

Did I mention the service? It was great. We had told them it was our anniversary the day before and they treated us to free champagne. Then the waiter and other staff congratulated us. And the server was always there just when we needed him - not to much, not to little. 

We topped it off with delicious pie. Both the pumpkin and key lime were heavenly. We couldn't decide so they gave us a half slice each - perfect!",toBzVX_l8fsUeqs0EIOdUw,1,0,4,nmn4zCdaPSkY1hOwMk9Jkw

We arrived at Joe's a few minutes late, which didn't appear to be an issue. The server approached us quickly to tell us about the specials and take our drink orders. While looking over the menu, he promptly returned with the drinks and a delicious bread basket (I'm pretty sure we would have made a meal just out of bread if we tried). He then took our orders all while being able to respond and come back with equal humorous sarcasm. 

Our food arrived promptly and lived up to the expectation of the rating. I got the scallops dish, while there weren't many on the plate for the price, the flavor was outstanding. They were all cooked perfectly and the sauce/topping mixture worked great with the mini potato cakes that came with. My husband got the filet which was cooked perfectly. Normally neither of us are a fan of anything additional they bring to compliment your steak, but a little sprinkle of the seasoning enhanced the flavor of the steak wonderfully. There wasn't a bite left on the plate.

Not knowing how big the side dishes were going to be, we opted to get a sweet potato and creamed spinach. Both were huge! Easily could have been shared among three people assuming everyone had the same sized appetite. Both were really good and left us filling full and satisfied.

I do recommend making a reservation. As we were leaving (around 715PM) the place was packed with a long line of people waiting to get in.",Yj1wKYRmEGXhm_bwqSd8tw,4,2,5,uF3lq7KxWLGj8y8ULF4x3A

It was the freshest, most delicious crab I have ever had. The market price when I recently went was around $75 per plate of crab, but it was a lot of crab.

Also, the key lime pie was ridiculously awesome. I've always been indifferent to key lime pie. Joe's pie, on the other hand, was irresistible. Also, the crab bisque soup was superb. Everything I have eaten at Joe's was above and beyond my expectations.

I really like the sauvignon blanc from California. So I have to say their wine selection is quite great.

About the food, I think it was a bit over-priced, which apply to majority of Vegas restaurants on the strip. I had a sea bass because they did not have the scallop. It was not a small piece, but the presentation was quite disappointing. It tasted good, but not amazing, a tiny bit over cooked in my opinion. But very mildly. My friend had fried chicken and seafood platter, they might taste good, but again there was no presentation at all!!  So I really feel their food was just alright. 

Inside was not quite big, and there is wait if you don't have a reservation in the evening, even on weekdays. So it is definitely one of the popular ones in Caesars Palace.",ge_yqJd241NMPuyOS_J_LA,1,1,4,EY3SZ-zGo1h56SIXYQLYUQ

We started with the crab bisque, which happened to be the most flavorful dish of the evening.  After that, we had a round of the oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters were unfortunately so incredibly salty that it was hard to eat more than one.  I pointed that out to our waiter, who's response was ""that's just the nature of oysters.""  Now, having had hundreds of oysters all over the country, I'm fully aware that is not true.

Then came the entrées and sides.  We ordered the seafood platter, shrimp and grits, fried chicken, the mashed potatoes, fried asparagus and Mac and cheese.  We shared bites around the table and everyone's reaction to the food was the same: BLAND.  The ""gravy"" on the shrimp and grits, while appearing colorful and packed with flavor turned out to be under seasoned and flavorless.  What a bore.  The fried chicken was dry and also flavorless.  My sisters husband describe the coating on the outside as ""the flavor of toast.""  He said the white meat of the chicken had more flavor than the coating. 

One saving grace, however, was the grilled lobster tail on the seafood platter.  Found the flavor!

When the waiter came over to check on us, we expressed how underwhelming the food was, he brushed it off and walked away.  Horrible.

The crab cake was quite good.  I thought it would come with 2, but just one.  The sauce could have been a bit better, but the crab cake was truly meaty and tasty.  

The house red was also enjoyable.

The dover sole was mostly a disappointment.  It didn't seem freshly made, though I don't know how that could be the case.  Maybe it was overcooked.  I can make sole better at home actually.  The brown butter sauce was one of the best sauces I've ever had, and that's what made the dish. But at $50 a la carte, I thought that was too much.  

The side of spinach was good, though a bit oily.  

I thought the service was attentive but a bit somber, not sure how to characterize it.  It was effective and they did their job very well, just not engaging.  Might be a preference thing.

We have been back to this restaurant in Las Vegas every time we are in town.  Dining in the Dining Room and on the patio (OK - not outside, but much cooler in the summer, and you can watch people strolling by) are both fantastic experiences, as the servers are VERY responsive, but we have taken to sitting in the bar.  The bartenders are excellent, we were there Nov 24th for lunch and sat at the bar this time.  The service was immediate, offering menus and drinks.  She was busy, but floated back and forth making drinks, while checking in with those of us sitting at the bar.   We get the same meals.  Crab Louis salad is the perfect size.  A little pricy, but they usually are and this one is loaded with crab.  My husband gets the lunch special of 5 medium claws with slaw (hand mixed at the table), hash browns, and key lime pie.  The mustard sauce is to die for.  The side dishes are too much to eat, as you need to focus on the claws.

Made a reservation for a Monday night while attending a conference in Vegas.  The place was crowded.  Seating in the front (outside in the Forum shops), in the middle of the restaurant with the bar, and more intimate dining in the back.  

Ordered the Caesar salad to start - nothing fancy (which is a tad ironic considering the place is located in Caesars Palace.)  Since the stone crab is so famous, also ordered some to try.  Some roasted corn on the side was a recommendation from the waiter.  And for the main course, a dry-aged bone in rib eye steak.  

The stone crab was good - not as sweet as I had imagined.  Then again, being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I get spoiled by dungeness crab.  But good nevertheless.  The steak was fantastic!  Cooked perfectly.  Seasoned perfectly.   The bone-in adds so much flavor.  Superb quality.  And the corn was really delicious with a smoky, peppery flavor.    

To top off the meal, I had to try their key lime pie which someone had said they fly in from Florida.  Not having been to Florida and not sure if this rumor was true, this was still the best key lime pie I've ever tasted.

The usual variety bread/pastry basket is brought to the table at the beginning of the meal.

For the entree I decided to have the Select Stone crab claws.  According to our waiter, the Select Stone crabs are a bit larger than the medium and the shells are less ""grainy"".  For our side dishes we had the garlic spinach, lyonnaise potatoes, and a creamed spinach.

Select Stone Crabs - 6 claws per order and they were delicious as usual. The crab meat a has a very light and sweet taste to it. Served with their signature mustard sauce.  If you don't know about stone crabs then you're really missing out.  These are from the Gulf of Mexico where they harvest remove one of the claws from the stone crab and throw it back in the water for it to re-generate its missing claw.  

Garlic Spinach - sautee'd with A LOT of garlic.  I am a garlic lover myself but the garlic was a little too overpowering to go with the sweet flavor of the stone crab.  This is probably a good dish if you order a red meat dish.

Lyonnaise Potatoes - These are one of my favorite side dishes of any restaurant.  The potatoes are soft and somewhat scalloped, lightly seasoned, and browned for a crispy upper crust.

Creamed Corn - The corn has sweet taste to it with just the right amount of cream and just the right amount of corn.

Shrimp Cocktail - The shrimps were huge and tasted great! The cocktail sauce was extremely hot, but I don't mind it that way.

Large stone crab claws w/mustard sauce - Those claws held the sweetest most buttery crab I have ever tasted. The mustard sauce definitely put it over the top! Heck, even my boyfriend, who usually turns his nose up to mustard sauces enjoyed it.

Filet & Lobster tail - AMAZING! The filet was seasoned and cooked to perfection! One of the best I have ever had. The lobster tail was sweet and tasty.

Stuffed Sole - So good! This was my boyfriends dish, and he reluctantly gave up a bite to me. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was wonderful.

The service was impeccable, and the food great. They initially served a bread basket which was average. We ordered the stone crab claws and shared as an appetizer, and in retrospect, as a crab lover I should have just gone with this as my entire meal. Still, I had the seared scallops which were very good with a potato puree and an amazing lobster buerre blanc sauce. My husband had the sea bass which was SO moist and good. We also ordered 5 sides and shared with everyone. I think the wild mushroom mac and cheese was my favorite, though we tried lyonnaise potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and brussel sprouts as well. 

It was a friend's birthday and they were nice enough to serve a chocolate dessert with a candle on it. I also had a glass of malbec which was delightful and hubs had a grapefruit-y cocktail.

Course 1:  The 2nd Mortgage
It's probably the best course, but it was just so so.  It was a medley of 2 inch king crab legs, 1 jumbo shrimp, half of a very small lobster, and a ceviche of shrimp and scaIlop.  I am used to having at least 3 sauces with my seafood medley.  it came with just cocktail sauce.

Course 2:  Vegetable Chopped Salad
A mix of celery, lettuce, cheese.....  it was flavorless.

Course 3:  filet mignon
My was medium rare and hers was medium.  I came close to choking to death on the first bite bc it was so dry.  I decided to cut down the center and saw that it was red and not overcooked.  I started eating it from the inside.  It was dry and powdery with no beef flavor.  I left a third of it bc I couldn't take it anymore.  Her steak was dry and she left half uneaten.  The sides were mash and grille tomatos.  Both were mediocre.

Course 4:  Dessert
After all that, I decided to play safe.  I got the chocolate fudge pie.  You can't go wrong with chocolate.  With that said, it was nothing to write home about.  She got the banana cream pie.  That was just okay.

Make sure you take a good look at the market card that the server hands you at greeting. It has the market prices for oysters and stone crabs plus any seasonal entrees and sides that are available. We both ordered from the card with my mom receiving a generous, nicely cooked portion of Alaskan halibut ($28.95) and a side of white asparagus ($9.95) which my mother consumed so fast that I did not even get a taste. I started with 6 stellar bay oysters ($16.95) followed by the classic two course lunch ($34.95) which consisted of 5 medium stone crab claws, hash brown potatoes, cole slaw which was mixed table side by Jon, and key lime pie for dessert.

// FOOD //
Stone Crab: They have medium, select, and large sizes when it comes to the crab claws. We decided to go try out the select Stone Crabs. It came with 6 claws for $60. The Stone Crab wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be, but it was really good with the dipping sauce that it gets served with. Tasted like a mustard mayonnaise sauce. 3.5/5

Seared Sea Scallops: Sunchoke puree, pickled shallots. The scallops were large and cooked perfectly in the middle. I wish they had a harder sear on the outside, but it was still a really good scallop. The sunchoke puree was delicious, but the pickled shallots did not go well with the dish at all. It does provide the dish some color, but makes the scallops taste pretty bad so I just put the shallots off to the side. 4/5

BLT Wedge: Crispy pork belly, grape tomatoes, chopped egg, blue cheese, Joe's vinaigrette. I wish I could just order a plate of the cubed crispy pork belly! It was definitely the star of the salad. The rest of the salad was your standard wedge that you can find at many restaurants. 

Overall, I was pretty satisfied with my experience at Joe's Seafood. Typically, when you wait so long to try a restaurant that you've been wanting to try it tends to fall short of your expectations, however, Joe's lived up to my expectations.

The Oysters Rockafella is the best that i ever had and I have had alot over the years.

The wedge salads are delicious and the creamed spinach and corn are top notch. Last night we tried the broccolini and onion strings for the first time which were both great and our waitress clued us in on an off the menu potato dish called the Big Daddy that was a sort of ball of scalloped potatoes deep fried and placed on some sautéed onions and then served with melted cheese, bacon bits, and a dollop of sour cream - sort of a reconstructed and deep fried ""baked"" potato.

King Crab legs were really great. They crack them at the table for you and one order is a lot so I would share between 2 people. Very meaty. It's served cold which was different than what I'm used to, but it was still great. It says market price but it was $79 last night and I couldn't tell you the poundage, but we also ordered scallops, shrimp cocktail and a cup of soup, all to share, and couldn't finish the crab! 
The scallops were very delicate and melt in your mouth yummy. One did have some sand in it, crunch crunch, but I guess that's expected sometimes. 

The lobster bisque was delish! We shared it, it's very rich but yummy. Would be awesome on a rainy day (still good with 115 degrees outside) 

If there has to be a con... The shrimp cocktail was really really good.., but each shrimp is basically $4 each! But fresh, cold and meaty. Haha funny I'm ok spending $80 on crab but not $16 for shrimp. 

Maybe I watch too many Gordon Ramsay shows, but I agree that the tuxedo attire for wait staff is a little funeral home. Our server was super sweet and very great at her job though. A little stuffy overall but elegant.

With all the ridiculous ""National ____ Days"" dedicated to superfluous foods like cheese doodles (March 5th) and stupid specific eats like cherry popsicles (August 26th), it's about time you stepped in and made executive decisions on something that is clearly getting out of hand.  Who the hell is rejoicing over a cheese doodle that isn't still living in their parents basement playing N64?  What if I choose to have a blue flavored popsicle on 8/26?  Will Destiny's Child come out of nowhere and start singing ""No, No, No""? 

October 15th is WIDE OPEN.  It's the officially the first day of Florida stone crab season!  I am sure you have sampled these incredible claws at a fancy dinner or two during your tenure as the leader of the free world.  You cannot deny that they are some of the most delicious crustaceans on the planet!

So in love with these claws I am, here is my proposal:

- 10/15 will be a federal holiday and be known as ""National Stone Crab Day"".  Even for vegetarians.   

- Instead of only celebrating the day with bullshit Facebook posts, I was thinking something more along the lines of New Year's Eve.  There would be fireworks, confetti, and instead of holding a glass of champagne, everyone will have a large crab claw from Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  They will bite in it when the clock strikes midnight.  

- I've already drafted letters to several high standing Nevada officials about closing Las Vegas Boulevard that evening to throw a parade that will end at Joe's at Caesars Palace.  Judging by my persuasive and emotionally charged message, I am confident this will be granted.  

- A live televised east coast party at the original one, Joe's Stone Crab, in Miami hosted by Ryan Seacrest with Pitbull as the musical guest.

- The dip for the crab is almost equally as magnificent and should be considered for its own day.  We could go with the extremely catchy phrase: Happy National ""amazing crab dip sauce from Joe's that is pretty much crack sauce and should accompany every single bite of claw meat"" Day!  


I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Atmosphere was pretty classy. All the servers in suits and bow ties. Fancy.

Service was excellent! Our waiter, I believe his name was Dave, was on point with his description of the menu as if he wrote it himself, attentive, and funny.

Food: 
-Fried calamari - cooked perfectly, batter was amazing. 5/5
-Fried oysters - ^^^ The same. 5/5
-Clam Chower - 5/5 Wish I had more space in my belly.
-Large Stone Crab - They weren't joking about the claw size. Meaty, and sweet 5/5
-Filet Mignon Bone-in - Was kinda charred, and a little dry. 3/5
-Key Lime Pie - This was the best key lime pie I've ever had in my life. I would totally order this again. 5/5+
-1.5lb Alaskan King Crab - Now this was the jewel of my meal. The biggest king crab legs I've ever had the pleasure of shoving in my face hole. 5/5++++

What made my dinning experience a bit better was that we had a party of 8 and when they sat us, they took us to a private room dinning room away from all the ""commoners."" Lol. Honestly, felt like we had a private dinning experience. Super VIP status.

5553388,2014-10-14,31,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"A friend in the bridal/bachelorette group for Angela T's party hardy weekend suggested this classy, upscale restaurant--famed for the Florida Stone Crabs--located near the Forum Shops entrance from the Las Vegas Strip.  Because this party had 17 voracious vixens, reservations were strongly recommended.  Thus the Maid of Honor booked it over a week in advance, but we were strongly advised that ALL guests must be present in order to be seated.

We thus were chaired onto 2 different tables.  The table I intentionally positioned at had the following proper foods fit for the queen/bachelorette & her feminine minions/comrades:

-Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs-
http://instagram.com/p/rGOhtKrX7e/
They'd better be succulent & fresh; otherwise I would've suggested going to those prestigious buffets without hesitation, with precaution of their slightly overly salty condition.  Not to worry (particularly to the PR who may be reading this =P): they were cleanly & lovingly plated to not even crack those sturdy shells ourselves, as I thus reveled at this meatiness, well-balanced sweetness and saltiness--with the zesty touch from the considerately mesh-covered lemon halves & luxurious melted butter.

-Bone-In New York Strip-
Coming in 3 beastly, thick pieces (at 20 ounces each), just the essential salt, pepper, and seasoning brought the medium rare steaks to straightforward TLC & deliciousness.  Must I say even more...

-Lyonnaise Potatoes ($10.95)-
The menu didn't lie about how shareable it was, even for 9 chicas I sat along with.  Decadent with the utmost creaminess and caramelized onions, I became even more elated that they unintentionally left this tasty carb for this potato-phile.  Besides: what I ate was towards the what-you-partake-on-a-Vegas-bachelorette-night.

-Roasted Sweet Corn ($10.95)-
The touch of lime sparked so much bite, savor, and downright ecstasy coming from mine & the girls' faces that another generous order was ensued.  Was it the best I've ever eaten: well in Vegas, oh heck yes.

And we must not forget the...

-Stone Crab Claws-
http://instagram.com/p/q8C4UTLX_8/
If you're completely unfamiliar with this sustainable sustenance, here's what I hope you can imagine.  Oddly meatier and chunkier than the lengthy legs of the king crab or Dungeness crab, at about $7 PER CLAW you're taking into this toothsome and subtly nutty ordeal, complementing with the just the right pinch of zing of their absolutely tolerant horseradish dip.  These too were effortlessly cracked for us to easily scoop up with our forks, whether using the dinner utensil or the fancy toothpick-ish version.

Obviously I wouldn't leave off my take on service: both the host and the server exhibited sheer patience when we were still waiting for a few more lost chicks to arrive.  Additionally our accommodating waitress cheerfully yet calmly helped our table order the right foodstuffs to last throughout the fun night.  The price may still be quite high for the socioeconomically average Millenial, but I expected that especially for presenting great quality.

So make sure you and your partygoers--whatever occasion it is--are prepped up with a luxurious appetite and the most comfortable mode of transaction to spend exquisitely towards their scrumptious Stone Crab claws.  P.S. if you're reading this review at the month of this post, Joe's is serving up their aptly yet benevolently sweet sliced called the Pumpkin Chiffon Pie, which $1 of every slice will proceed to the Susan G Komen (Breast Cancer Research) Southern Nevada.

A good friend of mine treated me to dinner tonight, and I am soo happy that he brought me to Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab... He had been there a few times and it was my very first time here! We had dinner reservations at 10:30 pm and when we got there we were greeted by the host and got seated right away in a very cozy booth.

When the waiter came around he brought us a basket of assorted bread, butter and water. As we looked over the menu we both decided that we were gonna get the Steak Tartare for our appetizer and our main course we both got the 24oz Bone-in Ribeye (medium rare of course), and our sides of sautéed Broccolini, Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Crispy Onion Strings... 

What can I say, EVERYTHING was so damn good!!! I felt like I've died and gone to heaven!!! The ribeye was cooked to perfection and was so juicy and it came with the house salt which had salt, pepper coriander, shallots, and garlic...I think my eyes rolled back when I tasted the first slice I cut! And the sides, boy oh boy my friend and I picked some really good sides... My favorite one was the Crispy Brussel Sprouts... Lastly, dessert! Banana Cream Pie with Foster Sauce... Best decadent Banana Cream Pie I ever had!

5556268,2016-09-02,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"We have been wanting to try this place for years.  Always passing by it on our way to Casa Fuente.  We decided to finally try this place and we weren't all that impressed.  We called to make a reservation, but they said they didn't have any openings til after 9.  They also said that we could try and do a walk-in.  So we headed down there and decided to walk-in.  We were seated immediately.  It is a very nice place and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  We were seated near an area where some guests were waiting for their tables and were pretty much standing next to our table.  Our waitress seemed very nice and informative about the menu.  Service of the bread and meal was pretty good.  The downside was that they were very slow at refilling our water.

I had the Bone-In Rib Eye 24 oz. $59.95.  It was something that I wasn't blown away with.  The steak seemed a little tough and didn't have a lot of flavor.  It also had a big chunk of fat on it.  I don't mind some fat on my steak, but this was a pretty big piece.  I would think a place of this quality wouldn't have served something like that.  

My cousin had the Stone Crab and he wasn't impressed with that either.  He felt it was lacking flavor as well.

We also had some mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach.  We weren't fans of this either.

I've never had stone crab claws in my life, so I was quite interested to see what it was all about. It is already cracked by the server, so you don't have to do any work besides dipping it in butter or mustard sauce or your own concoction of lemon juice with salt and pepper. I really liked the mustard sauce, but my friends weren't fans. The stone crab claws come in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large. It is best to order the large claws so that you get more meat. We also ordered the Alaskan king crab legs here, and they are super YUMMY!!! I actually preferred that over the stone crab claws to be honest. It is so meaty and so delicious! Ah, I actually want some as I'm typing this! I tried the stone crab claw bisque which was too creamy for my taste. We also ordered the oysters which were pretty fresh as well.

For my entrée, I had the medium stone crab - 7 per order.  The crab is served cold and cracked for you already.  It was fresh and flavorful, but I wished it was served hot - I prefer my crab served hot.  I ate about five pieces of crab and gave two to my hubby.  My hubby had the rib eye 16 oz. steak with a baked potato and we shared a side of skillet fried corn.  He loved his steak - it was flavorful, tender and juicy. We both enjoyed the skillet fried corn - it was so sweet and seasoned perfectly.

I requested a nice quiet table/booth and that's what we got. I have to thank Sarina V, Samantha L and other Yelpers that have reviewed Joe's because their reviews gave me really good insight on what to order and what to expect. And one of the better tips is to valet at the Forum Shops right outside Joe's doors. Thankfully I was familiar with this valet as I always use it when i'm in town. Shortest walk. Ever.

Bread basket has a great variety ranging from cheese bread to sourdough and a cheese cracker. Butter isnt even needed but provided. The service was excellent. Our waiter Patrick was very helpful and informative. He helped steer us in ordering the makings of a great dinner. Your water will be refilled if you take 2 sips, literally. They are on it like no one's business. We had the 1/2 dozen kumamotos ($16.95), choice selection of stone crab (6 pieces; $49.95), I had the 24oz bone-in rib eye and she had the chilean sea bass in a miso glaze ($42.95). Ours sides during the main course were crispy onion strings ($8.95) and asparagus ($10.95). 

The stone crab was delicious. I have been wanting to try it for a long time now. Thank you to the 305 for this delicacy. So much crab meat in that stone crab claw. It's one of the wonders of the world. Squeeze some lemon and dip in their mustard/mayo sauce. Or not... It's great either way. The kumamoto oysters were just ok. I was expecting them to be better. I would pass on them the next time. My 24 oz bone-in usda prime rib eye ($59.95) was delicious. It had so much flavor and just the right amount of fat. I ordered mine medium and it was perfect. They offer their own steak seasoning and they sure are right that a little goes a long way. It packs a lot of flavor. But it really didnt need it. The rib eye stood out on its own. It was so good. My mouth waters at the thought.

The chilean sea bass was delicious. I had a few bites of it. Great flavor. I loved the miso glaze. I recommend it. It comes with bok choy. And the sides we got were also very good. The fried onion strings and asparagus were a great compliment to our main courses.

A great dinner. Excellent service. Outstanding seafood and steak. Make sure you reserve a table in advance. And please... PLEASE. Dont be that guy in shorts and flip flops. He looked out of place and plain wrong. My opinion. It's not black tie but it's a nice dinner place. Give it the respect it deserves.

Troy was great and recommended that we get our side as half instead of the full since there's only 2 of us sharing. The steak was soft and mouth watering seems like the meat just melts in your mouth. The stone crab is fresh because you can taste the sweet meat. And their sides so yummy. For our desert we had the key lime pie and the Havana dream pie. We liked the Havana better.

We eat at Joe's about once a month, and their food and service have always been outstanding.  For that matter, the food on this last visit was as good as ever and our server was excellent.

Here is what happened.  We were enjoying lunch in the terrace area.  After about an hour, the matre' d came over and asked us to move to the bar, and finish our conversation there, as someone was waiting for the table.  I can honestly say, I have never had anything like this happen to me before, let alone at such an upscale restaurant as this, and after only an hour!   We had salad and lunch, we were not simply sitting enjoying waters and taking up a table.

To his credit, the matre' d did say something to the manager, who came over, and was very apologetic.  The problem was, while she said she was sorry, and he should have never asked us to move, in the next breath she told us we were not the first people that they have asked this of, so obviously he is instructed to do this.  Now, had we ordered next to nothing, had we been there an inordinately long amount of time, been acting inappropriately, or dressed that way, I would understand.  We found this totally unacceptable. 

While I love the food, this type of arrogance is not something I am interested in supporting.  No restaurant is this good, in my mind,  Vegas is full of wonderful restaurants.

The waiter John was very friendly and made several good entree suggestions. I chose the surf and turf - filet mignon and lobster tail. Unfortunately as soon as I cut into the steak I knew it was cooked medium to almost well done rather than medium-rare as I requested. I showed it to John who took it back and within 5 minutes returned with another filet that was perfect. It actually turned out to be one of the most juicy and flavorful steaks I've had in years. The lobster was also tasty but not very hot. The potato was flaky and very very hot which was great because I like to load it up with plenty of butter and sour cream To make up for the first steak, John offered a free dessert and cappuccino which were both excellent.

Granted, this is Vegas.

The food and service were both fantastic! I had never had stone crab before but I have had other people rave to me about it so we tried some as an appetizer with some king crab as well. The stone crab definitely was good, but it was WAY too much work for me and honestly I liked the king crab better. Just a personal preference I guess.

For my entree I had the Filet Mignon and a baked potato. Usually you get separate butter, sour cream and chives with your potato, but they have it all mixed together. I was skeptical when it first arrived, but it was absolutely awesome. We also got the roasted corn for the table. I had never had that before and it was amazing, I couldn't get enough! The filet was also melt in your mouth awesome!

Add a slice of banana cream pie for dessert, which was also incredible, and I was stuffed! I ate at 3 high end restaurants (and 3 medium level spots) during this trip to Vegas, and Joe's was hands down the best!

The wine. When your server recommends starting with a bottle of wine, he's not trying to call you lush. He just knows what's best. The wine selection is vast. We split a bottle of some kind of merlot. I am not a wine person and I cannot quite remember what it was called, but I do remember what the label looked like. Point being: the bottle was worth it. Especially since we were at a different restaurant the night before we ended up getting two glasses each and it cost more than the price of that fine bottle.

The food. I had the oscar-style filet mignon and he had the rib-eye. Mine was so good, he did not get to taste the magical surf and turf on my plate. But, I snuck a taste of the rib-eye and almost cried. I couldn't believe it. It was so yummy. We split the ginormous baked-potato for a side and the peanut butter pie for dessert. The pie was like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup on steroids with whipped cream. ::drool::

The restaurant itself was like eating at your rich friend's mansion's dining room except with a bunch of strangers. The lighting was dim, but inviting.

STOP! Beware the next comment may cause the reader to salivate

is exactly how I felt as I bit into my absolutely sinfully delectable and succulent Chilean Sea Bass with Miso ...(*mouth starts salivating).. glaze.. 

It's white mass was cooked to perfection. Presented center stage next to a neatly dressed soy-teriyaki bok choy reduction on a decadent flawless white serving plate, it is visually stunning.  The Miso glaze crust was flaky and crispy (almost lightly fried), but as you bit into the actual sea creature's flesh it starts to part into two as your teeth bite into it. The steamy, juicy flesh meat rushes to your taste buds and you totally fall in love it. It is soft, the texture akin'd to a firmer softened butter with a clean taste absent of any overpowering fishiness inexperienced restaurants suffer from. Oh no, this fish was absolutely PERFECT! This experience, which I've only had once, was only at this Joe's Seafood Restaurant!

If I had a final meal on this planet, It'd be the entire menu at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab Restaurant! Bar none!

You cannot go wrong with anything you order here, but DO NOT FORGET TO TRY THE SEABASS if you're a fish eater!

As expected for a restaurant of such reputation, the decor and staff is without a doubt FLAWLESS! Expect to tip the Matrie D' to take you seriously and receive a seat... otherwise wait for an obscene amount of time watching other people eat. They only take reservations for 8 or more.

Excellent, attentive service. 5 star experience in that regard. Stick to the crab if you're going here. Something tells me they aren't buying or aging the steaks the same way as when it first opened. Not nearly a hot ticket anymore, reservation and walk up were a snap even during a busy holiday weekend. The trendy and the famous have found other grounds I suppose. 

Recommended for the crab.
Skip the beef.
Sophisticated wine list. Decent beer selection. Superb ice-box key lime pie.
Vegas-Dressy. You'll feel out of place with out at least putting on a collar shirt and jeans. Very dressy will also feel comfortable here. 

In the Forum Shops, a bit tricky to find if you're coming from Caesars, so worth looking touristy and consulting one of those map ""you are here"" displays.",IKdub0kHXhCS_5EG84ivuw,2,1,3,hYh8rusWc3w8YWhVTKQ40w

5736849,2014-09-30,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"It's times like these when I truly enjoy writing a deserved review on a restaurant. We had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but I really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to Vegas.

My first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! Located in the Forum Shopping mall at Caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic American bar and restaurant. We were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. We were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter ITodd) who took very good care of us. Both the host and Todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.

In less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. Todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  Everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. As an appetizer we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.... and OMG,...they were absolutely delicious! I can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best I have ever tasted! Next, how could we have come to Joe's without trying their 5-piece signature Stone Crabs Claws. Also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! Already cracked, Todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. And it actually worked!

For our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled Dover Sole, which was de-boned at table side. Simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. For myself, I ordered the Roasted Black Cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. It was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. The cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....I absolutely loved it.....I thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and I shared everything. For sides, we ordered the Sauteed Broccolini and highly recommended Roasted Swee Corn. Both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. The serving of corn was good, but I think there should have been a bit more Broccolini in the dish.

All this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants I have ever tried! The service was excellent and attentive, and I will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. I will definitely be back when I'm next in town. Oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.

I love this place! :)",miDc8Po6mLqWxyvXIQ4meg,0,0,5,fT-LMqy1A8G4TjIWib4oVQ
5738737,2016-07-08,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Our last night in Vegas, we were walking thru The Forum at Caesars and Yelp reviews led us here. We arrived a bit after 6 p and the seats in the mall areas had a small wait so we opted for a high table in the bar to watch a soccer game that was being shown.

A waiter/busboy came over fairly quickly to offer water and our waitress Cera followed shortly with a basket of assorted breads and butter. I dived right in for the warm cornbread muffin and pretzel roll...yummy! There was also a flatbread crisp, a roll and two slices of raisin bread.

We decided on the skirt steak with shirataki peppers, the mahi tacos and two sides (Cole slaw and a baked sweet potato).

Our entrees & sides arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly, great seasoning and very tender. The peppers were very good but my hubby doesn't really like peppers so I had a few but there was too much food to finish them all. My grilled mahi tacos were spot on. Mini taco shells offered just the right amount of carbs balanced with jacama slaw. The Cole slaw was served over sliced tomatoes and had the perfect amount of dressing and seasoning. The baked sweet potatoe was huge, sweet and very tender. Didn't really need the cinnamon butter.

Cera was attentive and stopped by several times to check on us. Our water glasses were never empty, our table was quickly cleared as we finalized. Tab including tip around $87. 5 star experience! Wish we had room for dessert - ample selection of pies!",Vnv4vY5DCQWYaZ4LTwswFw,0,0,5,RymoaRcNEA7ZvPi4V8lUxw
5744117,2013-11-13,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I picked this restaurant specifically for two reasons. One is because I felt this would be a ""people pleaser"" in terms of a solid steakhouse for a larger group. The other because it was a three dollar sign joint. I realize steakhouses can get pricey, so I wanted to find something that wasn't going to break the bank, but still be ""fine dinning."" 

The service is very good, I'll note right away. But please be wary, our server was a totally up-seller. She knew exactly what she was doing.... ""oh, if you're going to get a couple glasses of wine, get a bottle"" or ""what appetizers can I start you with"" almost as soon as we sat down. I kinda feel like they're probably all trained that way. Not necessarily annoying, but be wary!

Also, the food is all a la carte. So you'll get up there in price with what you order. We had a table of 8 and ordered 4 different sides and they were all gone by the end of dinner. But it was the perfect amount. The good: garlic roasted spinach, the lyonnaise, and my fave grilled tomatoes (wonderfully red tomatoes with pesto and melted mozzarella on top aka YUM!). The okay: broccolini. 

I ordered a special, which was Filet Mignon with crab on top. I really wanted both the filet and crab, and the regular menu listed large pieces of both for much more. This was the perfect amount for $36. Plus asparagus! It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very flavorful. The crab was fantastic and I almost wished there was more. Maybe a bit more, but the portion was good still. 

Best part is they brought the birthday boy, my dad, a free brownie sundae! All in all, a really excellent meal. Ended up being perfect for what I was looking for!",4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg,7,10,4,4nksw9iIyt2JPiNul6kL-g
5746689,2014-01-27,1,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Went here with the hubby on Tuesday night last week, and dinner was wonderful! I am a HUGE seafood lover, and this is probably one of the best seafood places I've had in CA or NV.  The food is fresh and very good, though a bit pricey.

It's located at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace on the bottom/street level.  If you are coming from Caesar's, it'll be in the right wing at the very end.  You'll need to take the escalator down one level.  

I tried to make a reservation the day before on Open Table, but nothing was available for the entire evening for even just 2 people.

So I called to ask what the wait would be for 2 people w/o reservations.  They said they don't like to give estimates on the phone because the wait times can change so quickly.  So I asked them what the average wait time would be overall, and they said anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes.

So we walked over there to do a walk-in to see if they could accommodate.  At first, we got there at 6:45 pm and they told us it would be a 45 min wait.  But seeing there weren't a lot of people waiting around, we walked back up to check in on the wait at 7:05, and they were able to seat us at that time.  So our wait was just 20 minutes.

Since I'm from So Cal, I can get stone crabs pretty easily at the Fisherman's Wharf in Redondo Beach or even at 99 Ranch supermarket.  They are fairly cheap to buy whole (Santa Barbara stone crabs are about $5/lb depending on the season), and the wharf or supermarket will steam them for free for you.  So that's why I didn't get stone crabs at Joe's.  But if you haven't had stone crabs before, you should definitely get them because they are probably one of my favorite types of crab to eat (and I've had all kinds).  They are meaty, easy to break because of the stone-like shell, and have a sweet flavor.  

Half-dozen oysters (1 order):
- I forgot what kind they were, but they were delicious.  Even my husband who isn't a fan of oysters liked these.  I think what really made it good was their fresh tasting vinegar sauce that we used with it.  The oysters were very fresh tasting with no fishy taste.  I could've probably eaten a whole dozen by myself easily.

Fisherman's Platter - Grilled:
- I got this and loved it.  It was a fair amount of food, though not a whole lot.  The server told me ahead of time when I asked how big the plate was that the amount of seafood added up to about 8 oz - the size of fish that they would give you on a fish plate.  With the mashed potato side we got, it was definitely enough food.  My husband tasted the scallops and remarked that they were probably some of the best he's ever had.  The seafood was very fresh, grilled with butter and maybe a bit of parsley and a bit of seasoning.  The shrimp were big and crunchy.  The squid pieces didn't taste rubbery or fishy.  The flavor was overall very good.  I would definitely get this dish again.  

Lobster-stuffed Sole:
My husband got this and loved it.  In fact, I was debating getting this in the beginning, and upon tasting it was kinda wishing that I had.  The sauce was like a hollandaise sauce, but not as heavy.  The fish was very tender and the sauce with the lobster was really good.  

Jennie's Mashed Potatoes:
These were special mashed potatoes that were very good!  They had a crunchy, cheese bread crumb type topping on them that was amazing.  The combination of the mashed potatoes with the crunchy topping was absolutely delicious.  It went perfectly with our meal, and I would definitely get these again.  I don't think I've run into any other place that makes their mashed potatoes like this.  Very good and filling!

Overall, this is a great seafood place.  If there was one of these places in So Cal, I would probably frequent it for most special occasions.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it if you're wanting a nice good meal.  The service was great and the food was great.  The only thing was that we were seated at a table near the bar and there was a HUGE group of like 20 people that came in and were standing around by the bar (and hence our table).  Our poor server had to squeeze by them each time she walked over to us.  So it got pretty loud in there, though we were still able to enjoy our food.",hxFuK5yfhvXTutTF76QtUQ,2,0,5,su1TXHK_4w_gVGOTKI6wmw
5747681,2016-09-11,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Went here after seeing Love next door at the Mirage, we were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary, our waiter didn't ask if we were celebrating anything special, even though we were dressed up, and toasted to our 20 years of marriage. He had a party of 6 sested at the table next to us, and he certainly gave them more attention than he did us, to top it off, he even brought out a dessert with a candle and said "" I know it's not your birthday or any other celebration, but this is for you""!!!!! I guess our check amount wasn't high enough to warrant attentive service, I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone celebrating a special occasion, lucky for us we enjoyed some other amazing meals on our trip. We love Mesa Grill in Ceasars Palace, Cut had amazing food, Spagos was amazing, and all customers were treated equal. I gave this pretentious dining establishment 2 stars because the food was good, and once we asked the female helper for a warm wash cloth and lemon so my husband could clean up after his grilled seafood platter, she showed some care for our table. Our server was Daniel Z and I suggest if you get seated in his section, and you plan on spending $120.00-$150. 00 for dinner for two, ask for a different server that's probably not enough for you to get the expected service one should get from a place like this.",izWYtJhReq5rESjKmt905w,0,0,2,f-hzVAp-hCmgiM3d8kc6AQ
5753061,2010-09-14,4,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Not quite the earth-shattering experience I had a couple years ago, but still a great meal nonetheless. The first thing I can tell you is that the quality of their stone crabs seem to be deteriorating. On the last visit, we had the choice of picking either the large, select, or medium sized claws. This time, we had the choice of either the 7-pc medium sized claws or this other crab with a fancy name (I forget). I asked the waitress and they said it's pretty much dungeness crab.

If you're familiar with stone crabs, you know that these little suckers are hard to come by, hence the extravagant prices. It takes a while for these crabs to grow just one ""big"" claw, and when they're fully grown, they're immediately harvested, chopped off, and thrown back into the waters. Imagine if you're one of these stone crabs... it must be excruciating. It's like that alien pawn shop dude (who plays Monk) in Men in Black who keeps getting his head blown off throughout the movie. It hurts like a mother, but at least it regenerates, surely albeit slowly.

Anyway, the quality of the stone crab claw didn't seem up to par compared to the last visit. It didn't seem as sweet, as succulent, as tender, as worth the $36 or so for 7 pieces. The mustard-based dipping sauce is a must, and super tasty as usual. Obviously these are defrosted from being previously frozen, but it still had that lingering effect of just recently being thawed out.

My usual bone-in ribeye was excellent, cooked to a perfect medium. Juicy, full of flavor, I licked every inch of the leftover bone. The stuffed mushrooms we had for apps was very good, along with the roasted corn for sides. As a sure sign of fate, they even offered a glass of sparkling wine from Domaine Carneros, where my wife and I went on our first date up in Napa/Sonoma Valley about 9 years ago. 

We finished off with a complimentary dessert with chocolate and ice cream, but I couldn't leave without eating of slice of their key lime pie. The waitress was a bit shocked that we (err, I) had the room for another dessert. But it was well worth the extra few hours of cardio in the gym. Rich, buttery, and tart, the key lime pie was a nice ending to another fantastic meal at Joe's.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,5,4,5,PZCrkVlJjrB1I-muxVOJnw

I'm no seafood expert, but the actual Stone Crab appetizer (it's a bunch of claws!) tastes really great. It tastes... more like crab than regular crab.

Yeah, uh... So like,  regular crab flavor is like calling it a few times over the week until it finally agreed to meet you at a coffee shop and when it did show up, it was dressed in these gnarly sweats but it's wearing nice perfume. Stone Crab immediately shows up to your house in lingerie on speed dial. I mean, you know. If Stone Crab were an attractive woman and you were a heterosexual dude. Oh yeah, and the mustard sauce you dip the Stone Crab in is the lingerie--it's flavorful and not overtly spicy.

I also ordered the Seafood Chop Salad, which I really enjoyed. It has all these colors! I don't know why (you can guess, maybe?) but my salad was covered in a good layer of seafood that I couldn't even finish.

Started out w a great bread basket. We split the veggie chopped salad which was surprisingly good and huge. Stone crab bisque was disappointingly ordinary but I really liked that they brought out the bowl with crab and veggies, then added the bisque tableside. Genius way to make sure everybody gets the same amount of crab. 

We shared the steak sandwich - unexpectedly 3 little sliders vs 1 regular sandwich. Thick slices of tender medium rare steak. Maybe not worth $17 but it was damn good. We also shared the 8oz filet with sides - super fresh tasting charred sweet corn, sauteed broccolini and mac & cheese. Perfect char and seasoning on the steak but sides were just average, I wouldn't say any were really worth the calories or $

To celebrate my successful business trip, I casually sauntered over to Joe's.  I ate at Joe's back in November during my 1st trip to Vegas and I remember enjoying the surf and turf (sirloin and lobster).  That was a meal that I will remember for as long as I live.  The lobster was fresh and succelent and the steak was probably one of the best I've had.

My 2nd trip was this past weekend and I left pissed off.  I was all hyphy when I entered too......

My wife and I ordered fried oysters as an appetizer. My wife and I do not like oysters, but I thought maybe this would taste like calamari. Well, it was still very briny and tasted too much like oysters lol. If you don't like oysters, don't order this. 

We also ordered the medium sized stone crab and a rib eye with asparagus. The crab was tasty, pre-cracked, and came with some mustard sauce. The crab was meaty and good, but to be honest, it's overpriced for what it is. The rib eye was delicious as expected, but I was weirded out with the asparagus. The stalks appeared to be shaved down, so it looks like some weird white root. It didn't taste bad, but it was just weird to see an asparagus that didn't look like one. 

Also, soda lovers beware, if you order a soft drink, it comes in a small ass bottle like at Mastro's, if you've ever eaten there. If you want refillable drinks, get the lemonade or iced tea.

5832411,2009-02-16,0,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"We have visited JSC at least once every time that we've been to Vegas - always for lunch, always at the bar. We have never made (nor needed) a reservation. The décor is reminiscent of a refined private club, although it is not at all stuffy. There are televisions in the bar, but they are neither loud nor intrusive. Several time we have enjoyed the same bartender, who is just the right combination of friendly and professional.

I can see that dinner might be pricey, but lunch is reasonable, likely because we usually order two appetizers each, or a sandwich and an appetizer. My favourite is the ""Second Mortgage"", which includes stone crab, jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail and shrimp and scallop ceviche served cracked on ice. It was approximately sixteen dollars on our last trip. 

As I have allergies and cannot eat the ceviche, they always put on the side for my dining companion. Allergy alert: I always explain it in detail, and they always get it right. Recognizing that we might share, when his food comes out,  they point out what I cannot have from his plate, unsolicited. Those of you with allergies will recognize these as two signs of a good restaurant. They will provide you with a lovely bread basket on request.

We had a dozen of the oysters, their world-famous scallops, the shrimp and scallop ceviche and of course the stone crabs.  

The oysters were smaller than the ones that I am used to eating.  But these oysters tasted a whole lot better.  It came with a cocktail sauce and another one that looked like italian dressing.  Just eat it without the sauce.  It's that good.  Their world famous scallops were very good.  Very sweet and buttery.  Nice texture to them also.  Get them.  The ceviche was alright.  A little to acidic for my taste.  I don't think I would order that again.  Now onto the reason we came here, the stone crabs.  We got the Select stone crabs.  6 to an order.  Our server said the different types were just the size of the claws, not the taste.  She said all the orders usually come out to a pound.  Might as well get the bigger claws which make it easier to get the meat and eat.  It came with Joes mustard sauce but I just squeezed some lemon juice on them and it was perfect.  Winner!

5838045,2018-01-15,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I introduced my son, Ben, to Joe's while he was here for an adult-league soccer tournament, and we and Diane all came away from the 2-hour experience happy diners.  In the distant past, I found the Florida Stone Crab Claws to not be that tasty or worth the work of searching through torn shells to scoop out the meat.  But we were in a stone-crab place, so introducing my son to stone crab claws seemed appropriate.  To make sure that we would have a pleasing appetizer course, I hedged by also ordering a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which I knew would be good.  This time the stone crab meat was an eye-opening experience.  I opted for the large claw variety, one for each of us, and wished I had ordered more as my son and I delighted in the sweet, fresh taste of our crab meat, while Diane did not.  I sampled her claw meat, which was light brown in color and not very tasty, while mine was snow white and delicious.  So, I now know that Stone Crab claws can vary in taste.  And, one is not enough.  But at over $13 a large claw, this is not for those with a low dining out budget!  The Shrimp Cocktail was fine and meaty, as expected.

A bowl of Crab Bisque was up next.  Very good with bits of crunchy garnish, but warm rather than hot.  I appreciated the pitted Black Olives in Joe's Chopped Salad, and liked the Feta Cheese-laced creation, but missed the prosciutto, pancetta, or ham commonly found in Chopped Salads served in Italian restaurants, which I realize Joe's is not.  So, next time I will revert to ordering a Caesar Salad here.  

With all of the Surf & Turf combinations I had recently enjoyed on a cruise around South Africa and during the December holidays just past, I took an unusual detour, and swiveled instead to Chopped Steak for my entree, which is prime grade beef, ordered medium.  I should have ordered it medium-rare, because it arrived medium-well.  Yet showered with a carafe of brown au jus, the meaty dish was still quite tasty.  My son loved his Dover Sole, which was deboned tableside (but for 1 small bone), slathered with Buerre Blanc, and an absolutely huge double-sided fish fillet.  And Diane greatly enjoyed her medium-rare filet dipped in Bearnaise Sauce and 10 oz. Lobster Tail dunked in Drawn Butter.  Our server thought that we had ordered enough potato already before I added French Fries to orders of Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes and a Baked Sweet Potato adorned with of all things (Wait for this!) sweet and memorable Praline Pecan Butter.  But crispy Fries just go too well with Chopped Steak to forego.  And, after my son enjoyed a Caesar Salad, we rounded out these sides with tasty Roasted Cauliflower graced by Sage Brown Butter, and a dish of impeccably prepared Sauteed Spinach.  The huge order of slightly crunchy Hash Browns was superior in every sense, and the skin-on Fries fresh and a perfect mate to my Chopped Steak.  The delectable Baked Sweet Potato was just a delightful bonus!  

After almost breaking the bank and the calorie count for a table of three, it made no sense not to order dessert.  So our trio split a large slice of Chocolate Fudge Pie topped by clearly homemade Whipped Cream.  Decadent and delicious, and enough for three to share!

Service by our head waiter and his assistant, formally clad in the customary Chi-Town black tux style, was impeccable, and our head waiter very patiently helped me add the Lettuce Entertain You app to my mobile phone, and noticed that my email address was not initially accepted because an undesired space lurked between letters.  Once the technical error was corrected, reward points were quickly awarded and a $20 future dining credit appeared.

This was as close to a 5-star dining experience as one could get without quite getting there.  Hot soup and even a medium Chopped Steak would have vaulted us over that bar.  So, 4-1/2 stars overall, and I will surely be back to order more Large Florida Stone Crab Claws and to afford Joe's another shot at providing me with a 5-star experience.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,3,4,qPE_MdQLMLH0FxNpWqTh9Q

I was here with 4 other colleagues of mine. We started off with some drinks and a 15 oyster platter. We got 3 different types of oysters and each one tasted absolutely amazing. Hands down those were by far the freshest, tastiest oysters I have ever had. Adding a hint of lemon juice just had to put it over the top. We had the steak tartare and that was pretty good. 

Up next were 15 medium sized stone crab claws. I saw this on the menu ""Fresh stone crabs are found in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They are hand-harvested, one claw at a time, and thrown back to the sea."" and had to jump on it. When they came out, we started cracking. The table went silent and then was followed by ""mmms"" and ""ahhhhs"". I was in seafood heaven.

After that, we had the Alaskan king crab legs. We were told by the waitress that these legs are most fresh during these few weeks. Guess what? It was that time of the year.  We had a total of 2 orders and each bite was indescribable. Okay... let me describe it to you. They come pre-cracked. As you pull the flesh off of the shell, you dip the chilled crab meat into a small butter dish. Give it a few seconds for the butter to soak onto the surface of the crab meat. Take a bit and you'll find yourself in seafood heaven yet again. I died and was reincarnated at least 3 times that night. 

The bill came out to around $600 with gratuity included. It was well worth it because one of our managers comped the meal for us! Sometimes you do get lucky in Vegas.",TrOonlMB34j-XFQHKZ4dvQ,2,0,5,xQlfCL7oYxeQjlhztXJT1w

The King crab legs which were enormous, and cut for you so you only need a fork for them.  Head and shoulders above the stuff you see on buffets.

Chilean Sea Bass was fork tender, excellently prepared.

Scallops are frickin awesome.  I've had both the Joes and the bacon wrapped, both are good but I prefer the Joes since scallops are easily overpowered by something as flavorful as bacon.  Portions on these are generous, one of the better deals on the menu.

It was Monday night and wasn't sure what we wanted to eat so after doing some Yelp searching, the hubby decided to go to Joe's. The hubby have been to the one in Miami and raved about the stone crab and the key lime for over a year now and knew this is the time for me to try it. Once you sit down, a basket of variety of bread comes to the table, even though it is not the warm kind, it is still tasty. I started out with a cup of stone crab bisque which is nothing too special. It tasted like the crab and asparagus soup my hubby made. Then we ate an order of the 7 medium stone crab and each bite was so deccadent. My main entree was the Fisherman's Platter which consist of prawns, scallop, calamari, and fish; you have a choice for fried or broiled and because I am on a healthy kick, I opted for the broiled. My hubby order the bone-in rib eye and he claims it is the best steak he had. It was cooked just right (medium well). I had a couple of bites, and the meat was so tender and it melted in my mouth just right with all its own juices (salavating while writing this). At the end, of course, we had to have the key lime pie and according to the hubby, it was the saem goodness back in Miami. Our tummies were definitely fulfilled and what a great way to end our Vegas trip.
This is definitely a place to go for a special occassion while in Vegas or if you have some money to spend because it is not cheap.

I was able to get reservations for us on Saturday at 6PM just the day before. You do have to sign a contract, as well as provide a credit card to reserve tables for a group this large, and you will be charged a fee if you no-show your reservations. I was glad they were able to accommodate us on short notice.

The service by our primary server was decent. His ancillary team was always around so our 2 large tables was always able to request what they needed. I took off a star because the woman who brought our wines (we got 3 bottles) did not even give us an opportunity to taste/smell them prior to being served. I told our primary server that we wanted a big buttery white wine, and naturally he suggested an expensive bottle from France, unfortunately it was more sweet, and not buttery or oaky at all.

The food was hit and miss. I would avoid the Lyonnaise potatoes, and most of the sides were just okay. We had the fried asparagus, creamed spinach, Jennie's mashed potatoes, and grilled corn. The seafood tower was good, filet was meh, get the bone-in ribeye if you want meat.

Overall, it was a good dinner, but I think our group would have enjoyed eating at Bacchanal more, and it would have cost the same if not less. You also do not accrue any Total Rewards credits here, nor can you use city-wide dining credits, it's one of only three on the Caesars property that do not participate in Total Rewards, bummer.",pDgltzFYFtCYQAYR-kr_yA,6,3,3,ZYSnp9ShWnaihsah5taXhQ

I have been two times, and haven't strayed beyond the crab, fried green tomatoes, and more crab.  Maybe I had a soup on my first visit, but if I did it was a mistake as it took up room better used on crab!

My first visit featured stone crab, my second was rock crab I think, whatever- I'm not sure I know the difference, and both were simply amazing portions of robust claws.  Most recently my 5 claw portion was so hefty I struggled to knock the $50ish entree out.  These weren't grimy crab dishes where you are doing lots of work on small obscure parts of the crab's back, hip, or spindly legs, etc- but instead these are BIG picture-perfect claws (only), pre-cracked, and filled with delicious meat.

An absolute must here is the crab claws. ABSOLUTE! We did two orders of the medium claws (7 claws per order at $39 an order). Tasty crab claws itself, the flavor is put over the top when you pair it with their special sauce. 

We tried 3 sides amongst the 7 of us to pair with our entrees and still had leftovers. The side portions are pretty big.

Sides:
Lyonnaise potatoes: perfect crisp on the outside & great flavor with the onions in the middle
Creamed Spinach: not noteworthy but decent
Sauteed Corn: probably the favorite of the sides. The flavor was really good. I would order this again

I can't speak on behalf of the other girls' entrees as I didn't try it but the restaurant was kind enough to split any entrees to two plates before it was served to us if anyone was sharing. This made things run a lot smoother & it was much appreciated. 

I split the scallops with a friend as my entree and it was definitely enough for the both of us to be full.

5957075,2014-01-17,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"Dinner at Joe's was half tasty.
We got to Joe's without a reservation at 6:30. The host told us it would be 30 minutes, but actually had a table for us in 10 minutes. The problem however was that our table was in the over crowded bar and not in the restaurant in the back. We literally had a group of guys leaning on our table for about 10 minutes during our meal. The atmosphere was abhorrent. 
The only thing worse than the atmosphere was the service. Our waitress seemed grumpy and unhappy. We ran out of butter for our pre dinner bread, our food took forever to come out and when we were done our meal we waited for lemon water or hot towels, but ended up going got the bathroom to wash our hands. The hot towels arrived approximately 5 minutes after we were done eating. When I am done eating crab I don't want to wait 5 minutes to wipe my hands down. In my opinion the hot towels in a high end steak and seafood joint should be brought out 5 minutes before you are done, not after.
The meal itself was ok. The only thing I would get again was the medium stone crab. We got some of the large and medium, there wasn't much difference in size, and they tasted the same. I think you get more meat for less money with the medium. The mustard sauce they are served with is really good. We ordered fries and onion rings to go with them, the fries were decent, but nothing to write home about. The saddest onion rings in the world are onion straws, and that is what we got. I wanted a solid steakhouse onion ring and instead I got an over salted mess of greasy thin cut onions.
Overall Joes gets a pass from me, but if I was to go back I would have a reservation for the restaurant and I would take a pass on half of what I ordered.",zxuxd6Hz2tKcpgZ71dYEcw,1,1,3,mG6DlyhR6K-laCyMSfU3yw

Now that I have said that, I can tell you about the food.

For lunch, I ordered the stone crab special (of course), which came with 5 stone crabs, hashed brown potatoes. coleslaw and key lime pie for dessert.  

The stone crabs were served with a special mustard sauce.  I am not normally a fan of mustard, but it was yummy.  I love shellfish with just a squeeze of lemon, so I opted to eat it that way.  The stone crab was quite good.  It wasn't the best I have had, but it was still delicious.  

The hashed browns were terrific, but I am always fond of potatoes.  

The coleslaw was... interesting.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.  The best part about it was the sliced tomato garnish.  Enough said.

The key lime pie tasted like it was previously frozen, as it was QUITE cold.  That said, it was phenomenal.  I have had key lime pie in Key West and this rivaled the best Key West key lime pie.  There was no weird green dye in this pie, as you often see in ""fakes.""

Joe's is located in my favorite mall, The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They are, coincidentally, a stone's throw away from Agent Provocateur (a must-stop for any lingerie collector such as myself).  Of course, I didn't pop into AP with my lunch date... but that will be revealed in another review altogether.  :)

Would I come here again?  Certainly.  

TIP: Make reservations, even for lunch.  We arrived slightly tardy for our 11:30 lunch date, but a table was held for us.  Even though there were several open tables, those who approached the maitre d'  without a reservation were only given the option of bar seating (a few high tops).",_jjbwHWLFA5GjWFWGLj4ZQ,7,7,5,P0XWWibnsGb81mGEQGaILg

I ordered the filet mignon with lobster tail and a side of mashed potatoes, while my husband ordered a chicken dish and a side of some asparagus. 

I've never really ever craved steaks before, but now that I'm pregnant, I wanted to try it. Let me just say, coming here to have filet mignon & lobster tail for the first time was SO WORTH IT! The lobster tail was so tender dipped into the delicious buttery drawn butter. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked mid-well. Hubby's chicken dish was superb! Perfectly baked and so juicy. We finished everything. I do feel like the price can be slightly cheaper. We'll for sure come back for the lobster tails.",8mRf33g_PEcYNXCfvcq-lg,0,0,5,j3YF6fB3dTV-hJ2Ne8_uEg

Servers are attentive and have a sense of humor which is nice, especially in a restaurant that could be too ""stuffy"" if it wanted to be. The jumbo crab legs are to die for (I combine their mustard sauce and butter for dipping, try it!), the shrimp cocktail contains some of the biggest and best I have ever had, and the corn side dish is a must. I don't even really like corn, but will still find myself craving Joe's sweet corn like I'm pregnant or something!!

5973632,2013-07-10,2,I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw,"I don't think I can eat another Alaskan King Crab Leg unless it is on par with Joe's quality. Seriously, my husband and I had dinner here 2 weeks ago and we are STILL talking about the amazing crab meat. 

My husband started with the Crab Bisque and it was the best Crab Bisque we have ever had.  There were beautiful chunks of crab nestled at the bottom of the bowl as our waiter poured the rich and decadent soup over it.  I started with a half dozen of Oysters on the had shell and it tasted fresh and perfectly briny with a clean finish.  
We also shared the Chopped Salad. It's not your average chopped salad- it is packed full of a variety of fresh veggies and topped with a delicious vinaigrette.  I could have eaten these starters alone and be happy with my meal.  

But, then the jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs came to the table.  It was beautiful. It was a bit pricey at $79 but my husband and I were practically moaning after every sweet bite.  And it was huge and so much crab meat. So. Much. I don't think every strip  buffet's crab legs combined can even match the amount that was in the crab we were served.  It was first presented on a beautiful platter and then perfectly cracked open by our server, leaving us perfect thick sweet whole portions of crab meat.  Dip it in some warm clarified butter and you will be speechless.  Speech. Less. 

We also ordered the last order of the ""Select"" Stone Crabs.  Just because it is in its name, doesn't necessarily mean they will have stone crabs available.  I guess this year's catch has been historically low so we were lucky to get the last batch.  There are also Medium and Large Stone Crabs offered.  The ""Select: is the size in between.  These are my husband's favorite. Personally, I thought they were OK.  It has a much more mild flavor.  I'll take the Alaskan King Crab over them any day. 

We then finished our meal with the famous Key Lime Pie.  Key Lime Pie is usually the last thing I would consider when I have other pies to choose from, but since this is something they are known for- we had to try it.  And I am so glad we did- it was delicious! It is so popular that you can find the recipe on line- or better yet you can order it from the original Miami, FL location and have it shipped to right to you.  

We were extremely happy with our meal from start to finish.  The service was attentive and friendly.  Although the waiters are formally dressed in their black and whites, it is such a comfortable atmosphere while still classy.  Now excuse me, as I reminisce about those decadently delicious crab legs and save my pennies so I can return.  Because it is worth it.  Oh so worth it!

Both were delicious but the king crab won. For my main dish I enjoyed the Dover sole with brown butter sauce which comes to your table whole and the waiter then de-bones it right in front of you then pours on the butter sauce. I couldn't finish it all as the portion was huge and very rich but still mighty tasty. Our sides included green beans which were seasoned to perfection and onion strings which were light and crispy!
