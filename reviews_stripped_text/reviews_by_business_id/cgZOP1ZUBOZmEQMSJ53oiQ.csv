We've been to the new Trattoria a half dozen times since they opened and the food continues to be outstanding.  The service however has been anything but outstanding! Lino (Leno) whichever, is the worst server we have ever encountered.  If he has a table of 6 or more and you get seated in his section, goodluck!! He takes care of his large party and you can only hope that another server will step in and offer to take care of you or you will be without service!! This has happened on every visit to the Trattoria, although this past Saturday when it happened we were pleasantly surprised when Kenny stepped in to take care of us and did a fantastic job, and he is a new employee!! He makes Lino look like an amateur, and his personality is much more pleasant than Lino!!  All future visits to the Trattoria will come with a HUGE request NOT to get Lino as our server!! He is definitely not an asset to this new location! Hopefully this will be addressed before it hurts the business!!",H7PPFgPli5bxcO8VG1j5Og,0,0,3,wd6xrh0pOT2_Zht_fMEXRA

Besides cooking he takes the time to listen to his customers. His food is excellent with layers of flavors. My husband described to him the sauce his Italian grandmother made for her gnocchi. He recreated a similar dish with a fusion of his oxtail dish & gnocchi dish. It was outstanding. The pasta fagioli was rich in flavor and the eggplant parm was light & tasty.,97paYSs7_kkjvMHl2DG--g,0,0,5,Gwl3wyJe38dMhTs5lsQgrQ

Friends invited us for dinner.  They're loyal supporters.  Must say in addition to the outstanding Italian food I enjoyed the casual atmosphere.  This is the best of both worlds.  Be comfortable and enjoy some of the best food ever.  Fantastic pasta and the best chicken piccata.  I've eaten chicken piccata in many restaurants.  This was the most tender and flavorful of any.  That's saying something given the number of Italian restaurants calling Vegas home.  Chef Marc came out to see how we were doing. Very cordial.  They'll make anything on menu to your specification.  Really fresh ingredients.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and happy to accommodate any special requests.  Sometimes it's hard to find good appetizers, salad, bread and entrees.  Usually you'll find one thing you really like and the rest is so-so.  Not here.  Rest assured you'll like everything you order.  Reasonable priced for the quality.

We started with homemade bucatini Cacio e Pepe.  Just delicious.  I followed up with the Veal Chop Tartufo which, as Chef Marc described, was ""exploding with flavor.""  It was absolutely delicious with a mushroom and truffle sauce.  Others had the chicken fra diavolo, shrimp scampi, and escargot,  all of which were deemed fantastic.

I've gone to many Italian restaurants and I don't mind paying for food that's worth it. Unfortunately I must say these prices don't match. This is way over priced for food that was never better than mediocre. My wife had the eggplant Parmesan and it tasted bland and was thick with egg batter. I had the linguine with clams with the red sauce. The clams tasted fresh but it was lacking in flavor. The red sauce was very bland at best.

1042537,2016-07-01,0,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Went for dinner last Sunday. Ambiance is nice. Not fancy but not casual, just somewhere in between. I like the décor and Chef Marc was out chatting it up with the patrons. The host was super friendly. Our server was nice and had a lot to remember (at least 5 specials which all sounded good.).

The bread to start was fine. But this killed it for me: at a spot like this, please served fresh butter. Not the margarine in the plastic mold where you peel back the plastic and dig your butter knife in. Honestly, even the BF was surprised at this. I will say the wine our was on the heavy side (bonus!). 

We started with a Caesar salad. It was fine but not what I expected from Chef Marc having been to Parma and Mezzo Bistro in the past. Dressing lacked a discernible anchovy taste to the point where I can't even say for sure there were anchovy's in the dressing. To me, a Caesar dressing without anchovy is not a Caeser. 

I ordered the clam linguini. It was just okay. The dish could have used more salt and sauce. The pasta was kind of clumping together so I think sauce would have helped. 

The BF ordered one of the specials, steak with hot peppers. There's a chicken dish on the menu with this preparation but the steak was one of the specials. It was DELICIOUS. The pasta was perfect, steak was good, but the sauce, oh the sauce, it was freaking fantastic! We asked for more bread so we could sop off the sauce. (The second offering of bread was about quarter the size of the first.)

Overall, it was an okay meal. We will definitely go back because having been to Chef Marc's previous restaurants, I know there is potential here. Next time though, I'll order one of the specials.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,1,0,3,l7Rg1W6ZdpNbvbMmaf5jSg

We also shared the charred octopus and bone marrow scratched-made fusilli pasta, albeit it was not a original recipe (I believe the original creator of this dish is from Michael White's New York's Marea Italian restaurant), but it was tastiest and most stupendous pasta I've ever had! For my main entree, I ordered the traditional organic chicken Francese, and my husband ordered the Grouper special, both dishes were delicious! 

Chef Marc came over to our table and chatted with us, and what an animated and amicable character he was.

In my opinion the noodles are where this place stands out. They are homemade, perfectly al dente and just the right thickness (lamb ragu was served over pappardelle). The ragu (bolognese) was creamy, but not too rich, and had a very nice depth of smoky flavor to it. 

I wanted to deduct a star because the service was amiss at times - it seems they rotate all duties between the staff. This led to things like not receiving a spoon with our soups and having to wait to receive parmesan for my lamb ragu. But I didn't because the food was too good, the atmosphere too inviting and the waitstaff too friendly.

Will be back soon. Thanks Marc!",9bSWLAsM_ErYpRFeWxSz4g,2,0,5,WIrW2iq3INLHOfhVaSKIrw
1420425,2016-05-04,10,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Chef Marc has been the go-to guy for great off-Strip Italian. His previous endeavor, Parma, was a favorite of mine for lunch and now his great pasta dishes are back for dinner at Trattoria. 

PORTABELLA APPETIZER: This is a must-get dish. Spinach and mushrooms in a creamy, cheesy sauce. What's not to love?! It's an indulgent start to your meal or potentially a vegetarian entree.
MUSSELS IN FARRO: fresh-shelled mussels in farro with beans, decently made with a garlicky broth, no different than other mussels apps elsewhere but good.
PAPPARDELLE WITH ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: Add the proscuitto for $4 to make this better. The ribbons of fresh pasta are wonderfully delicate and have perfect cook and texture. Sauce is light and buttery, the cruciferous vegetable and fatty ham work well together.
FEGATINI DE POLLO: Think comforting spaghetti dish, but with chicken liver and a mushroom sauce, plus green beans and speck. It's hard to picture but was our favorite dish on our first visit.
RUM CAKE: Light and moist with a frosted edge and fresh berries. The description provided by our server was a bit vague but this was a great pick over the usual (but well-executed) tiramisu or creme brulee. 

The food is awesome. Worth waiting for, but better if you make a reservation. Prices are great for the quality and portions. As others have said, they could use an extra server at times, but Marc himself checks in on diners and ensures that things go smoothly.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,15,4,Q9CGNYYaiUM_jvzpSLOYbA

For starters, my wife and I shared a Caesar salad and a dish of escargot.  Both dishes were excellent, and the Caesar, made with a classic house dressing made using organic egg yolk & crushed anchovies were the best I've enjoyed in some time.  The escargot, also delicious, was served with a garlic butter & white wine sauce with just the right touch of lemon, and with a side of mini-toasts.

For our main courses we enjoyed (and shared, they were soooo good) Chef Marc's Linguini Nero, which is a delicious concoction of black linguini, Rhode Island calamari, wild shrimp, hot chili peppers and a light Pomodoro that brought out the flavors.  Our second entree was one of the specials of the evening - a New York Strip - cooked to perfection.  I have eaten a lot of steak in many excellent restaurants, but I have to tell you, and I mean this with all seriousness, this was the best steak I have EVER eaten.

Finally, to finish the evening, we enjoyed Chef Marc's Rum Cake with espressos, and yes, they were delicious as well.  The Rum Cake was just the right amount of moist and sweet and with a nice frosted edge. 

Overall we just loved the food, and Chef Marc was a pleasure to speak with and very outgoing.  He did a great job of explaining plates and took the time to stop at each table to greet his guests.

We started with the roasted beer salad, it was an average beer salad big chunks of beets, perfect sharing size. We ordered the chicken piccata which came out thin and perfectly cooked. I loved that it was all chicken and didn't come out on top of pasta. Our FAVORITE of the night was the Malfiata ""Deconstructed Lasagna"" with short ribs. Not overly rich, but completely decadent.

We took the in-laws there the other night and they were also quite impressed with the food.

Ambiance is fine dining but Chef Marc is very friendly and escapes the kitchen frequently to visit all of his guests.

On our latest visit, I got the Amatriciana pasta and the pasta was fresh and homemade plus it was cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce was flavorful and had a bit of a bite, just enough to not overwhelm the taste buds.

Hubby got the Gnocchi with a pesto sauce and he devoured every bite, except the two gnocchis I barely managed to steal from him. They were fantastic, fresh little pillows of delight.

In-laws got the Lasagna (deconstructed) and Amatriciana, both loved their meals.

Sincerely impressed with the good mix of old school Italian charm and hospitality and modern twist to traditional Italian dishes but always inspired by its roots.   

I couldn't decide on one dish so I did the tasting menu. I loved everything presented in front of me.   The fried zucchini flower with uni just knocked my socks off and my favorite tasting dish of the night.  Unexpected was the the fava bean leaves(salad)...completely unexpected and expanded my horizons in salad greens.  Perfectly seasoned and a nice light dish before the remaining three dishes and dessert (surprise).  The Argentinian Srimp Pasta was well balanced, and the veal was just perfect. 

What is more exciting is really the experimentation and usage of fresh and wholesomely raised ingredients, as well as influence of Asian techniques and ingredients. Forgive me for not using the correct terms but basically Chef Marc is really raising the bar by experimenting.  I love it and I am game for every experimental dish as I love tasting every brilliant bite.

My wife ordered the chopped salad. The eggplant was a large portion. It was pretty good, not great. It came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce. The pasta was cooked al dante, the way I like it and the sauce was very good. My wife chopped salad was really mediocre. You expect a chopped salad in an Italian restaurant to be loaded with goodies. This one was mostly lettuce. It was also a fairly modest sized portion for the $11 price tag. I really wanted to like this restaurant more because the service was so good.

Reservations are a must as they have a base of regulars and deservedly so.  The chef came out on our first visit and spent some time explaining the menu items. Our server was prompt, polite and extremely knowledgeable as well as honest in his explanations.  The wine is fairly priced - about 1 and 1/2 to 2 times what it sells for at Lee's.  Everyone made us feel at ease and very welcome.  

On our second visit, they called me ahead of time to ask if I would mind a different table assignment - very thoughtful.  They also prepared a dish, not on the menu that evening - just for us.  Their menu specials change daily.  We will visit Marc's  on a regular basis.  Plan on around $140 for a couple if you get a nice bottle of wine, entrees, sides and dessert.  Non drinkers, thrifty types can share a main dish and side, drink water and can get out for less than $30 - $35.  But what's the fun in that?

If you're looking for an epicurean experience then I suggest you try Chef Marc's tasting menu paired with wine.  We were overwhelmed by the taste, presentation and ingenious culinarily flair. The Chef's tasting menu is  21st Century modern Italian cooking, you'd expect to eat in an upscale Italian restaurant in Italy. You will not be disappointed!.  Our tasting started with buratta and roasted beets, the freshness of the buratta made it melt in your mouth. The Chef gave us a sampling of sea urchin ""uni"", that was again delicious, if I attempt to describe it I not do it justice, take my word for it is was amazing. After which we had polenta wit house cured pancetta and seared bacon, where do I begin?.  Polenta spot on in texture and taste, pancetta was one of the best I've eaten, my husband would eaten a dish of the bacon! It was that good. Followed by a spicy seafood black squid spaghetti with artichokes, perfection!.  We then were served homemade truffle ravioli in a light sage sauce, the last time I had truffle ravioli was at il Mulino in NYC, it was that good.  Our main course was grouper fish over polenta with a NY strip steak accompanied by zucchini. The fish was smooth like butter and the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare.  My picture does not do the main dish justice, it was delicious. Followed by tiramisu and rum cake. Both deserts were amazing and done right!.  They were not too sweet or too soggy, some restaurants over do the rum or sugar to compensate for the lack of taste and fresh ingredients but not here.
All the bread and pasta is made daily fresh and you can taste the difference.
The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable. Chef Marc visited the table a few times to check in with us and gage our experience.

He ended up seating us there but it didn't leave us with a good first impression.

Onto the food...

Calamari - not good, very little flavor. A little salt in the batter would've made a big improvement. The marinara sauce was good so it made the dish edible, but without it, the calamari would've been tasteless.

Wild Mushroom Ravioli - outstanding! Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a hint of truffle. 

Shrimp Parmesan - not what we were expecting, it's like chicken Parmesan but with shrimp. The shrimp is battered and fried with melted cheese on top.

Gnocchi Bolognese - again, sauce was good but the gnocchi had no flavor. Maybe they ran out of salt in the kitchen?? I asked my husband if he tricked me by taking me to a ""healthy"" restaurant (read: no salt, no flavor). The gnocchi was cooked well, but I was disappointed.

For dinner I ordered shrimp fra diavolo and got to choose how hot I wanted the dish. I have ordered this dish all over the country, and without a doubt, Chef Marc's was the best I ever had. The shrimp were so big, tender and tasty. It felt like they melted in my mouth. The sauce had the perfect amount of spice and the pasta was freshly made that day. 

My husband had the veal dish which he absolutely loved. My mother ordered the rigatoni. She's an extremely picky eater yet loved the dish so much she wants to come back and get it again. Our friend ordered the short rib lasagna. It was devoured!

Throughout our dinner chef Marc stopped by the table to talk to us. He made our dinner experience wonderfully personalized, which made us feel like we were the only table in the room. 

The wait staff worked like a well oiled machine. We never had an empty glass of water or wine, yet it felt like they didn't exist. Incredible delivery! 

Great job, Chef Marc and staff. You're doing everything right. This wasn't just a dinner at a nice restaurant. This was nothing short of a symphony!",ssOoXFDC4ObeQKF2TvHNCw,0,0,5,khqsSfkS9KQ5OsqyYr4mlA

On this trip my wife and I decided it would be a great idea to try a nice local place that would be a truly unique dining experience. After doing some research we found out about Chef Marc's Trattoria located in West Las Vegas. In all my journeys to the city of slots, I had never traveled too far off the strip. Once we got in the taxi we started heading west, and the further we drove the further I wondered if we made the right decision. Once we arrived however, we were met by the friendly greeter who seated us where ever we desired. We immediately felt at home, and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. 
Appetizers:
Charred octopus:  Soft and zesty, served with white bean.
Escargot: Prepared with a magnificent truffle butter garlic over crostini
Eggplant Parmesan (without pasta) nicely layered, traditional. Very authentic.

Main Dish:
Papperdelle Bolognese: Also very traditional. Chef Marc was so nice, he greeted us at our table and spoke with us a few moments. He mentioned that this was the first dish he learned to make and that he learned it Tuscany. It truly felt like a taste of Italy. The pasta is light and buttery, the sauce savory with soft sweet notes of the carrots. The flavors were so harmonious, we didnt want it to end.
Veil Chop  (bone in) served over a creamy risotto. Hands down, the best veil Ive ever had. Very fresh, it fell off the bone. Very well marinated with garlic.

Dessert: Tiramisu: soft and creamy, with a sambuca it was the most proper digestif.

The things I most enjoy about Marc are his genuine passion for Italian/Italian-American cuisine interspersed with his Asian and world travel influences on his menus. He cooks from his soul, and it shows when he talks with love about the food, decor, and his vision for your dining experience. The menu will be a work in progress; I can suggest for sure that the $60 five course ""Chef's Surprise"" tasting menu will be fantastic; he creates inspired cuisine and sources locally when possible. 

So impressed with my dinner last evening that my Parental Units are booking their holiday block party with him, and along with hubby, were already waiting for him to open to have our Vegas post elopement celebration meal. 

Years ago Nelson hosted epic UYEs at Parma, I expect Marc to eclipse the high bar he set for those and the scores of meals shared with family and friends enjoyed over the years. Marc is the real deal, I'm borderline sad I live in AZ now, because I'd be eating here once a week!

** House baked bread is soft and perfect for sopping up the tasty sauces **

*** Mozzarella en Carozza is Italian grilled cheese comfort food ***

I dined here for a birthday. The atmosphere was comforting; not extremely fancy but not casual either. I made a Yelp reservation and the process was great. The staff was very nice and attentive.

Chef Marc graciously greeted every table in the restaurant - you don't get to see the chef that often in other places.

Let's start with appetizers. As previously mentioned - THE PORTOBELLO APP. It was amazingly delicious. The main ingredients were quite simple: portobello mushrooms, cheese, and spinach. It may not sound like much but I promise you, it is!

Frutti Di Mare w/ black pasta: This was good - but not my favorite. It smelt and tasted like the ocean. I absolutely love seafood but it was a little overwhelming for my taste. However, it was jam packed with seafood. & I got a cute fork & little bowl break open my shellfish.

Short Rib Malfatti: Not bad at all - the short ribs and pasta were cooked perfectly. 

To be completely honest, the entrees didn't excite me; but it could be because I was too busy wishing I had more of my portobello appetizer!

Dessert: Creme Brûlée & Berry Sorbet

3173443,2017-07-22,0,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Incredibly disappointing!

Based on all the good reviews, I was hoping for a good-to-great experience, but it ended up being a mediocre-to-bad experience. 

It started off poorly with the hostess saying I could sit at the bar but she held up a finger as she took a phone call. So I waited. After about 30 seconds, when it was clear that it wasn't going to be a quick phone call, I motioned walking to the bar and she just shrugged her shoulders. So I walked over to the bar area and sat down. 

I waited for several moments and nobody came by. Eventually the hostess walked over and said my server would be with me soon. After another minute, a woman walks up and asks if I want water. I say yes and ask if she's my server, and she says no and leaves. Shortly, a guy walks up and asks if I want water. I say I already requested water and ask if he is my server. He says no, pours my water, and walks away. A little bit after that, another guy walks up and asks if I want to order a drink. I ask if he's my server, and he says yes. I ask if I can order food, and he acts surprised and says, ""but you just sat down!"" (I don't know why that matters, since I could already know what I want to order even if I had just sat down.) I explain that I've been waiting for a while and have had plenty of time to look through the menus. 

I had originally wanted to try the tasting menu, but I happened to be in the area during happy hour, so I thought I'd try a few of their happy hour menu items. I ordered the happy hour versions of the Caesar salad, meatball, and ravioli of the day. 

The food came out relatively quickly. The Caesar salad was watery and didn't taste like a Caesar salad at all. There was no flavor. The meatball was good. The ravioli had flavor, but was too salty. 

Getting my check took a while too, as did getting change. I had to ask two different people for the check and three different people whether I was getting my change. 

Factoring in the mediocre food and bad service in light of my expectations given the good Yelp reviews, I don't really have anything positive to say about this restaurant. Which is really too bad, because I was hoping I could find a new favorite Italian restaurant near my home.",V2xcgiGpyiid7p155Y4uKQ,1,0,2,KZgih1Wmq7U84edQCBtfzg
3212103,2016-06-12,11,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Yes, this is as good as it gets off of the strip for service and quality. I'm not going to tell you who I have dined here with because it is none of your business and get real, you are only here to hear about the food. Me, too.

Chef Marc is doing it big at his Trattoria. Fresh pasta, fresh bread, and hand picked ingredients from meat to veggies. When he talks I listen and drool a little. You can see and taste his passion with every dish. Nice touch was having Chef Marc call to confirm my reservations. 

The staff is polished and actually appearing to not hate being at work. At no point in any of my meals did we feel rushed or processed. Our waiters remembered our names and used them throughout the service. The stealth busser quietly removed used wine glasses, plates, crumbs without any sign that she had been there which is how it should be. 

The food: Oh my goodness. Every once in a while I will stumble upon a restaurant that pretty much ruins other restaurants for me. This is one of them. Now, when I crave Italian I cannot think of anywhere else I want to dine besides here. The Bolognese is complex and every chew brings a new welcoming flavor that stimulates my taste buds. The homemade breads are moist and garlicky. The fresh, homemade pasta goes down like BUTTA and doesn't leave you feeling like you just ate a bowl of Elmer's glue. The pancetta is worth every dimple it put on my thigh (shhhh). My latest love is the Limoncello cake. Nothing short of sensational. On all occasions the seafood dishes are a huge hit with the table. I wouldn't know because of my shellfish allergy. See, I am human.

I am not saying if you have traveled all around the world or lived in Italy for 100 years that you will love this place. I'm not saying that because you could still be an uppity prick with no palate. What I am saying is if you enjoy food where every bite is made with love and the seasonings dance in harmony on your tongue and you just LOVE Italian cuisine than RUN to Chef Marc's right now!",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,17,16,5,ZDH7jTr8auAsG6IVFJusew

We have enjoyed his cooking since his restaurant on Lake Mead Blvd. The new trattoria is a comfortable size dining room with a variety of wall photos. We look forward to the outdoor patio as weather permits. 

We were seated  promptly upon entry which was 5 minutes in advance of our reservation. We did request a change of table as the one near the door was drafty when the door opened. 
Service was friendly and timely with water and cocktail orders. Our waiter asked our preference of wines and said he would choose. That was a surprising twist. He returned with a Riesling and Cabernet Sauvigon. Both were to our satisfaction.

Our starter was the Burrata salad. A beautiful and delicious piece of mozzarella, micro greens and sliced cherry tomatoes with balsamic. 

For entries it was the Chicken Piccata and a combination of Chicken and Shrimp Fra Diavolo.
The Chicken Picatta was served with al dente green beans and lemon wine sauce with capers. The 3 large pieces of chicken were tender and juicy.
The Chicken and Shrimp Fra Diavolo consisted of 3 pieces of chicken and 3 large shrimps. An excellent flavor from the light tomato sauce, capers, red and green bell peppers and mushrooms. The chicken and shrimp were perfectly cooked and delicious. 
Both entrees were large enough for a take home second meal.

Although the trattoria does not have a deli like Parma, you can still buy fresh pasta and sauce to take home.

This place has for me the best pasta in Las Vegas so far. Home made pasta, ravioli and gnocchi. 

We had the gnocchi alla Vodka. The sauce is smooth and so delicious. Little creamy but not too much, with just the perfect seasoning. We tried also the spinach and cheese raviolis, so delicate and tasty. The dish of the day was squash ravioli with amaretto cookie crumbled on top of it. If you like to combine sweet and salty that's worth a try. 

I was too full to order dessert especially because to start your dinner they bring you homemade garlic bread and focaccia that you can't help eating even though you know you're having pasta after. But my friends ordered Crème brûlée and Tiramisu and loved it too.

I gave Chef Marc's another chance as I think the last time I tried to come was just an off night. Coming on a Wednesday night at about 6:30 is a totally different vibe. Literally 2 other people in the restaurant so it feels more homey than the bustling of the weekend crowds. 

Once again the food and Chef Marc exceeded expectations. We wanted our pastas extra spicy so Chef Marc added some Carolina Reaper pepper into our sauce. Oh my god it was good. I was still feeling the burn the next day. We asked for it and he delivered. The chicken riggies and the black linguine dishes both tasted delicious or as delicious as our numbed tongues could taste. Throw in some good escargot and pasta fagioli and you got a winner of a meal. 

However, once again the management side of our experiences rubbed us the wrong way. We found out afterwards that there was a Happy Hour while we were there. There was literally nobody there so it's not like they were so busy that they couldn't mention it to us. We could have easily moved to the bar or patio or wherever necessary to experience the Happy Hour if we knew about it. We ordered two wines and appetizers, presumably double priced as compared to the discounted menu. This type of service is very poor, and when directly counter to the great meals and cookery from Chef Marc, it's really weird. I'm not sure if it's the back of house problem or what, but come to Chef Marc's expecting great food locally, that's it. Twice now something has happened that would make me avoid going back to a restaurant. As good as the food is I'm not sure I'll come back here.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,pAl8e9NYMWOOhL6_7BtfNg

The food was excellent, and was real classic Italian, and not watered-down like many places tend to be. The ambience was perfect, the lighting, music (think Sinatra was on when we walked in) and service was all impeccable.

I had the Short Rib Malfatti (because I saw it in a Yelp picture) and it was just as good as I was hoping it'd be.  Tons of short rib, and the pasta was cooked just right.  I inhaled the entire thing even though it was a very dense meal.  My wife had the Wild Shrimp Scampi, but I didn't get to try it because we were fighting, and didn't think it prudent to ask for a bite.  

We had to go catch a show so couldn't stay for dessert, but we'll definitely be back, and with time to spare.

3606187,2015-11-26,1,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Chef Marc Sgrizzi has once again outdone himself. Heartbroken that my beloved Parma had closed (I had a 4x/week habit for a time), I was eager to be one of the first patrons at Chef Marc's new Trattoria. Just entering the restaurant sets the mood. He's turned an overly curtained and tassled Indian venue into an elegant room - sophisticated, welcoming, warm, with the perfect lighting for a romantic date night. The menu has gotten an upgrade, though Chef says he's still deciding what stays and what goes. While you'll find traditional fare - alfredo, manicotti, ravioli - these all feature Marc's fresh made pasta and unrivaled Sunday sauce. He definitely has offerings for the more sophisticated - linguine Nero with squid ink pasta and artichoke hearts with a kick. I tried the linguine and clams and my date went with the veal parmesan which took up the entire plate for about half the price you'd find elsewhere. It was one of these ""there's no way I'm finishing this whole thing"" that turned into ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing, but it was so delicious and now I can't move."" The service is, as expected, amazing, featuring some of the old Parma crew that made dining with them feel like being at home with a (functional) Italian family. 

Chef Marc himself chatted with us a bit about the menu and we were enraptured by his descriptions of how he dreams up and executes each dish. The passion he exudes consumes you and, before I knew it, I was cheering him on as he described each step of his craft. ""Yeah, sauteed chanterelles, then what? Oh yeah, a little white wine and garlic? Fresh pasta? Hell YES."" 

While I'll miss the deli and the little retail store that unfailingly had my obscure Italian ingredients for my pathetically short-falling home cooking, I look forward to how this venture develops.

It would have been better if the pasta had the madera sauce or a garlic butter sauce.

3719654,2016-08-14,1,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Let me start by saying that the best part of my meal was the bread and the salad. I started with the Roasted Beet salad and it was excellent. I then did something wild and crazy. I ordered an entrée that I was not familiar with, Gnocchi Pink Basil. I thought I would be adventurous and try something different. The Gnocchi Pink Basil is described as ""In a Pink Vodka Sauce with Pancetta & English Peas."" I had no idea what Gnocchi or Pancetta was, but I know what Pink Vodka Sauce is. That is what drove me to order this entrée in the first place. My bad. This dish may be seriously on point. However, I did not care for it at all. That's on me and not the entrée. However, the Pink Vodka Sauce in my estimation was not on point and this is where I felt the dish fell flat. My next surprise came when the side of ""Seasonal Roasted Vegetables"" that I ordered came to my table. Their idea of Seasonal Roasted Vegetables came in the form of sautéed Broccolini. Huh? I like greens, but I did not care for this. Next time I will be sure to ask what the Seasonal Roasted Vegetables are before I order. I have to tell you that at this point I am completely confused. I am looking at both items in front of me and I don't care to eat either. And you have to understand, I am like the kid in the commercial, Mikey. Like Mikey, I will eat just about anything. Heck, if I can't eat it I will take it home and try it later. I am not shy about taking leftovers home. Not this time. Unfortunately, our waitress was completely unaware. It was Saturday evening and the store was totally jam up. As a result she wound up in the weeds and had that ""Deer in Headlights"" look. Poor baby. We were going to share a dessert, but it was all we could to get, and pay our check. That said, I am looking forward to returning during the week and trying something less adventurous.",oiBTrfymtRfqJus6AI9yGA,1,1,4,zUCzGGcDz-ud3Xkuir0AJA

3966528,2016-04-20,7,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"I was to Chef Marc's Parma a couple of times and visited two of his pizza places.  After all closed, I was waiting to see what would happen.  Then I heard that he had opened a new trattoria in the Lakes which is fairly close to where I live.

I made a reservation and entered just before the reserved time at 5:15.  I was shown to a two top table around the wall from the entrance with a view of part of the restaurant.  In a short time, the waiter brought water, took my order for iced tea, and while this was going on, Chef Marc came to the table to greet me and to talk about the new place and then the specials for the night and he was talking up some of the dishes on the menu.

I ended up ordering the charred octopus to start.  It's served with white beans, celery, and lemon juice.  The octopus was nicely charred and the pieces were very plump and juicy.  In order to try both a pasta and a main course, my server, Donny, suggested the kitchen would make me a smaller portion of pasta.  I decided to get the small portion of wild mushroom ravioli with a truffle butter and parmesan cheese sauce.  The server added extra grated cheese.  The parmesan cream sauce was a perfect compliment to the ravioli and the smaller order was a generous portion but not enough to fill one up for the main course.

For the main, I ordered Scottish Salmon which was one of the two fish of the day selections.  The salmon had a coating of red and black pepper for a spicy taste and it was cooked perfectly.  Accompanying the salmon was a small amount of mashed potatoes and some glazed carrots.  I didn't think anyone served glazed carrots anymore but there they were.  While I would rather have had something else, they were OK and they gave a good counterpoint to the salmon's spicy topping.

For dessert, I got Italian style cheesecake and a double espresso.  Both were a good finish to a pleasant meal.

Service was excellent.  The staff was on everything immediately.  My only problem was with the sound.  The evening started with few customers and you could hear Sinatra singing.  Later, as more people came, the place got very loud from peoples' talk.  It just reverberated around the relatively small place.  I was glad they didn't turn up the music to try to make up for the loud talking.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,19,11,4,egqOSNHy8pkwqhTvOIw43g

4234252,2017-03-06,1,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Chef Marc has such a huge following around the valley and it's for good reason. I wrote a review for his more casual Parma years ago, and was saddened (as everyone was) when it had closed. While it was a nice respite to be able to see his fresh pasta at farmers markets and to visit his pizza place (now also closed), I missed the sit down dining experience with his warm hospitality.

Enter Chef Marc's Trattoria. I bookmarked it shortly after opening but I'm ashamed to say that my mantra to eat less carbs (for some reason my brain doesn't count dumplings?) kept me from coming here as soon as I wanted to. It wasn't until my best friend was craving Italian that I suggested knowing JUST the place.

In summary, we were in the mood for classics. We shared a caesar salad which was exactly what you'd expect it to be although the dressing was just a touch lighter than most which was welcome. We also had the clams with linguine and the eggplant parmesan. Chef Marc came out to touch tables, as he does, and we got into it about different pasta textures, our favorites, and which hold different sauces better for different purposes etc. He mentioned that they had a house made bucatini that day, and I became VERY excited as thats my absolute favorite. I subbed that in for my pasta side alongside the eggplant parmesan.

The eggplant parm seemed less like it was dredged through breadcrumbs, and more like it was just crisp egg batter, and it was a welcome change. It gave the dish a lightness without sacrificing any of its silky richness. The bucatini was the first thing I finished- mm! The linguine with clams is just EXACTLY right. It hit all the right flavors and I still dream about it. Fresh clams, lemon, garlic, white wine, parsley and homemade pasta all humbly married together in harmony. It was spectacular.

If you're looking for classics, this is tops if you want to avoid the strip and breaking the bank. I have yet to try any of their more creative dishes, but look forward to the opportunity to visit again in the (hopefully) near future! Also, the music was on point with classics like Sinatra setting just the right mood.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,4,3,5,ez4KdB6RO7lBTruEEG9boQ

We were seated immediately, however, they sat us in a booth next to a party of 8, when there were several other open tables for a party of two. We ordered our drinks and food and when our main entrée came, they placed it and immediately left. I received an Eggplant parmesan, when I ordered Chicken Piccata (white wine/lemon sauce).  While waiting for anyone to come back to the table, they realized they sent me the wrong dish. The Chef came by and said ""would you like this or what you order?"" Are you serious?!? I'll take what I ordered. While waiting, I leave and go to the restroom, my corrected dish comes. I look around for the pasta that would come with it and it's nowhere to be found. I wait for them to come back around to no avail, so my husband flags down our waitress. I ask if this dish comes with pasta or if it's literally just the chicken. She points to the pasta they left on the table from the Eggplant Parmesan, and says that's it. Ok so you're telling me a marinara sauce pasta goes with a white wine lemon dish? I don't think so... I asked for a side of pasta that is in a white wine sauce that would match my main entrée. She says do you want a butter garlic pasta? I said sure anything that will slightly complement my main dish. They bring out the pasta, and it's not cooked all the way. At this point I'm extremely annoyed with the comment of do I want to keep a dish I didn't order or get my proper dish and the wrong pasta with my corrected dish. Since it's my birthday they bring out a strawberry cake set it down and leave immediately. The table of 8 next to us, Says oh it's your birthday happy birthday and actually acknowledges it not the restaurant I'm celebrating it with. Totally disappointed with the service and the nerve of the restaurant to charge me for the pasta in the butter garlic sauce that would match my dish that they got wrong in the first place.  I give the restaurant 2 stars because the strawberry cake was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten.

4585321,2017-08-28,0,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"This has been on our must-try list for more than a year based on the Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately it did not measure up to our expectations.

This is definitely more of a neighborhood Italian restaurant but it tries to be a bit more elevated with it's dishes and pricing.  I don't believe it achieves it.  The restaurant itself is fairly small holding a capacity of under 100 diners.  The atmosphere is more of a casual neighborhood restaurant.  There are full-height windows throughout the dining area.  However these were all covered with solid rolling blinds when we arrived, we assumed, due to the summer sun. However after sundown they were never rolled up leaving the dining area to feel like a small dark space.

The service was good, not over-the-top impressive but also not neglectful.  One of the oddest experiences however was that the chef, presumably Marc, had made his presence in the quaint dining room twice during the course of our meal stopping at every table each time except ours. 

Two of us ordered the 7-course tasting menu.  Overall all items were good however a bit heavy on the seafood items.  I will blame myself for not speaking up when the waitress asked if there was anything that we would not eat.  While there wasn't my son, who was the other tasting menu order, will eat about anything but would have preferred less seafood selections.

We had ordered a charcuterie plate for the table for an appetizer.  We were underwhelmed by the selections, quantity and presentation.  It was a platter of: 4-rolled slices of each mortadella and soppresata, 6-small pieces of aged provolone, 10-olives, and 1-quarter of roasted artichoke.

My daughter ordered the Chicken Riggies which was rigatoni noodles with chicken, pancetta, jalapeno peppers in a red sauce.  There is a similar dish served at Salute ad Red Rock Casino that she likes so this dish piqued her interest.  She again was underwhelmed with this dish.  

My wife ordered a bowl of the Pasta e Fagioli soup.  This was very good according to my her.  She also sampled along with my son and my tasting meals and she too liked most of the courses.  

There are some pros.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, some of the food was very good, and it is conveniently located off of the Strip.  The cons were that there was too much inconsistencies and they try too hard to be an elevated Italian restaurant in a city full of great options.",Aofw4GTSxQeYtbhUwD2ZJg,2,0,2,6xqktgZKrpTZsxNfPLHBHA

We just left such an incredible meal there that it compelled me to lay in bed and Yelp about it.

Our daughter's birthday happens to be on Valentine's Day, making it near impossible to go out for a decent meal. Since it was her first birthday, we wanted to treat our family to a night out and Chef Marc did not disappoint. We spoke to him ahead of time and he was happy to work on a menu with us for our group-- even on Valentine's Day, the day pre fix menus go to die.

Every bite of food was incredible, but nothing compares to his pork chops. We go out to eat and cook a lot and it's still the best pork I've ever eaten.

The decor is nice and a lot more modern than his old place. His new menu has a lot of good options which makes the dish selection a lot easier. For our appetizer we got the  the escargot. The presentation of this dish was appealing. The escargot was taken out of the shell and placed on top of a crunchy garlicky toast. You get 8 escargots for $12, which is a reasonable price. I was very happy with the taste and flavors of this dish. 

For my main entree I got the black pasta with shrimp scampi. The pasta was freshly made and the flavors were great. My only observation was the amount of olive oil in the bottom of the plate. Unfortunately, my pasta was swimming in a lot of oil which was not very appealing to me. 

The service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive throughout the night. Chef Marc was very involved with his customers and all of his employees.

4654821,2017-10-23,7,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Chef Marc's Trattoria is the best Las Vegas neighborhood Italian restaurant meal that I ever had. My second favorite is Chef Marc's Parma back in 2014. Chef Marc, who's real name is Marcus Sgrizzi has created remarkable Italian food dishes in Las Vegas since 2000. Surprisingly it was his love for boxing that led the local celebrity chef to Las Vegas. Chef Marcus Sgrizzi's talent started way before he opened his first restaurant in Las Vegas. He Italian food masterpieces goes back to Singer Island in South Florida where he worked in his family's Italian restaurant. After my first experience in Parma, I thank boxing for leading the talented Chef to Bright Light City.

More than I want to thank boxing for the greatest Las Vegas Italian restaurant experience I've had in Las Vegas, I want to thank my dear friend for leading me to it. She has led me to exceptional restaurants that included Yummy Sushi and Parma. When she invited me to join both herself and mother for a dinner in Chef Marc's Trattoria, I was honored.

I am also honored to provide a brief introduction to Chef Marc's Trattoria before seguing into my personal experience. The first thing that I want to say is that Chef Marc's is a relatively new restaurant that opened on November 14, 2015 in the former Argana Moroccan Restaurant in the quaint Lakeside Village Plaza. Secondly I want to touch on what a Trattoria is. According to Wikipedia, a Trattoria is an Italian restaurant that is less formal than a ristauranti and more formal than an osteria. Wikipedia goes on to say that in recent times that the menus are short, the emphasis has shifted to the food, and the emphasis is on local cuisine. According to Chef Marc in a vegas.eater.com article by Bradley Martin, ""This place has the most charm of any place I've owned yet. Like a visit to an old Tucson villa."" Chef Marc was right on the money. I felt like I was spending a Friday evening in an Italian villa.

The first thing you notice before entering the restaurant is the dim lighting in the parking lot. Located in the Desert Shores community the parking lot features the same theme lamp posts that are throughout the community. This helps create a quaint environment. Under the dim lamp posts, I walked towards a mobile pizza oven. It mentions Novecento Neapolitan, which by the way is a solid pizza restaurant that I enjoyed a few years back off Eastern Avenue near the 215. Before headed to the outside menu, I checked out the mobile oven. In back of the mobile oven stood the 800 square foot outdoor patio.

In contrast to the abbreviated menus that trattorias customarily provide, this is a decent sized menu. Right off the bat I was ordering eggplant parmesan with fusillia pasta under a coating of fresh pasta marinara ($19).

After meeting up with my dear friend and her mother, the server led us to a comfortable table at the corner. It was the ideal spot to be in the moment appreciating the time with my company and remarkable Italian food. The noise level was low at the same time that we could hear and see the action at the bar. If my friend was not mistaken, we were sharing the room with Evander Hollyfield. We were also sharing the room with Chef Marc who personally walked up to our table to guarantee that we were having a nice experience in his restaurant.

Leading into the appetizers, our waitress presented us with a basket of fresh baked bread. My dear friend who is an authority on food presented me with samples of both her's and her mother's appetizers. The Burrata & heirloom with the pizza bread provided me with further confidence that she is an expert on Italian food. I would like to think that I am an authority on eggplant parmesan. It's only been one of my favorite foods since 1983. Whether or not I'm an expert on eggplant parmesan, my taste buds rated Chef Marc's creation highly. This leads into an important review pointer that Chef Marc's gives a substantial portion of food in proportion to a great number of celebrity chefs. And great foods. When it came to drinks, I opted out of the vast selection of wine, choosing a Coke instead. The Coke came in a can that the waitress poured into a glass with ice.

It pays to have dear friends that lead you to exceptional dining experiences like Chef Marc's Trattoria. I in turn want to lead you my dear Yelp friends and unique Yelp visitors to an exceptional Italian food experience in Chef Marc's Trattoria.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,11,4,oJyTnXoG5iX35sGH2wGxMQ

My favorite part was the pieces of bread that were dipped in sauce which was very unique. My favorite part of the entire meal was the beet salad. I would come here just for that! There were red beets with candied walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese. It was such a unique and tasty mix of extreme flavors. They had an entire menu of daily specials. We tried to bucatini with broccoli rabe and the spaghetti tortuffo. These were both on the very large menu of specials for the day.

4894955,2016-02-22,1,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Well let me start by saying we LOVE Chef Marc.  Love his passion for what he does, love talking to him in the restaurant, love the excitement he has when he is describing a dish he is concepting or preparing.   Very cool.   We are actually not from Vegas, but went a number of times to PARMA, his other place which closed down in 2015.   We loved the food there and the vibe, and were excited to come try his new place knowing what we know.  

That being said, I can't say I will be back.  :(    The food was - well, unextraordinary.  If I am going to drive from the strip where I normally stay to a more local's place (which I did for Parma a bunch of times), I have to leave feeling I had an amazing meal.  That didn't happen here.  (This would be a 3.5 star review if it could be ).

We started with his warm portabello spinach salad, something he served at Parma off the menu if you knew to order it.  Yummy.   With it they brought out a basket of bread.   There was some warm chewy italian bread at the bottom of the basket, and on top were some strips of something covered in sauce and a bit of cheese.  The first thing I noticed as I grabbed them was how cold and mushy they were.  Kinda like if you grabbed an old cold sponge from your neighbor's sink?   The consistency was NOT nice.  Took one bite and set it aside.  Why serve that?  Even complementary.  Yuk.  The garlic bread Marc served at Parma was amazing, one of my favorite parts of the meal, and that was an opinion shared by many people I brought there over the years.  This bread basket didn't come close.

We got the Pasta Fagiole soup as well.  White bean soup, but really, looked like just a bowl of white beans in a white sauce.  I rarely if ever add salt and pepper to restaurant dishes, but this  soup needed lots of help.  Not only did it look unappetizing, it didn't taste like much either.   We actually didn't finish it, which is sad.  

We shared two main courses, A veal saltimbocca (one of my favorites) and a spaghetti carbonara.   The dishes were presented nicely, but taste wise, they were bland.  I was really sad.  I LOVE a good meal and was really excited to come here.   The veal portion was large, but the taste was, well, just meh.  Again we didn't finish the dish.  And the Carbonara, which I know is open to all kinds of debate as to whether to add cream (non traditional) vs. just egg and cheese, that's all good but our dish.. well.   Have you ever seen food if it sat under a heat lamp a really long time?  Kinda dried out and tired?   That was what I thought of when I had this.  Just clumpy, sticky, stiff, and lacking flavor on top of it.   And believe me it makes me sad to write that.  It just didn't meet our expectations.  

Service started out well, but after we were served the main courses our waiter disappeared.  GONE.  When I wanted a check ( half hour or 45 minutes after) I finally flagged down another waiter and asked for it, and then our waiter appeared to give it to us.  Not cool.   

We brought in our own bottle of wine, which we do from time to time.   I am cool with a corkage fee, I think the restaurants should make something, so that doesn't bother me.  A $25 corkage fee, though, I think is a bit excessive.   You should be forewarned if you are planning on bringing in your own wine.  

I really would love it if Marc read this, and maybe changed some things.  I'd love to see him thrive, and I am rooting for him.   Maybe it is assistant chefs not following his recipes, maybe some of his dishes just need a bit of tweaking, but the way it is right now, I can find better restaurants in Vegas to head to when I am there visiting.",tS-JQ8yXyV43LQk1jZKyvw,3,1,3,95BeKSYtZ5fatZMPc1OL8Q

While we were seated promptly (we had reservations), our server was very slow in everything from menus, to drink service, to food service, to the bill. The bread basket was good. We got the mozzarella en carroza for an appetizer and while it was fine, it was basically just a fried grilled cheese sandwich. It didn't have any seasoning or flavor beyond that. There was marianara sauce to dip it in at least. My husband got one of the daily specials, a spicy salmon dish served with mashed cauliflower and it was good, but when we got the bill he was surprised at the price....it wasn't that good! As for my pappardelle with roasted cauliflower, it was just bland. The pasta itself was quite good but the sauce was boring and the roasted cauliflower didn't add anything. Everything was edible, but after eating such delicious food at Parma in it's wonderfully funky atmostphere, we were sorely disappointed by the lackluster food, inadequate service, and fairly standard (though nice) atmosphere.

Our starters were great, but the BLACK PASTA With truffle cream, peas, topped with ""Jumbo Lump Crab"" was ruined by the fishy smelling & tasting faux CRAB MEAT.

The pasta and truffle cream sauce was great - but when you put FISH (with strong fishy taste) on top it SUCKS!

We we went to Chef Marc's (Marc Sgrizzi) Trattoria because this dish was specifically written up in Las Vegas Weekly (June 6-14, page 14). We decided to give it a try. But Chef Marc's raising the price by 23% and serving FISH as CRAB is BAD, BAD, BAD. TERRIBLE!

The Las Vegas Weekly write up said ""this unorthodox masterpiece .. fresh house-made black fettuccine gets all sauced up with truffle cream and quite a bit of jumbo lump crab meat."" $26 (Chef Marc's printed menu was $32)

overall...from start to finish really good and solid
....and the new restaurant space....swoon!!! it was like going to sleep with a so-so efficient 5 and waking up next to a brilliant adonis 9. perhaps the mind is even fooled that the food just tastes better or the flaws are less striking in this prettier, more intimate and warm space. 
service was very good and I am particularly very thankful as we had the mature and senior set in tow. 
burrata...probably skip next time..plated cut in half..saltines sticking out of each half...weird
carozza..safe app for the table..good and well safe..who doesn't like gooey mozzarella 
portabella app...ohhhh soooo good and love the fresh spinach to cut the richness, perhaps my entree next time
our mains...all winners - veal cremini, chix piccata, osso buco, meat ravioli and eggplant parm....
eggplant parm in particular so thin and really just perfectly executed. but picking a favorite would be terribly difficult. 

two not so perfect parts...on a thursday evening two servers for the entire dining room..service wasn't lacking but perhaps another body besides runners would have made the meal a bit more timely. 
second...painfully reporting that the pasta side served along with the veal, eggplant and chicken dishes...not good, at all. a real downer frankly. mushy pasta and the simple tomato sauce lacked something...salt perhaps. deff next time we will order a cut pasta with more tooth.

Born Marcus Sgrizzi, but known locally as Chef Marc, it was before officially relocating to Las Vegas that a visit to Parma acquainted me with the Chef's well-deserved acclaim, and subsequently meeting some now-close friends by way of an event held at Novecento it seemed strange that Trattoria by Chef Marc had slipped beneath my radar nearly nine months since opening, the move finding Mr. Sgrizzi now in a more refined space only ten minutes from my gate.

East Coast raised, but well traveled throughout Italy with an 'effort equals results' sort of mentality that sees Marc and his team scratch-make everything from Bread and Pasta to Desserts and Sauces in-house, Trattoria by Chef Marc sits just outside The Lakes on West Sahara Avenue in a space formerly inhabited by Argana Moroccan Restaurant, the interior featuring heavy woods and marble plus a hand-built Wine Vault with sound a bit louder than would be ideal due to the combination of hard surfaces and overhead music, though a near-full-house of locals still did not make things so noisy that one would be forced to shout.

Offering an a la carte menu plus a $65 ""Chef's Table"" that sees diners preferences incorporated into a tasting otherwise left in the kitchen's hands, it was by request that Marc and his team crafted an 'extended' version of the latter experience that eventually turned into eleven courses including several menu favorites, the quality of many comparing favorably to Casino-based restaurants charging more than twice the price.

Well established in the city, and as such forming relationships with high quality purveyors of Italian goods plus vegetables brought in from Melissa's Produce of California, a meal at Trattoria begins with Sgrizzi's bread basket and although little packets of cold butter seem a bit out of place in an environment where Olive Oil should come standard the Bread itself is as delicious as it is dangerous, both the Pizza Focaccia and warm Semolina loaf difficult to resist, particularly as a means for sopping up sauces.

No doubt looking to build on past successes and further strengthen a menu filled with the time-tested recipes on which he built his name, first courses of the Chef's Table saw Chef Marc dabbling in fresh ingredients that he has recently become fond of, the Sea Urchin seemingly served as a means to work with seasonal Fruits and Wasabi leaf while the inspired Salad that followed tasted very much like Fava Beans despite the fact that only Greens, Grapes, Cheese and Seasoning were mingling on the plate.

Turning eyes to the laminated menu for a moment, the Buratta Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes and aged Balsamic expected but delicious in its simplicity just the same, course four saw Chef Marc take on the hefty pairing of Pork Belly and Bone Marrow with a keen sense of delicacy, the supple pig stacked atop buttered toast while the hemisected Cannon saw its creamy contents delicious whether mixed into Polenta or enjoyed with Picked Fennel Bulb and traditional Parsley Salad.

Personally requesting the Eggplant Parm, a small wedge offered alongside house Marinara and lightly fried herbs, a nightly special Pasta next saw soft Meat and Ricotta spring to life in a butter sauce tinged in Nutmeg and Sage, the line-caught Halibut to follow both meaty and flaky beneath a skin of crisp Sesame Seeds with rich Scallop Bisque lent levity by Pasta and snappy Italian Beans.

Refreshing the palate with Lemon Sorbetto, the icy texture needing a bit of work, another special of Braised Veal Short Rib ate much like Osso Bucco with both the White Wine of the braising liquid and spicy Greens serving as balance, a small portion of the deconstructed Lasagna using a similar cut of Meat every bit as excellent when baked with Mozzarella.

Rounding out the evening with half-portions of Butter Rum Cake and Tiramisu, both made by Marc's Wife, desserts were well made if not a little predictable, the only other option offered a Crème Brulee that seems more ""Summerlin"" than Italian in a place where something like Canolli, Budino or even an Italian Cookie Plate would better round out the night.

****Without doubt the most creative Italian spot on the West side of the Valley, and in the conversation for most labor intensive kitchen off-strip, Trattoria shows Chef Marc back in his element creating great food and welcoming guests to his kitchen, a work in progress that is already pretty great",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,4,ZY2cOzgwToolJnCawVoguA

I called the trattoria for 6:30 reservations for yesterday & mentioned it was our first time, and a birthday celebration (I also informed the maitre'd when we arrived).  We were greeted by a 3 year old child running about the restaurant, climbing over empty chairs & booth.  She would have continued past the 20 mins. but I asked a server to provide a high chair for her.  That lasted only a few mins. because she cried & screamed to get out.  F I n a l l y!  A server took the little girl away.

I ordered the Chicken Picatta and my partner the Scarpariello (roasted organic chicken with Italian sausage, served on pasta or polenta (as menu stated).  There were 2 kinds of bread served:  pizza-like bruschetta & parmesan toast.  Both were very good.  Our server spoke Italian & was very attentive, asking how spicy he wanted the Scarpariello & saying it was a large serving.  And indeed it was!   A half organic chicken with sweet red peppers & 2 nice-sized Ital. sausages cooked just right.  It all sat on a bed of spiced pasta.  My Chicken Picatta with lemon & capers was organically perfect!  It not only melted in my mouth, but I (reluctantly) had to leave one of the 3 portions for the next day's dinner.  It was served with a fresh tomato pasta & a side of mundane carrots (not a good side with that pasta).

The ambiance was bright to the outside & seating arranged well.  I would prefer candles on the table, and don't understand the lack of music.  This is an Italian restaurant after all, & we'd have loved the sound of jazz or classical or Bocelli to drown out conversations around us.  Perhaps Marc prefers the atmosphere to be like his previous Bohemian casual restaurant/deli on Lake Mead, but I'd ""upgrade"" in this setting in The Lakes.  I also wish he had a house wine for $5-6.00 and not those starting at $10.00.  All-in-all, it needs some tweaking; and maybe he just needs more time.  P.S.  I really wanted people to join in while I sang Happy Birthday, but not even a cupcake arrived.  (I took my partner out for Tiramisu).",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,0,0,3,O5mWcX-TibZA-qD1UTCQyg
5361194,2018-01-15,0,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Update:  terrible response from the Chef.  

We were really excited to try this place.  Upon entry the hostess was pleasant and sat us right away.  She did not fuss when we asked to move to the table next as we did not want to sit at the table nearest the door and main walking path.  
It took about 3-4 minutes to be offered tap or bottled water.  We close sparkling.   I found it odd that my 4 year old was poured almost double the amount my husband was.  No big deal, we share as a family and have no issues ordering more when needed.
The male who served our water had no problem answering some questions we had about appetizers we saw on yelp but not on our menu (fried calamari and fried mozzarella).  I was surprised he wasn't our server as he was pleasant, helpful and seemed knowledgeable.  We ordered the appetizer escargot with him and then were immediately greeted by our server.   She was nice.  We placed our dinner order right away.
My daughter ordered the Caesar salad, it was a medium sized portion, fresh with good flavor in the cheese and dressing.
My son had a simple pasta in a butter/cheese sauce.  It was tasteful and cooked al dente.
I had the wild shrimp scampi.  It was excellent.
My husband ordered the Cioppino (seafood platter).  This comes with spaghettini.  The pasta seemed to have been al dente before being tossed in the sauce and was quite more.. chewy than my perfectly cooked spaghettini in the shrimp scampi. 
My husband is not one to send food back but after I took a bite to confirm his suggestion our server came over.  I let her know it was slightly over cooked, my husband agreed and asked for a new batch.  Our server took the bowl and seemed like it was no problem.
Here's where I deduct stars.
Server returns and says the chef suggests it is not over cooked and places the same dish of pasta on the table.   At the same time another employee comes over with ""a key ingredient to the Cioppino"" in a small dish.   The crab.   He asks my husband if he'd just like it poured on his plate.  He agreed and we finished our meal but with a bad taste in our mouths about this situation.
This was just 2 negative things that will make us not return because at least 1 of these could've been avoided.  Not to mention the chef did not come out to make sure the dish was satisfactory even after missing a key ingredient and asking for a new batch of spaghettini.  (I say this because in a lot of reviews the diners express their table visits by Chef Marc.)

I originally was looking forward to trying some desserts here but couldn't stand giving my business any further to an establishment that made me feel unappreciated.  That's too bad because again, the shrimp scampi and escargot were delicious.",o1Y7kEsQk6GaloUlLn3OOQ,3,0,2,UoJkzMOpErdbwq1D6RakwA

5529188,2016-02-08,76,cgZOP1ZUBOZmEQMSJ53oiQ,"Having only enjoyed Chef Marc's wonderful cuisine through special events, I was excited to finally try some of his traditional Italian fare.  His passion for cooking is  felt by anyone he interacts with.  That enthusiasm is easily transferred because I was ready to order everything after listening to him go over the specials on a recent Friday night.

Burrata is to mozzarella as toro is to tuna.  Buttery, creamy, rich and dare I say eggy; it was excellent with just a touch of aged balsamic, but even better with the fresh tomato and greens.  I am sure their caprese salad is very good as well, but this is worth the extra $4.  

""Fruiti di Mar"" was fruits of the sea indeed!  The entrée was filled with a more than generous helping of mussels and clams along with shrimp and calamari.  My toes tapped to a seafood symphony that only I could hear in my head.  Substituting the linguine for Marc's freshly made black pappardelle was an outstanding decision by me.  ""Pappare"" means ""to gobble up"" in Italian.  That shit was pappared!

More casual than fancy in atmosphere, this restaurant makes for a terrific neighborhood spot that hopefully sticks around for the long haul.  I'd gladly choose this over the other trattoria's in Summerlin.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,125,108,4,yNRu-ETcezTwx24-P3n1vw

We were greeted by a very friendly older Italian gentleman at the host stand who sat us immediately.  I had made reservations for us and they're recommended because the place was quite busy on a Friday night.  

There were several specials available for dinner with the butternut squash ravioli immediately catching my eye, especially the part about brown butter sage.  My friend went with the Frutti di Mare (Fruit of the Sea) with calamari, shrimp, mussels, and clams served with pasta.  The bread basket came with two types of bread, our favorite being the Italian with sesame seeds:  slather that butter on and devour!  I had a bowl of pasta e fagioli to start while my friend had a glass of wine as her appetizer.  The soup was hearty and great comfort food for the cold weather.  The delicious ravioli was gone in no time flat.  I got to try the gal pal's dish and it was also very good, especially if you love shellfish.

Chef Marc came by each table to check on his diners as he usually does.

Upon entry, I was greeted by the kind gentleman host. I saw my friend over at the bar, she walked over and then we were seated.

The space for this restaurant is intimate and small. The warm tones of the interior made us feel cozy on this rainy evening. I chose to drink a glass of the Super Tuscan wine. I then chose the Chicken Marsala. This is one of my favorite dishes so I try it wherever I am if I see it on the menu. I also ordered a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. My friend chose the Shrimp Scampi over Linguine. The Lobster Bisque was rich, creamy and flavorful. There were nice size chunks of Lobster in the Bisque which I was surprised to see. Not a lot of them but enough. Next came the entrees. My dinner selection was the wrong choice in this instance. I found the sauce to be a little too sweet and it did not compliment the chicken. The mushrooms were very good though. There was also a side of zucchini which I also liked. My friend really loved her shrimp scampi and it was lovely presentation. Both entrees were big so we ended up taking a to go bag. I waited and waited for Chef Marc to come over to our table which so many Yelpers had stated in their reviews but he never did.

It was slow (it was after 9pm...) so we were instantly seated by a very friendly gentleman who was a bit flirty. We ordered drinks (just water and soda) and they brought out some delicious bread while we figured out what to order. 

I got a lemon chicken dish and my friend got the eggplant parm. Both dishes were fantastic! I had leftovers (which I made into a sandwich the following day). Portions were pretty big, but I don't eat a whole lot for dinner so it could just be me. 

Service was excellent. The gentleman who sat us kept coming over to chit chat and our waitress was great with recommendations as well as keeping glasses filled with drinks. 

The restaurant itself is pretty cute. It's not huge (from what I could see) but very well decorated and maintained. 

I think it's a little on the pricey side, BUT it is worth it and not so expensive that it's cost prohibitive (more than Olive Garden, less than casino Italian).

To make it right they took off Two cans of Coke .Classy not! Also one other drink. Gave us one dish of sorbet! Not bad

I guess they figured we wouldn't come back any why make it! I left a message told the Cook he should try the fish! Because no chef would have served that kind of fishy fish!!

In the weeks leading up to the reception, Chef Marc put together the delicious tasting menu.  We, as newlyweds, had a tall order as our guests ranged from vegan to the die-hard meat lover.   He created a selection that was out of this world.  Then he continued to add and add to the plate choices.  

We had over 80 guests and everyone fit nicely.  Lino made sure of that.  He took our thoughts and turned them into a reality that filled every spot in the restaurant without making everyone squished in .

We went on a Sunday night and had reservations which I strongly recommend. While they provide chairs outside to wait for a table when it's 108 degrees outside even the awning   above the chairs wouldn't help. I've always enjoyed the pork chop El Chico which Mark tells me is his father's recipe. I order it as a 3 on a 1 --5 hotness scale which gives it a hot/spicy kick but you still know it's a pork chop. It was excellent. I'm not a fan of polenta so I requested a side of pasta which was tasty but the noodles were a little overcooked/soft for my taste.

My wife had the chicken marsala with mushrooms which she thought was excellent even the leftovers for lunch the next day.

The service was outstanding; very attentive without being overly obtrusive. We had a nice talk with Chef Mark reminiscing about the old place and it was good to see him again.

We came here based on the amazing Yelp reviews and are so disappointed. We got stuck at a high top table by the bar and it took a solid 15 mins for anyone to even come over and give us water and say hi.  It took 45 mins for our appetizers to arrive and all we ordered was a single meatball and a charcuterie board - which is basically cold cuts. We sucked it up and decided the dinner was going to be amazing so it would be totally worth the wait. Our main course came a little over an hour after being there.  The chicken Marsala was just ok and my side of pasta was cold. Not luke warm, but it was COLD. The spaghetti and meatballs was a whopping $22 and the meatballs were hard and dry and the spaghetti was a slight tint of red after being dipped in what was probably some sort of sauce, but there was no sauce on the plate anywhere.  We took a few bites and asked for the check - we just wanted out, we were sitting for waaaay too long. The table next to us got some cannolis and some sort of apology - they'd been there for a hot minute too. Sadly, we didn't get acknowledged or get any sort of consolation prize.

Sunday evening they were not terribly busy, but the wife and I also had a reservation so we were seated immediately on arriving, our waiter introduced himself, told us the specials, then gave us a few moments to look over the menu. 

A couple of minutes later a very friendly, older gentleman came out and started talking to us, and he also asked us if we had any questions, etc., then he offered to take our drink orders. After he left my wife told me that it was Chef Marc himself. Now my Yelp reviews may not show it but I've eaten in some pretty upscale joints but I've never had the chef come to my table to chat and talk food before the meal. I was already impressed and I hadn't even eaten anything.

Chef Marc came back with our drinks then talked food with us some more. The wife chose the Frutti di Mare and it was LOADED with shellfish. She loves her seafood, and she can be picky, but she was very happy with her dish. Chef sold me on the Chicken Riggies over the Short Rib Malfatti, and I'm glad he did because it was delicious! I'm sure the Malfatti would have been excellent, too, but I didn't regret getting the Riggies. My one regret was we were only in town for a few days and, as I've mentioned already, he closes Monday and Tuesday so we were not able to return for a second meal. 

The Malfatti will have to wait until next time because we will be back. Oh yes, we will.",e5wQdsP_eI0Zza90hHFDyw,2,0,5,6umTXIHvPVVryANdoCGYbw

The service was attentive and so friendly and the food was fantastic. 

I have heard about Chef Marc's for years but only just got to visit recently for my mom's birthday.

We had a party of five and they seated us at a table with a lazy Susan. This is great for parties wishing to do family style. We ordered a few shared dishes and it was very convenient to pass it around.

I ordered the pork chop and it was exceptional. Every dish I tried was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I look forward to visiting again soon!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,16,15,5,sRJAGXLMv6uTS6I8yxrbpw
