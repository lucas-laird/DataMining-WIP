There's plenty of meat and beans all though I thought the portion was big enough for two it was small. The food is made to order and the kitchen seems to be clean.",JsAJj_0a4KzW6Pog-Df_yw,0,0,3,KJ3S9srjXOkQbzjqYTQDBQ

869437,2016-02-22,1,odYdARplahqW4XbXU4drKg,This was my favorite place to eat.  Now I'm not so sure that I want to eat here again I found a piece of meat in my veggie burrito. I know it was an accident but please if you're making a veggie burrito maybe don't wrap it near the meat.,tV-q3aoHwTt6UgqKwDArjQ,0,0,1,8Z9Y735SqeVz8Ocnz4LnVA

I love the salsas not only are they hot but have flavor which is hard to find a restaurant with both. The agua frescas it taste so freshly made.

They used to have a location on West Charleston and when I found out it closed I was super disappointed. I happened to be working on the East side one day and needed a Starbucks so mapped the closest one to me and as was pulling into the Starbucks entrance after passing it, out of the corner of my eyes, I see the Taco sign and my face must have lite up like a Christmas tree!! My new mission was to eat me some tacos and forgot all about my original plan for a Starbucks drink.",aNsisOK9scnv7bPNSFSQSA,0,0,5,brsKgpMvyRuonVWEc_9IFg

Fresh, delicious!
Clean restaurant, with great salsa bar.
Assortment of home made agua frescas.
The chicken tacos are to die for, and I loved their Piña ( pineapple) agua fresca.

Lots of room for groups and the staff is always friendly. Price is a little higher compared to other fast food style Mexican restaurants in the area (about $10/person for a full combo meal) but worth it.

Everything is flavorful; the salsa is spicy and flavorful, the meat is well seasoned, and the agua frescas are definitely my favorite.

2792290,2018-03-21,0,odYdARplahqW4XbXU4drKg,"This place is delicious 

This is my second time here.

The food comes out pretry quickly.
Their combo plates are super filling. 
Their meets are well marinated.my favorite so far is the Buche

They have a large array of delicious juices. And they change out the flavors. 

Haven't had enough space in my belly for dessert too- but they have some! 

They are super friendly here. 

The only down sdes are
you can't order mixed meats or the cooked jalapeños and onions as a side- they do include this in their combo plates though! 
They also have a pretty small salsa bar- red and green salsa, pickled onions/carrots/cauliflower, and radishes  

Coming back again to try more of their options !",kYvJVnqfv_Vhq_Mp4G0LNg,0,0,5,JjgKTUfYGaNEL-uTIAHGeg

We came here at the request of one of our friends. Gave it a second thought because of the surrounding area. But when we saw the clean new shopping center we were a little more comforted. Then completely surprised by the clean interior of the restaurant. We were then greeted with a smile by the friendly cashier who asked us clarifying questions (I guess it was pretty obvious I didn't speak Spanish). The food took a bit to come out, but not so long that it affected our lunch period. The food was nice, hot, and seemingly fresh! VERY GOOD! Would definitely come back

This restaurant is very clean nice decor is nothing out of the normal I was extremely surprised by how neat and clean it is.

The prices are not bad at all they have a variety of combo specials that are a ton of food at most your pay 20 for a plate and this is the most expensive meal including sides. 

I ordered a vegetarian burrito that included crema, cheese, avocado, beans, and more. I also had a delicious agua Fresca made out of agua vana Definitely recommend this it is amazing!!!! 

Total was was not out rages, like I said if you have a craving for Mexican food and are in the area pass by here.",kS7NvX5dw49xJvujQpL7Kw,2,2,4,jJQtkaWgv4dwxAZbVMKHjA
