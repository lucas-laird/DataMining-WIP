The experience starts when you sit down. The waitress says, ""I'll go and get you some bread"". She comes back with big, warm, soft pretzels hanging from metal spikes and accompanied by 2 mustard sauces and a mustard butter. Mmmm...... butter. You want nachos? Fall in love with the tuna nachos and pineapple salsa. French fries? Shoestrings fried and seasoned to perfection. 

After dinner, walk over to the bar area and watch the game or a movie. Plop yourself down on a leather couch, kick off your shoes and enjoy the complimentary spicy popcorn.

We ordered a round of drinks and the lollypop wings to start, thinking we'd supplement with an additional dish or two a little later.  The wings showed up a few minutes right after we placed our order, before our drinks arrived.  Note to all food establishments:  there's nothing worse than staring at a plate of food without even having your first drink on hand.  The place wasn't that busy yet and the bar was not crowded so there was no excuse.  The lollypop wings were tasty but not tasty enough to warrant $16 an order, or roughly $2/lollypop wing. The actual amount of meat on each bone was no bigger than your generic store-brand cotton ball (and I'm not talking the economy-sized cotton puffs they sell at Rite Aid).  

Our drinks arrived (cucumber gimlet and kilo colado, again tasty, but not dazzling) about ten minutes after the wings.  Our excitement about finally having libation in hand was quickly diminished when we  noticed that every table except ours had the complimentary pretzels with dipping sauces.  We inquired with our waiter and it was obvious they forgot  us.  So the free bread came after we had already finished  our appetizer and most of our drinks.  The platter had two pretzels which made the presentation seem bare bones, like a restaurant that serves a table of two a breadbasket with exactly two pieces of bread.  At least give one more piece of carb than there are number of people so we can fight over/split the last piece while still feeling like you're giving us more than just the bare minimum.   

Additionally, we couldn't help but overhear the table behind us complain that they were still waiting for their order of wings so I'm sure somebody mixed up and gave us their order.  Underwhelmed with the food and the service,  we called for the check without bothering to order anything else -  $42 before tip for  one drink apiece and a plate of wings.  The potential of the food and beverage is definitely eclipsed by the confused and backwards service.  Overall, this was a disappointing visit but I'm glad it allowed us to quit while our wallets were still somewhat ahead.

Well guess what? We ate there again on our own dime, it was that good.
I talked with our server on both visits, who admitted that there is a consistency problem with the serving staff, especially during the busy hours, but they were really working on bringing up the caliber. I have to say, he was solicitous to us each time, and very friendly and intuitive about when to ask if we needed anything, as well as when to leave us alone. The bar staff, hostess and bus boys (do we still call them that?) were all very friendly and helpful too.
Yes, some of the prices are steeper than what you would spend at your neighborhood Applebee's, but remember, all of Vegas and the Strip is pricey. So take all those reviews with a grain of salt, some peoples reasonable is another persons too damn high!
Yes, 17.00 for wings seems steep however you are never going to have them prepared like this, the best of the meat in one ""lolly pop"" of a succelent bite, so yummy. Well worth the splurge, my hubby and I split an order and it was plenty as an appetizer.
He had the Philly Cheese Steak dumplings and raved about them, I didn't get a bite in on those, so, bummer!
I have to agree that the Doritos mac and cheese did not even look appealing, so I could take peoples word to avoid it, which leads me to my next piece of advice:
Really carefully look at a menu and read the descriptions of the dishes, as well as the prices. With care, you will find something fun and inventive but also a sure bet to please your palate and pocketbook.
As for deals, they have a steak and eggs with shoestring fries for 9.99. Awesome deal! Plus we called ahead for our second visit and was told when to come for a food and drink promotion that is not advertised, it's all about positive attitude and good networking.
The interior is dark and the music is bumping, if you don't like that, don't come here and then complain about how dark and loud it is...as for us, we liked the ""club"" atmosphere because we are not the kind that are cool enough to get into Tao or Lavo, so this is the next best thing, good food, awesome music and fun times right on the Strip!",2CfZknZBgPR4MzYD9C5QtA,0,0,4,7AUzQhzjjMGuop8K5ZwUJQ

Excellent from the moment we stepped foot in the restaurant. The staff is super attentive and welcoming. 
Greg, our server, deserves an A+ (and a raise) for making our dining experience such a pleasant one. He even packed extra pretzels for us in a doggie bag so we can munch on them after the late night festivities!

Food:
FIRST serves mainly comfort food (think mac n' cheese, pizza, steak) that have been slightly refined. The complimentary pretzels are too salty for our taste but everything else was fairly on point.
The most memorable dish is the mojito lamb chops for appetizer. The dish was finished off at the table; the chops were doused with a mint sauce and Barcadi 151 and then lit with a match. It wasn't fireworks but definitely made our dining experience more interesting. 
Grilled swordfish came with a wasabi-flavored sauce that was a bit pungent for the nose but the texture of the fish was perfect. 
The Papardelle with forest mushrooms... it literally had a forest of mushrooms! It was a fantastic pasta to mushroom ratio because I'm a mushroom fiend. The truffle butter was a nice touch but gave the dish too much oil for my liking. 

Price:
Very reasonable considering FIRST is on the Strip and in the Palazzo. 
2 glasses of wine + 1 appetizer + 2 entrees + 1 dessert came out to $95. 
$15 for 3 pieces of lamb chops as appetizer is a bit steep but they were delicious so they justify the price... almost. 
 
Ambiance:
Modern and clean lines with a pop of color here and there. The high ceiling and ginormous windows overlooking the Strip make the space appear industrial but still has a welcoming feeling. Definitely casual but can be a fun place for a gathering with friends or for a low-key dinner with a special someone.

Besides the mojito lamb chops, the dinner wasn't extraordinary. But Greg our server made it so much more memorable and enjoyable! Thanks Greg!",FRwABdATa5NZ5EowILfVtg,5,0,4,4eDkjx2GR2iHMaD9aqDC3A

In a nutshell... Service bordered on painfully slow and food was just a notch above McDonald's. Throw ridciulous prices in for diner food (and YES, I know it's in the Palazzo), and you get one star. I give it one ONLY because it is very cool looking inside.

My fiance and I ate lunch there over this past weekend. We sat at the bar, as we typically like quicker service. Oops! That was a mistake when the bartender has to cover both the bar and the entire lounge area. And let's just say the bartender wasn't speedy gonzalez. Not all of it was his fault though. The Mensa designers of that place made it architecturally impossible for him to make quick transitions from behind the bar to the open lounge. He actually has to open a full sized man door, trudge through some unknown corridor, and emerge through another full sized man door before being free. I envision some sort of Shining like shrub maze inside, based on the time it took him to make the journey.

I obviously wasn't the only one who didn't appreciate his time trials. Several tables left before even being greeted, though I'm not sure it even registered with him. If it did, I would have thought he would call the manager over to send him help. I saw two of those people he could have yelled to. Still not sure what their job was, other than to walk around oblivious to the poor service being rendered.

As for the food... Had the cuban sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. Cuban was juicy (read: sloppy) and reeked of mayonnaise. Guess that hid the real taste of the single slice of meat inside. The mac and cheese was weak with fake crumbles on top. The truffle oil was a nice touch, but I think the chef needs to review his recipe. It seems like he forgot that it is mac and CHEESE.

So the next time I find myself hammered and looking for a cool place to hang out, I will surely consider First. Perhaps a little alcohol induced brain damage is exactly what it takes to part with another $40 for a sandwich, side and two drinks.",XL8aiO7_cmWSqSI9zgpUoA,4,4,1,BKv4j3SDzPTTRNft44If3w

~ Complimentary appetizer : Ginormous pretzels served with 3 different dipping sauces (buttery dip and 2 different mustards?) WOW, these were salty... but nothing a little rub down couldn't fix.  The salt flakes come right off so we were still able to enjoy them.  Plus, they were freee!!  
~ Famous Lollipop Buffalo Wings : spicy and succulent.  The bone on the end was shaved of all muscles/skin for easy handle and devouring.  
~ Grilled Swordfish with fingerling potatoes : DELICIOUS!  The potatoes were a nice pairing to the oh-so-meaty and flavorful swordfish.  
~ Refreshing sangrias to wash it all down.  Well-blended and quenched my thirst.

The best part about the restaurant is the little photo booth in the front!  $1 a pic (or 4 depending on what setting you choose).  But, it's quite small... 3 ppl max, I'd say.

The only thing was the waitress accidentally placed an extra order of buffalo wings that we didn't order... and made us pay for it anyways.  But, it was ok... we devoured them anyways :)

However, the Chopped Salad was just plain strange. You may assume you're getting a typical chopped salad with an interesting twist, falafal croutons, when you order this salad, but instead you get a salad heavily loaded with capers and pepperoncini slivers. Do you know how hard it is to pick capers and pepperoncini slivers out of a chopped salad? (Answer:  impossible). Now I'm all for gettin' all California fusion with salad ingredients, but neither of these items are mentioned on the menu (only the aforementioned falafal croutons). When my server asked me how I liked it, I said, "" Gee, that was a lot of capers,"" and he said, ""Yah, I don't like capers."" Then I had to wonder, why the f didn't this guy mention something when I ordered the damn salad? Perhaps he could have said, ""It's a great salad, if you like capers"" or ""It's a surprisingly spicy salad because of all those  slivered pepperoncinis in there"" or SOMETHING!  Oh, and one other bit of bad news.  We had five people at dinner, and four entrees came out 10 minutes before the fifth one, which was a pizza which was burnt pretty crispy.

Wow.  I have never been this impressed with a restaurant.

I got the duck.  WOW!! It was bursting with explosive flavors.  

There was a parsley-like plant sprinkled on the duck that had a sweet sauce on it.  It rocked me.  The duck was moist and had a lot of fat but was medium rare and so juicy.  The duck was arranged in a circle.  At the center of the circle was an apple desert-like creation that had the consistency of mashed potatoes.  It was great.

First didn't serve bread to ""hold you over"" until the main course.  They actually serve pretzels!  The pretzels came with three different sauces for dipping.

My friend ordered the salmon which was very moist and pleasing to the taste buds.

I'm not into girlie drinks, or any drinks for that matter; I'm a fan of beer but the cotton candy martini is a must for anyone who likes sweet tasting mixed drinks.  It rocked me too!

The decor at First is modern, classy, and ""post-modern meets shiny Ikea.""  I loved it.  I'm not sure if this is the Sammy Haggar bar, but the music reflected it:  lots of rock.  

There was also one of those old-fashioned machines where you put in quarters and take a photo.  You can zoom in and out and choose your own ""frame"" for the photo.  My friend and I got one as a fun memory of our trip to Vegas.

My favorite cocktail is the cucumber gimlet, made with Hendrick's gin. Perfect for a warm summer night.

Favorite apps are the walnut shrimp and lollipop buffalo wings.

The sliders were good but nothing special and a bit overpriced at $18. The menu here is pretty diverse with burgers, wings, salads, pizza, shrimp cocktail, s'mores, mac 'n cheese, French dips, fish & chips and a full-bar + extensive wine list. You can enjoy some sports games and, during the late night hours, you can enjoy some hypnotic beats and music videos. 

If you're dreaming about Dorito Mac 'n Cheese during the wee hours of the morning, save yourself a trip and adjust your itinerary and eating schedule accordingly :-) Our server said they usually only serve the Dorito Mac during the lunch and dinner periods.

I was going to try to find somewhere with more positive feedback but when I realized what a late start we were getting that night (on a Monday) I knew that First would be accommodating since they are open super late.

So my sister and I came here to fill up before hitting XS club at the Wynn. I had seen some complaints about the difficulty of finding the place but had no such problem, the place is located strip side with a near direct entrance. We were dropped off in front of the Palazzo and could walk right in. 

They were friendly, and almost empty at 9:30 on Labor Day Monday. Seated right away in a chilly booth table with a window over the strip.

The food: fabulous. I think the trick is knowing how and what to order. We steered clear of the appetizer section, which just seemed like an easy road list to fat and broke. No thanks.

I also noticed the menu had some slightly different options than the one I saw online, I was happy about that. We started with the raw market veggie salad ($13?) with aged cheddar and the black bean soup ($9). I could have been happy with just that, I was practically full!

We then moved on to the Coconut Crusted Snapper and the Magic Mushroom Papardelle ($21). Omigod. The flavors. The fish was atop a bed of steamed rice in a creamy curry sauce (perfect spice level) and the truffle oil with the beautifully cooked mushrooms in the pasta was to die for. 

We really would have been content to skip the club and just go back and revel in our stuffed glory after that meal. 

The drinks (the cotton candy martini - $15 and one of the little liquors -$5) were a little sweet for my taste. The food was amazing, and though more expensive than I prefer, it was still a touch more modest than the slew of $$$$ restaurants littered around the strip.

Like I said, Craig R. written all over it!

Located in The Palazzo Hotel, First Food & Bar is large, dimly lit joint with a cool, relaxing vibe. 

As you can tell from what I ordered above, this place is all about tricked out comfort foods. Everything we ate was amazing. EVERYTHING!
My favorite two items were the Doritos Mac (obviously) and the Main Line Philly. The Mac was super cheesy and flavorful and the Doritos gave it an extra cheesy, crispy element.  The Philly was HUGE and delicious. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and the Foie gave it an extra, fatty, buttery taste. It was also covered in Foie mayo, sweet onions, balsamic glaze and Tartuffo Whiz, all of which made this one of the best tasting Philly's I've ever had, even though I had to eat it with a knife and fork. And I got to give a quick shout out to the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=01F_4bCqJ9_EtE1fO9QSAw. It was fantastic.     

My only beef with First Food is the pricing. I'm NEVER one to complain about the price of food, especially when it's amazing, but for five small (but super tasty) Philly Dumplings it was almost twenty bucks. The Main Line Philly was over thirty. Our entire bill was almost a hundred bucks (with tip and no beverages), which seemed a bit too much. The service is great though, so that's a plus. 

Overall, I really, really enjoyed my experience at First Food & Bar. The food was outstanding, as was the service. I can't wait to go back and try some of their delicious sounding desserts.",YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg,17,16,4,HytNcYAQcEdUVlp_s77NcQ

-Mojito Lamb Chops, were the best items of the evening, cool flambe action, but a bit sweet and sticky. 
-Beef Carpaccio, yuck, too much creamy white unnecessary sauce. 
-Lobster rolls, nice presentation, lobster seemed faux & the rolls were dry. 
-Opa was one of the specials of the night, specially DISCOUNTED from the local fish market. It was bad, like overcooked, fishy bad.  Flavorless, the fish I had from ROOM SERVICE blew First's out of the water.

Ordered:
Filet Mignon- with mushroom crepe and poor man's porcinni

The menu items always sound enticing. There are always so many things I want to eat here. But I've always left disappointed. The wings were ok, but not good enough to even finish (a little too greasy and fatty). Though, the blue cheese (which was served warm) was excellent. The truffle fries were just overwhelmed by bad truffle oil. The mac 'n' cheese topped with Doritos was interesting, but not worth a repeat eat. The expensive truffle and foie gras cheesesteak was a failure of epic proportions. And just how is it that you can manage to make a wedge salad taste bad? The pretzels and dipping sauces are the best thing here. And don't even get me started on the cocktails. Just stick with the beer list.

I love the set-up and decor. It's a great spot. It's exactly what you would want out of a 24-hour place in an upscale casino. It's just dark enough. It's just large enough. And it has an excellent bar area (my preferred seating section). It can be way too loud sometimes, though.

The food was pretty tasty, although nothing spectacular. It's definitely as advertised- american food, kicked up a few notches and served with attitude. Literally, our server was kind of a Richard throughout the entire meal. The guy tried to sell us on the most expensive items ALL NIGHT. No, I don't want a 30 dollar margarita. No, I don't want the most expensive main meal, I don't care how good you say it is. I mean this guy REALLY tried to sell everything, and seemed to have an attitude when we refused and ordered what we wanted. Oh well, it's his tip.
The atmosphere was pretty fun, a big wide open area, with lots of TV's all tuned to sports.  Lots of metal and flames. The hostesses were very nice, and the other servers seemed to be very cool, and they were all dressed like car mechanics. Whatever.
The food was fairly decent. Nothing overly spectacular, but good tasting, and I definitely got full. Had the sliders, which were cooked up nice and juicy and topped with lots of fresh veggies.

We had the Cotton Candy Kiss, which is a delicious cocktail served in a martini glass rimmed with crushed life savers.  There's a piece of blue cotton candy in the glass, and you pour your own martini shaker of delicious liquor over it.  They give you a nice helping (about 1.5 glasses worth) of liquor so it's a pretty good deal for $12 not to mention deliciously sweet.

They brought out these pretzels when we sat down at our booth overlooking the strip.  There were 3 dipping mustards.  It was super delicious and perfectly paired with our Cotton Candy Kisses.

It was a short walk from the Wynn but oddly difficult to find in the Palazzo. My friend mentioned to me that the layout of this mall makes it difficult for restaurants to get business because customers don't know where they're located. Well, we came on a Tuesday night around 9pm, so it would be relatively empty. We ordered our drinks and while we were waiting, our server brings us the bread basket, which was pretzel bread with 3 variants of mustard: spicy, honey, and whole grain. The menu had a grungy rock 'n roll pub look, complete with tongue-in-cheek humor: one hot dog entree is described as 'Have you seen my 12"" Weiner?'--fully loaded, can you take it? 12 inches for $12"". Food options ranged from pub grub, diner classics, Grandma's Italian comfort food, and pan-Asian. Something for everyone, even your discerning old school Asian clientele.

My friend ordered the Oven Roasted Free Range Chicken and I decided to get the Dr. Pepper BBQ St. Louis Ribs. My entree arrives in an oven bag and comes with a side of cheesy grits and a couple of handy wipes. You have to tear the bag open to reveal its smoked contents. The ribs are so tender, they slide off the bone, a good sign. You don't even have to pick them up. You can be civilized and use a knife and fork like your momma taught you. The grits were out of this world! To be fair, I don't eat grits often. I associate them with the instant variety, with a sand-like grainy texture. These grits were were delectably buttery and creamy, much like polenta. My friend enjoyed her chicken entree as well. The portions were so generous, we couldn't finish them. And believe me, I was famished--my last meal was at the airport at 6am EST and it was 9pm PST!

Drinks were delicious but not potent. Lynch's Lemonade (Seagram's Sweet Tea, Absolut, Lemonade) packed the punch of a Mike's Hard Lemonade. I should have heeded our server's advice and ordered the Cucumber Gimlet (Hendrick's, cucumber, lime). They had some delicious-sounding seasonal drinks but were out of whipped cream, so my friend had to make another selection. She tends to favor stronger drinks so maybe she had better luck than I did.

My portion of the bill came to $40 excluding tip. While it wasn't the best meal we had that week, the fact that it's open late, has generous portions, and is reasonably priced makes it a good value (for the Strip, anyway).

WIth the new onslaught of chefs that dot the strip with foie gras, FIrst Food stands out as totally quirky with its reworked classics.  You don't have to worry about ordering a $50 plate thinking steak, only to have a two inch slice of beef with a prettily painted plate arrive.

2439177,2009-08-13,0,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"An electic gastropub-meets-urban-diner gem at a 5 star hotel/casino (the Palazzo) on the Strip -- a modernized version of the one opened in the early 1990s in NYC that was frequented by celebrity chefs like Wolfgang Puck.

If the service wasn't so aggressively over-attentive, I would have gone back a second time (solo) during my week-long recent stay in Vegas for work.  Excellent bang-for-your-buck kind of place.

It took a long time to decide what we wanted to eat, especially considering it took a good few minutes for the waiter to go through all the specials.  The dinner menu is extensive, and most of the portions are a hearty appetizer size - no matter which part of the menu you order from.  Definitely would be fun to go with a large group of people in order to split a variety of things.  It's nice to not have huge, overbearing, expensive dishes on the menu, though -- after all, my colleague and I were full from splitting an appetizer and ordering our own main courses.  Of course, we also were given free fresh soft pretzels to start, served with various types of mustards.

What's neat about the menus is that there are separate ones for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  However, the prices don't suddenly double from the lunch menu to the dinner one -- if the same thing is on more than one menu, it's the same price.  

We went for dinner and though tempted by the Philly cheesesteak dumplings with siracha ketchup, we split the duck tamales in ranchero sauce instead for $8.88.  The two tamales were generously sized and chock full of braised duck meat, which was a pleasant surprise.  Usually you have to poke around in tamales to find the meat.  Not here.  And the ranchero sauce on the side definitely had a good spicy kick, great for dipping.  A winner.

My colleague chose one of the specials, a chicken-plantain dish that he said was excellent.  He was skeptical of the place but was raving about how good the food was - and I believe his dish was only $11.  I chose a menu item, the black cod lobsternada ($16.99) - with roast asparagus in a vegetable boullion.  Two hunks of black cod filet, extremely moist and flaking (they cooked it *just* until it was done, but not a second longer), and strong hints of cucumber and celery in that broth.  It reminded me of a similar dish at Le Bernadin in NYC, but without the tasso ham flavor, and a much bigger portion.  It was a lot of food!

This will be a definite stop every time I come back to Vegas (hopefully the service will be less aggressive by the time I come back next year, but it's not enough to ward me away from this place).  It will satisfy both foodies and those seeking comfort food without hurting the wallet.  Got to try some items off the late night menu too (Kentucky fried pork chop with sunny side up eggs on top, over creamy grits, biscuits & gravy, anyone?)  The place seems like a fancy, high end place until you see the bar with sports on the flatscreens...the silly jokes all over the menu...and the prices.  That pork chop breakfast dish is called, for example, ""The Midwest Killer"" :).

P.S.  We didn't have to ask for the complimentary pretzels; they automatically gave them to us prior to our meal.",MCDwKJOOiMyhJKC86kHJmw,1,1,4,KyraxYkAThGF8s3JirXjfA

I ordered their Famous Lollipop Buffalo Wings and dude, they were bangin!  Didn't really feel like eating much so I just started getting recommendations on drinks from the bartenders.  The bartenders are awesome!  Down to earth and super friendly!  Cynthia was awesome to talk to and super sweet.  She was testing out some recipes of her own and let me try some.  It was awesome!  We named it Cynthia's Sweet Juice.  Not sure if it will stick, but they have some awesome names for their cocktails there.  Michael seemed to have been one of the masterminds behind most of them and gave me a rundown of most of their list.  I actually ended up trying almost all of them!

First Food & Bar was definitely a place we wanted to try, especially since a friend of ours went ahead and tried the place and not only gave it a good review, sent tantalizing pictures.

First Food is located inside between the Palazo and the Venetian along the gondala canal. Right next to the Barney's New York store on the second level of the Palazo.

Our party of 4 got seated in a booth along the window facing the strip and the big Palazo marquee. The view was great and definitely added to the ambiance of restaurant. Since it was a Sunday night, we didn't indulge in any cocktails. Our friend (the junky one that went here before the rest of us) did mention the cotton candy cocktail, which is backed up by many yelpers here.

My friend and I were ready to have a realy grub moment so we each got an appetizer. I went with the yelpers choice of ""Mojito Lamb Chops"" and my friend went with the huge bacon wrapped shrimp.

The lamp chops are flambeed table side when they serve it, so there definitely is a ""wow"" factor. I did a pieced of the lamb chop back into the sauce after it was served and wow...it most definitely has 151 in it!

The bacon wrapped shrimp was perfect and if I do say so myself, LA can use some bacon wrapped shrimp carts next to the hot dog ones outside of clubs and sporting events!

For the main course I got the Shrimp Diablo, and my friends got Cubano sandwich, and the Trout respectively. The shrimp diablo was served with eggplant which make my mouth absolutely happy! The heat from the sauce was a perfect blend of spice but not too hot that you would need a pitcher of water to calm our burnt taste buds.

My friends were pretty happy with their choices..but I think it was dessert that pushed us over the edge. 

I decided to do a throw back to my childhood and ordered the push pop (yes just like the ones with the flintstone characters on it), while my friends went with the molten chocolate cake, and the s'mores,

The push pop was, well a push pop. It was a very tangy sorbet that really cleansed my palate after eating very savory food. The molten cake was pure chocolate goodness. The s'mores on the other hand...just fucking amazing. The graham crackers on the bottom could have been a little more moist, but ugh..the whole thing was just too amazing. The toasted marshmallows on top..just made my mouth happy!

First Food & Bar is one of those unique places in Vegas where you shell out a decent amount of money (not super cheap, but not super outrageous buffet prices either) but actually get great ambiance and food in return. 

My friends and I foregone the Sunday morning buffets in exchange for less variety and more realistic portion sizes. Server was a little on the creepy/awkward side, but the food was fabulous. The decor reminded me of Diane von Furstenberg meets MetroPark - touches of feminine print meets urban edge. 

Breakfast Boxes gave you a variety of options including sandwiches, make-your-own omelets, salads, and traditional breakfast flair. A side of fresh fruit is served depending on your entree. 

Our table featured: 
* Smoke Salmon Scramble NY  Egg ""Sam""wich served w/ fresh fruit bowl
* Custom Omelet w/ Mozzarella, Oven dried tomatoes, and Chorizo served w/ fresh fruit bowl & a slice of bread pudding-ish thing
*Bag of sugar donuts - complimentary 
* Salmon-I-Am Endive Salad

ALL were delicious!  FIRST has earned its place in my permanent Vegas book!

He opted for rare and that's what he got, although I can't complain about the size of the steak, fries that were serves with it were shoestring and they were okay.

Not really knowing exactly what we were looking for as far as food, we walked to The Shoppes at The Palazzo and stumbled upon First Food & Bar. The inside is huge and there is a spacious bar and the ambiance was very friendly and inviting.

There was a DJ playing hip hop, dance music and my personal favorite...'ITS THE REMIX TO IGNITION, HOT AND FRESH OUT THA KITCHEN' hahah jk ;) (whatever, you know you secretly love that song) I immediately knew I was in for a very different brunch experience than I was normally used to, haha. Perfect to start the birthday celebration!

The menu consisted of brunch staples like eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles, chicken & waffles, pizzas, and breakfast burritos. They also had tons of options for smaller plates and munchies like tator tots and buffalo wings. We ordered:

-Traditional Eggs Benny with Homefries, $19
-Two-Handed BLTA Sandwich, $19
-Grilled Grandma Style Pizza, basically a Margherita pizza, $14
-Your ""First"" Threesome with Homefries, like an eggs benedict but with biscuits, BBQ pork, cheddar cheese, and spicy hollandaise sauce, $18
-Unlimited Champagne Fountain for Mimosas, $10

I had the traditional eggs benny and it was A LOT of food! It was so delicious and I especially loved the homefries - potatoes with onions and peppers. I really tried my best to finish everything but I just couldn't - felt a little sad about that. The boyfriend had the ""First"" Threesome and absolutely LOVED it, haha. I tried a bite of it and it had tons of flavor! I definitely recommend both! My friends had the BLTA sandwich which was HUGE and was definitely perfect for leftovers; Grilled Grandma Style Pizza was with a thin crust and my friend loved the fresh basil and sauce.

Our server was really sweet, attentive, and fun; definitely kept the party going by always making sure we had enough champagne for mimosas. I would definitely recommend First Bar and Food - really fun menu and an equally fun atmosphere in a beautiful hotel!",3HHLpfU7q4HoREEOXtt7pw,3,1,4,YWRQwIq0HgdVmIQDZa_iDw

2938247,2012-04-06,0,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"When I saw this restaurant did not have more star power, it made my heart sink a little bit. Now, I went to First for brunch with two very hungry, crabby (not really, but let's go with it) tourists who came to visit the fiance and I. I've heard plenty of great things about First and know how popular his restaurant is in Chicago, so we decided to branch out and try something new. Happiness ensured. Life was good.

Right when I came to the table we were greeted by a gorgeous blonde server who was smiling at us (even though she had probably been there for 4 hours already) and taking our drink orders. Do you need to even ask madam? Because I saw a champagne fountain and a CART OF BLOODY MARY'S ROLLING AROUND THE RESTAURANT STARING AT ME FROM EVERY ANGLE. In order to avoid starting me day off hard, I somehow resisted the Bloody Mary cart (complete with Slim Jim sticks mind you) and went for the neverending champagne/mimosa deal for yes, only $10. The wonderful server never left our glasses empty...ever, which completely threw my desire to start off light in the morning out the window immediately. Thankfully, the food came. Oh, the food came.

Of course, my friend had to order Your ""First"" Threesome. Yes, the quotation marks were on the menu. LOVE IT. His wonderful girlfriend ordered the French Dippity Do (it made my day just hearing it ordered), my fiance went with a safe order of fish and chips and I made my own omelette with smoked salmon, gruyere cheese and spinach. The food came almost instantaneously. Now, that may be the champagne talking, but when the food hit the table I think I started to drool. A LOT. I had enough food on my plate to feed a small country. My friend's ""First"" Threesome looked like a threesome that I would enjoy every morning for the rest of my life (ZING!), his girlfriend's Dippity Do came out with a BOAT of gravy and brisket poruing out of a golden brown challah bun and my fiance's fish and chips was great on presentation and even had the malt vinegar in a little squeeze bottle. Yes, I love anything that is mini. 

Everyone devoured their food in minutes while the server continued to pour us champagne to a point where I'm not sure who paid the bill. No, actually, it was not the champagne that did this, it was the tender, fluffy, smoky omelette I ate in two seconds. Best part? The cheese was a perfect ratio to what else was in the omelette...not overwhelming or overly gooey. I like my arteries to remain open for a bit. The brisket sandwich made all of these wonderful memories of good Southern BBQ swim through my mind. Now, there is nothing like AUTHENTIC Southern BBQ, but this came close enough for me to want to forgo my gluten intolerance for just one bit. The fiance enjoyed his fish and chips while I continued to stare at his mini vinegar bottle and then I saw my friend's Threesome. My friends, decadence and an all around brilliant way to start your long day of drinking is that threesome. Pun aside, that threesome was a thing of glory, and it is a crime if you ignore its powers.

So as you can tell by this novel, I loved First. I adore it. I will go there again, maybe even next weekend. The price is a little hefty, but if I can sit in that chill environment with great food, good service and surrounded by the ones you love, can you ask for much more? 

P.S. If you do not like a live DJ playing some old and new school jams on Sunday morning for brunch, don't go here. If you don't like some Top 40's with a little old school for lunch, don't go here. If you don't like the music you hear as you walk by, don't go here and let the rest of us get fat off of this decadent food.

P.P.S. The management there was great, came and spoke to the table and was very friendly. If you don't like the service or there is an issue, talk to them, they WANT TO KNOW.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,2,0,5,Fct1uo5GQXzsfgF_c_9tuQ

2967246,2012-04-03,0,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"Pros: Nice decor and good vibe.

Cons:  Food, and staff.

The decor is nice, but that's typical of any restaurant in a large Vegas hotel so I can't give much credit for that.  When we arrived, I thought it odd that there were very few people in the place.  However it's very clear to me now.  This place is on the way out.

The food was ok for an everyday restaurant, but absolutely lousy considering the prices we paid.  I can guarantee that due to their declining clientele, they aren't making anything fresh anymore.  Despite the rave reviews from years past, the mac and cheese is awful.  Avoid at all costs.  The chips were stale, and the cheese was premade and reheated to a goopy consistency.  Took two bites and politely pushed it aside.  My Cuban sandwich was mushy and lukewarm, but I did manage to eat half of it.  A good waiter would have noticed that people weren't eating their food, but I'll get to that next.

Our waiter ""Dan"" according to the receipt was a real jerk.  He started off sort of hurried, but polite.  I'd best describe him as forgetful, rude, and dismissive.  We had a group size that meant he got his 20% no matter what, and he clearly didn't care if he got repeat customers for his place of employment.  I actually didn't know how bad it was until our group left and started talking about the dinner in the hallway.  BTW, we were all 30+ year old couples, not a group of guys or something obnoxious.  I'll review the highlights of Dan's comments from the evening:

Situation 1:  When we first sat down, Dan started our drinks and said they were out of their usual bread, but they were heating up something else for us.  He repeated that statement after he took our food order.  After receiving our food, he was walking by and a girl two seats from me at the end of the table flagged him down and asked if he was still bringing the bread.  Dan was visibly irritated and replied, ""oh, did you still want that?"".  REALLY?  He brought us a dinner plate with some supermarket biscuits on it.  Lovely.

Situation 2:  The guy across from me wasn't sure what he wanted when the rest of us placed our drink orders.  So he ordered a beer when Dan was taking food orders.  I heard him ask for it it, and saw the waiter acknowledge it.  It never came, so he politely asked about the beer later when he saw Dan after the food came out.  He said, ""excuse me, I ordered a Budda beer"".  Dan quickly snapped, ""not from me you didn't""  REALLY?

Situation 3:  Two ladies at the end of my table were sharing a mac and cheese.  It was completely cold, but Dan was MIA.  When he finally came back to our table to check on us they asked if he could take it back and reheat it.  In a snotty tone Dan retorts, ""Well, you should have told me earlier.""  REALLY?

I didn't learn about the last issue until we were all congregating in the hall after dinner.  We were all really irritated after learning about all the drama issues various people had with Dan, especially since nobody said anything to him.  We all wanted to have a good time (doesn't everybody in Vegas?), so nobody wanted to speak up when it was happening.  In summary, this place is a major fail.  It's empty for a reason, and I'm sure this is a big part of it.",5bhWNp0sSZ_rWodlHYKFjA,2,0,1,NHS8kANXNc3cv8IIhFHRvw

Not b/c it was terrible or the service was bad, but it left us with a bit to be desired and we ended up eating at Burger bar the following day and that place is..... Read my review if you wanna know.

We must have walked around for the better part of an hour looking for this place. Of course, if you do what we did, which is follow the arrow on the signs at the entrance, you will end up walking through the casino, dropping a 20 on the roulette table simply b/c you saw 6 red numbers come up and you figured that another red couldn't possibly hit. You were right, but you still lost b/c the dreaded double zero bit you in the ass. So, we finally find the place and it was empty, which usually is a bad sign but we were starving so we sat down. The location is actually pretty smooth. The staff is working, don't get me wrong, but they are laughing, joking around and having fun. What a concept, right??

The skinny fries were not all that good and we didn't order from the drink menu b/c well, we don't drink.

3052345,2009-10-07,0,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"Wow, I have to say I was impressed! 

First Food and Bar is a darkly-lit, lounge-type of restaurant, with a large panoramic window overlooking the Strip, tucked away in an odd wing of the Palazzo.  

When we walked up, we were seated immediately.  My friend and I were in quite a hurry, but the service was prompt.  We had two different servers, it seemed like, but we only saw one at a time.  Normally this would make it so that we'd have to repeat ourselves to get our real meal, but they worked in tandem pretty well, so no complaints in that department.  Since I had to go to work, I didn't partake of anything alcoholic, and instead got a bottled soda that was good, but entirely over-priced.  I should've stuck to water.  

But food!  Oh the food.  The menu was like what you'd see at a hole-in-the-wall bar, but with much more upscale (and dare I say, creative) ingredients.  We were treated to a free piece of pretzel bread, along with three different kinds of mustard.  Each was delicious in its own way, and very-well complemented the pretzel bread.  I cannot concur with my fellow yelpers about the freshness (or lack thereof) of the pretzel.  This was the right mix of chewy and soft that you expect from a salty pretzel.  Maybe the people who weren't impressed expected an Auntie Anne's style pretzel-shaped soft-breadstick?  

We had the Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings, and they were great.  A great and unique combination, and very creative.  I recommend those.  For the entree, I had the filet, with mushroom and crepes, and I absolutely loved it.  The meat was cooked exactly as I wanted it, and the mushrooms were earthy and sweet, and worked well with the crepes.  I wanted to lick the plate at the end after all that!  And for a paltry $18.99, probably one of the cheapest filets I've ever had.  

The most distracting thing was the huge, bright, Palazzo advertising sign which kept shining into the building the whole night.  

We got our check quickly, and left with a smile.  I liked it!  Overall, if you want a nice upscale but casual place to take some friends for a chat and some drinks, First is a great place to go.

We had finished seeing Le Reve and were feeling ready to get our noms on. We wandered upon a very empty First Food & Bar. As the boy says, ""That should have been our first clue.""
We sat in the bar area and ordered our drinks while perusing the very enticing-sounding menu. He got a Stella and I got the Tiger's Blood (really, just based on the humor principle). Obviously, anything named Tiger's Blood is going to be a bit crazy to order... way too sweet to drink while eating. That really was just my mistake, as our server Stacy asked me if I cared for it after seeing me barely drinking it. The fact that she was willing, throughout the whole meal in fact, to try to make the experience pleasurable is enough to merit two stars. However...
We ordered the fish and chips, the lobster chowder and the chicken sandwich. Fish and chips were super-greasy, and not even in the ""OMG I'm so drunk, this is amazing"" type of way.... more in the ""OMG I am going to be so sick from both ends later"" type of way. The chicken sandwich probably would have been tasty had the bread not been COMPLETELY blackened and tasting like charcoal. Seriously gross, since the taste rubbed off on the chicken, making it useless to even remove the bread to enjoy the insides. The lobster chowder was probably the best thing... marginally so, as it was so oily that I was trying to maneuver the spoon around the slicks on top of the soup.
Again, Stacy (SUCH a sweetie) asked us if we wanted anything else instead. We dumbly opted to try to salvage what was left in front of us... but seriously, guys?

That included a ridiculously large portion of greasy home fries that were irresistible. Drinks were plentiful. I had the Skittle martini (I chose orange, my favorite flavor of the candy). It was sweet and satisfying enough. 

The staff is friendly and the waitresses don skimpy Britney Spears-esque school girl outfits that are, well, just odd. But our waitress was very attentive and helpful when making menu decisions. The food came out fast as well. The decorum left a bit to be desire, it was a typical bar type of vibe with a somewhat entertaining view of the strip.

We got so lost trying to find First Food from the Venetian because we tried going the inside way... ridiculous. So much easier to get to the restaurant from the outside.

Our server was awesome and super patient. No one was bothered by the rowdiness of our group, but I guess it helped that the bar made hella money off of us... At the end of the meal, our server was willing to split our check which is always appreciated - makes figuring out the bill for a large group so much easier. 

Decor is nice and there is a photo booth inside the restaurant - woohoo!

We shared a pitcher of the red velvet sangria - really tasty but was sad to not see any actual fruit chunks. A pitcher poured out a pretty good number of glasses though - bang for your buck!

We shared the buffalo chicken lollipops, falafel chopped salad, and tator tots. The falafel chopped salad had a lot of bold flavors but it was on the salty side - maybe the cheese, or the dressing? The falafel ""croutons"" were cute and tasty though. The buffalo chicken lollipops were tasty and the tator tots were deliciously crispy on the outside.

The hits of the meal were definitely the lollipop buffalo wings and the mini sliders (which were actually quite decently sized).  The buffalo wings were tender and flavored perfectly and the mini slider patties were cooked juicy with a light and fluffy bun.

-Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings: Very tasty, served with a sriracha ketchup to add a little heat =)
-Lollipop Buffalo Wings: Tasty, but a much larger order than I anticipated. Be ready to share!!
-Lobster Chowder: Not too impressed with this dish.  It's super big (which helps justify the price), but not as flavorful as I expected. I'd pass on this.
-Tater tots with cheese (can't remember the type, but very flavorful) and truffle oil!: This dish was big on flavor and on fun! Crisp tots, nice gourmet cheese, and the punch of truffles. Yes, please.

They have happy hour with 2 for 1 Stella Artois', and are glad to accomodate you if you order a bunch of them at 6:59 :-)

As for the food it's pretty good.  I've had the chicken paillard and spaghetti & meatballs and enjoyed both.  The menu choices are not the healthiest but that's not really why you go there

I passed by it several occasions since then and I always think to myself that I need to try it out already.

Well when I finally decide that today was the day to give this a place a shot, I couldn't find it for the life of me! It's more on the Venetian side, across from where the gondola loading dock, or whatever you call it is located.

Nice, big space with windows overlooking the strip. It was the weekend so we were looking at their brunch menu. We all opted for bottomless champagne and added OJ for $17 a piece and ordered a few different items.

The Cuban sandwich was one of the best and meatiest Cuban sandwiches I've ever had. These are pretty basic sandwiches so quality and amounts of ingredients really make or break a good Cuban. The presentation was kinda sloppy but that's okay, it tasted great.

The Philly cheesesteak was made with rib-eye and was drizzled with a balsamic glaze. Not your typical cheesesteak but one of the best I've had as well. Don't let it sit and get cold, the taste was not that great when it's not warm.

I was really stoked to see Doritos Mac and cheese on the menu but when it came out, it looked like a scoop of Mac and cheese and crumbles of Doritos in a mini iron skillet. I was disappointed to see that the mac and cheese was gooey all around--I prefer the kind that has a crusted-cheese top layer.

The service was great, our server never let our champagne glasses reach below half full and the GM came around to make sure everything was good and chatted with us for a bit. We were camping out for at least a couple hours and never felt like we overstayed our welcome.

A fine dining ingredient meets its match with the rough and tumble tater from the Midwest, but how does it work. The next unlikely duo was the mac n' cheese with crushed Doritos on top. You either just said, ""mmmmm"" or ""eeewww"" but that reaction and innovation on many of the items will keep me coming back.

 If you still aren't done drinking they also offer a late night happy hour.",0QdwQLVxZpgy9Qb2Qakflw,3,4,4,Ki5R9FAGBc_4sbD0lyWpRQ

The presentation of everything was amazing!! We had the Doritos mac n cheese  they were not as exciting as everyone put them out to be. Nothing special.

They were not busy enough to excuse the inattentiveness of our server (young, dark-haired female, will leave her name out but we were seated in the bar area on this past Sunday afternoon, December 2nd)...she came to take our drink order which was only coffee and water.  She asked if we took cream and sugar, then said she would give us a minute to look at the menu. We made a very obvious show of displaying we were ready to order and not only did she not come back to our table for over 15 minutes, she literally walked back and forth between the two tables on either side of us.  It took 20 minutes to get our coffees, cream was brought to the table but no sugar.  We tried to get her attention to no avail, my friend actually had to go up and get sugar and our previously requested waters from the bartender.  We were just discussing whether or not to walk out when she finally came back to the table to take our food orders.  Those showed up within a somewhat acceptable time frame but she still took her time coming back to check up on us.  We finished our food and were so anxious to leave that when she finally took a break from her socializing with the group of college kids next to us, that my friend didn't even ask her for the check.  He just handed her his card and asked her to run it.  

She took the card and brought us the check back with the card, WITHOUT running the card...

We should have just walked out then.  She completely failed at doing her job and that was her own fault, but we waited even longer so that we could point out the mistake to her.  She responded that she did run the card, just forgot to grab the receipt for my friend to sign.  She ran off, came back and then admitted that she hadn't run the card, so now she had to take the card AGAIN and actually swipe it this time.

She came back again with an excuse as to why she messed up but at that point, we didn't care and just really wanted to get out of there.  This girl should be working at Denny's, not here.  

The bar itself is cool but the quality of food is not worth the price you pay.  It was just ok.  Would never go out of my way to go here again, there are too many other places to eat.",zdpjigelIZ9RAa6mvFtKog,3,0,1,6ot8Uf1IQ7nj9VQAmfqsxQ
3534725,2010-10-06,3,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"I love fried food, and it is usually pretty difficult to screw up fried food but First succeeded at screwing up the easiest thing to cook in the culinary world, Fried Food.

We started off with the chicken tenders as an appetizer. They came out with this really tasty horseradish ranch, but the chicken was wayyyyyyy overcooked and dried out. Say you dropped a piece of chicken in the fryer without any batter or breading and let it sit in there for maybe 10-15 minutes, you know what would happen?  Yeah, dried, crusty, flavorless chicken breast meat.  This was the $15 appetizer that the server recommended. 

For our meal I ordered the Bada Bing. Disgusting.  At the moment a fried piece of homemade lasagna  with fresh mozzarella, marinara, and fresh basil sounded like a wonderful idea. Wow, was I wrong.  The bun that it came on tasted like a bun that your 1st grade cafeteria lady with a mole on her nose would serve you with a sloppy joe or a piece of frozen salisbury steak with powdered gravy.  Gross. The lasagna in a sandwhich is just a bad idea. really messy and lacking any flavor.  Needless to say, I took 2 bites and left the rest on my plate.

My friend ordered the Cuban sandwhich, which had 2 types of pork, roasted pork and ham, with dijon, and pickles on a flat bread which was then pressed. He ordered it with no pickles but the server replied, ""They have those premade so we can't do that""  Are you F-ing kidding me. For a $19 sandwhich you can't take out the freakin' pickles?  The sandwhich had good flavor but the shear fact that they would not give him what he wanted is just bad customer service.

For $90 you could eat a much better meal that is healthy and well put together with good service at probably any other restaurant in Vegas.

So first of all the pork eggrolls were really awesome.  The dr pepper sauce, with cole slaw was a hit with the table.  The philly cheese steak potstickers were a bit odd, but different.  You dont expect the taste it was unique.  The meatballs were served with a crustini and fried egg.  Together was perfect, but if you at it piece by piece it was a bit bland.  The lolipops just tasted like normal wings, and the walnut shrimp was a bit disappointing. The entrees included the Philly cheese steak, the cuban sandwhich, the steak and fries, and the special as the steak oscar.  Everything was pretty eh.  The sandwiches were very bland, but the steak oscar as good.  My sister really enjoyed it.  The bes part was desert, in which we ordered the monkey bread.  It was warm and sweet and awesome.

Me and a friend got a little of everything, planning on taking leftovers back.  Chicken fingers, fish and chips, a pepperoni pizza, and fries.

The chicken fingers were a bit bland.  No special flavor, a little overcooked, and dry.  They are served with 3 dipping sauces: a sweet chili sauce (a bit weak), ranch (I don't eat), and barbecue (tasted like soap had been put in it).  The fish looked great.  Giant pieces of really high quality fish (cod?), but the taste was more plain and fishier than any fried fish I've ever had before.  Thicker breading or thinner cuts of fish would have been a lot better.  The chips are called ""steak fries"" on the menu, but each one is basically 1/4 of a potato.  They are very large and very good.  The pizza was awesome, very thin crust and a great taste.  It's served with shakers of parmesan, red pepper flakes, and oregano, but honestly it's not necessary.  The only bad thing about the pizza is that it's served in a large glass bowl and so the grease accumulates and makes the crust soggy.  Even with soggy crust it's great though.  The fries are still good, with the perfect crunch and perfect amount of saltiness.

It was supposed to be $39 for a five course meal, but our waitress comped us one dinner because it took a while for the prime rib to arrive. The three of us were having so much fun that we didn't notice the delay, so we thought it was gracious of the restaurant to offer a discount. They didn't have to do that.

First Food's management personalized our dinner by dropping by to say hello. I am easily wooed by face-to-face interactions like that. I love getting to know the people behind the business. Our waitress was on top of her game even though the place was packed. She was happy and so were her coworkers. I like the wait staff uniforms, which go well with tattoos.

First Food is trendy, but not snobby, and the food is a perfect blend of casual and classy. The decor blends retro, biker, modern. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I was there on a special occasion and didn't try any of their regular menu items.

My fiancee and I went to check this place out at lunch time and we were right on time for happy hour (which is 3 to 7 daily) and I gladly took advantage of the 2 for 1 draft beers to start off.  I had asked for 2 different draft beers and the waitress told me that I can only have 2 of the exact same beers no exception (supposedly a policy that even she thought was dumb).  I gave her a o_0 look and said, ""that's okay just get me 2 of whatever you suggest"".  I wasn't going to be too picky about it because all in all beer is beer and they all help you to reach the same endpoint haha.  To my surprise, she found a way to get me my 2 different beers.  I'm not sure what that means but I would be okay with whatever either or.  I decided to get the Tuna nachos appetizer, the Tuna Melt, and my fiancee got the catfish tacos.  The Tuna Melt was pretty standard but instead of being sandwiched together, I got each bun separately; the presentation was definitely a first.  My fiancee's tacos were pretty good actually (mainly in favor of how spicy the tacos were) and I ended up eating one of her three tacos for myself.  The real goody here was the Tuna Nachos which included raw Tuna poke, mango chunks, and tomatoes (?) all served on plantain chips (not the regular nacho chips).  The flavors mixed well and I enjoyed their interesting twist on the conventional idea of the standard nacho dish.  The portions were smaller than I expected for the price BUT I did realize we were on the strip so that's exactly what I was expecting.  If it wasn't for the beers, I probably would have stopped at Fresh & Easy on the way home for snacks lol!  We rarely saw our waitress(only when she'd pass by to wait on the next table over) so the service was sub-par and they didn't have toothpicks for our post-meal recovery which was odd but oh well.

The decor of the restaurant prepares you for a unique experience and we found the hostess and the waitress to be very engaging with the table. Perhaps these two above average components made the food appear to be a let-down for our group. 

The table was served complimentary Pretzels with 3 different sauces - which I found all tasted too similar - heavy on the dijon mustard flavor. 

I ordered the Fish & Chips which was recommended by the waitress but found it lacking in flavor. The chips where covered in horseradish which I understood as trying to give some additional flavor, but I found too over-powering. 

I was able to try one of my friend's cheeseburger sliders - which was nothing unique in my opinion.

The Chicken & Dumpling was excellent. The chicken was tender and juicy, with lots of flavor and the dumpling was delicious too. My dad loved the soup base of the chicken and dumpling soup , that he finished the whole dish. 

The Salmon had grapefruit, lemon base to it. It was good! I love that the salmon just falls apart but was crispy at the bottom. It was just a really good fish. 

My mom was a fan of the clam chowder. It had real clam bits and brought out alot of the flavors that she liked. She likes the creamy, lots of clam, potatoes taste to it. She said this was the best one out of everywhere she's tried. 

I ordered the burrito with egg white subsitute. It was good, but I needed some spicyness. So, I asked for tobasco sauce and the waitress came out of with these CUTE miniature tobasco bottles!

I just love, love, love the concept of this restaurant. Picture a rock star having a baby with Wolfgang Puck and you get this little gem of a place. This place will not set you back $200 and it is totally non pretentious a plus in my book. But the view alone is worth much more than the meal, with an off the strip view of TI and the hustle and bustle of the strip. It had a great ambiance and music; it was so great hearing rock/alternative music instead of the BS elevator music or house music at other restaurants First is definitely the place to go to before going out to one of the many ultra clubs on the strip. The menu is huge and they serve breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night bites. The entire menu is so inventive and had combinations only a food genius would think of. The prices are fairly inexpensive with nothing over $20 and the majority of the plates between $10-15. 

I started of the meal with you guessed it a cocktail, I ordered the Cotton Candy Kiss. They serve this sweet concoction with a dollop of fluffy cotton candy in a martini glass and they pour the alcoholic elixir over the cotton candy. Not only is the cocktail tasty, they left the shaker they mixed the alcohol in at the table, so in essence it was pretty much drinking 2 1/2 glasses of sweet perfection. First Food & Bar was also the first place that I saw pretzels being served in lieu of the boring bread stick. The pretzels came with three dipping sauces, including honey mustard, a vinaigrette, and another sauce I can't think of. We started our meal with the Mojito Lamb Chops, which is lamb chops set ablaze with 151 and finished with a mint glaze. Soooo goood, flavorful and tender. This had to be the greatest lamb dish ever! We also ordered the Lobster Roll, which had huge buttery chunks of lobster on flaky buttery bread. This thing was addicting and I mean drool-like addiction. We finished the meal with what else inventive, but donuts. These were cake-like and fried to perfection and also came with three dipping sauces, caramel, chocolate and raspberry.

But instead I chose the following instead.   The GF mentioned this spot about the chef at this restaurant that seems to put odd combination of food items and married them together into an awesome tasting dish, so I was intrigued.

Got there here a lot of loud music and some odd small group of middle aged people attempting to dance next to the bar.  Imagine a skinny white guy with no rhythm doing the jig, yea...that time 10 people.  I'm glad the food was good.

Service: wonderful.  Had a really nice waitress that took our orders quickly was extremely gracious even after we turned back the Sangria.  I have to say, that I've had some sangria, and so far, this wasn't very good at all, especially an after taste of armpit.  But the manager even came by, checked on the reason why it tasted so bad, and comped the drink and gave us something else.  Really cool.

Food Ordered: 
Grilled Lamb Meatballs - if you like lamb and you like hummus, this is your thing, very tasty and comforting.  Meatballs were juicy and burst with middle eastern spices sitting on dabs of fresh hummus, diced tomatoes, olive oil and a thin pita bread slices. YUM YUM in my TUM TUM.

Blacked Skirt Steak - well seasoned and cooked to my specification, and cut into small bite-sized pieces, covered by two sunny side eggs, and sitting on top of a bed of chorizo hash and spicy cheddar cheese sauce. There are a lot ingredients and great amount of thought going into the dish and with every bite, you get a mouthful of flavor that bring you back to those old days when you got some nachos from the ice cream truck or your first nachos on a warm day at the ballpark, simply D-licious. 

Attack of the First Surf and Turf - certified angus beef, with deep fried lobster claw, sandwiched in a soft roll with all the fixin's and served with asparagus fries.  Sounds really great, looks awesome, but just tasted on par, nothing exceptions outside of the ingredients, but the GF did get full and had a smile on her face.

We had a large group, so we each ordered something different to share, the cinnabun french toast was extraordinary, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I fell in love with the chicken and waffles, who know such flavors meshed so well? We added a egg over easy and I have to tell yea I couldn't resist going in for more. The chicken, egg, waffles and syrup went together so well!

THE ORDER:
(Picts of ALL items ordered posted!!)
Original Mini Burgers-  4 stars. Solid cheeseburgers here. For slider-type burgers, they were little monsters! The meat was super succulent (ordered medium rare), the tomatoes and pickles were a perfect complement, and the bun was slightly sweet! Overall, I'd order these again. They would have received 5 stars had they been served piping hot.

Grandpa's Pizza- 5 stars. Simply wonderful. EXACTLY how i love my pizza. We added jalapeños to the robust pepperoni, which was a great decision. The crust is crispy and VERY thin, without being cracker-like. But, definitely crispy, in the RIGHT way: dense, chewy and crisp around the edges. Comes served with parmesan, chili flakes and oregano (FUCK YES!). This puppy was loaded with toppings....delish!

Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings: 3.25 stars. The flavors were all there, especially the mushroom. The dumplings seemed pan fried, with great texture. However, they were a bit oily. These were served with pepperocinis on top (as a garnish) and Sriracha Ketchup for dipping.

THE SERVICE:
4 stars- GREAT! Cute girls in little school girl, rocker-type outfits. Water and coffee was refilled often...no real complaints.

OTHER:
There is a live DJ spinning great music (at least when I went, which was Sunday at around noon).

OVERALL:
Great food, good service, awesome ambience.

I had a salad and the french onion soup, and it was really good.

One friend had a burger and said it was so so, our other friends shared the sliders and asiago cheese tater tots.

The reason I took off two stars is for the up sale the waiter put on them. First when asked what he recommended he picked three of the most expensive things on the menu, understandable enough your tip is based on the check amount. But when our friends ordered the tater tots he didn't mention that the asiago cheese on top was a separate charge (which the menu didn't explain either) and they were charged $ 7.00 extra. 

This place is just extremely expensive for what the food is actually worth. For four of us, not drinking, burger, sliders, soup and a salad the bill was over $ 100.00.",I5wB7MW-idjfgmbzliQEZw,1,0,3,s_KKYVVtTndpQrGn6MzNnA

MOJITO. LAMB. CHOPS.

Quite the new swanky scene in Vegas. Dim lights, upbeat tunes, gorgeous view of the strip...I was saddened to have had to leave early to meet a friend who landed a bit earlier than expected. However, we were able to stay long enough to enjoy my 1.5 glass of Cotton Candy Kiss. It was amusing watching the waiter pour the drink into my martini glass filled with a fluff of pink cotton candy as it melted away into red liquid courage. With an abundant amount of crushed Lifesaver candy coated around the rim, each sip was full of fruity sweetness. Perfectly portioned Grey Goose and juices, the drink delivered an awesome kick without the jolting taste of alcohol. Loved it!

Our waiter understood our situation and packed everything to go without any hesitation. Literally running back to our room so the food wouldn't get cold, we unpacked everything with a fork in hand and chowed down with the quickness.

The mojito lamb chops lived up to their reputation! Blanketed with a minty lime glaze, each bite was packed with intense flavor. I found the meat to be a tad tough, but I enjoyed the non-gamy taste of the lamb. With 3 fairly large cuts, this could be served more as an entree than an appetizer. Highly recommended to anyone who swings by First Food & Bar.

Accompanied with a side order of truffle mac and cheese, this was a delicious first meal in Vegas. Prices are very reasonable considering LV is known for raping everyone's wallet in every possible way.

This is supposed to be one of their signature appetizers, but I was definitely underwhelmed. $17 for this small basket of wings? I thought it would be a little more complex in flavor, but it tasted like wings I could get anywhere else for $0.50 per wing. I think Hooters or BW3 makes better wings.

Note to the chef - seasoning / flavoring the dish does not mean dumping a boatload of red chili flakes. This was so spicy that I couldn't really eat it or enjoy it.

The best dish of the night was my cousin's Mushroom Papardelle. It was swimming in butter and truffle oil, but at least it tasted good and was edible. We all ate this until there was nothing except 1 cup of melted butter and oil at the bottom of the bowl. Yum.

Our waiter took our drink order and after 2 false starts for beer because the keg needing ""tapping"", he finally brought a soda and beer to the table. After showing the one stop restaurant.com certificate, the waiter took it to the back and came back with our appetizer of soft pretzel sticks. Our meal was so-so. The KFC Pork Chop was cooked to discombobulating medium rare. After watching various cooking shows where this is acceptable, I decided to keep the chop at the table. The medium cooked part of the chop was tasty. The frosted flake crust offered a nice crunch. The grilled peach that accompanied the chop was overdone and not sweet. If the plate had been executed better - medium cooked chop and a sweet grilled peach to go with the cream, then this would have been a fine dish. The Lamb Osso Bucco was a big portion. The lamb was tender and the eggplant couscous was very flavorful and spicy. A bit more raita would have been great to bring this dish home. The childrens menu is de riguer and the chicken nuggets and fries were pretty good. Overall the meal was fine. But the service was not. The waiter dropped off the check which was $95. Typically, with restaurant.com certificated the servers ALWAYS go over the bill and show how the discount was applied and to ensure the customer sees the gratuity that was added. This time no. My husband dropped $120 on the bill and the waited asked if we needed change and my husband said No. Then, the waiter never came back. No follow up on the receipt of the meal, no follow up on drink refills or additional drinks...nothing, except another guy looking at the table waiting for our departure to bus. So we left. About 50 feet outside of the restaurant, the restaurant.com issue stuck with me and I went back inside to ask the waiter if he applied the $25 off. He simply said Yes. No show on the reciept...nothing. In effect, this guy made off with an 18% gratuity automatically applied because of the restaurant.com with an additional 26% gratuity from my husband -- and no, he did not provide 44% in gratuity level of service.

Amidst all the upscale dining options on the Strip, lies First Food & Bar @ Palazzo, where the food and service are non-pretentious, but the ambiance is not sacrificed. Who wouldn't  enjoy a meal overlooking the Strip?

My friend and I were fortunate enough to stumble across FF&B through our Foursquare App while checking into Zine Dim Sum downstairs. One of the tips was to try the 21oz ""Big Dobranski Burger"" - 1ft diameter, 6 cheese pieces, 6 bacon slices...sounded like from an episode of Man vs. Food, so we were game. 

We came here on Saturday, 7.31.10 at 5:45 PM and were promptly seated.

DRINKS/FOOD:
As an FYI, FF&B doesn't have the Big Dobranski Burger anymore (BOO!) b/c their menu changes seasonally.

*Cotton Candy Kiss ($14): More for ""show"" than anything. The martini was beautifully presented; as you pour the cocktail into the martini glass, you watch the fluffy cotton candy quickly dissipate. The cocktail itself tasted like a jolly rancher, so if you're into sweets, you will like it.

*Philly Cheese Steak Dumplings ($15.55): OMFG--A MUST ORDER! The PCSD were pan-fried to a golden crisp and was filled w/ tender seasoned slices of beef and savory gooey cheddar cheese. The sirachi added the perfect kick to the dumplings. 

*Buffalo Wing Lollipops ($16): YUM! The meaty wings were crisp, tender, moist, spicy, and had the right amount of tang. The blue cheese dressing was creamy, savory, and slightly pungent which helped tone down the spiciness of the wings.

*Doritos Mac 'N Cheese ($7):  OK! Mac 'N Cheese is normally a treat b/c it's a gut buster that you can only have in small doses. So, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as rich and decadent (ooeey gooey) as I expected it to be. The elbow noodles were lightly smothered in slightly runny cheese sauce, and topped w/ Doritos crumbs to give a light crunch. Although the noodles were perfectly al-dente, the cheese sauce was really lacking in texture and taste. 

*Dr. Pepper Ribs w/ Cheesy Grits ($24.44): YUM! The ribs were fall-of-the-bone, tender and moist. It was well-seasoned, savory, smoky and slightly sweet from the Dr. Pepper glaze. 

Oh, the grits...I normally HATE grits, but FF&B completely made me do a 180. It was extremely creamy, yet it had a slight chunky consistency for a bite. The cheese brightened up the grits by adding a salty and savoryness. Spoon-licking GOOD!

SERVICE:
Our waitress Magan was awesome; she was upbeat, friendly, and attentive. Once our orders were promptly taken and the food started rolling in w/ in 10 minutes. 

AMBIANCE/DÉCOR:
Nothing like your typical dive bar/restaurant (well it's Vegas after all); dark ceilings w/ textured wood walls, gold embossed ceilings, and dark furnishings accented w/ bright orange chairs and orange rose-lined booths.

There are LCDs throughout FF&B, so you can keep abreast of the latest game. 

The highlight of FF&B is the view. There's like grubbing while overlooking the Strip and getting a bird eyes view of TI. Even better is getting a front-row seat when the TI show is happening.

The calamari was delicious.  The philly cheesesteak dumplings were delicious.  My aunt got the lobster roll which had SO MUCH LOBSTER.

She's usually here for lunch, but as we were looking through our menu our host swapped them out for dinner menu instead.

We sat by the window with the view of T.I. and north of the strip which was nice at first, but the Pallazo sign was too much of a distraction as the dinner progress.  Almost like strobe lights and ""robot"" movements.  Well, not that bad but you get the idea.

Our Server, Caesar, started us off with ice water and the warm pretzels with 3 different mustard dipping sauce before our drinks came out: Cucumber Gimlet for her and Dr Brown's Black Cherry Soda for me. Yum!

We went through with Caesar's recommendation on their signature dishes and couldn't be more pleased.

Chicken Lollipop Wings:  Nice basket of the drumlets in their hot sauce serve with their own mash up blue cheese dipping sauce.  Tried with ranch, but the blue cheese compliment the wings more which is weird because I'm a ranch guy.  

Philly Cheese Steak Dumplings:  5 piece of dumplings packed with cheese steak and whiz served with a sirracha/ketchup aioli and topped with sliced banana peppers.?  It's good and taste like regular dumplings, but 14bucks for this app?  That's something to ponder about.  

Sliders:  4 mini burgers stacked with caramelized onions, tomato, lettuce, pickle, and their version of a thousand island sauce.  Freakin'  Awesome!!  My sis and I were just craving In-and-Out and we just so happen to have these sliders which were just as delightful.

Side of Mac and Cheese w/ truffle:  Now this is different.  Has 3 type of cheese I never heard of let alone pronounce it, and it was pretty intense.  I think it was like 7bucks for a side.

For dessert we went with her favorites, donuts!  These donuts came with a strawberry jam, chocolate, and caramel dipping sauce.   I don't know how, but we manage to eat it all.

On our way out we took a photo in photo booth for a dollar.  It was a perfect way to end a meal.  

I'd like to think First Food and Bar is bar food done right.  They really know how to flair things up, and I'm a huge fan of bar food already.

Our table had a variety of dished the Wild Mushroom pasta, trout over corn bread, linguini and clams, scallops, and the crispy oysters for the starter. Before anything came out we were offered cocktails which my standard 7&7 came out a bit heavy on the soda side but we arent perfect. The bread brought to the table was a pretzel plate followed by a number of mustard sauces that was tasty when warm, but while cooled got a bit tough for my liking, but an interesting concept idea. When the oysters hit the table they were gorgeous as the presentation was on point and was backed up with an incredibly light and crisp flavor not only from the fried oyster but the shredded cucumber, carrots, and radish that topped it with a hint of wasabi mayo... quite tasty. The order came with 4 but i could have eaten a dozen myself. The main dished hit the table and looked incredible from the start, my mushrooms were incredibly tender and the sauce would have made cardboard edible. I tried the trout with cornbread and it too was not a disappointment as the crispy skin and sweet cornbread mix went well together and made for a solid plate of food.

I will say we ate a late dinner at approximately 9:30 or so, so the traffic from dinner was obviously died down a bit which was nice as we did not have to wait for a table. So that might have helped the experience a bit. One point of disappointment was the lack of DJ that was suppose to be there from 10pm to the early morning hours.

Another PLUS is that it faces the strip and they have hugh windows so you get a great view ( extra large booths that fit 6-8 too). Who Knew? I'll definitely stop back when I'm LV.

The first thing I saw was a giant sign for their bloody mary bar/unlimited mimosas (automatically +10 points). Not just any bloody mary bar though...it was accompanied by one of the best DJ's I've ever heard. Best mashup he spun while I posted up at the bar was definitely Santeria/Should I Stay or Should I Go. All of us nursing our hangovers definitely got a little pep in our step with these kind of tunes! 

After perusing the menu (even though I wasn't hungry, I saw things like Ore-Ida tater tots,  Chicken and Waffles, and lollipop buffalo wings. Nom nom), I finally decided to give their Red-Eye Mojito a try. 

Holy wow.

Bicardi Torched Cherry, real brandied cherries, and loads and loads of M & L. It was magically delicious, and I downed the first one. Although I only had an hour before my flight back home, I did the rockstar thing and decided to give in for another one (which I proudly carried out in a to-go cup. very tourist-y of me). 

The ambiance of this place is pretty rad...lots of light, great view of the Strip, and tucked away in the Palazzo not too far from the Reservation desk. Also have to note the fun music, awesome bartenders, and a pretty chill crowd. Aside from the bar and standard dining tables, you can also sit in their lounge area in comfy low chairs and benches.

Complimentary pretzels with dijon mustard, mustard and some buttery mustard dip. Delicious and filling. Be sure to skip out on the appetiser if you're not a big eater.

A lollicup buffalo chicken to share. $15?? ouch. it was cut up to be convenient, but that also means it probably just came with 5 actual whole wings. It's simply really strong buffalo wings, it was good though, nothing lollicup about it. the ranch dressing was overwhelmed by the buffalo sauce but that's okay because it was pretty good. worth the $15? i'll skip next time.

I ordered the duck with caramel bread pudding and almond dressing. $22. It was...very...almond-ish. Not my cup of tea. It was also a little fatty, which is alright. The Bread pudding was actually pretty good. But at this point I was so stuffed I took half my lunch home. It still tasted good the next day. My bf got the sliced lamb. a little bland.

4856708,2012-09-10,0,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"With so many restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from, and new ones opening up all the time, you almost feel like you have to justify going back to the place you were at only a couple months back, or revisit the spot that was a highlight of your last vacation out here.

Chef Sammy DeMarco's First Food & Bar requires no such justification because its vast menu provides many opportunities to try something new, and the food here is always consistent no matter the time of day, so you'll never be disappointed. What more can you ask for?

Based on a concept that started out in New York's East Village, First Food & Bar takes familiar comfort foods and hoists them up to new levels, with playful, contemporary twists.

We've sampled countless items from their menu, both for lunch and dinner, and each one has been a hit.

The dinner highlights have included a sea-monster-sized deep-fried lobster served with a tamarind pad thai, a miso cod with a hoisin glaze, and a warm goat cheese souffle that combines asian pears, cranberries and pistachios.

Lunch has often been a selection of their unique appetizers. I love their BBQ pulled pork eggrolls that come with a tangy but sweet Dr. Pepper dipping sauce, their Philly cheesesteak dumplings served with a Siracha ketchup, and their walnut shrimp that would make some Asian restaurants in Chinatown cry in shame.

On my last visit there, we sampled the ""Jersey Shore"" (a scrumptious BLTA served with their famous Doritos-crusted Mac 'n' Cheese), as well as an all-dressed sausage with fries and gravy, and their lollipop style Buffalo wings (the bones are ""frenched"" to create the sticks).

They also have an extensive beer selection, which is another reason I frequent them so often, and gives me something else that's new to try on each visit here. Some of the highlights from their beer menu includes: Alaska Amber, an altbier from California; Arrogant Bastard Ale, a smoky, strong ale also from California; Dogfish Head's floral 90-Minute IPA from Delaware; Leinenkugel's Sunsat Wheat from Wisconsin that has blueberry and coriander flavors; and Woodchuck Pear Cider from Vermont that goes down way too fast.

The restaurant is located in the maze that is the Shoppes at the Palazzo, but you can find a ""secret entrance"" with an elevator that whisk you right up to the restaurant, just around the corner from the hotel's entrance on the Vegas strip. Simply take the sidewalk that hugs the left side of the Walgreen's near the hotel and follow it through the Palazzo's gates. A clearly marked door along the wall on the right side of the sidewalk will take you there.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,2,1,4,vj76E36WBRkTA69PDr7tMQ

It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. 

Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. 

For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table.

Perhaps advertising that you're open ""late ... really late"" is not compatible with closing the kitchen at 11:00pm or perhaps a little earlier, though.  Not in Vegas.  I'd also note that, at least the evening we visited, they had the music up so loud they were getting quite a bit of distortion from the sound system.  I don't mind loud music per-se, but the quality issue...

It took quite a lot of time indeed to get basics like water - the lone server in our section was kind of overwhelmed, I think, though friendly and accommodating when present.

Lobster Roll was good - four buns with a lobster mix on top and plenty of butter.  ""Main Line"" Philly Cheesesteak ( with foie, of course ) was great as well, though probably eventually fatal.  Flavors of the Pulled Pork Eggroll - chopped in six pieces and covered with slaw - kind of got lost in the mix.

Monkey Bread and a $5 scoop of rapidly melting vanilla ice cream ended up a little dry, and the ice cream did not survive long enough to be more than a sauce.  The portion is large, but not over-large for two people to finish.

Overall, the food is a particular brand of decadent, and pretty good if that's what you're looking for, but the spotty service knocked it down a couple notches for us.",JjTusdmnjHxKe-Kqwr0YGA,3,1,3,flbTT27JP7794S60e5meGw

I do think the strip could use more places like this - moderately priced, fun atmosphere, open for lunch, etc. It seems we have too many things on the uber-high end (and only open for dinner) or uber-low end (food courts, fast food, cafes). 

The space was great and the views of the strip are killer! I loved our booth right by the window overlooking the pirate disaster at TI. Service was just OK (he forgot to bring our soup and was slow in general), but unfortunately I've found mediocre service is becoming the norm on the strip..

I was disappointed by how tiny the lunch menu was. Maybe 10 choices or so? Pretty slim pickings. The drink menu had 50 things, the food menu had just a few - what's up with that? Annoying when you're at a work lunch and not drinking! Prices were high-ish ($15-$20 on average) for the type of food it is, but it's on the strip in a swanky hotel so whatever, that's just part of it. 

2 of us shared the pulled pork quesadillas and turkey club sandwich, and 2 others got the fish and chips. The turkey club sandwich DID taste just like the ones I ate at the country club growing up - but for $15 with no sides, I would have liked some primo ingredients (avocado or even cheese!). The pulled pork quesadilla was pretty awesome. It looked like a sushi roll with beautiful avocado layered on top, but it had that nice grilled crunch of a quesadilla. Unique, flavorful, and delicious. My coworkers seemed to really enjoy their fish and chips. 

For dessert we had chocolate creme brulee with toasted marshmallow on top. This was freaking awesome. Something different, well executed, and fun. 

Overall a nice change of pace from the high end stuff on the strip and the food court crap. It's pricier than what you'd expect to pay at this sort of place, but for the most part the quality and portion size is there and the atmosphere and strip views can't be beat.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,12,10,4,tOMbjFZ52BoqZuUz4FW6Gg

Perhaps it should come as no surprise that the signature Las Vegas outpost of celebrity Chef Sammy D went belly up shortly after my December visit; it was loud both visually an aurally, could not/would not turn on any NFL game besides the Cowboys despite multiple TVs and title of First Food & BAR, and even by Sin City Standards the prices were high while the vibe/décor bordered on too-hip-for its-own-good...and yet at the same time I must admit that despite all these failings and the fact that service was more eye-candy than efficiency I kind of enjoyed my meal there.

Perhaps as a result of having spent the morning at Public House where my friend already acquired a good beer buzz or perhaps due to my guilty-pleasure soft spot for upscale comfort food and/or kitsch takes on American classics the best way I can describe First Food & Bar - both the experience and the cuisine - is ""fun,"" each dish a little more audacious than the last with large portions, tableside preparations, and excessive ingredients aplenty.  Ranging from shockingly simple and delicious donuts to unique and elaborately presented French toast to the doughy and tedious Monkey Bread our sampling of sweet items ran the gamut and moving towards the savory - two options ordered by my friend - both the chicken and the waffle were as well prepared as any while the waffle fries...let's just say the name says all you need to know, and one or two was definitely enough (though my friend claims otherwise, to which I say ""drunk food."")

Sporting the moto ""Hard to find but easy to love"" due to their obscure location in the shoppes at the Venetian I'm not sure I entirely agree with that sentiment, but I am glad I went - even if I probably would not have gone back even if they had remained open; a ""once is enough"" sort of place to be sure.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,1,3,1vPTZwpr5_zsZCXAJ-hxnQ

So, we sit down at the bar lounge area and order a beer thinking we could get two drinks for the price of one and order half price appetizers.

Ends up we were not allowed to order half price appetizers because there was a miscommunication between the hostess and waitress.
Their mistake but the staff/management didn't care.

The richness of the goat cheese was paired perfectly with the pears and the sweet cranberries. It is served with pieces of endive to scoop it all up with and everything just works so well together.

Rueben Tacos.....only 3 of them, but with potatoe pancakes as the soft taco shell, you can't beat it.  The Paparadelle pasta....excellent. Scallops....excellent. Miso Salmon.....excellent.  

They also serve breakfast until 4:20pm........You can read into that if you want.

Highly suggest this place for any meal. I will make it a must visit every time we are in LV.",kAgAL69Ao05tEKbp_zJj2w,1,1,5,5KxP8hoYFLtymNakF_QxZQ

Stopped by First after drinks at Lavo and had the Philly cheesesteak dumpling appetizer ($15) and an enormous blta sandwich ($18). Dumplings were great but I doubt I would've paid that much for an appetizer if I wasn't already drunk. The sandwich was also overpriced (note that fries are not included), but it was pretty awesome. I uploaded a pic - about a foot long, loaded up w thick cut crisp bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado slices and really spicy chipotle Mayo. Enough for 2, possibly 3 ppl.
The price is really the only thing that stops me from going there more often. Well that and you can't really have a fun bar atmosphere when the place is 3/4 empty as its been every time I've been there. They also seem to have changed the menu quite a bit. I noticed a large portion of the menu was now overpriced lobster dishes. My beloved btla was in tiny writing in the corner - never would've ordered it or even noticed it if a friend hadn't already talked it up a couple months ago. Guess they're trying to push the even more overpriced things onto the few customers that can find first tucked away in a corridor next to Barney's.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,1,3,HA9ilB4U3JKVpqvKQHO0_A

5810189,2010-01-07,0,_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA,"This place definitely deserves a 4.5.

I don't know whether it was because I was finally out in Vegas on my own or because it was the first meal that wasn't a mouth-stuffing buffet meal, but this place is pretty much awesome.  A modern decor, but casual and not stuffy with a great view of the strip.  I find this place to be very appealing.

The hostess and waiter was very friendly and offered us soft pretzels with three different types of mustard dipping sauces.  Interesting, but I only liked one of the dipping sauces.

A friend who lived in Vegas recommended the Philly cheese steak dumplings, and he was definitely right about them.  Not your typical Chinese-fare pork dumplings, but it comes in the same shape and style as a potsticker, but with Philly steak and cheese filling on the inside.  Crispy, tasty, and a mouthful of hot yummy goodness.  It is rather pricey for 5 pieces ($14, I think), but hey, it's Vegas, splurge a little!  This was followed up with Vietnamese chicken skewer tacos, wrapped in lettuce instead of a tortilla.  It was sort of messy because of the sauce and the chunks of chicken were falling out, but still good.  Cold crisp lettuce and pieces of juicy chicken.  It's sort of like a chicken lettuce wrap, really.

For a drink, I had Rick's spark plug, which is some sort of hard liquor in a shot of espresso.  That woke me up.  Whoo.

One last thing. $1 photobooth that almost instantaneously gives you your pictures.  No paying $5 and waiting around for like, 15 minutes for a strip of photos!  Yayyy.",wMk62l3ILf7TKenpbw9PeQ,1,0,4,pIIMwB9lBzpd7FjUfSy-PA

As mentioned above, i'm ususally there either late night or in the monring for breakfast. The must have are their  little mini donuts! they present them in a baby fryer basket and theyre dusted with sugar. i'm drooling just thinking about them!  so, besides that, their breakfast sliders are awesome and they come with a side of tots! these arent no school cafeteria tots either, these come out golden and super crispy with just the right amount of salt. Ive had a breakfast sandwich here also but I know they seem to change their menu up a little bit everytime i go there. You cant go wrong with a dish as long as it appeals to you. Philly cheesesteak dumplings with siracha ketchup.....cant go wrong with those either. haha

One bad thing with this place is their hours, check the website but I believe they dont usually open in the morning until 11am or something like that. BUT....they are open until like 2am so its a fun place to go hang out at for some late night drinks if youre not a clubber. Also, unless you know the palazzo/venetian complex, its VERY hard to find this place.

I was very much looking forward to the Cotton Candy Kiss drink. I don't ever recall leaving a drink that I paid for on the bar because it made me gag. ""First"" time for everything.

We ordered a couple of appetizers but nothing worth mentioning. Same for service. Decor is odd, as other reviewers have mentioned. Weirdly... bowling alley cafeteria.",A0kENtCCoVT3m7T35zb2Vg,0,0,2,vkxsII7TCnMHVMXvcknl1A

MOJITO tasted nasty made my face like this =( wah wah wah
Buffalo chickn... i honestly got excited bc it sed lollipop... and reminded me of the garlic/ginger lollipop chickens at sky dragon in SSF =) mmmm.. DAH sidetracked... so back to my review, ok so the buffalo chickn wasnt all that great, the drumettes were very very dry...
tator tots were yum cant go wrong... and the steak and eggs THUMBS DOWN!! It was ordered medium rare, and came out well done and dry... ALSO what sucked too is when our order was ready we just watched it sit under the heat lamps for 20 minutes... maybe thats why the steak was overcooked and the lollipops were just sunbathing under the heatlamps getting the moisture sucked out of them? PLUS it wasnt even busy in there... we were pretty much the only table while there were a couple of people hanging out in the bar area... the complimentary pretzels were hard to eat.. so we decided to play hockey with them hahaha...

In my opinion the place is in the same tier as cheesecake factory and level above than TGIF. Whether our group looked a bit too Asian but the server right away suggested lamb dumplings. It was funny but the dumplings were tasty. I ordered catch of the day which was decent. The mini burgers looked delish. My girlfriend ordered spaghetti with meatball which did not look pretentious. The interior is nice and plush. Good place to catch up with friends over a drink and bar food.,8mV8ONazgmpRwhR3E5PcqQ,0,0,4,3K9jvb9Ik0sEGUj9MtuoAQ

Arrived around 10pm on a Friday, was seated with a beautiful view of the treasure island show at the window of the restaurant, and were hungry and roaring to go.

Our wonderful server Dan had to come back a few too many times with issues but I remained unbothered for them. They were out of watermelon puree for my boyfriend's drink. They were struggling with the batter for the unlimited chicken and waffles entrée (available post 10pm). An additional item was on the bill mistakenly. But Dan applied the coupon with grace even though we didn't spend the 50 on food. Oops, I didn't realize. 

The chefs also doubled my order (bonus!) Of the breakfast burger sliders. They were amazing btw. The rigatoni my boyfriend had was good but the special tomatoes they used had a different flavor I wasn't expecting.

The alcoholic Arnold Palmer was delicious.

The ambiance is a bit odd... the DJ played the music loud but it didn't bother us. Keep that in mind as this is not the most romantic of locations while mash ups are playing in the background.

I usually just order pub food when I'm here, but I just can't seem to resist it.

It's in a pretty hard to find part of Palazzo, but it's worth the search. The chef changes up the menu pretty regularly which is a nice change of pace. The complimentary pretzels are a nice filler food and I enjoy the honey mustard dipping sauce. The pizza is simply made, but actually pretty delicious. 

The views of the strip are gorgeous and I love stopping here for a late night drink and snack. Most of the foods are of very generous portions. I usually share. 

The drink selections are just as interesting. I like the cotton candy. It may be overly sweet and more of a novelty than anything, but I'm all for things that are novel or have kitsche.

With the ever-changing menu I am able to try something different every time I come here. Definitely one of my favorite if I'm heading to the strip.

Luckily, there were quite a few sandwich and burger options for non-egg eaters like myself.  

$14.99 is not exactly cheap for a burger, but in a very pricey city, it seemed moderate.  More importantly, the food and service were solid.  They even served complimentary mini-donuts.

This is one of the you-pay-for-what-you-get restaurants, so while the food is great, the prices increase accordingly (but what place in Vegas isn't this way?  It's tourist-central.  I've been to Vegas too many times and still haven't been able to find a restaurant that serves up great food at an awesome value).

One look at First Food & Bar's menu and you'll want to order EVERYTHING.  I know I did.  I couldn't decide among the Tempura Fried Ahi Tuna, Truffle Mac-n-Cheese, and Garlicky Mushrooms, and ended up ordering more than what I could finish.  The Tempura Fried Ahi Tuna comes with a few thick slices of Tuna served on a bed of this coleslaw-like salad.  This tuna could have used more flavor/seasoning, but I guess once you bread something in tempura, you shouldn't do much else with it?  (And plus, who am I to question Emeril's food/recipes?)  The Garlicky Mushrooms side dish needed a bit more garlic (but then again my garlic taste buds don't work well).  They saute and serve in in a small pan an ample amount mushrooms that went well with the calamari appetizer we also ordered.  There was a great mix of calamari rings and our preferred calamari tentacles; the calamari breading was crispy and served alongside 2 types of sauces (sweet/sour and horseradish-y).

I'd come back, but only during happy hours.  And only if I tried everything else in Vegas.",a2S0jQecIOUYurcBdgUddg,0,0,3,Lfb-NiRz-j10AYhhY5-MxA
