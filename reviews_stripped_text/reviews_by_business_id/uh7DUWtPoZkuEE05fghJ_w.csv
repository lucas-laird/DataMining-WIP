Got to the restaurant 15 mins early to make sure all was good with the reservation, the hostess was friendly and got us to a table a few mins early. First thing I noticed was an odd light smell of BO, kind of weird but it was one of those things that just seems weird. The place was pretty crowded and really loud. Waited a bit for someone to notice we were there, might have been because we weren't with any scantily clad ladies. Anyway, once the waitress arrived she became the true star of the experience, very nice, overly attentive and agreed that the place was just way to loud. So really a hit in stars for ambiance, the food came out quickly it was good but also hit or miss. Steak tartare, awesome and wonderfully presented; french onion soup dumplings were a congealed cheesy mess; oyster platter so-so half good half tiny and lame. On to the mains, Thai chicken was very good juicy well flavored but too heavy on the ginger, Lamb chops presented beautifully and they were cooked perfectly but to my dismay they were cold! Since the place was a mad house figured it wasn't worth complaining. So there were highlights and low points, all in all wanted this place to live up to the hype.

Service and kitchen speed were fine. But the quality in the kitchen is sub par. 

Signature cocktails are PROBABLY pre-mixed. 

Yellowtail sashimi - boring. Not super fresh. 

Burrata toast - burrata is whipped and runny. Tomatoes are canned. I'd rather eat something from the frozen aisle. 

Pork belly lettuce cups - pork belly was probably cooked 12 hrs prior. Skimp servings. 

Angus beef sliders - no flavor. Stale bun. Overcooked. 

Mexican corn ravioli - corn is probably from a can. Pasta was boring and underwhelming. Only ate 2 of the 6 served on the plate.

We had to scream at the waitress the entire time because we couldn't hear over the loud music and vice versa. We could barely hear each other speak at the table. The food was mediocre and way over priced for the quantity. What concluded was that the waitress expressed that our billed could not be split and that she'd have to get the manager approval for splitting the bill. When she returned, she said she could split the bill 4 ways and that's the best they could do and walked away without any apologies.

We did sample a bit of everything (avoid the west/east oysters as they are disappointingly small) including their signature cocktails which were more ice than signature.

A bunch of girlfriends (10) and I went to Vegas for Easter weekend and was offered a comped dinner here. Honestly, I don't think I would have ever even looked at this place or considered coming here because the name and the pricing of the food, but again since it was comped.. why not? 
This place was like a hidden restaurant. You walk into a shop, not expecting the open a door and here is this fancy shmancy restaurant! I wish I had pictures to show! It is a very dark restuarant, the table settings and decor were nice! The service was great! Food came super fast! They offered us a three course meal, one shot and one mixed drink! Everything was SOOO worth it. The portions were small for the comped meals, I am not sure if they are normally that small for regular entrees/appetizers, but I still recommended coming here because it was so mouth watering.

She was running the host stand/reservations. All of the people in our party did not arrive yet and she told us we could not be sat until our whole party arrived, which I understand. However, she was very rude and did NOT look happy to be at work. Once our whole party arrived she told us we still had to wait to be sat? My friends and I waited 45 minutes only not to be sat. We were fed up with her attitude and the way she was talking to us so we decided to sit in the lounge since a full menu was offered. The cocktail servers took EXCELLENT care of us!

399452,2017-05-16,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Beauty & Essex is a spawn of the one from New York, a simple pawn shop on Essex street but hidden behind it is a bustling high end restaurant.  The same concept is brought over to Vegas and the Cosmopolitan is the perfect place for a concept like this. The entrance is a fully functional pawn shop and there's even a small lounge area with goods in glass cases out front where hostess take reservations as well. Upon mentioning your reservation or intent to walk-in you're lead through a door and on the other side of that door is what seems like another world. Very dark, modern interior as well as very loud ambiance. Mirrors adorn the walls and people dressed in high end fashion lounge by the bar waiting to be seated or sitting in for a drink. Upon checking in, you're quickly led down the rabbit hole into the main dining area which is like a modern day speakeasy inspired by Lewis Carroll novels.

Service: We've been here twice and we've had the same waitress. The place is loud but our waitress seemed to always be able to manage it quite well and never got any of our orders wrong. She wasn't pushy with drinks and would only ask once. Knowledgable with the menu and had a good idea of how much food to order to be satisfied. We always had an idea of what to get going in but her recommendations either reaffirmed it or provided perspective on new menu items.  Timing for food was good, water was always full, and waitress gave us our space when we needed it to eat and talk. Also props to them for not rushing guests out as they let everyone take their time and hang out as long as they want even when the place is bustling and there's a que in the lounge. 

Dishes: The food here is meant to be shared family style therefore the portions are usually smaller. But unlike other places the portions here are exceptionally small for alot of dishes and high price point makes certain dishes hard to stomach. 

Chile Rellano Empanadas: Comes in 4 and although good it isn't anything mind-blowing and definitely not worth the $14

Grilled Cheese/Smoked Bacon Dumplings: Comes in 6, fun to eat, and pretty tasty. This is one of Chef Santos' more popular dishes and fun to try out. 

French Onion Soup Dumplings: Comes in 6, Very hot, pretty good as well with the melted cheese. Hot soup inside the dumplings provides a mini explosion of flavor and goodness. 

Short Rib Mac n Cheese: One of the more bigger dishes, very hearty. Doesn't really stand out flavor wise as it felt like I was just eating basic pasta. 

Beauty & Essex Burger: Best bang for buck dish right here as you get the burger and bbq fries. The burger is quite delicious as it's a mix of lamb and beef while everything else simply melts in your mouth. Bbq fries are also good and seasoned very well as it doesn't feel like they just sprinkled it on there. 

Dry Aged Chuck Sliders: Sold by the piece, ended up getting this on the second visit to switch it up and it pretty good as well. The touch of jam gave it a sweet touch that was interesting. 

Elote Style Scallops: 3 pieces on a bed of corn, The scallops were fresh and flavorful while the corn was charred just right. 

Kygo Cloud Nine S'mores: A very fun dessert named and based off of Kygo's ""Cloud 9"" album with the similar blue streak. It was fun getting a dessert based off a popular DJ and the dish itself is quite good with plenty of s'mores and chocolate cake. Not overly rich but will still have you feeling a small sugar rush. Great dessert for two people to share. 

Thoughts: This is one of those places that you go to say that you've gone there. The experience is fun and the overall presentation of everything is top notch. The food is good but leaves alot to be desired. This is very much a social restaurant where one goes to see and be seen. You'll be engaged in conversation while sipping on a crafted cocktail and picking at various dishes throughout the night. You won't leave smiling and thinking back to the delicious food but you'll leave smiling remembering the conversations, people, and little world tucked behind that pawn shop.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,2,0,3,LIQsGthv7i9G1kF0T1akbQ

While it doesn't feel as authentic, because it is in The Cosmopolitan and not the Lower East Side, this 9 week old restaurant still managed to pull off an over the top cool vibe.  We loved the build out with the Pawn Shop in the front again and then the whole different world behind the secret door. 

The DJ was great.  She set a great mood. 

We shared the tuna tacos, chicken meatballs with a truffle sauce and grilled cheese smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings.  The tuna tacos were excellent, but the other 2 dishes were to die for. Just out of this world. 

The only negative thing we have to say about this place, was that the male hosts at the check in area were quite rude and had serious attitudes. 

We waited for a little bit at the bar, because we were a little early and did end up waiting past our reservation time. 

We very much enjoyed the blonde bartender at the bar. I wish I asked her her name. She said she has been with the Tao Group at some of their other properties. She was very warm and friendly. We felt like we were watching an artist make drinks.  She suggest the Pink Panther and I really enjoyed the drink.

567401,2017-04-27,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Second time at B&E in Vegas in 2 weeks. You've read all the food reviews so I won't detail those here except to say that it can be hit or miss. The first time our Short Ribs Mac and Cheese was dry; better last night but still not very creamy. Steaks were totally over salted but this is the ""newer"" way of cooking and is my problem.

Two issues that prevented them from being higher starred:

1) noise level
2) presumptuousness of the servers

I get that hip vibe that noise is exciting and makes everyone think this is the place to be. But both times I have come home with a sore throat from having to literally yell at the person across the table from me. At least last night the music wasn't as loud. But the acoustics are just flat out awful. I'm not looking for a fine restaurant ambience with servers talking to you in hushed tones, but when the servers can't hear me/me them and I can't hear my friends, its a problem.

2) Both times I've found the servers a bit presumptuous and last night, even bordering on rude. Apparently last night the server asked the table if there were any dietary restrictions; well perhaps because of the noise level, perhaps because he didn't speak loud enough or make sure we were all noticing he was talking (I certainly didn't), I didn't hear him to tell him about my issue with seafood.

When he came back and I inquired about the appetizers which he ordered (they like to do that there, the server decides what to bring you) and their seafood/fish content, his response was arrogant and blaming me for not hearing him. ""I stood right here and asked and no one said anything"". He did not apologize and of course, the entire first course of appetizers was fish. I will say that he took care when ordering the side dishes for our main and made sure they were seafood free.

We had a large table of 10 and when he returned to take our entree orders, I wasn't ready (this was a business dinner and we were talking shop). I asked him to come back to me and he refused, responding ""I'll tell you what to have"". I'm sure he meant it in a confident, ""we have a lot of great things here and let me advise you"" sort of manner but it came off as condescending especially when its a man speaking to a woman. If I had wanted his ""advice"" I'd had asked for it. He did the same to another female patron at our table who was eating gluten free vegetarian - talked down to her, basically told her there was very little on the menu for her. I get that you don't like dietary restrictions but staff doesn't need to be rude about it.

Otherwise the food is good, the decor is lovely albeit very dimly lit (hard to read menus), drinks typical Vegas overpricing ($17 for a cocktail) but its nothing special in a town full of great places to eat.",Nda9fBr1OGjqpa2BcO8bBw,1,0,3,XF8wYwWZ2reDi3YsNTw0gg

I knew nothing of the restaurant but our server was very sweet and helpful. The food is meant to share, tapas style. I will be dreaming of the soup and grilled cheese dumplings until my next Vegas trip. These are a must! Another winner is the Mexican corn ravioli.

Everyone we went with has worked in the restaurant industry before so we have a pretty good idea of how things work and this was awful. Their motto is ""we always make sure there's enough for the table""... AKA, we will charge you for extra bites of food even though you didn't order it. Never mind the fact that my bites of food never came and our server couldn't have cared less. When we complained to the manager about the service and bill he offered to give us a reservation at the LA location. Oh yah! We get to drive 100 miles away from our house to go through this horrific experience again? No thanks. He ended up comping the drinks that actually made it to the table (two never came) and our bill was still close to $200. We all left and went to the hidden pizza place across the hall.

The pulled chicken arepas are not anything like traditional arepas - they are a small wafer with some plain, cold chicken on top (at least as we received it).

We did get there about 5 minutes early so we were given a pager and said we could wait in bar area. A waitress came and asked us if we would like a cocktail, we said yes but we wanted to look at the drink menu. She said ok and walked away. We waited a while and she did not come back so we asked someone passing by if we could get a drink. They told us they would get some one. The same waitress comes back and starts by saying ""I'm guessing you changed your mind?"" We ignored her comment and ordered our drink. The drinks came out right away I ordered one of their mixed drinks and my friend ordered wine. My drink was awful and my friend did not like hers either. By this time it was 10:15 and we had not been paged yet so I went to check and I was told we were next. We waited 10 more minutes and we finally got pages at 10:25. As we walked to the front to be taken to our table water drips on my friend. The person at the front sees this and says there is a leak and that they know about it, like it was no big deal. We get sat at our table and start to look at our menu. The table was dirty and still had the check from the previous customer. We ordered some kind of brisket tacos as an appetizer. As I unfolded my napkin I noticed it was very damp. I asked my friend if hers was dry and she said no. We asked for replacement napkins and they gave them to us right away. The tacos came they were underwhelming. We then ordered the bone marrow, pork chops, lamb chops, broccoli, and two more cocktails. I ordered a rose it was ok, she had champagne and it was very flat. The only think we really enjoyed and seemed to have any effort put into was the lamb and the bone marrow. The bill came and it was 200 dollars.

When you first see the restaurant, you might get a little confused. The front of the restaurant is a pawn/jewelry shop of sorts that make you question if you are at the right place. You entire this shop and there is a door in the back (which looks like an employee entrance) that leads to the main restaurant. The restaurant is dimly lit with different shaped mirrors all around the walls; it has the ambiance of an old-time European royal's mansion. 

We started off the night with drinks. I had a Ruby Iced Tea, a virgin cocktail, which was highly refreshing. The red currant tea was flavorful and the lemon juice gave it the hint of acidity that the drink needed. The mint leaves also gave the drink it the refreshing kick it needed, especially with the weather being over 100 degrees outside.

Most of the plates here are served tapas style, so our table of four got a total of 7 plates and 2 desserts. To start the night off, we had a half dozen East and West Coast Oysters. The oysters may have been small in size, but they were fresh. Next, the Steak Toast came out. This had a slight kick to it from the serrano pepper. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, allowing it to be juicy. It was lightly seasoned, allowing the Malaysian spices to be the star. 

As the night went on, we had Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops, Short Rib Mac & Cheese, and Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta. The lamb chops were also medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It  had a delicious wine glaze and was served over creamy grits. The lamb cut like butter and was flavorful on its own, but the glaze accentuated the natural flavors of the lamb. The grits gave a different texture to the dish, which it needed. The Mac & Cheese was delicious; though it was not the best I've ever had, it was still good. It was filled with chunks of short rib, not just small, thin shreds, which was impressive. The Mac & Cheese tasted like it was made of a Parmesan base, with hints of truffle oil. With the creaminess of the Mac & Cheese, the cornbread crust that topped it gave it a different texture that the dish needed. The Mushroom Pizzetta was also very tasty; the crust had a nice crunch with juicy mushrooms that topped it.

After these 5 dishes, we were still hungry, so we got BBQ fries and Garganelli. These two dishes were both mediocre. The fries were heavily seasoned, making it hard to eat many of them at the same time. The Garganelli's sauce was very rich and sweet; and though I like meat sauces, this sauce had too much meat since it felt like there was more meat than pasta. 

To finish the night off, we had ""les nyc"" Doughnuts, which were fried perfectly and not too sweet. It came with caramel, chocolate, and berry sauces. The caramel and chocolate sauces were good and very rich and sweet, while the berry was lighter and did not overpower the flavors of the doughnut. We also had the Root Beer Shots, which was dangerously good because it tasted like a regular root beer float.

All in all, the entire experience was amazing. Though some of the foods had some short comings, most of the food we ate were delicious.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,3,2,5,rQzNUt42fmkVjlOxBqdq5Q

That worry was all for naught.  What our party of 4 experienced at the Vegas location of Beauty & Essex was one of the top ten meals I have had alltime.  I highly recommend going to the restaurant with a party of 4 as almost all of the items on the menu come out tapas style that are perfectly sized for 4 people.  

The restaurant is all Vegas.  Dark and bustling, but the service is friendly and our server was particularly knowledgeable on the food.  All in all we had 14 dishes (3 of those were desserts) without a miss in the entire bunch.  Each and every dish I would order again, but the cool thing about the menu is that there were so many other items on the menu that sounded delicious that we didn't get to try.  Makes a return trip inevitable.  

Too many dishes to describe each, but the standouts among the standouts were the Tomato Tartare, Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup dumplings, Mexican Street Corn Ravioli, Double Barrel Pork Chop al Pastor, and the Chorizo Carbonara mac & Cheese.

The Staff - The staff was attentive, maybe too attentive? We had four different servers either taking our order, bringing us food, and cashing us out. We always had one waiter standing within a couple feet of our table, it felt like we were being watched over. My husband and I felt very rushed once we were done with each meal. The second we are the last bite, the plate was taken and we were asked what else we wanted. I guess typically this would be nice but we felt rushed and pressured to get more then we wanted. Cashing out was extremely rushed and almost uncomfortable too. The waiter stood over us as we were pulling out our card to pay and as we were deciding how much to tip. We got two drinks and three shareable plates and we were only there for forty minutes. For the price we paid, we would have liked to sit and relax a little longer without being rushed off.

We also tried the onion rings which were exactly what you'd expect and had the double barrelled pork chop which the sauce on top was bitter and acidic.  

Overall the menu was a little hard to order as things aren't really in a certain style or theme.  The meal was just not very cohesive and easy to put together things that went well together.

I was hoping for more flavors. Then we had the filet, which was super tender but again the flavor in the meat alone was just ok. They did provide roasted garlic and a few sauces, which made it more tasteful. We decided to try the Caesar toast and the pasta last minute. The chicken skin crumbles on the toast made the dish. I personally don't like the focaccia bread. Seems a little dense but I also understand it needs to be stiff enough for the food. The pasta was just so so as well. The pasta was not quite al dente.

The brocollini was made with chili paste, possible sambas oolek, I think it's better the way it's made at STK next door.  The pork chops were cooked a perfect medium rare, but the crust was basically a lot of black peppercorn or so it tasted like.  It was spicy, but didn't hit the spot, I thought they could do something different with it. 
He cocktails were good.  Their version of the old fashioned  was a hit for me.  I had the Oaxacan old fashioned, which I've had at a restaurant in Portland before, but it didn't taste as great as it did there, but still good.
I'll definitely go back and try other stuff that they had on their menu.",WSoJF_c2zYSyR5YR2-EYOw,2,0,4,K-UTRAjsIuXqQ1WaymjbdQ

The bartenders smile at you, everything about this place is inviting. It's nice when everyone is welcoming and not just the one person seating you, or serving you. Makes a HUGE difference. 
Third star for the FOOD,  dishes nothing short of tastebud nirvana. We had the lobster rolls, which were a mixture of lobster nestled inside of a miniature sweet potato roll.  Ahhhhhmazing. We had the scallops, and okay my husband doesn't even eat scallops and LOVED them. I had the Mediterranean salad, beautiful presentation and simply perfect. We had the short rib Mac & cheese, a little too heavy for us, but delicious nevertheless. We also had shrimp cocktail, nothing much about shrimp cocktail as you know, however their cocktail sauce was delicious. 
FOURTH AND FIFTH star for David H, our server. Who was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but extremely helpful and patient while we decided what to pick of all the fantastic choices. Obviously 2 people can only eat so much food, so we wanted to choose 5 items to share. He was extremely helpful and pleasant.  There is nothing greater than experiencing fine food, in a luxurious atmosphere with an amazing server. So thank you David H. for providing us with an amazing experience.

The reservation was at 6:30 and didn't walk out of the restaurant until 8:30. We ordered 5 different plates which included the seared rare tuna. It took the kitchen 45 minutes to finally give us the seared rare tuna. It should never take that long.

1665995,2018-04-09,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"I am totally a fan of kitschy spaces, I don't mind loud spaces, nor do I mind tapas/shared plates spaces. While I enjoyed the atmosphere quite a bit, this place is quite the comedy of errors. It's funny to look back on the meal and laugh at how silly this place is in nearly every way. 

Staff must be told to be a bit snark/snobby and to aggressively push not only sharing but that only ONE person per table to order. They must realize how comically loud the place is. Don't get me wrong, I like hubbub and loud restaurants are fine with me, but this is a bit goofy. Another reviewer shared that each plate had literally a bit of food for each person- and some of them really, truly were a bit or 1/2 a bite. I've eaten at many tapas places, but this was sort of shameful. It's great to share and have shared opportunities but this place could really leave even a weight-watching crowd quite hungry. The prices are off because the quality of the food is not that high. I would be more ok with the small/micro-portions of some of the plates if the food was of high quality. One of the plates LITERALLY tasted like a cheap child's lunch- like one of those Lunchables that kids might take for a school lunch. It tasted like processed food on white bread. 

What was funny to me was how off the proportions were. Some of the tapas were so tiny while others were WAY too big. For example, the avocado toast looked so unappetizing because there was the most disgusting pile on top of what ended out seeming like a small piece of bread (which it probably wasn't). The burrata appetizer had an enormous amount of this almost cloyingly sweet tomato base to it that you could not really taste the cheese. At least if there would have been a bit of salt on the burrata to offset some of the sweetness. The flavor palate of the chef(s) seems quite off at this resto and the balance between plate sizes. It doesn't seem like a well-thought out menu for an executive chef-led resto and therefore, for a discerning foodie. 

The dessert tray was astonishingly blah. Carrot cake seemed ok while the pot de creme was gritty. The donuts were truly about the best part of the entire meal. The chocolate sauce with the donuts had a gross consistency. There was a strange blob that was nearly flavorless on the plate that none of us could detect what it actually was supposed to be. 

Finally, the staff was not very helpful. The host staff were the most friendly and the security-like guy at the front door was the most friendly. We asked for simple things throughout the meal and we did not receive some of the or they showed up 20 minutes later. The server was aggressive and somewhat friendly- I have a feeling she is a nice person but simply the work environment is not conducive to being a pleasant person. The expediter/busser staff asked over and over if we were going to finish a few of the items on some of the plates, interrupting conversations with a group of friends who had gathered from different corners of the world to have an enjoyable evening. It was bizarre how many times they inquired as we would continue to eat a bit more and yet to be interrupted once more. One time, the same guy asked about the same two plates within a two-minuted window. Isn't that just obnoxious. And we surely weren't the dawdling type of group either. 

Clearly this resto is busy, and there are many folks that want to be seen- if you are desperately into that, I guess this might be the spot for you! I typically enjoy these types of spots, but this was uninspiring, low-to-mid quality food for high prices (like I said, if the quality, presentation and inspiration were better, I'd be ok with the prices) and lousy service (granted I bet most of the folks are wonderful people- they just work in an environ that makes people unhappy and unfriendly).

Holy crap...!

I'm dedicating this paragraph to these magical balls. One of my favorite things I've ever tasted! I'm a huge fan of French onion soup and these dumplings were better than any soup I've ever tried! Once the soaked bread hits your tongue, you then taste the sweet onions and hot soup come in and then all that melted cheese all over them and a crispy crouton for texture! My goodness! Please don't skip this item when you come here...

So the menu is a lot of fun and inspires you to share small plates. We also tried the Maine lobster rolls. I loved the baked roll itself but I didn't care for the filling that in my opinion had too many crunchy components. The scallops and charred corn were orgasmic with a great Spanish twist and the Garganelli pasta dish with sweet & spicy bolognese and whipped ricotta rocked my world! 

It was V Day so we also had to end on a sweet note. Decided to try the Kygo cloud nine s'mores and let me just say that I made a loud sound after the first bite! Another holy crap moment! So rich & decadent and that marshmallow cloud will live on in my dreams forever!

Our waiter was amazing, I think his name was David (?), he was top notch and wish I could just have him as my waiter everywhere I go. Stellar job, amazing attitude, he made the experience fun and we were so grateful to have him as our waiter. That being said, I am not sure if I've had a dinner that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed our dinner at Beauty & Essex. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos, and then we ordered another order of them after we finished our entire meal - yes, they were that good. The flavors are perfectly balanced and these are just SO good. We may have gone back the next night and picked up a quick order of these ""to go"" because we could not stop thinking about them! We also ordered caesar toast (yum!), the french onion dumplings (holy moly!), the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumpling (amazing!), scallops (prepared perfectly) and... I think that was it. Oh, and bone marrow (ahh, why you gotta be so good?!). 

Everything was phenomenal and I could have sat there all night, eating everything over and over and over again.

1707589,2018-05-10,1,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"For as many restaurants as there are on the Vegas strip, it was surprisingly hard to decide on a place for dinner. Vegas is filled with restaurants owned by celebrity chefs looking to cash in on the glamorous Vegas scene. There were plenty of overpriced steakhouses that established it was acceptable to charge $70 for a steak a la carte and $20 for an appetizer. I'm sure the food and service would've been top notch, but I wanted something more memorable that I couldn't easily find in Chicago. I was looking for a menu that was slightly unique but still offered familiar dishes, without venturing into the fine dining category. Beauty and Essex was the exact type of place I had in mind.

Ambiance: This place was super trendy, which is no surprise being located in the Cosmopolitan. The storefront was an actual thrift shop where you can buy various antique looking merchandise. The entrance to the restaurant is a discreet door behind the counter, which almost felt like a cool speakeasy entrance. Inside was dark with a super trendy and sexy atmosphere. There was a DJ playing throwback hip-hop jams, and the crowd was super lively with a lot of energy. 

Service: Service was just alright. Our server felt a bit procedural, and didn't have a warm or inviting personality. He almost seemed apathetic when interacting with us. We went on a Thursday too, so it's not like they were getting slammed on a Saturday night. Also, throughout the night, it almost seemed like he took every opportunity to pressure us to order more than we wanted/needed, just to pump up the bill. For drinks we just asked for glasses of water, and they charged $8 for a jug of still water. Then for the food he claimed that we would need at least 5-7 dishes to satisfy us, but we saw at other tables that some of the dishes were pretty large portions, and in the end, the 4 we ordered was much more than enough. Finally, he was visibly disappointed when we opted not to order dessert or coffee after the meal. It's not like we were cheap asses either, as our bill between two people was almost $200. 

Food: The menu here was more tapas style, where you get to try a bunch of dishes and then just share them. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the menu was exactly what I wanted: familiar food that had a slight twist to make them unique. 

Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - This was clearly the must-order signature dish that everyone posts on the gram. It was a literal American interpretation of Chinese soup dumplings. Instead of the traditional pork and broth you usually see in xiaolongbao, they used the classic American grilled cheese and tomato soup combination with a nice addition of bacon. It came with 6 soup spoons with a layer of tomato soup, and then in the middle was a cube of melted cheese wrapped with bacon. Each spoon was the perfect bite.

Mexican street corn ravioli - While it seemed like a great idea for an elote-pasta fusion, I just thought this was ok. The portion was probably the smallest of our order. Taste-wise, I thought it was a bit too sweet from the corn, and needed more kick from that crema sauce, or saltiness from the cheese. Texture-wise, it was just carbs on carbs, and just felt like it was missing a key element.

Spaghettini - From the description, it sounded like they were gonna use zucchini sort've like spaghetti squash, but the dish was indeed actual pasta. The portion was pretty huge, and was hands down the best value dish. The flavor was on point too. The sauce was creamy with plenty of cheesiness, and the pesto brought a little bit of freshness and garlicky flavor. Then the egg on top is a nice tough to any dish. 

Dry-aged sirloin - I was in the mood for a steak, and was a little disappointed they didn't offer a smaller sized ribeye (only the tomahawk), just the filet or sirloin. We went with the sirloin and were pleasantly surprised. The outside of the steak was seared absolutely perfectly, and the seasonings on the outside just caramelized to the meat. The steak was tender and juicy on the inside, and they went above and beyond by tossing in a bulb of roasted garlic too. What also made this steak unique was the variety of sauces that came with it. They gave a red chimicurri, green peppercorn hollandaise, roasted garlic bacon. The chimichurri was like a spicy salsa, and the peppercorn hollandaise was just bomb, super creamy and rich. I was most excited about the roasted garlic bacon sauce since those are my two favorite flavors haha, but I was disappointed to find out it just tasted like BBQ sauce. 

Cake pops - After they saw it was our anniversary in the reservation, it was a nice surprise that they brought out some complimentary cake pops to celebrate the occasion.

Foie gras appetizer, priced at $21, for 3 slices of toast with some shredded questionable duck meat on top, had no Foie gras in at all, at least not that we could detect. When we asked the waitress about onion soup dumplings, she forgot to mention that this not a soup at all, just melted cheese. The only positive thing I have to say, the room itself is beautifully decorated, although it gets very loud.

What a beautiful space: sexy, dark, mysterious, cozy, romantic, & comfortable coupled with the most top notch service I've ever experienced (even compared to Michelin star spots in SF). 

My boyfriend and I came in for his birthday on a Wednesday night, he was wished happy birthday right away by the hostess and as we walked to our table, every waiter, busboy, back-server said hello and welcome- even as the restaurant was packed! 
Our server, Rozettie, was PHENOMENAL! She was friendly, smiley, knowledgable about everything, attentive and helpful! Our water glasses were never more than half empty, we were never without a cocktail and she coursed the food perfectly. Seriously, I would come back here again for the service alone. 
We got to interact with one of the mangers as well and he was fantastic too! Warm, gracious, hilarious, friendly. (I wish I remembered his name!!)

The ambiance and the service give this place 5 stars- as the food itself is really 4 star worthy. Everything is very simple and a little underseasoned. For us, who go out to eat at great places often, we weren't that impressed, especially for the price. But that being said, it was still really good. The bone marrow & the soup dumpling were highlights for sure. I'd say to avoid the pork belly entree- a confused and incohesive dish.

For 2 people: 4 cocktails, 5 dishes came to about $240

 - Emerald Gimlet (Too much basil for me. Felt like I was drinking a green juice.)
 - Pink Panther (The peppercorn syrup and lemon just didn't taste good to me.)
 - Beauty Elixir (Refreshing. Would order.)
 - Earl the Pearl (Perfect for me. I ordered two.)
 - Bubbles & Berries (Also refreshing. Would order.)

We also ordered several small plates (multiples of some):

 - Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (WOW. I could probably demolish three orders of these. The tuna was so fresh and the tacos were so crispy. They're so good and would definitely order again.)
 - Pearls of the Sea (Beautifully presented and quite a bit of food. Everything was fresh and delicious. Would order again.)
 - Roasted bone marrow (I love bone marrow, but it's always tricky ordering it to share when your party has first-time marrow eaters. Not an easy plate to split, so we ordered a second. So rich and buttery that I'd certainly order it again.)
 - Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, & tomato soup dumplings (I was highly skeptical when we ordered this, but I became a true believer once I tried it. I can't believe how flavorful the dumplings were and that they were able to put all the flavors into a little dumpling but keep each one distinct. You weren't having a mix of grilled cheese and tomato soup flavors--you were having each distinct flavor plus smoked bacon in one dumpling. Would order again for the taste explosion.)
 - Oven braised chicken meatballs (Solid and delicious. Juicy and tender and worth ordering again, though it's pretty hard to mess up meatballs at this level of restaurant, so it's almost average compared to other dishes.)
 - Chile relleno empanadas (A delicious counterpoint to our other orders. I don't know if I'd order it again because there were so many other interesting items on the menu, but it's worth having at least once.)

Service was excellent, and it helps if you come in a group of reasonable size--smaller is better. The venue is dimly lit and the background noise from other tables can be overpowering. We were at a four-top and I had to strain to hear my friend sitting across from me. I don't recommend this place for large groups, especially large groups of hungry people.

My husband and I started with the Ceasar Toast with crispy chicken skin. The dressing was a bit overwhelming and it was missing the crunch of the skin I was hoping for.

We shared the empanadas, which were good, but tasted mostly of jalapeno and melty cheese; no complaints, but not exactly special and were only four small pieces. We ended the savory portion of the meal with the chicken meatballs (three to an order). Again, they were just fine...not something I would suggest or eat again.

My husband read that the donuts with dipping sauces were supposed to be good, so we ended the meal with those. The portion was pretty good for the price (a pleasant surprise!) and the dipping sauces were rich in their respective flavors. The donuts were oversized donut holes coated in cinnamon sugar. I had no issues with them but again, I'm unsure as to why they came so highly recommended.

It took a while to be seated and get our food.

I was happy w/ management's response when we brought it to their attention. They had a great attitude about trying to make it right vs. arguing with us.

The food, cocktail menu and layout are very similar to NYC - just a bit smaller.  Has a similar pawn shop entrance, which leads you to a small lounge and a few good sized dining rooms behind it.  Largest downside is that the bathrooms are outside the restaurant, so ladies - don't look forward to indulging in the complementary pink champagne in the bathroom a la Essex Street. The Cosmopolitan is interesting because it's restaurant scene is marked by successful NYC locations - B&E is accompanied by Blue Ribbon, Scarpetta, Momofuku, Milk Bar, Milos, and more.  If you're missing the NYC dining scene when in Vegas visit the Cosmopolitan. 

I came here twice during my week in Vegas - once for drinks and once for dinner. Both times I ordered The Woodsman - a bourbon based cocktail accompanied by allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon and muddled pears.

For dinner, we indulged in all sorts of glorious things like the tomato & creamy burrata on toast, k-town bao burgers, kale & apple salad, and the thin crust goat cheese pizette, and oven braised chicken meatballs. Oh, and you do not come to B&E without ordering the grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings. We ordered that last one twice.

I'm assuming it was loud because the tables are kind of clammed together in this closed in space. 

Came on a girls comp (yes, yes... 6 girls can get a comp) for a birthday dinner before the night out. I'll have to say that my experience with comps, have been far better than this one. 

We were served family style:
ONE plate of yellow tail sashimi- which was by far the best dish we had!!! Full of flavor
ONE plate of ""Cesar toast""- which is basically a Caesar salad on toast. 
TWO large plates of kale salad with pecans on the side (nut allergy)
ONE pesto pasta dish (for 4 to share)
and ONE non nut pasta for the two allergens to share. 

That's it food wise. Of course it came with a drink and a shot each, but a meal of basically salad to hold us over. If we would've gotten TWO plates of each ( instead of just the salad) maybe it would've been a meal. This clearly wasn't enough for us as we ordered a plate of chicken meatballs to help hold us over, it was that or go to inn n out after! I don't want to be a girl complaining about a comp, but who wants to leave a restaurant hungry? The plates are extremely small as well. We also bought a desert for the birthday girl. 

Service: 
Our waitress is what keeps the stars at a good standing. She was informative and accrediting towards our nut allergy. Although, the timing on the shots miss the mark on what we requested (same time as desert), she was pleasant so kudos to her.

Quick overview on process:  Enter through the pawn shop.... it's a real pawn shop which is fun!  I always take a peek at the jewelry.  As for dinner, this is a shared plates place.  Even the steaks come precut so it's easy to share.  I'm not sure the minimum of bites they bring out per dish.  We ahd 10 people and for everything we ordered they brought the exact amount so each person got one bite.

I've been to this location twice now and the food does not disappoint.  Here's my rundown:
Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - delicious. fresh. crunchy. perfect.
Kale & Apple Salad - one of the best salads I've had.  Great dressing.
The House Salad - this competes for sure with the above.  The crispy chickpeas make this salad for me.
French Onion Soup Dumplings - They come in servings of 6.  Cheesy, salty, onion. soooo gooood!!!  MUST ORDER for me!!!
Chile Relleno Empanadas - Creamy goodness in a pastry.  What's not to love??
Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, and Tomato Soup Dumplings - Heaven on a spoon.  Easily orderable Vegetarian sans the Bacon.  I could eat like 20 of these!!!  Another MUST ORDER!
Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta - did someone say truffle cream and caramelized onions?  This is my kind of pizza.  Flatbread style.  So good.
Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings - I mean they are good... but nothing special here.  I would say pass. 
Short Rib Mac and Cheese - also, for me, this was good but something you can get elsewhere.  If you are short on stomach space, I would pass on this guy. 
Les NYC Doughnuts - the dessert go to.  Love the berry sauce.  Think beignets.
Strawberry Shortcake Bars - Unique. Too sweet for me but tasty. 

Other table favorites that I didn't try:
Paprika Spiced Salmon, Elote Style Scallops, the Filet and Sirloin.

Service is friendly and fairly quick.  Great atmosphere.  Also be on the look out for flashers and photographers wandering around the restaurant.

I came here for a birthday last week,  our drinks were always empty, waitress wasn't anything over the top, just existing, didn't enhance the experience, the free birthday shot they give away was so embarrassing, Dennys gives you more after buying $3.99 hot cakes and we had spent well over $1k for a root-beer float shot for half a person.  Food was good but the entire experience didn't make up for the quality of the food.  I even had an encounter with the manger about the disappointing birthday surprise and he Jesse Woods I think was his name could care less.  He definitely didn't care if I came back or not so I won't!  If you can go to STK, right next door, never a bad meal, they must train their wait staff because they are always on point, all 100 times I have been their the staff of amazing! Their managers care.

1990591,2017-03-02,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"One of my all time favourite restaurants. I've been to the original location in New York which took me months to reserve in advance. I was happy to hear that Beauty & Essex opened a second location in Vegas! 

The cocktail menu is impeccable. There's always such a good selection and my personal favourite is either the Bubbly or Beauty Elixir. Both are must tries when you go. 

As a tapas place, the portions are quite sizable and great for sharing in groups of 3! However, you can always ask them to prepare a 4th portion on the plate if you're a group of 4. We were a group of 3 so it was perfect and shared 5 dishes (they recommended 6-8 plates). 

To start we had the Apple Kale Salad -- my personal fav! There was enough for us to get 2 portions each or 1 full plate each. Then we got the Brussels sprouts (delectable) side with the ravioli, the spaghettini and the mushroom pizza (3 pieces each). All of them were so good and I would highly recommend each of them. Also, the mac and cheese and TO DIE FOR. We didn't get it this time around but I've had it in the past and I would say it's a must-get. 

Overall the vibe is super trendy and young. I love the entrance in is through a pawn shop. It's great for parties and bachelorette celebrations. Also the service is on point. :)",flV6Cp3M2vHcqFBcCrGS1A,2,1,5,pIDe2iC6DnqTZOMbgIpTMg

1999043,2018-05-20,1,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Beauty & Essex is the type of restaurant that speaks to me - cool cocktails, an eclectic menu, a chic, swarthy vibe. And with three locations in these United States, it was only a matter of time until I got myself a seat in one. Odds, you might think, would be on their Hollywood outpost, only some 30 minutes away without LA traffic getting in the way. But over the last year and a half, when it comes to visits by me, Hollywood is losing 0-3-2 respectively to Vegas and New York (homes to the other Beauty & Essex locations). So my first B&E experience happened in the desert foodie mecca that is The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, a (pricey) roll of the dice that left me a winner.

You enter B&E as a customer of their pseudo pawnshop, able to purchase jewelry, guitars, or intergalactic-themed tchotchkes before (or after) dining. Skipping past the display cases, you enter into the restaurant's small lobby, speakeasy reminiscent. Once inside, you're bathed in warming hip-hop and laughter and quick conversations. A cocktail was calling my name as soon as I sat. Any of their options would've done, but I went for the Beauty Elixir, hopeful its ingredients might wash away the circles under my eyes or scrub away laugh lines. These ingredients included rosé and strawberries, cucumber and gin. A sultry combination, it thrilled and delighted and relaxed, the way a Vegas cocktail should. The circles under my eyes remained.

After drinks came the arduous task of whittling down the healthy list of tapas-sized dishes I wanted to try. A big party might have helped here, a group asking for a little of everything. But with just me and hus-bae, we'd have to make some tough decisions.

Ordering a few choices I just couldn't pass up, we ended up taking home a couple boxes of vittles that just couldn't be forced down (though we did manage to sacrifice a couple bites for dessert).

At the end, I call it an exceptional dinner date, an experience I'd love to repeat when the time and pocketbook can make it happen (yes, I would have loved to call FEMA for recompense of all the damage done with my bank card). Beauty & Essex is just one of the reasons why Vegas its little Cosmopolitan gem are something lovely.

From the outside it looks like a pawn store. It actually is the store where you can buy things but under Las Vegas strip law, you're not allowed to pawn anything. It has a collection of jewelry, purses, accessories, and interesting Notorious B.I.G. figures, (photographed below.) There is a security guard at the entrance who opens the door for you and a very pretty and welcoming girl working at the store. You enter the restaurant through the store. When you approach the restaurant there are many lovely hostesses waiting to seat you. My fiancé and I showed up sans reservation and also starving. Luckily, they were able to take us right away. There is the middle dining area that is very busy and lively, and then there is the back room that is little bit darker and carries a different ambience. There is the front section where the bar is. We were walked to the back room. We had a lovely booth. Our server, Crystal approached us and asked if we wanted water. What we heard was ""sparkling or still?"". We order the still water. Come to find out later we would be charged eight dollars for this bottle. Make sure when you go there if you're not planning on spending money on water, you say specifically tapwater or make sure that they will not be charging you for it. Due to how crazy expensive everything is, we only got three dishes. We went with the tomato burrata toast, the tuna tartare tacos, and the wedge salad. She said for two people they recommend 4 to 6 dishes. I thought that was a lot when she said it, but once we got our dishes I understood why. Everything has incredibly small portions for how expensive it is. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and my fiancé had the craft cocktail ""The Woodsman."" It's their style on an old fashioned and it was delicious. Overall, the service was good, the ambience was definitely cool and unique, and the food was good. The prices seemed unreasonable to me. Otherwise it would've had five stars. There is also a Beauty & Essex in Hollywood down the street from where we live that I didn't know about.

The menu is definitely smaller and they have taken of some of their best options. Tomato soup dumplings anyone?

Both locations have kept with the pawn shop speak easy entrance (you can actually buy things in the shop), which is cool. It's clearly their signature.

When my party arrived, I gave our name for the reservation and was met with a very snarky, ""I don't see that name just go to the bar.""

First, I'm not sure what the capacity is in the place but considering they literally jam pack all the tables in I'm thinking they maybe over ""comfortable"" capacity lol. Our chairs were touching the chairs around us and we are not huge big people. Picture this we did have a group of 10 but when our server was one one side of the table in order to get to the other side of our table she had to walk around the table that was next to us. Seriously, she had to go around another table?!!! BC that is how close the chairs were. Totally uncomfortable seating BC even the people at our own table were elbow to elbow. Now granted the booth eating or tables on the outer edge of the restaurant did seem to have more room. But geez if you dont have seating for a large party just say so, dont make it up. 

As for the food it was ok. Nothing too unique that would draw in someone on food alone. I will give props for the grilled cheese, tomato soup. Loved how it was served on individual spoons and the soup itself was really good. Tuna poke tacos very good!! Yellowtail sashimi, disappointing,  being an avid sushi lover it definitely didnt taste fresh at all and for that price you would think it would be somewhat fresh.

I was confused, but when I entered, there was another door that leads us to the restaurant. It felt really magically, it was like entering a whole new world! I was then greeted by tall and gorgeous hostesses. The moment I stepped in the restaurant, I was continuously in awe with the decor and furniture. 

Ambience: The ambience was really relaxed and intimate. The dimmed lighting and soft background music  made it feel romantic in a way. I definitely recommend this for first dates, second dates, third dates, girls night, etc.

Service: The service was excellent, I had about 4 different staff check up on me to see if everything is ok and if I would like to order another drink. Even though the restaurant got really busy, they didn't rush me at all and I was there for about 2 hours just enjoying the decor, food, and drink.

Food: one word, AhMaaaaZinggg! I had the grilled cheese tomato soup dumpling which consisted of 6 dumplings on a spoon and the grilled mushroom pizzetta (goat cheese, truffle oil, herbs, and mushrooms). I paired that with the platinum peacock (virgin cocktail). The platinum peacock was so refreshing and sweet, perfect for a hot day when you're not feeling like drinking alcohol and want something different.",hLA3iEW837Sc_RLSNPFrzw,2,0,4,OwJMr8Ih50-DZ_fIT7r37w

You will not receive quality here.  Had reservations for a small group and was seated in the lounge with tables below your knees. The noise level was so loud that a conversation was impossible. The food was not bad but was not worth the price charged. We tried the Mac n cheese, raviolis, hamachi, some pasta, grill cheese and tomato soup, over cooked sliders, ahi tacos, some other stuff too, nothing memorable. Saw the tomahawk ribeye that our neighbor ordered for $125 and laughed. Was not about to order that piece of sh#t. Bill was $985, with tip $1200. The desert was mediocre, no one finished it, yet we were still hungry. Left still hungry but wasn't about to order anything more. If you're getting tapas pass this place up and go to Fire Flies (salmonella isn't that bad), better yet go to yard house, food is the same quality but will fill you up. You are paying purely for the hype. Go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, Carnivino, Le Cirque, Joël Robuchon, Strip Steak, L'Atelier, Blue Ribbon (when they where open), all are high end dinning with a price tag to match, but you will leave with an experience that was worth it. There are so many good restaurants in Vegas. I feel used after leaving this place. Rarely in my 20 years of living in Vegas have I felt this way. On a positive, our service was excellent. It did not feel like you were in a 5 star restaurant, more like a club/ lounge but our waitress was attentive. I would not blame her for our experience. If the price was 1/3 of what we were charged they would receive 4 stars but with their prices comes expectations, that were not met. I also cannot say we were shocked when we saw the bill, actually thought it would be more, just disappointed every time food was delivered. Pass on this place and go to a restaurant that cares about the food they serve. Price does not always equal quality.",u0i0MwvTMAs2dSJuLGKm_A,0,0,2,hoWtvzl1Us11yzXPFxIsMA

There isn't really any directional signage and the front appears to be a retail store rather than a restaurant. I would recommend making reservations for sure. We came on a Sunday night and there were still a number of large groups and smaller, full tables. I loved the unique decor. What looked like empty wooden frames and window panes surround the dinning room along with vintage looking baubles. The restaurant menu is really designed tapas style which is, in recent years, my favorite way to dine. We tried a few different items including the chicken meatballs. They were very savory, tender but lean which isn't all that common for a meatball.
We also had the sashimi which was very fresh and sliced into delicate thin slices. The only drawback we had was a very loud table behind us that kept dropping cutlery and and just generally being rowdy. However we received a free round of drinks, which may have been our servers way of making up for it. Or maybe he was just really nice. Either way I won't complain :). Check out their website to get a peek at the full menu and the decor.

Great waitress, but the servers bringing the food seemed not happy to be there.  Granted it was a Thursday night and about to get busy but that's what you sign up for if  you are working a restaurant on the strip.

Food was OK, tomato soup and grilled cheese was cute but just ok, salmon ceviche was ok but nothing notable, lobster roll was a tad salty, small pieces of lobster and I did not like the roll...onion rings were a bright spot, hot and crunchy,  the way they should be. Scallops were also good, had some heat but again a little on the salty side.

Each time I was impressed by the service, the ambiance, the decor, and the food itself!

I've tried a good portion of their food now; ranking below are in terms of food taste!

1. GARGANELLI 
- Just pure amazing! Loved the taste, I ended up ordering this for myself the next time I came here! It was just perfection

2. KALE & APPLE SALAD 
- One of the best salads I've ever had!
- Perfect blend of dry cheese, kale, apple, and nuts!

3. TOMATO & CREAMY BURRATA
- Must try for an appetizer! 
- Perfect mix of toast/bread with Burrata cheese!

4. GRILLED ATLANTIC SALMON 
- Came with 3 pieces of salmon
- Great presentation
- The salmon tasted really good!
- The couscous and the other sides/sauces complimented the salmon really well

5. THAI STYLE DEEP-FRIED SHRIMP 
- Great if you love shrimp

6. SPAGHETTINI 
- Generous portion (for a tapas style)
- Tasted very unique and different
- Good try once, but will not get it again

Below are the food which were very average: 

K-TOWN BAO BURGERS
- Tasted very average, nothing special

THIN CRUST GOAT CHEESE PIZZETTA
- Very average thin crust pizza

MEXICAN STREET CORN RAVIOLI
- Some people loved it, I thought it was okay

Food not to get:

14 OZ. PRIME DRY-AGED SIRLOIN
- Worst thing  I tasted on the menu
- Would avoid",jkBOSB5CBB_omGWIHKCIpg,1,0,5,gIvg_7lcXh4ee_3y4R3YLQ

The young woman who served our table was prompt and knowledgeable. She recommended a great oaky white whine that I kind of loved.

This place feels like a scene.  

The food is served in shareable dishes that are flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Everything we ordered did not disappoint.  While it did take a while for the food to arrive the wait staff was very professional. 

What made the experience disappointing was the level of noise inside the restaurant.  I'm not sure it it was all the old mirrors or kitsch interior design but it was prohibitive to conversation.  Yes I can read lips but felt completely over stimulated and would have preferred a a quieter dinning experience given the money I paid.  It was very expensive.  About 125.00 a person.

It literally tastes like Caesar salad on a a piece of toast. The Roasted Bone Marrow is really good & the server will gladly explain how to eat it if you've never had it before.

The Garganelli was the biggest portion & the most filling. It had bolognese sauce & gorgonzola cheese. One of the most popular dishes, Eloté Style Scallops, seems quite simple but is something I'll be craving from now on. It was that good!

We got there and they said the table was not ready. We didn't get seated till around 8:20pm. I don't understand the concept of making a reservation when you still need to wait?

The restaurant was incredibly loud and you could barely hear what anyone is saying. We sat at a small round table. Our waiter was on the other side of the table talking and I couldn't catch anything he was saying so no idea what his name was either. The noise didn't bother us but for others who are looking for something more intimate, this isn't it. 

SERVICE - I felt like this was very poor last night. It took our waiter forever to come back to take our drink order. My two friends said ""I have not even seen our waiter again. Did he forget about us""? So after awhile, we ordered drinks. I would say took 15-20min for those to come out. Even when we ordered food, that didn't come out until 9:25pm. Sometimes when it takes awhile for your food to come, you don't notice it too much because though the wait is long...it's not THAT long. This was one of those waits where your entire table kind of has the realization of ""Wow they are slow. Our food is STILL not here"". And not to mention, we all got our food except for the main guest...our friend celebrating her birthday/graduation. After about 10min of waiting, we had to flag down our waiter to remind him that we were still waiting for her food! 

DRINKS - The drinks were not bad but not very strong either. 

FOOD
Short Rib Mac n Cheese - This was tasty and the flavor was good. Only thing missing was the short rib. We didn't find very many pieces of meat in this. 

Spaghettini - Our friend got this dish and he said it was ""too good to be true"" regarding the noodles being zucchini. He really liked this one. 

Garganelli - This wasn't as good as we hoped. It had a very strong tomato based sauce. 

Beauty & Essex Burger - This was a very juicy burger. The meat was not even close to dry so it was well cooked. Flavor wise, I wasn't crazy about it. It was a little bland in my opinion.

Whaaa? A pawn shop in luxurious Cosmopolitan hotel? That's right, who knew! I've walked by their facade countless times but never once thought that beyond the displays of jewelry, purses, guitars that there's a hidden restaurant inside. Quite cool I'd say. I felt very Bond-esque.

The decor is unique and it has a very mysterious lair-y vibe. Very interesting. But let's move on to the food!

I love tapas! It's the main reason I'm going to Spain soon. I travel for food! But I digress. I started with littleneck clams on the half shell. Although I prefer my oysters my SO thoroughly loved it and he hates oysters. So it's up to your preference I guess. Next we had the grilled cheese dumplings served on individual soup spoons laying atop flavorful tomato soup! It's just as delicious as it looks. My favorite dish of the night happens to be the Tomato Tartare. Now it's interesting because tartares are usually made of meat but in this case, it's just the good 'ol tomatoes. I admit I got it because the pics looked beautiful. Don't judge me! I expected to hate it then pass it on to my SO to finish (hehehe) but I fell in love with it instead. It was packed full of flavor and very pretty to look at as well. It also looked more like beef tartare in person!

We ended with some Reverse S'mores Bites which was perfect. My favorite part of the s'mores was the meringue. So gooey... yum! 10/10 would dine here again.",fy4vOa5DPVKhwyyqW6BiPw,2,2,5,8ZJeY4looic1YTcQcHOqIQ

2627542,2016-07-20,2,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"I have found my new favorite dining experience in Las Vegas, and it is in Beauty & Essex.  You can see the bright yellow sign from the strip off the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, but what you'll find on the inside is culinary genius.  If tapas is your game, then Beauty & Essex is your place!  From the array of photos below, you can see that plates are small but shareable to the extreme.  We split about 9ish dishes between the 4 of us, 2 desserts and 2 rounds of drinks.  Needless to say, we ran up a hefty tab but it's the price you pay for amazing food and drink.

Let's break it down with food first:
-Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -- probably my favorite of the tapas we had.  Cute little wonton tacos with fresh ahi tuna poke inside and a drizzle of wasabi kewpie on top.  Packed with flavor and a nice little punch
-East & West Coast Oysters -- I forgot the ""East Coast"" ones but the West Coast oysters were the kumamotos (my fave), so needless to say they were good.  There was a mignonette served with it but it was too icy for my liking.
-Greek Toast -- one of the simplist dishes we had, but super tasty.  Usually comes in a serving of 3 pieces, but our waiter was nice enough to get 4 so everyone could try.  Fresh veggies and flavors piled on and easy to eat
-""Chile Relleno"" Empanadas -- kinda heavy on the cheese, but I love me some Manchego so I didn't mind all too much!  I wish there was a tad bit more jalapeno-lime crema on top, but the tiny dot was enough to get the idea of the flavor
-Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings -- We almost didn't order these, but I'm really glad we did!!!  The waiter suggested one of the dumplings no matter what, so we opted for this.  Served on spoon, the tomato soup isn't piping hot making it easy to eat.  The culimination of all your favorite things into one spoon-sized bite was incredible.
-Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta -- a very very safe choice for something with great flavors.  Wish it was a tad bit crispier but otherwise very tasy.  Very easy to share and even if you eat like a bird, enough for one person to have.
-Pressed Jerk-Spiced Chicken -- probably my least favorite dish.  Not because it was bad but because jerk spice is not my favorite thing.  I'd probably opt for the meatballs next time.
-Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings -- don't care for onion rings, but these were bomb!!  The sambal ketchup makes them oh so tasty!  They are huge and super filling too.
-Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops -- I had a bite out of this because the guys got it to share.  Tender and pink, the medium rare lamb chops were tasty with a nice glaze on top.
-Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme
-KYGO Cloud Nine ""S'mores"" -- The desserts were honestly larger than any of the tapas.  The S'mores was a little too sweet for my liking but the marshmallow whip on top was delectable!!

Now for drinks:
-Earl the Pearl -- a super strong tea taste to this one, so if tea is not up your alley don't bother.  I thought it was a good drink to have while you were eating because of all the subtleties to avoid washing out the flavor of the foods.
-Bubbles & Berries -- if you're into more sweet this is for you.  At first it seems a little intimidating (champagne, vodka AND st. germain) but it's not as strong as you'd think.  Loved having it after our meal as something sweet on my palette.

SO.  If the menu doesn't win you over, I hope this does.  It doesn't hurt that the staff is AMAZING and the restaurant itself is gorgeous. Just do yourself a favor and eat here.",X77_7mi1kvTy9FKIvrn0sw,1,0,5,6NX2ZgsWrJnHrB5Nj061EQ

One of my new favorites are the French Onion Soup Dumplings! Soooooo good! They also have Short Rib Mac And Cheese that could have had a bit more short rib but still delicious. The Jerk Chicken hit the nail on the head in flavor. I wanted to eat the whole thing myself. Majority of plates are for sharing and they will customize the amount of food on the plate (one or two more) so everyone can enjoy the selections. We wrapped the meal up with Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sunday topped with pretzels, Butterscotch Pudding, and a few had Milk Shake Birthday Cake Shots. The pudding will always be a favorite of mine. I loved that they carried much of the New York layout and decor into this new location. The music was great and it kept the atmosphere fun. The wait staff was fantastic!

The service was excellent. We were waited on by a couple of staff members and both were very knowledgeable about the menu as well as attentive and polite overall. 

We tried the salmon ceviche, the arepas, the macaroni and cheese, and the mushroom pizzette. The mushroom pizzette was our overall favorite, followed by a tie for second place between the arepas and the macaroni. The arepas tasted like a small bite of a genuine arepa, with a nice twist of the jalapeño. The ceviche didn't impress, with the flavor being bland overall. 

For dessert we had the donuts and the peanut butter pie sundae. Both were good, with the donuts having slightly too much sugar. We had to dust them off a bit before eating each one. 

Overall it was a good dinner but for the price I would expect a slightly better overall experience. The acoustics really were my biggest complaint.",bP0lrXulZoX9-QTv4vU2oA,1,1,3,3Qy7P5w19H_1-gfDq8v6Rg

2668553,2016-05-19,11,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Everything good ages and fades and so does beauty, apparently.  Chef Chris Santos brought his highly renowned Beauty & Essex restaurant from NYC to Las Vegas and a majority of its menu along with it.  This is not without change, however, and many things that make the former location great have simply gone missing.

The pawn shop in the exterior front greets you upon arrival.  A door past all the purchasable items leads you to the actual restaurant.  The ambiance is fitting to the name; dim, posh, beautiful with frames, lockets, and pendants hanging from the walls.  A walk past the bar led us to the first of three rooms to dine in.  Gone are the strip views present in the former occupant of this space (Comme Ca') and in its place, a wall.

Our meal for the night:

Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings-  A signature of B & E.   My daughter and wife enjoyed this more than I.  

French Onion Soup Dumplings-  Warning. This can and will burn you the moment you take your first bite if you're not careful.   Not sure if it was the onions, a bit of soup, or what else filled the dumpling, but it did a number on my bottom lip.  Cautiously, I enjoyed the rest of these afterwards.

Yellowtail Sashimi-  Eight thinly sliced yellowtail topped with peppers in a soy chili sauce.  Excellent dish.

Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs -  Three delicious, large-sized meatballs topped with sheep's milk ricotta in a truffle sauce.  A must order when dining here in my opinion.

L.E.S. Donuts - Essentially malasadas which came with caramel, chocolate, and raspberry dipping sauces.  The first caramel sauce came out solidified, unable to be dipped so we asked for a replacement.  Not really worth the price.

The service was okay with minor hiccups.  A few times we asked questions about the food which could not be answered quickly.  The ice cream / sorbet flavors of the night could not be listed without our server having to excuse herself from our table to check back with the kitchen.  

Of things to note:  No foie gras on the menu anywhere.  We are in Las Vegas!  While their NYC location at least offered foie for a certain time period, foie should be a given here and it really is one of the defining items of which I'd come back for if it were executed well.

Another MAJOR missing standout experience:  No champagne bar in the bathroom like its sister location in New York.  In fact, no bathroom at all inside the restaurant!  I asked a host to show us the bathroom to wash our hands and he proceeded to guide me outside past the pawn shop to the common areas of the Cosmopolitan.  As soon as I realized this, I told him I'll finish my dinner first and went back to my table.

The pricing of the items were a few dollars higher and I suppose 'justified' being located on the Las Vegas Strip.  With that said, the food was fairly expensive for what you do receive and I'm not sure anything we tried would have us returning a second time.

This is it! Huh? So we walked into this TINY store, around to the back, and opened up a door that led to a MASSIVE restaurant. WHAAATTT? Amazingly cool surprise. The food is a similar style to Rose Rabbit Lie, in that it's small portions that are meant to be shared, so you get to try a little bit of everthing. And we most definately did. The server suggested 5 items would be good, but we decided to stuff ourselves and went for 6 + dessert.
Tuna Poke Wonton tacos - really fresh but way too spicy for me. Hubs loved them, though
Roasted Bone Marrow - This was a hail mary because we've been wanting to try it for awhile. On it's own, we weren't fans, but add the frills they serve with it, very good.
Brussel Sprout Salad - TRY THIS!!!! It was my favorite out of everything.
Grilled Cheese, Bacon, and Tomato soup dumplings - The soup was so flavorful and the ""dumplings"" were potato (I think) filled with melted cheese topped with bacon. AMAZING!
Lamb Chops - another try this! Delicious and huge!

I'm glad I did.

From start to finish, our meal was fantastic and exceeded my expectations. 

So it is a jewelry store our front, lol, which confused me as the door to the restaurant is somewhat disguised like a hidden door. But once you get in, there is no mistaking it. 

A warning now: if you wanted a private, intimate dinner, go somewhere else. B&E is crazy loud. Reminds me of being in a club at South Beach. You will have to lean in and yell to have conversation. Definitely a lot of energy.

Normally this is not my cup of tea, but I can make exceptions for extraordinary food. The menu is setup for sharing with small plates, so for 2 people we had 5 plates. Wagyu sliders, tomato soup and cheese pot stickers, pork belly, lamb chops, and a lamb Bolognese pasta.

Each and every plate was amazing. I really didn't think it would be, but they were all perfect. Each of them were very unique, and we felt they all hit the spot.

For dessert, we had the carrot cake and smores. Both also good, but perhaps not as unique or creative.

You probably know this already, but to find Beauty and Essex you need to wade through a pawn shop full of pastiche such as a mini Biggie Smalls and faux jewelry. There is nothing fake about the food when you finally get to your table.

For starters it took almost 20 min to get water.  I received my cocktail before anyone ever got their water glass filled at the table.  I couldn't even drink the cocktail.  I think it was called Beauty Elix.  I'm not sure what they did to it but it was watered down and and had no taste.  The prosecco it was topped with was flat.  Everyone at my table tried it and agreed there was no hope for it.  We sent it back and the server was very nice about it but didnt seemed the least bit surprised we stated it didn't taste right.  The next cocktail I ordered was called the Woodsman it has Woodford reserve, all spice dram, maple syrup and pears.  I expected this cocktail to be amazing but it again tasted watered down and had ALOT of ice in it.  I felt it was shaken instead of being stirred like it was probably intended to be.  It had potential but should have had more complexity to it for the ingredients it stated to have.


The server Holly seemed sweet but she was not that knowledgeable when we asked for recommendations and also forgot to put some of our food in.  She tried to play it off as if we should have gotten it already but that didn't make her look that good either.  She seemed fairly flustered the entire night.  Our food came out slowly and we had to wait a little while between dishes.  Keep in mind I work in food and beverage  management, and our group was of all bartenders or food servers.  It not like we haven't all had off days.  There was no service recovery attempt and it seemed like a downward spiral at this point.

The Dessert we ordered was the S'mores dish.  It was VERY sweet and not quite what you would expect given the description.  Should have played it safe with the donuts.  They did put a candle in it and sing happy birthday as we were celebrating my best friend's birthday, which was a plus!

The food here was good, but the portions were so small.  The server suggested the group of 4 I was apart of share 5 or 6 items.  That would have no way been enough.  We ordered way more and spent almost $100 each on tiny shared plates and a few mediocre cocktails.


After the wait for the water, returned cocktail and forgotten food items you would have thought a manager would make an attempt to touch the table to get a feeling of the situation but that was most certainly not the case.  I would normally go back to give another chance but after all that I'm not sure I want to spend my money there again.

Highlight was the decor and ambiance despite the very loud music.  The entry through a small shop and the hidden feel are definitely intriguing.",lLS3A-62z7oJGj1KSso53g,2,0,2,mROEnxQeTTohmr311mgW6w

-- Thai-style deep fried shrimp: my absolute favorite of the night! Next time I'll get an order of five just for myself! My other faves include: crispy vidalia onion rings, chile relleno arepas, & the adorable spoonfuls of grilled cheese & tomato soup dumplings. 
-- the seafood dishes, shrimp cocktail & lobster roll, were good, but not great.
-- pulled chicken arepas & short rib mac & cheese sounded delicious, but didn't meet my expectations. 
-- By the time the 10 oz. filet & 14 oz. ribeye arrived, we were too stuffed to really enjoy them; next time we'll request that they be served somewhere in between the many smaller courses. 
-- did not try: garganelli, pressed jerk spiced chicken, tuna, & braised chicken meatballs. 
-- desserts: petite cupcakes, devil's food layer cake (super delicious), & butterscotch pot de creme 

I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Chris Santos the night we went & he was so sweet & charming!! I'll have to give B&E in New York a second chance (in hopes of running into him there!) ;)",kZJWAY828P8QZTqVYzhTCg,7,4,4,kebti1wgkrkW2AG-2lItmg

I LOVED the Emerald Gimlet drink, so fresh and basil-y.  My friend really enjoyed The Woodsman.

I read a lot of reviews and maybe that affected me but many people were right. You're in and out fast. The food comes super quick so there's no time to digest, enjoy and spend some time. I guess they want you out fast. It's their loss tho because I think people would drink more if lingering were encouraged. 
Sooooo the food: 
I loved the tuna tacos and the burger. 
It was silly to order oysters. They were meh and we can get them at home. My partner loved the ravioli. The green beans were pretty good too. Our neighbours at the next table had enviable and gorgeous onion rings. For some reason they didn't like the mushroom salad and the staff were gracious and removed it and didn't charge them. 
Our server kind of ruined the mood. She was kind of snooty about the wine. In fairness she let us return a bottle we didn't like but she wasn't warm and friendly. Quite the opposite. For me I love to chat w the server and those interactions really influence the experience. She did nothing to enhance our experience. Quite the opposite.

2757273,2018-01-15,2,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"I have heard great things about B&E, which opened about a year or some ago in LA. Fancy, shiny, and bougie - all the criteria above desired when choosing a dinner spot to reunite with one of my best friends! We decided we wanted to glam up on a Saturday night and there was indeed, not a more perfect spot. First and foremost, my experience was probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever ever had. Location, service, food selection, style, taste, and company- all were remarkable 10/10. 

We ordered: 
1. Old fashioned: one with the reserve whiskey option and a second with the makers option. Then a shot of bourbon for a fun activity (see #4). All the great food that is about to be listed was later 'wasted' because of this decision here. But still, worth it!
2. Yellowtail sashimi : this came first and was really refreshing. I love the acidity and the dressings that came on top. A great starter to really prepare your palette for the great things about to come next. 
3. Dumplings in tomato soup : presentation was beautiful. 6 perfect spoon bites prepared beautifully. The cheese in the dumplings mixed well with the saltiness of the tomato soup. Warm and a play on texture. 
4. Bone Marrow: my favorite dish. 3 bones with flakey toast assembled in a jenga-like manner, served with a marmalade and salt on the side. I have to admit that one bone did not have any marrow which was disappointed but nearly forgotten because of how tremendous everything else was. It was buttery and the marmalade paired with it harmoniously. We also poured down bourbon shots into the bone marrow- a fun experience but taste is .. well, bourbon. 
5. The scallops: buttery freaking goodness. When you read reviews and they say ""get this!"" .. yeah, it's definitely an understatement. These scallops were cooked like I've never tasted them before. They melted in my mouth and the purée underneath was just a bonus. I could eat a hundred of these. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal. 

Our waitress, Erin, was the best waitress I've ever had. She was fun, bubbly, and seriously had the cutest personality. I literally wanted to befriend her so badly, but that would be creepy (only slightly). She gave recommendations, advised if we ordered too much, showed us how to take our bone marrow shots, took videos of it for us (with commentary), and even told us that we should go to Marquee because they stamp us for free access when you eat at B&E, which led us to a full an fun night even after our already tremendous dining experience.

For the appetizers we ordered the ahi tacos (very good but tinnnnnny), Brussels sprouts ( not great), and we ordered two drinks ...neither of us enjoyed it. My glass was full at the end of our dinner and the waitress didn't care to ask if we wanted to try something else. My fiancé ordered the steak and I had the corn scallops which were great.

2764318,2016-12-21,15,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Top notch everything! Coming from NYC and Food Network's Chris Santos, B&E was already an experienced restaurant that knows how to provide a great experience. If you come with a group of all girls, you are treated to a glass of Prosecco in a little lounge area. You then enter the restaurant through what looks to be an upscale pawn shop and make your way over to the large door that transports you into the world of beauty. Every bit of decor is well thought out, from the gorgeous lighting fixtures in the entry which function as a work of art in themselves, to the frames with vintage necklaces hanging in them which create a faux wall. There is a bar/lounge and even a Dj spinning. Every staff member is courteous, experienced, and professional.

You don't have to spend a ton of money here although the atmosphere is upscale. Cocktails are on the pricey side so if you leave those out, your bill won't be too high. Food is meant to be shared family style and comes out pretty quickly. I wish they would have paced it a little better. But between 7 of us we shared 5 dishes and ordered one cocktail, and only spent $26 each after a generous tip. The food was phenomenal, and some dishes were quite unique. 

The most unique dish was the French Onion Soup Dumplings. They are served in a little dish topped with a huge melted layer of cheese, and you pick it up with the toothpick. It gives you a burst of flavor! The Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs were another favorite of mine. You are served 3 large, juicy meatballs topped with a mound of whipped ricotta, sitting in a wild mushroom and truffle sauce. These are a must. The Garganelli is a lamb bolognese instead of beef, so the flavor was a little odd to me and this was the only dish I would pass on. 

As for the desserts, we were served a complimentary sampler platter. The Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme was out of this world! The butterscotch was so smooth and creamy, with the perfect amount of sweetness. I basically ate this whole thing by myself. Another favorite was the Spiked Root Beer Float Shot. This was so unique and fun, and even had sprinkles in it. So much more on the menu sounded great that I can't wait to come back the next time I am in Vegas.

I had heard mixed things about B & E, but generally speaking that there was some good food and vibes to be had.  so I had to make it a point to get reservations while in Sin City. Arrived slightly late at the entrance and noticed the facade which had a pretty neat vibe and the staff were friendly in ushering us in. The front seems to be kind of like an older antiquities kind of store feel to give the speakeasy kind of vibe ( but in a different light)...Anyhow, I digress, we met our group and were placed at our table. Space was nice and table was dimly lit. Overall really nice vibe although a bit loud to have good conversations with some of the people across from you. Service was solid and waiter was more than helpful in laying out the variety of tapas they have on deck. Had many different types of food but came away loving the grilled cheese ( which had a burst of flavor in such a small bite), the tuna poke wonton tacos which were stunning ( we eventually ordered 2 more)  of, and the salmon ceviche which was delectable! We also ordered the burrata bruschetta which was brilliant...drinks were on point and overall a meal not to be missed!

Great music - There was a Asian Female DJ who was on Fleek with the 90's and early 2K hip hop joints. Since that what me and the company I was with, enjoyed, we knew it was going to be a good night.

The food - had the Sashimi Yellowtail with Jalapeno - excellent grade and thinly cut. Definitely something that you crave a night or 2 after.
Had the lobster Roll which was good too! The roll is what made it too... It was like a grilled King's Hawaiian type flavor bread. The lobster was made to perfection and its mayo mix was on point!
The grilled cheese, wrapped in bacon and tomato soup was a great presentation and good. Had the house salad which was pretty amazing. The bone marrow was probably one of our favorites!
We were celebrating a promotion so we indulged on the cowboy ribeye steak. As you could probably tell from my previous reviews, I am a big steak guy. Though cooked to perfection, it didn't hold up to Golden Steer's Ribeye. I wanted it to, trust me! I wanted it to be the best steak I've had and taste as pretty as it looked but it was only partially there. Was it better than most... Yes. But not the best that I have had. 
We had the donuts for dessert, as well and they were great! 

All in all Beauty and Essex was awesome and we had a great time and the food is great here. It is in a premier location and do look forward to coming back. I know the set back was the 125 dollar steak but that is ok. I know that they will improve cause they know how competitive the strip and well just Vegas in general is!

I came here with some coworkers.  We loved their tomato soup, the one that has the grilled cheese dumplings in it.  Some of my co workers gushed for days about their scallops, the ones with the bbq fries.  The service here was wonderful.  I ended up coming back here on my own, to have a nice drink before catching up with some other friends before we headed out to Marquee for the night. Tapas menus are wonderful and it's the perfect place to share so many things.  I really enjoyed their wedge salad too, not too huge and not too over done with dressing or other toppings. Everything was perfecto!! Beware. . . this venue is pretty tight. So, I don't know that it's the place for a big group unless you make arrangements with management somehow. I only mention that because while dining here, a large group of about 10-15 people strolled in and they almost had to consider sitting in smaller groups throughout the restaurant unless they were willing to wait for a cluster of tables to open up. oops",GHYUiM3elmIbwpwrIqR_ew,0,0,4,nF60qqOAUaoHVt_z3AISug

I originally was planning on making a reservation to the LA location, but was conveniently in Vegas this past weekend. My boyfriend and I had no interest in clubbing so we chose to have a romantic date night here, and needless to say, we were not let down! 

Ambience: You make your way through a brightly lit pawnshop, and open up a door to the lounge, where it is dim and quite crowded. The decor by the bar caught my eye with the red couch and art pieces on the walls. It is brimming with energy, and the loud music definitely uplifts the mood.  
 
Food/Drinks: We ate earlier in the day so we just ordered the yellowtail sashimi and the grill cheese/bacon/tomato soup dumplings and the bubbles n berries drink. My mouth is drooling from just thinking about how savory the yellowtail sashimi was! The texture was a perfect pair of smooth and crunchy, and the flavor soaked in the taste buds. I liked the soup dumplings as well, but I personally am not a fan of the slightly overwhelming cheesiness of the dish. My favorite part of this dish would be the presentation of the dumplings in alternating soup spoons. Perfect for sharing!

Our server gave us amazing customer service, especially when he first came out with the menu and talked about some of the dishes. My only complaint of this place would be how loud it can get--my boyfriend and I resorted to yelling over the music multiple times to be heard.

All in all, it was a great choice to come here for a date night! Next time I'll hit up the LA location with my girls :)",J16y0a5dWcYrcpC7clzOfQ,1,1,4,FrWI0OGf0zvAAmrCvNweoA

3109003,2017-02-05,25,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Beauty & Essex is the sexiest restaurant in Vegas. Located inside the gorgeous Cosmopolitan hotel, it's hidden behind what appears to be a quiet jewelry shop. We gave the woman behind the counter our reservation name, and she led us to a side door which almost made us feel as if we were being taken back into a speakeasy. 

Once inside, the atmosphere instantly changed and was a whirlwind of nightlife and energy. Lots of dark accents and soft lighting, beautiful people, stunning plates of food, and lounge music playing in the background. I loved that they had matches in a bowl by the hostess stand too, as it reminded me of all the ones I collected from fancy restaurants over the years when I was younger during special family occasion dinners. 

It was easy to make a reservation through OpenTable, and the corner booth we were given was ideal for people watching during our meal. None of us were particularity starved, so our game plan was to order a bunch of smaller plates and share them tapas style. That way we could also each try a little bit of everything. 

My friend and I each got a glass of wine while my husband ordered a beer, and we decided to first start with their dumplings since those were what I had heard so much about. The french onion soup ones came out first, and were presented in what appeared to be an escargot dish.

The dumplings were filled with an onion soup broth, and were at the bottom of a toothpick. When you lifted it up, a string of melty cheese would follow and you simply pop the whole thing in your mouth and pull the toothpick out. A crouton is at the end of each bite which gave a nice added texture. They were insane! Putting french onion soup into dumpling form was a downright genius idea. 

I didn't think it was possible that I would love anything else that night as much as those, until the next dumplings came out which were grilled cheese and smoked bacon dumplings that sat on a spoonful of rich tomato soup. STOP IT. Actually don't, because I would like to eat about 89,000 more of those in my lifetime please. 

We also ordered sweet and crispy Vidalia onion rings that came with a deliciously kicked up sambal ketchup, street style BBQ thai chicken with fresh picked carrots, mango, and a flavorful parsnip puree, and I believe french fries may have come into the equation at some point too, don't judge. 

Each plate exceeded our expectations and kept our taste buds singing. I can't wait to make a return visit to try some of the dishes I didn't get to the first time around. In particular the bone marrow toast, chicken arepas, the short rib mac and cheese, elote scallops, strawberry shortcake bars, peanut butter pie sundae, and birthday cake shots.",niTdjI2tBGiZJLhNWtyqdw,36,36,5,dNXAuVqgmlduTdtgRwFiGQ

3168282,2017-10-15,2,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"On September 30th, my group of 10 ventured over to Beauty and Essex for a nice dinner before seeing a show. Due to our large group size, we made certain we had reservations a few weeks in advance. I'll admit. I was intrigued by the idea that we had to go through a pawn shop, which they assured everything was all purchasable, to gain entry to the restaurant. 

To no surprise, the restaurant and bar had a speak easy vibe. There was a long bar with low lighting. If you turned right, there was a round room for enjoying cocktails dressed in long velvet fabrics and chandeliers. If you continued on down the long bar, it opened to the dining area with antiques mirrors, more chandeliers and close knit seating. The acoustics of the room made it extremely hard to hear and our kind waiter, who seemed to be losing his voice, had some difficulty trying to explain the menu so he was patient enough to repeat himself around our table to make sure we understood everything. 

All menu items are served tapas style. There were certain menu items that seemed very shareable but some of what seemed like main entrées such as steak and fish, which typically would be enough for an individual, was also presented as tapas. My group was confused and looked to me to suggest what to do because we don't have all the same taste and perhaps didn't want to share in everyone else's meal necessarily. I told them just to order how they usually would and if they wanted others to try the dish, just cut them a few bites... problem solved! 

With the inability to hear each other when talking due to the loudness of the room and the ordering situation, my group was having doubt in my choice of restaurant... that was UNTIL the food came out. The food silenced their doubt and they were immediately consumed in eating and all smiles. Two of my friends ordered the steak, and it was probably one of the best we've enjoyed ever. Had they not shared some of it, I never would've expected I would find such amazing steak there!

My husband and I enjoyed the following:
Chile Relleno Empanadas - poblano peppers, manchego cheese, jalapeño lime cream. Spicy but delicious!
Spanish chorizo arancini - a lovely Spanish twist to an Italian family classic.  It had piquillo peppers, tomato, and saffron aioli. 
Grilled cheese, Smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - familiar comfort food served on spoons. Tasty and a home run since it's always been a childhood fav! 
Woodsman Cocktail - I didn't want an Old Fashioned since that's what I always order so I ordered this. It was Makers 46 Bourbon, allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon, and muddled pears. I really loved this.

Would we return? Definitely but maybe with a smaller group or even just my husband and I. This place is fits an intimate setting and even though they accommodate large groups, you can only truly enjoy the company of those immediately next to you. I love the atmosphere, and they even offered free champagne to the ladies before entering the pawn shop entrance. The staff was wonderful. Our waiter whose last name is Heimer (at least that's what the receipt listed) was so accommodating and patient. The guy who opened the door for us at the entrance of the pawn shop was so fun and even after took our group picture!

The premise of it - a pawn shop façade housing a rousing bunch of party guests behind it - was all very clever and fun.  But oh my goodness - this place is a perfect example of how atmosphere can equally reflect on a restaurant just as much as it's food - and not always in a good way.

But first, what we ate:

Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - good, but the raw tuna presented a texture issue for me
Wedge Salad - heavy (as bleu cheese just is) but very good
Roasted Bone Marrow with Onion Marmalade - good but not the best I've ever had; Jean George inside Aria is my favorite
Grilled Cheese Tomato Soup Dumplings - their most popular and really quite a unique take on something so familiar; loads of creamy cheese inside; however, it was just too thick with cheese for me
Chuck Sliders - good; order by the EACH, which is good as I don't always want a trio of sliders
Onion Rings - homemade; always a plus!

We wanted to have dessert but we couldn't bring ourselves to it.  Not because of the food, which was fine.  It was the NOISE.  This restaurant is the noisiest place I've ever been to, and I've eaten fine dining all across the U.S.  It was awful.  The dining room was packed to the gills with tables, lights were very dimmed, and the hum of voices was so loud, all I felt was claustrophobia.  I could not enjoy my meal AT ALL.  We had to get out of there - fast.  Probably the quickest fine dining meal of my life.

I recommend this place to people if they are okay with noise and tight spaces.  Because the food is fine.  We liked what we ate.  But considering the atmosphere, I'd always make a point to mention it before a full-on recommendation.  Maybe one day they will re-work the aesthetic and then we would definitely give it another go.",5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ,1,1,3,83M6WoDDgRglzGmjB-br8A

Not to mention that the food is phenomenal! We had the Chicken Meatballs, which were so light and so moist, and the Elote Style Scallops, which were perfectly cooked and super flavorful. I'm a sucker for s'mores, so we had the s'mores for dessert - SO GOOD! The marshmallow wasn't overly sweet. 

As far as cocktails, I had the Bubbles and Berries, which seems to be their most popular cocktail. They also brought me a root beer shot along with our dessert. 

I will totally be back here again! (In fact, we made reservations as we left to come back for dinner and cocktails before the Britney Spears concert.)

The menu is on the pricey side, think big plates, tiny portions. One of us ordered the ceviche thinking it'd be shareable among the 5 of us, but it's literally 3 mini tortilla cup shells. However, it did taste delicious! We also ordered the Short Rib Mac & Cheese, and a Kale & Apple salad, both have a good plate/portion ratio. There was way too much bread crumb toppings on the mac & cheese which made it really dry, but I mean, it was pretty good if you avoid it and get the macs at the bottom where all the sauce was. The salad was really light and refreshing, and was a good balance since the mac & cheese was so heavy. 

We didn't order any desserts either, but it sounded pretty good; there's one named after Kygo! (I'm assuming). We didn't order any drinks either, but they all looked interesting!

I'd been wanting to try Beauty & Essex after my excellent experience at The Stanton Social a couple months ago so I figured it would be a nice spot for my girls and I to have our last dinner in Vegas at. I made a 10pm reservation because it was the only time available so I would recommend making reservations as far in advance as possible. The host was very friendly and we had to wait about 10 minutes before our table was ready which was fine, we were told there was complimentary champagne in the pawn shop if we were interested. Once seated our waitress came over and explained the menu and the recommended amount of dishes we should order based on our party size. There were 3 of us and the recommendation was 6-8 dishes, having been to The Stanton Social previously I felt like that was way too many dishes so we started off with 3 - chorizo mac and cheese, ropa vieja tacos, and the grilled cheese & tomato soup dumplings. My dinner companions were initially skeptical having never had tapas before they were quickly convinced that this was the right choice  because everything had so much flavor and was finger licking good. After we finished the 3 dishes we decided to order a larger dish from their ""entree"" section and another side- we went with the pork chop and onion rings. The pork chop was incredibly flavorful. We concluded our meal with the doughnuts of course- soooo delicious. Our waitress was incredibly kind and attentive and informative, she was consistently checking in to make sure we were ok  had such a pleasant demeanor, I wish I could remember her name to shout her out. Also, my friends and I had no trouble communicating over the music, it was definitely not blaring by any means.

3281383,2017-09-04,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"This was one of two special, standout meals during my trip to Vegas for a bachelorette party over Labor Day weekend. Everything here is tapas style, so it's good to come with a group and share. But even with two people, all you really need is a few dishes and dessert for a full meal.

The vibe here is really bustling (and LOUD). It's pretty dark but there's cool, classy decor. You enter through a pawn shop of sorts with interesting, edgy trinkets that I unfortunately didn't get to really look at much, but the ladies who greet you are really nice and smiley. The crowd leans younger and well dressed, but definitely some older groups as well and people not dressed up for a night out. Either way, it's a good time!

The standout, and what they're famous for, is the grilled cheese tomato soup bites. That doesn't sound like much, but it's so well executed, and the moment that you get to the part with the cheese inside the bite of bread is just...life's small pleasures that you live for, haha. I only wish that I could have more than one of them! There were 4 of us and it came in 6.

We got 5 tapas (the waiter actually pointed out that our order was heavy and if we wanted any veggies...hahah hmm ok then), and they were all delicious. Another standout is the tuna poke tacos, very clean tasting and fun to eat. 

Service is great too and our waters kept getting refilled. But awkward that for whatever reason, our waiter thought we were celebrating a birthday...and brought us out complimentary happy birthday cake (really it's truffles on a stick) pop. We also ordered dessert (s'mores) and that ended up being free because of the mistake/misunderstanding. The s'mores were interesting (not what you'd have at the beach) and the cookie is more like a graham cracker flavored puff crisp of sorts, which I'm sure takes some gourmet chef genius to do, but overall the ""s'mores"" were disappointing. The complimentary cake pops were actually better and hit the spot; very rich, so all you need is one max. I wish we had stuck with their most popular dessert -- donuts/beignets which looked generous with a bowl of them and three dipping sauces.

The staff really tried hard to make up for the problems I experienced, but there's only so many times and so much they can do before you question things. I still greatly enjoyed my meal but it was filled with errors all night long. 

We came at 10pm on a reservation but weren't seated until 10:45pm. Considering we had a reservation, that's fairly ridiculous. I do understand they can't seat us until a table is open, but don't offer me the reservation option in the first place then. It's an easy thing to honor.  We were offered a free drink ticket to compensate us for the wait, however, which was a nice touch. 

The food and drinks were very good during the meal. To drink we had the woodsman (bourbon based, little too sweet), the electric avenue (strong, old fashioned type, very good), and the bubbles and berries (fruity, boozy, great). To eat we had the tomato tartare, sliders, fish tacos, and ratatouille. Here's where the biggest issue came - the pace of the meal. The only explanation I can think of is the kitchen forgot about us. The tartare came out fast enough. It was exceptional; it was one of the better dishes I've had in Vegas actually. It had a sundried tomato taste with a small runny egg on top. Our next dish, the fish taco, came out literally an hour later. The fries on top were exceptional while the actual taco was just fine. The sliders were quite nice and actually an ok deal at $8 each. The ratatouille came last, a little out of order if you ask me, but was very good. I wish it came out wth the sliders to make that a full meal but whatever.  The presentation of all the dishes was a nice touch. 

Because we waited so long for our food we were again offered free drinks and dessert. The staff was really trying to make it up to us but at that point it was getting kind of funny that our meal just kept getting wrecked and fixed nonstop. So in the end we tried the donuts and root beer float. I would say the donuts in chocolate sauce were great but the float and the rest of the sauces were a pass. Very good coffee here as well. 

So after a good meal and all the free drinks and dessert, the meal only cost $75. That's a ridiculous steal even after a 3 hour atypical food excursion. I would come back because I really think they were having an off night and they deserve another chance. They do try to make it up to you if they mess up so I appreciate that, but my advice is, as a customer, give yourself time, don't make plans right after the dinner, and expect a long meal.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,1,4,gthvYY9byqSm86Qp-UeerA

Overcooked steak: I asked for medium. I got almost well done. This was disappointing. Even left a few pieces behind....  
French onion soup dumplings: Served at room temp (barely warm), so the cheese wasn't  ooey or gooey. 
Short rib Mac and Cheese: the mac and cheese tasted good but there were tiniest morsels of short rib that you could barely see or taste. 

Ambience--not nearly as glamorous or stunning as the one LES. Not even close.  Also, the free champagne bar is outside of the restaurant, which is kind of weird, logistically speaking. Even weirder than a bar in a bathroom!     

Drinks--Cocktail list is almost identical to the one in the LES. Drinks here are pricey and strong. Sadly, I couldn't finish my second drink, but since we are in Vegas they poured it into a ""to go"" cup for me. 
 
Service-- the bartender was efficient and the server was extra bubbly. It's unfortunate the food was so bad.

We tried the beef tartar which we both really liked, the bone marrow which was tasty but there was almost no marrow at all so it was not really worth. We also tried the cauliflower dish. My wife liked this dish but I wasn't the biggest fan. I guess because i was expecting the Korean style red, hot and spicy cauliflower that we've had in a few other places before and this was not that.

Beauty & Essex isn't a Vegas OG, but at least it fits in there (especially inside Cosmo). And nobody is telling them that they should've just stayed in NYC.

Things were pretty chill at the start, but a dose of energy was injected into the place once upbeat music (largely from the 90s) came on. The effects of the libations began to kick in. Service was on - plates came out left and right. A few other parties trickled in. It was already more exciting than being at an NFL game in LA (well, so is watching grass grow).

But when it came to the menu, the ""Accessories"" and ""Shared Plates"" were more intriguing to me than their ""Mains."" It was as if we only selected the Mains we did out of a feeling of obligation that we should get some dishes from that part of the menu. A few didn't seem to square with their upscale image, and it was actually some of their smaller plates that impressed the most. For that reason, I'd recommend B&E as more of a 'drinks and apps' type of place.

*ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: sprouts are in now, and B&E is in the game with their version featuring applewood bacon

I feel like we ordered one of everything. My top of the list favorites are the tomato soup/grilled cheese bite. It is served on one if those Asian white soup spoons and it perfect. My second favorite were the meatballs. They were spiced perfectly and the sauce was awesome. Very creamy and delicious. 
My boss likes his red meat medium well so when we ordered the filet I was worried it might be overcooked for me. However despite the temperature and no red at all it was incredibly tender. Very impressive. The kale salad is also very impressive. I eat kale solely because it is good for me, but personally I don't really like it. However with the salad I actually Alex for seconds. The garden salad was also good. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Our server went out if her way to work with the tables food allergies. She was extremely knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable knowing that she was making an eye on everything.

Dinner for two. escorted promptly to a corner booth in one of the back rooms, with a view of the room. Unbelievably noisy. The place has zero sound dampening. The crowd wasn't a young one, either. Mostly late 30s/early 40s convention people. Not at all conducive to conversation.

Service was polite but extremely rushed. They looked like they couldn't wait to churn the table. Dishes arrived all at once instead of coursed out as they should. If this restaurant was in Italy, dinner would have taken twice as long and been all the better for it.

Cocktails were obviously prepared by a ""mixologist"" who is more interested in being ""creative"" than putting out good drinks. None of the three we tried were worth the money.

Food was a mixed bag. The wedge salad was good (how hard is it to screw up?) with a tasty buttermilk blue cheese dressing. The chorizo arancini were way too dense for the dish. Aioli was bright and helped. The standout small plate was the grilled cheese and bacon/tomato soup dumplings. Creative and delicious. The short rib mac & cheese was a tremendous disappointment. Very bland and dry. Like they ran out of cheese and flavor half-way through prep.

Desserts were top notch. The pot du crème surpasses even that served at Wynn Country Club, while the New York donuts were light, airy, melt in your mouth gems.

All in all, Beauty & Essex is a place I'm glad we tried, but I'd never go back to. There are much better places to eat at Cosmopolitan, where they don't rush you and actually care about the food and drink they serve.",AaCUrnB9ma-ZhytPj3Fh1Q,0,0,2,6vvmB01NyLxnowRNLUdHiQ

Anyway, while the prices are Vegas Strip premium here, a lot of their dishes were on point.

Roasted Bone Marrow - This dish was fantastic.  The bone marrow was cooked to perfection as well as the carmelized onions.  I kid you not though, the place that sets this place apart was the bread.  Something about that buttery garlicy-ness sets it off.  

French Onion soup dumplings - While the cheese they used was really good, I didn't care too much for this dish.  I was expecting soupy dumplings...like a french onion soup xiaLongBao.  All you get is a dumpling filled with carmelized onions.  

Grilled cheese , bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - This was more my style.  There was actual soup this this.  Too bad they don't serve this by the bowl.

Thai style deep fried shrimp - Great dish.  The shrimp was good quality and the slaw was perfect.

Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta - Ordered this by somehow it came with a bunch of pepperoni and meat.  I wonder if this was intentional?  This dish was okay.  Never thought I'd say this but there was actually too much meat too the point where it made the pizza too salty.

Brussel Sprouts - They could have done a better job carmelizing the outside of the brussel sprouts but this dish was solid.  It was a bit soggy because it soaked up too much oil.

Short rib mac and cheese - I liked how the short rib flavor got into the guts of the cheese flavor.  

Basil Pesto ravioli with Rock shrimp - I wasn't a fan of this dish as it was bland.  It had the least impact in terms of flavor.  

Jerk Spiced chicken - While the flavor was good, the chicken came out a bit dry.  Tear.

Scallops - Good quality scallops.  Can't go wrong here.

Devils food layer cake - Imagine the richest and sweetest chocolate cake of all time. It was nice that the did have the milk ice cream to ""lighten"" the load.  If they eased up on the sugar, I would have enjoyed this dessert much more.

Drinks: I had the Electric Avenue which is pretty much their own version of a manhattan.  While it isn't cheap at $17, it was really good.  Compare this to the Chandelier bar outside the restaurant that serves a sh*tty old fashioned for $17.  It's expensive, but you get more value here.  They also have pitchers of Sangria, but that'll set you back $80.  Did I mention this place isn't cheap?

Service was good and for the most part, the food was tasty.  If you have a large party, this place is great because you can order it ""tapas"" style.  For example, you can add one scallop to the scallop dish.  The waiter/waitress will help you along the way.

Most of us ordered the pasta pesto with shrimp, a flat bread and the mac n cheese. For dessert the s'mores cake and butterscotch pudding. All the food was very tasty, fresh and well made.

Lets be clear, this place is 100% one of my favorites in Vegas. That's why I am so critical. 

First of all, I have zero complaints about food. Chris Santos had created a beautiful menu with a little something for everyone. This place will leave you satisfied and wanting more all at the same time. 

Lighting- I understand they were going for a very noir feel, however, it's like eating in a closet. There's almost no light and it makes the presentation of these wonderful dishes really fall flat. 

As far as the drinks, They need to step it up a notch in order to meet the menu standards. Cocktails were strange selections to pair with the dishes, and wine list was lacking a few that every good list should require. 

The communication between staff, and menu knowledge needs to improve as we had to clarify orders twice.

Yellowtail sashimi. $19. The most amazing Ponzu sauce, I would definitely recommend

Bone marrow on toast. $19. This was my first time having bone marrow and it was delicious, would recommend as well.

grilled cheese dumplings and tomato soup. Around $20, I don't remember the exact price. Would not recommend. While they were tasty, they were just little pieces of fried cheese with some tomato soup.

Emerald gimlet drink. $17. I am obsessed with this drink! Basil basil basil!!!

Burger and fries. $19. Really good, huge slice of feta on the burger and side of BBQ fries that taste like lays BBQ chips.

For me, in particular, since I had three virgin cocktails, Garnet Gimlet (I should have had this over ice), Platinum Peacock (my fave, very refreshing), and Ruby Iced Tea (tart).  Hubby was a bit over-buzzed after The Woodson, Goose IPA, and the Garrison.  

Ranking from Most to Least Favorites:
1. Elote Style Scallops: Scallops were perfectly cooked on top of charred elote.  Delicous!
2. Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème: Just the right amount of richness.  Ooh, a piece of heaven with this dessert.  The ganache at the bottom adds a different texture to this elevated pot de crème.  Came with a spoon shaped thin cookie wafer.  A must order dessert.
3. Hand Cut Steak Tartare: The steak tartare was on top of crispy sticky rice cakes.  This was quite unique and flavorful.
4. East and West Coast Oysters: Ordered the dozen and got to try all fresh raw oysters.  Very satisfying.
5. Roasted Bone Marrow: Spread the marrow on some grilled toast, then topped with coarse salt and shallots marmalade...Yum!
6. Yellowtail Sashimi: Latin spin on this plate.  The sashimi was topped with pickled jalapeno and the ponzu sauce gave it some acidity.  I had to really try hard to taste the fish, but the flavor profile was there.
7. Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumpling: I liked this rendition.  The dumpling was nice and chewy.  
8. Caesar Toast: Exactly that, except there are pieces of crispy chicken skin.  It delivered, yet, I wasn't satisfied.
9. Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche: When I think of Ceviche, I think of lime cured salmon.  This plate was just sweet.  It was missing the acidity that I am accustomed to, as well as salt.  A miss for me.
10. Kygo Cloud 9 S'Mores: WAY TOO RICH!  Need a glass of milk with this.  Overly sweet too.  Bleh!  

I must say that the dishes are pretty pricey for the quantity and quality offered, but I believe guests are paying for the location and ambiance.  Service was fantastic!",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,2,3,4,6Go7tb3mwlvDhBz5g3fjFw

3581853,2016-08-17,9,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"I was prepared to give this restaurant 5 full stars but service quality lacked a little for this fun, finer dining establishment and a $250 bill.

Beauty and Essex initially has you intrigued by it's memorable entrance. You initially think its a store front full of vintage guitars, swanky watches and other pieces of jewelry and art you see through the looking glass but on the left side of the store front is a big blue door. Look for that, it's the restaurants entrance. 

Once inside, your ears are filled with music including Will Smith's sensual serenade ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It."" You immediately know you're in for a good time, who doesn't love a good 90's throwback? We checked in at the host stand for our reservation and were promptly seated. We passed a large bar full of patrons sitting and standing drinking fun colored libations in vintage style glasses, sharing conversations and enjoying their sips. We were seated in the back, which to my conclusion is the nosiest room. Tucked in at a two top table wedged in-between two other two tops and larger parties of 10, 15 and 8 we were seated. I will say I was not happy with this table as I could barely hear my partner and we were talking at an extremely loud level all night. ""I think the salmon looks great"" "" Yeah, the steak looks great."" ""No, I said the food is great."" ""What?"" If you are looking for a romantic table for two or planning on bringing your elderly grandparents, I would suggest another place. This restaurant is for cool kids, food connoisseurs and those of us with excellent hearing.

We were greeted pretty quickly by our server and placed a cocktail order. Once that happened, we waited... and waited... and waited. 

A solid fifteen minutes later our server came back around apologizing, took our food order and then within two minutes quickly brought back those cocktails we had ordered. I have to say, the mixologist knows what they are doing, and I commend their craft. The Woodsman drink tastes like Autumn in a cup, or in comparison a burly man chopping wood maybe. Notes of allspice, muddled pear and Bourbon make this an easy to sip man made cocktail. I also ordered the Garnet Gimlet and despite this being a virgin cocktail it did not disappoint. The muddled strawberry and mint were fresh and the bruleed lemon was a nice garnish. 

The mood seemed to be set for an irritable dining experience after initial delays with our service but then the first of our food arrived, the yellowtail sashimi. You know that experience you have when you take a bite of food and time suddenly slows down and the room becomes quite while you slowly savor a dish? That's what this plate is. An experience. The yellowtail is cut into perfectly thin strips and is as fresh as a fisherman's market can be. Topped with pickled jalapeno that gives you a bit of a crunchy texture and served with an apple ponzu sauce you want to drink. The tartness of the apples plays so well on this sweet delicate fish. This was my favorite dish and for good reason. 

We also ordered the Chile Relleno Empanadas, Grilled Cheese Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Short Rib Mac & Cheese, the dry-aged sirloin and topped our dining experience off with the black bottomed butterscotch pot de creme. 

The grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings is my other choice for favorite dishes. The perfect bite of nostalgia brought together on one spoon. The Sirloin was also delicious, cooked to a perfect medium, fully covered in black peppercorns and served with a clove of roasted garlic. The steak is accompanied with three sauces, the spicy red chimichurri being my favorite. 

Chris Santos and his team take you on a round the world journey at Beauty and Essex and the food here is truly memorable. I would recommend this place for locals and tourists a like, larger parties and smaller friends gatherings but I don't think it's a place to take your grandmother unless she is cooler than you.

Our dinner turned out to be terrible, and the concierge recommended this place for dessert. No joke, we ordered 5 plates of dessert. List in order of my favorite to least favorite. 
 
KYGO Cloud Nine S'mores: Most highly recommended dessert, and I understand why! Tons of flavor and a variety of textures - chocolately, soft, crunchy, gooey. Highly recommend a glass of milk with this! 

Devil's Food Layer Cake: Rich balance of chocolate and vanilla. 

Strawberry Shortcake Bars: Frozen cheesecake covered in fresh strawberries, covered in captain crunch pieces. It was like an adult version of a strawberry shortcake ice cream pop that you got off the ice cream truck! 

NYC Doughnuts: lightly fried covered in cinnamon and sugar. I'm personally not a big donut fan, but my friends loved it! 

Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème: Served with two cookies, and the pudding wasn't overly rich and has a subtle hint of coconut. Highly recommend if you're a butterscotch fan.

Our waiter did a great job and arranged a tasting menu for us since it was our first time here and we couldn't really decide on what we wanted to eat.  He got an idea of what types of food we wanted and also a price range and made it happen.

All the dishes were phenomenal.  We started off with some Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos and Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche.  The food first started off light and then went heavier.
We then got the Caesar Toast.  Next came the french onion soup dumplings.  We then shared the tomahawk ribeye along with sides of broccolini, short rib mac and cheese, cauliflower.  The ribeye steak was amazing.

The restaurant is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo near Jaleo.  The decor is neat, on the outside of the restaurant it's set up like a pawn shop.  At first I was wondering if I was at the right place.  You enter the restaurant through the door on the right of the shop.  The decor inside kind of has a retro chic vibe going on which totally works.  After we were seated for a while, the lights got dimmer.  It was almost like a lounge vibe with the music being louder and the lights being low.  Don't expect to have any conversations with anybody sitting far away.

This place was just awesome!! We went all out and ordered a lot of dishes which you should too be expecting to pay $200+ for a couple to eat and drink. For everything posted (we had 4 drinks total) plus all the food you see, our bill was $277. 

Dishes are well thought out and good portions. Not sure what the theme of the menu though. 

The must have - bone marrow toast. Omg it's like butter!!! 

Their oysters had a unique condiment, instead of the vinegar onion concoction they normally serve with oysters, they serve an onion/vinegar shaved ice. 


This is an awesome place for a date night, with it's slightly hidden entrance, fun vintage shop, and live DJ in the restaurant. 

If you read this far, my only qualm was the hostesses were far from hospitable. I am in the service industry, and it is so aggrevating to have to initiate the interaction. I said ""hello how's it going?!"" To the hostess and she said ""good"".... and just looked at me instead of asking me if she could help me with something.

I understand this place is busy, but when I make a reservation... I don't intend on waiting for 30 minutes to get seated. Once we got seated, it took forever to get anyone's attention. The server took forever to take our orders and the food also took forever to come out. 

I understand that most people come here to have drinks for dinner, but my girls and I were pretty hung over, so we opted out from the drinks. I think the server was pretty annoyed of us for not ordering any alcohol and that is what mainly racks up the bill. So once our food came out, he literally handed us the bill 30 mins after and we weren't even finished eating. 

The bone marrow, Kobe burger and salad were pretty good, but the chicken meatball was pretty gross...

They've been expanding and it seems that means they are sacrificing some of what I used to love.

In November I was back in NY and in March I tried the Vegas one.  Their menu has shrunk and their food is hit or miss.  Some bites I loved, some I didn't.

The Vegas atmosphere is quite hip, fresh and new.  (Vs NYC that is starting to look dated).  So, if you are looking for a scene restaurant with reasonable prices and some good food options - this is a good spot to try.

We all weren't suuuuuper hungry, but the dishes are all small and pretty much like mini portions, so we ordered a bunch of things. The waiter made sure that our dishes came with 6 portions so each of us could have some, which was nice

Maine lobster roll- OMG so good. The bread reminded us of the breadsticks from Olive Garden, but in a good way. The lobster was buttery and melted in my mouth

French onion soup dumplings- We didn't know what to expect, but we knew we had to order them based off other reviews. They come in an escargot-like dish, with the dumplings in its own little round section and the whole thing is covered in melted cheese. Biting into the dumpling, the taste of french onion soup just oozes out and fills your mouth. 

Grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings- These were just ok, in my opinion. Made for an interesting bite

Short rib mac & cheese- I like my mac & cheese to be creamy, and this one wasn't super creamy but the sauce was flavorful. The added shredded short rib was a nice touch 

Roasted brussel sprouts- These were just ok too. Tasted like typical brussel sprouts, not anything particularly special about them

Drinks are slightly overthought here. Even the bevvies on the ""sweet"" side tasted like plants. And I tasted a lot of them. Think hipster mixologist with curled moustache and a tight vest making them. (but in reality it was a hot chick with long, pretty hair and a short dress)

So many food options, and my group tried most of them. 3 out of 6 of us have food allergies, and staff was only semi-attentive to that when bringing dishes to the table. We were constantly asking ""Does this have nuts?""

Most of our selections were decadent and well executed, however a few details went missed here and there like burnt burger buns. The tomato tartare seemed to be a crowd favorite, but the Thai chicken was super bland. A dessert platter came out aiming to please, but the L.E.S. donuts had a choking amount of sugar on them.

Although you are one of the pickiest judges on the show ""Chopped"", after dining at your restaurant, I appreciate your judgement somuch more.....

Why? Well, perhaps because now I understad what your standards are when it comes to  flavor, presentation and creativity, the 3 main components that the Chefs get rated on the show....

The BBQ thai chicken was truly divine...... The chicken was cooked to perfection while marinated in BBQ sauce along with lemongrass & ginger sauce... And to make the dish even more amazing, there was this delicious parsnip puree flavored with coconut cream...... 

The tuna was as amazingly delicious as the chicken, perhaps more....It was seared to perfection, served with delicious yellow & green beans....

As a huge onion ring hater, I got addicted to the onion rings served here..... The batter was not too thick but flavorful.... The onions were seasoned perfectly while being sweet and delicious.....

I would have said, I can't wait to dine here again when I come to Sin City next, but guess what?! They are opening  another B&E location  in DTLA this January!

The food was good and the service was great once we were seated though. As always, the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings were amazing. The real disappointment was the lobster rolls. This is certainly a dish that you can skip. The server even suggested we get an extra one to split the order evenly since they generally come with 3. Needless to say the extra $11 or something crazy was a waste because we didn't even want to eat it. We had to rush through our meal because we were already 45 minutes behind. Call me crazy, but when I drop $200 on a meal I would have liked to savor and enjoy it a bit more. I am not sure what it was, but this location lost a bit of the magic that it had in NYC.

The ambience was very cool- sort of dark with leather chairs, big booths, and tons of art on the walls. It was pretty loud, though. 

The food is tapas-style, and our server recommended ordering 3-5 dishes per person. We had 2.5 for each of us, which was plenty (4 girls), although the portions are by no means overwhelming. We had the Thai shrimp, which was the best dish we ordered. We also had BBQ fries (fries with some BBQ-y dust on them), mushroom flatbread, poke tacos, and 2 of the tomato soup with grilled cheese wontons. They really hype up the grilled cheese/ tomato wontons but you should know that you're just going to get a wonton spoon with a little bit of soup and a cheese ball in it. 

I also had the emerald gimlet, which was very refreshing and basil-y.

The next appetizer that we tried was the deep-fried Thai shrimp which was very tasty. We have three people in our party and it was just enough for everybody to have two pieces. Next came the ravioli and mushroom pizza. The mushroom pizza had lots of caramelized onions and truffle oil which were very delicious. We all really enjoyed the ravioli, the sauce was great. There was definitely an issue with keeping many of the items warm enough at the table. Our ravioli was cold too. I think it would be really helpful if they were serving things on warm plates it would help to keep things hot as they come to the table.
One of the main issues that I had with this restaurant was that the waitress said that everything was shared but in reality only the appetizers are shared. 
There was a problem with the way things were brought out we ordered two entrées and the pizza for an entrée main dishes and unfortunately only two entrées came out together. So one person in our party was left with nothing to eat while the other people were eating their entrées. That was very unfortunate and left everybody feeling a little uncomfortable.  I feel like our server could've done a much better job explaining things and maybe she does not understand that the entrées are not shareable.  
All in all it was a wonderful experience we also had a delicious dessert which was a marscapone cheese filled chocolate cake. 
I highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely be back next time I visit Vegas. I think this is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas even with the flaws. 
I feel like next time I would be better at ordering since I understand how the restaurant works.

First, you enter through a pawn shop. It's a cute concept but really irrelevant to the restaurant experience.

The interior is super dark and very loud. Not a great place for romantic encounters. More for party groups.

The menu is all over the place. You have Italian, Asian, Seafood, Steak, the works. This lack of focus shows in the food, unfortunately.

We ordered the following:

Grilled cheese, bacon and tomato soup dumpling - WTF was this? Not a good mix of flavors at all. We only ordered it because the server went on and on about it.

Short rib mac and cheese - This actually would've been pretty good if I could've found more than 2 pieces of short rib in it.

Spaghettini - What a disaster. The pasta was way overcooked and just drowned in flavorless pesto. We literally took one bite each and left the rest.

Filet mignon - Ordered it medium rare, got it medium to medium well. Since this was the last entree we ordered, we were so over the experience already so decided not to send it back.

Cloud Nine Smores - So so overly sweet. And there was some inexplicable blue streak on the plate as if a smurf had left skid marks on it. So strange. This is the one dish the waiter actually asked how it was and when I told him it was too sweet, they were kind enough to take it off our bill.

Overall, a very disappointing experience and I will never be back.",XXSDiRsswmzNa-J7pMYFfA,4,0,2,Bvqxd-HhUBOe1ac0MCVxhA

I wasn't in a cocktail mood so I had a bourbon and a few beers. Crazy hectic bar service as it was open bar, so hard to judge what the vibe will be like on a normal night.

Date night in full effect. I had made a rsvp. Upon arrival, we checked in with the lovely hostess and were told that our table was not ready if we could wait. She gave me a buzzer. Ok no problem. So we sat down at the lounge area and ordered a drink. It was nice to relax. My drink got there and not even 5 mins the buzzer went off. We were then seated in the main dining room. Checking out the menu, I was kind of disappointed at the fact that some of the items I loved in the NYC menu were not offered here. For example, the short ribs with the hush puppies was no where to be found on the menu. What was on it was the short rib mac and cheese. So I ordered that.

But now that I've been to Beauty & Essex a couple times, I feel like this place is legit.

Hands down, my favorite dish on the menu is actually the garganelli. It's hearty but with just enough kick at the end to make it really interesting. My other must-haves are the tomato soup dumplings and chicken meatballs. The caesar toast is my favorite of the toast offerings but to be honest I like all of them; the wedge salad is also killer but I'd prioritize other, more interesting / different things on the menu first.

And don't forget dessert. The affogato milkshake shot (an affogato with godiva liquer) is one of my top guilty pleasures anywhere - I'll admit I don't usually even wait until dessert to have one.

I don't know why they've taken some of their best offerings off the menu (french onion soup dumplings?) but this is still a place I always look forward to visiting.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,0,0,5,sB2B2SVby-DIUyib5YJvSQ

It tasted like cat food.   Our meatballs were the only thing I was able to eat without leaving me with an awful taste in my mouth.

Dry-aged beef slider: perfect size and very good! A great few bites!

Mexican street corn ravioli: again, delicious but a bit heavy on the cheese (for me).

I would rate this place between 3-4 stars so my 4 stars is being generous.

This location is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The entrance is like NYC's - you enter thru a pawn shop( actually the pawn shop was nicer than NYC) .  There is a bar near the entrance then several dining rooms. It's very dark- too dark in my opinion. Ambiance is very loud and a lot of chit chatter. Eh.

Our waitress was very nice and efficient. 

Drinks-- eh- nothing that me nor my friends loved. I got the Beauty Elixir and it just didn't seem as good here.  One friend had the bubbles  and berries. Forgot what my one friend had. 

Food- its family style. You get several dishes and share which I think is fun and you get to try different things. 

Oven braised Chicken meatball was ok. Thai fried style deep fried shrimp was ok. Pulled chicken arepas ok. 

Short rib mac and cheese yummy
Yellowtail sashimi yummy

Ended it with dessert ... L.E.S. donuts ( lower east side is location of the NYC location) . Yummy warm donuts with 3 sauces to dip- chocolate, caramel and a berry. 

There's a photo booth there that's fun to pose with friends and you can email it to yourself.

The prices are comparable to what you would pay at any other high-quality/fancy place on the Strip.  And if you can get someone else to pay for you then that's even better.

I came here as part of an organized conference dinner, with a set menu.  They have large tables in private rooms, and were able to accommodate a party of ~20.  The menu had 10 dishes to it.  Appetizers included orange kissed salmon ceviche (good, unique citrus from orange, recommend), wedge salad (typical, depends on how you feel about blue cheese), roasted mushroom pizzetta (mushroom flatbread, deep flavor from caramelized onions and goat cheese), and Caesar Toast (caesar salad on toast, like a bruschetta).  The main course dishes were a Grilled Atlantic salmon in a sherry vinegar sauce and Prime Dry-Aged Sirloin (choice of red chimichurri, peppercorn hollandaise, or garlic and bacon sauce, cooked medium with lots of pink inside).  Sides included Char Grilled Green Beans (delicious with the Gochujang glaze and toasted sesame on top), and Vidalia Onion Ring tower (sambal ketchup had a kick from chili peppers).  For dessert I recommend the Les'NYC Doughnuts, with the thick and rich caramel sauce (also have dark chocolate or berry sauces), instead of the Carrot Layer Cake (was good for carrot cake, but is after all a carrot cake).",FJKw-FNduFwowZtrs36Egg,0,0,5,jgFjauFZry6UcDyn5Fpw5g

We ordered the K-town Bao buns, Grilled cheese dumplings, scallops, ravioli, Thai shrimp and chicken meatballs. The grilled cheese dumplings came out kinda cold, the Bao buns were a little strange because it was like hamburger meat with Asian slaw, it threw me off since it was like a fusion between and American burger, but would be better off with pork belly inside. The ravioli was a little too rich for us. The sauce the put on the ravioli was pretty rock and the Mexican corn elote was too dry. The scallops were super salty and over cooked, that we had to return it. The chicken meatballs were too mushy for us. The only thing we really enjoyed were the Thai shrimp, which had a great batter and was deep fried. I enjoyed the papaya salad that came with it as well. 

I really wanted to try some of their other dishes that I saw on yelp, but they change their menu seasonally which is a shame. I also wish they had their butter popcorn ice cream that I loved at their Los Angeles location. 

Having been to the Beauty and Essex in New York and Los Angeles. I had high hopes for this Vegas location.

First off, they changed their menu, so a lot of their delicious mouthwatering pictures you see, are probably gone.

For our group, we shared the tuna tacos, pork chop, avocado toast, Mexican corn ravioli, yellowtail carpaccio, salmon, chicken and ktown bao buns. Out of all of them, I can honestly say the only one that was worth it was the bao buns, at 8 dollars a piece. They had a very good flavor and it all balanced very well. The ravioli was extremely bland, and I loveeeee Mexican corn. I just don't think it tasted good as a pasta dish AT ALL. The avocado toast was decent. The yellowtail carpaccio and tuna tacos were good, but honestly, I'd rather go to Zuma or Morimoto. The salmon was cooked very well. But I didn't like what it came with, which was couscous and mashed potatoes. It took away from what could've been a great salmon bc those two are practically flavorless. I stole the lemon from the pork chops to season the salmon pieces. The pork chop had good flavor, and the meat wasn't tough at all but I wouldn't choose it. The chicken was the same thing. 


And to top it all off, nothing was done for the birthday celebrant, after telling the hostess upon making the reservation. Which only shows how -great- the service is. 


All in all, we didn't even spend that much, but everything we got was not worth it at all. Now I can regretfully scratch it off my must try restaurants in Vegas.",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,1,0,3,-dsyEDyPPM-OhN-xWtpOgw

The meal started off with a few glasses of champagne. Then they served us our favorite vodka mixed drinks. After the drink service, the food started pouring in. The first thing on the menu was a freshly prepared Cobb salad. The salad was loaded with fresh mixed greens and delicious rustic flavors. Once I was done with my salad, they served me a chicken parmesan flatbread. The chicken was crispy and the flatbread was laced with a flavorful tomato sauce. Then came tuna tar tar tacos. The tacos were loaded with a mix of flavors. It was sweet and salty. The soy sauce added a bitter yet salty kick. The crunchy taco shell was glazed with a sweet coating. The meal ended with jumbo glazed shrimp. The shrimp was so fresh and lacked all fishy smell. I do want to mention that the food we selected was super girly and made the girls night out even more girly and sexy than we anticipated. 

The service was fast, professional and intimate. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for great food and great music. 

When I went Timmy trumpet graced us with his music and presence. His musical talent was radiating throughout the whole restaurant. He let off great vibes!

4132126,2017-02-28,2,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Literally one of the most underwhelming meals I have had at any restaurant - ever. Service .5 - food - 1.5 - and that's only because there was an ice cream root beer shot for dessert .. lol. I mean .. from the start - I asked for a different table because we were squeezed into the corner and the hostess gave me the dirtiest look and said ""well what would you prefer then?"". Well what would I prefer then??? Wtf. I would prefer not being spoken to in a rude manner - by a 18 year old in heels, when we are trying to have a nice dinner at a semi pricey restaurant. 

The female server didn't even tell us anything about the menu- ""are you ready to order"" well.. no - we've been sitting here for about 4 minutes. I was looking for some inspiration and suggestion perhaps ...but - nothing. I asked about wine, and was greeted with a blank stare. I resorted to asking our neighboring tables how their meals were and what they suggested. We chose a few things hoping to get something great - but none of it really hit home or worked that well. Just uninspired and basic dishes. I'm not just trying to be a jerk - but it was pretty weak, and the despondent service made it so much worse. 

From that point on, we were repeatedly underwhelmed by the food and we were literally so hungry. Elote corn scallops? - Baja style fish tacos? - the most un flavorful Brussel sprouts ?? What is the direction of the menu meant to be? It was so all-over-the-place. 

We didn't finish one single dish and it was cleared away without question. We just had a couple of martinis and hoped dessert would save the meal. It was helpful- the root beer floats - but didn't make up for how weak the rest of everything else was. 

To make it worse - The server disappeared for nearly half an hour and eventually I had to get up and chase down a guy in a suit with an earpiece - just to get our check. Terrible. I know things happen - but c'mon. The place was packed and we could not get our check so we could just leave. 

This was a fail to say the least. The room was cool and the decor was fun. The 90's inspired music track was a cool vibe - but the service was absolutely terrible and the food was so basic. Seriously. 

No one will read this or care - and the kids that think this is good good will continue to support blandness because they have no idea what good is anymore. At around $100 a head - you would hope for, at least, very good. This was REALLY not  great. 

Let's hope you have a better experience.

We live in Queens, NY and have dined at the Manhattan location, but we had not realized they had opened a Vegas location until just two nights before Valentine's Day when we were waiting for the Bellagio's fountain show and saw their sign on the side of the Cosmopolitan. When we managed to snag a 10PM reservation on OpenTable, we canceled our booking at Gordon Ramsay Steak, and-- though I do not know what we might have missed out on at Gordon Ramsay Steak-- I am not sorry we decided to spend our evening at Beauty & Essex. 

The Drinks: I ordered the Oaxacan Old Fashioned (Mmm... think smoky mezcal and citrus) and my husband had the Woodsman (Also very good... think deep bourbon with well-balanced maple and citrus notes). 

The Food: Between the two of us we shared 4 Maine lobster rolls-- fresh lobster salad served on impressive little ""rolls"" made of crispy corn dog batter; 6 grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings-- savory, smoky, grilled cheese dumplings nested over a rich tomato puree; and 4 chile relleno empanadas-- crisp, fluffy pockets stuffed with a smooth cheese and a mild to medium poblano sauce. 

The Service: All staff, ranging from the doorman and the hostess to the servers and bussers were friendly and welcoming. Despite the restaurant's exclusive appeal (its pawn shop facade, speakeasy vibe, and dramatically intimate decor) the staff was very friendly and welcoming and before we left we had a wonderful chat with one of the waitresses [her name escapes me-- grr!] who recommended we visit Santos' sister restaurant, ""Vandal"" when we returned to New York.

I'de wanted to try this place in New York but didn't get a chance to so when I saw it opened in Vegas I asked my parents if we could try it. I called in to make a reservation and they were fully booked but told me that I could just come in and wait for a table. When we got there the girl at the front told us they had no available tables and no waiting list. My mother being the intimidating arab women she is somehow convinced them that they had to put us on the list and somehow we were put on it with only a 30 minute wait. 

When we came back my mom was carrying friendly conversation with the hostess who was this pretty tall girl who was a complete b**** and was being so condescending to my mom and thank god my mom was tipsy cuz she didn't realize how rude the girl was being. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing, such a beautiful restaurant. Seriously every detail was so beautiful and unique. I liked the music but it was so loud we literally had to yell our order to the waitress. 

We ordered the paprika spiced salmon, the yellow tail, the cauliflower, and the spaghettini. 

So we waited almost an hour and then the waitress realized that she forgot to Put in our order. I don't understand how this happens but she had to retake our order and reenter it. 

So after waiting even longer we get our food and all I can say is I was underwhelmed. My my parents liked the spaghatinni, I thought it was super average. The yellow tail was such a small portion, and the spiced paprika salmon was HORRIBLE. It was dry burnt and I couldn't even finish one piece. So at this point I probably would have rated the restaurant a one or 2 but they decided to bring us out some comped desserts and this was the redeeming factor. 

They brought us the les Nyc dougnuts, the kygo cloud nine smores, and the strawberry cheesecake bars. 

The kygo smores weren't great, I took like one bite

BUT THE LES DOUGHNUTS AND THE STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE WERE SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD.

Seriously some of the best dessert I've ever had, especially the strawberry cheesecake bars. Omg so amazing. Thank God they brought those out because if it weren't for those and our reealllly nice bus boy, and the decorations, I would have never come back.",BpgQ_KJgEQOT4VWRfbjpOQ,2,2,3,44kOLQ4UwXwdZWtTjrJRNw
4280903,2017-02-11,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Well, if you read the other Yelp reviews you would think this place is really great. Not so much. We got a res at 6:30 because we drove in late from CA. The four of us sat down for a relaxing meal and to chill on a Friday night. It was not to be.

The cute and well groomed server waited on us in a timely manner but from the outset we got the ""bums rush"". Not within 5 minutes we were asked if we were ready to order, really? Come on, this is not a cheap dinner. You expect a different level of service. The server also had not mastered the art of peripheral vision necessary to be an excellent server. When one of your customers is waiving to get your attention, you should immediately respond rather than whisk by the table without a glance.

I do agree that the pawn shop entry is novel and kind of fun but the rest of the interior architecture was disappointing. The decor was not the problem but rather the open floor plan that resulted in an extreme level of noise such that you could barely hear each other at a table of four. Unacceptable! You are about to drop $100 a head, you should be able to enjoy your meal.

Now, the important aspect of any review, the food. WTF, the menu read better than the food tasted. While I applaud the small plates concept, it creates a great deal of pressure on the chef to produce distinctive vibrant tastes within the small portion offered. This they did not accomplish. If you have been to Spain, Joel Robuchon or any of the similar high quality small plate outstanding chefs, you know exactly what I mean.

The tomato soup and grilled cheese spoon offering is a good example. Great idea, poor execution. The tastes were muddled and largely unremarkable. The fire roasted corn and scallops also were a good menu idea but again nothing remarkable. Each separate ingredient was good but nothing to bind them together. The salmon dish was overcooked, an inexcusable tragedy for any fish but especially salmon. The sauce with the fish nothing to add any distinctive taste but a useless addition. The brussels 
Sprouts were well prepared and perhaps the tastiest thing about the meal. Companion ordered the beef filet a poivre that was well constructed but essentially tasteless. What a shame to waste a descent piece of beef. And finally, the dessert. Tried the $6 root beer float, 2 oz of root beer and ice cream float-maybe a little too small even for a small plate restaurant.

I would not return to this restaurant and cannot in any context recommend it. They I am sure will do fine because it is Vegas. However, there are too many other good choices in the new culinary capital that Vegas has become.",dO6ets3jRzQEiJOas2IOGg,2,0,2,GeSI32XeOb6Z3JTVNt8yfg

4282636,2018-04-22,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"A super cute place!  I love the theme and ambiance going on at this hip, little place.  

You enter through a pawn shop, where everything is 70% off according to the hostesses (at least that's what I think she said) and there's a side door that leads to the entrance of the restaurant.  It's pretty dark in there but the place is very plush and romantic - lots of velvet couches, crystal chandeliers and peacock feathers everywhere.  I love peacocks!

I enjoyed the Beauty Elixir cocktail to start.  I was hoping to was an actual elixir that would beautify me but it was just gin, strawberries and sparking rose, garnished with a cucumber.  It was delicious and refreshing.

I ordered the Garganelli pasta with a lamb bologenese.  When it arrived, it came in a pretty little bowl with Parmesan and red pepper chili flakes  poured out on the side.  Cute presentation.  The entree itself was pretty good but I wasn't blown out of the water by it.  I definitely think it was a bit overpriced and I probably could've gotten a bigger portion size.

I finished with the Peanut Butter Sundae.  A fun dessert presented in an old fashion sundae bowl, topped with loads of chocolate syrup, whipped cream and mini pretzels.  I liked the peanut butter ice cream; I could have done without all the other stuff added on top for looks.

Overall, it was a great place.  Nice ambiance but very crowded and a bit pricey.",PNL42A7gZFDFG1ShSSfYxw,0,0,4,szhKnV-bvqBHaPNdiS903A
4286008,2016-09-30,1,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Beauty & Essex is a great example of a restaurant that oozes in style and although I personally need to come back and explore more of the menu to make a final call, the first impression is absolutely terrific.  

The restaurant is located on the third floor near the restaurant village.  You'll walk through the speakeasy-like doors of the storefront before heading into a really slick and dark restaurant.  Service is absolutely on its A-Game here with lots of help and all the servers being super attentive.  Lots of people too seem to pre-game here and celebrate birthdays too in case you're wondering the crowd you'll see as well (at least on a Friday night).  You can definitely come in here however you'd like but on a weekend night, people were definitely dressed up.  We did see a young guy pretty drunk that was dancing around for a while surprisingly.  

Let's get to the food.  You'll most likely notice two things - one is the numerous amounts of food options here - many with special little twists.  The second thing you'll notice is the price.  Even for a tapas restaurant, it's not super cheap and the food portions you get will be pretty small.  Be aware (and don't be that surprised - you're in the heart of the Vegas strip).  But the food itself is all fascinating and some fantastic.  For instance, the tomato soup dumplings which is a mix of grilled cheese and bacon - an absolutely FANTASTIC combination and really explodes in your mouth.  You only get a few pieces so you may have to order more.  

We also had the root beer float shots (which has some alcohol mixed in) which was small but super tasty.  The drinks here by the way were super strong otherwise.  Had an old fashioned made with tequila and was surprised by how mighty strong it was.  Just a fair warning.  

Beauty & Essex is a cool cat and fits in nicely at the Cosmo.  Expect to pay a bit extra for smaller dishes but come out feeling like you had a fascinating little experience.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,1,4,x7fq_sDlhps5-87a-w7b8w
4289577,2016-08-15,2,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"On the first night of our recent stay at the Cosmopolitan, we were wandering around reading the menus of the new restaurants.  Beauty & Essex's menu intrigued me but it was the description of the ""Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup dumplings"" that was on my mind for days.  

On the afternoon of our last day, I could no longer resist and booked a last minute reservation.  

The front of the restaurant is a small pawn shop with a security guard outside.  Don't be offput by the guard.  This isn't a club nor is it overly snobby.  The inside of the restaurant is dark but decorated in a way that makes it more clubby than dismal.  What you would expect for Vegas.

Our reservation time was pretty early because of being booked at the last minute.  There were a good number of tables already in the full swing of dinner.  I was glad that they didn't seat us right next to anyone.  In fact, I noticed that they carefully seated people so that they had as much privacy as is possible.  I truly appreciate that at a time when many restaurants seem to seat tables for the comfort of the servers and not the customers.

We were promptly greeted by Roszettie, our server.  She was super knowledgeable of the menu and offered to make all of the dishes served as even numbers because there were just two of us.  Given our varying tastes, we declined, but it was an offer that you don't get everywhere.

I ordered the Emerald Gimlet "" Absolut 'Elyx' Vodka, Basil, Lemon Nectar, Fresh Lime"".  It didn't disappoint.  The fresh smell of the drink was almost as enticing as the flavor.  It was also a great palate cleanser.  

We had four of the dishes.

1.  The Tuna Poke Tacos - both of our favorites.  A small crispy taco shell with tuna poke, soy, radishes, etc.  The flavor, crunch, heat, etc. was perfectly balanced.  

2.  The Lobster roll - My husband's second favorite and my least favorite (of the four, it was still excellent).  The roll is either made in house or they are delivered daily because they couldn't have been fresher.  The roll had a sweetness that enhanced the lobster salad.  

3.  The Bone Marrow - I am a lover of bone marrow.  One very large bones split lengthwise into two pieces.  As a note to Chris Santos, the celebrity Chopped judge who lends his name to this restaurant, the marmalade and salad didn't really seem to have a purpose and could have been left off the plate.  All this dish needs is the marrow and the crispy, fresh, buttered bread chunks.

4.  The Tomato Soup Dumpling - while good they were a little misleading.  The soup is not in the dumpling (one of the reasons I ordered it was to see how they got it in there without it getting soggy).  It was a small, crispy, bacon & cheese dumpling resting in a spoon of tomato soup.  The soup was excellent without being overly acidic.  It was a perfect complement to the dumpling.

I can not say enough good things about Roszettie and the rest of the employees.  They were professional and courteous and each item came out as we finished the prior one.  

I did have to chuckle at the self promotion postcard regarding Chopped and Food Network that arrived with the check.  It was unnecessary and cheapened the overall feel of the restaurant and the meal somehow.

My biggest regret is that we didn't eat here sooner because it wouldn't have been the only time during this trip.  Hopefully it will survive the grind that is the Vegas restaurant industry and will be here for our next trip.",9lhZd8oHmdpHI-narT6pOA,2,0,5,_kLDJ029SnpN11gS6qFbYw

We had a party of 11 and I was the only one with dietary limitations (of course).

Our drinks were never empty and the food came out at the perfect pace so that we were neither rushing nor waiting for our next course.

The mains (we ordered the lamb chops, the sirloin, and the pulled pork) were also great. Of course, expect it to be on the pricier side, but it is Las Vegas, and it is the Cosmopolitan hotel.

The drinks were decent - classic martini, bubbles & berries, a mezcal drink, and red wine, but not out of this world.

We had asked our server to please parcel out the dishes if he could, and they ended up coming out all at once. He also asked us about dietary restrictions four times, where it become the running joke of our table.

It was really cool and fun to walk through the pawn shop into the restaurant. I loved seeing all the guitars on the wall.

Based on reviews, I started with the Tuna poke wonton tacos. I loved the presentation of the three tacos in a mini metal toast rack. The Tuna was fresh, spicy and flavorful and the tacos were crispy and crunchy. Simply divine!!

Based on the fabulous waitresses recommendation, I had the Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. This dish blew my mind!! Creative and inventive cuisine that's artfully executed and presented. You get six dumplings served on individual lacquer Chinese spoons. The dumplings were delicious and bursting with flavor. I'd go back for this dish alone it was so good.

Next, I had the Cauliflower which was cooked and presented in a small stone or metal dish that kept the cauliflower warm. The vegetable was cooked in ginger salsa verde with pickled scallions and had the most unique and amazing flavor of any vegetable dish I'd ever had.

Sadly, I ate too much for lunch and was starting to feel full. I was desperate to try the Thai style deep fried shrimp or the Short rib mac and cheese which were both highly recommended and sounded delicious. Instead, I opted to splurge calorie wise and get the KYGO Cloud Nine ""S"" smores. I loved the creative presentation as the dish was topped with a giant marshmallow cloud. I found the marshmallow overly sweet and it overpowered the flavor of the dark chocolate torte below. 

The restaurant has a large, inventive cocktail list broken out into sweet and savory categories. There is an extensive wine list and about 4-5 wines by the glass in each category: sparking, white and red. I had several glasses of the Tempranillo. Prices ranged from $11-16 for most, which is really good value for Vegas where there are so many $18+ glasses.

Amazing atmosphere and service!! Best meal of the entire trip. I will be back in Las Vegas in January and this will be my #1 restaurant choice and I'm already dreaming of trying the Roasted bone marrow toast and Oven braised chicken meatballs and savoring every bite of the big wow grilled cheese dumplings.

Yes I am gluten free and lactose intolerant, so the waitress if it's a good one should ask any restrictions before suggesting five menu items with dairy and meat. Wasn't even listening.

The drinks were mediocre at best. I got an aperol spritz that wasn't very sparkly and watered down.

I enjoyed the apps but when it came to the rest of the meal, Including this dish the waitress highly recommended I wasn't appeased. I was actually hungry after too, and got a treat at another hotel.

We shared 3 things. The grilled cheese bites, the onion rings, and the burger with fries. Everything was so tasty. Service and staff were great.

Grilled cheese and tomato bisque: Must try, very unique. 

Meatballs: Very good but also very buttery. Kind've a heavier dish so just beware.

Yellowtail sashimi: I usually prefer albacore but wow def try this if you like sushi.

Albacore sashimi: Albacore is favorite fish, theirs is good but I've had significantly better.

Lamb chops: AMAZING. Ask for them cut into 4 pieces, instead of the two they come in. The lamb chops are a must try.

Bone marrow: I'm a huge fan of bone marrow but I must say the bones they use here are rather thin with not much in them. I would recommend ordering something else.

The place has a cool concept of a pawn shop and a restaurant hidden behind it. The service was a miss and although they have a separate vegan and a gluten free menu, the plates just lacked finesse. The description on the brussel sprouts sounded amazing without the bacon but what I got was plain Brussels with salt and pepper to make it vegan which is not what i was expecting. This is after they brought out the dish with bacon first after telling them I'm vegan. My husband ordered onion soup meat balls which were hard and nasty and the cheese around it was wayyyyy too much. The chicken meatballs came with cold cheese and looked too mushy. Empanadas were good and the slider was decent. 

Def order the BBQ fries as it was the only good thing on the menu for those who are vegan and gluten free. The sweet and savory fries were fried to perfection and paired with some spicy ketchup, this dish alone would make me come back ten more times but only for the fries. The tofu dish I ordered for my main meal was $30 and came with three tiny grilled pieces of tofu which were seasoned with salt and pepper and not much more. The parsnip purée was delicious but the entire dish was boring compared to many other places in the same casino.

Located in the third-floor restaurant zone of the Cosmo, I was impressed by B&E before I even reached the host stand.  As you enter, you pass through a beautiful ""pawn shop"" selling jewelry, guitars, and (perhaps most importantly) copies of Chris Santos' cookbook.

The vibe changes entirely once you enter the restaurant proper, which is covered in stands of pearls and sumptuous decor.  My guest and I opted for seats at the lively bar.  Before long, the bartendress took our dinner orders, and I had a delicious glass of Malbec in hand.

B&E specializes in small plates, which are meant for sharing.  Three plates were just the right amount of food for a dinner for two:

1) Short rib mac and cheese.  Probably the best mac and cheese plates I've ever had.  The cheese was gooey and delicious -- but not heavy.  The short rib was tender and shone through nicely.  The jalapeno cornbread crust provided the perfect crunch.

2) Ratatouille with zucchini, yellow squash, tomato, and piperade.  The perfect accompaniment to the mac and cheese.  The dish was stunning to look at, and the flavor was excellent too, with a nice spicy kick from the piperade.

3) Kygo ""cloud nine"" s'mores with dark chocolate torte, pecan graham crumble, marshmallow clouds, and chocolate sauce.  One of the most fabulous, indulgent desserts I've ever seen.  It's a veritable mountain of delicious chocolate, swimming in marshmallow goodness.  The behemoth portion size was an added bonus.

Throughout our dinner, service was friendly and prompt.  Also friendly were the other patrons at the bar.  Everyone at B&E seems to be there for good food, good times, and minimum pretensions.  That's like my kind of place.

Bravo, Chris Santos -- B&E is exactly what the Vegas dining scene needed.  I can't wait to pay your restaurant another visit.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,9,5,5,4PQCm3fqBeQAvCk1uQDr3g

Since it was considered an upscale restaurant, I figured the server would at least do something for my cousin ESPECIALLY because we told her we were here for her birthday and she encouraged it. 
Overall experience, food is 3/5 and the server was pretty nice. Environment, I would have preferred it with a little more light.",M4tyqwsqBRXKAasRrFAD7w,2,1,3,AYHKsqJ5IbIlKH3DHOX1NQ

4694456,2017-12-11,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"4 of us stayed at Cosmo and we wanted to try a new place.  I booked a few days in advance and was easily able to get reservations on a Friday night at 8:30pm.  We arrived early and had a short wait.  Place was pretty packed and happening.
Ambiance:  Kinda of a cool vibe to have to walk through a ""secret"" door to get to the restaurant.  Place is dimly lit and had a nice vibe to it.  Kinda hard to explain.  Music and ambient noise wasn't too loud. Great place for  small or large dinner.  Restrooms were really clean.
Service:  Pretty great throughout.  We had servers just bring out food and she did a great job of picking out dishes that highlighted the menu.  This was the first time we had made that type of request and we weren't disappointed.  Water was constantly being refilled.
Food:  Tapas (small plate) style so we got to try a lot of items.  Bone marrow was really good.  I could eat that all day.  I really liked their take on the grilled cheese with the smoked bacon.  It was a bite sized portion and I was planning on ordering another one.  But then the other items came out...The Bao burgers were also pretty good.  I have had similar ones elsewhere so it didn't really stand out.  The chorizo mac n' cheese was amazing.  Blend of creamy yet savory.  The chicken meatballs were interesting.  I have never had chicken meatballs.  But it worked.  I would order that again. However, our favorite was the deep fried Thai style shrimp.  IT was lightly battered, yet perfectly fried.  I have never had such a well cooked shrimp.  It was paired really nicely with a thai sauce.  We loved it so much we had to order a second one.  The most disappointing dish was the Filet.  NOthing special.  I would have rather had more of the small plates.

You enter the restaurant by first going through a really high-end jewelry store, it then gets dark and intimate inside the dining areas; I really enjoyed the lighting, chandeliers and complimentary champagne while you await your table.  

The food is good, like really high-end tapas; however they ask you to order everything at one time for the whole table. We were there on a Friday night, for a friend's birthday- we were literally yelling to talk to each other and our server. 
Our bill was around $600 w/o tip, not awful for 6 of us but 1 is vegan/no drinks and two hardly ate. 
The dinner is a longer process because the tapas come out at different times (they are shareable, we had a lot of food at the table and some left-overs.

THE ISSUE: There was a restaurant host who had mentioned (several times throughout our dinner) getting us a comp. table at Marquee Night Club. When the club host FINALLY shows up and asks how he can help, my friend says ""well it's my friend's birthday and we were told maybe we could get a table"", he literally says ""I don't give a fuck""!! I am not sure why he said it, maybe he was intimidated and/or joking..Either way totally inappropriate to say to any ladies and my friend went off, a glass was broken and I called the restaurant manager over to diffuse the situation.   

I don't want to blame B&E for the entire situation going south, the restaurant is neat..maybe I am just getting to old for all the hype of a club-style dinner.",P7Qt34VblZupUifRJ_5hbA,3,1,3,CWZOXB4Xc4weRdPbvdI9lA

Our reservation was set for 10:45 pm, just 15 minutes before the kitchen was scheduled to close. The server was incredibly accommodating and we didn't feel rushed at all. Despite the lateness of the reservation, everything came out as desired and well-prepared.

We started things off with a series of cocktails. Mine was the Oaxacan Old Fashioned, which was a super tasty spinoff of a classic. The chocolate flavor was evident and the tequila/mezcal combo made for a surprisingly smooth sip.

Apps included the burrata toast and roasted bone marrow. We are obsessed with both burrata and bone marrow, and these flavored didn't disappoint. Only wish that some of the bones had a bit more marrow in them. Otherwise they were excellent!

I ordered the lamb, but snuck a few bites of the filet as well. I absolutely adored the lamb, and how well it paired with the polenta and accompanying sauce. The filet was also well prepared, both at medium and medium well (tried a bite of both!). It was actually surprising tender when prepared medium well, which usually isn't the case.

And of course, it's worth noting that the ambiance is a 10/10. The pawn shop in the front makes it feel like you've walked into the Vegas equivalent of a speakeasy. Love it!",zTCh4kFrppZbNtfjEZIxNQ,0,0,5,ZcwDRxk1iHjen-LJFT9QdQ

It appears to be a jewelry store but upon closer inspection glancing at the writing on the walls we found out that this is a bar and restaurant establishment.

When you come up on the establishment their is a round section that looks like a little Lounge area with ladies at a jewelry counter which in fact is the waiting area for the restaurant.

Ladies enjoy a glass of complimentary Prosecco!

The menu prices are better than most of the places in the Cosmopolitan! 

These tapas like type of dishes are paired for two people to eat from so all you need are really two or three dishes.

The selection of adult beverages are phenomenal. 

I had a VIP tour from Alec. He showed me around and showed me the Vault where there is a pricey looking (faux) necklace and room filled with mirrors.

Their is an exclusive provate room w 2 Crystal Swarovski UFO chandeliers where celebrities host dinner parties like Kevin Hart, Kardashian's, award show after functions, etc!

On Monday Knights, Alec mentioned to me it is called lingerie night starting at 9:30 p.m.  

The Tao Group has various models that walkthrough the dining area along with secret agent (trench coated tall supermodels who model jewelry lingerie).  

I had to return the car to the airport and catch my flight so I was unable to stay for another hour and a half to catch the show.

There were 6 tables of (10 men) each who filled up the dining area!!  I don't think they wanted to buy any jewelry nor lingerie to take back home to their wives or fiance's!

The pawn shop entry is a nice touch but I would have liked to have seen a bit of a challenge to gain entry. Something like find the Moonstone broach and it has the password written on the price tag. 

When you enter the place is dark and elegant. Definitely hits that speakeasy vibe. We had a drink at the bar before being seated. It was comfortable and prompt even for a busy night. I had the Emerald Gimlet which was herbal and refreshing. 

We were seated in a mafia booth in the back of the dining room. We couldn't have asked for a better spot. It was private while being completely in the energetic vibe of the place. Our waiter was the bomb! He walked us through the menu and made some fantastic suggestions. 

We started with the Yellowtail. A mainstay dish but their take was unique and delicious. The fish was fresh and perfect. The pickled jalapeño was a nice departure.  Next up was the tuna poke tacos. They sounded tasty but I had seen similar items at many other restaurants, so I wasn't expecting to be blown away. I was so wrong. They masterfully captured the essence of the Poke bowl and transfigured it into a Taco. It was bright and crisp and flavorful. It lit up my entire mouth. We next went for the Bao burgers at the recommendation of our server. They weren't on my radar, but he sold me. Wow! So different from the tacos but another knock out. Savory and decadent and simply dripping with umami complexity. The gochugang sauce and slaw were perfect contrasts to the heavy flavors. They rounded out the flavor rollercoaster delightfully. The fried bun was ridiculous. I think it is probably illegal outside of Vegas. Next up was the Chile Relleno Empanadas. I am a huge fan of both those dishes so I was excited to try them. Dear God in Heaven!!! I wanted to order 17 more plates of these and bathe in their glory. They were everything I wanted that combination to be and then some. Things were well into stride and we selected the Mexican Street Corn Ravioli. They absolutely could not have packed any more flavor into this dish. The roasted poblano creama was unbelievable. We licked this plate clean. For dessert we had the Black Bottom Butterscotch Pot du Creme. It was decadent. The deep chocolate balancing out the sweet. Then came the worst part of the evening. We were too full to order anything else. We very sadly had to part with the rest of the menu untasted.

To finish off the meal, we had these delightful alcoholic dessert shots which I also thoroughly recommend.

The previous month I was at the New York location and figured I'd visit the one in vegas. I'm so glad I did!! The menu styles are the same, plates are
Made to share and a few larger selections. The menus are completely different! The choices and offerings don't have anything in commons besides the BBQ fries. 
We ordered the following....
Tuna tacos, kale salad, cod tacos, seared scallops, French onion soup, and broccoli. 
Wow. Was everything amazing or what! It's impossible for me to pick which was the BEST because they all melt in your mouth. 
The only dish we sent back was the broccoli, they were over salted and it was impossible to eat. 
The French onion soup was so interesting. They are little bread balls with grilled onion soaked in French onion broth. When you bite in, you get the full effect of it.

The empanadas were tiny and tasted like they came out of a cardboard box. Absolutely no flavor. Couldn't taste the poblano and the jalapeño cream was bland. For $14 this is unacceptable. 

The arepas were a poor attempt at Colombian food. They are so small and they come out cold. Which to me seems like an ""easy"" way to get avoid actually spending time on creating this dish. Pretty sure the manchego cheese wasn't even on them and the jalapeño salsa was again, non existent. 

I felt like I totally got ripped off considering how poorly put together these dishes were for the price that we paid. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the Mac and cheese was decent. 

Overall, I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want to visit a lounge with expensive drinks. I'll give them that- very nicely decorated and a cool concept- (behind a ""pawn shop"") But if you do come here save yourself some money and don't eat.

So we sat in the lounge waiting for the pager to vibrate. After 20 minutes, one of my friends asked about the status of our table. The man at the front desk told my friend that it was still not ready, but gave us a card for a comp'd round of drinks for the table. That made the wait not a problem at all! I had the Emerald Gimlet and it was delicious! It's like drinking a refreshing green juice, and then next thing you know, you're tipsy! After the first one, we kept ordering it with added jalapeños...omg...spicy, sassy, and refreshing!

When we were sat at our table, the one problem we did have was the noise level. I don't know if it's the way the room was built or if the people dining that night were just extra loud, but it was LOUD. It was difficult to hear each other at our own table over the surrounding conversations. 

Our server told us that for a group of our size, she would normally recommend about 8-10 dishes to share. We chuckled a little at this thought because we already knew we were going to surpass that number. I kid you not; we ordered just about one of every item except the oysters. My absolute favorites were the avocado toast, mushroom pizza, and Mexican corn ravioli! Everything we ordered was full of flavor and an array of textures.

To end our meal, we discreetly ordered a huge dessert platter for our friend's birthday. Our server put the candles we bought on the platter, and brought the beautiful presentation out singing.

Everything else was fun and interesting but nothing was standout. From best to worst:

=======Recommend=======
* Tomahawk - $125 and not as big as you'd think but exceptionally delicious (surprising from a tapas place!). Didn't even need to use any of the sauces it came with.
* Short rib mac n cheese: Definitely worth getting, perfectly creamy, cheesy and meaty.
* Butterscotch Pot de creme: Solid! Super creamy, luscious creamy whipped cream perfectly balanced with the butterscotch parts. I ate the whole thing by myself
* Scallops: Loved these perfectly seared, perfectly seasoned scallops sitting on a bed of delicious charred corn. Could've eaten 3 on my own. 
=======Good=======
* Grilled Cheese Dumplings: Interesting! Basically a cheese-tomato sauce concoction in a spoon. Recommend ordering for the table.
* French onion soup dumplings: Not delicate like a XLB nor did it really taste like a dumpling, but fun to share. I love french onion and saw the resemblance. Not super impressed but though it was interesting.
* Cauliflower: Standard but tasty side dish
* Chicken Meatballs: A little too mushy for me. Nice truffle flavor though.
=======Pass=======
* Pulled Chicken Arepas: I'm hard to impress when it comes to arepas, and the flavors just didn't do it for me. Kind of blah tasting. 
* Avocado Toast: Generous avocado, too much bread. 
* Strawberry shortcake cheesecake bars: Cool concept, and I love strawberry but I just didn't like this cheesecake because the cheesecake bar was too hard yet not soft enough. Didn't enjoy the cheesescake flavor and I also don't like cap n crunch.
=======Do Not Order=======
* Caesar Salad Toast: Love caesar, love toast, didn't love this. Too creamy and not as crunchy as I'd expect.
* Chile Relleno Empanadas: 4 tiny empanadas. Tasted kind of healthy and not in a good way.
* Garganelli: I love the concept of this dish but it tasted atrocious. Like worse than Lean Cuisine.",5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ,6,7,4,Xa1LaKdc0hCI6NkvNEAazQ

The entrance and decor is very chic ! You enter through a pawn shop, and then there is a hidden door. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. Our drinks came out promptly, but i wasn't a fan of the drinks either. My husband ordered two old fashions and i had a bubbly berry and another lemony drink. Both were too sweet for my liking. 

Now onto our dishes! Our first course was the tuna wonton tacos and yellowtail sashimi. They were both delicious and refreshing. Specially the sauce that came with the yellowtail sashimi. So we started off good. Second course, was some Mexican arepas style mini bites and a street corn style ravioli. Being Mexican myself, it was not what i was expecting but the ravioli actually tasted pretty accurate. But we were already feeling full, bc the ravioli was super fulfilling. Our third course was pork (pastor style) medium cooked. This is where it got bad for us. The flavors were good, and tasted very similar to pastor meet from a taco stand in Los Angeles, but the problem was that we don't eat pork ! I know the waiter asked if we had any restrictions, and we said no but that's because we are not used to eating pork. He noticed we didn't like it and was very nice and offered to take it off our check, and brought something else, he brought chicken lettuce wraps. They were good and refreshing. Along with the lettuce wraps, were some green beans that were delicious! I couldn't stop eating them. Our forth and final course was dessert!  We got the milkshake shots and a carrot cake a salted caramel ice cream. I absolutely loved the the dessert!! 

I am still debating whether i should go back to the one in LA and give it another chance. My hubby says he would go back, so maybe we will and we will be the ones to choose our dishes!",OOz7cLYEbbQKf-Huxhi0vA,1,0,3,CB-tcl05CDI5MSlb3uWuIg

Approaching the main entrance it would appear you are walking into a pawn shop as there are an assortment of guitars and other un-related trinkets that are actually for sale.  We were then directed to the entrance of the restaurant as we had advised the person in the front we had reservations to dine. The initial appearance brought me to a speak-easy style establishment in NYC.  The overall decor and detail of the surroundings definitely made it a great place to have an intimate dining experience with a loved one and or friends.

The wait staff was so cordial and courteous.  We had the pleasure of dining with Kaitlin who was extremely attentive, as well as the rest of the staff who worked together as a team to ensure we had a positive experience.  

For drinks I had their emerald gimlet which was delicious.  I then had to try their oaxacan old fashioned as I have never had one containing mezcal - wow!  My girlfriend had the bubbles and berries which she really enjoyed as well.

We also tried several appetizers, all unique in their presentation and flavor - my favorite being the pulled chicken arepas.  We also really enjoyed the tuna tacos as well as the the grilled cheese and bacon tomato soup dumplings which were surprisingly tasty.  We also had an order of the empanadas which were my least favorite of the bunch.

5022873,2016-11-04,5,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"The wife and I continued to ""unlock our Monday"" at Beauty & Essex for dinner.  We had reservations for 9PM.  The place was jammed, literally and figuratively, when we got there.  Although I haven't been to the NYC original, Beauty & Essex's dining room, unsurprisingly, reminded me of a lot of some NYC restaurants where space is at a premium and tables and diners are squeezed into close quarters.  The noise level of the dining room was tinnitus inducing with thumping club music and a full house of diners practically screaming at each other trying to be heard over the unnecessarily loud music in a room with hard floors and walls unadorned with anything that could be considered sound dampening.  They only sound absorbing materials in the house were basically the diners and service staff.  I'm not too old that I can't or don't appreciate loud music and energetic crowds, but Beauty & Essex seemed to amp it up to an almost intolerable volume.  Not surprisingly, the combination of close quarters and cacophony resulted in service slips.  I noticed multiple cases where food runners delivered dishes to incorrect tables.  In fact, one of our dishes was delivered to a party two tables down from us.

We were more in need of food than more drinks, so we passed on selections from Beauty & Essex's appealing list of cocktails.  For our food, we shared orders of the Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche ($15), Roasted Bone Marrow ($19), and Garganelli ($22).  The Roasted Bone Marrow was a nicely sized portion of two big marrow-filled bones, which came with grilled bread and a rioja braised shallot marmalade as an accompaniment.  It was simple in its presentation, perfectly executed, and delicious.  On the other hand, the other two dishes were failures in presentation and/or execution.  The ceviche tasted all right with bright mango notes complementing the fresh salmon, but it was lacking in execution and presentation.  The knife work on the salmon appeared sloppy.  If you eat first with your eyes, then it was difficult to differentiate between what was salmon and what was mango in the dimly lit room based on sight.  Exacerbating the issues with the dish was that the salmon was drowned in its ""cooking"" liquid and spooned into what amounted to be three Tostito Scoops, which became soggy, losing any hint of crispness.  Perhaps this dish needed to be eaten immediately upon being served.  However, this was the item that had been delivered to the wrong table.  The Garganelli, topped with a sweet & spicy lamb Bolognese and whipped ricotta, while edible, was not enjoyable.  The pasta was overcooked and didn't taste much, if any, better than overcooked, store bought, dried pasta.  The Bolognese was all sweet and little spice, unless you equate saltiness to spiciness, so much so we had to ask our server what was the sweet component in the dish.  It was a balsamic glaze.  Nevertheless, the sauce had a cloyingly sweet component that overpowered everything else save for salt.  It wasn't good.  We left our Garganelli unfinished after only our initial of bites.  We probably should've sent it back, but didn't because we'd had enough.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  Maybe we caught them on an off night.

In no way am I the person who enjoys bashing establishments but felt the need to let folks know of this experience. The few good things are their waitstaff and the food  (THE VERY LITTLE WE RECEIVED). I had a party of 13 men for my brothers bachelor party and they had us do a ""fixed"" menu for $85 each. Needless to say we each had the following....

1) 1/2 inch taco
2) piece of bread
3) spoon of tomato soup
4) 1 shrimp
5) 3oz of pasta
6) 2 small slices of fillet
7) fries
8) a doughnut ball

Now, remember this is for each of us. We are probably more hungry now than when we came in.

Yes, they offered to give us one more round of the pasta, fries and steak but I never saw it come out and they insisted it came out. I would have rather ate at Burger King.

In the end, it takes a lot for me to bash a company but I will not be returning here and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.

Grilled cheese dumplings were served in a set of 6 spoons over room temperature tomato soup. The mac and cheese came with a small amount of tender short rib.  Yes it was cheesy, but the dish lacked kicke. The Pearl of the Sea ($96) was served cold (waiter prepped us) and sure there were the staples- lobster, shrimp, oysters- but it lacked imagination.  Desserts were the best part as the donuts were served warm with 3 choices of sauce.

Thud.  I'll explain.

Enter a pawn shop, through the secret back door, and into a posh Victorian world bordering on museumesque with excess, with theatricality that Elizabeth Taylor would look at home.  Dark colors, glittering jewel boxes, mirrors, pearls.  LOUD music.  Posh, quirky, with swank star appeal.  

But this is Vegas, step out of your limo without panties showing off your woohoo, no one would care.  Mega clubs, ultra lounges, world class food, the likes of Cirque du Soleil.  Hotspots and quirkiness abound.  Exclusivity?  Ha!  Anyone with a credit card is welcome.  Basically, it's NOT special enough and if not for its Cosmo location, it wouldn't make sense in the already over the top city.

The food is good but except for a few provocative gems, isn't special enough for the ambiance.

Gem 1:  Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumpling, the perfect bite size reinterpretation of the classic.  A crisp ""dumpling"" filled with a molten core of five different cheeses in a spoonful of rich, creamy tomato soup garnished by the smallest pinch of bacon and chives.  An incredibly pleasing nostalgic bite whose wow factor brings a smile.

Gem 2: French onion soup dumplings. Think XLB of heavily caramelized, beefy onion soup baked in an escargot dish topped with melted cheese, a crisp crouton atop each.  Be careful, the dumplings contents are HOT. Inventive and just fun to eat.

The remainder of the dishes sampled were correct but not over the top special.  Tomato tartare (tomato and quail egg atop a parmesan crisp - good salinity, acid, and creamy richness), Maine lobster roll (classic prep in old bay, mayo in a sweet potato roll - sweet lobster, well seasoned but just OK), lobster tacos (beer battered lobster topped with a red cabbage slaw and poblano crema - great flavor becoming cloying with fatty flavors but on first bite, great combination, the lobster remaining crisp with gentle chili heat).

Correct lounge service.  Meaning dishes come when they come, you're given what you need to eat, drinks are the priority, always delivered with a smile.

Price to experience; let's just say it's the poor man's Rose, Rabbit, Lie, delivering a somewhat cohesive, intriguing experience at literally a quarter of the cost.

Worth the visit?  I'll leave you hanging.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,33,29,3,D0myVH1vbaHsXKZykGYX0w

Our waitress, Jessica, was the nicest and really personable. She gave us great recommendations. We ordered our drinks: The Woodsman (mine) and Bubbles & Berries (my wife). Both drinks were so damn good. 

As far as food goes, we got the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings to start. Small portion but packed with flavor. We split the burger (which came with their BBQ fries) and grabbed a side of onion rings. 

The burger was melt in your mouth good. The onion rings were some of the best I've had. The BBQ fries were great too. 

Despite being full, I ordered the ""les, nyc"" doughnuts. 6 mini doughnuts that come with chocolate, caramel and raspberry dipping sauces. It was pretty much game over after we finished those off and a food coma was incoming.

Everything tasted good, but Trader Joe's good. Like they went to the frozen section and bought different appetizers and plated them all pretty, and maybe put in a half ass effort for the sauces to make them a little extra. The grilled cheese tomato soup was the best out of those, but the soup part tasted like Annie's canned tomato soup, and the grilled cheese tasted like Trader Joe's cheese quiches.

Walked in without reservations. Looking super bummy compared to the other diners lol, it's a place you definitely want to dress up a bit. 

Food:

Oysters - 4 stars. very good. Fresh tasting. I liked the flavor of the mignonette here, however the bf and I both thought it would be better if it wasn't frozen. 

Bone marrow - 3 stars. I felt this could have been roasted more it wasn't that melt in your mouth texture I look for. I enjoyed the cilantro salad it came with as it added a much needed freshness between the rich marrow and hearty bread. Carmelized onions were also a nice addition I could have eaten those by themselves. 

Sliders - 5 stars. Cooked to perfection, topping with pickled onion and tomato jam. the simple toppings were done so well they really didn't need anything more.

This is a fantastic place to bring Vegas newbies, and always feels like a special experience.  Wind your way through the pawn shop, through the unmarked entrance door and past the hostess stand, then hang an immediate right into the lounge.  Yes, it's essentially just the holding zone for diners waiting for their tables to be ready, but it's a far cry from standing outside Applebee's waiting for your buzzer to go off.

The lounge is dark, moody, and dramatically draped with strings of pearls that all meet in the room's central chandelier.  The couches and chairs are upholstered in supple, purple leather, and textured walls with brass sconces complete the atmosphere.  Everyone is dressed to impress (as you should be), and the high turnover of gorgeous denizens ensures primo people watching.

The bartenders are fantastic, the drinks are imaginative, and the DJs are spinning 90s hip hop. Oh, and French onion soup dumplings.  What more could you ask for?

When I visited in June, my group used this promo to order 2-for-1 signature cocktails, but when I visited in July, I was told that the promo only covers house cocktails...so for every sublime signature cocktail we ordered, we'd get, say, a complimentary old fashioned with soda in it. Ack.

It's a minor niggle, but annoying nonetheless.  Still, don't let the Monday Cocktail Crapshoot keep you away, because Beauty & Essex is still a very special place to spend an evening.",5Oxq2pC8lt-wkxY7coBLCA,0,0,4,YRjnTO1AxqPm19GO1fqgjQ

But the noise, we had to shout to communicate, I've been in dance clubs quite than our evening! Not only was the music loud, but the place was FULL of bachelorette and girls trip large groups who accounted for a significant amount of the noise. If we were able to do without that, maybe it's a whole different experience, but I was ready to leave as soon as we sat down.",LAs0dLp7ntWXbwNfqYgIPA,1,0,1,tx0qZM8-sHA3ylhTI0_uvQ

If you are looking to have dinner in Las Vegas with a semi night club atmosphere, meaning music, cocktails and a scene then you have found the right spot. The menu is great with a really good variety of food to choose from.
Some of my favorite appetizers from the raw bar are the ORANGE KISSED SALMON CEVICHE jalapeño, mango, crispy corn tortilla, the TUNA POKE WONTON TACOS
micro cilantro, radish, wasabi kewpie and the YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI with pickled jalapeño, barrel-aged fuji apple ponzu. The jewels on toast options are good my two favorite are the STEAK TOAST with 
malaysian spices, garlic, pickled radish, serrano pepper and CAESAR TOAST with 
creamy garlic, crispy chicken skin.
You should also try the SHORT RIB 'MAC & CHEESE' with pickled jalapeño, herb cornbread crust from the accessory section of the menu. My favorite Main Course choices are The BASIL PESTO RAVIOLI with 
rock shrimp and tomato fondue. The STREET THAI BBQ CHICKEN with lemongrass parsnip puree, pickled carrot and mango. The GRILLED ATLANTIC SALMON with sherry vinegar, pearl couscous, red chard & celery root puree and lastly the ELOTE STYLE SCALLOPS with charred corn salad, chipotle, lime and cilantro. 
I'm not into lobster tail but if you are then you might want to try the ROASTED LOBSTER TAIL with spanish chorizo arancini and saffron it's a favorite among my friends. The dessert is unbelievable, especially the Strawberry Shortcake Bars which has Liquid Cheesecake inside with a White Chocolate and Cap'n Crunch shell. Simply amazing! If you have a sweet tooth you must try them.! My other favorite desserts are the Spiked Root Beer Float Shot, Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Crème and lastly the Cloud 9 S'mores. You can't go wrong with any that you choose. OK time to go I hope this helps Ciao.",tUJJr2fvXDLbo34i3UGAvg,2,1,4,JUwFCU9gH6OlKFlTF9wOOw

5384236,2017-07-19,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"We chose to dine at Beauty & Essex after a last minute change of heart. We decided to go with a lighter menu, instead of the Steak and Chops place we had originally picked.

From the second I walked into the Pawn Shop in the afternoon to check if they had any availability that night, I could tell this establishment understood hospitality. I was treated like a welcomed guest rather than a last minute bother. 

When we showed up early for our reservation, we were greeted like regulars even though it was our first visit. We stopped at the bar and ordered two glasses of Cava from Casey, our pleasant, friendly, informative bartender.

Before long, our table was ready and we were escorted to our table in the beautiful, if a little dimly lit dining room. The menu here is mainly small plate, meant for sharing type of set up. There are a few larger options listed under the Prime Meats section, but since we had steak the night before, we decided to stick with the smaller options.

Dish #1
Roasted Bone Marrow with Rioja Braised Shallot Marmalade and Grilled Bread.

Bone Marrow is everywhere these days, but we love it and order it just about every time we see it. This was one of our favorite versions ever. The combination of the Rich, Meaty Marrow, Sweet Shallots, Crunchy, Perfectly Grilled Bread was one of the best bites I've had in a long time.

Dish #2
Grilled Cheese and Smoked Bacon Dumplings on Tomato Soup.

These one bite wonders were the highlight of the night. They brought back childhood memories of dipping my grilled Velveeta sandwich into my Campbell's Tomato Soup, only a thousand times better!

Dish #3
""Fish and Chips"" Tacos, Beer Battered Sea Bass, Chile-Lime Slaw, Crispy Matchstick Potatoes.

This was our least favorite dish of the night. It was still very good, but more one note than our other selections.

Dish #4
Basil Pesto Ravioli with Rock Shrimp and Tomato Fondue.

Excellent little pillows of pasta filled with a flavorful Pesto. They would've been fine on their own, but the sauce and perfectly cooked, juicy Shrimp took it to another level.

We were filling up so we decided against Dessert, but there were several items that looked very interesting that we will definitely save room for next time. Beauty and Essex is easily wheelchair accessible and service is wonderful. With so many dining options in Vegas, we only have two restaurants on our must visit list (N9NE and Julian Serrano Tapas).

For a chef seen on Chopped that holds high standards for the food, I was sadly let down and he would have been chopped, especially for the prices charged, which I have no problem paying for if great high quality food! 
I read a few reviews on Yelp before going in. We started with the Yellowtail sashimi: delicious! We then moved to the Greek toast: good, yet not the best I have had. We then moved to the bone marrow with marmalade: bone marrow very salty yet overall a very mediocre and not a memorable dish... very disappointing. We ordered the grilled cheese with bacon dumplings and tomato soup: it did not taste anything like grilled cheese and the tomato soup tasted more like chef boy-r-d ravioli sauce. Just no!!!  Underwhelming. We tried the onion rings and do not get the hype... not better than anywhere else yet overpriced. Our waitress recommended the Brussels sprouts: why???? They were horrible, and I like Brussel sprouts! We barely touched any of it as it was awful. Our last two dishes were the Thai chicken main course: delicious!!! The other was the scallops: again, why the hype? They were more bland and boring than yummy. 
We did not bother getting dessert because we did not want to face more disappointment. 
You enter the restaurant by going through a pawn shop. The restaurant is very pretty and the service is friendly, but a major tip is the following: each waiter told their table what their favorite things are and that we should order it... don't listen!!! Our waitress had horrible recommendations! 
The food is mostly average, some really bad and some really good. Overall, just blah. I would not recommend it at current prices... way too many places that are way better in Vegas for that price.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,1,0,3,G3f0giMa6YTM_ENFiO8-hg

Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - If they got it order it....

Hand Cut Steak Tartare - Fire, on par with any excellent steak tartare i've had

Caesar Toast - Basically a reverse Caesar salad (big ass buttery crouton with salad on it)...

Roasted Bone Marrow - Fire and you can't go wrong with bone marrow...at this point we were full as fuck and full of regrets but fuck it! The food kept coming....

Chile Relleno Empanadas - Very flavorful...at first I thought it was like a Japanese Curry Emapnada but it wasn't and that messed with my head...maybe cause it was food coma time...or I was getting drunk...

Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp - Excellent and one of the lightest dishes we had

Spaghettini - My least favorite dish during this dinner service...lemony, yolky, pesto, pasta did not work well in my honest opinion

Beauty & Essex Burger - If I was hungry this would be the only thing you can eat as it is rich as fuck and can get you full in an instance.

Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs - one bite and it was good but sorry the last remaining room in belly was for...

14 oz. Prime Dry-Aged Sirloin - Cooked the way it should be...medium rare, and was full of that beef flavor.

I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Got to try the Beauty Elixir which was also very good but sweeter.

For our plates that came out we received yellowtail sashimi (always a good choice), avocado toast (not my favorite to ever get at restaurants but this was surprisingly good and would order again), kale and apple salad (so good and one my personal favorites from the night) lobster tacos, and the god damned spaghettini (pesto and eggs and delicious carbs, this is the numba one favorite).

Finished off with a fancy round of shots because we were fancy like that. And definitely spoiled. Thank you Beauty & Essex!

OOhhhh!!!!!   was my first response.  Not only it is amazingly decorated, its in a way I think is just classy and chic.  I'm in.  We sit down for a drink and luckily its pretty quiet still since it was just a little after 5pm.  Had a couple of drinks and decided we would have dinner there that week if possible.  Open Table does the trick and yes, we are able to.  

Couple of days later, we have dinner.  
We start with the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup dumplings which I read rave reviews about - it did not disappoint! 
Then we moved on to caesar toast, mexican street corn ravioli, roasted bone marrow, k-town bao burgers and grilled lamb chops.  HOLY COW it was all good and filled us up! 

The biggest surprise?  We ate like this and the tab with our drinks included was still under $200.  WTF!!  Last year we had a meal someplace that was similar and more than double... I won't mention where.  

Would I go back - YOU BETCHA!  Not only is the service on point, the ambiance is just too unique.  When you sit down you feel as though you KNOW you're going to be eating good food.  Love this place.

Inside it was swanky and dimly lit, with a bunch of picture frames that make up a wall that look like mirrors but aren't; entering this place has almost a speakeasy feel since there's a mock storefront on the outside.

I was surprised at the level of pep our friendly server had in describing all of the options to us, helping to explain what might make sense for us to order based on how hungry we were.  My wife and wound up trying 4-5 plates to share, and were pleased with them all.  The shrimp plate and corn & scallops were favorites of ours (also was a bonus that the shrimp could be ordered gluten free and still have the crunchy coating).

I LOVE the picture frames with necklaces in them. Wish I had a pix, again too dark. But I really loved that look. 

Our server was amazing... we came in with 2 kids (awful ppl I know, we were the only ones with kids there) but they didn't look down to us or make us feel unwelcome. They didn't have any coloring, which my kid was in desperate need of something after a long day of roaming the strip... server brought paper and pen to keep my kid happy! 

We ended up going with the fancy 40 day aged steak to share... and it was the best steak we've ever had... so flavorful. Perfectly cooked. Sauces were remarkable. 

Mac n cheese was slightly disappointing BUT only cause of the type of pasta, it was just too much pasta not enough sauce. Highly suggest a smaller pasta. It was rigatoni I think?

I had recently seen the French onion soup dumplings on some random video floating around the internet which brought me here... I was very disappointed they took it off the menu... but glad I still ate here. It's amazing, and I will be back!

No idea if they stay in business because the drinks are strong and everyone is drunk or what. We went for my birthday and I have to say it was the worst birthday meal I've ever had. The yellowtail sashimi was drown in sauce. It was too salty. You couldn't even taste the fish or try to appreciate it's flavor. The pickled jalapenos were the best part. Too bad they were microscopic.

Thai-style deep fried shrimp. They didn't look or tasted fried. That was confusing. The shrimp was cook well, great size but no flavor! The only thing hinting at Thai was the green papaya slaw.

Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. It's really hard to mess up cheese and bacon,right? This was the best dish. I'm just not sure if it was the best because it was the only flavorful one or if it was really good on it's own. If I had ordered it on it's own and tasted nothing else, would I have still enjoyed it so much?

Oven Braised Chicken Meatball. Nothing special. No flavor other than the ricotta.

Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings. They were huge, crispy. That was a plus. My favorite part of the entire meal was the housemade spicy mustard and ketchup. How sad that that was the most flavor the entire meal. 

I didn't bother with dessert. I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was really disappointing. I think I would have been more satisfied anywhere else. I felt bad that my husband paid for this meal.",17WJQr_LxWRtY2aNeItsKg,2,0,2,tZFzK_DB6fkwWrGyNG6wyA

I don't think there was one dish that we did not like.  It was all good.  And its a great place for sharing.  The staff was great and attentive.  

Here is what we had.

Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche - jalapeño, mango, crispy corn tortilla
Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - chiffonade cilantro, radish, wasabi kewpie
Yellowtail Sashimi - pickled jalapeño, barrel-aged fuji apple ponzu
Shrimp Cocktail - charred jalapeño cocktail sauce
East & West Coast Oysters
Avocado, Lemon & Espelette toast 
Tomato & Creamy Burrata toast - sweet & sour tomato agrodolce, micro basil
'Chile Relleno' Empanadas - poblano, manchego, jalapeño-lime crema
Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings
Mediterranean Cauliflower - pickled shallots, mint, yogurt
Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings - miso honey mustard and sambal ketchup
Chorizo ""Carbonara"" 'Mac & Cheese' - Spanish chorizo, sweet peas, ancho breadcrumbs
Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs - sheeps milk ricotta, wild mushroom, truffle
Spaghettini - zucchini, lemon, parsley pesto, parmigiano, sunny-side up egg
Mexican Street Corn Ravioli - roasted poblano creme, jalapeño, cotija, cilantro
Tandoori Spiced Chicken - curried cauliflower, almonds, grape

I loved both of the toasts we had.  Great flavors on both.  Also loved the onion rings.  Nice and crisp, easy to eat.  The shrimp cocktail had big shrimp and a spicy cocktail sauce.  Yum.  The meatballs were really good too.  Loved the ricotta with it.  That was the best part.

Overall everything was super flavorful and tasty.  Great for sharing.  The restaurant has a fun vibe.  You actually have to walk through a pawn shop to get to the entrance.  Then its sort of dark and mysterious inside.  A fun place!",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,1,0,5,MPwzSVdyhxL5mASJlTKPJw

First of all, the place was so incredibly loud that I literally couldn't talk to my husband who was two feet across the table from me. We could also barely hear our server, and I felt like I had to yell at him to order. There was a party of about twenty women right behind us who kept cheering and yelling and singing and honestly just being obnoxious. I understand that there is little the staff could've done to quiet them down, but maybe they could've been seated in one of the more private areas? 

For cocktails, we each ordered the woodsman, which was meh. It was a little flavorless and really didn't taste like the description. 

For food, we split:
- caesar toast: very tasty and fresh; one of my favorites
- k-town bao burger: needed more sauce and seasoning
- chile relleno empanadas: quite yummy, but a little cold when they came out
- grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings: our favorite dish; they were fun and inventive
- roasted mushroom pizzetta: underwhelming; I didn't taste the truffle cream at all
- carrot layer cake: the cake itself was great, but the ice cream just felt unnecessary and didn't complement the cake very well

I thought it was a bit annoying that you had to exit the restaurant to use the bathroom. The pawn shop idea in the front seems cute, but it's just another barrier when getting to the bathroom, especially since so many people were crowded in there.",yzrFhOYx7WoY5KQZchfXag,0,0,3,lPcWvHHLqLxIJJxBcxySGg

I made reservations online for a late dinner. I did specify that my husband and I were celebrating an anniversary and wanted a nice table, if possible! 

When you arrive at Beauty and Essex, you walk through a real pawn shop...it's pretty cool, you can actually buy items. If not interested, go through to the hostess stand. The area is nice! My husband and I took a photo op there, lol. 

As we were waiting for a table, we noticed there were some available, but we weren't being called. When we were finally called, the hostess mentioned she had us wait for a couple extra minutes so she could get us a nice table since we were celebrating an anniversary! I thought that was pretty awesome! 

Upon being seated, our server greeted us rather quickly! She was super friendly and fun! She had good recommendations on drinks and explained how the food/menu worked! 

For a cocktail, I got the O.D.B ""OLD Dirty Bramble""! I mean how could I not with that name? It was tequila, blackberries, honey, ginger, and lemon. It was sooooo good! My husband got the Woodsman...which he liked.

Now for the amazing food! Everything we ordered was shareable, which I love... so you can try everything! We ordered the grilled cheese, bacon, and tomato soup dumplings. O-M-G! Soooo freaking good! I can still taste it and it's something that's craveable. Tasty and cute presentation! You MUST get these! Next, we had the Thai style fried shrimp. I've had my fair share of shrimp, but these were amazing! They were packed with flavor and probably the best shrimp I've had! I highly recommend these! We also ordered chicken meatballs with ricotta and truffle. These were very good as well. I feel like you could find something similar to this elsewhere, but still tasty. We also had an Asian inspired chicken and some brussel sprouts. Everything was very good! We were pretty full and definitely had food to go! 

Our server acknowledged it was our anniversary and told us to save room for dessert! We ordered the reverse smores. Those were amazingly good! They totally hit the spot! And then, she came out with a complimentary anniversary dessert; cake pops! It was definitely a night of indulging! 2 desserts...why not? 

The ambiance is nice. They have on some really good music, old school hip hop and r&b. The room towards the back had a bit of a different vibe than the front. 

The food can be pricy. It is Vegas. It is owned by a chef on food network. But, it's worth it! I enjoyed every second of my dining experience! Lovely ambiance, wonderful service, and tasty comforting food!",pgLsGu_uUW2j0LUQETOwaw,1,1,5,4OcOtQCa4xAeVjVi7biyCg

The guests has to speak loudly because the club music was over the top loud. It was like a JOB to be able to listen to and comprehend our server...

5770667,2017-07-12,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"First I want to say, EAT HERE!  This is the best dinner we had in Vegas. 

Now, the negatives.  This is why it isn't 5 stars...
- The beverage service was quite slow.  A guest should never be letting food get cold because they don't have their wine.  Yet this happened twice.
- It's super loud.  

Now, that said, the food is great and the food service is terrific.  Our waitress was well versed in the menu and able to guide us expertly.  And not what I'm used to in Las Vegas which usually comes down to 'my favorites are the kobe with foie gras and the lobster with truffles', i.e. the most expensive choices.  She guided us to some great options that looked fairly pedestrian on the menu.  To wit, the mushroom flat bread was sublime!

So we had that flatbread, the tomato carpaccio toast, the onion rings, and the chile releno empanadas.  The onion rings were really well made with dipping sauces that make you rethink ketchup and mustard - and as good as they were they were the least impressive of the dishes.  The carpaccio and the flat bread were inspired.  The former used a dried tomato to amp up the flavor.  The empanadas were a bit doughy on the corners, but the center was amazing.  Really really good food.

We had wine by the glass (as I wanted red and my husband white) and again the waitress guided us to really good options that weren't just the most expensive.

The venue is quirky, a speak-easy venue 'hidden' behind a pawn shop.  That's kind of fun.  The food though - well, eat here.  'nuff said",cW_MWzbzmg4LCKHkeEuigQ,1,0,4,IxkNAkg3STpzwVXl8JjMUg

We arrive we wait well over an hour to be seated, when seated we were placed in an awkward half circle booth with a chair on the end and in the back corner of the room next to the waiter station, probably the worst table in the entire place. The noise of the room was awful, deafening, so loud when our waitress finally walked up and asked how we were, the birthday girl, (yes I said birthday girl whose night was just about ruined by this dinner) said ""we are pretty disgruntled"" and our waitress only laughed and then asked if we wanted cocktails, when we declined because we had plenty of time waiting to get a cocktail or several out front, she promptly asked would we like any of the 4 different waters out there and said I'll just get you some ice water but decided we didn't need ice upon filling our glasses. Most of the food actually tasted good but there is some breakdown between ordering and actually receiving it. Our appetizers trickled out. We had 6 people each couple ordered an appetizer for sharing but for someone reason we would get one and then wait again 10-20 minutes for the next one, and then it was time to get ready for the big wait, actually receiving an entree. 1020pm is when we finally received our dishes, meantime during the wait we had time to witness a stack of trays falling and nearly hitting one of our party members in the head, a water girl hitting another water guy in the head with a water pitcher, a waiter digging in a bag behind our round seat for whatever another one trying to get around him so causing one to pretty much step into our dining area standing between me (the unlucky one in the added chair to the table aka the uncomfortable 6th wheel spot to the half circle table) let me tell you this table got a lot of passerby action but not so much attention. Drink glasses left unfilled, empty dishes on the table etc. The esthetics are lovely but it is overshadowed by horrible time management and service. One complaint about the food would have to be the 10 oz thick cut filet for $48. I love steak and this was almost inedible. In that the rub used was so spicy I literally cut every side of this steak off and only consumed the middle section. And trust me I'm Cajun. I eat spicy each and every day. But I am also usually aware when I'm going to consume something spicy and thick cut filet for $48 is definitely not something one expects to be spicy. And it was almost a reminder of a pepperoni type of spice. It was a very poor decision to ruin a beautiful cut of meat that way. I literally was unable to consume at least 4 oz  If not more of the 10 oz steak. I was really excited about this restaurant, but that excite was definitely ruined and sadly there will not ever be a return visit.

We were seated next to a couple who was clearly in a food coma but telling us how they loved everything they ate and insisted we get the Mexican street corn ravioli. Ok we will!

Our server was a young lady who offered us water and cocktails to start. They have a craft cocktail menu that looked interesting but since it's Vegas, I was already 3 vodkas in before dinner so I passed on this part of the menu.

She explained that the menu is meant for sharing and for two of us we should go with 3 or 4 dishes. We started with the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings which were amazing. Little bites of grilled cheese sprinkled with bacon dust sitting in tomato soup.  We then had the Thai fried shrimp which were very good. Light and crisp, not greasy or heavily battered. Our neighbor table told us to get the bao burgers so we tried those as well. They were good but in hindsight I would have tried something different. And finally the ravioli which was something I am still thinking about - pasta filled with Mexican grilled corn and cojita cheese topped with a poblano cream sauce. OMG- SO delicious.

Chef Santos has described B & E's food as ""whimsical"" and some of it did indeed exude a certain whimsy- small bites such as grilled cheese/tomato soup and a yummy slider are more than worthy of a mention! 

Drinks were a hit, and my fave was the Emerald Gimlet. This basil infused gem was fresh and packed a punch! The second drink we tried was a boozy Arnold Palmer which was very refreshing.

Beauty & Essex is a highly pretentious and over-priced ""speak-easy tapas bar"" with mediocre service, horrible acoustics, and your typical rowdy vegas crowd.  Its only redeeming quality is the fantastic food.  If you want less pretentiousness and better service, go to Cleo. 


The long version:

The restaurant was largely empty when I arrived for a reservation at 6pm for me and 6 friends. We had a last minute add-on and wanted a table for 8, but the hostess up front gave us misinformation saying that we had to wait to be seated when the whole party arrived or if we were seated early they would kick us out at 7:45pm. We decided to wait at the bar. Then when we went to get seated at around 6:30, she said we missed our reservation by 1.5 hours (wrong) and that we would need to give back the table at 7:45p. This made no sense as the restaurant was largely empty at the time, and the idea that a restaurant (a high-end one at that) would have a seating time limit is odd. She also clearly had our timing off. But whatever, we get seated at a table and our waitress comes by and states that ""we must be in a hurry and that we'll need to leave by 7:45"". Again, what is with these people trying to get rid of us?? Luckily we were able to clarify this situation with management, but it definitely didn't start our evening off well. 

The hidden restaurant is sneakily located behind a faux ""pawn shop"" with a cool secret entrance and fabulous decor. It's a cool spot that makes you feel swanky and part of the in-crowd just because you know about the place. The interior is dark and lush and very romantic. But other than that, the restaurant is not very well thought out. First, no restroom in the restaurant (I guess that might be a vegas thing?). Second, the whole seating area is filled with 4 person tables that are basically touching each other, and more than once wait staff dropped dishes. I can only imagine this is bc the restaurant is hard to move around. Third, the acoustics were absolutely terrible. I could barely hear the person sitting next to me, let alone others at my table or the waitress herself! The atmosphere, while dark and seemingly intimate, is not conducive to enjoying other people's company. 

However, the food is phenomenal. Dishes are small plates meant for sharing and the prices are pretty high. But man, the food is GOOOOOOD. We all ordered about 3 dishes per person and shared amongst the table. Would highly recommend:

1. French Onion Soup Dumplings - Incredible. Cheesy. Flavorful. Bite-sized deliciousness. 
2. Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings - It's the perfect combo of tomato soup and grilled cheese in one bite. 
3. Garganelli - One of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time
4. Thai style deep fried shrimp - Very tasty, not too sweet, not too salty, and shrimp was fresh. 
5. ANY OF THE DESSERTS. THEY ARE ALL GOOD. (my fave was the donuts, but the devil's food layer cake with milk ice cream was also incredible). 

Tips:
*Get here early
*Free champagne for ladies
*Good for small groups
*If driving to the Cosmo, park on east side and take east elevators up to 3rd floor :)",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,6,4,3,FFH79zPQ6TdypzCcyrmOAw

We had reservations for 7pm mid-week, and we needed them. The 'enter through the back of the pawn shop' gimmick is really neat. The room is gorgeous, and we were seated in a small curved sofa towards the back wall. Probably the best seat in the house.

Water came, ordered cocktails, sent one water glass back with a chip. 5 minutes later, cocktails come, ask for the water glass and get it. Yeah, small thing, but it was an sign of things to come. 

Our waitress suggested 2-3 items per person, so we ordered 4 to start, and I asked her if I should order them two at a time so that we weren't rushed, and she assured us that she would take care of that.

So yeah, all four dishes came within a few minutes of each other. So rather than eat in the order in which we wanted, we had to eat based on what dish would taste best lukewarm.

On to the food. Considering the provenance of the chef, we found the dishes to range from decent to mediocre.

So yeah, 4 dishes was plenty, we ended up eating faster than we wanted, food was underwhelming, and our waitress had too many tables.

I had admired all the food pics and admired the inventive menu...could picture my five-star review.... couldn't wait for it!  Finally made it to the Cosmopolitan on Sunday night right after they opened, feeling clever that I knew to look for a pawn shop.  What I didn't know was, GO through it.  Don't expect a pawn shop employee to be helpful and tell you to go through the closed door when you say you're there for dinner. (Gal simply said ""okay"" when we said we were hoping to dine). Soooo...TIP: walk in the pawn shop, turn to your left and open the door.   (you're welcome!)

Not overly comfortable, especially considering the place was pretty empty. Now I'm not the most observant human being on the planet, but I couldn't help but notice one of my forks had a big glob of something clinging to it.  Pointed it out to our Server and he removed it with a ""sorry"", but didn't replace it.

We were fine with tap water.  Husband is a Bourbon guy, so he ordered: The Woodsman:  Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Allspice Dram, Maple Syrup, Lemon, Muddled Pears, while I went
with a Cabernet.  Both were quite good, which was a good thing as we were $33 committed at this point.

Two items I wanted to try after having seen all the pics were the tomato soup dumplings and the french onion ones.  Well they aren't doing the french onion ones anymore.  Wah!   But fortunately the tomato soup ones are still on the menu. That was a no-brainer must-try for me.  Surprisingly, Husband wanted us to try the Bone Marrow.  (surprising because he doesn't eat meat on bones, so I assumed he would never want to try the inside of bones).  And the Thai Shrimp sounded really good, so we decided to start with those three.

Loved that our Server asked if we were in any hurry or if he could put the dishes in to come out one at a time.  No hurry for us.  The moment I'd been waiting for arrived...the dumplings came out first.  Beautiful presentation on the soup spoons, but... a bit hard to eat.  After awkwardly throwing a whole one in my mouth, I got smart and cut the other two with a knife.  Never did taste the smoked bacon, but they were good.  $18 good?  Maybe? 

Somewhere around this point, the young guy pouring water managed to dump some in Husband's lap.  Oops.  Another ""sorry"".  

So, the Marrow arrives, and my silverware had been cleared after the dumplings.  I had to ask for more.  All of the components worked beautifully together...the jam, salt, and teeny bit of greens.  There was just enough for the six small pieces of grilled bread.  Good, but again...$19 good?

We were still eating the marrow when the shrimp arrived. Five beautiful shrimp, lightly battered, nice Thai flavor with a small salad underneath.  Slightly spicy.  Very good, but it didn't go with the marrow (remember, no hurry and one at a time?) and for $22...well...maybe worth it?

Ready for dessert, and knowing my obsession with fried dough, Husband ordered the Doughnuts for us.  We also each got a cup of decaf.  The doughnuts arrived before our coffee  (not the order we would have preferred).  They are round large doughnut holes with cinnamon sugar and three dipping sauces...chocolate, caramel and berry.  The caramel was both of our favorites.  We enjoyed it, but would have enjoyed it a lot more at half the $14 price.  Coffee was good and surprise-surprise not crazy expensive at $3.50 each.  Although we were not offered a 
refill.

Two more things that we weren't crazy about...no restrooms in the place.  Yes, I know that's not unusual for Vegas, but for a restaurant of this caliber?  And the other thing that got annoying was the repetitive spiel that the Servers all use.  Tables are close enough together so we couldn't help but hear them recommending how many dishes to order, etc. etc.  Good to be trained on the selling aspect, but more attention to detail like silverware, and caring if you've gotten a lap full of water might be important also.

Yes I realize this is Vegas and the Strip and the Cosmopolitan, and we expected high prices, have happily paid them in the past for celebrity chef experiences, but this time the experience, especially considering the service, didn't warrant them.   Which is why the 5-star review I was sure I was going to write, is a 3-star.  A-ok.",fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,7,2,3,gWaHizXZbOmA67jqJVZqzQ
5956451,2017-06-17,1,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"I had no interest in going to a pawn shop in Las Vegas.  Especially, one located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan.   But, why we're so many people walking in?  While we dined at DOCG next door, we saw large groups of well dressed people walk into this pawn shop and never return!
So, we only ordered 2 small plates from DOCG ( both were delicious- meatballs and eggplant parmigiana) and decided to check out what the black hole next door was all about.
OMG. 
After walking into the pawn shop, we were then led into a gorgeous restaurant with leather bound wood walls and a classic bar.  This is the epitome of a ""Swanky Place"". Having just eaten small plates next door, we opted for their raw bar while sitting at the bar sipping on delicious gimlets. 
The shrimp cocktail was served with a spicy cocktail sauce.  The dozen raw oysters were served with three types of sauces: vinegar, horseradish and cocktail. 
Service was excellent.  The seafood was top of the line.

As it's in the Cosmopolitan you'd expect it to be a bit pretentious but that wasn't the case at all. Some recommendations: the lamb chops, fried shrimp, chicken meatballs, soup dumplings. You can't really go wrong, though. Everything was great. Highly recommended.",7Rfn9Sg5SlxiJioQzbbqPw,0,0,5,ti98L6c5gpF-1MaBvfzc_w
5975367,2017-04-09,0,uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"Beauty and Essex hides behind the glass counters of pawn shop on the 3rd level of the Cosmopolitan. Doesn't seem like much, and then you enter into this beautiful lavish 20's style restaurant covered in chandeliers and a dining room enclosed through hung lockets. 

They offer a wide range of tapas style dishes. Everything from oysters, to individual soup dumplings, to personal size strawberry shortcake bars and depending on your party size they custom order the amount so everyone gets their own (I just love that!) 

Beauty and Essex also does a partner server style. We had two servers for our table which made it easier to order cocktails faster and explain the dishes as they were coming out-the restaurant was super super busy (Ana and Apolo were both so knowledgeable and picked out some of their favorite dishes for us to try)  

Bottom line.....If your looking for a quiet romantic dinner skip this place, BUT if your going with a group of people and want some amazing cocktails and funky food options book Beauty and Essex! And request Ana and Apolo!! 

Favs: 
--walnut kale salad (and I hate kale!! It was so good!!!)
--tomato soup dumplings
--yellowtail sashimi
--lobster roll (super tiny! But delish)
--French onion soup dumplings 
--strawberry shortcake ice cream bars (just like your childhood remembers them)

Wouldn't order again:
--avacado toast (order the chicken caeser instead) 
--empanadas-just eh.....just basically fried dough 

My only complaint is beauty and Essex doesn't have a huge liquor selection. It's crazy to me that such a huge restaurant doesn't carry Kettle One, Grey Goose, or Don Julio",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,0,1,5,kUPXi97ryD6CDWZOYmZ3Cw

The man attending the hostess table was kind, but the two ladies with him were absolutely miserable with their jobs. The place was beautiful, tried an overrated whisky apple drink that was just alright... not much more I can say. For such an ""upscale"" restaurant, customer service should come first!!!",ehhWvwp5jermrZfoEtnDgQ,1,0,1,IputXpGo42-J6hAOUXcIkg
