They let us in and made a salad and 3 fresh smoothies and juice for us even though they had already closed 15 minutes earlier.   I just have to say how extraordinary that was for them to take care of us....they seemed to know we needed a little kindness and nourishment after a long day!   The juice was so delicious.  We had never been customers, but no doubt we will go back for a more full experience and try their bowls too.   Thank you for a business that cares about people and serves healthy treats!

POKE: I won't order these here any more due to their poor value. Barely any fish, many toppings and ingredients out of stock, overpriced for what you get. I like that they have poke bowls available but unless they're going to do them well, there's no point.

ACAI: Some days there's a ton of fruit topping, other times there's barely any. Sometimes the acai flavor is strong and fresh, other times the mix is pale and bland. I don't know if it's a product issue or a training issue but I can't order the same thing twice and receive the same product. Same issues with pricing as above, overpriced for what you get.

Then, I discovered that the owner is now the same owner as Acai To The T, so that discovery restored sanity to the world (cuz that is among THE finest acai bars I've found yet).

Anyway, Bowlology has the same menu as its sister store, the young ladies that work there are truly delightful, and I've dealt with every one of them.  Ingredients couldn't be fresher.  Restaurant is always so clean that it sparkles.  (As stated), the crew working there is personable, knowledgable, quick, and work hard to see that their customers are satisfied. It's the only place where somebody has come from behind the counter to ask if my Pitaya Berry Good bowl was good, if it was as I wanted it, and if I needed anything else.  I found one other restaurant that I like a little bit more, but that other place is on Maui, which makes getting there weekly pretty tough.

I've been a customer for quite a while here and I always come in and get the PB acai bowl so today I came in and decided to get something different. I went with the ocean bowl and substituted apple juice for chocolate almond milk because I like that blend in the PB bowl. Unfortunately I didn't like it because it was sour so I asked the cashier if I can just get something different so she said she'll get the manager for me so I was like yeah okay cool that's fine! So the manager came and I said ""I apologize I wante to try something new and I know it's an inconvenience but can you please remake it?"" I was being really nice because I work in fast food I know how customers can be but that's also my money. So she looked at me blankly and said ""so you want us to remake it because you changed the order and didn't like it?"" Honey, yes, that's exactly what I want you to do because at every food establishment when a customer doesn't like something it can just easily be remade. She then just grabbed my unwanted bowl from my grasp which struck me by surprise... So I ended up just saying thank you and she jus looked at me and went to make it which made me feel so stupid, I don't appreciate the attitude. Normally I'd just speak up for myself but I was already tired from the heat and just wanted my acai bowl. That was very rude and I would expect a manager to treat customers with respect but I suppose not. Maybe learn to treat people better when they're being nice to you??? Just a wild suggestion.

Not the case in Vegas. I had to drive 25 minutes to get to bowlology which I found on an article posted on Facebook about healthy places to eat in Vegas. 

I ordered the Hula bowl, it was delicious and I felt great. It was 8.10 with tax for the regular size. Maybe it was a little more expensive then when I lived in San Diego but worth every penny.

I hope they open a location closer to me. I'm in southern highlands. I ordered one to go for tomorrow but now sure how it will hold up, this is the kind of food to be eaten when you buy it. 

I had to wait a few minutes for the second one I ordered and they gave me a couple of coupons for a free ones for my wait. I will definitely go back whether or not they did that but it was nice that they did do that anyway.",n2MLpaHOQJ8DE6URLkFn6w,0,0,5,6hhiqBylNNFKfkBIwAKqfg

I went here with my wife and we decided to try the poke. I ordered the spicy shoyu and my partner did the build your own. I also ordered the PB lover for later on. 

The poke was really good, the spice was very light it could use more kick but all the ingredients in the bowl made the tuna very tasty. I liked what my wife made but they put too much mayo in it.

I tried the PB lover super bowl and it was soo good!! It has the strawberry with banana peanuts and chocolate. I was not expecting it to be so great because the last Superbowl I tried tasted like vitamins.

My coworkers in my office noticed my new obsession and surprised me with two coupons to give Bowlology a whirl. I was stoked!  

Ambiance: 

Order at counter. 
Open seating. 
Pick a table and plop down. 
The ambience is open, airy and clean. 
I loved their bench/table seating combo. 
We were catching up on some emails and needed to get some work done. 
We liked how each table had a charging station/usb to plugin. 
They also offer free wifi. 
Ask one of their 'bowlisitas' for their wifi code. 
Ambiance: 4 stars 

Service: 

The gal at the counter was friendly. 
I showed up today with my coworker in tow. 
I explained I had received our coupons to give them a try.  
She showed me my options and we were able to use them without a problem. 
Service: 5 stars 

Food: 

We both ordered the Hula Bowl in their regular size at 16oz each. 
You have a choice of Açaí or Pitaya as your base.
I tried Pitaya and she ordered her bowl with Açaí. 
The base is then blended with peaches, pineapple, mango, banana & vanilla almond milk. 
Our toppings: sliced strawberries, bananas, coconut flakes, granola, and a drizzle of honey.  
We both enjoyed our bowls.
My coworker stated hers was sweeter than others she's tried. 
My pitaya version wasn't overly sweet and I really enjoyed the honey and coconut flakes. 
We both enjoyed our bowls and will put bowlology on our rotation. 
Food: Solid 4 stars

Overall: 

Everything was good. 
This is a solid spot to grab an Açaí Bow. 
I noticed they offer Poke Bowls and will have to come give that a try. 
I like that they have a loyalty stamp card program.

I have been beyond satisfied on each visit. The bowls are delicious, the staff is great, and the prices are decent. I thought it was too expensive at first since I was new to acai bowls, but trying out other bowls around town has made me realize that Bowlology is far more reasonably priced. The price Bowlology charges for their large is in most cases less than what the other places charge for their smallest size.

I recommend the PB Lover. One of the girls always suggests pitaya instead of acai and it's definitely worth a try but I prefer the acai with this bowl. I try to eat vegan as much as possible and they are very accommodating to that, even checking labels for me and substituting ingredients when needed (ie. cacao powder for chocolate chips). The Green Machine and the Hula are also very good and I highly recommend them. All their bowls have a perfect, creamy texture. The bowls are also natural with no added sweeteners.

I always include half brown rice and half spring mix greens as a base to the one of four options of poke bowls they sell.

First time great...ordered a PJ cup and my chef friend ordered a few different items. Man behind counter professional and efficient. Today, not so much.  I went and ordered the same but I requested a smaller cup because the standard cup is too much for me.  Same man....nice but said they don't serve in a smaller cup and that I'd have to order a kids ice cream only. One piece of advice...get rid of the word, 'no,' 'we can't,' and 'not allowed,' from your company. It kills business. Please tell me why I'd return if I can't  get what I want? You have all the product but a smaller version isn't allowed? Let me know when this is rectified and I'll return. I moved directly across the street.

The poke bowl, was not as great. The edamame should have been cooked a bit longer, and maybe the rice too. The rice was hard, it wasn't traditional sushi rice. It wasn't really spicy either. The tuna poke was okay. I wouldn't get this item again though, I'll probably just stick to the açaí & pittaya bowls.

The wicked tuna was really good but some of the larger pieces of tuna were frozen solid! No flavor and almost inedible. The OG bowl had so much sauce. Way too salty and again, the tuna was frozen. Complete disappointment. 

The acai bowl was good, but I wish there was more of it. The bowl was half base and half toppings. If I wanted a bowl of fruit and granola, I'd order that. 

Not sure what's going on with this place, but sadly, it has gone down hill quickly.",4Y24cWi6tv0DhXLc8Sd2FA,0,0,2,MltkwrA7pZmPgPHkwaK9dg

Had the regular hula bowl and I won't be back. I make acai bowls on my own at home for over 10 years. The bowl here lacks acai. Acai is dark purple my bowl was very light purple and didn't taste like acai. I feel like the bowl is blended mostly with banana and other frozen fruit not acai. If there is acai in there it's not much. 

I won't be back.",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,8,7,1,IHAWpxA6AWrqP0A0fmdwqw

5806459,2017-07-11,0,ut3r-meTqKfkEZBzkdBE6w,I went here for the first time last weekend and I've been craving it ever since. It was super refreshing on a hot day. I do wish it came in a different kind of container and a smaller choice in size since cut fruit doesn't stay fresh overnight and the smallest size they have was a bit to much for me. I ended up tossing my leftovers the next day which bummed me out. Otherwise I really enjoyed my bowl.,hfIb8X76IZwOa8ioE34ZRA,0,0,4,ApDTNd9_iTmb5wjFnhaEaw
5809413,2018-05-25,0,ut3r-meTqKfkEZBzkdBE6w,"The poke bowl I ordered here was great and the portions are good but I think the price is a little bit more compared to other places that have poke bowls in Vegas. I ordered the wicked tuna poke bowl which was $11.00 and I added salmon for $3.00, seaweed for $0.75, and green onions for $0.50. It came out to $16.51 with tax. I have been to several places around town that have poke bowls that will let you add all kinds of toppings for a set price and allow you to do half salmon half tuna (which is what I wanted) without charging $3.00 more for the salmon. Having said that, the poke bowl itself was yum and everything tasted fresh and good. Probably one of the freshest tasting poke bowls I have had in Vegas, but somehow not as inspiring and creative with the flavors and toppings. Kind of a generic poke bowl, but still good. I would go back :)",ScwVhHmUFLZwVW9E5fvKjw,0,0,4,BF4keIuBVxE8ioANKmGVMQ

I've had plenty, visited tons of establishments with the same concept but something about this company/brand just blows me away every time I visit! From its purity of flavors, you can definitely taste the freshness and heart that this place offers! 

The first time I've had Bowlology was early 2016, I wasn't a fan of ""checking in"" on yelp but if I had, It'd probably be more than 20. They offer a variety of fusion goodies that just compliments each other in a way that it's addictive. I mean, addiction is bad, however, I'd give this place an exception.

Reasonably priced with the quality the comes with, a modern,simplistic,spacious shop that can cater to us hungry customers AND a welcoming, friendly workforce. I mean, can you beat that?

Huge shoutout to Dillon and Josh for crafting such an amazing concept! I met these gentlemen in my shop and I was crazed when I found out they were the creators of this awesome business, being said that they even offered me a free Acai! But that's for another topic! 

Keep up the fantastic job guys!",cMva3C2QbmmvW1flAwsNVQ,1,0,5,B8lDpqmp87soMpRT6Z4ycg
5895018,2017-12-27,0,ut3r-meTqKfkEZBzkdBE6w,First time here at Bowlology. I ordered the Spicy Shoyu. It was ok. Maybe it just wasn't what I expected. The tuna was ok (could of been fresher) and it wasn't spicy in my opinion. I might try again. Next time I'll try a smoothie and maybe a fruit bowl.,HVOA8lVvoZBUibJe743uQQ,0,0,3,4A0rFmnTWl4U1nG9qpKFgA
