2930,2015-03-01,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"I went on a Saturday around 4pm. Apart from me there was just a family of 3, but given the time and the fact that the intersection Tropicana/Spencer is maybe not the most popular, I guess it's not too unusual. I received a very warm welcome by the Russian waitress. The place itself is quite large with a stage  area as well as a bar section. It's a bit darkish and quite cozy, but your mileage may vary.

Because I wasn't really hungry but I wanted to check out the restaurant anyway, I just had the JULIEN (mushrooms in cream sauce and cheese), the SOLYANKA (typical Russian soup with good chunks of sausage) as well as the NAPOLEON cake. 

I found all things to be very tasty.

I liked their homemade KVAS as well. A little bit of a warning, even though KVAS is supposed to have like 1% alcohol, after a few refills I did feel something. This is no criticism, just to warn those who are not supposed to drink any alcohol at all.

I'll be back soon to try their main courses.",y5w-8aZQc1nVc82e0vXsaA,2,0,4,r-neJ4CkLpIe_IFBDiXnyg

244907,2015-01-17,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"BF and I went to Cafe Mayakovsky on a Tuesday nite, thinking it probably wouldn't be too busy.  Little did we know it was Russian New Year and the place was completely reserved for the celebration.  After sweet talking the hostess, we were allowed to sit at a small table in the bar if we promised to leave in time for an 8:30 reservation. We agreed.  We wanted to try the restaurant to bring our ethnic dining club to.  

We started with appetizers from Yelp suggestions of Herring and stuffed cabbage rolls.  Herring was fresh herring served with boiled potatoes and hard boiled eggs.  I thought the herring was too fishy, by the BF liked it.  The cabbage rolls were somewhat bland and with no taste of cabbage at all.  I ordered the lamb shashlik, and BF ordered the grilled cornish hen.  The lamb, my favorite red meat, was overcooked and tough with bits of inedible gristle, and came with some white rice with 3 cuke slices and 3 tomato slices.  Cornish hen was split and splayed on the plate and served with only 3 cuke slices.  No starch or vegs.  Hen, however, was delicious.  

The restaurant was subtly decorated but attractive, with a large black and white picture of St. Petersburg on the wall.  There was also a small stage and what was perceived to be a small dance floor, altho no entertainment was offered that evening.

We did have a Russian red wine which I absolutely loved.  I wrote down the name to see if I could find it at Total Wine, but no luck finding it anywhere in NV.

Our dinner, including 2 glasses of wine each, cost over $100.  End result is that while Russians/Ukranians love this restaurant and are used to the style of cooking, unfortunately, we did not think that our club of ethnic diners would enjoy it enough.  We probably will not return.",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,2,0,2,KmXyNm8s5337wlVx0PBX0w

Incidentally, Mayakovsky has become our must-go place every time we are visiting Vegas. Seldom that I get such chance to TRULY relax and have a good time, great conversation over our favorite Eastern European / Russian delicacies. Yes, the menu is not vast, as it is a small place, but all the great and diverse 'staples' are represented and tailored to suit most tastes.
This is ridiculous to read that 'food wasn't fresh and did not taste good'. I have been here numerous times, and I can reassure everyone to just nevermind such reviews... This is not a 'trendy place' or a 'Russian club' - this is a place where people have meals, and do so in a quieter setting so they can communicate - yes, good 'ole talk to each other, and have good time. Speaking of which.. the place wasn't loud, which is a GREAT plus to us. But, it did have nice ambient music that was set just at the right level by - yes, actually, a live DJ.
I am pretty sure it can get louder and even turn into a small dance floor if there is a nice crowd and a good occasion such as Birthday... in fact, last night there was a Birthday party with ~20 people in attendance, and it still wasn't loud and the two of us were having good tete-a-tete time and were not bothered.
All in all.... the menu items were great, and we have tasted quite a few - almost the entire menu by now. Yesterday I've had the Georgian khinkali, and initially I wasn't sure and went on a limb... and oh boy was I happy!...
The dessert menu has just three items, but there is no wrong pick: the Napoleon, the Prague, and the Russian layered honey cake. All done expertly and presented in a very nice way.
In conclusion, I do recommend this place wholeheartedly.",dX1YZLoIlMj2jAQL2uisIQ,1,0,5,QMhA65TvVyiIC-ZbRozqCw

First of all, it doesn't look like a restaurant, it looks like an eatery. The service was very slow and disgusting. There were only two waiters and they couldn't manage their orders on time. We had to wait fifteen minutes for our appetizers and they were very salty. We got our entrees after an hour of waiting but they brought the wrong order((( Instead of Beef Stroganoff they brought Chicken Kiev. Though they did say they would change my dish, I refused, cause I knew it would take another hour also.  
However, the Chicken Kiev was not so bad as the service though...It wasn't what i've had before, but quite good. The prices are not so high, but I'll never be back again. BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!",qzz9Q-hKfOqgqoNncXr7MQ,8,5,1,QXEDzGQT30bOcryF_0AFtw

Small, by Russian standards, place in the off strip mall, that back in 2008 was probably completely abandoned, so you get that little destitute feeling when you pull up, but.... if you are looking for decent Russian fair, definitely a place to try. 
We, the wife and me, tried this place twice for lunch, but I doubt it's any worth for dinner. Food was dialed in just right, portions not overwhelmingly huge, like most Russian places trying to compete by size. Menu is pretty good variety and available on line, service with a smile, especially if you speak Rusian, JK - looks like they have this part figured pretty good too. So you can try at least couple of dishes and share with a second half if you wish. And yes, I did check out the bathroom, squeaky clean, just like it's suppose to be. 
Btw, don't know what someone was saying about not easy to spot the place, my crippled phone GPS found it on the first try and that's unusual performance.",FStddccNcFLQMQ2ouZjP1w,1,1,4,EhmNSWc7wZYs2cDLwhqQEQ

But beneath its unassuming exterior lives one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. We started off our meal with pickled herring, perozki, mushroom blinchiki, and, of course, vodka. The house perozki are piping hot buns full of meat or dill potatoes. Although both types were very good, Mayakovsky's potato-filled buns were seasoned more flavorfully than their beef cousins. The blinchiki, too, was excellent -- but the pickled herring, on the other hand, might be classified as more of an acquired taste. (Apparently it's a traditional chaser for vodka?)

For our entrees, we ordered Chicken Tabaka, a whole roasted cornish hen served with raw vegetables. Mayavovsky's version of the dish was rubbed with garlic and crisped to perfection. And although service was leisurely, the Russian-speaking waitstaff was attentive and kept our bread and water full.

1775 E TROPICANA, SUITE 30
LAS VEGAS, NV

We heard there was a Russian food restaurant in Vegas and since we have never had Russian food before, we wanted to try it.  We found a $25 off restaurant.com coupon and tried it out Friday night, July 17, 2015.

The restaurant has a Tropicana address but it's actually off the street a little bit at the end of a small outdoor mall of stores near the old Liberace Museum.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it was richly decorated and exceptionally clean (including the bathrooms).  There were five of us in attendance, four adults and one child.

We were promptly served ice water and menus.  We ordered sodas, and one of each of the Russian non-alcoholic drinks Mors ($2.95) a berry drink and Kvas ($2.95) which tasted like non-alcoholic beer.  And ordered two beers, Baltika 7 ($6) and Baltika 9 ($6.50).  Then two soups, Borsch ($5.95) a beet/beef and Solyanka ($8.95) a tomato/meats/sour cream.  Both were delicious but most of the table favored the Solyanka. Next was three appetizers:  Blinchiki Mushrooms ($6.95) crepes stuffed with mushrooms, Vareniki Potatoes ($5.95) dumplings stuffed with potatoes, and Julien ($6.95) mushrooms baked in a cream sauce with cheese.   All three were delicious and tasted very fresh made.  For the entre we ordered Beef Stroganoff and Schnitzel.  The Stroganoff is not made the American way with noodles.  It's pure beef, mushrooms and onions in a dark sauce.  Excellent!  But the Schnitzel was the favorite for everyone.  It's a pork cutlet lightly breaded, soooo tender and served with deliciously spiced skillet vegetables.  For dessert we tried Praga cake ($6.95) and Napoleon cake ($6.95) which tastes like cheese cake layered with puff pastry.  My son loved the Napoleon cake and almost ate the whole thing.  I don't know what authentic Russian food is suppose to taste like, but everyone liked what we received.

Our total bill was $112 with $25 coupon, so we paid $88 plus a $22 tip.

Service from our waitress Ludmila was excellent - 5 star
Food was very good - 5 star

The waitress appeared to be very occupied on a tablet - it took about 10 minutes for her to look up and finally seat us. The door was open - I remember tiny flies biting on my legs. It would've been better at night, but we both had plans.

Anyways, the food... Stuffed cabbage was quite good - I loooove cabbage. It came with an exceptional tomato-based sauce. In a world of many tomato-based sauces, this one stood out. I ordered lamb skewers. My friend ordered the schnitzel. The lamb came out a bit too dry, overcooked, whatever. The marinade was lacking as well. I regret ordering that. At first, the mashed potatoes looked questionable, but man, they were perfect - goosebumps good. The schnitzel was done as you'd expect. 

The waitress more than made up for her prior inattentiveness. She was very friendly and personable, always checking on our drinks, very quick on her feet - both I and my friend thought she might have done gymnastics. Witty and pleasant, with both our table and the Russian couple's.

While not near the casinos, it's definitely worth the ride. We started with a traditional berry juice, tasty and sweet with mixed berry flavor not sugar. Stuffed cabbage rolls with a meat filling could have been dinner for a small child- 4 to a plate covered with a delicious sauce and sour cream. Our other appetizer was a bowl of small raviolis in a buttery herb sauce. Again, they tasted homemade.  The small Russian salad of chopped up tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, radishes and another veggie or two with a light vinaigrette dressing cleared our palate for the borsht (beet and other veggies) soup. Light with enough beet to taste its special flavor but not so much as to overpower the other flavors.  We opted for traditional stroganoff and goulash as our entrees. The beef stroganoff captured the earthy flavor of the mushroom and onion base and kicked it up a notch with the tender strips of beef. Usually the sauce is made too rich with sour cream added in; this was light and flavorful.The goulash was a stew with carrots, potatoes, and chucks of meat. All melt in your mouth.  While we declined to try the honey cake, our chocolate cake was a true European version. Rich and dark but not sugary, the filling was a custard and the frosting more like a thin layer of fudge, just enough contrast to enjoy the tastes and texture mixes. A memorable experience and one I would return for again.",7L-k3pywA118Rt5c-SzVBw,0,0,5,TBARV9BbWvZexdZnXeuDNw

I was able to meet up with some wonderful people here to try Russian food.  We were lucky enough to have someone with Russian decent to inform us on the various options and what to expect.  The dining area is very clean and open. There was a tv playing 'adult' viewing so I would not recommend bringing a family into this establishment. 

Service here started off good but then trailed off. We had ordered appetizers and at that time were still deciding on entrees.  Our waiter really wanted us to order right away and take the menus.  After our appetizers were finished,  we had to wave him down to place the entree order and also later to pay the bill.  I wasn't impressed.  

Now regarding the food~  The Hot appetizers were wonderful.  I loved the Julien which was mushrooms and a cream sauce.  It wasn't overly heavy but still had a fantastic flavor.  The Golubtshy was also a very flavorful cabbage roll stuffed with beef. The cold appetizer of herring was ok.  It was very very salty but the potatoes which accompanied it were simple and delicious.  The  Stolichniy was also a good cold appetizer.  Its a version of potato salad with a distinct dill flavor. My entree, the Shashlik Lamb, was ok.  Simple but overcooked and very tough to eat.  The mashed potatoes which accompanied it were good but I was hoping more from the Lamb.

Location is close to the Strip, convenient to locals and foreign tourists alike. I'm really hoping they succeed, as most of their food can't be found elsewhere!

Menu offers several hot and cold appetizers, get several for the table to try.
HERRING: cold app served with potatoes, hardboiled egg, dill, and onion. So fresh, so tasty, must-order. $9
MAMALIGUTA: a peasant dish made of corn polenta, Russian feta, and sour cream. Odd but complementary combination of flavors and textures. $7
JULIEN: baked mushrooms in cream sauce, topped with cheese. This mixture is available in other dishes/apps and is a large part of Russian cuisine. $8
SOLYANKA: the other famous Russian soup, packed with sausage. Borscht is also available of course but I generally prefer this one.

Entree options include traditional stroganoff and chicken kiev, as well as representative dishes from other nearby cultures: Hungarian goulash, Viennese schnitzel. 
SHASHLIK: grilled pork, beef, or lamb served with a tasty tomato-based house sauce. Cooked to your preferred doneness, ample sharing portion. $16

Dessert: there are a few dessert options, but this place is known for their ""honey cake"" (AKA Napoleon cake), a creamy puff-pastry concoction that I don't usually like- though I have not had the version served here. Opted instead for the ZAPAKANKA: Similar to a baked cheesecake and served with whipped cream and cherries, this is a traditional dish that American sugar enthusiasts may find on the bland side. The delicate cake is not sweet and dense but light and airy instead.

I have not yet tried the entire menu, but I'm impressed enough to give five stars and be tentatively planning a UYE here- they also have a bar and a karaoke stage, and will eventually be open tip 4AM for crazy European dance parties!

EDIT: Dropping my star rating. Had the aforementioned UYE here, after making email reservations directly with the owner. Despite bringing in a group and making a personal connection with the owner, service was slow and disinterested and food was a drop in quality. I was embarrassed and disappointed to have raved about this spot prior to bringing other Yelp Elites. Also, they were playing softcore porn during our meal, WTF?!

My aunt and uncle had the beef stroganoff. The meat was finely chopped into the sauce, which at first was confusing because we are used to cubed beef in a stroganoff. However, once you start eating, your taste buds reward you for trusting the chef. Delicious, and the better of the two meals.

The pickled herring with potatoes and eggs were good. It has to be my favorite at this time. The beef tongue was tender but needed a little salt.  Prices are also affordable...
It has been a while since I've had this that it's hard to make comparisons... I would recommend it for a new taste experience for those who have not had Russian dishes.

2887726,2015-01-24,3,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"We chose on a whim to reunite with an old favorite of ours.  Russian.  We wanted Russian grub.  With warm tastebuded memories of an old dear restaurant we used to dine 12 years ago on the Westside, Mayakovsky capitalized on this wanton desire.  

Located at the southern corner of what used to be the Liberace Museum.  The location is kind of a counter culture shock for some.  It is a unique place to get your taste of commie cuisine.  I try.  In any case the place is pretty cool inside.  Dark and somewhat cold, the atmosphere really takes me to places I thought it would feel like in the urban sickle & hammer streets.

Our host was a very welcoming sweet gal.  Our server for the evening was a friendly gentleman who was engaging and had a pinch of Putin to him.  I have to say if this is your first time trying Russian food he would be perfect to guide you through it.  They are willing to divulge any information regarding the menu with out interrogation.  We are no rookies though.

The entrees consist of a well prepared protein surrounded by potatoes mashed, pan fried or fries and a vegetable.  As we were used to they would have been steamed or raw vegetables, yet at Mayakovsky it is a cole-slaw-esque salad instead.  We were informed real Russians eat their potatoes mashed!  So, when in Moscow.. 

We started with the red caviar.  A traditional plate of plain crepes with butter and salmon roe.  Think of it as a salty Russian jam of sorts.  Definitely not in Kansas anymore Toto.  As always I would suggest ordering one shot of the premium vodka that I couldn't pronounce properly and take it just before you dive into the appetizer.  Soft and sea flavoured I know this is not for everyone, but there's a reason you didn't choose to go Dennys right?

Her entree was the Chicken Kiev.  A rolled and breaded tube of poultry goodness.  I suggest slicing it in inches and slanting it for a nice presentation.  It's like a non pansy le cordon bleu.  She wanted the pan fried potatoes but she was served fries.  She did like the fries though.  I suppose it's what our soviet cousins think us 'Mericans would've chosen, lol.

I had the encrusted trout.  Which was almost a whole trout minus the head.  This was my very first trout!  Being of Micronesian decent I usually order more exotic saltwater variety.  I loved it.  Crispy skinned and tender fillets.  I ate the whole fish with my manly mashed potatoes.  

For dessert we asked for the Napoleon cake.  Which came out exactly 1.5 minutes after asking for it.  Powdered sugar and 2 forks to share.  If I may suggest, do ask for a knife.  Its a like a puff pastry and a cheesecake sharing equal provided plate space.  So good!

At the end I dropped the missile on our waiter about the Yelp $20 for $10 deal that I had purchased as soon as I checked in and was seated.  A great 3 course meal for under 50 bucks before leaving a 20% tip (I'm a 20% tipper) I was more than satisfied.  A good meal with great authentic ruskie service.

I knew what I wanted as soon as I saw that there was a Russian restaurant nearby - varenyky and borscht. Both were delicious. I got the potato varenyky, which were seasoned with dill, and served with sour cream and caramelized onion. Though I tend to like exponentially more of both, the plate was  artfully arranged, and I enjoyed the varenyky very much. The borscht was also tasty - hearty, with not too much meat, which is a good thing in my book. The bread our server brought was excellent dipped in the borscht. I ate until I couldn't fit another bite, and was sad I couldn't finish it all!

Initially, my boyfriend was not terribly enthusiastic about my choice in cuisine, but he ended up really enjoying his pork shashlik. It came with a flavorful sauce reminiscent of salsa, which nicely complemented the seasoning of the pork. 

We also ordered one of each of the piroshki - beef, cabbage, and potato. We enjoyed all three. The beef looked unassuming, but had a nice flavor and consistency. The potato filling was full of dill, like the varenyky. The cabbage was my favorite, though I wasn't able to put my finger on what it was seasoned with. 

For drinks, we both got iced tea, which I cannot recommend highly enough! It was so good!

My friend who is Russian came here with her family and she ordered a bunch of dishes for us to share. There were 3 people in the party and we got full pretty fast. We were given bread rolls with butter when we sat down. We ordered the cabbage rolls, the cottage cheese crepes, marinated mushrooms, beef stroganoff, and lamb kabobs. Our appetizers came out first. There were 3 small cabbage rolls, 2 crepes and a good amount of mushrooms. The cottage cheese crepes were surprisingly good! They were a little sweet, and the crepe was soft. The cabbage rolls had a good amount of meat but were kind of small and they definitely need to give a spoon with that dish so the sauce could be scooped out. The marinated mushrooms were fresh, and marinated with vinegar but the vinegar wasn't overwhelming. The lamb kabobs are THE BEST LAMB KABOBS I HAVE EVER HAD. It was a little tough, but seasoned well, cooked perfectly and didn't have a weird aftertaste. The only bad dish was the beef stroganoff, which we had to send back because it was wayyyy too salty. It took them a while to remake the dish but it was much better. 

Our bill was around $54. Make sure you check groupon! They have a $20 voucher for only $10!! After the groupon was applied, it was only $34.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,4,2,4,lCYbyPH992odaHbz0TyOsA

-I love perozki and have been jonesing since leaving California--have loved pierogis in New York even more. However-----what arrived was *literally* 2 large brown dinner rolls made of bread---wtf?---no delicious dumplings with a drizzle of sour cream anywhere in sight!  One of these thick dinner rolls contained somewhat flavorful potato and the other what tasted to be boiled minced meat.  Both were SO dry I couldn't eat more than half of the potato and 1 bite of the meat. These were NOT perozki----and did not even look anything like photos on review sites like this one.
- Praga Cake was NOT a proper Praga Cake. More like chocolate *bread* with 3 layers.  It was bizarre. There's a very specific butter cream associated with Praga Cake and it was nowhere to be found. Instead a sickly sweet artificial chocolate tasting gummy mousse between layers. Tasted like a supermarket ""bakery"" product, although it was clearly made there. Just not done well, or right. Ate about 1/2 of it and felt ill---way too syrupy, and too much almond extract (which isn't even part of the recipe).
- Beef Stroganoff: NOT a proper stroganoff. The mushrooms were good, but sadly, the sauce was C+ and no better--bland and salty. The beef was not the delicious sliced beef you expect from a stroganoff--but that same dry boiled minced beef that was in the faux-perozki. The mashed potatoes, however, were delicious!

3279242,2015-12-30,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"I was craving Russian food while on vacation on the strip and found this place on Yelp. It's a bit of a drive from the strip and rather hard to find, but I thought it was worth the ride, especially since I was in the mood for some Russian pelmeni! 

The service was outstanding, really - from the waitress, who was understanding, accommodating and pleasant to the fullest extent, to the owner who stopped by and greeted us. Everyone was amazingly nice and added to our experience here.

The food was mediocre, not the best Russian food I have had, which was a bit disappointing. We got the Julien, which was nice and probably one of the better dishes we had. I thought it could use a bit more cheese and would have been nicer if it was a little hotter, with the cheese fully melted. 

We also had the Pelmeni - it was great, could use a little bit more salt and flavor, and I wish they had it as an entreé on its own instead of just as an appetizer. I generally like my pelmeni in a soup, in a large bowl as the main dish of my meal.
 
The borsch was so so, it was a bit lukewarm, lacked salt and seemed to be a bit overcooked since the cabbage slices melted in my mouth - it's usually better when they're a bit crunchier and feel freshly made. The cubed meat inside the borsch took me by surprise, I would rather have a bone cut as is done traditionally.

The pirozki were ok; I thought the bread was too much for the amount of meat and potatoes. The dough and the stuffing could have been a bit saltier as well. 

The napoleon could have been much better. The trick that I have seen other chefs use is to make it to order, that is, put the custard and the layers together right before serving the napoleon. This adds just enough crunch to the cake and keeps the custard light. The one I had was clearly made some time ago and the custard was dehydrated and dry. 

That said, I will probably be back on my next visit, I would like to try some of their entrees, namely the beef stroganoff and the shashlik.",uSpr7yFI9Ios9ojeytTxfg,3,0,3,V-F3IDI6TYS6AdlGhPteNA

Mayakovsky is located in eastside Vegas in an unassuming shopping complex.  I came at about 8pm on a Saturday and it was literally empty except for a couple sitting in a booth.  They had a stage for supposed musical acts and about 60 seats in the restaurant, but clearly Saturday night was not their busy time.

I came because I found a Groupon for $10 off and found the reviews to be quite good.  We tried the skewered chicken, goulash, and pierogis.  The goulash and chicken were served in the same format of the meat accompanied with mashed potatoes, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  Both dishes were very average in my opinion.  I have never been to Russia so have no idea about the authenticity, but I always envision goulash the Eastern European way - in soup form.  But these dishes were exactly the same just different meat/sauce, similar to how Thai and Chinese restaurants have very similar accompaniments and then just plant a different meat on the top.  But I do have rave reviews for the pierogis which were exceptional, filled with mashed potatoes and onion and lightly covered in sour cream.  

The prices were very fair with the 3 dishes coming to about $23 and were filling for a meal.  They have a full bar and I expect their vodka selection to be top notch but we didn't drink while there.  I do enjoy this type of cuisine every once in a while, but I thought the meals were too neat and repetitive rather than imaginary.

Mayakovsky is located in a rather abandoned-looking plaza, but looks very trendy on the inside. There is a small stage, several booths, tables, and a big bar in here that all contribute to a rather welcoming atmosphere. 

Our waitress was extremely welcoming and attentive and immediately brought us water and menus when we sat down. The only Russian food I'd eaten so far had been in Germany, so I was excited to see if this restaurant would have any American influences in its food. Sure enough, New York Steak, and Ribeye were options on the menu. Not that that's a bad thing! For something more authentically Russian, I ordered the Blinchiki as an appetizer and the Chicken Kiev as my main entrée. My friend got the Beef Stroganoff, which was juicy and all around delightful. 

The service was impeccable throughout our meal. Whenever our server wasn't at our table, she was polishing glasses at the bar while keeping an eye on us. She was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes served and could describe in detail how they are prepared. 
We finished the meal with honey cake. It was a little bit too sweet for my taste, but I could see the effort that had gone into each of its many layers.

This has been a bookmark for quite sometime.  After a play at UNLV, I went here for an early dinner to try their Russian fare.

There were two customers when I arrived and when they left, I was the sole diner.  I had looked over the menu at home so I had some idea of what I'd order.

I got a small bowl of borsch to start and the katleti with chicken for the main course.  I finished the meal with a piece of Napoleon cake.

The server, Ludmila, brought my iced tea as I looked at the menu.  When she brought the borsch, she asked if I wanted bread and I answered just one piece.  She brought me a single roll which was just perfect.  The borsch is made with beet root and there were cubes of potato and small carrots in the soup.  It was quite hot and it tasted very good.  Katleti comes either in beef or chicken.  I got chicken.  It's ground chicken formed into a cutlet shape and fried.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and the meat was very juicy.  With the dish, there were two small scoops of lukewarm mashed potatoes and some sliced cucumber and tomato.

I was disappointed when I ordered dessert because some reviews say the honey cake is a must get.  They didn't have that.  I don't know if it's gone although it's still on the menu.

4108163,2015-01-24,14,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"A positive introduction to Russian food for me.

Stefany V. invited folks to try this relatively unknown dining establishment in a very nondescript plaza on Tropicana and Spencer, and a few of us managed to find time to join her on a Friday night. Luckily for us newbies, she knows a guy with a nice sense of humor and a knowledge of Russian foods. He talked about how Russian cuisine strongly favors the use of mushrooms, potatoes, and dill. I would later learn that he was correct.

I was happy with all of the appetizers that we shared. The herring ($5.95) was delicate and balanced, and it was served cold with onion, dill, a sliced hard-boiled egg, and boiled-yet-not-bland potatoes. The cold beef tongue ($5.95) was tender but a bit boring, even with the horseradish. Our Russian was definitely impressed though. The ""Stolichniy"" ($6.95) salad was apparently misnamed, not that I would have known or even know still what the correct name is. Regardless, it was a tasty chicken potato salad, topped of course with dill. The Julien ($7.95) contained deliciously soft mushrooms baked in a not-too-rich sour cream and cheese sauce. The Golubtsy ($6.95) was probably my favorite, with delicious and moist ground beef and pork stuffed into soft cabbage rolls, which were topped with sour cream.

My entree of choice was lamb shashlik ($14.95), a variation on kabob. As with seemingly all of the other entrees, it was served with a slaw and with two scoops of mashed potatoes topped with, you guessed it, dill. Unlike the others, it also was accompanied by a sauce that very much resembled a tomato salsa. I did enjoy the meat's flavor, and the salsa grew on me as the meal progressed. The potato was solid as well and the slaw a welcome textural complement. My one issue was that it seemed a bit dry as a result of how they cooked it, which is partially my fault for not asking about meat temperature, but also a service issue in that they didn't ask if I wanted it cooked to the default medium-well.

While I wasn't impressed with my entree (and neither were those who ordered Chicken Kiev and Beef Stroganoff, which hopefully they'll elaborate on), I'll strongly consider returning because of the strength of the smaller plates and because I haven't tried their soups. Who knows, maybe better bites might be found in something traditionally associated with other cultures, such as goulash, schnitzel, or even pizza.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,21,19,4,HaU9YNx1R9N_6G9XCUF0Ng
4147596,2015-01-26,5,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"This past Friday night was Yelp night at Cafe Mayakovsky as five of us Yelpers came together for Stefany V's first UYE.  The evening was due to begin at 7:00 and so I arrived early as is my normal course of action.  I was one of two who arrived too early and we were seated right away in a rather quiet restaurant.  There were maybe only two other parties there at the time.  Soon we were joined by Stefany and the rest.  With her was Boris who is from where these treats originate so he was a big help in explaning the menu.  Based on his descriptions we decided on several appetizers to order and share.  

We got beef tongue with horse radish, cold herring with potatoes and boiled egg topped with onion and dill, cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and topped with a sour cream sauce, a sort of potato and chicken salad and a mushroom and cheese dish.  Everything was brought out one at a time which lended plenty of time to tasting each individually without feeling too rushed.  I started with the herring.  I can say quite honestly this was my least favorite app but only for the simple fact that I don't care for fish.  But I did try it and found it to be salty and fishy.  It was about what I expected.  The potato and egg on the side were fine.  On to the tongue, I've had tongue once or twice before but only in small bites.  This was a whole slice and I did not know fully what to expect.  It turned out to be delicious.  It tastes very much like pot roast just minus the gravy.  If I was a fan of horse radish I would have used some of that on the tongue. I stuck with plain.  Next I tried the salad.  It was alright but nothing special.  Just potato salad with some chicken.  What I was most excited about might have been my favorite dish of the evening.  The cabbage rolls.  I had never tried Russian style and the sour cream sauce was a welcome difference to the usual tomato based sauce I am used to.  I love sour cream.  The cabbage itself was ultra tender and the meat moist and tender.  Sometimes the meat inside a cabbage roll can get dry and firm.  Not the case here.  Finally I tried the mushroom dish.  We got two little stainless steel measuring cup looking bowls filled with this sour cream and cheese sauce with mushroom bits.  I spooned a little onto my plate and enjoyed the creamy mushroomy goodness.  A close second to the cabbage rolls in my book.  Did I mention I love sour cream.

After we finished our shared appetizers we were on to ordering our entrees.  I ordered chicken Kiev.  Two at our table ordered lamb shashlik.  Stefany and Boris ordered stroganoff.  I saw some sort of ravioli dumpling dish too.  That looked good whatever it was.  I didn't hear them order.  When our food arrived, it all looked great.  The reality told a different story.  I think we were all less than impressed.  My Kiev was dry and over cooked.  The chicken was difficult to cut even with a knife.  And there was no gush of melted butter like I know Kiev to have.  Infact, I could hardly tell there was ever any butter in there at all.  If there had been then maybe the chicken would have been more moist.  The mashed potatoes on the side were flavorful but dense.  The cole slaw on the side was bland.  I was told the lamb shashlik had good flavor but was over cooked.  And that the stroganoff was lacking seasoning.  The first that that was said is that it needed salt.  A swing and a miss on entrees tonight.

With my meal I wanted to try a Russian beer.  I ordered a Baltica 9 which is classified as a dark lager.  It was hardly dark.  Slightly darker than a Budweiser I would estimate.  The alcohol content was consideralbly higher though.  I think 8% in this 25 oz. bottle.  The higher alcohol content gave the beer a slightly sweet taste.  Overall not a bad beer.  I would have liked it better colder.  Ales are OK on the warmer side but I like my lagers chilled.

I'm glad I got to try Cafe Mayakovsky this one time.  Even if I wasn't highly impressed.  Company was awesome.  Appetizers were good.  And now I have a story to tell.

I highly recommend the herring dish which was a delicious surprise; the combination of flavors and textures is just outstanding. The herring is super soft and just melts in your mouth. 

I had the beef stroganoff as my entree, the gravy sauce is very savory and the side Russian salad is 100% fresh! All the breads and dumplings are made in-house and you can really taste the freshness. We finished things off with a Napoleon cake & honey cake which were amazing. Would definitely come back here for dinner & to check out their nighttime parties & shows.

4484775,2017-08-09,3,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"I am no stranger to Russian food, having lived a stone's throw from Little Odessa, the area of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn that's home to world class Russian restaurants and nightclubs.  I've been to these places many times, attended parties thrown by Russian friends, and even an over-the-top birthday party for a one-year-old, complete with kid in tuxedo and 9-piece orchestra.  Those Russians all dress to the nines, and know how to do it up right.  I've also had a fabulous couple of meals at a small, non-descript Russian restaurant in L.A., Robert's, where no one got dressed up and there was no entertainment other than the fabulous food.

Cafe Mayakovsky, which has been on my bookmark list forever, finally became a reality when we were on that side of town after dropping off the kids at the airport.  It's located in an eerily dilapidated strip mall and it's not a large place, but 90% was occupied by one of those huge Russian parties.  

It's a fun place to observe.  The music was a combination of a talented singer and canned music when she was on break.  I loved the music.  Unfortunately, it was ear-shattering.  I swear, the world has gone deaf because of the constant noise exposure and no one can hear anything anymore.  The ladies were all dressed up and the dancing was endless.  

But the food should be the star, and in my book the dining experience wasn't so stellar.  First, I ordered a glass of sparkling wine from the wine list, where it was listed by the glass.  Our waiter, who was inexplicably a Russian-speaking Korean, said they only had it by the bottle.  The only other white by the glass was chardonnay, which I don't like.  To their credit, they let me have the glass of wine.

We started with Perozhok, with cabbage.  There was only one bun and it was okay, but nothing special.  I was surprised that there was only one of them; I guess for the price I shouldn't have expected more, but the menu should have said it was ""per piece.""

We shared an order of Vareniki with potatoes and onion.  It looked better than it tasted, not bad, but just ordinary.  And it was the same with our main courses:  katleti with chicken, my husband's choice, was bland, and my beef stroganoff was not only bland and gloppy, but was served with rice, instead of the noodles I'd expected.

I started this review by giving it 3 stars, but after re-reading what I wrote, I realized that it would have been worth three if that meant ""Okay,"" instead of ""A-Okay."" That ""A"" made a big difference.  I definitely have experienced better.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,11,4,2,5FT30UEwvrZZdDOMnL9hAg

4629572,2015-06-09,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"""What is Russian food?""  

That is how our conversation began when we were trying to decide where to eat tonight.  I wasn't really sure.  I took two semesters of Russian in college, but beyond some pretty vague ideas of what was Borscht or Kasha I didn't even really know what to say.  We decided to at least drop by and check out the place.  The first thing I will say is to not be put off by the exterior.  The neighborhood seems a bit run down but once you walk through the front door you are transported to a world 50 years ago.  Wooden floors, half booths, and several tables for two in the dining area surrounded a small stage where they have live performances on the weekends.  The bar area is classy as well but none of it is pretentious.

We were greeted by our host.  I forgot to get his name and I am kicking myself for it.  He provided the best restaurant experience I've ever had (Previously Old School Pizza also here in Las Vegas).  I even hesitate to call him a host or a waiter.  Almost a professional dining assistant.  The advice we got on appetizers, drinks, and the meal was what one would expect at the type of restaurant people like me don't get in to.  So finally to the food.

We ordered a round of Baltika 3 and 7 for drinks and we each had the borscht, even the guy at our table that is a self-proclaimed beet hater decided to try it.  If it had been socially acceptable we would have licked our bowls clean.  I attempted to make borscht once from an internet recipe and it tasted like potatoes, beets, cabbage, beef and dill all in a bowl together.  What this gentlemen brought out was something that took on it's own nature.  I could find the buttery sweetness of the beets if I really concentrated on it and the beef flavor was there too but really the flavors all balanced together so that none of them stuck out over the other.  I haven't tasted anything like it before.  After the soup we had the red caviar and vareniki with potatoes and onions.  I've never had caviar before so I can't compare it to anything but I certainly enjoyed it.  Briny fishy flavor pods that burst in your mouth on top of crepes and butter.  I may have developed a new expensive habit.  The vareniki was also wonderful.  Almost like pirogi.

He recommended the lamb shashlik for me.  I love lamb and this reinforced my love of the meat.  Nicely marinaded with a good strong lamb flavor that wasn't overdone.  I'm not even sure what the sauce was that was served on the side but it complemented the meal wonderfully.  The other guys at the table ordered the stroganoff and the chicken tabaka.  The both said that their meals were wonderful as well.  We finished the dinner off with a turkish coffee and encouragement to return on the weekend for the live music.  If I get a vote I'll be going back to get some of that stroganoff!

So what is Russian food?  Russian food is the southern home cooking of a hearty people.  It's the food that gets you through a strong winter and can stand up to a bottle of Vodka.  It's food that takes the absolute basic ingredients and combines them to create flavors you have probably never tasted before.  If you are in Vegas and you don't try this restaurant at least once you are doing yourself a disservice.  You'll spend more at a chain restaurant than you will here and it will not be the memorable experience that this definitely will be.  I can not recommend it highly enough.",2z7zF1x0yt_vR5aZKVE6GA,2,1,5,T5gwdQBy3OWiLNE8DssIxg

Food - we always order soup - borsch and solyanka are very good. Solyanka is a little bit pricy but it worth it. Soup lapsha - chicken noodle was nothing spectacular, but still good. 
Appetizers - we ordered pelmeni with sour cream. They were meaty and good. My husband got Golubtsy and they have a lot of meat too, both of them were very tasty. 
As a main dish we had Kiev and shashik. I don`t like potato so I got Lamb shashlik with rice. It was very tender and yes, well cooked. I like my meat to be well done so I guess if you are a big fan of raw meat you have to ask them to make it according to your taste. 
I have a sweet tooth so I always go for desert - Napoleon is one of my favorite. Honey cake and Praga cake I didn`t like, but Napoleon was the best for me. My daughter like their mors - it`s like lingberry juice. And we like Velvet beer- kind of amber - not too dark and not too strong.

I had looked for a Russian restaurant before and remember reading about Cafe Mayakovsky. I decided to finally go check it out and I was so glad I did. 

There was plenty of parking as another Yelper mentioned this strip mall was where the Liberace Museum used to be. The restaurant is now next to an adult day care and other mixed businesses. As I walked in, there was a young lady signing live on stage! She had a really good voice and it was like a Russian pop song. How Fun! My waiter was a young gentleman who was very knowledgeable in the menu and was very professional. He told me they started to hsve live music on Friday, Saturday and Sunday as it is usually busier on the weekends.  Though it seemed a little empty when I walked in, the place got busy and people were coming in for dinner and drinks really quick. 

The waiter recommended the Chicken Kieve, so I went with that for my main entree. I also got a shot of Stolichnaya and a glass of champagne. I also got the pickled vegetable plate for my cold appetizer and the Vareniki stuffed with a potatoes filling for my hot appetizer. I really liked the pickled mushrooms and the pickled cabbage. It was almost like a slaw, but without the mayo. The brightness of the pickled vegtsbke cut through the savory Vareniki. I really liked both appetizers. For the entree, the Chicken Kiev came out piping hot and smelled delicious. It came with a side of mashed potatoes garnished with some fresh chopped parsley. The chicken had a good crunchy crust and the chicken was tasty. The potatoes were good too and I continued to enjoy my meal with the pickled veggies. The waiter continued to check on me and made sure I was enjoying my food. So nice! The singer when not signing would play other Russian -(I would say like Top 40 songs?) which would add to the atmosphere. For dessert, I opted for the Turkish coffee, which the waiter explained is like a stronger coffee and there is a boiling process so the grounds are at the bottom if the cup. Went with a slice of honey cake as well. Turkish coffee was strong, but not bitter. Honey Cake was good and went well with the coffee. All in all, I am so happy I came in and tried this place out. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was fun with the music, but not too loud so you can still enjoy your dinner and the food was good. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes and if you haven't had Rusian food before this a great spot to start. They are happy to answer any questions and are so nice.

We also had a pitcher of Russian tradition drink called Mors - a must have.
Appetizers: Russian salad was very fresh. Not too much dressing but tasted great. Stolichniy salad was good too. Must have apps are Blinchiki - these are melting in your mouth crepes. I loved ones with mushrooms. Ones with Cheese were great, were slightly sweeter. I was happy with my veg choices: Golubtsy, which was baked mushroom and cheese dish. Vareniki potatoes, dumplings filled with  potatoes and sauté onions on top. Side of sauté vegetables and potatoes made a good pairing. 
My friends had meat entrees like stroganoff, chicken Kiev, katleti chicken and they were happy with their choices.
Our server was pleasant and attentive. The owner also visited our table 2-3 times to make recommendations. 
Ambiance was casual. There was a group on a side playing chess. There was a small stage on the side, suggesting the place would be much more lively with live music on the weekends.
Overall, a great evening with great food and great service!",f_raNSKjAEjMO4D-zA1kZQ,1,1,5,VZd4q7s4DzQqPtUIHO5ftw
4909412,2016-07-23,1,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"Came here yesterday night around 9pm, the place was empty.  Never tried Russian food before, so everything we ordered was completely new to me. For appetizers we ordered the beef tongue and the ravioli. The beef tongue was THE bomb. It comes with a side of horseradish which surprisingly went really well with the tongue. Never would think to combine tongue with horseradish, but hey it works and we devoured that in secs. The tongue was served room temperature was very tender and thinly sliced, not cold at all, which is awesome. This was my favorite dish of the night. 

Next was the ravioli with a dollop of sour cream on top. That's the first I've seen that, who puts sour cream on ravioli? Well it was delicious. Ravioli was plump, the meat filling is savory and juicy, and the sour cream just makes everything creamy and rich. It's definitely the best ravioli I've ever had. Who knew ravioli could taste this good?

For our entrees, we ordered the beef stroganoff and grilled meat kabobs. The beef stroganoff was a thick, savory gravy sauce packed with a ton of beef and mushrooms. It was served with a side of mashed potatoes. It was yummy too lol. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it which was a shame. 

For dessert, we shared the napoleon cake. This was a big surprise, it was soft, moist, creamy and not super sweet at all. In fact,  it reminds me of something you can get from a French Asian bakery. I love the layers of cream, cake, and pastry. 

We also wanted to try out the two Russian non alcholic drinks. I loved the wild berry one, it was so freaking good! It was like a juice that was sweet, fruity, and tart. It sort of reminded me of acai, but better! The other Russian drink, it was carbonated, and had a very distinct taste. Almost medicinal haha, didn't like it all that much.

Overall, I was super impressed. I would definitely come back here again. If you want to try something different, this is the place to go.",bBxm5CRxNuj1EJpQ4Go0bA,6,3,5,bLCEJGP7jOD_mvLL_NvaBQ
4934701,2017-04-11,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"Russian food!  Love to try new things and the food here is pretty good. 

1.  The strip mall- located in the former Liberace Museum place, this mall is dilapidated and almost a deserted blighted area.  Of course it has plenty of parking, but it does nothing for the overall experience and ambiance. 

2.  The restaurant-  I have only had Russian food in Moscow and when I first went in the late 80's, there was a certain lack of service and attention to detail. Of course things have changed dramatically, however Cafe Mayakovsky has a certain focus on getting things done vs creating a great experience. 

3.  Service-  overall good and friendly. 

4.  The party- they were having a huge party setting up while we were here so the whole dining area was a mess. Tables were piled with stuff and most tables were positioned for the party. Our reservation had a table off to the side, we felt completely disjointed based on how everyone was more focused on the party set up. 

5.  The food-  

We started to order a bottle of wine but then when we decided on the Herring appetizer, we all know vodka and herring mix well. So we got a bottle of Russian Standard Vodka!  Great stuff for sure and recommended by our waiter. 

The appetizers of herring, pickled platter, blinchiki and Vareniki were great.  The blinchiki was a crepe filled with ground beef and we enjoyed this very much.  Toasted and fried on outside, juicy and tender on inside. 

The Vareniki is a dumpling and ours was filled with potatoes. Loved it and would order this again. 

For main courses our table had  Borsch soup!  Not bad, had better. We had a Chicken Kiev,  wow was it huge. Beef stroganoff, a full platter and a Rack of lamb which was a special- a great choice.  All of this was  just right and we finished everything. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Dessert- we shared a Praga cake, chocolate and perfect. We also had the honey cake.  Both were wonderful and absolutely a great find.  Turkish coffee was outstanding. Not too bitter and not too muddy. I enjoyed it. 

Very good food, friendly service. Why the three star,  a really odd ambiance, location and party set up that leaves you a feeling of either being rushed or not fitting in.  This greatly affected an otherwise excellent 4 star place. 

Will try this again in future. To see if the ambiance is different.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,9,2,3,48gz333H3Hc3iartOZz9qQ

4960356,2016-09-16,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"I had eaten at this place when they were in the old location over on West Flamingo. But they have changed names and relocated to the old Liberace Museum plaza, specifically the southeast corner. This was part of the property that was once the Carluccio's Italian restaurant.

The only issue I had with my visit was that I arrived at around 11:30AM and the door was locked and not looking too lively (they are supposed to be open at 11). Apparently they do not do a lot of business in the morning hours and did not find it necessary to be opened that early; I am not sure exactly why this was. But the bus boy/waiter showed up outside the door and told us that they would be opening; we were inside the restaurant minutes later. Had he not showed up so quickly I probably would have been gone before the official opening. But again, this was the ONLY problem I had with the visit.

The dining room is a little on the dark side, with the walls decorated with assorted Russian art and posters,, and a large landscape-style photo of Russian streets and the like. It is a very intimate looking locale, but never comes off as the kind of ""high class"" that will alienate average joes. There is a definite sense of ambience here, in the best of ways. A TV in the bar area can be seen from throughout the restaurant, and there is foreign (presumably Russian) music playing over the speakers. The place definitely has atmosphere.

Before long my mother and I were waited on; I ordered the Chicken Kiev and she ordered the Beef Stroganoff. We were given bread with butter while we waited, which was a nice touch.

When the food arrived, it absolutely did not disappoint. The Chicken Kiev had a solid outer layer of breading packed with flavor, and the garlic butter inside only added to the experience. I tried mom's Beef Stroganoff. And I tried it again. And again. And again. It had a very distinct flavor that is difficult to describe, but unique and delicious. The entrees were also served with mashed potatoes, which were very good as well. I only briefly perused the rest of the menu, but will absolutely return to try some of the other Russian cuisine offered.

Curiously no one else ever came in the restaurant the whole time we were there; they must make all of their money on dinner service. I do not see why it was empty; this food was to die for.

Cafe Mayakovsky is a great place to eat, and the location is easy to find. I look forward to my next visit. Even if you have never had Russian food before, I have no doubt you will be able to find something on the menu that will suit your tastes.

The cheesiness of this place was actually really endearing and quaint. Soon we got to the appetizer round: boyarski platter, vareniki, pirozhki, herring - all very very good. Some of my less adventurous colleagues balked at the tongue but it was perfectly done and tasted wonderful with some fresh horseradish. The borscht was yummy - just like grandma used to make. The entrees were humbly done, meat and potatoes but all tasty and prepared with care. My only disappointment was the lack of flavored / infused vodkas that typically accompany Russian cuisine so we had to resort to just plain vodka. 
Overall a neat departure from typical overpriced strip chains or semi-celebrity owned hack kitchens. Finding a family owned gem that cares about good food in friendly welcoming atmosphere is rare these days so I'm looking forward to coming back in the summer with family for some dumplings and stroganoff!!",9L_1hC-DJJ4Uyy3n5Xc2FQ,0,0,4,F95RVMn-6h1OKj7mm5wwtA

5005983,2018-03-26,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"Three major complaints to make this place only a 3 star review.

1) There was MSG in the food. I think they used powdered soup base which is basically flavored MSG. It was in at least two of the dishes, the soup and the meat patties. They could have used the stuff in more dishes because soup base is versatile and will enhance the flavor of almost anything.

We started to suffer from thirst, swollen hands and feet, and drowsiness after about half an hour after leaving the restaurant. If you're sensitive to MSG, you'll want avoid this place or ask to make sure MSG or soup base wasn't used in any dish you're considering.

2) The prices on the menu didn't seem to be too high, but the portions were on the small side. You could easily spend a $100 for three and still not be totally full.

3) They played EDM and dance music the whole time we were there and some of the lyrics were totally inappropriate for a dining experience. We couldn't help being bothered by  the thumping and crude lyrics while we tried to enjoy our meal.

Any cook who uses MSG can't be taken seriously as a chef. It's a lazy way of cooking and we avoid any place that uses the toxic chemical. Anybody who said the food here is good, well, they're right. That's because it's loaded with MSG and they didn't realize it or have this junk a regular basis. 

On a Friday night, there were only three tables including ours in this good sized restaurant. It's no wonder why.",3NqSmH1yHOLecWWjp0qUTA,0,0,3,sxDQpl-jIax_6xazqAD0Dg

Now depending on the person, this could be either awkward or extremely entertaining. I leaned towards the latter.

After perusing the menu, I noticed that there weren't any vegetarian entrees available. No matter, I went with two hot appetizers. 
CABBAGE PEROZKI ($1.50) A soft warmed roll with bits of cabbage stuffed inside. I wouldn't get this again, but it was worth a shot. 3/5
VARENIKI ($5.95): A dumpling stuffed with potatoes and topped with sauteed onions and sour cream. Delicious and as good an entree as any! 5/5  

Husband got the Chicken Kiev ($13.95) and loved it! Buttered chicken stuffed into some kind of roll and comes with all the fixings on the side (potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes). 

Everyone loved being an audience member of the wedding and loved the food! Russian food is a yes for us.

5320941,2017-05-28,6,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"Cafe Mayakovsky.  What more can be said that other Yelp reviewers have not?  Well, let me try!

It was a warm, gentle evening as I reclined in my favorite sofa while sipping on a fine single malt scotch from a gold laden goblet while taking wisps from my ivory tusk pipe.  I felt a sudden longing, nay... a subtle desire creeping up from deep inside me of which at first I could not define.  It was not long before I was able to deduce that this yearning was indeed my need for sustenance.  

I thought to myself (self)... what shall it be tonight?  The same old rustic TV dinner eviscerated of all it's nutrients by the nuke machine?  Bland delivery pizza or stale Chinese?  NO!!!  Tonight we try something new!  So there it was, I embarked on my journey through Yelp to find a 4 1/2-5 star gem that delivered, was unique and something that I had not yet tried.  Here I found the several previous reviews for Cafe Mayakovsky and decided to courageously give it a try.

My order consisted of the Chicken Kiev, mashed potatoes and the honey cake for dessert.   What can I possibly say about the nourishment I received this night that the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin had not already said better.  ""My whole life has been pledged to this meeting with you...""  Truer words have never been spoken.  Although the food tasted of a bit extra salt due to the tears of joy and pleasure streaming down my face as I enjoyed every last delicious bite... the Chicken Kiev was cooked to perfection, while the mashed potatoes seemed to be made with only that special kind of love that you'd get from an Italian immigrant mother or a rescue pet.  The famous Honey Cake that I'd read so much about was only possible to be eaten while humming a tune from the well-known Russian opera Pan Voyevoda by Nikalai Rimsky-Korsakov.  Which was doubly odd since I had never heard of or even seen that opera.

So the final and most important question.  Would I recommend Cafe Mayakovsky?  I think the late great Vladimir Lenin said it best when he said ""Crime is a product of social excess"".  For those reading this humble review, it would truly be a crime to not eat at this amazing establishment.",Kw6rAE68dp3J6TW3L4AzaQ,7,6,5,DtLESPsQeSa2TbyqRTwXeQ

The food was decently priced, this place is authentic Russian restaurant in Vegas, and the owner is this awesome Russian guy! He was very accommodating and sat with us and talked for a while. We came on Russia's Independent Day, so we got free Vodka. 

I absolutely loved the menu! Everything we tried was delicious....
Borsh - Sour....a very unique but pleasant flavor. I personally don't like beets, but how they utilize it in this soup, works for me.
Beef Stroganoff - YUM! It reminds of gravy for some reason - thick, heavy, and savory. It is heavy comfort food all the way. 
Shnitzel - YES! Fried pork, it is delicious and crispy. Many would look at it and assume it was fried fish. It is a must try.
Shashlik Lamb - Typical lamb, it was on the dryer side. It tasted good, but if you already tried it elsewhere, then don't try it here.
Honey Cake - I have always been a fan of the European Honey Cake since there's an amazing bakery in Hayward that sells these. This one is decent though. If you haven't tried it, try it!

5604159,2015-08-29,4,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"Just realized I'm about to review yet another Russian restaurant, it's like I won't learn my lesson and keep going back for more spanking. 

 Every time I end up at a Russian restaurant it's because my giddy family gets a huge kick of hearing me speak Russian. Never fear, the wait staff is fluent in English, but I oblige all the same. 

 The food is...Russian. You've been to one Russian restaurant, you are an expert, choices vary not at all, frankly. We are not fancy. We whip up solid, hearty meals built around meat and potatoes and we come from a culture that valued salt as one would gold, so salt and pepper are it. We occasionally get saucy and throw in some dill or parsley, but we are plain and earnest in our cuisine. And heavy. Sour cream makes a fantastic base for every Russian sauce. Simple reason is we come from a place where it gets so cold in the winter, you are lucky to keep your face and toes from falling off. We need nutritious, calorie dense fare to keep us from freezing to death. We eat to keep alive, no joke. And we have to pickle everything because it all only grows two months a year. 

 And so Cafe Mayakovsky suffers from three things plaguing every Russian restaurant I've visited in Vegas- first, service can only be understood by Russians, meaning it is polite, but it's customary to give you time and space to socialize, so by a typical standard- slow, though really, they are just politely not rushing you. Second- food never varies much. Lastly- it's depressing beyond belief to be only party in a restaurant on a Saturday night. 

 Go and get a cross cultural experience, why not.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,5,3,4,DIU_8llWRh804fPURl3vzQ
5607565,2018-01-15,0,PLQl-y06iPOEaqsy_nx-Eg,"After all the amazing reviews I was expecting to be blown away.  The food was decent but it wasn't amazing.  The service was super slow and haphazard.  I think that three different people worked the table and it was more of afterthought than trying to provide service. 

The appetizers were a bit small for the 8 dollar price tag.  The flavors were muted and it tasted like they were mass produced.  They just didn't appear to be fresh. 

The chicken Kiev and the schnitzel were both very tasty.  The salmon was a bit over cooked and small for the $15 price.   The big disappointment was the sides.  The sides we ordered were the rice with vegetables and the homestyle potatoes.  They were $5 bucks each, way too small, and again the flavors were muted.  

I was really hoping for a great dining experience but it just didn't happen.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,4,1,3,HceSrMt0qWy0GSzDYpK7Uw

I've never had Russian cuisine before this night and honestly, it's just like American food.  I ate pork, potatoes, salad... Give it a shot (especially when you get a free shot with Yelp check-in).  Mayakovsky is located in a strip mall that I assumed was closed - there was no one else there.  Which is kinda sad because by the end of this experience, I found myself wanting to come back.

We stepped inside and were greeted & seated immediately with a bright, happy smile from a young Russian woman.  Looking around, we discovered we were the only guests for the entire visit (the final game of the Golden Knights Final may have had something to do with it).  It was a shame too because Thursday nights like this, they have entertainment from a magician, David.  While waiting for our food, he performed a free show for the two of us at our table, and seriously... he was fantastic - funny, skillful, and entertaining - he'll end up performing on the strip one day.

My friend and I shared meals.  The salad was the Stolichniy ""Olivie"" ($6.95) which is with chicken and veggies mixed with mayo - it reminded me of potato salad.  Next up we ate the Pelmeni ($7.95), which were meat dumplings, more like ravioli topped with sour cream - this was so delicious, by the time I remembered to take a photo, it was gone.  Then came the main course, Shashlik ($13.95 pork) which was served with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, and cucumbers.

There aren't a whole lot of Russian restaurants that I know of so it was nice to see one in the community and it deserves much more business.  So if you're ever in the area, give it a shot.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,5,3,4,KWu6tNhEgM68OJ-QZ3fVzw

Well, we had never dined out at a traditional Russian restaurant before so Café Mayakovsky was the perfect choice!  (Thank you, YELP!)  We arrived fairly early (5:45 pm) on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty (one other couple).  Our server (Ludmila) was extremely polite and provided excellent service.  When she found out about the assignment, she gave us a menu to take home for reference.  We tried many different traditional foods (Beef Stroganoff, Blintchiki, Vareniki, Borsch, Lamb Shashlik, Praga Cake) and drinks (Kvas and Mors) and we were not disappointed.  Unfortunately, they were out of their famous Napoleon cake.  The food was very tasty and the portion sizes were just right.  Probably the only two areas that could use a bit of improvement are the interior décor and the presentation of the food but neither of these would prevent me from returning.",gIcpEY34kKVvbHlQJcooQA,0,1,4,oeCZsXDYUN5hSQA4c3ZQsA

I reviewed it honestly. I did not enjoy the food but, I really wanted to love the place. I stand by my original assessment of the quality of the food. The wait staff was sub-par as well, not helpful and almost rude. I did not appreciate the owner going out of his way to call me a liar. If the potatoes they served to my husband and me were not instant, they sure tasted like it. Instant potatoes have a particular texture and flavor, disgusting. The owner may want to change the preparation of their potatoes because, if  they make  fresh potatoes that taste, look, and have the texture of freeze dried, there is a problem. When instant potatoes sit on the plate, they often form little bubbles as they dry out. The potato dish we were served, did exactly that. The food was bland. The only flavor was in the dill they put in everything, and I mean everything. For a place to be this cute, to have this much potential, and serve bland, one note food is bad enough. When you partner that with the poor wait staff service and an owner who sends nasty messages to a patron, it's a sure fire way to ensure I will never be back to give it a second chance.",jZ97LaB2IhC9clweDrJpPg,1,0,1,o8fnvkRTeBVnliL4Q9HSRw
