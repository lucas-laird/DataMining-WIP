I absolutely loved the cumin spiced lamb skewers. The lamb is on the fatty side but it's so juicy and punches you with cumin, very flavorful. If you like cumin you'll love this appetizer and wish you had 10 more of them. 

I wasn't crazy about the other thing that I ordered, the vermicelli noodle side dish. But the lamb skewers are worth the trip alone. Looking at the menu there looks like some great stuff here, I'm looking forward to coming back soon.",xR-QCGdqlcUqrGIxExs_lA,0,0,4,cN5wlCW3jYnChSHdmJlxyw
267580,2011-12-18,4,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"I saw this place a few weeks ago anticipating its grand opening, but was greatly disappointed. I heard it was going to be a Canton Tea Restaurant (), but boy was I wrong. This is yet another typical Las Vegas Chinese restaurant with the same menu as everybody else in town (BBQ King, HK Star, etc.). There is nothing Canton or even HK style about this restaurant. They even serve Pho, which is already quite out of place, but they didn't even have it available when we were there. 

We came here the day after their grand opening and more than half their menu wasn't available to order. For veggies, they only had lettuce, nothing else, and they wanted to charge $7 for it. Seriously? SF supermarket is right next door. Is it that hard to walk over and buy some ingredients?

We ended up ordering two clay pots (which the waiter recommended we order because it would feed up to five people), but when it came, it looked look they were pizza hut personal pan style servings. The size of one pot looks like it wouldn't be enough for even one person, and they were charging $6 for it. Tony's review is correct, it literally looks like they just mixed up the rice with some meat, added some sauce and oil, then put it in the claypot. There were no crisp burnt rice sticking against the pot ().

We also ordered beef dry chow fun, which was ok tasting, but lacked the ""wok air"" (). We were still hungry, so we ordered some salty fish chicken fried rice. That was decent, but portion was small. 

Service: This is the most disappointing part of the experience. I understand it's their second day of operation, but the waiters literally looked like they just started working there for the very first time. Menus were not given to us immediately when we sat down. We had to remind them to give us the basic utensils and napkins. Tea was not promptly refilled when we were out. They literally didn't study their own menu. We ordered by dish name and they didn't know what the menu item # was or where to find it. This might be a pet peeve of mine, but I've NEVER EVER received my receipt in the check book thingy upside down.

Honest to say, I'll never come here again and would not recommend anybody to come here. The only thing they have going for them are the decorations, which makes the interior better looking than before (Ay Chung).",IegXTpaLReHvm2PSH7sGZw,6,1,1,eFVyN4USt9tudNGY37QFfg

853652,2012-02-15,0,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"I have been there twice this month because I had a good experience for the first time, and the second time didn't disappoint me. Before the store changed to Kung Fu Chef, it was another Taiwanese restaurant. The decoration doesn't change a lot, but the menu is totally different and the food is even better.

For two time experience, I both ordered clay pot rice:  shrimp sauce pork first and  chicken for second. The waitress said I needed to wait 20 mins for that, but I understood that it supposed to be prepared and cooked that long. Also for that cheap price and delicious favor, I was willing to wait. One great through idea for them was that a small bowl of soup was served with the pot. When I almost finished, I poured the soup into the pot and mixed with the scorched rice sticking in the pot. This is a really really nice and attentive to customers.

We also ordered the chicken wings, goose intestines and fried calamari. All tasted really good. We did have some problems with the fried calamari since they added vinegar but my friends and I didn't like it, so they immediately made us a new dish.
Very kind to guests, truly. For drinks, we didn't put a lot of expectations on it. I liked my almond milk tea, but my friend's coffee milk tea was just soso.

Overall, it is worth for 5 stars since they have polite servers, tasty food and enough lamplight, and certainly we will go again.",0wJH9vhR5yCKw1ZGstbhUQ,1,1,5,4eR3Aqpr6Xcl3e8jrxqOUg
1083509,2012-07-03,0,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"Ugh.  I was really expecting something better.  We stopped by for lunch around 1pm on a Monday and service was very slow.  The gentleman that helped us was quite friendly and obviously busy keeping the place clean (and it was very clean), but we even had to wait more than 10 minutes just for the menus, then another 20 for our food.
We ordered the twice-cooked pork, salt & pepper chicken wing appetizer, Mongolian beef, and I had a lychee slush with boba added.
Though the menu said there was a choice of soup with the pork lunch special, we were brought the bean curd and seaweed.  The broth had been thickened with too much starch and had very little flavor besides salt.  The pork dish came out before I had even had a second spoonful of the soup, so I asked about the chicken wings.  I was told they don't serve appetizers first like they do in American restaurants.  Hmmm, really?  
A minute later we received the Mongolian beef, with the chicken wings right behind.  
I really wouldn't have minded this if the food was good.  It did all seem quite fresh, but the only thing I liked was my refreshing slush.  I had not realized when I ordered it that the twice cooked pork was actually pork belly.  Perhaps this was my fault, but neither my guest or I liked it.  The sauce was rather good, but the fat was too tough to bite through.
The Mongolian Beef, a dish I have had many versions of, was the worst iteration yet.  There was a lot of onion that had barely touched the wok, it was so raw and the sauce was quite sweet and thick as though it came straight out of a bottle.  This was served with some fried rice that had an unpleasant flavor.
The wings were not bad,  the coating was crispy and fried just right.  I didn't love the flavoring, which had a bit too much 5-spice for me, but at least I could eat my share of these.  The other two dishes that we shared, were not even halfway eaten by the time we ready to leave.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,0,0,2,nkclms0LlrNij3Bi09AS6Q

Even though Kung Fu Chef is predominantly a Chinese restaurant, they also serve pho, and do they ever!  

The Pho Tai (med-rare thin sliced beef) was maybe the best Pho I've had in the valley.  This bowl of fabulous pho was fragrant, flavorful, and fulfilling.  The Vermicelli had just the right texture and the symphony of ""wow that's good,"" flavors had me excited about my next bite.  The cilantro and onion were what stood out most in the soup, and since I love both of those things, I was very satisfied. 

The servers were very friendly and happy to answer all of my American questions, usually beginning with ""what's this?""

However we decided to order off their regular menu, which was still fairly cheap. We ordered filet with veggies, beef fried noodles, wonton soup, and salt and pepper calamari.

Food overall was just OK. Not bad, but maybe not worth a repeat visit unless necessary. 

Servers overall were friendly and restaurant was clean and spacious.

2851834,2012-01-13,3,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"With a name like Kung Fu Chef, this place doesn't pretend to be a destination for the Asian gourmand, but with the flexible late night hours and extremely reasonable prices, this is an ideal pitstop for the LV local who is coming off a long day's work and too tired to cook at home or a tourist down on their luck at the casino needing an affordable pick-me-up to rally for a second round.

As I sat down, a bubbly server offered me choice of iced water or hot tea, which I assumed was complementary, but they also have a wide array of boba drinks as well.  I gravitated towards the noodle soups since they were all priced between 5-8 dollars and the server recommended that I get the salted chicken noodle soup, which turned out to be a steaming bowl of thin cantonese egg noodles with some chinese greens in a mild chicken broth served alongside sliced boiled bone-in chicken (much like hainanese chicken) brined in an herbal salt mixture that was perfectly seasoned throughout every bite and had a juicy succulent texture.  The combination of the two eaten together was quite harmonious and they definitely don't skimp on the portions either.  I was definitely pleased with the modern decor and the space was well lit by Asian eatery standards.  There was one gentleman (presumably the manager) who made his rounds by each table checking on all the customers and offering to provide extra sauce to my chicken upon request, so this was a pleasant surprise as well.  

Definitely a place worth *punching* into your GPS and *kicking* back with friends for some good eats without *flipping* out over the bill.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,6,3,4,vGi0o06AjHHjd3AtAUMMfg
2868487,2012-03-13,0,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"Jade and I just happened to stumble upon this place.  We were using Chinatown as a meet up destination and just so happen to see the huge ""Lunch Special"" Banner hanging outside.  After walking around the premises and looking at our dining options, we opted to go with Kung Fu Chef.

Pros:
  * LARGE MENU SELECTION & PRICING:
  There were tons of choices and all at very reasonable prices.  Lo Mein & Fried Rice of all variations ranged in price from $4.99 - $8.99.  They also have options in Clay Pot dishes, Seafood, and even the ever-so-popular Pho.  There were some menu items that I've never seen before too:  Salt Fish Sausages, Brine Duck Tongue, and Lamb On A Stick (just to name a few).  I even mentioned that Andrew Zimmern would probably take a liking to this place.  If my memory serves me correctly, Lunch specials started at $4.99.  I didn't get any of the specials, but there are definitely some appealing options worth considering for those that are dining on a budget.

 *  ATMOSPHERE:
  The atmosphere was very well-lit and the dining area itself was very large in size.  They had tables large enough for bigger parties (just in case you were wondering).  Due to the excessive floor space, seating did not feel congested... this is always a good thing.  One weird thing though is that the restaurant appeared to be split into 2 different sections.. I think it's just due to the layout of the floor.

*  SERVICE
  Our server was very nice and informative when we had questions about the menu and menu items.  She provided us with recommendations and was very patient with us when we were trying to decide on what to order.

Cons:
*  SERVICE
  Yes, the service was good when we received it, but they never really checked back on us.  I felt that the Tea served in ceramic tea cups was good, but Jade felt it was bland in taste.  We were dying for some ice water ,but had to wave someone down to get it.  I'm not sure if the server would bring the bill to our table so after a few minutes of waiting, I ended up going to the register and waiting there to pay.  

*  STEW BEEF & RADISH HOT POT
  Let me first say that this Hot Pot dish is new to me, but we figured we'd venture out and try something out of the ordinary from out typical picks.  Maybe this is one of those that require acquired taste buds, but whatever it is, this did not taste appetizing.  I figured, maybe its just me, but Jade felt the same way.  We ended up barely touching it and trying to stomach what we did have.  I'm not a fan of this particular dish.

Ordered:
*  SALT & PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS:  The menu reads ""Fried Chicken Wings"", but when I ordered it the server said: ""you are talking about salt and pepper chicken wings right?""  So I answered ""yes"".  There is salt and pepper squid on the menu, but anyhow...  These were really good.  I loved the crunchiness and the whatever they used to season it was very appetizing.  There are 10 wings that come out stacked high on a bed of lettuce.  This is definitely something I'd get again.

*  STEW BEEF & RADISH HOT POT: Read above for my opinion on this.

* CHICKEN DRY FRIED RICE NOODLE:  This was very good as well.  The sauce wasn't too overpowering.  You have an option of Shrimp or Chicken on the menu, but I decided on the Chicken.  It is served A La Carte and there is plenty for 2 to share this dish.  The pieces of chicken were cut larger than what I am usually used to, but I'm not complaining.  I'd recommend this dish.

Overall:
  *  Although, I had a bad experience with Stew Beef & Radish Hot Pot, I must say everything else that we ordered was on point.  The selection of food and prices were very competitive and the portion of food was on the larger side.  I'd definitely come to this place again.

Tips:
 *  If you are in the mood for some Slush drinks, they have a variety to choose from on the back on the menu ($3.95 each):   Red Bean, Papaya, Lychee, and Pineapple Slush to name a few.  
 *  There is tons of parking in the back if the parking lot is full.
 *  For $11.95, they have a LAMB HOT POT SOUP and we were told it's actually served with a flame under it (I'm assuming like Tom Yum).  I have no idea if it's good or not.  I'm just throwing it out there for anyone interested.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,1,4,m_8N3nlexKhtb4jJp60WTQ

They have quite a large selection on their menu, with a Vietnamese food section also.  The prices are reasonable, but the dishes are a little on the small size.  I had the stir fried beef rice noodle from their lunch special menu.  With this you get a free drink, so I got the green tea drink.  The drink was very refreshing.  The beef noodle dish was quite tasty, but very skimpy on the noodles.  There was actually more beef than noodle.  But because the taste was quite good, I will come back and try some of their other dishes on the menu.  3 and  1/2 stars!",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,1,1,3,pfPonKhVrP6xpxVd2gR33A
3814739,2012-01-01,2,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"My recommendation: Chinese Steak and Eggs

I came here randomly with a group of friends only because we thought the name was silly. I wasn't expecting much but man was I suprised. This place is amazing! Every single dish was better than the next. We all ordered something different. We started with drinks. Omg, the Papaya smoothie was sooo good. A little hard to suck out of the straw but it's all good. The egg drop soup and chicken fried rice as appetizers was a great choice. 

I got to try the Chinese Steak and Eggs and I just died. It was that good. The Mongolian Beef and Taro Duck Stew were amazing as well. 

I don't understand why this place has such a bad rating. I can't complain about anything. The interior is nice, inviting and CLEAN and the waiters are very attentive and friendly. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars to balance out it's overall rating.

3853549,2012-04-11,0,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"Though I am not really into the ambience at this joint, I can't deny the food isn't all that bad. I have been there twice. Both times, I had the spare ribs with steamed rice along with shrimp or plain shrimp wonton soup. The former is a hook up for me. I love the special house soy sauce that is served with the dish. Plus, it also comes with a small bowl of soup. I did not need to order any soup actually. 

Nevertheless, I'm a big wonton buff and would love to try out if their wonton soup could beat famous Asian BBQ in the neighborhood.  Well, not really. The wonton soup at Asian BBQ still outweighs the one at Kung Fu Chef which is saltier and plain. Work it up, KF Chef. I have faith in you. I'm certain the taste could be improved some way somehow. 

My aunt also tried the roasted duck rice. I tasted it and would rate it a four star myself - fairly good. It's a LIKE!

The milk tea is a bit too light and watery. I personally like it sort of richer. On the contrary, the house tea which is a compliment smells distinctive. I like this one better. 

The last category I couldn't miss out in my rating is the service. I would give it a four star too. It's absolutely better than most of the Chinese restos in general. Yet, they need to concentrate more on what the customers TRULY want or request. I always have room-temperature water, but everytime it's always iced water.

I liked the menu because everything was numbered so that you knew exactly what you were ordering. We also ordered 1/4 roast duck. It was also quite tasty. I don't have anything to compare it to as far as pho goes but it was the best I've ever had (SMILE). And we had two very big glasses of hot tea that really hit the spot - they don't seem to have sugar though, so I'd bring my own if you want sugar instead of splenda. I'm not sure if they didn't charge us for something because the whole meal came to only $17. The only thing that could be a little better was the waiter.

Great price, good size portions, and even though Chinese food uses alot of sauce, its not as greasy and oily as other Chinese places.

Crispy noodle dishes were awesome.  Restaurant is clean and staff is very helpful and polite.  

When I ordered take out last time, they cut little holes in the take out boxes so the fried wings and shrimp wouldn't get soggy from condensation, a really nice touch that was greatly appreciated.

Both of our food were very salty, to the point that we were trying to scrap some of the sauces off so we can eat it.  The duck tongue, which was suppose to be spicy and hot, was barely warm(temperature wise) and had no flavor...  All I saw was a plate of bell peppers, onions, and maybe a couple of tongue in there.

5918746,2011-12-17,1,MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ,"Kung Fu Chef, not to be mistaken with the other Kungfu (Thai and Chinese) restaurant that is also on Spring Mountain Road, is a new Chinese restaurant that also serves Vietnamese rice and pho noodles.  It occupies the former location of the now closed Ay-Chung Noodle Restaurant.

The restaurant has a nice contemporary Chinese decor, is brightly lit and clean.  The menu has a little split personality built in, but the pricing overall is pretty reasonable. Not to mention that their beverage menu is basically a boba tea and slush tea menu.

I asked the head waiter (possible the owner or manager, since his Kung Fu shirt  looks distinctly different from the other waiters) for their specialties, and was recommended their Wonton Soup and items from the Clay Pot Rice section.  So I ended up ordering Wonton Noodle Soup and the Sparerib Clay Pot Rice.

The Wonton was pretty good. Meaty morsel with shrimp wrapped in a wonton wrapper that is as good as any other Chinese restaurant.  At $4.95 it is an inexpensive meal.

The Sparerib Clay Pot Rice was just okay.  Imagine an order of Steamed Sparerib with Black Bean Sauce from a dim sum cart and pour it over steamed rice and serve it in a clay pot and that is basically it.    As a whole it is not bad, it was tasty.  But traditionally the clay pot rice items are heated over the stove, so the rice closest to the clay pot will have a crispy texture, which this dish lacked.  Again not bad, but simply missed the mark on expectation based on the name of the dish.

Being a new restaurant there are always kinks that inevitably needed to work out, but I have a good feeling about this place. 

Ambiance: 4/5  Good lighting, pleasant Chinese decor.

Service:  3.5/5  Friendly, but not all the waitstaff have a solid command of English.
Food:  3.5/5  Food was tasty, just needs work on the execution of some items.

Price:  4/5  Most items are not expensive on the menu, but pricing is mostly on par with other Chinese restaurant in this category.

Value:  3.5/5  you get what you pay for.

Location:  West side, on Spring Mountain just west of Decatur.  Same plaza as the old S.F. Market, Swish and Shuseki.

Parking: 4/5  Usually not too bad, as there are covered garage with access on either end of the plaza, plus parking spaces on the second level.

Will be a solid 4 stars with just some improvements and experience under their belts.  As of right now, it is still striving for a black belt.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,11,7,4,XjrK__HJh3WtW-rZagYkpg
