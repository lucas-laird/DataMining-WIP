Myself and a buddy waited 20 minutes for a pre cooked slice of pizza and a hotdog. 



Fries, pizza and hotdog were awful!

The stromboli and slice of pizza we bought were both very good. The prices are a bit high ($8 for the stromboli, which is about twice the size of a hot pocket. and a couple bucks less for the pizza) but not outrageous considering the location.  I'm picky about pizza and I really liked this thin crust, plus they give you a small extra container of sauce with the stromboli and it's a good sauce.  For the food itself, this is 4-stars, I knocked it down one star because they don't have any value options and their 'combo special' is just adding a soda for $2 which isn't a deal.",U17jxjK_srhyGyY9gulgzA,0,0,3,NGzwwJE_-Z2dAtKYicAdKQ

Disappointing because the slice was decent so I was interested to see how a fresh pie would taste, guess I wont get to find out. Also no garlic knots. Offered to make fresh ones but who wants to wait like 20 plus minutes for garlic knots? Not this guy.

***Update***

Tried another time but earlier this go. Used the number to set up a pick-up but no response and this was after 11AM when they supposedly opened. Tried again at night an hour and a half before they closed and they were closed early again! Who closes before 9:30PM on a Friday!? Either the yelp info is wrong or they are just trying not to make any money, seems like a waste of a good location to me.",hivkdQokX6AHHxPbTvKnPA,0,0,2,qIHwMugPAmFlxHDtIqlKRw

What a huge mistake, it was my first night in Vegas and this place gave me diarrhea. I spent the whole night using the bathroom while I was out. I spent the next two days recovering as well, didn't get to have as much fun since I was always worrying about going to the bathroom.",mRKqxYw5wEwkZvKyn40aIw,0,0,1,s5i6GrjLDDIbx53G_uB3iA
