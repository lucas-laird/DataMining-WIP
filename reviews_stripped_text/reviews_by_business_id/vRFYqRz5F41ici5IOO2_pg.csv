Take note she makes basic rolls and if you are ordering A LOT prepare to wait. 

If you need a basic sushi fix or maybe a platter to take home this is a low cost way to get it!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,2,1,5,wdu6xiOL4MM4Mmt-RDHcRQ

Once walking in, I was pretty amazed that the little old lady that owns this shop is super adorable and sweet. While the shop sells a variety of EVERYTHING. Basically Asian fusion, there's a mixture of Filipino foods , Chinese foods, and Thai food. They sell sushi and alkaline water. I'm definitely coming here forever. There's no place that sells alkaline water so openly like this place and so cheap too!!",EYwvNonD5kUGGNRTGjAAHA,5,4,5,LmXATS3bRdtwBH39-GlnYg
2526662,2017-08-11,0,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,I love coming here to refill our bottles. Clean and quick service if u take it inside. Lots of Asian/filipino goodies. Sushi is good too but we usually get it when she makes it at glaziers market. Her nephews are a big help all the time they are there.,weHU1rp6B2LUsOURzd8Jtg,0,0,5,wbKpTjGKFmmi1VKjnIuyxw
2688289,2013-02-25,1,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"Ok, so I'm checking out the reviews here and the 1 facade photo of this place and I'm thinking, no thanks.  But I ""accidentally"" came across Vegas Express Sushi because they supply Glazier's market with sushi... and they are GOOD.  Their takeout sushi is superior to the dried out crappy stuff you can buy at Vons or most gocery/deli stores.  Their cooked rolls compare to the ones you can buy at Costco, and their raw nigiri is very fresh.  For the price, you are definitely getting the next best thing to stepping in a sushi joint.  Also, they have awesome large party platters!  I'll be posting photos of their takeout and menu this weekend. (FYI, this is a takeout place with a small Asian grocery, not a restaurant with seating.)",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,2,0,5,N3X3xquJS0kgrhAnw_FWHg
2732731,2011-05-16,0,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"So this is basically 3 businesses rolled into one: a filipino convenience store, a water store, and a sushi to-go store. 

As far as the filipino store goes, it's pretty basic. Lots of snacks and dried noodle packets, some frozen foods, and some beauty products. The prices are decent, not as outrageously gouged as other filipino stores, but not the cheapest either. I also saw a ""chiller machine"" (aka slushy machine) in the back where it wasn't clear whether it was employee operated only, or available for customers to fill their slushy cups themselves. But they only had 2 flavors, mango and something red.

The water store part takes up a whole wall of the small space. You pretty much bring in your bottles and fill them up and the nice lady at the counter charges you by the gallon. They also sell all kinds of water bottles and dispensers throughout the store. 

The sushi you order at the front counter from the lady who goes to the back to make your order fresh. Although they have a menu full of a variety of rolls and nigiri, the way the lady spoke, it felt like there was only 2 kinds of fish left: tuna and eel. So I ordered an eel roll for $5.99 and a nigiri mix plate of eel and tuna for $7.99. They also had maki rolls available, like California, cucumber, vegetable, etc. 

The sushi was actually pretty fresh and tasty. They come packaged like they do in the grocery stores, but without that weird staleness of the rice and fish. For a total of $14 to get 8 pieces  of eel roll (with cucumber and avocado), and the nigiri plate of 4 generous pieces each of eel and tuna it was a pretty good deal. Everything was fresh and nothing was stale, but the only downside is if you're in a rush, you might want to order ahead of time because she took about 10 minutes to make both orders.

And I just wanted to note that the eel was fresher and not as oversauced as most sit-down sushi places in town. The taste wasn't as fishy either, and the sauce wasn't overpowering or in too much quantity. Nice.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,3,1,4,ayFi3LnMlNuvgxlNCMGnUA

3173991,2015-04-08,2,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,I do really like sushi and for what they offer it is good.  It does not compare to Yonaka and or Soho but for the price and convenience it is pretty good.  I have gotten it for a quick lunch a few times and have always enjoyed it.  They use fresh ingredients and the sushi is well prepared.   Great for a quick sushi fix and or for lunch.,6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,3,2,4,MDHvtWPzY9tQGApQn3-EUw

I needed my sushi fix on my short break and instead of walking over to smiths I decided to try here since sushi is made fresh daily and I had a guest rave about this secret place! Needless to say my rice is hard as a rock, the wasabi has brown coloring from sitting on the tray too long and the avocado looks the same. The date says made today but I doubt it nonetheless. 3 stars for the super cool Oriental food/sauces though!",8y4tguDRDGuMk39PX4kGPw,0,0,3,JeiB_t5iwg4rMV7NO0zT9g
4094650,2012-07-17,0,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"This was my local alkaline water place but I have since started home delivery of water. But when I did come here, Jennifer the lady that owns and runs the place is always really friendly and helpful. 

Their standard is alkaline 8 water but they sell a alkaline 10 at a premium. Can I tell the difference between the two? No, but the way I see it is that for the cost Of a bottle of water at the store, I can get a gallon of the alkaline 10 so it's worth it. 

Good water is great for you especially with the tap water we have here in las vegas.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,1,1,4,mBSbuyRI6ck85HwQTTfbpw

An employee was still inside the store so my husband tapped on the door to get her attention. She let us know that they were closed BUT she let us know that they make the sushi daily for Glazier's, which is right up the street (Warm Springs & Durango). Thankfully, we drove up the street and brought home some delicious sushi. I HIGHLY recommend their sushi.

4358508,2015-07-01,1,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"One day I was craving sushi but wanted it to go and fast, So I decided to go here because my boyfriend used to get our alkaline water from this location.   The sushi was handmade by the owner, she was friendly.  The store had pretty much any Asian snacks you could think off, water jugs since they sell water and alkaline water here, hence the large sinks inside and one outside.  This little business looks like it's doing pretty well.  It's in a good location, in the same plaza as the Pot Tea Social House and AT&T on Rainbow.  Their sushi was good, but I later on realized it's pretty much the same sushi they sell at Glaziers.  I would come here again for take out sushi if I want to choose from their menu, but I would just go to Glaziers or Von's where it's already made and ready to pick up.  Their sushi is is geared more towards catering, which I would definitely enjoy at a sorry or something!",ATwKhh6I02oRdIFvTEkcog,1,0,4,mZCEVCKRcXI29J7Vsjpbxw

We refill our water bottles there and that's primarily why I visit this little shop.  The lady who works there is always friendly and pleasant.  But I particularly love when her nephews (I think) are working because there's usually 2-4 of them helping out during their school breaks and they refill all my water bottles for me super quick.  Most recently, I went by with my two kids in tow and didn't really want to drag them out of the car in this heat.  I popped my head in and saw the boys there.  They were super helpful! They got the bottles for me out of the car and brought them back out too when they were done.  They even load them into the car for me.  Love them for that! They are always so nice and friendly! Because they are so quick and efficient, I can refill the bottles super quick and get on my way.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,5,5,coGgvkTcUx4EU419LvSJyQ

Very friendly lady that works there and how clean the place is keeps me coming back.  It's also a great little Asian market if you need noodles, meats, fish, snacks and other little ingredients you may need that can't really be found in the area this is where to go.  

I frequent this place for their water though.  Clean fill stations even have the bottle rinse.  They also have an alkaline fill station as well.  2 fill stations outside for after hours.  The prices are great!",MSSM3pZEP9Mvs9rFcbkJdQ,1,0,5,_x26y56s1VRxU1YjE9PZxw
5191860,2015-06-28,1,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"I will never poke fun at a water/sushi place again!

Ordered 2 party trays from the sweet elderly woman behind the counter. The first was off their menu - it included a rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, several Cali rolls, Cali rolls with tobiko,  and nigiri. She offered options for the nigiri & I went with tuna & salmon. The second tray was a made up one where I selected three rolls from their regular menu. It included a caterpillar roll, cali with spicy tuna, & lion roll (shrimp tempura). Both trays came out to about $80.

The platters were ready at the promised time and included a generous amount of wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, & chopsticks. Everything looked & tasted delicious. To my relief the pieces were not rice-heavy. Next time I'll request for them to leave out avocado toppings (the caterpillar roll had turned sad & brown by the time the party started). 

Loved the service & flexibility! Highly recommended.",Giyb4IIUm07S1sZexzVcrg,2,1,5,pO88XcRknh7UdDe4VyUOLw
5373935,2012-02-05,0,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"A friend and I have joked around about trying this place for some time. The combination of a water and sushi store, just sounded odd. Yes, fish do live in water, but I never thought about these two items to be the main products of a business.

We had went to Sam's Club before in an attempt to buy groceries to cook dinner. By the time we had finished doing errands, it was getting late. Passing on everything except salad ingredients we trekked to another store and found nothing. Guess it was time to stop messing around and finally try this place. When we got there, the lady running the shop was walking to the door. We found out later that they closed at 7:00 and we had got there at 7:15. Instead of kicking us out, she didn't even mention anything. Throughout our browsing of the store, she was patient. The shop is a basic convenient stop for Asian products with an emphasis on Filipino items.

The sushi was surprisingly delicious. We got a tray of Inari (sushi rice stuffed tofu skins), Seaweed Salad, Spicy Tuna Roll, and a mixed plate. All of this came out to $20. On our drive home, I opened the tofu wraps and they were warm and flavorful. For a quick bite, made on the spot, it is a good alternative.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,2,4,toQY_MELTCAHwWYP2uI5pA
5482049,2014-03-06,2,vRFYqRz5F41ici5IOO2_pg,"I can be somewhat of a procrastinator at times, and last week was one of those times.  I needed to make sushi for an important demonstration I was having in front of 20 people, but didn't get around to doing it.  The DAY OF my demonstration was when I decided to scramble and find some place that could cater the sushi for me.  I found Vegas Express Sushi on Yelp and wasn't sure if I should go through them because the pictures posted doesn't show a very ""sushi-making type of place"".  However, their largest platter was at a reasonable price which beat the other places I had called.

I decided to call and spoke with an older woman (I really wish I got her name).  She was VERY polite and assured me that she could have my platter ready and made in an hour and a half (I needed it in two).  Forty minutes later, she called me back and let me know that it was ready for pick up!

When I got to the store, I was even more surprised because the pictures on Yelp depict the store exactly!  It looks like a liquor/convenience store.  However, when she realized I was there to pick up my platter, she QUICKLY disappeared into the back of the store.  Before my nerves could unsettle themselves, this woman came scuttling back while carrying a GIANT sushi platter with much more than what I had ordered, and a GIANT smile on her face.  She rang me up, the whole time describing what was inside, how she made it, and how grateful she was that I had ordered.  I could tell that this woman was very proud of what she does there and very grateful for the customers she receives.  I took a closer look at the platter with her and it was beautiful!

Oh, and as for quality of the food itself, well...
When I got  to my demonstration the ENTIRE sushi platter was gone in less than 10 minutes of me opening it for the meeting.",59yalGU6Srsgv3-AYL--OQ,5,3,5,4Z5imm14Jb1iSQJJzsJBuw
