The owner did not ask us how many and did not seat us, yet they seated the table behind us. Selection was very limited, food quality was not the best. Ladies pushing the carts were not nice and very ignorant. No one smiled one bit although we were very polite. Everyone seemed pissed off and grouchy.

I originally had a craving for some steak and shrimp but didn't know where to go. I was accompanied by my parents and ang tee from Australia. They were limited with time because they were going to attend a show in juan hour and 37 minutes from the time I had my craving. For me, not so much as I just planned to chill at the hotel room, watch ESPNg highlights, get piss drunk & eventually pass out. So I was being more considerate to them if anything. Aw how cute.

We stayed at Caesars Palace so instead of wasting our time trying to find a place for steak & shrimp we ran into Sea Harbour since it was right in front of our faces and most convenient for us. My mommy asked, ""hmm..what if they don't have your steak & shrimp here?"". I immediately said, ""it's alright, I am Ong Gree as hell and I won't be a fastidious brat for the current moment."" (Ong Gree eckwalls Hungry by the way).

So during that moment in time, my mind state wasn't so damn selective and my mental memory quickly switched from a fat juicy steak & succulent shrimp to hopes of a fantastic Chinese dining.

He shoots the J and Scores!

The service was great and very welcoming. Provided a comfortable atmosphere from when we first walked in to the second we had to jam. They were always quick to fill our waters (that's a big deal to me because I always pound my ice waters with my meal like it was a Steel Reserve 40 oz or something. Naw just kidding. But possibly something similar to that.)

We had calamari which was GOOD. We had the pork fried rice which was GOOD. We had Beef with Bittermelon which I highly requested for the night. My ang tee from Australia was sore prized that I eat that stuff because most people can't handle that bitter taste. It is an acquired taste but I have conditioned my buds to love it. I also explained to her that after you eat bittermelong it enhances your taste with everything else and provides your ice water with a sweeter taste. (I wonder if I am the only weirdo that experiences this?) We had some other items that I just can't remember now because my physical memory is failing me. I bet we ordered sweet & sour chickeng and chow mein. Either way I had no complaints with our meal. I would like to highly recommend it.

I really wanted to compliment the Beef with Bittermelon because I found it extra GOOD.

I would like to thank Sea Harbour Seafood Restaurant for a fantastic dinner and for erasing my craving of steak & shrimp. I was completely satisfied and my stew match wasn't angry at me at all.

I would like to take this moment to stand up and applaud this place.

If you guys are starving in Vegas staying and at Caesars, go here Now.",p_514Yo8SndKB7dCvGdvWw,4,2,5,Nx49ZRiGdObgY0Hdh5LLCw
