18682,2012-01-10,1,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"after a morning workout, we were craving some food, big time.  We drove down spring mountain and checked out two Korean restaurants, neither very attractive... we drove by this place and decided that we would eat here.  The food was good, flavour are strong, we had the hamburger steak daikon with shisho, if you dont like pickled flavour with vinegar, do not pick this style!!!  I actually enjoyed it quite alot since i like daikon alot...the chicken curry is a bit spicy, but my love thought it was just right, Japanese curry redeemed itself in his eyes.  The pressured coffee maker was fun, bringing soft aroma to coffee.  They do grab groceries daily so everything is fresh here.  It has big potential to grow into a 4 star plus, but they need to definitely mature their style of cooking, presentation, and balance out the different flavors to create amazing dishes in the future.  We shall see....",mV8HEfJ6npKIxwU7UVZ_nQ,1,0,3,0TzG1hdWWJC5lakSo70AFg

It serves food that rivals the top restaurants on the strip but in a very simple manner.  You see good food doesn't have to be fancy, it has to be well prepared, with quality ingredients and care taken in the preparation.  I wish the owner good luck as he moves to reopen this restaurant at a better location.  Sometimes the economy and a bad landlord can tarnish a gem.  But a true diamond like cafe de Japon will always shine.",Edzx9PCnLkRV7Vfw7KgsEQ,0,1,5,Cb7e4jYvrVWLvEhmqS0s6g
98394,2012-10-25,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"PROS: Delicious food, clean/friendly atmosphere, great service, the owner (I think his name is Kiichi) always greets me with a smile and even chit-chats when he's not busy preparing food.  I typically order the curry and omurice and both always keep wanting more. Also, their oil infusion water is refreshing and pairs great with the food.

CONS: Its not a big downside, but its their policy for you to buy greater than $20 worth of food to be granted a stamp on their frequency card.  Again, not a big deal, but I come here often (sometimes by myself) and I don't always buy more than $20. I would like to be ""rewarded"" for being a frequent customer without having to pay so much.",hYbciJ5P3rhkfDBnFAigWg,1,0,4,C5tiJOEI7Q0-6ycIDiOB-w

340493,2011-09-10,1,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"I'm not sure what kissaten means in Japanese, but I'm pretty sure it means comfort food. I've never been to Japan, but I'm guessing that this is what Japanese people would crave if they were fighting a cold or getting over a bad day at work.

I believe the restaurant's new. The signage isn't up yet and the restaurant seems incomplete when you walk in. There weren't many customers there which is usually a big warning for people walking in the door. The menu seems extremely limited and slightly pricey. At this point you may be considering other choices. Don't. Stay. Sit awhile. Try something new. Besides, you've probably already had Ichiza twice this week.

There's this weird ketchup fetish often observed in some asian cultures. I've seen Filipinos put ketchup on scrambled eggs. I have Chinese relatives that smother ketchup on a $65 cut of meat at a fancy steak house (yes, it's a cardinal sin). I tend to avoid putting ketchup on anything other than french fries and hamburgers so I was skeptical when I saw the fried rice with egg and ketchup on Cafe de Japan's menu. It's surprisingly good. Of all the fried rice with eggs and ketchup dishes I've had, this was definitely the tastiest.

The beef stew on rice isn't much to look at. It looks like they took a can of Chunky soup, scooped it out, and put it next to some white rice. But your first bite will be quickly followed by a second... then a third... then a fourth. It's gone before you realized what happened. And I think that's the definition of comfort food. It's something you eat while you lose yourself in your thoughts. Reflect on your day. Had a rough afternoon? Have some of the hamburger steak and sip on some amazing Columbian coffee.

I'm torn between 4 stars and 5 stars. Comfort food should be inexpensive, but Cafe de Japon is definitely on the pricey side. Dinner entree's start at $10 and portions are small (for American palettes). If it were just a few dollars cheaper per entree, I'd probably make this a weekly visit.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,2,2,4,KVJu45NcNWkr11aV3RQzhw
415175,2013-06-22,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Ok, this place is definitely not busy, but the great thing about them is that the place is actually run by Japanese people. The lights are dimmed at night and just to add to that, the place is not that spacious. They only had two people on staff. I ordered the Chicken Curry Rice with an Sorbet Iced Green Tea for dessert. The Curry Rice was amazing! Almost up to par with the one my host mother used to make back in Japan! On the flip side of that, the service was terribly slow it took 30 minutes to get my food and the place only had one more table. Now, when I asked the lady about the Sorbet Ice Green Tea it sounded to me like she said ""sorbet"" ""ice cream"" but it was shaved iced Green Tea! It was not great. The presentation was extraordinary though. That also took an extra 30 minutes making my service run up to an hour. 

The cool thing about Cafe De Japon is that they have Japanese magazines from Japan and manga!",Xi0dhtdzZdRAtBb8XeK-0A,0,0,4,7W9hUaboNBLBws08czenEg

- Tenshin Fried rice (on top of the fried rice they put omlet, and pour special Asian sauce, it is just so good)
- Mushroom Hamburg (super rich flavor!!!!!!!!!!!)

You can tell where I am going with this right?  The food here was just okay.  It didn't ""wow"" me.  I'm looking for a place to ""wow"" my taste buds.  I had what everyone recommended- the omelet with chicken fried rice and my hubby had the Japanese Hamburg.  The omelet wasn't that special and the fried rice was not tasty enough.  If I can make tastier fried rice at home, why am I paying $13 for this dish?  It had no flavor.  A bit more seasonings please... the cost of food has gone up but soy sauce is still pretty cheap.  

As for the Hamburg, the first bite is very good but the sauce became too sour after a first few bites.  I'm not into sour hamburger patties.  

I am giving this place 2 stars because the place is well decorated and very comfortable inside and the ketchup on my omelet was that best thing I ate that night.  That ketchup was special but too bad the rest of the food lacked it.",MGRNCiPHnzBhcDULy8OSuQ,2,0,2,BiY3uWLTo4UyKtCnKjbxDw
712563,2012-09-10,3,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Hate to say that I was not really impressed.  On the outside of the restaurant is a big sign that says ""FUSION FOOD"".  The place was also described as a typical Japanese cafe.  Have been to Japan three times and there is nothing that indicates a typical cafe except for a tiny place in Osaka that had curry and 5 other things on the menu.  

I would recommend removing that banner.  The food is not fusion and it detracts from what you are really trying to do.  The service here is decent, but I'm still struggling with the typical cafe thing.  The menu is a mix of some Izakaya style dishes...Japanese curry and the Japanese version of Hanbaga, with a Korean pork and kim chee highlighted by some desserts that you might see in a cafe/coffee shop.  I still have had much better parfaits and desserts.  

Heard the chef/owner is from Sushi Roku and I wish him the best.  Focus on the food and forget the fusion.  The Japanese Hamburger and the Curry is a great start for the concept.  The creative desserts can be another aspect, but go the extra mile and do something more.  I get the impression of settling on a little of this and that.

I would probably go back once or twice a year unless the food improves.  Get rid of the metal chopsticks as well.  Wooden is preferable in a Japanese establishment.  Consider share plates or chopstick holders as well so your customers have a place to put them rather than directly on the table.",t3dxO3Y0MMfdqcaVYfeUPA,3,0,2,_txtsWK5sv3rQOjlnfDAiQ

955282,2013-10-10,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Cafe de Japon is an adorable little cafe/restaurant that serves coffee, desserts, and delicious japanese fusion dishes. It's located in the same plaza as Cathay house and noticeable when you turn in. Although we completely drove past it. Haha.

OFFERS: Make sure to check in on the yelp mobile app to get 25% off their yuzu soda (reg. price: $5). And to like them on facebook for 10% off your bill! 

You also get a stamp card IF you spend at least $10. You get a stamp every $10. Once you hit ten stamps, you get 10% off your bill. So if you hit $40 in one check, it's 4 stamps! Adds up quick even on one visit. This is the new stamp program as of my last visit 10/1/2013. Whew. So a lot of deals at Cafe de Japon! But trust me, you'll want the price reductions.

ATMOSPHERE: Intimate, feels a bit upscale, very quiet even with the low-volume j-pop in the background. Very clean. Low-lighting at night. Even the utensil-holders are cute. 

MAIN COURSE: I got the Hamburg Steak with demi-glace sauce with the full-size order at $12. Half-size is $6. Boyfriend got the curry with spice, karaage, hamburg steak, and corn. Also ordered the yuzu soda. Picture sliced citron (a type of lemon) with carbonation. Tastes fresh, came as a huge mug, but it's a little expensive. 

My hamburg steak was searing hot, flavorful, and served on a piping hot pan. Tasted home-cooked. Presentation very well-done arranged with baby carrots and potato slices. Came with a plate of rice. I couldn't get enough of the caramelized sauce melding with the steak. However, the portion was TINY. Came with two small patties of the hamburg steaks (to give you a visual idea, think $1 menu-size burger patties at mcdonalds, or maybe the size of 2 of the iphone 3GS) (sidenote: yes I still have an iphone 3GS SHUSH). Even my date laughed, ""good thing you got the full-size."" And even offered me some of his curry when he saw me scraping every bit of my plate. Gotta love the boyfriend. According to him, the curry was decent, although a bit small-portioned. Tasted homemade, but not out-of-the-ballpark great. 

DESSERT: The owner/chef was very accommodating. Very attentive, funny. Upon ordering dessert, we ordered just one cheesecake, when I remembered my tiny entree and I said, ""wait! make that two."" The chef teased, ""OK! Two! That way no fighting!"" Haha. They do have special daily dessert items not available everyday so be sure to ask for that! There's also a separate dessert menu.  

Strawberry Cheesecake was an explosion of flavor without being too sweet. Light, perfect contrast to our palate after entrees. The plate was a canvas of art with sliced strawberries and splashes of sauce. I almost didn't want to eat it. Very caring in the attention to plating. My boyfriend griped that it wasn't real cheesecake because they used feathery mascarpone cheese so he expected it to be more solid and cake-y. His opinion doesn't matter though :D (just kidding)

VERDICT: Delicious food with my only complaint being portion size. This place is definitely meant for you to order an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The real star was the dessert. I believe on his website stated that there were no freezers in his kitchen. Everything made fresh with incredible attention and precision. Although you might break the bank since it's pricey for portion, it's incredibly great quality food. We swear that we don't eat more than the average person, but we'd like to feel full from the main meal. It's a great place to treat someone out to for date night.

It was only the chef serving us the whole night between three tables! Call that multi-tasking. He held open the door for us when we went for the exit! Service very quick. Next time we'll drop in for the desserts and the coffee!

I did decide to go for it because I haven't had Japanese curry in a while. The service was great. The owner/chef was friendly, and I spent some time talking to him.

It's never too busy, which is nice. Staff is pretty attentive and knowledgeable so feel free to ask them questions before ordering.

The food---Very diverse menu, ranging from small tapas like dishes to entrees, and of course DESSERT.  Oh, not to mention alcohol. 
I had the Katsu Don which is your breaded chicken or Pork in scrambled eggs with green onions over rice. I'd have to say that this place has one of my favorite katsu chicken, perfectly breaded and extremely moist and tender on the inside. Not dried out like other places. 
My friend had the hamburger steak with potatoes on a hot skillet which he really enjoyed. The steaks looked well prepared with a nice crust on the outside and juicy on the inside. 
We also tried the Garlic Beef w/rice which was delicious! Usually when places say something is garlic ________ it comes out to be not so garlic-y.....cafe de Japon isn't kidding around!
Can't really go wrong with any of their desserts, they're a cafe so it's kind of their thing. We shared the green tea roll cake and it was the perfect ending to our heavy meal. Very fluffy and bursting with that matcha green tea flavor that you would want. Not overly sweet, but creamy.

This place is in the same plaza as Cathay House on Spring Mountain, used to be a korean restaurant that didn't do to well apparently.  Being new they still have half of the restaurant closed off as the owner (former sushi chef from Sushi Roku) informed us he is making a ""Paris"" themed area and possible karaoke, fun!
I went there for lunch, ordered the special which was home made hamburger steak with a stew gravy and fried egg, a side of scalloped potatoes  and they also gave me a side of white rice.  The dish was served sizzling in a skillet and it was delicious.  Hamburger steak cooked perfectly, nice and juicy...stew gravy made me want to try the stew as a complete dish, and the fried egg on top...YUM.  
The coffees they serve are brewed in a few different ways, depending on what you like.  They have a way of slowly brewing their coffee (which apparently takes about 5 hours) so that there is no acidity.  Ask for their coffee menu and inquire about the options.
Service was pleasant and they were very attentive, never having to wait for anything.
I will be back for the curry, which is cooked without water (?) and made fresh daily.

My 9-year-old wasn't happy till he got his curry - it looked a lot like the packaged curry we make at home, but the taste was so much better. Turns out the owner makes a veg broth base and purees veggies to thicken it. No flour, no MSG, no sugar...and customers can design their own curries. We ordered three, plus a karaage almost overflowing with flavor, and absolutely awesome takoyaki. We are seriously looking for reasons to come back to LV so we can eat here again. For now, it's the main draw for us. 

It's a small restaurant that deserves to be bursting at the seams, but for now at least, you can probably show up to get a table. The decor is cute without being kitschy (detail-oriented people might enjoy the cartoon napkin holders, the artful presentation of the curries, and the constantly updated specials board), and the host is pleasant without being pushy. We were running late for a plane, but the custom-prepared dishes didn't take too long, and they were so worth it that we survived the next five hours of travel rush-and-delay with a smile on our faces, at least most of the time. 

If you have any interest in Japanese food beyond sushi, or just want to try a low-key, homey and interesting restaurant, or just need a break from glitz and superficiality, this would be a great place for you to eat. 

Most dishes are in the $6-10 range. We ordered an appetizer, four entrees, two huge real-fruit sodas (yuzu is our new favorite) and a dessert (the ice cream parfait was a great, creamy and not-too-sweet finish), and paid about $55. VERY worth it.",Lrulnro6yP5bwVvXVeRQqQ,0,0,5,Y4_jVLRIY8xPmd68c3DJ4g

2008570,2012-03-13,1,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Delicious, home-style Japanese food -- if you think Japanese food begins and ends with sushi, this place will open your horizons with a variety of tasty options.  The menu is tasty, subtle and offers a variety of meat, fish and veggie options with rich sauces.

Let's start with the coffee since the restaurant does include ""Cafe"" in its title.  Cafe de Japon has gotten a lot of press in Las Vegas for its siphon coffee.  The brewing of siphon coffee is almost ceremonial.  It involves two glass chambers--the bottom one holding water that eventually boils and rises up into the coffee grounds in the upper glass chamber.  As it cools, the coffee separates from the grounds and falls back into the lower coffee chamber.  It's a hell of a lot of fun to watch, but as coffee, it's . . . decent.  I've heard people rave about it, but it's just a light roast cup of coffee.  It's smooth and lacks some of the bitter aftertaste of a traditionally brewed coffee, but it's merely a subtle, uncomplicated flavor. 

As for the appetizers, Cafe de Japon serves up an excellent agedashi tofu appetizer--square of tofu topped with flavoring in the form of grated ginger and scallions with sauce on the plate under the tofu.

We ordered the hamburg steak with daikon and vegetable rice curry.  The gravy sauce on the hamburg steak was surprisingly tart and reminded me of a German sauce, but much lighter.  The plate came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes.  Delicious and a wonderful combination with the steak.  The vegetable curry rice had a good spice, but more subtle than a Thai or Vietnamese curry.  The veggie curry did have an impressive, almost meat flavor to it.  But it's got a spicy kick, so be warned. 

Bottom line: 3 1/2 stars for tasty food and an extra star for very friendly customer service.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,1,4,WAAMTt_Y60bk-Bu31oCCXA

They have a liquor license now!  Sapporo!  They have a late night happy hour that looks pretty decent.

The strawberry shortcake was also excellent.  Very light and not too sweet.  The specials vary everyday so your food choices may differ.

We were the only people there and it was a little awkward but ok.  We actually had to ask for the check.  I guess this is one of those restaurants that thinks its rude to just bring the check.  Still it is a bit of a pain in the ass to get someone's attention.

2261975,2012-03-28,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Amongst Chinatown's hustle and bustle, there's a bourgeoning enclave of Japanese culinary gems: Ichiza, Monta, Ramen Sora and Raku where one can find really authentic Japanese fare from the humble and home cooked, to the higher end dining establishments.  And so when we got got wind of  Cafe de Japon, we were excited to make our way over to Desert Inn Road.

Cafe de Japon is a little different than your regular, run of the mill Japanese restaurant; in fact, it's more like Japanese Coffeehouse that you would find in Japan that serves casual comfort food, (it's not fusion-I HATE that WORD)! 

As you can see by the front facade, this place's got a little humor, (if you can't figure out where you are... look up...directionally challenged)!  As we're edging closer to the entrance, I can't help but wonder, what kind of drunken clientele do they get that needs to know where the exits are right as they walk in?

Take a deep breath and end scene......To our relief, the restaurant interior is a normal looking cafe, with an inordinate amount of Japanese customers, (always a good sign)!  We got seated and started looking at the items on the menu.

And there was a lot, including the specials board. Reading about their menu online, there was a lot of buzz about their Hamburg Steak, their Pasta with Mentaiko (fish egg) Sauce and Hayashi Rice.

To start off the meal, we ordered the Yuzu Soda- a refreshing drink of Yuzu (japanese citrus fruit) syrup and bits of Yuzu rind, soda and a secret ingredient that the waitress wouldn't reveal.  In any case, it was the first time I've ever had this drink and boy, it was GOOD!  In a Kerr Mason jar, the portion was great!  I would come back just for that drink!

For Lunch, there was a set course menu for $15 which included a small salad, entree and the dessert with Siphon Coffee.  We were psyched that they served this style of coffee and since the waiter said the dessert was Tiramisu, it was a no brainer!!!

We added a small Tapas style appetizer to our set lunch- the Pork Belly, served with Cresson and Ginger, it was sandwiched in a flakey pie crust- definitely a french touch.  It was an ok Pork Belly, not bad but I would try something else the next time.....

For our main entrees, I ordered the Tororin (melt in our mouth) Omelet with Rice; a tomato based fried rice with chicken and fresh,  house made Tomato Sauce on top of an soft runny Omelet.

This is an absolute comfort food dish that whipped me back into my childhood....And I don't remember it being this good!  The tomato in the fried rice was sweet and tart at the same time, combined with the chicken and omelet, you couldn't satisfy your senses more than with this dish!

The other entrees that we ordered was the Hamburg Steak Japanese Style- with created Daikon (Radish) and Shiso (Japanese Sarsaparilla), served with potato wedges on a sizzling plate.

To be totally honest, this was not my favorite dish.  My recollection of hamburg steak is closer to a meatloaf-like soft consistency with the grated daikon added to the mushy texture.   This however, was overcooked and tough to cut, much less chew.  The Potato Wedges were fabulous tho, but alas, couldn't make up for the two boulders of ground cow that lay dead before us.....next time, I'll hop on over to Red Rock and gnaw on gravel..

Alas, one dish was a thumbs up, and one not so up..  But with the end of the meal coming to a close, the finale approached with promise and renewed hope.   The tiramisu came, and although the portion was tiny, it was an incredibly creamy and delicious dessert.  The siphon coffee came and I disappointed to see that the coffee already came in the mug, (I thought that it would be prepared at the table).  But looking back at the coffee bar, I realized that everything was made there.  Albeit my disappointment, it was a great cup of coffee- I enjoyed the aroma and taste and would most likely come back here for an afternoon pick me up!

Overall, it's a place worth trying a couple of times to explore all their dishes; not all of them hit it out of the ballpark, but when you get that one dish that does, boy, are you gonna chase that dragon!!!!

Must try the siphon coffee. It's a fascinating process. No sweetener or cream. It takes a long while to get it and is VERY hot. So I would order it right away.

Salmon tempura was great. We also tried salad, karage and lettuce wrap.

I got one dish, and it was seriously fantastic and unique.  I usually have good memory, but I can't remember the type of fish that was seared on it, anyway I want to say it was called the tanago sushi salad.  So it was seared tanago over a bed of lettuce.

To my delight, I felt like I stumbled onto a set for a Korean/Japanese drama when I entered this dimly lit oasis of coffee/Japanese diner heaven.  

The first thing that catches your eye are the funky beakers lining the bar which have coffee boiling or funneling their way in various directions that seem to defy the laws of physics.  This is an old school technique of brewing coffee called siphon coffee, which fell out of favor in the 60's but like it's fashion, was destined for a comeback.  Pushing up my metaphorical glasses a little higher, the process essentially involves expansion and contraction of water vapour which allow full saturation brewing at ideal temperatures on top of a cushion of air that seemingly defies gravity.  The end result is a pristine cup of coffee that is fragrant, aromatic, and clean on the palate.  I enjoyed both the hot and cold forms equally and I appreciated the considerate touch of being presented with a vial of honey to go along with the iced form for better incorporation of sweetness.  

The savory dishes (served with a simple house salad) all seemed like more sophisticated renditions of Western diner food ranging from the Neopolitan (Japanese spaghetti) to the hamburg steak with daikon and shiso (Japanese salisbury steak).  At the recommendation of the very gracious hostess, she suggested I get the Hayashi rice, or Japanese beef stew over rice.  Consisting of tender shredded beef, mushrooms, and onions likely slow cooked in a demi glace sauce, it reminded me of a cross between beef bourguignon and beef stroganoff: nice buttery richness with notes of red wine and sweetness from the caramelized onions.   Nice stick to your ribs comfort food that makes you forget you are eating out.    

The desserts unfortunately did not seem all that impressive, with an assortment of puddings and a ""coffee jelly"".  I tried a special green tea spongecake with taro cream and vanilla bean ice cream which sounded great conceptually, but didn't necessarily blow my mind and came in at a steep 7 dollars.  

In general, portions are adequate and the prices are slightly higher than what you would expect for a quick lunch (coffee is $5 and entrees are $8-9)  but the staff is very attentive to their customers from the moment you walk in to the time you leave,  and watching the chef add his little touches to the dishes behind the counter, you can really sense the pride in his work so I am willing to pitch in a little extra to help push this unique concept forward.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,4,5,4,HotMxkQRXjy314Lf0EMWkA

They have cute menu's and a large white board with the ""today's specials"" along with other items that they're serving that day as some go out of stock and they change it up a little.

The first time, I had karaage (which is fried chicken) and for the price I honestly expected a little more than just 6 pieces of chicken, rice, and a small cabbage salad. It tasted like regular karaage that you could get a fast food restaurant for only $5. There was no flavoring on it and I felt like I needed a sauce to eat it. The dessert I had was the yaki-imo which wasn't exactly fried, it was steamed, but it was still good.

The second time I went I had omurice, which is an omelette on top of rice, usually rice either cooked in ketchup or fried. In this case it was cooked in a tomato sauce which they make themselves. This was actually pretty good compared to what I had the first time. This omurice is different from what I have had in the past, the chef made a fried rice with ketchup and chicken, which made it taste better than regular omurice. The sauce is what made it pretty good for me, it's a homemade sauce that uses a tomato base. Some omurice use ketchup but others make homemade sauce. 

Based off the price of the food, I expected a little more taste from some of the foods. I don't recall what my friends had but I got to try some of it. I will definitely try it a few more times before making a final decision about the place. 

Also, they do have a stamp card but you have to spend $20 or more to get a benefit from it, personally I like to see it knocked down to $10 and just double the number of stamps required.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,2,1,3,ZonCWZO0547gYxxeHbH0Vg

These were prepared with a soy based glaze which had a nice chewy texture like gizzards and served over a bed of greens which had a sweet vinaigrette. I liked the hearts better than the Karaage which I thought was just okay.

I've been a huge fan of Japanese style Curry ever since visiting Japan back in my college years, and loved going to the curry houses (and Ramen houses, and Katsu houses, etc.) They have a spicy version here at CDJ, and I didn't mind, since I had my mind set on the Katsu Curry. The Katsu was good, but not as juicy as I would have liked,
but I loved the curry, rice, and the pickled vegetables accompanying the dish. The spice level gave me the sniffles but we had the totally refreshing Yuzu Soda to help calm the heatwave.

 We ended our meal with an iced siphon coffee which was HELLA STRONG, and a Yaki Imo(sweet potato) Cake which came with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and almonds. It was okay, but not something I'd order again. I do look forward to visiting again to try more of their savory items....ALOHA!!!

This place is a marriage of all things that I love - which is great japanese cooking by chef owner Kiichi Okabe (he used to work at Sushi ROKU), affordable pricing (everything is under 11 bucks, I think), and small mom/pop type places. 

Located in one of a million Asian plazas in the Vegas Chinatown area, we found parking very easy and just sauntered in. A very nice Japanese woman took us to our seat and presented us with the menus. We had the great 15 dollar prix fixe meal which gave us a small app (agedashi tofu), a small salad, one lunch entree, and the normally five dollar siphon coffee. I got the hamburger steak with egg on top (score!) and wife got the hiyashi rice, which was essentially beef stew on top of rice. 


I LOVED the agedashi tofu. We spoke with the chef and he said he uses something called ""kuzu"" which is native to Kyoto, Japan for the sauce he flavors the tofu with. this is not your average agedashi tofu, from its artful presentation to the way it was perfectly cooked.. firm and not mushy but not too dry and fried either. 

the steak and hyashi rice were done with care, and you can tell Chef Okabe takes pride in his cooking, and this is probably what real home cooking is like in Japan, not like home cooking in Fat America, which consists of a Big Mac and fries. 

Anyone who loves Japanese food has got to go here when they are in Vegas. I will go Banzai on yo' ass if you don't.

Note... for the fatties in Vegas..the portions are just right..not small, but def. not overloading on the calories. Sure, you can order two entrees, but do you really want people to stare at you and make oinking sounds? I think not.",EiIAnrHEeghCf0rXwju1gA,2,2,5,2Pzsu_HyG1kZxfGm1vSKVA

You can tell how genuine he is from how much he cares about his restaurant and his customers. He took the time to tell us about his experience in the restaurant industry and his Japanese origins. Chef Kiichii loves his restaurant and effortlessly offers a great experience for those who are fortunate enough to try his dishes. 

We had the spicy mackerel which was just delicious. The Karaage which was pretty amazing as well and you get a good sized portion for $5.00 (Appetizers are usually overpriced and quite small in my opinion...not the case) We also had the house dumplings which were lightly fried for that slight crisp...just delightful.

One nice thing they do that I will try next time is a ""customized"" curry.  You decide, on a checklist, the toppings, extras, and spiciness level of the curry.  Or maybe I will try their pasta carbonara.

This was our first kissaten experience and we were encouraged to check it out by our friends in Japan who were curious to see how it was translated here.  Even though I've never been to Japan and experienced one, we enjoyed our inaugural visit. 

We over-ordered (as usual) so we could cover more ground on our first visit -- 

had the chef salad (love the pepper dressing!), the omelet with chicken fried rice, their hamburg steak - Japanese style with daikon and shiso, and curried chicken. 

Our favorite was the hamburg steak.  It came with a side of potatoes, as well -- and a side salad with onion dressing.  I'm really looking forward to going back again for this dish - they served it differently as a special - with a panko coating that sounded great, too -- as well as with a demi-glace gravy.  But the Japanese version made it feel less hamburg-ery...if that makes sense.  

We also had their ""pudding of the day"" which was a wonderful creme caramel - perfect in texture, flavor, presentation.  

Their siphoned coffee was fun to watch.  We sat at the counter - it does take a few minutes so be patient.  I actually wish we'd waited to have it with our dessert.  Served with French sugar cubes, both brown and white, and real cream, this is singularly the best cup of coffee, I've ever tasted.  

We missed meeting the chef, but his wife was lovely and waited on us...making our coffee and taking our order.  We were enchanted with her...and look forward to returning...

They're open from noon to midnight weekdays - and on Fridays and Saturdays opened til 2...closed Sundays.  

Similar menus, but priced a bit lower for lunch until 3...Sandwiches coming onto the menu at lunch this week -- we were told to by our Japanese friends to look for their ""mixed"" sandwich - which is a traditional kissaten specialty -- egg salad, with ham and cucumber...which I could make myself, but much rather have someone else make for me -- what a treat.

However it is a bit to basic for me.  If you are a Japanese curry fan then this is a must it is authentic I however do not prefer it.  This place reminded me of my trip, which I enjoyed but I enjoy more seasoning, flavor and spice.  The specialty drink is a refreshing Yuzu Soda quite good may go back for that.

The decor is awesome and as another reviewer said earlier it reminded me of sitting at a cafe on a side street of Tokyo.  The service was quick and pleasant the bill reasonable.  

I am not taking stars away for my personal preference, the food is what it says it is on the menu.  If it does not meet with my personal preferences that does not warrant taking away stars.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,3,2,4,ADOFL4wxsFVLM5M7fQm8Ig

4371799,2012-11-29,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"This place is slowly becoming my favorite Japanese restaurant. The kissaten-style really tickles my girly fancy. My first visit here was probably less than a month since their opening and I ordered their Hayashi Rice and flourless chocolate cake. I felt a little jipped with the chocolate cake since it was too small for the price I paid. 

My second visit was a month ago (yeah, huge gap) with some girlfriends of mine and got their Katsu-curry. I think for the month of October I went on a katsu-curry rampage and tried as many establishments who offer this dish as possible. Cafe de Japon's katsu-curry did not disappoint. The katsu was crispy yet firm, and the curry was deep with spice and flavor. I also tried their yuzu soda for the first time using the 25% off deal with a Yelp check-in. I'll admit I'm not a big fan. Maybe I'm just sensitive to citrus rinds *shrugs* I also tried their pudding for dessert. I really miss Japanese purin from my childhood and wondered if this place could help satiate that nostalgia. The caramel was a little burnt, but the custard pudding itself tasted really good. It didn't jiggle as much, but it was a big serving of pudding so I guess that made up for the tiny chocolate cake I had on my first visit. 

The last time I went here was Saturday after the Thanksgiving/Black Friday holiday and just wanted a relaxing early dinner. I shared a siphon coffee with my best friend and fairly enjoyed the smoothness of the drink. I opted for the Tororin Omelet Rice since I got a bite of it from my second visit and have been dreaming about it ever since. I've tried omurice at other places but found it a little salty and lacking in flavor. Cafe de Japon's was everything I remembered it to be, egg-y (in a good way) and definitely tomato-y with chicken bits mixed in with the rice. Awesome! I also shared a tiramisu with the bestie and it was pretty good. Can't really say much since I've never really been a fan of tiramisu (I know, blasphemy).",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,2,0,4,XeHudx_yhhPYPB4mnI2v2g

Environment- this place made me feel so at home! Random & cute toys at the bar, plush vegetables sitting against the chairs, bookcases filled with manga, and Japanese curtains covering the windows that made me feel like I was in someone's home in Japan. Something about it made me feel very cozy & comfortable being there :-)

Food- Tastes like simple but delicious home-cooked meals! Fusion between Japanese and European food. I had the oyako don (about $9) which was just eggs, onions, and chicken over rice. How could something so simple taste so good? I'm not a big fan of rice, but I gobbled up my whole dish, which was rich and flavorful. Also came with a house salad and soup. Check in on Yelp and try their Yuzu soda- it's really unique! Tasted like soda w/ kumquats.. 
Unfortunately I was too full for any dessert.. but they do have a variety of green tea desserts.. and I love green tea so I'll definitely be back for those!
Do like their Facebook for updates, the owner is always adding and trying out new menu items.

Service- the owner was sweet and attentive. You can tell he really loves his restaurant and cares for his customers. Upon checking out, he urged us to like their Facebook page for a 10% discount and asked if we had a student ID for their Summer Student discount- which was really nice of him!

I rarely, very, very rarely eat Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc. With the exception of sushi. I don't know, call me a white-bread-eatin' American? The thing is I am excited to try new culinary cuisines, but Asian-inspired dishes just are not my cup of tea for some reason. The spices, the tastes... they just don't hit my palette like Italian and Mexican dishes do.

With that being said I think Cafe de Japon is A-OK. It would probably be bumped to 4 stars if I truly enjoyed Japanese food. On my trip here I had the Pre-Fixe lunch menu. It came with a small salad - very good and fresh. Next was the agedashi tofu appetizer, which I thought was okay. I'm not a huge tofu fan, and even this hearty dish failed to get me super excited about it. For my main course I had the tororin omelet with rice. It was hearty and rich, plus the ketchup gave it a taste as though it had been cooked in a kitchen at a home. 

Lastly I had the siphon coffee, which was FABULOUS. I would come back for the coffee, but probably not anything else.

I started off with the yuzu soda, and I was so pleasantly surprised at its deliciousness with real yuzu rind in the bottom of the glass.  I also got the agedashi tofu for my appetizer.  It was one perfect square of homemade tofu topped with grated ginger, scallion, and bonito flakes with almost a gelatinous dashi sauce beneath.

Philip and Ayumi shared their beef tongue stew appetizer, which was very tender and rich.  My DH ordered the hayashi beef stew with rice - it said it came with vegetables but he only got a few onions, so it was a bit plain.  He was a good sport since the menu mostly had fried or spicy food, even the specials, and that is not his forte.

I got the hamburg steak with daikon and shiso garnish.  The flavor was decent but the daikon was surprisingly more pickle-y tasting than fresh tasting to me.  The potatoes were simple and okay.  I ate everything on my plate though!  It was a unique meal for sure.

Philip had his staple the tororin omelette with fried rice and tomato sauce, and Ayumi got her favorite, mentaiko pasta.  Ayumi ordered a beautiful pineapple ravioli encasing ice cream with fresh berries for dessert, which she graciously shared with us when we discovered how good it was!

Overall, it was a really neat experience and great atmosphere.  We got to meet the chef and talk to him, and learned a lot about Japan from our dining companions.  Between a weekend of meals at Blue Fin, Japan Creek, and Cafe de Japon plus the upcoming yelptern night at Nakamura-Ya, I think me and the DH are ready for our vacation to Japan this May!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,5,3,4,QuO0I8lGRHeMaeT82SNZvg

This is a cute little cafe in the same plaza as Cathay House and Rincon de Buenos Aires. When you walk in, you're greeted with the by-now-familiar ""irasshaimase."" We found our way to one of the tables along the outside wall, beneath the row of hand prints in plaster.

Among the three of us, we shared some Karaage ($5), a plate of Vegetable Curry Rice ($6.99), and the Tororin Omelet ($9.99). I guess we're not fans of Japanese curry because we weren't very impressed with the curry rice; it was mostly heat and not very much flavor. I'm hoping this was an anomaly.

On the bright side, the Karaage was extremely flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly tender (and piping hot on the inside). The Tororin Omelet was also extremely good. It kind of looked like a gigantic piece of tamago sushi. The omelet itself was still runny on the inside, so be forewarned if that turns you off.

As for drinks, I was the only one who ordered something. Reading reviews from Christopher S and Philip T, I was intrigued by the siphon coffee and had to give it a try (after initially ordering a can of Calpico and not opening it). The brewing process looks like a chemistry set (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw?select=bpdXofQNObyw5hqrmFgV1A). I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any stretch, but it was definitely worth ordering. After some cream and sugar, the flavor of the coffee was very smooth.

The tempura was awesome, my favorite tempura so far. The batter is not overwhelming, the portion size is just right for an appetizer and the sauce is great.

Kaki Age Ball is just a mix of tempura'd veggie goodness sitting in a delicious broth. Get your own!

As for the Black Bean Pork Belly, it stole the show tonight. Delicious Pork belly simmered for up to six hours and served over a puff pastry with that excellent black bean sauce drizzled over it. Seriously so good I should have ordered two from the start. Ended up ordering one more for dessert.

The Karage meal was excellent as usual. I'm so happy I found a place that doesn't fry the Karage to jerky or deep fry some grissle and try to pass it off as meat.

The Bolognese is true to the name. There was almost a full hamburg steak in that sauce. Perfect acidity IMO.

The place was totally empty but very cozy inside. Their menus are quite creative looking haha We got the lunch special curry ($9.99) with chicken katsu and hamburger steak.. And some Yuzu soda to wash it all down with.. The curry plates came with the soup of the day which was some creamy corn soup and a little side salad that was ice cold. I guess if you get the lunch special curry you can only go up to spicy level 3 but that was more than enough spice for me! The yuzu soda comes in a big mason jar it's more bitter than sweet but I liked it... Usually $5 but I used my 25% off check in offer ;]]] The server was very polite and attentive and he even brought out some hot sauce and pickled onions for us.. I think they are just a little bit more expensive than Zen but the complimentary side salad and soup make up for that difference..

Over all I think Zen curry is more pleasing to my palette. And I love how they have all the toppings at the table readily available to you. The chicken is also more tender at Zen.

The interior of the place has a Japanese feel to it, creating a wonderful atmosphere. In addition to the interior, they played various Japanese songs the whole time! 

Upon looking at the menu, I saw that they have various Japanese dishes such as Hayashi Rice, variations of hamburg steak, Curry (Vegetable, Beef, and Chicken), as well as various pasta dishes. Besides the items on the menu, there are daily specials listed on a whiteboard. 

I decided to order the yuzu soda ($5) , since many other yelpers have suggested it. I had no idea what to expect, so my first sip was definitely a surprise. The flavor was definitely unique, but tasted great. At the bottom of the glass there are yuzu rinds, which add to the great, light flavor of the drink.

For an appetizer I decided to order a Potato Korokke ($3.50). The Korokke was a perfect golden brown color and looked very appetizing! The dipping sauce, which I'm pretty sure was the same as the tonkatsu sauce, complemented the Korokke perfectly! Upon my first bite, I was amazed at how perfect the crispy breading tasted along with the potato. I definitely recommend trying this, but be sure to let it cool because it is very hot upon serving ( I burned my mouth because it was too delicious to put down !).

After that, I decided to try the curry katsu ($11). The breading on the katsu was perfect and had just the right amount of sauce to make it flavorful, without taking any flavor away from the curry. The curry was a spicy chicken curry that I would not recommend to anyone who can't handle anything but mild. It is pretty spicy, so be sure you can handle it before ordering. 

For dessert I decided to try their chocolate parfait ($7). The chocolate parfait consisted of whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, crushed wafers (almost like a crushed ice cream cone), a couple pieces of chocolate candy, and two cookie sticks (they are rolled paper thin wafers with chocolate in the middle). The parfait was absolutely delicious, definitely a must have if you love sweets.

My wife and I have done many an omakase at Sushi Roku with Kiichi creating so many amazing dishes so we were positive his very own restaurant would be a smash.   

I lived in Japan for 2 years and the atmosphere here is definitely one of the top 2 ""feels like I'm in Japan"" places in LV with Ichiza being the other. All the dishes you would expect from a kissaten are here so we dug in.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissaten

We started by splitting the chef salad which came with a great dressing along with a complimentary side of macaroni gratin. The gratin was so tasty! It was like one the best mac and cheeses I've ever had. We were actually scraping the burnt cheese parts on the side of the bowl. 

Entrees were the hamburger steak and tororin omelet (see pics). Both were excellent with a couple of twists to the dishes I hadn't had before. The hamburger steak was mixed with rice instead of bread crumbs and still worked awesome. The ketchup on the omrice wasn't your typical bottled stuff and complemented the fluffiness of the eggs and the oh so good chicken fried rice. 

Dinner was a little late for us so we didn't have a chance to try the pudding or chocolate parfait desserts since they were out by the time we were done. Just another great excuse to come back! 

I'm not a coffee drinker but this is a must go place if you are. Siphon coffee is this whole crazy process of coffee thing I'm unable to explain but you got to check it out. My wife was able to try the hot and iced and loved them both. There's quite different flavor to each of them. 

The chef mentioned he's getting a full liquor license which will open up a whole new bunch of menu options including serving dishes that go better with alcohol.  This place is going to get even better in the future!  

Good lord..how long is the wait going to be for a table here in 6 months??  I cringe.  We better go back asap.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,18,13,5,J6czCAf3zcR3Nkl9xEF-9Q

5664912,2013-04-14,1,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"When looking for a restaurant there are three things that make me want to come back more than once. First, it has to be food that we cannot easily make at home. Second, the quality of product has to be exceptional. Last, it has to be reasonably priced for what you get.
So far to date there is only one restaurant in the Las Vegas valley that exceeds all of my three criteria; it's called Café De Japon. It seems that I am not the only one that feels this way.
I first heard about them in the Las Vegas weekly. The restaurant is clean and open. With minimal seating they can probably seat 90 people if they squeeze everyone in. It is warm and inviting. The chef who is also the owner greats you when you first walk in from behind the counter, he takes the time to learn your name. One of the three staff that they have will seat you either at a table or at one of the counter seats. At the counter you can watch the chef prepare the cold dishes, like sushi or Carpaccio. 
The owner only brings in the best of ingredients. The restaurant has a regular menu but the specials are what you should come to this place for. They have a big white board with all kinds of words written on it, a lot of them you will not recognize. I had to ask the chef a few times how to pronounce and describe what goes into the special dishes. With these specials he brings in fish from other countries and states. Fish that we cannot easily obtain at home in our local grocery store. That meets my first criteria of a restaurant that I'd like to return to.
 The chef will not serve any of this fish unless he would eat it himself. The freshest vegetables are used. The quality of meat is superior to anything that I could buy in the super market. They also have a variety of drinks like a yuzu soda. I have never had this drink anywhere else in my life and would not even know where to begin to look for it anywhere else. It's made from a fruit called a yuzu fruit. It is so exotic that it is only found in remote parts of East Asia.
While many reviews online say that the restaurant is overpriced, I think the cost is worth it. I leave full and every time I feel like I've had one of the best meals of my life for under eighty dollars. I know it seems that eighty dollars is a lot of money for two people to eat, but the different flavors and textures that you get to have is worth it. The quality is great, the price is reasonable and the food is good quality. It meets all my criteria for returning to a restaurant, over and over.",s7gMQwX2zansoCEXzvulvQ,4,2,5,sBeYbwgjmssV1JMzwfRZOQ

During my first visit, I mostly tried their desserts but like I said, nothing really stood out there. Desserts get to me after awhile, anyway.

On my second visit, I tried the Neapolitan spaghetti. It didn't taste like anything special, just simply spaghetti with their sauce and whatnot.

I don't know when I'll be back here as I was brought there by friends both times but it's still worth a visit if you've never been.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,3,rn-upTTleUrt5Vp7OBEakg
5753033,2012-09-20,2,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"After slurping up some cool soba noodles at I-Naba, my wife and I checked this place out for dessert. This place was quaint and cozy, but eerily quiet inside. There were a couple of other people in there on a Saturday afternoon. We greeted warmly by everyone though, and made us feel welcome.

The young waitress brought over the menu, and we decided to get a couple of desserts -- the one with the sweet potato, ice cream, and chocolate. For the other one, we tried the ""pudding,"" which was essentially flan. The pudding was refreshing and not too sweet. The sweet potato dessert was definitely unique. The starch from the sweet potato, which was still warm, was an interesting contrast to the ice cream and chocolate.

I also took advantage of the Yelp check-in offer of 25% off the yuzu soda -- regular price at $5, so it knocked it down to $3.75. It came in a huge glass mason jar (with a ton of ice, though) and had a great bubbly, citrus flavor. I loved all the bits and pieces of the rind at the bottom of the jar. The drink was definitely the highlight of the visit.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,2,2,3,nJGM5-vfxnTYlhCMIge4Ww
5758925,2011-09-17,2,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"The rating should be $$$ for prices.

Went there because I get eblasts from Raku (Chef Owner Mitsuo Endo) and recommended his fellow carpenter friends' place: Cafe de Japon. It just opened so when we were there, there was a small crowd and at one point my family were the only customers. 

OK, the Hamberg Japanese style was tasty, I especially enjoyed it. Had two patties, potatoes and carrots. Good flavor, with daikon, so every bite seemed to make you more hungry if that makes sense. It doesn't come with rice, so that was $3 extra for a small dish (yea it came in a dish, not a bowl...very weird...and the fact that rice is extra, wow). This was $13 so my meal was $16. Wait...there's more...I also got the yuzu juice (citrus fruit) which was good but was $5. It came is a medium sized glass with lots of ice and on the bottom of the menu, it reads, no refills except for iced tea. Two sips and my drink was half full...crazy. That's $21 then.

My family had the Hamberg demiglaze with egg (a special it was okay at $13), the Hayashi rice (beef stew like, it was good $9), and my wife had the curry (at $9 I think). The curry was disappointing...the spice was great but something about it didn't taste right...maybe we're just used to Curry House's (L.A.) flavor, or even Ichiza's? It just seemed muddled. We also got the crab pasta croquette which came with two pieces of shrimp (nothing to write home about, just fried food). 

For desert, we had the chocolate strawberry parfait ($8) and the coffee jello (can't remember, about $5-6) and then wanted to try the siphon coffee ($5). The deserts weren't special enough to really ask for those prices. Ichiza serves more unique Japanese deserts like their honey toast and that's worth it. As for the coffee? It was very good. We thought that they were going to bring the siphon over to the table and make it there but they just plopped over a cup...think they could've gained more points with presentation if they did that. UCC Coffee in L.A. comes to mind, tasted like it was blue mountain beans. 

So. Was it worth it? The food was good but IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE for what it was. Our bill was $97. I know we ordered a lot but that should've been about half the cost. Touting as a cafe, which is suppose to be casual, the prices are really meant for higher end Japanese joints. For example, like Raku. I can only imagine the owners of Japon were highly influenced by Raku's owner, since they are friends, but they are not in the same caliber. I'm not saying the food isn't good, but to ask for these prices at what's offered? I would rather go to Ichiza on Spring Mountain or Kyara at Jones. 

It's too bad, I'd go often for the coffee if it wasn't so expensive. To be fair, they are new so maybe they're just testing out their structure still. If you're listening, the prices should be about $2-3 less for each item (this is includes the DRINK MENU!!!). I think more people will flock if that was the case.",-YLiMJ0xeWxqny9O9YKzoA,2,1,3,FpmHgyCiKU8O0nB4khd2QQ
5765745,2013-09-27,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Can't go wrong with homemade Japanese curry.  I love Curry House and the curry at ramen houses in the Mitsuwa food court and little Osaka.  I've been eating curry since stationed near Hiroshima in the military so have a personal attachment and fondness for it, with the complex layers of spices and richness which goes so well with the texture and neutral blandness of rice.  I've seen Morimoto on Iron Chef make curry from scratch a couple of times, and always wondered if it would be different from other recipes.  Having researched Japanese curry, I have a basic understanding of its evolution from Indian curry (where it originated), Chinese (soy sauce and garlic based), Thai (coconut milk based) and Japanese (spoiler: Japanese curry uses cocoa!).  There's so much going on in Japanese curry, it's really a blend of some of the most interesting spices that has somehow reached a perfect balance of flavor.  

The cool thing about this place is you really get to personalize how you want your curry and what goes into it, similar to Curry House CoCo Ichibanya.  You get to choose the spiciness, the meat or vegetable, and the quantity of rice.  There's something about their curry though that makes it really tasty here.  I'd have to make a side by side comparison between this place and Curry House though, as I didn't really care for CoCo Ichibanya, mainly because their meat was overcooked.  But for now, I think this place wins in the taste department, I wanted to lick the plate when I was finished.  Also, the yuzu soda is a definite must have to wash down a spicy order.",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,3,2,5,h_8LMMDZHEPc-quhPYzkhA
5800784,2011-10-15,0,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Food: This is such a refreshing change from Americanized Japanese food. The hamburg steak is more vinegary than usual, and I liked it a lot. My other favorite is the ginger pork, which was served as glazed pork chops with a shredded lettuce salad. The glaze was delicious and the pork was nice and tender. Also, it's the only place I know of that serves Japanese-style parfait (not the yogurt kind). It had ice cream, Pocky, cookies, cream and corn flakes at the bottom.

Service: Friendly and attentive. One time, the chef decided to attend to our table personally. He's a nice guy :)

Ambience: Clean and cozy. The chef likes to play slow, soothing Japanese music late at night, which I don't like because it puts me to sleep.",tbwm5iT2uK-Hz4sEYgJdLA,5,2,5,jI1qaKPnVQ5NQXk7ibNHAA
5918735,2011-08-30,2,O85iR6k-pDHpRFwXlppdSw,"Nice cozy restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd, a little west of the old SF market but before Lindell.  It took over the same location from 2010 Fusion Restaurant.

Cafe de Japon is a very Nippon atmosphere, just like Philip T mentioned in his review.  Perhaps because the ladies working in the front are both Japanese, the outfits they wore, and even how the dishes are presented and served all reminded me of my previous visits to Tokyo. It reminds me of those small mom-and-pop type restaurants, that you randomly find wandering around the ""suburbs"" of Tokyo just a few blocks from the subway stations, serving up their menu of specialties.  Its only missing the salary men and the office ladies with their elegant heels

The simple menu here is very close to what I would want to serve if I did open up my own small restaurant... curries, katsu, and other traditional Japanese comfort food/family staples. So I am glad an established chef had similar idea and implement it.

Anyway, I had a half order of the Chef's Salad, which was simple but delicious. The creamy salad dressing had a nice peppery taste.  I also ordered the Hayashi Rice (beef and onion stew with a rich demi-glace and tomato sauce taste, which is a popular ""Western-style"" dish served in Japan).  This particular version does not have mushrooms, which would make it that much more awesome, but is still very good.

I passed on the siphon coffee, even thought I was eyeing them wrapping the individual glasses up to put in the walk-in cooler.  I blame Joe Biden's visit to City Center tomorrow, for having to be at work extra early at 1am, so the secret service details can perform their security protocols.

The pudding of the day also looks good.  And they have a Yuzu soda that sounds interesting.

Definitely have to come back to try more!

Note: no refills on the beverages, except iced water.  And the are closed on Sundays.  Be sure to check out their specials of the days too.

Food:  4/5  Good flavor, sensible portions, nice traditional presentations.

Price:  3/5  Will not break the bank, but thought it was priced higher than expected for this type of food (relative to LA's JTown, Gardena & Torrance - all significant Japanese American population centers in SoCal)

Location:  5/5  On Spring Mountain (between Decatur and Lindell), so fairly centrally located for most.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  Nice elegant feel, love the marbled countertop seats and the selection of JPOP.

Parking:  5/5 Never had problem finding parking here, and they have spaces reserved for their guests right outside their door.
