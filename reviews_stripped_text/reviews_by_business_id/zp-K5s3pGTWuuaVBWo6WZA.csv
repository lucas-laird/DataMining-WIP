He arrived to pick it up and there was a very long line -- no problem; he had expected that. The problem came when he finally got to the counter and gave them his order confirmation number for the turkey and the pie. They told him you couldn't reserve a pie online. Well, their system sure allows you to do so, and my husband had his printed confirmation to show them, which he did. But they rudely told him that it didn't matter. So he left without the pie he ordered a month in advance, after waiting in line longer than people who did not place orders, and after being treated rudely. What is the point of ordering ahead if they won't honor it? We won't ever be back.",xtDU9TGnKQOQPQ49cuQ7CQ,0,0,1,UxwOxRyT6M6tDldOC1zcmQ

791990,2017-06-11,0,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,"Pros: Sandwich was good. Lot's of Ham and Fresh. Good Customer service.
Cons: Limited Choices in Bread. All They have is Croissants, and a Bun for White Bread Options.. But No White Plain REGULAR bread. Multi-grain/Questionable grain is all they have. Limited Choices in Sandwich meat (If you aren't a Ham fan you won't find many options besides the Roast beef) 

Experience was good here. Was quite busy when we came in. Got a Carrot Cake that was WAY too sweet however.. The Cake icing was thick,full and sweet. More like a Butter Cream frosting than a Cream Cheese Frosting. More Sugary tasting than Cream Cheese. 

Really disappointed by that! (The Guy said this was the Less sweet Option from the Belgian Mousse..) The Taste of the cake itself was just so-so. Not Memorable or worth buying again.  Not going to buy it again or any of their cakes but will stick to getting a Sandwich every now and then.

I can't stress it enough that this Cake is so thick ( The layer on top & the Layer in the middle between the cake)with this sweet icing that you probably won't be able to eat a full piece in one sitting. Family all agreed there was just too much icing on it.  The icing is the thing you taste more than the cake as the cake lacks flavor and they try to make up for it with this sickeningly sweet icing.

The Cake is also covered in pieces of Pecans that make a huge mess everytime you take it out of the Box..I didn't taste any pineapple in it(as listed online) or any of the very distinct spices of a typical Carrot cake. Overall 2/10",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,0,0,2,iRuYGhmdU9m30nuQdVCKrw
1057551,2017-11-28,1,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,"Full Disclosure: I do not eat ham and I did NOT eat the ham from Honey Baked Ham (HBM). So I cannot speak to its quality, taste, or flavor.

What I can speak to is the ease of purchase.

I arrived around noon the day before Thanksgiving to grab a ham for the holiday table. There were two lines, one for people who had preordered (and presumably paid), and another for the last minutes slackers who were coming to grab a ham for the table. The winding line moved very quickly (approx. 20 minutes) and I spent my time trying to understand he size/cost options. 

When I arrived to the counter, I was able to communicate with a knowledgable and surprisingly patient employee who helped me get the most bone-in ham for my money. 

There are directions on the metal foil instructing you how to maximize your ham eating experience. I spent $44 for a quarter bone-in-ham and a pan of frozen rolls (don't get me started). The ham was well received and easily fed our small group with some leftovers.  

I am not a fan of ham. But I am a fan of great service and responsive businesses. I like what they are doing at HBH.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,3,3,4,hUKqbuh7F2L9UZVGVvJwtg

Sandwiches are huge, soups are good (particularly the potato and the ham/cheese), and they have several grab and go items as well.

Join their e-club for a coupon for a free ham sandwich- it's gigantic, probably what killed Mama Cass. You'll get another on your birthday. This particular location has a Yelp check-in offer for a free soda + chips, so grab a cup of soup and this can easily make two lunches for under $4. I feel like the turkey is even better than their namesake ham sando, but they're both large and fresh. The ham has a honey-mustard sauce that adds just the right amount of sweetness.

Service is polite, location is clean. I won't line up around the block to buy a full size ham here, but it's not bad for lunches. They also have pies and various condiments/seasonings for sale as well.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,9,3,Gy7n0ebtTLUcVec_OMBcEA

There is something very festive about Honey Baked Ham. I mean I don't really think about it all until the holidays. But when you remember, it is like a stroke of genius.

Literally to serve the ham, you take it out of the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Done. No heating (unless you really want to). No fuss. That is it. Rather than stressing, you can actually enjoy the holidays. As a mom of a very active toddler, this place is a godsend. 

I took brought down to the office for a potluck too. It was awesome because there is no way we can heat much up at the office.

The hams taste great...the crusty topping is like a sweet and salty crack. Amazingballs.

The cost is not prohibitive but it isn't cheap either. A 10 lb half bone in ham cost around $70. ($7ish/lb) That being said, the sheer lack of effort to have an enjoyable family meal is priceless.

Just a note - ordering ahead of time on the phone is pointless too because they still have to look for a ham for you. Next time, I am going to order online as they have a separate line for only that. I probably would have saved some time that way.

We got some free sandwiches too by joining their club....they are delish! The tavern club is great and they don't skimp on meat.

I love Honey Baked Ham because cooking during the holidays is for the birds. Come on by and take the stress out of the holiday season!",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,2,4,tQI1O7kr3r_1DwfT-22cBg

2585294,2016-01-12,12,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,"The reason for my low rating for this location of HoneyBaked Ham is their customer service, or lack thereof. 

For a family gathering in Las Vegas, I pre-ordered a Ham online. On the drive to Las Vegas, I was making pretty good time so I called and asked if I could pick up my order earlier than I had initially requested. Who ever answered the phone wasn't able to answer my questions and I ended up holding for a few minutes until someone came on the line, who was able to. It didn't get any better - the person who came on the line was dismissive as she couldn't find my order even after giving her all the pertinent information. She ended up just telling me to come on in. 

Arriving at the store, I encounter a short line, which I didn't think much of - because how long could the wait be to place an order and pay for it. The wait ended up being about thirty minutes because four employees were helping one person. That person was either an employee or a regular because all of their attention was on this one person. She wasn't being difficult - she was just very comfortable speaking with and joking with the staff, annoying the rest of us in line because it's not we didn't have things to do, or places to go. When I finally get up to the counter, it didn't get any better because the person didn't know how to handle an online order leaving me to wait for another person who knew how to. 

The person who finally helped me wasn't able to find my online order either - but because there were a lot of Hams available, grabbed me one close to the size that I had ordered. Almost 40 minutes to pick up a ham, that was pre-ordered online is pretty bad customer service. It would be one thing if it were really busy, however, it wasn't. And employees who have no idea how to handle online orders is pretty bad in this day and age.

3901445,2016-11-30,2,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,"I had never been to honeybaked ham before, but had to feed 90 people for a Thanksgiving meal the day before Thanksgiving. We placed our order online a week and a half prior to the date. Ordering eight packages of roasted sliced turkey breast seem to be the best option. I got a confirmation email with an order number telling me where the location was, and when I could pick it up.

I found the location easily, and prepared myself for a massive line as I had been warned by others. The line wasn't bad at all it was inside there was maybe 15 people ahead of me and it was nearly 8 AM. Everyone in the line seemed jovial, and the staff was really doing everything they could to make everyone happy and get them out quickly.

When I approached the counter I gave them my order number and they had no idea what I had ordered. I pulled up a confirmation email and it did not say much except for the location and my order number. That shouldn't of been a problem if I had been the one to place the order, but I had no idea what I was picking up at the time. They didn't have a system where the orders were laid out, they had a list of the orders, or that they could look up to expedite my experience. It turned out that they needed to present me with all of my different options while I scrambled and try to get a hold of the person who had placed the order. 

Thank goodness the person placing the order got back to me while I was still at the location. Tayler and his team were very nice and really tried to help, but it seems that the business itself set them up for failure by allowing people to order online ahead of time but not telling the team what should be ready for being picked up. 

The food was fantastic and the price was OK. Tayler help me carry my bags out of the car and wished me a happy holiday. He made a situation that could've been pretty bad pretty awesome. I'll definitely be back, but I'll call in the order myself.",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,2,1,3,G1bBnlbju7Cf63BdtIwcHA

4259420,2011-02-07,0,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,"Excellent ham! There are several cuts: regular, mini, and miscut (slight discount). It's no surprise when the line is pretty much out the door during the holidays, not to mention wrapped around inside too. As was the case a few years ago, when I went with my mom. For years, many families here have enjoyed the delicious ham and turkey during Easter, Thanksgiving, & Christmas. Save the bone for Ham Bone Soup- it's so yummy. You can also buy the bone, but there is a limit of one to a customer. Many years ago, there was a location on Maryland Parkway, across from the Boulevard Mall, but that's showing how long I've called Las Vegas home.

Not only does this company have excellent ham, the turkey is excellent too (roasted, smoked). There are free samples of the turkey (both kinds) and other products. Sometimes the turkey is on special for $19.99 during the holidays. There are several other excellent products like the ham bone soup mix, mustard, pineapple chutney, and side dishes too. 

This company also makes yummy sandwiches. I got the Classic-  roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, savory sauce, mustard, on a soft sweet kaiser looking roll that smashes down as you eat it.  My husband likes the Smoke Stacker- ham, lettuce, minus the tomatoes which I end up getting, barbeque sauce, on a ciabatta roll (not overly big, which I hate getting). If you get the stamp card, you will get a free sandwich after purchasing 5 sandwiches. We got the combos (lots of choices- salads, chips, etc., and both cost a little over $16.00. FYI, if you have a gift card, don't separate the card from the card that it is attached to, or else, the gift card is no good- it states so on the card. 

Located in a strip mall on Rainbow, not far from Charleston. Small but clean store, with less than ten tables with chairs. Bathrooms are located in the small hallway to the left. In front of the bathrooms stands an automatic hand sanitizer station- neat. There are two counters (cashier, ham). One refrigerated section to the right as you enter the store. Small but clean location. The people working there were really nice. She messed up my order but gave us a free brownie for the mixup. There were no other customers before but after us, there
were a couple customers; not sure if this is typical for sunday morning.

Our family has really enjoyed the high quality specialty ham and turkey (among other things) that they offer, mainly during the holiday season.  No, this is not your garden variety type of meat; it's definitely higher-end, and the quality shows.

I decided on their Ham Classic sandwich ($6.49) on a flaky croissant with the basic toppings of tomato, lettuce, mustard.  The sandwich was very tasty and the ham...oh yes...really delicious as I remember. Super Yum! Maybe I'll order their turkey or even ham salad the next time I stop.

I of course Checked-In as they were offering a free soda and bag of chips, but the cashier didn't know what I was talking about, so I explained how it usually works.  The manager said, ""We don't do Yelp, but I will go ahead and give you the chips and soda for free.  The SKU on Yelp doesn't work in our system; not every store honors Yelp.""  Ok, thanks manager, much appreciated.

I found the store/café to be clean and bright, with various ads showcasing their specialties.  The various employees were helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,2,1,5,FD39hY0YCeTUuFHyKlTaAw

5848468,2011-12-26,2,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,"OK so this Christmas I decided to make things easy for myself in the cooking department, considering I just cooked a full on feast for Thanksgiving.

I decided to have a Honeybaked ham for my Christmas dinner and I will make all of the delicious sides which would be simple!

The Ham was delicious, picked it up the day before Christmas, yes waited in a 40 minute line, I was expecting that so no shock, lol.

It was $38 bucks for a ham that fed 8 people a generous portion, I think it was a great deal for taste, price and convenience.

You don't even have to bake or heat it up, simply pull it out and let it rest for an hour and you are ready to go. That is key that you serve this ham at room temperature!

I suggest making your own sides as they are costly and in my opinion their sides are not as good as what you can do on your own. They are called Honeybaked ham for a reason and that is what you should buy :)

All I had to do was my sides, green beans and bacon, brown sugar baked yams, and scalloped potatoes. It was an easy Holiday dinner and it left a lot more time for talking, snapping pics and laughing with family and friends!

I will be doing a repeat of this next year for my Christmas dinner!!!

I am a very happy customer!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,9,5,4,GngW7vmQfgFuHxMxq2tG1w

I arrived as soon as they opened the day before Thanksgiving to find that there were only about 5 people in line and they didn't pre-purchase online, I had, so I walked straight to the front of the purchased online line.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  Customer service was friendly and helpful and of course everyone enjoyed the ham I served.  Should I ever be crazy enough to host Thanksgiving again, I will be back!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,2,4,5,lYqa3Om2msdk4Ow_sjnvZw
5958612,2018-01-01,0,zp-K5s3pGTWuuaVBWo6WZA,Worst online order system ever.  Let me order a ham for new years eve for pickup after four.  Showed up at 4:17 and it was closed!!!  And the worst thing was not one person from the store called me to make me aware.  I understand that they close early but their online system should reflect pickup times that are correct according to holiday hours.
