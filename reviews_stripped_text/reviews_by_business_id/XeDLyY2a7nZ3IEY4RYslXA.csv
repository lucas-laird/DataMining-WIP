The hostess was very unfriendly and didn't talk...she just walked us to a booth, put our silverware on the table, and walked away.  The fabric in the booths is noticeably filthy and old.  Speaking of old, their website says they have award-winning beer.  What they don't say is the most recent award was 11 years ago.  We ordered a magnificent mile meat lover pizza.  Please change the name...it's not magnificent.  It looked like someone dumped a jar of pizza sauce on top of it.  It was very watery and soupy.

19587,2010-07-22,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Went here on a Wednesday evening to hit up the 5-7PM Happy Hour (5-7PM and 10-midnight, I do believe).  Parking lot was crowded, but the place was not.  Busy, but not like we expected from the lot.

Sat in the downstairs bar area, and got a table no problem.  Great service.  Our waiter kept checking on us, even though we took our sweet time looking over the menu.  Settled on an all Happy Hour fair.

The beer ($6 pitcher):  We got the All-Nighter first.  It was good.  A nice, light blonde.  As expected.  Round 2 was the seasonal All-Nighter (Sommerbrau, maybe?).  This one was better.  Definitely worthy of my ordering it the next visit.

The food (prices guesstimate, from what I THINK I remember):  They had Chicken Fingers ($5- mild, hot, bbq, teryaki), Chili Cheese Fries ($4), Spinach Artichoke Dip ($6), 10-inch thin cheese pizza ($5), and there was one other item, but I can't think of what it was.  We had the Mild Chicken Fingers (pretty tasty, and plentiful), Spinach Artichoke Dip with tortilla chips (good, have had better, but have had worse), and the cheese pizza (filled the void, but probably wouldn't order again).

Overall:  $30 total (incl. tip) for 2 people, 2 pitchers, 3 apps, all HH items.  Will be back for more.  Next time, I'm thinking we'll try the 10LB burger though.  Sounds yummy!  And as we left, we peaked our heads upstairs and will probably look to sit up there the next time, as the couches were full but the tables were empty.  I would just question the amount of service attention we'd get up there.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,2,1,4,QyK-9LMr-m4L98IyZVJEuA

As a group of 7, we were seating right away as the place was pretty empty.  The waitress came by right away to take drink orders.  They had a blueberry vanilla ale on the menu, but when we ordered it, the waitress said they didn't have it, and then recommended some sort other beer with mango.  I ordered that just because it sounded interesting, and it was pleasantly surprising.  However, I do not recommend drinking this if you are going to be eating a full dinner.  The beer was full bodied and filling.  We also ordered a brewtus which was a 50 ounce glass filled with a beer of your choice for $15.  (You get to keep the glass.)  We chose the All Nighter which we all shared and enjoyed.  I think the best part about the brewtus was that refills were only $5!  Food-wise, everyone seemed satisfied with their food.  The artichoke dip and alfredo pizza were the two things that I found to be really good.  The service was really good here.  By the time we ordered, the place got busy but the waitress still made it a point to come by every few minutes to check on us.  I'd like to come back for their happy hour.

124261,2011-08-16,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"I don't want to stray from my burger reviews with so many places in town yet to try, but I feel compelled to talk about an interesting meal I had last week.  My girlfriend and I wanted to try something different for dinner, and I quickly remembered hearing about the wild game sliders that they serve over at the Chicago Brewing Company. One thing I like almost as much as burgers is trying weird and new foods, this promised to do just that.

While I suppose I should come back to try their burger at some point, this establishment is more on the 'typical' pub food side, and isn't necessarily on the top of my list for burgers to review. Still, the wild game aspect was intriguing enough to drag me in. The interior of the restaurant as well as the bar side are nothing fancy, pretty standard faire for a local restaurant. We went there on a random week night around 6pm, and quickly decided that based on the large amount of families and screaming kids the bar side would be better for our needs. Even though there are high top tables away from the bar itself, you can still anticipate a smoky atmosphere with mediocre service. We waited a bit too long to get our menus and first drinks, but after that it wasn't too bad.

There are six wild game sliders on the CBC's menu, each paired with what the chef believes to be the perfect complement to that meat's flavoring. You have the option of trying 3 of one style, or all 6 for a little less than twice the price. Based on a slider meal we had a couple days earlier, we knew that 6 sliders between the two of us would be more than enough and would allow us to divulge in all flavors.

Here's the rundown:

Alligator: from what I'm told alligator meat has very little flavor, so it is always seasoned to give whatever dish it is served as more character. Having a connotation with the cuisine of the south, this one is quite over seasoned with Cajun flavors. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but you really don't get an idea of what alligator tastes like based on this. The soft egg, Remoulade, and other toppings paired well with this.

Antelope: almost too gamey for my liking, but quite good. The meat was pretty much what I anticipated it to taste like. Again the jalapeno jelly and toppings all paired quite well with it. The meat might have been a tiny bit dry, but I'm not sure how much of that is a natural trait of antelope meat as opposed to it being a slider which is always inherently dry.

Bison: I'm always a big fan of bison meat, and this didn't disappoint. I buy bison steaks quite often at Whole Foods, and have also been known to make a great bison burger with some of the ground bison meat from Smith's. Unfortunately we're not treated with different toppings for the remainder of the meats I will mention, but as I've stated already they paired well so why mess with a good thing.

Jackelope: possibly one of my favorites of the bunch. Wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but it turned out to be a great mix of two different meats, a little sweet with just the right amount of gamey. This one definitely stood out for me.

Rabbit: could have been my least favorite of the group. It seemed very gamey, stiff and dry, which I've heard should not be the case with rabbit meat. The dryness I could tack on to the slider size always being impossible to cook (see my review of Slidin' Thru coming soon), but I can't explain the gamey taste. Neither of us were really a fan, I think it was the only one that had a bite or so leftover.

Wild boar: a favorite of both of us. Picture a sausage patty, but the tastiest, purest form of that. I may not have gotten my full half of this one because someone else also really liked it, but what I had I enjoyed quite a bit.

Overall this meal was a lot of fun, the little signs on each patty are a great touch, and it's an easy way for the commoner to try something 'exotic' while still sticking with a familiar form. If you're feeling a little adventurous and want to try something different, definitely give them a visit. Their beer isn't so bad either.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,4,nxMhREIs96wb8ecZS61twA

229744,2013-11-03,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! The brewmaster does excellent work! I tried 6 beers: the stout, hefe, IPA, blueberry wheat, triple, and quadruple. All of them were excellent! I like trying breweries and craft brews everywhere I visit, and I usually find that each brewery has a couple of really good beers and a few not so good. At  Chicago brewing company, I did not try a single mediocre beer! This may be the best brewery I've been to, as the beers are across the board good, especially the triple and quadruple, which I hope they make permanent items. I typically do not like beers with fruit, so I ordered just a sample of the blueberry wheat. It was good, and the blueberry taste was neither fake nor overpowering. The food was decent, which is more of a bonus for me with a brewery. I had the happy hour chicken tenders, which were quite good. I then ordered some sliders, but I was so full from chicken tenders and beers, that I couldn't do much damage there. The sweet potato fries are waffle fries, and decent. The sliders were good too. My only disappointment was with the staff. The service was excellent, but when you go to a beer place, you expect to be surrounded by beer fanatics. Apparently the servers have a mild interest in beer at best. I still highly recommend this place to any beer connoisseur!

409044,2009-05-29,1,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Admittedly, 3pm on a Thursday afternoon may not be the ideal time to assess a brew house, but it's worth logging the experience nevertheless. While the atmosphere at the bar wasn't unfriendly, it wasn't friendly either. Nothing like, ""be with you in moment"" or ""what can I get you"", but rather a somewhat removed bartender going through the perfunctory motions of his job and getting to you when he was good and ready, although without malice or attitude. Beyond that, the place seemed generally cheerless with a scattered assortment of that discomforting and singularly Vegasian type of the damned you run into occasionally off the Strip, not quite consigned to the clear, uncontested merit of hell, but somehow more vague and less defined--purgatorial or limbo-esqu--half plowed, engaged in chain smoking and vapid, pointless, loud conversation, or even worse, simply voiding any meaningful existence, head down, playing countertop video poker machines. The beer was certainly decent and what food came out of the kitchen looked adequate (at best). As a friend noted hours later after we'd left and found ourselves five minutes into a visit to Big Dog's Brewery, ""I already like this place a hundred times better than the Chicago Brewing Company.""

541816,2016-10-09,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Went for first and last  time yesterday. I am from Chicago and went to watch the Cubs playoff game. We were excited to meet other fans, but disappointed to learn this is not really a ""Chicago"" establishment as the name implies. Different tables of us were given conflicting information about happy hour and about their policy on watching the game. We were told in the downstairs bar that they only provide sound for the game in the upstairs bar, so we had to move upstairs. That was fine, but once there we were informed that a private party had reserved the space, so we could not listen to the whole game. Another employee then told us that the party would be in a separate room and we actually could keep the sound. We specified that we needed to know for sure so we could decide whether to stay or go watch the game elsewhere and were reassured we should stay. So, we ordered more food and drinks and invited other friends to join us, bringing the group up to 6 people. It was extremely frustrating when employees then turned off the sound and we then had to watch several innings while listening to crap music instead. The bartender did take mercy and we were able to hear the final inning. The bartender was actually amazing, running drinks and food out to us from behind the bar even though he was the only one up there. The beer was good, pork sliders good, and pretzel bites were good. The caprese salad was disappointing, and the garlic bites were cold by the time they got to us.

I am not a HUGE fan of their food but I can tell you that their Spinach Artichoke Dip is KILLER and if you catch Happy Hour, you can get it for a helluva deal at $4 or so.

Their Happy Hour in general has a lot to do with why this is one of my favorite bars. They have traditional happy hour along with a reverse happy hour that starts at 10 and is good in the Beer Garden (fantastic outdoor patio with stringed lights) and the Loft (located upstairs and where you can find me a majority of the time). Their (tasty) brewed-in-house beer is 1/2 off and I think it's $1 off wine and well drinks, too.

The pizzas that I've had are good, although, I have to wonder what they mean by thin crust, Chicago pizza.  I don't think the menu writer has been to Chicago.  As to the idea of eating anything other than the pizza, forget it.

On a recent trip to Chicago Brewing, we got the steak sandwich and the Huli chicken sandwich.  The steak sandwich comes on a large roll with the steak inside smothered in some sort of mayonnaise based glop.  You would have to unhinge your jaw to take a bite.  No problem though, the greasy stuff they coat the steak with acts as a lubricant and with only a slight tilt, the top slides right off.  After I scraped off as much of the oily mess as possible, I took my first bite. I found the meat sufficiently tough that it would take a school of Piranhas about a week to consume.  Resorting to a knife, I chiseled my way to a second bite only to discover I was eating a solid piece of gristle.  Disgusting.  My waitress agreed and I was spared paying for this tribute to the lowest consumable grade of meat the USDA permits restaurants to legally serve. 

Then there was the Chicken sandwich.  It was so dry that I do not believe it could have been served in a place where smoking is permitted due to the imminent fire hazard posed by the flammable material found in the bun.  The skin on the chicken could not be pierced by anything short of an industrial laser, although,  I'm certain that any Texan would love to have a pair of boots made of this stuff.  Eating it, however, is out of the question.

797190,2009-06-24,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"I was in Sin City for an Allman Brothers show in Red Rocks Casino when I found this little gem.  Actually I always look for Brew pubs around any area I travel to and try to taste different beers.  I stopped in for lunch and some beers.  I sat at the bar positioning myself to see the Red Sox game.  There are plenty of big screens in this place and they have all the games.  The restaurant was divided between restaurant and bar, smoking was allowed in the bar but not in the restaurant.  This was a clean and cozy place which had an upstairs lounge,  The bar  had about 8-9 beers of their own beer on tap and I started off with the Ramblin Wreck amber ale.  This was a nice refreshing beer, ice cold and ran about 4.5% alcohol.  I then scoped the menu and quickly honed in the Filet Mignon Sliders, the thought of fillet sliders made me forget about the other things on the menu although I did see  Cheese Knots on the appetizer menu.......hmmm.  So, I ordered the sliders and my next beer reluctantly passing on the garlic-cheese knots(next time....).  Being a ""hop-head"", I ordered the Hard Play IPA.  Though not as strong as I thought, this beer had plenty of hops.
Being a Sunday afternoon, there were several locals playing video poker at the bar and some just getting plastered on Jaeger bombs at 1:30 in the afternoon.  After the barkeep carded and shooed away two under aged kids, he brought out my trio of goodness.  There sat in front of me three sliders made from fillet mignon loin, grilled onions and mushrooms served with au jus.  So I started to dig in, man what an experience and guess what I had three of these little morsels to satisfy me.  Too bad I was pressed for time or else I would have tried more of their beers.  This is a good place to hang out and the service was great.  I would definitely stagger back in here, even though it's about 11 miles from the stip.  In fact I might just drag the Buffet Boys to this place next month, when we take over Vegas.  Look for Buffet Boys invade Vegas.........................

874974,2015-10-24,3,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"This is the first time I've ever written a restaurant review. It's not anything I've felt compelled to do before, but after the experience I had at the Chicago Brewing Company I feel like it's my civic duty to warn others. We are new to the area, and after perusing menus online we chose the Chicago Brewing Company for our first outing because the menu we saw said they had wild game sliders. After we were seated we discovered they were no longer on the menu. We should have left then, but we'd already ordered a beer so we decided to stay. Instead I ordered the steak sandwich. My husband ordered the filet mignon sliders, and we got a couple of kids meals for our children. My husband and children's meals were bland, forgettable, and overpriced. How I wish I had anything that good to report about my steak sandwich. 

I love steak sandwiches. Anytime I see one on a menu I order it. This was the worst steak sandwich I've ever had. I had no idea they could even be bad until I had that one. I ordered my steak medium, and when it arrived it was so rare it was purple. I like rare steak, so I didn't send it back. The steak was much smaller than the roll it was served on, it had a pile approximately three inches thick of the white, flavorless part of a head of iceberg lettuce, and it was drowned in so much garlic aioli that it basically tasted like a garlic sandwich. You could barely taste the steak, which was too bad because maybe if we could have we would have realized it was rotten. The steak was covered with so much melted cheese that it appeared as though the Blob were attempting to digest it. At least the Blob could have digested it. My husband and I could not. My sandwich was so terrible that I gave it to my husband, who ate the steak only in an attempt to at least get our $14 worth out of the meal. We aren't generally complainers, and our waitress was nice, so we said nothing, tipped our waitress, left, and walked around the Village Square shopping center. I stayed longer, but my husband went home, where he proceeded to get violently ill. I hadn't eaten nearly as much of the sandwich as he had, so it took a little longer for my food poisoning to kick in. 

Later that night I called the restaurant to tell them so they wouldn't serve the steak to anyone else. The kitchen manager told me it takes six hours for food poisoning to kick in, which is a lie. He said the general manager would call back the next day. That was also a lie. I decided to look the Chicago Brewing Company up on Yelp, and that was when I noticed four other people complaining about being sickened by this restaurant. That makes me number five, and that's just five who bothered reporting it to Yelp. God knows how many people have actually gotten sick from this place. It's clear they must be keeping their food around long after it should have been tossed out. It's a tiny restaurant and it seems to mostly just be a place to eat while you are gambling, so their food turnover is probably not that high on certain items--one of which I'm going to assume is the steak. 

It's not a coincidence that people are getting sick there. Save your money and go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Ordering the Doritos Tacos Locos at the Taco Bell next door is less likely to sicken you and ruin the rest of your weekend, and that's saying a lot.",Q-jDPpmYzIa4Jx6Dld7kfw,10,1,1,i5b3JOM0rQh31JjwN0v4mg

 First off, I was recommended the Old Town Brown Ale. Absolutely fabulous! I must say that this beer was better than one of my tried and true favorites, Newcastle Brown Ale. (I never thought I'd ever say such a thing)

The pizza looked amazing but I was more inclined to try their BBQ burger, medium, of course. Very savory and delicious burger! I was absolutely enamored with the combination of burger and beer that I had ordered. I also had a chance to sample my friend's filet mignon slider and the au jus that it came with. Another fabulous choice! The burger was tender, juicy, and the au jus was excellent. Not over powering or to salty like some. Mouth watering!

The original bartender/server was friendly and we are pretty sure he was our awesome server from a year ago. However, when we finally got a table, our server was not friendly. I can understand being busy but courteous customer service shouldn't go out the door when you are having a bad night. As for the food, that was a headache. We ordered the garlic knots, filet mignon sliders, and the uptown roasted garlic chicken pizza. I ordered a bloody mary as well while my wife just had a beer. First, the bloody mary wasn't the most horrible I had in Las Vegas but it just tasted like tomato juice water. I received the pizza fairly quickly and it was okay. As it cooled, it tasted less great and more eh. My wife still hadn't received her sliders when I finished my fill of the pizza and I am a very slow eater. We had to inquire about the sliders and finally got them after ten more minutes. Even after my wife finished off the sliders which she found to be okay but nothing special, we still hadn't received the garlic knots, which should have been first. After waiting another ten minutes, we were done with the waiting, informed our server to cancel the order and that we just wanted a to go box for the pizza. He half heartedly tossed us a box and I watched as our server informed the chef of our cancellation which seemed to make the chef huffy, as apparently our garlic knots were finally done, forty minutes into our dinner.

1069135,2011-09-25,2,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Holy moly. I think I just ate an entire cow. And then some.

First off, heads up: If you're looking for a beer review, go check out Elite Emily's review. I'm not a huge beer drinker and can't really tell the difference between a stout or an IPA, I can't tell which one had more hops and which one had more malt. I'm even worse at beer than wine (and I'm pretty bad at wine), so if you're looking for that, sorry.

But if you're looking for a food review, I just had the Chicago Chili Burger. This thing should have its own ZIP code. It's huge. They serve a huge patty open-faced -- not even trying to hide it, like, ""Oooh, we put a tiny bun on top so it looks bigger..."" No, it was like, ""MAN UP, SPARKY, THIS AIN'T OUR FIRST TIME AT THE RO-DEE-O."" Then, on top of this delicious hunk of meat (the burger, not me) they pour on some sloppy, messy chili and green onions on top of it.

This is no sissy burger. This is not one of them chain restaurants ""Oh look we dropped a bit of chili on this burger"" burger. This is a burger that looks your daddy straight in the eye then makes out with your momma then slaps your sister upside the head while walking out your front door and fist-bumping with some very bad dudes.

Grab your fork. This burger ain't here to f**k around.

It was a test, but it was also really good. The meat was juicy and tender, and the chili was really tasty. It was a sweeter chili, since of course it was Chicago-style, so I wish it had a little more spice to it, but that would be my only complaint. Otherwise, A+, gold star, attaboy.

BUT WAIT! There's more!

One look at their dessert menu will give anyone a foodierection. I was looking at something called ""Blondie & Clyde"" which is like a mash-up of a brownie plus a butterscotch bar, but on the bottom of the page were their deep-fried treats. Elite Emily and I share a weird love/hate relationship with deep-fried anything, and she spotted the deep-fried carmel apple (which was either a caramel apple or an apple from Carmel, CA). Hector went with the deep-fried honey bun, and I couldn't be the odd man out, so I indulged in the deep-fried Ho-Ho.

I loved mine... the deep-fried Ho-Ho reminded me of a chocolate chip donut bar, and the deep-fried honey bun was like a bear claw. But I was most impressed by the deep-fried carmel apple. As you bit into it, you heard a ""crunch."" This is because somehow, after the apple is deep-fried, somehow it still comes out crisp and tart! It's really great, you have to try it to believe it.

Great place, I highly recommend it, under one condition: don't go see a movie right after it, because it's bound to lead to food coma.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,3,0,5,le04_FKxfYeZWyeI5e7Z2g

But the last couple of time I went, me & my guy sat in the bar. We went in the middle of the week & usually around 12 or 1 for lunch. I understand that the servers that wait in the bar area also have tables in the dining room area but they need to manage their tables better.

Our server was nice enough, a bit awkward & standoffish. He took our drink order & my guy wanted to sample a couple of their house beers which the server brought quickly enough. Then he went into the dining room & didn't reappear for a while. My guy had decided which beer he wanted to order but our server was nowhere to be found. No biggie, we waited & another server ended up asking us if we needed something. After we placed our order & my guy got his beer, the wait wasn't long for our food to come out. And boy was it amazing!

I've had their baked ziti with chicken (which I adore) & their pizza & both have been excellent but for lunch I love getting sandwiches from bars. So I ordered their hot pastrami sandwich (for the second time) & bf got their ""black & blue sliders"" & instead of regular fries, upgraded to their smokehouse fries. (Note: I may be wrong about the name of the fries. Basically it's steak fries with melted cheese, bacon, chives, creme fresh, & other stuff I think) 

The pastrami sandwich is awesome! It's served on marble rye bread (my favorite rye) that is crispy & crunchy & not at all soggy, the pastrami is perfect, and it comes with melted Swiss cheese & cole slaw (on the sandwich). The combination of the hot pastrami & the cool crispy cole slaw is divine. It's exactly the way a sandwich should be made. My hats are off to the cooks. My side was their regular fries which are pretty lackluster & bland. But I never care about the fries. 

Bf said the black & blue sliders were good (who can go wrong with steak & bleu cheese?) but that the ""smokehouse fries"" were not very good. I had a bite & they were alright but very sweet. 

The problem was what happened after we got our food. The server asked us if we needed anything else & we said no....and then he didn't come to our table again until we made it obvious we needed him. He came in a couple of times but never came up to us. Once even when we were done with our food and clearly just sitting there. Finally he came in, took an order at the table next to us, went on our other side & asked if that table wanted more beer, and eventually landed at our table. We asked him for a box & the check & when he came back, I just handed him my debit card without even looking at the check. And I NEVER do that. But I was afraid we'd never see him again. He came back fairly quickly & gave me my receipt. While this was going on, another couple had come in & sat at a table & no one had come up to them at all in 5 minutes. No acknowledgement, no menus, nada. They got mad & left. I could see the woman telling the hostess & being pretty upset about it & frankly, I don't blame her. I would have done the same thing. Our server could at least acknowledged her. He saw that they had left & after the woman stopped talking to the hostess & walked out, that's when he walked out to the host stand to inquire about it. Nice.

As a born and bred Chicagoan, I was really excited when I first  saw the glowing 'CHICAGO"" shining on to Fort Apache.  I've been several times since then and always come to the same conclusion:

Awesome variety, average food, good beer.

This menu has something for everyone.  They have wild game burgers such as Alligator and Elk, deep dish pizza, and a lot of standard fare.  What has got me buzzing since my last visit though was the Ghost Burger.

For those of you who have ever watched the TV show Man Vs. Food, you know all too well about the hauntingly hot ghost chili, but have you ever tried it?  A lover of all things hot, I was thrilled to learn that Chicago Brewing Company had several items on the menu featuring the ghost chili.  I have a good tolerance for heat, but let me tell you that the ghost chili is the REAL DEAL!  After my first bite, my mouth was an inferno of pain, my face began to sweat, and I couldn't reach for my mug fast enough.  I struggled to get through all the burger, but did it. 

It was an experience I'm happy to have had, and would never relive.  Expand your horizons, and taste some fire!

Bottom Line:  Great selection on the menu and good beer make this brewery a great destination for happy hours and group gatherings.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,1,1,3,uVN30zHTb9Y5KKW_0kM3qw

The inside of the restaurant was just as depressing it doesn't really feel like a restaurant inside I can't pinpoint what it felt like but the atmosphere was just not nice. The manager or the guy who was dressed like the manager seemed inattentive to the restaurant and was just walking around but not really doing anything.  Our waitress was great but that's about where the great stops for this place.  One of the people in our party got pretty sick the next day.

We weren't that hungry, so we split two orders of sliders: meatballs and buffalo chicken. Both were fine but underseasoned. Each was served with a sizable side of fries, which neither of us finished.

First time here & the place is broken into a smoking & non smoking area seperated by a door. This is awesome for non smokers as they get to enjoy the bar & restuarant w/o the issue of smoke. The downfall is if you sit in the non smoking area there's no bar. I tend to want to sit at a bar because normally it's faster service & you can chat w/ the bartenders too.
We decided to go to the bar which is located in the smoking area, both. We chose the upstairs bar which is small about 8 seats total. There is a small table w/ lounge type chairs, about 6 in that same area. It was great because we got to interact w/ the bartender who was very tentative to us & all the other patrons as well. He even suggested a twist on an old classic. There is a small balcony which we got to step out to to grab some air.
We must have come at the right time because there was very little to no smoke around us. Either that or people were just being very respectful to the non smokers, which is hard to find at a place these days. The drinks were on point & we were never fully empty before the next round came.

Unfortunately, my second trip tonight was somewhat disappointing.  The host was awesome and had a great attitude and smile, however when we got to our table the service was lacking in many ways. 

The tall guy (wont say his name out of respect) seemed like he was bored and freaked out by the 4 tables he had to wait on.  We returned our pizza twice to ask the to finish cooking it, I ask three times for ketchup for my fries, and he totally forgot our sweet potato fries and when I brought it to his attention he mumbled something and then walked off to the kitchen never to say another word about them.  Here is a clue "" I am sorry I forgot to put your order in"" would have been appropriate.

So...not sure what to make of this place, but I hope that if I decide to come again, the service and food steps up a notch or two

I was just getting over a cold and didn't really plan on having any alcohol (although I wish I could have) due to my horrible sore throat (that the concert made worse!) so I asked the server for some hot tea which completely confused him. 

I understand the restaurant portion was closed although they are open 24/7 but the fact they were completely out of hot tea overall was still confusing. They did offer me honey and lemon though but he never brought me a spoon so it was in the end just awkward hot water but still helped. 

We split a pizza, pretzel nuggets and garlic knots and for being bar food it was actually quite excellent. Maybe we were just starving but even the leftover the next day were still good!

Service was dismal- saw signage advertising their lunch special and ordered it, was not told about it by our server. Other than being super cute and taking our order, then later bringing our check, didn't see much of our server as other staff brought out our food and we were not asked how we liked it until it was nearly gone. Initially intended to ask for ketchup but never saw anyone to ask. Seemed like we may have been a bit forgotten on the back patio.

Ordered the lunch special of a ham and cheese melt with a cup of the soup of the day- cream of mushroom. Sandwich was a good value with tons of ham- a bit salty for my liking but like I said, good value. Soup was very tasty and smooth, with good flavor. Added a side of onion rings, which was about ten rings for $3- perfectly crisp in beer batter, did not fall apart while eating.

My guy had the 10 piece hot wings with a cup of chili- wings were not hot but had good flavor and were a large size, priced well at $10 for the order coming out to a dollar a wing. Would come back for these wings despite lack of heat, wish they offered more sauces. Chili was also good quality- meaty with a few kidney beans, topped with green onions and cheese. Beer used in cooking was clearly eviden in the flavor of the dish itself.

My office occasionally has happy hour meetups here, and after experiencing the food I'll have to attend next time. Highly recommend the soups to order, and patio seating for dining and enjoying the weather.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,3,3,YnB3ZEQzDWad_-VjOARCLQ

The waiter was pretty awesome, no complaints about the staff at all.   We ordered a 2 pitchers of the sweet nectar known as beer.  The Weizenheimer came in a pitcher that looked like sweet golden honey, but upon tasting it we realized something had gone horribly wrong with the beer.

I've eaten at the Chicago Brewing Co. outlet in the 4 Queens downtown.  This was my first visit to their full restaurant / brewery.  The beer, as always, was good, but the food was not.  I started with an enchilada soup that was okay.  Then I got a pizza.  There was something wrong with the crust.  First, it was under-done, but more, it was like a biscuit dough, not a bread/pizza dough.  A really strange consistency.  I've always enjoyed their pizzas downtown, this was not that.  Their topping was heavy on cheese, light on meats.",uyqE8kvAq2LxPnm385T6NA,1,0,2,O5N7CjbOFPZAjmm3bGqllA

We get seated in a booth and asked for what kind of drinks we would like. I ordered  a cup of coffee and my husband ordered an ice tea. When the drinks arrived, there was no sugar and no spoon to stir with. When we asked for sugar, they bring us sweetner. The waitress stated that they don't have sugar, but we have raw sugar. Really. Next we ordered the calamari, pretzel bites, and the molten chocolate a la mode. And of course, the calamari was like chewing on a rubber band. So as you can see, the service sucks, and the food is not that great.

The huge Chicago sign outside of the attractive building is what drew our attention to it... then, of course, discovering that it was a nearby microbrew, well, how could we resist?

I love microbrews... and I enjoy trying them out from the different regions of the country. When we first sat down, we were greeted by a very knowledgeable waitress who helped us through the beer menu. We started our evening with the nine-beer sampler for $9. This gave us a chance to warm up to all of the local offerings. After working our way through them all, my wife and I both chose our favorites.

Next came the food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke appetizer. Sure, you've had this in other places, like your neighborhood chain restaurants, but this one takes the cake. It was a huge portion and the flavor was nothing short of spectacular. If you like spinach and artichoke, this appetizer must be on your list of things to get here.

We then looked over the good-sized menu. There was a decent amount of things to choose from, but given the name of the place, we were immediately drawn to the deep dish pizza. I mean, with a name like ""Chicago"" how can we go wrong with deep dish pizza?

We chose correctly!

The deep dish pizza was some of the best I have had, and unlike other places that specialize in this style of pizza, it arrived to the table a little faster than I expected, which gave it a little time to cool down, which was good, because it was piping hot when the waitress arrived with it.

The dough was perfect. The cheese was real and it was perfect. The sauce was homemade - and one of several you could choose from - and the pepperoni was spicy and plentiful. Definitely a good choice if you like deep dish.

We finished our food, drank our beers and the waitress cleaned out the pint glasses - which had the restaurant's logo on them - and we got to take them home with us.

If you're in this area of Las Vegas and you have a little time, I strongly recommend visiting this place... it'll fill you up and it won't set you back a whole lot of money either.",dJZMNwj2DNN-BFSNikcoDA,0,0,4,G21UxLW0o2-y0FxbcR32xg

Happy Hour
Prices were super awesome, $9/pitcher, which was perfect to split with my buddy. They also have a few $6 app choices like pizza and pretzel bites. Apparently they no longer have a late night happy hour which sucks for those who work til 12 on the strip.  

Service
Our bartender was Brad, who really makes you feel like you're a regular on your first visit. He was hilarious and you can tell he has quite the customer base that come back to visit. 

Atmosphere
What I like about this location is the three distinct experiences you can have. There is a gaming-bar area which would be somewhat similar to PTs, there is a restaurant as well which caters to more families I'm sure, but then there is the upstairs bar area which includes a cigar area. It's nice to have a bar you can sit at and not feel pressured to gamble at. 

Taste
The beers we had were super yummy. We did a pitcher of Hef and a light beer selection. The pizza was just alright but the other foods that people were ordering looked bomb.

Had an amazing blueberry vanilla beer which unfortunately is seasonal even though it is super popular.  I then asked for a daiquiri, a simple drink that anyone should be able to make.  The bartender had no idea though.  He asked what flavor I wanted and I said just a straight daiquiri, not frozen, not fruity.  He didn't know what to do so I told him the three ingredients, rum, simple syrup, and lime juice and he still told me he didn't know how to make it so I told him and he still refused to do it so I just grumpily ordered a beer.  That truly annoyed me.

I went again just last night and our bartender was polite and engaging, got me my beer and rum and coke, and our happy hour apps.  It was pleasant but nothing special.

We were upstairs bar area. Part of the restaurant that most people don't know about but lot more spacious then the downstairs bar area. It carpeted upstairs, the lounge chairs lot more comfortable (downstairs more stand up bar stool/chair), and even have little arcade type area have golden tee and couple other games.  Watching any games have more then enough televisions upstairs or downstairs. They do also sell cigars if in the mood for stogie and cognac.

And started thinking when I walked in, ""You were meant for me..."" (yeah, lousy Jewel reference).

There's a dining room (remember, in Vegas you can still smoke in the bar areas), a bar and a secret loft cigar bar with a fireplace and an outside beer patio. Honestly, being a non-smoker, the air in the bar was fine.

This is an eatery that brews beer, and brew master David Pascual has won numerous awards (well, the beers have) . There's a great assortment, I tried the IPA and the creamy Black Star Stout. The IPA is on the lighter side, a tad hoppy, not too bitter and not over whelming. They offer short mugs, 22oz mugs, the 50oz Brewtus, Pitchers, Growlers and the Brewzooka's (oh my).

You're my boy Blue!
Well, maybe not.

I ordered the Black & Blue Sliders. A compact set of three each equipped with a black angus patty dusted with cajun spice, loaded with caramelized onions and a microcosm of blue cheese crumbles.

The caramelized onions were delicious, but extremely over powering. I looked, searched, opened and anticipated a burst of blue cheese, but sadly found just a smidgen, a dot, barely a hint of that penicillin-added mold culture we know as blue cheese.  

Just rename the thing the Caramelized Onion Slider, don't tease us with Cajun Spices or Blue Cheese...or better yet, offer a side of Blue Cheese- and for goodness sake, spell it BLEU Cheese.

Friendly service, the bar is loaded with video poker, so sitting at the rail is tough. The high back tables in the bar area are comfortable and it's not too loud, bright or over powering with smoke.",Sy6Uwey7gRoH2jaNUzyT4w,1,0,4,jf2jvaLIUFdSHtj4LuMvjQ

2348781,2011-03-12,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"We went to Chicago Brewing Company last weekend at my wife's suggestion.

We started with a bowl of clam chowder. The presentation was nice and had a fresh clam shell on the side of the bowl. The taste was okay but had a little too much pepper and more vegetables than I care for in my clam chowder.

We both got one of their micro-brews to drink. I ordered the Weizenheimer which is their hefeweizen. My wife got the black widow stout. Both were decent though we both preferred the beer the other ordered so we swapped.

For our entree we split the wild game sliders combo plate. It consisted of six different sliders: alligator, antelope, bison, rabbit, jackelope (antelope and rabbit), and wild boar. I was really excited to try all the different types of game but was underwhelmed. 

The alligator tasted like seasoned salt and cumin and was a little heavy on the spices. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.

The antelope was really dry and I had to choke it down. It had a licorice/anise taste to it.

The bison and jackelope sliders were also dry and not particularly memorable.

The rabbit had a very mild taste and wasn't as dry as some of the others.

The wild boar was my favorite. It was a little dry but the meat had a nice taste and wasn't masked by spices.

The sliders had animal toothpicks in them labeling what kind of meat they were which was a nice/cute touch.

The sliders were served with waffle-cut sweet potato fries. They were pretty good and not too sweet.

First, they don't have the celery salad any more! It was so good! Second, the servers just aren't what they use to be. Yea, I don't regular this place like I use to but at once a week, at least, you'd think they'd start remembering their regulars, after all they tip better. There are very few servers that are still there and still don't recall us. But the service isn't the worst and most will check on you before HH is over, big bonus. 

The HH is still the best at $6 a pitcher for craft local beer! The food portion is yet to catch up or rather has fell behind, it use to be way better. But alas it is still the best place to sit on the patio and have a beer. 

Recently, we were told the patio was closed due to damage to the patio wall. A couple times we checked in on the status of the patio being open, it's the best place to air and the perfect weather!, each time however getting various degrees of confused looks and responses. But yet there were people seen on the patio on a couple nights when I drove by. Seemed there was a major miscommunication on the situation? Weird, Chi-brew lost our business several times during that period. On the last try we called ahead, I didn't make the phone call but Traci T said they talked to her like she asked them if they served beer. 'Duh our patios open.  But I was excited!

For an appetizer, we got the steakhouse fries. The menu said it was topped with beer cheese and I'm not a huge fan of beer, but we tried it anyway. I didn't like it much, but it was all right. I probably wouldn't order them again, but if my boyfriend wanted to, I'd munch on the fries on the bottom that didn't have much (or any) cheese on them, which is what I did that day.

We both tried the country fried filet mignon. I didn't really like the mashed potatoes -- they were sour for some reason. I've had mashed potatoes like that and I'm not sure what it is in them that makes it taste that way, but I don't like it much. The meat was kinda tough and dry; the fried batter just fell right off. I just felt like I was eating a kind of dry steak and some chips.

As for service, the staff was nice. However, we got the wrong drinks three times. We had a guy that was in training as our server, but I don't blame him for this. The first time, my boyfriend ordered I think a 16oz beer, but the bartender poured him a 20z, which he said was fine. Then a waitress refilled my raspberry iced tea with unsweetened iced tea. I let our server know what happened and he got me a refill of the right drink. Lastly, my boyfriend was trying to ask our server for the hefeweizen before he walked away; however, he had already swiftly walked out of earshot. The busser was handing us our plates of food and heard my boyfriend, so he said he'd send the server back our way. The server was nice enough to return with a beer, but it was a refill of the same beer. I'm guessing the busser just told him my boyfriend wanted another beer, but didn't specify which or did not indicate that the server should come and ask. He also could've, but the server didn't bother to. Can't really know for sure, so I can't say who's responsible.

The place didn't seem that busy as there were empty tables, so I don't think that was the problem. I think they need to work on communicating or fulfilling orders a bit more. Overall, it was decent. We're not sure if we're going to come back, but if so, it won't be because we enjoyed the food. I'm willing to give them another chance, though.",Ylnzp7o02wCziyMdHmN8Tw,0,0,3,SH789ttQXF-J2FarD_tLCg

It tasted kind of like a cross between fish and beef.  The patty itself was lightly fried with some spices that really made the flavor quite nice.  

My friends both enjoyed their lunches as well.  The salad wasn't the best, but it wasn't an iceberg bomb either.  The beer was pretty good.  Back in 1999, this beer would have been top notch.  Today, the West Coast style of brewing is to make bigger beers.  None of the beers crafted at Chicago are above 6.5%.  Chicago has kind of fallen behind the times a little, but the beer is still awesomely fresh.  You can see the brewery through glass walls in the center of the establishment!

Overall, while not the best brewery in Vegas (ahem, Draft House), it is a real treat for craft beer drinkers.  The food is good too.   The restaurant is small enough to be cozy and intimate, so even non-beer drinkers should have a visit to check out the strange sliders or maybe a pizza!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,2,1,4,VsEDaZG0Z_dsSxBR_5l3pQ

They have thier own parking lot, no trouble finding a spot. I have only eaten in thier restaurant side a few times so won't be reviewing the food part of it but thier bar that has its own entrance on the north side of the building. 

As the name suggests they have all sorts of types of beer, thier Hefenweizen is really good! The bar as TV'S all along the bar along with gaming machines. There's seating area for 2 or 4 on the bottom level. Upstairs has more loung  type atmosphere with sofas and comfortable seats. You can order food at the bar, it's your typical bar food. 

The prices are good IMO, me and the wife had 8 vodka soda water's and it was under $65 and left pretty buzzed. Late at night the crowd gets shady but then again that's everywhere.

2644827,2011-04-11,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"We have been to Chicago Brewing Company (CBC) a few times now and always have really enjoyed the fun atmosphere, the great hand crafted beer, and the food. CBC sits in the corner of the parking lot on the Ft Apache side off of Sahara. Very cool looking brick exterior which really reminds of you of a older restaurant from back east, possibly Chicago. 
When you walk in they have a few areas for you to choose from on where to sit and eat, and of course drink. Off to the immediate left when you first walk in is the enclosed bar and gaming area. They do serve food in here as well, and with all the TV's neatly tucked up under the bar we usually choose this area. Off to the right hand of side when you walk in is the main dining room which is pretty good size with all different sizes of tables to accommodate a couple or a large group. There is also a second story that is accessible through the bar area, but if I remember right its strictly drinking up, no food. 
Last time we were there was about 3 days ago. We went into the bar area like I said we normally do, and as usual it did not disappoint. We mad small talk with the bartender who is very friendly and even more knowledgeable about his beers. I always go for the Chicago style stuffed crust pizza. They offer many toppings of meat and vegetables. I kept it pretty plain on this night and ordered just pepperoni. I ordered the large which is a little pricey at over 25$, but the pizza is huge and very filling. I also ordered their soup of the day which was the Cajun chicken. My girlfriend ordered the steak sandwich which turned out to be the star of the night....more on that later. We then ordered a few of their hand crafted beers, I ordered the blond, and my gf the stout. Both were very good and not over powering, but not watered down either. 
Now onto the food. My soup came out first. It was a huge bowl of soup, with plenty of great tasting veggies and chicken. The broth was very satisfying and eventually I ate the entire bowl. Next came out my pizza, and my gf's steak sandwich. The pizza was great as usual, very thick, very meaty and the sauce is something that will keep you coming back for sure. True Chicago style pizza. Now the steak sandwich stole the show with a nice 7-8 oz what looked to be NY strip steak, a garlic aoli, lightly breaded onion rings and a very nice bib lettuce. All together this sandwich is top die for. At one point I found myself trying to steal more of the sandwich and left my pizza to the side. 
Overall we cannot get enough of CBC. We always take the extra time to figure out how we can get over there at least once a month, maybe more. True Chicago style pizza, but with a lot more. Check it out, I don't think you will be disappointed.",_32ENoRIN_i3Xq_U8qCDNg,4,2,5,Ti3rVatXiYYGNo-KK5zhMA

They completely changed the menu and even the staff complained that patrons often request items from the old menu and often times leave when told they can't be accommodated. We decided to give it a try and the food was made well and they even attempted to make the brew house fries which hands down was the best thing on the menu. Wasn't the same.

Threw the ""dirty"" rag on the table I was sitting at- to the other table, when walking into the bar seating area.  Waiter saw that and gave me a dirty look. Had 20 minutes until his sexton closed, he gave some girls some stuff and helped them, came to us 5 minutes before shift (yes, 15 minutes passed) and then said here's so menus, I'm leaving. 

Then, we pick what we want and go to bar, he says, ""wrong menu"". Gave us another one, finally ordered and they delivered. Overall it was okay- not so bad, but not so good. I figured for having table seating it might be a little better than standard bar food, but not that impressed. 

I get the waiter, but just get over it, obviously I wasn't purposely being a jerk, I just didn't see you. 

I also got eye-rolled for smoking and as well as they held their noses, by two ""dimbo"" girls.  It's a bar, 2AM, get over yourselves. Speaking of them, the crowd was young, too much for me.

1. The Minnesota Vikings 
2. The discovery there is no Santa Claus
3. The quality of the beer at Chicago Brewing Company

Las Vegas lacks a brew pub with great beer, great food, and fun atmosphere. (Big Dogs comes close, but not quite.)  Chicago Brewing Company offers okay food coupled with mediocre beer.  The cavernous (and usually empty) dining room gives off a forlorn vibe.  Combine this with the quality of the beer and you have the epitome of depression right on Sahara Avenue.

What can Chicago Brewing Company do to save itself?

1. Start brewing truly original (and tasty) beer.  They are a prime example of how microbrew doesn't always mean good.  For example:  A porter should have a hint of roasted coffee aroma, not taste like someone's excrement after a trip to Starbuck's.
2. Expand upon the more creative options on the food menu.
3. Rearrange the dining area to make it more intimate and less ""cavern of doom.""

Until then, I will wait for someone to open a great brew pub in Vegas.  However, I won't hold my breath.",bj9RFpzAekozJpSWOU_0xQ,0,0,2,OyxhjzAOMZUicnFrJmQwEA

Nothing very interesting or crisp tasting, with the usual ""pale, amber, brown, stout"", and a weak IPA core lineup. Seasonals were a steam beer, blueberry vanilla ale, and golden ale with lime and none were really any good.

3203603,2010-06-07,17,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"My memories of Chicago are probably like everyone else's...mooning an umpire at a White Sox game. Like most people I have interfered with a potential playoff home run baseball, rode the back of Bill Cartwright, never ate at anything Michael Jordan owned, threw up deep dish pizza in a drunken haze, and snagging some cheap chick from Tinley Park in the bathroom of Exedus II. (We all know they are the easiest chicks in the Metro area...gotta love the naïve suburbs.)  You know, the usual things any one does in Chicago.

All of those good memories came flooding back to me when I passed the Chicago Brewing Company. A wave of emotions hit me...I almost hit my hearse into a bus full of nuns...almost reliving another Chicago memory I have tried to hard to forget. The smell of burning Habit is really oft putting and not one you forget easily...but I digress...
I sauntered into the bar a few months ago ready to smash any of those Chicago loving goons for just looking at me wrong, and what I found was a really nice place to eat, a great bar and some good food.
First, the downstairs dining room.  Sometimes your old pal Rex has a hard time getting up and down stairs. That damn keyboard cleaner really throws off your balance when you huff two cans.  So, I decided to eat where it was most convenient.  The one legged hooker with dysentery appreciated it...all that shaking from the hoping up the stairs can produce some horrible results.   She got a chicken sandwich with hot sauce and I got a cobb salad, a corn cob screwed up my partial plate. Remember kids...always brush at least once a week, I wish my 6 foster mothers told me that instead of what a loser I was.  Anyway...the cob salad is gigantic. It is a great salad. Chicken, bacon, avocado, egg, you name it. All fresh, all well seasoned and all very good.  Jasmine, if that was her real name, told me the sandwich was very hot, I wouldn't touch anything she touched but next time I tried it and I thought it was excellent. Big piece of chicken fried and covered with hot sauce.  There could have been more sauce because the bun was a little dry.  I ate several times down there and all the food was good, the waitress service was great and I never had a time where I wanted to start slicing up the booth with my steak knife. A good sign. The food was always good, but nothing they did was ever great other than the salad...wondering about the pizza...keep reading...

The bar upstairs is where things get fun.  There are a few tv's, some high top tables and chairs and a great little lounge area.  Good times on the weekend if you like the yuppie crowd. Rex doesn't. Perfect for discussing what is easily the best part of this place...the beer. Ah, the beer. They brew their own beer and it is good.  Despite burning my tongue on a tailpipe...don't ask...I could taste all the hoppy goodness.  They have a pale ale and go always up to a nice dark beer. Fruit beers, the blueberry one I tried, was good but not great, other than that they were damn good brews.

Rex will end this on a bad note, just like his 4 marriages, 8 colleges, 19 stops in state run facilities and the one time he met Kyle Petty.  The deep dish pizza sucks! Not just by deep dish pizza standards...but by pizza standards.  The crust is buttery, but after that it falls apart. It is not filled enough with toppings and cheese. It is a chinsy deep dish pizza.  Most medium deep dishes are about 8lbs, sometimes more. This is like 4. They need to add more to it and make it a more substantial pie.  I was disgusted. I threw mine over the balcony and screamed down from the bar ""Al Capone should have killed all you sewer rats."" Strangely they got upset by this. I am not sure I am allowed back.  I am not sure I care.

Chicago is one of the bigger breweries in the Las Vegas scene and pretty much anyone into craft beer has been or heard of this place.

The hefe, IPA, brown, stout and some others comprise the regular beers, keep an eye out for the Hawaiian Honey with an astounding 14% ABV. My personal favorite, the Hefe is true to it's German roots with a crisp wheat taste and golden color. Service is hit or miss during happy hour and may have to wave down a bartender to get your order in. 

Happy hour is M-F 3pm-7pm in either the upstairs or downstairs bars. I was a little disappointed that there is no late night happy hour which probably explains why this place is a ghost town after 8pm. They offer up $6 pitchers along with $2 14oz and $2.50 22oz. Great prices on awesome beer you can't get anywhere else in town. CBC is pretty weak on the food offerings, $6 for chicken fingers, a cheese pizza and garlic knots. Meh.

I ordered a steak sandwich with onion rings.  I think i got 5 onion rings ... not worth the upcharge , the steak sandwich was good however , it was literally a whole steak thrown on a peice of bread .....  Anytime i have ever had a steak sandwhich before .. they usually slice it at least.   

My wife ordered a ruben ... the waitress brought out my sandwhich and basically told us my wife would have to wait for hers since another waitress took her food on accident . ...  dont they put tickets next to the food for this exact reason ?  It took nearly another 15 minutes. By the time she got her food , mine was almost cold as i didnt want to eat and make my wife sit there while i was eating.

I tried their standard pale, which was very smooth but perhaps a bit uninspiring. Perhaps it could have been a bit more floral but it was very easy to drink and that is a plus. Their amber is sweet and comforting. Better than a bottle of Fat Tire no doubt. I also tried their brown ale. Slightly less malty than a New Castle, but again, fairly easy to drink. Trying these beers was fun and I would like to try more of them. The coconut porter looks especially tempting, so I'll have to save that for next time.

My food experience wasn't phenomenal, but it was decent enough I suppose. I ordered the italian beef sandwich, because my understanding is that its' an authentic Chicago food item. The meat was perhaps a tad more well done than I would have liked, and salty, but the Au Jois was adequate. The macaroni salad was pretty standard. The chicago pizza that others ordered looked pretty agreeable, and the Reuben looked delicious-- I think I will choose it next time. 

I think it's a bit silly that happy hour is not allowed in the dining area. Several from my party walked over to the bar and brought back beers at a much better price than the rest of us who had to order at full price. I don't quite see the purpose of this policy, but hey it's not my business. 
For my birthday, a complementary chocolate pizookie was served.  I am partial to chocolate but it was honestly pretty damn good, and I do appreciate gestures such as this. 

So how does this place stack up to a BJ's or Yardhouse? Probably about even. I'd give them a 3.5, rounded up to 4 because of that personal touch, and the novelty of brewing their own beers. I WOULD certainly recommend this place for an event , just manage your expectations I suppose. It was a cool looking, fun environment to celebrate in and I thank them for helping me have a fun night.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,1,0,4,1vXxsvSsUKqpEHweFtLPsA

At first glance, I was very impressed with the decor, but that's about the only thing that impressed me. My dining companion said that she only gets one thing when she dines at Chicago Brewing Company -- the Shrimp Cocktail. When they brought her plate of shrimp out(it was previously served in a cocktail glass), the first thing she said to me was ""the shrimp are smaller and the price went up since the last time I ate here.""

I wanted to try a Chicago Style Pizza and so I ordered one. The first one came out, I didn't like the sauce they used although the toppings were quite tasty (bacon and chicken) We asked if they would re-make the pizza this time using a white sauce and they obliged. The second one came out but was obviously under cooked. I had one piece of each pizza, a coke and just because I didn't eat much I ordered a root beer float.

My companion and I both left unsatisfied. Within less than an hour, I became physically ill. From reading the reviews here it seems like most of the people like the place but that was not our experience. Unfortunately, I can't agree with everyone else this time. In my opinion the food is mediocre at best and priced a bit on the high side. A complete and total waste of $40 and talk about something that will ruin someones day? Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I have posted an accurate, fair review. Thanks for taking the time to read. Hope your experience (if you decide to go here) is leaps and bounds better than mine was!

If the business owner is willing and should happen to see this review; I would graciously accept a refund but I don't believe you could ever convince me to return.",8hDnAB36ePyQfgHTBdd0_Q,5,1,1,hs0DjvNkdSKKHHsWHymYwQ

Hubby and I decided to come here for dinner and we left full and satisfied. The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)

We sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the ""Buffalo Chicken Wrap"" priced at $10 and the ""South Side Cheese Steak"" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. 

South Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!

Happy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.

While there we noticed a promotion for ""Slot August Nights"" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company.

It had a nice cheesy layer on the top, which was piping hot, but the inside of the dip was not that hot, which leads me to believe this thing came straight from the freezer. Aside from it being unbelievably salty, the flavor was just bland. We also ordered the veggie thin crust pizza, that looked super nice but the only parts of the crust that were crispy were the edges, they didn't cook it long enough for the whole pizza crust to crisp throughout. The veggies seemed fresh enough, but there was barely any cheese and I felt like the sauce they used came straight from a can.

Interesting layout.

We choose the bar area, sat at a table and was immediately served by a friendly woman. Not bad so far.

Also ordered the Chicago Italian Beef and the wife got a cheese pizza.
The issue here was the food service. A lot of what we ordered came out wrong, I would not recommend the coleslaw (too dry, like cabbage and nothing else) nor the fries (limp). The pizza was good as was the Italian beef.

It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!

The waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!

As most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!

I asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.

To wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!

After a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!

So....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.

I'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!

Overall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!

Other things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!

I had the Strawberry Harvest Wheat brew and it was delightful, not overpowering and quite refreshing. I was interested in the steak sandwich; however, the waiter talked me into the club sandwich. The portion was huge - which is good for taking home, but the club itself was so large that I couldn't actually take a bite. It was cut into quarters, and speared with a long toothpick - but there wasn't a good way to take a bite of it.

Now I wont just look at this place as a great place to have a good beer on the weekend or after work. I will consider it for a good lunch or dinner spot as well. Kudos!",dnv5UpldAE6UITDcMleLVA,2,0,4,5lQ56XFxj4bntiUXOBusHw
3966808,2011-04-14,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Thanks to Ken M. who organized an UYE here tonight, I got to try their new wild game sliders.  They were added to the menu last fall.  The six sliders are made from the following game animals:  alligator, antelope, buffalo, jackalope (rabbit and antelope meat mixed together), rabbit and wild boar.  They come 3 for $16 (must be all one kind of meat) or a sampler platter of all 6 for $30.

Three of us shared the sampler and we each had a taste of all 6 meats.  My rating would be from best to least: Rabbit, wild boar, alligator, antelope, jackalope, and bison.  All had sauces to enhance the flavors of the meat.  For example, the wild boar had red currant jelly and sharp cheddar cheese while alligator had a remoulade sauce and a fried egg.  There was a toothpick to break the yolk and make the alligator meat really flavorful!  The platter also came with some waffle cut sweet potato fries which were really yam fries--not sweet potato.  This was a good choice, and I'm glad Tony and Clint shared the sampler with me.

Service was good, and I had a mug of their on site brewed root beer.  Another great UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) with a nice bunch of people at a good place.

Overall atmosphere was less than impressive. Service was average, but nothing worth coming back for. The beer was fine, but also nothing worth making a specific trip back for. 

Being huge fans of BBQ chicken pizzas, we tried their version - the Brew BQ Chicken Pizza. I imagine the chicken used is the pre-cooked, sliced strips you can buy at the grocery store (which, if you've ever had, is terrible). We picked most of it off or even had to just spit it on the plate. It lacked an adequate amount of sauce and the crust was about as good as crunchy cardboard. 

Not saying this place doesn't have other tasty options, but I certainly won't be back to try and find them.",OuCT58K-1POeNEqTwhMsxQ,1,0,2,0OgFxtv2z-a3HF3yEvPrtg

The service was the stand out this time.  The waitress who initially helped me told me to what a few minutes to order, that way I would get happy hour prices.  I thought that was very nice of her.

The food unfortunately was a let down.  I ordered the BBQ chicken fingers, greek salad, and, of course, ice tea.  The chicen fingers were, meh, nothing special.  The BBQ didn't add anything to it.  If anything, it took away from the dish since it clashed with the breading on the chicken.  The celery salad was unique and tasty.  I wish they didn't take it away so soon.  The greek salad had a little too much dressing.

I am sure if I had a chance to review the alcohol offerings along with the bar food I would have given this place more stars, especially during happy hour.  But if you are just going for happy hour food, there are better brew-pubs out there.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,1,1,2,B_YcroLsDJbfsZQt8CcFag

I have had a waitress in the past who seemed to always had a chip on her shoulder. Not sure if she still works there or not. She was just unpleasant to have as a waitress but It was over a year or so ago I was last here. However, yesterday we had someone named Tara who was really sweet and nice. 

I know all the food is pretty fresh. If it's available the coco for coconuts porter is amazing.  Also I'd highly recommend the ribeye sandwich ( it's huge) , any of the burgers, chicken sandwich, and the New England clam chowder( I think it's a Friday night thing).

4014336,2011-02-28,3,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"I read some great reviews several months back and but it on my backburner to try.  Looking in the most recent reviews today I should have checked out the place sooner.  Really, a borderline 3 for this place.

We got there on a Friday night and it was a bit packed.  Decor is nice, dark, lots of brick.  Liked seeing the huge vats for their in house microbrews, real plus.  But really folks, does it take you 10 minutes to acknowledge that we might need a place to sit?  Naughty, naughty you hostess you!  On a Friday night you know business will pick up so be on the ready!

After finally getting seated we were greeted by our server.  Nice guy.  Told him we had never been there before so he showed us the menu and told us about their house microbrews and some of his favorites.  I told him I like dark beers like Guiness but I also don't mind a more medium brew like a Newcastle.  He told me I should have both!  His suggestion: 1/2 of their Old Town Brown and 1/2 of their Black Star Stout!  Also known in many places as a Black and Tan!  At $5 for a 22 oz. glass how could I go wrong?  Turned out to be a great choice, malty beer with chocolate notes, and a light bitter finish.  Fantastic!

I get around to looking into the menu and behold what do I see?  Chicago's master brewer...is a Filipino!  Graduate from UNLV no less!  That's it...go Filipino go!  Nice job Mr. Pascual on making some killer beer!  Makin' our Asian community strong, one person at a time.  Glad he got a page for him on the menu.  

On to the dinner menu, lots of variety!  Definitely bar food in the works for sure.  Appetizers looked appealing, garlic knots, onion rings, chicken tenders, brew wings, calamari, mussels, and clams.  So much to choose from.  If I had been there in time for happy hour we would have sampled some of these.  Menu has a diverse selection, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, entrees, and pizzas both Chicago deep dish and thin crust.  They even have a section devoted to their popular sliders.

We thought about getting a specialty Chicago deep dish pizza at first but it was a bit pricy at $14 for a 9"" (man did they look tiny sitting on the warming line) and $24 for a 14"".  You can also build your own deep dish pizza if you like.  Maybe next time!

The lady and I both ended up getting sandwiches from their menu.  She got the Hot Pastrami Sandwich ($10) with thin pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and honey mustard on marble rye bread.  I got the Southside Cheesesteak ($10) with peppers, mushrooms, and onions on a French roll with their signature beer cheese sauce.  The lady had onion rings, and I had fries (asked for them to be well done).

The verdict?  Food was ah.  It was ok, but nothing to really write home about.  Nothing was really all that special.  Her pastrami sandwich was alright, but it wasn't exactly overflowing with meat, and the coleslaw was a bit bland.  The onion rings didn't seem super fresh, do I detect from a bag and not hand battered?  Oh goodness I hope not.  My cheesesteak was fine (I've had better), their signature beer cheese sauce had a hint of beer but mostly tasted like basic Cheez Whiz to me.  Does no one know how to toast the inside of bread before putting the meat on it?  That crunch makes a world of difference.  My fries on the other hand were very good.  Super crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  

An ok experience overall.  Hostess could have been better, but our server was A-OK.  I must go back just to sample more of their beers!  The food though, might need some improvement.  Plus a star though for their Filipino master brewer!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,3,3,St7eUIQy7MiPB0gl8stOUQ

I had a bad experience here last month when they completely overlooked a 40-person birthday reservation with no staff to assist and a server that would only stay upon the promise of ""being taken care of,"" but tonight topped the charts for the WORST service I have ever received anywhere. 

I decided to go back to try again, as I had been sent a $100 gift certificate by management for the last experience I had. 

The host, Destiny, became very visibly upset as she literally pushed me aside, through my group to walk us to our table. We had only walked a few feet from the hosts booth and were all so confused why she suddenly seemed so angry, as she had basically ignored us upon walking in. As we approached the table that she was throwing our menus down at, I proceeded to ask her if there was something that we did to upset her. She responded with, ""I don't appreciate when people walk ahead of me that I am seating. I'm the host!""  

Destiny, you work in the service industry as the front of house staff. You set the tone for your guest's experience and you are the LASTING IMPRESSION of the business. If you get that upset over something so minuscule, work in a cubicle and don't plague mankind with your terrible attitude.

There is a bar when you first enter so you get a whiff of cigarette smoke, but it's not too bad.  Just noticeable.  The Hostess was nice.  We were seated and as our group grew, they were very accommodating bringing an additional table and chairs without any indications of hardship.  It was like you were family.  Alex was our Rock Star Waitress.  Funny, outgoing, fun, gracious and kind.  Beers came out cold, Alex was seamlessly attentive.  Never made us feel like she was trying too hard; know what I mean?  Anyway, we never felt like we waited too long for anything and she and her team managed our big group with the smoothness of a well tuned and oiled machine.

We did not order appetizers and got right down to business.  There were a lot of salads consumed tonight.  Go figure, eating with a group of cyclists.  I had the Ahi Tuna Salad.  It was big and I was full when I finished.   It was comprised of about 6 ounces of seared Ahi on top of a bed of baby greens, daikon sprouts, crushed cashews, colorful yellow and red pear tomatoes.  It was supposed to have a wasabi plum dressing, but what I got was more teriyaki based.  It was okay.  A little salty.  They poured the dressing for me.  Gratefully it was not a heavy pour. 

No one complained, plates were cleaned, and they brought out two desserts for the birthday boy...to share.  Deep Fried cheesecake and a chocolate lava cake.  They were both delicious. 

I wasn't blown away, but I'd come back to try some of the other items on the menu.

Went most recently with my husband and toddler to have lunch. It was a Monday a few months ago, the place was pretty empty as it was a little after what would have probably been the lunch rush time and it was on a weekday.  But that didn't stop the server from making it a wonderful visit. I wish I could remember her name to give her props, but needless to say, we were happily impressed with her service along with the food.

Server was knowledgeable about majority of the items. There was a question I had she wasn't sure about, but she answered honestly that she wasn't, went to the kitchen to find the correct answer and returned promptly. I'd rather have a server treat me with honesty than lie to hide the fact that they didn't know the right answer. Also proved that she had good relation with the BOH team and encouraged our guest perception that the whole establishment was working well together.

The beer was as it should be - cold, delicious and served in clean glassware (seems simple, right? but we all know that's not the case).

Food was perfectly done and served hot and fresh.

My toddler was - as always - a little pain, but our server coddled him flirting with her and paid extra attention. As a veterans of the food service industry, my husband and I were impressed at the attention given to us and the overall quality of the entire visit.

The beer flight there is a STEAL! You pretty much get to try every beer (I don't recall the exact number) and for a great price (I don't recall the price either, sorry!). They also have chilled Fireball just WAITING for you to shoot. 

The best part for me was complimenting our server on what a great job she was doing, only to find out that she's actually a busser!

I do not like beer, but for those who do enjoy the frosty beverage, they have several local and on-site drafts on tap. My boyfriend really enjoys their summer ale at the moment.

They have a fairly extensive menu, which ranges from gourmet pizzas to pot roast to standard bar fare. The food is definitely good, but some items are a little on the expensive side. For example, a large chicken caesar salad will set you back $12 (it's decently portioned, but it's still chopped lettuce with some chicken). Conversely, the chicken parmigiana, which is absolutely delicious, is $12.99; but any average eater could easily get two meals out of it.

The staff is nice and fairly attentive, but sometimes the service is a little slow, depending on if you sit in the bar or not and the time of day.

One server covering the whole place, she did a nice job of checking all the tables. One had a large group at it that required extra attention. 

We ordered burgers, but ended up getting some wings too. The burgers are all build your own, it would be nice to see them add a couple signature burgers to the menu. We don't lack creativity though, so we came up with some flavor combos. I went with a Mushroom Swiss. It was cooked well enough. I think I'll ask for a Medium Rare next time to juice it up a little. You have your choice of steak fries or regular. Both are good. 

The wings were a little let down. The sauce was good, but the flavor didn't penetrate the skin, so the meat inside tasted bland. Don't worry, the hot sauce packs a little punch.

I'll go back, next time to try one of the great looking pizzas I saw heading out to the other tables.",P2ZK_uDduvKbKgmNuyZQ4w,1,0,4,n1OGdvgy4z3i4O7OP2pKNQ

It was too spicy, I couldn't even eat more than two bites. I ended up throwing it away. There goes $10. 

I also ordered the garlic knots. Now those were pretty good. However, the menu on yelp said it would be $5 but when I got the bill, it was $8. I know $3 isn't much of a difference but the prices should be listed correctly! There goes $20 down the drain. I was not impressed.

The food is also very well prepared. I only eat meat sparingly and could not pass up the Trio of Filet Mignon Sliders appetizer (three broilded tenderloin filets topped w/ sautéed mushrooms & onions). The light and fluffy bread melted in my mouth along with the perfectly cooked Filet Mignon meat.

To save room for the beer, I chomped on a light Asian Ahi Salad (rare seared Ahi Tuna, mixed greens, toasted cashews, daikon sprouts, fresh tomatoes, w/ a Wasabi PlumVinaigrette).The Ahi Tuna was perfect and the dressing was good enough to bath in! So yummy! 

Sadly I only had enough room for the one beer but was eyeing the 50oz glass for my collection..next time. This place is a must for locals and visitors alike, regardless of its off-the-strip location.

The service was excellent.  I ordered a glass of wine and was happy to learn that it was not overpriced.  My husband had the brown ale, and he reports that it's very good.

Our server had to return numerous times, because it takes me forever to figure out what I want to eat, but he never displayed any impatience.  I finally decided on a burger with avocado, and my husband orderd the Chicken Piccata special ($10 - such a deal!), and the Split Pea Soup special.

He liked his chicken a lot.  It was a good-sized portion of chicken, and came with green beans and fresh red-skinned mashed.  The soup was good, too - a large-sized bowl with thick pea soup.  I tasted it and, as usual, it was way too salty for my taste, but he doesn't care about that.

My burger arrived on a huge bun, with the avocado, lettuce and tomato.  The tomato was a slice of completely white tomato CORE.  I asked the waitress who delivered it to bring me a slice of real tomato, and she promptly delivered a whole plate of red, sliced tomato.

The burger was big, and is supposed to be Angus, but it was dry, somewhat overcooked, and definitely not flavorful.  Instead of fries, I ordered a side salad.  The waiter had said I could substitute the salad for the fries, but he didn't say there'd be a $3 extra charge.  I didn't make a fuss when we got the bill because a) we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate, and b) the salad was absolutely huge, a composed salad of greens, iceberg, carrots, chickpeas, tomato, cucumber, olives, and croutons.  I gave half of it to my husband and still had enough to fill me up before the burger arrived.

The buffalo wings are amazing with a slight vinegar twang and not too hot. The deep dish pizza is completely customizable, I recommend layering your pizza CHEESE FIRST, sauce, pepperoni, extra cheese, and extra sauce. Pot roast, when it is available, is probably the closest to homemade you can get. Lastly, I recommend the in-house brewed root beer: it has a sweet, vanilla, molasses taste. Simply awesomeness.

Chicago's is open 24/7 and the menu differs constantly so make sure you familiarize yourself. BUT the wings are available all the time, FTW.

The service is always friendly, knowledgeable about their brews, and (forgive me for saying) very easy on the eyes.

The beer review section: I suggest everyone to try the sampler then pick their favorite. The Old Town Ale and Hawaiian Honey are personal favorites. All the beers a distinctly different taste.

The BBQ Pizza is amazing.  I like my BBQ sause sweet and the sause fitsthw bill. Everything is fresh and made to order.  The only hint I ammnot understaning is why thy pit corn on it.

4620583,2010-07-25,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"I'm giving this place four solid stars. My friend and I ate here during happy hour after seeing a movie at Red Rock. We stuck with the HH menu - some Garlic Knots, Chicken Tenders, and of course, their draught beer. The knots were delicious and definitely a HH crowd pleaser. The chicken was pretty good; they were tender fingers, but even though we ordered them hot, I could almost detect no spiciness.

To wash down the food, I had a Blonde Ale, while my friend started with their Hardway IPA and then switched to the Blonde Ale. I found the Blonde Ale to be quite tasty. At $2.50 for 22oz, it's definitely a steal. I tried a sample of the IPA and it tasted like a solid IPA! I wasn't in the mood for something that hoppy, but I can see myself ordering it next time. I also had a sample of their blueberry and vanilla wheat. I'm glad I did the sample first because it wasn't something of which I'd want a whole glass. It reminded me of another beer I've tried in the past that tastes like Fruity Pebbles!

What I truly appreciated about our visit today was the service that John provided us. It was just the little things he did to make sure we were happy. After all, it was happy hour. For example, when my friend ordered the IPA, he warned that it might be getting towards the bottom of the barrel, so he brought out a sample first. He also suggested that I get a sample of the blueberry and vanilla wheat first because other people have found it to be too strong in its fruitiness. I was actually going to ask for a sample, but he suggested it ahead of me. (And I'm really glad because I ended up not ordering it). He was also mindful of the fact that we were there for happy hour. He offered and came through by warning us when happy hour was almost over.

I can't speak for their entire menu, but this place is certainly on my list of good happy hours. Oh wait, I need to update my list! It's a little out of my way, but I will definitely return if I'm in the area, especially since I've now decided to see all my films at Red Rock.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,1,0,4,RwiEw-V3A9gbev-CUftTlQ

4669597,2010-06-11,2,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Price for 1 cup of milk: $1

Price for ghost chili pepper wings: $15

Price of seeing a big guy being brought to his knees, getting into a fetal position on the floor, and crying like a baby after one bite of the ghost chili pepper wings and then writing about it on Yelp even though it didn't really happen so people will vote this review as funny.: Priceless!

For everything else you have Yelp.

@ Chips + Salsa / Beer Cheese - The salsa was just okay. The beer cheese just really didn't work. It just drowned a good portion of the cheese, minus all the fat that goes along with the cheese. You might as well pour oil into some beer and dip it in that. Thats essentially what you're getting.

@ Calamari - This was one of the saving grace of the night. Very delicious and crispy. The scores would be a lot different if this was the only dish I was rating, but it isn't.

@ Filet Mignon Sliders - Absolutely disastrous. I asked for medium rare, one of the 3 sliders was overcooked. The taste department was so dry, flavorless, and uninspired. The onions and mushrooms did nothing for this dish. I had to add barbecue sauce to a filet to make it not suck! When you have to do that, that just tells you how bad this dish is. The bread looks like it just came from a 20-pack at Costco . Not even warmed up or anything special done to it. Slider Truck is where its at for sliders. 

@ Olive Deep Dish Pizza - This just wasn't that good. Deep dish is suppose to be packed full of flavors. This was like eating bread dipped in ketchup and olives, flavorless and boring. 

@ BBQ Chicken Pizza - Some redemption. This did carry some good flavors and was good. I've had better BBQ Chicken Pizza before, but this  at least saved this place from getting a 1 star. 

@ Ghost Chili Tenders - Ghost chills is the hottest peppers in the world, period. I didn't try it because I'm really sensitive to any kind of spicy food. Our group did try it and it wasn't that bad for many. The worst effect is some numbness that lasted 10 minutes. But with a little milk and time, everyone was okay. Not like the oh em gee I can't open my mouth or eyes.

The reason for coming to this place was solely for our group to try the ghost chili. The menu is dull and uninspiring, its your typical bar food, and not even that good. 

Our waitress was very friendly. She was really attentive and personal. Nothing more you can ask from a waitress. However, food did come out kind of slow taking around 35 minutes for our food to come out. 

This place does take Restauraunt.com certificates, which could make a group meal cheaper. Double check to make sure the Happy Hour Deals aren't cheaper.

I wouldn't come here for the food again. If someone wanted to try the ghost chili, this would be the place to go. A great staff can only make bad food go so far.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,0,0,2,UPTq4-LimqW4rF_iSn1HtQ

Happy Hour goes from 5:00pm-7:00pm and 10:00pm-12:00am daily.  You can get a pitcher of beer for $6.00; you can get pints and so forth with happy hour prices, but $6.00 pitchers have won my heart.  My two favorite brews at the moment are the All Nighter and the Weisenheimer.  Also notable are their chicken tenders on the happy hour menu, which is $6.00 and includes around 8-10 pieces of chicken.  Sauce options are mild, medium, hot, BBQ and I think maybe one more option; chicken is served with ranch and a celery/coleslaw hybrid kind of salad that I'm not too crazy about.  I'd rather have plain celery sticks.

I would say that if I'm ever in the area during happy hour, I would recommend going to this bar.  But that would be a lie, since this past Friday my friends and I were on Fremont Street and I STILL recommended this place for happy hour.

4787736,2011-04-19,1,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Oh Chicago Brewing Company, why did you kill your happy hour? CBC easily had the best happy hour in town but that recently changed when they got rid of their late night happy hour and shifted their regular happy hours to 3:00pm to 6:00pm. Aside from the terrible hour shift the happy hour still does provide some delicious beer on the cheap. Six Dollar pitchers by itself would be a pretty good deal but the quality of the beer brewed at Chicago brewery puts this happy hour over the top. Their Old Town Brown being my favorite, they offer a variety of beer to match just about any taste.

On the food end of things, I can't say I'm too experienced. I've usually stuck with the run of the mill bar food. The chicken fingers are easily one of my favorite in town. They're very lightly battered, none of this extremely crispy business you get from other places. They're decently sized and the Brew-BQ flavor is delicious, and a major plus is that they are discounted during happy hour along with the drinks. I've also had an above average hamburger there, nothing spectacular but it's definitely satisfying.

Overall a great place to have some good bar food and good beer. My only complaint is that they need to bring back the late night happy hour and shift their current happy hour an hour back so that it ends at 7:00pm instead of 6:00pm. 6:00pm just seems too early for a happy hour but maybe I'm just spoiled because of the hours that the previous happy hour ran.",eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q,2,1,4,fQ-SsCguqMK4PoaHgY2kjw

I'm thinking the menu and/or recipes have changed in the vast amount of time between my last visit and this recent one.  The decor is fun.  Brick with stained glass windows.  They offer two options for seating; tables and chairs or half circle booths.  The booths remind me of 'old Vegas' booths one would see in dining entertainment halls [in casinos] back when the brat pack were performing.  I'm thinking it could easily be transformed into a faux medieval tavern with taking out a few modern decor items and putting in some shields, swords and tapestries.  The smoking section is the bar and enclosed in behind glass walls and glass doors so one can truly be separate from the smokers.  I will say however that once in a while I got a faint smell of cigarette smoke; I'm guessing the servers exiting and entering the bar to serve food.  Anywhere you sit in the dining room you have full view of televisions (sports channels, bleh) and the kitchen.   We ordered garlic knots and pretzel bite appetizers.  The garlic knots are huge and delicious!  Friends ordered pizza and a Vienna beef sandwich.  I ordered the flat iron steak dinner.  Everything was delicious!  I cut a garlic knot in half and created a flat iron steak slider.  The handcrafted root beer is now my number one favorite root beer.  I didn't think my childhood RB favorite could ever be knocked down to second best, but their root beer succeeded.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The only thing I could see improving this restaurant is make it all no smoking so I can check out the bar area (but that's for my personal benefit).

- 22oz draft for $2.50; wine, 3; well drinks, 4; delicious HH bar dishes ($3-6) ); 
- Its reverse HH still goes between 10-midnight (I've got to give it a try after movies sometime)!

YELPY DETAILS YOU CAN IGNORE:
- After a long walk in Pueblo Park yesterday (Sunday) afternoon, I wisely decided to hydrate myself properly, well, deliciously! So, I went to CBC for the 22oz draft and thin crust pepperoni pizza($6 plus $1 extra for pepperoni)...over exciting NFL games! 
 - And...What a healthy HYDRATING experience it was, indeed! 

Now, here's something STRANGE about ""Seating at the BAR COUNTER"", though: 

- When I got in CBC around 4:30, I first went upstairs to take a look at their small loft bar. The bar counter itself was completely full; the lounge area still had a few bar tables. However, other than the lone barkeep, I did not see any server upstairs (perhaps, not until after 5pm). 

- As I was alone this time, I wanted to sit at the bar counter, so I went back to the downstairs lounge.   Here I was surprised to find out that the Happy Hour seating is ""restricted"" to the lounge area! In other words, one cannot have HH at the downstairs bar counter itself! 
- I think the reason for CBC's doing this is that they want the gaming machines available to playing customers. Perhaps, CBC knows that most their HH customers are NOT INTERESTED in playing video poker machines?
- There's no such restriction in the loft bar lounge, however. 

- Well, luckily, I got a comfy bar table along the wall, with a great viewing angle for several tv's! The food and drinks were great! My server was pleasant and attentive. And the atmosphere was just right for the occasion! The lounge area was almost completely full by 6pm, full of screaming fans for the 49ers and later for the ""home team"" Bears [who lost, if you care to know, to the Texans!]

BTW: - Oh yes, there's an elevator, too, hidden around the corner of the bar. So, CBC is handicapped friendly.

Their patio is pretty nice and in the afternoon part of it sits in the shadow of the building so it isn't too bad. There are TVs out there if you want to catch a game.

Order of teriyaki chicken tenders - these were crispy but the teriyaki was too salty for me since it was tossed with it. Probably would order them plain and just put a little. 

Mini cheese pizza - this was pretty alright flatbread type. I wouldn't really order those again. 

We also got some waffle sweet potato fries which were crispy and really good. 

Washed it down with their Black Star Stout which was really nice, nitro nice dark malt and dark chocolate notes.

There were two nice flatscreen TVs showing basketball, which the bar group enjoyed loudly. I loved how the natural light looked, streaming in through the windows and hitting the brick walls. Ah, Ohio...

The food? Meh.  When you serve cheese sauce with beer in it, the beer does not make up for using VELVEETA. Ok? REAL cheese, please. The chips weren't that good either. I was so disappointed. I tried the garlic pretzels and they were good, but more like soft, kosher-salted rolls. My friend's steamed clams did not taste fresh to her, but she thought they were ok.  

I don't know that I would come back here. I don't have anything awful to say about it, but I was underwhelmed during this visit.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,5,2,2,UEObfqG6ydNWkB8o5HeeyQ

The last time I ate a couple slices of their small deep dish pizza, I fell into a food coma, and it ruined my Friday night.  I was so stuffed, that I couldn't move. I suppose I should blame myself, but I wouldn't have eaten so much if their pizza wasn't so damn delicious!

We come here pretty regularly during happy hour.  They have good deals on their house beer, and great deals on their appetizers ($3 garlic knots!)  They have kind of a weird system though, happy hour pricing doesn't apply if you're sitting at the actual bar. You can be IN the bar, but you have to sit at a table.  
There's an awesome deal for girls on Saturdays (I believe it's all day). All vodka based drinks are a dollar, and they pour them strong. Again, be careful where you're sitting.  This deal only applies to patrons sitting in the UPSTAIRS bar.  Don't be scared to order something more complex than a vodka-cran.  Things like melon balls, and electric lemonades are included too!",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,1,5,7Zsfx4mUPlSK-Se-Pm-0WA
5540572,2015-07-06,0,XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA,"Chicago brewing Co is a 24 hour drinking, gaming and late dining place in the Summerlin area. I really love this place. I used to come here often when I lived close and had a late schedule. Nowadays it is few and far between to have days off and late nights. Anyway my favorite thing about this place is that it has freshly brewed beer. The best beer of my life was had here. It was an apricot heffewissen that they brewed in house. And they don't discriminate either- they make beers in all colors and styles so all beer lovers can enjoy this place no matter what your preference.

The next best thing about this place is the staff. I have been coming here over 5 years and in that time they are one of the only restaurants I have ever seen maintain the level of quality in their products and the same staff. That says a lot about a restaurant. The staff is always friendly, on top of things and it doesn't matter when you come. I love that there is always room in the dining area even when it is busy you never feel ignored by he staff here.

Lastly I of course love the food here. Their menu is pretty varied so even if you want something different every time you come, that is possible here. They have everything from thin or thick crust pizza, to burgers, to steak, quesadillas, sandwiches, sweet potato fries and also full entrees and desserts. My favorite meal here is the chicken quesadilla with a side of sweet potato fries and nacho beer cheese! A lot of food but so worth it.

As usual, I didn't go for the pizza.  I love pizza, it just does bad things to my blood sugar, and Chicago Pizza, although tasty, does extra bad things.  I enjoy eating a few bites here and there from my husband so I can get my fix.  In a place like this, I try to reserve my carbs for the beer.

We ordered the following:
The beer sampler - we wanted to try everything so we could decide what we wanted to order (I loved the Weizenheimer and Matt ordered the Black Star Stout)
Brew Wings - Ordered hot, but really weren't hot at all.  They still were crunchy, huge, and just overall yummy.  Some of the best I've had in town.  Instead of celery and blue cheese dressing it had a celery salad which was really cool, crisp and refreshing and I loved it.  Very creative and original.
Baby Brew Salad - I ordered this with a Balsamic Reduction Vinaigrette.  For a side salad this was huge, fresh and delicious.
Deep Dish Meat Lovers Pizza - Matt substituted garlic for Canadian Bacon, not sure why he doesn't like Canadian Bacon since it is just essentially ham!  The whole time he was eating this all he could say was ""wow, this is so good.""  He was very very happy with the pizza here and this might be his favorite.

I'm not sure how often we'll go here since it is, as I said, not really near where we live.  But with our restaurant.com certificate it was only $20 bucks for all this food and beer which was a bargain.  I am tempted to try the ghost pepper wings on the menu but I am a little scared.  However, with the regular hot wings being so mild I am thinking that they will be mild as well.  I shall have to work myself up to it next time. 

Oh by the way, the beer is wonderful!  Nice to find a place in town that has the beer towers again after The Pub at Monte Carlo stopped serving them.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,0,5,JqcyPgQdJlWNXXCA5Buoyw

Well on Sunday, 4/17/11, Lawrence T., came to see the show I work for and afterward, we were in search of some food. Having missed out on Ken M.'s UYE ""Pizzas, Peppers & Pints"" and living too far away to come here by myself, I was dying to try this place because they serve Ghost Peppers and luckily, it's right around the corner from Lawrence's apartment, so that's where we ended up going.

It was a ghost town when we walked in. There was one person in one booth when we walked on in. We were seated right next to the kitchen. I was torn when I saw the menu. ""Chicken fingers in ghost pepper sauce or ribs."" It was a tough choice because I'd been dying for ribs for a good week now, and to add insult, my parents had went to Lucille's BBQ earlier that day with my youngest siblings and brought my sister and me back nada. The pull for BBQ was too strong, and I ordered the ribs and fries ($19), and Lawrence ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich ($10)  topped with breaded onion strings, and macaroni salad.

We didn't have to wait too long for our meal to be delivered to us. The food runner switched our plates and seemed a bit surprised that no, the meat was my order. My ribs were good, but not fall off the bone. They weren't the Memphis Dry Rub ribs that I love so much, they were smothered in some sort of BBQ sauce. I regret not trying the Ghost Pepper... anything because common sense tells me I can eat BBQ anywhere. Lawrence took half his sandwich home for the next day but I assume he liked it.

Our bill came out to $31.35 with tax, which is a little steep for late night food, but that's my fault for ordering ribs. Would I be back, eh... only if I'm for sure going to order something with the Ghost Pepper, otherwise, nah.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,0,3,KTfC9HFpDGYEWElXJ_Y5Wg

I had the Black Star Stout, the Hardway IPA and the All Nighter and all of them were stellar.  For dinner I had the Cajun pasta, which I would highly recommend to anyone.  The guy sitting next to me at the bar, who appeared to be a regular, told me the deep-dish pizzas here were stellar, but since I was a party of one I thought that a whole deep dish would be too much my waistline.  The rest of the menu appeared to be standard brewery fare with a solid selection of pastas, pizza, sandwiches, burgers and appetizers.

The atmosphere of this place was kinda nice.  Downstairs had a enclosed smoking area bar (where I learned the bartenders can take your food order but not deliver it to your table due to smoking laws; they leave you food right outside the section, tell you it's ready and you have to get it yourself) complete with many TVs, and there was an upstairs section as well that had a Golden Tee machine and a cigar lounge.  There also was a normal dining area and a patio as well.

Service in the smoking area of the bar was a bit slow, as the bartenders seemed a bit preoccupied by the girls at the end of the bar rather than my empty beer glass, but I can't really blame them too much since the girls were hot.

I came with my two fellas for some burgers and beer. I ordered the Bar Brew-Q Burger, as did my main fella and my friend Ryan B ordered the Chili Burger. I was very happy with my food. Huge, I'll definitely be doing some sharing next time I'm there. The burger was moist, flavorful and cooked perfectly. Great price for the quantity and quality. 

To top that glutton fest off, we couldn't resist some delectably indulgent deep-fried treats. We ordered the deep-fried ho ho, honey bun and caramel apple (I refuse to type carmel, lol).

There was a pungent overpowering smoke odor and I just felt like I wanted to shower as soon as I got home to get the smell out of my hair.  We sat at a table and one of us had to get up each time and order pitchers at a time since it took awhile to get drinks.

The second time, I sat with a few friends at the tables on the first floor by the fireplace.  The service was extremely slow and I realized after awhile it was because the main bartender was also running around grabbing table orders too.  I'm not sure if that's usually how it is, but that definitely caused a delay in service.  Again, we'd preemptively order a couple drinks at once to hold us over until he came back around.

Don't ask why, but I ordered the ahi tuna salad. At a bar. Hmm.  It was actually pretty okay though.  Too much salad to tuna ratio, but it was okay.  I wouldn't order it again though.  The general agreement from my other friends about the food was that it was okay.

If I was rating just beer, I would give this place 4 stars.  They have a house blueberry vanilla kinda beer that is really yummy.  Their house beers are good and I'd go back for that alone.  I really like their house blonde, it's light and tasteful.  But the service is just terrible and the food is just okay.
