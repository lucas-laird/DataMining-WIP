This place is always closed, if they r open then there is a sign that says ""gone for 1hr"". I mean how can u stay in business when u are always closed.",SgoEbICXOJ5SXHuKw-3JBQ,0,0,1,-rEKseQjtoAv37BqpOpWzA

For $2.39 you can get a typical Mrs. Fields cookie that is sugary sweet and delicious -- a moist and chewy treat that is slightly crispy around the edges. I love their cookies, but, as with all airport dining, it's overpriced.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,1,0,3,Uov4jauhxN4ccRjbXdqCcw

I'm glad we saw one in the McCarran airport in Vegas. I'm not sure the dozen we bought will step foot on Hawaiian soil...hahaha",qKwaplsfbvqIHU0v7rk8bg,0,0,5,I-Xq7iizWSJ02GE7IznItQ
