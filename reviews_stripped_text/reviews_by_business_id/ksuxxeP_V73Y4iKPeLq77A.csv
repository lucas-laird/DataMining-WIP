I chose the chicken fajitas which were actually pretty good.  It was lots of meat.  I did have to add some salt and pepper but I was okay with that.  The service was good as well. There was no pressure to buy additional items.  They did come around and take pics for a personal postcard.  The pic for my husband and I were really good so I bout it, but again there was no pressure and I still got the initially promised free postcard.

24880,2013-10-23,0,ksuxxeP_V73Y4iKPeLq77A,"We have been in Vegas since Sunday and this was the second time we ate here. I was pretty skeptical because of the reviews but by the time I saw them, we'd already been seated inside.

Trip 1 was for dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty but the service was excellent and so was the food. I had a chicken fajita burrito with rice and beans on the side. It was delicious. I thought the reviews were wrong. The only negative was the pricing seemed a little high. 

Wellllll, trip 2 was the absolute opposite experience. We went for breakfast this time. They drew us in with 99 cent bloody marys. They were good... Had to order doubles so they came in a standard glass and not a kiddie cup.  

The service was slow (and slow is being nice). Our waitress was horrible. It took at least 10 minutes for her to even come over after we were seated. We ordered our drinks and she asked for our IDs. I was having trouble finding mine in my purse and our drinks came out before she came back to look at the ID which I thought was funny. It should have been a clue as to how ""on top of things"" she'd be. 

Anyway, we ordered food and once the food came, she brought our bill, told us to let her know if we needed anything else, and scurried off before we could order another round and ask her to separate our checks.  She didn't come back for at least 15 minutes and that's no exaggeration. At that point, she tried to take our bill -- which had no payment in it because we weren't finished. We ordered our second round and requested out bills be separated. The waitress told us that she would need to find the manager to do that and acted as if it was a major inconvenience.

Again, she didn't come back for about 15 minutes. In the mean time, I watched her dig in the trash can on two separate occasions looking for things she'd thrown away.... Who knows if she washed her hands. 

She finally saw me staring at her and I guess she remembered we needed our bills. She brought them and since I paid with my card, she wanted to see my ID again. I really couldn't have gotten out of there any faster.  It was a terrible experience.

The only reason I rated this place two stars and not one was because of the dinner experience.",dA6RUdQ_NWfRWvqzTZCSqQ,1,0,2,JiizqtviDioQOGM-njr3wA

Dinner was DELICIOUS!!.  I had a burrito with roasted carnitas and green chile sauce on top.  My aunt had enchiladas with green chile sauce on top.  Both came with rice and beans (I had pinto).

I would like to go here again and bring my husband.  They have a fun food challenge.  If you can finish their yard margarita and giant burrito, you get a t-shirt.  Even if you can't finish it, the meal is a great deal.

We had a late night and manage to get out on the strip just as most restaurants stopped serving breakfast (11 am). We were dying for some yummy breakfast since the day before we had the worst breakfast burritos known to man at Tacos and 'Ritas at the MGM Grand food court. We were happy to see this place served breakfast until 12. They also advertised a 3.95 special (eggs, potato, breakfast meat of choice) and 99 cent bloody Mary's. Everything was delicious. The only complaint was that my tortillas were a little dry. The home style potatoes were delicious and the bacon seemed to be higher quality then your average franchise diner.  

Our expectations were low because of the price, but it seemed like they blew them out of the water. I have no clue how good the rest of their food is, but you can't beat the breakfast for that price!",xah6f7WbfvTZXxhfLPWbSw,2,0,4,Y0qVJcmmtO9qKTJdM0HOCA
164824,2011-05-09,0,ksuxxeP_V73Y4iKPeLq77A,"WOWWWWWW. This place sucked. 

Simply put, this place charges way too much money for low-quality food.

I hate that this is the first place I've reviewed that is forcing me to give it a one-star rating. I almost wanted to give it two stars because the carnitas in my tacos was pretty good, but the rest of the food and the entire experience was pretty underwhelming.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla appetizer and he said he had about two pieces of chicken in it. He was really disappointed with the taste.

I ordered the Two Tacos platter of carnitas. The tacos were all right, nothing special. I reeeeally tried to eat the rice and beans, but it was not happening. I tried eating them over and over and the taste kept putting me off. They just tasted so inauthentic and old.

I also ordered the almost $3 chips and salsa (I don't know why I paid for chips and salsa -_-) and those were just mediocre. Everything I ate pretty much tasted like it had been microwaved a million times or had that inauthentic store-bought taste. Bleghhh.

That's all we ordered and the total was almost $30. Luckily we drank water, but if we had ordered soft drinks or anything more expensive our total would have been at least $35. It was REALLY badly overpriced.

The service wasn't great, either. Nothing to rave or rant about.

I feel like I work hard for my dollar and I was so sorry I had wasted so much money in one place.

I will not go here again and I would not recommend this place.",IL92sXwOHCIrzLqbS8ycIw,0,0,1,Vf3dfh3RGtwJ4bdLgpKx-g

I prefer this location to the one on the strip because you can save 20% off your entire bill by visiting the Miracle Mile concierge and getting a coupon book (officially, it's for any AAA member).  And yes, it's also good on the margaritas!  

Disappointed that they no longer offer comp chips and salsa but their food is much better than Cabo Wabo's.  

I recommend the mexican pizza, fajita quesadilla (my favorite), or any of the fajitas.

The only drawback I saw was the hostess that seats people could have been more on the ball, there were people waiting to be seated and she was nowhere in site, since the place was not busy at all, I could see her being more courteous and helpful.  Our server was very nice and helpful though.

For the price I paid, the total bill for two people was less that $20.00, I would maybe look around more next time if I was to try any of the other places in the Miracle Mile shops area that serve breakfast.",GCzwuzrjXaLN0xg-K0K18g,0,0,2,wfDrevzrsTUiQtX5CshndQ

besides everything, the food was way below average.  And the two that shared a plate were both up with their heads in the toilet most of the night.  And since we had a large group the useless waiter got a $43.00 tip automatically included in the bill.

Going here makes me want to thank my parents everyday that they didn't raise me to be white trash.  Located in a mall populated with a mix of the cast of the Jersey shore, COPS, Real Housewives, and State Fairs, this restaurant will primarily appear to you if you like have never been to a Mexican restaurant other than Chipotle.     Our server was nice, but looked like she might have contracted 3 STDs before she was 18.

The bigs: 
- The was average, even edible.  I had the baja style fresh grilled fish tacos and munched on some of the steak fajitas.  A little bland for me, but it seemed that it was prepared in the recent present and the sides were tasty.  Obviously nothing close to authentic.

The diggs:
-One of the worst frozen margaritas I have ever had.  It was a sweetened icy slush of artificial nothingness.  Even though it was Happy Hour cheap at $3, skip it.

- They have the 48oz mini-Yard style Margaritas.  Cheap, large drinks seems to be the attraction here.  Perhaps consuming them would help to tolerate the other customers and this mall.

Like everything in this gigantic mall, it is artificial, cheesy and just plain wrong.  Sigh, this party of Vegas sours the whole experience for me.  When do I fly back to NYC again?",6VbFaYbtITwMzuCOj8567A,1,0,2,t4nKHtiU0SbJO_4Ef662CA

The decor in this place is kinda weird. Holes in the drywall, chairs and tables splattered with paint, not exactly the look of a Mexican cantina unless you want it to look like it's under construction.

Service was good. We were seated right away. The hostess, waiter, and 100 year old busboy were friendly and helped add to the atmosphere. 

My wife and I split a couple pitchers of Dos Equis they had on special for 12.95. Our guests had a couple top shelf margaritas that they said were ""top shelf"" and the prices were good compared to other Mexican cantinas in Vegas. We also split a Cantina sampler that was a mixed bag. It was nachos, quesadillas, taquitos and chicken wings. The wings were small but had good flavor. The quesedillas were tasty (my wife and I devoured them), and the taquitos weren't bad, similar to what I've had at Chili's. The nachos? um, no. These tasted as if they were served earlier in the evening, sat out on someone else's table for an hour or so, brought back to the kitchen and microwaved before serving to us. Seriously, these were bad. Some of the nachos were soggy and cold, others were still warm but dried out. 

When we got the check we noticed they charged for chips and salsa. Really? Before we could sit down we were asked if we wanted chips and salsa on the table. Ok. sure. Would you also like guacamole? sure. When we killed the bowl of chips they asked if we wanted more. Sure!  So we got charged for 2 orders of chips and salsa plus guacamole. I can understand the guacamole, apparently it is a standard upcharge in Vegas cantinas but chips and salsa? Everywhere else we have tried, they have been free. Some places just seem desperate to make a buck.

The bathroom needed to be cleaned and I noticed several dirty tables toward the back of the restaurant that no one bothered to clear off while we were there. I am guessing the 100 year old busboy was still making his way there. That did not help add to the atmosphere.

Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry ""Margarita-by-the-Yard"" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.

I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a ""Mexican Pizza"" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! 

Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey.

3692977,2014-11-28,0,ksuxxeP_V73Y4iKPeLq77A,"This is possibly the worst ""mexican"" restaurant I have ever eaten at! Thankfully my fiance and I had our entrees comped as part of a show we were seeing, but even then I felt ripped off by what we did pay for (chips, salsa, guacamole, a margarita, and jalapenos in one of our burritos). There was zero spice, heat or flavor in any of the food, with no peppers in anything except the jalapenos we'd ordered, but even those had been deseeded and washed so they had no spice at all. There was only the barest hint of cilantro in the salsa, and the guacamole was essentially just mashed avocado with a pinch of diced tomatos and white onions thrown in. The burritos were poorly wrapped, falling apart immediately, and poorly assembled, with only a dollop of sour cream and guacamole in the very center of them, so the dominant flavors were of essentially unseasoned rice, beans and meat, the salsa only adding texture with no flavor or kick. The margarita tasted and felt like it had no tequila in it as well. We asked if they had spicier salsa and they did not. All in all this was the blandest, most unsatisfying mexican meal I have ever had, and it was vastly overpriced; the only positive thing I can say is that it was warm and took up space in my stomach.

Also, they have a ""California Burrito"" on the menu which is a lie; theirs is merely a vegetarian burrito, not an actual California Burrito which is a carne asada burrito with the works and fries inside.",veMNOK_qzQ87qbhBtxZRjw,0,0,1,yZUQz87DoVsPYbjDtpe6aQ

Then, we made our decision, closed our menus and waited over 15 minutes for her to take our order (and the restaurant was not business).

You have to pay for Chips and Salsa - which was so-so.  I ended up ordering a Steak Burrito and it came with Rice/Beans.  The rice and beans were not tasty and the burrito was stuffed with the same rice and beans and barely any meat.  Did not enjoy.

On occasion they have really friendly and outgoing staff that seems to get my orders correct and then there's the ho hum servers that can't seem to get it right. You definitely notice the correlation and if you return you learn who to avoid if possible. Last trip they were unaccommodating when they left the sour cream out of my califronia burrito leaving it bland and dry. I went back and politely asked if I could get a side of it since they forgot to add it and they told me its $1.50 extra for some sour cream.

We're just walking the strip looking for some outdoor seating to kick off our vacation with some food and drink.  The patio space here is oddly shaped.  It is elongated on the left side of the large Zeus fountain in front of Caesar's.  People are pretty close together and the birds and ducks like to hang here too.  The water from the fountain and the Greek sculptures add a nice aesthetic to dining here which really saves this place.  

The service is okay as well as the food.  -nothing spectacular and really lacks fresh, piquant flavors in real Mexican food- even Tex-Mex.  We had the fish tacos which were edible but pretty flavorless.  The guacamole was okay but tasted just like avocado despite the presence of red onion and tomatoes.  I ordered the poblano pepper with cheese which I thought was cheese inside the pepper.  It's just peppers in cheese dip which was actually one of the better things here.  That fortunately gave my fish taco another dimension of flavors.

I do not recommend you order any fancy mixed cocktails here.  I ordered a top shelf margarita which barely had any of the Herradura white present.  You're better off with a beer or a shot of tequila.  We had shots of Don Julio anejo for $22 which is really reasonable.  The people here are nice enough and will probably try to sell you some fancy cocktails.  

The best part of this place is that it is really right off the strip to people watch, and you get the pleasure of a nice outdoor dining experience.

Food was hot (we had the $3.95 breakfast special and a delicious chorizo breakfast burrito) and service was pretty good. Because of the good experience we opted to come back the next morning. Boy was that a mistake!!!!! 

We waited for our waitress for about 10 minutes before she even greeted us. When we got our meal, two of us had Breakfast burritos with chorizo again. Once I bit into it I had a large piece of burnt (beyond recognition) meat. I took another bite and found more burnt meat. The meat was burnt so bad once you touched it, it crumbled like charcoal. 

I could not tell if at one point it use to be chorizo or breakfast sausage. It was also supposed to come with cheese but it had no cheese. I started to open my burrito and noticed ALL of the meat was completely charred, burnt! The other burrito had NO meat in it except one burnt piece and again no cheese in that burrito either. 

We called the waitress over to show her all of the burnt meat and that one didn't even have meat in it and that they had no cheese wasn't even sure if it they were the right burritos to begin with but whatever they were we weren't going to eat them. She said let me have them make you another one. By this time it had taken so long for us to get our food we weren't really in the mood for it anymore so we told her to just have them make us one burrito and we would share it so we could get on our way out. The rest of our family had already finished their plates by this time and we hadn't even had more than two bites.

She came out with one burrito and it was pretty good. Almost tasted as good as the one the day before but not quite but at least it didn't contain charcoal remnants. Once she gave us the bill she charged us for two burritos. We told her we only ended up eating one so she had to take the other one off. She comes back 5 minutes later and argues that we ordered two burritos. I tell her yes we ordered two but received two badly burnt, unedible burritos and we ended up only eating one after she had the kitchen make us a new one. She said because we had bitten into the first two burritos she was charging us for those. 

I told her if we didn't start to taste it how would we know that the contents inside the burrito were completely burnt? She said well you just shouldn't have eaten it. If our cooks make you two we will charge you for what you order. I said, I don't know who in their right mind will eat burnt food and then pay for it. We refused the plates once we noticed the food was burnt. She continued to argue with us that it didn't matter how the food came out we were going to get charged for what we ordered. I said your problem isn't with me, tell your cooks not to give you burnt food then all will be well. She went ahead and took off one burrito although from the beginning she should have comped both plates and not argued with us when we had digested horrible charcoal for our breakfast.

Fajita Steak - very weak thin slices of beef not sure how you can pass that off as steak.

Fajita Chicken - decently tender and juicy not dried out 

Fajita Pork - shredded pork with pretty good flavor, best out of the meats we had.

$3.95 Breakfast Special like what is listed and blasted all over their reviews...

It is in a well decorated part of the miracle mile shops - lighted painted arched ceilings make the area seem like it's outdoor - very classy. But by contrast the decor of this restaurant was very plain and ordinary. 
The hostess was pleasant and seated us quickly. I was surprised that chips/salsa were not brought to the table. When we asked, we were told we can order them as an appetizer. I believe this is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to that didn't provide chips and salsa. But enough about that. On the lunch menu the lunch entrées were in the $12-$17 price range. We scoured the menu but did not find an ala carte menu. We ended up ordering a quesadilla from the appetizer menu and a burrito-bowl-style taco salad. And of corse chips/salsa. Stingy is the only way I can describe their attitude toward the salsa. Very small, very shallow bowls of salsa. It wasn't a huge problem but it was inconvenient to have to repeatedly ask for more salsa. The quesadilla was good. The taco salad was not. There was too much lettuce in the bowl to allow me to actually mix up the ingredients. The lettuce was not cut into mouth sized bites, and overall the salad was dry. It would have been nice to have some sort of Mexican sauce on the salad----something like salsa, for example.
It wasn't horrible, but it was unremarkable other than the anomalies mentioned above. With so so many other choices nearby, this restaurant needs to step up its game. When I come back to Vegas, It will not occur to me to eat here again.",09zYk9OdWRbmbaLhaEFnKw,0,0,2,_IuhVNeErloNQszsLmhDqA

To walk the strip mid-day, you had to seek refuge from the scorching heat wave by galavanting through each hotel along the way. Some hotels had misters on their overpriced outdoor bars along Las Vegas Blvd, and this was reason enough to stop for a cold bevvie and a rest in the shade. But I quickly learned that drinks get warm quickly and the water from the misters evaporated before they reached me. 

Disgruntled and sweaty, we walked past the famous fountain at Caesar's Palace. Low and behold, we found our oasis right at Caesar's feet! (Literally right next to that fountain where the ducks hang out.) Lasalsa Cantina advertised on a small chalk sandwich board a bucket of 5 beers for $20 -- mix & match! (Let me tell you, in Vegas, unless you're gambling for free drinks, this is a DEAL!) We sat in the only comfortable outdoor restaurant in all of Las Vegas! There was an indoor option too, but on this small patio, the umbrellas over our tables had misters that were actually low enough to cool us off! 

The food was authentic Mexican cuisine. The guacamole that came with our giant $5 bowl of chips and salsa was freshly made with large chunks of avocado, yuuuummmm! The flautas were the best I've ever had, and everything was spicy, spicy, spicy! Just how I like it!

We ate here twice for breakfast. I had the $4.29 special the first time (2 eggs, 1 meat and potatoes). It was ok, but the eggs were drier than I like. The second time, I had huevos rancheros without beans, and it was great! My mom ate the biscuits and gravy and really liked her choice.

Both times, the waitresses we on point. Coffee is only 99 cents. I recommend going here if you are looking to save money on food or want a decent breakfast at 8 am.",1T4L-307j6UuGLHObfJ5xg,1,1,4,NQm433xBn7lS98FvUovmTg

I'd been to other La Salsa locations in the past and thought they were fine--how bad can you mess up Mexican food anyway? I ordered the bean and cheese burrito that came with a side of beans and rice (more beans, yay!). The burrito was OK, nothing out of the ordinary, but the rice was not only flavorless, it was kind of hard. I'm usually not a fan of the side rice at most Mexican places and this did nothing to change my mind--meh. My bf had ordered the cheese enchiladas but they ended up having chicken in them. Since he's a strict vegetarian he couldn't eat them but we were also running short of time so we just traded instead of trying to send it back (the service was on the slow side). The enchiladas were OK, but again, nothing remarkable. Another thing to add to the meh-ness: we couldn't believe there were no complementary chips and salsa! Am I just a spoiled gringo? Maybe, but isn't that pretty much their specific clientele here? At any rate, we got to fill up before a show and that's about all I can say about this place.

I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, even though my honey is a spicy Spanish dish, but I do know the difference between ok, good, and great Mexican food.  The food is about 2-2.5 stars.  I ordered the ""Grande steak burrito""... it wasn't close to being ""grande""  nor could I find much steak a mist all the fillers.  Give me a hold-in-the-wall Mexican dive any day of the week and twice on Sunday's before I would consider eating here again.  

Why the generous 3 stars?  Happy hour drinks were a good deal.  $10.50 for a yard of lime margaritas with a souvenir cup. $1 more for an extra shot.  And $3 draft beers.  Other than that, stick to the apps is my advice until they steal a chef from a Roberto's type joint.   PEACE!",Mv55A30nEcAl3vk4qow5dA,1,0,3,G84higt7lphFdu62zL-nxg

Denver Omelette had large diced onion, green and red peppers with smaller pieces of ham smothered in co-jack cheese. The meal also had fried potatoes with onion and peppers, so good and pinto beans. This was $8.25.

My wife had the breakfast quesadilla with bacon, she said it was the best. It came with the fried potatoes and an excellent fresh salsa. Only $8.75

I recommend that you sit outside looking at the people walking the Miracle Mile for entertainment.
