The selling point -- high quality meat (especially their turkey and roast beef - these aren't deli slices, but instead are the real deal), and hearty sandwiches that don't skimp on the toppings.  Their small was more than enough to fill me up - it's a 9-inch sandwich, but loaded.

The Bobbie is my favorite so far -- turkey, stuffing and cranberry -- Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  The stuffing is what makes it -- really nice flavor.  I've also tried the Slaw B Joe - a roast beef sandwich with cole slaw.  A bit messy, but also good flavor, and I'm not a huge roast beef fan.

I'd rank this as #2 on my Vegas sandwich list (with Earl of Sandwich taking the top spot if we're only focusing on sandwich quality), but hard to beat Capriotti's for overall value, plus a taste of the local vibe.",_gjKuFxdQSLPrf6fYSiUwg,0,0,3,hu6weoE_jNZliXUc-6LX8A

We were searching thru yelp to where to go for lunch, and this came up. A Vegas resident said this place was the shit... and hey it was right by the hotel so why not! 

After my visit to Capriottis, all I can say is that I want more! Very yum to the Capistrami, like usual, I got a bit greedy and got the medium. I was full after the first half but didn't want it to go to waste cause it tasted so good! It was a perfect blend of warm pastrami and the cold Cole slaw inside of a fresh tasting roll. 

My friend got the Bobbie, said it was good but she'd def like it more if they warmed up the sandwich.

You will have to wait a bit longer than typical for the average deli.  Not only do they have a lot of customers during lunch but it takes the workers an extended amount of time to make one sandwich.

My fianc√©e and I sat down to this venue on 10/11/12 while attending an annual fastener show in Las Vegas.  All of the staff we made contact with were very friendly and offered recommendations on where to begin on the menu since it was our first visit.

In the end and at the advice of the lady working the register, we decided on the 20-inch Capastrami and DAMN it was so awesome!!  

The Capastrami is a combination of hot pastrami, cole slaw (I'm not a fan but with this combination it is off the hook and worked for me), Russian dressing, and of course - Melted Swiss CHEESE!!!  This is all wrapped in a hoagie that felt like it was steamed (crust did not flake off).  Like the pros that they are, these items, when brought together (in the way that they do) will definitely leave you salivating for more!!!  

Oh, by the way there really is no secret why this venue has been voted Number 1 over the years but in my opinion it all comes down to the customer service.  The food is awesome but it's the customer service that keeps them coming back for more.

Capriotti's in Vegas is located on Sahara Ave.  I never would've thought about coming here unless I stayed near this part of the strip.  What to get here?  I loved the Capastrami, which is pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing.  Amazing Russian dressing, one of the best ever.  

I tried a bit of my friend's Homemade Turkey with crushed pepper.  That crushed pepper totally made the sandwich and I actually requested some on the side for my own sandwich.  Add that crushed pepper to any sandwich, and it'll bring it to a whole different level.  Addicting!

Roast beef is incredibly flavorful.  We went back the next day and I got the Cheesesteak.  It's legit as well with thin sliced beef and great provolone.  As for hot peppers and request the crush peppers on the side to add on.  Guarantee the last bite is as good as the first.

1273998,2018-04-23,0,fTtkz2RhWNAp6jKiIzXf_A,"Alright - so here's the thing about Vegas.  It's pretty much designed to hustle you the second you get off the plane (see the slot machines in the McCarran airport terminal) - it's at least 20 on a taxi to get from the airport to your hotel, and each/every hotel casino on the strip offers all sorts of services...as long as you are willing to pony up, and even then, the results can be mediocre (every buffet joint on the strip is a different variation of meh).  The locals (unless they party) pretty much avoid the strip due to its exorbitant cost and bullshit.  So, what does the frugal intelligent traveler do?  Well, you rent a car (not that expensive if you comparison shop), plot stuff on the GPS and go to the joints on the side streets away from the ridiculousness.  It also helps if you have a local who can tell you where to go to get better bang for the buck.  For example - Capriotti's.  

Capriotti's is a medium size regional sandwich joint based in Wilmington, Delaware, somewhat similar to Jersey Mike's.  They used to have stores in the South Jersey metroburbs outside Philly, and at least one location in DC (Joe Biden used to buy subs to bring back to the White House), but they mostly closed down for various reasons.  Nowadays it's  within the upper reaches of Delmarva, and some stores that are running up against Wawa/Sheetz in Northeastern PA.  Their focus area is Northern California (their franchisee in the Inland Empire closed a bunch of stores), and of course Vegas, which features at least 7 stores that are owned directly by the corporate parent.  This one on Sahara Blvd is about the closest it'll get to the strip, walkable from SLS Las Vegas and the Monorail stop.  

Their claim to fame is the Bobbie, which is essentially taking your Thanksgiving leftovers and jamming it onto a hoagie roll.  Great idea as long as you plan to take a nap afterwards.  My interest is a decently priced quality Italian hoagie that me and the missus can munch on during our flat-out high speed burn through the frantic oblivion of Baker, Barstow and Berdoo (aka Southbound on Interstate 15), and as Uncle Duke can tell you, you can't stop for food there, it's bat country.  So, how did Capriotti's do in that regard?  

Pretty good - one of my pet peeves with Italian sandwiches (at least when it came to New York joints) is the sandwich-maker's propensity to douse it up with oil, vinegar and herbs, making it a soggy mess.  Then there is the eternal question of the quality of the cold cuts - is it cold and taste like it was freshly sliced off the machine?  Also, the entire thing should work well together, as in, if you are going to provide a bunch of relatively soft cuts of meat, make the hoagie roll chewy and correspondingly soft enough to sink your teeth into, as there is nothing more frustrating than to gnaw on a decent set of cold cuts and tomatoes, and then run into a bun that require the jaws of life to cut through.  So the version that I had was clearly freshly made -  I waited almost 10 minutes for it, and the sandwich maker did not prompt me for the fixins', while the place was clean the service was just merely passable.  The sandwich was neatly packaged, the cold cuts were cold and fresh, and while it has tang of the dressing, it was applied with restraint and discipline, yielding a flavorful but toothsome product that did not fall apart with each encompassing bite.  All this was surprising for a medium sized sandwich shared amongst me and the missus at around $11.  I mean, granted, I was hoping for something better than just a sub, but the Singaporean chicken place nearby was closed for renovations, the kosher tax on the Israeli falafel joint was a bit much, and I need to get to LA before the Friday freeway traffic kicked in, and for that, Capriotti's delivered.",EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw,0,1,5,Wxxh5HSsBV3W4QOkfR79gA

On the other hand if you want a new taste that will blow your mind then stop by Cap's. As a constant return customer my only complaint is that they don't stay open long enough.

I would vote for Capriotti's to take over all Subways but I'd most likely gain 20 pounds from eating a sub everyday for the rest of my life. A foot long a day would make any girl happy.

Capriotti's prides itself on freshness, slow cooking and hand pulling their turkey and roast beef at the shop. The three sammys I suggest and love are the grilled italian, the cheese steak, and the signature bobbie. The first 2 are pretty self explanatory, loaded with tons of meat, cheese and veggies and beyond scrumptious. The bobbie however is specific to them and is made of  homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. Your first bobbie will have your taste buds dancing and when you stare that sub down like Joey on Friends you'll never be the same. Every Subway you pass from that moment on will look like the talentless redheaded stepchild of the sub world.

My one recommendation is to snag a bag of medium sized chips.  Offering other flavors not available in the small size, there is enough for two and you pay only a smidgen more.

1983045,2011-06-27,1,fTtkz2RhWNAp6jKiIzXf_A,"So good we got an extra sandwich to go.

My fianc√© could live on sandwiches for the rest of his life and be a happy well fed fella. He's always on the look out for a new place and today he suggested Capriotti's with a certain eagerness in his eye.

Located next to the Golden Steer just off the strip (yet in a non-run down area) with plenty of parking. Capriotti's is a smallish restaurant with about 10  - 12 tables (depending on the arrangement). Since you can eat a sandwich fairly quickly or take it home, it's not really an issue. Plenty of seats were to be found when we were there.

I ordered the Italian Meatball and he ordered the Turkey sandwich. Like most couples we took a bit of each other's sandwich. While not a big turkey fan, I have to say it was really put together well. REAL turkey with chucks of meat and not the pressed deli meat you'll find in a sandwich vending machine. With plenty of condiments mixed with a nice mixture of spices made for great turkey sandwich.

I ordered the Meatball and consider it one of the best I've ever eaten. The  bread was soft enough to allow the cheese and tomato sauce to mix together so you get that delicious tomato, meat, cheese, bread paste in your mouth. 

Many places will serve it to you with a hard shell of a sandwich leaving you with a soggy inside and a impenetrable crust capable of chipping a tooth. Luckily you won't find such a monstrosity here.

The staff was very friendly and didn't blink an eye when we asked for condiments. They even suggested some options they thought would go create with the sandwich.

At the end, we enjoyed our individual sandwiches so much we ordered the famous ""Bobbi"" to go for dinner that night. Despite being 6 hours old and sitting in a car for a while, it was still very tasty. I only imagine how much better it tastes fresh or after taking it home.

If dollar value matters, rest assured the prices are fair and the smallest sandwich is 9 inches long which should satisfy anyone. 

So if you love sandwiches, go to Capriotti's for a great deal and probably the best sandwich you've had in a long time.",Gcx8OEYpT85qddaoiFw3Gw,1,1,4,nQgdJrTUPFC1wygfRSUrQQ

I got the 20 inch Turkey sub.  For 12.99 that's a phenomenal deal.  You definitely get the value for your money.

However, when you break down each of the components, the sandwich itself is just average.  The turkey wasn't sliced turkey, but instead kind of like the same chopped up consistency you would find in a cheesesteak.  I have no issues with that, but the turkey was a bit dry.  

The bread is a very soft bread, with no crust whatsoever.  I'm spoiled by the great bread from the Northeast, where it has a nice crust on the outside and very chewy on the inside.  The bread here is still good, but I wouldn't call this a hoagie.

All in all, the sandwich itself is really average; it's the value that you get for your money that drives it up to 4 stars for my review.  It's a decent substitute, but no match for a real hoagie.",0ge1098FnaWkVQ2IQuXNbA,4,1,4,V1GrjkVg5hiEK1kGEo_aoQ

We visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had.

Each sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette.

The verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10.",jQ_X7Ob2WB_eH43i_hrSgg,1,1,4,_jExegnAqvNwwgyDuSzUGQ

My wife and I stopped by this place when were vacationing in Vegas last year.  Luckily for us, it was within walking distance from the Stratosphere where we were staying.

We had searched the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try.

My wife ordered the 'Bobbie'; basically thanksgiving dinner stuffed within a loaf of bread.  Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo.

I ordered the Cheese Steak with mushrooms and onions.

While both of our sandwiches were prepared well and served at a decent temperature, we both felt the same way about the food.  It was decent, but was missing some flavor in some places.  A little salt could have benefited both of our sandwiches.

While the bread itself was delicious and fresh, it was a bit of a chore gnawing through it.  The Bobbie my wife got could have benefited from being toasted.

While I feel the food falls inbetween 2 and 3 stars, I felt the need to give them 3 because the service was stellar.  The staff was very attentive and was very helpful despite the fact that we were probably the 85735739th out-of-town vacationing couple they'd served that day.

Apparently we came near a strange early closing time and the manager sent us off with a large bag of 6 whole loaves of their bread on the house!!!  We happily accepted these and they came in useful to snack on while in the hotel room.

I go to them all the time all over Vegas. But the last two I've been to seem to always run out of wheat bread. This is a major problem! 50% or more people want wheat bread over white. So I order a Cole Turkey and asked for wheat bread and they told me they only have it on sliced bread. I said no prob, give me that then I pay for the sandwich. Next thing they realize is the sliced bread that they claim was wheat is not actually wheat bread and they don't have any at all. Now I have no choice but to eat the white bread so I said I might at well, give me the sub on non sliced bread. At this point the service and the delay has ruined my experience at Capriott's. He had to charge me the difference because I switched back to white bread but that's not the point. I probably would of walked out if I didn't pay for it already.

A coworker of mine suggested a sandwich place literally around the corner from Industrial Road called Capriotti's. Apparently the food there is divine and I had to try it. Falling for another suggestion of great food, and seeing on the internet it was also listed as The Best of Las Vegas a couple years in a row (like all the other restaurants here), I gave it a chance.

My supervisor suggested ""The Bobbie"", a trademarked sammie from this shop. I took the suggestion, and about fifteen minutes later the cold sub came to my desk. It was nicely wrapped in traditional butcher paper, and a fast handwritten ""Bobbie No Mayo"" skewed the front. I ripped the tape, unrolled the culinary package and saw a great sandwich. Nay--a beauty. I am a person in love with Thanksgiving all year round, and this sandwich combined a Thanksgiving dinner in a roll. A large roll to be exact. The turkey was shredded and a great portion was given for meat. I could see the purplish-red cranberry sauce with whole cranberries along the entire thing, and a great topping--stuffing--crammed on top.

The first bite was heavenly, a beautiful flip of my hungry tastebuds and mind. I must say that this sandwich is--without exxargerating--a beautiful symphony of comfort food with the addition of bread to hold it all. The stuffing was fantastic, although clearly boxed, nicely done. The turkey, although somewhat dry in some parts, was juiced up by a great hint of cranberry sauce inbetween.

The twelve inches did not survive, and I almost fell asleep an hour later.

Most sandwiches require a side dish of chips or potato salad of some sort, yet this particular sammy from Capriotti's needed nothing but itself. That evening, I had to share the discovery with my spouse, who happily agreed after a twelve inch that this place is worth waiting in line for. The best part of the shop itself is that they sell Tastykakes--a beautiful junk dessert creation that I adore.

If you love great sandwiches, try Capriotti's in Vegas or anywhere in the U.S. for that matter. Since they have the honor of being first on my critique, and because their taste in sandwiches literally rocked my world to a whole new level, I give them the fantastic, personal rating:

She explained that to them, and they were very accommodating to her.  We ended up getting a large sandwich, half for me and half for her, and they didn't give us grief about it.  We didn't eat there;  we took it with us as we drove to Arizona, and it lasted us for two meals.  I'm a big eater, so that's saying a lot.

And guess what?  After that buffet on the return trip, we stopped by here again on the way back to California for another big sandwich.

Locals and transplants probably already know about this place, so for all you weekenders that clog I-15 on Friday nights and Sunday afternoons - you know who you are - you MUST eat here.  It's easy to miss, it's hidden away in a shopping center between I-15 and the strip.  But you'll certainly get more for your money than at the casinos.

No not the case! First I get a supervisor which is so nasty you can tell she HATES her job or her Title and she says ""it's not on the receipt I'm looking at it and it doesn't say it"" I said ma'am my husband wrote it on the special instructions section. She again says ""I'm looking at your receipt and there is nothing on here"" I said what's the point of ordering on the app? If the order is still wrong? She says ""well the app doesn't work right that's all I can say"" Wait what? So I ask can I have your general managers name she says hold on. Then a man comes on the line and says this is David I'm the GM. So I explain everything to him again and he says yes that's right. I'm looking at the receipt and it doesn't say it, but when I look your order up on my email it does say cut1/3 and extra mayo. I said ok so why wasn't it done that way. He says "" I manage a lot of stores and special orders come in on my email and they don't have access to it"" I say ""ok well that's not helping customers like me"" he says well it's not on the receipt and the sandwich maker didn't see it so she didn't do that way. I said ok but that's not right. Well there's nothing I can do he says! Wait what again?!?! So then I ask ok can i have your corporate email or phone number he then says no it's private you can go on Yelp. They see it on there. Then he says and it's the first time I hear my supervisor is rude! What?! Your questioning me. Totally disappointed at the management here! I will NEVER go back to this location again!

First off, it took me calling 3 times to finally get through.  The girl on the line was friendly and I know she took the order right because she repeated it back to me. Second, she did mentioned that it would be an hour and a half before they could deliver. No problem, 1:30 pm perfect timing or so I thought.  Not only did they mess up on the order but we didn't get the order til 2:15 pm. By that time we were all getting hangry. Yes, I said hangry. Working the show and being on your feet for 8 hours is no joke and the last thing you want to do is to wait a long time for food. Plus, I waited 45 minutes outside for the delivery.

When I first heard about this Bobbie sandwich- turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo on a sub roll- I couldn't really imagine it tasting good, but my co-worker assured me that it was delicious. Ok, I took a chance and it was so good! I was hooked. It's like Thanksgiving in a sandwich. (This is funny because they say that imitation is the best form of flattery. We now make sandwiches like the Bobbie, with our Thanksgiving leftovers.)

Through the years, I've tried the cheese steak (yum), the grilled italian (hot sub- one of my husband's favorites), the cran slam club (least favorite) and the capastrami (pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, & cole slaw- trust me- ok, a warning here, it's messy)- now my absolute favorite sub sandwich here. 

The counter is super high (for me anyway) so you can't really see, but once, when my sandwich was being prepared, I noticed that the turkey was weighed on a scale. The bread is really good, the meat is really good too, and the rest of the ingredients are high-quality. The sandwiches are broken down to the following categories: cap's specials, sandwiches, vegetarian, cold subs, & hot subs. Some of the chips selections are from back east (wise). 

Also, the sizes are: Small- 9"", Medium- 12"", & Large- 20"". Prices range from $6.50 - $12.50 for most of the subs (Do not even compare this place to Subway's $5 footlong- it's in a totally different class of its own). I usually eat half, save half. Tip: If you get the large one, you can have three meals. The nice change (recently) about this restaurant are the weekend hours: Sat- 10-8, Sun-11-7. Also, there are so many locations due to the popularity that chances are there's one in your neighborhood, if you're local.

I loved my sandwich. There was plenty of turkey, and dressing (that's what we call it in the south), but since I am not a sweets eater, I would ask for ""light on the cranberry"" next time I get this sandwich.

It's not bad...it's a decent sandwich.  It's nothing I'm willing to go out of my way for though.

Closing procedures were in the process with cleaning, etc so I person was concentrating on that while the other person was helping us.

I did observe the person doing the cleaning, wash her hands before starting our sandwiches so that was a positive. 
We got an Hot Italian and The Bobby, both to go. Both were good... but if you are a Thanksgiving lover of Turkey, dressing and cranberry sauce... get The Bobby! It is real chunks of turkey with this awesome dressing and cranberry sauce and the sub roll takes the place of the dinner roll. It really is awesome!!!

Found you lil bugger!  Known for its hot pastrami sandwich, we came in on a lil humble cloudy day and decided to be a lil bad (for my diet).

Their sandwiches come in different size...the largest...20""...o my =O!

Stick to what it is and even though im not a big fan of coleslaw...i have to admit, its really good with the sandwich.

The hot pastrami sandwich consists of pastrami (duh), coleslaw with russian dressing, which i believe its like thousand island and something....the creaminess of the dressing cuts down the TANG of the coleslaw and the cole slaw gives the sandwich the crunch and cuts down the pastrami taste and teh saltiness of it.  Everything works well...it's definitely a recommendation from me (a picky ass eater)...the bread is a lil soft, not crunchy so its doesnt hurt you when you bite into it, esp for them drunkards....

even though theres not a lot of ingredients, its a very filling meal and i even took my share home for later.  

i only wish it wasnt off the strip but i think its best that way!  
ITS A MUST GO! GO GO GO....

p.s. if you dont love sandwiches, i believe they have other stuff and they have chips and soda and its pretty decent in price....its like a local joint to chill =)",CPhfMdoSeGYjwW71k3utZw,1,1,5,woRBUaT12NKf972uY1zaCw

On the recommendation of Yelper Michelle T, I trekked from my South Las Vegas Blvd. hotel to get a sub at Capriotti's.  Imagine my surprise when I learned that the chain originated close to my hometown, just minutes from where my father worked for years!

I took Michelle's recommendations, got a Bobbie and a Capistrami and met my SO for lunch at the location of his conference.  Both sandwiches were great (though nothing will ever surpass the pastrami at Langer's in LA).

I was really looking forward to this sandwich. I ordered the Bobbie because it sounded interesting and it's not like I can get this type of sandwich at Subway, right? Be warned (or elated), the sandwiches are HUGE. 

The Bobbie is a 'Thanksgiving Anytime' type of sandwich. It's pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. I don't know if it was just an off day or what, but my turkey was so DRY. I also didn't really care for the flavor of the sandwich. The bread was good though. My bf ordered the meatball sub which he said was just average. 

This place got crazy packed at lunch while we were there. All locals too. Always a good sign. 

A memorable side note- two high school kids sat next to us with their large Capastrami (to split). I was floored at the size of the sandwich and asked them if that was the large (20""). They said that they always get a large to split because it's cheaper and they get more food. They told me to order it next time: a Capastrami with chicken cheesesteak instead of pastrami. It looked fantastic.

So after reading the reviews, I had to go and check this place out.

I decided to be different and try the regular turkey sub, and it was really good.  Not the usual deli slabs of meat, but chunks, and it was moist and flavorful.  Perhaps a little too much lettuce, but I could adjust that, so who cares, really.  The missus got the meatball sub, and that was no slouch.

As I ate, I read through the reviews on here, and each one was a variant of the same message:

""Try the Bobbie!""
""Try the Capistrami!""
""Bobbie!""
""Capristrami!""
""Bobbie!""
""Capristrami!""
""Bobbie!""
""Capristrami!""

""Alright, dammit, I'll try one of the sandwiches"", I nearly cried out, but I figured that would only get me more unusual looks than I normally get, so I went up to the counter and ordered the Bobbie for dinner later tonight.

Holy crap, I am a convert now.  It was like magical wood nymphs placed happiness upon my tongue.

So let me join my voice to the chorus extolling the virtues of the Bobbie, and now I feel compelled to see what the Capristrami is all about.

These are FINE sandwiches.  Well worth the trip off-Strip to sample one of these.  And prices are pretty fair, all things considered.

I think I have a new haunt to get my sammich on.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,1,3,5,0ppq5uksumpRC40PVsbz0Q

Thankfully, our friend recommended Capriotti's.  To be honest--I was definitely looking for some fries and ketchup--but I was open to a lunch that wouldn't undo all the calories I had burned on our 3.5 hour hike.  

Now--I'm not sure if I really did that--because my boyfriend and I ended up splitting The Bobbie.  The Bobbie seemed to be THE sandwich--the money maker--and I didn't have much energy to give my lunch that much thought.  

And thank goodness we ended up with this sub of pure goodness. It's absolutely delicious!  Seriously--It's fantastic!

Pulled turkey stuffed topped with stuffing and cranberry sauce--shoved into a huge mess in an awesome sub.  Money, I tell you! I couldn't be happier--it was simply a Thanksgiving implosion in my mouth.  

What a combination!  Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich spot hands down--and I can't tell you how excited I am to know there's one in LA.

5651895,2018-01-24,1,fTtkz2RhWNAp6jKiIzXf_A,One of the worst food experiences ever!!!! We ordered food for them to be delivered to Venetian hotel for the amount of 57 dollars and change.  The delivery guy called to tell us he was in the lobby but he wasn't there when we tried to call him his phone wouldn't accept calls. I called the store close to 10 times and they take no responsibility for it and blaming postmate for not delivering it but since we ordered directly from capriotti site postmate can't find our order. Basically took over 2.5 hours of our 3 days trip and put us in a bad hungry mood.  But the worst part is they have never said they were sorry.  And I never got an email in response to mine.  So do your selves a favor and don't have them deliver u food. Now I am disputing the charge through my bank.  What type of professional business is this? Not sure how to add a pic here but I have a pic of my order that says it was delivered and if any problem to contact capriotti and not postmates.  Well the few managers I talked to didn't think that's the case. And btw I don't do many reviews but this one had me mad for 3 weeks now. On top of that the email address the GM gave me didn't work.  I can't rate the food since we never got it but I have had zero fun talking to the managers there.,Q7q4BuYUY_Ycwb9w9OixDA,1,0,1,6YGWchz5hUja-vr_HHduxw

I mixed the Coke slaw and Russian dressing and still a little dry

The disappointment was the beverage choice. Pepsi has 90 percent market penetration in vegas. Do they claim. The fountain soda and limited bottles make it hard. I feel better beverage options craft soda would make a difference.

They have Wise potato chips, but only the big bags. Again Frito products maybe easily accessible, but it make me think of a national chain.

The place has a worn D√©cor and feels tired. It would feel cool if they had matching snacks.

My recommendation is the Capistrami.  Get the large (20""), cut it in half (two 10"" sandwiches) and share with somebody.  Nice bread... SUPER tasty pastrami... but the coleslaw on it is where it's at.  Good cold crunch that keeps you coming back for the next bite quicker than you thought you would.

Never really busy... a lot of locals order to go, so they just come in, pay, leave.  So plenty of seating for us out of towners.

After driving 3.5 hours, it was fast approaching lunch time and we were about ready to gnaw our arm off. After punching in the address on the GPS, we found ourselves in another run-down strip mall off Sahara. The blackened storefront windows didn't exactly give the wife a vote of confidence. Relaaaax, I told her. You can stay in the car, if you want to... nope, she bolted right out.

I was surprised the place was dead empty except for a creepy-looking dude who looked like he was enjoying his sandwich a little too much. I opted for a Capastrami and she got the homemade turkey sandwich. This was our first visit, so we got the ""small"" for around $6.50 each. When our food was ready, I was relieved that we didn't get ripped off by some dinky looking sub-sandwich. 

The Capastrami was good, nicely balanced with the coleslaw, Russian dressing, and pastrami. The pastrami isn't your thinly sliced type from the Hat, or of the thick-variety from some classic NY deli like Katz's. It was more of a hybrid of both, and I only wish there was more of it in my sandwich. The soft bread roll helped to sop up the juiciness and slight tangy-ness from the slaw. 

I was good, not overly stuffed to the point of food coma, but I was good until dinner. The small sandwich definitely filled me up at the good price. I can only imagine the amount of the food for a larger portions. Call me a fan, as I definitely want to try some other sandwiches. It's no Earl of Sandwich, but I'd take this over something like Subway/Quiznos/Jersey Mike's any day of the week.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,6,6,4,Asw2XQxYBJFY8ETGk_qFtg

Caps has hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads, kids meals and more. My favorite is their good 'ol homemade turkey with mayo and provolone. Their bread is always fresh & soft and their turkey is actually fresh turkey....hand pulled. Say whaaaaaat? Yea, it not processed crap or little circles of pressed meat. This is real, straight up turkey. Beats Subway and Port of Subs ANY day of the week. Their hot, Philly cheese steak is delectable with all that yummy melty cheese and peppers slathered about. MMM!

#3 Roast Beef - (so dang good!) - cooked right there in the shop, super moist and tender, and shredded
