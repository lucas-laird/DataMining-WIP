The chicken is so juicy and never dry like some others I have tried. What makes it the best is the owner is super nice and always available to answer questions. I really like how the meals are made fresh the day I pick them up that way I know they will last and be fresh for another week at least. The names of the meals are fun and different. I always have a great experience when I order from them. I would highly recommend this company for those needing fresh, flavor meals!! Thank you guys for these yummy meals!",QwnvAF5haPqOG0fOYt_Tvg,1,0,5,wO7eNSq5gk22qpkZJ4szsA

I do have to say the Cajun Me In was my favorite - the salmon was so flavorful and juicy. I love that they have meals for all tastes including vegans, vegetarians, gluten-free, etc. If you want the convenience of having meal prep done for you & enjoy the taste of your food, all while eating healthy...then Meallionaire is your go to!",WvuN89N0aIXLmWmJYG1PsA,1,0,5,rYKwnJvT0WT0gIUbgHl2tg

The day is so much easier when I have a delicious meal all ready without having to do anything!",wFXBkXZ5SzbvGoljOSRfWA,1,0,5,vus7tcKEDral4usq8uTlSg
